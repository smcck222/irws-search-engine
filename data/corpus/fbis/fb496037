  [Text] Banja Luka, April 26 (TANJUG) -- The Bosnian Serb 
Army (VRS) on Tuesday [26 April] warned it would `do everything 
to protect the lives' of its members and civilians if members of 
the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) continued to open fire on 
Serb positions and settlements in northern Bosnia, as it said 
they had often done in the past ten days. A communique released 
by the VRS First Krajina Corps said that UNPROFOR provocations 
had been frequent on the Doboj front in the past 30 days, and 
that the UNPROFOR command had failed to take any steps to 
prevent them, that is, to prevent the direct siding of the 
international forces with the Muslims, although its attention 
had been drawn to the fact more than once. The communique said 
it was regrettable that the silence on the part of higher 
UNPROFOR commands meant their tacit approval of further 
provocations by UNPROFOR units. 
  The failure of UNPROFOR commands to respond to the addressed 
warnings seems to have encouraged UNPROFOR units to continue 
staging military provocations, which have not been countered by 
the Serb side, the communique said. The communique said one had 
the impression that the direct goal of such UNPROFOR actions was 
to provoke a response from Serb forces and then accuse them of 
attacking U.N. peace-keepers, which could be used as a pretext 
for air strikes against Serb positions, the communique set out. 
The communique specified that an UNPROFOR helicopter flew over 
Serb positions in the area of Banovici several times on Monday 
and opened fire on them. The communique said U.N. peace-keepers 
in the occupied Serb village of Poljice, near Maglaj, had 
several times opened fire on Serb settlements and positions on 
the western slopes of Mount Ozren, and that UNPROFOR units in 
Zavidovici had opened fire from armoured vehicles on the Serb 
settlement of Dolac. 
  Columns of armoured UNPROFOR vehicles coming from Lukavac 
practically daily demonstrate force only a hundred meters or so 
from VRS positions at Milino Selo, Sizje and Donja Brijesnica, 
the communique said. The communique recalled Bosnian Croat 
reports according to which U.N. peace-keepers are installing 
radar systems for the detection of Serb artillery positions in 
the area of Maglaj and regularly sending on the relevant 
information to Muslim units.

  [Text] At a meeting in Split, groups of experts of the 
governments of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna and 
Bosnia-Herzegovina have coordinated a draft law on the 
government of the federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina and a law on 
the federation ministries. The future government of the 
federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina is to have 12 ministries, at 
least five of which will be headed by representatives of the 
Croat nation. In addition, two ministers will be without 
portfolio -- the government will have 15 members, prime minister 
included, it is laid down in the draft law on the government of 
the federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Zaran Buntic, the 
chairman of the Judicial Council [Sudbeno Vijece] of the Croat 
republic of Herceg-Bosna, said that the second round of expert 
negotiations on the draft laws on the official gazette of the 
federation and on the stamp of the federation would be held 
soon. The draft law on the delineation of cantons is also being 
prepared.

  [Text] Petrovac, April 26 (TANJUG) -- Local Moslem media 
report fierce inter-Moslem clashes in Western Bosnia over the 
past 24 hours. The heaviest battles between supporters of 
moderate western Bosnia leader Fikret Abdic and troops of 
radical Bosnian Moslem leader Alija Izetbegovic are being fought 
in the areas of Varoska Rijeka and Buzim. Both sides are firing 
from small arms, anti- aircraft guns, machine-guns, mortars and 
grenade launchers. Each side claims to have inflicted heavy 
casualties on the other side and to have taken prisoners, but 
the front line has remained intact. 
  The two sides recently exchanged prisoners in the presence 
of 
U.N. and Red Cross officials. Abdic's supporters released 280 
prisoners in exchange for 75 prisoners held by the other side. 
The prisoners released from Bihac by Izetbegovic's troops say 
they were starved and maltreated, while those held in Abdic's 
stronghold of Velika Kladusa did not have any complaints.

  [Text] Belgrade, April 25 (TANJUG) -- A bomb blast 
destroyed a mosque in Croat-controlled Livno in southwestern 
Bosnia early on Monday morning, Croatian radio confirmed. In 
addition to Zepce, Kiseljak, and West Mostar, Livno is now the 
fourth town in the Croat republic of Herzeg-Bosnia, the state of 
Bosnian Croats, in which Croats have destroyed all Moslem 
religious objects. Bosnian Croats and Moslems, who fought 
bitter battles for territories since the spring of last year, 
especially in central and southern Bosnia-Herzegovina, signed an 
agreement on a bi-national federation early this year under 
strong pressure of Washington. As agreed, the federation would 
later enter into a confederation with neighbouring croatia. 
  Despite the signed agreement, Croat-Moslem relations are 
still tense. This is evident also in the limited freedom of 
movement for Moslem civilians and Moslem-owened vehicles in 
certain parts of Croat-controlled Bosnia-Herzegovina. The two 
sides also disagree on the issue of who will be the first 
president of their common state, although the deadline for this 
has long passed. The Croatian side demands that the first 
president be a Croat, but is willing to agree to a compromise 
solution -- that the president be a Moslem (Haris Silajdzic) but 
not Bosnian Moslem leader Alija Izetbegovic who has been 
nominated for this office.

  [Text] The Presidential Council of the Croat republic of 
Herzeg-Bosna, at a session which is still in progress, is 
considering the last three meetings of the highest-ranking 
representatives of the Bosniak Muslim and Croat sides concerning 
the election of the leaders of the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
federation. Here is a report by Zdenko Vranjes: 
  [Vranjes] The delegation of the Croat republic of 
Herzeg-Bosna has already been to Sarajevo three times and they 
were also willing to reach a compromise in order for a political 
agreement on the nationality of the president, vice president 
and prime minister of the federation to be reached. Despite the 
fact that the deadline for the election of the leaders of the 
federation is drawing to an end -- according to the 
constitution, the assembly should reach a decision on this by 30 
April at the latest -- the Bosniak side, in the talks hitherto, 
has shown absolute disinterest and a lack of readiness to 
discuss this. The Bosniak side, furthermore, has also failed to 
fulfil the obligations it took on with the agreement between the 
government of Herzeg-Bosna and the government in Sarajevo. 
  In addition to this assessment, the Presidential Council of 
the Croat republic of Herzeg-Bosna also concluded that the 
Croatian representatives and the authorities of Herzeg-Bosna -- 
if the Bosniak side does not soon fulfill its obligations and 
fails to come up with an initiative for political agreements -- 
will interpret this as its unwillingness to implement the 
Washington agreement consistently and will propose measures 
within its competence which, in this situation would protect 
Croatian interests. 
  This conclusion could even have been sharper in view of the 
fact that several examples were cited which indicate that the 
Bosniak side has not taken the provisions of the Washington 
agreement sufficiently seriously and responsibly. Both in 
Sarajevo and in Mostar there are all too many public statements 
which show that the Bosniak side has not halted the media war, 
but is even intensifying it. The Bosniak members of the 
commission for development are not coming to meetings because 
they are refusing to answer the question of where are the 26 
Croats, whom Muslim soldiers took away from their prison in 
Bugojno and led off in an unknown direction. Bosniak 
representatives are not only not giving proof of their interest 
in implementing the constitution of the federation, but want to 
conduct all talks on the basis of old relations in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and not on the basis of the declared 
constitution of the federation, it was said at the session of 
the Herzeg-Bosna Presidential Council which is still going on in 
Mostar.

  [Text] Alija Izetbegovic, president of the Presidency of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, has sent letters to U.S. President Clinton, 
Russian President Yeltsin, and Saudi King Fahd, in which he asks 
them to follow the situation in Gorazde after NATO's ultimatum, 
and to launch new initiatives for the political settlement of 
the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In his letter to Russian 
President Yeltsin, President Izetbegovic says, among other 
things, the following: 
  We have received with pleasure and hope your firm 
condemnation of the bloodshed among the civilians in Gorazde. 
We favor a political solution to the conflict. However, the 
aggressor is not giving up the idea of destroying Bosnia and 
exterminating our people even after two years. The keys to the 
war in Bosnia-Herzegovina are in the hands of Belgrade and Pale, 
the letter states. In our hands are only the keys of resistance 
and determination to persevere in this unfair struggle between 
good and evil, between democracy and fascism. Esteemed Mr. 
President, we welcome the activities of your government with 
regard to Bosnia-Herzegovina. At the end of the letter to Boris 
Yeltsin, President Alija Izetbegovic officially invites the 
Russian President to visit Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  In his letter to Saudi King Fahd, President Alija 
Izetbegovic 
stressed his demand that in future peace talks on our country, 
in addition to the United States, Russia, the United Nations, 
and the European Union, the Conference of Islamic Countries also 
take part as a fifth equal member.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic given to </F>
OSLOBODJENJE on 10 April; place not given: "The United States 
Insists on Democratic Bosnia"] 
  [Text] The conversation with Prime Minister Silajdzic was 
carried out in an atmosphere full of expectation for any news 
from Gorazde to come in, on the 10th day of the aggressor's 
offensive against the town that has nothing left to defend 
itself with after two years of blockade. On Sunday, 10 April, 
in the afternoon hours, telegrams and messages from the field 
with dramatic reports of the aggressor's tanks rumbling into a 
southern suburb of Gorazde, just one kilometer away from the 
hospital, kept coming in. At the same time messages from 
foreign leaders and from all over the world were coming in, 
expressing great concern over the fate of Gorazde. Immediately 
after 1600 the prime minister was informed that NATO planes had 
set off for Gorazde. At the moment when the prospects for air 
strikes were still indefinite, we started our interview with the 
question: To what extent is the international community 
responsible for the tragedy of the people in eastern Bosnia? 
  [Silajdzic] The fact is that we are witnessing such a 
situation in Gorazde because the international community has 
intervened so far by benefiting the aggressor. They have 
forbidden us to defend ourselves. Therefore I think that the 
international community is responsible for the death of 200,000 
people, for the hardships of refugees, orphans, for the 
backsliding of Bosnia into a stone age. The world owes Bosnia a 
lot, and everything it does, repays just a small part of the 
debt. 
  [OSLOBODJENJE] In what way did the government of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina help the defense of eastern Bosnia? 
  [Silajdzic] The defense of eastern Bosnia last year was 
obstructed because the warlords in Herzegovina blocked the 
convoys carrying weapons. It first happened in Metkovic, and 
then in Grude. Just a small amount of the weapons passed. If we 
had procured those weapons, the situation in eastern Bosnia 
would have been different. 
  [OSLOBODJENJE] When speaking about procurement of arms, 
these days, for the first time, your role in that is being 
mentioned, but also denied. Can you explain that? 
  [Silajdzic] Following my initiative, donors to the cause of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina were urged, so they started carrying out a 
plan for supplying the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina with arms. 
This project, being, of course, not the only one, forwarded 
arms worth $36 million to air and sea ports in a neighboring 
country, given that one ship (worth $7 million) was halted. The 
$20-million shipment of arms from that ship is still waiting in 
a port for the arms embargo to be lifted. There are documents 
on that case, while the entire consignment, short of the 
aforementioned ship about which LJILJAN has also written, 
reached the planned destination. What happened thereafter is 
something else. All I know is that the 2,000-ton consignment 
was halved on its way through Herzegovina. In any case, a 
considerable amount of arms did reach central Bosnia in time, at 
the very beginning of clashes with the Croatian extremists. 
"Strijele" missiles from that contingent helped the defenders to 
halt the aggressor's tanks in Sarajevo, Olovo, Gradacac, and so 
forth. Unfortunately, these matters, and the people who took 
part in such projects, cannot be discussed publicly, which is 
being misused in the power struggle. That is wrong. It is not 
a right time for bargaining over merits. Now I have to 
acknowledge, without any feigned modesty, that it was an 
excellently done job, and I do not intend to account for my 
conduct to anybody. 
  [OSLOBODJENJE] You are the head of the first government with 
a Bosnian platform. How do you assess the first five months of 
its work? 
  [Silajdzic] Just remember what the moment was like when we 
started. We were confronted with three or four months of 
winter, and the main task was to survive. We had to ensure at 
least minimal quantities of gas, power, food.... And all that 
had to be done by negotiations with the aggressor, or in any 
other way. I think that we passed the test, and also thanks to 
the fact that the winter was mild. As for the government 
itself, we accomplished the task thanks to the enthusiasm and 
devotion of the people who took up the job. I believe that I am 
to be given least credit for that. 
  Of course, certain things could have been done much better. 
After all, the assembly has paid tribute to the new government, 
which is a great honor for us, because normally, on such 
occasions, it is negative things that are focused on. Of 
course, a great help was that the citizens of this country have 
shown unbelievable patience, willpower, and readiness to live on 
a minimum. I do not consider myself to be a good organizer, nor 
am I a good administrator, although those properties are very 
important for a prime minister. It seems that all of us were 
going beyond our own limits in the past months, and somehow 
managed to survive the winter. Now we are at a turning point. 
Which is a different story, though. 
  [OSLOBODJENJE] Are you referring to the Bosniak-Croatian 
federation? 
  [Silajdzic] I think that by the agreement on the federation 
a strategically very important step has been made toward 
establishing Bosnia-Herzegovina that we are fighting and 
endeavoring for. That is to say, for an integral, undivided, 
and democratic state without national territories. Bosnia may 
be carved up only by blood, and that is what extreme fascists on 
both sides tried to accomplish, but despite enormous numbers of 
casualties and unprecedented violence they have eventually 
failed. 
  Of course, they failed in the first place thanks to the 
people who thwarted the forming of the Croatian national 
territories aimed at seceding from Bosnia-Herzegovina. We are 
struggling to make the territories with a Serbian national 
majority somehow integrate into a unified state, in the least 
painful way possible. That struggle will be lengthy and 
difficult. The war is not over yet, and the aggressor still 
aspires to add a great part of Bosnia-Herzegovina to greater 
Serbia. 
  We are resisting such aspirations by fighting against the 
aggressor, by activities on the international stage, and by 
telling the truth. It was necessary to incite the international 
public opinion, and in the first place to explain where 
Bosnia-Herzegovina is at all, and what is happening in it. It 
was necessary to represent Bosnia, to open doors, make friends, 
develop a diplomatic framework, and all that without a single 
pause, starting with zero and broken communication. In short, 
we were supposed to behave like a state, because the world does 
not change because of Bosnia. The fact is that 
Bosnia-Herzegovina is a recognized country today, that doors are 
open to it almost everywhere, it is a member of almost all the 
international organizations, and it is very respected abroad. 
  [OSLOBODJENJE] What are the risks of the turning point that 
you mentioned? 
  [Silajdzic] The turning point is in our attempts, and I 
think we are on the best possible way, to remedy the 
consequences of the aggression in a way that ensures a civilized 
and democratic future. The federation, whose constitution has 
already been adopted, is the best possible move, because it 
makes possible a reorganization in one part of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, the one that is not occupied, enabling us to 
improve the current situation, and also to establish foundations 
for the future. The central government is strong enough to 
guarantee the functioning of the state, as well as enough 
cantonal autonomy that will ensure unobstructed regional 
development, which is a European trend. As early as now we are 
being invited to continue the talks, which started before the 
war, with the representatives of the Italian region of Marca. 
  Such a state system ensures enough freedom in economics, 
religion, and culture, so that every citizen may express himself 
or herself in the way he or she wants. On the other hand, the 
multiethnic dimension, or rather polyvalence of Bosnia, has been 
preserved, and, as one of my friends put it, that polyvalence 
stretches from the East to the West, which is a comparative 
advantage that other countries do not have. Of course, if we 
are wise enough to make good use of it. 
  [OSLOBODJENJE] The Washington agreement is a confirmation of 
the international support to Bosnia-Herzegovina. Ostensibly, 
everything has come about quite unexpectedly. What was its 
preface? 
  [Silajdzic] The agreement did not come about overnight. 
There were many negotiations. Unfortunately, many things, when 
speaking of diplomacy and logistics, are not supposed to be 
publicly explained. At a last year's meeting -- Alija 
Izetbegovic, Franjo Tudjman, Hrvoje Sarinic, Miomir Zuzul, Ivo 
Komsic, and myself were present -- a possible agreement of that 
kind was discussed. But, to be honest, the U.S. role was 
decisive. True, many people were surprised at the agreement. 
In the field, the people could hardly wait for something like 
that to happen, and that is the most important thing. Right 
now, a great task is awaiting us -- how to implement the 
agreement, since almost a half of the country is occupied. 
  [OSLOBODJENJE] The United States supports Bosnia. What 
does the United States expect from Bosnia in return? 
  [Silajdzic] There is no doubt: The United States expects a 
democratic system in Bosnia. Just as Madeleine Albright 
stressed here, the Americans are impressed by our consistency in 
maintaining a civilized attitude toward different cultures, and 
particularly in the field, they are impressed by our tolerance. 
Why is the United States so important? I have always 
considered it to be important. Europe is always exclusive, and 
the leading powers always deal with such issues by applying 
colonial methods, or in the way they had dealt with the things 
in the two world wars. In that respect the United States has a 
much fresher approach, and better understands the relations in 
Bosnia. When somebody asks why we need the United States, I 
reply: Whenever we are in the situation to mend the injustice 
done to us by the imposition of the arms embargo against Bosnia, 
like, for example, in the case of Mt Igman, or in Gorazde, we 
turn to the United States. We know that Russians are involved 
on the side of Serbia. Only a political ignorant would not seek 
a balance in the United States. If we want Bosnia to be a 
global issue, we must aspire to having the global factor number 
on our side. To accomplish that one needs time, effort, and 
knowledge. 
  [OSLOBODJENJE] You said that the United States expects 
Bosnia to establish a democratic system. To what extent do you 
think we meet those criteria, and are the conditions being 
created for the development of a modern democracy? 
  [Silajdzic] I have noticed that in recent times people are 
afraid of speaking out. Some of them do not even want to talk. 
Says a deputy: "I do not need leather jackets, even if they were 
mine." [as published] I think that fear has to do with several 
overambitious people, who fuel such an atmosphere. The Muslims 
care about the freedom within a compass that does not hinder the 
freedom of other people. In terms of the Bosniak people, the 
condensed history and experiences created a healthy attitude 
toward life and the world. Those are traits that cannot be 
hidden. Our virtues, being our fortune, must come into 
prominence. Our negative characteristics are to be found in a 
not very great sense for organization. One should create such a 
climate in which issues can be freely discussed, just like in 
any other democratic state, and even when dealing with 
weaknesses. Undoubtedly, there are many talented people, being 
an elementary civilizational advantage. Krleza [Miroslav, 
famous Croatian author] used to say that people in Bosnia were 
familiar with books when in other provinces nobody knew what a 
book is. That source of talents still exists, and we have to 
make good use of it. The real meaning of merhamet [charity] is 
that of a civilizational achievement. That is the awareness of 
the necessity to cooperate with others. Therefore we have to 
revitalize advantages that were being acquired over many 
generations. We need to remain good Bosniaks, but never again 
naive Bosniaks. That kind of balance ought to be accomplished. 
  [OSLOBODJENJE] The impression is, however, that in Bosnia 
one rules more by charisma rather than by developing a system of 
democratic institutions and relations. Is there any danger of 
one-party rule? 
  [Silajdzic] We were not allowed to develop either 
institutions or relations. We had to survive. We have created 
preconditions for that, yet a one-party system is still living 
in us. It is very difficult to get rid of it. The future 
generations will not be burdened by the past. We still are. 
The only way of getting rid of that is to strengthen pluralism 
-- market competition, competition of thoughts and ideas. The 
more we disregard different opinions, the less use we shall have 
of our potentials. I have heard that the Bosnian refugee 
children abroad are the most successful pupils in schools. You 
see, that potential exists, and we have to do everything 
possible to develop it. We must not be afraid of success and 
competition. Do you know what our basis is? Western analyses 
show that thanks to humanitarian resources in the first place we 
shall overcome the crisis. For that reason pluralism and 
democracy must be developed. 
  [OSLOBODJENJE] Is there any difference between your and 
Izetbegovic's view of Bosnia? 
  [Silajdzic] No, there is not. The efforts made by some 
people to stage disagreements, and to generate conflict 
artificially between me and the president, are quite obvious. 
That is being done by inventing diverse stories, creating 
lobbies. Only the people who have a surplus of time can afford 
such activities. I do not have time for such things. 
Intriguing, lobbying, making factions, supporting different 
factions, cannot last long, and building the state on such 
premises has no future. 
  [OSLOBODJENJE] Do recent shifts of personnel at the 
state-run television have anything to do with the aforementioned 
activities? 
  [Silajdzic] I have been informed about those shifts. I am 
not familiar with the causes. In any case, arbitrary 
elimination of people without legal-based judgments would simply 
be a recurrence of something that has already been seen before, 
something to which the people said a big "No!" in the first free 
elections. As for myself, I need to express my personal 
gratitude to all the people who have managed to perform their 
jobs over the past two years in the interest of the country -- 
starting with a nurse who goes every day from Alipasino Polje, 
where she lives, to work in the hospital, to the people working 
at the television, or those working in local community centers. 
Not all citizens are fit for fighting on the front lines, but 
still they have been doing whatever they can to help, with more 
or less success. 
  [OSLOBODJENJE] After the NATO ultimatum, and the Washington 
agreement, the atmosphere has been as if the war is over, and as 
if just a small step divides us from peace. What do you think? 
  [Silajdzic] The war is not over, but there are people who 
behave as though it is. I am afraid that there is ever less 
struggling for Bosnia, while ever more struggling for power. 
Though it is more about individual cases, that is still enough 
to poison the atmosphere, to weaken our unity, and instill 
distrust. At this moment there is no better gift we can give to 
our enemy. Which is to say, it is about people who think that 
the only way for them to come to prominence is through 
conflicting situations. When there is no outside enemy, then 
such people look for an inside enemy, just as the doctrine of 
the Yugoslav People's Army nicely taught me. I have to 
illustrate this with one example. Several days ago some people 
lined up the personnel of the Bosnian embassy in Zagreb and made 
a complete chaos, although the embassy staff worked in 
impossible conditions, and took care of the things they are not 
even supposed to take care of. Their office hours were until 
morning. I witnessed that myself. Those people even carried 
the wounded that had been literally unloaded at wee hours in 
front of the embassy. Those people are now disappointed and 
furious. Nobody is allowed any more to line up people and yell 
at them. Nobody is supposed to put up with somebody's 
frustrations caused by unrealized ambitions. Some people behave 
as if there has been too little fear, shelling, poverty, and 
suffering so far. Also, the work performed by the government 
cannot be depreciated any more, which is, unfortunately, done 
here, as well as abroad, nor is it necessary to prompt 
journalists to criticize the government, because they are 
capable of doing that themselves. Such an understanding of 
freedom, human dignity, politics, will not pass. Some damage 
may be done by such activities, but I repeat, all that is 
short-lived. Simply, people cannot and should not put up with 
that any longer. 
  [OSLOBODJENJE] Is the distribution of official posts a 
stumbling bloc for the further implementation of the 
Bosniak-Croatian agreement? 
  [Silajdzic] Whether the first president will be Bosniak or 
Croat was not agreed upon in Washington. The attitude of the 
Party of Democratic Action is well-known. If you want to know 
my personal attitude, then I have to tell you that, if there is 
a man who has really deserved that post, then it is President 
Izetbegovic. I think that by following that line a political 
agreement can be reached. There is a plenty of work to be done 
for anybody. However, a very difficult question is awaiting us 
in the future -- how to make it possible for the refugees to 
return to their homes. In solving that issue we shall need the 
help of the international community and the UNHCR. We shall 
also need aid of building materials, in order to develop any 
sort of housing program. That will be a greater problem than 
food supplies. We have to start any sort of production. 
  [OSLOBODJENJE] Both in wartime and in peacetime the public 
is interested in privileges that go along with power. What kind 
of apartment does the Bosnian prime minister live in? Did you 
use the priority right for being supplied with power? 
  [Silajdzic] Unfortunately, merits are already being 
rewarded, so that villas in Switzerland and apartments in Vienna 
are being dealt out. My 48 square meter apartment was not given 
to me either by the former or by the present administration. I 
earned it during my 10 years of working abroad, in order not to 
be driven to beg somebody for an apartment. That apartment is 
unfit for living for the time being, so I have been living at my 
sister's. I did not use the priority right for power. Until 
recently the neighborhood that I am living in was not supplied 
even with gas. We survived on firewood, just like our 
neighbors. If there is anything positive about this war, then I 
would say it is neighborly relations. Such relations have to be 
maintained. 
  [OSLOBODJENJE] While we were talking, the news on air 
strikes against Serb positions around Gorazde came in. There 
was no need to ask Silajdzic to comment on it, so this is his 
first reaction to the news: 
  [Silajdzic] Neither the air strikes in Gorazde nor the 
ultimatum to Serbs around Sarajevo came about as the result of a 
phone call. The people reached for their weapons and made 
possible for us to prove ourselves as a military factor in the 
first place, and thereafter as a political factor. It is the 
people who made possible for us to build our position on the 
vision of a free and democratic country. That is the way we 
made friends, as many as it is possible to make in politics. By 
following that way and sticking to our principles we shall 
maintain the positions that we have. To tell you the truth, I 
feel really amazed at the sight of a man in a trench filled with 
water up to his knees, who has only four bullets left to remain 
with on the front line. We have to care for such men, their 
families, and particularly for the families of the fallen, 
shehits [a Turkish word, denoting a man who fell for his 
country]. We, as the government, have done all we could. If it 
happens that the care for those people remains just a 
proclamation of the current, or any other government, I am sure 
that those who were able enough to stand up and defend their 
country will be able enough to speak up and demand their rights.

<F P=106> [Article by Gjorgji Ristevski: "Liberation From Myths and </F>
Illusions"] 
  [Text] Sofia, 27 April -- "I am very satisfied and it was 
not by pure chance when I said that the visit of President Kiro 
Gligorov to Bulgaria was of a historic nature. Not because it 
is the first official visit, but because it represents the end 
of a period in the relations between Macedonia [The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] and Bulgaria, and the 
beginning of a new one." At a news conference held yesterday 
afternoon, these were the words with which the President of the 
Republic of Bulgaria Zelyu Zhelev assessed the visit and the 
discussions held with President Gligorov. 
  "This is our fourth meeting and my feeling is that we can 
urge the promotion of relations between the two countries. The 
Republic of Macedonia, as an independent country, has proven to 
be a condition for the stability in the Balkans. Macedonia is 
opposed to any alliances or prominences, because they can lead 
to new divisions in the Balkans. The Balkans are mixed, so we 
must respect each other and must not allow constant repetitions 
of Balkan wars, which brought nothing good to any of the 
nations." This is how President Kiro Gligorov assessed his 
first official visit to Bulgaria at yesterday's news conference. 
  In front of hundreds of journalists, the two presidents 
answered a number of "ticklish" questions, such as what was the 
number of Bulgarians in Macedonia. President Kiro Gligorov 
replied that, according to the last census, around 3,000 persons 
declared themselves as Bulgarians, but Macedonia will soon have 
a census under an international control, and that it was in our 
own interest to know who lives in Macedonia and in what number. 
A similar question was asked of Bulgarian President Zhelyu 
Zhelev, to which he replied that according to the last census 
around 7,000 persons declared themselves Macedonians, and only 
600-700 did not state their mother tongue was Bulgarian. 
  There were several questions concerning the non-signed 
agreements between the two states. The dispute came out when 
Macedonia refused to sign the documents which said that the 
"documents will be signed in the official languages of the two 
states," because the Macedonian side considered it should be 
stated that the agreements would be signed in Macedonian and 
Bulgarian. 
  The documents are to be signed in the official languages of 
the Republic of Macedonia and the Republic of Bulgaria. 
Therefore, in two languages. "Our side insisted on accepting 
this formulation," President Zhelyu Zhelev said, adding that the 
languages are a reality and that there should be no obstacles in 
promoting the relations. 
  "If we think of a language in different formulations, it is 
a 
problem of great concern. We cannot sign anything that is not 
written in our own language, because the language is a part of 
the identity of a nation. We should not go back to the past, we 
should go to the reality instead, and the language in which the 
documents will be signed is one of the questions. I believe 
that democratic Bulgaria will soon take off that issue from the 
agenda," President Kiro Gligorov said. 
  After the afternoon news conference and the solemn farewell 
at the "Boyana" Residence, the two-day official visit of the 
Macedonian president to the Republic of Bulgaria was 
accomplished. In the morning President Gligorov visited the 
Embassy of the Republic of Macedonia in Sofia and held 
discussions with some Macedonian representatives in Sofia. 
  The working part of the visit continued also in the 
afternoon. President Gligorov met Mr. Evgeni Matinchev, deputy 
prime minister of the Republic of Bulgaria, with whom he 
discussed the agreements that are expected to be signed soon. 
First of all, the agreements are related to the railroad links 
between the two states, the economic and cultural cooperation 
between the two countries. On the other hand, according to the 
protocol, President Gligorov was supposed to meet Prime Minister 
Lyuben Berov; however, this visit was canceled due to sickness. 
After the discussions, the deputy prime minister and his wife 
organized lunch for the Macedonian president, and in the 
afternoon President Gligorov addressed the delegates of the 
Bulgarian National Assembly, which was broadcast by radio and 
television. The delegates and the numerous diplomatic 
representatives greeted the arrival of President Kiro Gligorov 
in the Parliament with loud applause. 
  After the introductory speech of the Bulgarian Chairman of 
Parliament Yordanov, President Gligorov addressed the Bulgarian 
parliamentarians. 
  "Today we all share the responsibility of taking history as 
a 
guide, and using our own and other people's experiences to the 
maximum. It is indispensable for us to learn the lesson about 
living our own lives, but all of us near each other. I firmly 
believe that the conscious commitment to coexistence and mutual 
confidence can be the key to peace and stability in the Balkans. 
It is particularly important to abide by the principles of 
respect for the existing borders between the states, of respect 
for the rights of minorities, and to solve all problems through 
political and peaceful means. We managed to contribute to peace 
and stability in the region. We are convinced it is of real 
interest to other nations, too, including the Bulgarian people 
and all the citizens of the Republic of Bulgaria," President 
Gligorov said. 
  In his speech Gligorov reviewed the infrastructural 
connection with the East-West axis. "We consider that action," 
Gligorov said, "for which purpose financial means from 
Macedonia, Bulgaria, Albania, Turkey and Italy have already been 
engaged, as an investment for the future and as an outline for 
the development of the whole region of southeast Europe." 
  Toward the end of his speech, Gligorov also reviewed the 
relations among the Balkan countries and nations. Recalling the 
historical complexity in their relations, Gligorov emphasized: 
``It is also filled with many conflicts and misunderstandings, 
often for and about Macedonia. 
  Unfortunately, some have still been maintained in some 
areas. However, some of the illusions covered with crust are 
being destroyed. We would like, and would be very happy, if 
that became the prevailing opinion in the Balkans, so as to 
liberate this region from the historical illnesses and myths 
once and for all. We must construct mutual confidence on a 
long-term and responsible basis as an indispensable premise for 
any agreement, as the key which will eliminate, on a long-term 
plan, all roots of conflicts and instability in the mutual 
relations throughout the region.'' 
<H5>  [Box, p 5] </H5>
<H5>  Reactions in the Bulgarian Media </H5>
  All Bulgarian newspapers and the radio and television of our 
eastern neighbor gave great publicity to the two-day official 
visit of Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov to Bulgaria. The 
distinguished STANDARD assessed yesterday that "Gligorov and 
Zhelev decided to put an end to the political dispute," 
explaining the importance of the information that the Macedonian 
president provoked a great interest not only with the Bulgarian 
and Macedonian journalists, but also with the numerous 
detachments of Greek and other foreign journalists following 
this visit. 
  Nearly all reports pointed out the "misunderstanding about 
the use of the languages" for which the Bulgarian side still 
claims that the interstate agreements should be signed in the 
"official languages of the two countries." The newspaper 24 
CHASA, with a large circulation, went farthest in assessing the 
visit of Kiro Gligorov to Sofia, saying: "The language scandal 
between the two countries continues."

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Gligorov: The Language Problem -- An </F>
Internal Question"] 
  [Text] "It is not our issue, it is their internal 
question," President Gligorov stated last night at the Skopje 
airport, upon his return from the two day official visit to 
Bulgaria, in his retrospective on the problem with the failure 
to sign any agreements because of the disputed formulation 
"Macedonian language." 
  "The Bulgarian Government made several remarks that will 
have 
to be reviewed by both sides, however, the problem is the 
formulation of the Macedonian language," said Gligorov. 
  "Our stance is clear -- the Macedonian language cannot be 
controversial and it is not up for negotiations. These are two 
completely different languages and I think that we will make 
some progress in further talks." 
  Gligorov feels that President Zhelev has an understanding 
for 
this matter, it is simply a reality that has to be accepted like 
any other reality.

  [Text] Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia 
-- FYROM] this week began charging two duties totaling 15 
percent on the bulk of Slovene imports: a 7.5-percent levy and a 
7.5-percent special duty designed to spread the tax burden. 
  The new duties apply to all classes of goods that make up 
Slovenia's most significant exports to Macedonia: 
  -- furniture and other wooden products, 
  -- poultry, 
  -- paper and cardboard, 
  -- tires, 
  -- washing powders, 
  -- cosmetics, 
  -- household appliances. 
  This effectively means that the bilateral free trade 
agreement signed in 1992 is no longer in force.

<F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>
  [Text] Knin, April 26 (TANJUG) -- UNPROFOR [UN Protection 
Forces] chief of staff in the sector south, Joseph Ngare, said 
on Tuesday that the two sides in conflict, the republic of Serb 
Krajina and Croatia, are observing the ceasefire and showing a 
readiness to continue to implement the agreement on the 
cessation of hostilities and the separation of forces signed in 
Zagreb at the end of March. 
  At a regular press conference, representatives of U.N. 
peace-keeping forces announced that UNPROFOR civilian police, 
4,200 of them, together with the peace-keepers of the republic 
of Serb Krajina started on Tuesday to patrol and enforce peace 
and order in settlements along the line of separation. 
  The republic of Serb Krajina was formed in 1991 in parts of 
the former Yugoslav Republic of Croatia settled by Serbs as 
their response to the forceable secession of the Zagreb regime 
from the former federation and is under U.N. Protection (UNPA) 
since March 1992. 
  U.N. observers in sector south warned this time once again 
about the great danger of mines placed during the withdrawal of 
the forces in conflict or left behind earlier, but the 
representative of the sector for information, Alan Roberst, was 
not able to say which side had done that. 
  The mines removing operations are progressing slowly since 
the Croatian side, unlike the Serb, has not yet made available 
the exact data, maps and plans about the mine fields. 
  Two Krajina Serb army troops lost their lives, while four 
were wounded by mine explosions last weekend when they were 
visiting their village. Last week, two Canadian battalion 
members within UNPROFOR were also wounded. 
  These are the main reasons why the return of local 
inhabitants to settlements where military opoerations have been 
going on until recently is still banned. 
  The headquarters of the Serb Krajina army announced that the 
Croatian Army violated on Monday the ceasefire agreement and 
opened fire from small arms towards the zone of responsibility 
of the Lika corps in the wider Kapela area.

  [Text] Croatian Assembly President Stipe Mesic and a group 
of deputies have received a delegation of the Duma, the lower 
house of the Russian parliament. The delegation was headed by 
Kostantin Zatulin, president of this house's committee for 
cooperation with fellow nationals. Our Andjelko Perincic was 
among the reporters who attended one part of this meeting. 
  [Perincic] At the start, Zatulin said that the deputies to 
Russia's Duma are concerned about the situation in the area of 
the former Yugoslavia, so at their last session they voted for a 
decision to urgently send their delegation to our region where 
they could talk about how the warring parties view solutions to 
the crisis. He also told his hosts that his delegation has 
already visited Knin, Belgrade, and Vukovar. They will visit 
Pale, too, he said. He cited the official titles of these 
unrecognized state entities such as the Srpska republic and the 
even more self-styled republic of Serb Krajina. In his reply 
Assembly President Stipe Mesic explained in detail the history 
and causes of the collapse of the Versailles Yugoslavia and the 
breakdown of the socialist federation which Tito had taken to 
the threshold of a confederal state, especially by the 
constitution of 20 years ago. 
  The conflict, instigated by Serbia in pursuit of its 
territorial ambitions, with weaponry belonging to the common 
federation of the past, can only be resolved by using force, by 
meeting force with greater force, as the aggressor does not want 
negotiations, Mesic said. It is also of essential importance 
for the world to restore the fundamental principles of the 
inviolability of borders. He also criticized the Greater Serbia 
theory -- according to which all Serbians should live in a 
single state -- by raising the following counterquestion: What 
would happen if the same demands were to be raised by Russians, 
Hungarians, Germans, and other peoples? He also added that 
there would have been no war had the world thwarted Serbian 
aggression by greater force before Vukovar. 
  The head of Russia's lower house of parliament first 
demanded 
that the meeting should continue without the presence of the 
press, so reporters were forced to leave the talks following 
these demands.

    [Editorial Report] The following reports on economic 
developments in the Republic of Croatia are from periodicals 
published in the republic. 
<H5>  Exclusive Residences of Croatia's `New Ruling Class' </H5>
  Although the "most attractive land" in the northern part of 
Zagreb costs as much as 4,500 German marks [DM] per square meter 
and building permits alone cost as much as DM200,000, 
businessmen and politicians are "rushing" to buy them and are 
building more and more expensive villas and even castles. The 
Zagreb weekly GLOBUS on 18 March reports in an article entitled 
"Northern Zagreb: Forbidden City of Croatia's New Ruling Class" 
that Zagreb's elite housing zones are in Prekrizje, Pantovcek, 
Zelengaj, Cmrok, Tuskanac, and Salata. According to the weekly, 
Mario Pleic, who claims to be working in state security, is 
building a residence worth DM4,000,000 in Pantovcek, without a 
valid permit. The family of the automobile transporter 
Vuckovic, in Gornje Prekrizje No. 55, bought one of the most 
beautiful villas in the northern part of the city, with a 
luxurious swimming pool. In Zelengaj, Stjepan Pecevski, deputy 
minister of internal affairs, became the owner of a 
93-square-meter residence, and Milan Brezak, a "high official" 
in the Interior Ministry, and Perica Juric, one of the founders 
of the ruling Croatian Democratic Community (HDZ) and an 
assembly representative, each bought a 112-square-meter 
residence. GLOBUS lists numerous other politicians and 
businessmen who have purchased luxurious properties in northern 
Zagreb and mentions a new "interesting" construction that has 
"sprouted up" in Prekrizje: a "real castle with towers and 
arches" whose owner remains unknown. 
<H5>  Rijeka Shipyard Sells Ship to Private Purchaser </H5>
  A Rijeka resident of Herzegovinian origin, Jure Kutle, until 
recently an oil-tanker captain, has purchased a ship, the Sv. 
Antun Padovanski (St. Anthony of Padua), from the 3 Maj Shipyard 
in Rijeka for $45 million, becoming the biggest private 
shipowner in Croatia. In an interview he gave while "surrounded 
by bodyguards" that was published in the 18 March issue of 
GLOBUS, Kutle states that the ship will most probably be sailing 
under the Liberian flag because Croatian taxes are too high. He 
told GLOBUS that he is also in the process of founding the Kutle 
Line shipping company. He worked as an oil-tanker captain for 
30 years, GLOBUS reports, and, "thanks to lucrative 
investments," he has "enough money to buy several ships." 
<H5>  Zagreb Construction Firm Taking Over Split Partner </H5>
  The Zagreb firm Montmontaza, which specializes in the 
construction and equipping of petroleum and petrochemical 
processing plants and petroleum terminals and pipelines, 
recently bought 25 percent of the shares of the largest Split 
construction company, Lavcevic, for DM11,800,000, according to 
the 13 April Split daily SLOBODNA DALMACIJA. Montmontaza 
Director Ivica Nuic told the daily that Montmontaza had 
previously purchased 12.7 percent of Lavcevic's shares from 
pension funds and a further 8 to 10 percent from small 
shareholders. An agreement has been made for the purchase of 
another 4.3 percent of shares from the Split bank, so that 
Montmontaza has become the majority shareholder in Lavcevic. 
Nuic says that his company bought the Lavcevic shares "to 
protect its interests," since the two firms are working together 
on a long-term project in Kazakhstan valued at $43 million. 
Montmontaza will try to buy all the remaining Lavcevic shares 
except the two blocks that are not for sale: the 6.2 percent 
that belongs to the Republic of Croatia and the 7.3 percent 
reserved for owner restitution. 
<H5>  Record Share Sale by Privatization Fund </H5>
  At a 7 April public auction conducted by the Croatian 
Privatization Fund at the Zagreb stock exchange, 25,479 shares 
of two enterprises were sold for a total of approximately 
DM2,548,000, or 9.35 billion Croatian dinars. The value of the 
transactions represents a one-day record for this year. The 8 
April issue of SLOBODNA DALMACIJA reports that the bulk of the 
trading consisted of the "Kapital Trade" brokerage firm's 
purchase of 25,421 shares of stock in the Split confectioner 
"Bobis" for DM2,542,000. The remainder was accounted for by the 
"Investco" company's acquisition of 58 shares of the "Croatia 
Auto" firm of Zagreb for DM5,800. Thus, total trade in 14 
regular auctions conducted by the Croatian Privatization Fund 
this year has amounted to about DM6.8 million, which represents 
about 49,000 shares in 27 enterprises, the daily says.

  [Text] Our reporter at the National Assembly, Antoaneta 
Kuncheva, briefly summarizes what has happened so far at the 
National Assembly session, including the declaration on the 
government's intentions read by Prime Minister Lyuben Berov. 
  [Kuncheva] Prime Minister Berov kept his promise and 
addressed the National Assembly. However, he did not present a 
draft of structural changes but instead read a declaration on 
the future intentions of the government. The declaration 
contained promises on updating the government's program and 
adopting measures aimed at stabilizing the country in the 
economic and social spheres, and also something that resembled 
an explanation of the need to effect changes in the posts of 
deputy prime ministers and in the leaderships of the Ministry of 
Defense and the Ministry of Trade. 
  An urgent meeting of the National Assembly Council is 
discussing at present whether it is admissible to open a 
parliamentary debate on the prime minister's declaration and 
whether this conforms to National Assembly regulations.

<F P=106> [Interview with Gabor Kuncze, prime ministerial candidate of </F>
the Alliance of Free Democrats, by Dezso Pinter; place and date 
not given: "I Am Seeking the Conditions for a Balanced 
Coalition"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Pinter] What do you think 
of the view that to take on a governmental role automatically 
means the end for a liberal party because it is only possible to 
draw up and properly construct a liberal ideology in opposition? 
  [Kuncze] I do not believe that the government's role is to 
create ideologies, at least, it will not be the task of the 
government led by the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ]. In my 
view, the electors are expecting us to put the economy in order 
at last. The SZDSZ and the other liberal parties have the 
necessary program to do this. Therefore, if we form a 
government, this will mean the end of something else, namely of 
the unfounded accusations. 
  [Pinter] In your view, to what extent have the parties of 
the liberal alliance remained together? 
  [Kuncze] A cooperation agreement is in force between the 
SZDSZ, the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz], the Liberal 
Civic Alliance-Entrepreneurs' Party, and the Agrarian 
Federation, which does not actually cement these parties 
together but makes it likely that these parties wish to work 
together even in the period after the elections. However, it is 
still possible that a liberal party may not participate in a 
possible government coalition even if its election results made 
it eligible for government. [passage omitted] 
  [Pinter] Many people see the intention of the SZDSZ and the 
Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] to participate in the same 
government coalition as a fact. Is this justified? 
  [Kuncze] The MSZP's economic policy carries Laszlo Bekesi's 
name, however, even the MSZP's current leadership cannot tell 
whether this concept will be accepted by the majority of the 
MSZP's membership and the future parliamentary group. If it is 
not accepted then we have nothing to talk about. We have to 
wait for the final results of the elections, and we have to see 
to what extent the various parties are able to assert their 
ideas in the coalition talks. [passage omitted] 
  [Pinter] To what extent can the voters view the SZDSZ's 
ideas that have so far been made public as a government program? 
  [Kuncze] We are disseminating a version of the program that 
is easy to understand, so it is accessible for everyone. On the 
last page of our election program, we printed the following: 
"Keep this booklet because you will be able to question the 
SZDSZ's politicians on whether they have implemented what they 
promised." If we did not honestly believe that we could 
implement our plans when we are in government then we would not 
have written this sentence here. We assessed the tasks months 
ago, and we now precisely know what the first measures will have 
to be in governmental position. The first draft bills will soon 
be ready, we are now working on the texts. We also know what 
kind of amendments we will propose in the operation of 
Parliament and the government. [passage omitted] 
  [Pinter] In your personal experience, what changes do the 
SZDSZ sympathizers expect you to introduce? 
  [Kuncze] People are very well aware that we are facing 
difficult years to come and a real economic boom still has to 
wait. Therefore, first of all, they want honesty and sincerity 
from the politicians. They want to be treated as human beings, 
and they want their problems to be understood, in other words, 
the country first of all wants a change of style: a new style 
of politics, a new style in building relations with society, a 
new style in cooperation with the opposition, and a new style in 
the mechanisms of interest coordination. The electors expect 
the establishment of new workplaces to be at the forefront in 
the implementation of the economic policy, and we agree with 
this: Our proposals to increase investments, to attract more 
foreign capital, and to accelerate privatization are aimed at 
this goal. It is possible to establish the conditions for 
economic growth and this will be the basis for increasing living 
standards. 
  Both the SZDSZ and the electors believe that the 
relationship 
between the government and the local governments has to be 
changed. We have to recognize the fact that everyone is living 
in a local government area. The operation of the local 
governments largely influences people's feelings about living in 
this country. The government and the local governments should 
be working by assisting each other, rather than opposing each 
other. We also want to implement in other areas, too, the kind 
of politics where antagonism decreases and cooperation increases. 
  [Pinter] These goals are impossible to implement without a 
broad political consensus. Can you see any chance of this? 
  [Kuncze] Yes, under an SZDSZ government. The next 
government will even have to agree to limit its own sphere of 
operation if this can make the consensus more solid. We are 
prepared for this. [passage omitted] 
  [Pinter] The SZDSZ rejected with visible annoyance the idea 
that the elections will actually be decided by a duel between 
the MSZP and the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF]. Has your 
protest had any effect? 
  [Kuncze] These two parties are playing the game of 
strengthening each other. Everyone who does not like the MDF 
should go to the MSZP and everyone who is afraid of the MSZP 
should support the MDF. Through this, the two parties show what 
they are most afraid of. Their claims are not true on the basic 
level of facts, either. As for [Prime Minister] Boross's 
statement that they are still in the competition, it is 
contradicted by all public opinion polls. The electors have 
long decided who has to leave. The question is, who should 
come. I am certain that the electors do not just want to swap 
their tulips for carnations [the MDF and MSZP symbols] and keep 
all else the same. I am seeking the conditions for a balanced 
coalition. However, we will not achieve any change if the MSZP 
becomes very strong. 
  The MDF's fate shows that the electors did not like the 
concealed one-party system any more than the open one before. 
This is why we are asking the electors to vote for us. A 
strong SZDSZ is a guarantee that the practice of the past four 
years will not be continued and, at the same time, there will 
not be a return to the practice of the past four decades, either. 
  [Pinter] The SZDSZ has a completely different attitude to 
the Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP]. What is this to 
indicate? 
  [Kuncze] The SZDSZ is an party open to all democratic 
directions, therefore, we have not excluded the possibility of 
cooperation with the KDNP, either. However, we are not 
conducting talks with the KDNP to strengthen our relations.

  [Text] [Announcer Dorota Warakomska] Defense Minister Piotr 
Kolodziejdzyk has addressed the prime minister with a request 
for the nomination of Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] Deputy 
Danuta Waniek as deputy minister in his ministry. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] The head of the defense 
ministry 
called the candidature of Danuta Waniek a promising one. 
  [Begin Defense Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk recording] This 
is a person who has a good legal preparation, with significant 
experience, and parliamentary experience, too. I judge that she 
will cope excellently with the fundamental issues that will be 
in the sphere of her responsibility. At issue here are the 
legislative processes that are so very important for the Army 
and for its reform and that have been so consistently neglected 
over these past few years. [end recording] 
  [Correspondent] Danuta Waniek is the first person proposed 
by 
the SLD for a post of deputy minister in a presidential ministry 
and accepted by the head of the ministry in question. The 
president, despite his earlier opposition, expressed consent, 
after the Wednesday meeting with the SLD Parliamentary Club, for 
the introduction of representatives of the coalition into the 
Defense Ministry, the Foreign Ministry, and the Ministry of 
Internal Affairs. 
  SLD Deputy Zbigniew Sobotka is being named as the most 
serious candidate for deputy minister of internal affairs, 
whereas Marek Siwiec, a member of the National Radio and 
Television Broadcasting Council [and also the editor in chief of 
the TRYBUNA daily and a SLD deputy], is being nominated for 
deputy foreign minister.

  [Text] Belgrade, April 26 (TANJUG) -- Representatives of 
the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) said on Tuesday 
evening that Bosnian Serb forces have withdrawn their heavy 
weapons to outside a 20km zone from the inner core of Gorazde, 
as provided for under the NATO ultimatum, and that there is no 
longer a threat of air strikes against their positions. Gorazde 
is a Moslem enclave in the east of civil war-torn 
Bosnia-Herzegovina where Serb and Moslem forces clashed heavily 
for almost a month. The NATO Council threatened it would bomb 
Bosnian Serb positions unless they withdrew their heavy weapons 
to a distance of 20km from the center of Gorazde by 00:01 GMT 
Wednesday. 
  The UNPROFOR representatives in Sarajevo declined to specify 
if all Serb heavy weapons had been withdrawn from the area, but 
said that there was no longer a threat of air strikes. 
Confirming this, U.N. Spokesman Eric Chaperon said that the 
U.N. force commander for Bosnia-Herzegovina, General Michael 
Rose was going to bed. Chaperon also said that Moslems had 
fired at an UNPROFOR patrol which was checking the Serb 
positions in the vicinity of Gorazde. There were no casualties, 
he said, but a protest has been sent to the Moslem authorities.

  [Text] Bratunac, April 27 (TANJUG) -- Moslems on Wednesday 
opened fire from anti-aircraft machineguns, infantry weapons and 
snipers on Serb parts of Sarajevo before the very eyes of the 
United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR), the Bosnian Serb 
Army said in a statement. The targets of artillery and infantry 
fire on Wednesday were also Serb villages and Army positions in 
the areas of Konjic south of Sarajevo, Srbobran (formerly Donji 
Vakuf), Olovo and Kladanj in central Bosnia, Orasje, Doboj, 
Gradacac, Brcko, Teslic and Mount Vlasic in northern Bosnia, 
Mount Majevica in north-eastern Bosnia and Bihac in western 
Bosnia, the statement said. 
  The Bosnian Serb Army on Wednesday neutralized a Moslem 
terrorist group in the area of Bihac, it added. Moslem attacks 
on the almost entire territory of the Serb Republic in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina continues at a time when the Serb side is 
proposing a general ceasefire in the war-ravaged former Yugoslav 
Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the statement said. 
  In the night between Tuesday and Wednesday, the Serb and 
Moslem sides exchanged prisoners, civilians and the bodies of 
killed fighters in the vicinity of Bihac. The exchange was 
carried out on an "all-for-all" principle and in the presence of 
UNPROFOR monitors, the Bosnian Serb Army said. The Moslem side 
handed over four prisoners, 12 civilians and six bodies of 
killed soldiers and the Serb side four prisoners, nine civilians 
and eight bodies of killed fighters, the statement said.

<F P=106> [Report by Mirko Sajler: "The Serbs Are Preparing To Conquer </F>
Bosnian Posavina"] 
  [Text] Osijek -- Vice president of the Croatian People's 
Party and member of parliament Ivica Vrkic has sent another open 
letter to Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Mate Granic 
warning him of possible new "war games" of the Bosnian Serbs, 
and plans in connection with Croatian territories. Vrkic's 
claims are at the same time interesting and frightening. 
Precisely because things might well turn out the way Vrkic 
predicts, we carry the letter in full: 
  ``Mr. Granic! 
  ``Prompted by the latest events around Gorazde, and in the 
interest of protecting the Croatian state interests, I propose 
that your government draft and submit to the UN Security Council 
a proposal suggesting the passing of a special decision -- 
resolution -- that would expand the area of protected zones in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina to include Bosnian Posavina, or more 
precisely, the free enclave around Orasje. 
  ``It is more than obvious that the Serbs intend to expand 
their corridor in Bosnian Posavina militarily (their generals 
discuss this openly) and are bringing in large quantities of 
heavy arms in order to carry out preparations for the final 
conquest of all of Posavina. This game includes sporadic attacks 
on Zupanja and the region along the Sava River on the Croatian 
side, aimed at provoking the Croatian Army, which would give the 
Serbs an alibi for the final assault on the free territory of 
Posavina. 
  ``Our government's proposal, together with one 
simultaneously 
submitted to the UN Security Council by the Bosnian Government, 
would reveal the goal of the Bosnian Serbs in time. If the 
Security Council were to accept the initiative proclaiming a 
protected zone around Bosnian Posavina (the enclave of Orasje), 
this would prevent the Serbs from carrying out their plans and 
conquering Posavina until the Security Council, the European 
Union, the United States, and Russia agree on how to protect 
Croatia and the Bosniaks from the Serbian onslaught. 
  ``The loss of Posavina would not only mean the loss of 
territory populated by Croats, it would also be free territory 
through which the Serbs could unite Serbs in the occupied 
Croatian and Bosnian areas with Serbia. The loss would moreover 
result in a new wave of refugees in Croatia, which is further 
reason for alerting the relevant factors in international 
politics,'' reads Ivica Vrkic's letter addressed to Mate Granic.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Ylli Rakipi: "We Should Tell Greece </F>
Everything We Think"] 
  [Text] "When you shake hands with a Greek," as the English 
saying goes, "you need to count your fingers afterwards." Given 
that such words come from a distant island, one can imagine what 
the Albanians have to say about their ancient neighbor -- a 
neighbor who historically has only thought about how to tear his 
neighbor to pieces! Lately, particularly now, the Hellenic 
nature has become more cruel and is being manifested to its full 
extent. It has been proclaimed on the pages of newspapers and 
at mass rallies, from congress rostrums and in diplomatic 
corridors, at paramilitary commando camps and at holy altars. 
In all these places the Hellenic nature shrieks. 
  The term "Greek chauvinist circles" is by now outdated. The 
term "certain circles" is also lackluster. The madness of the 
senile Sebastiano [ethnic Greek head of the Albanian Orthodox 
church] can no longer be called simply madness. The 
anti-Albanian activities of the criminal Omonia organization, 
the killing of Albanians while they sleep in the night or by a 
stab in the back; the maltreatment of the Albanian refugees -- 
all these and other reported or unreported things show that the 
efforts to Hellenize Albania have become Greek state policy. 
Hundreds of anti-Albanian bulletins, books, maps, and calendars 
are being published. Dozens of mass protest rallies are being 
staged to call for the liberation of Vorio-Epirus. All these 
things are taking place in Greece, but the Greek Government 
claims to know nothing about them. The holy Greek state denies 
any responsibility for the paramilitary groups who cross the 
border to kill Albanians at night (as if they were not soldiers, 
but a cloud of rain passing from Greece into Albania). The Greek 
state knows nothing and disclaims any responsibility for what is 
going on and what is being engineered in Greece against Albania 
and the Albanians. 
  However, does the Greek state know what the 50,000 pampered 
Albanian Greeks are doing in Albania? Or what the Omonia people 
and the men of God, the priests, are doing? Even these things 
are not known to the Greek state. It happens perhaps because 
governing the European Community has given great problems and 
concerns to the Greek state! 
  Let us then remind the very busy Greek state that a good 
part 
of the Greek minority in Albania, who are coddled by the 
Albanian state and people, illegally distribute their books, 
bulletins, appeals, and calendars, all calling for Vorio-Epirus 
to be liberated. Let the Greek statesmen know that Omonia is a 
criminal organization that pursues anticonstitutional and 
anti-Albanian activities! Let them learn that the angels of the 
Orthodox church in Albania want it to be a solely Greek Church! 
All these things must be taught to the Greek statesmen. They 
must be taught, although they are already aware of such things. 
First and foremost they must be taught that the 40-50,000 Greek 
immigrants who came to Albania to earn a crust of bread can 
never Hellenize this country. 
  "When you shake hands with a Greek, count your fingers 
afterward," as the English say.

<F P=106> [Article by Peter Javurek: "Zhirinovskiy Is To Visit the </F>
Slovak Republic in May"] 
  [Text] Bratislava--Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, the leader of the 
Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, will probably come to 
Slovakia on 14 or 15 May. A LIDOVE NOVINY reporter has found out 
that he should stay in the West-Club in Bratislava's Kamzik 
Restaurant as a private person. Staff from the West-Club 
confirmed this information to LIDOVE NOVINY. They added that the 
Russian ultranationalist will probably be in Bratislava for two 
days, but his program is not known. It is clear from another 
source that the owner of the West-Club invited Zhirinovskiy to 
make the private visit. 
  Last week, representatives from the extraparliamentary 
Liberal Party protested against Zhirinovskiy's forthcoming 
visit. Zhirinovskiy was originally supposed to come to Slovakia 
in April. He apologized later, saying he was "too busy." 
Liberal Party Executive Secretary Pavol Weiss met last week 
with Slovak National Party (SNS) First Deputy Chairman Juraj 
Molnar in one of Bratislava's cafes. The meeting, which had been 
instigated by the SNS representative, ended in a physical 
incident. 
  According to P. Weiss, Molnar, who recently took part in the 
"Pan-Slavic congress" organized by Zhirinovskiy's party in 
Moscow, tried to convince him of the need for a "Pan-Slavic 
union," in which Slovakia would cease to exist, and of the need 
for a party like V. Zhirinovskiy's Liberal Democratic Party. 
According to the liberals, Molnar even said frankly to Weiss 
that the Slovaks "will lick the boots of Russian soldiers." P. 
Weiss ended the conversation by physically assaulting Molnar in 
front of witnesses. In the meantime, the liberals have submitted 
a request to the Interior Ministry asking it not to allow 
Zhirinovskiy to visit Slovakia.

<F P=106> ["Excerpts" from speech delivered by Jozef Moravcik at the </F>
Constituent Assembly of the Democratic Union of Slovakia (DEUS) 
in Bratislava on 23 April, "shortly after his election as DEUS 
chairman": "Political Culture Influences Stability"] 
  [Text] This period is also important from the viewpoint of 
what style of politics and government will be established in 
Slovakia. The standard of political culture also has an impact 
on stability. We have had negative experience in this respect. 
We know that a confrontational style and the search for an enemy 
at any price do not suit us because they lead to political 
crises. We should, by our own conduct, create a positive image 
of the style of exercising political power. 
  Among the problems that upset our citizens and make their 
lives unpleasant are growing crime, vandalism, corruption, and a 
general deterioration of interpersonal relations. I realize that 
our situation in this field is not too critical when we compare 
it with countries we tend to consider stable and prosperous. In 
spite of this, I am convinced that we must take steps to stave 
off such negative phenomena. We must now allow what I recently 
heard from one foreign visitor to become a permanent truth: 
"You have an interesting country, we feel good here, but what 
puzzles us are the grim and sad faces of your people." In 
short, we must see to it that contentment and smiles return to 
the faces of our citizens. 
  A special problem is the impartiality and nonpartisanship of 
state administration staff. To secure the stability of state 
administration staff, this staff must inevitably be above party 
affairs. We must not hesitate any longer in this regard. It is 
necessary to prepare and introduce within a short period of time 
a law on civil servants that would bring about the needed 
stability in this sensitive sphere of state administration. 
  It is difficult to speak about the stability of the state 
administration, however, when we are not even clear about its 
structural changes. These, too, are unavoidable. We realize that 
the present structure of state administration bodies leads to 
the persecution of citizens by the bureaucracy. 
  The large degree of redistribution of resources through the 
state budget, particularly in the sphere of health care and 
education, creates tension on the revenue side. This tension can 
be eliminated by increasing either revenue or the deficit. A 
higher deficit means living at the expense of the future, 
however. Dilemmas of this kind are characteristic of the 
present. We cannot waste time pondering them. It is necessary to 
take vigorous action also in this regard. This means more 
private initiative in education and health care. Savings in 
these areas will allow us to reduce the tax burden of, in 
particular, entrepreneurs, allowing them to devote more 
resources to the development of business. 
  It seems that the entrepreneurs' present tax burden exceeds 
the critical mass of tolerability. It is evident that this 
excessively heavy burden erodes the psychological barrier 
against tax evasion and other forms of tax fraud. When we deduct 
from taxes tax evasions of this kind, the actual tax burden is 
lower. It would be far more effective if the formal tax burden 
matched the actual burden, leaving aside the fact that such 
criminal elements in the economy corrupt the social atmosphere. 
  A sore point of Slovak economic policy is support for small 
and medium-sized businesses. There exists a mass of documents 
approved by various governments reflecting the endeavor to find 
a way of giving support to this form of enterprise. In spite of 
this, we still owe much to small and medium-sized businessmen. 
We must start eliminating this debt as soon as possible. 
  Our integration into European and transatlantic structures 
is 
not free of problems. It is taking place at a time when a new 
model of European cooperation and a new architecture of European 
security are being sought. In the same way that we are 
interested in the borders of the zone of stability and 
prosperity not ending at our western border, we must be 
interested in having democratic and stable partners to the east 
of our republic. We set particularly great store in good 
relations with Ukraine and the Russian Federation. 
  Our immediate task is to contribute to the stability of 
Central Europe. I think Slovak-Hungarian relations represent the 
greatest liability in this respect. It needs to be stressed that 
this liability rests on both sides. This liability, which is a 
liability of the two countries' governments not only toward 
their citizens but also toward the expectations of the entire 
democratic Europe, must be settled as soon as possible. A 
condition for this is the establishment of an atmosphere of 
mutual trust. In other words, we must get rid of mutual 
distrust. This requires, among other things, the resumption of 
dialogue at various levels of state representation, including 
the highest level.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Slovak President Michal Kovac by </F>
correspondent Ildiko Nagy in Bratislava; date not given; from 
the "Extra" program--recorded; Kovac speaks in Slovak with 
superimposed translation into Hungarian] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Nagy] From the viewpoint of 
the development of good-neighborly relations, which tasks do you 
consider the most timely in Slovak-Hungarian relations? 
  [Kovac] I believe that what both sides consider the most 
important is that we should put an end to mutual accusations and 
mistrust between the Slovak Republic and the Hungarian Republic 
as soon as possible. This is the basic condition for our being 
able to develop cultural and economic relations at the level of 
the various organizations, institutions, and citizens as well. 
So, the elimination of mistrust is at the top of the list, and 
every step promoting this is given priority. I believe that the 
signing of the basic treaty that lays down good-neighborly 
relations is included in this. The principle of the 
inviolability of the borders has to be laid down just as that of 
the political solution of issues affecting the national 
minorities. If we manage to achieve this, then afterward what 
we must strive for is to remove gradually from people's 
consciousness the suspicion and mistrust inherited from the past. 
  Once the basic conditions have been created for shaping a 
new 
type of relations, enormous possibilities will open up before 
us--first and foremost in cross-border cooperation, which is by 
no means at the level made desirable by the economic, cultural, 
and technical endowments and requirements of the region's 
inhabitants. 
  [Nagy] During their visit to Bratislava last week, Gabor 
Kuncze [head of the parliamentary group of opposition Alliance 
of Free Democrats] and, before that, Gyula Horn [chairman of the 
opposition Hungarian Socialist Party], also, spoke 
optimistically about the future development of Slovak-Hungarian 
relations. Jozef Moravcik, the Slovak head of government, also 
sees a chance for improvement. Do you share this opinion? 
  [Kovac] Yes, I support this opinion. And I trust that, in 
the election campaigns, the so-called Slovak and Hungarian cards 
will become superfluous--in other words, that it will not be 
possible to play these against each other. On the contrary, it 
will become apparent that the most rational way to resolve 
issues is to approach them in a sober, objective manner, without 
suspicion, be it a question of Gabcikovo, water distribution, 
the legal status of national minorities, or anything else--in 
other words, that everything can be resolved if it is not 
unnecessarily overpoliticized. 
  Incidentally, I consider this to be a sickness that has 
raised its head not just in our country but elsewhere, too. It 
is obviously connected with the fact that real democracy in our 
region is still only in the developmental phase, the political 
situation has not yet settled down, and an unnecessarily large 
number of issues are brought onto the political level as if they 
were trying to forge capital for themselves from this. 
  But I also see signs of the opposite of this: the effort to 
try to remove obstacles from the path of our relations. I 
consider looking to the future the important thing, and to make 
people aware that European integration is an attractive 
objective for which it is worth working with joint forces so as 
to achieve it more quickly. 
  [Nagy] Mr. President, if I am not mistaken, you managed to 
find the common note a long time ago with Hungarian President 
Arpad Goncz. You mentioned that, in the course of your earlier 
meetings, too, you had managed to get attuned. 
  [Kovac] Yes, that is so. This has shown that the presidents 
of republics, who are infrequently dragged into daily 
politicizing, look at events from above. Their hands are not 
tied, and they can express an opinion without prejudice, without 
ulterior motives, about certain issues. This is what we need: 
that this approach should pass down from the president's level 
to the executive power level. I do not doubt that this will 
happen because, also in Hungary and here, too, we have already 
taken steps in a direction serving the aim of depoliticizing. 
Once people's everyday interests come to the forefront, that 
will bring with it the necessity of sober solutions. 
  [Nagy] In your view, what role can the minorities play in 
the 
shaping of bilateral relations? I am thinking, in our case, of 
the Slovaks living in Hungary and of the Hungarians living in 
Slovakia. 
  [Kovac] In general terms, it can be said--and this relates 
to 
both the Hungarian and the Slovak situation--that it is in the 
interest of every country to create for its minorities 
conditions in which they can feel at home, so that they will 
strive, in their own interest, to integrate and become fully 
valuable members of the given society, while being able to 
retain their particular characteristics, their language, their 
culture, their traditions, while being given the possibility to 
study in their mother tongue. However, it is a general interest 
that the use of the mother tongue should not impede the minority 
in becoming integrated in society and the individual in getting 
on. We must change this outlook, which still lives on, that a 
minority means nothing but trouble for a country. We must 
reinforce the view that it can also mean richness. So far, we 
have done little to achieve this, but perhaps not only in 
relation to Hungary and Slovakia. Elsewhere, too, what people 
see is the disadvantages of the minorities issue rather than the 
richness the minorities represent for a country from the 
viewpoint of culture, of the multicolored mix of languages. 
  We have not sufficiently weighed the possibility of making 
use of this opportunity provided by the minorities for the 
purpose of getting closer to our neighbors, in our case toward 
the south, making our relations closer with Hungary. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] Bratislava--The regular monitoring of public opinion 
in April 1994, conducted by the Slovak Republic's Statistical 
Office, mainly focused on the new Slovak Government headed by 
Josef Moravcik. It monitored the expectations of the citizens 
regarding the work of the new Cabinet and, at the same time, 
paid attention to President Kovac's address to parliament in 
March. We present a comparison between the trust of the people 
in the former and the current governments. 
<H5>  Trust in Meciar's Government in the First 10 Days of March </H5>
1994 
  A total of 34 percent trusted the government (11 percent 
trusted it fully, and 23 percent were inclined to trust it 
rather than distrust it). 
  A total of 55 percent did not trust the government (22 
percent were inclined to distrust it rather then trust it, and 
33 percent did not trust it at all). 
  A total of 11 percent did not know. 
<H5>  Trust in Moravcik's Government in the First 10 Days of April </H5>
1994 
  A total of 54 percent trusted the government (22 percent 
trusted it fully, and 32 percent were inclined to trust it 
rather than distrust it). 
  A total of 39 percent distrusted the government (22 percent 
were inclined to distrust it rather than trust it, and 17 
percent did not trust it at all). 
  A total of 7 percent did not know. 
  Trust in the current government Cabinet increases with the 
level of education (the government is trusted by 70 percent of 
people with a university education, 61 percent with a high 
school education, 53 percent with vocational training, and 46 
percent with only the basic education). Most entrepreneurs and 
employees have a favorable opinion of Moravcik's government, 
while workers and the unemployed have a less favorable opinion.

  [Text] Banska Bystrica--The Slovak National Party [SNS] is 
departing from the civic tendency declared at its Ruzomberok 
assembly by removing Article 5 from its articles and returning 
to an unequivocal national principle in accordance with its 
130-year tradition. This was announced by the SNS Central 
Council at its conference held in Banska Bystrica on Saturday 
[23 April]. SNS Chairman Jan Slota also said at a meeting with 
journalists that the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia and the 
Christian Social Union [KSU] are being taken into consideration 
as possible partners for a preelection coalition. The selection 
of the KSU for preelection cooperation will be influenced by the 
outcome of the KSU all-Slovak assembly following its session on 
1 May. The SNS intends to proceed in the elections as a force 
uniting Slovaks in South Slovakia and as the advocate of their 
interests. Slota is convinced that the nationally oriented 
parties and movements will win by a substantial majority in the 
elections.

  [Text] Belgrade, April 28 (TANJUG) - Radio Moscow said on 
Thursday [28 April] the current and future achievements of 
Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro) "are a guarantee of stability and 
peace in the entire territory of former Yugoslavia, a guarantee 
of the restoration of the legitimate rights of the Serbian 
people on the international scene." 
  In a broadcast monitored in Belgrade, Radio Moscow 
commentator Yuriy Bragin said this was why he understood the 
position currently being formed internationally about Belgrade's 
new role as the political and social factor which could play a 
positive role in the future in re-establishing goodneighbourly, 
partnership and friendship ties among the peoples of former 
Yugoslavia. 
  Commenting on the second anniversary of promulgating the 
constitution of the new Yugoslav state, Bragin said the past two 
years were marked by increasing pressure on Belgrade because the 
civil war in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina had not been ended. 
In late May 1992, the U.N. Security Council imposed tough 
sanctions on Yugoslavia for its alleged involvement in the civil 
war in neighbouring Bosnia-Herzegovina. Bragin said each time 
Belgrade sympathized with the Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the 
West, dissatisfied, tightened pressure on Yugoslavia, although 
Yugoslavia made it clear in a declaration made public two years 
ago that "it has no territorial claims to any of its neighbours." 
  With this, Yugoslavia has clearly shown that it honours the 
U.N. Charter and CSCE documents and consistently supports the 
principle of [word indistinct] nonuse of force in solving all 
oustanding issues, he said. 
  It is evident in practice that Yugoslavia is honouring all 
its obligations, that it has no territorial claims to any of the 
newly formed neighbouring countries, that it is constantly 
proposing new initiatives for a peaceful settlement of conflicts 
and that it is strictly abiding by the principle of avoiding 
force, Bragin explained. Bragin also said the plight caused by 
the international blockade did not cause chaos in Yugoslavia's 
political, economic and cultural life, but only consolidated its 
people and proved the vitality of the state organization. 
  The recently launched monetary reform has curbed the 
disastrous inflation, stabilized prices and revived production 
both industrial and agricultural production. The country goes 
on living despite the blockade. Sports competitions and 
exhibitions are organized, new books are promoted and new plays 
staged in theatres, Bragin said.

<F P=106> [Interview with General Radovan Radinovic by Slobodan </F>
Reljic; place and date not given: "Now or Never"] 
  [Text] General Radovan Radinovic (55) does not look like a 
pensioner. "That is how things go in the army and in the 
police. A new boss, a new team," he says. Since he retired in 
January 1994, he has been working for the Institute of Economy 
in Belgrade as a scientific adviser for military and strategic 
studies and research. He had for years taught military strategy 
at the War School. He came to the Institute from the Strategy 
Division of the Federal Defense Ministry, where he was division 
head. At the beginning of 1993, he was a member of Cosic's team 
at the Geneva negotiations. "I would like this interview to 
reflect my attitude that this is an historic chance for Serbia. 
What we did not succeed in achieving in 1918, we can achieve 
now. The price may be higher, but it should be paid. I visited 
Krajina, I visited every part of the front, I went to Bosnia, I 
spoke with people, and I really convinced myself that this is a 
historic struggle for the survival of the Serbian nation. If 
this chance is missed, we shall never have it again." 
  We then went back to the analysis of the present situation: 
"If we were to look just at Gorazde, it could not be said that 
it is a town of big strategic importance. At the moment, 
however, there are approximately 70,000 people there, maybe 
more. From the point of view of the constitution of a Muslim 
state in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is being supported 
by a new Turkish expansion toward the Balkans, toward "the belly 
of Europe," Gorazde is of exceptional importance. It is one of 
the most important points because it is a natural connection 
between Sandzak and Bosnia. 
  [Relic] You are speaking about its importance for the 
Muslims. What about the Serbs? 
  [Radinovic] It is important for us that the Muslims do not 
achieve their goal -- that is, that we cut the so-called green 
transversal. What is important for us is that the Yugoslav 
border toward the former Bosnia-Herzegovina be as safe as 
possible, and it will be safer if this part is in Serbian hands. 
  [Reljic] The Western press wrote that Gorazde, an island in 
the Serbian territory, would have fallen anyway, so they found 
it senseless to insist on a military solution. 
  [Radinovic] I can tell you that I never thought the original 
Serbian idea was to occupy Gorazde. On the contrary: The Serbs 
in the republic of Srpska of Bosnia-Herzegovina accepted that 
Gorazde should remain a UN protected area. The Serbs were, 
however, provoked by the Muslim offensive, supported by the 
international community and the announced military assistance, 
first of all by the United States. 
  [Reljic] Do the United States and Europe have a clear 
strategy for Bosnia or are they adapting themselves to changes? 
  [Radinovic] The rest of Yugoslavia was of strategic 
interest for neither the United States nor Europe. As a 
powerful state in the Balkans, Yugoslavia prevented the 
infiltration of new centers of power -- Germany, on the one 
hand, and Turkey, on the other. It was only a matter of time 
when it would come to a breakup of Yugoslavia. It can be said 
that they mostly did not have a clearly defined military and 
political strategy. I would say that their wish was to reshape 
the territory. The present crisis shows that Europe is not 
capable of controlling a situation on its territory. 
  [Reljic] Are you speaking about U.S. strategy? 
  [Radinovic] Yes. 
  [Reljic] What can the unfolding of events tell us about the 
U.S. strategy? There is the impression that NATO -- where the 
United States is the decisionmaker -- is behaving like the 
Yugoslav People's Army during the breakup of Yugoslavia. 
Politicians are in two minds and the army makes a funny 
impression. 
  [Radinovic] First of all, NATO wants to obtain a new 
legitimacy, which can be achieved if there are crises that 
cannot be solved without its participation. In the former 
Yugoslavia, however, NATO seems to be losing what it has gained 
so far, because it took part of one side in a civil war. This 
could be damaging not only for NATO but also for the United 
Nations. They have underestimated the civil war in the former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  [Reljic] Has their strategic interest been seriously 
affected? 
  [Radinovic] I would not say that this will affect their 
strategic interest, but they will have to adapt their behavior 
to the situation. First of all, they have decided to be the 
only judge, forgetting that Russia also has its legitimate right 
to require that the Yugoslav crisis be solved with its 
participation. There are historical, cultural, and other 
connections between Serbia and Russia, so even Russia is obliged 
to protect Serbian interests, at least to the extent to which 
the West and Islamic countries have been protecting the Croats 
and the Muslims. Apart from that, if Russia allows the Balkan 
crisis to be solved without its participation, it will give up 
its historic idea that Russia is and should be a big power, 
which started with Petar the Great and has lasted until the 
present day. 
  [Reljic] Apart from this emotional aspect and the opposition 
to the United States, does Russia have a concrete interest here? 
  [Radinovic] A minimum interest, which is the maximum needed 
in the present situation. I think that Russian interests are 
legitimate. 
  [Reljic] Why does it seem now that Karadzic is insisting 
on the plan made by the European Union? Is this only tactics or 
is this map also what the Serbs want? 
  [Radinovic] There are both elements in his behavior. I 
think it is politically wise and strategically favorable to find 
"cracks" in the clash of interests of superpowers. The European 
Union is trying to establish its strategic identity in 
Yugoslavia, but this seems to be a very difficult task. It is 
not homogeneous itself. It is dominated by Germany. Its 
strategic interest is to get access to the Adriatic and put 
Central Europe under control, which it seems to have achieved by 
the secession of Croatia and Slovenia, but I think this is only 
one of the German illusions. I wrote for a German newspaper 
that the present Croatia is rather a burden for Germany than a 
partner that could contribute to the materialization of German 
interests. It would be more productive for Germany if it tried 
to articulate its interests in the Balkans by reestablishing its 
relations with Serbia as the most powerful factor in the Balkans 
and a link with Asia. 
  [Reljic] This sounds logical, but why has no one entered an 
alliance with Serbia yet? 
  [Radinovic] Out of political prejudices, I think. Serbia's 
politics have been declared imperial because Serbia allegedly 
wants to create a Greater Serbia. Even if all the Serbian 
countries were united, this would not be a large state that 
could inspire fear in someone. There is no imperial behavior in 
the Serbian tradition. The achievement of the Serbian national 
interest is even inhibited by the fact that there is no imperial 
consciousness in Serbs. I think the European Union has realized 
this now and that Serbia will be respected in future. 
  [Reljic] At the beginning of 1993, you worked on the 
elaboration of the Geneva maps. What has changed in Bosnia 
since that time? 
  [Radinovic] These were great moments for the Yugoslav 
delegation and the delegation of the republic of Srpska, who 
tried to achieve national and political independence for the 
Serbian nation in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina. All 
international powers, on the other hand, tried to prevent this 
by splitting the ethnic Serbian territory into unconnected 
enclaves. There were very many controversial points: the right 
Una River bank, Posavina, northeast Herzegovina, Podrinje, 
Kupres, the Dubrovnik hinterland.... Unfortunately, these areas 
are still stumbling blocks in the partition issue. As far as 
intentions are concerned, very little has changed, but as far as 
facts are concerned, very much has changed. First of all, all 
these games and calculations have been eliminated because of the 
Serbian victory. The keys are: the military success, a 
consistent policy made by the republic of Srpska, and a fervent 
support from Serbia. 
  [Reljic] Does this mean the situation is more favorable now 
than at the beginning of 1993? 
  [Radinovic] Yes, I think it is. 
  [Reljic] How big is the danger that everything is returned 
to a more difficult position by an inconsiderate action? 
  [Radinovic] There is the risk of returning everything to the 
beginning. International powers are trying everything but, in 
the end, they will have to accept the real situation -- first of 
all, because this situation shows what has always belonged to 
the ethnic Serbian territory. 
  [Reljic] This can be criticized since some of the towns were 
not predominantly Serbian before the war, such as Brcko, 
Zvornik.... 
  [Radinovic] One thing has to be clear. A state cannot exist 
if certain conditions are not met, and one of them is the 
territorial connection between areas populated by a Serbian 
majority. It is certain that injustice will be done to some 
areas in the final partition, but this can be balanced by an 
exchange of territories. 
  [Reljic] How would you assess the strategic stability of 
newly established states in the former Yugoslavia: Croatia, the 
republic of Srpska, the republic of Serbian Krajina, and the 
still undefined Muslim territory? 
  [Radinovic] The strategic position of Croatia was very 
unfavorable before the war, too. This is a very elongated 
state; if we measured it, it would be more than 1,000 km long. 
Its depth does not exceed 10 km in places. Such states can 
hardly survive even if they had very amicable neighbors. The 
republic of Serbian Krajina is elongated and thus unfavorable, 
too. If you bear in mind though that Baranja, eastern 
Slavonija, and western Srem are adjacent to Serbia, the 
territory looks much better. 
  [Reljic] What about the republic of Srpska with its 
"Maslenica" at Brcko? 
  [Radinovic] This is the weakest strategic point the republic 
of Srpska has. This even more, since the newly established 
federation -- which I think can hardly survive -- threatens to 
cut the republic of Srpska into two parts. 
  [Reljic] Is the Muslim-Croatian federation a good solution 
from a strategical point of view? 
  [Radinovic] Several interests overlapped here. First of 
all, Croatia had to be saved from sanctions because of its 
direct involvement in the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Apart from 
that, Croatian military defeats in Central Bosnia had to be 
covered up. Everyone knows that regular Croatian units occupied 
a part of the republic of Srpska between Trebinje and Dubrovnik, 
that they are situated in central Bosnia and in western 
Herzegovina. Apart from that, the anti-Serbian coalition had to 
be strengthened. This was partially accomplished. Besides, the 
establishment of a pure Muslim state in Bosnia-Herzegovina had 
to be prevented. The completely wrong Croatian policy toward 
Bosnia-Herzegovina had to be improved. The weakest point in the 
Croatian political strategy is that it agreed to partition 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, because they practically gave up their old 
dream -- from Starcevic [19th century Croatian intellectual] 
through Pavelic [fascist leader of World War II Independent 
State of Croatia] to [Croatian President] Tudjman -- that 
Croatia should reach the Drina and the Danube. The creation of 
the Croatian-Muslim federation has a political and strategic 
function because it will give Croatia the necessary depth of the 
territory. 
  [Reljic] Why did the Muslims accept this link with Croatia? 
  [Radinovic] The United States exerted pressure on the 
Muslims. The federation is not favorable for the Muslims, since 
they had almost won the war in Central Bosnia before they 
entered the federation. I think it is a mistake that they 
agreed to it. I do not expect that this federation will hold 
for a long time, especially not the confederation between this 
federation and Croatia. I think this is favorable for Serbia, 
because our right to establish an independent Serbian state in 
the former Bosnia-Herzegovina and its merger with other Serbian 
countries will become legitimate in this way. 
  [Reljic] Can Croatia correct the border through the use of 
force, even though several of its military actions against the 
republic of Srpska were futile? 
  [Radinovic] Croatia is not able to correct the borders with 
military means. Their constant threats are used only to make an 
impression on the domestic political scene. Even the most 
superficial analysis can prove they are not able to do it. It 
is only 6 km from the foremost Serbian positions to the Slovene 
border, toward Metlika. In certain places along the 
communication line between Karlovac and the Rijeka front, 
Serbian positions lie only two km from the road. The road can 
be hit even from 60-caliber mortars. This means that in case of 
a military escalation, the Serbs can eliminate the 
Karlovac-Rijeka communication line very quickly. Apart from 
that, the distance between the foremost Serbian positions and 
the seaside lies between 6 and 10 km, which is within the range 
of all usual weapons. 
  In other words, the Serbs can place all Dalmatian towns, 
including Split, under artillery fire. Split has not been 
attacked so far because it was estimated that this should not be 
done. Let me summarize: We can attack Split, Sibenik, Zadar, 
Karlovac, the oil industry in Sisak, Zagreb, Vinkovci, Slavonski 
Brod, Osijek.... The most dangerous thing for them is that the 
Serbs have weapons that enable them to destroy Zagreb and the 
whole infrastructure in the area of the Croatian capital. The 
republic of Serbian Krajina has powerful weapons for the 
so-called revenge strategy, which can carry out very successful 
operations and strikes against those facilities and targets the 
destruction of which Croatia cannot allow. This is an insoluble 
problem for them. 
  [Reljic] Such a state is the factor of permanent instability 
in the whole region. 
  [Radinovic] Croatia is in this sense the source of permanent 
instability. This is their problem, however. The only 
possibility is to solve the question of Croat-Serbian relations 
to the satisfaction of both so that Croats cease to consider 
Serbs a disturbing factor within their state and in the Balkans 
in general. 
  [Reljic] It is evident that the creation of small states 
results in uncontrollable conditions, under which wars can break 
out at any moment, because "a drunkard can go from one border to 
the next" -- at Maslenica, for example. 
  [Radinovic] I think it was the interest of international 
powers to create satellite states in the territory of the former 
Yugoslavia. I do not think that anything can be changed now. 
The only state that can exist is the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia. 
  [Reljic] Yugoslavia has Kosovo, however! 
  [Radinovic] I am not emotional, although emotions cannot be 
excluded when speaking about Kosovo. Kosovo is the historical 
center of the Serbian state. It is not the center of the 
Serbian state any longer, because the center moved northwards. 
All political parties and politicians have to treat Kosovo as 
an integral part of Serbia if they want to have any kind of 
support by the people. I do not want to say that Kosovo is not 
a Serbian problem; it is one of the points at which the 
political stability can be seriously affected. I would say that 
Kosovo is one of the points at which the independence of our 
state can be attacked by weapons. 
  [Reljic] What do you think about the comparison between the 
republic of Serbian Krajina and Kosovo? 
  [Radinovic] These are two completely different matters. 
Kosovo has always been an integral part of the Serbian state, 
and Krajina was not an integral part of Croatia until the first 
Yugoslav state was established. 
  [Reljic] You are speaking about historical rights, but when 
national states come into existence, there is the right of the 
stronger over the weaker in a certain territory. 
  [Radinovic] Kosovo cannot be regarded as an isolated entity. 
Serbia is stronger than Kosovo Albanians. Kosovo is Serbian 
territory. It is out of the question that Kosovo is a part of 
Serbia. I am convinced that no one even thinks of leading such 
conversations. 
  [Reljic] What do you think about "Partnership for Peace?" 
The countries around Serbia have already applied for membership 
in that alliance. Russia will also apply for it. 
  [Radinovic] Even if we wanted to apply, we would not be 
accepted now, but I do not think we should enter this alliance. 
  [Reljic] Not even after Russia? 
  [Radinovic] Not even after Russia. 
  [Reljic] Should we be against the world again? 
  [Radinovic] There is no reason for the Serbs to take to the 
market everything they succeeded in retaining though their 
history -- true self-confidence. This does not mean that we 
should remain isolated. Isolation, which I fervently oppose, is 
one thing and servility is another. "Partnership for Peace" is 
actually a cheap phrase -- a more elaborate concept for the 
transfer of the sovereignty of single states to international 
powers. This is practically silent occupation. 
  [Reljic] Do you think that Russia has not realized this? 
  [Radinovic] This is another name for a new world order under 
U.S. domination. We should look for allies among nations that 
are spiritually close to us. It is clear who they are. 
  [Reljic] Who? 
  [Radinovic] Primarily Greece, Russia, Bulgaria, Ukraine, 
Romania. 
  [Reljic] Greece is a NATO member, though. Why do you think 
it would not betray us if it needed it? 
  [Radinovic] I do not agree with it. Greeks would never 
betray us, but they can never defend us to the extent they would 
like to because they must not forget their interests. I refuse 
this theory. 
  [Reljic] They have had their interests in mind all the time, 
and Serbia served them more or less only as a good argument. 
Russia, too. 
  [Radinovic] Every state cares for its own interests; Greece 
and Russia, but also Serbia and Yugoslavia, because interests 
are eternal and all other things are transitory. It has been 
proven, however, that there are real values -- ethic, spiritual 
and civilization closeness. They are relevant even in political 
alliances. I support the theory that contacts should be sought 
with those states and nations that want us.

  [Text] Belgrade, 28 Apr (TANJUG) -- At a session of the 
Central Homeland Administration today, the Serbian Radical Party 
[SRS] passed a decision to abolish the Serbian Chetnik Movement 
[SCP], a special branch of the SRS, a statement from the party 
stresses. The SCP, formed in July 1990, "has in practice 
outgrown and superceded by far its original organizational 
frameworks, and its internal structure restricts its 
functioning." The statement gives several reasons for the 
abolition of the SCP. First, all fighters for the freedom of the 
Serb nation are nowadays calling themselves Serb Chetniks, 
regardless of whether or not they are members of the SRS. 
  Second, it is stressed that the nature of the Chetnik 
movement is deeply patriotic and freedom-loving, and that now 
that the movement has been established it should not be reduced 
to party, ideological, and political frameworks. The Chetnik 
movement is fully established today because it is generally 
accepted in all Serb countries, and in the imperilled Serb 
countries powerful Serb armies have been formed whose unity in 
leadership must not be challenged, the statement says. One of 
the reasons for abolishing the movement is that the enemies of 
the Serb nation are trying to take advantage of the formal 
establishment of the SCP to present it as proof that 
paramilitary formations are active in Serb countries, although 
Chetnik volunteers act only under the command of the Serbian 
Army. 
  The duplicating of work by the committees of the SRS and SCP 
has occasionally caused misunderstandings, the statement says, 
and adds as the final reason that members of other political 
parties have joined the SCP. The same decision by the Central 
Homeland Administration advises all SCP committees in all Serb 
countries to integrate with SRS committees.

<F P=106> [Article by M. Sasic: "A Sale of White Flour Against a </F>
`Rainy Day'"] 
  [Text] Pancevo, 5 April -- This is the report from Banat: 
Everyone has flour to sell, but there are few buyers. 
Immediately after introduction of the superdinar in late 
January, 50 kilograms of Type 500 white flour could be bought 
for 25 dinars in the vicinity of Pancevo. Just 10 days later 
that same sack of flour cost 20 dinars, then 16, and in recent 
days the same amount of flour has been offered for 13 dinars in 
a newspaper ad, while farmers at the Pancevo market have 
sometimes been selling it for even 10 dinars. The man from 
Omoljica who offered a sack of flour for 13 dinars in the 
newspaper ad says that last year he planted wheat on the field 
returned to him, "since that was the simplest thing to do." He 
had been waiting for the right price, but there is nothing to 
wait for -- 13 dinars for a sack of white flour, he says, still 
allows him to earn something on the deal. 
  The relatively low purchase price of last year's wheat crop, 
along with the troubles in collection, had the result that the 
farmers kept a fairly large portion of the wheat under favorable 
conditions in silos and waited to see what the government would 
do. It was expected that with the new harvest a few months away 
it would be compelled to offer a high price for remaining 
quantities of wheat. Ratar of Pancevo, one of the largest of our 
milling industries, received large quantities of farmers' wheat 
for storage. In return for 100 kilograms of wheat, the farmer 
received 56 kilograms of Type 500 flour and a bit of bran. But 
right now Ratar is paying from 0.14 to 0.16 dinars per kilogram 
for grain. They say at Ratar that some mills have already halted 
production or will do so in a few days because of the large 
amount of flour in inventory. They are also fighting 
considerably more fiercely with one another for the market. 
While the price of Type 500 Pancevo flour is 0.25 dinars per 
kilogram, fob the purchaser, there are already mills selling it 
for 0.21 dinars. You cannot walk down any street in southern 
Banat this spring without seeing in a window a sign advertising 
flour at a good price. 
  Farmers who have several metric tons of wheat and flour 
stored with milling firms need money for spring planting. To 
compound their trouble, flour consumption has dropped off 
considerably. Large trade-union purchases have had the result 
that there is no family that does not have at least one sack of 
flour stored away, so that retail purchases have almost died 
out. We have to assume, then, that the price of that flour 
stored in the attic "for a rainy day" will drop even further. 
Especially if weather conditions indicate a good harvest this 
year, the experts say. 
  It has turned out that those who traded their flour for 
fertilizer last summer have fared best. At that time a kilogram 
of KAN nitrogen fertilizer could be obtained for a kilogram of 
wheat. Today a kilogram of KAN is 0.33 dinars, which means twice 
as much as for the same amount of wheat. Thus in these 
transactions, with the tricky prices, the Pancevo nitrogen 
fertilizer plant Azotara, trading fertilizer for wheat, became 
the owner of 65,000 tons of wheat last summer. They say at the 
fertilizer plant that in spite of the modest price of wheat, 
they cannot complain, because it made it possible for them to 
survive the factory's shutdown for six months. The price of gas, 
the largest item in nitrogen fertilizer production, was 
considerably lower last year, and so this offset possible large 
losses in the trade, which the government was pushing. At this 
point the fertilizer plant still has 20,000 tons of wheat and 
does not want to sell it cheaper than 0.18 dinars per kilogram. 
They say, of course, that if they now had the fertilizer which 
they gave for wheat back then, they would today be the most 
profitable factory in the area.

<F P=106> [Article by Vlado Babic: "The European Race Was Begotten by </F>
the Serbs"] 
  [Text] The first Serbian rebellion against 
civilization; nationalism that could be realized. 
  The first Serbian rebellion against civilization, as 
publicist Milomir Maric beautifully described the absurdity of 
the current implementation of the Serbian national program, has 
had many predecessors, ideologues, and executors. Let us start 
with Olga Lukovic-Pjanovic, author of the book The Serbs: 
The Oldest People, who stated that Jesus Christ was a Serb 
and that all the European peoples were derived from Serbs. The 
painter Milic of Macva stole the discovery of the Sorabs as the 
ancestral people from the above-mentioned author, and he himself 
"ascertained" that the Serbs were the center of the 
world--territorially, linguistically, and by destiny. Among the 
older authors, Dr. Milovan Grba, in 1920, published a discussion 
of the Serbs as a special race that differed from others. Vuk 
Karadzic was also surprised that "the Croats do not want to be 
Serbs, just because of Roman law and the Catholic religion." 
Geographer Jovan Cvijic thought that the Croats are "only an 
appendage of the Serbian people." Maric follows that the red 
thread of Greater-Serbian nationalism goes from the "plans" of 
Ilija Garasanin, through the partially fulfilled plan of Vasa 
Cubrilovic for resettling Albanians from Kosovo to Turkey, to 
the Serbian Academy of Science and Art memorandum. 
  Since the moment when that notorious program was proclaimed 
their own by the victors at the eighth session and by the SPS 
[Serbian Socialist Party] party and state apparatus, the war for 
territory began. The implementation of the program has been 
taken over by the former JNA [Yugoslav People's Army] and the 
new "Serbian defenders." Let us look at how General Mladic spoke 
out. "During the war I broke down as a Communist and a Yugoslav, 
and I became the biggest Serb. It is only a question of time 
when I will liberate the Serbian city of Zadar, which the 
traitorous supreme command of the JNA already prevented me from 
doing some time ago. Trieste is also an old Serbian city, which 
will fall into our hands once again. The Serbian army will end 
the war at the Trieste-Vienna line, like the previous two as 
well." The justifiably celebrated Dr. Vojislav Seselj, in 
contrast to Mladic, would satisfy himself with a western border 
on the Karlobeg-Virovitica line. When the United States 
threatened to bomb bridges and airports in the Federal Republic 
of Yugoslavia [FRY], a joke arose precisely on that subject, 
according to which Zemun and New Belgrade, in the future, will 
be named Karlobag and Virovitica. 
  Zeljko "Arkan" Raznjatovic, still one of the tiresomely 
large 
number of candidates for the title of the most important Serb, 
is promising that Jasenovac will not be repeated. "We will no 
longer be sheep, but rather wolves, or even better, tigers. The 
blood of Obilic, which does not permit me to possess a house, 
flows through my veins. With the aid of all our enemies, a 
Greater Albania in Serbian Kosovo, a Greater Croatia in the 
Serbian Krajina, and a Greater Bulgaria in Serbian Macedonia are 
appearing before our very eyes. The Muslims, who are actually 
Serbian martyrs who are not aware that they are Serbs, have 
become vampires in Bosnia. Zadar, Sibenik, Dubrovnik, and Split 
are Serbian cities, where the Catholics moved in by force, and 
it is high time for us to drive them away from there. We are 
fighting to restore the borders of the former Yugoslavia, up to 
Sezana, since those are the Serbian borders. Slovenia will be 
Serbian Slovenia again, Croatia will be Serbian Croatia, Bosnia 
will be Serbian Bosnia, and Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] will be Serbian Macedonia again. 
Slovenia is Serbian because I was born in it, and because the 
Slovenes had sex with our enemies the Ustase. That is why my 
battle cry is `F... their mothers and fathers!'" The fact that 
Arkan has supporters on whom he can rely is also confirmed by a 
statement by his "Colonel" Mile Ulemek, who, in his cafe in 
Pazova, strictly forbids serving non-Serbs. It follows from his 
geopolitical views that "the Croats received a lot of money from 
abroad in order to do a dirty job on the Serbs." "Since they 
have not done it yet, they will have to engage in conflict 
again. They will also try to involve the Hungarians in their 
work. Then there will also be an explosion in Kosovo. We are 
just waiting for it! The Albanians are fortunately concentrated 
in one city, so we will be able to flatten them with the air 
force in just three hours. Only then will there be a final 
settling of accounts in Serbia itself. The hungry will attack 
the rich, who have enriched themselves disgracefully in this war 
at the expense of the populace. Of course, Arkan and I will 
defend the exhausted Serbs. We will fight against the rich on 
the side of the poor until we subjugate Belgrade, the last nest 
of traitors in the heart of Serbia." 
  The most serious candidate for the most important Serbian 
woman is Dr. Biljana Plavsic, vice president of the republic of 
Srpska. Her racist statements, especially the claim that it 
would even be worthwhile to sacrifice 6 million Serbs to 
establish a unified state, in fact, have even been condemned by 
Milosevic. In view of its life to date and some recent actions, 
we can justifiably suspect the ethnic purity of "her" state. 
  In the "world conspiracy" against the "celestial Serbs," 
only 
the Greeks and the Russians have proven to be friends, and from 
time to time it has also been possible to observe signs of 
Serbian-Jewish friendship. The news that they are preparing to 
issue the notorious "Protocol of the Elders of Zion" indicates 
that the paranoia about the world conspiracy is approaching its 
logical conclusion--anti-Semitism. Does that mean that there has 
been a lack of claims and evidence about genocide against 
Albanians, Croats, and Muslims, and that the hostility toward 
Macedonians, Hungarians, and Slovenes is melting away? Is it 
only a question of introducing new melodies on the Serbian 
political scene that are compatible with the new orientation on 
the Russian political scene? 
  With Mladic's help, Dr. Radovan Karadzic has gone furthest 
in 
carrying out the plan. In order to fulfill Karadjordje's dream, 
which in Karadzic's opinion is of divine origin, and erase the 
border on the Drina, the Sarajevo psychiatrist has used all 
means available. Whether all means will also be permitted in 
carrying out the Serbian plan for the unification of all Serbs 
into a single state, however, does not depend solely on the 
Serbs, although in various stages of its development and 
implementation it has already been supported by almost all the 
political parties, the Serbian Orthodox Church, the Serbian 
Academy of Science and Art, almost the entire intellectual 
"elite," and the vast majority of Serbian protesters and 
citizens inside Serbia, and even more outside it. Now others, 
primarily the great powers, are deciding on the Serbian national 
program. It will be shown in the very near future whether 
conclusive action will prevail over verbal support for the 
generally accepted principles of the UN Charter and the Helsinki 
Declaration. 
  The assertion that this moment is the decisive one is also 
supported by the new mobilization of the Greater-Serbian 
intellectual elite. A second congress of Serbian intellectuals 
has been scheduled for the second half of April, at which they 
are to discuss the Serbian people's right to self-determination 
and to life in a common state. The meeting has been envisioned 
as "patriotic resistance to the demonization that has encircled 
us and is encircling us on all sides." Milosevic, however, is 
allowing all the above-mentioned people to work for him, while 
he himself is preparing for various results of the 
implementation of the Serbian national program. If the 
international situation allows him, he will, of course, assume 
the laurels of the unifier of all the Serbian states. Since he 
would rather have power than citizens, we can believe that with 
respect to his noticeably more peace-loving and calmer 
statements, he will certainly not sign anything that could later 
be used against him, while he is also preparing for other--less 
comfortable--possibilities.

<F P=106> [Article by M. Momcilovic: "The Courage and Risk of </F>
Mesokombinat in Leskovac"] 
  [Text] Leskovac, 5 April -- Mesokombinat of Leskovac has 
become the new boss of the sheep farm on Cemernik, above Crna 
Trava, whose capacity has been increased to 4,000 head following 
reconstruction. This move on the part of the people from 
Leskovac is risky and brave, to say the least, since that farm 
-- in which the republic invested immense sums -- has never 
operated as it should have. The original investor was the work 
force of Vlasine-Produkt of Surdilica, which at one time was 
raising a herd of more than 2,000 sheep there. 
  Crnotravka of Sastav Reka, the only agricultural 
organization 
in Crna Trava Opstina, which is close to the farm, expressed a 
willingness to take it over, provided of course it was fitted 
out for the sheep to overwinter. The republic had nothing 
against that, and it opened its purse for reconstruction of the 
farm, but Crnotravka, which at that time was part of Delisec of 
Vladin Han, was not able to develop livestock raising. The farm 
was vacant for two years, neglected and fleeced to the point 
where now investments are being made to equip it for the third 
time. 
<H5>  Inexpensive Source of Raw Materials </H5>
  A farm on Vlasina experienced a similar destiny. When 
brucellosis decimated the herd, the people of Surdulica threw up 
their hands, and Simpo of Vranje jumped in and is now 
undertaking the development of livestock raising along with 
other things. 
  "We are going into the hill-and-mountain region of Crna 
Trava, we are taking over abandoned facilities in order to round 
out the process of primary production and processing. We are 
creating an inexpensive source of raw materials for the 
production of livestock feed; we want to make full use of the 
natural resources of this region," says Sreten Ristic, director 
of Mesokombinat and people's deputy in the Yugoslav Assembly. 
  Mesokombinat, Ristic adds, intends to develop livestock 
raising which will include not only the sheep farm on Cemernik, 
but also small, private sheep and dairy farms, and plans also 
call for a small horse farm to meet the needs of tourism. Plans 
also call for production of seed potatoes and silage corn, for 
which the conditions are ideal, and in the abandoned fittings 
factory in Crna Trava they will open a plant for processing 
herbs and edible forest products. Plans call for building a 
drier and cooler in that facility, and in the future they will 
have an operation to produce fruit juices and jams. 
  Crna Trava is ecologically clean, and we will adopt a clean 
processing operation that will not threaten the environment. We 
will be involved with mushrooms, blueberries, medicinal herbs, 
and other edible forest products, Ristic said. 
  "We are investing in the natural resources, while 
Mesokombinat is investing knowledge and money. We want to 
preserve what has been achieved in the past, to employ new 
people, and to halt the migration," says Milos Jovasevic, 
manager of Crnotravka. 
<H5>  There Is No Livestock Feed </H5>
  They do not seem to be very worried at Mesokombinat about 
going to a place from which others have fled. 
  "The main problem is livestock feed. We have already 
undertaken to revitalize the neglected soil, and we have begun 
improvement of a 380-hectare pasture. We have also prepared 30 
hectares of land for the production of seed potatoes and silage 
corn. In this area there are about 3,000 hectares of forests, 
pastures, and plowland. All of this is neglected, but it can be 
put into shape," Sreten Ristic warns. 
  "Mesokombinat's advantage is that it has its own retail 
network, so that the route of the finished product to the 
customer will be shorter, and that also means cheaper. Aside 
from creating a source of raw materials for their processing 
plants, this well-known producer and processor of meat will also 
be involved in a health food program. The Crna Trava climate 
offers excellent conditions for the production of milk, yogurt, 
and Kackavalj cheese. 
  When it completes all these projects, which are already 
underway, Mesokombinat will round out conditions for development 
of rural tourism in the area of Crna Trava.

  [Text] Vienna, April 28 (AFP) -- The Conference on Security 
and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) expressed concern Thursday [28 
April] at worsening human rights in the mainly Albanian Serbian 
province of Kosovo. The international grouping, based in 
Vienna, has asked authorities in Belgrade to allow the 
resumption of long-term CSCE missions in the southern province 
and other mixed areas, the Sandzak and Vojvodina, a statement 
said. 
  "The CSCE is very concerned by the deterioration (...) 
especially the recent suppression of human rights and basic 
freedoms which have led to increased tension and instability in 
the region," it said. The body has been notified of many cases 
of arrests, detentions and arbitary police brutality against the 
ethnic Albanian majority, "a flagrant violation of the 
principles of the CSCE and the commitments made by the Serbian 
authorities," it continued. The resumption of long-term 
missions, banned by Belgrade last July, "could contribute to the 
prevention of conflicts in the region," it said.

<F P=106> [Report by Senada Cumurovic] </F>
  [Text] The aggressor forces have not yet fully withdrawn 
to the distance of 3 km from Gorazde. This was confirmed this 
morning by Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic 
after his talks with General Michael Rose, commander of the UN 
forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Sergio De Mello, head of the 
United Nations' civilian sector for the former Yugoslavia. 
Senada Cumorovic reports: 
  [Cumorovic] General Michael Rose briefly said that he talked 
to Prime Minister Silajdzic today about some details and the 
UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] plans for Gorazde, not 
specifying what actually these plans were. In a statement for 
journalists, Dr. Haris Silajdzic was somewhat more specific 
concerning the topics of and the reasons for today's meeting 
with Rose and Sergio De Mello. 
  [Begin Silajdzic recording] We are discussing the situation 
in Gorazde. The aggressor forces have not withdrawn yet from 
Ljubcici and some other places inside 3 km. On the whole, they 
have withdrawn but [words indistinct]. This is where the 
problem is. We also have a report from our forces that some 
heavy weapons are still inside the 20 km radius [words 
indistinct] heavy weapons of the aggressor side. We want to be 
completely clear as to what this means. General Rose has 
therefore promised that he will today study the photographs 
taken from the air in order to establish whether the Serbian 
heavy artillery is still inside the 20 km radius. [end recording] 
  [Cumurovic] In addition to military issues, they also 
discussed the normalization of life in Gorazde. 
  [Begin Silajdzic recording] We are currently discussing the 
situation concerning water. The question of water is acute. 
You know that the civilian population is now receiving water 
from the springs that are not quite hygienic. We are afraid 
that some disease does not break out. Therefore, we will work 
toward the immediate repair of the water system, which, as you 
know, was destroyed by the aggressor forces before they 
withdrew. [end recording] 
  [Cumurovic] As regards journalists' question, we will single 
out the one concerning the continuation of negotiations in this 
phase of the peace process. Dr. Silajdzic takes the view that 
restarting the peace process could make sense only if the Serbs 
honor the ultimatum, because this is a matter of the credibility 
of the international community. Without that credibility we 
cannot talk about negotiations [words indistinct] sense, Dr. 
Silajdzic told journalists. Following the statements for 
journalists, and General rose's departure, Prime Minister 
Silajdzic continued talks with Sergio De Mello, head of the 
civilian sector of the United Nations for the former Yugoslavia.

  [Excerpt] Members of the contact group -- consisting of 
representatives of the United States, Russia, the United 
Nations, and the European Union -- held the first round of talks 
in Sarajevo this afternoon. The members of the group were 
received by Alija Izetbegovic, president of the Presidency of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic. Mladen 
Bosnjak reports on what they told journalists after the talks: 
  [Bosnjak] After the talks, which lasted quite a long time, 
Alija Izetbegovic, France's Jean-Pierre Masset, and Charles 
Redman, the U.S. representative in the contact group, addressed 
journalists. 
  What Jean-Pierre Masset said could be summed up as follows: 
The main task of the group is to find ways to restart the 
diplomatic and negotiation process. 
  Alija Izetbegovic, president of the Presidency, was 
considerably more specific and clearer: 
  [Begin Izetbegovic recording] Of course, the question of a 
cessation of hostilities was raised. We said here that [words 
indistinct] Gorazde. We told the contact group that we had just 
received a report that Serbian forces had not left the 3-km 
zone. There is also a lot of Serbian artillery and Serbian arms 
inside the 20-km radius. We said that under these conditions we 
cannot negotiate. They (?told us that) they are going to Pale 
tomorrow and will return from Pale sometime in the afternoon. 
We will continue the talks then. 
  We took this opportunity to raise objections, to draw 
attention to the fact that the machine for murdering and 
destroying towns, this big, massive machine, the (?Serbian) 
artillery that the Serbian side has near Gorazde, is, according 
to our information, now being deployed in other locations with 
the task of (?destroying). We fear a new Gorazde in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  We expressed our regret that the opportunity had been missed 
finally to remove and destroy this war machine. In our view, 
this would have created the conditions not only for peace in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and the immediate removal of a great danger 
of new conflicts, but also for a future of peace in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. As long as this machinery exists, there are 
no conditions for stable peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina or in the 
wider region. 
  We said that we favor talks. To put it in the simplest 
terms, there are two conditions for the negotiations to end 
successfully. These consist of respect for the sovereignty and 
integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina. We do not want the country to 
be divided. This is the first condition. The second is that the 
Chetniks withdraw from occupied Muslim and Croatian regions. 
These are the two conditions that we are setting. In this 
context, we will provide the group with maps drawn in the way we 
see them, and we will present them to the group in the near 
future, perhaps even next week, when they come here again. 
  We also stressed our view that peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
cannot be separated, that a solution for Bosnia-Herzegovina 
cannot be separated from the overall solution in the former 
Yugoslavia. It cannot be separated from the situation in 
Croatia, Serbia, Kosovo, or Macedonia [the Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], and from our point of view, it 
cannot be separated from the situation in Sandzak in particular. 
We [words indistinct] Sandzak. We found out here that two 
working groups are operating. One is the contact group working 
on Bosnia-Herzegovina, and another is working on the rest of 
Yugoslavia. 
  We pointed out that we did not think that this was the most 
ideal solution, and that it would be good if these problems were 
unified since the problems are impossible to separate. As 
regards the cessation of hostilities, of course, it must only be 
temporary. I am thinking in terms of two or three months during 
which a political solution should be found. After all these 
attempts so far, one cannot be an optimist. However, I must say 
that this is currently the strongest group that has become 
involved thus far. Virtually all the relevant bodies in the 
world are represented here, first the United States, then the 
European Union, the United Nations, and finally, which is very 
important, the Russian Federation. This is very important. We 
think that it can play (?an important) role. It has so far been 
absent from these negotiations and this was perhaps [word 
indistinct] the way to solve this issue. Its involvement can 
help in (?finding) a political solution. [end recording] 
[passage omitted]

  [Text] Not only have they not withdrawn to the distance of 
3 km, but the chetniks are also entrenching as close as 1 km to 
the city center. At about 1300, a small group of them came down 
to UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] personnel carriers situated 
some 350 meters from the hospital. With UNPROFOR approval, the 
chetniks are continuing settling their civilians inside the 3 km 
zone. This is what is happening in Zubcici, south of the town. 
This is what is happening east of the town, in the suburbs of 
(?Fazagici) and (?Pubjeri). 
  One should also say that all these three villages are 
villages that were populated exclusively by Muslims before the 
war. A (?similar) situation is in Kopaci, which is more than 3 
km from the city center. The chetniks are also settling people 
there. Looting on the entire occupied territory is drawing to 
an end. According to the information of the Army of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina in Gorazde, artillery weapons have not been 
removed from the majority of the strongholds between Cajnice and 
Foca. Of course, in some cases, they were only redeployed to 
new positions, close to [words indistinct] This refers to 
(?Nekopi), Zebina Suma, [word indistinct], Djakovici, and many 
other locations. 
  This is Fahrudin Becic reporting for the Radio and 
Television 
of Bosnia-Herzegovina.

    [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Network in Serbo-Croatian at 0800 GMT on 29 April carries in its 
regular 6-minute newscast three reports on the military 
situation in the republic. 
  Brcko correspondent Hamid Deronjic reports that "overnight, 
the Serbian aggressor concentrated the greatest amount of 
manpower and equipment since the beginning of the preparations 
for the resumption of the offensive on the free Brcko territory. 
Chetnik transport helicopters, flying at low altitudes, [words 
indistinct] flights on the Ovcari-Brcko route. An influx of an 
immense quantity of motorized [words indistinct] was also 
registered from the direction of Ovcari. Up until 2200 on the 
Ovcari-Brcko route, the movement of heavy transport and combat 
vehicles of the Serbian aggressor could be heard. Our 
reconnaissance scouts were unable to register [words indistinct] 
of chetnik reinforcements outside the Brcko area. The 
concentration of enemy armored- mechanized hardware was 
registered last night on the central part of the Brcko front, 
Cadjavac, and Bijelina Ravna. The temporarily occupied Brcko is 
full of chetniks; the town is literally overflowing with chetnik 
phalanxes, which are causing increasing problems even for the 
citizens of Serbian nationality. According to our 
reconnaissance sources, Brcko Serbs are afraid to leave their 
homes for fear that they might be robbed [words indistinct]." 
  An unidentified correspondent reports on an extremely poor 
line that "chetnik activity in the 4th Corps theater of 
operations, or more precisely, on the Konjic and Bijelimic 
fronts [words indistinct]. In addition to antiaircraft machine 
gun and small arms fire at the defense lines and suburbs of 
Konjic, Karadzic's followers early this morning fiercely shelled 
the residential areas in Glavicine. At the time of filing this 
report, the offensive activity has decreased somewhat. There 
was no offensive activity of the Serbian-Montenegrin aggressor 
on the southern part of the front, while the separation lines 
between the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army and the Croatian Defense 
Council [HVO] [words indistinct]. However, we must say that the 
implementation of the Washington Agreement in this area is 
progressing very slowly simply because the HVO still has not 
given up on its intention to divide Mostar." 
  Gracanica correspondent Izudin Durakovic reports that "the 
aggressor continued provocations overnight, although mainly from 
a distance. Using 82-mm mortars from Besanj, 122-mm howitzers 
from Jajcevac, and tanks from Sjenina, the chetniks shelled 
Obric and Mujanov Mezar. They tried to use the shelling to 
infiltrate small subversion groups, which the defenders 
discovered in time. During the night, the chetniks carried on 
regrouping their manpower and hardware, which implies that they 
will today continue their offensive activity on the northern 
part of the Trebava [River] front."

  [Text] Zagreb, April 28 (AFP) -- The UN Protection Force 
[UNPROFOR] is worried by growing tension in Brcko, north-east 
Bosnia, one of the main hotspots in the war-torn country, an 
UNPROFOR spokesman said Thursday [28 April]. "Brcko is an area 
of concern to us. It's something we are looking at very 
closely," Matthew Nerzig said. 
  There has been no serious outbreak of fighting to date but 
Brcko remains "a general area of tension, a possible 
flashpoint," the UN spokesman went on. Since the Serb 
withdrawal from Gorazde, eastern Bosnia, earlier this week, NATO 
and UN sources have expressed worries that the Serbs might 
attack in Brcko in order to widen the corridor linking the 
territories they control in Croatia and Bosnia with the rump 
Yugoslavia. For the moment, there is nothing to suggest that 
the Serbs have moved their heavy weapons north, the UNPROFOR 
spokesman said. 
  "There is no indication that the weapons that have been 
withdrawn out of the Gorazde area are moving all together in a 
consolidated, unified combat form to some other location." 
However, there are practical difficulties for the UN in 
attempting to cover the situation in Brcko where it has no 
military observers at present. The Serbs have to date objected 
to any UN presence. The 50 UN military observers deployed in 
areas controlled by the Serbs -- out of a total of 256 in the 
whole of Bosnia-Herzegovina -- are still subject to varying 
degrees of restrictions on their movements. "In some areas it 
is quite restricted but in others, such as Sarajevo, the freedom 
of movement is much better," Nerzig said. 
  Serb forces held dozens of UN personnel hostage for over a 
week immediately after the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation 
launched air strikes on April 10 and 11 against the Serbs 
attacking Gorazde.

  [Text] Sarajevo, April 28 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serbs are 
demanding that all aid convoys for the Moslem enclave of Gorazde 
start from Belgrade, the aid organisation International Action 
Against Hunger (AICF) said Thursday [28 April]. The Serbs have 
already halted a convoy organised by AICF in Sarajevo and bound 
for Gorazde, the aid agency said. 
  "Only UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] military convoys are 
authorized by the Bosnian Serbs to travel from Sarajevo to 
Gorazde," according to Beatrice d'Ervau, spokeswoman for the 
humanitarian group. The group's convoy in Sarajevo was 
originally to have been escorted by UNPROFOR, but the Serbs 
refused to allow UN involvement. They demanded that the convoy 
be protected by Serb militias, which was unacceptable to the 
organisers. 
  On Wednesday, an International Committee of the Red Cross 
convoy arrived in the eastern Bosnian enclave after being held 
up for several days in Pale, the Bosnian Serb self-proclaimed 
capital. A NATO ultimatum which eventually sparked the Bosnian 
Serb withdrawal from around Gorazde included a demand that aid 
convoys be allowed unimpeded access to the enclave, which was 
under Serb assault for three weeks.

  [Text] Sarajevo, April 29 (AFP) -- Gorazde is "basically a 
ghetto" which can expect "serious health problems" over the 
summer as a result of the destruction of the town's sole water 
purification plant, an aid worker said Friday [29 April]. 
Although all the town's population, estimated at more than 
50,000 people, had shelter, there was "very serious 
overcrowding" with the town's three remaining schools -- two 
others were completely destroyed -- used as collective centres, 
Ryan Grist, of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), said 
after a five-day visit. 
  There were two sources of good water where people had to 
spend long hours queueing: "the problem is not quality but 
quantity." Though there was "a lot of destruction" in the town, 
Gorazde was "not a Vukovar", the eastern Croatian town that was 
almost totally flattened by three months of Serbian shelling in 
late 1991. However in the areas reached by the Serb offensive, 
"every house was gutted," Grist said. 
  On Wednesday [27 April], during a visit to the Gorazde, UN 
commander in Bosnia-Herzegovina General Sir Michael Rose said 
there was "not as much destruction as (he) expected." On 
reports that the number of casualties during the three-week 
onslaught on the town had been inflated, Grist commented: "There 
was complete terror and horror; if I'd been there, I too would 
have exaggerated." 
  Following the first evacuations of the wounded from Gorazde 
Monday, UN sources suggested that the numbers of killed and 
wounded might have to be revised downwards by as much as two 
thirds. 
  The representative of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, 
Peter Kessler, has consistently defended his organisation's 
estimate of more than 700 killed and almost 2,000 wounded. A 
Nordic battalion has located "a further 70 to 100 seriously 
wounded people in difficult access regions" of Gorazde who he 
hoped would be evacuated out of the town Sunday [1 May]. They 
were "apparently heavily wounded" and would be transferred to 
the city centre Saturday [30 April], he said. Many of those 
evacuated to Sarajevo in a three-day operation earlier this week 
were seriously affected by infection and malnutrition, Kessler 
said. Up to 25 were to be urgently evacuated to France, Ireland 
and Denmark Saturday, depending on their condition. 
  A 14-truck UNHCR convoy carrying 68 tonnes of wheat flour 
and 
family packages left Belgrade early Friday and was expected to 
arrive in Gorazde later in the morning, Kessler said. He added 
that following several "administrative delays" imposed by 
Bosnian Serbs in eastern Bosnia, his organisation had reminded 
them of their obligation to allow unhindered freedom of movement 
for humanitarian convoys.

  [Text] The survival of the federation of Bosnians and 
Croats will directly depend on their ability to resist Serb 
aggression, and in that context Croatia supports the lifting of 
the arms embargo, the Croatian Embassy [in Bosnia-Herzegovina] 
said in a statement. Talks aimed at reaching peace and finding 
a negotiated solution to the crisis still remain the best 
option, which Croatia resolutely supports. But the way in which 
the Serb side is abusing the peace process shows that diplomatic 
efforts must be backed in the future by a credible threat of 
force. This is why Croatia supports the UN secretary general's 
initiative that the response to the militant Serb policy should, 
as the last resort, be NATO air strikes, the statement says.

  [Excerpts] Banja Luka, 29 Apr (TANJUG) -- The Republic of 
Croatia is by all accounts intensively preparing for an imminent 
attack on the Serb positions in Posavina, the press center of 
the republic of Srpska army's First Krajina Corps said in a 
statement today, citing well-informed sources. Croatia's army 
has recently accumulated units and military equipment in 
Posavina, on the left bank of the River Sava, mainly in the 
wider areas of Slavonski Brod and Zupanja. According to the 
same source, large numbers of Croats and Muslims from Posavina 
are members of these units, and some new units have also been 
founded. [passage omitted] 
  The press center notes that Croatian media have recently 
carried an increasing number of "reports" about the Serbian 
side's preparations for attacks against the Croatian positions 
in Posavina. This is a typical form of media preparations: an 
attempt to condemn the Serbian side in advance before strong 
Croatian-Muslim attacks begin. [passage omitted]

was injured Thursday [28 April] in Sarajevo when he stepped on a 
land mine near Mount Igman while on patrol duty, the Defence 
Ministry said Friday [29 April]. 21 year-old Kristoffer 
Melinder, of Sweden's Ninth Company, suffered a fracture and 
splinters to a leg and was taken to a French hospital for 
surgery. The 9th Company, part of the joint Nordic peacekeeping

  [Excerpt] Kresimir Zubak, the president of the Presidential 
Council of Herzeg-Bosna, has sent a letter to Bosnian Prime 
Minister Haris Silajdzic calling on him to urge the Muslim side 
to fulfill all remaining obligations from the agreement on 
exchange of prisoners. Zdenko Vranjes reporting. 
  [Vranjes] In a letter to Silajdzic, Kresimir Zubak says 
among 
other things, that the Bosnian Muslim side has not yet supplied 
information on the fate of 26 Croats taken from Bugojno, as was 
set out in the agreement on the exchange of all remaining 
prisoners. The Croatian side has fulfilled all its obligations 
from the agreement. 
  Zubak also notes that Bosnian representatives from Bugojno 
did not come to a meeting yesterday, either. The Croatian side 
was thus let down for the third time since the beginning of the 
process of exchanging all remaining prisoners, the letter 
stresses. Zubak also asks Silajdzic to exert his personal 
influence to solve this problem that burdens Croat-Bosnian 
relations. Zubak also informs Silajdzic in his letter that, in 
line with an agreement, the Croatian side has appointed its 
members into a joint expert group which is to deal with the 
delineation of cantons. 
  At a session held today, the government of the Croat 
republic 
of Herzeg-Bosna demanded the Bosnian side fulfill its 
obligations from the economic sphere, as agreed between 
representatives of the Herzeg-Bosna government and the 
government in Sarajevo. The need to elect as soon as possible 
the leaders of the federation was also stressed. This would 
finally create one of the basic conditions for the functioning 
of the constitution [of the federation]. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Rasim Delic, commander in chief of the Army </F>
of Bosnia-Herzegovina, by Rasim Cerimagic on 15 April 1994; 
place not given: "The People and the State Are Surviving"] 
  [Text] [Delic] The Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina [the B-H 
Army] has not allowed the aggressor to occupy our country, to 
destroy the Bosniak people and others who stood up for Bosnia- 
Herzegovina as their motherland as well. The B-H Army 
militarily defeated the Croatian Defense Council [HVO], and 
brought it to the negotiating table. Given the mediation of the 
United States, those efforts have resulted in the federation of 
Bosniaks and Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is what the 
Bosnian delegation proposed at the negotiations a year ago. In 
addition to these results and the enlargement of the free 
territory, the B-H Army has also been cleaning up its own ranks, 
has grown stronger in terms of organization, and has finally 
reached the stage when those who are familiar with the results 
are calling it a real army. That is a great compliment for us. 
We know best our weaknesses. There is a plenty of room for us 
to strengthen the organization and introduce even more order and 
discipline. 
  We have a vision of how the B-H Army will look in the 
federation, and what it will be like in the future. Of course, 
all those plans are supposed to be financially, morally, and 
politically covered. We are continuing to work on 
self-filtration, because there are still those who use their 
uniforms to cover up some completely different goals, be it 
criminal activities, intelligence gathering for the enemy, or 
their ambitions for military careers. We have to understand 
that the war is still going on, that the B-H Army is here to 
protect the people and the state, so one ought to help it in 
every way for the army to become even more than it has been so 
far: a guarantee enabling our government to discuss the future 
of Bosnia-Herzegovina on equal terms, thereby making it possible 
to achieve a just peace and freedom for this country. The B-H 
Army is not an alien self-creation, it arose from and is still a 
part of our people, to whom I want to express my gratitude for 
everything it has done for the army. 
  [Cerimagic] This is a response of General Rasim Delic to the 
question of what strategic goals our army has achieved in the 
past two years of the aggression against Bosnia-Herzegovina by 
the Serbo-Montenegrin aggressor and the HVO. Although it was 
Army Day, the day of its foundation, that was the only question 
related to the achievements reached in the past two years. The 
severity with which Gorazde is being attacked, as well as the 
attacks on other territories, determined the content of the 
interview with the commander in chief of the B-H Army, which 
took place on 15 April 1994. 
  [Cerimagic] The global strategic goal of the Serbian 
aggressor is the creation of a 30-km belt on the Bosnian side of 
the Drina River, while Gorazde, Zepa, and Srebrenica are three 
enclaves that stand in the way of the Serbs' accomplishment of 
their ancient dream. What induced the aggressor to take the 
risk of NATO intervention at such an unfavorable moment, and 
attack Gorazde, even though it was beleaguered and represented 
no serious military threat? 
  [Delic] At this stage the creation of a 30-km belt on the 
Bosnian bank of the Drina is certainly not their global 
strategic goal. Because, by surrounding those three enclaves, 
the aggressor has created conditions to solve a long-term 
problem by pressuring citizens to leave the region. This is 
from the aggressor's point of view, of course. However, at this 
stage, the goal of the Serbs is to ease the pressure that is 
being exerted on them. They want to turn the existing 
occupation into a factual-legal state at the negotiating table. 
By carrying out attacks against the free, that is, safe zones 
of Gorazde and Bihac, which the Serbs know are very difficult to 
help in any concrete way, because they are surrounded, and that 
we will demand intervention by the international community, they 
are trying to legitimize their conquests. When we turn to the 
United Nations to demand protection and the return to the 
initial state on the ground, the Serbs then demand a lasting 
cease-fire, and the positioning of UNPROFOR troops between the 
warring factions, as they put it. Thereby the situation on the 
ground would be frozen, with Bosnia-Herzegovina in the same 
situation as Cyprus or Lebanon. The situation on the ground 
would turn into a lasting occupation, while in that way the 
aggressor would establish its para-state. That is a Serb goal, 
and for that reason, despite the strong international political 
pressure, and now even military, they have taken the risk of 
foreign intervention. 
  [Cerimagic] There are opinions, to put it metaphorically, 
that the Serbs in pounding Gorazde are not destroying the town 
alone, but rather the Bosniak-Croatian federation. 
  [Delic] Certainly, the Washington Agreement and the military 
steps that have been taken in the field have caused alarm among 
the Serb aggressors, and probably also fear. This is because in 
reality the federation means a deployment of large numbers of 
troops jointly by the B-H Army and the HVO. As for the HVO, 
there are no guarantees that they would be engaged in any 
further fighting, but the B-H Army, having saved forces that 
were deployed against the HVO until yesterday, has created the 
conditions for taking up offensives for the legitimate 
liberation of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The remarks about the B-H 
Army being active on the front are absurd, because the only 
legitimate force is the B-H Army, and it is only the deployment 
of B-H Army troops that is legitimate in any part of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. It has a right to take action on any part 
of the territory, to liberate it from the Serb-Montenegrin 
occupation. Therefore, the aggressor is doing everything to 
prevent the implementation of the Bosniak-Croatian federation. 
  [Cerimagic] How do you comment on the statement by war 
criminal Ratko Mladic, that, in his opinion, there will be even 
more raids by Phantoms, so that any aircraft attacking Serb 
positions will be downed? 
  [Delic] Well, he is probably frank in saying so, because, 
according to our intelligence, the Serbs are not giving up their 
goal, that is, to cleanse the right bank of the Drina, and 
perhaps even more than that. For that reason he is implying new 
raids by Phantoms.... 
  Mladic's threat that they would fire on any object flying in 
the airspace over the Serbs' positions is an attempt to divert 
NATO from carrying out any further air strikes, and also an 
attempt to freeze the current situation on the Gorazde front. 
He would be satisfied if the current situation were frozen, 
since he is near Gorazde, and that the Serb paramilitaries may 
continue to torment Gorazde with their snipers. However, our 
attitude is explicit and consistent: We demand that the Serb 
aggressor pull back to the positions that it held prior to the 
latest offensive.... 
  [Cerimagic] How do you assess the role of General Rose in 
the Gorazde case? 
  [Delic] General Rose is certainly in a position where at the 
same time he must carry out his task as a member of the 
international forces, and implement the policy of his country. 
I can see everything that he, as a commander and a man, wants 
to accomplish. His job is certainly very difficult. However, 
he should himself explain why he has taken certain actions. I 
was sending him information on a daily basis about preparations 
for the offensive against Gorazde and its course, together with 
concrete data on the number of shells, the directions from which 
the enemy troops were coming, and from which their attacks were 
carried out. However, the information that was forwarded to the 
United Nations by UNPROFOR stated that there were only 
skirmishes, and that there were no attacks, right up until the 
moment when the situation in Gorazde became worse than critical. 
Therefore, his conduct is probably a part of the policy pursued 
either by the international community or by certain countries. 
Not only the interests of Europe and the United States, but 
also some particular interests of certain European countries, 
are breaking over Bosnia. After NATO's intervention and the air 
strikes, the absurd accusation was issued that the B-H Army was 
shelling Serb positions. That is really absurd. The 
international community has bound us hand and foot by imposing 
the arms embargo against us so that we cannot defend ourselves. 
It has done the same thing to Gorazde, while at the same time 
doing nothing to protect the town, despite our warnings. The 
Gorazde zone is not only the town of Gorazde, but also the free 
territory of Gorazde, and at the time when the United Nations 
was speaking about peace in Gorazde, before the latest 
offensive, and when the town itself was not being so heavily 
shelled, our positions toward Ustipraca, Foca, Mesici, and 
Rogatica were being shelled. Which means that the focus of 
attacks was moved from the town of Gorazde to its surroundings. 
UNPROFOR and everybody else ought to know that the safe zone of 
Gorazde is much broader than the town itself, and it is supposed 
to be defended just as the town is. It is absurd to claim that 
the B-H Army, or the forces of the Eastern Bosnian Operative 
Group, were disregarding a cease-fire that did not even exist 
before the aggression. Obviously, this is an attempt to spread 
the blame again, which has produced very negative effects so 
far. We demand from the UNHCR and the international community 
to implement fully what they proclaimed with their resolutions. 
If they are not capable of doing that, they should say so 
publicly, and allow us to defend ourselves. I think it is about 
time that they did so. 
  [Cerimagic] Can it happen that a similar situation is 
repeated in Bihac, where the B-H Army controls some 30 km of the 
railroad from Knin to Banja Luka, which is of vital interest to 
the Serbs? 
  [Delic] That is already happening. Even now forces from the 
Knin Krajina, Banija, Lika, and Kordun, the regions pacified by 
the agreement between the Krajina Serbs and Croatia, are being 
brought in. All the relevant international factors engaged in 
the problem of former Yugoslavia have already been informed in 
time about these activities by word of mouth, as well as through 
letters. For instance, on Tuesday I told General de Lepresle 
and Mr. Akashi that uncommitted forces from the UN Protection 
Areas in the Knin Krajina were being redeployed in the Bihac 
region. Hardware and manpower are being brought in, while 
attacks against Bihac are being carried out even from within the 
UN Protection Areas. 
  Therefore, what I said about Gorazde also applies to Bihac. 
By using the UN Protection Areas, the aggressor wants to force 
the international community to intervene. Since the 
international community always looks for balance and culpability 
on both sides, it will try to reconcile the warring factions, as 
it puts it, thereby making the attacker equal to the victim, and 
to pacify the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina in such a way. 
One thing is for sure, however, that if the aggressor fails to 
capture Gorazde, that is, to freeze the situation on the ground, 
the same scenario will be played out in the case of Bihac. 
Tomorrow the same will be done in Srebrenica and Zepa. In that 
way they will force the Government of Bosnia-Herzegovina to 
accept the state of affairs on the ground, and start talks in 
which we would get the short end of the stick, that is, the 
conditions that we demand would not be fulfilled, and what we 
demand is the relinquishing of territories seized by force. 
  [Cerimagic] One can say that the aggressor is suffering 
military defeats as well. Their propaganda presented their 
defeat on the Maglaj front as an agreed withdrawal. Can you 
give us a short description of the action by our army? 
  [Delic] We had a very difficult situation in Maglaj, with 
which the international community was familiar. We demanded 
from the international community, and in the first place 
UNPROFOR, to help Maglaj, to have at least convoys with food 
reach the town. However, each time UNPROFOR was halted just 
before the town. In the end, we started an campaign to lift the 
blockade. We carried out operations inside as well as outside 
the ring. As part of the preparations for the final lifting of 
the blockade, the 201st Maglaj-Vitez Brigade liberated a 
considerable swathe of territory southwards, toward Ljesnica, 
and other regions, enabling us to come as close to our forces as 
possible. The same thing was done by other units in the 
territory controlled by the 7th South Operative Group. We also 
prepared a push from the direction of Doboj and Gracanica, while 
at the same time we were planning an operation for breaking the 
ring around the 7th South Operative Group. 
  Operations on such a scale cannot be planned, prepared, and 
carried out in a short time. By deliberately stretching the 
aggressor's forces and conducting raids our units broke through 
to the section where the 7th South Operative Group was to be 
unblocked. We threw in units of our 2d and 3d Corps. That was a 
huge amount of military force. We even planned to overrun HVO 
units if they obstructed our action. However, the situation 
that was brought about by the Washington Agreement created the 
opportunity for the HVO, if nothing else, to be passive and to 
let our forces through. The Serbian paramilitary formations 
already had intelligence reports on that. We have recordings of 
Serbian commanders demanding that their troops urgently pull 
out, in order to avoid being totally surrounded. Because if we 
had cut them off on the right bank of Bosna River, from 
Zavidovici to Maglaj, and on the other side from Novi Seher, two 
Serbian brigades would have been fully encircled. Their 
commander knew that. He demanded their urgent withdrawal, 
because it was a question of hours, rather than days. He sought 
a location to escape to, and he succeeded in finding one. That 
this is not mere boasting is shown by the results that we 
achieved later in the region. By deploying part of the forces 
that had liberated Maglaj, we also liberated territory toward 
Teslic, Doboj, and additional territories around Maglaj. All 
this proves that it was an excellently prepared military action, 
and I think it is high time that our people understood that one 
cannot instantly respond to attacks, as in the case of Gorazde. 
We are a serious army now. We have to plan seriously, work 
out, and then carry out operations. Time will produce an answer 
to the situation in Gorazde as well. Many serious things are 
happening to the Serbian aggressor in and around Gorazde. That 
town cannot be physically helped, but there are ways of helping 
it indirectly. And we are doing this. 
<H5>  [Box, p 17] </H5>
  [Cerimagic] The aggressor might not have dared to attack 
Gorazde again, if the Rogoj, Trnovo, and Grebak passage, 
thorough which the fighters and people of Gorazde were getting 
logistic support from the free territories, had not fallen last 
year. How could it happen that such a vitally strategic 
territory was so poorly defended, and eventually fell into the 
hands of the aggressor? 
  [Delic] One should know that it is a vast and rather 
unpopulated area. For that reason it was not possible for us to 
amass and deploy enough troops from the local population. The 
B-H Army has never had organized logistic support. Our army 
does not have any established logistic institutions, as is the 
case with the Serbian para-army that inherited from the Yugoslav 
People's Army everything that it needs. Throughout the war we 
have been organized in such a way that it is mostly local 
populations that defend their territory, while on Mount Igman we 
could not provide the manpower to defend such a vast territory. 
In such cases, when citizens start leaving, then the army also 
leaves. Unfortunately, this was the case in Trnovo. 
  In addition, the aggressor's propaganda had a great 
psychological impact. Of course, there were many individual 
mistakes up there on Igman. For a long time there was no 
fighting, so in such a situation a power struggle developed, 
while war profiteering and smuggling bloomed. In addition, at 
the time we had paramilitaries among our own army, various units 
that were outside the system. On Igman and the Grebak passage 
there were 10 or so units whose names were extremely flamboyant, 
but actually had rather few people, and were outside the single 
command and control network. We have even information that some 
of our people were working for the enemy. True, they controlled 
only smaller units, but when the investigation started, they 
fled over to the enemy side. Among them is Nijaz Zorbic, 
commander of the Silver Fox unit, who fled through 
chetnik-controlled territories, and is reportedly in Spain now. 
The investigation has shown that there are even more of such 
people, who arbitrarily withdrew their units from the front 
during the offensive.

<F P=106> [Interview with Netherlands Brigadier General G.J.M. </F>
Bastiaans, head of the UN military observers in the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia, by Marjon van Royen in Zagreb on 27 
April: "`Muslims Provoked Attack on Gorazde,' Netherlands UN 
General Says"] 
  [Text] Zagreb, 27 Apr -- "It was the Muslims who provoked 
the Serbian attack on Gorazde. The Serbs perhaps reacted 
`excessively.' But ultimately it was the Muslims who pushed the 
Bosnian Serb Army to the bloodbath of the civilian population of 
Gorazde with continual provocations." 
  This was said by Netherlands Brigadier General G.J.M. 
Bastiaans in his office in the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] 
headquarters in Zagreb. General Bastiaans is the head of the UN 
Military Observers (UNMO) in the former Yugoslavia. After the 
limited air strikes on a number of Serbian tanks around Gorazde, 
50 of his observers were taken hostage in the area by the 
Bosnian Serbs. 
  But that is not the reason, Bastiaans said, why he had so 
many questions about the eagerness of calls for tough action 
against the Serbs in recent weeks. "Dropping lumps of iron has 
consequences. The Serbs really do not think: Let us just accept 
this. Air strikes change the relations. They end the 
possibility of further negotiations. Anyone who had thought 
that this was not true, really is not of this world," Bastiaans 
said. 
  The general is convinced that there was a "propaganda 
campaign" around Gorazde by the Muslims. Everyone, including 
NATO, had walked into it with open eyes," he said. "They used 
all the parties," Bastiaans continued. "The Muslims provoked 
the Serbs with shootings and harassment to such a point that 
they had little option other than using the heavy weapons." 
  When asked whether he thought that action should be taken in 
Gorazde, Bastiaans answered: "That is perhaps what public 
opinion in the Netherlands and elsewhere in the world wants. 
But you must not forget the role played by the Muslims in the 
conflict. 
  Looking at it in purely military terms, the Muslims have 
superiority of numbers and a lack of heavy weapons. With the 
Bosnian Serbs, things are the other way around. Small arms 
fire, as used by the Muslims, does not appeal to public opinion. 
However, big bangs ringing in the ears of the civilian 
population certainly do. If, as was also the case in Sarajevo, 
you then ensure that the Serbs come under fire from within a 
city, they will respond. In so doing, you can be sure that some 
of the civilian population will be hit. That can then be filmed 
later on. And it is not very nice to look at. 
  When it comes down to it, the problem with the Serbs is that 
they overreact, that they do not dish out one big bang and then 
say that things are settled. As a result they play right into 
the hands of the Muslims." 
  [van Royen] What did the Muslims do to "provoke" the Serbs 
so 
acutely? Surely they are the injured party? After all, they 
are the ones shut up in the reservations we call "safe areas." 
  [Bastiaans] Yes, but the party on top can also be 
threatened. 
By and large, the Serbs have respected all agreements pretty 
well. It is just that time and time again they lose their cool 
whenever they are challenged. Not for nothing does the NATO 
communique contain that little sentence saying that the Muslims 
must also stop shooting. Officially, the Muslims in the safe 
areas must surrender their weapons. However, apart from in 
Srebrenica, this has never happened. 
  Besides military and political considerations, the Serbian 
attack on Gorazde is also tinged with a little bit of 
frustration. The Serbs offered to negotiate with the Muslims, 
but their offer was rejected. In the strip of no-man's land two 
km around Gorazde, the Muslims have been digging like mad. They 
are extending their trenches through that strip so as to gain as 
great an advantage as possible. That is one of the methods that 
is being used. You do not always have to start shooting to 
provoke someone. So if you now suddenly draw just a 20-km 
line, behind which the Serbs must pull back their heavy weapons, 
then militarily speaking you have done everything to benefit the 
Muslims. Compared with the situation as it was before, however, 
the Muslims now have actually surrendered some territory. On 
the other hand, you must not give the Serbs the impression that 
the Muslims have won out in all respects.

  [Excerpt] Warsaw, 28 Apr--After Thursday's meeting of the 
heads of the Council of Ministers Economic and Sociopolitical 
Committees, Deputy Prime Minister Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz told 
journalists that "the government will not give in to trade union 
demands expressed in the form of a diktat" because the 
government is responsible for observing the rules of a 
democratic state. 
  Cimoszewicz stated that he knows nothing about the drawing 
up 
by the government of a timetable for implementing Solidarity's 
demands, with the intention of presenting it to the trade 
unionists, as the strikers are demanding. 
  "Any kind of serious negotiations on any kind of demands in 
circumstances when strikes are continuing are hard to imagine," 
Cimoszewicz stressed. He announced that Prime Minister Waldemar 
Pawlak will put forward the government's position on the strikes 
in the Sejm on 29 April. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Warsaw, 28 Apr--During Thursday's talks between 
Industry and Trade Minister Marek Pol and the striking lignite 
miners, the unionists submitted their six demands. Three of 
these are of a nationwide nature; the other three apply to their 
branch of industry. The sides discussed demands put forward by 
industry branches as well as a timetable for further talks. 
  Late in the evening, following a meeting with Solidarity 
leader Marian Krzaklewski, the miners demanded that a fixed date 
be given for the coming into force of the Enterprise Pact. 
  Following Minister Pol's 26 April decision to cancel the 
restructuring of the lignite mining industry, the miners 
promised that they will deliver enough coal to power stations 
before 2000 on Thursday so that they will be able to generate 
power to about one-third of their total capacity. If the 
government fails to present a timetable for the implementation 
of Solidarity demands after that time, the unionists have warned 
that protest action will escalate. 
  Miners striking in the Belchatow and Turow mines have been 
delivering coal in the quantities agreed upon Tuesday, while 
awaiting the outcome of talks held in Konin, PAP correspondents 
were told on at 2200 on Thursday.

spokesman for the National Strike Committee of the Brown Coal 
Miners, told listeners of local radio station "66" in Konin that 
at 0620 the committee decided to suspend coal supplies to 
Belchatow, Konin, Patnow, and Adamow power stations. The 
spokesman explained that this was the result of prolonged 
negotiations with the government. According to Stasiak, the 
suspension of coal supplies also includes the so-called 
strategic reserves. 
  On Friday, the Turow brown coal mine in Turoszow suspended 
coal supplies for the local Turow power station. The strike 
committee at the mine told a PAP journalist that output of its 
power units would gradually decrease during the day.

<F P=106> [Article by Malgorzata Subotic: "Fight for Socialism"] </F>
  [Text] A campaign against the leftist government is being 
waged by those who want even more leftist solutions. This is how 
Economics Professor Waclaw Wilczynski evaluates the present 
situation. He adds that this is a fight for socialism. 
Sociologist Andrzej Rychard believes that both parties of the 
conflict are only seeking strategies of behavior and that their 
intentions are unclear. The opposition predicts that the Pawlak 
Cabinet will yield to the strikers and that economic policy will 
be decided by people in the streets. 
  "I do not believe that we might now be witnessing a mass 
social outbreak," states Zbigniew Siemiatkowski of the 
Democratic Left Alliance [SLD]. He adds that it would be absurd 
to compare the present situation to August 1980 because there is 
no one common idea that would be the guiding principle for the 
people. If we assume the very unlikely hypothesis that the 
strikes will cause the government and the prime minister to step 
down, the coalition of the Polish Peasant Party and the SLD 
would decide on "a new hand of cards." There will be no new 
elections because their result does not depend on the strikes. 
According to the SLD spokesman, the government should not yield, 
"in the name of responsibility." Otherwise, the country is 
threatened by a "black scenario"--a shattering of the budget, 
with all the consequences that entails. The demands of other 
groups would then escalate. 
  According to Mazowsze Solidarity ["S"] Chairman Maciej 
Jankowski, the government may decide on an option of 
confrontation. This would entail "breaking the force of 
employees, just as used to be done by communists and then by the 
liberals, for the sole purpose of remaining in power." However, 
"S" will not surrender. If the strikes continue for a longer 
period, they will be joined by the headquarters of the 
All-Polish Trade Unions Agreement because plant union 
organizations are already cooperating anyway. With such a 
scenario, we will witness a period of destabilization, with the 
participation of anarchist and semifascist movements. Jankowski 
does not want to try to predict whether the strikes will develop 
into a mass social protest. "If this happens, it will be 
possible to organize this wave of protest." Otherwise, it will 
turn into uncontrolled rage. However, the Mazowsze Region head 
does not rule out an optimistic solution: the establishment of a 
government commission that would define "a serious schedule for 
the implementation of union demands." "I do not know a person 
brave enough to try to predict what President Walesa will do," 
says Jankowski. Andrzej Smirnow, another "S" activist, in reply 
to the same question, merely says that he knows nothing about 
the president's talks with "S" leaders. However, he accuses the 
Pawlak government of taking over the viewpoint of Minister 
Miller, the policy of pushing "S" to the edge. 
  Will "S" prove effective? "The problem is that there is no 
alternative to the present government," Smirnow evaluates, and 
adds that there has been a serious political crisis in Poland 
for a long time now. Those who are in power are not prepared to 
steer the state; therefore, a new movement must be established. 
  "No matter how this conflict ends, we are incurring losses 
that practically cannot be made up," Prof. Wilczynski says. What 
is still more dangerous, however, is that the protest is being 
staged under the slogans of a return to communism to a state 
that is responsible for everything. 
  According to Deputy Jan Litynski (Union of Freedom), the 
strikes will force the government to make concessions but not to 
step down. What will be overthrown is not a workers' and 
peasants' government but a democratic system because economic 
policy will be decided in the streets and not in democratically 
elected bodies. 
  In Litynski's opinion, the current strikes are more 
dangerous 
than any strikes before them because "the negotiating area has 
been extended to the general policy of the state."

Andrzej Olechowski described the main directions of Polish 
foreign policy as security and Poland's relations with NATO and 
the West European Union, tighter relations with the European 
Union, a more active policy toward the East, and cooperation 
with neighboring countries. 
  Olechowski, who arrived at the Sejm to present the main 
directions of foreign policy to deputies from the Sejm Foreign 
Affairs Commission, said that these four priorities are of equal 
importance. The meeting is closed to the press. 
  The Sejm will debate foreign policy on 12 May. 
  Deputies will also discuss a draft statement on the revival 
of imperial and hegemonic trends in Russia.

<F P=106> [Article by R.W.: "Public Opinion Research Institute for </F>
RZECZPOSPOLITA; More Consent for Prime Minister Than for 
President"] 
  [Text] The number of people who agree with the way Prime 
Minister Pawlak is wielding power increased in April, while 
popular support for the governing style of President Lech Walesa 
decreased. Slowly but surely, the president has been losing 
support since March; the prime minister lost in March but 
regained popularity in April. These opinion polls are conducted 
for us by the Sopot Public Opinion Research Institute. 
  Each time the respondents had to answer questions under 
different circumstances: 
  In February, strikes were going on in Silesia; a huge 
demonstration, deemed "five km of Solidarity" by the papers, was 
staged in Warsaw; the coalition was just getting over the crisis 
ensuing after the resignation of Marek Borowski, finance 
minister and deputy prime minister. The president launched his 
legislative initiative to enable 100,000 citizens to submit a 
draft constitution, but the Sejm had not rejected it at the 
time. The results: The president's style was approved by 25 
percent of respondents, the prime minister's style by 36 percent. 
  In March, Pawlak left for Moscow on a visit that, according 
to many observers, was ill prepared; the president was 
ostentatiously taken aback by this visit. Dariusz Rosati had 
only just emerged as a candidate for the new deputy prime 
minister and finance minister, he was already accepted by the 
prime minister; the president had not taken a stand on that yet. 
The approval rating for the president 22 percent, for the prime 
minister 33 percent. 
  In April, the dispute over Rosati had been going on for many 
days; it was only unclear whether it was a conflict between the 
president and the coalition or between the president and the 
Democratic Left Alliance [SLD]. In only a few days, Walesa was 
supposed to meet with the SLD Parliamentary Club, as a 
consequence of which we witnessed an "armistice." The president 
had already vetoed the new popiwek [tax on excessive wage 
increases] and the gminas [smallest administrative units] 
councils electoral law; the budget was already signed. The 
prime minister started suggesting to unionists that there might 
be no new popiwek at all. In this situation, the way Walesa 
wielded power was approved by 20 percent of respondents; in the 
case of Pawlak, there was twice as much support. 
  The greatest support for the prime minister can be noted 
among elderly people, including senior citizens and disabled 
pensioners, those with elementary education, unskilled manual 
workers, housewives, and especially peasants, voters for the 
Polish Peasant Party and the Peasant Accord. Those who express 
the least favorable opinions are young people, including school 
and university students, educated people, well-to-do individuals 
living in big towns and cities, voters who supported the 
Liberal-Democratic Congress and the Democratic Union in the 
September elections. 
  Walesa's style meets with considerable approval among people 
over 60, election supporters of the Non-Party Bloc in Support of 
Reforms, Solidarity, and the Fatherland coalition. Slightly 
more-than-average approval is expressed by educated people 
holding managerial posts, but mainly because, in this group, 
there are seldom any problems with expressing an opinion. 
  The poll was conducted on 16 and 17 April on a sample of 
1,071 adult inhabitants of the country; a comparison was made 
with similar polls carried out in the middle of March and 
February.

<F P=106> [Interview with Marian Krzaklewski, chairman of the </F>
Solidarity Trade Union, by correspondent Barbara 
Madajczyk-Krasowska; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Madajczyk-Krasowska] The prime minister promised 
you that the government would withdraw its support for the 
proposed "popiwek" [enterprise tax on above-normative pay] act, 
but the very next day deputies representing the prime minister's 
party submitted a new popiwek bill to the Sejm's attention. They 
explained this move by saying that they did not consult with the 
prime minister on their decision because he left for Germany 
before they had a chance to talk with him. Do you feel cheated? 
  [Krzaklewski] The prime minister has made it clear to the 
whole of society, and not just us, that his declarations cannot 
be treated seriously. I do not know whether this scenario was 
actually preplanned--that is, whether the prime minister 
intended to announce the withdrawal of his support for the 
popiwek act in public one day, and to have his deputies submit a 
government bill for a new popiwek act the next, but, whether or 
not it was, this sort of strategy is dishonest and it 
compromises the government. It could also suggest that the prime 
minister has lost control of his own party and, by the same 
token, has lost his credibility with us. In any case, the point 
is not only that the National Commission was cheated, inasmuch 
as its members had left Gdansk with very little hope that a 
dialogue with the government was still possible. The National 
Commission regarded the prime minister's declaration with much 
reserve anyway, and it decided not to suspend the protest action 
while awaiting the implementation of the said declaration. 
Moreover, we never received a positive reply to any of our 
remaining stipulations. 
  [Madajczyk-Krasowska] Which ones? 
  [Krzaklewski] The ones concerning energy prices, taxation, 
citizens' enfranchisement, and a 40-hour workweek. In other 
words, stipulations mainly concerned with ensuring an increase 
in families' real incomes. It is inconceivable that we should 
have a situation in which the 1994 gross national product is on 
the increase, but the working people's family incomes keep 
falling. The government rejected our recommendations that energy 
price increases be reduced to the level of inflation. In a 
clever move, it spread the increases over three successive 
stages, which is why people have not felt their full effects 
yet, but, because of that operation, the increases will be 
higher than originally announced. Similarly, families have not 
yet felt the impact of the changed taxation bands. For example, 
people who earn a comparatively large amount will soon enter the 
second taxation band. If, as a result of the "married couple" 
assessment of tax liability, which includes their spouses, it 
turns out that their income tax does not exceed the 33-percent 
threshold, they will still not get back the advance 
payment--reduced by the inflation rate--until the second quarter 
of the following year. Because of this kind of regulation, we 
demand the chance to assess family incomes on a current basis, 
determining from such assessment which families should be 
automatically receiving family income supplement. Social unrest 
is increasing, and, if it does not explode today, it is bound to 
in August or September, with greatly magnified force. 
  [Madajczyk-Krasowska] But is your stipulation to enfranchise 
society not belated and unrealistic, in any case? After all, 
workforces of enterprises under privatization receive their 
allocated shares according to the terms and provisions of the 
"Enterprises Pact." As a result of this form of privatization, 
many employees become millionaires, not to say billionaires. 
  [Krzaklewski] Like the night guard at Bank Slaski. The 
enfranchisement demand is not belated and is still perfectly 
relevant today. People feel the injustice of the uneven 
opportunities more and more acutely. Those citizens who have the 
luck to be working in enterprises that are being 
privatized--even if the privatization is of a pathological 
nature--have a chance of becoming richer than they were before. 
Others, who have been contributing to the creation of the 
state's assets, have no such chance at all. 
  [Madajczyk-Krasowska] Those who have received their shares 
will not give them back now. 
  [Krzaklewski] Their shares should be treated as prepayment 
on 
account of the universal privatization scheme. If they exceed a 
certain set limit, they will get no more shares in the future. 
We want to see 50 percent of the inventoried State Treasury 
assets distributed among all citizens in the form of 
privatization bonds. After two or three years, the owners will 
be able to exchange the bonds for shares in banks and companies 
or, for example, use them to purchase homes within company 
housing schemes. Certain preferential terms should be reserved 
for employees of the privatized enterprises because they had 
taken an active part in the creation of their assets. 
  [Madajczyk-Krasowska] But such decisions require fundamental 
changes in the entire system. 
  [Krzaklewski] Indeed, the system does need to be changed. 
  [Madajczyk-Krasowska] If Solidarity-based governments failed 
to introduce significant changes in the system, how do you 
expect the present postcommunist parties to do it? 
  [Krzaklewski] I most emphatically deny that they were truly 
Solidarity-based governments. They were governments composed of 
people who had once belonged as members to the Solidarity trade 
union, were experts attached to it, or were otherwise associated 
with it on political grounds. These people created their own 
political parties, with specific programs and ideologies. But 
they should not be associated with a trade union. None of these 
parties has ever realized the Solidarity program. It is high 
time to put an end to the formulation "Solidarity governments." 
Let me remind you that, if you do not count the resolution in 
support of the president in the election, Solidarity has never 
officially resolved to promote or sponsor the authorities in 
power after 1989. 
  [Madajczyk-Krasowska] What about the "protective umbrella" 
extended over the first Solidarity-based government? 
  [Krzaklewski] That was an umbrella over the whole of Poland. 
After all, as early as 1990, there were several dozen strike 
actions, and, in the following year, their number grew to 
several hundred. Through the end of 1993, we had more than 1,000 
strike actions. Would you still maintain that we were extending 
a protective umbrella over the government? Remember that we 
started coming out in protest much earlier than the 
postcommunist trade unions. 
  [Madajczyk-Krasowska] Rumors circulating among certain 
Solidarity activists have it that the latest demonstration and 
the wave of recent strikes were inspired by President Lech 
Walesa. 
  [Krzaklewski] This is arrant nonsense! The last time I had 
any direct contact with the president was before the Zielona 
Gora congress. 
  [Madajczyk-Krasowska] But, during the Warsaw demonstration, 
the Solidarity leadership did its best to ensure that the 
marchers did not go to the Belweder. 
  [Krzaklewski] We did not want to dilute our action by 
introducing a whole variety of issues and slogans. We wanted to 
show that our goal was to secure increases in families' incomes. 
In the past few days, the president interpreted our protest 
correctly. His veto of the popiwek act was not exclusively a 
gesture in the direction of private companies. It came as a 
result of pressure exerted by our union, and that is why we 
expressed our thanks to the president. 
  [Madajczyk-Krasowska] Meanwhile, the Nonparty Bloc in 
Support 
of Reforms [BBWR], which is the president's organization, has 
been boasting that it was the first to support your strike 
actions. 
  [Krzaklewski] The first organization that offered us its 
support was the center-right parties' secretariat. However, we 
would like to be effectively supported by politically strong 
parties--and these are lacking at the political center and on 
the right. Consequently, we are waiting for a strong party, 
whose program and ideology will not be at odds with Solidarity. 
I am afraid that we might have a long wait ahead of us. 
  [Madajczyk-Krasowska] It so happened that Professor 
Zbigniew Religa, BBWR chief, offered to represent you 
politically before your meeting with the president. What are you 
going to answer if, say, the president promises to supports your 
demands but, in return, stipulates that you support him in the 
presidential election? 
  [Krzaklewski] We cannot even consider such an eventuality, 
and we will not enter into any political compacts with 
anyone--not even the president--because we are not a political 
party. All we can do is negotiate a certain contract on the 
basis of which the president would support our demands. On the 
other hand, making promises of support for the president on 
behalf of all of our members would be dishonest of us. People 
will support him but only when he has fulfilled their 
expectations. We would be very glad to see the president achieve 
successes because people would then live a better life. 
Recently, we learned that, apart from the right to veto 
parliamentary bills, the president has a rather limited range of 
powers because a peculiar hegemony of two parties has arisen in 
parliament, and this enables them to approve virtually any bills 
they want. 
  [Madajczyk-Krasowska] It was members of the public who chose 
them. 
  [Krzaklewski] But the same number of people voted for the 
parties and political groups that are outside parliament now. 
Does Mr. Kowalski, who voted for the groups that did not pass 
the parliamentary threshold, have different constitutional 
rights from Mr. Nowak, who voted for the parties that passed the 
5-percent threshold? 
  [Madajczyk-Krasowska] In that case, why did the leaders of 
the former groups, including also Solidarity, not give Kowalski 
a chance by creating a joint coalition? After all, the National 
Trade Union Accord [OPZZ] did enter a coalition with the 
Democratic Left Alliance [SLD]. 
  [Krzaklewski] Before the election, we campaigned for 
creating 
a block of combined votes in favor of the Solidarity electoral 
list, but each of the possible parties was convinced that it 
would obtain the required 5 percent of votes on its own. It is 
also worth remembering that some parties were hostile to us. To 
tell the truth, the only offer of support came from the 
president. 
  [Madajczyk-Krasowska] But you rejected it. 
  [Krzaklewski] That was in order to demonstrate that 
Solidarity as a union will not enter into any political compacts 
with any party or parties. If we did, it would be a decision of 
grave consequences for a union as pluralistic as ours. On the 
other hand, the BBWR electorate is in the main associated with 
the liberal and neoliberal orientations as regards the economy. 
  [Madajczyk-Krasowska] What political and economic system do 
you want? 
  [Krzaklewski] We want a system that will combine market 
economy with cooperation and that will constitutionally 
guarantee a dialogue between social partners, a dialogue 
conducted according to the rules of social solidarity. You could 
provisionally call it a market-and-social-solidarity system. 
  [Madajczyk-Krasowska] Is that not a utopian vision? After 
all, this world is marked by conflict between groups of opposing 
interests. 
  [Krzaklewski] They come into conflict and thus drag the 
world 
into a crisis. Nowadays everybody is asking what kind of system 
we should have. 
  [Madajczyk-Krasowska] People have always asked this 
question. 
We know that only a democratic system based on political parties 
can withstand major crises. 
  [Krzaklewski] Are we in Poland supposed to copy the mistakes 
made by those who refuse to put their efforts into creating a 
more stable political system, in which the principle of social 
solidarity would be the rule? 
  [Madajczyk-Krasowska] Do you suggest a third way? 
  [Krzaklewski] Yes. World confederations of trade unions are 
of a similar opinion, too. Such a program was presented by 
Solidarity at the latest World Labor Organization congress. 
  [Madajczyk-Krasowska] Who is supposed to realize it? 
  [Krzaklewski] It must be written into the constitution of 
the 
Third Republic. 
  [Madajczyk-Krasowska] Do you sometimes dream of a return of 
Solidarity as it was in 1980? 
  [Krzaklewski] There will never be another Solidarity like 
that because the situation is very different now. At that time, 
we were fighting to regain our national independence and to 
return to fundamental moral values. We were involved in the 
creation of a democratic system that would not be dominated 
solely by the free market and monetarism but would include 
ethical values. 
  [Madajczyk-Krasowska] Do you know even one country where 
moral values are placed at the top of the agenda? 
  [Krzaklewski] In other words, you mean paradise. Even if we 
cannot build such a paradisiacal country in this world, that is 
no reason to give up our hopes and ambitions. We must strive to 
improve the system, and we must protect people from being 
marginalized because otherwise they will cease believing in just 
and fair political and economic action and become irresponsible. 
After all, neofascist groups are already beginning to gain 
momentum in both the West and the East. 
  Poland and other postcommunist countries are now facing the 
risk of building a capitalist system on the basis of dishonestly 
accumulated capital. A significant proportion of present 
businessmen are people who amassed their wealth only because 
they were, for example, communist functionaries or financial 
criminals who escaped being caught and brought to justice after 
1989. If such negative tendencies prevail in the future, we will 
move in the direction of the system of capital oligarchy--that 
is, the stage South American countries had attained in the 
1950's and 1960's. Seventy percent of national assets will be in 
the hands of 10,000 or so citizens. We are at this moment at the 
crossroads of a struggle for our system. 
  [Madajczyk-Krasowska] How do you propose to introduce a 
better system? With the help of strikes, demonstrations, or 
perhaps a revolution? 
  [Krzaklewski] We want to change the law and make a clean 
break with the legislative system obtaining in the Polish 
People's Republic [PPR] as well as the consequences of that 
system; we also want to enfranchise all citizens. We believe 
that there is a need for a decisive break with the previous 
system by means of such moves as, among other things, the 
introduction of a vetting law and a decommunization law, which 
would condemn past structures instead of people. 
  [Madajczyk-Krasowska] You blame all mistakes on 
Solidarity-derived parties, but, at the same time, you form very 
extensive coalitions with them for the purpose of local 
self-government elections. Is your anticommunist crusade 
supposed to justify even those coalitions you form with the 
parties that previously tried to restrict your rights? 
  [Krzaklewski] We do not form coalitions but, at the most, 
enter into contracts in support of individual candidates. On the 
whole, Solidarity Trade Union does not take part in its own 
right in local self-government elections. 
  [Madajczyk-Krasowska] When are you going to meet with the 
president? 
  [Krzaklewski] The date of our meeting depends on the 
president's choice. We regret that the president signed the 
Budget Act before meeting with us; many of our stipulations 
could be realized through complementary budget-related 
parliamentary acts and regulations. We wanted to explain to the 
president that it is not at all necessary to introduce 
fundamental changes in the budget in order to meet our demands. 
  [Madajczyk-Krasowska] Do you have an alliance with the 
president? 
  [Krzaklewski] We do not. We have formal relations with him. 
  [Madajczyk-Krasowska] Will you allow yourselves to be 
exploited by the president? 
  [Krzaklewski] You cannot view our meeting with the president 
in terms of one side losing and one side gaining in the 
exchange. It is the country that is supposed to gain. That was 
what we were talking about during our meetings with the 
president last year. 
  [Madajczyk-Krasowska] What if the president were to dissolve 
parliament in fulfillment of his threats? Would you support him 
then? 
  [Krzaklewski] The president cannot dissolve parliament just 
like that, on his whim. 
  [Madajczyk-Krasowska] What if he were to resort to the use 
of 
power? 
  [Krzaklewski] That would be tantamount to fascism! We will 
not lend support to such moves even in relation to a parliament 
led by communists. The democratic system must be respected even 
if it has given birth to an "ugly duckling." After all, we have 
fought for that system--and we are still fighting for it.

  [Excerpt] Tomorrow morning President Lech Walesa will hand 
Grzegorz Kolodko his act of appointment to the post of deputy 
prime minister and finance minister. Professor Kolodko was 
already a candidate for finance minister during the creation of 
Waldemar Pawlak's Cabinet last fall. He relinquished 
participation in the government at that time because the 
economic program he presented was not accepted by the whole 
coalition. 
  [Unidentified Correspondent] Prof. Kolodko, who already took 
part today in a meeting of the Council of Ministers' Economic 
and Social Committees, said that he identified with the 
government's position on the strikes and the neopopiwek 
[wage-control law]. 
  [Begin Kolodko recording] I never was an advocate of the 
neopopiwek, but I always was and remain an advocate of a tough 
anti-inflation policy. The government will shortly be proposing 
solutions that will, after acceptance by the trade unions, serve 
to protect real wages, which the prime minister spoke about, and 
here the issue of the popiwek, the neopopiwek, should be seen in 
the proper perspective. [end recording] [passage omitted]

CSO 

    [Editorial Report] In an effort to reduce long traffic 
delays on Poland's borders and to combat the country's smuggling 
problems, the new head of the Main Customs Office (GUC), 
Ireneusz Sekula, plans to undertake "legislative, technical, and 
organizational changes" that will modernize the office and 
increase efficiency, according to a report in the Warsaw weekly 
GAZETA PRZEMYSLOWA I HANDLOWA (GPiH) of 8-14 March. Sekula, a 
member of the SdRP (Social Democracy of the Polish Republic), 
was labor minister and deputy prime minister in the governments 
of Zbigniew Messner and Mieczyslaw Rakowski, respectively, 
during the 1980's. In an interview in the Warsaw daily TRYBUNA 
(17 March), Sekula elaborated on details concerning his "new 
strategy" for the customs office. 
  According to TRYBUNA interviewer Cezary Rudzinski, the 
customs office is the fourth-largest revenue source for the 
state budget, providing over 98 trillion zlotys (Z) to the 
budget last year from customs fees and taxes collected on 6 
million customs clearances and postal packages. Office expenses 
amounted to Z1 trillion. Sekula estimates smuggling losses of 
$1-3 billion. According to the GPiH, last year alone customs 
officers uncovered 16,200 smuggling attempts, twice as many as 
in 1992, with the confiscated goods--mostly cigarettes, alcohol, 
and cars--amounting to approximately Z2 trillion. Through 
modernization and increased efficiency, GUC hopes to increase 
revenues to the state budget by minimizing payments lost to 
smuggling. 
  Sekula sees the first order of business to be in the 
legislative arena. GUC, in agreement with the Ministry of 
Foreign Economic Relations, has prepared a draft of "temporary 
changes" to the existing customs law, presenting it to the 
Economic Committee of the Council of Ministers (KERM) in March, 
with the expectation that it will be reviewed by parliament 
during the current term and be passed "still this year." In the 
TRYBUNA interview, Sekula describes three major changes proposed 
by the draft: 
  1) All border crossings will be subject to the central 
management of GUC. As it stands now, management of individual 
border crossings is relegated to the voivodships in which they 
are located, resulting in uneven management, with some 
voivodships "having neither the inclination nor the money to 
manage them" adequately. The proposed changes would allow GUC 
to organize "a financial consortium to build and manage border 
crossings." 
  2) Many "anachronistic regulations dating back to the 
1960's" 
that actually limit the legal authority of the customs 
inspectors need to be eliminated. Instead, the draft law 
proposes the establishment of a General Customs Inspector (GIC) 
and "customs police," with the "necessary legal authority" to 
function effectively. When asked to further clarify the role of 
the customs police, Sekula attempted to assuage the anxiety 
reflected in the question by emphasizing that the customs police 
"by no means" is meant to be a "gendarmerie watching over the 
customs officers." Rather, its role "above all" is to uncover 
smuggling and also to prevent it, making it more risky and, 
hence, less profitable. To that end, the customs police would 
not only inspect the consignee and check documentation, but also 
"inspect the provenance" of goods for sale in stores, wholesales 
firms, warehouses, and street stands. 
  3) Sekula intends to appeal a recent decision by the 
Constitional Tribunal that views the collection of "processing 
and handling fees" (oplaty manipulacyjne) by the customs service 
to be a "fine" because the discontinuation of such fees would 
"severely limit" and even "paralyze" the functioning of the 
customs service. In particular, he views these fees as 
necessary to the wage fund, allowing GUC to pay its customs 
officers better. Last year alone, GUC collected Z645.6 billion 
in processing and handling fees, with over half of this amount 
going to "bonuses and awards." Without such fees, the average 
monthly salary of a customs officer would be only Z2 million 
(about $100), adding to the chances of smugglers "corrupting" 
customs officers. 
  A "no less important issue" is that of modernizing the 
technical equipment of the customs service, a project that 
Sekula estimates would cost $40-100 million, an amount that 
neither GUC nor the state treasury is in a position to finance. 
"Specialized firms," including IBM and ICL [the British 
computer firm International Computers Limited], have been 
invited to bid for the position of "systems operator" of this 
project. The systems operator--two may possibly be chosen--will 
have its initial investment returned, "with a profit," by 
charging the customs service a "fee" for the use of the system. 
In turn, GUC will save administrative and equipment costs and 
will be able to collect fees faster. It is expected that the 
system will be speeded up by using scanners that will read "any 
type of customs document," including SAD (the Standard 
Administrative Document of the EU [European Union], increasingly 
used in Poland) into the system and that this "will tighten the 
borders" throughout the country. The "brain" of the system, 
Sekula insisted, "will remain in Polish hands, in GUC." 
  Another technical innovation discussed by Sekula is 
satellite 
monitoring "of all trucks transiting Poland," required because 
of the frequency, as noted by the TRYBUNA interviewer, of trucks 
"disappearing somewhere in Poland"--a reference to increased 
reports of theft, hijacking, and the smuggling of goods. Sekula 
would also like to see the transiting TIR (the highly-regulated 
European "International Transport of Goods by Road" trucking 
system) vehicles placed on rail lines, a procedure that would be 
inititated "beyond Poland's borders"--for example, at bases in 
Magdeburg and near Berlin. Trucks would thus be "protected" on 
their way from Germany to Brest (in Belarus) or Medyka (near 
Przemysl, on the Ukrainian border), and drivers would be able to 
rest. According to Sekula, the Germans "are extremely 
interested in using rail lines for these trucks, but the 
drivers "from the east" are against it, "mostly because they 
receive a per diem of 35 German marks" and thus profit from the 
delays in the current system, "whether they are driving or 
waiting in line" to get through customs. 
  Sekula also discussed the issue of modernization and 
personnel expansion. Even though there are at present 
approximately 100 border crossings and 300 customs posts 
throughout Poland, employing about 10,600 people in the central 
and voivodship administrations, Sekula said, about 2,000 
additional customs officers will be needed to assure a faster 
and fairer customs service. The border-crossing posts require 
rebuilding and modernization costing Z1.2 billion annually, 
which he expects will be funded by the financial consortia that 
would eventually earn "profits for the services rendered." A 
program for rebuilding the border crossings "is in place." 
Commenting on such efforts to modernize the service, the 14-18 
March GPiH argues that "one dollar invested in strengthening the 
structure, including the hiring of new customs officers, is 
returned twice over in the form of greater returns of customs 
fees."

  [Text] Hrvoje Sarinic, head of the Croatian delegation for 
talks with Serbs in the occupied areas, and head of the state 
delegation for relations with the UNPROFOR [UN Protection 
Forces], has sent a letter to Yasushi Akashi, the UN secretary 
general's special envoy, concerning the results achieved in the 
implementation of the 29 March cease-fire agreement and problems 
in this connection, as well as the normalization of 
Croatian-Serbian relations on the entire territory of the 
Republic of Croatia. The letter reads, inter alia: 
  The main precondition on which the talks were based was that 
the cease-fire agreement was only the first step toward the 
normalization of relations, after which talks were scheduled to 
take place on the opening of roads, oil pipeline, long-distance 
power lines -- i.e. on the normalization of the economic 
situation. The final part of the talks concerns the political 
solution: The inclusion of UNPA's [UN Protected Areas] in the 
legal and economic system of Croatia. The sovereignty of the 
Republic of Croatia has never been called into question and that 
was the clear and resolute stand of the international community. 
  In keeping with the cease-fire agreement, the Croatian side 
has so far implemented all points of the agreement within the 
agreed deadline. The Serbian side failed to fulfill numerous 
obligations that it took upon itself -- we single out the 
withdrawal of heavy weapons and the separation of forces -- and 
it rejected the work of the police, in accordance with the 
proposal of UNPROFOR's civilian sector. 
  All this goes to show that only a small part of the 
agreement 
has been implemented and that its key points have not been 
implemented in full. For this reason the UNPROFOR could not say 
that the implementation of the agreement was proceeding well and 
that both sides had a positive approach to and a desire to 
implement it. 
  In response to our frequent demands that the agreed 
obligations must be met, the UNPROFOR asked us to be patient and 
give the Serbian side time. In our assessment the Serbian side 
has been stalling the implementation of the agreement 
intentionally, ultimately wishing to avoid its obligations. The 
key tasks laid down in the agreement were not implemented by the 
time of the last session of the joint delegation, held on 23 
April. 
  An agreement on the place where the new meeting is to be 
held 
has not been reached either. The Serb side has put forward as 
its condition for resuming negotiations the abolition of a part 
of a UN Security Council resolution regarding the supervision of 
imports and exports of goods on the occupied territories of 
Croatia. 
  Even though the official representatives of the Croatian 
authorities have been trying to create a favorable climate for 
negotiations, the Serb representatives have been creating 
extreme tensions. In addition, they have been trying to equate 
the cease-fire agreement with the settlement between the two 
states, their goal being the Cypriotization of the Republic of 
Croatia, Hrvoje Sarinic writes in his letter to Yasushi Akashi, 
adding that Martic, Mikelic and others have been speaking about 
the need to open up the process of succession, about access to 
the sea, a corridor to Hungary, Slovenia, and so on. 
  Their demand that meetings be held only on the border 
between 
the occupied and the free areas or abroad is also indicative. 
There are no indications today when the next meeting could be 
held, even though we proposed that negotiations may be held in 
Knin, Plitvice, or in any place in Croatia. 
  We are aware of the connection between the situation in 
Bosnia- Herzegovina and behavior of the Serbs living in the 
occupied areas of the Republic of Croatia, but we are also 
convinced that such behavior and arrogance should no longer be 
tolerated and that there will be no positive results until the 
international community has forced the Serbs to comply with the 
resolutions and agreements that they have signed, not to flout 
everything and make a mockery of everybody and not be punished 
for it. 
  From our viewpoint, the establishment of the supervision of 
borders, as envisaged by UN Security Council Resolution 769, is 
a condition without which it is impossible to bring the 
situation back to normal and create conditions for the 
resolution of the crisis, as links between Belgrade and Knin are 
stronger than ever before.

  [Text] Croatian President Dr. Franjo Tudjman received Peter 
Galbraith, U.S. ambassador to Croatia, in the Presidential 
Palace today. President Tudjman told Ambassador Galbraith that 
the examination of proposals and negotiations on signing an 
agreement between the Croatian Government and the U.S. 
Government on economic and technical aid, to be granted to 
Croatia via the U.S. Agency for International Development, which 
is a constituent part of the State Department, should 
immediately be embarked upon. The agreement is expected to be 
signed at the beginning of May. 
  Ambassador Galbraith informed President Tudjman of his 
country's intention to begin negotiations on certain concrete 
projects immediately after the agreement has been signed. He 
also told him that an agreement on agricultural cooperation to 
the value of $10 million will be signed at the Croatian Ministry 
of Finance. President Tudjman expressed his pleasure at the 
progress achieved in talks between the National Bank of Croatia 
and the Croatian Finance Ministry on the one hand, and the World 
Bank and the IMF on the other, that have been held in Washington 
over the past few days. 
  President Tudjman and Ambassador Galbraith also discussed 
the 
situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the UN protected areas [in 
Croatia], a statement from the president's office says.

  [Excerpts] Russian Ambassador to Croatia Leonid 
Kerestedzhiyants has paid a visit to Gospic. Krunoslav Prpic 
has prepared a report on his visit: 
  [Prpic] Ante Frkovic, prefect of Lika and Senj, and Gospic 
Mayor Ivan Blazevic informed their guest about the war 
destruction. [passage omitted] Speaking about the 
implementation of the Zagreb cease-fire agreement, the 
ambassador of the Russian Federation said, among other things: 
  [Begin Kerestedzhiyants recording] I feel responsible, in a 
way, for the agreement and for how the withdrawal and the 
implementation of the tasks laid down in the agreement are 
proceeding. I paid a visit some 10 days ago to the so-called 
Krajina. I spoke with the commander of the Canadian battalion 
there. I know that the Croatian side has not created any 
difficulties. There have been no complaints to be addressed to 
the Croatian side. However, I know that there are a number of 
questions related to the implementation of that agreement by the 
Serbian side. We hope that the negotiations will be resumed in 
the Russian Embassy. I know that there is also readiness on the 
part of Knin for expert talks to be held. I am ambassador to 
Croatia within its internationally recognized borders. I state 
this openly, even when I go to Krajina. I can say that 
sometimes this angers them. Sometimes it passes normally 
because this is true. It is a fact; it is an historic truth. 
[end recording] 
  [Prpic] The ambassador toured some places along the 
separation line in order to see where the Zagreb agreement has 
not been fully implemented.

<F P=106> [Interview with Stipe Mesic, president of the Croatian </F>
Parliament and founder of the Croatian Independent Democrats, by 
Edita Vlahovic; place and date not given: "We Are Not Causing a 
Crisis But Strengthening Croatia"] 
  [Text] [Vlahovic] Have you left the Croatian Democratic 
Community [HDZ]? 
  [Mesic] No, not yet. 
  [Vlahovic] Is it not unusual that, while you are not only a 
member of the ruling party but one of its leaders, you are 
founding a new party? 
  [Mesic] Our membership will formally be canceled when we 
found the party and when party documents are adopted at the 
constituent assembly. 
  [Vlahovic] After Josip Manolic's replacement, you said you 
feared that a large number of people would be persecuted on all 
levels and in all HDZ structures. Has it come to that, and if 
it has, how extensive is it? 
  [Mesic] Fortunately, it has not yet come to major 
persecutions "on the vertical level," but there is roll calling. 
Unfortunately, there have been unprecedented provocations 
against Josip Manolic, president of the Chamber of Counties, 
like those in the darkest Stalin period in Russia. Among those 
who spoke up was the German HDZ Youth, which declared both 
Manolic and myself bolshevik criminals. They even resort to 
name calling. Meetings in villages and towns at which Manolic 
is exposed are in full swing. Something like that is not 
customary in democracy, but here, after confronting opinions, 
there is public lynching. Therefore, we often go back to 
totalitarianism. 
  [Vlahovic] Apart from Mr. Manolic, are other deputies also 
under pressure? 
  [Mesic] All deputies suspected of joining myself and Joza 
Manolic are being interviewed and questioned at present. 
  [Vlahovic] Who conducts those interviews? 
  [Mesic] Members of the presidency and the party president 
himself. 
  [Vlahovic] After the discussion on Manolic, has the HDZ 
Presidency talked about your dismissal, too? 
  [Mesic] They never discussed it, but it is not difficult to 
conclude that it was just a matter of time when they would put 
the subject on the agenda. I was the one who was attacked 
first. Remember, they suggested that I leave the country so they 
could finish some discussions, which I allegedly hindered. I 
refused to do so and said the only thing I would do would be to 
go on vacation. I could make that concession, as I underwent a 
minor operation in the meantime and returned to work a month 
later. Naturally, people think I would agree to a kind of 
sinecure, but I did not become politically active with that in 
mind. My goals are much bigger and I cannot be bought by 
sinecure. 
<H5>  Tudjman Is Neither a Leftist Nor a Rightist </H5>
  [Vlahovic] What is actually the reason behind your conflict 
with President Tudjman? In your opinion, is President Tudjman a 
leftist or a rightist? 
  [Mesic] He is neither a leftist nor a rightist. He likes 
authoritative power and thinks he can lead a party in a 
bureaucrat-like manner, but that is impossible. A party is a 
living being and cannot stand that kind of leadership. 
Therefore, those of us who have been in the party since its 
establishment are not satisfied with that kind of party 
leadership. We wanted the HDZ to be a party that would realize 
our program goals and become a democratic party that can discuss 
all questions and that the decision of the majority be 
implemented. 
  [Vlahovic] At what point did President Tudjman start to 
deviate from those program principles? 
  [Mesic] When he started to interfere in all institutions of 
the system, from the parliament to the judicial system. 
Dictatorship is introduced by attacking institutions. We want 
to defend institutions -- in other words, democracy. 
  [Vlahovic] Who, in your opinion, influences the politics of 
President Tudjman the most? 
  [Mesic] Probably someone close to him. I have not been 
close to him in about two years, so I do not know who is the 
most influential. I think the president himself is the man, for 
his vision of democracy is something that objectively is not 
what he thinks it is. 
  [Vlahovic] Do you think they will attempt to dismiss you 
from your position as president of the parliament? 
  [Mesic] I do not know what they will attempt to do, but the 
issue of the ratio of powers in the parliament will be settled 
right there. The way in which they went after Manolic was one 
of the causes for my reaction. When, at the session of the 
party presidency, we decided without voting -- I repeat, without 
voting, for they keep claiming it was a unanimous decision, and 
there was no ballot whatsoever -- to pass the case of Manolic on 
to the court of honor, they should have done that. That would 
be a democratic procedure. However, to telephone the parliament 
to begin that action, right after or even during the session, to 
collect 36 signatures that very day, that is Bolshevism at its 
peak. 
<H5>  New Relations in the Parliament </H5>
  [Vlahovic] Parliamentary crisis is obviously mounting. Are 
you going to cause early elections? 
  [Mesic] No, that is not the issue. This is all about new 
relations in the parliament, which does not necessarily mean 
early elections. This is not about the president of the 
republic either. He has his constitutional authority and he must 
do it, but those of us in the parliament have our constitutional 
authority as well. Therefore, this will only strengthen the 
autonomy of the parliament and democracy. There is no reason 
for early elections, especially since we accept and support the 
program of the government. 
  [Vlahovic] How will the founding of the Croatian Independent 
Democrats influence the HDZ? 
  [Mesic] Some members of the HDZ who are not satisfied with 
the implementation of original principles of the party will 
surely join us or, to be precise, they will stay true to those 
original principles, for they are our starting point. 
  [Vlahovic] What kind of reaction do you expect from the 
state officials -- for example, from President Tudjman? 
  [Mesic] I expect more sensible politics, especially as it 
has turned out, in the case of Josip Manolic, that parliament is 
unlike any other institution. I hope that the president and the 
people who advise him will realize that the question of 
relations in the parliament is one thing and the question of 
other institutions is quite another. Relations in the 
parliament cannot be settled by extra-parliamentary games. 
  [Vlahovic] A part of the public, especially some political 
parties, fear this could lead to a dictatorship. 
  [Mesic] There will be fewer of those fears after this, for 
we are about to prove that we are a pluralistic and democratic 
society and that democracy has deep roots here. 
  Warmongers Safe in Their Seats [subhead] 
  [Vlahovic] Are you counting on the support of the 
opposition? 
  [Mesic] HDZ leaders have been trying to convince our 
representatives that many members of the opposition will now 
join the HDZ. We will see. 
  [Vlahovic] What do you think? 
  [Mesic] I think that is wrong information. 
  [Vlahovic] Do you think there is a connection between the 
announced large number of strikes and those political 
developments? 
  [Mesic] No, but we predicted it would come to that. By 
means of monetary technology, we curbed inflation and reached 
the point where we must increase production and involvement of 
capital. Furthermore, to be involved in a war, which we are 
supporting in this or that way -- it is quite clear that we 
supported the Herzegovina Croats in their conflict with the 
Muslims -- this unnecessary and absurd war, which brought 
nothing but death and destruction to both the Croats and the 
Muslims, to finally sign the agreement on confederation. And 
now to interpret this as a natural consequence is an offense to 
all those who were involved and paid a high price for the war. 
We must say how much the war cost, where the money from sold 
apartments and companies goes, and where the money given by the 
Croatian emigration is. For I know very well that some 
countries offered to give us weapons for free, and was it 
necessary to purchase and pay a high price for something we 
could get for free? We could get weapons from countries that 
support us, provided we stop the conflict with the Muslims. 
However, the conflict kept escalating. 
  And now, some people in Bosnia-Herzegovina who initiated the 
conflict between the Croats and the Muslims are firmly holding 
their positions and are probably trying to thwart the Washington 
agreement. 
<H5>  We Must Find Out Where the Money Went </H5>
  [Vlahovic] You mentioned the money given by the Croatian 
emigration with regard to embezzlement several times. Do you 
have any clue, or perhaps even proof, of how the money is being 
spent? 
  [Mesic] We know that the least amount of funds went to 
economic processes and programs. We must find out where the 
money went. 
  [Vlahovic] According to Prime Minister Valentic, Croatia is 
now at the most critical stage of economic stabilization. Do 
you think those stormy developments on the political scene will 
influence the implementation of the stabilization program very 
much, and if so, how? 
  [Mesic] The very process we are initiating will enable the 
world to trust Croatian democracy a bit more. We are not trying 
to cause a crisis; we want to strengthen Croatia as a 
law-governed state. Then Croatia can also be a serious partner 
to foreign investors. 
  [Vlahovic] You said you supported the government's policy, 
but President Tudjman strongly supports Prime Minister Valentic, 
too. Have you also contacted the prime minister? What is the 
position of the government in this situation? 
  [Mesic] Yes, I talked to the prime minister on Tuesday [19 
April] as well. There should be no crisis in the government. 
We must give it all our support, provided that this process of 
democratization wins us some foreign capital and investments. 
That is our way of helping the government. 
  [Vlahovic] With regard to your views on transformation and 
privatization, do you think the government is closer to your 
views or to politics created by President Tudjman? 
  [Mesic] The government has taken a first step toward 
denationalization, and it was those HDZ hawks that made it take 
the subject off its agenda. We demand that the process of 
denationalization be addressed, that people be given back what 
is rightfully theirs, and also, regarding tenants, that they be 
protected and put on an equal level with everyone else. It is 
possible to do all that, if we start with new economic projects 
and if we immediately sell all military-owned and other 
apartments and allocate those funds to the construction of new 
apartments. 
<H5>  Avoiding Essential Problems </H5>
  [Vlahovic] You have mentioned hawks again. Who are those 
people? Are they in the state leadership? 
  [Mesic] Yes, those are the people who think problems can be 
solved by means of some palliative measures. They are obviously 
avoiding the essential problems more and more. 
  [Vlahovic] Does your leaving the HDZ mean that the ruling 
party now overwhelmingly holds that it is impossible to reach a 
political compromise between the Croats and the Muslims and 
preserve the integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina? 
  [Mesic] There is something I cannot grasp. Some people -- I 
will not name them but they know what I am talking about -- 
harbor an illusion that they can negotiate the division of 
Bosnia with Milosevic and then solve Croatian problems. There 
cannot be any agreement with Milosevic regarding the division of 
Bosnia. It would result in a chain reaction; there would be new 
aggressors, and the world will not allow that. The only way out 
is to form an alliance with the Muslims and those Serbs who 
support the integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina and then to make an 
agreement with that state as with any other state. 
  [Vlahovic] In his reply to President Tudjman, Manolic 
mentioned organized crime in Herzeg-Bosna and the fact that it 
is supported by some Croatian institutions. Who are those men? 
  [Mesic] That is difficult for me to say. The institutions 
that are involved in that must say so. Today we can only talk 
about what we see is happening. If people buy enormous amounts 
of fuel that cannot be spent by Herzeg-Bosna, that means that 
they are selling it to someone else. Therefore, it is a chain 
reaction, but it is not up to me to determine what this is 
actually all about. 
<H5>  To Attain Autonomy of the Parliament </H5>
  [Vlahovic] As president of the parliament, what prevented 
you from initiating the establishment of parliamentary 
commissions that would examine those phenomena that were also 
discussed in the parliament? 
  [Mesic] The parliament and its commissions of inquiry cannot 
as yet be efficient, for they must be regulated by law. Such a 
law is now being drafted and I believe it will soon be adopted. 
We tried everything so that the parliament, apart from its main 
function as a legislative body, can also act as a controlling 
body, and by means of parliamentary committees, we are trying to 
influence all institutions to implement regulations brought by 
the parliament. I do not want to undermine the responsibility of 
the parliament, but considering the pressure we have been under, 
it has not been easy to attain autonomy of the parliament. 
  [Mesic] Your group has demanded that the right wing of the 
HDZ leave. In your opinion, which people should not be in the 
political leadership? 
  [Mesic] We are no longer asking anyone to leave. We are 
leaving instead. 
  [Vlahovic] Can you comment on the position of Croatia and 
the prospects for implementing the Washington agreement after 
the fall of Gorazde? 
  [Mesic] Obviously, there have been some secret agreements 
and underhanded deals. The fall of Gorazde is nothing but a 
conspiracy against the sovereignty of Bosnia-Herzegovina. We 
will probably find out who was involved, but now we must use all 
available means and international mechanisms to make the 
international community finally commit itself on who is the 
aggressor and take steps against it. There have been many 
victims in Bosnia-Herzegovina, but there will be even more 
victims if one allows the division of Bosnia- Herzegovina. 
Gorazde is the final lesson for the international community to 
take action. 
  [Vlahovic] You said that for some two years now, you have 
not been in the circle that creates the politics of the ruling 
party. Therefore, you have not agreed with the politics of 
President Tudjman for two years. Why did it take you so long to 
go public about that? 
  [Mesic] I did not participate in making decisions, but I 
have been trying through various party and state mechanisms to 
influence Croatian politics in the country and abroad. I 
thought it possible to set it straight, but now we realized that 
if one cannot have an open and honest discussion within the 
party about problems that will tomorrow be much more topical 
than they are today, then we must act in this way. 
<H5>  [Box 1, p 3] </H5>
<H5>  International Support </H5>
  [Vlahovic] Which members of the opposition did you contact? 
  [Mesic] Leaderships of all parties, but for one reason only: 
to convince them that we will not tread on their political 
ground. We respect their programs and their membership. We do 
not want to see some uncontrolled processes happen. We want 
those parties to keep their space, to become even stronger, to 
the benefit of Croatia. Our action also aims to strengthen 
Croatian democracy. Croatia comes first for us. But what kind 
of Croatia? Democratic, social, human Croatia, in which human 
rights will be protected. Croatia in which crime and mafia 
cannot survive. 
  [Vlahovic] Do you have international support? 
  [Mesic] The world still supports democratic processes, and 
this is an absolutely democratic process. We will be absolutely 
supported by the world. Those who advise the president to 
strike at democratic processes are not working for the benefit 
of him or Croatia. 
<H5>  [Box 2, p 3] </H5>
<H5>  Where Is the Money Emigration Gave Us? </H5>
  [Vlahovic] Conflicts in the HDZ have been noticeable for a 
while. Why solve them at this very moment? Why are you forming 
a new party right now? 
  [Mesic] We had no other choice. We tried to settle this in 
the party by discussing all problems, which are evidently 
present in the society. We put all that on the agenda. 
However, the party, or better yet the president, disregarded 
that. We must have an honest discussion, but if that is not 
possible within the party, then we will do it in public, for the 
public is the best judge. We must say whether we are satisfied 
with the transformation or not. Nowhere in the world could the 
rumor about 600,000 German marks of state funds to purchase an 
apartment for a minister so he could then buy it for 40,000 
German marks hold. Where will those state officials who will 
succeed the present ones live? Judging by the results of the 
present ones, I am not sure they will hold on to their positions 
for very long. And finally, there is the question of funds 
provided by our emigration. Those are enormous amounts of money 
about which the parliament knows nothing and neither does the 
Croatian Government. Those funds are in foreign banks and we do 
not know who controls how and why they are spent. Croatian 
emigration and the public must know where the money is. 
  [Vlahovic] Could that not be discussed in the ruling party? 
  [Mesic] No, that was strictly a taboo. 
<H5>  [Box 3, p 4] </H5>
<H5>  Who Is Responsible for the Politics Toward Bosnia-Herzegovina </H5>
  [Vlahovic] You said there were indications that the 
Washington agreement will not be implemented. Who will fail to 
do so? What will be the consequences? 
  [Mesic] It is not that some will fail to do that, but I am 
certain that some are trying to block the Washington agreement. 
They appear to be supporting it, but are actually working 
against it. They will not succeed in that; they will only 
manage to compromise themselves and the people they represent. 
  [Vlahovic] Can you tell us who is the creator of the 
politics toward Bosnia-Herzegovina that lead to founding 
concentration camps for the Muslims, destruction of the Mostar 
bridge...? 
  [Mesic] The Croat-Muslim conflict was harmful for both 
nations, but it did not do much good for the Serbs either, for 
they thought the world would tolerate the aggression. In 
fighting against each other, the Croats and the Muslims suffered 
heavy casualties, and now everyone is friends again now that 
they have signed the agreement. That means it should not have 
come to the war in the first place. The problem was in bringing 
the political decision to confront the Muslims. Who is behind 
whom? I do not know. When Josip Manolic criticized Gojko Susak 
-- for he was in charge of Bosnia-Herzegovina, he went there, we 
did not -- and, after all, we could see on television who was 
photographed together: Vice Vukojevic and Gojko Susak, it is not 
difficult to conclude who supported which option. However, 
President Tudjman allowed no criticism and, in his address in 
the Club of the HDZ Representatives, he took responsibility for 
that politics. 
<H5>  [Box 4, p 4] </H5>
<H5>  Susak Is Incompetent </H5>
  [Vlahovic] At the latest session of the Parliament, Minister 
Susak and his responsibility for the explosion in Duboki Jarak 
was in the focus of discussion. What do you think about the 
demand of the opposition to reconsider the question of his 
political responsibility? 
  [Mesic] Commissions in charge of that matter will definitely 
reach certain conclusions, and judicial authorities will make 
corresponding decisions. However, this is a matter of political 
responsibility of the person who organizes the work and rules of 
behavior in the army, and that is the Defense Ministry. We know 
who is in charge. When it comes to such extent of damage and 
such heavy casualties, then it would be honorable for the 
minister to offer his resignation; whether it will be accepted, 
that is another matter. I do not insist on that, but I insist 
that Susak offer his resignation. One million of inhabitants of 
Zagreb were in question, and the explosion could have spread to 
the nearby chemical plant and gas installations. There could 
have been unpredictable consequences, and our minister did not 
interrupt his visit to Herzeg-Bosna, a sovereign state, and we 
know he did not go there in cooperation with the Sarajevo 
authorities, and he did not come to the sight of the explosion 
nor did he return to his ministry. Ask him where he went. 
  [Vlahovic] To what extent is Minister Susak responsible for 
such politics? 
  [Mesic] I do not think he knows how responsible he is, 
because he is not competent enough for the job. Let us face it, 
he cannot do the job. 
  [Vlahovic] Who should answer this question, then? 
  [Mesic] The supreme commander, of course.

  [Text] Croatian Assembly Chairman Stipe Mesic left for 
Brussels this morning to attend a two-day working conference of 
international parliamentarians which will discuss justice and 
progress as bases for peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Prior to his 
departure for Brussels to attend the conference, which is to be 
held under the sponsorship of Egon Alfred Klepsch, chairman of 
the European Parliament, Mesic said he will present to the 
conference a Croatian proposal that the international community 
return to its principle of the inviolability of borders. This 
principle will secure an undivided Bosnia-Herzegovina, while the 
occupied areas in Croatia will be fully reintegrated into its 
legal and constitutional system. Bosnia-Herzegovina should be 
demilitarized, and also Serbia, which presents the worst danger 
for this part of the world. President Mesic also said he will 
meet parliamentarians from a number of countries in the course 
of his visit to Brussels.

    [Editorial Report] While Croatian Government 
representatives have hailed the agreement on the cessation of 
hostilities and separation of forces signed with the Krajina 
Serbs in Zagreb on 29 March as a "step toward normalization of 
relations on the entire territory of Croatia" (Zagreb VJESNIK 31 
March), the reaction of most Croatian opposition parties to the 
agreement has been considerably more cautious and even negative. 
  In a statement to VJESNIK that appears in the paper's 31 
March issue, Croatian Social Liberal Party [HSLS] President 
Drazen Budisa says that, while he had not yet have a chance to 
review the document, his party supports "efforts for the 
peaceful reintegration of the UN Protection Areas [UNPA] but 
does not see how this can be achieved without changing the 
UNPROFOR mandate. Budisa believes that, under the present 
conditions, the cease-fire agreement between the Croatian 
Government and the Krajina Serbs offers "no guarantees" that 
displaced persons will be able to return to their homes or that 
Serbian paramilitary groups will be disarmed. The HSLS insists, 
Budisa says, that the effects of ethnic cleansing must be 
reversed. 
  The 7 April VJESNIK carries a report on a news conference 
held the previous day by five opposition parties -- the HSLS, 
the Croatian Peasants' Party, the Istrian Democratic Assembly, 
the Croatian National Party, and the Social Democratic Party 
[SDP] -- at which they demanded that all political talks with 
representatives of Serbia be halted until: 
  -- "Serbia and Montenegro recognize Croatia within its 
internationally recognized borders, terminate logistical and 
political support for the Serb insurgents, and withdraw the 
Serbian dinar [as the official currency] from the occupied 
territories." 
  -- "The Serbian Army and Serb insurgents cease ethnic 
cleansing and criminal attacks on Croatian settlements and the 
insurgents accept the solution of their political demands within 
the Republic of Croatia, in accordance with the principles of 
the Constitutional Law on Human Rights and Freedoms and 
international documents on the rights of national communities." 
  The five opposition parties also demanded the closing of the 
Croatian Government Bureau in Belgrade and its Serbian 
counterpart in Zagreb and made the extension of the UNPROFOR 
mandate conditional on the protection of the Croatian borders 
with Serbia and Bosnia-Herzegovina and the implementation of the 
UN Security Council resolutions. 
  Zdravko Tomac, chairman of the SPD Council, told reporters 
that one consequence of the Zagreb agreement would probably be a 
"long-term solution modeled on Cyprus" and that "everybody who 
remains silent about it" would bear a "historic responsibility," 
VJESNIK reports. 
  Savka Dabcevic-Kucar, head of the HSN, said in an interview 
published in Zagreb VECERNJI LIST on 11 April that, while she 
welcomes "any step" leading to a cease-fire, negotiations, and a 
"just peace," she is "reserved" and "skeptical" and considers 
the agreement "unfavorable" because it appears to "sanction the 
present situation." In her opinion, the most important issues 
have not been resolved: The "occupying army" and the Croatian 
Army are treated identically; the Croatian state is not even 
mentioned in the agreement; the "Pink Zones" are not excluded 
from the agreement, and the return of displaced persons has not 
been defined. She also asks why the "questions of aggression" 
had not been raised and states that the "only positive thing" 
resulting from the agreement might be the cease-fire. 
  The 9 April VJESNIK reports on a news conference held on 8 
April by the Croatian Christian Democratic Union [HKDU], at 
which its secretary, Dr. Milan Bicanic, enumerated the 
shortcomings of the Zagreb Agreement, stating that the aggressor 
was not named, "which raises the question whether this is an 
agreement on separation or delineation of the opposing sides," 
and that the "dynamics" for the reintegration of the occupied 
territories into the Croatian constitutional and legal system 
had not been established. HKDU President Dr. Marko Veselica 
found fault in the government's approach to the talks with the 
"Serb rebels" and felt that the cessation of the war was being 
discussed in a manner that "destabilizes Croatian military power 
and creates a defensive strategy." Ilija Rkman, the party's 
executive secretary, mentioned the danger of a "Cyprus 
solution." The official party statement carried in the 13 April 
VJESNIK added that the agreement does not mention Croatia as a 
sovereign and internationally recognized state and fails to deal 
with war crimes, the punishment of war criminals, and war 
reparations. 
  The 9 April issue of the same paper contains a statement by 
Croatian Christian Democratic Union President Ivan Keglevic, who 
proposes that, in addition to the present negotiators, Croatian 
refugees from the Krajina should be authorized to negotiate with 
the "Serbian rulers" in the UNPA, because the refugees "would 
know much better how to facilitate returning to their homes." 
  The Socialist Party of Croatia issued a statement, published 
in the 1 April VJESNIK, which welcomes the agreement, describes 
it as "the first step toward the establishment of the 
territorial integrity of Croatia," and concludes that, 
apparently, "the two sides had not been able to achieve it 
without maximum engagement and pressure by the international 
community, especially the United States and Russia."

<F P=106> [Article by Edvard Popovic: "Hello, the Director Here"] </F>
  [Text] Both Vrdoljak and Bolkovic are more 
interesting as Croatian media cliches than as individuals or 
personalities. Both of them entered the program directly, not as 
listeners or viewers, but rather as directors, and for both of 
them the telephone has been a remote control. 
  The intervention at Radio Sljemen, the electricity cutoff 
for 
Youth Television [OTV], and the blocking of an announced 
Croatian Television [HRT] broadcast during the past 10 days have 
caused an uproar among the Croatian public. In the first 
incident, Antun Vrdoljak, by telephone, in the ether--the 
occasion is completely meaningless--resolved with broadcast 
director Zvonko Sebo things that are usually resolved in 
editorial staff meetings. In the second case, OTV's program 
director, Romano Bolkovic, used the telephone to try to "shut 
off" Nightmare Stage [in English as published] director Zeljko 
Malnar, and when he failed, the electricity in the studio was 
shut off and thus the broadcast was interrupted. In the third 
case, the elements of the "game" are well-known: the broadcast 
(Latinica), the director (Denis Latin), and the guests (Mile 
Dedakovic Jastreb and Tomislav Mercep), while the one who one 
shut it off is so far unknown. Actually, the names of those who 
shut it off (the censors) are not even important here--in this 
case both Vrdoljak and Bolkovic are more interesting as Croatian 
media cliches than as individuals or personalities. Both of 
them, in fact, "entered" the program directly, but not private 
persons, i.e., as "ordinary" listeners and viewers, but rather 
as directors of the media in question, and both of them used the 
telephone not as a means of communication, but rather as a 
remote control. 
  The idea of the media as a means of control and manipulation 
is as old as the media themselves. In this sense, the harshest 
critics do not view the media as a "window to the world," but 
rather as a blind in that window, which the owners raise or 
lower to the extent that it suits their overall and current 
interests. That is precisely the thesis on which Zeljko Malnar 
built his nighttime show on OTV. Nightmare Stage, with its lack 
of restraint and informality, destroyed the very foundations of 
television as a means of controlling and manipulating the 
masses. Malnar did not offer answers and finished opinions, but 
instead raised questions and forced people to think. 
<H5>  Provoking Vanity </H5>
  Malnar's ultimate goal in provoking personal and national 
vanity ("You Are Ugly and Stupid," or "One Should Love All 
People Regardless of Their Color, Race, or Religion, Which Is 
Quite Difficult If You Are a Pure-Blooded Croat") was probably 
not to insult, but rather to install a "mirror of reality," 
which would offer a picture the opposite of the one offered by 
the "big" state media. Even though it then went to the opposite 
extreme, Malnar's nighttime "nightmare" on OTV can also be 
interpreted as a sort of group psychotherapy for, generally 
speaking, the frustrated "populace." Perhaps he did not even 
"expand horizons," but in any case, by raising the veil from 
people's eyes, provoking and insulting, he destroyed the 
embellished, retouched picture of reality for which the 
"strictly controlled" media were responsible. 
  Without going into how much whiskey Malnar had inside him on 
the night when his show was cut off (which is also part of 
destroying the ordinary, "sober" image of television directors), 
or the extent to which he "crossed the boundaries of good 
taste"), for which Bolkovic is criticizing him, it seems that 
that is not the hitch. OTV officials knew, or at least could 
assume, what they had gotten when they "bought" Malnar. In fact, 
Malnar crossed the boundary of good taste in the bourgeois 
interpretation of that concept at the moment when he publicly 
called his guest or viewer on the telephone line a fool, but he 
has done that for a long time. Seeking the boundary of that 
taste in measuring the specific seriousness of the concepts of 
"fool" or "idiot," as the OTV program director is trying to do, 
is only a good way to cover up the essential thing. That is that 
Malnar has considerably overturned a medium, that he used it to 
show something else, the ugly face of our reality and ourselves, 
and in order to shove that picture in the faces of everyone who 
watched Nightmare Stage, thus committing an unforgivable media 
sin--he did not play up to the vanity of the viewers, but 
instead, in a way peculiar to himself, activated their critical 
capability, and forced them to think. Bolkovic formulates it 
this way: "I am criticizing him because he turned an 
entertainment broadcast into a political one, because he was not 
paid to present his political opinions. He is here to entertain 
people, and not to insult them, and therefore he has to 
distinguish independence from anarchy." 
<H5>  Turning Off the Disobedient </H5>
  Consequently, who is it that will "turn off" the disobedient 
child of the Croatian media? Is it an institution that is a 
throwback to the former cat paws of the political power centers, 
or is it the adult, enlightened viewer (reader) who can do it by 
pressing the remote control, i.e., ceasing to buy this or that 
news? In Malnar's case, judging by his show's audience 
(unusually large for its slot), the viewers are not the ones who 
pressed the remote control button, the one that brings darkness. 
It was done by an institution that was least interested in an 
enlightened, mature public, which can hardly be manipulated. 
  In this case "stopping Malnar" and all the other similar 
cases in the media world are almost superfluous, unnecessary 
steps. The Croatian media's influence upon public life is 
insignificant, and almost nil. For example, we do not remember 
when any article or radio or television program that provided 
arguments and documentation in favor of "removing" some forms of 
public life or individuals from public life has initiated 
change. In the last few years, the pages of newspapers have been 
full of examples of violations of the Constitution and positive 
legal regulations, theft (illegal acquisition of property), war 
profiteering, the abuse of one's position, crime.... In an 
insignificant number of cases, the articles have been denied. In 
most cases, people acted according to the logic that articles 
live until the last issue, and they counted, not without reason, 
on their being forgotten. It was rare that they were followed by 
any official investigation, resignation, or explanation; people 
rarely were held responsible for the consequences. 
<H5>  Role of the Loudspeaker </H5>
  In that sense, the blocking of the scheduled HRT broadcast 
Latinica, in which the first commander of the Vukovar defense, 
Mile Dedakovic, and the controversial Mile Mercep were to 
appear, was completely superfluous. In view of the series of 
ambiguities and contradictory information about the defense of 
Vukovar, about the role of individuals in its defense, one can 
assume what the topic of conversation would have been. It is 
equally possible to assume that on that occasion a lot of what 
is colloquially called "dirty laundry" would have been 
presented, which actually does not mean anything more than facts 
that mental hygienists claim are not suitable for the average 
Croatian ear. By "turning off" the above-mentioned guests, the 
mental hygienists indirectly and probably unconsciously, but 
very precisely, indicated what kind of media they would like. 
  In any case, they would not like media that would be 
responsible to the public and for which true, honest journalism 
would be the foundation and only reason for action, and not even 
journalism that would "dabble in" awkward topics and write 
critically, without calculations, because, it seems, this is not 
the right time or the right moment. Unfortunately, a 
considerable portion of the media have consented to the role of 
a loudspeaker, recognizing, in the chain of responsibility, only 
responsibility upward. In that kind of distorted division of 
roles, anything is possible. It is thus even possible to turn 
telephones into remote controls, which at the same time "turn 
off" journalists and directors, and lower the blind on the 
"window to the world."

  [Text] Skopje, 26 Apr (TANJUG) -- Macedonian [Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] President Kiro Gligorov 
has returned from Sofia this evening following his first 
official visit to Bulgaria, and positively assessed his two-day 
"very open" talks with Bulgarian officials. 
  Gligorov said that two treaties on Skopje-Sofia cooperation 
that were to have been signed -- on the elimination of double 
taxation and the protection of mutual investments -- have not 
been signed because of the refusal by Bulgarian officials to 
sign these documents also in the Macedonian language. According 
to Gligorov, the Macedonian delegation deemed that the 
Macedonian language could not be a contentious issue and that 
the right of every nation is to call the language it speaks as 
it pleases. 
  However, President Gligorov expressed the hope that talks of 
this kind would gradually yield results. Gligorov also 
expressed the conviction that Bulgarian President Zhelev "has an 
understanding of this issue," but that "they should clarify this 
matter in Bulgaria on their own." 
  The Macedonian president also said that journalists at a 
news 
conference in Sofia were most interested in the possiblity of 
Macedonia joining a former Yugoslav republic or some neighboring 
state. According to him, this is an issue that has been decided 
once and for all, because Macedonia has become a free, 
sovereign, and independent country and no other option can be 
taken into consideration.

  [Text] Skopje, 28 Apr -- Industrial production in Macedonia 
declined 14 percent in the first three months of this year 
relative with the same period last year. Manufacturing was down 
25 percent, reproduction of materials 13.4 percent, and 
production of consumer goods fell by 6.3 percent. This was 
stated by Svetlana Antonovska, director of the Institute of 
Statistics, at a press conference in Skopje today. A drop in 
industrial production was recorded in 27 branches representing 
86.3 percent of the overall industrial production. A 
particularly sharp drop was recorded in ferrous metallurgy, in 
heavy machinery construction, in transport manufacturing, shoe 
and leather goods manufacturing, and in the printing, clothes, 
and food industries. 
  According to Antonovska, in the same period the value of 
construction works completed on the territory of the Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia dropped by 35.7 percent. During 
this period, Macedonia's exported $234 million worth of goods 
and materials, a drop of 13 percent from last year. At the same 
time, imports rose 8.7 percent, for a total value of $202 
million. 
  Further declines were noted in retail, catering, tourism, 
traffic and other sectors. Total employment fell by 6.8 
percent; overall, there are 404,786 people in the labor force. 
Unemployment increased 2.5 percent to a total of 178,789 
people. Retail prices rose 36.6 percent between December last 
year and April this year. Moreover, the cost of living rose 
43.9 percent, Antonovska said.

expenses also include all representative objects in the state. 
1.2 million German marks are set aside for the purchase of 
furniture and office equipment for the government and the 
representative objects. Part of these funds will also be spent 
on furniture in the former building of the Central Committee, 
where several ministries and government departments are now 
located. 
  The Ministry of Defense has a budget alimony of up to 120 
million German marks, the Interior Ministry 103 million German 
marks, the Foreign Ministry 6.5 million German marks, the 
Ministry of Finance 765 million of German marks (this includes 
the pay back of the former debts of the state), the Ministry of 
Social Politics 205 million German marks, and the Ministry of 
Education 228 million German marks. 
  The budget expenditure also includes 830,000 German marks 
for 
the purchase of new vehicles for the needs of the Interior 
Ministry. Last year, 1.1 million German marks were spent for the 
purchase of "Volkswagen Vento" cars.

<F P=106> [Report by B. Geroski: "Did Tirana `Turn its Back' on </F>
Taci?"] 
  [Text] After several months of turmoil within the PDP 
[Party for Democratic Prosperity] that resulted into a definite 
split and separation of the leadership headed by Djeladin Murati 
and the faction of Menduh Taci and Arben Djaferi, there appear 
to have been no major events within this party for some time. 
The PDP Central Assembly session of "continuity" and the 
unexpected and easily banned Tetovo meeting of Taci's faction 
did not point to any essential changes in the positions of the 
two wings. 
<H5>  Statement </H5>
  Nevertheless, last week an event that can be seen as a 
relevant change in the stance of official Tirana toward the PDP 
took place. At the meeting with the CSCE head of mission in 
Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], 
Norman Anderson, Albanian President Sali Berisha stated he was 
convinced that "with their participation in the government, with 
the loyalty that they demonstrated to the coalition, and the 
democratic methods that they have adopted for the consolidation 
of their human and national rights, the Albanians will always be 
the stability factor." In his discussions with Anderson, 
Berisha reiterated the struggle for the consolidation of the 
rights of the Albanians in Macedonia, for holding the census and 
so on, however, the definition of their participation in the 
government and the loyalty to the coalition as a factor of 
stability in the state (a long termed goal of Albania) can be 
seen as nothing but an implicit support to the delegate and 
ministerial PDP elite. 
  There are speculations that this new stance of Tirana, 
compared to the recent one by which it openly supported Taci's 
faction, caused serious confusions within the ranks of the 
faction. Now Tirana is moving Taci toward direct cooperation 
with the government, urging him to take actions within the 
institutional framework, which is totally opposite to the recent 
statements of the faction's leader. 
  If we have accurately registered the symptomatic and 
depressive words of the young Taci that he "has had enough of 
policy," then we can explain them only in the context of the new 
sounds arriving from Tirana. Namely, by everything that has 
been stated so far by this self-conscious politician, it is now 
really necessary to make a major in order to make the "big jump" 
and chart a new political course. 
<H5>  Determination </H5>
  After the definite statement of the competent bodies related 
to the "inheritance" of the PDP in favor of Murati's leadership, 
it became clear that Taci's faction does not have a chance of 
entering the elections unless it registers itself as a separate 
(new) party. For the time being, the faction does not have the 
will to do that, and even if it does, it will have difficulties 
registering due to its party program. The only chance of 
participation in the government and of making constructive 
efforts for consolidation of the position of the Albanians in 
Macedonia is by betting on the people of the 
delegate-ministerial elite. 
  Of course, Tirana will not make such a turn around and 
openly 
support the present team of Albanian politicians involved in the 
government (it is not out of the question, according to the 
"hot-cold" system, that we can be once again surprised by them 
if they give support to those who were, until only yesterday, 
their disciples). However, Berisha has openly supported those 
who participate and will participate in the government, probably 
aware that Taci has no chance of winning.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Genka Markova: "Reshuffle With Unusual </F>
Logic"] 
  [Text] Boyko Noev resigned as deputy minister of defense 
on military-political issues, and thus the first resignation of 
Berov's cabinet materialized on Monday [25 April]. 
  At about the same time, at the trade-political 
around-the-clock meetings related to reshuffling the cabinet, it 
was confirmed that a third deputy prime minister in charge of 
monitoring the so-called power ministries is being conceived. 
Thus it became clear that the demands of the forces that 
support the government have two main directions -- the first is 
directly related to the ministerial posts in industry and trade, 
the other -- to the army and certain aspects of our foreign 
policy. 
  The logic of the changes in the government really is 
strange. 
It puts the stress on the economic bloc and the power 
ministries, while at the same time the claims of the main 
political forces -- the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP], the New 
Alliance for Democracy [NSD], and the Movement for Rights and 
Freedoms [DPS] -- show beyond any doubt that it is the 
government's social policy that is the most vulnerable sphere. 
This government and this social minister -- Evgeni Matinchev -- 
did practically everything to stop the social dialogue with the 
trade unions and make it meaningless. In addition, the budget 
wages of 600,000 people were indefinitely frozen. The 
consumer-goods prices reached incredible heights. Matinchev and 
[Finance Minister] Stoyan Aleksandrov refuse to do anything 
under the convenient cover of market economy. By this, I mean 
market economy as they understand it. The experts remind us all 
the time that speculations have nothing in common with the 
market. However, it appears that this is not a sufficient 
argument to request the resignation of the first deputy prime 
minister, acting Prime Minister Evgeni Matinchev. 
  The so-called political consultations related to basically 
reshuffling the cabinet are actually not the expression of some 
striving to work out a new formula through which the country 
will really be ruled by a strong executive power. The basic 
goal of those consultations is to redistribute the ministerial 
posts so that they will correspond to the newly announced claims 
of the political forces that support the government. The BSP, 
DPS, and NSD are trying to hide all this behind certain 
tragicomic differences as to what Professor Berov will present 
at the National Assembly on 27 April -- first the program and 
the then the cabinet's structure, or the two things together.

<F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Valentin Aleksandrov by </F>
Simeon Danevski; place and date not given: "Valentin 
Aleksandrov: `I Am Not Afraid To Lose My Post....'"] 
  [Text] [Danevski] Mr. Aleksandrov, are you sure that a 
certain party is demanding your resignation? 
  [Aleksandrov] I have this impression, that my resignation is 
being demanded. 
  [Danevski] An impression is one thing; facts are something 
completely different. 
  [Aleksandrov] I do not have facts. Officially, no one has 
spoken with me on this matter. I learn everything from the mass 
media. Anyway, there will be nothing terrible if I leave my 
post. 
  [Danevski] Is your conflict with General Lyuben Petrov 
really so deep? 
  [Aleksandrov] There is no conflict at all. There was a 
dispute whether those officers who must retire should do this 
now or in the fall. 
  [Danevski] What was your opinion? 
  [Aleksandrov] I had the opinion that we should not touch 
them until the fall, or until the Defense Bill is enacted. 
  [Danevski] Do you accept President Zhelev's accusation that 
the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] is responsible for the small 
military budget? 
  [Aleksandrov] I cannot comment on this statement. 
  [Danevski] Is it true that you demanded a small Bulgarian 
Army? 
  [Aleksandrov] It is the parliament that determines the size 
of the Army. I only said that, with the amount of money we 
received, we can provide food, clothing, and footwear for only a 
certain number of troops. 
  [Danevski] If you think so, is there not the danger of 
having no army at all, because we do not have any money for it? 
  [Aleksandrov] This is none of my business. The minister of 
defense does not provide funds. He only spends them. 
  [Danevski] Did you want to create a mixed Bulgarian-Turkish 
battalion that would establish peace in Bosnia? 
  [Aleksandrov] A noted Bulgarian politician -- Mr. Pasi -- 
advocated the establishment of such a battalion. Do not 
attribute his ideas to me, especially since this is a matter for 
the unforeseeable future. I do not commit myself to such ideas 
and claims. 
  [Danevski] Perhaps he was only testing the idea? 
  [Aleksandrov] It is fully possible.

<F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Defense Minister Boyko Noev by </F>
Stiliyan Ivanov; place and date not given: "Structural Reforms 
in the Army Are Essential"] 
  [Text] [Noev] Allow me first of all to thank you for 
giving me a chance to express my views on issues that have 
become very topical lately. Regarding some of these issues, 
certain people have even directed personal accusations against 
me, charges that I consider neither fair nor correct. 
  [Ivanov] Is there any conflict between the civil Defense 
Ministry leadership and the General Staff? 
  [Noev] Certain differences do exist in our approaches to 
resolving the existing problems, but they are far from being as 
dramatic as some people represent. 
  The bitter pill of the budget served as a catalyst for 
speeding up the reforms. The need for reforms has been growing 
for several years and now it has reached a peak. All 
sociological studies show that tension has accumulated in the 
Army, and those who are charged with specific responsibilities 
in the defense field strongly demand that something must be 
done. The differences mainly concern the speed of the reforms. 
The delay in passing the new Armed Forces Act and the shortage 
of funds should not, in my view, provide pretexts for inaction. 
However, some action is already taking place, despite a certain 
cooling in relations between certain individuals. 
  In the final analysis, I personally regard the differences 
in 
views that are developing as a condition for more correct 
decisions. 
  [Ivanov] You are singled out for stating figures for 
redundancies in the Army that are not only arousing anxiety in 
the officer corps but also conflict with what Defense Minister 
Aleksandrov has said. Where does the truth lie, in your opinion? 
  [Noev] I have never publicly presented any figures on army 
redundancies, but the answers that I gave at the closed meeting 
of the Parliamentary National Security Commission have 
unfortunately been leaked in distorted form to the press. At 
the present moment we are only talking about retirements, and 
these moreover affect only very limited numbers of officers. 
Minister Aleksandrov lucidly explained what it is all about. 
There will be no pensioning of majors and lieutenant colonels 
before September, when the new structures and staffing levels, 
on which the General Staff is drafting a proposal, are to be 
approved under Article 71 of the Defense and Armed Forces Act. 
Later, the General Staff will propose which officers may make 
up the relevant staff levels and which not. Regarding officers 
with the rank of colonel, it must be made perfectly clear that 
there is no question of pensioning off military doctors -- about 
200 of them, or officers on the teaching staffs of the higher 
military educational establishments, or of suspending military 
education. Nor do the redundancies affect officers in leading 
posts with direct responsibilities for combat readiness and the 
functioning of the General Staff as "the Army's brain." There 
are only 83 such officers in all. However, of the 921 officers 
of pensionable age, excluding all those holding top positions, 
about 450 of them will remain in various other posts. They 
cannot in any way help to resolve the problem of the shortage of 
young officers at the lower levels of the hierarchy, at platoon 
and company level. The opposite is true. However, for 
inexplicable reasons, a certain person is fighting like a lion 
to keep them in military service, using all available means, 
including some criteria that I regard as dishonorable. This is 
being done to the detriment of army morale, at the expense of 
fellow officers, and, in the final analysis, at the taxpayer's 
expense. One asks: Why do this just now? Why not wait and see 
what happens? However, the other side may counter by saying: 
What is there to wait for? How long does one have to wait? Why 
put it off yet again? 
  Certain persons are also deliberately manipulating the 
problem of the monetary compensation that is envisaged. I can 
state quite categorically that funds for this exist in the 
budget. If a decision in principle is adopted, every colonel 
who goes into the reserve may receive 18 monthly salaries in 
cash, which means roughly 170,000 leva. Even after the 
deduction of tax, they will be left with a considerable amount 
of money for our conditions. This amount, if applied in the 
simplest way, can produce 5,000 leva a month in bank interest, 
Let the others say if this is "throwing people onto the 
street." However, ethical standards are also needed for this. 
This also forms part of the truth. 
  [Ivanov] What do you think about a 55,000-strong army? 
  [Noev] I have already told a large-circulation daily that 
this is an assessment made by a top military leader who was 
instructed to investigate what a fully combat-ready army would 
look like as regards personnel strength within the strictures of 
the 13 billion leva defense budget. I will have nothing to do 
with such quantitative assessments. Interestingly, however, 
they coincide with analyses made by authoritative specialist 
institutes. 
  [Ivanov] One has the impression that you are at 
loggerheads with the deputies in the Parliamentary National 
Security Commission. What are the reasons for this? 
  [Noev] I respect the deputies in principle. At sessions of 
the relevant parliament commissions I have been asked questions 
that I gave frank answers to, because I believe that the more 
clearly one defines one's position, the better is one 
understood. It is another matter whether every one of my 
answers was to their liking and whether my answer was the only 
right one. However, that is what discussions are for. I accept 
my partners in discussions as collaborators with whom we all 
resolve national security problems together, within the limits 
of our responsibilities. No one gains from shilly-shallying. 
  [Ivanov] What do you think should be done to improve 
officers' motivation? 
  [Noev] Two groups of factors mainly affect motivation: 
First, pay and living conditions, and second, the opportunities 
for professional and personal fulfillment. Regarding the 
former, everything is being done within the strictures of the 
budget, and pay will rise as the state's macroeconomic 
parameters improve. There are a number of possibilities for new 
decisions on social and everyday issues. We are working on 
them, including housing policy, and I hope to receive proposals 
soon. Regarding the latter, one of our top priority tasks is to 
adopt a principled cadre policy with clearly defined 
opportunities for developing a career and concluding it in a 
worthy manner. This is precisely what the Defense Ministry 
leadership is attempting, I emphasize attempting, to do right 
now. 
  The officer corps in sum total represents the most 
disciplined and educated stratum of our society, and serves as a 
bulwark for social stability. It is of key importance in the 
difficult conditions of the transition. The officers deserve 
recognition from society for this, and such recognition is 
itself a strong source of motivation for them. 
  [Ivanov] When will the structural reforms begin in the Army? 
  [Noev] They should start as soon as possible, and I believe 
that they will be to the troops' benefit. 
  [Ivanov] People have singled you out as President Zhelev's 
man in the Defense Ministry. What is your comment on this? 
  [Noev] The president has spoken with me on only one 
occasion. The conversation was brief, but very useful for me. I 
leave it to the observers to assess who is who's man. 
Sometimes, such assessments are put forward to achieve certain 
aims at a specific political juncture. 
  [Ivanov] To return to the issue of the UN convoy, who was 
right? 
  [Noev] On this issue we have many people who say they were 
right. As far as I am concerned, I think that I was right. In 
principle, this was a matter within the powers of the 
government, and I put forward my arguments to this effect in 
Parliament. Also right were those people -- which, in fact, 
included all the deputies, from all the political forces -- who 
said that, in the current specific situation, when public 
opinion is highly sensitive, this issue goes beyond procedural 
and technical considerations. Consultations should have been 
held in advance, to show respect for the right of every 
political force to state its position in a timely way in a 
constructive environment, without descending to the level of 
politicizing the issue. In my opinion, it was an important and 
useful lesson for everyone who had a connection with the affair.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dimitur Gotsev, former leader of the </F>
Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization-Union of 
Macedonian Societies, by Nadelina Aneva; place and date not 
given: "Border Between Macedonia and Bulgaria Should Have Been 
Formally Recognized Long Ago"] 
  [Text] Docent Dimitur Gotsev is a lecturer at the History 
Faculty of Sofia University and deputy president of the 
Macedonian Scientific Institute in Sofia. In 1990 the VMRO-SMD 
[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization-Union of 
Macedonian Societies] was restored and he was its leader until 
30 March 1992. He is married with two children and lives in 
Sofia. 
  [Aneva] Mr. Gotsev, despite the position adopted by the 
Parliamentary National Security Commission, the Ilinden OMO 
[United Macedonian Organization] is thinking of holding its 
usual convention at the Rozhen Monastery. Is the Bulgarian 
Government helpless in this case? 
  [Gotsev] The lack of any reaction by the Bulgarian 
institutions cannot be justified by ignorance, incapacity, or 
weakness in addressing this phenomenon. The Bulgarian people 
are clearly aware that people outside the country are forcing 
our politicians to tolerate this movement in Bulgaria. The 
so-called supporters of Ilinden appeared in public after 10 
November 1989. They are dangerous and at the same time pathetic 
because, despite their conspiratorial origins, they are capable 
of destroying our age-old traditions. 
  [Aneva] Who is responsible for our politicians' inaction? 
  [Gotsev] Before 10 November 1989 everything came from 
Russia, which prohibited and refused us leave us to tell the 
truth about the Macedonian question because it had its own 
specific interests in the Balkans. Today, this factor no longer 
exists, but the same policy continues to prevail, perhaps in an 
even more arrogant form. Nevertheless, Serbian provocation on 
such a scale, which denigrates everything Bulgarian and declares 
that Bulgaria is an occupier, never occurred on our territory 
prior to 10 November. 
  [Aneva] Where does VMRO stand in this situation? 
  [Gotsev] I think that VMRO is paralyzed and is unable to 
affect these events. I cannot otherwise explain how a hostile 
foreign organization has appeared to supplant it in the 
territory where it is active. 
  [Aneva] There are many VMRO organizations. Which is the 
true one? 
  [Gotsev] There is only one VMRO, and that is the one formed 
by Gotse [Delchev] and Dame [Gruev, cofounders of the first 
Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization in 1894]; all the 
others -- about a dozen of them -- are false. They are formed 
by someone or other and then disbanded when their lords no 
longer need them. 
  [Aneva] Were you replaced by a coup organized to change the 
line followed by the organization and to politicize it? 
  [Gotsev] I was in hospital when the announcement was made 
that I had resigned. I think that this was arranged by foreign 
embassies, and not only one, but two or three. 
  [Aneva] What do you think about the VMRO's intention to run 
in the next elections? 
  [Gotsev] At the very outset, when the VMRO was restored, 
some people had daydreams about turning it into a party, but so 
far it continues to maintain that Bulgaria has enough parties, 
and anyone who wants to enter parliament can do so through them. 
  Our movement is a national one, but has no political color. 
No one can close down the VMRO until it has completed the 
program outlined by Levski to protect and gather the Bulgarians 
in one place. 
  [Aneva] Is it a realistic prospect that Macedonia [The 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] may join 
Bulgaria? 
  [Gotsev] I was one of the first to advise President Zhelev 
that we should recognize Macedonia. There was then a chance 
that Serbian troops would withdraw from there without a fight. 
A referendum was held in which 96 percent of the people in 
Macedonia declared for independence. Only a historian can 
appreciate what a great event this was; it is one of the great 
successes in our modern history. However, out of ignorance or 
for other reasons, the Bulgarian politicians failed to use this 
event to the benefit of our all-Bulgarian national cause. 
  [Aneva] What should have been done? 
  [Gotsev] During these last three years they should have done 
everything possible to make the border between Bulgaria and 
Macedonia a formal one. If one talks about historic chances, 
God gave us such a chance after 100 years. However, to use this 
chance the people have to be prepared, and we turned out to be 
completely unprepared. Macedonia needed to obtain diplomatic 
protection throughout the world, but we failed them. We ought 
to have three railroad links by now: from Kumanovo to 
Kyustendil, from Kocane to Blagoevgrad, and from Gevgeli to 
Petrich. We did nothing to stop the anti-Bulgarian propaganda 
there. 
  [Aneva] It is your idea that we should have a minister 
solely in charge of Macedonian problems.... 
  [Gotsev] Greece has a special Ministry for Macedonia-Thrace. 
Over 2 million Bulgarians from Macedonia live inside Bulgaria 
and there are about another 3 million outside. At least one 
person in the Bulgarian Government should know where Macedonia 
is and promote all good initiatives connected with Macedonia. 
Before 9 September [1944, date of Bulgaria's liberation in 
World War II], the government always included people with actual 
and emotional connections with Macedonia. At that time, almost 
50 percent of the scholars and scientists in Bulgaria were from 
Macedonia, plus 50 percent of senior army officers, 50 percent 
of the higher clergy, and more than 50 percent of diplomats. 
Everywhere where it was necessary to defend the Bulgarian cause 
in Macedonia, the Macedonian Bulgarians were in the forefront. 
Accordingly, the Macedonian question was a Bulgarian one, and 
no one in the world doubted that it was anything else. At 
present, not a single Bulgarian in the state institutions and 
the top administration is publicly committed to the Macedonian 
cause. On the other side of the coin, during the last 50 years 
half the diplomats in Serbia came from Macedonia, and many 
people from Macedonia were recruited into their army, police, 
and all their higher state institutions. 
  With the help of a few hundred Bulgarians from Macedonia 
whom 
it has bought, Serbia is holding Macedonia in subjection, 
deluding the people into believing that Macedonians in fact rule 
them. [Greek] President Karamanlis comes from the village of 
Brodi in Aegean Macedonia, and Papandreou's first and second 
wives are also Bulgarians from Macedonia. Formerly, when Venko 
Markovski, who is also from Macedonia, published a new poem, a 
note was always sent from Belgrade and the newspaper editors got 
excited. Serbia and Greece did not allow film footage of 
Macedonia to be shown in Bulgaria, and our authorities fulfilled 
their wishes without question. It is the same thing now. 
  [Aneva] Nationalism is gaining quite good positions in 
Europe, so is it possible for the VMRO to play the nationalist 
card in Bulgaria? 
  [Gotsev] Nationalism does not exist in Bulgaria; it was 
destroyed long ago and its sting has been extracted. Today the 
Bulgarians have need of much patriotism, and we have to know 
what policies we are pursuing, so as not to hate a foreign 
nation for no reason. Why should we hate the Serbs and Turks 
for exploiting our ignorance? 
  [Aneva] Do you personally sympathize with Zhirinovskiy, and 
is a Bulgarian Zhirinovskiy possible? 
  [Gotsev] I do not think such a person can appear in our 
conditions, but it is more than necessary for a Bulgarian to 
appear to put things in order. 
  [Aneva] You mean a Bulgarian with a strong arm? 
  [Gotsev] I am not talking about a strong arm, but about a 
Bulgarian who knows how to govern the state. It can be an 
individual or a government, but it is high time that someone 
rescued Bulgaria from this humiliating situation. 
  [Aneva] Do you see any strong individual in either of the 
two main parties at present -- the SDS [Union of Democratic 
Forces] or the BSP [Bulgarian Socialist Party], or in any new 
party? 
  [Gotsev] In the state they are in at present, I do not see 
anyone. There may be suitable individuals among them, but they 
should come forward. 
  [Aneva] Who in Macedonia would offer his hand to them? 
  [Gotsev] At the present, only culture and cultural links can 
bring us finally together. In Macedonia there is a strong 
intellectual movement that a month ago formed its own 
organization, the Movement for Cooperation Between the Republics 
of Macedonia and Bulgaria, and it will stage an official 
promotion in Skopje on 8 May. A similar movement is also being 
formed in Bulgaria.

<F P=106> [Interview with Krasimir Karakachanov, secretary of the </F>
Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization-Union of 
Macedonian Societies, VMRO-SMD, by Valeriya Veleva; place and 
date not given: "Skopje Cannot Play on Our Nerves Indefinitely"] 
  [Excerpts] Mr. Karakachanov, three years after our 
recognition of our western neighbor's independence, has Bulgaria 
managed to state its priorities in Macedonia [The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]? 
  [Karakachanov] Macedonia itself should be a priority of our 
foreign policy, not only from a purely emotional viewpoint. 
Three wars were waged to liberate Macedonia, in which Bulgaria 
sacrificed 200,000 people. Up to 1944, Bulgarian foreign policy 
was oriented in the direction of Macedonia joining Bulgaria. 
The idea was to unite the Bulgarian territories in a single 
state in the name of the Bulgarian nation. Today, the realities 
are different. Bulgaria has no interest in new conflicts in the 
Balkans for the sake of Macedonia, and for this reason our 
policy is aimed at preserving the new state's sovereignty and 
territorial integrity. 
  If we look at the situation purely pragmatically, our 
shortest road to the Adriatic, that is, the sea route to Europe, 
passes through Macedonia and Albania. To develop this route 
would make us more independent and enable us largely to 
eliminate the excessive effects of the Aegean ports on our 
economy. Greece is conducting an extremely emotional policy 
regarding Macedonia, and the embargo it imposed provides no 
guarantee that we may not be eliminated in the same way, in 
certain future circumstances, were we to defend a thesis that 
Greece does not like. 
  From the political viewpoint, very good relations between 
Macedonia and Bulgaria might counter the Athens-Belgrade axis, 
which has traditionally been aimed against Bulgaria. Formed as 
far back as 1913, it exists to this very day, and it has always 
tried to nullify Bulgaria's efforts to become a factor of 
influence in the Balkans. 
  [Veleva] Does this mean that part of the key to our two 
states' survival is for them to combine their efforts? 
  [Karakachanov] If a democratic regime is established in 
Macedonia, one with a sincere attitude toward Bulgaria, and if 
both countries conduct a common Balkan policy, this would be of 
mutual interest. Threatened by Greece and Serbia, at present 
Macedonia is isolated. In addition, one should not forget the 
claims of the considerable Albanian minority in Macedonia. It 
is no secret that certain circles in the Albanian population 
there are working for the secession of western Macedonia, so you 
can see that Macedonia itself has an interest in having Bulgaria 
as a good friend. The two of them together can become an 
influential factor in the Balkans. 
  [Veleva] Despite this, one cannot say that the relations 
between us during the last three years have been brilliant. 
  [Karakachanov] There are two reasons for this. First, the 
Bulgarian politicians either do not appreciate these interests 
that Bulgaria has, or they are not interested in them. At the 
moment, Macedonia is ruled by people who were in power in Tito's 
time -- the same party, the same figures. They are close to the 
Belgrade regime, not only ideologically. Even after Macedonia 
declared independence, they sought alternatives for restoring 
Yugoslavia, according to the Izetbegovic-Gligorov plan. Today, 
no one can deny this. Seeing the weakness of Bulgaria's Balkan 
policy, certain Macedonian politicians are permitting themselves 
to behave quite arrogantly and provocatively at times. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Veleva] What is your comment on the statement by Zhan 
Videnov [leader of Bulgarian Socialist Party -- BSP] that the 
recognition of Macedonia was a "tactical" step by the Filip 
Dimitrov government, and that the Serbian danger is a "myth" 
dreamed up by Bulgaria? 
  [Karakachanov] This is not the first time that Zhan Videnov 
has made an overhasty statement about Macedonia and VMRO 
[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]. This shows 
that either he has not given up his party's internationalist 
complexes or he is not familiar with the problem. Even if we 
suppose that the SDS [Union of Democratic Forces] recognized 
Macedonia during the presidential election campaign to win the 
votes of Bulgarians with a nationalist frame of mind, why did 
the BSP not do it? Why did it not win these dividends? The big 
point is that Bulgaria won dividends by recognizing Macedonia, 
not who did it and for what reasons! Our politicians should 
finally realize that there must be a measure of ethics in 
politics. If a "Macedonian question" exists today, if a large 
part of the Macedonian population is confused and does not know 
its own history and roots, this is due only to the stupid policy 
that Bulgaria and Videnov's own party has followed from the time 
of the wars. In 1946 this party committed an act without 
parallel, even in other communist parties: It forced a part of 
the Bulgarian people to renounce their origin, and the Bulgarian 
state forgot about the Bulgarians in Vardar and Aegean 
Macedonia. Today, the recognition of Macedonia has restored the 
trust of many people there in Bulgaria. It seems that Videnov 
wanted to pay obeisance to Yugoslavia, or to the New Democracy 
Party in Greece. Even now, some circles within the BSP claim 
that some kind of "Macedonian nation" is a reality. I ask 
myself: Is the BSP really following a national policy that is 
adequate for the situation in the Balkans? Look at the Serbian 
press; even now it talks about Macedonia as if it were southern 
Serbia. Prominent Serbian politicians, even Milosevic's own 
wife, are working to integrate Macedonia into Serbia. 
  [Veleva] Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov starts his visit 
to Sofia today; the Albanian head of state Sali Berisha will 
come after him; and later Miltiadis Evert, leader of the Greek 
New Democracy Party, will visit us. What can we expect from 
this active foreign policy that Bulgarian President Zhelev is 
following? 
  [Karakachanov] The VMRO-SMD [Internal Macedonian 
Revolutionary Organization-Union of Macedonian Societies] has 
long agitated for a more active Bulgarian policy in the Balkans. 
The meeting between Gligorov and Zhelev should demonstrate to 
the Macedonian side once and for all that Bulgaria's intentions 
are only good. This indicates that Bulgaria will continue to 
tolerate Skopje's provocations and the unnecessary tension in 
the region. Sali Berisha's visit is also a good sign for us. 
As for the leader of the New Democracy Party, it is clear that 
we must raise the issue of the Bulgarians in Aegean Macedonia. 
If these visits are only reflected in media interviews and 
photographs, they are unlikely to produce any results. Bulgaria 
must emphatically defend its interests in the Balkans.

<F P=106> [Article by Tamas Mellar: "Success Propaganda or Political </F>
Pouting; Even Accomplishments Can Cause Pain to the Opposition"] 
  [Text] The opposition press of the past several weeks 
resounded with criticism of the government's so-called "success 
propaganda." "While the economic situation of the country 
is increasingly deteriorating, and it is becoming increasingly 
clear that the present government is going to hand over the 
governance of the country to the next government in a condition 
worse than it was when it took power, certain government sources 
do not shrink from rehashing some long-forgotten bolshevik 
legacies, and from advertising the government's success. To 
assert that things are better today than they were four years 
ago, when facts and everyday experience indicate the opposite, 
amounts to uninhibited insolence," so the opposition 
argument goes. 
  Accordingly, let us find out who is correct: Should we 
believe what the government says or what the opposition claims 
to be true, or should we rely on our own experience? It is not 
easy to give an unequivocal "yes" or "no" answer to this 
question, because we are in the midst of a transitional process 
of historic significance, the essence of which is change, the 
dismantling of the old system, and the building of a new system. 
Therefore, we do not have a fixed basis for comparison to permit 
a clear evaluation of the changes. Similarly, one cannot draw 
historical parallels, or rely on scientific grading systems, 
because we are in the process of an unprecedented 
transformation, simultaneously experienced by only a few former 
socialist countries. 
  If, despite all these difficulties, we try to assess the 
past 
period, anything we say must be prefaced by a statement to the 
effect that no summary judgment, clearly positive or clearly 
negative, can be made. The overall picture shows both favorable 
and unfavorable trends. The exact ratio in which these trends 
are mixed to prove correct any given view depends on one's 
temper and political outlook. Such assessments, however, do not 
render the overall picture entirely black or entirely white: The 
picture still shows the situation as it actually exists. 
<H5>  Confronting the Legacy of the Past </H5>
  It is not entirely futile to look behind the arguments 
presented by the opposition, because we should be able to 
present not only the negative, but also the positive aspects of 
the situation. In the following paragraphs we will examine 
arguments most frequently advanced by opposition politicians to 
prove the worsening of the economic situation. 
  Opposition argument No. 1: The GDP, industrial 
production, agricultural production, and real income have 
significantly declined during the past four years, while 
unemployment has greatly increased. All this goes to show that 
the present government has not resolved the crisis inherited 
from socialism, in fact it has made it worse. 
  Doubtless, it is true that production and income have 
greatly 
declined, but one should underscore the fact that a decline of 
at least the same proportion has already potentially existed in 
the system prior to 1990, except that it did not surface at the 
time, because the governments of those days did not dare to 
confront the situation, and used every means (e.g., foreign 
indebtedness) to postpone the real solution. The eastern market 
that accepted virtually limitless quantities of obsolete, 
inferior quality products (but made increasingly fewer payments) 
had not collapsed at the time. But even then it was clear that 
most of our products could not withstand competition, that a 
significant number of our enterprises constituted chronic loss 
operations, that they operated on the basis of obsolete 
technical and technological standards, and that 25-30 percent of 
their employees were superfluous. At that time already, it was 
obvious that thing could not go on the way they did before. The 
relatively high growth rate of the 1970s came to a halt for the 
first time in the early 1980's, and investments and 
accumulations have continuously declined ever since. The failure 
to renew production capacities has already predestined the 
subsequent decline in production. 
  After the collapse of the eastern markets, and after the 
introduction of import liberalization and principles of a market 
economy (accounting law, financial institutions law, bankruptcy 
law), one had to face the harsh realities of the inherited 
economy, and to examine the actual state of production forces 
that had been "developed according to a plan." Accordingly, the 
great decline flows decisively from the consistent use of this 
new yardstick, and not from flawed economic policies applied 
during the past four years. A substantially smaller decline in 
production and employment would have indicated that we had 
chosen the wrong path, that we had supported the old 
conservationist theory instead of renewal. In order to permit a 
new, modern economic structure to evolve, one has to dismantle 
the old system, and in the initial period, the emerging new 
system is unable to compensate for the demise of the old system. 
  Opposition argument No. 2: The state's external and 
internal indebtedness has greatly increased during the past four 
years. The present government has failed to implement unpopular 
stringency measures; like its communist predecessors, the 
present government wants the next generation to resolve the 
problems. For all these reasons, the present government leaves 
behind for the next government empty state coffers and heavy 
obligations. 
  Factual data indicate that although the gross foreign 
indebtedness of the state has increased as compared to the 1990 
indebtedness level, the total net volume of indebtedness has not 
increased during the period examined. Between 1990 and 1992 the 
current balance of payments was positive. In 1993, however, a 
significant ($3.5 billion) deficit evolved, mainly as a result 
of the significant decline in exports. The decline in exports 
may be attributed to several factors, but in the final analysis, 
the reason for the decline can be traced to our low level of 
competitiveness. Increasing our competitiveness to appropriate 
levels requires an extended period of time. In the meantime, 
however, we must not pursue isolationist policies, because this 
would result in losing our chance to become integrated with the 
global economy. Quite naturally, one could suggest that a far 
more effective policy to stimulate exports should have been 
pursued by the government under the given conditions. This is 
true, in essence. One must not, however, disregard the fact that 
a strong policy to stimulate exports would have carried the 
threat of softening standard trade regulations, which could have 
caused very grave problems in a fledgling market economy. 
  The (internal) indebtedness of the state has, indeed, 
increased significantly during the past four years. Its volume 
has doubled during the period. But this large-scale growth 
conceals a far smaller growth in actual indebtedness. This is so 
because almost two-thirds of the state's indebtedness is 
comprised of the forint value of the external indebtedness, 
which has increased primarily as a result of several 
devaluations of the forint. If we considered the budget deficit 
only, the state's indebtedness would be substantially smaller. 
<H5>  "Empty State Coffers"--A Rhetorical Trick </H5>
  Not including the initial year 1990, the state budget had a 
deficit in every year, and the amount of deficit has increased 
each year. The large budget deficit, however, did not result 
from an expanding state, from a growing redistribution of 
income, but from the collapse of the old system. This is so 
because the lack of balance is due to a drop in revenues, and 
not to increased expenditures. Tax revenues naturally decline 
when production and income decline (and this is true in 
particular when a large number of factors in the economy evade 
taxation), while demand for social welfare provisions increase. 
During the past four years the volume of production and 
consumption subsidies as part of the state budget has decreased 
significantly, while the proportion of social welfare 
expenditures in the budget has greatly increased. An odd 
situation has evolved in the grip of constraints and 
limitations: The budget was heavily restrained from the 
standpoint of production, at the same time, however, it 
developed a heavy deficit, thus causing a deterioration of the 
overall balance, while it was incapable to finance social 
welfare entitlement, and unable to appropriately compensate 
social strata that were sliding down. 
  One can escape from this trap only by instituting a 
comprehensive budget reform. The government has failed to 
initiate such a reform, and it can be appropriately blamed for 
that. At the same time, however, one should also stress that the 
disintegration of the old production system has imposed a grave 
burden of such proportion on society, that even the existence of 
the middle strata has become threatened. Under these conditions 
it is questionable whether society would also have tolerated a 
radical reduction in the social welfare delivery systems. Beyond 
all this, one also has to recognize that reforming the large 
distribution systems of the budget would not have produced 
tangible budget reductions in the short term, but would have 
increased the burden on the populace. A fundamental budget 
reform can only be introduced on a gradual basis, in parallel 
with growing individual income. 
  The repeated mention of empty state coffers might be a 
clever 
rherotical trick, but it has no factual basis whatsoever. At the 
end of 1993 our foreign exchange reserves amounted to $6.8 
billion. As a matter of comparison, one should note that foreign 
exchange reserves amounted to $800 million when governance was 
transferred from the Nemeth government. The large volume of 
foreign exchange reserves, as well as about $6 billion in 
foreign investments over the past few years enable secure 
operations, one that provides significant latitude even for the 
next government. 
  Opposition argument No. 3: The government missed 
opportunities, and did not (consistently) implement the 
transition to a market economy; it began to build a modern 
economic system slowly and selectively. 
  In light of the changes made thus far, the charge that holds 
that the present coalition government does not want to establish 
a market economy, but the Horthy system of between the two world 
wars or some vaguely defined, fellow-traveler system based on 
national considerations, is totally unfounded. The governmental 
and legislative actions of the past four years indicate a clear 
commitment to a market economy. Progress in privatization, the 
establishment of market economy institutions, laws consistent 
with western market economy standards, and the increasing role 
of foreign capital all go to prove this. 
<H5>  Mixed, Kadarist Reactions </H5>
  In reality then, all that can be said is that the 
development 
of a market economy has progressed at a slow pace. This is 
certainly true, especially if compared to heightened 
expectations. The delays and the slowness resulted from delayed 
actions by the government and the legislature on the one hand, 
and from mistakes made by the professional staff, and the lack 
of a social consensus, on the other. In 1990, voters authorized 
the present government to accomplish a slow, gradual transition, 
and not to apply shock therapy. (One should keep in mind the 
major social tensions created by even a slow-paced transition.) 
  Lack of acceptance by society may also be blamed for the 
slow 
progress of transition to a market economy. The gravest legacy 
of the past socialist system can be found not in distorted 
material conditions, but in standards of conduct, aptitudes, and 
attitudes instilled in people. After the political system 
change, everyone expected to see a well-functioning, decent 
market economy, as in Germany, Switzerland, or Japan. The 
problem is that on a societal scale, Hungary did not have (and 
still does not have) a high level of work ethics, a high degree 
of enterprising spirit, and appropriate professional training. 
Short of these, even a well functioning market economy develops 
slowly, is filled with contradictions and many mistakes, and is 
accompanied by negative phenomena. 
  The popular but mistaken belief or propaganda holds that the 
above-mentioned positive attributes had already evolved and had 
gained strength during Kadar's soft dictatorship, in the 
socialist economy that had been the subject of several reforms. 
This, however, is not true. What evolved there was a way to make 
a living in the shadows of socialist large enterprises: to work 
for these enterprises in executive positions, and, at the same 
time, to maintain business relations with the same enterprises 
in the form of a second job. Further: This situation taught 
people how to conduct themselves wisely in an economy in which 
consumers could enjoy all the advantages of a market economy, 
but in which producers and employers were protected against all 
negative effects of the market (this was the logic of the 
"produce for the eastern markets--buy from the Western markets" 
mechanism). 
  Real market economies, however, do not function on the basis 
of this logic; they require some different aptitudes and forms 
of conduct, and Hungarian society was not (and is still not) 
appropriately prepared to acquire such aptitudes and to manifest 
such conduct. Accordingly, when it comes to progress in the 
development of a market economy, the slowness of the progress is 
not necessarily due to mistakes made by the government, but also 
to slow and mixed reactions by society. Let us not forget the 
old wisdom: "You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make 
him drink."

<F P=106> [Interview with Ferenc Rabar, economic expert of the </F>
Christian Democratic People's Party and former finance minister, 
by unidentified correspondent; place and date not given: "The 
Tax System Is a Tool of Income Policy -- Ferenc Rabar on 
Handling the Budget Deficit"] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] The budget deficit started to 
increase drastically after you left the Finance Ministry and 
today this is one of the biggest problems of the economy. What 
does the Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP] see as the 
reasons for this? 
  [Rabar] There seems to be a general agreement that the 
budget deficit is a result of lost revenue. Is this due to the 
very little revenue-producing ability of the Hungarian economy 
or the absence of taxes from the gray and black economy? The 
recipes for remedying the problems are obvious: Incomes in the 
economy must be increased, and in the other case, the collection 
of taxes must be made stricter. The latter would only be useful 
if the tax system were changed such a way that would make it 
worthwhile for the entrepreneurs to come out into the open 
economy. 
  [Correspondent] It seems that the KDNP, like the Federation 
of Young Democrats [Fidesz], does not advocate the immediate 
reduction of the budget deficit. 
  [Rabar] We must temporarily put up with the existence of a 
budget deficit. The current level is obviously too high and 
cannot be maintained in the long run. However, we have to get 
out of the vicious circle that there is no income, which in turn 
increases the budget deficit, so we increase taxes to finance 
the deficit, and this further reduces the income of the actors 
in the economy. This can only be broken if we put up with a 
high budget deficit for a while. However, I would emphasize 
that the economy can only bear this budget deficit temporarily 
and to a certain degree. 
  [Correspondent] How would you resolve the financing of the 
deficit? 
  [Rabar] The deficit can be financed either from domestic or 
foreign sources. The latter results in upsetting the balance of 
payments and the economy can also only tolerate this for a 
limited period of time. However, the current level of foreign 
currency reserves makes it possible to finance the external 
deficit. This would give some breathing space to the Hungarian 
economy and, in the meantime, measures can be used to boost the 
market. To achieve this, it is vitally important to stimulate 
savings and investment on the supply side, which can mainly be 
done through high real interest rates. This has been the 
practice up to now because the government has tried to keep 
interest rates high. Savings have increased in recent years but 
these resources did not reenter the economy. On the supply 
side, we also need to have an aggressive policy to boost exports. 
  Tax reductions are the most effective way of encouraging 
investment but this would again result in a temporary growth of 
the budget deficit. However, when the economy begins to grow, 
then the tax revenue will also increase. Some kind of interest 
rate support could be another way of encouraging investment. 
This means that all or part of the interest on loans taken on 
for investment is paid by the state. 
  [Correspondent] On the demand side, what kind of measures 
would you introduce to boost the economy? 
  [Rabar] We would try to increase the purchasing power of 
those groups of society whose consumption habits do not create 
too much inflation and do not increase imports. I am mainly 
thinking of food consumption, which accounts for a large section 
of spending among the lower income group. Increased food 
purchases can certainly be satisfied from domestic production; 
therefore, the increased income of pensioners and large families 
can have positive effects on the economy. 
  [Correspondent] How, through what measures would you 
increase the income of these groups in society? 
  [Rabar] It would mainly be worthwhile changing the tax 
system. We would keep the two-tier value added tax system but we 
would change the products in preferential categories. This way, 
we would end up with a price structure that favors products 
consumed by people on low incomes. It is also possible that 
after the initial regrouping, parallel to the improved economic 
situation, we would also reduce the tax level to a certain 
extent. 
  [Correspondent] To what extent would you change the 
structure of personal taxation? 
  [Rabar] Personal taxation should be made a direct tool of 
income policy. The burden on people with lower incomes should 
definitely be reduced, but I would not like to talk about 
further changes because we will have to consider the 
consequences of the changes very carefully. 
  [Correspondent] We have not yet mentioned entrepreneurs. 
What does the KDNP promise them? I recall that the 
entrepreneurs complain mainly about high wage costs. 
  [Rabar] We want mainly to lay emphasis on new small and 
medium-sized enterprises and to encourage the inflow of foreign 
capital. I agree that social security contributions are high. 
The stimulation of enterprises is closely linked to the inflow 
of capital. It is not so certain that the areas where wages are 
low are more attractive for foreign capital. On the other hand, 
the structure of incoming capital has to be closely examined. 
This would show that most of the incoming capital is seeking 
markets here, rather than investing to create markets or to 
bring in technology. This means, that, in the long run, Western 
capital is hoping for markets.

<F P=106> [Article by Gabor Juhasz: "Christian Democratic People's </F>
Party: Changed Image; Faith, Hope, Origin"] 
  [Text] "Family, economy, social justice, and purity," 
proclaims the election watchword of the Christian Democratic 
People's Party [KDNP], preparing to assume a governing role. 
Indications are that the smallest coalition party of today is 
trying to transcend its own shadow: The organization that has 
always been a loyal follower of the Hungarian Democratic Forum 
[MDF] is increasingly underscoring its independence and its 
people's party character. 
  "Everyone has a bitter taste in his mouth, not as a result 
of 
envy, but because of the apparent difference between law and 
morality," KDNP chairman Laszlo Surjan said in his opening 
campaign speech on 13 February in Szeged. He demanded that legal 
order be based more on morality; these remarks pertained to the 
sales transaction involving the headquarters building between 
the MDF and Fidesz [Federation of Young Democrats]. The 
unusually sharp statement by the chairman of today's smallest 
coalition party, the minister of public welfare in both the 
Antall and the Boross cabinets, indicates that the KDNP believes 
that the party's four-year subordination in governance expires 
in 1994. They hope that the elections in May will 
redistribute--favorably, from KDNP's standpoint--the roles to be 
played among the parties: i.e., that the KDNP remains a ruling 
party and that its weight is going to be definitive in the new 
coalition. 
  Doubtless, the KDNP is the only ruling party whose election 
prospects have improved, as compared to the situation four years 
ago. Most recent public opinion polls indicate that the KDNP's 
popularity among voters regarded as certain to vote varies 
between 4 and 5 percent (HETI VILAGGAZDASAG, 5 March 1994), 
i.e., it barely surpasses the threshold limit applicable to 
parties to be seated in parliament, the fact is that of the same 
people questioned, the fewest number reject the KDNP from among 
all the ruling parties. This year the KDNP's chances are also 
better than they were in 1990, because they have, by now, made 
up for the lag caused by their late start in 1990. The KDNP was 
formed on 2 April 1989 (or, to be more accurate, it was 
reorganized, because the KDNP regards itself as the successor to 
Barankovics's Democratic People's Party, which, officially, 
never ceased to exist); it ran in the 1990 elections with 3,200 
members, and with no press of its own. (In those days, the MDF 
had 21,000 dues-paying members, and the SZDSZ [Alliance of Free 
Democrats] had 15,000.) One of the reasons for the delay in 
reorganizing the KDNP was that the "veterans," including 
then-party chairman Sandor Keresztes, the present ambassador to 
the Vatican, did not believe for long in the possibility of 
organizing a party, and pursued political discourse in a cover 
organization called "Aron Marton Society," or, for that matter, 
within the MDF. As a result of the delay, the KDNP was unable to 
establish slates of candidates in five counties, and thus, 
primarily in the southeastern part of the country, people could 
not vote for the KDNP even if they wanted to. (Each of the other 
five parties seated in parliament in 1990 ran 20 slates, but 
while the KDNP acquired more than 10 percent of the vote in five 
counties, FIDESZ managed to do the same in only three counties.) 
  The KDNP faces this year's elections with almost 30,000 
members, and tries to introduce new, albeit familiar, faces in 
the course of the campaign, along with Laszlo Surjan, who heads 
the national slate. Most frequently mentioned are an active and 
a former minister: Janos Latorcai, present minister of industry 
and commerce, and Ferenc Rabar, an independent, who served as 
the first finance minister of the Antall government, until his 
resignation in late 1990. The KDNP is also endeavoring to make 
up for its "lag in the media"; ongoing, detailed negotiations 
pertain to conditions for PEST MEGYEI HIRLAP becoming a 
newspaper under KDNP influence. 
  The election program was also adjusted, of course. This is 
indicated by the change in the title of the program: The 1990 
title (The Christian Way) was replaced by what has been a 
chapter title: "We want a society centered around the human 
being." According to the new program, the KDNP is "a party 
having the character of a movement, based on the Christian 
ideal, and with an independent, modern program." This definition 
was amended by the words "democratic and patriotic people's 
party" and "an organization independent from the churches." On 
the other hand, as the title shows, four years ago the KDNP 
emphasized that "a Christian outlook is the ideological 
foundation of our party," although even then, they added that 
"our party is not a `clerical' party." 
  The change in emphasis obviously represents an endorsement 
of 
the pragmatic policies Surjan followed for the past four years. 
The minister of public welfare became a member of the KDNP's top 
echelon, and then its leader only after the elections, moreover, 
only after the government was formed, and only after the party 
leadership of Sandor Keresztes and Emese Ugrin was let go in May 
1990. The odd aspect of his party career is that based on 
confidence in him manifested by Jozsef Antall, Surjan became a 
minister before he became the leader of the party or a 
representative, based on confidence expressed by the KDNP 
membership (in March 1990 he ran third in an individual voting 
district, and 15th on the party's national slate, and thus he 
entered parliament in September 1990, inheriting Sandor 
Keresztes's mandate after his ambassadorial appointment). The 
top position at the KDNP appears to be stable; Sandor Keresztes, 
who has been observing the events of the past years from the 
Vatican, and who is going to return to Hungary for the 
elections, ranks only fifth on the party's national slate. 
Keresztes is preceded on the slate by party Chairman Surjan, 
party Vice Chairman Laszlo Varga, Tibor Fuzessy, representative 
and minister without portfolio, and by Janos Latorcai, minister 
of industry and commerce. The secure positions of Surjan and his 
team is indicated by the fact that radicals within the party, 
such as Miklos Gaspar, Miklos Hasznos, and Miklos Palos, rank 
ninth, 10th, and 12th on the KDNP's national slate. 
  Surjan visibly endeavored to tide over the past few years by 
remaining loyal to the MDF as the "last satellite," while 
showing his independence everywhere, especially in the form of 
rhetoric. All this led to spectacular actions from time to time: 
Most recently Representative Tamas Lukacs criticized the 
government's privatization practice, and called it "unacceptable 
to society," but the official KDNP position in this regard spoke 
only about slowing down and the correction of mistakes. All this 
mostly served the purpose of allowing the KDNP leadership to 
once again try to prove to voters that it should not be held 
responsible for the mistakes made in privatization, because, 
based on the division of labor in government, the KDNP exercised 
no authority with respect to privatization. (Undoubtedly, 
however, the KDNP supported a "well-considered," "well thought 
out" privatization program in 1990.) 
  Several other old theses, virtually forgotten during the 
past 
four years, have gained new emphasis in the new KDNP program. 
For example, the KDNP returned to the principle of having the 
president of the Republic chosen in direct elections (the KDNP 
supported this alternative in the November 1989 popular 
referendum, but it did not in July 1990, after the party became 
part of the government); they regard an increased state role in 
the economy as indispensable, recommend central economic 
revitalization programs (the stimulation of enterprising, 
increased investments), and support the idea of establishing a 
peak economic ministry. A government under more forceful KDNP 
influence would protect producers with state-imposed 
restrictions (such as customs duties and quotas), according to 
the KDNP program. Regarding arable land, the KDNP would not even 
permit Hungarian-owned corporations domiciled in Hungary to 
acquire ownership (only Hungarian citizens, local governments, 
or the state would be entitled to do so), and the maximum limit 
of privately owned land would be 300 hectares or 6,000 gold 
crowns, (with no limit on the size or value of leased land). 
  Incidentally, due to events that transpired during the past 
four years, it was the land program that needed the greatest 
change, because four years ago the KDNP took the position that 
lands owned by the state and by cooperatives be given to local 
governments (and people from whom the land had been taken away, 
could have reclaimed their land from the local governments). But 
this concept no longer made sense as a result of the 
compensation process. Nevertheless, an accounting of the 
accomplishments, as presented in Laszlo Surjan's opening 
campaign speech in Szeged, is flattering to the party: The KDNP 
managed to implement 80 percent of its campaign promises. For 
example, the party chairman made special mention of the fact 
that autonomous local governments have come into being, and that 
laws have been created concerning church property and the 
minorities. At the same time, however, he also mentioned the 
failure of "making inflation disappear quickly," and of reducing 
state expenditures as some of the fiascos. 
  Based on four years of experience in governance, they 
omitted 
several theses from their program, which flow from "roots of 
one's world view," but which nevertheless proved to be 
unworkable in their original form. For example, they no longer 
demand the "development of a state power and state organization 
that corresponds with Christian ideals and the Christian world 
view"; on the other hand, they demand the limitation of the 
Constitutional Court's power (e.g., by removing its power to 
declare a law null and void). An "abortion-free Hungary" 
continues to be the declared goal of the KDNP, but by now, 
partly due to disputes that have arisen regarding the abortion 
law proposed by the KDNP party chairman and minister, they want 
to accomplish this as a result of educational work molding 
people's outlook, and they no longer talk about "preventing, 
without delay," "the organized extinction" of already conceived 
"Hungarian lives."

<F P=106> [Interview with economist Attila Karoly Soos, member of the </F>
Alliance of Free Democrats and chairman of the Parliamentary 
Budget, Tax, and Finance Committee, by Istvan Varga; place and 
date not given: "Enterprise Stimulation in the Forefront -- 
Attila Karoly Soos on the Importance of Reducing Taxes"] 
  [Text] What would be your first economic policy measures 
if the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] came to power after 
the elections? 
  [Soos] The SZDSZ wishes to conduct an economic policy based 
on tax reductions. We would abolish the source tax [forrasado] 
from next year which is now 10 percent and Parliament actually 
reduced it from 20 percent to this level on our suggestion. The 
abolition of this tax would reduce the difference between the 
interest rate on deposits and loans, which would have a positive 
effect on the population's will to save. The abolition of 
minimum tax rates is another SZDSZ proposal. We consider 
taxation on income [bevetel] totally unjustified from an 
economic point of view, and constitutional problems also arise 
here. Third, in the case of enterprises that have less than a 
50-million-forint turnover, we would introduce a flat rate tax. 
This would make it possible for a large amount of sums paid by 
small enterprises to tax advisers to come into the treasury. 
Entrepreneurs, on the other hand, would pay less tax and have 
less administration. Another of our proposals is to expand 
investment preferences. Unlike the current rules, the 
preferences could be used by anyone, regardless of government 
permits. 
  [Varga] For capital-rich enterprises, the abolition of the 
profits tax would be important because they are still paying a 
flat rate tax. 
  [Soos] The government would remit part of the profit tax if 
the enterprises use their profits for reinvestment. This 
benefit would generally encourage the capital-rich enterprises 
and would at the same time help boost the economy. 
  [Varga] It seems that the SZDSZ is leaving too much to 
private initiatives; however, large investment with state 
support cannot be given up. 
  [Soos] Rather than state investment, we should be talking 
about infrastructural developments. In certain sectors, private 
capital cannot be mobilized. Highways or telephone systems can 
easily be created on a concession basis but hospitals or schools 
can only be built from the state's finances. State resources 
can also be used for the development of the regional 
infrastructure. 
  [Varga] In connection with investment, we have to talk about 
the World Expo. If it came to power, would the SZDSZ, in 
accordance with its previous view, withdraw from organizing Expo? 
  [Soos] At the time, the country resounded with calls for the 
world exposition to be organized on an entrepreneurial basis. 
Now we know that this is not at all the case. It is almost 
entirely a state investment and this is precisely the reason 
that the SZDSZ was against organizing it. However, preparations 
have reached a level where it would cost more to halt the 
investment than to organize the Expo. In addition to this, 
canceling the World Expo would also mean a loss of prestige 
because many countries have now applied to participate in it. 
  [Varga] An enterprise-friendly policy definitely has to take 
steps to put the banking sector in order. 
  [Soos] It is impossible to boost the economy in any way 
without developing the banking sector. The SZDSZ would 
stabilize the banking system and then it would begin to 
privatize it. We would sell off two banks even in 1994. It is 
important to implement cashless banking techniques as soon as 
possible. It is absurd that entrepreneurs are walking about 
with millions of forints in their pockets. 
  [Varga] Where would you find the financial resources for 
investment stimulation and tax reductions? How much revenue 
loss can the current position of the budget accept? 
  [Soos] Our proposal on tax reductions represents a small 
part of the whole budget, so there is no point in talking about 
the reserves for it. The loss of the source tax means 11 
billion forints; however, parallel to this, the profits and the 
profit tax from enterprises would increase. The abolition of 
the minimum tax would mean the loss of 6 billion forints, which 
would be regained through the payments of flat rate tax. I 
expect that many people would choose this form of taxation and 
this would increase budget revenue. We wish to find funds for 
reducing the personal income and profit taxes, which is to be 
implemented later, through a stricter collection of taxes. 
  [Varga] Entrepreneurs are complaining about high wage costs, 
rather than high taxes. 
  [Soos] It is a fact that Hungarian wage costs are very high 
in international comparison. However, it also has to be known 
that the proportion of pensioners is very high in Hungary. 
Stricter collection is again one way of reducing health and 
pension contributions. However, in the more distant future, 
only the introduction of private insurance can be the solution. 
  [Varga] The stock market could be one of the most 
significant investment possibilities for citizens but, at the 
moment, it is playing a modest role in the economy. 
  [Soos] It is vitally important to change the system of 
investment support if we want to boost the turnover of the stock 
exchange. If someone sells his shares then he automatically 
loses his preferential treatment. The opposite of this should 
be the case because the stock exchange is intensified when 
people implement changes in their share portfolios. 
  [Varga] By now, some 200 billion forints of compensation 
notes have entered the market and maintaining the current price 
of these is awkward and costs very much. Would you accept the 
costs of maintaining the prices of these at a certain level? 
  [Soos] Recently, demand through privatization has not kept 
pace with the amount of compensation notes. The SZDSZ would 
certainly ensure a demand for the necessary quality and amount 
of shares. 
  [Varga] At the moment, the price of compensation notes is at 
around 70 percent. Would you set the price higher or lower than 
this? 
  [Soos] It certainly would not be lower than the current 
price.

<F P=106> [Interview with Istvan Csurka, cochairman of the Hungarian </F>
Justice and Life Party, by Pal Szombathy; place and date not 
given: "List Leaders Give Interviews -- Csurka: We Can Feel the 
People's Quiet Sympathy"] 
  [Text] In our election series, list leaders of parties 
that have set up a national list give interviews on their 
party's typical program points and concepts. This time we are 
interviewing Istvan Csurka, cochairman of the Hungarian Justice 
and Life Party [MIEP]. 
  [Szombathy] On what points does the MIEP's program differ 
markedly from the goals of other national conservative forces? 
  [Csurka] The major difference is on the economy. We can 
clearly see that the Antall government is responsible for the 
current situation to the extent that it did not change the 
20-year-old economic and financial program of the communist 
nomenclature, which had been based on the constant 
centralization of funds and restrictions because it had to pay 
the interest [on foreign loans]. The economic policy of the 
government led by the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] was a 
direct continuation of the budget plans of the communists and 
reform-communists. The implementation of this is very 
interesting: Formally, the government is in power and the 
finance ministers -- who for the most part have not been 
replaced in this cycle without reason -- dictate, but the 
processes in the financial administration and the banks are all 
in communist or liberal hands. Therefore, it cannot be claimed 
that the national forces or the government was in power between 
1990 and 1994. The MIEP wishes to change this situation, as 
this is where order has to be made first. While foreigners are 
rooting about in our pockets we cannot talk about independent 
Hungarian policies. The MIEP also differs in that it wants 
justice by further prosecuting the crimes of the past. We also 
want firmly to represent the national interests in culture and 
the dissemination of information. The current work of the 
public service media is intolerable, and I am saying this in 
spite of the fact that my party supports the two deputy chairmen 
leaders [of radio and television] who were appointed by the 
president but who are under concerted attack. A nation has the 
right to direct its own media and culture. 
  [Szombathy] What was the reason for your suggestion that 
those who support the national side should form a forum before 
the elections? To what extent do you share the MDF's fear of 
the left-wing danger? 
  [Csurka] The real danger is that of ignorance, rather than 
that of the left wing. The only reason we can talk about a 
left- wing danger is that a section of the masses is uninformed: 
They clearly place the responsibility on the national 
Christian- conservative forces, including the least involved 
MIEP, which was founded by people who had left the MDF. 
Dissatisfied people living in difficult conditions believe the 
fairy-tale that the left wing will bring back the golden age of 
[former Communist leader] Kadar, which never existed. This 
gross exaggeration is being hammered into people by the press, 
the radio, the television, and NEPSZABADSAG. Publicity should be 
made even before the first round of the elections, which would 
explosively give the light of recognition to people who are 
living in the dark. A pan-national conference would be suitable 
for this with a statement and with the participation of parties 
and mainly intellectuals. It is a misinterpretation of my words 
to say that I have come closer to the MDF through this: I have 
opened up toward all good intentions, and an example of this is 
my joint appearance with Jozsef Torgyan [chairman of the 
Independent Smallholders Party]. I am expecting the 
participants of the Szarszo meeting [August 1993], Hungarians 
living abroad, and smallholders to come to the conference. I do 
not want this event to be seen as a MIEP initiative. 
  [Szombathy] How do you see you party's numerical chances at 
the elections? 
  [Csurka] The MIEP has a good chance because it has massive 
lists in Budapest and in Pest county, and we have great 
popularity in the central parts of the country. This will 
certainly be enough to get into Parliament, and our individual 
candidates give us hope for a good result. We can feel people's 
quiet sympathy. 
  [Szombathy] Are you preparing for electoral cooperation 
between the two rounds of the elections? 
  [Csurka] Naturally. We will try to enter negotiations on 
this issue sensibly and honestly. We will look at who has the 
best chance: We will give and take. Give as good as one gets. 
We are willing to make an agreement with all national Christian 
parties that turn to us with honesty. 
  [Szombathy] What role do you envisage for the MIEP in the 
next Parliament? 
  [Csurka] It would be distasteful for us also to get involved 
in the pre-bargaining on ministerial chairs and coalition 
conditions. The MIEP's task is to be a compass for national 
Christian conservative forces. Guarantees have to be created 
that this conservative coalition would never lean toward the 
left, will never make pacts, and will not fall into marriages of 
convenience. 
  [Szombathy] If we can believe the opinion polls, we can 
expect a social-liberal victory. What will the MIEP do in such 
a situation? 
  [Csurka] One cannot believe opinion polls, and this has to 
be clearly stated once and for all. These surveys serve party 
propaganda purposes. However, should we be so unfortunate as 
for this to happen, then the MIEP will not despair: It will 
continue its consistent nation-organizing work.

<F P=106> [Article by Antonia Radi: "The Unemployment Rate Is 12.6 </F>
Percent"] 
  [Text] The number of registered unemployed persons 
declined in February: The local labor affairs offices jointly 
recorded a total of 630,000 registered unemployed persons, 
10,000 fewer than a month earlier. That brought the unemployment 
rate down from 12.8 to 12.6 percent. All this came to light from 
the report of the National Labor Affairs Center (OMK). 
  The OMK data reveal that with the present decline, which 
appears to be stable, unemployment has entered a new phase. For 
there were 74,000 fewer unemployed at the end of February of 
this year than a year earlier. 
  Although the number of registered unemployed persons 
continues to vary by regions, the extreme regional differences 
appear to have narrowed. The biggest decline in the number of 
registered unemployed occurred mostly in Bacs-Kiskun and 
Borsod-Abauj-Zemplen Counties. The situation remains the worst 
in Szabolcs County. In metropolitan Budapest as well as in Pest, 
Gyor-Moson-Sopron, Vas, and Zala counties the situation is 
better than the national average. 
  The number of unemployed new entrants into the job market 
also declined, albeit more moderately. Their closing total at 
the end of the month eased from 61,000 to 60,000, and their 
proportion within the total number of unemployed dropped from 
9.6 to 9.5 percent. OMK experts claim that all this can be 
attributed to the programs for retraining. 
  We also learned that, among the unemployed other than new 
entrants into the job market, there are respectively fewer 
former agricultural workers and construction workers. On the 
other hand there are more unemployed persons who previously had 
worked in industry or in nonmaterial services. 
  During February, nearly 44,000 persons left the system of 
provisions for the unemployed. The average length of time an 
unemployed persons remains within this system continued to 
shorten. 
  According to the economic players who are obliged to file 
notice of their intentions to lay off workers, 26,000 workers 
can be expected to be laid off in the near future.

<F P=106> [Interview with Almos Kovacs, vice president of the </F>
Hungarian National Bank, by Gabor Ferencz; place and date not 
given: "To Curb Inflation Through Self-Restraint?"] 
  [Text] Almos Kovacs, vice president of the Hungarian 
National Bank, expects inflation to decline this year. In his 
opinion, the inflation rate this year will only be about 17 
percent. An economist, he believes that changes in wages play a 
key role in the development of inflation. Therefore, employees 
are no better off when their trade unions focus attention on 
higher nominal wages. When interviewed by our reporter, Almos 
Kovacs dwelt on the inflationary threat that compensation poses. 
His conclusion is that the extent of this threat is inversely 
proportional to the compensation notes' quoted price on the 
stock exchange. 
  [Ferencz] When economic research institutes and central 
agencies prepare their inflation forecasts, they often arrive at 
different conclusions. How exact are the methods of estimating 
the inflation rate? 
  [Kovacs] In the final outcome, the inflation rate is a 
weighted average that reflects the rise of various types of 
costs. Hence it follows that, when estimating the inflation 
rate, certain assumptions must be made regarding the changes in 
costs--including wages, interest rates, taxes, and imports. 
Changes in wages play an eminent role in calculating the 
inflation rate. Namely, the changes in wages affect inflation 
not only through the changes in production costs, but also 
through changes in consumer demand. Interestingly, during the 
past three years--even though central wage regulation had 
ceased--very accurate estimates have been made of the 
development of wages, and of the extent of the resulting 
inflationary pressure. The market mechanisms appear to be 
working well in this area: Wages have not "run away" in the 
competitive sector. 
  [Ferencz] In Hungary, are the effects of wages on inflation 
the same as in textbook economies? 
  [Kovacs] Superficially, the proportion of wages among the 
costs would not seem excessively high. But in the final outcome, 
if there were no import, the rise of every cost could be traced 
back to changes in the costs of the primary factors, namely 
capital and labor. This is a classical Marxian theorem, but it 
happens to be true. 
  [Ferencz] Then will it depend on the employees' 
self-restraint whether or not inflation takes off? 
  [Kovacs] The economy's gross domestic product, or rather the 
proportions of earned incomes and capital incomes within it, 
determines the level of real wages. Thus our only option is 
whether real wages are obtained at a lower or higher rate of 
inflation, and hence at nominal wages expressed in smaller or 
larger numbers. The trade unions are not giving up anything even 
when they accept smaller increases in nominal wages, because the 
inflation rate will be lower and thus the same increase in real 
wages will be realized. It is worth noting that in 
Hungary--despite all appearances to the contrary--the proportion 
of earned incomes within GDP has increased considerably since 
1990, while the proportion of capital incomes has declined 
substantially! Which shows that the employees' situation 
relatively improved, while GDP declined. 
  [Ferencz] How does the forint's devaluation affect 
inflation? 
According to a frequently cited rule of thumb, every percentage 
point of devaluation raises the inflation rate by half a 
percentage point. 
  [Kovacs] This rule is based on the assumption that the 
higher 
costs resulting from devaluation are reflected in the prices and 
are then passed on. But the question is whether this rise in 
costs actually has a ripple effect? It is indisputable that 
imported materials become more expensive after a devaluation. 
However, it is not so certain that the prices of finished 
products containing also import materials will likewise rise. 
For a rise in the prices of such finished products depends also 
on changes in other factor costs (including wages, among 
others). What happened in Italy in 1992 is very edifying: 
Despite a devaluation of the lira by more than 20 percent, the 
inflation rate was lower than in the preceding year. Behind this 
was the trade unions' self-restraint. They realized that, in 
order to maintain the country's competitiveness and preserve 
jobs, they had to accept a redistribution of incomes favoring 
the exporting industries. 
  [Ferencz] Usually compensation is included among the factors 
causing inflation. Is not the effect of the mass of compensation 
notes, by now more than 100 billion forints' worth, the same as 
printing money? 
  [Kovacs] Let us assume one extreme: None of the recipients 
of 
compensation want state assets, all the compensation notes are 
converted into cash, which is then spent on consumer goods. In 
this case the cash (the proceeds from the sale of the 
compensation notes at the quoted market price, and not the 
notes' combined total face value) constitutes additional 
purchasing power and generates inflation. If some of the 
recipients of compensation use their notes to buy state assets, 
the inflationary effect will be that much smaller. But the 
critical question is whether the purchasers of compensation 
notes, who then use those notes to buy state assets, are 
deferring their consumption? If they are, then aggregate demand 
will increase only slightly or not at all, and inflationary 
pressure will subside. And if we assume the other extreme--that 
the investors defer their consumption by exactly as much as the 
recipients of compensation who sold their note increase theirs; 
or that all the investors are foreigners--it may even be said 
that the inflation rate does not increase at all. Obviously, the 
real case lies somewhere between these two extremes. 
  [Ferencz] Does this mean that the lower the market price of 
compensation notes, the smaller the threat of inflation? 
  [Kovacs] In the final outcome, yes. In my opinion, however, 
it is not at all the state's intention to suppress the market 
price of compensation notes. After all, the expansion of the 
scope of assets that can be bought with compensation notes has 
the exact opposite effect. 
  [Ferencz] Will the state budget's rising deficit not cancel 
the optimistic estimates of the inflation rate? 
  [Kovacs] As a percentage of GDP, the state budget's deficit 
will be lower than last year. A large deficit is undesirable 
primarily because it ties down savings in the economy, diverting 
them from the entrepreneurial sphere. The deficit's magnitude in 
itself is not an inflation-generating factor. What leads to 
inflation is the deficit's increase, at least an increase of the 
deficit as a percentage of GDP. When the budgetary deficit as a 
percentage of GDP increases from one year to the next, this 
indicates a rise in aggregate demand, which is a potential 
inflationary threat. In any case, it produces negative effects. 
However, we cannot automatically conclude even from this that 
the inflation rate will rise; because domestic savings could 
also increase--that was the situation in Hungary in 1992--or 
import could expand--as happened in 1993--and, instead of the 
inflation rate's rise, the balance of payments could worsen and 
the structure of demand could change unfavorably. 
  [Ferencz] What can be said of the domestic inflation rate's 
trend? The rate's steady decline that was typical of previous 
years seems to have stopped. 
  [Kovacs] Hungary's inflation in recent years stemmed to a 
decisive extent from the fact that price ratios had to change. 
In theory, of course, this can also be accomplished in such a 
way that some prices decline, other rise, and the price level 
remains unchanged. But this has never succeeded in practice. In 
most areas, however, the price increases were commensurate with 
the cost increases and with the dismantling of price subsidies. 
These factors could fully explaine the price increases, and an 
inflationary spiral of the Latin American type was not 
triggered. From which it also follows that henceforth the rise 
in consumer prices is able to be in line with the change in 
producer prices. During the past two years--due to a number of 
factors that include, for instance, also the change in VAT 
[value-added tax] rates--there has developed an estimated 
10-percent difference between the rise in producer and consumer 
prices, respectively. But this year we do not have to reckon 
with such "deflecting" effects. Consequently, the inflation rate 
could even drop as low as 17 percent.

  [Text] It is common knowledge that the cabinet at its 
Thursday meeting considered the requests of the public-service 
media for budgetary grants, but decisions on the requests were 
deferred. According to the government spokeswoman's news 
briefing, the cabinet considered the operations of the media too 
expensive because, as she put it, incomprehensibly huge requests 
amounting to billions of forints have been presented for several 
objectives. We interviewed the media chiefs about the 
special-purpose grants. 
  Gabor Nahlik, vice president of Hungarian Television [MTV] 
vested with full presidential authority, said that among the 
requests his institution presented there were indeed items 
bearing price tags running to billions, but they were for 
objectives essential to MTV, in view of parliament's failure to 
make provisions for them in this year's budget. These objectives 
included: the conversion of color TV broadcasting from the SECAM 
system now used, to the PAL system that conforms to the European 
standard; compensation for the higher transmission charges due 
to public-service TV programs that could not be financed through 
sponsors or from revenue generated by commercials; and a 
budgetary supplement to the subscription fees that were an 
uncertain source of revenue. 
  Laszlo Csucs, the vice president of Hungarian Radio vested 
with full presidential authority, claimed that it could be 
safely said his institution was not placing a heavy financial 
burden on the government. Even after parliament's failure to 
make provisions for Hungarian Radio in this year's budget, the 
government had given Hungarian Radio special-purpose grants of 
only 104 million forints, whereas Hungarian Radio's operating 
budget totaled nearly 6 billion forints. The vice president also 
said that it was strange for the government spokeswoman to lump 
together in her briefing the financing of Hungarian Radio with 
that of MTV and Duna TV respectively. In Hungarian Radio's case 
there was no question of incomprehensibly huge requests 
amounting to billions; Hungarian Radio had requested merely 346 
million forints in all, to support foreign broadcasts and 
Hungarian Radio's ensembles. There could be no doubt that the 
request was justified, Laszlo Csucs pointed out. Foreign 
broadcasts were in the national interest. And the ensembles, 
besides serving the radio, also enhanced the nation's prestige 
with their world-level performances and augmented the nation's 
cultural assets.

  [Text] We have received the following faxed communique 
from a Romanian Government spokesman: 
  The Romanian Government notes with interest and appreciation 
the clarifications made by the former sovereign's secretariat in 
its letter of 16 April 1994, in which the former sovereign 
informs the Romanian authorities of his desire to pay a visit to 
Romania for the Easter holidays, thus emphasizing the particular 
nature of the visit and the fact that he does not intend to 
contest the current constitutional order. On this basis, and 
proceeding from its determination to work for national 
reconciliation, the government invited Romania's former 
sovereign to visit the country and expressed its readiness to 
ensure the proper organization and development of the visit. 
  The invitation was accepted, in principle, by the former 
sovereign of Romania, agreeing that the details of the 
organization, the place, and the program of the visit should be 
worked out later. During the discussions held with the 
representatives of the former sovereign, the Romanian 
authorities presented several proposals, which took into 
consideration the desires expressed by the former sovereign and 
also arranged--with the appropriate protocol and organizational 
level--his activities, accommodations, and participation in 
religious services for the holy Easter holidays, as well as 
various meetings with people wanting to see the guests during 
the visit. The proposals forwarded by the Romanian authorities 
also envisaged the adequate protection and safeguarding of the 
guests as well as the avoidance of any actions liable to lead to 
a disturbance of the public order or the violation of the 
constitutional order. 
  Despite all of the arguments presented and the repeated 
assurances about the Romanian Government's readiness to best 
ensure this visit within the framework of its initially declared 
purpose, the representatives of the former sovereign eventually 
refused to continue the dialogue and go ahead with the visit 
under the accepted conditions. The Romanian Government regrets 
that the Romanian authorities' readiness for dialogue and 
goodwill did not meet with an appropriate response, the 
communique of the government's spokesman concludes. 
  The former sovereign of Romania has renounced his intention 
to visit Romania for the Easter holidays, George Antoniade, 
representative of the former Royal House, announced at a news 
conference. He was authorized by the former sovereign this 
morning to interrupt his talks with the Romanian authorities in 
connection with the planned visit to Romania. The reason given 
for this decision was that the proposals of the Romanian 
authorities on the organization and program of the visit were 
becoming increasingly more restrictive. Mr. George Antoniade 
said that, despite the amiable tone in which his negotiations 
were conducted, as the representative of the Royal House for the 
talks with the Romanian authorities, he found the alternatives 
offered by the latter for the visit unacceptable.

<F P=106> [Article by Iulia Rosca, Cristian Anghelache, and Marius </F>
Huc: "Will the PDSR Cross the Rubicon of One-Party 
Conceitedness?"] 
  [Text] The fourth round of PDSR [Social Democracy Party of 
Romania] and PD [Democratic Party] talks lasted four hours, 
despite initial predictions (two hours). Earlier, Ioan Solcanu 
(from the PDSR) speculated that the dialogue was in danger of 
breaking up because of some statements of Adrian Severin (from 
the PD). The leader of the PDSR delegation [Solcanu] told 
Nord-Est Presse: "We must be restrained." Solcanu was restrained 
only with the representatives of the press who were impatiently 
waiting for the end of the discussions. There was also a desire 
to formulate the intentions of the PDSR in less vague terms. 
Adrian Severin stated clearly that the failure to state these 
intentions in concrete form would lead to the cancellation of 
the discussions set for 20 April. Here are the statements of the 
leaders of the delegations: 
  Adrian Severin, deputy chairman of the Democratic 
Party: ``It seems to us that we should have a round of 
discussions so that we can find out how things will be going 
from now on. We have agreed on some steps to be taken in the 
immediate future, but, I would like to express, at the very 
beginning, my concern about a certain impasse in regard to the 
capacity of this discussion to produce anything concrete. 
  ``We decided that, prior to the next meeting, we must 
receive 
a very concrete response to the proposal for an agreement on 
political conduct (presented by the PD). Today we proposed the 
creation of six joint working groups, which would eventually be 
open to other parties in the opposition. There would be a group 
that would draw up a list of legislative priorities; a group 
analyzing situations in which the lack of independence of the 
judiciary is noted; a group that will analyze situations in 
which abuses or irregularities are noted in local 
administration; another group that would treat the issues of the 
politicization of economic agencies--making leadership positions 
in such organizations dependent upon party membership and the 
establishment of party organizations in enterprises and 
institutions. There is also a group that aims at the isolation 
of extremist parties and intolerant, xenophobic, and 
anti-Semitic movements. 
  ``This is the concrete package of proposals that we made and 
to which we expect a response. We have also received a draft 
plan for parliamentary collaboration to which we will respond. 
Basically, this plan does not upset us. On the contrary, it is 
very welcome. But we cannot agree that the laws on reform should 
pass with only the votes of the PD and the CDR [Romanian 
Democratic Convention], while the laws on restoration should 
pass with the assistance of the four parties that constitute the 
parliamentary majority, along with the PDSR. 
  ``We also decided that, by the next meeting, each one of us 
would present a precise list of subjects related to a political 
pact and a pact on the management of the economy. The PD 
believes that these are preliminary moves in preparation for 
many discussions with the CDR, for the real restructuring of the 
current parliamentary majority. 
  "We are asking the PDSR to clearly state its views in regard 
to this possibility, even though we understand that some of the 
representatives of this party are afraid of losing the bird in 
the hand for two in the bush. We are alarmed by a certain lack 
of decision, an inability `to cross the Rubicon,' `to cut the 
Gordian knot,' lack of decision on the part of the PDSR, which 
slows things down. It is obvious that if we do not obtain 
anything concrete we will have to break off the negotiations set 
for the end of April." 
  Eugen Dijmarescu, Democratic Party senator: "The 
expectations were not too great for the fourth meeting but they 
were greater than what we achieved. I would say, in fact, that 
we achieved very little--actually, another postponement, when, 
in my opinion--a few months after the Democratic Party had put a 
draft national pact on the table and the PDSR had presented an 
alternative formula--the premises existed for moving on to the 
discussion of the main ideas which could lead to a document 
which we would offer as an opening to other political forces, 
with a view to the restructuring of the parliamentary majority. 
The PDSR came up with a proposal on the achievement of an 
agreement on parliamentary cooperation between the two parties, 
with more limited point-by-point objectives compared to the 
national pact. Unfortunately, the PDSR presented it late, the 
night before the meeting, making it impossible to have a 
thorough discussion and to put it in a form in which it could be 
signed quickly. Therefore, we proposed that both parties 
reexamine both documents more carefully, that they also reach an 
agreement on their behavior, with a moratorium on agression and, 
possibly, set up joint working groups on matters related to 
reform and all that the transition signifies." 
  Ioan Solcanu, deputy chairman of the PDSR: ``It 
was a meeting at which we evaluated the status of consultations 
between the two parties and we agreed that we should go beyond 
the listing of theoretical possibilities and take concrete 
steps. Therefore, we presented a draft of a political pact which 
is certainly subject to improvement. This is why we presented it 
in this form. It would have taken some time to discuss the draft 
at the current session since we are not in agreement about the 
stage at which the respective draft was drawn up. We decided 
that this possibility of drawing up principles and subject 
matter for a draft of a political accord and a draft plan for 
economic management would be on the agenda for a future meeting 
between the two parties. Also, the PDSR presented a document on 
an agreement on parliamentary collaboration and the PD presented 
a draft agreement on political conduct. 
  "We agreed that the point-by-point development of the two 
documents presented by the two parties would be on the agenda 
for the next meeting."

  [Text] Belgrade, April 28 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslavia 
(Serbia/Montenegro) should insist that the first stage of easing 
U.N. sanctions should include the lifting of the export ban in 
order that fresh money might be obtained for reviving 
production, says Yugoslav economic expert Oskar Kovac. 
Unstopping of the inflow of foreign exchange is the best way to 
financial consolidation, Kovac said in an interview to TANJUG, 
specifying that part of the revenue would be used to replenish 
the foreign exchange coffers, and the rest for investments. 
  The exporters will be grappling with difficulties even after 
the lifting of the sanctions, however, because countries like 
the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and the Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Slovenia have already taken the advantage 
of the anti-Yugoslav sanctions to seize a good part of the 
Western European market which had belonged to the Yugoslav 
exporters before the sanctions, Kovac warned. The U.N. Security 
Council clamped the sanctions on Yugoslavia in May 1992 for its 
alleged involvement in civil war raging in neighbouring 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The biggest difficulty after the sanctions will be to regain 
the international financial markets, said Kovac and explained 
that the basic precondition for this was a sharing of the assets 
of the former Yugoslav federation with the breakaway republics 
and the creditors' estimate of Yugoslavia's credit rating. As 
for the future foreign borrowing, it will, whether we want it or 
not, depend primarily on the repayment of old debts, said Kovac. 
He explained that the later stage of the lifting of the 
sanctions would set in motion debt rescheduling talks with the 
Paris Club of creditors and the commercial banks. With the 
already high foreign indebtedness, future foreign borrowing 
should be kept at the minimum, Kovac believes. 
  In order to put the domestic economy back on its feet, 
Yugoslavia should think of seeking a combined structural 
adjustement and financial adjustment loan from the World Bank 
which offers rather flexible conditions, Kovac stressed.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Lojze Peterle held two news 
conferences today. At the first, Peterle spoke about current 
Slovene-Italian relations and commented on statements made by 
certain Italian politicians. At the regular monthly news 
conference that he held in the afternoon, Minister Peterle spoke 
about the Foreign Ministry's activities. Here is a report by 
Igor Juric: 
  [Begin Juric recording] Minister Peterle first said that our 
state does not take the statements made so far as official 
stands as they were not made at an official level. 
Nevertheless, it remains to be seen how interstate relations 
will further develop. He assessed the cooperation with Italy 
thus far as positive on the whole; our cooperation within nine 
state commissions as well as on the economy had been good. Soon 
after Italy's recognition of Slovenia, the issue of the 
succession of agreements with the former Yugoslavia had been 
settled. Within this framework, the question of the property of 
Italian refugees that some people are bringing up anew was 
settled. In this respect, Minister Peterle said that within the 
process of joining Europe, it is no problem for us to take on 
the obligation that foreign citizens should also have the right 
to purchase real estate, as we have never differentiated among 
people. Therefore, Peterle sees no reason for Italy to be 
placing further obstacles in the way of us joining European 
integration, as has happened. It is true that Italy always 
withdraws its statements in the end. 
  Minister Peterle does not think that the new politicians 
might aggravate relations with us, as the European Union does 
not want to deal with any more problems. He sees Italy in the 
future as a strategic partner, with whom we will enjoy good 
neighborly relations that would set an example to others. 
  As regards the initiative for Istria as a European region, 
Peterle said that Slovenia supports ideas on close border 
cooperation, but by no means supports an establishment of some 
kind of supra-state region. However, his opinion is that it is 
not right for the Italians to speak about the position of their 
minority in Slovenia and Croatia, as if there were no 
differences between the states. Namely, the position of 
minorities in Slovenia is established according to the highest 
European standards. 
  At the afternoon news conference, Minister Peterle expressed 
pleasure that the Economic-Social Council of the European Union 
adopted a statement today saying that our state will be ready 
for full membership of the Union by the end of the century. 
  As regards the talks in Pineta [about the Slovene demand for 
Bosnian refugees to be evacuated from Slovene holiday resorts to 
the Croatian Adriatic coast], Peterle said that his ministry 
does not have any instruments to help it transfer the refugees. 
The only thing that we possess is the Croatian Government's 
assurance. 
  There has been a standstill in relations with Croatia 
regarding the border issue, as the other side is showing no real 
will to do anything. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] Sarajevo, April 28 (AFP) -- A group of special 
foreign envoys held talks Thursday [28 April] with UN Bosnian 
commander General Sir Michael Rose amid controversy over his 
remarks castigating Bosnian Moslems for trying to drag the UN 
into the war in Gorazde. Envoys from the United States, Russia 
and Europe -- a special contact group which has been given a 
week to look into ways of resuming the bogged down Bosnian peace 
talks -- held talks with Rose, UN civil affairs coordinator for 
Bosnia Viktor Andreyev and his counterpart for the whole 
ex-Yugoslavia, Sergio Vieira de Mello, a spokeswoman said. 
[passage omitted] 
  Envoys from the special contact group here were named as 
Charles Redman and two assistants, Nick Lang and Hoyt Yee, 
representing the United States, Alexey Nikiforov, deputy to 
Vitaliy Churkin, the Russian envoy to former Yugoslavia, David 
Manning and David Ludlow of Britain, Michael Steiner of Germany, 
and French envoys Jean-Pierre Masse and Jacques-Alain de Sedouy. 
The envoys had not yet drawn up an agenda. The Bosnian 
authorities had been in touch for possible contacts, the 
spokeswoman added. An UNPROFOR spokesman said earlier that the 
envoys were operating individually and dispersing around the 
city. 
  The envoys were also to travel to Pale, the Bosnian Serb 
stronghold some 15 kilometres (10 miles) east of the city, for 
talks with separatist leaders who hold 70 percent of Bosnian 
territory and have proclaimed a breakaway republic. The 
international community is attempting to create impetus for 
negotiations following a NATO ultimatum that obliged Serb forces 
to withdraw from the immediate vicinity of Gorazde and pull back 
their heavy weapons to a distance of at least 20 kilometres.

  [Excerpt] [Announcer] President Lech Walesa, who took part 
in ceremonies today to mark the 70th anniversary of the National 
Bank of Poland, said he would support Prime Minister Waldemar 
Pawlak in bringing the strike situation under control. 
  [Walesa] "I will try to support the young prime minister. I 
have experience with strikes--the polystyrene strikes, for 
example. The prime minister has less experience, so we will 
have to think about support where it is possible, while trying 
to ensure that there are no mistakes in the decisions. 
  This matter has been going on too long. It really should 
have been resolved much earlier." 
  [Announcer] The president denied that he was pleased that 
there were strikes. 
  [Walesa] "I hear that it's a good thing for me that the 
strikes are continuing. I hear it...[Walesa pauses] Well, 
Lepper, you can say he's not to be taken seriously, but serious 
people--I think it was Bronislaw Geremek who said that it was 
good for me that the strikes were continuing. [sentence as 
heard] That's getting hold of the wrong end of the stick 
completely. I oppose strikes, although I went on strike many 
times myself, but that was when there was no other way to settle 
matters." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by W.K.: "The Candidacy of Siwiec Accepted by </F>
Olechowski; Priorities of Foreign Policy"] 
  [Text] The security of our country, the issue of European 
Union [EU] membership, and policy toward our Eastern neighbors 
and the Central and East European countries--these are the four 
priorities of Polish diplomacy that were submitted yesterday to 
members of the Sejm Foreign Affairs Committee by Foreign 
Minister Andrzej Olechowski. On 12 May, Minister Olechowski is 
supposed to deliver an official speech in the Sejm in which he 
will present the goals of our country's foreign policy. 
  The head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MON] stated 
that 
one of the main goals of the Polish diplomatic service is to 
make the Polish defense system compatible with that of NATO as 
soon as possible. He said that, in its striving for EU 
membership, Poland intends to take advantage of the period in 
which the EU will be chaired by Germany. It will want to obtain 
further commitments concerning Poland's admission to the 
"Twelve." While speaking about Eastern policy, Olechowski, who 
has left on a private visit to Moscow, stressed the need to 
enliven Polish-Russian contacts, so that they could reach the 
level of development that has been achieved with Western states. 
Olechowski expressed the view that it must be agreed with Russia 
that "we disagree on global issues" and that we must try to 
cooperate in all other areas. 
  The minister also emphasized that Poland is satisfied with 
the level of cooperation within the Visegrad Group. In reply to 
a question concerning the chances of Marek Siwiec (of the 
Democratic Left Alliance) filling the post of deputy foreign 
affairs minister, the MON head revealed that he likes this 
candidate for the position. While speaking about changes in the 
organization of the ministry, Olechowski said that people in the 
posts of deputy ministers will create foreign policy along with 
the head of the ministry and will fulfill representative 
functions in both Poland and abroad. They will not, however, 
steer the ministry or "any of its sections." 
  Committee Chairman Bronisaw Geremek divulged that one of the 
problems of Poland's Eastern policy is the stand on the 
possibility of a conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Geremek 
said that, on this issue, the opinions of the committee's 
members are divided. Some of them believe that, if such a 
conflict erupts, we should keep out of it. Others believe that 
if Ukraine's independence is jeopardized, it will prove that 
Russia's imperialism is reviving. Therefore, the committee 
chairman stated, it is necessary to closely follow developments 
in the CIS. 
  Geremek stressed that the session of the committee and the 
forthcoming debate in the Sejm prove that the discussion on our 
country's foreign policy is becoming increasingly more 
democratic. Asked why the meeting of the committee was closed to 
the press at the last moment, the chairman stated that the 
minister had requested it because he wanted his Sejm speech "not 
to lose the charm of freshness."

  [Text] The declaration on the government's intentions 
until the end of the year, presented by Prime Minister Lyuben 
Berov in parliament, the subsequent ultimatum-like statements of 
the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP], the attempts to apply 
pressure to effect certain personnel and structural changes in 
the cabinet, and the attempts to blame specific members of the 
cabinet for the situation, especially Deputy Prime Minister 
Karabashev, only demonstrate political ambitions aimed at 
implementing narrow party interests. This is pointed out in a 
declaration of the parliamentary faction of the New Alliance for 
Democracy [NSD], sent to BTA by its Cochairman Stefan Bozhilov. 
  According to the document, the NSD will not participate in 
the talks on structural and personnel changes in the cabinet. 
  Professor Petur Markov, member of the NSD parliamentary 
faction, told a BTA correspondent that this declaration reflects 
the opinion of only a part of the NSD parliamentarians. He said 
he does not support the declaration.

<F P=106> [Article by Marton Kozak: "Backfiring Propaganda; Radio and </F>
TV Remain the Citizens' Main Source of Information"] 
  [Text] At the time of the change of political systems, 
people trusted the media the most. By now that trust has been 
deeply shaken. But it will be appropriate to draw the same 
distinction between the media that also the government has 
made--namely, to distinguish between the print media and the 
electronic media. (In practice, the electronic media in Hungary 
mean state-run radio and television.) According to the results 
of a recently conducted poll, mistrust of the electronic media 
is greater than of the print media: 26.7 percent of the 
respondents did not trust radio and television at all, as 
compared with 17.9 percent who mistrusted the print media. But 
even though they have lost much of their credibility, radio and 
television remain the population's main source of political 
information. After all, nearly 70 percent of the population 
listens to or watches news programs on radio or television, 
whereas only every other family learns about the political 
situation from the print media. 
  Formally, of course, everything is in order. Jozsef P. 
Szabo, 
who is responsible for Hungarian Radio's election-related 
programming, said before the 4 March dismissals that Hungarian 
Radio had reached agreement with the political forces inside and 
outside parliament, to everyone's satisfaction. The participants 
(representatives of the six parliamentary parties) in the 
debates broadcast every Sunday afternoon on the 
Visszaszamlalas '94 [Countdown '94] program determine 
by lot the sequence in which they speak; each one may speak for 
the same length of time; the parties chose jointly the topics 
for discussion; and they reached a consensus on who would be the 
hosts moderating the debates. After the purge on 4 March, 
however, this no longer seems possible, and not just because the 
events that had taken place a week and a half before Freedom of 
the Press Day [15 March] nullified the already reached 
compromises. Jozsef P. Szabo, who earlier had been acceptable to 
everyone, no longer enjoys the support of every political force; 
and Laszlo Rapcsanyi, who has been designated to host the 
all-day election program on 8 May, is in the same situation. 
Because they were chosen by consensus, none of the 
Visszaszamlalas '94 hosts has been fired, but one of 
them has handed in his resignation as an expression of his 
indignation. In spite of all this, the fact remains that 
Hungarian Radio's news broadcasts still exceed by far the news 
programs on MTV [Hungarian Television] in terms of credibility 
and objectivity. At least for the time being. Because in MTV's 
case there was never even any illusion of credibility and 
objectivity. It will be remembered that Foreign Minister Geza 
Jeszenszky was the first to use the expression "[military] 
position" three years ago, when he was talking about there being 
on MTV also programs that were not government-unfriendly (read: 
programs that refrained from even mild criticism of the 
government). Occupying these positions--the most important news 
programs, in other words--Vice President Gabor Nahlik was better 
able than Laszlo Csucs, his counterpart at Hungarian Radio, to 
banish quickly and with less trouble every possible 
characteristic of a public-service institution. Since then MTV, 
transformed in compliance with the letter of the law, has been 
functioning as the freely elected government's propaganda organ. 
Months go by without the viewers being able to watch a debate in 
which representatives of parties holding contrasting views are 
participating; without any opportunity for the leaders of the 
opposition to speak out. 
  But that world will soon be coming to an end. As Election 
Day 
approaches, willy-nilly also other parties will have to be given 
a role. For even if the spirit of the laws attempting to set the 
competitive multiparty system's rules of the game has completely 
failed to interest, respectively, the management of MTV and the 
government, which in 1974 reserved for itself supervision of 
that institution, it does not behoove them even these days to 
thumb their noses at the letter of the law. Indeed, for the 
duration of the election campaign, Vice President Nahlik has 
ordered the establishment of a programming bureau and operations 
committee, as a sort of example of the application of the 
otherwise scarcely used BBC Code of Ethics. The task of the 
committee will be, among other things, to coordinate and control 
the elections-related duties of the MTV, and to maintain contact 
with the political parties. The chairman of the six-man 
committee is Laszlo Juhasz, the news director. Among its members 
we find Istvan G. Palfy, Istvan Petak, Teletext editor in chief 
Gabor Szucs, Emil Tallos and Balazs Varkonyi. From this list it 
is obvious that the vice president made no attempt to balance on 
an apothecary scale the committee's composition, in accordance 
with the political sympathies and antipathies of its members. 
Two distinct views have emerged regarding how the elections 
might be affected by the transformation of Hungarian Radio and 
MTV into the government's propaganda institution. For that is 
what they have become, and the fact that before 8 May also the 
representatives of other parties will be allowed to go before 
the microphones and face the TV cameras does not alter the 
situation. 
  One view holds that occupation of the state-controlled 
electronic media was a mistake even from the viewpoint of the 
occupiers' self-interest. Actually, this view finds support in 
two axioms of communications theory. The first axiom states that 
the mass media are suitable for reinforcing, rather than 
changing, views that have already been formed. In other words, 
the mass media are able to reinforce the sympathizers' sympathy 
and escalate the activists' activity to ecstasy, but they are 
unsuitable for reversing a generally negative attitude. 
According to the other axiom, even if the mass media happen to 
change an opinion, the changes can apply only to things outside 
the scope of the recipient's direct experience. And it is very 
likely that the hammering in of opinions which are in conflict 
with everyday experience, "the propaganda of successes," will 
backfire. 
  The view, generally accepted among media experts, that 
isolation from information and contrasting opinions is a 
prerequisite for successful brainwashing bodes a dismal future 
from the government's point of view. Yet dependence on state-run 
television is declining practically day by day because, during 
nearly a third of their total viewing time, TV viewers watch 
satellite- or cable-TV programs, rather than those of the MTV. 
The standpoint of those who claim that the government-run media 
are ineffective appears to gain support from another view which 
holds that, by occupying the electronic media, it is possible to 
influence only those for whom radio and television are the only 
source of information. But specifically this stratum comprising 
persons with a low educational level is less interested in 
politics and, very likely, will not even bother to vote. It will 
be remembered that the highest voter turnout to date is around 
66 percent, and the turnout in May is unlikely to be any higher. 
  Thus, based on our knowledge of communications theory, it 
can 
be said that the victory won in the media war will prove a 
Pyrrhic one. Taking also considerations of social history and 
social psychology into account, however, no one can be very 
certain of that. The main message from forcing radio and 
television to their knees is demonstration of who is master in 
the house. From this point of view it is not really essential 
whether or not the voters are able to acquaint themselves with 
the political parties; whether they are able to confront the 
government with its promises; and how many whole-evening Boross 
interviews there are for every opportunity to read Horn's lips 
or for each one-minute appearance by Kuncze. What will be 
decisive in the end is whether Hungary's citizens will be 
willing to accept the old cast. It would do no harm, of course, 
if we were able to learn that also from radio and television.

<F P=106> [Report by Elizabeth Diaz Sotero at Los Pinos Presidencial </F>
Palace from the "ACIR Radio News" newscast] 
  [Text] At noon today, we said that calm had returned to the 
official Los Pinos residence. But this does not mean inactivity. 
At approximately 1400 today, the president held a meeting with 
members of the national security cabinet: National Defense 
Secretary Antonio Riviello Bazan, Government Secretary Jorge 
Carpizo McGregor, Attorney General Diego Valadez, Federal 
District Attorney General Humberto Benitez Trevillo, and 
National Security General Director Jorge Tello Pon. 
  Although we do not have any official information on this 
meeting, we believe the president and his officials must have 
discussed, among other matters, the appointment of Dr. Cordoba 
Montoya as Mexico's new permanent representative to the 
Inter-American Development Bank, headquartered in Washington; 
the general situation in the country; Chiapas issues; Luis 
Donaldo Colosio's murder; and, quite probably, how Mexico and 
especially Mexico City will get along in the coming days. 
  Although it has not been officially announced, it seems 
President Salinas de Gortari will take a few days of rest after 
all and go to Agualeguas, Nuevo Leon. This is one of two times 
during the year that he takes a holiday. This has not been 
officially confirmed, but it seems everything is ready for him 
in Agualeguas. Therefore, he must have talked with his officials 
about how things will go in Mexico City during his probable 
absence.

<F P=106> [Report by Alma Rosa Baez at the Mexican Finance Secretariat </F>
from the "ACIR Radio News" newscast] 
  [Text] Good afternoon. The Finance Secretariat has issued a 
short communique that reads as follows: 
  Dr. Pedro Aspe, the finance and public credit secretary, has 
appointed Dr. Jose Cordoba Montoya as the Mexican representative 
to the Inter-American Development Bank [IDB], which has its 
headquarters in Washington. Dr. Jose Cordoba was chief of the 
Office of the Presidency of the republic until today. 
  The Finance Secretariat has not released any more details on 
this information. It is important, however, to tell our 
listeners that the IDB governors will meet in Guadalajara from 8 
to 13 April. Mexico is hosting this meeting. It will be the 
first official event handled by Mr. Jose Cordoba Montoya. 
Cordoba Montoya was the chief of the Office of the Presidency of 
the republic and, until today, was in charge of all the advisers 
of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. 
  The IDB is very important within the international economic 
sector. It groups all nations, especially developing nations. At 
least 23 countries are expected to attend the meeting in 
Guadalajara. Representatives of all those countries will meet 
with the IDB in that city. Jose Cordoba Montoya will probably 
have to move to Washington because all the governors handle 
their countries' IDB concerns from its headquarters. This is the 
information we have now.

<F P=106> [Report by Radio ACIR Program Director Guillermo Ochoa from </F>
the "Panorama" newscast] 
  [Text] A man armed with a .38 caliber gun was arrested 
yesterday during the event to nominate Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de 
Leon as the PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] presidential 
candidate. Members of the presidential general staff arrested 
the man just a few steps from the multiple purpose room where 
the appointment was announced. The man's name is Miguel Angel 
Bernal Vargas and he was taken to the Attorney General's Office 
7th Agency located at the Cuahtemoc Station. 
  Bernal Vargas said he is a member of the General Secretariat 
of Safety and Roads, and that his mission was to an act as an 
ear in the event. He was disguised, sorry to say, wearing a 
jacket with many pockets, like the ones used by photographers 
and hunters. These jackets are useful as they can hold film and 
other supplies in all the pockets. That is the way this 
individual was disguised. 
  Inasmuch as persons entering the hall were being searched, 
it 
was discovered this man was carrying a .38 caliber gun in a 
small bag. He was arrested and turned over to the 7th Police 
Station [as heard]. Mr. Lievano Sanchez, PRI secretary of 
information and propaganda, confirmed the arrest of this man, 
who claimed he was acting as an ear. 
  This is a regrettable practice of some government offices 
and 
people, and even the Federal Army. They send individuals 
disguised as photographers to certain events so that they can 
prepare a detailed report on not only what was said, for example 
in a news conference, but also of the reactions, attitudes, and 
so forth. They prepare very special reports for certain people 
or certain offices. They simply carry a recorder or a 
photographer's jacket and are sent to these events. Sometimes, 
they carry a recorder and pose as radio reporters, other times, 
they carry a camera and pose as photographers. They mingle with 
the rest of the reporters and then go and present their private 
reports. 
  Unfortunately, this is a method frequently used by 
government 
offices. In this case, who knows who sent this ear, but he must 
not be very intelligent because the ear was carrying a gun to 
cover an event of this type. This is unbelievable, truly 
unbelievable.

<F P=106> [Report by Dora Elena Cortes and Manuel Cordero: "Colosio, </F>
Victim of a Plot; Accomplice Arrested"] 
  [Text] Tijuana, B.C. [Baja California], 27 Mar -- Before 
dawn on 27 March, the Attorney General's Office [PGR] arrested 
Tranquilino Sanchez Vega, an aide to General Domiro Garcia 
Reyes, whom the Presidential Staff put in charge of the security 
around Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta. Sanchez has been 
interrogated since early morning on his presumed complicity in 
the attack that left the Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI] 
presidential candidate dead. 
  The revealing pictures of Robert Gauthier, a news 
photographer for THE SAN DIEGO UNION, changed the course of the 
investigations, after the PGR reported through its chief, Diego 
Valades, that only one person had fired at the PRI presidential 
candidate. In one of the pictures taken minutes before the 
attack in Lomas Taurinas and published by Associated Press (AP), 
we can see when Sanchez, wearing a dark leather jacket and cap 
with a badge in front, extends his right arm toward the 
candidate and reaches over the shoulder of Colosio, who has his 
back to Sanchez. 
  The release of these pictures and statements by doctors, 
specialists, policemen, and authorities who are close to the 
case, as well as statements residents gave to EL UNIVERSAL, 
support the possibility that Luis Colosio may have been murdered 
as a victim of a plot possibly involving members of his security 
staff. Sources who were questioned said that "at least three 
persons shot at Luis Colosio." The first shot came from 
Colosio's left side; the second one, which hit Colosio in the 
abdomen, from his right side; and the third one --apparently 
shot by Mario Aburto Martinez -- was fired at the candidate's 
head as he was falling to the ground. Everything seems to 
indicate that the three shots were fired simultaneously and that 
the assassins were within the security ring around the 
candidate, which is a usual practice in every presidential tour. 
It was said that there were snipers around. 
  The report on the plot to assassinate the candidate was 
corroborated by the alleged involvement of individuals 
responsible for Colosio's security, as well as by big logistical 
mistakes made during his tour to Tijuana. Last-minute changes in 
the schedule and adjustments to the podium from which Colosio 
would speak in Lomas Taurinas attributed to the General Staff 
make us think that the PRI candidate was not murdered by one 
person alone, as the PGR stated. 
  Sources close to the PGR spoke about the commotion caused by 
the pictures taken by the San Diego reporter. Said pictures were 
immediately taken to PGR authorities in this city. One of these 
pictures, published in the 25 March issue of THE SAN DIEGO 
UNION, shows the PRI presidential candidate, and to his right is 
Vicente Mayoral Valenzuela, former judicial agent, whom the PGR 
arrested immediately after the assassination. The PGR later 
announced that it would set him free "as the law stipulates." 
One of his two children, who were part of Colosio's security 
team, is next to Mayoral. 
  A few steps behind Colosio (in the same picture), we can see 
assassin Mario Aburto Martinez, and right next to him we can see 
a tall and muscular individual who is wearing a dark leather 
jacket and a cap with a badge on the front. He was later 
identified as Tranquilino Sanchez Vega. On his left arm, he is 
wearing an band with Colosio's name on it. Staff Gen. Garcia 
Reyes is right next to him. 
  The second picture clearly shows how both individuals 
(Aburto Martinez and Sanchez Vega) advance until Aburto 
positions himself on the right-hand side of the candidate and 
Sanchez Vega is behind the alleged killer, with the right hand 
(of Sanchez Vega) pointing towards the abdomen of the candidate. 
He remains standing next to a stocky individual, the staff 
general, who, according to eyewitnesses, was always accompanied 
by Tranquilino Sanchez. 
  Members of the security corps who were hired by the PRI 
Municipal Direction Committee in Tijuana to guard the candidate 
said Gen. Domiro Garcia Reyes, together with Tranquilino Sanchez 
Vega, ordered them to remove the white band bearing Colosio's 
name from their arms, which they had decided to wear to identify 
themselves. 
  In THE SAN DIEGO UNION photograph, it can be seen that 
Tranquilino Sanchez, who was captured early this morning, wore 
the aforementioned band, without Domiro Garcia Reyes asking him 
to remove it, as he had done with the rest of the security 
agents. 
  Without going into great detail, Humberto Sanoja Morrell, 
one 
of those in charge of the security group under the municipal 
PRI, confirmed to EL UNIVERSAL that they had been ordered to 
remove the band and leave the area "because the candidate did 
not like security." Sanoja Morrell affirmed that both he and 
Rodolfo Rivapalacio, who coordinated the group of security 
agents, had gathered some 125 agents to form a barrier guarding 
the candidate's path, but insisted they were ordered to leave 
the area. Sanoja Morrell denied the PRI hired these security 
people (including former State Judicial Police agents) because 
most of them volunteered to participate in the campaign, as is 
customary during electoral campaigns. He denied knowing 
Tranquilino Sanchez Vega and said he was not a member of the 
security staff (local security). 
  Meanwhile, sources we talked with told us that Colosio was 
taken to Lomas Taurinas without heeding the warning that it was 
one of the most dangerous parts of town, not only because of the 
high crime rate but because security conditions could not be 
guaranteed there. They revealed the PRI decided to set up the 
speaker's stand in front of an enormous wall painted with the 
word Colosio "that would serve as protection for the PRI 
candidate, but because of an order by the Presidential staff 
that accompanied him, the stand was set up above the wall, on 
the hill, leaving Colosio absolutely unprotected. [no closing 
quotation marks as published] 
  Eglantina Esquivel de Abad, a PRI member who publishes a 
bulletin in Tijuana, said in an interview with this newspaper 
that they apparently tried to assassinate the candidate when he 
addressed the crowd, but the presence of children next to 
Colosio prevented this from happening. Eglantina said she saw 
when Aburto Martinez arrived at the crime scene, accompanied by 
Vicente Mayoral Valenzuela, former head of homicide of Judicial 
Police in Tijuana. She explained that both Mayoral and a tall 
and robust man (seemingly Sanchez Vega) always accompanied 
Aburto Martinez. 
  "When Colosio spoke they appeared nervous, as if they were 
preparing themselves to do something bad, but since they were 
unable to attack him at that moment, they began to follow him 
and always had direct access to the candidate," Eglantina noted. 
After the attack took place, she burst into tears hysterically 
accusing Mayoral of being one of the assassins. 
  The interviewee asserted that a PGR official sought her 
afterward to notify her she would have to appear before the PGR 
"because my testimony would be very valuable. I refused, 
however, because I did not know if he was really an official or 
they were trying to shut me up because I was a witness." 
  Eglantina affirmed that she later went to the PGR office 
accompanied by her two sons and a state police agent she had 
known for a long time, "but once I arrived there, they just kept 
me isolated in an office until 0200 on Thursday, because no one 
ever interrogated me." Apparently, Eglantina Esquivel conceded, 
"what they were trying to do was to keep my mouth shut because I 
had seen who attacked the candidate." She insisted she was never 
questioned in connection with the assassination. Eglantina 
referred to the way in which the candidate was evacuated from 
the area, as well as the cragginess of the terrain, which made 
it impossible to think of a quick exit in case of an emergency. 
  Sources we consulted, who have participated in logistical 
tasks in previous presidential campaigns, said "no person 
responsible for the security of a candidate should have ever 
allowed a rally to be held in such place as Lomas Taurinas." 
Local PRI figured emphasized that "in this case, apparently 
there was strong interest by the organizers of Colosio's 
campaign that he appear there." They explained that Jaime 
Martinez Veloz, Solidarity deputy delegate, was tasked with 
organizing the event at the request of Mario Luis Fuentes, 
former general director of Solidarity and current social 
participation coordinator of the Colosio campaign. Both 
officials have worked closely with former Public Education 
Secretary Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon. 
  PRI members themselves have revealed that fellow members 
from Baja California are outraged by the fact that Zedillo Ponce 
de Leon, despite being originally from that area and PRI 
campaign manager, was not in Baja California, arguing that he 
wanted to avoid any speculation regarding his possible candidacy 
to the Baja California Government. 
  PRI militants who were interviewed and who insisted on 
pointing out other reasons justifing that Zedillo did not 
accompany Colosio in his native state, added: "For heaven's 
sake, no one is more qualified to represent the PRI in our state 
than Zedillo." 
  Logistics experts have also pointed out the lack of a 
mechanism of immediate attention to the candidate: "In the 
middle of a campaign, those in charge of logistics are the first 
to visit the states the candidate is scheduled to visit, and 
makes arrangements with a hospital so that it will be prepared 
to offer its services in case of an emergency. In addition to 
this, blood for the candidate (particularly, in Colosio's case 
because his blood type was considered uncommon) and a Mexican 
Social Security Institute [IMSS] ambulance are taken along 
during the entire political tour. 
  On this occasion, both of these aspects were ignored. The 
candidate was taken to the General Hospital, a Health 
Secretariat institution that lacked medical equipment and 
instruments, and donors were solicited because blood was not 
available. They note that no IMSS ambulance or any other 
hospital was available at the incident's site so at first, he 
had to be put in a suburban van to be moved later to a Delta-7 
rescue unit, which lacked the equipment needed to attend to the 
emergency. Policemen questioned confirm that Colosio was taken 
to the General Hospital the long way -- it took 20 minutes -- 
when he could have been taken to IMSS Clinic 20, which would 
have been taken at most five minutes. 
  An expert in providing security services to prominent 
persons 
from California State was questioned about all of this, and when 
he took a look at the second photo taken by the reporter from 
San Diego, he categorically said that: "I hope this man (Sanchez 
Vega) forgives me, but he is getting ready to shoot in this 
phote. I believe he was one of the men who shot Colosio in the 
abdomen." He emphasized the way in which Sanchez Vega keeps his 
arm above Colosio's shoulder, and stated that "that is a 
shooting position, and therefore, this situation must be 
clarified by Mexican federal authorities." 
  Another one of Gauthier's photographs, which shows Colosio 
lying on his stomach, destroys the PGR argument claiming that 
Colosio Murrieta was shot by one person, with an initial shot to 
the head as stated by Attorney General Diego Valadez. Valadez 
said that when Colosio had walked a distance of approximately 10 
meters in the crowd, Mario Aburto Martinez, the presumed 
perpetrator, who was on Colosio's right, drew a revolver, placed 
it to Colosio's right temple and pulled the trigger, mortally 
wounding Colosio. 
  "When he was shot in his right temple, with an exit hole in 
the corresponding left temple, the victim turned around 
counterclockwise, and while he was falling down, the attacker 
pulled the trigger again to produce a second wound in the 
abdominal area, where the bullet entered through the 
hypogastrium and exited in the region of the right 
hypochondrium." 
  Guillermo Castorena and Alvaro Garcia Taxilaga, Colosio's 
doctors, signed an initial report establishing that Colosio 
received two bullet wounds: one in the region of the skull 
entering through the right temporal bone and exiting through the 
left parietal bone. Other doctors who were consulted said the 
said report indicates that Colosio was shot in the skull; the 
bullet entered the right temple and exited "through the small 
bone located above the left temple." Meanwhile, the second shot 
was in the abdomen, entering below his left rib and exiting in 
the region of the right rib. 
  Doctors who performed surgery on the PRI presidential 
candidate gave EL UNIVERSAL assurances that the body of the 
unfortunate man apparently received three shots from three 
different weapons: two apparently .38-caliber specials and one 
of apparently smaller caliber, perhaps .22 or .25-caliber. 
  This coincides with the innocent remarks made on a radio 
station by renown Tijuana cardiologist Patricia Aubanel Riedel, 
whose past successes include "open heart" surgery on Nobel peace 
prize winner Mother Theresa of Calcutta. During an interview on 
XEC Radio the day after Colosio's death, the cardiologist told 
commentator Jesus Arnoldo Lopez Salcido: "He received two 
different shots; one of them, which entered on the right side of 
the brain in the area of the temple, came from a .38-caliber 
revolver; the other, from a .22-caliber revolver, apparently 
entered the left side of his abdomen in the sub-thoraxic area, 
which led the team of doctors to believe that there had been two 
shots." 
  The commentator asked the doctor if she meant that two 
different weapons had been used, to which she answered: "This is 
what we thought (the doctors who saw Colosio's body) and those 
are our observations (while we were treating the candidate), 
although we have not yet read the legal expert's report. It is 
our assumption." Later, in response to the commentator's 
insistence on finding out if two persons fired at the candidate, 
Aubanel Riedel answered: "Yes, I believe so. The reports will 
establish that." The reports did not mention it, however. 
Instead, they presented a totally different picture: one weapon, 
a Brazilian-made "Taurus" .38 special fired by one man, Mario 
Aburto Martinez, 23. 
  Confidential reports provided to EL UNIVERSAL reveal that 
Dr. 
Aubanel Riedel's statements greatly upset Attorney General Diego 
Valadez, who issued instructions to "fix that." During 
subsequent interviews Dr. Aubanel attempted to recant what she 
had said but there is a recording of the interview. 
Coincidentally, Doctor Rosalina Guerra, director of the General 
Hospital (where the late PRI candidate was treated), on the same 
evening (of Dr. Aubanel's interview) also made statements on a 
local television newscast. Dr. Guerra answered, among others, a 
very specific question: Could the doctors establish whether the 
wounds were caused by a certain weapon. Guerra categorically 
denied this possibility, adding: "Doctors can only determine the 
caliber of the weapon." We asked doctors on both sides of the 
border (Tijuana and San Diego) about this and they said, 
virtually without even thinking: "Of course; we can determine 
perfectly well if the wounds were caused by guns of different 
caliber, but we always prefer to wait for confirmation by 
experts." 
  Another of the doctors who treated Luis Donaldo Colosio in 
the operating room, shocked by his death, complained of "how 
filthy all of this was" and asserted that the candidate had not 
been shot twice but three times. Hospital personnel who by 
reason of their profession were able to get close to the 
operating room, confirmed this and even gave assurances that 
"very strange things happened; for example, members of the 
Presidential General Staff did not allow doctors from Mexico 
City to treat the patient or to enter the operating room while 
he was still alive." The personnel in question said an 
altercation took place between Presidential General Staff 
members and representatives from the PGR over this situation, 
but the latter prevailed because they said they were in charge 
of the situation. As a result, only local specialists and 
doctors treated the candidate. 
  Eleven doctors treated Colosio and "none of them were from 
Mexico City; all of them were local doctors," insisted a source 
who added that two autopsies were conducted on the candidate's 
body: one by the Tijuana Forensic Medicine Service (Semefo) by 
Doctors Gustavo Salazar and Esteban Chapital, and another by 
Federal District doctors accompanied by members of the Federal 
Judicial Police. 
  Criminologists, who were asked about how Colosio was 
wounded, said it is improbable his body would have acted the way 
the attorney general said had the first shot been to the head. 
They said that definitely, the shots to the lower part of his 
body must have been fired first because there are reports that 
Colosio put his hands on his abdomen and he would not have been 
able to do that had the first shot been to his brain. 
  Some policemen have explained: "If you want to kill someone 
you bring him down first and then you finish him off with a shot 
to the head." The policemen noted that considering the height of 
the victim and that of the killer, it appears impossible Colosio 
could have received the wounds officially reported. The 
policemen noted: "Have you seen how bulls tumble when they are 
dealt the coup de grace with a dagger? This is how Colosio would 
have dropped had the first shot been to the head." They went on: 
"The body goes limp and flabby and the arms fall to the side of 
the body." 
  Anibal Colosio, a cousin of the late candidate who was at 
the 
site, said that immediately after the attack, he saw Colosio 
fall "to his knees." According to some people, Colosio placed 
his hands on his abdomen. Others claim they heard at least three 
shots. This apparently is confirmed by a picture taken by 
Gauthier. The picture shows Colosio's position when he fell. It 
shows his back and his hands as if trying to grab his stomach at 
the time some people try to put him on his back. The people 
interviewed explained that this shows that Colosio was finished 
off with a shot to the head and this has moved the PGR to 
redouble its efforts. It became known this morning that Attorney 
General Diego Valadez and his closest aides have traveled to 
Tijuana again. 
  Finally, with regard to the discovery of a video showing the 
moment Aburto places the gun near the candidate's head, 
consulted experts have mentioned the possibility of a 
photographic gimmick. These experts pointed to the darkness of 
the video and recalled that the attack took place shortly after 
1700, when it was still daylight. They affirmed that the picture 
is so nebulous that a photomontage gimmick is conceivable. 
  The same experts also pointed out the position of the 
killer's hand noting that "considering the way the revolver was 
raised and its height, it had to be noticed by security people, 
who in the face of such a situation would have killed the 
aggressor before he could have taken aim." As policemen, the 
experts said, we think this film could have been "fixed" in the 
evening. This fits reports received by EL UNIVERSAL the night of 
the attack. Those reports speak of members of the military 
staff reconstructing the events. The people of Lomas Taurinas 
asked reporters: "What is the use of doing that now?" 
  This newspaper has been informed of another noteworthy 
thing: 
Alleged federal agents reportedly from Sonora State, videotaped 
absolutely everything having to do with the PRI candidate. 
Sources close to the PGR have also reported that "on the night 
of the crime," Attorney General Diego Valadez "saw the video 
over and over." 
  Regarding what happened to the arrested man the day of the 
crime, EL UNIVERSAL has been informed that (after the people 
tried to lynch him) he was placed in a suburban van occupied by 
at least 10 other persons. The commander of Tijuana's Municipal 
Tactical Group tried to prevent them from taking Aburto away 
because the people were afraid Aburto would be killed. One of 
the people in the van, however, identified himself as member of 
the military staff and the van was allowed to drive away. People 
who were close to the van when the rifle-wielding commander of 
the tactical group stopped it, have reported that this police 
chief told the people in the van: "I will let you keep going, 
but I want this man alive when he gets to the Attorney General's 
Office."

<F P=106> [From the "Early Morning" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon will run for office on 
21 August against the other eight presidential candidates. Three 
of them have expressed their opinions on the nomination of 
Zedillo Ponce de Leon. 
  [Begin recording] [Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, candidate 
for 
the National Action Party] By reason of the public posts that 
Dr. Zedillo and I have held, I have been in direct contact with 
him. I consider him to be a respectable man and politician. 
Now that the PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] has 
appointed him to replace Luis Donaldo Colosio, may he rest in 
peace, I once again have an opponent. 
  [Rafael Aguilar Talamantes, candidate for the Cardenist 
Front 
for National Reconstruction Party] I imagine he must be good 
because he has a long history of public service. When I was in 
jail back in 1966, Zedillo was one of the students from the 
Polytechnic Institute who participated in a march called The 
Path for Freedom, that demanded my freedom. At that time, I was 
a member of the National Association of Democratic Students. 
Ernesto Zedillo has a good record. He is going to be a great 
opponent for us. [end recording] 
  For Jorge Gonzalez Torres, candidate of the Mexican Green 
Ecologist Party, the selection of Ernesto Zedillo as new PRI 
candidate represents renewed hopes for democracy in our country. 
When asked about the PRI nomination, Gonzalez Torres pointed out 
that the voters will decide on Ernesto Zedillo's nomination on 
21 August. He added that Luis Donaldo Colosio's death should not 
be used as sentimental blackmail, and votes should be cast in a 
reasonable and not emotional manner.

    [Editorial Report] Monterrey EL NORTE (Foreign Edition) in 
Spanish on 30 March publishes on pages 1A and 10A a 150-word 
report on the results of a public opinion poll of Ernesto 
Zedillo Ponce de Leon, the Institutional Revolutionary Party's 
(PRI) new presidential candidate. 
  The item, published under the headline "Zedillo Has A Good 
Image," is comprised of four pie charts that show the results of 
a survey conducted shortly after the PRI announced Zedillo as 
its new candidate. The survey questioned 407 people in 
Monterrey and the surrounding metropolitan area and 450 people 
in Mexico City. The item mentions three questions. 
  The first question was: "In general, what is your opinion of 
Ernesto Zedillo?" In Monterrey, 44 percent said they had a good 
opinion; 23 percent said they did not know anything about him; 
18 percent said their opinion was neutral; 13 percent said they 
had a very good opinion; and 2 percent they had a bad opinion. 
In Mexico City, 39 percent responded positively; 29 percent did 
not know anything about him; 22 percent were neutral; 5 percent 
had a bad opinion; 4 percent a very good opinion; and 1 percent 
a very bad opinion. 
  The second question was: "What do you think are the PRI's 
chances of winning the presidency of the republic with Ernesto 
Zedillo Ponce de Leon as its candidate? Good, little, or none." 
The report gives the general response to this question; it does 
not give separate percentages for each of the places polled. The 
results were: 64 percent said good; 27 percent said little; 6 
percent said they did not know; and 3 percent said none. 
  The third question was: "Would you vote for Ernesto Zedillo 
Ponce de Leon?" The item also gives a general response to this 
question. Results: 65 percent said yes; 19 percent said no; and 
15 percent said they did not know.

<F P=106> [Annual petroleum report read by General Director Francisco </F>
Rojas during an event marking the 56th anniversary of oil 
expropriation at the Mexican Petroleum headquarters in Mexico 
City; date not given; from the "At Midday" newscast -- recorded] 
  [Excerpt] Mr. President, a little more than five years ago 
you took office. Today, Mexico is a country that owns its future 
more. It follows specific paths, it is better organized, more 
sur of itself and its enormous potencial for advancement. You 
have undertaken your duties with patriotism and are fulfilling 
the responsibilities given to you by the people. 
  As in past years, in 1993, Mexican Petroleum [Pemex] worked 
following the main guidelines of your policy, the defense of 
oil. All actions taken follow these main guidelines. This 
explains the efforts made to make Pemex efficient and make it 
highly competitive. An in-depth administration reorganization 
was conducted. The four Pemex subsidiaries are working normally. 
Pemex reported a reduction in its debt by $68 million. In other 
words, the total plan for investment was carried out with our 
own resources. 
  For a third consecutive year, the production level for total 
liquid hydrocarbons surpassed the record reached in 1982. The 
total production for 1993 reached 3.131 million barrels per day, 
of which 1.794 million barrels were assigned for domestic 
consumption and 1.337 million barrels for exports. In the past 
three years, an increase in the reserves of hydrocarbons allowed 
restoring three-quarters of the production extracted during that 
period, thus reversing a long-standing trend. 
  The creation of Pemex-Gas and Basic Petrochemicals 
[Petroquimica Basica] was a prelude to the significance the use 
of clean fuels and basic raw material will have in processing 
petrochemicals in Mexico and worldwide. The production of 
natural gas reached 3.576 billion [figure as heard] cubic feet a 
day while that of liquefied gas reached 103,000 barrels a day. 
  Environmental protection, industrial safety, and energy 
savings have been placed at the forefront of Pemex's program. 
Several preventive and active programs have been encouraged in 
close cooperation with the Social Development Secretariat and 
the Metropolitan Commission for the Prevention and Control of 
Environmental Pollution to the Valley of Mexico. During the last 
fiscal period, more than 215 installation safety inspections 
were carried out by insurance companies and specialized 
corporations, as well as more than 1,000 environmental impact 
studies. Following strict budgetary constraints, Pemex has been 
able to improve its financial position, meet its production and 
marketing objectives, and implement internal restructuring. In 
addition, it has promoted a new institutional culture through 
the adoption of modern operational practices in a state owned 
enterprise. 
  At the end of this administration, Pemex will have 
transferred to the Treasury $106 billion over a six year period. 
Pemex's assets totals $50 billion and the value of proven 
reserves, valued at $13 per barrel is approximately equal to 
$850 billion. In addition, Mexican sovereignty over subterranean 
resources and revenues from crude oil exploration assures energy 
security as well as an instrument to realize structural changes 
in the Mexican economy. The question we should now ask is if we 
Mexicans are willing to transfer ownership, management, or use 
of this patrimony to private interests? PEMEX workers have 
expressed solidarity with the companies' institutional 
objectives, and cooperated in moving forward toward goals of 
modernization. 
  The workers union has been intransigent in defending its 
collective contract, but it has preferred the collective 
interest over outdated demands for economic concessions and 
political power. Now, one year after the law was promulgated, we 
can feel satisfaction to report that Pemex's new organization 
system has been implemented and is working; the four subsidiary 
companies are operating normally; and the benefits of the 
reforms are beginning to capitalize. 
  Noteworthy is the fact that efficiency has reduced operation 
costs by 39 percent during 1981-93, 29 percent for the current 
six-year period. Yearly savings for 1994 represent 60 percent of 
the investment plan. Not only has the oil community put an end 
to the waste of the past, but it has also organized the true 
defense of the nations's institutional interests for the future.

  [Excerpts] Buenos Aires, 29 Mar (NA) -- The government has 
ended the serious crisis in the Finance Ministry by decreeing 
"the dismissal" of National Securities Commission President 
Martin Redrado, who systematically refused to leave the post 
despite losing the political support he had in the government. 
  Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo appointed Investments Under 
Secretary Guillermo Haterneck to replace Redrado, thus making 
sure that one of his trusted men is at the head of an 
organization considered vital for the development of the capital 
market. 
  Redrado's resistance to leaving his post forced the 
government to evaluate two alternative decrees, one dismissing 
Redrado and another one accepting his resignation. 
  Carlos Corach, presidential technical and legal secretary, 
met with Redrado until late last night trying unsuccessfully to 
convince him to adopt the least traumatic solution. 
  But Redrado did not accept the suggestion to resign and the 
executive branch had to dismiss him, thus ending his ongoing 
confrontation with Cavallo. 
  About midnight, before leaving for India, President Carlos 
Menem signed the decree "firing" Redrado. 
  Alone and without much visible support in the government, 
Redrado, who is only 32, saw how his last hopes were 
disappearing on 28 March. [passage omitted] 
  The only support Redrado received was from the 
pensioners,because Norma Pla went to the National Securities 
Commission to applaud what was done in the process for selling 
YPF [Government Oil Deposits] shares in the pensioners' hands. 
  This is the issue that led to Redrado's critical situation 
when he rejected the first proposal presented by the U.S. firms 
Merril Lynch and First Boston. 
  Although the second proposal had the endorsement of the 
first 
government position, the strong support for the pensioners 
irritated the already sensitive feelings of Cavallo, who 
convinced Menem of the need to get Redrado to resign. 
  The old disagreements between the two officials were revived 
in the last few months due to their different points of view on 
the destinations of funds for the Pension Fund Managing 
Companies. 
  Minister Cavallo and Felipe Murolo, superintendent of the 
Pension Fund Managing Companies, wanted well-established 
guidelines for the system, but Redrado wanted to give the 
greatest freedom possible to the investors. 
  The abrupt drop in shares on 28 March convinced officials of 
the need to eradicate the uncertainty in the market.

<F P=106> [Article by Eugenio Andrea Bruno: "Where Is Radicalism?"] </F>
  [Text] The opposition has as many economic programs as 
potential candidates for economy minister that it can offer 
society. The economic advisers of Eduardo Angeloz, Raul 
Alfonsin, and Fernando de la Rua outline where they agree and 
disagree. 
  For some time now a heated political debate has been going 
on 
inside the Radical Civic Union (UCR). 
  There are three clearly defined political factions in the 
party: Raul Alfonsin's, Eduardo Angeloz's, and Fernando de la 
Rua's. 
  And just as there are three different political approaches, 
there are as many factions in economic policy as well. If we 
were to plot economic policy on a spectrum with interventionism 
on one end and the free market on the other, then all 
indications are that the economic advisers of Angeloz (Ricardo 
Lopez Murphy and Francisco Mezzadri) would be closest to the 
market, De la Rua's adviser (Adalberto Rodriguez Giavarini) 
would be in the middle, and Juan Vital Sourrouille of the 
Alfonsin faction would be farthest to the left and closest to 
interventionism. 
  Our main question is: Are the economic philosophies within 
the UCR compatible? 
  The advisers themselves answer the question in a way 
designed 
to temper the argument. Mezzadri contends that "there is a lot 
more agreement than disagreement among the professional 
economists who belong to the UCR. We may have our differences 
about the approach to policies, but on key issues such as the 
need for a stable, open Argentina, I do not see substantial 
differences. There may be different assessments among 
politicians, but not among economists." 
  In the same vein, Mezzadri says that if Sourrouille were 
minister, in his opinion he would adhere to the guidelines of 
the Cavallo plan and not return to the previous approach. "I do 
not think that he would reverse course," he exclaims. 
  Rodriguez Giavarini explains that "the economists you have 
mentioned (myself, Lopez Murphy, Mezzadri, and Sourrouille) may 
be associated with different factions, but we belong to the same 
party. We share many views, from a defense of stability, concern 
over the effectiveness of government spending, and the dangers 
of excessive vulnerability, to the need to boost the rate of 
savings and investment." 
<H5>  No Consensus </H5>
  Although the economists themselves contend that they agree 
on 
major issues, one has the feeling that the economic program of a 
hypothetical Radical government would differ depending on its 
economy minister. And the differences would involve substance, 
not just approach. Let us see. 
  It is obvious that Mezzadri and Rodriguez Giavarini do not 
think the same as Sourrouille. Whereas the former have praise 
for the Cavallo plan, Sourrouille criticizes it unceasingly. 
  For example, with regard to the labor reform, Mezzadri 
contends that if it were up to him, it would be more sweeping 
than even the administration's. "There has to be flexibility for 
managerial, technological, financial, and labor movements. In 
some cases such mobility takes place easily, but in others, 
mainly labor, it does not exist at all. It is impossible to 
sustain an economic plan such as that with labor relations like 
the ones we have today." 
  Sourrouille, in contrast, feels that although labor 
relations 
have to be made somewhat more flexible, the administration's 
approach is leaving the workers altogether defenseless. 
  As for the exchange rate, Mezzadri says that it is the 
responsibility of Argentine businessmen to seek out new markets 
and to adopt an export-oriented stance. "The exchange rate has 
hurt some of them, but it has not impeded the growth of 
industrial exports...I do not see the exchange rate as a 
decisive obstacle. I do not think that those who say they cannot 
do anymore are working at peak economic efficiency." Yet, 
Angeloz's adviser thinks that more flexibility is indeed needed 
in internal factors in order to cut costs and improve 
competitiveness. 
  In contrast, we need only glance at Sourrouille's remarks to 
realize that he blames the economic plan, and more specifically 
the exchange rate, for the mounting trade deficit. 
<H5>  What Lies in Store </H5>
  The future of the plan is another issue that divides them. 
Mezzadri's thinking in this regard is clear-cut. He calls on the 
administration to step up its program and under no circumstances 
to stray from the current economic discipline. Rodriguez 
Giavarini is even more categorical: "The outlook would darken if 
the administration decided to become passive, as if nothing were 
happening in the world or, worse yet, to try and keep fueling 
domestic demand as a short-term fiscal tool, like more 
government spending, to channel the proceeds from the pending 
privatizations into consumption, or else to close off the 
economy." 
  "The economic plan is unsustainable," said Sourrouille at a 
regional economic meeting of the UCR. The remark conceals an 
entire philosophy. In turn, we can hear this philosophy every 
day in Alfonsin's statements and, even more so, in the recent 
comments by Simon Lazzara ("A little bit of inflation would be 
acceptable if it boosted demand"). 
  In short, a major faction of UCR politicians and economists 
feels that a marked change is needed in the rules of the game. 
  What we are looking at, when all is said and done, is a 
full-fledged debate within the UCR marked by an unmistakable 
clash of ideas. This is not bad, per se, for a political party. 
What is harmful is to try and conceal these differences for the 
sake of appearing united before society. 
<H5>  Mezzadri: "Social Investment Lacking" </H5>
  Back when Angeloz still had hopes of becoming president, in 
1989, two men had a chance to become his economy minister. One 
was Lopez Murphy, and the other was Francisco Mezzadri, who in 
reply to a question from LA PRENSA emphasized that "there are 
fewer differences among UCR economists than there seem to be." 

  -  "The best thing about the administration's plan is that it 
incorporated the idea of economic discipline." 
  -  "You asked me 
whether I am going to be Angeloz's economy minister in 1995. 
Angeloz has a saying to answer that question: there are things 
that only he and his pillow know." 
  -  "My labor reform would be 
much more thorough-going than the government's." 
  -  "The State 
should not take action in the economic area, although it should 
do so efficiently in health care, education, defense, and 
security. In these fields the government should make social 
spending more efficient by setting goals and achieving 
them." 
  -  "The administration is wasting its time on second-rate 
political matters, such as the reform of the constitution, when 
it ought to be devoting that time to completing pending tasks 
such as the labor reform and the provincial reforms." 
  -  "The 
provinces ought to implement reform plans like the 
administration's plan. Only in this way will there be 
homogeneity in Argentina's economy." 
  -  "A second reform of the 
State is currently lacking. The first, which had to do with 
bringing the idea of economic efficiency into Argentina, has 
already been successfully completed. Now, in order for these 
efforts to bear fruit, the government needs to address social 
investment more efficiently." 

<H5>    Sourrouille: "The Plan Is Unsustainable" </H5>
  The former economy minister in the last UCR government 
resumed his criticism of Minister Cavallo's economic plan in his 
remarks to the UCR regional economic meeting. 

  -  "There are two reports on Argentina. The first is that 
inflation is low, there is stability, interest rates are low, 
and foreign funds are coming into the country, albeit for 
speculative purposes. But the other has to note that there are 
tragic pockets of poverty and that unemployment remained at 10 
percent of the population last year." 
  -  "Most of the country is 
suffering crises that seem definitive for the sake of achieving 
macroeconomic success." 
  -  "The administration's plan is good for 
only one segment of the population, while the majority of people 
are enduring a situation of neglect in which they cannot find 
any space." 
  -  "Social strains that could explode in the medium 
term are being fomented." 
  -  "The two problems facing the Cavallo 
plan, which are impossible to resolve under this model, have to 
do with the trade deficit and unemployment. And I see no 
possibility of solving them under this arrangement." 

<H5>    Rodriguez Giavarini: "The Accomplishments Are Unquestionable" </H5>
  Adalberto Rodriguez Giavarini is an economic consultant and 
Fernando de la Rua's main economic adviser. "The administration 
must remain on this course and under no circumstances close off 
the economy," he said in an interview with LA PRENSA. 

  -  "The economic plan has made three major gains possible. 
Price stability is foremost. The other two are in fiscal policy 
and economic activity. The consumer price index over the past 
six months is equivalent to an annualized rate of 3.1 percent, 
which is similar to the rate in the United States over the past 
12 months." 
  -  "There has been major growth in economic activity, 
although we can criticize the exaggerated consumption slant that 
the expansion has shown." 
  -  "As far as fiscal policy is concerned, 
the effort to balance the budget and eliminate distorting taxes 
is praiseworthy." 
  -  "The growth in government spending of dubious 
effectiveness concerns me." 
  -  "Some aspects of the technical 
design of the plan are debatable. I would have preferred more 
incentives for domestic savings rather than spending on public 
and private consumption." 
  -  "I am not pleased about the 
administration's tendency to proceed on a case-by-case basis, 
with a large degree of discretionary authority and straying from 
the sound principles of universality and transparency." 
  -  "The 
administration should step up its fiscal austerity to try to 
offset the upward pressure that higher international interest 
rates put on domestic interest rates, by bringing down the 
country-risk premium." 
  -  "The strategy of fiscal austerity should 
be complemented by progress on pending matters, particularly the 
labor and provincial reforms and incentives for domestic 
savings." 
  -  "Inflation must be seen as an extremely regressive 
tax. If the government merely signals that it would be willing 
to tolerate a little inflation in exchange for growth, I think 
that the economic agents would react by penalizing it heavily, 
and this would lead to capital flight and a contraction in 
credit and production. As you will see, then, I do not agree at 
all with Lazzara's statements."

<F P=106> [Article by Maria Ines Espeche and Ana Gerschenson: "The </F>
Capital Is Jeopardizing the Pact"] 
  [Text] "The direct election of the mayor and the reform of 
Buenos Aires City: 
  "a) The people of the city of Buenos Aires will directly 
elect their chief of government. 
  "b) The city of Buenos Aires will be granted a special 
constitutional status that will recognize its autonomy and its 
own legislative and jurisdictional powers." 
  (From the Basic Points of Agreement of the pact signed in 
Olivos by President Carlos Menem and Raul Alfonsin) 
  The measures contained in the Olivos pact have already begun 
to unravel. The bone of contention is none other than the 
autonomy of the Federal Capital and its new legal status. 
Apparently, government officials are trying to "block" the legal 
and economic independence of the city and leave alone only the 
direct election of the mayor at the Constituent Assembly in 
Santa Fe. President Menem himself urged the squabbling factions 
in the Buenos Aires Justicialist Party (PJ) to end their 
fighting and put off decisions on the future plan. 
  The "provincialization" of the Federal Capital would 
inevitably bring with it the creation of new local institutions, 
the drafting of a metropolitan constitution, the formation of a 
local police force (the neighborhood precincts would come under 
the jurisdictions of the city), and a new local judiciary, plus 
the possible replacement of the Deliberating Council by a Buenos 
Aires legislature. 
  But what is especially upsetting to more than one sector of 
the national government, particularly the Economy Ministry, is 
that it will not be able to refuse to turn over the lion's share 
of its funds to a new "city state" with full autonomy. 
  No Buenos Aires politician doubts that this is "the debate 
that will come on the heels of the Constituent Assembly." 
  The leaders of the metropolitan PJ who are part of the 
president's inner circle would be willing to tolerate the 
emergence of a "chief of government" elected by popular vote. 
"What they cannot stomach," claim some former Grossists, "is 
that on top of that, the new mayor would have control of the 
huge budget of the new province." 
  Even Carlos Corach, the number-one candidate to represent 
the 
capital at the Constituent Assembly, told LA PRENSA that he does 
not agree with the formation of a metropolitan judiciary or a 
local police force. "That would result in more useless 
bureaucracy," he declared, expressly contradicting the paragraph 
of the Olivos pact that states: "...the city of Buenos Aires 
will be given a constitutional status that will recognize its 
autonomy and its own legislative and jurisdictional powers." 
  "Here it is evading an internal debate within the PJ," says 
Simon Lazara, spokesman for Raul Alfonsin, when asked about the 
possibility that the Radicals' agreement with Menem may fall 
apart. While it is an open secret that within the Buenos Aires 
PJ there is "an internal power struggle between Corach and 
Ruckauf to control the capital," when it comes to the issue of 
the city's autonomy, the minister agrees with the legal and 
technical secretary that "it is not necessary" for the city to 
have its own police and court system. 
  "What they are forgetting," whispers a former Justicialist 
deputy, "is that they will not be ministers or government 
officials for the rest of their lives; they will not last 100 
years." 
  On the other hand, Alfonsinist Jesus Rodriguez, a deputy who 
favors the pact, promised that at the Constituent Assembly "we 
will defend our neighbors, because I do not trust the Menemists 
when they talk about autonomy." 
  This issue, about which the Justicialists have clearly not 
reached a consensus (although they do not admit that in public), 
will be the subject of a meeting next week between the PJ 
deputies and Constituent Assembly candidates, both those in the 
capital and those in Buenos Aires Province. There they will try 
to forge a united position so that there will be no more 
contradictions, at least not in public. 
<H5>  "The Name Is Mine" </H5>
  It should be noted that Governor Eduardo Duhalde recently 
brought up the "identity crisis" that Buenos Aires residents 
would suffer if the city were to keep its current name. It was 
then that he proposed the name "Santa Maria" for its third 
incarnation, after it has achieved full autonomy. 
  "All the patrol cars that used to say `Buenos Aires 
Provincial Police' now say `Buenos Aires Police,' to get people 
used to the idea of Buenos Aires in the district," the 
distressed governor explained to Buenos Aires PJ Deputy Jorge 
Arguello, author of the first autonomy plan for the capital. 
  Despite the "psychological crisis" the residents of the 
metropolitan area may suffer, on this side of General Paz no 
one, Justicialist or Radical, is willing to give up the label 
"Buenos Aires City," which will inevitably set the stage for 
confrontations here and there in the future. 
  Some suspicious types speculate that what really bothers 
Duhalde is "the emergence of a man who will be as strong as he 
is as governor of what until now has been the country's most 
important province." 
  The chief of government, a title agreed upon by the Radical 
Civic Union (UCR) and the PJ, will be politically and 
economically powerful enough to negotiate on an equal footing on 
issues such as the exodus of "the 6 million people who come into 
the capital each day to be treated at Buenos Aires hospitals." 
  To top it all off, Deputy Enrique Benedetti, a De la Rua 
political operative, did not hesitate to give LA PRENSA this 
diagnosis: "This is another `leak' in the pact. First there is 
Levene, who does not want to give up the [Supreme] Court; now we 
have the autonomy issue. The next thing you know, they will say 
that Menem's reelection will not be for one term, but will be 
good for the rest of his biological existence." 
<H5>  [Box, p 5] </H5>
<H5>  Everyone Wants To Be "Chief of Government" </H5>
  Being elected top leader of the Federal Capital by popular 
vote is the pinnacle of politics for more than one Buenos Aires 
official, regardless of party affiliation. The matter has 
sparked more than one internal feud. 
  The list includes those who secretly yearn for the office, 
as 
well as those who have already announced it loud and clear. 
  Among metropolitan Justicialists, former Grossists and 
Menemists are fighting over the right to be the elected 
"figure"; everyone from recent PJ acquisition Adelina Dalesio de 
Viola to Comprehensive Medical Assistance Plan (PAMI) Director 
Matilde Menendez, and including Legal and Technical Secretary 
Carlos Corach, Public Function Secretary Claudia Bello, and 
Interior Minister Carlos Ruckauf, wants to take Bouer's place in 
1995. 
  After the recent elections in the capital and the dimming of 
his presidential prospects, Radical insiders say that Senator 
Fernando de la Rua has expressed a desire to wear the mayor's 
sash. But the man who opposed the pact will not have a smooth 
road ahead of him. Alfonsinist Deputy Jesus Rodriguez has 
already secretly begun pulling his political strings to enter 
the race for the same job. 
  The appearance on the scene of Socialist Councilman Norberto 
Laporta, who swept the metropolitan elections last 3 October, 
has dashed more than one private hope. "El Chichon" [the jolly 
one] has reportedly taken the idea so seriously that many say 
this was the real reason why he declined to enter into an 
alliance with the Great Front. "With the race for the city 
leadership so close at hand, he could not risk having his image 
tarnished," Socialists assert with conviction. 
  There is also optimism in the front. The person who emerges 
as the "best of the candidates" is former Prosecutor and 
Councilman Anibal Ibarra. The opinion polls indicate he is a man 
to be reckoned with, especially since he was so instrumental in 
exposing irregularities in the PAMI. 
  Another person rumored to be vying for a position on the 
list 
of possible candidates is retired Brigadier General Osvaldo 
Cacciatore, who made no secret during his unsuccessful campaign 
for deputy as a member of the metropolitan Democratic Center 
Union (UCeDe) that he would like once again to hold the office 
that was once his. 
<H5>  [Box, p 5] </H5>
<H5>  Third Incarnation </H5>
  A series of legal steps must be taken before the city can be 
declared "autonomous." 

  -  It must be approved by the National Constituent 
Convention. 
  -  After that the second stage will begin, the local 
constituent process, when limits will be set and terms will be 
defined. 
  -  If Article 3, Paragraph 27 of Article 67, and Paragraph 
3 of Article 86 of the National Constitution are amended at the 
convention, the way will be clear to advance toward 
autonomy. 
  -  Until autonomy is declared and the new institutions of 
Buenos Aires City are installed, Congress will continue to be 
the local legislature. 
  -  After the Constitution is amended, 
Congress will pass a law calling an election for delegates to a 
Buenos Aires Constituent Assembly. 
  -  Each party will have to draw 
up a city model to present to the people, set in motion an 
electoral process, elect delegates to the Constituent Assembly, 
draft the constitution of the autonomous city, and once it is 
approved, set in motion the institutional process. 
  -  The 
Deliberative Council will be replaced by a legislature of the 
new city. 
  -  It will have a special constitutional status. 
  -  It will 
continue to be the nation's capital until Congress passes a law 
transferring that status; it may or may not declare the capital 
to be federal. 
  -  Although there is a general consensus on 
autonomy, the debate will begin with what city model each party 
will offer. Moreover, it will have a direct impact on the 
quality of life of the citizens. This is a foundational stage, 
the most important one since the city was federalized in 
1880.

  [Excerpt] (NA-DYN) Gustavo Bossert and Guillermo Lopez were 
sworn in yesterday as new Supreme Court justices during a brief 
ceremony, thus restoring court strength to nine. 
  Bossert and Lopez were sworn in yesterday by interim chief 
justice Julio Nazareno during a seven-minute ceremony carried 
out at noon in Central Courthouse. 
  The ceremony was not attended by Justice Minister Jorge 
Maiorano, who allegedly has serious internal differences with a 
number of justices. 
  Despite the fact that it was officially reported that the 
minister did not attend the ceremony "due to previous 
engagements," court sources said that Justices Enrique Petracchi 
and Augusto Delluscio had allegedly announced that they would 
not go if they saw Maiorano there. 
  Maiorano later confirmed that he had not turned up the 
Central Courthouse to see Bossert and Lopez become new justices 
because he had been warned about Belluscio and Petracchi's 
decision. The new justices replace Rodolfo Barra and Mariano 
Cavagna Martinez, who are both to the Constituent Assembly.

<F P=106> [Report by Renata Verissimo from Brasilia] </F>
  [Text] Future Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero will be 
sworn in on 5 April. He said today he will not touch the 
government economic plan. 
  Ricupero will spend the next four days in Brasilia, talking 
with the economic team to learn about issues at his new 
ministry. He admitted he is not well acquainted with all issues 
and that it would be premature to comment on any decision he 
might make. Ricupero confirmed that he intends to maintain the 
entire current economic team but he also is bringing along five 
advisers to help him in his new post. He also promised he will 
not modify the government economic plan. He said he totally 
favors the economic plan, and that he believes in the FHC 
[Fernando Henrique Cardoso] plan's success. Ricupero also chose 
the fight against inflation as his No. 1 goal: 
  [Begin Ricupero recording] I consider inflation the first 
problem that must be solved because without stability, there is 
no solution. Without stability, no commerce, or regional system, 
or industrial policy, or anything else will work. Therefore, 
that is the main subject of my convictions. As for the details 
and how inflation will be curbed, evidently it depends on the 
daily analysis of the economy's performance. [end recording] 
  Minister Ricupero added that President Itamar Franco is 
analyzing some names to replace him in the Environment Ministry. 
According to Ricupero, some of the possible candidates are 
former Ibama [Brazilian Institute for the Environment and 
Renewable Natural Resources] President Fernando Cesar Mesquita 
and Amazon Secretary Henrique Brandao Cavalcanti.

  [Text] Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso is 
leaving his post to run for president. His last act as finance 
minister was to present the bills for the new Brazilian 
currency, the real, which will take effect in the economic 
plan's third stage. 
  Minister Cardoso today presented to the public the one-, 
five-, 10-, 50-, and 100-real bills as well as the one-, five-, 
10-, and 50-real cent coins. The Central Bank is coordinating 
the printing of 1 billion bills, some of which are being printed 
abroad. 
  During the presentation Minister Cardoso said the new 
currency needs credibility, and for this purpose the government 
must be austere. It would have been easier, he said, to have 
begun the economic plan with the creation of the real, but the 
government chose the most difficult path, which was to create 
the appropriate conditions by streamlining public accounts. 
Minister Cardoso said he left the economic plan ready and that 
he is sure it will work: 
  [Begin Cardoso recording] I am totally sure that the plan is 
perfectly established and coordinated and that it will work. It 
will not be affected in the least. Brazil has now found its 
path, which it must follow. That is also the conviction of the 
president. Therefore, I am leaving this ministry with absolute 
calm. [end recording] 
  Minister Cardoso reported that the people must not worry 
because the government will announce the measure at least 35 
days before the new currency goes into circulation. 
  During a news conference, Minister Cardoso assessed what has 
done so far with the stabilization plan. He expressed thanks for 
the economic team's dedication, Congress' cooperation, and 
President Itamar Franco's support. He said the president always 
encouraged the plan and has been the main pillar of the economic 
policy. 
  Minister Cardoso said it has not been decided yet who will 
be 
his vice presidential running mate. He said his party, the PSDB 
[Brazilian Social Democracy Party], is open to conversations 
with all parties but nothing has been agreed on alliances so far.

<F P=106> [Report by Luiz Augusto Mendonca] </F>
  [Text] President Itamar Franco has rewritten the text of 
the provisional measure that creates the Real Value Unit, URV. 
The new text will be published in the official gazette today. 
  The new text of Provisional Measure 434 establishes that the 
date for conversion of salaries into URV's is the 30th of each 
month. The difference resulting from the judicial and 
legislative branches decision to convert their employees' 
salaries into URV's on 20 March will be paid to them as a bonus, 
which will have to be authorized through a legislative decree. 
  These decisions were made during a cabinet meeting at 
Planalto Palace last night. The joint proposal for rewriting 
Provisional Measure 434 was approved during the meeting. The 
text now establishes that all public employees' salaries be 
converted into URV's on the 30th of each month based on the 
salaries paid for the last four months. This rule does not 
apply to state-owned companies and other self-supported 
government organizations. 
  The 10.94 percent difference resulting from conversion into 
URV's of judicial and legislative branch employees' salaries on 
20 March will probably be paid to these employees as a bonus, 
which will be authorized through a legislative decree. 
  President Itamar Franco began the meeting yesterday by 
saying 
that as head of the administration and chief of state he must 
protect the national interests and influence administrative 
measures of the other government branches. President Itamar 
Franco later said that, as should always occur in a state of 
law, he will comply with the Federal Supreme Court decision and 
continue to adopt and propose measures against unfair and 
unequal treatment of public issues. He added that he will 
coordinate proposals for amendments to the Constitution through 
the government leaders at the Chamber of Deputies and at the 
Senate. He established that these proposals be analyzed with 
the help of illustrious jurists. He said that these will be 
effective measures seeking to ensure an overall and legal 
reorganization of the Brazilian Government.

  [Text] Rural workers, fishermen, and Indian tribes 
countrywide will promote a movement against hunger, misery, and 
for jobs. They will take their proposals to the government in 
April. 
  The movement will be entitled "Cry of the Earth." The 
movement is being organized by the National Rural Workers 
Confederation [Confederacao Nacional dos Trabalhadores na 
Agricultura], the CUT [Sole Workers Center], and the Landless 
Farmers Movement, as well as other entities that plan to join 
the action in favor of citizens and struggle for jobs movement. 
  This new movement has five main objectives: agrarian reform, 
labor rights, social security and health, and policies for the 
environment and energy fields. Those who are promoting this 
movement plan to begin negotiating these objectives with the 
government next month. 
  Landless farmers representative Gilberto Fortes has asserted 
that more than 16,000 families must be settled in the rural 
area. He said this problem could be solved by expropriating land 
where marijuana plantations are found, as the Constitution 
establishes. Representatives of this movement also want to fight 
to ensure the expansion of the program to feed workers and the 
rural workers' right to severance payments.

  [Text] Exploration and exploitation of oil, natural gas, 
and telecommunications services will be able to be done by 
private enterprises. Such changes are planned in the seven 
congressional committee proposals announced today by 
constitutional revision rapporteur Deputy Nelson Jobim. 
  According to these proposals, the right to exploit oil, 
natural gas, and telecommunications ceases to be the privilege 
of public companies. 
  [Begin Jobim recording] Look, we want to ensure a state 
monopoly, that is, the possibility that the government can 
exploit things either directly or through concessions. We are 
not forcing public companies to give concessions (?even if the 
pertaining) company is monopolistic. That is a government 
decision. [end recording] 
  Flexibility in monopolies also will be adopted for the 
distribution of piped gas. The rules for concessions will be 
defined by a complementary law. 
  Jobim also suggested a limitation on government intervention 
in the economy by eliminating the requirement of government 
authorization to exercise any economic activity. His proposal 
also ends differences between national and foreign companies. In 
the field of public finances and budget, Jobim suggests changes 
to balance the fiscal accounts, and he is open to suggestions 
from the Budget CPI [Congressional Investigative Committee]. 
  The main changes he suggested are to withdraw the concept of 
a congressional committee from the Constitution, and to end 
social subsidies and voluntary transfers of funds to states and 
municipalities, which should be authorized only through a 
specific law.

  [Text] The new strategy for defending the South American 
continent is the main topic that the U.S. Southern Command 
chief, General Barry B. McCaffrey, is analyzing with Brazilian 
military commanders. Drug trafficking control through an 
efficient fight in the Amazon region is part of the U.S. 
military strategy in Latin America. McCaffrey met on 16 March 
with Army Minister Zenildo de Lucena and the Army land 
operations commander, to whom he explained the objectives of the 
radar facilities and bases built on the borders of Amazon 
countries. 
  In the opinion of the U.S. military chief, the United 
States, 
as a top military power in the Americas, is also a member of the 
continent's defense pact along with the countries of the 
hemisphere, an Army Planning Department official said on 16 
March. McCaffrey today will meet the Armed Forces chief of 
staff. On 18 March, he will visit the Naval Operations Command 
in Rio de Janeiro. 
  A Vietnam war veteran, McCaffrey has taken advanced military 
strategy courses. He graduated from West Point Military Academy. 
In his capacity as Southern Command chief, McCaffrey is 
responsible for all U.S. military activities in Latin America, 
with the exception of Mexico and the Caribbean. Implementation 
of the national security policy in the hemisphere is part of the 
planning activities under his command, as a U.S. combat unit. 
  Meanwhile, in Buenos Aries, specialists and soldiers from 
OAS 
countries today continued debating enforcement of a new regional 
post-Cold War security model. 
<H5>  Integration </H5>
  The deliberations, which began on 14 March, today focused on 
the integration processes of Colombia and its neighbors, 
Argentina and Chile; Mercosur [Common Market of the South]; and 
the United States and Europe. The meeting was arranged in 
November in Washington by the OAS Special Hemispheric Security 
Commission, which is headed by Argentine Hernan Patino Mayer. At 
the 23d OAS General Assembly, which was held in Managua, a 
special resolution was approved to summon specialists and 
soldiers of the Americas to analyze the situation in the region 
within "the new international post-Cold War framework." 
  The Meeting of Specialists on Measures for Strengthening 
Regional Mutual Confidence and Security Mechanisms is being 
attended by deputy ministers, deputy foreign ministers, and 
military officers from OAS countries. Brazilian Joao Baena 
Soares, the OAS secretary general, is expected to arrive in 
Buenos Aires this evening to join the meeting, which ends on 18 
March.

  [Text] Quito, 29 Mar (NOTIMEX) -- Ecuadoran President Sixto 
Duran-Ballen denied today that the United States had pressured 
Ecuador to give its support -- at the last minute -- to Colombia 
to gain the OAS secretary general post. Duran-Ballen said at a 
news conference at Mariscal Sucre Air Base in Quito that it was 
decided at the last minute to support President Cesar Gaviria, 
given the Ecuadoran people's clamor. 
  The president arrived last night in Guayaquil, Ecuador, from 
Washington, concluding a 16-day tour during which he also 
visited Tokyo and Beijing. It was not until today that he flew 
to Quito. 
  He discussed the issue broadly in an attempt to convince the 
public of the reasons that motivated his sudden change of mind 
to vote for Colombia -- despite the previous commitment made to 
support Costa Rica. Duran-Ballen stressed -- visibly annoyed -- 
that he had not been pressured by the United States to "change" 
the vote committed to Bernd Niehaus, the Costa Rican foreign 
minister. He denied local media reports that he had changed his 
vote after meeting, during his stay in Washington, with 
Alexander Watson, U.S. assistant secretary of state for 
inter-American affairs. 
  The president defended the decision as serious Ecuadoran 
foreign policy and assured that in the OAS elections he made a 
decision based on "his own criteria and without any external 
influence." He explained that Foreign Minister Diego Paredes, 
who according to the opposition should resign for being 
incompetent, has his trust and will remain in his post, as he is 
doing a "magnificent job." Duran-Ballen added that in light of 
Cesar Gaviria's candidacy and the prestige he had gained leading 
his government "we ended up changing Ecuador's position." 
  The local media and the opposition censured the president 
and 
Foreign Minister Diego Paredes for annulling four times its 
support to Costa Rica before deciding to vote for Colombia, due 
to alleged U.S. pressure. 
  Duran-Ballen, 72, arrived last night in Ecuador ending a 
16-day absence. He was on a working tour to Japan, China, and 
on a private visit to the United States where he underwent a 
routine medical checkup. 
  The plane that transported Duran-Ballen and his delegation 
from the United States was not able to land last night in Quito 
due to bad weather and was forced to divert to Guayaquil. The 
president spent the night in Guayaquil and this morning returned 
to the Ecuadoran capital.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 30 Mar (ACAN-EFE) -- June Diane 
Werwitok, a U.S. tourist who has been accused of stealing 
children by a group of neighbors in the northern town of San 
Cristobal Verapaz, had her "skull and her right arm broken by a 
mob of peasants" who tried to lynch her. 
  A police source told ACAN-EFE today that the 54-year-old 
tourist was in that Alta Verapaz Department town when 20 
peasants started chasing her because allegedly she had stolen a 
child. Diane, who is from Florida State, was able to find 
refuge in the town's court building, which was later partially 
destroyed when the enraged peasants attacked it with rocks, 
sticks, and other objects and set court files on fire. 
  The incident took place Tuesday. The Army was sent to the 
town and gained control of the situation, according to volunteer 
firefighters. The source noted that the U.S. woman suffered a 
broken skull, her right arm was also broken, and was hit and 
stabbed in several parts of her body. After receiving first aid 
in San Cristobal Verapaz, the woman was admitted to a Guatemala 
City hospital because of the seriousness of the wounds. Diane 
was looking for a place to stay in the town when she was 
attacked by the peasants, the source reported. 
  This attack comes 22 days after another U.S. woman, Melisa 
Carol Larsen, 37, was almost lynched by Santa Lucia 
Cotzumalguapa peasants who accused her of forming part of a band 
dedicated to the abduction and trafficking of children. Carol 
Larsen was protected by the police and this brought about 
serious street demonstrations that resulted in 32 wounded 
persons, 52 arrests, and a small police station burned. This 
woman was set free a few days later when a court was unable to 
establish that she had been involved in the abduction of 
children. 
  The Attorney General's Office revealed today that so far in 
1994 it has received 66 files on child-stealing cases. A police 
source has informed ACAN-EFE about the arrest of three 
Guatemalan women accused of abducting as many children in this 
capital.

<F P=106> ["General Agreement on Human Rights" -- PRENSA LIBRE </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Preamble 
  Taking into account existing constitutional provisions, 
treaties, conventions, and other international instruments on 
human rights to which Guatemala subscribes; 
  Taking into account the will of the Guatemalan Government 
and 
the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity [URNG] to ensure 
that the agreement on human rights and international 
verification is implemented in keeping with said constitutional 
provisions and international treaties; 
  Taking into account the Guatemalan Government's commitment 
to 
respect and promote human rights, in keeping with the 
constitutional mandate; 
  Taking into account the URNG assumed the commitment to 
respect the inherent attributes of human beings and to ensure 
that they actually enjoy their human rights; 
  The government of the Republic of Guatemala and the URNG, 
which will be subsequently referred to as "the parties," agree 
to: 
  1. General agreement on human rights 
  1.1 The Government of the Republic of Guatemala reaffirms 
its adherence to principles and rules seeking to guarantee and 
protect full observance of human rights and its political will 
to ensure they are respected. 
  1.2 The Government of the Republic of Guatemala will 
continue to promote all measures designed to promote and improve 
rules and mechanisms designed to protect human rights. 
  2. Strengthening institutions charged with protecting 
human rights 
  2.1 The parties believe that any behavior that limits, 
restricts, or jeopardizes duties pertaining to human rights 
assigned to the judicial branch, Ombudsman for Human Rights, and 
the Public Prosecutor's Office undermines basic principles of a 
law-abiding state. Thus, the efforts of such institutions to 
fulfill such duties must be supported and strengthened. 
  2.2 As for the judicial branch and the Public 
Prosecutor's Office, the Government of the Republic of Guatemala 
reaffirms its willingness to respect their autonomy and to 
protect the freedom of action for both of them against pressure 
of any sort or origin to ensure that they fully enjoy the 
guarantees and instruments that they need to operate efficiently. 
  2.3 As for the Ombudsman for Human Rights, the Government 
of the Republic of Guatemala will continue to support his work, 
strengthening his position by supporting his actions and 
promoting reforms that might be needed to ensure that he will be 
able to better fulfill his duties and responsibilities. The 
Government of the Republic of Guatemala will support initiatives 
aimed at improving the technical and material conditions that 
the Ombudsman for Human Rights might have at his disposal to 
fulfill his tasks of investigating, overseeing, and following up 
on the full observance of human rights in Guatemala. 
  3. Commitment against impunity 
  3.1 The parties agree that firm action must be adopted 
against impunity. The government will not promote the adoption 
of legislative measures or of any sort to prevent the trial and 
punishment of those found responsible for human rights 
violations. 
  3.2 The Government of the Republic of Guatemala will 
promote, via the legislative branch, necessary legal 
modifications to the penal code to classify and punish, 
especially with regard to serious crimes, forceful or 
involuntary disappearances and summary or extrajudicial 
executions. The government will also promote, via the 
international community, the recognition of crimes against 
humanity, forced and involuntary disappearances, and summary or 
extrajudicial executions. 
  No special laws [fuero] or exclusive jurisdiction 
[jurisdiccion privativa] may be used to provide impunity for 
human rights violations. 
  4. Commitment to eliminate illegal security groups 
and clandestine organizations and regulate the bearing of 
arms 
  4.1 In order to maintain absolute respect for human 
rights, illegal groups or clandestine organizations should be 
dissolved. The Government of the Republic acknowledges its 
responsibility in fighting any such groups. 
  4.2 The Government of the Republic of Guatemala 
reiterates its commitment to continue purging and 
professionalizing security organizations. It also acknowledges 
the need to continue drafting and adopting effective measures to 
accurately regulate the ownership, bearing, and use of firearms 
by individuals in accordance with the law. 
  5. Guarantees of freedom of association and 
movement 
  5.1 Both parties agree that the right to free 
association, movement, and locomotion are human rights 
recognized internationally and constitutionally which must be 
exercised in accordance with the law and given full validity in 
Guatemala. 
  5.2 The Ombudsman for Human Rights, in the exercise of 
his duties, will be in charge of verifying if members of the 
Volunteer Committees for Civil Defense have been forced to join 
these groups against their will and if they have committed human 
rights violations. 
  5.3 The Ombudsman for Human Rights will immediately 
conduct the necessary investigation of complaints submitted to 
him. In order to do this, after informing the public that 
membership in such committees be voluntary and respectful of the 
law and human rights, consultations will be held with the 
population to ensure that the will of committee members is 
expressed freely and without any pressures. 
  5.4 If transgressions against the volunteer nature of 
these organizations or the legal order are confirmed, the 
Ombudsman for Human Rights will adopt those decisions he deems 
appropriate and will promote the pertinent legal or 
administrative actions to punish human rights violations. 
  5.5 The Government of the Republic unilaterally declares 
that it will not support the organization nor will it arm new 
Volunteer Committees for Civil Defense nationwide so long as 
there are no circumstances to motivate these actions. The URNG 
considers the government's statement as a positive expression of 
its will to achieve peace and facilitate the objectives of the 
statement. 
  5.6 Those affected will approach the municipal mayor, who 
will convene a public meeting and call on the Ombudsman for 
Human Rights to verify, through all available means, the 
volunteer nature as well as the decision of the residents. 
  5.7 Both parties agree that other aspects of the 
Volunteer Committees for Civil Defense will be dealt with later, 
once other points of the general agenda are discussed. 
  5.8 The parties recognize the educational and informative 
work carried out by the Human Rights Ombudsman's Office and 
request that it include information on the content and 
significance of the current agreement. 
  6. Military conscription 
  6.1 Conscription for obligatory military service must not 
be forced or become an occasion for violation of human rights. 
Therefore, in keeping with its nature as a civic duty and right, 
it must be just and nondiscriminatory. 
  6.2 Toward this end, the Guatemalan Government will 
continue making the necessary administrative decisions and will 
promote, as soon as possible and in the spirit of this 
agreement, a new law on military service. 
  7. Guarantees and protection of people and groups 
working to protect human rights 
  7.1 The parties agree that all actions that might 
threaten the security of those people or groups that work to 
promote and protect human rights must be condemned. 
  7.2 To this end, the Government of the Republic of 
Guatemala will take special measures to protect the people or 
organizations that work on human rights. Furthermore, it will 
opportunely and exhaustively investigate charges surrounding 
actions or threats that could negatively affect them. 
  7.3 The Government of the Republic of Guatemala 
reiterates its commitment to guarantee and effectively protect 
the work to defend human rights carried out by individuals and 
organizations. 
  8 Compensation and/or assistance to victims of 
human rights violations 
  8.1 The parties admit it is their humane duty to 
compensate and/or assist victims of human rights violations. 
This compensation and/or assistance will be embodied in 
government measures and civic and socioeconomic programs. Such 
actions will be accorded priority status and will be addressed 
to those who social and economic conditions are the most needy. 
  9 Human rights and the internal armed 
confrontation 
  9.1 Until the agreement for a firm and lasting peace is 
signed, both parties will acknowledge the need to end the 
suffering of the civilian population and to respect the human 
rights of the injured, captured, and those who are not part of 
the fighting. 
  9.2 These statements by the parties do not constitute a 
special agreement in regard to Article 8 (common), Point 2, 
Paragraph 2, of the 1949 Geneva Convention. 
  International verification by the United Nations 
  1. The parties reaffirm their decision, included in the 
10 January 1994 Framework Agreement, to have all agreements be 
accompanied by appropriate national and international 
verification mechanisms. Also, the United Nations will be in 
charge of the international verification. 
  2. In this context, the parties agree to ask the UN 
secretary general to organize a mission to verify the human 
rights situation and compliance with commitments established in 
the agreement. The mission will form part of the global 
verification of the agreement for firm and lasting peace which 
the parties have agreed to sign as soon as possible this year. 
  3. The parties acknowledge the importance of national 
institutions, such as the judicial branch, the Attorney 
General's Office, and the Ombudsman for Human Rights, which are 
responsible for the validity, observance, and guarantee of human 
rights in the country. They especially emphasize the importance 
of the role of the Ombudsman for Human Rights. 
  4. The parties agree to ask the UN secretary general to 
establish a Verification Commission, taking the following into 
account: 
  Functions: 
  5. The mission will be assigned the following duties in 
verifying the human rights situation: 
  i. It will receive, assess, and follow up on charges of 
possible human rights violations. 
  ii. It will check that corresponding national 
organizations conduct the necessary investigations autonomously 
and effectively and in accordance to the Constitution of the 
Republic of Guatemala and international human rights norms. 
  iii. It will issue statements on the existence or 
nonexistence of human rights violations based on the evidence it 
can obtain in exercising its responsibilities as expressed in 
Article 10, Subparagraphs i), ii), iii), and iv), and will take 
into account investigations by the corresponding constitutional 
institutions. 
  6. The mission will verify other commitments in the 
current agreement and will determine the correct compliance of 
the parties. 
  7. According to the results of their verification 
activities, the mission will make recommendations to the 
parties, especially regarding measures necessary to promoting 
full observance of human rights and strict compliance with all 
points in the current agreement. 
  8. The mission will establish commissions for bilateral 
dialogue with each of the parties so as to allow comment on the 
mission's recommendations and thus speed the implementation of 
the preceding measures. 
  9. The mission will regularly send reports to the UN 
secretary general, who will brief this organization's 
responsible officials. Copies of the reports will be sent to 
the parties. 
  10. The mission is authorized to: 
  i) Settle and freely move about the national territory. 
  ii) Freely and privately meet with any person or group of 
persons for the appropriate fulfillment of its functions. 
  iii) Freely visit, without prior notification and 
whenever it is considered necessary for the fulfillment of its 
functions, state agencies as well as URNG camps. 
  iv) Gather the information needed to fulfill its mandate. 
  11. The mission may address the public through the media 
to disseminate information in connection with its functions and 
activities. 
  12. Within the verification of compliance with human 
rights, the mission will give special attention to the right to 
live, personal integrity and safety, individual freedom, the 
right to a fair trial, freedom of expression, freedom of 
movement, freedom to organize, and political rights. 
  13. When carrying out its functions, the mission will 
bear in mind the situation of the most vulnerable social groups 
in society and the people most directly affected by the military 
conflict (including displaced people, refugees, and returning 
refugees). 
  14. The mission's activities will address events and 
situations that occur after its installation. 
  15. To implement the general pledge on human rights 
(Chapter I of this agreement), the parties recognize as human 
rights those defined by the Guatemalan legal system, including 
treaties, conventions, and other international instruments on 
the subject to which Guatemala is a signatory. 
  Cooperation with and support for national human 
rights organizations 
  16. The parties agree on the need for international 
verification to help strengthen permanent constitutional 
organizations, and other government and nongovernment agencies, 
for the protection of human rights. In support of them, the 
verification mission will have the means to: 
  i) Cooperate with national organizations and agencies in 
all that is necessary for the effective protection and promotion 
of human rights. It will specifically advocate technical 
cooperation programs and carry out activities to strengthen 
government agencies. 
  ii) Offer its support to the judicial branch and 
auxiliary organizations, the Attorney General's Office, the 
Ombudsman for Human Rights, and the presidential human rights 
commission to help perfect and consolidate national 
organizations for the defense of human rights and an appropriate 
legal process. 
  iii) Sponsor international technical and financial 
cooperation required to strengthen the capability of the 
Ombudsman for Human Rights, and other national institutions and 
agencies, so that they may execute their functions in the human 
rights sector. 
  iv) Help develop a culture of respect for human rights in 
cooperation with the state and the different groups of which 
society is comprised. 
  Duration and structure of the mission 
  17. The mission will initially be established for one 
year; its mandate may be renewed. 
  18. The verification mission will be led by a chief, 
appointed by the UN Secretary General. He will have at his 
disposal international and national officials and experts in 
various specialties who are necessary to carry out the mission's 
duties. The Government of the Republic of Guatemala and the 
mission will sign the corresponding agreement concerning its 
headquarters, in accordance with the 1946 Vienna convention on 
diplomatic privileges and immunities. 
  Putting the international verification mission into 
operation 
  19. Taking into consideration their willingness to 
sponsor human rights in the country and the fact that the 
current agreement's provisions reflect constitutional rights 
already included in Guatemalan laws; and considering the 
international mission's task of strengthening national agencies 
and entities for the protection of human rights, particularly 
the Ombudsman for Human Rights, the parties recognize that it is 
advisable to begin verification of the human rights agreement, 
on an exceptional basis, before the agreement for a firm and 
durable peace is signed. 
  20. Given that the verification mission will begin its 
operations before the military conflict ends, and given that 
military operations continue, the mission will coordinate the 
necessary security measures. 
  21. The parties agree to immediately ask the UN secretary 
general to send a preliminary mission as soon as possible so 
that it may prepare the establishment of a mission within the 
shortest time possible and in coordination with the parties and 
to evaluate the financial and technical requirements essential 
to the verification of the human rights agreement. 
  Cooperation of the parties with the verification 
commission 
  22. The parties pledge to offer their fullest support to 
the mission and, in this regard, are dutybound to provide all 
the cooperation required to fulfill its functions, particularly 
in guaranteeing the safety of mission members or people who 
submit reports or who testify. 
  23. The international verification carried out by the 
mission will be done within the framework of this agreement's 
provisions. Any situation which arises in connection with the 
scope of this agreement will be settled through talks, as 
foreseen in Number 8. 
  Final provisions 
  First: This agreement will become effective on the date 
it is signed by the two parties. 
  Second: This agreement will be part of the agreement for 
a firm and durable peace. 
  Third: A copy of this agreement will be sent by the 
parties to the UN secretary general and the Ombudsman for Human 
Rights. 
  Fourth: This agreement will be fully publicized at 
national level, both in Spanish and in the Indian languages. 
The Ombudsman for Human Rights and the pertinent government 
offices will be in charge of this.

Soto Salan. 
  Joint Declaration by the Guatemalan Government and the

  With the intention of allowing the signing of the human 
rights agreement, a historical achievement within the peace

  [Text] Vice President Arturo Herbruger Asturias has 
defended the appointment of a military officer to the post of 
deputy minister of government and has noted that he does not 
understand why the UN recommends the opposite as there is a 
tendency around the world to incorporate military personnel into 
state civilian organizations. He explained: We are talking about 
a deputy minister, not about a government minister. I think, he 
added, there will be no problem. Besides, they are citizens too 
and have a right to participate in the country's political life. 
  When asked about the policy to demilitarize society, he said 
he agrees with it, although he noted that we are already a 
civilian society where the Army always plays an important role. 
  Meanwhile, Adolfo Reyes, the person in charge of security 
matters, has said he believes the presidential decision to 
appoint an officer to the post of deputy government minister is 
adequate but contrasts with recommendations from UN human rights 
experts. Christian Tomuschat and Monica Pinto, of the United 
Nations, have recommended that civilian authorities lead 
civilian security corps, something adhered to by the previous 
administration, he said. 
  Reyes explained this was a presidential order exercising a 
sovereign right in an effort to find suitable ways to fight 
crime. Reyes stated: It looks like this is the time for the 
military to occupy some positions. This decision must be 
respected. Reyes said that differences must not be established 
among Guatemalans based on their professions because what is 
important is respect for human rights and constitutional public 
order. 
  Reyes confirmed he had resigned from his post. He submitted 
his resignation to new Government Minister Danilo Parrinello and 
to President Ramiro de Leon Carpio because the leave of absence 
granted him by the Bank of Guatemala expires on 15 April. If he 
does not resign now, this leave would be extended another year. 
Reyes said Danilo Parrinello and de Leon Carpio asked him to 
stay on the job, but he admitted that it would be difficult to 
remain in this post because I did not help draft the security 
plan for which they will be responsible. Reyes noted that 
today, he and the goverment minister will go to the Bank of 
Guatemala to talk to the bank's president, Willy Zapata, about 
the possibility of Reyes continuing as an adviser on public 
security issues.

  [Text] While celebrating the anniversary of the killing of 
the brothers Rafael and Eduardo Vergara Toledo in Villa Francia 
District in 1985, groups of youngsters were involved yesterday 
in serious incidents at the intersection of Grecia and Jose 
Pedro Alessandri Avenues and in Villa Francia District. At 
least eight demonstrators were detained by Carabineros who went 
to restore public order. 
  After participating in a tribute to the killed MIR [Movement 
of the Revolutionary Left] members yesterday afternoon, a group 
of masked people set up barricades on Grecia Avenue and threw 
Molotov cocktails and stones. Carabineros cordoned off the area 
and caused huge traffic jams. Vehicles were diverted to nearby 
streets while Carabineros used water cannons and tear gas. 
  The new Israeli-made water cannons, exhibited at the FIDAE 
[International Aerospace Fair] and purchased by Carabineros to 
serve at the 29th Special Forces Precinct, were used for the 
first time. 
  Carabineros yesterday evening prevented another tribute to 
the killed MIR members in Villa Francia District, dispersing 
those who were planning to participate in it. 
  Manuel Vergara, the father of the killed MIR members, 
explained that it was a peaceful tribute and that Carabineros 
ordered the dismantling of the stage. He said: 
  [Begin Vergara recording] It was supposed to have been a 
very 
beautiful tribute. We could have had a video with a script, 
with artists. It was scheduled for 2000. The problem is that 
Carabineros arrived at 1830, surrounded the area, and even 
prevented the stage from being assembled. 
  Mounted Carabineros pushed the people. They charged at the

  While the mother of the Vergara brothers was expressing her 
protest to journalists, a water cannon soaked the journalists 
who were recording her comments. The Vergara family's house was 
completely flooded during this action. The water cannon soaked 
a Megavision team and a Chilevision cameraman was hit on the leg 
by a tear gas canister.

<F P=106> [Interview with Interior Minister German Correa by </F>
unidentified reporter in Santiago; date not given] 
  [Text] [ESTRATEGIA] As a militant Socialist Party [PS] 
member, what significance do you give your appointment as 
interior minister from the personal and political point of view? 
  [Correa] It is a great responsibility, a great challenge. I 
hope to do a good job because this position exerts major 
influence on the progress of the government. As a PS militant, I 
can say that President Eduardo Frei's gesture to appoint me to 
this post when I was PS president is a very clear sign of his 
strong inclination for consensus and the consolidation of this 
coalition [Coalition of Parties for Democracy, CPPD] that has 
been so beneficial to the country. Therefore, my appointment to 
this position also has a very important political and symbolic 
value. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] Does your appointment signify official 
recognition of the socialist world? 
  [Correa] I believe so. This brings an end to a very 
traumatic 
phase not only of disagreements and conflicts that culminated 
violently in the 1973 military coup but to all that happened 
during the 17 years of the military regime. It shows our 
determination for not only analyzing, even to a heartbreaking 
point, our past but also our contributions to this process. It 
is also evidence of our ability to govern responsibly and 
seriously by giving guarantees to all Chileans without any 
distinctions. My appointment has finally vindicated our 
capability to have a serious government in this country. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] Would it have been the same if a Christian 
Democratic Party [PDC] member was appointed interior minister, 
for example? 
  [Correa] From the point of view of the interior minister's 
functions, it is inconsequential who is exercising these duties 
because we must abide by what is established in the 
Constitution, which is the institutional order that establishes 
the duties of this post within the framework of the government 
and society. This is inconsequential from this point of view. 
I will be exercising this post to the best of my abilities and 
strictly adhering to the Constitution and the established 
institutional order. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] From the CPPD point of view, what is the 
significance of the appointment of a Socialist to this cabinet 
post? 
  [Correa] The CPPD has worked well. It has clearly shown its 
coherence in how it governed the country during the Aylwin 
administration. This coherence also will be clearly evident 
during the Frei administration because there is major consensus 
regarding what we want to achieve in the country. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] During the previous administration's first 
stage, when you were a cabinet member, Senator Ricardo Nunez 
(PS) charged that the government was isolating itself. Did you 
agree with this assessment? 
  [Correa] At the time not only I but also several 
administration members agreed with this PS criticism. There is 
an inclination to isolate yourself, to enclose yourself in 
government offices and internal government mechanisms that are 
very demanding. This is why we made some self-criticism at the 
time. We held several meetings in the Prieto room in this 
regard. As a result, we were able to overcome this isolation 
and achieve more fluent ties with people outside the government 
and have greater contact with people. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] How will you keep this from happening, because 
President Frei has stressed the idea of governing in the field? 
  [Correa] We are aware of this constant danger, but in this 
case we have anticipated events. Moreover, we have a president 
whose style is to work in the field, and very soon he will be 
putting this into practice. But of course one has to follow the 
boss because he is the leader. 
<H5>  Realistic Agenda </H5>
  [ESTRATEGIA] As chief of the political cabinet, given that 
the Socialists wanted to stress the political-institutional 
calendar, up to what point do you agree with the preestablished 
agenda? 
  [Correa] President Frei has been very clear about this. That 
apparent controversy among some CPPD member parties was solved 
when we all agreed to prioritize economic and social subjects. 
In this field we have the Aylwin administration's experience 
that clearly shows that the right firmly opposes certain kinds 
of reforms. What we must do is feel the water before jumping 
into the pool of reforms; we must first work and seek a point in 
common with the opposition, establish a dialogue, and discuss 
things. 
  Some other reforms, like to again allow the president of the 
Republic to appoint Armed Forces commanders, are very 
controversial. There is no agreement about this, and we will 
have to work more slowly and with more patience on it, seeking a 
consensus. The issue here is rhythm and strategy in order to 
make progress toward objectives that are not shared by all. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] Minister, don't you think that by postponing 
such subjects we are running the risk that something similar to 
what happened with the Senate president election might happen 
again? 
  [Correa] No. The decision is not to postpone the issue but 
to 
begin working on it now, in a manner so as to obtain results. 
Because what could we do now? Send the same draft bills that 
were rejected by the right and put them on Congress' agenda, 
perhaps with some changes, and then go to the fight? We will not 
gain anything from such a position. The most important thing is 
to establish a dialogue with the opposition, see what country we 
want from the political and institutional point of view, without 
seeking advantages, within normal democratic dynamics between 
government and opposition. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] From your point of view, what reform do you 
consider the most urgent one? 
  [Correa] There is a package of four very important reforms 
connected to the National Security Council's composition, the 
Constitutional Court, and the president's ability to appoint the 
forces of order and Armed Forces commanders. 
<H5>  Public Security </H5>
  [ESTRATEGIA] What is the meaning of the interministerial 
committees that will be created, as announced by the government, 
and specifically what will be the differences from the former 
administration's work? 
  [Correa] The former government had experience with 
interministerial committees. They are institutions that allow 
mutual dialogue and knowledge among the ministries, and they 
also allow the coordination of projects and the collective 
adoption of decisions so as to establish priorities in public 
investments in different fields; besides, they allow better 
administration. 
  We will continue with that positive experience and make some 
changes to it to guarantee greater efficiency and continue 
making progress. An important concrete change is the division of 
the social-economic committee into a social committee and an 
economic committee. The interministerial social committee will 
concentrate mainly on poverty problems. It also has a very 
important characteristic because it is directly presided over by 
the president of the Republic. This shows the importance the 
government assigns to a frontal confrontation of the country's 
poverty problem. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] In addition to poverty, citizens also are 
greatly concerned about an issue handled directly by your 
ministry: public security. What measures will be adopted to 
improve public security? 
  [Correa] We will start by studying the important measures we 
inherited from the previous administration on an important work 
they achieved: the proposed social safety plan... 
  [ESTRATEGIA] Excuse me, sir, but when did the past 
administration achieve this? 
  [Correa] Quite a lot of progress was achieved but there is 
obviously much more to be done. Much progress has been achieved 
by increasing police personnel and equipment but a lot remains 
to be done in this field. We must continue the training 
programs for police cadres, and achieve greater community 
involvement in public security activities not merely by 
establishing private guard groups but by adopting a different 
attitude toward citizens' participation in social safety. 
  There are many undetected social attitudes that promote 
crime 
such as the lack of preventive measures, and inconsiderate 
common behavior encouraging criminal activities that increase 
the job of the police, thus making it very difficult for them to 
perform well. There is a major task regarding the activities to 
be carried out by police and by society in general if we are to 
achieve a safer and more peaceful society. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] As for the terrorist issue, what is the 
government's assessment in this regard? 
  [Correa] The government's assessment is positive. A lot of 
progress was made in this regard during the previous 
administration. There was coordinated work among police 
institutions and the government itself. This resulted in the 
dismantling of violent groups, which today are in precarious 
shape. Nevertheless, no one can declare victory because all 
these groups need to be active is a small armed group of daring 
individuals and the element of surprise to cause a tragic 
incident. 
  At any rate, these groups have experienced a major 
diminishment of their capability to undertake action. 
Nevertheless, we must always be alert and continue 
consolidating democracy. Ultimately, what matters is to prevent 
these groups from spreading in our society. This will be 
achieved through growth and development, the creation of jobs 
for the young, giving more opportunities to people, and the 
defeat of poverty. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] Some sectors believe that the granting of 
pardons is synonymous with impunity. Can the granting of 
pardons harm the fight against terrorism? 
  [Correa] I don't think so. We must not overlook the fact 
that the CPPD as a whole -- not only the Aylwin administration 
and now the Frei administration -- at the proper time clearly 
established the differences between a political prisoner and 
terrorist violence. The ruling party coalition unanimously 
agreed by consensus that as 11 September 1990 -- when, as is the 
case of President Aylwin's election, a Chilean Government 
elected by the will of the people in a democratic election was 
installed -- democracy was fully restored in Chile with all its 
shortcomings. Therefore, these actions cannot continue to be 
portrayed as political crimes as such but as outright terrorist 
actions. In view of this, President Aylwin implemented these 
pardons. 
  It must be noted that during the authoritarian regime these 
people were treated with an absolute lack of respect for their 
basic rights. Many of these prisoners were incarcerated for 
prolonged periods without due process, virtually condemning them 
before the issuance of a valid court sentence. There are 
dramatic cases in which, after spending years in prison, those 
involved were acquitted because there was insufficient evidence 
to punish them for their behavior, that is, no crime was ever 
committed. In many instances, the accused served a kind of 
anticipated sentence. 
  Now many people will issue their opinion on this matter. As 
President Aylwin has always maintained, this is a matter of 
conscience in the end. In one way or the other, a very tragic 
chapter in the history of Chile is closing with this issue. 
Nevertheless, part of this chapter is still not closed because 
the trials on serious human rights violations during the 
military regime, which have been confirmed by all Chileans, 
still are pending. I believe that instead of harboring 
resentments from such a harsh and traumatic period for our 
country, all this should be part of a past we must try to 
overcome so we can restore the proper guidelines of peaceful 
coexistence and mutual respect. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] Minister, do you think the prisoners President 
Aylwin pardoned recently were political prisoners? 
  [Correa] That is the way the coalition as a group defined 
them. Their actions were politically motivated. They were wrong 
in my opinion, as I made clear in my capacity as a political 
leader. At the time of their crime I was president of the 
Popular Democratic Movement, which was defined by the military 
regime as the group making the harshest opposition to their 
continuation in government. In that capacity, I was also a 
strong critic of the attack against General Augusto Pinochet. 
  I was a member of Clodomyro Almeyda's Socialist Party and 
that was not our line of action. We promoted mass mobilizations 
and incorporating millions of Chileans in the democratic 
struggle. This struggle finally and happily materialized in the 
plebiscite. We participated in the plebiscite actively. We did 
not support any direct action like the attempt to assassinate 
Gen. Pinochet. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] Do you think the president's decision to pardon 
political prisoners was correct? 
  [Correa] I share his decision. We must remember that his 
pardon only changes their imprisonment to exile. We all know 
what it means not to be able to live in the fatherland. It means 
not to share in the cultural and human essence of Chilean 
society. The many thousands of exiles during the military regime 
know very well what it means to live outside of the country 
without the possibility of returning for many years. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] Do you agree with the pardon as a presidential 
prerogative? 
  [Correa] Yes. The pardon must exist as a prerogative. There 
are always special cases. The prerogative must be used in 
exceptional cases. It must be so as a matter of principle. I 
have no doubt that presidents will use that prerogative after 
carefully analyzing values, principles, and all the elements 
that influenced the behavior of the person considered for a 
pardon. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] Among President Aylwin's latest decisions, 
there 
was a pardon granted to an opposition party follower charged 
with involvement in economic crimes. What is your opinion about 
this pardon? 
  [Correa] Former President Aylwin must have considered the 
entire group of elements defining the situation. I am not aware 
of the details of the case, but President Aylwin must have 
considered them carefully. He probably found among those 
elements enough cause to grant the pardon in conscience. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] Will that practice continue during this 
government? 
  [Correa] The pardon is a juridical institution, a 
prerogative 
of the president of the Republic. Each case must have 
exceptional characteristics for a president to make use of that 
prerogative. I trust it will always be so. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] One of the issues that worries the country is 
corruption. Various cases of irregularities involving public 
servants were reported during the past government. What will 
this administration do to prevent those problems from 
reoccurring? 
  [Correa] We must be precise in the use of terms and how we 
characterize situations. I do not think there was corruption in 
President Aylwin's government. There were irregularities, which 
is something different from corruption as such. Some of the 
cases involving alleged corruption are being investigated. 
  No one can close his eyes to the possibility of corruption, 
no doubt about it. There are risks. There are relations between 
businessmen and politicians that invite corruption. There are 
situations inside a public office that facilitate corruption. 
But we should not forget that for corruption to exist two 
individuals must participate. In general terms, the blame 
affects more the person who has been corrupted, the person who 
accepted the bribe. Those who gave the bribe, and who often 
initiate the corrupt act, usually are not taken into account. 
  This is a more complex issue. Eduardo Frei's government will 
do everything necessary in the areas of supervision, prevention, 
auditing, and controls. We are working on the design of specific 
measures. We have been in power for a very short time. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] Will you also promote legislation on the 
matter? 
  [Correa] We will do that as well. We will reinforce the 
comptroller and other organizations' existing supervision 
capacity. 
  Regarding Codelco's [Copper Corporation] case, we think 
Cochilco [expansion unknown], which was responsible for auditing 
Codelco, performed rather weak work. We do not think they did 
their job very well. We must see that existing mechanisms work 
properly in public administration. The government will have to 
create responsibilities or control mechanisms wherever 
supervision is weak. But above all we must transmit a message to 
society, because there are multiple forms of corruption and 
citizens indulge in them every day. The fight against corruption 
is not the sole responsibility of the government though. We will 
fight it as best as we can, but citizens also must look at their 
own behavior and ethical norms. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] The political class has a more elegant corrupt 
practice. It is called influence peddling. People from your own 
party have denounced it. What do you think of it? 
  [Correa] In effect, we have influence peddling. When you are 
in very important positions you perceive it, but you can fight 
it. When I was transportation minister, I had the opportunity to 
handle multi-million dollar projects. We made important 
decisions, such as the one involving subway Line Five, which is 
a $300 million project. We had to organize bids involving the 
purchase of equipment for $100 million to $150 million. I 
oversaw the bidding on Santiago's street lights, which was worth 
$16 million, and many other large projects involving millions in 
investments. 
  You can create technical commissions, involve people from 
many areas to prevent government people alone from making the 
decision. You can create bid evaluation teams to analyze 
economic proposals and all stages of the process to grant a 
contract to a company. There are ways to ensure clarity, to be 
reassured, and reassure the population. All mechanisms created 
to prevent conspiracies to commit corruption must be implemented. 
  When you do things that way you can guarantee that the risk 
of corruption will be reduced to a minimum. It might even be 
eliminated. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] But are you aware that not everyone acted in 
that manner during the previous administration? 
  [Correa] I am perfectly aware of it, and it is very 
regrettable. We must reinforce the perception of what a public 
official should be and the immense responsibility that the 
management of public funds signifies. Public officials are 
there to safeguard these funds and to make them yield the best 
profits for the country's well-being. 
  At the proper time I pointed out that I thought it was 
immoral to allow the National Railroad Company to continue 
losing 21 billion pesos per year, that is, to lose from $60 
million to $80 million, just to keep it under state management. 
I must remind you that I am responsible for promoting a bill 
that resulted in the privatization of railroad freight services, 
a very lucrative railroad department. Based on very strict 
upholding of the meaning of the use of public funds -- which 
belong to all Chileans -- and of strict adherence to good 
management policies for public resources, we can achieve 
progress in the fight against corruption. Moreover, we must 
always be very alert, implement measures, and change 
responsibilities within the public administration when there is 
suspicion that strange things may be occurring. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] The Frei administration has inherited the 
Codelco problem. There is a very serious charge before the 
Chamber of Deputies on an alleged marketing network reportedly 
involving past and current administration officials. How is the 
government going to handle such a complex case? 
  [Correa] We have undoubtedly inherited a very complex case, 
but President Frei has been very explicit in stating that 
everything must be investigated to the very last detail so that 
all responsibilities are clarified, that once these 
responsibilities are established the proper legal proceedings 
will be undertaken to the bitter end if criminal actions are 
proven, of course. 
  The basic procedure is to investigate everything, not 
allowing anything to be hidden and, of course, not covering up 
anything. It is much more detrimental for a government to 
strive to diminish the damage that these kind of situations 
might cause, to try to minimize or cover up the impact, than to 
disclose the full truth. It is much healthier for an 
administration to do this because public credibility is 
essential for the strengthening of democracy. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] Finally, do you agree with the assessment made 
by Aylwin at the end of his term that there will an increase in 
social demands and an unfavorable international economic 
scenario? 
  [Correa] We are aware that we will be facing situations that 
might not be as favorable as those of the previous 
administration. But I do not believe the situation will be as 
dramatic as to say that this administration will be facing 
serious difficulties. It is possible that we might face more 
social demands, but it is also true that much has been done and 
that much more will be done by this administration in this 
regard, starting with the emphasis President Frei is putting 
into the fight against corruption. This is a difficult issue 
because it entails huge resources. It entails a nationwide 
effort but we believe the proper conditions are there to achieve 
this goal. Even the opposition has expressed its willingness to 
cooperate on this issue. 
  If we are able to achieve this goal, if we are able to 
maintain an important growth level, which perhaps may not be as 
high as expected because of prevailing international conditions, 
by generating new job sources, these situations can be 
confronted. Moreover, we also will be able to overcome 
complicated situations by granting workers, and people in 
general, greater freedom to exercise their rights, and we must 
perfect the legislation that limits these rights to do this.

  [Text] The Foreign Ministry [International] Economic 
[Relations] Directorate is seeking to increase exports of 
services, enhance the NAFTA negotiations, and explore new 
markets in Asia and other parts of the world. 
  This was reported by attorney Juan Salazar, the 
International 
Economic Relations director, who gave a broad description of the 
Foreign Ministry International Economic Relations Directorate's 
guidelines. 
  Salazar reported a substantial increase in the sale of 
Chilean services abroad, specially transportation and software 
sales, among other lines. 
  As an example, he mentioned that last year our country 
exported services worth $3.2 billion, which represents 40 
percent of our country's exports. 
  Salazar believes this Chilean impetus toward the world 
requires that entrepreneurs and the private sector conform to 
the new international requirements. He said it is necessary for 
executives to be more aggressive and penetrate new markets in 
other parts of the world like Asia, specially China and 
Malaysia. He said: 
  [Begin Salazar recording] We have tried to tell them about 
this new emphasis. For example, we have strongly mentioned 
Asia. There are new programs that [former International 
Economic Relations director] Jaime [Lavados Germain] already 
mentioned like market (?intelligence) and our country's image. 
There are negotiations that we will have to conduct. 
  We also talked about NAFTA. We talked about countries 
outside our region, outside Latin America. We talked about 
services, which is a very important area. Instead of using a 
meaningless phrase, let's say that this is our second phase. 
[end recording] 
  To implement these programs, for example, PROCHILE 
[Institute 
for Export Promotion] currently has 35 offices which it plans to 
increase to 200 across our country. Juan Salazar said a new 
entrepreneurial attitude is required. He said: 
  [Begin Salazar recording] There is a discrete deterioration 
of the Chilean export process. Some people want to blame this 
problem on the exchange rate, for example. As international 
trade increases, I believe Chile will be facing increasing 
competition. We have to refine both the state instruments and 
the private sector actions in order to face this competition. 
[end recording] 
  He said it would even be desirable if PROCHILE were 
privatized.

  [Text] A Christian Democratic Party [DC] delegation will 
visit Cuba in May. The delegation, which will be headed by DC 
President Gutenberg Martinez, also will include Chilean Human 
Rights Commission President Jaime Castillo Velasco and CUT 
[United Labor Confederation] President Manuel Bustos. 
  The visit's objective is to become familiar with the 
situation prevailing in the island, in all sectors. 
  Martinez justified the presence of Castillo Velasco and 
Bustos in the delegation: 
  [Begin Martinez recording] We deemed it appropriate for this 
type of delegation to include a former DC president like Jaime 
Castillo, whose opinion has been heard on topics dealing with 
doctrine and democracy and who also has international 
experience. In the case of Manuel Bustos, he is our party's top 
labor leader. We believe the DC lives not only in the political 
but also in the labor arena. [end recording] 
  Martinez ruled out that the visit will be sort of an advance 
step by the government coalition with a view toward the possible 
reestablishment of diplomatic relations. He admitted however, 
that the issue, which -- as he put it -- has many sides, is 
being analyzed by the government and the DC. 
  On the other hand, Gutenberg Martinez said Cuba has placed 
no 
restrictions on the delegation's visit. Cuban General Consul in 
Chile Humberto Hernandez made a similar statement: 
  [Begin Hernandez recording] They will make good contacts 
with 
(?social sectors), Cuban authorities, and party and government 
officials. They will see the actual situation in Cuba and they 
will form their own opinion. [end recording] 
  Asked whether the delegation will be able to visit 
everything, even jails, the consul said specific conversations 
should be made about the subject in Cuba. 
  Asked about the presence of Fidel Castro and the holding of 
democratic elections, Hernandez replied that there is democracy 
in Cuba, although with imperfections.

  [Excerpt] Engineer Juan Manuel Cano Fleitas was installed 
this morning as the new CORPOSANA [Water and Sanitation 
Corporation] president. He replaces Engineer Guillermo Sanchez 
Guffanti, who tendered his resignation after five years as 
CORPOSANA head. 
  According to what he told the press, Sanchez Guffanti 
resigned due to unavoidable personal reasons and commitments 
which demand more of his time than his official duties would 
allow. Unofficial reports stated that Sanchez Guffanti tendered 
his resignation at the request of President Juan Carlos Wasmosy.

  [Text] President Alberto Fujimori has reiterated that 
legislative decree No. 776 [not further specified] will not be 
repealed. He said this issue will not be dealt with in political 
discussions. Commenting on another issue, Fujimori said he 
respects his Ecuadoran counterpart's, Sixto Duran-Ballen, the 
decision against traveling to Peru, but he made it clear that 
the invitation still stands. 
  [Begin recording] [Fujimori] We have to continue working 
along the same serious lines, without adding any demagogic or 
populist ingredient. Because you know what the answers are; the 
people are well aware of them -- earnest effort, sound 
management of the economy, and unheard-of levels of government 
resources, which total some billion dollars. International 
reserves exceed the benchmark of $3 billion. We are now talking 
about billions, not millions. The government will continue with 
the same economic program, which will enable us to definitely 
overcome our problems. We have to avoid discussing or taking 
measures by letting ourselves be carried away by a passing 
euphoria because that will be tantamount to going backwards. We 
have to avoid this at all costs. This is why I am not concerned 
about public opinion polls. 
  [Unidentified reporter] [question indistinct] 
  [Fujimori] I am going to continue with my job, I am going to 
work harder and earnestly in handling the economy and everything 
we have started. 
  [Reporter] Is there going to be any change with regard to 
the 
decree, some details of which have been criticized? 
  [Fujimori] The decree [passage indistinct]. 
  [Reporter] With regard to the Ecuadoran president's decision 
to suspend his visit to Peru [passage indistinct]. 
  [Fujimori] Only through the media. As you very well know, 
both the Ecuadoran community and the president himself [words 
indistinct] Peru is awaiting this visit with open arms. Whether 
this visit has been postponed or not, whether it will be made in 
the near future or not, we want to welcome him with open arms. 
I suppose there are circumstances preventing him from coming to 
Peru for the time being. 
  [Reporters interrupting] [passage indistinct] 
  [Fujimori] The invitation still stands; it is an ongoing and 
open invitation. 
  [Reporter] In any case, Mr. President, this decision to 
postpone this trip again... 
  [Fujimori, interrupting] These are decisions that the 
invited 
person has every right to take -- to set the most appropriate 
date. We will conform to this... 
  [Reporter interrupting] Do you think, Mr. President, that 
relations between the two countries may deteriorate because of 
this decision? 
  [Fujimori] No, bilateral relations are at their highest 
level. Current circumstances do not change the [words 
indistinct]. [end recording]

  [Text] The National Counterterrorism Directorate (Dincote) 
budget has been considerably reduced in the last few months. As 
a result, operational and intelligence services by this 
specialized unit in its fight against the Shining Path and the 
Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) have decreased 
considerably. Various sources consulted have asserted that, 
compared with previous years, the budget has been reduced 30 to 
40 percent. 
  It also has been reported that the number of trips to the 
provinces usually taken by Dincote members have been reduced to 
only extremely necessary ones, like when the presence of 2d 
Counterterrorism Intelligence Division (Divicote-2) personnel 
was requested in Trujillo. This operation ended with the arrest 
of six important MRTA leaders. Aside from this, no trips have 
been taken to the interior. 
  Until 1993, personnel from different Divicotes and even the 
so-called "Delta" Group frequently traveled to the interior. 
Their trips yielded good results and several members of regional 
MRTA directorates, who also belonged to the MRTA national board, 
were arrested. 
  Budget cutbacks are also affecting the serious and patient 
intelligence work (basic pursuits) by Dincote detectives. They 
said: "Now the chiefs are recommending we do not spend more than 
the indispensable expenses. Nonetheless, if we do not risk some 
expenses, we will not be able to succeed. If we had followed 
orders, we would not have arrested Abimael Guzman and his 
leaders. Sometimes we have to grope in the dark until we are 
able to obtain important information." 
  It also has been reported that, so far, almost 30 
high-ranking officials have been appointed to the National 
Intelligence Service (SIN), including those comprising 
Divicote-1 or the Special Intelligence Groups (GEIN) that 
captured Abimael Guzman. 
  They have explained that only now, with the presence of 
these 
specialized detectives, is SIN really conducting intelligence 
work and supplying appropriate information to the operational 
units that conduct the required raids.

  [Excerpts] A high-ranking official of the Antidrug Division 
[Dinandro] has said that Margarita Cachique Rivera's arrest will 
inevitably lead to the dismantling of the drug trafficking gang 
led by her brother Abelardo, aka "Teniente" or "Negro." 
Dinandro intelligence agents caught the woman, who was at 
large, as she was leaving one of her properties in Chorrillos. 
  The "firm" of the Cachique Rivera brothers, which also 
includes brothers Segundo, aka "Capitan" or "Guno"; Adolfo, aka 
"Alferez"; Nicolas, aka "Mayor"; and their father Gaudencio 
Cachique Sajami, is considered the Cali cartel's main cocaine 
hydrochloride supplier. According to Directorate estimates, the 
gang sends to Colombia 1,000 kg of cocaine and 20 tons of 
cocaine base per month. 
  Margarita Cachique Rivera, her father, and her brothers are 
wanted by the Seventh Court and by the 30th Lima Court on drug 
trafficking charges. Born on 7 May 1964 in Rupa Rupa district, 
Leoncio Prado Province, Huanuco, Margarita's job was to contact 
international drug traffickers' organizations in Lima, perform 
financial operations, and buy the chemicals for the production 
of cocaine base and cocaine hydrochloride. 
  She was captured last Sunday, in the evening, in the 
vicinity 
of Alameda Premio Real Avenue, in block J, lot 16, of the La 
Encantada neighborhood in Chorrillos. She was carrying neither 
arms nor drugs, and did not resist arrest. 
  The source said: "We are aware of the Cachique Riveras' 
movements," adding that "the Margarita's arrest will give us 
positive clues for finding her brothers. Undoubtably, it is a 
very important arrest." The Cachique Riveras, who are led by 
"Abelardo" or "Teniente," is an organization that, according to 
some specialists, is the third most important "firm" after 
Demetrio Chavez Penaherrera, aka "Vaticano," whose firm is now 
led by his brother Elias, aka "Quichin" or "Sony," and Colombian 
Walter Simeon Vargas Arias, aka "El Ministro." [passage omitted] 
  According to Dinandro, "Teniente" was spotted last February 
in Boca del Manu, Madre de Dios. He is believed to have 
travelled to that area to personally collect money obtained 
through drug sales from the Colombian "Pablito," who has 
operated in this department since October 1993. 
  Antinarcotics agents have learned that "Pablito" refused to 
honor his debt, resulting in a shootout between the henchmen of 
both mafia members. The Colombian, however, finally decided to 
honor his debt. The Dinandro official said that "if 'Pablito' 
had to go to Madre de Dios, the debt must have been very large, 
and also the drug shipment that was sold to the Colombian."

  [Text] Lima, 29 Mar (EFE) -- Today, General Nicolas 
Hermoza, chief of the High Command of the Peruvian Armed Forces, 
reported that the price of cocaine base has fallen abruptly 
following recent security service actions against the 
trafficking gangs. Hermoza said the price of washed cocaine base 
has fallen the past few weeks from $1,500 to $150 per kilo. He 
presented 23 traffickers to the media, who were captured in the 
jungle department of Madre de Dios while shipping 1,051 kg of 
cocaine to Colombia. Hermoza also showed assets seized from the 
traffickers, including electric generators, precursors to 
manufacture cocaine base, communications equipment, and vehicles. 
  The traffickers were captured in several operations last 
week 
in the province of Inapari, Madre de Dios Department, on the 
Brazilian borde, where a drug collection center operated. 
Hermoza indicated that the cocaine paste, which was to have been 
processed into cocaine hydrochloride in Colombia, had arrived 
from the Huallaga valleys and from the Ucayali River area. 
  The military commander said: "These traffickers' capture and 
their equipment is proof that land and air actions in the 
Huallaga and Ucayali areas have caused the trafficking axis to 
be moved from there to Madre de Dios Department." 
  Security forces seized 3,653 kg of basic paste and captured 
13 traffickers on 24 February in Boca Manu, also in Madre de 
Dios Department, in the largest drug seizure ever in this Andean 
country. Peru produces some 2,000 tons of basic paste per annum, 
which is exported mainly to Colombia where the Cali and Medellin 
"cartels" process it into the pure cocaine that is sold in the 
United States and Europe. Two-thirds of all cocaine consumed in 
the world is processed from the basic paste that comes from Peru.

  [Excerpt] Three Chilean and two Peruvian terrorists, who 
were members of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement and who 
were captured last year by DINCOTE [Counterterrorism 
Directorate], will serve life imprisonment penalties on charges 
of high treason. The decision was confirmed yesterday by the 
Special Military Court of the Peruvian Air Force, which reviewed 
the trial as an appellate court. 
  The penalty will be imposed on Chileans Jaime Francisco 
Sebastian Castillo Petruzzi, Lautaro Enrique Mellado Saavedra, 
and Maria Concepcion Pincheira Saenz, and on Peruvians Heber 
Celso Oliva Zelada and Segundo Nemesio Alva Marin, who were 
involved in the abduction of Peruvian entrepreneur Raul Hiraoka 
Torres and other crimes. 
  The public relations office of the Supreme Council of the 
Military Courts explained that high treason is the legal name 
for aggravated terrorism, "which because of its juridical nature 
and its dangerousness applies to both nationals and foreigners, 
because terrorism is a crime against mankind that is repressed 
ex officio in all countries of the world." [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Supreme Court Chairman Luis Serpa Segura told 
Italian prosecutor Vittorio Paraggio during a meeting held in 
the past few days that Peruvian justice has issued a national 
arrest warrant against former President Alan Garcia Perez. 
  This was reported by congressman Fernando Olivera, a member 
of the congressional committee investigating the fraud case of 
the Lima subway's construction. The committee members met last 
week with the Italian prosecutors visiting Peru to investigate 
the case, who returned to Italy on 20 March. 
  The arrest order, however, has not been transmitted yet to 
Interpol, Olivera said. "I have talked with the Interpol 
representative in Peru and he told me he was not informed by the 
judicial branch about the arrest warrant," he said. 
  Olivera demanded that the Supreme Court immediately transmit 
the arrest order to Interpol in order "to prevent Alan Garcia 
from continuing to flout the law and stay abroad as if he were 
not sought in Peru." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Enrique Vidal] </F>
  [Text] Argentine Ambassador Arturo Osorio has said that 
Argentina will support Peru's bid to export radioisotopes 
produced at the Huarangal nuclear plant. He said this after 
visiting the modern facilities located some 33 km north of Lima. 
In the company of Peruvian Nuclear Energy Institute Director 
Conrado Seminario, Osorio made the following comments: 
  [Begin recording] [Osorio] We have visited this nuclear 
plant 
and can appreciate its optimum level of efficiency, the high 
level of professional training, and their excellent skill in 
handling this delicate nuclear plant, which also represents a 
security issue for the world. It conforms to the strictest 
nuclear safety regulations and it is really marvelous. It is a 
great satisfaction for those of us who have worked together to 
build this nuclear power plant as it will enable us to continue 
our partnership from a commercial standpoint or through the 
reciprocal transfer of technology by means of this great work, 
which is perhaps the most important nuclear reactor in Latin 
America. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Are you hinting at the possibility 
of 
entering into an export partnership? 
  [Osorio] Yes, there is that possibility. 
  [Reporter] How could this be made into something concrete, 
Mr. Ambassador? 
  [Osorio] That is a subject for experts to address. I believe 
that once the authorities of both countries discuss things at 
technical level, we will have, perhaps in the near future, a 
positive [words indistinct]. [end recording] 
  That was Argentine Ambassador to Lima Arturo Osorio, after 
making a technical inspection of the Huarangal nuclear power 
plant and its 10-megawatt reactor accompanied by Conrado 
Seminario. The plant building, which will also produce 
radioisotopes used in medicine and in industry, has been 
possible thanks to the technical cooperation of Argentine 
experts. We should point out that 35 percent of the electrical 
energy consumed in Argentina is produced by nuclear power plants.

  [Text] Venezuelan Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli 
Rivas has said that relations between Venezuela and Colombia 
remain excellent after the Venezuelan candidate for OAS 
secretary general withdrew from the race. These relations were 
never affected by the campaign for the post of OAS secretary 
general, he added. "Relations are excellent and will remain so" 
despite the struggle for the post, he said. 
  A number of vehicles stolen in Venezuela, taken to Colombia, 
and returned by Colombian authorities in a joint effort by the 
Colombian-Venezuelan border commissions, will arrive in the 
country next week, the minister said, although the information 
had already been published. 
  Venezuela succeeded in having the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency sign an agreement to lift the ban on 
reformulated Venezuelan gasoline, Burelli Rivas said. He also 
said that PDVSA [Venezuelan Petroleum, Inc.], the Foreign Trade 
Institute, the Energy and Mines Ministry, and the Foreign 
Ministry also succeeded in having the EU accept orimulsion 
[water-emulsified fuel] in their markets. 
  The delegation that will represent Venezuela during next 
Sunday's OAS session is made up of the deputy foreign minister 
and the ambassador to the organization, Guido Grooscos. The 
latter will vote on behalf of the country during the election 
for secretary general. Demetrio Boesner was designated acting 
director general of the Foreign Ministry. 
  Portuguese Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva will visit 
Venezuela in the second half of June to improve bilateral ties 
and discuss ways to improve trade between the two countries. 
  The president of the prime minister's cabinet is scheduled 
to 
arrive in Caracas in the middle of May to agree on the items 
that Cavaco Silva will discuss during his stay. The information 
was confirmed by the Portuguese ambassador during a visit to the 
foreign minister's office.

  [Text] Venezuelan Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli 
Rivas has confirmed the appointment of Vice Admiral Radames 
Munoz Leon as defense ministry adviser in the United States. 
Burelli Rivas explained the post has no diplomatic status. The 
appointment was requested by the Defense Ministry. 
  [Begin recording] [Burelli] It is not a diplomatic post. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Precisely, but within the Armed 
Forces... 
  [Burelli, interrupting] The Defense Ministry made the 
decision, and the Foreign Ministry is not authorized to discuss 
this. 
  [Reporter] If this is not a diplomatic post, why is he being 
given a diplomatic passport? 
  [Burelli] Well, this status is provided when any function is 
carried out abroad on behalf of the Venezuelan state, to 
facilitate things and provide an advantage during a mission. The 
only assistance provided by the Foreign Ministry is the issuance 
of a special passport, or a diplomatic passport. [end recording] 
  As expected, the foreign minister was asked how statements 
by 
[Lieutenant Colonel Hugo] Chavez, who has said he does not rule 
out the possibility of a military coup, would affect the 
country's image. The minister minimized these statements and 
said the fact that Chavez has joined politics strengthens 
Venezuela's democratic position. 
  The Venezuelan foreign minister declined too much comment on 
criticisms surroundeding the recent election of the OAS 
secretary general. But Burelli Rivas did say he wants to address 
the Congress to explain what happened with regard to Venezuela's 
candidate.

<F P=106> [Report by Mayra Chirino Ochoa] </F>
  [Text] An official source has reported that Finance 
Minister Julio Sosa Rodriguez presented the 1995 budget, worth 
1.7 trillion bolivares, to the Council of Ministers on 23 March. 
The source added that there are plans to drastically reduce the 
debt by an estimated 70 percent next year. This plan implies the 
exclusion of treasury bonds as a financing mechanism and the 
refinancing of the debt owed to multilateral organizations. It 
was reported that World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank 
financing will be limited to projects liable to be carried out. 
This is part of the new administration's policy of reducing the 
debt to its barest minimum. 
  The estimated price of a barrel of oil, production figures, 
and rate of exchange were not reported. Several options are 
being studied, but the Council of Ministers will make the final 
decision. The new public administration employees' salary 
classifications, which were approved by the government of Ramon 
J. Velasquez and which will go into effect this year, were 
incorporated into the next year's budget. 
  Although not yet signed into legislation, the revenue from 
the Value-Added Tax [VAT] applied on wholesalers, luxury taxes, 
and higher income taxes were included in the 1995 budget after 
the reforms were introduced at the Congress. In this regard, it 
has been reported that negotiations will be held with the 
Legislative Branch because these are proposals not yet passed 
into law. 
  It is worthwhile mentioning that VAT was included in the 
1993 
budget when the tax had not yet been approved and that, for this 
reason, the budget was turned down by the Congress. At the 
time, the Congress decided to substitute the anticipated revenue 
from VAT for treasury bonds, thus balancing the budget. 
  According to the Budget Law, the 1995 budget should be 
presented to the Congress in the second half of April. 
Therefore, it is expected to be presented between 15 and 20 
April. The finance minister had previously considered the 
possibility of asking Congress for an extension to present the 
budget in June. The idea, however, was dismissed for political 
reasons and it was decided to stick to the deadline stipulated 
by law.

  [Text] Within the next few days constitutional reform will 
be the fundamental issue that Congress will consider. This 
debate is expected to be heated, with marked difference of 
opinion among the political groups now dominating Parliament. 
  This Wednesday [16 Feb], the Bicameral Conference Committee 
will meet with experts from the Legal Advisory Service of 
Congress to determine whether the constitutional debate will 
start from zero, or if it will use the work done by the former 
legislature, in which deputies approved the first and second 
readings of the constitutional reform bill, and the Senate left 
its second reading pending. On this matter there are a number of 
divergent opinions among members of Congress. Some believe the 
debate should start from zero, but taking as a base the previous 
work done. 
  In light of the political panorama the National Congress now 
presents, Causa R [Radical Cause] believes the constitutional 
reform debate should start from zero, but first the present 
Congress should be dissolved. 
  Causa R is actually working on a new Constitution, convening 
individuals and groups for a national debate. The constitutional 
reform debate was conducted inside the walls of Congress, and 
the people did not take part in that debate. A new Constitution 
requires the people's views and direct participation. 
  Pablo Medina, the head of Causa R's parliamentary group, 
objects: "Is this fraudulent National Congress going to debate 
the Constitution? The country does not want this Congress: we, 
the way things are going...When we hold all these debates on 
choosing the Treasury inspector and prosecutor, the people are 
going to call for the dissolution of Congress. We are going to 
request the dissolution of Congress and the holding of a 
referendum so the people can decide whether or not this Congress 
should continue to lead the discussion of bills and the 
constitutional reform." He added that this Congress has no moral 
or political authority to debate constitutional reform, as this 
Congress is the product of a fraud. "There are a million invalid 
votes. AD [Democratic Action] and COPEI [Social Christian Party] 
added 40 deputies and that is what gave them a majority. 
Therefore, they have no legitimacy. This is an illegitimate 
Congress. It has no legitimacy to function, much less to reform 
the Constitution." 
  He explained that although the present Constitution does not 
include a provision for a dissolution referendum, it is possible 
to conduct a vote of the nation on whether or not the people 
want this Congress to be dissolved. 
  "In Colombia a Constituent Congress was held and the 
Colombian Constitution did not include that possibility. They 
did it for political reasons: it was right for the country. We 
are considering how to do this, but we are convinced that this 
Congress should go; it should be dissolved." 
  According to Senator Humberto Celli, the work done by the 
former legislature on constitutional reform was not exclusive to 
that legislature, and so it should be considered by the new 
Congress. He believes that recent years have been quite eventful 
and the nation's present situation is completely different, 
"even the political makeup of the chambers is completely 
diffent, and all this requires a new study which this Congress 
needs to undertake, while also taking into account the work done 
by the former Congress." The deputy leader of the COPEI group, 
Nelson Chitty La Roche, thinks the new definition of the 
political and parliamentary landscape requires that the 
constitutional reform debate be started anew. 
  "The parliamentarians who have been chosen by our people to 
represent them must offer their views, their opinions on the 
constitutional issue, for we have to realize that our political 
life is not a two-party system now; the political map is now 
divided into four, and the social constitution now being debated 
in the streets is permeated with the spirit of society. It must 
have some influence on determining what the constitutional 
reform debate will be." 
  Deputy Nelson Chitty La Roche believes that some of the 
issues of importance which will have to be dealt with in the 
constitutional debate are revocation [or dissolution] referenda, 
the media oligarchy, the military justice system, and the 
decentralization process.

  [Text] The deputy leader of COPEI's parliamentary group, 
Nelson Chitty La Roche, said that Article 250 of the National 
Constitution states that the Constitution may not be subjected 
to pressures, and "certainly not to mechanisms different from 
those provided for its amendment and reform," thereby rejecting 
the statement by radical Deputy Pablo Medina, who has called for 
the dissolution of Congress as the starting point for the debate 
on a new Constitution. 
  According to Chitty La Roche, acting in contradiction to 
what 
is prescribed by the present Constitution would be the same as 
carrying out a coup d'etat. For that reason, he disagrees with 
Medina's statements. 
  In the opinion of the Social Christian parliamentarian, 
Congress should concern itself with "legislating for the 
people"; he argues that "the National Constitution is an 
esoteric concept for people who live in slums." 
  Despite that statement, Chitty La Roche does not oppose 
reforming the present Constitution, although he advocates doing 
so in a more gradual way than what Deputy Medina has proposed. 
  Chitty La Roche also reiterated the need to legislate for 
the 
people's interests, mentioning in this regard the need to amend 
the Mortgage Debtor Law, among others. 
  Finally, the Social Christian deputy said: "The procedures 
for constitutional revision, amendment, and reform are set forth 
in the Constitution, and we can offer our support only for those 
procedures, unless we are to begin the French revolutionary 
process and call for the abolition of all institutions, with 
liberty to begin by prohibiting everything. And especially by 
prohibiting prohibitions."

  [Text] The former presidential candidate of AD [Democratic 
Action], Claudio Fermin, categorically and absolutely rejected 
the dissolution of the National Congress advocated by Causa R 
[Radical Cause], a party he feels "is based on antidemocratic 
concepts; moreover, it does not address what the country needs 
for its progress and well-being." 
  He believes such proposals are common in parties like Causa 
R 
when they do not win the people's support. "They try to 
eliminate all centers of free discussion and to denigrate all 
institutions. I think that proposal is not in harmony with the 
country's aspirations; we need forums for debate, centers for 
legislation, for the supervision of public services, not a 
totalitarian, dictatorial schema that is alien from any true 
decision-making by the people." 
  Fermin thus expressed his absolute opposition to the 
proposal 
by Causa R's Deputy Pablo Medina and added that, as a democrat, 
a member of a party that wants a society in which all may 
participate and develop programs, he cannot support a proposal 
that is compatible with a totalitarian society, which propagates 
the view that the best thing is to eliminate parliaments, laws, 
and anything else that may be troublesome for minority groups 
that want to establish their power over the people and against 
the people. 
  He believes that is the explanation behind Causa R's 
proposal. "This organization's behavior is contrary to the 
harmonious coexistence of the Venezuelan people." 
  He said that Medina and his party have made an isolated 
proposal that will not go anywhere, "for this society has for 
many years grown accustomed to electing municipal councils, 
legislatures, mayors, governors, senators and deputies, all of 
which provide the foundation for popular representation."

<F P=106> [Article by Adela Leal] </F>
  [Excerpt] The views expressed in Congress suggest that the 
proposal to dissolve the National Congress which was made by 
Causa R [Radical Cause] Deputy Pablo Medina will not succeed, at 
least through legal means. The proposal has been considered by 
some supporters of President Caldera, in case the present 
Parliament might make a regular practice of blocking government 
policies. 
  The opinions expressed by some legislators from different 
political groups suggest that a hypothetical dissolution of the 
legislative chambers, through a constitutional reform, will be 
rejected. 
  The views expressed agree that a decision like the one 
proposed should not be considered in terms of its application to 
the present Congress, but rather as a general standard 
applicable in specific circumstances of Venezuela's national 
life. 
  One of those holding this view is Segundo Melendez, head of 
the MAS [Movement Toward Socialism] parliamentary group. In his 
opinion, a circumstance of the kind proposed should be 
established in the Constitution in a very clear and precise 
manner. In addition, it should respond to a structural situation 
related to the state's operation, so that political situations 
that might arise during a parliamentary term could be resolved 
by constitutional means. 
  But calling for such a step because this Congress or any 
other Congress might be in a crisis situation that requires the 
application of a constitutional regulation which does not exist, 
but which needs to be discussed at that time, is a mistake. 
  He cited the need to debate the reform of the 
Constitution--if this long-awaited debate actually takes 
place--"in the abstract," on the basis of major general problems 
in order to develop a response to those general problems. If 
later they are applicable to this or to any other Parliament, in 
specific circumstances, that is a different matter. But there 
already exists a mechanism to deal with the situation that has 
now arisen. 
<H5>  A Detailed Analysis </H5>
  Pablo Medina, deputy and secretary general of Causa R, 
though, using an "innovative interpretation" of the 
Constitution, invokes Article 4 of the Constitution, which 
states that sovereignty resides in the people and is exercised 
through the ballot. He believes that the people, through a 
referendum, can dissolve the present Congress which he calls 
"worthless" because, in his view, many of the people in Congress 
got there through electoral fraud. 
  However, in his proposal, Deputy Medina seems not to 
[correctly] interpret the general spirit of this clause which, 
while it does indeed state that sovereignty resides in the 
people, makes it very clear that the people exercise this 
sovereignty by voting for the organs of public authority, one of 
which is the legislative branch. Therefore, any dissolution must 
be made through a constitutional reform or by the use of force.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Colombian economic developments monitored through 29 
March. 
  The National Administrative Department of Statistics, DANE, 
has disclosed that in 1993 commercial trade increased 4.25 
percent, due primarily to an increase in the sale of furniture 
and electrical appliances which, in turn, was prompted by 
increased construction. DANE figures show that sales in December 
increased by 8.79 percent compared to the same period on 1992. 
Vehicles and replacement parts sold the most at 15.62 percent, 
and fuel and lubricants sold the least at minus 7.26 percent. 
Although sales were up, jobs decreased by 1.48 percent in 
comparison to 1992. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 17 
Mar 94 p 4B) 
  The prices of staple products continue to increase in a 
worrisome manner. During the first 10 days of March the cost of 
living increased by 1.94 percent, which usually happens every 
month, but the government fears that if the trend continues 
throughout the month the quarterly cost of living rate could 
increase to up to 10 percent. Some analysts believe the excess 
of money in circulation is also a factor. In 1993 food, which 
represents 34 percent of the cost of living, increased by only 
14.5 percent. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 18 Mar 
pp 1, 1B) 
  Foreign investment in Colombia increased by 8.6 percent in 
January compared to the same month in 1993. Total investment, 
excluding petroleum, was $21.7 million in January 1994 compared 
to $19.9 million in January 1993. The Investing in Colombia 
Corporation reported that 89.7 percent of this investment went 
to the mining sector. The manufacturing sector received 6.2 
percent. The United Kingdom was the top investor with $17.4 
million, that is, 84.4 percent of total foreign investment in 
Colombia in January 1994. All of it went to the mining sector. 
The United States was second with 13.1 percent and it also 
invested in the mining sector. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in 
Spanish 19 Mar 94 p 3B) 
  Colombian purchases abroad increased by 47.2 percent between 
January and November 1993 compared to the same period in 1992. 
Exports grew by only 2.7 percent in the same period. According 
to DANE, imports totaled $8.948 billion, and exports totaled 
$6.504 billion. Economists think that this is due to the 
revaluation of the peso. The import of consumer and capital 
goods and construction materials experienced the highest growth 
rate, more than 70 percent. The import of vehicles grew by 148 
percent and the import of weapons by 215 percent. Exports 
increased from $6.332 billion to $6.504. Traditional exports, 
such as coffee, petroleum, coal, and ferrous nickel 
[ferroniquel], dropped by 6.46 percent. Meanwhile, 
nontraditional exports grew by 11.37 percent. (Santa Fe de 
Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 19 Mar 94 p 3B) 
  The Board of the Cartagena Accord has reported that the 
exchange of goods and services among the members of the Andean 
Group, comprised by Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and 
Venezuela, reached $2.886 billion in 1993, that is, a 
117-percent increase compared to 1990. Excluding fuel, exports 
among Andean countries in 1993 reached $2.642 billion, a 34.1 
percent increase compared to 1992. In 1993 Colombia exported 
$1,159,800,000 or 40.2 percent of total intra-subregional trade. 
Venezuela was the main destination for Colombian exports. 
Sales to that country totaled $711.6 million. Venezuela was 
the second Andean Group exporter with $987.5 million or 34.2 
percent of total intra-subregional sales. Most Venezuelan 
exports went to Colombia. Ecuador registered the largest 
increase in intra-subregional exports with 76 percent. Bolivia 
increased exports by 8 percent and Peru by 10.4 percent in 1993. 
(Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 23 Mar 94 pp 1B, 3B) 
  Foreign Trade Minister Juan Manuel Santos and Agriculture 
Minister Jose Antonio Ocampo sent a letter dated 23 March to the 
newspaper EL TIEMPO stating that the government is not planning 
to reduce tariffs on and protective measures for the 
agricultural sector, or alter the price of agricultural produce 
in order to stop the rise of inflation. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL 
TIEMPO in Spanish 24 Mar 94 p 8A) 
  The members of the Association of Coffee Producers on 24 
March decided to reduce from 20 percent to 10 percent their 
withholding of exportable coffee, a measure they have 
implemented since October 1993. They had agreed that as soon as 
the price of coffee reached 75 cents per pound they would cut 
withholding by half. This in fact happened because the price of 
coffee was over 75 cents yesterday. This decision was made 
during a meeting in London. The member countries decided to 
continue this strategy because it has so far produced good 
results. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 25 Mar 94 p 1B) 
  The next government must manage the petroleum bonanza very 
prudently and save part of those resources if it wants to come 
out a winner from one of the greatest economic challenges of 
recent years. President Cesar Gaviria, World Bank officials, and 
international experts made this recommendation yesterday at the 
opening of a seminar organized by the National Planning 
Department. President Gaviria said that the Cusiana oil fields 
must be used to decrease poverty levels and achieve a sustained 
growth rate. The country currently has a reserve of 3.6 billion 
barrels of petroleum. Gaviria pointed out that the country must 
continue its search for new oil fields. Gaviria urged his 
successor to follow the example of Indonesia, which progressed 
after a petroleum boom. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 
25 Mar 94 p 1B)

  [Text] In an effort to save the policemen who patrol the 
neighborhoods, blocks, and villages, the National Police 
yesterday officially launched the Community Participation 
Program, which is essentially designed to integrate the 
community and the police. 
  The plan was announced by General Carlos Alberto Pulido 
Barrantes, director of community participation, at a press 
conference, where he explained the scope of the official 
strategy for improving the police's image. 
  The official indicated that one of the most important 
aspects 
of the program is the selection of the personnel who will serve 
as patrol officers and whose job will be to interact with the 
community in their assigned areas. 
  The patrol officers will be selected very carefully, 
according to the police plan, to make sure that only qualified, 
well-mannered people with a strong civic spirit are chosen. 
  "We will no longer take people," said Pulido, "who have 
nothing to do, who have been rejected elsewhere. The selection 
process will involve background checks, and the best high school 
graduates from each community will be identified." 
  For now, the police academies will train the first 400 
patrol 
officers, who will begin working in the underprivileged 
districts to determine the needs of these communities. 
  The program requires that the activities of the patrol 
officers will be monitored constantly to make sure they adjust 
to the needs that arise in the districts where they are working. 
  "The police," said General Pulido, "are willing to do 
whatever is necessary to reach out to each citizen. The police 
officer will get to know the people on his beat and will offer 
them service and friendship." 
  The general explained, however, that this will not be an 
easy 
task, since "we need more men," but he said that if the 
population cooperates with the program, it will become stronger 
and there will be participation. 
  In this regard, the patrol officers assigned to the program 
will participate in police campaigns to encourage courtesy and 
proper treatment to project a new image in the community. 
  The strategy is designed "to respond to people with our 
efforts," stated General Pulido, "helping people solve their 
problems, entertaining children, and showing support for the 
community as it deals with its problems." 
  Under the plan, in each village, municipality, and 
neighborhood in the country there will be a community 
participation office, a clearinghouse for complaints and claims, 
an information office, and a help line that will allow the 
people to voice their concerns. 
<H5>  All for One </H5>
  To further the objectives of the program, the police will 
launch a campaign to involve patrol officers in disaster 
prevention, ecological projects, rescue operations, drug 
addiction prevention, literacy, and child protection. 
  In addition, the officers will be trained to work with the 
community on projects to build schools, rest homes, sports 
centers, housing, and the reconstruction of parks, roads, and 
sewage systems. 
  On another front, the police want to strengthen the Civic 
Police Force to contribute to the development of educational 
efforts to raise people's awareness of basic rules of safety and 
courtesy. 
  "We want the service to be as pure and transparent as 
possible, to make our work visible and get trade unions, 
industrial plants, Indians, black people's associations, 
universities, women's groups, and other social groups involved 
in our work," stated Salgado. 
  The high-ranking official also stated that as the patrol 
officers work in their respective communities, people's trust in 
that institution will be renewed.

  [Text] San Salvador, 30 Mar (ACAN-EFE) -- The ruling 
Nationalist Republican Alliance (ARENA) captured 49.05 percent 
of the votes in the 20 March election, while the leftist 
coalition, partly formed by former guerrillas, garnered 24.9 
percent of the votes. Today, the Salvadoran Supreme Electoral 
Tribunal (TSE) announced that as a result, a runoff election 
will be held. The right-wing ARENA candidate, Armando Calderon 
Sol, fell just short of an absolute majority (over 50 percent of 
the votes). He will face Ruben Zamora, from the leftist 
coalition, in a runoff on 24 April. 
  After 10 days of vote counting, the TSE has announced the 
official election results and has scheduled runoff elections, 
the date for which has already been agreed upon although it will 
be officially announced in 72 hours. Electoral authorities have 
not yet announced official results of legislative and municipal 
elections, also held on 20 March, in which, according to the 
provisional vote count, the two leading groups won percentages 
similar to those in the presidential election. 
  Yesterday Calderon acknowledged he had not won an absolute 
majority and announced his participation in the runoff. This 
despite the fact that while the vote count was still proceeding 
Calderon asked Zamora to withdraw from the runoff and concede 
the election. 
  Zamora was nominated by former guerrillas of the Farabundo 
Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) and by the social 
democratic parties: Democratic Convergence (CD) and the National 
Revolutionary Movement (MNR). 
  According to official presidential election results, ARENA 
won 641,108 votes, which represent 49.05 percent; the leftist 
coalition 325,582 (24.90 percent); and the Christian Democratic 
Party (PDC) 214,277 votes (16.39 percent). The National 
Conciliation Party (conservative) garnered 70,504 votes (5.39 
percent); the Unity Movement (MU, evangelical), 31,502 votes 
(2.41 percent); and the National Solidarity Movement (MSN, 
evangelical) 13,841 votes (1.06 percent). The Authentic 
Christian Movement (MAC, right-wing), which nominated a woman 
for the presidency, Rhina Escalante de Rey Prendes, was unable 
to attract the 1 percent needed to stay alive in the political 
arena and thus will cease to exist as a political party. The 
total number of votes cast in the presidential election was 
1,411,320, of which 4,849 were challenged, 70,503 were annulled, 
and 28,311 were blank. 
  Even though the TSE did not announce official figures for 
abstentionism and even though the total number of eligible 
voters (some 2.5 million) has not been provided due to census 
problems, the provisional vote count placed abstention at around 
45 percent. 
  Jaime Romero Ventura, a TSE magistrate, said that today, 
political parties will be officially notified that a runoff will 
be held so they can resort to any available legal mechanisms. He 
added that according to the law, 72 hours must pass once results 
are announced so any party can appeal before the TSE can 
officially call a runoff in the presidential election. Romero 
Ventura said Easter might delay the announcement until Tuesday, 
the first working day after the holiday, when the TSE would 
announce the results and call a runoff election between ARENA 
and the leftist coalition. 
  The two political forces have already begun campaigning and 
molding alliances with their sights set on 24 April, even though 
the main potential source of additional votes, the PDC, has 
announced it will not support either candidate. Of the smaller 
organizations, the PCN, traditionally linked to the military, 
has already expressed its support for ARENA, an organization 
already favored to win the election. 
  The 20 March elections, witnessed by some 3,000 
international

elections in the country since the 1992 peace agreements between 
the FMLN and the Alfredo Cristiani government, which ended 12 
years of civil war.

  [Text] In one of the first expressions of support in light 
of the upcoming second round of elections, the presidential 
candidate for the National Conciliation Party [PCN] that, 
according to the vote count, came in fourth in the first round 
of elections, has said that his party will support the 
Nationalist Republican Alliance [ARENA]. 
  Colonel Roberto Escobar Garcia, a lawyer and PCN secretary 
general, said yesterday that his party will support ARENA in the 
runoff. Even though the Supreme Electoral Tribunal has not made 
an official announcement, there are indications that it will be 
held on 24 April. 
  According to political observers, ARENA should not pursue an 
alliance in confronting the left in the runoff because it has 
enough strength to defeat all the leftist parties combined. They 
also believe Fidel Chavez Mena does not have the leadership to 
call on the rank and file to vote for ARENA.

  [Text] San Jose, 20 Mar (NOTIMEX) -- Central American 
leaders today praised the designation of Ernesto Zedillo by the 
ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) as candidate for 
the Mexican presidency, replacing Luis Donaldo Colosio. 
Zedillo, a former secretary of planning and budget and of 
public education, was campaign manager for candidate Colosio, 
who was killed last week by two shots in the city of Tijuana, in 
northwestern Mexico. 
  In a statement for NOTIMEX via telephone after learning of 
Zedillo's designation, Guatemalan President Ramiro De Leon 
Carpio called for "strengthening relations with Mexico based on 
respect for sovereignty and self-determination." Meanwhile, 
Obdulio Chinchilla, president of the Finance Commission of the 
Guatemalan Congress, said should Zedillo win the Mexican 
elections on 21 August "there will be an opportunity to 
restructure more dynamic commercial relations with Mexico." 
  In Managua, Nicaraguan President Violeta de Chamorro, 
through 
government spokesman Luis Rivas Leyva, expressed hope that the 
PRI decision will continue maintain the normal course of the 
Mexican electoral process. 
  Panamanian President Guillermo Endara commented in Panama 
City that Zedillo's appointment was "a good selection." 
  Costa Rican Vice President German Serrano Pinto said "Mexico 
has shown it has overcome the recent unfortunate events and 
continues on the democratic path." 
  Nils Castro, one of the vice presidents of the Permanent 
Conference of Latin American Political Parties (COPPPAL) 
expressed his hope that the new presidential candidate "will 
continue the same campaign program and the same government 
platform" as Colosio. 
  In San Salvador, Ren Figueroa, deputy of the ruling 
Nationalist Republican Alliance, said that "we do not doubt 
Zedillo will follow the same path as Colosio, as he was one of 
his closest collaborators." 
  Ciro Cruz Zepeda, secretary general of the Salvadoran 
National Conciliation Party (PCN), said the new PRI presidential 
candidate "is the best man" to assume that responsibility.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 24 Mar (EFE) -- Brazilian Foreign 
Minister Celso Amorim has assured his Argentine counterpart 
Guido Di Tella that Brazil will exceed its commitment to 
purchase a minimum of 2 million tonnes of wheat from Argentina 
during 1994. 
  In a note sent yesterday and disseminated today, 24 March, 
Amorim reiterated his government's willingness to maintain 
regular contacts with Argentine officials to follow up 
developments on wheat imports. 
  Amorim added that the Brazilian Foreign Trade Secretariat is 
investigating Brazilian wheat purchases from Canada and Germany 
in terms of GATT provisions concerning "dumping" and subsidies. 
  Amorim described the imports of Argentine wheat as 
"strategic" for the implementation of the Program for 
Integration and Cooperation developed by the two countries since 
1986. 
  Amorim said that Brazilian mills "were the first to 
acknowledge that the purchase of Argentine wheat is more 
advantageous in light of tariff reductions provided under the 
Common Market of the South (Mercosur), the exemption of other 
duties, and lower freight costs stemming from the fact that 
Argentina and Brazil are neighbors." 
  Amorim noted that the estimated amount of wheat Brazil will 
have to import this harvest year to meet domestic needs stands 
at 5.6 million tonnes.

  [Text] We have a report from our agency, the Fides News 
Agency, on Carmelo Meco Dominguez' testimony that we think our 
listeners should hear. 
  The U.S. Embassy and the DEA tried to involve former 
President Jaime Paz Zamora in drug trafficking in 1990 by 
violently torturing Carmelo Meco Dominguez, seeking to force him 
to incriminate the MIR [Movement of the Revolutionary Left] 
leadership in trafficking activities. 
  This revelation was made public yesterday when MIR Deputy 
Mario Rueda Pena released a tape of a recorded voluntary 
declaration by Meco Dominguez at the La Paz Departmental Command 
of the Special Antinarcotics Force on 1 October 1990. 
  Meco says in his voluntary deposition that a few days before 
1 October he was kidnapped from his home by U.S. agents who 
tortured him violently, seeking to get him to accuse the 
then-President Jaime Paz Zamora and other MIR leaders of 
involvement in drug trafficking. 
  Could this be just a show organized by the DEA with 
information obtained through torture? It is a very serious 
accusation. Legislators should ask Meco Dominguez during his 
testimony at the Chamber of Deputies this afternoon if the 
accusations against Jaime Paz Zamora were obtained through 
torture. The press must report everything. We do not want 
stories here, and least of all stories about gringos who torture 
people. Do you not agree? They can torture in their country if 
they want, but not in ours.

  [Text] Frantz Robert Monde, president of the Chamber of 
Deputies, rejects the U.S. [peace plan] proposal. Monde points 
out that the lower chamber is sticking to the resolution passed 
on 3 March. Frantz Robert Monde had invited the U.S. ambassador 
to meet with him on Tuesday, 29 March, to inform the ambassador 
on the position of the Chamber of Deputies. Let us listen to 
Monde, interviewed after his meeting with U.S. Ambassador 
William Lacy Swing: 
  [Begin recording] [Monde] I explained to the American 
ambassador that I was a legislator. I took a position on a 
crisis concerning my country, and it is out of the question for 
the Haitian parliament to submit to a plan presented by certain 
American lawmakers. 
  The ambassador tried to explain to me that it is the concept 
of democracy in this country that prompted lawmakers to work on 
a plan. I gave him to understand that I too had worked on a 
plan, and the parliament will not accept any pressure from any 
other parliament or other legislators; we have learned that a 
country can not live in isolation, but I have also learned that 
a country's sovereignty can not be trampled underfoot, 
particularly the prestige and dignity of the Haitian parliament. 
  As for another plan, it is a Black Caucus affair. It does 
not 
concern the Haitian legislators. I even told Senator Dodd 
yesterday that if Father Aristide elicits such admiration from 
so many great men within the U.S. Congress, they can just elect 
him to be the president of the U.S. Congress. 
  [Unidentified reporter] This other plan is allegedly being 
prepared by the State Department? 
  [Monde] That is the State Department's concern, not the 
Haitians' concern. The State Department has already conceived 
other plans for Haiti. The plans did not succeed. The [Haitian] 
legislators took the matter in hand. We prepared a plan; we are 
sticking to it, and this plan, its conception, was not 
influenced by either Aristide or the Army. This plan must be 
implemented, or what must be done will be done. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] On 29 March, the Coordinating Committee for 
National Mobilization presented the text of a resolution 
opposing Aristide to parliament. This resolution was handed over 
to the office of the lower chamber and to the unofficial office 
of the Upper Chamber. Hubert De Ronceray [leader of the 
Mobilization for National Development], Gabriel Augustin [leader 
of the Assembly of Democrats for the Republic], Rony Durand, and 
Herve Leveille [of the Group of Citizens of the Greater North, 
CCGN] are the principal members of this delegation demanding 
that parliamentarians either reactivate Article 149 or form an 
ad hoc government. 
  A member of the delegation told Signal FM that the office of 
the lower chamber has promised to give a ruling on this 
resolution soon. Rony Durand demands a Haitian solution to the 
crisis. The delegation and the office of the lower chamber met 
in camera. [passage omitted] 
  Herve Leveille of CCGN expects a positive response to their 
request from the parliamentarians. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] On 23 March [as heard], leaders representing the 
Mobilization for National Development, the Front for Haitian 
Advancement and Progress, the National Conference, and the 
Congress of Haitian People for National Rescue met in 
Port-au-Prince and voted for a joint resolution enjoining 
parliament to conform to the following 
obligations: 

  -  Formally acknowledge Jean-Bertrand Aristide's 
deliberate refusal to appoint a prime minister; 
  -  Acknowledge the 
presidential vacuum; 
  -  Implement Article 149 of the Constitution 
by forming an ad hoc government to function under these 
exceptional circumstances; and 
  -  In case of nonexecution of the 
three aforementioned demands, bow to a national act of public 
power establishing an ad hoc government. 
  This resolution was to be officially delivered to the 
parliament on 29 March. Meanwhile, the Coordinating Committee 
for National Mobilization continues consultations with all of 
the country's sectors as a demonstration of support for the 
formation of the new government. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Communique issued by the government in Guatemala City on 30 </F>
March] 
  [Text] The Guatemalan Government reports given the crimes 
that occurred in San Cristobal Verapaz on 29 March 1994: 
  1. That after having completed initial investigations and 
judicial proceedings, it is evident that certain residents of 
San Cristobal Verapaz acted criminally and very seriously 
injured U.S. citizen (June Diane Weinstock), who was in that 
region as a tourist. 
  They also seriously injured the judge, officials, 
administrative justice of the peace personnel, and members of 
the national media, the Red Cross, the Firefighters Corps, and 
public force personnel stationed in that region. In addition, 
judicial files were damaged. This has undoubtedly undermined the 
interests and human rights of hundreds of people who have been 
or are being prosecuted in that jurisdiction. 
  2. The Guatemalan Government, based on the spontaneous 
testimony of countless residents of that place, recognizes the 
innocence and honorability of the U.S. citizen, who was brutally 
attacked, and assumes responsiblity for the medical attention 
that her situation may require. The same treatment will be 
granted to fellow citizens whose condition warrants it. The 
government vigorously condemns this violent act. 
  3. The action of these groups is reflected in the 
dissemination of unfounded rumors and appearance of graffiti 
[legendas] in the country's towns and highways that link 
innocent U.S. citizens to the stealing of and trafficking in 
minors. The apparent goal of this is to create an atmosphere of 
insecurity and instability in the country. 
  4. This provocation seeks to jeopardize Guatemala's 
relations with friendly nations. 
  5. The government appeals to the public, urging people 
not to be deceived by the propagation of groundless rumors and 
the manipulation of inexact and biased information aimed at 
creating an atmosphere of social unrest. It states that it will 
not tolerate individual or group actions perpetrated with the 
intention of taking the law into their own hands. It pledges to 
strictly enforce existing laws against those who commit these 
crimes.

  [Text] According to the last vote count at the closing of 
this edition, the Institutionalist Encounter Movement 
[Movimiento Institucionalista Encuentrista] (MIE), of the 
so-called ruling faction headed by Oscar Codas, won the National 
Encounter [EN] internal elections on 27 March. The Progressive 
Convergence Front [Frente de Convergencia Progresista, FCP] 
headed by Deputy Luis A. Mauro came in second, the New Society 
[NS] faction headed by Carlos Martini came in third, and the 
Democratic Alliance [AD] faction headed by Basilio Nikiphoroff 
came in last. 
  Seventy-two percent of voting tables had been counted by 
midnight. The partial results continued to show who the clear 
winner of the EN internal elections held nationwide on 27 March 
was. The vote count gave the MIE 52.6 percent of the votes, 
followed by the FCP with 22.5 percent, the NS with 10.6 percent; 
and the AD with 8.7 percent. 
  In a relatively calm atmosphere, other than some charges of 
irregularities in the voter registration lists, the EN elected 
the members of the party board, the coordinating board, 
grass-roots delegates, and district coordinators. With the MIE's 
victory, the ruling EN faction reasserted its hegemony both in 
the capital and the country's interior by a wide margin over its 
opponents. For its part, the FCP, headed by Deputy Luis Alberto 
Mauro, came in second before the NS headed by Febrerista 
Revolutionary Party [PRF] leader Carlos Martini. 
  Contrary to the atmosphere that prevailed during the last 
part of the election campaign (marked by strong accusations 
among the movements), no conflicts took place on 27 March beyond 
the usual complaints about the voters lists. 
  With an electorate that concentrates 68 percent of its 
potential in the metropolitan area, the leaders of the several 
factions that ran for election on 27 March agreed in pointing 
out that from now on the EN's main challenge is to gain time. 
  It must be pointed out that the participation rate in the 
elections ranged from 35 to 40 percent. Attendance was more 
enthusiastic in the metropolitan area than in the interior, 
where the greatest absentee rates where registered.

  [Text] Lima, 30 Mar (EFE) -- Four people were injured 
today, two seriously, in downtown Lima during a bomb attack by 
the Maoist Shining Path gang against an Entelperu [National 
Telecommunications Enterprise of Peru] office that was yet to be 
inaugurated. 
  Sources at the hospital where the victims were treated said 
the bomb injured two peddlers, one of whom lost an arm, who were 
sleeping on the street near the targeted office. The other two 
victims were an Entelperu guard and a pedestrian who lost an 
eye. The bomb was in a black bag that had been planted by two 
women. 
  On the night of 28 March, Shining Path members planted 
explosives at four banks, three offices of the Telefonica 
company, and two Entelperu offices, the latter two companies 
were recently purchased by the Spanish Telefonica Internacional 
company for $2.002 billion. Shining Path terrorists also 
attacked a Navy facility and knocked down three power pylons in 
a Lima district causing some short, sporadic blackouts in the 
city.

<F P=106> [Article by Jaime Mejia Mazuera] </F>
  [Text] Not all is lost in the current oil price crisis. The 
Colombian Petroleum Enterprise (Ecopetrol) has found a way to 
profit from the situation by exploring deals that go beyond 
merely selling crude oil abroad. 
  Last Monday, the Office of the Vice President for Sales of 
the oil company managed to close a deal in Trinidad-Tobago that 
yielded a profit of $1 million: In exchange for 500,000 barrels 
of oil, it will receive 200,000 barrels of processed products 
(gasoline, kerosene, and others). 
  In this way, the oil company is marketing finished products 
rather than crude oil, following a very obvious economic 
strategy: As long as crude prices are on the decline, gasolines 
and other derivatives can fetch better and better prices. 
  The current winter season in the United States and Europe 
has 
contributed to the increase in demand for fuels, and therefore 
prices are very attractive for producers. 
  And there are better prospects ahead. In countries with 
seasons, the so-called "driving season" is approaching. This is 
a time when Americans travel on the highways, and fuel 
consumption increases notably. 
  As a result, Ecopetrol has decided to look for mechanisms 
that will enable it to take advantage of what the fuels market 
offers. 
  After the Trinidad-Tobago transaction, the oil company 
expects to negotiate similar deals in the gulf of the United 
States (the country's west coast), where the principal 
refineries in the world are located. They have a refining 
capacity of 15 million barrels per day. 
<H5>  Change in Strategy </H5>
  How will the deal work? The oil company contracts with a 
foreign refinery to process crude, and in exchange, it receives 
a given quantity of products such as gasolines for cars, 
airplanes, and boats. 
  In this way, the company gets a profit margin it would not 
get if it sold the oil directly on the major commodities markets 
of the world. 
  Why? While a barrel of high-quality oil currently sells for 
less than $14, gasoline can sell for $18 or $19. 
  The conclusion for Ecopetrol is simple: Whatever it pays to 
have the fuel refined can be recouped, and ultimately it is 
better off selling the fuel in processed form. 
  Of course, 100 barrels of petroleum does not yield 100 
barrels of gasoline. Everything depends on the refineries' 
conversion capacity. The best plants can achieve an 85-percent 
conversion, that is, 85 barrels of gasoline for every 100 
barrels of crude. 
  According to Ecopetrol officials consulted by EL TIEMPO, 
however, this type of transaction can be profitable for the 
company and can boost revenues at a time when the crude market 
is depressed, but looks like it will improve in the next few 
months. 
  The next step is the futures market. Very soon, all oil 
transactions will be protected against any sharp change in 
prices. Thus, crude will be sold for delivery in two to six 
months at a predetermined price. If the price falls, the company 
is compensated by the financial institution that insured the 
sale.

<F P=106> [Report by Lucia Perez Moreno] </F>
  [Text] Athens, 29 Mar (NOTIMEX) -- Belize today abandoned 
the 10th Central American and European Union [EU] Foreign 
Ministers' Meeting after Greece, the host country, withdrew its 
observer status. 
  The incident occurred after the Guatemalan delegation asked 
Theodoros Pangalos, current chairman of the European Council of 
Ministers, to withdraw Belize's status as observer at the 
ministerial meeting. 
  "Belize's participation in the San Jose meetings will depend 
on the context of negotiations on the territorial dispute," it 
was stated to NOTIMEX by Guatemalan Foreign Minister Gladys 
Marithza Ruiz de Vielman. 
  Guatemala and Belize established diplomatic relations in 
1981, although the two countries have yet to settle a 
territorial dispute. 
  "We were invited by the council's chairman. We do not 
consider this the place to discuss differences between Guatemala 
and Belize," said Ursula Brown, Belize's ambassador to the 
United Kingdom, shortly before her departure. 
  A participant in the meeting said Greece made "a mistake in 
formalities" when it invited Belize as an observer without first 
consulting with the Central American country. 
  The problem arose when the Belizean representative stood 
close to the EU and Central American foreign ministers when 
posing for a group picture of the meeting, which is currently 
being held at an elegant hotel on the outskirts of the Greek 
capital. 
  Belize, with a population of 200,000, achieved its 
independence from the United Kingdom in 1986, and Guatemala has 
demanded the return of part of their common border since then. 
  Although Belize had been invited to participate as an 
observer in other international forums on Central America, this 
was the first time it had been invited to participate in the San 
Jose Summit.

    [Editorial report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on developments related to El Salvador's run-off 
elections scheduled for 24 April 1994. 
  Dr. Ruben Zamora, presidential candidate of the Democratic 
Convergence coalition, said at the Presidente Hotel on 29 March 
that, if the presidential run-off elections are to be held on 24 
April, the Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE] must correct all of 
the mistakes made on 20 March to make the process legitimate. 
Zamora said: "As the coalition's presidential candidate, my 
position is that it is necessary, even essential, to make 
changes in the electoral process in order that it makes sense to 
hold the second round." Zamora decried the irregularities that 
took place on 20 March, which, he said, prevented thousands of 
Salvadorans from voting. He and his coalition have presented a 
list of 11 things to the TSE that need to be changed in the 
second round. He regretted that so far the TSE has failed to 
respond. (San Salvador Radio Cadena YSU in Spanish 1800 GMT 29 
Mar 94) 
  On 29 March, Armando Calderon Sol, presidential candidate of 
the Nationalist Republican Alliance, accused the FMLN [Farabundo 
Marti National Liberation Front] of delaying the final vote 
count for the 20 March elections. He attributed the FMLN's 
slowness to its lack of electoral experience and asked the party 
to step up the final count. Calderon Sol said: "I am hereby 
expressing my dissatisfaction over the slowness with which 
members of the FMLN are conducting the final vote count. I know 
they lack experience and I know this is their first election 
following their recent induction into the Salvadoran political 
and democratic process. This does not mean, however, that they 
should have doubts and lack the resolve to abide by the law."

  [Text] Guatemala City, 31 Mar (NOTIMEX) -- Today, the 
National Police reported that U.S. citizen Duncan Miller Aykena 
was wounded by unidentified individuals, who shot at him from a 
moving vehicle on a street in the Guatemalan capital. The report 
adds that Miller Aykena was taken to a medical center after he 
had been shot four times; his condition is critical. 
  The National Police did not rule out that the attack is the 
result of the psychosis that exists in Guatemala due to the 
"wave" of child kidnappings. The people believe these 
kidnappings are carried out by gangs composed of mostly U.S. 
citizens. 
  This past week in the countryside, two U.S. tourists, one 
reporter, and two seismologists were attacked, as well as one 
Swiss geologist. The Guatemalan Government has already condemned 
the violence against foreigners while it has asked all 
Guatemalans for calm as well as respect toward the tourists. 
  Meanwhile, Government Minister Danilo Parinello assured that 
the possibility of imposing a state of emergency is being 
studied. This would limit the constitutional guarantees of more 
than 10 million Guatemalans. Parinello added: "The violent and 
criminal actions against foreigners must stop, otherwise a state 
of emergency could be decreed." 
  Meanwhile, the U.S. Government has already advised tourists 
"not to travel to Guatemala," in light of a possible attack that 
could result in death. The Attorney General's Office confirmed 
that so far this year almost 66 reports of missing or kidnapped 
children in Guatemala have been filed.

  [Text] Tegucigalpa, 30 Mar (NOTIMEX) -- President Carlos 
Roberto Reina's government, which came to power last January, 
has announced new gasoline, diesel, and kerosene prices will go 
into effect beginning today. Super gasoline, which cost 8.66 
lempiras per gallon ($1.10), increased to 10.10 lempiras (a $.20 
increase), and regular gasoline went from 7.44 lempiras ($.98) 
per gallon to 9.49 lempiras, a $.35 increase. Diesel prices rose 
$.70. Kerosene, used by the poor, 70 percent of the Honduran 
people, increased from 2.97 lempiras ($.40) to 5.28 lempiras 
($.75). Prices for cooking gas also increased. 
  According to the Economy Ministry's official communique, the 
new price structure "does not seek to adversely affect the 
low-income sector." The communique stated it is "impossible" for 
the government to continue subsidizing fuel prices because in 
February it represented losses of 20 million lempiras, some $2.5 
million. 
  Adolfo Facusse, president of the Honduran Council for 
Private 
Enterprise, said if fuel prices decrease internationally, a fuel 
price increase in the entire country cannot be justified. "This 
will lead to an increase in the inflation rate we are 
experiencing, which is regrettable," Facusse has said. Luis 
Salgado, vice president of the National Transportation Council, 
has said the fuel price increase announced today will also lead 
to an increase in bus fares.

  [Text] Tegucigalpa -- Congress has sent most government 
secretariats a document that resembles a government plan. The 
document includes recommendations, and it reviews issues that 
range from exerting financial control over decentralized 
institutions to eliminating the Finance Police. 
  The document, which bears the number 96-94/SCN, is dated 22 
February, and a copy of it was provided to TIEMPO in Congress. 
The document contains the text of a motion approved by the 
legislative body regarding a total of 41 recommendations on 
various issues. The document also conveys claims being made by 
National Congress President Carlos Flores Facusse regarding a 
government plan. 
  The official note was sent to the members of the economic 
cabinet and the Government Secretariat to enable its 
recommendations "to be considered in the Economic and 
Administrative Action Plan that will be prepared by the 
executive branch and be presented to the National Congress." 
  The recommendations include resuming the practice of 
verifying all invoices in the Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula 
offices; extending the practice to La Ceiba, Puerto Cortes, 
Santa Rosa de Copan, Danli, and Choluteca; and gradually 
establishing this practice in cities with a slower commercial 
pace. The reestablishment of the fiscal lottery also has been 
suggested. 
  Another proposal involves "placing more emphasis on 
recovering pending debts to the state by clamping down on 
defaulters by way of lawsuits; not handing over goods without 
prior payment of import duties; and suspending vehicle permits 
for Hondurans and alien residents who fail to pay import duties 
and license fees, with the exception of tourists who can prove 
their transient status." 
  Other recommendations include effectively preventing the 
underpricing of imports and exports, establishing administrative 
and criminal sanctions for offenders, and maintaining special 
control over the smuggling of goods and the introduction of 
tax-exempt vehicles, as well as the obvious underpricing of 
shrimp exports to the United States. It is also recommended that 
a modern computer system be created in combination with the 
Honduran Central Bank to control the authorization and use of 
foreign exchange and prices on exports and imports to guarantee 
the correct settlement of customs papers. The installation of 
electronic guages to keep a tangible record of the production of 
fuels as well as the production of alcohol and spirits, and to 
establish a computerized system to estimate the oil differential 
[diferencial petrolero]. Another suggestion is to conduct 
administrative audits of the current transactions involved in 
exporting coffee to determine the extent of compliance and to 
protect fiscal interests in accordance with current laws and 
regulations. 
  Although Liberal Party deputies are killing themselves to 
find supporters in customs, in the document they urge "the 
recruitment of capable and qualified personnel into the 
country's Customs Division to bring under control the high 
degree of tax evasion resulting from the underpricing of goods 
and excessive appraisals at the moment the settlement of papers 
takes place." The document adds, "a law against contraband and 
tax evasion should be approved with harsher penalties than the 
current ones for offenders, the Finance Police should be 
eliminated, and a computerized accounting system to verify the 
entry and exit of consumer goods in the country should be 
sought." 
  Another suggestion is to exercise control over revenues 
earned by the national press and similar organizations, such as 
agricultural schools that earn money through sales related to 
agricultural-livestock services. Additional recommendations 
include exerting financial control over the Honduran 
Telecommunications Enterprise, the Honduran Corporation for 
Forest Development, and the National Children's Board to 
determine the amount of revenues, expenditures, and investments; 
examine the financial situation of the National Agricultural 
Development Bank; and issue strong measures with the cooperation 
of the judicial branch to ban games of chance.

  [Text] The big news on the political and economic level is 
the Americans' warning, who are trying to strengthen the embargo 
against Haiti, especially as regards fuel. This time there is 
talk of tightening the sanctions at the Haitian-Dominican 
frontier. Rothschild Francois Jr. filed a report: 
  [Begin Francois recording] A high-ranking U.S. 
Administration 
official has said: The United States is studying an option to 
strengthen sanctions against Haiti by discussing with the 
Dominican Republic ways of preventing the embargo from being 
by-passed with regards to oil. This official, who asked to 
remain anonymous, also said in Coronado, California, where 
President Bill Clinton is on vacation, that exiled President 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide has not yet told Washington his position 
on the new U.S. plan aimed at allowing him to return to power. 
  The official reminded that this plan is a combination of 
strong sanctions to exert pressure on the current regime and a 
political process in Haiti that must help create conditions for 
a full return to democracy. He added: During the past few days, 
we have discussed with the Dominican Republic how we can 
reinforce the sanctions and reduce fuel trafficking through its 
Haitian land border and by sea. Those discussions went pretty 
well, continued the U.S. official. [end recording] 
  Moreover, the official said Jean-Bertrand Aristide had not 
personally and officially informed the U.S. administration his 
position on the new plan aimed at allowing him to return to 
power. Remember that in a press release on 28 March, the exiled 
president insisted on the need for the military to resign as the 
first step of a peace plan for Haiti. The U.S. initiative 
provides for the simultaneous appointment of a new prime 
minister and resignation by Haiti's current government, meaning 
the military authorities, who would be given amnesty. 
  The high-ranking U.S. official added: The United States 
tried, through this new plan, to satisfy some of President 
Aristide's concerns, and we are going to work with him on it. 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide seems to fear that the political process 
in question might become an alternative to his return to Haiti, 
but that was never what we had in mind, said the U.S. official.

  [Text] Bernard Sansaricq, president of the [unofficial] 
Senate Office, says the Senate will analyze the proposal of the 
political leaders delegation headed by Hubert De Ronceray. On 29 
March, the [Coordinating] Committee for National Mobilization 
submitted a resolution to the Senate from those opposed to 
Aristide asking that Article 149 of the Haitian Constitution be 
implemented. Mobilization for National Development leader Hubert 
de Ronceray has stated that, should the parliament fail to 
follow up on this request, an ad hoc government will be formed. 
  Sansaricq intends to gather the senators, or at least the 
members of the Alliance [for Parliamentary Cohesion] and the 
parliamentarians who were elected on 18 January, to discuss the 
issue. 
  [Begin Sansaricq recording] The conversation, which lasted 
nearly an hour, was very cordial. We took note of the text that 
was submitted to us by this delegation, and we hasten to inform 
the public that this resolution will be submitted to the members 
of the Senate for approval as soon as possible, disregarding the 
formality regarding three full days mentioned in the text of the 
resolution. 
  At this crucial moment in the national life, the Senate of 
the Republic is willing to look into, examine any and all 
resolutions aimed at bringing about a reasonable solution to the 
serious crisis the nation is experiencing. [end recording]

  [Text] Chamber of Deputies President Frantz Robert Monde is 
threatening to appoint a prime minister if President-in-exile 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide persists in refusing to do so. According 
to the president of the lower chamber, it is a constitutional 
duty, and we must think of endowing the country with a 
government within the next few days, with or without President 
Aristide's approval. We are two months away from elections in 
the Dominican Republic. These threaten to be stormy. Various 
political sectors demand that the institutional vacuum be 
filled. The Chamger of Deputies president said it is necessary 
to consider the measures to be taken so this vacuum can be 
filled by President Aristide as soon as possible. In case 
President Aristide's refuses, we have prepared a parliamentary 
plan to solve the crisis and we are sticking to it, he pointed 
out, adding that patience has its limits. 
  It should be noted, however, that the president of the lower 
chamber has remained aloof from the resolution bill submitted on 
29 March by a coalition of political parties calling for the 
formation of an ad hoc government. Edner Jean filed a report: 
  [Begin recording] [Jean] President Aristide's categorical 
refusal to appoint a new prime minister is putting Frantz Robert 
Monde's nerves to the test. My patience has limits, he said 
angrily in the presence of the journalists who were questioning 
him on the future of the parliamentary plan in comparison with 
new steps proposed by Washington. It should be noted that until 
now, Frantz Robert Monde had developed and maintained a 
consensus around him, with the result of a more-or-less normal 
running of the Chamber of Deputies. In the face of the political 
caprices of the president of the Republic, however, the deputy 
from Anse-a-Veau is threatening to give up his role as 
arbitrator to return to his camp, which is opposed to Aristide's. 
  We must think of endowing the country with a government 
within the next few days, with or without President Aristide's 
approval, stated the president of the lower chamber. The 
upcoming elections in the Dominican Republic can only reinforce 
concerns, but also the determination of President Monde. 
  [Monde] We are two months away from elections in the 
Dominican Republic, which threaten to be very stormy. The 
institutional vacuum is tempting to the political sectors. Those 
sectors on the political scene are demanding that this 
institutional vacuum be filled, that measures must be considered 
as soon as possible so this institutional vacuum can be filled 
by President Aristide. It is a constitutional duty not linked to 
any conditions. We must make him understand that patience has 
its limits. We have prepared a plan. We will stick to it. This 
plan was inspired in its conception and was not influenced by 
either Aristide or the Army. This plan must be executed or what 
must be done will be done. 
  [Jean] Frantz Robert Monde is losing patience. He refuses to 
be tempted, however, by new political adventures. Since the 
beginning of his mandate, the president of the lower chamber has 
known how to cleverly avoid efforts of the Group of Citizens of 
the Greater North with its Government of Public Safety; the ad 
hoc government of CARENA [Action Committee for National 
Reconciliation]; as well as the application of Article 149 of 
the Constitution, advocated by MDN [Mobilization for National 
Development] and FRAPH [Front for Haitian Advancement and 
Progress]. These political formations, rallying within the 
Coordination Committee for National Mobilization, are renewing 
their attack, and have submitted a resolution integrating their 
various proposals to parliament. Here again, President Monde is 
very cautious and expresses reservations. 
  [Monde] Having a new government is not going to relieve the 
misery of the people. It is not going to reverse the instability 
of our institutions, the degradation of the social level of the 
Haitian people. What I am primarily interested in now is any 
solution that can contribute to the improvement of the living 
conditions of the people and defend my country's interests. 
  [Unidentified reporter] You gave a deadline of next 
Wednesday. 
  [Monde] I do not receive deadlines from anyone. Any solution 
that is not aimed at lifting the sanctions has no viable chance 
of defending this country's interests. 
  [Jean] To this, one can add that Frantz Robert Monde has 
always stated that he would be the last to leave his office if 
parliament is attacked. This obviously remains to be proven.

  [Text] Leon (Mexico), 31 Mar (EFE) -- Today, authorities 
reported that nine people were injured during a Molotov cocktail 
attack allegedly executed by members of the Leftist 
Revolutionary Movement (MIR) [Movimiento de Izquierda 
Revolucionaria] in Leon, Guanajuato, central Mexico. The attack, 
which occurred yesterday afternoon, has left more than 50 people 
homeless because it started a fire that destroyed 13 houses. 
  Local police reported the reasons for the incident are still 
undetermined, but witnesses say two men called Arturo Andrade 
and Rito Duran, MIR leaders, were the ones who threw the bombs. 
Area residents said this is not the first time the alleged 
culprits have attacked the area with explosives. Five years ago, 
the residents say, those people also threw bombs at them because 
they refused to pay a cooperation quota to their organization. 
The attack was apparently aimed against the house of Maria 
Guadalupe Perez, a former MIR member who decided to leave that 
organization a few months ago. MIR is an ultra-left political 
organization that emerged in the past decade and has influence 
in several states in central Mexico. MIR has not openly declared 
itself an armed group.

<F P=106> [Report by Rosie Awatsin from the "ACIR Radio News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Today, Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, PRI 
[Institutional Revolutionary Party] presidential candidate, 
carried out only one official engagement and met with leaders of 
the Confederation of Mexican Workers [CTM]. 
  CTM Secretary General Fidel Velasquez Sanchez said it is 
time 
to recuperate the time lost from the election campaign. The CTM 
leader indicated that Luis Donaldo Colosio's death was 
unquestionably a wily crime, but we must all forge ahead and 
redouble our efforts in order to emerge triumphant. The workers 
leader was clear when he stated: We are not here to merely 
congratulate you, but also to wish you success. We are going to 
work in the campaign to ensure the party's victory. 
  [Begin Velasquez recording] We do not expect to merely 
congratulate you on your designation. We want to wish you 
success. For our part, we would like to promise you that through 
our unity and discipline, which have always been main traits of 
this organization, we expect to carry out all sorts of endeavors 
to.... [end recording, in progress] 
  Fidel Velasquez Sanchez also referred to the position the 
workers union plans to adopt with respect to workers union 
representatives being nominated as candidates to federal 
deputies and senators. He indicated: We only aspire to 
maintain the number of representatives we currently have and to 
reclaim those positions we negotiated six years ago with other 
political parties. 
  The CTM leader also complained to the PRI candidate that the 
governors intend to impose the names of those candidates running 
for deputies and senators. In this respect, he said: They are 
our friends, but they do not represent us. 
  In replying to the workers demands, PRI candidate Enrique 
Zedillo Ponce de Leon was clear when he said that Luis Donaldo 
Colosio was emphatic in his political offer when he referred to 
his eagerness to ensure material and social progress for Mexico. 
Zedillo stressed that he expects to honor Colosio's commitments. 
  [Begin Zedillo recording, in progress] ...members of your 
organizations. During these assemblies, meetings, Luis Donaldo 
Colosio adopted some very concrete commitments. I would like to 
clearly reassure you, Mr. Fidel Velasquez, that I will fully 
respect Luis Donaldo Colosio's commitments to the CTM and all 
its affiliates. [end recording] 
  Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon also indicated the need to 
translate economic progress into greater possibilities of 
employment, wages, and, of course, a better social security 
system for the workers.

<F P=106> [Report by Rebecca Sanchez Fernandez from the "Early </F>
Morning" newscast] 
  [Text] This Wednesday, the Federal Electoral Institute 
[IFE] General Council received Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon's 
documents requesting his accreditation as PRI [Institutional 
Revolutionary Party] presidential candidate replacing Luis 
Donaldo Colosio. The formal request presented to the IFE 
includes documents attesting the PRI National Executive 
Committee's unanimous decision for Ernesto Zedillo for the 
1994-2000 period. The accreditation request was presented to the 
IFE General Council so this institute can issue an opinion 
during its next extraordinary session. On the other hand, 
Ernesto Zedillo announced that he plans to coordinate his own 
political campaign. 
  Early yesterday morning, Fidel Velasquez Sanchez, leader of 
the Confederation of Mexican Workers [CTM] went to the PRI 
national headquarters to express his support to the new 
presidential candidate. Mr. Ernesto Zedillo reiterated his 
decision to honor the commitments with the labor sector adopted 
by Luis Donaldo Colosio. 
  [Begin Zedillo recording, in progress] ...I fully expect to 
honor the commitments agreed by Luis Donaldo Colosio and the CTM 
as well as its affiliates. [applause] I would like to be 
considered a supporter of the Mexican workers in order to 
safeguard their demands and to be their staunchest ally in 
defending their accomplishments. [end recording] 
  During an impromptu event, the PRI presidential candidate 
headed to the PRI press room and met with the numerous 
journalists following everything that has taken place. Zedillo 
thanked them for attending and reiterated his absolute respect 
for freedom of the press. He also referred to his presidential 
campaign and indicated that the starting date had not been 
decided yet. 
  [Begin Zedillo recording] I would like to say that so far, 
everything related to coordinating the campaign will fall 
directly under my supervision. I was doing this same type of 
job for Mr. Luis Donaldo Colosio, and we had developed a 
strategy he had previously approved and enriched with his own 
suggestions and great experience. I plan to follow with that 
same campaign plan. [end recording] 
  Later, Zedillo received a telephone call from Colombian 
President Cesar Gaviria congratulating him on his nomination. 
They agreed that Colombia and Mexico are united in their desire 
to ensure the Bolivarian ideal of a more prosperous and 
undivided America.

  [Text] At the time they welcomed Ernesto Zedillo into the 
electoral campaign as PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] 
presidential candidate, the Socialist People's Party [PPS] and 
the Mexican Democratic Party [PDM] said they hope Zedillo will 
stick to the agreements signed by Luis Donaldo Colosio. 
  [Begin recording] [PPS Deputy Leader Cuauthemoc Amezcua] We 
hope he will make a great and responsible effort to follow up 
and fulfill the democratic agreements signed by eight political 
parties. 
  [PDM President Marcelo Gaxiola] Dr. Zedillo's taking up 
Colosio's banner and making a public commitment to follow the 
same course should be hailed and regarded as positive. [end 
recording] 
  Both the PPS and PDM coincided by saying evidently, the new 
PRI candidate is at a disadvantage in relation to the other 
candidates and that, for this reason, he must make a greater 
effort to catch up and recover lost time.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, presidential </F>
candidate for the Mexican Institutional Revolutionary Party, and 
his wife by an unidentified reporter at the Zedillo home in 
Mexico City; date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Zedillo] Well, we are a normal family, nothing 
special. We are a very united family as I am certain all 
Mexican families are. We love each other very much. We have 
been married for many years; we got married very young. We have 
been married for almost 20 years; our 20th anniversary will be 
in May. My wife has always been at my side, giving me her 
support in everything. I would like to tell you that we met 
when we were students; she was also an economics student. She 
was my student. In the first class I taught at the Higher 
Economics School, she was my student. I must confess, however, 
that before she was my student she was my girlfriend, we had met 
before. Fortunately, she was in the first group I was assigned 
at the school. 
  She has done everything with me. When we went to study in 
the 
United States, she gave me a great deal of support. These were 
times of hard work, of big challenges. She has always been at 
my side encouraging me to make a big effort. She has supported 
me during my whole career. She has not only been a wife; she 
has been my friend, and many times she has been my adviser, this 
is very comforting. Above all, she made a decision many years 
ago. She was a very good student but she put set aside her 
profession to do this. The family you see here, these five 
children who we love very much are the reason for our existence. 
She left behind her profession to build something that for both 
of us represents a great deal of happiness, that is, these 
children. 
  We are a normal family, we are not anything special and this 
is what makes us a family like any other. We participate 
together in many activities, within many time constraints. You 
mentioned sports. Well, this is known because my sons Ernesto, 
Emiliano, Carlos, and I are members of a mountain bicycle club. 
We practice or we attempt to practice this with some 
regularity. This is why we are seen riding around on bicycles. 
  Something that characterizes Mexicans is that the family 
concept is not limited to the immediate family, parents and 
children. We have what is called an extended family. Three 
years ago we went to Colima -- my wife is from Colima -- where a 
family reunion was held as practically all her family resides 
there. The number of people assembled was impressive; the number 
of cousins and uncles. This really appeared to be a political 
meeting; which in fact we did turn it into as we had invited the 
then candidate for Colima governor. He was impressed to see so 
many people from one family. 
  [Reporter] So you have many votes in the family? 
  [Zedillo] Well, yes; I hope they will vote for me. I have to 
make sure, I will have to conduct an effective campaign among 
the family members, right? I hope all of them will help me in 
that respect. 
  [Mrs. Zedillo] Ernesto said something that I appreciate. He 
said I was a good student. The truth is that I enjoyed economics 
very much. There are some subjects that I like very much. I 
believe that by being at home, I have had the opportunity to 
read. Now, I like literature, history. I think a housewife does 
not have to separate herself from such things as learning. When 
I had my children, I had to quit working, but I like it. Staying 
at home is also a profession. It takes some effort, it entails 
much devotion, and one must be determined to do it. I like it, 
that is why I did it. 
  I come from the provinces, and early in the century, 
families 
were very large in the provinces. My father comes from a family 
of 11 brothers and sisters, and so does my mother, and there are 
all of their cousins. It is a large family. Ernesto also comes 
from a large family. Of course, they will help us.

  [Text] 
<H5>  State </H5>
  A modern state stands at the forefront of society's 
progressive trends; it does not fear society's participation, 
but, rather, encourages and fosters it. A modern state works 
with society in taking steps toward development. To encourage 
modernization, a modern state withdraws from activities in which 
its contribution is possibly inconvenient because it discourages 
the private sector's activities in its own areas, or because it 
diverts resources to activities with a lower level of priority. 
  A modern state clearly understands increasing its direct 
participation in certain economic activities means, given the 
shortage of resources, a reduction of its participation in other 
activities; therefore, what should or should not be done in the 
area of economics should depend on society's real needs, thus 
precluding, depending on the case, the false dilemmas that 
result from misconstrued principles, as if such dilemmas could 
be placed ahead of society. 
  A modern state does not relinquish economic leadership, 
instead, it exercises it for the community's benefit, strictly 
within its sphere of action. (Comments on Monterrey Governor 
Jorge Trevino's fourth annual report, Monterrey, 15 March 1989). 
  Only in an efficient state which attentively attends to 
those 
areas in which its actions are strategic and have priority will 
it be possible to make the actions of all the sectors converge 
to achieve the nation's goals. (Meeting with Mexican Employers 
Confederation, Mexico City, second half of 1989). 
  The Mexican state will not neglect its relations with other 
countries, its sectors and social groups, or its citizens. The 
state will efficiently fulfill its basic duties: guarantee the 
de jure state and the people's security; reconcile the interests 
of all groups; promote conditions for growth, which will foster 
significant progress in Mexicans' well-being. The state's 
modernization hinges on whether this mandate is observed. 
Likewise, the state must direct social development by 
channeling the initiatives of contending sectors. 
  In economics, it is the state's duty to promote, encourage, 
guard, and coordinate national activities within the framework 
of the Constitution of the republic and its laws, ensuring the 
unrestricted exercise of established freedoms and the dignity of 
the human being. It is the fulfillment of these goals that will 
determine the exact magnitude of the Mexican state. There is no 
other way; there cannot be any other way of gaging this. 
(Meeting with the League of Revolutionary Economists, 
Monterrey, N.L., 23 August 1989). 
  In Mexico, the crisis has also taught us lessons on certain 
domestic economic matters. We have learned sources of 
employment are lasting only when they are economically 
productive. We have learned it is very risky not to maintain a 
balance between the value of that which we produce and the value 
of that which we spend. We have learned it was possible for the 
state to be generous only to have inflation devour that which a 
misconstrued lavishness attempted to grant. We have learned 
high inflation undermines a government's popular support. We 
have learned a company, in which the state owns a majority or 
minority of shares, is still, after all, a company. We have 
learned profitability and gains are not ethically execrable 
values but, rather, they can combine individual initiative and 
the well-being of all. We have learned, in short, the mixed 
economy system, such as it is established in our Constitution, 
is still preferable to ultraliberalism and excessive statism. 
(National Economists Congress, Mexico City, 25 October 1989). 
<H5>  Democracy </H5>
  Society's general development can be conceived only in 
democracy. Growth with stability is a requirement for firm 
progress toward the democratic ideal, which, according to the 
national project, is understood not only as a form of government 
or a legal structure but as an improvement of the people's 
living conditions at all levels, political, economic, social, 
and cultural. We should always remember economic improvement 
can only be justified as a national goal inasmuch as it results 
in better living conditions for all Mexicans. (Meeting with the 
National College of Economists in Toluca on 16 June 1989). 
  In a democracy, the state's leadership is society's 
leadership exercised through the agencies society selects to 
ensure the fulfillment of the people's will and the efficient 
management of public affairs. 
  There are no power vacuums. The absence of state leadership, 
or anarchy, is antidemocratic because it creates the conditions 
to override the people's will through decisions of authoritarian 
minorities. For this reason, the government in planning to 
expand political democracy and improve the mechanisms for 
agreement and social participation in the daily exercise of 
authority. 
  We advocate neither uncompromising liberalism nor the 
statism 
that outrages the people's sovereignty, extremes that belong to 
an antidemocracy. (Meeting with the Employers' Confederation of 
the Mexican republic, Mexico City, second semester 1989). 
  Similarly, there is a general demand for more democracy. 
Society eagerly desires new forms of consultation, agreement, 
and negotiation in the political field. Social organizations 
are demanding imaginative ways for rapprochement and cooperation 
among government branches, the country's various regions, and 
organizations. There is a pressing demand for a redefinition of 
relations between the people and the state. (Meeting with the 
PRI, Mexico City, 10 July 1989). 
<H5>  Poverty </H5>
  To break the grip of poverty, to eradicate it presupposes 
fighting it at the source, at the root, where it is deeper, at 
the root, where dissatisfaction is born and social 
discouragement is created. 
  For Mexicans, justice is the challenge to meet. It is to 
mount a frontal attack against poverty, without hesitation. The 
elimination of extreme poverty, inequalities, backwardness, and 
hardships multiplied by the crisis can wait no longer. We must 
resume our growth while recovering our ability to feel 
indignation over and take action against extreme poverty. 
(Installation of the Popular Consultation Forum on Extreme 
Poverty, National Palace, 21 February 1989). 
  We Mexicans are not indifferent to extreme poverty, which 
reveals our insufficiencies and urges us to remedy our 
shortcomings. Our economy's difficulties have been most severe 
on the less fortunate classes. (Party analysis of the 1989 to 
1994 National Development Plan, Mexico City, 10 July 1989). 
  Poverty has been deep-cutting in Mexico. Meso-American 
cultures were far from opulent. The colonial system aggravated 
the situation of large segments of the population. Political 
independence had to be constructed within a framework of social 
disparity. The construction of a liberal state, fully sovereign 
and convinced of its progressive creed, was not sufficient to 
alleviate secular penury. No Mexican historic stage conceals 
lost paradises for which we should long or better times to which 
we wish to return. (International Workshop on the Fight Against 
Extreme Poverty, San Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas, 3 August 
1990). 
<H5>  Regional development </H5>
  There can be no regional development if decentralization and 
policies of municipal strengthening do not take place along with 
it. Up to a short time ago, regional development was conceived 
as a nearly exclusive action of the public sector, with little 
or no participation from the social and private sectors. 
Regional policy appears to be a cause and effect of the 
government sector, as if the private and social sectors and, 
consequently, society in general do not play direct roles in any 
developmental process. For this reason, it is intended that 
such sectors can participate in the new regional development 
policy. This does not mean, however, the Mexican state will 
relinquish the leadership stipulated by the Constitution. 
  It is naive to try to attain a genuine regional development 
only through the application of fiscal resources available to 
federal and state governments and municipal administrations. We 
will make the migration process stop to the extent that we 
succeed in creating a new economic outlook in the country. 
(Popular Consultation Forum on Decentralization for Regional 
Development, Zacatecas, 22 February 1989). 
<H5>  Modernization </H5>
  Modernizing the country means adapting its structures to the 
demands of the present to progress toward national goals. 
Either we make the necessary changes in the process for our own 
good or we will be run over by the changes that would occur 
anyway, only without our participation. Modernizing the country 
is the modernization of all. The state must modernize itself as 
should corporations, labor and employers organizations, 
professional associations, and academic institutions, women and 
young people alike. 
  To stimulate modernization, the modern state desists from 
activities in which its participation is not advisable either 
because it inhibits the actions of particulars in fields 
peculiar to them or diverts resources to nonessential 
activities. In today's world, modernization implies 
competitiveness. It is to be aware of and accept the challenges 
of the international economy, to take advantage of the 
conveniences it offers, and overcome the disadvantages. Under 
present circumstances, autocracy means not taking advantage of 
the many things a rich international coexistence can offer. 
(Commentary to Jorge Trevino's fourth report, Monterrey, 15 
March 1989). 
  Businessmen's success depends on the ability to organize 
production and marketing, particularly on the willingness to 
assume risks. For his own good, the modern businessman should 
not base his success on preferential and discriminatory methods, 
through conversations with the government. (Opening of the 2d 
National Congress of Consultation Enterprises, Mexico City, 15 
April 1989). 
  Economic modernization cannot be conceived without a 
modernization of the public sector, a modernization that can 
raise the public sector's ability to meet education, health, and 
housing needs, as well as needs of other areas. Economic 
modernization entails a timely and adequate supply of the goods 
and services the remainder of society requires. (Meeting of the 
National College of Economists, Toluca, 16 June 1989). 
<H5>  Inflation </H5>
  Constant price increases alter the economy and is a 
formidable punishment to the lower income groups. We Mexicans 
believe this situation is intolerable. Inflation distorts all 
economic indicators and in turn makes the decisionmaking process 
more difficult, encourages inadequate distribution of resources, 
and at the same time concentrates functional and family national 
income. In addition, rising inflation rates repress financial 
awareness, which must be used to revitalize productive 
investments, and cause it to be diverted to more speculative 
activities. This trend blocks economic growth sooner or later. 
(Meeting with the National Public Administration Institute, 
A.C., Mexico City, 19 February 1990) 
<H5>  Public Enterprise </H5>
  In Mexico's revolutionary history, public enterprises have 
been agents of social consensus and political stability. On 
many occasions they have also been representatives of the 
government's performance. Nevertheless, current times are 
demanding we hone public enterprises with the tuning fork of 
international competition, productivity, and efficiency. 
  Breaking up public enterprises is not the same as accepting 
inefficient public service; neither should it be taken as the 
state's withdrawal from its role as economic rector. Today's 
world does not tolerate such simplistic dualisms. (Program 
presentation on Modernizing State Enterprises, Mexico City, 14 
March 1990) 
<H5>  Training of Economists </H5>
  (During past decades)...certain radical critics began by 
noting that in the professional training of economists, the 
defense of the status quo prevailed and the study of all 
theories was avoided, deeming the attributes and theoretical 
differences as academic ways of evading a compromise with the 
most just causes. 
  The best part of that radical criticism revealed, with 
intelligence, the social and political implications of our 
activity. In several ways the criticism found a refuge in the 
ideological dispute to conceal its ineptitude. The existing 
concrete world began to evaporate; the economic reality became 
more distant and inaccessible; the phenomena and operations of 
the world economy and even of the national economy divorced 
themselves from rigid theoretical postures. What, in the 
beginning, was the defense of praiseworthy principles became a 
Byzantine dissertation and ended up an ideological axiom. The 
school gave way to revelation, which in turn gave way to dogma. 
  Simultaneously, in many countries other processes were being 
implemented; meanwhile, our professionals faced all types of 
confusions when entering the real world. Others, those who were 
graduated in private or specialized institutions abroad, took 
the most influential positions not only in the private sector 
but the public sector as well. 
  In Mexico -- and I am sure the same goes for other countries 
of the continent -- economists who graduated from public schools 
have seen their ability to exert an influence or guide the most 
important decisions affecting production, growth, development, 
determining a country's social welfare and justice. (Forum on 
the Training of Economists in Latin America, Mexico City, 26 
March 1990).

<F P=106> [Report by Maria Eugenia Mondragon] </F>
  [Text] The number of Guadalajara voters who will vote for 
the PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] in the August 
presidential elections increased from 49.2 percent to 64.6 
percent, according to a poll carried out by the Opinion Studies 
Center (CEO) the day after Luis Donaldo Colosio was murdered. 
CEO Director Cesar Morones Services explained that due to a lack 
of time, the poll was to find out what the citizens' state of 
mind was following Colosio's murder. The survey was only 
conducted in Guadalajara and not in the 13 cities of Jalisco 
initially planned. 
  The survey results showed that the 49.2 percent of the 
people 
who would vote for PRI increased to 64.6 percent. In contrast, 
the 11.4 percent of the people who would vote for the PRD [Party 
of the Democratic Revolution] dropped to 6.1 percent. The people 
who would vote for PAN [National Action Party] increased from 
15.0 percent to 17.3 percent. 
<H5>  A Voluble Judgment </H5>
  Morones Servin explained that the results do not predict 
what 
will happen in the 21 August elections, but they do reflect the 
way the people felt at the time they were polled in the street. 
"The citizens' opinion can change when they get to the ballot 
boxes," he said. 
  According to the poll, 12.7 percent of the people in 
Guadalajara believe the PRI is guilty of Luis Donaldo Colosio's 
death; 14.4 percent say Mario Aburto killed him on his own; and 
24.2 percent say they do not know. Although it was reported 
yesterday that Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon is the PRI's new 
presidential candidate, the citizens of Guadalajara favored 
Manuel Camacho Solis as the proper person to replace Luis 
Donaldo Colosio. 
  On a personal basis, Morones Servin said preference for the 
PRI had increased in Guadalajara after Colosio's death because 
"citizens voted in favor of the country's political stability." 
He added: "Citizens reject any violence manifested in the 
country." According to the poll, he added, support for the PRI 
increases when violence occurs "so that it can guarantee what it 
has given us for so many years: stability. Colosio left PRI 
preferences very high and held a great gap between his candidacy 
and that of his closest opponent." It is possible, however, for 
the new candidate to change those conditions, he asserted. 
  The CEO, a decentralized organization of the University of 
Guadalajara, held its first pre-electoral poll from 16 to 22 
March. As a result of the 23 March events, some of the 
information gathered by the CEO was superseded. Other 
information, however, such as how many people want to vote, how 
many have their photo ID's, and the degree of trust in the 
electoral organizations remain valid. 
<H5>  Poll in 13 Cities </H5>
  The CEO held its first poll in 13 cities: Mexico City, 
Guadalajara, Monterrey, Tijuana, Ciudad Juarez, Villahermosa, 
Hermosillo, Culiacan, Morelia, Veracruz, Acapulco, Torreon, and 
Puebla. The CEO considers these cities to represent 32 percent 
of the country's total population, that is, one out of every 
three citizens in the republic had the possibility of being 
polled. This makes the survey very representative. 
  In those 13 cities, 78.6 percent said they would vote in the 
upcoming elections; 8.5 percent said they would not vote; and 
10.0 percent have still not decided. This shows people are very 
interested in participating. If this is the case, abstentionism 
will be surmounted. Of the total number of people polled, 81.7 
percent said they already had their photo ID's and 15.2 percent 
said they did not have them. Regarding the people who said they 
did not have their ID's, 41.3 percent said they were being 
processed but they had not received it yet; 23.8 percent said 
they had not requested their cards; and 9.5 percent had not 
picked the card up yet. 
  Regarding the degree of trust that the upcoming elections 
will be honest, 45.5 percent said they did not believe in 
electoral honesty; 20.7 said they did; and 27.8 percent did not 
know. Asked if foreign observers would give the electoral 
process more security and credibility, 54.1 percent said no; 
29.6 percent said probably; and only 14.3 percent said yes. 
Opinions on the Federal Electoral Institute (IFE) were divided 
because 37.3 percent do not believe it is a trustworthy 
organization; 34.3 percent do; and 26.4 percent did not answer. 
  With regard to the main national problem that the next 
president will have to attend, 23.8 percent said it was to 
improve the people's purchasing power; 21.0 percent considered 
it to be increasing the number of jobs; 14.2 percent said the 
main problem to be confronted was to have clean elections; and 
16.8 percent believed it was the quality and quantity of 
education. The opinions of the people polled were even more 
divided with regard to the personal characteristics a 
presidential candidate should have. Most of the people polled 
(32.4 percent) said he has to be responsible; 20.9 percent said 
intelligent; 22.2 percent said honest; 3.0 percent said 
intelligent [as published]; 3.9 said he has to be a peacemaker; 
5.0 percent said strong; and 7.1 percent did not answer. All of 
this data, said Morones Servin, is subject to "natural" 
variations. The CEO, however, will conduct six more polls to 
survey the citizens' feelings. The results of the last poll will 
be announced on 15 August.

<F P=106> [From the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The Bank of Mexico has released its 1993 annual 
report. As of 31 December, the Bank of Mexico's international 
reserves were $24.537 billion, a $6-billion increase at the 
close of 1992. These figures appear in the Bank of Mexico's 1993 
annual report, 172 pages of Mexico's primary economic indicators. 
  The Bank of Mexico cites economic trends following 
noteworthy 
achievements in Mexican economic development, like significant 
progress in structural changes and the control of inflation, 
which was reduced one digit to 8 percent, and increased work 
productivity and in midlevel salaries. Nevertheless, an economic 
slowdown may result from uncertainty regarding NAFTA 
ratification. Other factors that discouraged private spending in 
investment as well as consumption negatively impacted on 
employment. 
  The gross domestic product grew 4 percent in 1993 and the 
surplus in the balance of payments was higher than in 1992, 
accompanied by a high level of enthusiasm in nonpetroleum 
exports and lower deficits in the trade balance and the current 
account. The trade balance deficit was $13.81 billion, a 
$2.5-billion reduction compared to last year's deficit. Crude 
exports were reduced while petroleum byproducts increased. The 
average price of Mexican petroleum on the international market 
went down from $14.83 to $13.20 per barrel. In its 1993 report, 
the Bank of Mexico forecasts an upturn in the Mexican economy 
for 1994, with benefits for all the nation's sectors.

  [Text] Mexico and Canada have signed an agreement to 
initiate mobile satellite communication tests and a program to 
check cellular phone services to be provided through the 
Solidaridad-1 satellite's L-band. These services include radio 
frequency links, radio communications networks for ships at sea, 
and monitoring systems for mobile units. The agreement was 
signed on 24 March by Telecommunications of Mexico (Telecom) and 
TMI Communications, Inc., a Canadian telecommunications 
enterprise. 
  Meanwhile, the trilateral transport meeting scheduled to be 
held by Emilio Gamboa, Federico Pena, and Doug Young, the 
transport secretaries for Mexico, United States, and Canada, 
respectively, was postponed yesterday. The meeting planned to 
study the possibility of facilitating the transit of cargo 
between the three countries. "In solidarity with the Mexican 
people's mourning, however, the ministers of Canada and United 
States asked the Mexican secretary to postpone the meeting," the 
Communications and Transport Secretariat has reported. 
  The tests outlined in the agreement between Mexico and 
Canada 
will be conducted with the Solidaridad satellite and the 
Canadian enterprise's control center, and they will serve to 
check the operation of various types of L-band mobile telephones 
throughout national territory. This band permits mobile phone 
communications and the transmission of data for ground, air, and 
maritime units, as well as rural telephone communications to 
small and faraway communities. 
  Meanwhile in Vancouver, Sheila Copps, Canadian deputy prime 
minister and minister for environment, and Carlos Rojas 
Gutierrez, Mexican secretary for social development, reached an 
agreement on the installation of the Environmental Commission of 
North America, which will be created in accordance with NAFTA's 
Parallel Agreement on Environment. The commission's initial 
duty will be to make proposals in the areas of ecosystems 
conservation and protection, to hold consultations related to 
NAFTA, to enforce regulations, to prevent pollution, to 
stimulate technological cooperation and institutional training, 
and to deal with border issues.

  [Text] Blue chips were down by 4 percent yesterday, Bocon 
[consolidation bonds] quotations plummeted, and the Central Bank 
sold off the staggering amount of $167.4 million. Obviously, 
this turn in business transactions has caused turmoil in the 
City. Stockbrokers found a new explanation for the debacle in 
stock prices: namely the conflict between [National Securities 
Commission Chairman] Martin Redrado and [Economy Minister] 
Domingo Cavallo. Financial circles are visibly confused, and 
cling to any domestic or international event to explain the 
decline in share prices. Given this state of affairs, bankers 
do not dare forecast when the present crisis will be over. 
  The drop in public securities parities is severely affecting 
the pockets of a number of stockbrokers, who had gambled on a 
bull market. This gamble did not turn out as expected, and they 
now have to pay off their debts. During the days of euphoria at 
the Stock Exchange at the beginning of the year, when it seemed 
there was no ceiling for bonds, many of these brokers closed 
futures transactions (purchase of papers to be paid for at the 
end of the month) at prices considerably higher than those 
current. When it was time to settle their debts in February, 
stockbrokers rolled over their transactions with the hope that 
they would be able to reduce their losses this month. But 
things became worse, and now losses are much greater. 
  Bankers have already stated that this time there will be no 
extension of the deadline for settling outstanding debts. 
Stockbrokers will thus have to pay their debts in the coming 
days. Many of them will have to part with some of their capital. 
This situation has obliged many stockbrokers to liquidate their 
positions, which in turn caused share prices to plunge even 
more. Analysts from the City have noted that the uncertainty 
prevailing in the leading international stock markets is 
affecting the Argentine Stock Exchange. They also point out 
that the decline in Argentine papers is greater than that of 
other emerging markets because of the unbridled speculation in 
futures transactions. 
  The stockbrokers that have been able to withstand all this 
are in no rush to purchase bonds and shares. They are awaiting 
the forced liquidation by those who are in tight spots 
financially, so that they can put in an appearance at the stock 
exchange when prices bottom out. This strategy was reflected 
yesterday in the slack trading at the stock exchange -- only 38 
million pesos, the smallest volume of the year. It should be 
pointed out that among the blue chips Tabacal was down by 8.3 
percent, followed by Acindar, Bagley, Celulosa, Indupa, and 
Telefonica, which dropped by 5 percent. YPF [Government Oil 
Deposits) shares, for their part, closed at 24.20 pesos, thus 
registering a 3.8 percent decline. 
  The sale of dollars by the Central Bank did not help at all 
to calm stockbrokers down. Even though experts assert that the 
current drain on reserves (the Treasury has lost $514.1 million 
so far this month) stems from the great liquidity prevalent in 
the system, financial circles dislike major interventions by the 
Central Bank as the selling party on the exchange market. In 
any case they state that this issue will be a cause for concern 
if at the beginning of April the Central Bank does not start to 
recover part of the dollars it is now selling.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Bolivia monitored through 31 
March. 
  According to a survey by the Center of Studies for Labor and 
Agriculture Development, CEDLA, available savings -- in real 
terms and not financial flow terms -- gradually declined from 
10.8 percent of the GDP in 1985 to barely 1.5 percent in 1991. 
According to the CEDLA survey, gross domestic savings totaled 
15.1 percent in 1991, but after deducting foreign debt payments 
and including donations from friendly countries, Bolivia's 
available savings barely totaled 1.5 percent of the GDP. In 
1991, the foreign debt's servicing was 4.8 percent of the GDP. 
(La Paz HOY in Spanish 15 Mar 94 Economic Section p 20) 
  A consortium made up of the National Mortgage Bank, the 
Bolivian-American Bank, and the Trading Bank, Inc., approved a 
$12.5 million loan for YPFB, Bolivian Government Oil Deposits. 
This loan will allow YPFB to pay its floating debt. The loan 
establishes a 30-month repayment period and a six-month grace 
period. As of September, YPFB will pay a preferential interest 
rate of 11 percent yearly. (La Paz PRESENCIA in Spanish 15 Mar

<F P=106> [Article by Carlos Jose Marques, Luis Antonio Novaes, and </F>
Helio Contreiras] 
  [Text] The Amazon region, the lungs of the world--a 
nickname that certainly takes into account more than its 
ecological endowments--has in recent decades been the stage for 
episodes, not the least sedate, of devastation of riches. Forest 
burnings, mineral smuggling, the massacres of Yanomami, the 
activities of drug traffickers, and landings on clandestine 
airstrips have all contributed to reinforce the image of a 
territory that is almost abandoned. A futuristic scenario full 
of technological installations, the latest-generation radar, 
mobile and stationary radio surveillance units, computerized 
guided missiles and an infinite array of sensor paraphernalia 
could soon transform this picture. An international bidding 
competition aimed at endowing the region with the most complete 
system available for protecting this country is about to be 
concluded. It has excited the universe of equipment 
manufacturers as never before. The war is a brutal one that 
involves billions--about $1 billion is forecast to be spent in 
the first phase, and as much as $5 billion could be spent before 
the system is finished--and features plenty of dramatic 
maneuvers. The resources available to the players are enormous: 
heads of government of the major powers, heavyweights of the 
business world, and military commandos, all engrossed in 
diplomatic intrigues and battles for information and under 
pressure from all sorts of lobbyists. At stake is one of the 
most generous packages of orders the industry has ever seen. 
"There is no project like it anywhere, and it could be the most 
profitable in the decade," observed Richard Breadbarry, vice 
president of Hughes Aircraft, one of the American giants in the 
control systems business that are competing for that part of the 
project. 
  Hughes, like the other competing firms, discreetly submitted 
its technical and commercial proposals against the background of 
the first drumbeats of revelry on the Saturday before Carnival. 
The deadline for presentation of the credit lines, a 
precondition for the choice of the vendors, is 4 April. The 
candidates have gathered in four different pools, each comprised 
of manufacturers of aircraft, telecommunications systems, 
sensors, and informatics products. The French firm Thomson-CSF, 
traditional supplier of radar to the Air Force, and Alcatel lead 
the European group that has the most experience in the Brazilian 
market. Unisys, NEC, Westinghouse, and Hughes make up a team 
that is almost unbeatable internationally in the field of 
surveillance and protection systems. 
  Raytheon, an American colossus in the area of radar 
manufacture, has joined IBM and Ericsson to form a pool that has 
nothing to apologize for. Lastly, a couple of state 
enterprises--Dasa (German) and Alenia (Italian)-- believe their 
long history of services to the public sector will weigh in 
their favor when decision day rolls around. Besides these 
multinationals, seven other companies are competing 
independently to fill certain orders for the project, which has 
been dubbed the Amazon Region Surveillance System, or Sivam. As 
if the sheer size of the candidates were not enough, official 
representatives from several countries are working behind the 
scenes to help make this or that consortium the victor. Before 
it reached the desks of Brazilian officials, the proposal from 
Raytheon Company, one of whose biggest clients is the U.S. 
Department of Defense, had been hand-delivered to U.S. President 
Bill Clinton, who gave the matter priority treatment. The 
proposal was sent to the National Economic Council, a committee 
comprised of 12 federal government agencies that reviews 
business deals of great interest to the White House. In response 
to Clinton's inquiry, Robert Rubin, the council's director, 
suggested the matter be treated in parallel with the discussion 
on pending Brazilian trade issues in the area of patents. In the 
impressive offices at the Washington headquarters of the USTR, 
the United States Trade Representative, commercial sanctions 
against Brazil were being considered because of a failure to 
enact laws protecting patents. According to one USTR advisor, 
the selection of an American group in the Amazon competition 
"would certainly facilitate an easing of the sanctions." Since 
the threat no longer exists, all that is left is the negotiation 
of the project. 
  At any rate, the Americans have no monopoly on the exercise 
of this kind of pressure. The European consortia, which got a 
head start in terms of political mobilization, also have strong 
backing from their respective countries. In the middle of 1993, 
during a trip by Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso to 
Europe, the subject was raised more than once during different 
meetings. At the lunch with local businessmen, the Amazon Region 
deals were the piece de resistance. The managing 
director of the IMF, Michel Camdessus, was emphatic in stressing 
the importance to France of this project. At the Paris Club, 
which is studying the possibility of renegotiating Brazil's 
foreign debt, the competition and the release of the needed 
funding have already been mentioned. Key pieces on the game 
board of Brazil's external commitments, the Paris Club and the 
IMF can play a decisive role in the selection of the equipment 
manufacturers. "It is no secret that the agreement with the IMF 
will regulate the understandings on the project," said Brigadier 
General Lauro Nei Menezes (Reserve) who once headed the Air 
Force's Aerospace Technical Center and is now a consultant on 
the business aspects of Sivam. "Given the size of the 
transaction, the question of financing is vital and the IMF 
could influence it favorably," he believes. 
  The Brazilian Government imposed a requirement that each 
consortium's proposal be accompanied by a guarantee of 
financing, and the European and American groups are still hard 
at work on this aspect. "The banks are talking to each other and 
the best proposal for financing Sivam will depend on the 
evolution of an agreement on the foreign debt," said Armando 
Medeiros, director of special projects for Alcatel. "In our 
case, we will have the backing of the French government." The 
executive of Alcatel--a world telecommunications giant with 
annual sales in excess of $20 billion-- dismissed the idea that 
his consortium might not obtain the financing. He argues that 
the Europeans are going to be in a better position than the 
Americans to offer a more attractive financial solution, because 
they are not facing the same kind of official resistance. There 
is no question that allegations like this are ploys in the 
information game intended to bombard the enemy positions, but 
judging by the initial reactions from the U.S. Eximbank, the 
American groups have something to worry about. "If the debts are 
not rescheduled, we will not make any deal with the Brazilian 
Government," warned Christopher Dorval, the bank's 
representative. 
  A letter sent in January from the U.S. secretary of commerce 
to Minister Mario Cesar Flores of the Secretariat of Strategic 
Affairs (SAE), confirms that the American groups will not get 
the hoped-for financing and that, at the moment, only the best 
"basket" of credit options is being discussed. Celso Fernandes 
Junior and Kenneth Hansen, IBM's representatives in one of the 
consortia, told ISTOE that the Americans' proposal will surprise 
people and that the possibility that some of the money might 
come in the form of donations has not been ruled out. "There is 
a lot of interest in the United States in supporting the project 
because of what it means for security in one of the most 
important parts of the world," Fernandes Junior claimed. The 
same terms are being sought by the Unisys and Dasa pools. But, 
during the phase preceding the selection of the best proposal, 
the jabbering has served to heat up the contest. 
  Beyond the financial bickering, there is another focal point 
of controversy, one that relates to the nature of the project. 
Because it involves participation of entities ranging from civil 
institutions such as Funai [National Indian Foundation] to 
military bodies like the National Air Defense and Air Traffic 
Control System (Sindacta), there are those who would like to 
portray it as a military-led mixed project. The Europeans are 
especially interested in highlighting the military aspects of 
the competition in the Amazon Region, for a very simple reason: 
American laws do not allow that country's companies to supply 
high-tech equipment and technology for systems that have a 
military purpose. This way, all the American consortia would be 
shunted aside with a stroke of a pen. This desire to 
characterize the project as military has the support of some 
sectors of the Ministry of Aeronautics, which would then have 
control over a hefty investment package, a real Christmas 
present in times of skimpy budgets. "We know that companies from 
various countries that have more flexible laws want Sivam to 
stay in the military area, but it will not be that way," 
Minister Flores has said. 
  Behind the scenes, the head of the SAE has been waging 
another intramural barracks battle ever since the competition 
was launched in the middle of last year. It is rumored in 
military circles that the Air Force was not happy about having 
lost Sivam to the SAE and is still trying to wield influence in 
the project. Esca-Control and Automation Systems Engineering, 
the company that will supervise the Sivam services, is said to 
be its listening post. Esca's partners, most of whom are retired 
Air Force colonels--among them Colonel Jose Ernesto Monteiro, 
who until a very short time ago was its president--are thought 
to have a lot of clout in Sivam. Some sector sources say this is 
why Esca gained a strategic position in the project without even 
participating in the bidding process. "The SAE reluctantly 
accepted the inclusion of Esca in order to avoid problems," a 
high official of the secretariat said. Since 1991, the 
government has been Esca's biggest customer, accounting for 80 
percent of its sales. The company also has strong ties to the 
French, because it has long been a client of Banque Nationale de 
Paris (BNP). The marriage of interests is further strengthened 
by the presence of the company Tecnasa, an electronics equipment 
manufacturer that will assist with Esca operations. 
  In the field of aircraft supply--where the project calls for 
orders worth $250 million--the Dutch Fokker, represented in 
Brazil by the Monteiro Aranha group, yearns to come out the 
winner with its Fokker 50 turboprop, known as the "King Bing." 
"We have the greatest possible interest in this competition, and 
we have a suitable product," said Colonel Renato Goulart, the 
company representative, who hopes to sell at least four planes 
at a price of $30 million each. Chief among the specifications 
the plane is required to meet is adaptability to carry mobile 
radar for AWACS systems. In that area of the competition, the 
Brasilia model built by Embraer [Brazilian Aeronautics Company, 
Inc.], has the advantage. The fact the plane is made by a 
domestic company and that the government needs to come to the 
financial rescue of the state enterprise--which, with debts of 
$700 million, is still looking for oxygen to keep it alive--are 
aspects that will count for a lot on decision day. The consortia 
were advised by the coordinators of Sivam to look for a 
Brazilian partner. 
  Unisys Corporation, a mammoth in the informatics business 
with annual sales of around $8 billion, has put together one of 
the most complete consortia in the competition--including in it 
some world leaders in different fields--and did not ignore this 
advice. Embraer also appears in its proposal. Unisys already 
provides 90 percent of the air traffic control systems in the 
United States. In Brazil, it has assumed responsibility for 
coordinating one of the pools in the Amazon Region project and 
is willing to expand its activities. "If we win, we will invest 
heavily in new facilities, equipment testing, and assembly 
laboratories," said Jose Roberto Santos, director of the company 
that would directly supply some of the means for surveillance, 
environmental control, traffic control, and weather monitoring. 
Hughes, which shares leadership of the pool with Unisys, was 
assigned the systems integration portion. NEC will handle the 
communications part of the job. "We will set up four 
telecommunications parent stations that will relay the 
transmissions via satellite," said Vair Doiche, products and 
projects manager for the group that last year had sales of $30 
billion. 
  In the other American consortium, Raytheon is taking charge 
of supplying the 17 radars that Sivam is asking for. The radars 
are considered to be a big slice of the orders pie, and the 
manufacturer that sold three systems to India, Holland, and 
Norway last year, reaping sales of more than $9 billion, said 
this is the most attractive competition in which it has been 
involved in recent years. "The projects we won were on the order 
of $100 million," said Carlos Gonzaga, a director of Lider Air 
Taxi, which represents Raytheon. "The Sivam project is at least 
four times as big." Bob Young, dispatched to Brazil by the 
American multinational especially to follow the progress of the 
competition, adds that the parent company considers this "the 
most important contest this year." IBM and Ericsson also see it 
that way. The former claims it has already started training 
specialized personnel to manage the computerized systems for 
Sivam. "We are ready to start," Fernandes Junior points out. 
Ericsson, in turn, inspired by Sivam, is reorganizing its 
operations in this market. In January, it brought a new 
executive, Bjorn Lundgren, from the home office in Sweden to 
preside over the green-and-yellow arm of Matec, one of the 
companies in the group. "Matec is bidding on the MD-110 PABX 
equipment for the telecommunications services under the 
project," Lundgren revealed. "We will be competing through 
Matec." 
  In the French camp, Thomson-CSF, which has sales of $10 
billion a year and has already supplied radar for the two phases 
of Sindacta, is attempting to act with some discretion. The 
reasons are said to be the sharp attacks leveled against it by 
competitors and even by some sectors of the government, unhappy 
with the near-monopoly the company has held in this area. The 
clearest demonstration of this dissatisfaction may be the 
company's recent loss to Hughes in the bidding to readapt radar 
equipment that Thomson-CSF itself supplied years ago. "This is 
proof that the Brazilian Government wants something more 
modern," said Hughes' Breadberry [as published], needling his 
rival. "We do not have a monopoly on supply and it is not 
unusual not to win a competition. We won a lot of others," 
alleged Gilles Piffard, a Thomson director. Piffard told ISTOE 
that "people are doing all sorts of things to destroy Thomson's 
hegemony in this field, but they will not succeed." 
  Weighing against the French state enterprise in the battle 
of 
information and misinformation was the accusation that at the 
request of its government during the Gulf War, Thomson had 
disconnected the radar it had supplied to Iraq. The charge, 
although unproven, raised fears about the security of the Amazon 
Region project in the event that the French radars are selected. 
Piffard reacted sarcastically to the report, saying: "I don't 
know what kind of power people are attributing to us." Armando 
Medeiros, director of projects at Alcatel, also came out in 
defense of his partner company. "What is lacking are solid 
arguments to counter our superior preparation." Alcatel cites as 
its best weapon its previous experience in surveillance systems. 
"We already have more than 20 years of commercial relations with 
the Brazilian Government, and that counts for something," 
Medeiros said. Truly, this is a war between giants, and 
predictions as to the winner are nothing more than the expressed 
hopes of the competitors' fan clubs. At any rate, the Amazon 
Region is a market that can never satiate the appetites of the 
rivals. 
<H5>  [Box p 66] </H5>
<H5>  What is Sivam? </H5>
  Although fictional, the classic figure of Big Brother in 
George Orwell's book 1984 will be getting a twin 
brother whose eyes are focused on the Amazon Region. Any 
clandestine aircraft flight, any hot spot of tree-burning or 
site of deforestation, the movements of the drug trade, and any 
sort of assault on the region will be detected in a matter of 
seconds and promptly countered. In practice, the system will be 
based on the operation of 17 radars, four communications network 
stations, an endless system of electronic apparatus, and the 
Brasilsat satellite, which will transmit most of the data. 
Initially estimated at $800 million, the project has grown, won 
the backing of Venezuela and Colombia, and now reached the 
billions point. Because of the situation in the Amazon Region, 
Sivam is vital. What is debatable is its priority at a time when 
the federal budget is being cut in essential areas like health 
and education.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Brazil monitored through 31 
March. 
  The Sao Paulo Commercial Federation reported that February 
sales in Sao Paulo increased 12.28 percent compared with the 
same month in 1993, and that this has been the best level of 
sales in the country in the last three years. (Brasilia Voz do 
Brasil Network in Portuguese 2200 GMT 25 Mar 94) 
  A merger between Brastemp and Consul, both of which belong 
to 
the Brasmotor Group, was announced on 24 March by the holding 
company's president, Hugo Miguel Etchenique. The new company, 
whose merger must still be approved at an April stockholders' 
meeting, will be called Multibras, Inc. Household Appliances. 
The new company's sales will initially total $800 million per 
year with exports of $100 million. Multibras will have 10,000 
employees. Etchenique said he will not shut down any factories 
or cut manufacturing. (Sao Paulo O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO in 
Portuguese 25 Mar 94 Economy Section p B12) 
  Fuel prices will be increased 19.25 percent as of 26 March, 
the Finance Ministry announced on 25 March. Average fuel price 
increases totaled 42.5 percent in March as of 24 March. (Sao 
Paulo GAZETA MERCANTIL in Portuguese 25 Mar 94 p 16) 
  Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso and Sao Paulo 
Governor Luiz Antonio Fleury Filho on 25 March signed contracts 
to refinance the Sao Paulo Government's debts to the Bank of 
Brazil, the Treasury's agent. Three billion dollars, involving 
debts contracted with the Federal Savings Bank, the National 
Bank for Economic and Social Development, and the Bank of Brazil 
and allocated for investments, have been refinanced. The debt's 
rollover will be indexed using the IGPM, Market Prices General 
Index, or the TR, Referential Interest Rate. The contracts call 
for 240 monthly installments. (Sao Paulo O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO 
in Portuguese 26 Mar 94 Economy Section p B5) 
  Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Parana States lose $560 
million per year from a commonplace maneuver in oil and oil 
by-products: fabricated interstate fuel sales to dodge ICMS, 
Goods and Services Movement Tax, collection. This type of fraud 
totals $1 billion throughout our country. Illegal trade 
operations involve 35 percent of total oil by-products sales in 
our country. (Sao Paulo O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO in Portuguese 27 
Mar 94 Economic Section p B11) 
  Braspetro, Petrobras International, Inc., is negotiating to 
prospect for and produce oil and natural gas in Peru and 
Bolivia. In 1993, Braspetro produced an average of 22,900 
barrels of oil per day in five countries: Angola, Argentina, 
England, the United States, and Ecuador. In Colombia, Braspetro 
will begin producing 600 barrels per day in the Llanos basin, 
while it will perform exploratory work in Libya and Norway. In 
1994, Braspetro will expand its production to 31,000 barrels per 
day, investing $160 million. In Argentina, Braspetro reduced its 
participation in the San Julian maritime basin from 53.5 to 33.5 
percent. (Sao Paulo GAZETA MERCANTIL in Portuguese 29 Mar 94 
Special Section p 3) 
  Brazilian oil reserves stand at 3.8 billion barrels, 5.5 
percent higher than at the end of 1992. This reserve will last 
16 years based on average production of approximately 700,000 
barrels per day. (Sao Paulo GAZETA MERCANTIL in Portuguese 29 
Mar 94 Special Section p 4) 
  Agriculture Minister Synval Guazzeli and Nidero Maki, vice 
president of Japan International Cooperation Agency, on 29 March 
signed a contract for financing the third phase of the 
Brazilian-Japanese Cooperation Program for the development of 
the Cerrado region -- the Prodecer III project. The project 
involves agricultural development of 40,000 hectares in Maranhao 
and Tocantins States. The Prodecer III project will get an 
investment of $138 million. Japan will provide $83 million and 
Brazil $55 million. (Sao Paulo O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO in 
Portuguese 30 Mar 94 p B4)

  [Excerpts] Right-wing parties have urged the administration 
to send clear signals to the Carabineros on how far they can go 
in dealing with street incidents. Spokesmen for right-wing 
parties have indicated that certain attitudes recently displayed 
by the Carabineros could be viewed as signals this institution 
is sending to the Interior Ministry. 
  [Begin recording] [Reporter Miriam Leyman] Right-wing 
politicians have interpreted recent actions by the Carabineros 
as a clear signal to the Interior Ministry. Carabineros used 
only water cannons during the incidents that took place in front 
of the former Pedagogical Institute, while the dwellers of Villa 
Francia were repressed in a much harsher manner. Independent 
Democratic Union [UDI] Deputy Andres Chadwick said that this 
kind of behavior could be interpreted as a warning, and pointed 
out that there are the seeds of a conflict between the 
Carabineros and the Interior Ministry. 
  The motives behind the friction are many: first, the 
reshuffling of Carabineros high echelons, with which former 
Interior Minister Correa [as heard] openly interfered; second, 
the intentions of the current interior minister to transfer the 
Carabineros from the Defense Ministry to the Interior Ministry, 
against the wishes of the Carabineros; and third, the lack of 
clear-cut guidelines concerning the extent of the institution's 
powers to deal with public security matters. Chadwick explained 
that all these motives could prompt the Carabineros to send 
warning signals. 
  [Chadwick] All these actions can be considered signals. I 
have no idea what the Carabineros could be thinking, as I have 
not been in touch with them, but I can put myself in their 
position. Whenever the Carabineros act harshly they are 
immediately criticized, and steps were even taken to reshuffle 
their upper echelons. On the other hand, when the Carabineros 
take no action or get bored with all the complaining and avoid 
harsh measures, they are criticized just the same. Their 
attitude could be therefore interpreted as a sign that they need 
the Interior Ministry to clearly establish what the Carabineros 
are supposed to do, how far they can go, and what their 
responsibilities are. 
  [Leyman] Center-Center Union Senator Francisco Javier 
Errazuriz asked the Carabineros and the Interior Ministry for an 
explanation of the lack of action under certain circumstances. 
  [Errazuriz] I believe that the situation is very serious. 
Undoubtedly the Carabineros must explain why they stood by and 
did nothing, but President Eduardo Frei must also explain 
himself. He should make it clear whether this will be the 
policy of his administration. 
  [Leyman] Both legislators agreed that the administration has 
not defined the Carabineros' role as far as public order and the 
security of citizens is concerned. This situation may be 
irritating the Carabineros. [end recording] 
  The Interior Ministry has repudiated the violent incidents 
that took place near the former Pedagogical Institute and in 
Villa Francia. It announced that it would file lawsuits against 
those who are found responsible for such incidents. In response 
to articles published in certain media, the Interior Ministry 
explained that it has not given the Carabineros any special 
instructions for the handling of the incidents in question. 
This is what Interior Ministry Under Secretary Belisario 
Velasco had to say on the issue: 
  [Begin Belisario Velasco recording] The Interior Ministry 
neither directs operations nor orders them to be carried out. 
This is the Carabineros' job. As to general guidelines, the 
administration obviously has a policy, and this policy calls for 
preserving public order and security through the appropriate 
constitutional mechanisms. These mechanisms are the Carabineros 
and the Investigative Police. They have their own charters and 
procedures which they must follow. Talks are under way with the 
Carabineros so that every possible measure may be taken to 
prevent clashes and to make sure that the Carabineros' reaction 
will not be out of proportion with the actions of the 
demonstrators. [end recording] [passage omitted] 
  Carabineros Director General Rodolfo Stange -- who went to 
La 
Moneda Palace for separate meetings with Interior Minister 
German Correa and President Eduardo Frei to invite them to the 
festivities marking the institution's anniversary -- explained 
that the instructions for dealing with the incidents in question 
were issued by Carabineros Metropolitan Headquarters. 
  [Begin recording] [Stange] Unlike what some people have 
claimed, neither the Interior Ministry nor any other agency has 
issued instructions for dealing with these incidents. I want to 
make this absolutely clear. 
  [Unidentified reporter] General, aren't you afraid that a 
softer approach will make the people lose respect for the 
Carabineros, and that those who will suffer from the 
consequences of this approach will criticize you? 
  [Stange] I do not believe so. I really do not believe so. 
Because of this change of approach, the so-called day of the 
combatants -- and I would like you to analyze what the word 
combatant means in this context -- did not develop into 
something much more serious. I really believe that this was due 
to the Carabineros' calm attitude. [end recording] 
  Asked about the Carabineros' hostile attitude toward 
journalists covering the Villa Francia incident, during which 
Carabineros hurt a cameraman and damaged his equipment, Gen. 
Stange answered that he knew nothing about it. [passage omitted] 
  The Interior Ministry has filed a lawsuit against all those 
who may be found to be responsible for the incidents that took 
place on 29 March near the Metropolitan University for 
Educational Sciences, formerly called the Pedagogical Institute. 
During these incidents a supermarket and a service station were 
damaged. [passage omitted] 
  New incidents broke out again on 30 March in the 
neighborhood 
of the former Pedagogical Institute, along Jose Alessandri 
Avenue in Macul District. The demonstrators blocked the avenue 
and created a traffic jam. No arrests or injuries were reported 
during this incident. Carabineros cordoned off the area. Their 
plan of action appeared to be similar to that which they 
implemented the day before in the same area. General (Luis 
Pulgar), deputy chief of Carabineros Metropolitan Zone, arrived 
at the site and talked to journalists. Gen. Pulgar explained 
that the idea was to avoid appearing to be provocateurs. 
  [Begin recording] [(Pulgar)] The Metropolitan Headquarters 
issued very clear instructions: We must not appear to be 
provoking the demonstrators. Yesterday's incidents were 
resolved, nobody was injured, and very few people were arrested. 
Unfortunately, there were damages. We have made an evaluation 
and our police procedures will have to change according to 
circumstances. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Does this mean that the Carabineros 
have a new strategy? 
  [(Pulgar)] Of course, we are changing our way of handling 
various circumstances. [end recording]

  [Text] Santiago, 31 Mar (EFE) -- The Mapuche Indian 
"All-Lands Council" organization announced today that it will 
resume its policy of taking over land in southern Chile on the 
basis that the land was taken away illegally from the Indians. 
  The announcement was made at the closing of the Fourth 
Mapuche Tribunal held by this organization, which also was 
attended by especially invited Mapuche Indians from Argentina. 
  The Mapuche organization also decided to ask for the 
immediate revision of the land treaties signed by various 
Chilean governments and it also questioned the government policy 
regarding the Indian population. 
  Council President Aucan Huilcaman announced that the process 
"for recovering the land" will be resumed in the next few weeks. 
  Huilcaman added: "Before occupying the land we will show the 
documents proving that the recovered land really belongs to the 
Mapuche." 
  In 1992, Mapuche Indians belonging to the All-Lands Council 
peacefully occupied some land in the Ninth Region, from which 
they were evicted by police. 
  On orders from then-Interior Minister Enrique Krauss, more 
than 100 Indians were tried for "illegal association" and 
"illegal takeover of land" and some were imprisoned. 
  There are about 1 million Indians in Chile, of which about 
two-thirds are Mapuche. 
  During the government of President Patricio Aylwin 
(1990-1994), Congress approved an Indian law culturally 
recognizing the ethnic groups that live in Chile and 
establishing a series of mechanisms for their social and 
economic development. 
  The law also created the National Land Fund to help 
contribute to the recovery of some of the land taken away from 
the Indian population or to purchase new land.

  [Text] A new guerrilla group has begun to operate in 
Colombia. It calls itself Total Democracy [Democracia Total] or 
Radical Democracy [Democracia Radical]. According to the DAS 
[Administrative Department of Security] Intelligence Department, 
the organization is made up of former members from the M-19 [19 
April Movement] and Faith, Peace, and Freedom [EPL] who are 
dissidents from the peace process. 
  The new organization's military targets are the presidential 
candidates, congress members, bankers, industrialists, and their 
former comrades, whom they accuse of treason. The director of 
the DAS Intelligence Department pointed out that documents found 
during an operation carried out by the DAS anti-kidnapping group 
disclosed that the guerrillas were planning multiple attacks to 
announce their subversive organization. 
  [Begin DAS Intelligence Director Ricardo Villarraga Franco 
recording] They think the subversive struggle should be 
transferred to the cities; that their support in the rural areas 
is not as large as they would like. They want to carry out 
selective attacks, as they themselves say, against the 
bourgeoisie in the country. [end recording] 
  Villarraga Franco insists this new guerrilla organization 
has 
recruited at least 20 percent of the former fighters of the four 
subversive organizations that demobilized. In addition, he said 
they are opposed to the tactics used by the National Guerrilla 
Coordinating Board. 
  The main topic of the most recent Security Council held at 
the Defense Ministry was the appearance of Total Democracy. The 
authorities feel this group cannot be underestimated, because it 
has grown in strength and military capability.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on developments related to the Colombian elections 
scheduled for 22 May 1994. 
  While campaigning in Giron, Santander Department, 
Conservative Party presidential candidate Andres Pastrana 
pledged to strengthen Colombia's industrial sector and to 
eliminate contraband. Pastrana said: "The country must wage a 
frontal assault on contraband to prevent it from plunging 
thousands of people into poverty and unemployment, as is now 
happening in Colombia." (Santa Fe de Bogota Inravision 
Television Cadena 1 in Spanish 0000 GMT 26 Mar 94) 
  Ernesto Samper now is the sole leader of the Liberal Party, 
which he is reorganizing. He is forming a broad-based party 
that will include all sectors. Carlos Lleras de la Fuente, 
Rodolfo Gonzalez and David Turbay, former presidential hopefuls 
who vied for the party's nomination, will be Samper's direct 
advisers. (Santa Fe de Bogota Inravision Television Cadena 1 in 
Spanish 1730 GMT 25 Mar 94)

<F P=106> [Article by German Duque; first paragraph is EL ESPECTADOR </F>
introduction] 
  [Text] A glance at the presidential economic programs: Is 
Pastrana the same as Gaviria? Does Samper make the difference? 
Do Conservatives and Liberals have practically identical plans? 
Everyone talks about reconversion in their economic policies, 
but generally speaking, they have not restructured their ideas 
and programs. Pastrana preserves almost everything in Gaviria's 
program, even the same statistics. Some differences can be found 
in Samper's proposals, especially because of his emphasis on 
employment policy and the farm sector. 
  Although the country may be in the same economic situation 
as 
it was four years ago, it does not seem logical that the 
proposals for dealing with the problems would be just as 
identical, or at least very similar to those put forward four 
years ago. 
  It is clear that the country's statistics are out of date, 
but it is also true that the structural problems are still here. 
It is sad, however, to see things being treated just the same, 
while at the same time the "great change" is trumpeted. 
  The overall diagnosis, indeed, could be the same: a minority 
with great prosperity surrounded by ever-greater opportunities, 
and a majority with serious survival problems and a lack of 
opportunity. 
  In this regard, in the spirit of change that the various 
political campaigns are promoting, one might hope that, for 
example, some Conservative proposals would be markedly different 
from those made by the Liberals, and of course, clearly 
different from those of a Liberal government. Otherwise, we 
could not talk of change but of continuation. 
  On the latter point, however, it would be worth considering 
the possibility--appropriate, in many cases--of a Liberal 
candidate continuing the strategy of a Liberal government, as 
predecessor and current administration. 
  Nonetheless, in both situations, one would expect more 
ambitious and aggressive proposals coming from the opposition 
parties, since the idea is to close the gap between the haves 
and the have-nots, if the central diagnosis is really true and 
correct. 
  An initial face-value analysis of the features of Gaviria's 
"Peaceful Revolution" plan, compared to Pastrana's and Samper's 
current proposals, clearly reveals that there are tremendous 
similarities among them, especially between the first two, those 
of Gaviria and Pastrana. 
  It could be said that Pastrana liked what Gaviria did so 
much 
that he wants to keep it all practically unchanged; but it could 
also be said that Gaviria left so many things unfinished that 
Pastrana and Samper would like to continue them. That is not 
necessarily a bad thing, either, because a highway should not be 
left half done or an aqueduct without water simply because of a 
change in government. 
  The surprising thing is that some people seem to want to 
copy 
others' programs to the letter, plain and simple. For example, 
in the area of infrastructure, Pastrana proposes rehabilitating 
1,600 kilometers of railways. Gaviria's plan contains the same 
figure, but it is unlikely in that sector, with Ferrovias going 
full steam ahead, that even 10 percent of the network has 
managed to be improved. Pastrana would be right to propose it 
again if indeed nothing had been accomplished in that sector 
except for the payment of huge sums of compensation to the trade 
unions. 
  Another example: Pastrana says he will seek to turn 500,000 
hectares into suitable farmland. Gaviria proposed this same 
figure four years ago. (And if I recall correctly, Lopez 
Michelsen proposed the same thing 16 years ago when he created 
the Himat for the same purpose.) It could be argued that 
Pastrana is right for undertaking such a project, since it was 
apparently too much for the Gaviria administration to accomplish. 
  In the case of water, Gaviria contended that 11 million 
Colombians did not have potable water service (a serious symptom 
of poverty, or of NBI [Unsatisfied Basic Need], as it is called 
now). Pastrana is concerned about the same 11 million people's 
need for this vital liquid. Can it be that the country has not 
added a single liter of water to its service in the last four 
years? 
  It would appear that the Samper camp, or the Samper case 
(surely because he spent part of the time away from the Gaviria 
administration) has not been as anesthetized or as supportive of 
the "Peaceful Revolution." 
  Regarding the initiatives we have been commenting on in the 
area of infrastructure, they are not clear because the 
government platform has not been presented in its entirety. 
  On the other hand, it is clear that in the macroeconomic 
sphere, Samper is interested in making all of the economic 
machinery revolve around massive job creation. 
  He thinks that jobs are the starting point for prosperity in 
any Colombian family, and he has specifically pledged to create 
more than 1 million new jobs. 
  Maybe this is the characteristic that most distinguishes 
Pastrana from Gaviria: his emphasis on jobs. 
  With regard to the liberalization of the economy, both 
Pastrana and Samper propose that it be consolidated, but the 
latter is not as enamored of "wholesale" imports without 
"reciprocity" in trade relations, a key element in the 
internationalization of the economy. What this means is that 
Colombia would only buy from those who buy its products. 
Something like the fight that has already started between the 
United States and Japan, serious advocates of "free trade." 
  All of the proposals, from Gaviria to the present, have in 
common ideas for industrial reconversion, export promotion, job 
training, productivity, competitiveness, etc., etc.,--in short, 
the usual menu for counteracting drastic liberalization programs. 
  This is a contrast to the now-famous Asian tigers, 
who first reconverted and made technological and human-capital 
advances, and then went out into the international market to 
bare their sharp teeth. 
  Here is a chart comparing Gaviria's government program and 
Samper's and Pastrana's proposals: 
<H5>  Economy </H5>
<H5>  Cesar Gaviria </H5>

  -  Accelerated growth predicted, until an average of 5 
percent a year is reached by the end of the presidential 
term. 
  -  The number of people whose basic needs are still unmet 
will shrink by more than 3 million if the proposed targets of 
the social programs are reached. 
  -  The most important reform is 
economic liberalization, eliminating administrative controls, 
creating the conditions for our products to become truly 
competitive on international markets. 
  -  In second place are the 
labor reform measures aimed at bringing flexibility to one of 
the most rigid elements of the economy, without which the 
success of the liberalization would be hampered. 
  -  A mechanism of 
flexible tariffs is established to regulate international trade, 
and a system of compensatory actions will be set up to eliminate 
unfair practices that harm Colombian producers. 
  -  The quest for 
economic gain under the guise of legal or administrative perks 
bears hidden costs for society as a whole, the magnitude of 
which, though difficult to calculate, is significant and very 
harmful. 

<H5>    Ernesto Samper </H5>

  -  The strategy for attaining full employment will be based 
on economic growth rates above 5 percent a year, the adoption of 
a new style of economic and social development, and the 
implementation of specific employment programs. 
  -  A social policy 
that will go beyond the traditional benefit-oriented approach 
limited to reducing the number of poor people by assuring them 
of a basic-level of existence or meeting their basic needs. 
  -  A 
macroeconomic policy that will prevent a revaluation and 
stimulate investment and growth in an atmosphere of price 
stability; the consolidation of the economic liberalization and 
progress toward an internationalization that will give priority 
to exports and jobs. 
  -  The specific employment programs will be 
aimed at overcoming the structural problems of the labor market. 
They will focus on the training and placement of unemployed 
youths and women. 

<H5>    Andres Pastrana </H5>

  -  Strong foundations will be laid to achieve growth rates 
above 8 percent (as Chile and China have done). 
  -  Development will 
be sustainable. Its objective will be to benefit the weakest 
within a policy of environmental conservation. 
  -  A pledge to 
enhance and consolidate the economic liberalization, to 
guarantee macroeconomic stability, to strengthen the productive 
capacity of the private sector. 
  -  To conquer foreign markets and 
make exports one of the pillars of economic growth, the 
disadvantages faced in the labor force, technology, and 
infrastructure will be addressed. 
  -  Elimination of the barriers to 
our competitiveness, beginning with continuation of the tariff 
restructuring. 
  -  The government will not favor any particular 
sector or specific groups, nor will it regard the private 
interests of one segment of society as the engine of economic 
growth. 

<H5>    Education </H5>
<H5>  Cesar Gaviria </H5>

  -  Achieve universal primary education and greatly expand 
secondary education while raising the quality of education at 
all levels. 
  -  Establish a national quality evaluation system for 
primary and secondary education. Provide free textbooks and 
educational materials for all primary school students and 
teaching guides and support materials for teachers. 
  -  An effort 
has begun to modify the structure of scientific and 
technological activities with a view to establishing a national 
science and technology system. Total public spending could reach 
$116 million. 
  -  In accordance with the new standards for 
scientific and technological development, promote the creation 
of employment training programs in the private 
sector. 
  -  Discourage double sessions in public and private schools 
where there is universal attendance. 

<H5>    Ernesto Samper </H5>

  -  A program to strengthen and improve the quality of 
education for the development of the individual and the 
modernization of society. 
  -  Creation and implementation of 
Productivity and Technological Development Centers at the 
sectoral and regional levels. 
  -  A striving to consolidate a 
national scientific base in universities and centers of 
excellence, supporting basic research in strategic 
areas. 
  -  Reinforcement of channels for achieving the transfer of 
technologies that are economically and environmentally 
efficient, and modernization of legislation and procedures for 
registering intellectual property and obtaining patents. 

<H5>    Andres Pastrana </H5>

  -  At present millions of children cannot go to school, but 
by the end of the decade, it will be assured that there will not 
be a single Colombian between the ages of five and 15 who is not 
receiving a basic education. 
  -  Improvement in the quality of 
education, taking development needs into consideration and 
offering children and young adults the educational tools they 
need, synchronizing higher education and technology with the 
demands of our economy. 
  -  Increasing public spending on science 
and technology from the current 0.4 percent of GDP [gross 
domestic product] to 1.5 percent. 
  -  Eliminating double sessions so 
that students will spend less time in the streets. 

<H5>    Water and the Environment </H5>
<H5>  Cesar Gaviria </H5>

  -  Increase, between 1990 and 1994, the national averages for 
the availability of potable water and sewage from 66 percent to 
76 percent for water service and from 51 percent to 57 percent 
for sewage systems. This means bringing water service to nearly 
6 million inhabitants and sewage service to 4 million, and 
attaining international levels of availability. 
  -  As for water 
quality, the objective is to increase potability from 50 percent 
to 100 percent so that all water delivered to the community 
through aqueduct systems is potable. 
  -  Eleven million people do 
not have water service to their homes. 
  -  Design a strategic plan 
for sewage service in the major cities, and begin taking the 
first steps, using efficient technology that can be sustained 
over the long term. 
  -  The government will promote a 10-Year Land 
Management Plan (1991-2000) at a total cost of an estimated 
$1.061 billion. As a result, some 535,500 hectares will be 
improved. 
  -  To conserve the microbasins that supply aqueducts, 
municipalities will be encouraged to purchase the land and use 
it for ecotourism, botanical gardens, and environmental 
education. 
  -  The Forestry Action Plan for Colombia will develop a 
program for the commercial reforestation of at least 110,000 
hectares between 1992 and 1995. 
  -  Although there is no consensus 
on how much land is subject to deforestation, estimates range 
from 360,000 to 600,000 hectares each year. 

<H5>    Ernesto Samper </H5>

  -  There is a need to invest more in land management, 
protection of water sources, and environmental clean-up. 
  -  An 
ambitious environmental education campaign. 
  -  Effective programs 
for pollution control, following the principle that it is 
polluters who must pay. 

<H5>    Andres Pastrana </H5>

  -  By the end of the presidential term, 90 percent of the 
population will have potable water service and at least 80 
percent will have adequate sewage service. 
  -  Eleven million 
Colombians do not have water service. 
  -  Provide incentives for the 
use of unconventional technologies in sewage and waste water 
treatment with a view to preserving our natural resources. 
  -  For 
purposes of soil conservation, promote irrigation and drainage 
policies that will make it possible to incorporate 520,000 new 
hectares of land into farming. 
  -  Promote environmental tourism, 
education, and recreation so that Colombians will all become 
defenders of our most precious natural resources. 
  -  It will be 
necessary to get the business sector involved in an ambitious 
program of reforestation and appropriate development of forestry 
reserves and the timber industry. 
  -  There is indifference while 
600,000 hectares. [as published] 

<H5>    Agriculture and Agroindustry </H5>
<H5>  Cesar Gaviria </H5>

  -  Investment in irrigation and drainage gives the farm 
sector the flexibility it needs to deal with international 
competition. To get the farm sector effectively involved in the 
internationalization of the economy, the government must renew 
investment in additional land management districts. 

<H5>    Ernesto Samper </H5>

  -  Put the countryside to work under our 
Agriculture-Livestock Reconversion Plan. It will enable us to 
overcome critical short-term problems in a lasting way, to 
protect rural employment, and to adapt the sector to the 
changing circumstances of the international market. 
  -  Adoption of 
selective stimuli and stable rules. 
  -  Application of a coffee 
policy oriented toward reducing costs and encouraging 
participation in international marketing. 

<H5>    Andres Pastrana </H5>

  -  The economic liberalization has exposed the weaknesses of 
the agriculture-livestock sector. Farmers are not the only ones 
to blame for the crisis. Now it is up to the government to 
remove obstacles so that we can produce more efficiently and be 
more competitive on the international market. 

<H5>    Infrastructure </H5>
<H5>  Cesar Gaviria </H5>

  -  Cutting costs and thereby increasing efficiency and 
competitiveness will make a major contribution to the country's 
economic development. 
  -  The target network, once completed, will 
cover approximately 6,300 kilometers. This means that during 
this decade, 1,000 kilometers of roads must be built, and 3,770 
kilometers must be improved. 
  -  The rehabilitation plan is aimed at 
rehabilitating 1,606 kilometers of railways between 1991 and 
1995. 

<H5>    Ernesto Samper </H5>

  -  Competitiveness and the rate of expansion of productive 
activities are often limited by deficiencies in the country's 
physical infrastructure in terms of transportation, energy 
supplies, communications, land management, and water 
management. 
  -  Existing options and projects will come under 
detailed scrutiny with a view to selecting those that will have 
the greatest impact on competitiveness and the expansion of our 
productive system, and establishing a rigorous order of priority 
for their execution. 

<H5>    Andres Pastrana </H5>

  -  Deficiencies in communications, roads, and energy raise 
the costs that businesses must pay for products, as well as 
those paid by society, and they make us less competitive. It is 
time we brought our infrastructure up to date. 
  -  Build the first 
750 kilometers of sophisticated freeways and 4,000 kilometers of 
new roads, improve 9,000 kilometers of existing roads, and 
provide adequate maintenance for 70,000 kilometers of 
roads. 
  -  Rehabilitate 1,600 kilometers of railways. 

<H5>    Final Message </H5>
<H5>  Cesar Gaviria </H5>

  -  Upon presenting the National Development Plan, dubbed the 
"Peaceful Revolution," the president and his aides are 
concluding a very arduous intellectual voyage during which they 
have studied problems, debated solutions, compared alternatives, 
and worked out possibilities. 

<H5>    Ernesto Samper </H5>

  -  The challenges of internationalization and development 
require that the government, trade associations, labor unions, 
social organizations, and civil society in its entirety join 
forces to win in international competition and in the struggle 
against economic and social underdevelopment. 

<H5>    Andres Pastrana </H5>

  -  This program is not just the fruit of scientific analysis; 
it is not in vain that I have spent so much time touring the 
country, listening to the people's heartbeat.

  [Text] Not all the present government's actions have 
attracted the same amount of media attention. Actually, some 
have slipped by almost unnoticed. This is true of the reforms 
covering intellectual property, trademarks, and patents. In the 
last two years a group led by the Superintendent of Industry and 
Commerce, Jose Orlando Montealegre, has been modernizing the 
standards and procedures governing intellectual and industrial 
property, a process that has moved Colombia several years 
forward in this field. We need cite just one example: While 
renewing a trademark took an average of 208 weeks in 1992, with 
the present Integrated Industrial Property System it takes only 
three weeks. 
  This computer-based reform has greatly simplified the 
process. The same thing is true of the organizations handling 
patents and trademarks. In 1993, 29,015 trademark applications 
were published, while in 1992 the number was just 3,093. The 
time required to process a patent application has been cut from 
an average of 60 months to just 24. In the same way, registering 
a trademark, which used to take a massive length of time--40 
months--can now be done in 120 days. Industry has been quick to 
take advantage of this improvement: last year 13,270 trademark 
registrations and over 800 industrial patent applications were 
filed. 
  The improvements in this area are not limited just to 
computerizing the proceedings. In more substantive aspects, a 
great leap forward has been made, leaving behind over two 
decades of protectionist legislation. The most significant 
advance for Colombia and the Andean Group countries was Decision 
344 of the Cartagena Pact Commission, which brings intellectual 
property legislation into line with GATT's international 
standards and with regulations prevailing in more highly 
developed nations. 
  The decision includes some innovative features like the 
patentability of biotechnology, which differs from essentially 
biological processes used to obtain animal breeds and species. 
Furthermore, it allows the registration of patents for 
inventions related to nuclear and fissionable materials, and 
opens up an immediate possibility of patenting pharmaceutical 
products. It sets a 20-year term for all patents, eliminates the 
system of extensions, and strengthens legal protections for 
intellectual property in business. And in the area of 
trademarks, it ratifies the majority of the provisions now in 
force, simplifies registration procedures, and grants greater 
protection to well-known trademarks. 
  Perhaps the most attractive aspect of this reform is the 
adoption of the new industrial secrets system, which was 
nonexistent before. Although the text of this change is general 
in nature, it establishes protection for industrial secrets, 
which are defined as information not known or easily obtainable 
about productive activities that have an actual or potential 
commercial value, information which is held secret and 
consisting of documents or any other physical form of 
information storage. This will help to attract foreign 
investors--who have traditionally been reluctant to set up 
operations in countries where their rights are not fully 
protected--and allow the transfer of foreign technology. 
  Because of all this, Colombia has now become a model in 
Latin 
America for intellectual and industrial property. Its 
computerized handling of these matters has drawn praise from 
WIPO [World Intellectual Property Organization], and offers have 
been made to export this software to Brazil and to the rest of 
the Andean Pact member nations. In the eyes of businessmen, 
Colombia now offers its investors legal protection. An avalanche 
of new patents may well be seen this year.

<F P=106> [Article by Gala Marcela Pena and Raimundo Alvarado] </F>
  [Text] Cienaga, Magdalena Department--What should have been 
a blessing for Cienaga--some of the best land in the world for 
cash crops such as bananas and African palms, ports capable of 
serving the large-scale mining industry, a variety of climates 
thanks to the Sierra Nevada, and an enviable geographic 
position--is turning out to be a curse. 
  Not only is this area plagued with the factors of violence 
that have hit the whole country--subversives with an urban wing, 
paramilitarism, drug trafficking, hired gunmen, land piracy, and 
family feuds--but municipal and departmental authorities are 
literally paralyzed by the lack of resources for carrying out 
social programs to deal with the poverty that is overwhelming 
the residents of the department capital (some 100,000) and of 
the 30 districts or hamlets (70,000). 
  Along the highway between Cienaga and Santa Marta, drivers 
are waylaid and robbed about 10 times a week; and since the 
1960's, the Sierra Nevada, which encompasses Cienaga, has been a 
center for the cultivation of marijuana, and more recently, coca 
and poppies. These activities, as is always the case, have led 
to violence. 
  This situation prompted the inspector general of the Army, 
General Juan Salcedo Lora, to say about three weeks ago that 
"this is one of the most troubled areas in the country." 
  The municipal jurisdiction has a paltry annual budget of 5 
billion pesos. It has no capacity to contract debts, and is 
running a deficit of 1.2 billion pesos. 
  Mayor Victor Dangond Noguera, in view of this difficult 
plight, is calling for a societal response. "It is not just a 
problem of armed individuals," he says, "it is a question of 
investment, of state presence, of absolute abandonment." 
  In general, public efforts in this department have borne 
little fruit. Governor Miguel Pinedo Vidal blames the national 
government. He says that all local residents see is the work of 
foundations set up by some banana growers and marketers, who 
have invested about 750 million pesos in recent years and have 
brought in additional state investment amounting to 450 million 
pesos to improve essential services and housing in towns such as 
Varela, Orihueca, and Rio Frio. But these are mere bandaids in 
the face of needs that require an estimated 35 billion pesos in 
investments. 
  In Pinedo's view, "Cienaga is going through one of its worst 
moments because of subversion and common crime, but above all 
because of a widespread moral crisis. Every day we see how crime 
is proliferating." 
  And the director of the local office of the Administrative 
Department of Security (DAS), Mario Mejia, observes that many 
crimes are not connected, but are isolated incidents. In 
particular, those committed against political leaders--five have 
been murdered in the last four months--have caused the most 
anxiety. The council feels so threatened that it does not meet. 
  In Cienaga and the rural area surrounding it, nine people 
are 
killed every 10 days. The victims are landowners, 
administrators, agronomists, workers, civic leaders, people 
passing through the area, and of course, the members of the 10 
crime rings known to be operating throughout the region. The 
latter tend to have their headquarters here, particularly in the 
El Polvorin neighborhood, where it is very difficult to get a 
taxi driver to help you find an address. 
  Other personal and property crimes have proliferated, as 
well. In the capital, even the tavern on the town square was 
closed down for lack of customers. In Cienaga people now go to 
bed early. 
  Fear means that the law of silence prevails, and few believe 
that the authorities really investigate crimes, since there is 
so much impunity. The fear is so widespread that officials of 
the Investigative Unit of the Prosecutor General's Office refuse 
to go to the banana-growing region for any activities unless 
they are guaranteed adequate protection, and that protection 
must become "more and more adequate." 
  The commander of the Army's First Division, General Rodolfo 
Torrado Quintero, whose office is only 15 kilometers from the 
area, demanded greater cooperation so that his 800 men and some 
200 police officers could operate more effectively. "We are 
willing to do our duty. But we can do nothing if people do not 
cooperate, report crimes, or provide information. Without 
cooperation we can accomplish practically nothing," he says. 
  Even the Catholic Church is losing ground in the area, which 
covers some 112,000 hectares, 18,000 of which consist of banana 
plantations, because new Protestant sects are displacing it in 
all of these areas of misery and despair. The population has 
skyrocketed in these places over the last three years, due to 
the highly publicized boom and the cotton crisis. But the boom 
was neutralized by the European Economic Community's 
restrictions and by Hurricane Brett last August. 
  The only health clinics are in Rio Frio, Orihueca, El 
Reposo, 
and Guacamayal, and the doctors come every two weeks. These are 
the only towns with schools, as well. 
  None of the streets or roads are paved, and communication 
between towns is limited. To serve 70,000 people there is only 
one telephone in the entire area of Orihueca. 
  On a tour of the region, not a single police officer was to 
be seen, but soldiers were seen patrolling (the Cordova 
Battalion is based in the town of Santa Rosalia). They must deal 
with about 300 guerrillas of the Coordinating Committee, who 
camp in the most rugged parts of the Sierra Nevada and come down 
to fish in these troubled waters. According to Governor Pinedo, 
"We are becoming more like Uraba each day."

<H5>  Little Has Been Done </H5>
  National Planning took the lead in promulgating the Social 
Action Plan for the Banana Region (Pasban), which earmarked 2.6 
billion pesos for projects in the 30 banana-growing towns, to be 
carried out by the two private foundations that operate here 
(Fundeban and Fundauniban), the municipal jurisdiction of 
Cienaga, the Agrarian Fund, Findeter, and the community. 
  The Pasban was supposed to be implemented over a two-year 
period beginning in June 1992. But since the state 
agencies--with the exception of the Agrarian Fund--have not come 
through, most of the burden has fallen on the shoulders of the 
two foundations. Moreover, they have had to carry out the 
procedures that municipal and departmental authorities were 
supposed to transact with the national agencies, because 
National Planning also abandoned them. 
  Sixty-nine small construction and renovation projects have 
been completed under the auspices of the Pasban at health 
clinics, schools, electrification facilities, cemeteries, 
chapels, aqueducts, and playing fields. The investment amounts 
to approximately 1.2 billion pesos. 
  The Solidarity and Social Emergency Fund (Foses) has just 
pledged with Fundauniban to contribute 208 million pesos for 
aqueducts in La Gran Via, Reposo-Aguja, El Salon, Soplador, and 
Palomar.

<H5>  Murders Prompt Work Stoppage Yesterday </H5>
  Yesterday, to protest the murder of five members of the 
Trade 
Union of Workers in the Agriculture Industry (Sintrainagro), 
banana workers stopped cutting and packing the fruit in the 
Magdalena banana region and blocked the road from Cienaga to 
Fundacion. 
  The killings occurred at the entrance to the La Ceiba 
plantation, owned by the Compania Frutera de Sevilla, in La 
Esquina Caliente in the district of La Gran Via (Cienaga). The 
victims were Juan Jose Tapias Hernandez, 39; Jairo Francisco 
Villa, 35; Auden Quintero Plata, 38; Jose Antonio Torres Zuniga, 
25; and Robinson Caballero, 41. 
  At 0530, 10 armed men in a red Daihatsu jeep with tinted 
windows stopped a group of laborers who were traveling in a 
"gondola" (a cart pulled by a tractor or an ox). "They had Galil 
rifles, submachineguns, and 9 mm. pistols. They called the 
workers by name, referring to a list they had, and then they 
shot them," stated a witness. 
  When news of the killings spread, residents of Varela and 
Santa Rosalia (where the victims lived) gathered and began 
burning tires, painting the slogan "Down with the `Paras'" on 
cars, and demanding justice. 
  The general secretary of Sintrainagro, Alfonso Maiguel 
Guerrero, was murdered in his home on 14 February. 
  Yesterday's work stoppage affected some 65 plantations, and 
forced a temporary halt in exports. 
  Magdalena Governor Miguel Pinedo Vidal sent a letter to 
President Cesar Gaviria urging him to give attention to "this 
area, which is practically becoming another Uraba." 
  According to Pinedo, "Two developments have disturbed the 
communities in this department: The first was tropical storm 
Brett, which flattened 6,000 hectares, and you did not even 
bother to send a message of solidarity." 
  The second is the violence that has brought tension to an 
area "that used to be peaceful in other times. Today it is 
gripped by murder, extortion, and blackmail by organized crime 
and all kinds of other criminals."

  [Text] Lima, 31 Mar (EFE) -- Peruvian congressman Alexander 
Kouri of the Popular Christian Party (PPC) today regretted the 
declarations made by General Humberto Ordonez, chief of the 
Ecuadoran 1st Army Division, who called for the recovery "with 
the use of arms" of the Peruvian Amazon territory claimed by 
Ecuador. 
  Kouri rejected Gen. Ordonez' comments and noted the quick 
answer from Ecuadoran Foreign Minister Diego Paredes, who said 
the general's reaction "is part of the pressure from some 
Ecuadoran political groups seeking to gain support for the 
upcoming partial renewal of the Ecuadoran Congress." 
  "There is no territorial problem with Ecuador," said Kouri, 
who pointed out that any debate on this issue should be made 
based on the Rio Protocol, which in 1942 established the borders 
between the two countries after a war in 1941. 
  Ordonez' declarations "do not deserve an answer," said 
Kouri, 
who added that now Ecuador does not recognize the Rio Protocol, 
saying that it is not "applicable." 
  Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori said on 30 March that 
Peru should welcome Ecuadoran Presidnt Sixto Duran Ballen "with 
open arms." 
  In relation to the new postponement of Duran Ballen's visit, 
President Fujimori, who is in Pucallpa in Peru's central jungle 
region, said: "I presume there are reasons preventing him from 
coming and we understand it." 
  "He, Sixto Duran, will find the most appropriate date; let 
us 
wait for him with open arms," reiterated Fujimori, who added 
that relations between the two countries are at the highest 
level. 
  The comments by the Ecuadoran general also were criticized 
by 
another congressman, Manuel Moreyra, of the opposition 
Solidarity and Democracy, who said the Peruvian Government has 
handled its relations with Ecuador badly. 
  He said the government made the mistake of making Ecuadorans 
believe "the country can give up part of its territory. We are 
now paying the consequences of the bad management of our foreign 
relations." 
  "What should have been said from the beginning is that Peru 
will not give up a single centimeter of its territory," said 
Moreyra, thus agreeing with Kouri that Ordonez' comments do not 
deserve an answer. 
  Foreign Relations Committee President Oswaldo Sandoval, from 
the government alliance Change 90-New Majority, said the new 
postponement of President Duran Ballen's visit to Peru is the 
result of internal political problems in Ecuador. 
  "It is not a final postponement," said Sandoval, who 
expressed his hope that the Ecuadoran president will visit Peru 
before the end of 1994 in answer to the three visits made by 
Fujimori to Ecuador. 
  He also added that Duran Ballen's visit to Peru is important 
to strengthen the links between the two countries.

  [Text] The Ministry of the Presidency reported yesterday 
that the government will begin projects to stop the progress of 
poppy cultivation, which increased last year in the departments 
of Amazonas, San Martin, and Huanuco, among others. 
  It has been reported that the sawmill of Santa Maria de 
Nieva, which is under the Jaen Apostolic Vicariate, will be 
reactivated. The reactivation plan also includes the Huaquilla 
mining settlement in the San Ignacio forest, which is up for 
bidding by the Privatization Committee for exploitation by the 
private sector. 
  Priority will also be given to the Mangunchay irrigation 
project and to another sawmill in the San Ignacio forest, which 
is located in the provinces of Jaen and San Ignacio de Cajamarca. 
  According to the Ministry of the Presidency, these projects 
are aimed at giving work to thousands of people who for lack of 
work are motivated to cultivate poppies. 
  According to a report published by this newspaper last 
month, 
poppy cultivation is increasing dangerously. There is 
information that there are small plantations in San Ignacio, 
Jaen, and Bambamarca in Cajamarca. 
  There are also plantations in Huancabamba, Piura; in Bagua 
and Condorcanqui, Amazonas; and in several towns in San Martin 
Department, where cultivation has spread rapidly over the last 
few years in Nueva Cajamarca, Rioja, Soritor, and in the valleys 
of Mayo, Sisa, and Biabo. 
  Outside the northern mountain range, the poppy grows in 
Sarampampa, Ayacucho Department. 
  The Ministry of the Presidency pointed out that the 
government will put into operation the reforestation of forests 
burned by farmers. This work will be done by the Japanese 
Tropical Wood International Organization and by the National 
Institute of Natural Resources (Inrena). 
  The Ministry of the Presidency admitted the imminent danger 
of the poppy, from which opium, morphine, and heroin are taken. 
This is why the government decided to stop poppy cultivation in 
northern Peru "before it becomes a chronic disease and the coca 
cartels escaping from Upper Huallaga settle down there." 
  The ministry said that according to the draft project of the 
National Plan for Drug Prevention and Control, prepared by the 
special commission headed by General Arnaldo Velarde Ramirez, 
retired, "there are worrisome indications about the starting up 
of poppy cultivations in various parts of the national 
territory, encouraged by foreign interests linked to the heroin 
circuit." 
  The Ministry of the Presidency also said: "Hunger in that 
zone is so great that the poppy cultivations are gradually 
gaining more followers. The population is already urgently 
asking for private investment, and demanding from the government 
clear rules for sustainable forest development, forcing loggers 
to do reforestation work with a plan guaranteeing there will 
always be a forest." 
  Poppy grows in the same ecosystem as coca, but offers 
greater 
agro-economic advantages. 
  While cocaine base (the basic element for making cocaine) 
costs from $120 to $150 per kilogram, opium latex (the basic 
element for making heroin) costs $1,000 per kilogram. 
  Poppies grow under the same weather conditions as coca, 
giving better results at from 1,500 to 2,500 meters above sea 
level with cool temperatures of 10 to 20 degrees centigrade. 
  Regarding quantity and what could be called quality, poppies 
produce a greater volume of opium, which is of better quality 
among cultivations at high altitudes. 
  Poppies are planted from October to December to take 
advantage of the rainy season, and can also be planted in July 
and August. The planting is done by "throwing" the seeds onto 
the field.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Peru monitored through 31 
March. 
  The executive branch approved through Supreme Decree No. 
07-94-RE an agreement with the ROK Government on investments 
promotion and protection. This ratifies an agreement signed in 
June 1993 in Seoul. (Lima EL PERUANO in Spanish 21 Mar 94 p B2) 
  Three new banks, the Solventa Bank, the Labor Bank, and the 
El Libertador Bank, are awaiting the Banking and Insurance 
Superintendency's authorization to begin operations in Peru. 
The new banks are supported by Chilean investors. (Lima EL 
PERUANO in Spanish 21 Mar 94 p A1) 
  One year after recommencing exploratory drilling activities 
in the jungle, Petroperu, State Petroleum Agency, again struck 
oil in lot No. 8 of the Pavayacu and Chambira projects, with a 
daily production rate of 6,000 barrels of oil. Lot No. 8 is 
located in the northwestern region of the Amazon basin. The 
Pavayacu discovery in lot No. 147D will allow the extraction of 
4,000 barrels of oil daily while the Chambira discovery in lot 
No. 123XCD will allow the extraction of 2,000 barrels of oil 
daily. Four companies operating on the continental shelf, the 
northern off-shore area, and the jungle, are producing about 
130,000 barrels of oil daily while the consumption rate totals 
150,000 barrels of oil daily. In the 1970's, daily oil 
production totaled 200,000 barrels. (Lima LA REPUBLICA in 
Spanish 22 Mar 94 p 5) 
  Manuel Vasquez Perales, the Financial Development 
Corporation 
board of directors chairman, announced on 18 March that two 
credit lines totaling $115 million have been approved for this 
year. A $90 million credit line was secured from the Andean 
Development Corporation for small- and medium-size enterprises. 
A $25 million credit line will be used to support the 
transformation of private companies and companies being 
privatized. (Lima LA REPUBLICA in Spanish 19 Mar 94 p 3) 
  The World Bank on 19 March announced the approval of a $150 
million loan for Peru to finance a transportation reconditioning 
project for highways. (Lima EL COMERCIO in Spanish 19 Mar 94 p 
1) 
  Southern Peru Copper Corporation, SPCC, secured a $50 
million 
loan from Japan's Mitsui and Co. Ltd. for a $300 million SPCC 
investment program to increase copper production and improve 
SPCC operations with an emphasis on environmental protection.

    [Editorial Report] Panama City Television Networks in 
Spanish at 0100 GMT on 29 March broadcast a live two-hour debate 
with six Panamanian presidential candidates. The debate, 
sponsored by the Latin American Institute of Advanced Studies 
(ILDEA) and the Media Committee for Presidential Debates, is 
moderated by Fernando Berguido and features the following 
presidential candidates: Ernesto Perez Balladares of the 
Revolutionary Democratic Party (PRD); Eduardo Vallarino Arjona 
of the Christian Democratic Party (PDC); Ruben Dario Carles of 
the Change '94 Alliance; Samuel Lewis Galindo of the Solidarity 
Party (PS); Jose Salvador Munoz Correa of the Panamenist 
Doctrinaire Party (PPD); and Ruben Blades of the Papa Egoro 
Movement (MPE). 
  Following a brief statement by ILDEA President Rodrigo 
Eisenmann, moderator Berguido explains the rules of the debate 
and reads a short biography on each of the six candidates 
present. 
  The debate gets under way with PRD Candidate Ernesto Perez 
Balladares discussing his public expenditures program: "Clearly, 
any attempt to try to refer to the 1970's and objectively 
compare the decade to the 1990's would be dubious. During the 
1970's, we had an international financial liquidity situation 
because of an oversupply of crude oil revenues. In turn, this 
situation prompted the financial institutions as well as banks 
to implement easy credit policies. This gave us the opportunity 
to carry out public investments and, at the same time, to create 
more employment. In addition, not only did public investments 
increase, but the state's payroll also increased. 
  "Obviously, the conditions of the 1970's are not the same as 
those we are experiencing in 1994. Therefore, it would be 
impossible to repeat that experience, and, even if we wanted to 
-- which certainly is not the case -- we would not be able to 
because the sources of financing simply are not as accessible as 
in the past. 
  ``What we have to do in 1994 is domestically create a 
competitive climate that will encourage private firms to invest 
and create the jobs all Panamanians need. In this respect, we 
have proposed a parallel public investment program that can be 
financed jointly with the private sector and will result in 
direct employment. For example, we have already outlined plans 
for construction projects, such as highway construction -- 
particularly along the Panama-Colon highway -- as well as other 
specific public investments projects. These activities are 
urgently needed to ensure national development and also to 
create new jobs.'' 
  The debate continues with PDC candidate Eduardo Vallarino 
contending that the country's infrastructure is in such a poor 
state because of the restrictive spending programs of the past 
25 years, and particularly of the past five years when the 
Endara administration decided to curtail capital improvement 
expenditures. Vallarino says that although he agrees there are 
budget constraints because of external debt pressures, he also 
believes there are other options available to overcome this 
situation. With respect to road work, other Latin American 
countries' experiences have demonstrated that highways can be 
built through privatization efforts, which include transferring 
highway management rights to the private sector. 
  In commenting on the current state of the Social Security 
Fund (CSS), Change '94 candidate Ruben Dario Carles says he 
believes that the CSS must be restructured if the institution is 
going to survive. 
  PPD candidate Jose Salvador Munoz blames the nation's 
unemployment problems on the ever-increasing external debt 
pressure, which he says curtails investments; a United 
States-led invasion that practically destroyed the country; and 
policy issues that were never addressed by the previous 
administration. He disagrees with the proposal that the 
country's employment needs should be left entirely to the 
private sector because the state is the only sector that can 
create employment in the near term. 
  Meanwhile, PS candidate Samuel Lewis Galindo believes the 
current administration has been quite insensitive to fulfilling 
the lower income groups' most basic needs and that the 
government has been more interested in repaying the foreign debt 
than with improving the living conditions of the lower income 
groups. Nevertheless, he agrees that the nation should not 
forfeit on its foreign debt obligations. 
  In commenting on Panama's role in a world in which 
globalization is the dominant trend, MPE candidate Ruben Blades 
says: "First of all, I believe it is necessary for us to 
pinpoint concrete objectives and strategies. As long as we fail 
to do this, I believe that any decision related to our joining 
agreements such as GATT or NAFTA cannot be taken seriously. We 
must first determine what Panama's role is going to be once the 
country has joined these treaties. Specifically, I believe that 
joining GATT is going to have a negative impact on the country 
if we do not first consult all sectors involved and if we do not 
determine what the advantages to the country are going to be. 
As a nation, we stand to lose certain comparative advantages 
once services are standardized. 
  "In this respect we should look at the banking sector. We 
still do not know exactly what we are getting into. It is not 
only a matter of turning Panama into a market for other 
products, but we must protect our products." Blades continues 
by saying Panama must know "what we are getting into" before 
agreeing to join GATT or NAFTA. He adds: "We are recommending 
that Panama first determine which sectors can be developed as 
export industries before joining any treaty that would lead to 
the globalization of the economy." 
  With respect to CSS services, PRD candidate Ernesto Perez 
Balladares believes CSS members should be given the option to 
decide which social security program they wish to join. The 
debate continues with PDC candidate Eduardo Vallarino expressing 
his dissatisfaction with the "inefficiency" in which public 
funds are being spent, because most are being funneled into 
simply maintaining the bureaucracy. 
  In response to the question of whether Panama should become 
a member of NAFTA, candidate Ruben Carles says: "We must first 
consider our position with regard to GATT before we decide 
whether or not to join NAFTA. Nevertheless, we still have to 
settle certain issues with GATT. How can GATT attempt to 
liberalize trade while imposing trade restrictions on the 
bananas produced in Panama and the rest of Central America? Our 
question is this: How can you gentlemen of GATT talk of 
liberalizing trade while imposing restrictions on poor 
banana-producing countries?" 
  Carles goes on to question GATT's desire to sell its 
industrial products in Panama while placing import limits on the 
region's agricultural products, and he adds that his government 
would protect Panamanian workers, especially those who produce 
foodstuffs such as meat, corn, rice, beans, onions, tomatoes, 
and milk. 
  Candidate Jose Salvador Munoz is asked to explain his views 
on development and the roles the state and private sector should 
play in this development. Munoz says Panama's economy must 
undergo a shake-up. He says: "The Panamanian state must, out of 
necessity, make an initial investment in infrastructure -- 
namely schools, highways, and hospitals -- to generate the 
confidence, jobs, and money that are needed to make the economy 
function once again. Once this is done, the private sector can 
address the rest of the problems." 
  When asked to outline his tax, spending, and investment 
policies, candidate Lewis Galindo says the government is short 
of funds and that the tax collection system must be improved. 
Nevertheless, he says he does not favor an increase in taxes or 
the creation of new taxes. Instead, he would perfect the tax 
collection system. Galindo says: "The private sector and the 
state must seek mechanisms with which to create a climate 
favorable to investments, which will create better health 
services, jobs, housing, and education for the Panamanian 
people." 
  Candidate Ruben Blades is asked to comment on Panama's high 
unemployment rate despite its economic growth and to outline the 
specific steps he would take to provide permanent employment. 
He says: "Panama has had an unemployment problem for many 
decades, many years. It is the result of not having conducted 
provincial-level studies to establish the natural and human 
resources available in each province. Once these provincial 
inventories -- which I advocate -- are conducted, we will truly 
understand our country's potential and we will know which areas 
to develop." Blades goes on to explain that unemployment comes 
in various stages -- short-term, midterm, and long-term. He 
agrees with Munoz that the government must invest in the 
nation's infrastructure, and he adds that a job market should be 
created for women. 
  Candidate Ernesto Perez Balladares follows by discussing the 
solutions he would offer Panama Canal employees laid off when 
the U.S. bases in Panama close. Perez says the military bases 
are not an economic issue but a military one. He says that the 
bases were once needed in Panama and elsewhere, but they are now 
being closed because they are no longer necessary. "Numerous 
former military installations that were going to be closed will 
be reverted to Panama, the Torrijos-Carter treaties 
notwithstanding. Of course the treaties mandate their closure 
because they are no longer needed by the United States, which 
established them here in the first place. I believe the 
Panamanian people as a group must now face the challenge of 
turning those sites into sources of national wealth through 
investments and industry to generate skilled manpower for 
well-paid permanent jobs and especially to produce industrial 
and manufactured goods that can be exported." 
  Candidate Eduardo Vallarino is then asked what he would do 
to 
retain approximately 20 percent of the Panama Canal Commission's 
employees, most of whom hold key positions and who will retire 
on 31 December 1999 under the U.S. federal retirement system. 
Vallarino says the answer is simple because the people in 
question are Panamanians who will retire early, but who will 
have the knowledge and experience their country needs. "I see 
no reason why the Panamanian Government, through the Panama 
Canal Authority, cannot extend their contracts." 
  Returning to Carles, moderator Berguido asks what solutions 
his government would set forth to prevent the continued 
deforestation of the Panama Canal Zone. Carles responds: "The 
Panamanian people must understand that environmental protection 
is a priority. I have already announced in various parts of the 
country that my government platform includes a reforestation 
program that will be duly financed." Carles gives assurances 
that the reforestation sector will not be left without resources 
to conduct its work. He says: "Reforestation is necessary to 
conserve our waterways, all human life, farming, cattlebreeding, 
and canal operations. Without water there can be no Canal." 
  Jose Munoz is asked what steps his government would adopt 
to take greater advantage of the Canal. Munoz replies by saying 
that current Canal policy must undergo a shake-up, just as the 
economy must be shaken up. "Gentlemen," he says, "the Panama 
Canal is ours, but unfortunately we have not trained any 
employees for administrative positions. I believe that nearly 
7,000 Panamanians are employed by the Canal Commission, but the 
administrative positions are only filled by North Americans and 
third-country nationals. This must change." 
  Candidate Lewis Galindo is asked to express his views 
concerning the Canal's efficiency, cost effectiveness, and 
transit rates in light of the competition that exists worldwide 
in the field of transportation. Lewis Galindo says that almost 
90 percent of the Canal workforce is Panamanian, adding that 
when Panamanians take over all of the administrative positions, 
efficiency will increase because they will be working for their 
country. "The Canal will make the transition from being the 
political institution that it is for the United States to an 
entirely commercial undertaking for Panama," Lewis said. 
  Candidate Ruben Blades is quick to point out that the 
reversion of the Panama Canal is a very serious problem. He 
says the Endara government, as well as previous governments, 
should have started the transition process "as soon as the ink 
on the treaties dried." Blades explains that since 1978, Panama 
has failed to do the things it should have. "On the other 
hand," he adds, "the United States, through Law 90-76, greatly 
distorted the initial purpose of the treaties. This law was 
presented by Messrs. John Murphy and Robert Bowman, two 
Republican congressmen, because the signing of a treaty does not 
authorize its execution; a law is required. The two gentlemen 
disagreed with the treaty negotiations and they presented the 
law, which has completely hindered the transition." My 
government, Blades adds, "will stand up to the United States. 
We will deal with Law 90-76, which is hindering the return of 
our Canal." 
  Candidate Perez Balladares is then asked a question on how 
to 
overcome the problems of a sluggish government bureaucracy and 
red tape. He says that the efficiency of state bureaucracy 
depends on the person at the helm. "I believe our efficiency 
can be enhanced by some form of protection; a law that makes 
government employees feel that their work is acknowledged, that 
ensures they will be well paid and that they will not be pawns 
in the country's political ups and downs." Regarding foreign 
investment, Perez Balladares says that an office will be 
established within the Presidency to handle government 
contracts. This office, he says, also will deal with local 
investors who want to procure government contracts. 
  Candidate Eduardo Vallarino is asked if his government is 
contemplating the construction of a Panama-Chiriqui highway, 
and, if so, how it would be financed. Vallarino says a 
transisthmian highway in western Chiriqui would be much better 
because Panama is an interoceanic country. His government, he 
explained, would take advantage of this geographic fact. 
Vallarino also endorses a Colon-Penonome highway, which would 
give all of the central provinces direct access to European and 
U.S. markets. As for the financing of these highways, he says 
this can be resolved by granting concessions to private 
companies to manage the highways. Vallarino blames Panama's 
unemployment on "a lack of investments prompted by poor economic 
policies, not only by the previous PRD government but by the 
current government, which has not invested sufficiently." 
  Candidate Ruben Carles is asked to respond to the 
authorities' neglect of Panama's historical sites and to explain 
his plans to deal with this situation. Carles answers by 
discussing the efforts of former Mayor Mayin Correa, who he 
hopes will return to City Hall, and Panama's potential for 
tourism. Carles says: "I have already spoken with some of the 
leading tourism firms, perhaps the top cruise lines, so that as 
soon as I am in a position to negotiate with them they can make 
specific proposals for intensive tourism development in Panama, 
on both the Pacific and Atlantic coasts." Carles goes on to 
explain that many shipping companies are willing to operate in 
Panama if the government can guarantee security, efficiency, and 
public services. 
  When asked how a PPD government would educate people to 
help them deal with a global economy, candidate Jose Salvador 
Munoz says his party will revolutionize education in Panama, 
which has been "neglected for an entire generation." 
  The moderator then asks Samuel Lewis Galindo about his plans 
to have the private sector invest in low-cost housing. The 
candidate answers by saying the 1972 laws which placed ceilings 
on rent must be revised and that existing housing must be 
improved, particularly in very poor neighborhoods. 
  To improve the effectiveness of the Public Force and the 
Technical Judicial Police, Ruben Blades says his party will give 
priority to public security because improved security is an 
essential requirement for investment. To do this, however, the 
root of the problem -- "that is to say, the lack of opportunity, 
overcrowding, and a criminal subculture" -- must be attacked. 
The situation will not be resolved by building larger prisons, 
he says. The police must be given adequate equipment, training, 
and leadership, and their salaries must be raised. 
  In discussing the legislature, candidate Ernesto Perez 
Balladares says: "We will explore the possibility of eliminating 
the position of substitute legislators, as has been done in 
other countries, because the position inflates the number of 
Assembly members and creates too much political pressure." He 
also says democracy entails many expenses, such as the salaries 
of lawmakers. He pledges to introduce legislation to eliminate 
substitute legislator positions and the privilege whereby 
legislators are permitted to import luxury cars tax free. 
  Discussing the demarcation of Indian regions, candidate 
Eduardo Vallarino says he has visited the Indians in the 
interior and that he agrees completely with the demarcation of 
these areas because Indians deserve the government's support. 
  Candidate Ruben Dario Carles says he will eliminate the 
inefficiency prevailing in the Department of Metropolitan 
Sanitation by assigning greater responsibility to municipalities 
in garbage disposal. He adds that privatization of this service 
could provide a better solution on a long-term basis. 
  Asked about his government's plans to resolve the problem of 
sewage being dumped into the sea and rivers, Munoz says "a 
drastic solution" is required, adding that the problem is not 
limited to sewage in Panama City but includes other population 
centers as well. 
  Regarding environmental pollution and the next generation's 
right to clean air, candidate Lewis Galindo says his 
administration would emphasize environmental education. He also 
says the number of cars must be controlled and other measures 
must be taken. 
  The moderator then asks Ruben Blades about the problem of 
deforestation. Blades answers that it is necessary to teach the 
people who cut down trees that they are doing great harm to the 
nation. He adds that the problem is closely associated with the 
slash-and-burn method used by peasants in Panama. 
  In the closing round of the debate, the candidates are given 
an opportunity to comment on the other candidates' remarks or 
give a final message. Perez Balladares speaks first, 
summarizing the positions he outlined earlier in the debate. He 
ends by saying he has no doubts that Panama will turn concern 
for the future into new opportunities for the Panamanian people. 
  Vallarino gives his final message next, saying he has 
observed that the Panamanian people are tired of traditional 
politicians and the same old promises. He says he is no 
traditional politician and that he will work hard to enable more 
Panamanians to have jobs. He finally invites people to vote for 
the best candidate in the 8 May elections. 
  In his final statement, Carles begins by saying this debate 
is not a debate in the true sense of the word. He adds that his 
party has outlined specific proposals designed to restore 
credibility to the state's management of finances. He concludes 
by saying: "I will continue to act honestly, responsibly, and 
firmly, as I have done all my life, apart from government and 
interventionist schemes that have failed, that have plunged the 
country into indebtedness, that have increased joblessness and 
corruption, and that have led the country into chaos. I will 
stimulate private initiative to create jobs. The Pamananian 
people's standard of living will be improved through more jobs 
and better public services. This country, particularly the 
young people, are entitled to a brighter future. This can be 
done with willingness, capability, experience, energy, and the 
determination to do things right. This is what my government 
will offer." 
  Jose Salvador Munoz gives his closing message next: 
"Tonight I have spoken about a shake-up; this is not a drastic 
or an arbitrary measure. What we are trying to do is eliminate 
unemployment, corruption, lack of security, and other monsters 
that are always plotting against the Panamanian nation. I ask 
for your vote so that you can help me kill these monsters and 
create a shake-up to achieve a better country." 
  Candidate Samuel Lewis Galindo ends by saying: "I do not see 
myself as a politician and I have not been a professional 
politician. I have worked in private enterprise for 45 years, 
developing and creating business enterprises, as well as 
creating jobs for thousands of Panamanians. I want to offer 
this experience to the Panamanian state because a change is 
necessary." 
  The last to speak is Ruben Blades, who explains he comes 
from 
a family that never lost hope in the future and that he has 
worked very hard to make a living. Blades adds, "Hopefully, we 
are trying to create a common ground by way of the Papa Egoro 
Movement. There are some who tell me that we do not have much 
experience in politics. I tell them we do have experience, but 
only as victims of the process." Blades then says: "We are 
truly offering the opportunity to justify our right, as a 
nation, to place our hope in the field of politics." He 
concludes by saying, "I am a politician out of self-defense. I 
hope that on 8 May you will not forget us."

    [Editorial report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on developments related to the elections scheduled for 8 
May 1994. 
  A Marketing Ideas poll taken in Panama City for EL SIGLO 
puts 
Ernesto Perez Balladares, presidential candidate of the 
Democratic Revolutionary Party [PRD], in the lead with the 
support of 26.1 percent of respondents. Following closely is 
Change 94 Coalition candidate Ruben Carles with 24 percent. 
Papa Egoro Movement candidate Ruben Blades has remained stable 
with 13.2 percent; the rating of Arnulfista Party candidate 
Mireya Moscoso de Gruber has increased to 11.2 percent, and 
Christian Democratic Party [PDC] candidate Eduardo Vallarino's 
rating increased to 9.2 percent. The ratings of candidates 
Samuel Lewis and Salvador Munoz have not changed significantly. 
(Panama City EL SIGLO in Spanish (supplement) 17 March 94 p 8) 
  Electoral Tribunal President Eduardo Valdes has confirmed 
candidacies contested at the tribunal over the next few days 
will not delay the elections. Valdes has said the tribunal has 
already hired almost all of the 42,000 people who will work as 
voting officers, voting board members, supervisors, inspectors 
and coordinators during the 8 May elections. (Panama City 
Telemetro Television Network in Spanish 1730 GMT 19 March 94) 
  Ruben Blades says his popularity is still increasing. 
Blades, who has campaigned in various sectors of Panama City, 
said his campaign is going well, and he refused to comment on 
the other candidates, saying it would be in poor taste to do so. 
Blades has said: "Now that the campaign is in full swing, the 
people are reacting positively. As I have said before, the 
other candidates began their campaigns much earlier, but I have 
taken to the streets now, and the people have greeted me 
warmly." (Panama City Telemetro Television Network in Spanish 
1730 GMT 19 March 94) 
  During a tour of Rio Abajo Corregimiento, Ruben Carles urged 
Panamanians to preserve democracy He said the Torrijos-Carter 
Treaties legalize the presence of U.S. bases in Panama. Carles 
said: "I will make every effort to maintain certain U.S. Army 
bases, which have been legally authorized to remain in Panama by 
the neutrality treaty, particularly by the de Concini clause, 
which Omar Torrijos accepted, confirmed, and approved when he 
signed the treaty at a ceremony in Washington, saying he was 
placing Panama under the Pentagon's umbrella." (Panama City 
Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 22 March 94) 
  Ruben Carles has campaigned in the neighborhood of La Boca 
Town, Rio Abajo, Panama City, where he suffered a slight injury 
inside an old building that caved in under the weight of the 
crowd. Carles responded to the situation by saying: "The 
accident occurred due to the building's poor condition. The 
floor caved in, and approximately 12 people fell; fortunately, 
nothing happened." (Panama City Circuito RPC Television in 
Spanish 2300 GMT 22 March 94) 
  Approximately 21,000 workers from the National Central 
Organization of Panamanian Workers, CNTP, have announced their 
decision to support the presidential candidacy of Ernesto Perez 
Balladares and oppose Carles, whom they characterize as a 
supporter of the U.S. December 1989 invasion of Panama. CNTP 
Secretary General Elberto Luis Cobos stated in a communique that 
the working classes identify with Perez' ideology and 
background, adding he represents hope and an opportunity for 
thousands of Panamanians who have been deceived by the current 
government. Cobos has said "a victory by Perez Balladares would 
mean a return to Torrijismo and a rejection of the neoliberal 
policies promoted by the international financial institutions 
that will foster great struggles." (Panama City LA PRENSA in 
Spanish 25 March 94 p 13A) 
  The Justice and Peace Commission has released a communique 
regarding the political ads shown on television. The document 
says "political propaganda should not exploit fear, induce any 
form of violence, or contain general accusations." One of the 
ads, sponsored by an alleged "Never Again" committee, shows 
clips of military repression and suggests viewers should never 
forget the dark past. Meanwhile, Gilberto Pitti, media director 
at the Government and Justice Ministry, says anonymous 
propaganda is not illegal and that there is no law that demands 
these ads be signed. (Panama City LA PRENSA in Spanish 25 March 
94 p 3A) 
  Perez Balladares says the latest polls show Change 94 
candidate Ruben Carles has reached a plateau, the beginning of 
his decline. LA PRENSA's latest poll puts Perez Balladares in 
the lead with 39 percent of respondents' votes, followed by 
Carles with 20.5 percent. Aurelio Barria from Carles' camp 
reacted to Perez' remarks by saying the polls show a 
polarization and that Carles' popularity will increase in March. 
(Panama City LA PRENSA in Spanish 25 March 94 p 2A) 
  Yesterday, Legislative Assembly President Arturo Vallarino 
asked the government to increase protection for presidential 
candidates. Vallarino's request was prompted by the murder in 
Mexico of Luis Donaldo Colosio, presidential candidate of the 
Institutional Revolutionary Party. Vallarino said: "The 
electoral campaign has been peaceful thus far, but times have 
changed, and it would be good for the government and its 
security bodies to provide greater protection for the 
presidential candidates." In response, Carlos Bares, 
Institutional Protection Service [SPI] director, said increased 
protection for each candidate has not yet been considered and 
that President Guillermo Endara would have to make such a 
decision. (Panama City LA PRENSA in Spanish 25 March 94 p 1A) 
  President Endara has told LA PRENSA, the SPI will provide 
greater security for the seven presidential candidates to 
guarantee their physical safety. Endara will discuss this 
decision, prompted by the assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio, 
with the Electoral Tribunal. President Endara said certain 
candidates have accepted the additional protection, but others 
have turned it down. (Panama City LA PRENSA in Spanish 26 March 
94 p 3A) 
  Yesterday, Electoral Tribunal magistrates asked the 
political 
parties, candidates to public office, and news media to ensure 
political ads fill the requirements of the Santa Maria La 
Antigua electoral ethical pledge. In a "public exhortation," 
the magistrates said past events are important, but they can be 
presented in a "positive and lofty" manner to avoid upsetting 
the parties participating in the race. (Panama City EL SIGLO in 
Spanish 26 March 94 p 37) 
  President Endara says as long as political campaign ads do 
not contain personal insults or incite people to violence there 
is no reason why they should not be shown. Endara has said: 
"We must remember the things that happened during certain 
periods of our history, be it during my administration or 
previous administrations." In response to a question on the 
subject, Endara also denied having received calls from various 
ambassadors asking him to press for a decision in favor of 
former Mayor Mayin Correa, who stood trial on charges of misuse 
of government funds, and he also said he has offered the 
presidential candidates greater protection by the police. 
(Panama City Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 1730 GMT 26 
March 94) 
  National Consensus Alliance candidate Samuel Lewis Galindo 
has campaigned in Anton, Cocle Province, with his running mate. 
Residents warmly greeted him. (Panama City Circuito RPC 
Television in Spanish 1730 GMT 26 March 94) 
  Candidates Perez Balladares and Carles, both of whom 
campaigned recently in Cocle Province on the same day, mutually 
accused each other of demagoguery. Perez suggested Carles 
remain in "his little rocking chair" until election day. "We 
have not forgotten your cruelty, arbitrariness, and prepotency, 
Chinchorro," Perez said. Meanwhile, Carles asked his supporters 
to compare his career as a public official to Perez', saying "no 
wealthy aristocrat is going to give me lessons in social 
sensibility." (Panama City LA PRENSA in Spanish 27 March 94 p 
1A) 
  Arnulfista candidate Mireya Gruber has told Kuna Indians in 
Kuna Yala: "At 2000 on 8 May, she will be elected president of 
Panama." Gruber invited the Indians to walk up the steps of the 
Palace of the Herons on 1 September. She spoke of the coup in 
1968, which toppled her late husband and promised to provide 
doctors and medicine for the Kunas, improve their education and 
farming systems, and provide scholarships for them. (Panama 
City LA PRENSA in Spanish 27 March 94 p 9A) 
  Papa Egoro candidate Ruben Blades has proposed the 
decentralization of power, which is centered in the province of 
Panama. He advocates giving the provinces the economic power 
and freedom to make their own decisions. Blades, who visited 
the Azuero region last week, reiterated he has no political 
debts and owes himself entirely to the Panamanian people. 
(Panama City LA PRENSA in Spanish 27 March 94 p 11A) 
  During a campaign stop in Cocle Province, Mireya Gruber has 
said Carles' fall has affected him. Gruber answered Carles' 
assertions that she is tired and wants to give up and form an 
alliance with him. "I believe the fall he suffered from that 
balcony has hurt his head," she said, adding: "If he needs my 
votes, he can join forces with me." (Panama City Circuito RPC 
Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 28 March 94) 
  Perez Balladares has asked his supporters to remain calm as 
he predicted the campaign of insults will become increasingly 
intense during the remaining six weeks before the elections. 
During a tour of several areas of Panama City, Perez said: 
"During the remaining six weeks we are going to be the targets 
of all types of provocations, starting with insults and 
anonymous television ads that we wish were signed by the 
candidate who is financing them." (Panama City Circuito RPC 
Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 28 March 94) 
  Carlos Valle, assistant secretary general of the Papa Egoro 
Movement, says his party has nominated candidates to 77 percent 
of the public posts in contention nationwide. Valle, who is 
also one of Ruben Blades' campaign managers, has said his party 
is widely recognized in the provinces, even though "just a few 
months ago Blades and the founders of the party were virtually 
unheard of in remote areas." His personal view is Blades appeals 
to the people because they want their questions answered in 
simple, not technical, terms. (Panama City LA ESTRELLA DE 
PANAMA in Spanish 31 March 94 p 1A)

  [Text] Caracas, 28 Mar (VENPRES) -- Division General 
Egberto Artuza Delgado, commanding general of the National 
Guard, has indicated that there has been a gradual increase in 
the past months in activity by Colombian narco-guerrillas 
[narcoguerrilla], particularly in the Amazonian area. Artuza 
Delgado said this at the end of a meeting with Pompeyo Marquez, 
special minister for border affairs, whom he briefed on the 
prevailing situation in the border area and the operations being 
conducted there by the National Guard. 
  Artuza Delgado pointed out that the National Guard is aware 
that drug traffickers have set up cocaine processing 
laboratories and have planted cocaine fields in Colombian 
territory near the Venezuelan Amazonian area. He explained that 
the existence of these cocaine fields also draws guerrillas 
closer since they are in charge of protecting production of the 
drug. Artuza Delgado termed this situation "very serious." 
  Later, referring to the resources the National Guard needs 
for border operations, he added that the National Guard is aware 
of the country's fiscal situation and that is why it has changed 
its conduct. According to Artuza, the National Guard will have 
to learn to manage the resources assigned for border operations 
more efficiently.

<F P=106> [Report by Jose G. Ramos] </F>
  [Text] Following a number of inspections along the border 
with Colombia, agents from DEA and other international 
organizations have determined that 80 percent of the drug 
traffic that passes through Venezuela -- some 100-150 tonnes a 
year -- crosses the border between the states of Zulia and 
Tachira. 
  MAS [Movement for Socialism] Deputy Julio Montoya has 
reported that the Perija Cartel has appeared along the 
Venezuelan border as a result of the displacement and 
reorganization of the Medellin Cartel's medium-level leaders. 
This comes after Colombian authorities dealt the drug 
traffickers smashing blows by killing or arresting their topmost 
leaders as part of the fight against drug trafficking in 
Colombia. 
  Montoya said he has proof that the kidnapping of cattlemen 
along the border -- which occurred last year at the alarming 
rate of three kidnappings per month along the country's western 
border, and, so far this year, has risen to four per month -- is 
the result of a plot being carried out by the Colombian drug 
cartels. He said the drug traffickers' strategy is to force 
hacienda owners to leave the area to allow traffickers to buy 
the abandoned property with laundered money. According to 
Montoya, "Once this is done, the region will become an 
operations center with the installation of labs and other 
infrastructures to process drugs." 
  According to the investigation conducted by Montoya, six of 
every 10 haciendas in the area have been put up for sale because 
of the hacienda owners' fear over the current situation. He 
said: "The effect on our agriculture and livestock industry is 
evident -- lower production of beef, milk, and several 
agricultural products."

<F P=106> [Article by Carlos Subero] </F>
  [Excerpts] The Chamber of Deputies yesterday unanimously 
agreed to open an investigation into the financing of the 
election campaigns of congressmen and parties and, in general, 
the financing of political leaders by any financial institution. 
  The motion was one of four passed yesterday as the climax to 
a heated debate that the COPEI [Social Christian Party] bloc had 
begun in connection with Pablo Medina's charges against Oswaldo 
Perez Paz, Leonardo Ferrer (former speakers of the house) and 
Luis Carlos Serra Carmona (Democratic Action [AD]-Zulia-elected 
by party slate). 
  The investigation will be conducted by an ad hoc committee 
that may commission the appropriate legal bodies to furnish 
pertinent evidence. The motion was made by MAS [Movement Toward 
Socialism], one of whose members recalled operation "Clean 
Hands" in Italy, saying that this could be done in Venezuela as 
well. In light of the motion, the deputies seem willing to 
investigate themselves. 
  The COPEI and AD blocs demanded that Medina submit evidence 
to back his assertions that these three political leaders carry 
"free" credit cards from the Banco Latino. In speeches by 
several Cause R congressmen, the party rejected the AD and COPEI 
demands and accused these parties of being financed by the Banco 
Latino. Similar charges were leveled at Cause R, which was said 
to have been financed by a banker who is suspected of money 
laundering. These and other general and personal charges 
abounded during the debate between AD, COPEI, and Cause R, while 
the ruling coalition of Convergence-MAS stayed on the sidelines. 
[passage omitted] 
  This was the atmosphere during the debate, in which MAS and 
Convergence tried merely to reconcile the feuding parties, by 
the way. After it was over, the speaker of the chamber, Carmelo 
Lauria (AD-Miranda-elected by party list), said that it was the 
saddest debate that he had ever witnessed. 
<H5>  Turning the Tables </H5>
  The debate seemed to be heading towards a summons for Pablo 
Medina when a speech by the head of the MAS bloc, Segundo 
Melendez (Lara-elected by name), gave it a new turn. Melendez 
spoke of Congress's battered image and also about the 
irresponsible charges that are being made as pure pretexts. He 
added, though, that the substance of Medina's assertions cannot 
be resolved merely by summoning him to testify; rather, the 
financing of parties and campaigns through the Banco Latino has 
to be investigated. 
  His motion turned the debate around, and Ramos Allup 
(AD-Carabobo-elected by party slate) rounded out his suggestion 
by calling for the investigation to be extended to the 
relationship between politicians and any financial institution, 
not just the Banco Latino. 
<H5>  Italy's Democracy Withstood It </H5>
  Another of the political speeches that stood out was 
delivered by Deputy Julio Montoya (MAS-Zulia-elected by party 
slate), who said that Congress has to dispel the idea that its 
members are a bunch of loafers. He announced that Convergence 
and MAS, after the debate on the floor, had agreed to support 
the investigation into all politicians and their ties to banks. 
"Italy's democracy withstood it," the MAS deputy said, bringing 
applause from Jose Rodriguez Iturbe (COPEI-Zulia-elected by 
name). 
  The purpose of immunity is for deputies to defend citizens, 
nothing else. The corrupt are the ones who should be afraid, 
said Montoya, who in passing expressed his view that Caldera is 
the country's leading democrat and is not thinking about a 
Fujimori-style coup. He went on to say that there ought to be a 
judge in the investigation because "the country will not believe 
it if a committee of deputies exonerates a fellow deputy." 
  The momentous motion to investigate the financing of parties 
and politicians passed unanimously in the end, as did a motion 
by Perez Vivas to have the speaker of the chamber urgently ask 
the board overseeing the Banco Latino to submit a report 
indicating whether there is a list of people who own free credit 
cards and who they are. Also passing unanimously was a motion by 
Vladimir Villegas (Cause R-Federal District-elected by name) 
whereby the chamber would ask the Bicameral Committee for a 
report on the charges by Pablo Medina and on details of the 
relationship between, on the one hand, political parties and 
members of the previous legislature and, on the other, the Banco 
Latino. 
  Finally, the AD and COPEI blocs agreed to summon Medina to 
submit evidence in support of his charges against Alvarez Paz, 
Ferrer, and Serra. Cause R, Convergence, and MAS abstained. 
  The deputy who brought all this on was not on the floor. 
Pablo Medina was waiting in his congressional office for newsmen 
so that he could level another charge at Alvarez Paz, Ferrer, 
and the political leadership of AD and COPEI. Questioned about 
the evidence that he is being called on to submit, he replied: 
"It will come out." He talked about Ferrer's debts to the Banco 
Latino: promissory note 64422 for 22.85 million bolivars, which 
fell due on 10 September 1993, with an overdraft of 3,586,446.55 
bolivars.

  [Text] The standing committees of the Chamber of Deputies 
were established definitively yesterday when the speaker of the 
house, Carmelo Lauria, approved their makeup. 
  The speaker asserted that with the establishment of these 
committees "Congress will start to work at full capacity and 
must greatly improve its legislative efforts." 
  The formation of the working committees had been paralyzed 
by 
the political controversy that arose when their chairmen were to 
be appointed. This controversy prompted the first political 
crisis of the new Congress and created great confusion among the 
public. 
  The following is a list of the committee chairmen and the 
party to which they belong: 
  Domestic Policy: Enrique Ochoa Antich, Movement Toward 
Socialism (MAS) Foreign Policy: German Monzon, Convergence 
Defense: Ibrahim Sanchez, COPEI [Social Christian Party] 
Economy: Gonzalo Perez Hernandez, National Integrity 
Movement-Convergence Comptrollership: Paulina Gamus, Democratic 
Action (AD) Finance: Gustavo Tarre Briceno, COPEI Agriculture: 
Amilcar Aponte, AD Mass Media: Manuel Isidro Molina, MAS 
Tourism: Ixora Rojas, AD Environment and Land Use: Cesar Perez 
Vivas, COPEI Youth, Recreation, and Sports: Vladimir Petit, 
COPEI Administration and Services: Aristides Hospedales, AD 
Against the Improper Use of Drugs: Luis Emilio Rondon, AD Energy 
and Mines: Ali Rodriguez, Cause R. Education: Pablo Gonzalez, AD 
Culture: Jose Albornoz, Cause R. Science and Technology: Lelis 
Paez, Cause R. Social Affairs: Victor Moreno, Cause R. Health: 
Luis Parodi, COPEI Neighborhood Affairs: Alberto Salcedo, Cause 
R. Regional Development: Emilio Lopez, COPEI Planning: Julio 
Castillo, MAS 
  Lauria emphasized that this time the committees are more 
pluralistic as their chairmen and deputy chairmen belong to 
different political forces. Traditionally, both were from the 
same party, which in practice meant that the deputy chairman was 
merely the chairman's alternate.

<F P=106> ["Open Agenda" program with host Antonio Resillez and guests </F>
Daniel Cordoniu and Gilberto Salazar from the Nuclear Affairs 
Executive Secretariat, SEAN -- live] 
  [Text] [Resillez] Given the postponement of the Juragua 
Nuclear Plant project in Cienfuegos, many people were under the 
impression that in effect, the Cuban nuclear program was being 
axed. This postponement was announced by Commander in Chief 
Fidel Castro in September 1992. It has been 18 months since 
then. Tonight, we will discuss this issue of great interest to 
our people. 
  In the latest issue of the specialized magazine NUCLEOS, Dr. 
Daniel Codorniu, deputy secretary of the Cuban Nuclear Affairs 
Executive Secretariat [SEAN] states: The nuclear program is not 
only alive, it beats at the same rate as the great challenges 
our nation faces today. Dr. Codorniu is here with us. We also 
have engineer Gilberto Salazar, vice president of SEAN. Doctor, 
what is the main focus of SEAN today? 
  [Codorniu] First, I want to thank this program for giving us 
the opportunity to explain these issues to our people. I would 
like to begin by saying that in general, the doubts you 
mentioned arise from the fact that when people hear, "nuclear 
program," they think only of the nuclear plant. Although 
electricity generation is the main application of this 
technology, it is not the only one. There are numerous uses of 
atomic power worldwide, ranging from electricity generation to 
cancer treatment and the use of radiation to fight agricultural 
pests. 
  The Cuban nuclear program, from its onset several years ago, 
was conceived as a multifold and multilateral program. Our 
program was never tied only to the nuclear plant, although the 
plant was its centerpiece. Our program always included two main 
areas: electricity production -- nuclear energy. We are still 
working on this because the Juragua plant project has been 
postponed, but not killed. We can discuss this further on. 
  Another important area is the the use of radioisotopes and 
radiation in a variety of sectors nationwide. In this area, we 
are working in four [as heard] main sectors: The use of this 
technology in the nation's most important programs, like 
biotechnology; the pharmaceutical industry; health; the food 
program; support to primary industries in terms of efficiency, 
like the nickel, oil, and sugar industries. There is also a 
program related to the environment and its ties to tourism. 
  Perhaps, we ought to clarify what we mean by radioisotopes 
and radiation. This jargon is well known to many, but it is wise 
to explain that radioisotopes are a specific variety of unstable 
chemical elements, not the common ones with which we are all 
familiar. This instability results in the emission of 
high-energy particles leading to their disintegration into other 
elements. This is what is known as radiation. These unstable 
elements are the radioactive isotopes. Why are they important? 
Why do they have so many uses? First of all, because by emitting 
radioactive particles, we can register the process with 
equipment; we can tell where they are. It is similar to a race 
in the dark, with the runner carrying a torch. This is what 
happens with the isotopes. A radioactive isotope can be injected 
into a patient or into industrial pipes and its progress can be 
monitored. These are called radioactive tracers. They have many 
uses. The radiation that isotopes emit affects and modifies 
specific targets. This is why it can be used to modify a 
cancerous tumor, improve the properties of a material, or induce 
genetic changes in plants. Thus, the importance of its 
applications. 
  [Resillez] I believe later on we can discuss in detail these 
programs in which SEAN is participating. I would like now to 
discuss the 1993 SEAN assessment report. I read this report and 
I have seen that it emphasizes, and I quote: During this period, 
work has been conducted [passage indistinct]. Further on, the 
report affirms that the scientific accomplishments for 1993 are 
far greater than in previous years. 
  What is meant by the statement in the report that you had 
serious financial and material limitations? 
  [Codorniu] I believe this is not a problem specific to SEAN. 
It is somewhat a reflection of the ongoing national situation, 
the special period. This has also significantly affected our 
work. 
  Our program, as is well known, was closely linked to the 
former USSR and the now-dismantled socialist bloc. Many of the 
resources came from there. We had important cooperation. We have 
also had the normal limitations with energy resources. Last 
year, we worked with 38 percent of the fuel and 39 percent of 
the electricity we used in 1990. 
  Well, I do not think this is a special situation, but a 
situation affecting most institutions. I can add that the 
country continued making tremendous efforts in providing 
resources in some areas closely related to these programs we are 
discussing. This activity, for instance, has received important 
support. 
  [Resillez] Dr. Codorniu, isn't there some contradiction 
between these severe limitations and what you are achieving; 
that is, better results than in the previous years, as stated in 
the final report? 
  [Codorniu] Well, I do not believe that achieving better 
results with fewer resources is specific or unique to our 
(?area). I would rather say that this is due to the forward 
steps our country is taking in the scientific field. I believe 
that if we were to make an analysis of the many scientific 
institutions in our country, we would find a similar situation. 
Here we must begin with the fact that scientific activity was 
consolidated in one single year. We are talking about 
crystallizing a series of activities in which we have been 
working for many years. 
  In the 1980's, the country made a tremendous effort to 
provide resources and train personnel for this activity, and I 
think we are now reaping the fruits. I must add that our own 
limitations have helped change the mentality of our researchers, 
our experts, and our cadres, in the sense of working much more 
in concrete programs, in programs which will be able to answer 
the country's most important needs. Above all, we have also 
learned to overcome the prevailing contradiction between work at 
laboratory level and work in the factory, the achievement of a 
product. What was achieved today I attribute essentially to 
this: We have achieved more with fewer resources. But I wish to 
repeat that this is not something characteristic of our work 
alone. 
  [Resillez] Cordorniu, what achievements are mentioned in the 
report? That is, what basic achievements can you mention? 
  [Codorniu] Well, I can mention some of the most important 
results of our scientific-technical activity in 1993 because it 
would be impossible to discuss everything. I am going to refer 
to the most important ones, beginning with those that are 
perhaps closer to the viewers' concerns. For instance, in the 
agricultural area we have been able to expand the production of 
three different varieties of rice through radiation. These 
varieties are obtained by the effects of radiation on the seed. 
This is something our experts, together with experts in the 
agriculture field, carried out for years. Thus, three varieties 
of rice have been obtained with better properties in the grain 
quality and the possibility of working with them under 
conditions needing less water. 
  Another important result is related to the assembly and 
tuning of equipment with the use of a radioactive source that 
helps to exactly determine the limit between water and petroleum 
in a petroleum well. This, of course, has had great importance 
to all petroleum research activities. 
  I also wish to mention the result obtained by our colleagues 
from the territorial delegation of Holguin, related to the 
installation and tuning of another radioactive system which 
helps systematically determine the density of nickel carbonate 
pulp [pulpa] at the Benito Che Guevara Company in Moa. This 
prevents stoppages -- which are often very costly -- for not 
having these guidelines well under control, especially in this 
industry which is so important to the country. 
  I can also mention a method developed this year that allows 
the use of devices for open-heart surgery, cardiovascular 
surgeries. These devices are imported and sterilized by 
radiation, but this sterilization has an expiration date. We 
managed to make this sterilization work in the country. I could 
add that the first applications of this work by the end of 1993 
have helped the country save more than $90,000 during the first 
stage alone. This can be extended to many other areas. 
  As you can see, these are concrete achievements of the 
national effort. We are talking about rice, petroleum, nickel, 
and health levels. This year we also have a very important 
result, obtained by the Radiation Protection Center, in 
coordination with the three territorial delegations we have in 
Holguin, Cienfuegos, and Camaguey, related to the study of the 
Environmental Radioactive Fund of the Republic of Cuba. This is 
an important result because it helps detect levels of 
radioactive elements in the environment. There are always small 
amounts of radioactive elements in the environment. These must 
be known and kept under control; especially, for instance, if 
the Juragua Plant begins operating. We must be aware of any 
variation in the radioactive level or detect any abnormality 
that could take place in neighboring countries so as to adopt 
the appropriate measures. We already have this. It has also 
helped us discover that radiation levels in our environment are 
low. This study was also carried out in zones with tourism 
prospects and on some beaches on the northern coast of the 
island. We can say that our beaches can be attractive to 
tourists not only because of their natural beauty or the quality 
of the sand, but also because the presence of natural 
radioactive elements is very low, which is not so in all 
developed nations. 
  [Resillez] Can I deduce that the last achievement you 
mentioned is something like a protective shield for the country? 
I think it can help us detect any possible radioactive spread, 
regardless of where it comes from. 
  [Cordoniu] Of course. And I would like to add that this is 
the result of a study carried out for years. We are talking 
about studies conducted for eight or ten years, and the use of a 
lot of working equipment. We can thus say that this is not the 
result from 1993 alone, but from many years. 
  [Resillez] Engineer Salazar, what is meant by SEAN's own 
production? 
  [Salazar] Well, to conduct a nuclear program successfully, 
there are four essential elements that must be fulfilled: 
qualified personnel, updated literature on scientific and 
technical information, regular and efficient supplies of 
radioactive sources, and adequate equipment to measure them. 
SEAN has been successful in the latter two aspects, and these 
are SEAN's own achievements. That is, SEAN has managed to 
supply, in a regular, efficient, and stable manner, the 
radioactive sources and the equipment adequate to measure them. 
  Three radiopharmaceutical products are already being 
produced 
at the Center for Isotopes, which is temporarily headquartered 
at [name indistinct]. These radiopharmaceutical products are 
normally used in heart treatments. They are (Ipuran), which is 
linked to renal research; pyrophosphate, which is used in 
research on brain activities; and DTPA [expansion unknown], 
which also has to do with heart, brain, and renal research. 
These are compound elements that used to be imported, but which 
we have now succeeded in producing in a stable manner, thereby 
replacing imports in increasingly larger amounts. 
  A isotope center is now under construction in La Victoria 
Valley on the national highway at km 14.5, where these elements 
can be produced in a staggered manner. We intend to increase, 
this year and in the coming years, the production of these 
elements. This is a great and important project which will also 
have important economic repercussions for the country. With the 
production of these radiopharmaceutical products in 1993, the 
country spent some $65,300; but if these products were to be 
imported, they would have cost some $177,400. This means this 
production has saved a little more than $112,000 for the 
country. That is, it also has an important economic reward for 
the country. 
  We have also been working on the production line of some 
equipment that helps measure radiation. They are, for instance, 
the radiometers -- a total of 60 have already been produced in 
the country -- and other equipment that helps measure surface 
contaminations, which are important for any nuclear program. 
Some companies have monopolized this production. Also, as a 
consequence of the blockade, it is becoming increasingly more 
difficult for us to have access to that technology. Moreover, we 
have managed to progress in this field and to produce these 
elements at a much lower cost, ranging between 30 and 50 percent 
of the price of this equipment on the international market. This 
also allows us to sever our dependency, a dependency that 
implies the need to guarantee repairs and maintenance of this 
equipment. 
  [Resillez] Engineer, this aspect you are outlining is 
certainly very important, and what Dr. Codorniu reported is also 
very important. But I am suddenly overwhelmed by a serious 
concern. I have the impression that these 27 minutes of the 
program are insufficient, especially for giving a visual picture 
of what SEAN is doing in the nuclear field. Before continuing 
this dialogue, an idea suddenly comes to mind, and I hope it 
will not disturb you, because the idea I have is to resume this 
dialogue next Tuesday. But I want to resume this discussion in a 
way that will give a better visual report to our viewers of 
these most interesting achievements. Some 48 hours ago, I had 
the opportunity to visit with Engineer Salazar and Dr. Codorniu 
at all of these places and to see how interesting and 
well-trained these people are. They are developing a very 
complex, but agreeable technology in all repects. I would like 
to know whether you would agree to resume these discussions next 
Tuesday with a more visual report of all these things. Do you 
agree with this idea? 
  [Codorniu] Yes, we agree. I think it will be an opportunity 
to expand this report and to show some pictures of the 
achievements of our experts. 
  [Resillez] Thank you very much. I will take your word that 
you agree to return next Tuesday. Engineer, in Cuba there are 
192 installations working with radiological or nuclear 
substances. In the same report mentioned at the beginning of 
this program concerning an assessment of this year's work, I 
suddenly remember that there are 192 installations in the 
country, but that only 91 have licenses that provide security 
for this type of work. Does this percentage -- which I consider 
low -- imply that there could be some risk for one or many 
people in the country? 
  [Salazar] By no means, Resillez. It is true that there are 
192 institutions using radioactive substances. But of these 192 
institutions, only 116 must submit to a licensing process, while 
the remaining 76, because of the activity they are conducting, 
must only be registered. One of SEAN's responsibilities is to 
control all the work being carried out in this area, both 
radiological and nuclear activity. The National Center for 
Nuclear Safety, where these experts are working, is in charge of 
inspecting all those institutions, especially those that need 
only be registered. They are inspected every two years to see 
the conditions under which they are working. There are 91 
institutions that need to have a license, while 25 are in the 
process of obtaining their licenses. 
  [Resillez] Thank you, Engineer. Dr. Codorniu, you are a 
deputy of the National Assembly [of the People's Government, 
ANPP] and vice president of one of the working subcommissions. 
We understand that the ANPP is in favor of maintaining the 
nuclear option as a certain possibility for the country in the 
future. We would like to know SEAN's opinion on this and how is 
it working. And by the way, many viewers have been asking during 
the program what news is there about (?nuclear energy). 
  [Resillez] Well, I think this is a very interesting 
question. 
We feel that nuclear energy is an important alternative for the 
country's future, and we are not saying this just because of our 
recommendations, but because we have analyzed the elements 
[pauses], of course the country is looking for a short- term 
solution to the energy problem by using natural resources, the 
bagasse, the Cuban crude oil, etc. But in the long- and 
medium-terms, we must also consider the nuclear option as an 
alternative, and not the only one. Of course, we already have 
Juragua. We can say that the conservation plan has been 
fulfilled. Our Minbas [Ministry of Basic Industry] colleagues, 
who are our current investors, have made a tremendous effort. So 
far, all installations are satisfactory. This allows us to carry 
on when conditions permit. 
  In addition to this, we are intensely working for our 
government and for our colleagues from Minbas, seeking 
alternatives to continue this project because of its importance 
for the country. That is, we already have this, and we also have 
a scientific-technical structure. We have achieved some 
experience in this field, and if we analyze the world situation 
concerning nuclear energy, which, regardless of its detractors 
and some setbacks such as the Chernobyl accident and others, is 
still one of the essential alternatives in the world's energy 
development. There are more than 400 electricity-producing 
nuclear plants throughout the world, and 17 percent of 
electricity generated is of nuclear origin. We must also 
consider the fact that this is a developing technology. So some 
progress has been achieved in this field, and we think -- not 
only because we want to stick to this idea, but because of the 
analysis we have made -- that this is an alternative that should 
be taken under consideration. We must also begin from the point 
that what we might do in the future will depend on what the 
experts are capable of doing. We already have an important 
contingent of Cuban experts working with our own force and our 
own intelligence. 
  [Resillez] Thank you very much, Dr. Codorniu and Engineer 
Salazar, for participating in this Open Agenda program, during 
which we have been discussing the Cuban nuclear program.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina has announced that 
he has sent confirmations to a majority of the people invited to 
the conference entitled The Nation and the Emigre Community, 
which is to be held in Havana during the second half of April. 
After adding that there will be no extremist parties at the 
meeting with representatives of the Cuban community abroad, 
Robaina stressed that the goal of the meeting is not to discuss 
Cuba's political future but mainly to discuss emigration 
policies to improve the emigres' ties with their homeland. 
Robaina added that the meeting will probably devote many hours 
to the emigration issues and Cuban democracy as well as 
intellectual, artistic, and academic exchanges. 
  Robaina went on to say that Cuba's economic situation is 
beginning to improve and that the worst is over. He added that 
after bottoming out, Cuba's economy has begun a process of 
recovery, and that, in comparison with those of 1993, this 
year's results are different and somewhat encouraging.

  [Text] Next week, Cuba will open a diplomatic mission in 
Barbados, which will help promote commercial, cultural, and 
sports relations with all eastern Caribbean as part of Cuba's 
integration into that region. 
  Cuba and Barbados established diplomatic relations on 8 
December 1992 [as heard], but now the opportunity to establish a 
mission in Bridgetown has arisen because of Cuba's closer ties 
with the Anglo-Caribbean community, Caricom. 
  Lazaro Cabezas, Cuba's current ambassador to eastern 
Caribbean, stressed that the main objectives of his mission are 
to strengthen economic and commercial ties as well as to promote 
culture and sports ties. Cabezas represents Cuba in St. Vincent 
and the Grenadines, the Bahamas, St. Lucia, and Trinidad and 
Tobago. The only countries in that region yet to formalize 
diplomatic ties with Cuba are Dominica, St. Kitts and Nevis, and 
Antigua and Barbuda.

  [Text] Brigadier General Silvano Colas Sanchez, 
communications minister, has visited the Provinces of Granma and 
Santiago de Cuba. In Granma, the general described several 
Communications Ministry enterprises' work in installing new 
television transmitters as very positive. This has upgraded 
signal reception, mainly in Bayamo City. In Santiago de Cuba, 
the minister discussed aspects of the project to install two new 
television transmitters, which will be conducted shortly, and 
the progress of expanding new telephone lines, which is being 
conducted at the main telephone station in Santiago de Cuba. 
  During his extensive trip, the minister met with the workers 
of each facility, discussed quality service indexes, and 
criticized subjective problems that worsen the effect of the 
resources shortage and the special period. Finally, he urged the 
workers to improve telephone and postal services and to close 
ranks against those who hurt the prestige of the workers of this 
sector.

  [Text] Today, Zambian Foreign Minister Remmy Kaindu Gilly 
Mushota visited Santiago de Cuba. During his stay in this 
province, he visited some places of historical and economic 
interest like the Antonio Maceo Revolution Square, Moncada 
Garrison, Siboney Farm, and the old Bacardi rum factory. He 
expressed interest in the province's history. 
  At the Medical Sciences University, he exchanged ideas with 
ten Zambian students who are majoring in technological and 
medical sciences. The Zambian foreign minister stressed the 
importance this aid has for his country. He said Zambia hopes to 
have 300 medical doctors by the end of this year. For this, 
Cuban cooperation is decisive. The Zambian delegation returned 
to Havana in the afternoon.

  [Text] Dr. Rigoberto Torres, an expert on AIDS, has told 
this newscast that despite significant economic limitations, 
over 60 participants in a new ambulatory program have their food 
supplies guaranteed and the same access to treatment and 
medicines as hospitalized patients. Torres added that the diet 
program includes eggs, meat, fish, milk, tubers, and vegetables 
to bolster the regular diet received by every Cuban citizen. 
Torres acknowledged, however, that this special diet is below 
the 4,000-calorie diet the patients received while at the 
sanatoriums and which is still being provided to those living 
there. 
  The Cuban hospitalization program began in 1986. Since then, 
1,011 HIV carriers have been detected. Epidemiologists believe, 
however, that there could be another 200 undetected cases. So 
far, 164 people have died of AIDS, 12 of them due to unrelated 
causes. Full-blown AIDS currently effects 256 individuals. The 
life expectancy of an HIV carrier in Cuba averages 12 years, 
while the average for AIDS cases is 1.5 years. These indexes are 
relatively high in comparison with world statistics.

  [Text] Since 1990, the Ministry of Agriculture [Minag] has 
relocated approximately 5,000 workers to production and service 
positions in Matanzas. That attitude has allowed 70 percent of 
workers to be directly involved in the production of goods and 
for the rest to be employed in technical, administrative, and 
management positions. 
  Noel Lopez, a Minag delegate in Matanzas, stated that with 
the creation of 41 Basic Cooperative Production Units [UBPC's], 
work relations have improved even more. He stated that even 
though UBPC's have not been created in the pork, fish, and 
citrus branches, organizational measures have increased the 
number of workers who directly participate in production. He 
stated that in Matanzas' citrus sector, 83 percent of the more 
than 600 excess workers from various sectors are now directly 
employed in agricultural tasks.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Jose Alejandro Rodriguez] </F>
  [Text] As with everything that breaks with tradition, 
self-employment has sparked controversy in Cuban society. And 
the spectrum of opinions covers everything from advocating a 
complete deregulation of this activity, eliminating all controls 
and restraints, to a fear of any flexibility, and a rejection of 
even the most modest variants of self-employment. 
  The wisest course of action is to look at the phenomenon in 
balanced terms. At a time of serious economic contraction, it is 
a palliative for employment difficulties; it can assure the 
population of goods and services and resolve myriad daily 
problems by using everyone's initiative. Furthermore, it 
represents an opportunity to relieve the state of some burdens. 
But we must not limit its raison d'etre to temporary problems 
alone. This type of employment is a new element that is being 
incorporated into the Cuban labor system, a feasible alternative 
that is part of the qualitative changes taking place in our 
economy. 
  It is natural that Decree-Law 141, promulgated by the 
Council 
of State just five months ago to authorize self-employment, has 
raised many questions, and that its implementation has been a 
matter of trial and error, with many ups and downs. It is the 
course of events that dictates what procedures are to be 
followed and what changes need to be made. Because a decree, in 
and of itself, cannot account for reality. 
  More than 137,000 Cubans are already working for themselves 
in more than 100 occupations, ranging from plasterer to musical 
instrument tuner, from palm tree trimmer to potter. It is an 
inescapable reality that brings new questions: How can this 
movement, which is elbowing its way into the Cuban economy, be 
guided correctly? How far will it go? What are its vulnerable 
sides? How does it fit into the collectivist, socializing 
approach that has predominated in our society? 
  The first thing we must do is convince ourselves that, 
economically, politically, and socially speaking, this labor 
variant is by no means alien to our socialist formula, and can 
in fact enrich it with a breath of fresh air that will not 
represent a course change. There is no reason to fear 
self-employment, and there is every reason to accept its 
advantages and challenges. Otherwise, we would have to give up 
and turn our backs on it, because it is easier to say no to 
something we are unable to accept. 
  The question is how to accept it. The spirit of Decree-Law 
141 comes through loud and clear when it describes the active 
role the territorial governments and the neighborhood structures 
known as popular councils are to play in the control and 
monitoring of this activity to make sure it does not go bad or 
become corrupt. Moral rectitude and social discipline should be 
premises of this decentralizing phenomenon. 
  But we cannot remain focused on the mere purpose of the law. 
The initial experiences have shown us that it is in the places 
where this task has been undertaken with enthusiasm and 
conviction that the fewest distortions and abuses have occurred, 
and that the decree has been implemented with the fewest 
problems. 
  It is essential that we distinguish the true self-employed 
worker, that man who, through his individual effort and 
striving, aspires to earn more than the average income, provided 
that he earns it by honest effort and clean business practices. 
  He has nothing to do with the man who has stolen state 
property and, through tricks and dodges, thumbs his nose at the 
people's needs and shortages and displays his flashy greed, 
sometimes even refusing to accept the institutionalization of 
his status. This type of person generally does not register his 
business. We must vindicate the many honorable self-employed 
workers who are lumped together with unscrupulous speculators 
and wheeler-dealers. 
  There is no denying that some self-employed workers have 
also 
gotten involved in shady deals. It is undeniable that at a time 
of severe shortages, when it is impossible for the state to 
guarantee the availability of raw materials and supplies, not 
everyone can resist the temptation to get hold of materials 
through dubious channels; but that is no excuse for people to 
blame the respectable occupation of self-employment. Throwing 
out the baby with the bath water is never a good idea. 
  A decree is being considered that would levy fines for 
irregularities in the implementation of Decree-Law 141. A 
rigorous inspection system would be set up. The popular council 
is supposed to establish a monitoring system to accomplish this 
task, and to exert control over this activity. And naturally, we 
must put this phenomenon in perspective. Neither self-employment 
nor any of the other measures that are being taken are mere 
band-aids; and to the extent that our economy shows signs of 
recovery and production picks up, the state can gradually assume 
its role as balancer or supplier. 
  Another regulating mechanism would be taxation and the 
control of self-employed workers' income. The tax that has been 
levied on their income is minuscule, but it is subject to 
increases as their income grows, just as it is everywhere else 
in the world. Income tax returns are one way of discovering 
malfeasance. 
  But to be fair, it is not healthy to blame self-employment 
for the diversion of resources, although it can occur there, 
just as well as in any other segment of society. Theft must be 
neutralized at the time and place where it occurs; every problem 
must be solved wherever it arises. 
  The self-employed should be subject to the same scrutiny as 
state workers, officials, or peasants. The only way this type of 
employment will smoothly fit into our economic environment is if 
it is born healthy, under the watchful eye of popular control 
and the discipline that the state must enforce. In this way 
alone will we be able to guarantee the right of honest people to 
make their living through self-employment.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Shortages and Vicious Circles"] </F>
  [Text] As the Workplace Parliament becomes a more common 
occurrence, more often than not the analysis does not stop at 
the harmful effects of the financial imbalance, but goes on to 
consider proposals concerning production, efficiency, the 
functioning of the business system, and the serious problems 
involved in stimulating work. 
  This qualitative change in the popular debate has occurred 
because it has become apparent that it is the shortage of 
supply, not an exaggerated increase in income, that has 
essentially created the phenomenon of excess liquidity, which is 
having serious economic and social repercussions. 
  People are becoming more and more aware that, although the 
abrupt decrease in supply is associated with external factors 
(the disruption of Cuba's economic and commercial ties with the 
former socialist world and the reinforcement of the blockade), 
the recovery of supply now depends above all on our ability to 
develop internal capacities for revitalization and economic 
growth. 
  And it is becoming clear that completely overcoming the 
shortage is not something that can be accomplished merely by 
manipulating certain variables that might reduce solvent demand, 
such as prices, taxes, and other monetary factors. Rather, it 
has to be accomplished by making positive changes in the most 
concrete factor in the economy, the place where the production 
of value is verified. 
  We must recall, to avoid harboring unfounded hopes, that any 
financial measures that may be taken will not have an immediate 
or absolute effect of boosting production or increasing supply, 
because their function is to serve as a bridge to provide access 
to revitalization. 
  And it should also be emphasized that it is unreasonable to 
expect the elimination of the shortage to occur uniformly, all 
at once, and equally for all citizens. 
  To understand this assertion, it is not enough to say that 
egalitarianism is a tendency that we must banish; we have to 
start from the notion that Cuba does not now have any external 
financing that would enable it to put to work a broad range of 
idle productive capacities in the short term, or to increase 
supply and stimulate work through consumption, as was done in 
the 1970's when external financing made it possible to create 
the parallel market. 
  And that is the vicious circle that workers see when they 
realize that the internal financial imbalance and low 
consumption, equitably distributed, erode the motivating force 
of wages, which is a factor that tends to weaken productive 
efficiency. 
  To break this vicious circle, it is imperative that we 
continue the policy of distributing available resources 
appropriately to certain sectors of the economy where spending 
will have the maximum multiplier effect. These sectors must be 
given not only the necessary supplies for production, but also a 
complement of consumer goods so that the workers can spend their 
income and thus counter the pernicious effect of shortages. 
  We are talking, then, about a crucial measure that is in the 
process of being implemented and should figure more prominently 
in the deliberations of the Workplace Parliaments, even though 
it is not on the agenda for the next session of the National 
Assembly and is not strictly a financial matter. 
  But this is an economic policy that also requires a broad 
consensus, given that our limited resources must be channeled 
preferentially toward activities such as sugar, mining, tobacco, 
coffee, oil drilling, biotechnology, the manufacture of medical 
and pharmaceutical products, tourism, agricultural food 
production, and others that directly generate foreign exchange 
income or are essential for the country's economic functioning 
and social life, such as public health and education. 
  Applying this policy in a consistent manner would promote 
the 
stabilization of those sectors, and would gradually create the 
surpluses needed for the recovery of other sectors, which would 
contribute to broader reproduction until the recovery of the 
national economy and the normal development of society became a 
reality. 
  In these priority sectors, which can play the role of 
"engines" of the economy, in addition to greater stimulation of 
work, the improvement of business practices must be established 
as an extensible premise. These sectors must have enough 
decisionmaking power and autonomy to ensure, without excuses, 
reasonable levels and increases in economic efficiency. 
  But it is our contention that this viable solution requires 
a 
consensus, because the allocation of resources to these 
multiplier activities is limited by the austere sacrifice 
required of other sectors, which, for a time, cannot aspire to 
the same levels of consumption. 
  This limitation, which is qualified by the national 
commitment not to leave any sector of the Cuban population out 
in the cold, makes it necessary to consider the decisive role 
that moral, ideological, and political factors must continue to 
play in the revitalization of the country's economy. 
  For that very reason, it is of vital importance that all 
workers be able to understand thoroughly the complexity of our 
situation, the viability of possible solutions, and the 
orientation toward changes that will help us win, little by 
little, the battle for efficiency and economic recovery.

<F P=106> [Report on a news conference by Government Minister Danilo </F>
Parinello with unidentified reporters in Guatemala City on 31 
March; from the "Telepress" newscast -- recorded] 
  [Text] At a news conference this afternoon, Government 
Minister Danilo Parinello addressed the issue of a possible 
state of emergency. 
  [Begin recording] [Parinello] We cannot rule out that 
possibility. We have given this issue broad discussion, and we 
cannot discard it. 
  [Unidentified reporter] The government communique states 
there are groups instigating all this commotion. Do you believe 
any specific group is responsible? 
  [Parinello] At this specific moment, no, but we are 
investigating. We have several investigation teams working all 
over the country trying to determine who might be responsible 
for this and initiating the appropriate legal action. 
  [Reporter] Is there any relation between this case and the 
incidents at Santa Lucia Cotzumalguapa due to the instigation 
factor? 
  [Parinello] This could be part of a collective psychosis 
that 
stems from this campaign, which is not spontaneous, including 
graffiti in cities, along highways, walls, and so on. Things 
such as this have happened all throughout history and all over 
the world whenever someone manages to agitate the people enough 
to create a type of collective psychosis. [end recording]

  [Text] Tuxtla Gutierrez, 31 Mar (NOTIMEX) -- Today, the 
Mexican Army announced it was transferring troops out of the 
conflict areas in southeastern Chiapas, sending them to rest and 
relaxation areas outside the region. The Chiapas 7th Military 
Regional Command reported moving the troops stationed in the 
municipalities of Ocosingo, Altamirano, Las Margaritas, and San 
Cristobal de Las Casas to rest and relaxation areas started this 
Thursday. 
  In a communique issued in Tuxtla Gutierrez, Chiapas State 
capital city, 1,050 km southeast of Mexico City, authorities 
explained the purpose of the movement is to give "adequate rest" 
to the troops, adding the troops movement will continue in 
subsequent days. The soldiers who are being moved have been in 
the conflict area for nearly three months. They were sent to the 
area on 1 January when the armed Zapatist National Liberation 
Army revolted to claim Indian rights, seized towns, and 
confronted the Mexican Army. 
  A virtual truce has prevailed in the area since 12 January 
when President Carlo Salinas de Gortari appointed then Foreign 
Secretary Manuel Camacho Solis as Chiapas peace commissioner and 
ordered a unilateral cease fire, to which the armed group also 
adhered. On 1 March, Camacho Solis and the armed group concluded 
a nine-day peace talk at San Cristobal Cathedral, 1,200 km 
southeast of Mexico City, with proposals to fulfill economic, 
political, and social demands. The parties agreed to discuss 
Camacho's proposals with the Indian communities where the armed 
group has influence with the country's highest authorities to 
seek an analyzed [word indistinct] during the second phase of 
dialogue. 
  The regional command reiterated the Mexican Army's respect 
for the cease-fire and its interest in reestablishing peace in 
Chiapas. The communique stated "we firmly assure that the 
Mexican Army will not at any time engage in any actions that 
might hinder a prompt solution to the restoration of peace and 
calm in this area of our motherland."

  [Text] Teopisca, Mexico, 31 Mar (NOTIMEX) -- Chiapas State 
Governor Javier Lopez Moreno says Ernesto Zedillo, presidential 
candidate of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), will 
support the peace agreements in Chiapas. Lopez Moreno, governor 
of the state affected since 1 January by the Zapatist National 
Liberation Army (EZLN) uprising, said Zedillo had expressed firm 
support for the fulfillment of the agreements negotiated by the 
government and rebels. At the beginning of March, Manuel Camacho 
Solis, commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas, and 
EZLN representatives agreed on several pledges through which to 
resolve the social problems which, according to the rebels, 
prompted the uprising. 
  Yesterday, Lopez Moreno disclosed that he talked on the 
telephone with Zedillo, who expressed an interest in doing away 
with the economic inequalities suffered by the state's 
inhabitants. In statements to the media during a meeting with 
residents of Teopisca, Chiapas, the governor said Zedillo Ponce 
de Leon's nomination was the best decision the PRI could make 
because most Mexicans identify with his work plan. Governor 
Lopez Moreno said Zedillo has time to continue the campaign 
initiated by slain PRI candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio and to win 
the August elections with honest and undisputable votes. 
  Lopez Moreno urged the residents of Teopisca "not to waste 
time because they have many problems" and to act immediately 
before the [words indistinct] concludes on 7 December. Lopez 
Moreno pledged to respect the decisions of those communities 
that choose to form municipal councils instead of municipal 
presidencies, and he announced that a new institutional strategy 
has been designed to resolve problems by regions.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Elizardo Sanchez Santa-Cruz, Cuban </F>
dissident and president of the Commission on Human Rights and 
Reconciliation, by Dominique Dhombres in Havana; date not given: 
"Cuban Society Has Become an Explosive Cocktail"] 
  [Text] A car filled with sinister-looking, plain-clothes 
policemen drives slowly around the block of houses. On the front 
door, you can still see the marks left by other representatives 
of "law and order" who recently broke it down. In the past few 
years, this peaceful house in the Playa residential area in west 
Havana has been "visited" a total of nine times by the police 
with varying degrees of heavy-handedness. This is the home of 
Elizardo Sanchez Santa-Cruz, a leading Cuban dissident and 
president of the Commission on Human Rights and Reconciliation 
-- an unofficial body, of course, and one which has been a 
constant cause of concern for the political police since it was 
founded in 1987. 
  The head of the household, who has spent more than eight of 
the last 12 years behind bars and who declares himself to be "in 
the opposition for 26 years," shows us a few of his personal 
photographs. In one, he stands smiling with the head of the 
Spanish Government, Felipe Gonzalez, while in another he is seen 
with Ted Kennedy, brother of the assassinated president and 
Democrat senator for Massachusetts. 
<H5>  `Country Is Immense Concentration Camp' </H5>
  Twice "Elizardo" has been allowed to travel abroad. He 
explains: "Both times, the authorities wanted to make a good 
impression on the rest of the world. Then they stepped up the 
repression when I returned." 
  "Elizardo" is a resolute opponent and the current 
authorities 
have made him pay dearly for it. What makes him different, 
however, is that he represents the social-democracy movement. He 
refuses to join the Miami expatriates who are pushing for a 
return to raw capitalism and the "good old days" of Batista, the 
dictator overthrown by Castro in 1959. He explains: "We want 
change for Cuba to come with a minimum loss of human life. What 
we are suggesting is gradual democratic reform, in the same way, 
for example, that Spain got rid of `Francoism' and Chile did 
away with `Pinochetism.'" 
  He takes a dim view of the current situation in Cuba: "The 
country is an immense concentration camp. There are prisons 
everywhere." He even comes up with the figure, impossible to 
verify, of 100,000 prisoners, both "common law" and political 
detainees, out of a total of just over 10 million inhabitants. 
This would give Cuba the highest proportional rate of 
imprisonment in the world, with approximately one in 10 citizens 
in jail.... 
  "Cuban society has become an Molotov cocktail. All the 
ingredients are there, after 35 years of totalitarianism. There 
is the accumulated hate of all those people who have been the 
victims of denunciation, and those people whose homes have been 
attacked, sometimes by their neighbors, during `disavowal 
actions' (demonstrations of hostility against opponents of the 
regime, supposedly spontaneous but in fact organized by the 
authorities). Nor should we forget that there are hundreds of 
thousands of veterans from the African wars who know full well 
how to fight. If the authorities hesitate and if weapons are 
available, it could turn into a blood bath. This is why we are 
proposing national reconciliation with a general amnesty, like 
in Chile or Central America. No one can be prosecuted by the 
authorities for their previous political activities. There are 
about 1 million members of the Communist Party in Cuba, and most 
of them are good people..." 
  "Elizardo" is aware that this desire for "reconciliation" 
scarcely pleases -- to be euphemistic -- the anti-Castro groups 
in Miami. The last straw for someone who has spent so long in 
prison is to be accused of being an agent of the regime by 
expatriate organizations demanding a severe purging when Castro 
has been overthrown. In the peace and quiet of Florida or New 
Jersey, it is easy for the most extreme expatriates to forecast 
the imminent fall of the Communist system and to delight in 
imagining scenarios where, for example, the former owners of 
tobacco and cane sugar plantations will have their property 
returned to them and the hotels and tourist beaches will be put 
up for auction. 
<H5>  `Romanian or Czech Model' </H5>
  For "Elizardo," it is clear that things will not happen that 
way. His prime concern is that a blood bath be avoided. Then 
again, who knows how long this system can continue, since it did 
not crumble, as people had often said it would, with the 
disappearance of the USSR and the "socialist camp." Fidel 
Castro may be 66 years old, but he enjoys excellent, even 
blooming health; he does not drink and he has given up smoking 
his legendary cigars. "Elizardo" concludes: "Sooner or later, 
change will come. The question is knowing whether it will 
follow the Romanian model or the Czech model." He would, of 
course, prefer a Cuban version of the "Velvet Revolution." 
  The same analysis prevails with Western diplomats stationed 
in Havana. Even if most of them prefer not to openly frequent 
dissidents, they are fully aware of the position tirelessly 
defended by Elizardo Sanchez Santa-Cruz and his friends. One of 
them said: "Castro has made considerable concessions by 
decriminalizing the possession of dollars by private 
individuals, but on the political front he has not budged an 
inch. We have to think about what will happen in the next few 
years if he remains this inflexible. He will either be gently 
retired by the more lucid members of the regime's `young guard,' 
or he will be brutally overthrown in a bloody uprising." 
  This "young guard," which the dissidents admit exists, is 
made up of people in their forties who were practically born 
with the Revolution and whom Castro has promoted to key posts in 
recent years -- people like Carlos Lage, who controls the whole 
economic sector, or Roberto Robaina, formerly charged with youth 
policy and now foreign minister. They are the "fresh, young 
faces" whom the bearded patriarch has taken some pleasure in 
promoting over the heads of some of his former comrades in arms 
with long-standing experience. 
  Obviously, they cannot, according to the very strict code 
governing the system, speak publicly about Castro's succession. 
They are thinking about it, however, and apparently have 
permission, in recent months, to voice a few of their thoughts 
to foreigners. This "young guard," therefore, is trying to relay 
the following message: The Americans must first lift the 
embargo. Castro himself would be ready to step down with dignity 
if he could be sure that everything he had accomplished would 
not collapse in a few hours. Institutional solutions can be 
found, but for the time being there is no question of talking to 
opponents like "Elizardo," especially since, in the eyes of the 
Socialist International, he would be the ideal choice to succeed 
the "Lider Maximo." The "young guard" is certainly ready to take 
over the reins, but its most brilliant members are well aware 
that, for years, the unenviable fate of the real or supposed 
successors to Castro has been disgrace, exile, or death.

  [Excerpt] Havana, 1 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- The Fidel Castro 
government decided to suspend the traditional 1 May workers 
parade and instead summoned the National Assembly of the 
People's Government [ANPP] to discuss issues related to the 
severe adjustment program to deal with the persistent economic 
crisis. The unusual decision to suspend the parade was 
announced Thursday by Pedro Ross Leal, secretary general of the 
Central Organization of the Cuban Workers Federation (CTC), who 
instead called for additional work shifts in order to ensure the 
success of the sugar harvest, the country's main industry. The 
summons to an extraordinary ANPP session was suggested this week 
by Castro in a speech during the closing ceremony of a plenary 
meeting of the CTC National Committee. 
  The colorful 1 May parade, to which Cuba would usually 
invite 
other countries' leftist political party leaders, was used by 
the government as a virtual plebiscite of workers support for 
the Cuban revolution. During a meeting with CTC leaders, Castro 
pointed out on that date [1 May], "there would be no better 
homage to workers" than the discussion by the ANPP deputies of 
the proposals by the "workers parliament" to clean-up the 
country's finances. 
  Included among the measures to be discussed during the 
assembly are those dealing with a tax system, a moratorium on 
subsidies to the consumption of goods and services, the closing 
down of inefficient companies, price increases, as well as 
cutting the state payroll. [passage omitted]

  [Text] As a noble tribute to the Cuban people, the upcoming 
May Day will be turned into a decisive boost to production tasks 
like the sugarcane, tuber, and vegetable harvests and the 
planting and weeding. Pedro Ross Leal, secretary general of the 
Cuban Workers Federation, stated in Havana that the traditional 
Revolution Square rally and parade will not be held this May 
Day. Ross added that the occasion will be observed by means of 
ceremonies in the provinces and workplaces in keeping with the 
characteristics and resources of the different individual 
regions. These ceremonies will be held on 30 April because a 
special session of the National Assembly of the People's 
Government is scheduled for 1 May. Ross added that this is the 
result of a desire to keep May Day alive, as well as keeping 
alive, above all, the spirit of the workers assemblies recently 
held thoroughout Cuba and described by Fidel as a tremendous 
process by Cuba's union movement. 
  Ross stressed that one can pay no greater homage to Cuba's 
workers than to discuss, on May Day, their suggestions on how to 
streamline the nation's finances, since the workers will be 
responsible for implementing the economic measures to be adopted 
in Cuba.

  [Text] After a temporary paralysis in the construction of 
the Juragua nuclear plant, the main concern of the personnel is 
maintenance, in which several organizations have joined. For 
many years, the people of Cienfuegos have grown accustomed to 
this great project on the coast a few kilometers from the city. 
The Juragua nuclear power plant is the most ambitious symbol of 
industrial development in this province. 
  The causes of the momentary interruption of this 
construction 
are well known, but Cuba has not given up. All efforts are now 
aimed at the preservation of the existing construction. 
Continuous contacts are under way with the Russians concerning 
technical aspects of the temporary paralysis of construciton on 
the nuclear power plant as well as the supplies that are 
essential for its preservation. At present, 2,000 workers are 
engaged in its maintenance. 
  Several potential foreign investors are evaluating the 
possibility of investing in the Juragua project. A state 
committee was recently created to conduct these negotiations. 
The committee is also responsible for coordinating the aid that 
the national economy, despite its limitations, can give to this 
project. A number of organizations in Cuba have sufficient 
resources to meet the needs of the project at this stage and to 
guarantee the fulfillment of the maintenance program agreed upon 
in September [year indistinct] when the decision was made to 
halt construction on the plant. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified speaker] I believe it can be 
fulfilled this year. [end recording] 
  International atomic energy organizations in charge of 
overseeing nuclear plants have issued favorable reports 
concerning the plant's safety and the qualified training of the 
technical personnel. For all Cubans, the Juragua nuclear plant 
is the project of the century. Its construction continues, 
notwithstanding current difficulties.

  [Text] On 1 April, the Electrical Union issued the 
following communique on the breakdowns and other situations 
affecting the output of electric plants: 
  As reported, since last week, outages have exceeded the 
national schedule of outages due to breakdowns of generator 
units at several electrical plants. This lessens the electricity 
generation capacity of the National Electric System. The Diez de 
Octubre plant, in Nuevitas, experienced a temporary fuel 
shortage that forced it to reduce its output between 26 and 31 
March; this situation was resolved last night. 
  The Electrical Union reported that the situation will 
continue over the next few days, including 2 and 3 April. The 
outages will continue to be longer than scheduled and in 
accordance with the outage program designed in each region to 
cover this period. Maintenance workers at the power plants are 
working around the clock to complete repairs and increase the 
output of the National Electric System in the shortest time 
possible.

  [Text] Havana, 2 Apr (DPA) -- The more than 2 million 
residents of Havana awoke today to the unpleasant news that 
electrical outages (blackouts) will be maintained because of 
technical difficulties and a lack of fuel. The power 
interruption plan has shut down electrical power for 6-8 hours a 
day over the past few months, increasing to 10 hours on 
weekends. These power interruptions have caused complaining and 
irritation among the population. 
  The state Union of Electrical Transmissions and Distribution 
Enterprises [UETDE] today reported that the annoying "blackouts" 
will continue for the next few months because of generator 
breakdowns at many electrical power plants. Such breakdowns 
diminish the generating capacity of the national electrical 
system. The enterprise said the scarcity of fuel at the 10 
October Plant, located in Nuevitas about 600 km east of Havana, 
is "temporary." A lack of fuel prompted the plant to operate at 
a reduced capacity 26 through 31 March. The UETDE, however, 
noted that this "low generating capacity" will continue over the 
next few days, including the weekend; therefore, the schedule of 
power outages will continue to be adjusted. The regular outage 
schedule, which is adjusted according to the conditions within 
each of the 14 provinces, has been in effect for the past three 
years in an effort to conserve fuel. 
  Cuba's electrical power plants are being maintained with 
national petroleum, which is very heavy and has a high sulfur 
content. This causes frequent breakdowns and repairs. Up to 
1989, Cuba received some 13 million tons of oil annually from 
the former Soviet Union in exchange for sugar. The suspension of 
the Soviet crude supply triggered a partial standstill in Cuban 
industry and transportation, as well as a significant weakening 
of the national power system. According to unofficial figures, 
Cuba currently receives less than 6 million tons of oil annually 
at international market prices. Most of this oil comes through 
intermediaries, which also increases prices.

self-employment decree. Fines of up to 1,500 pesos and the 
confiscation of supplies and products were established by 
articles of Decree No. 186, which went into effect on 22 March. 
  Under Article 2 of this decree, anyone performing an 
activity 
not legally authorized will be fined 1,500 pesos, and the 
supplies and products involved will be confiscated. Similarly, 
anyone who is performing an authorized activity but doing so 
without a license, will be fined 1,200 pesos. 
  Decree No. 186 also establishes other fines: There is a 
1,200-peso fine for people using middlemen, and 1,200-peso fines 
for the middlemen themselves. Decree No. 186 also lists fines 
for, among other violations: rendering services or selling 
products in unauthorized locations, abusing market conditions 
for profit, and failing to comply with health requirements. 
  Decree No. 186 complements the September 1993 Decree No. 141 
on self-employment. As you will recall, Decree No. 141 
authorizes more than 130 self-employment jobs. Certain 
self-employment jobs, particularly in Havana, are at present 
undergoing review: For example, no new licences to work as taxi 
drivers or light meal producers are being issued, and 
specifically banned is the job of flower-grower and/or 
flower-vendor. 
  There are 42,600 authorized self-employed workers in Havana 
at the present time. The majority of these are in Diez de 
Octubre, Arroyo Naranjo, Centro Habana, Plaza de la Revolucion, 
and Playa Municipalities. These workers are primarily 
concentrated in approximately 70 open-air markets organized 
thoroughout the city.

  [Text] In the midst of the potato harvest, an intense and 
comprehensive system aimed at preventing misappropriation of 
agricultural products is being implemented in Havana City 
Province as well as in Havana Province. Thus, a source of 
profiteering is on the decline in both provinces, or at least 
that is the expected end result. This is the result of an 
experiment that began in early March, with Operation 
Agriculture-94 [Agro-94]. 
  [First speaker] "We stop them here. If they are carrying too 
many products, we confiscate the products and then fill out a 
confiscation form and send the products back to the units." 
  Local authorities affirm that in Guira de Melena alone, 109 
quintals of agricultural products were confiscated between 
January and March, products that allegedly would have ended up 
on the black market. So far, 623 people have been arrested. 
  [Second speaker] "Several checkpoints were set up along the 
access roads to the city as well as measures implemented at 
distribution centers and grocery stores in Havana, which allow 
the authorities of the different organizations in both provinces 
involved in this campaign to work jointly." 
  Someone said: If we do not do something, all Guira de Melena 
is going to be moved into Havana. In any case, this provincial 
traffic unit official affirms that these measures are not 
excessive. 
  [Third speaker] "Any individual citizen can come and solve 
his immediate problem with a stalk of plantains or a little bit 
of malanga for home consumption. What we confiscate here are the 
large quantities seized from people from Havana who come, buy 
from the farmers, and resell the produce on the black market. 
  "I wanted to clarify this. People are saying that we 
confiscate even a bag with three potatoes in it at the 
checkpoints. That is not true". 
  It seems the problem is abating: The flood of bags of 
agricultural products transported via bicycles, trucks, and cars 
[words indistinct]. This experiment can serve as an example for 
the rest of the country.

    [Editorial Report] Havana Radio Rebelde Network in Spanish 
at 1700 GMT on 1 April carries its "Straight Talk" program live, 
with host Osvaldo Rodriguez and his guest, reporter Eloy 
Concepcion. Rodriguez begins the program by commenting on the 
Agro-94 program: "We are taking up the topic of Agro-94 to 
discuss embezzlement and the theft of vegetables and tubers and 
many different kinds of agricultural products. Eloy, I believe 
the measures taken to prevent theft have had some results and 
more products can be found in the Havana City marketplaces. I 
believe a good many products are reaching those marketplaces, 
not fabulous amounts, but enough to complement the availability 
of food." 
  On this, Concepcion remarks: "Yes, the measures adopted in 
Havana were at the demand of the population. This is something 
we must point out. There was a certain generalized lack of 
social discipline manifested in the theft and embezzlement of 
products. Many areas and streets of the capital were turning 
into marketplaces for products obtained through the black 
market." Concepcion goes on to say: "I believe these measures 
are part of a cause that I would call noble: First, to curtail 
this embezzlement, if not completely, at least enough to 
establish the necessary order by which all products produced by 
the Basic Cooperative Production Units, the 
Agricultural-Livestock Cooperatives, and the state farms reach 
the population. This should be their final destination, for 
which the state and government have invested so many resources." 
  Regarding the marketplaces, Rodriguez states: "I recently 
heard of some situations where a delegate of the people's 
government is at the marketplace. The phenomenon between the 
farms and the marketplaces was one, but there was a separate 
network of dishonest people who would steal from the 
marketplaces. Of course, this was not at all of the 
marketplaces. It would happen in only a few of them. But there 
was a network of dishonest people who would embezzle vegetables 
and agricultural products to later sell on the black market and 
who formed part of this illegal trade in vegetables. I believe 
this has been stopped." 
  Regarding the distribution of agricultural products, 
Rodriguez goes on to say: I believe the collection centers 
[Acopio] must solve their problems now. Right now, in the midst 
of the Agro-94 movement, Acopio must solve the problem of 
transporting products to the marketplaces. 
  To this, Concepcion responds: I do not agree with you on 
Acopio solving its problem. I believe Acopio, as it exists 
today, must be abolished. I do not believe there is any other 
solution or condition than for Acopio to disappear, from the 
point of view of its current structure, which is inefficient. 
Acopio has demonstrated its inefficiency and that it is 
responsible for this whole problem of theft, embezzlement, and 
misappropriation because the product goes through an infinite 
number of hands and through an infinite number of structures and 
paperwork that no one tracks or controls, and which cannot be 
controlled by anyone." 
  Straight Talk concludes at 1715 GMT.

  [Text] The Eastern Army has carried out a tactical naval 
exercise in Camaguey as part of the Revolutionary Navy's 
training with a view to countering enemy action. Maneuvers 
included loading, unloading, launching mines, and accurately 
mapping the bay's minefields, which shows what resources the 
Cuban people's naval units have to counter a possible military 
blockade and the systematic deterioration of the bay. 
  The maneuvers, which involved embarkment, cruising, attack, 
and operations against enemy mines were described as positive, 
as were the organization, discipline, and interest shown by the 
sailors of the outstanding municipality of Nuevitas. Camaguey 
was able to host this meeting as a result of having obtained, 
for seven consecutive years, first place in the emulative 
competition of the Eastern Army's naval command and the zone of 
operations in question. The exercise showed that the people of 
Camaguey are capable of thwarting any enemy action against our 
coasts.

  [Text] On 2 April, Zambian Foreign Minister Remmy Kaindu 
Gilly Mushota leaves for Jamaica to continue a tour of the 
Caribbean. During his busy one-week official visit, which 
strengthened cooperation between Zambia and Cuba, the Zambian 
official discussed details of Zambian President Frederick 
Chiluba's forthcoming trip to Cuba. 
  Mushota met with high-level Cuban officials and visited the 
Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology Center, the Finlay 
Institute, and Santiago de Cuba Province. He also met with Raul 
Trujillo, first vice minister of the Ministry of the Sugar 
Industry, a meeting which paved the way for a technical 
assistance agreement. Mushota also held a news conference during 
which he stated that his visit to Cuba has been extremely 
positive and that he is very pleased with the agreements 
concerning health, sports, and sugarcane agriculture that have 
been signed.

  [Text] Zambian Foreign Minister Remmy Kaindu Gilly Mushota 
is en route to Jamaica following a busy one-week visit that 
served to strengthen cooperation between Zambia and Cuba. During 
a news conference a few hours before his departure, Mushota 
described his visit as very positive and stressed that his 
meetings resulted in a mutual understanding on essential 
principles concerning health, education, the development of the 
sugar industry, sports, and international relations. The accords 
reached in these areas will be completed when Zambia's president 
visits Cuba. 
  [Begin recording of Mushota, in English with 
passage-by-passage translation into Spanish] What I can tell you 
as result of our visit is that Zambia and Cuba have agreed, in 
principle, that by the time Zambia's president visits Cuba, we 
should be in a position to sign an agreement for developing the 
sugar industry and its by-products in Zambia, with Cuba 
providing technical assistance and Zambia financing all the 
operations. The details of this agreement will be made public 
when Zambia's president visits Cuba. That is my delegation's 
success story. [end recording] 
  Mushota added that regarding sports, Zambia will send soccer 
trainers to Cuba and, in turn, will host Cuban trainers in 
athletics, baseball, and boxing. Zambia will also receive Cuban 
assistance in getting ready for the African games and future 
Olympic games.

<F P=106> [Report by Barbara Betancur from the "Evening Information </F>
Review" newscast] 
  [Text] As has been reported, Zambian Foreign Minister Remmy 
Mushota is visiting Cuba. Foreign Relations Minister Roberto 
Robaina has commented on possible economic ties that might be 
established with Zambia and other topics of interest. 
  [Begin recording] [Robaina] Our people want to find an 
economic solution to the situation we are facing. This economic 
solution does not only depend on finding business deals that are 
more or less advantageous. It also depends on what constitutes a 
need for us but which could become an investment opportunity for 
others. In all honesty, we have things that could be useful to 
other countries and, in this particular case, to Zambia. The 
foreign minister is visiting with this delegation to expand on 
the talks we began in Zambia and to contact the Ministries and 
institutes that control agriculture, tourism, sports, health, 
and education. 
  [Unidentified reporter] What trade potential does... 
[pauses] 
What does Zambia have that Cuba needs, and what does Cuba have... 
  [Robaina, interrupting] No, the potential is not excessively 
great. We cannot develop it based on whether or not great 
potential exists. We develop it by opening a path in the fields 
of education, health, and sports. We have attained significant 
results, and the Zambians are very interested in learning about 
these results and in establishing important economic trade under 
conditions of mutual benefit. 
  [Reporter] Are there any Zambians here? 
  [Robaina] There are Zambian students who are attending 
universities here mainly in the eastern provinces. 
  [Reporter] They are not on the Isle of Pines? 
  [Robaina] No. In the particular case of Zambia, they are 
studying at the university and [words indistinct]. 
  [Reporter] How many are there? 
  [Robaina] Just a few of them; not very many, but a few. [end 
recording] 
  Robaina also discussed aspects relating to his next Latin 
American tour. 
  [Begin recording] [Robaina] Soon, I will begin a tour 
through 
Latin America on an official visit that includes several 
countries. 
  [Reporter] Which countries? 
  [Robaina] Uruguay, Ecuador, Peru, and Argentina. 
  [Reporter] And how about Paraguay? 
  [Robaina] We are discussing the possibility of an official 
visit to Paraguay. We have no relations with Paraguay; we are 
trying to find a way. It all depends on a confirmation and any 
step that is taken is important, particularly any step that 
helps us know one another better. 
  [Reporter] Any comments on the apology made by the Colombian 
daily EL TIEMPO about the... 
  [Robaina, interrupting] There is a saying that goes like 
this: Sooner or later, life will prove you right. In this case, 
sooner or later, time proved we were right. 
  [Reporter] What is the current status of relations with 
Colombia now that this issue has been resolved? 
  [Robaina] Well, I would avoid using the term current status 
because we feel these relations were never affected. In other 
words, since relations were established, nothing has affected 
them as far as we are concerned. I believe that for those who 
had any doubts, life and reality have proved we were right. We 
have nothing to rectify because from the very beginning we 
voiced what our position was. 
  [Reporter] What did EL TIEMPO say? 
  [Robaina] EL TIEMPO said it regretted having published 
statements that were unfounded, and this evidently made it 
retract the story. I prefer that a final conclusion be made by 
those who read the newspaper's apology. We have nothing else to 
say. Whatever we had to say, we said it at the appropriate time. 
  [Reporter] How about visits by Colombian officials to Cuba? 
  [Robaina] These visits continue; there are no problems in 
this area. 
  [Reporter] Including the visit by the foreign minister? 
  [Robaina] That is right, including the visit by the foreign 
minister. 
  [Reporter] What is your opinion of Gaviria's election to the 
post of OAS secretary general? 
  [Robaina] I think comments on this topic should be made by 
those who are members of that organization. I think Gaviria is a 
conscientious person who has prestige and is well respected, and 
this will be helpful. 
  [Reporter] He speaks about more solidarity and a strong 
relationship among all countries of the region. 
  [Robaina] I think that this is a good thing for a new 
secretary general to say. [end recording] 
  You have just heard statements made by Cuban foreign 
minister 
after receiving in Havana his Zambian counterpart, Remmy 
Mushota. In addition to the official talks with his counterpart, 
the Zambian visitor will also meet with the heads of the sugar 
industry; public health; the Sports Institute; the State 
Committee for Economic Cooperation; and Carlos Lage, vice 
president of the State Council.

attending the sixth session of the joint commission for the 
development of economic and trade relations between China and 
Cuba, departed today for her country after a one-week stay in 
our country. 
  Agreements were signed this morning in which both sides 
commit to boosting the development of projects for economic 
cooperation on the basis of mutual benefit. These agreements 
include China's willingness to supply Cuba with food and 
medicine in exchange for sugar. The Chinese delegation held 
meetings with numerous ministers and toured centers of 
scientific-technical interest in Havana. 
  Just hours before their departure, the delegation met with 
Cuban President Fidel Castro. Regarding her meeting with Fidel, 
(Hao Chiang Siu) said she was honored to have met with the 
highest-ranking leader of the Cuban Revolution. Cuban Foreign 
Trade Minister Ricardo Cabrisas pointed out that all the goals

Cabada, place and date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] Mexican Ambassador Carlos Tello has confirmed that 
Cuba will refine oil from diverse sources in conjunction with a 
Mexican enterprise. The Mexican radio station, Radio Rey, 
recently announced an accord between Cuba and Mexico to refine 
oil from various sources in Cienfuegos. Radio Rebelde 
interviewed Carlos Tello in Havana on this subject: 
  [Begin recording] [Tello] A letter of intent between the 
Cuban Government and the Mexican enterprise Mexpetrol has been 
signed. The goal is to join forces in operating Cienfuegos' fuel 
refinery through a joint enterprise. Work has begun to this 
effect. I believe that soon, very soon, we will see this 
enterprise in full operation. The idea is to refine oil, not 
always from Mexico. The refinery can handle approximately 60,000 
barrels a day, refine it, and sell the product to the Cuban 
market with the surplus, of course, being marketed to markets 
abroad. 
  [Cabada] Will its profits be divided between Mexico and 
Cuba? 
  [Tello] What is divided? 
  [Cabada] That which is accrued from the refining process. 
  [Tello] No. The product of the refinery will be for Cuba and 
the surplus will be for the market abroad. [end recording]

  [Text] Montevideo, 3 Apr (DPA) -- Today, Cuban Ambassador 
to Uruguay Manuel Aguilera said the government of Cuban 
President Fidel Castro may be willing to allow foreign investors 
to play a greater role in the country's enterprises. The 
diplomatic spokesman added, "We in the Castro administration are 
resorting to mechanisms that are even more flexible than those 
adopted by the PRC when it began implementing its economic 
reforms. The mechanisms are so flexible that we may even 
consider making some exceptions." 
  Aguilera, who recently took office, pointed out that 
although 
Cuba insists on maintaining its position of using "mostly Cuban 
capital" within the majority of joint enterprises, "we are 
willing to make exceptions in cases of national interest." 
  In an interview granted to LA REPUBLICA newspaper, Aguilera 
stressed, "there could be a case of a joint enterprise in which 
the state would not own most of the stock; that is, most of the 
capital would come from a foreign firm or from several foreign 
firms." As for Cuba's opposition to implementing a free market 
economy, Aguilera explained that in order to move forward, "we 
must create innovative methods that allow us not only to retain 
the ownership of our basic means of production and resources, 
but also to unleash certain forces [liberen determinadas 
fuerzas]." Havana's representative in Montevideo said that the 
unleashing of these forces "will create a tangible Cuban 
presence in international markets by way of joint enterprises. 
This is why we are opening the country (Cuba) to foreign 
capital; we need resources, technology, and markets." 
  Aguilera's statements were disclosed just before Cuban 
Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina's 4 April arrival. Robaina is 
scheduled to make a three-day official visit to Uruguay. 
Uruguayan political circles are viewing Robaina's arrival with 
heightened interest because a foreign minister under the Castro 
administration has not visited this South American country since 
1986, when former President Julio Maria Sanguinetti was in 
power. The last trip made by a Cuban foreign minister to Uruguay 
took place 20 years after the two countries broke off bilateral 
diplomatic relations. One diplomatic source in Montevideo 
reported that after meeting with Uruguayan President Luis 
Lacalle and other prominent individuals, Robaina will visit 
Peru, Argentina, and Paraguay.

<F P=106> [Interview with Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina by </F>
Barbara Betancur; place and date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Betancur] Mr. Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina, 
could you evaluate your extensive tour of Asia? 
  [Robaina] I would say that it was as fruitful as it was 
extensive. We opened broad channels of communications, which 
both sides needed. The entire region, which is an example of 
significant economic progress, is eager to know more about Cuba, 
what Cuba can offer, and what it needs. Cuba needs to know more 
about this economic progress or how to attain the economic 
results Asia enjoys today. 
  [Betancur] Did you find any experiences we can apply here in 
the economic reactivation process we are now conducting? 
  [Robaina] Yes, I believe so. I believe there are many 
things, but, most important, there is room for many businessmen 
from all of these countries to come here. There is a great deal 
of interest in the results we have achieved in this project -- 
namely, results in the areas of education, health, sports, and 
science. They are interested in seeing, studying, and learning 
about many things in our sugar harvest and tourism. Several 
foreign ministers, in a reciprocal gesture, announced they will 
visit us soon, accompanied by members of their respective 
business communities. We updated several agreements and signed a 
few new ones. I think this, more than anything else, was a visit 
for today's diplomacy. Today's diplomacy is none other than that 
which opens the way to resolving the basic problems of nations 
and people. Our basic problem is our economy. Therefore, this 
visit was marked especially by an open exchange of opinions on 
strictly economic issues. 
  [Betancur] What kind of receptiveness did you find for 
Cuba's 
position in countries like Thailand or Myanmar [Burma], with 
which we have no major contacts at this time considering the 
geographical distance between us? 
  [Robaina] Apart from the distance problem, it was quite 
impressive to see the degree of interest in commercial trade. 
They are convinced that Cuba represents a viable place to do 
business with opportunities and a future. Now, this is solely 
dependent on what we are doing here. We exist today and we 
receive all of this respect and understanding from these 
countries because of the people's will to resist. I believe this 
is true in India, Malaysia, and other countries. Then, of 
course, there are those with which we have normal relations, so 
we met on very different terms. Vietnam is one example of this. 
  All in all, it was a truly extensive and fruitful trip that 
opened opportunities in both directions. Let me stress this 
issue of opportunities in both directions, because Cuba is not 
wandering around the world as a beggar. Cuba simply has many 
needs that provide investment opportunities for others. At the 
same time, Cuba has achieved many results which can provide 
significant solutions to the needs of others. 
  [Betancur] Closely related to this issue is the fact that 
there is a sports delegation from Malaysia that is about to 
arrive, unless it already has arrived. 
  [Robaina] Yes, it should be arriving soon. They have great 
interest in the results of our efforts and are interested in 
making more efficient use of trainers in all types of sports. 
  [Betancur] One last question: I believe Cuba is a member of 
a 
trade and development database exchange center. What benefits 
does this offer us, and what kind of outlook did you find for us 
there? 
  [Robaina] This allows us to put all of Cuba's economic 
information into the database and receive all of the information 
we need to complete economic transactions, with very little 
negotiation needed with each nation. This was created by a group 
of 15 nations. There were 14 up until now, and Cuba is the 15th 
nation to join this group and the fourth from Latin America. 
  [Betancur] One last question, and this is really the last 
one: You have just arrived, but we will have to ask you for 
another interview very soon. You are leaving for Latin America. 
What will your mission be this time? 
  [Robaina] I believe anything that has to do with our foreign 
policy is essentially related to our immediate surroundings, the 
region to which we belong and take pride in. America is our 
natural environment. Here we find the greatest opportunity for 
us to grow, given our geography, our culture, and our 
traditions. We are also answering invitations from several 
foreign ministers and making certain contacts before the 
Ibero-American Summit in order to get a feel for the 
opportunities and perspectives the summit itself will offer. 
  [Betancur] Thank you for the interview and I wish you 
success.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina by Rey </F>
Rodriguez and Roberto Cabada at the Foreign Ministry in Havana 
on 4 April -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Rodriguez] On this Sunday dedicated to Cuban youth, 
we could not fail to meet with a man who for many years was the 
leader of the Cuban youth and is today at the helm of the 
Foreign Ministry. Mr. Minister, how do you reconcile your youth 
with your ministry post? 
  [Robaina] First of all, I would like to say that a person 
with certain responsibilities right now cannot be missing this 
Sunday; what is important to me is the young people on whom Cuba 
relies. I believe that today, and every Sunday, the young people 
are present through their effort, work, and participation. I 
believe that to reconcile this is not so hard, for several 
reasons. 
  First, I am not as young as many think. Second, I believe 
that Cuba's foreign policy is made by the people; in this, that 
youth have a real and specific participation. On the other hand, 
I do not think my youth is at the helm of the Ministry. The 
Ministry and Cuba's foreign policy are made up of an 
accumulation of youth who lead and conduct our foreign policies. 
Therefore, I do not think my mission is the hardest. 
  [Rodriguez] You have just returned from a tour of eight 
Asian 
nations. What is your opinion of the trip? 
  [Robaina] I believe it was highly positive, particularly 
since it was a remarkably open forum to tell the truth about our 
project and to explain to the world that Cuba is not only 
seeking the solutions it needs but has many highly positive and 
successful things to offer, things needed by many worldwide, 
particularly in that region. I believe that it is important for 
us to thoroughly study that region which has so many economic 
accomplishments in order to find out how many can be adapted to 
our character, our ways, and the pressures we are subject to and 
under which we are building our project. 
  [Cabada] You will be departing to Latin America shortly. I 
would like to confirm the countries you will be visiting and 
what your expectations are. 
  [Robaina] This is simply a follow-up to the effort being 
made 
in South America; this is one aspect of that effort. This trip 
is in response to invitations from countries such as Argentina, 
Uruguay, Peru, Ecuador, and Paraguay. We seek the same thing 
that Cuba has sought throughout the years with its foreign 
policy: a forum to explain what we are doing, with all our 
virtues and defects, and also a forum from which to learn. 
  When we speak of this, Latin America has a special place. I 
believe that doing this as the Latin American summit nears gives 
us an opportunity to turn that forum into what the Latin 
American peoples hope it will become.

  [Text] On 1 April, the World-Class Sports Conference 
featured an address by Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina on the 
principal points of Cuba's foreign policy and the role that 
sports plays in it: 
  [Begin Robaina recording] I must stress that our most 
significant ambassadors are in the field of sports. Athletes 
like Sotomayor, Ana Fidelia, and many others can attract 100,000 
people to a stadium. These athletes can tackle the most diverse 
issues. None of our diplomats, not the most acclaimed or 
trained, can in such a short period achieve what one of our 
modest athletes can -- transmit Cuba's image abroad. 
  I just spoke with our trainer in Thailand. During the first 
official meeting in Bangkok with that country's foreign 
minister, the number one issue of the talks was Cuba's trainer 
there. They wanted to know if we had more and how we do it. I 
believe this reflects not only what has already been 
accomplished, but what we are willing to do and are capable of 
doing. [end recording]

  [Text] Perhaps the most important event in the region will 
be the forthcoming world summit on sustainable development, to 
take place in Barbados. Representatives from member countries of 
the alliance of small insular states are expected to participate 
in this summit. Parallel to the world summit on small insular 
states that will take place in Barbados, a forum on 
nongovernment organizations will also take place in the capital, 
at which Cuban youth will be present. (Damodar Pena), one of the 
Cuban representatives to that forum, outlines some of the 
subjects that will be discussed in that forum. 
  [Begin recording] [(Pena)] One of the subjects is social and 
environmental policies on sustainable development, the work that 
youth can do in this regard, and some action plans concerning 
what can be done in countries such as ours, taking into account 
the fact that this is essentially a meeting of developing 
nations and of small islands. This forum will discuss what can 
be done in these islands in the quest for sustainable 
development. 
  [Unidentified reporter] What is the Cuban youth experience 
in 
this context? 
  [(Pena)] The Cuban youth have actively participated in all 
discussions on the development of ecology in Cuba for a long 
time. I can tell you that the national bureau [not further 
identified] discussed this subject in January 1992 and again in 
December of the same year, and it was agreed that the youth 
should be charged with these issues and that a national ecology 
group should be created. 
  In May 1993, the ecology issue was discussed in the Isle of 
Youth when a set of guidelines was established, especially for 
those issues having to do with youth, such as environmental 
education of the new generation. I think this is a very 
important aspect in which the youth, together with several 
social organizations such as the Ministries of Educatio and 
Culture and the communities can do much to teach the people to 
take care of the environment, love it, and use it for their own 
benefit without harming its stability. These are the essential 
things carried out by the youth in this regard. [end recording]

  [Text] Mexico City, 1 Apr (DPA) -- Three other persons 
suspected of participating in the assassination of Luis Donaldo 
Colosio, Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI] candidate for 
president, have been arrested in Tijuana. 
  According to the radio station Radio Red, three or four 
persons involved in Colosio's assassination were taken from 
Tijuana to Mexico City in deep secrecy. The radio station says 
that everything indicates the persons are Vicente Mayoral 
Valenzuela and his son Rodolfo Mayoral, security agents during 
Colosio's visit to Lomas Taurinas, a Tijuana neighborhood, and 
witnesses to his death. Another person reportedly is Rodolfo 
Rivapalacio, coordinator of Colosio's security in Tijuana, who 
hired members of the group known as Tucan for security tasks. 
The station went on to say that the group includes a fourth 
person, whom the station has not yet identified. 
  Mario Aburto Martinez, a 23-year-old mechanic, and former 
policeman Tranquilino Sanchez Vanegas, 57, accused of having 
assisted the killer, are officially being held at the Almoloya 
de Juarez Maximum Security Prison. In addition, the Mexico City 
press today mentioned the possibility of the murder being 
ordered by drug traffickers, who intended to divert public 
attention.

Donaldo Colosio Murrieta, former PRI [Institutional 
Revolutionary Party] presidential candidate. The commission 
will continue to gather any new evidence Baja California 
residents may present and send it to the attorney general of the 
republic. Francisco Javier Reynoso Nino, Baja California 
Congress secretary, has made this announcement in Mexicali. 
  [Begin Reynoso recording] We have started direct relations 
with the two chambers of Congress, the chambers of deputies and 
senators. Those contacts will, of course, be in both directions 
and directed to further the investigations. We know, of course, 
Congress is not an office to investigate crimes, but we will be 
attentive to any information that becomes available and we will 
immediately report it to the corresponding authorities. [end

  Reynoso also said that although the Baja California State 
Congress is not an investigative office, it can volunteer 
available information to further the Special Prosecutor's 
Office's investigation of the criminal case. He added the Baja 
California Congress is demanding Colosio's murder be clarified 
to the satisfaction of all the people.

<F P=106> [Report by Isabel Becerril] </F>
  [Text] The industrial sector has stated it is determined to 
fully support any actions President Carlos Salinas de Gortari 
may take to solve the country's problems. The decision was made 
after the more than 464 members of the National Association of 
Processing Industry (Canacintra) executive commission and board 
of directors decided to vote in favor of a motion proposed by 
its president, Victor Manuel Terrones Lopez. During the meeting, 
Terrones urged all Canacintra members not to allow any 
nonfulfillments regarding the Stability, Competitiveness and 
Employment Pact (Pece) "because at this time, the country's 
situation is quite delicate." 
  As a result of the manufacturers' concern prompted by recent 
developments in Mexico, Terrones Lopez said now more than ever 
it is necessary for the country's industrial sector, regardless 
of beliefs or affiliation, to join forces with the president in 
order to strengthen the nation. He added it is not the president 
who is in jeopardy now but, rather, the entire nation. "We must 
unite so we can reclaim the levels of social peace, justice, and 
liberty we once enjoyed only a few months ago," he said. 
  Replying to a question by a member who participated in the 
monthly Canacintra meeting on 22 March on whether the president 
had requested support from the manufacturers, Terrones Lopez 
responded the president had not so requested. He added, 
nevertheless, it was Canacintra's obligation to support the 
country and that if they had to, they would back the president. 
  Likewise, the Canacintra leader requested its members remain 
calm, saying the country's authorities were already taking the 
necessary measures to prevent the country from falling apart. 
The Canacintra president urged his associates not to become too 
apprehensive, saying, "at this time it is important for us to 
work." He said apprehension is the first step in demoralizing a 
country or making it deteriorate further. He promised the more 
than 464 Canacintra manufacturers there will be peace and that 
they will seek to ensure certainty "but that no way will they 
abandon President Salinas." 
  During the meeting, it was agreed that all delegates 
throughout the Mexican republic would immediately contact their 
respective state governments to offer support. Likewise, they 
would conduct a campaign to urge all sectors of the country to 
remain united to support the institutions. They reiterated their 
commitment, respect, encouragement, and unrestricted support to 
the president concerning the measures he may adopt to clarify 
the events troubling the nation. Terrones said the country's 
manufacturers are aware the economic program has been adequate 
and that from that viewpoint we can conclude there is a need for 
the manufacturing sector to integrate, and "in this we will not 
fail."

<F P=106> [From the "Early Morning" newscast] </F>
  [Text] During his visit to Agualeguas, Nuevo Leon, 
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari sent a message of unity and 
harmony to all Mexicans. In reference to Jose Cordoba Montoya, 
the president indicated that he is a Mexican citizen who works 
with devotion and his experience will help spur on the IDB 
[Inter-American Development Bank], an institution that is of 
interest to Latin America. 
  Later, President Salinas was asked his opinion on the 
appointment of the new PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] 
presidential candidate. 
  [Begin recording] [Salinas] Most of all it is a message of 
unity, encouragement and harmony. 
  [Unidentified speaker] Welcome, Carlos. 
  [Salinas] Thank you. 
  [Speaker] God bless you. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Mr. President, with respect to 
[words 
indistinct] of your adviser [Jose] Cordoba Montoya, what were 
the reasons? 
  [Salinas] Mr. Jose Cordoba is a Mexican citizen who has 
worked loyally. I am very fond of him and value his services, 
experience, and capability as related to economic issues. I am 
quite sure these attributes will allow him to contribute 
positively to an institution such as the IDB which is very 
important to Latin America's economic and financial interests. 
  [Reporter] Is there any advice you could give him? 
  [Salinas] [words indistinct] 
  [Reporter] Are there any recommendations you could make to 
Mr. Montoya now that he is about to embark on another duty? 
  [Salinas] Only one. I can only recommend that he use his 
great capabilities and experience in [words indistinct]. 
  [Reporter] Mr. President, does the mourning for Mr. 
Colosio's 
death continue? 
  [Salinas] Friday was declared a day of national mourning as 
a 
result of his death.... 
  [Reporter, interrupting] Is this why you have to return? 
  [Salinas] Most of all because of fondness for a lost friend. 
  [Reporter] Mr. President, what can you say about the 
country's current situation? 
  [Salinas] I repeat, my message is one of unity, 
encouragement, and harmony. [end recording] 
  Later on, President Salinas was asked about the nomination 
of 
the new PRI presidential candidate to which he pointed out that 
during 1993 Mr. Zedillo had been one of the leading contenders 
and that he is an intelligent person committed to democracy and 
the legal order. The president added that Mr. Zedillo will be an 
element of unity and harmony.

  [Text] Torreon, Coahuila, 28 March -- Today, federal 
Judicial Police [PJF] personnel seized more than four tons of 
cocaine and arrested two alleged drug traffickers who were 
transporting the drug in a tanker truck on the road from this 
city to Concepcion del Oro, Zacatecas. 
  PJF Commander Juan Carlos Alvarado reported Raul Juarez de 
la 
Paz and Miguel Angel Salazar Ramirez, both from Uruapan, 
Michoacan, were arrested during the police action. Both men 
testified that they received the merchandise in Guadalajara, 
Jalisco and were taking it to Cadereyta, Nuevo Leon. 
  The policemen initially stopped the truck for speeding on 
the 
road to Concepcion del Oro in Zacatecas and discovered the large 
cocaine shipment while checking the vehicle. The 4,187 kg of 
cocaine had been placed in 2,162 packages in the vehicle's tank. 
The PJF commander said the drug shipment and the two men were 
placed in the custody of the Federal Attorney General's Office 
in Saltillo, Coahuila.

  [Excerpts] Mexico City, 1 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- The Bank of 
Mexico (central) has started operating as an autonomous 
government organization. Its main objective is to contain the 
country's inflation at moderate levels, similar to the ones in 
industrialized nations. The central institution has, as of this 
Friday, the authority to deny loan requests to cover the 
government's fiscal deficits, one of the factors which 
contributed greatly to high inflation rates. "Sharp and 
prolonged inflation rates are closely linked to fiscal 
deficits," President Carlos Salinas de Gortari said in his 
legislative effort to give autonomy to the Bank of Mexico on 17 
May 1993. [passage omitted] 
  The Bank of Mexico's autonomy is based on the bank's board 
of 
directors, which consists of a governor and four deputy 
governors who are to be proposed by the executive branch and 
ratified by Congress. On 26 March, Congress ratified the 
presidential proposal to appoint current Bank of Mexico Director 
Miguel Mancera Aguayo as the first governor of the autonomous 
institution for an eight-year term. [passage omitted] 
  According to the law, Mancera will occupy the governor's 
post 
for three years and nine months, and the deputy governors will 
hold their positions in terms that vary from nine months, two 
years and nine months, four years and nine months, and six years 
and nine months. The deputy governors are Guillermo Prieto 
Fortun, who will occupy the position until 31 December 1994; 
Ariel Buira, until the same month in 1996; Jesus Marco Yacaman, 
until December 1998; and Francisco Gil Diaz, until December 
2000. A board of directors position is a solid one, and the 
directors can only be removed in case of a serious misdeed.

<F P=106> [Report by Gustavo Lomelin and Georgina Howard; quotation </F>
marks as published] 
  [Text] Miguel Mancera Aguayo set aside his bluntness -- he 
seems more cordial -- but does not lose his seriousness when he 
says the new economic strategy is "appropriate for the times 
through which the country is going. He rejected the notion 
there might be risks of currency instability, saying the central 
bank's independence will strengthen states' initiatives. 
  With only a few hours remaining before leaving to occupy the 
new post of governor of the Bank of Mexico (Banxico), Mancera 
admits: "It is a great challenge and an enormous responsibility 
that we will have to face." Now, as of 1 April, "no state agency 
or institution will be able to pressure the central bank into 
approving credit "without the government board's approval," and 
that, he insisted, "is very healthy for the economy." 
  In brief statements to this newspaper after being sworn-in 
before the congressional Permanent Commission of the Union as 
new Banxico governor, Mancera weighs the experience of deputy 
governors Guillermo Prieto Fortun, Francisco Gil Diaz, Ariel 
Buira, and Jesus Marcos Yacaman. He adds these are people who 
are very familiar with the country's financial system. 
  Franciso Gil Diaz, also interviewed by EL FINANCIERO, said: 
Banxico's greatest challenge, starting with this new legal 
framework, will lie in each of us getting to know what will be 
our responsibilities. "I have been with the bank for 25 years, 
and, nevertheless, I still have to get used to the institution, 
its new provisions, as well as its financial operations." 
  Gil Diaz added he believes Banxico officials, who will be 
assuming this responsibility, will have to do a little more of 
the same and "exert a little more effort" because we all have 
had specific duties; some even had operational obligations in 
addition to local obligations. 
<H5>  The Key: Budget Independence </H5>
  When asked how there can be budget independence within an 
official structure, the up until now under secretary of revenues 
of the Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit (SHCP) 
explained: New legislation allows the bank to handle its own 
budget. 
  Wages, for example, are established with a stipulation that 
could subordinate the bank due to the higher wages its officials 
earn. Bank supervision is included in the law, but under a 
different agency in order to prevent "supervisory" elements from 
being used to apply any pressures; "in other words, everything 
is well established." 
  Mancera agreed this operation is in accordance with legal 
provisions included in Banxico's new legal framework. Gil Diaz 
recalled a new bank organization law had been enacted starting 
from the constitutional reforms. The new law includes 
stipulations on the central bank's activities. 
<H5>  Strengthening of Currency Exchange </H5>
  Mancera had to wait more than two hours to take his oath of 
office because the legislators could not see eye to eye on 
whether to appoint Miguel Montes. He did not reject any of the 
questions. Instead he tried to be as precise as possible. "The 
national bank's autonomy will aid in correcting the financial 
situation and strengthening the currency." He did not evade any 
questions either. The situation the country is facing, he 
added, will not affect the peso's stability in the least. The 
bank has had no reason to intervene because exchange rate 
activity has stayed within normal boundaries. 
  He predicted the activity surrounding the dollar-peso 
exchange rate will not affect the economic outlook, as they will 
tend to level off. Proof of this is that Mexico has not needed 
to use any of the $6 billion the Clinton administration has 
offered. He said the central bank's new autonomous nature will 
help to strengthen the national currency. He denied it would 
create division between the state and the people, as a Popular 
Socialist Party legislator has charged. The draft bill, now 
approved, is clear about this issue and is consistent with the 
state's authority. 
  The basic issue here, he added, is there will no longer be 
indiscriminate credit for any agency. This is, he commented, 
consistent with the country's process of economic opening and 
modernization. 
<H5>  Foreign Approval </H5>
  According to several analysts, local and foreign banks alike 
have welcomed the appointment because "Miguel Mancera Aguayo's 
experience and dedication within the Mexican financial system is 
well proven." They also said he has the international financial 
community's recognition, support, prestige, and respect. 
Analysts from the Deutsche Bank, Banamex, Bancomer, and the 
Swiss Bank agree it is precisely he who "knows Mexican financial 
policy inside out." 
  Directors at Banpais have said the new structure of the Bank 
of Mexico plus Miguel Mancera Aguayo at the helm are a guarantee 
that the financial policy will not drift off course, financial 
reorganization will continue, the corporation's resources will 
be safeguarded, and investor confidence will grow. 
  Analysts from Deutsche Bank, the Bank of Montreal, and the 
National Bank of Paris have said the central financial agency 
must continue its clear and efficient performance in order to 
protect the peso. They say the current challenge will be to 
maintain and consolidate Mexico's economic, social, political, 
financial, and monetary stability.

  [Text] Mexico City, 1 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- Costa Rican 
President Rafael Angel Calderon will begin a visit to Mexico on 
5 April. The government has reported Calderon and his colleague, 
Carlos Salinas de Gortari, will sign a free trade agreement 
during his visit. The Foreign Secretariat announced this 
Thursday that during Calderon's visit to Mexico he will sign 
this agreement with Salinas de Gortari and will also meet with 
Finance Secretary Pedro Aspe Armella, as well as with a group of 
Costa Rican businessmen. The agreement is the confirmation of 
Mexico's commitment to the Latin American integration process, 
the Foreign Secretariat report revealed. It also stated this 
will be the country's first free trade agreement with a Central 
American nation. 
  The treaty will open a new phase in relations between both 
countries and will lay the foundation for more in-depth, more 
efficient complementary economic relations between Central 
America and Mexico, the document added. It did not specify, 
however, how long Calderon will stay in Mexico. 
  Costa Rican Commerce Minister Roberto Rojas and Mexican 
Commerce Secretary Jaime Serra Puche headed the negotiations for 
the bilateral pact, which ended in San Jose on 3 March. The 
agreement is the most advanced pact in Latin America, because it 
not only covers the free exchange of goods and services but also 
includes investments and solutions to commercial differences, 
Serra Puche stated when the negotiations ended. 
  When the officials successfully ended their negotiations, 
the 
text of the pact was sent to specialized lawyers in both 
countries for a legal revision, and they wrote the final draft 
of the treaty. Once it is signed, the treaty has to be ratified 
by the legislative branches and promulgated by the executive 
branches in both countries so it can go into effect on 1 January 
1995. 
  The treaty stipulates that both countries will give each 
other gradual tariff advantages on more than 8,400 products. The 
tax cuts will be assigned in three stages. The first phase 
covers products that will be allowed to enter both countries 
without paying custom duties as soon as the agreement goes into 
effect. The second covers items that will not have to pay custom 
duties in the next five years, and the third includes products 
that can be imported tax free in the next 10 years. 
  As soon as the treaty goes into effect, Mexican businessmen 
can export to Costa Rica at least 65 percent of the products on 
the tariff lists without paying custom duties. Costa Rica will 
also be able to sell Mexico 80 percent of the goods on the 
tariff lists without paying custom duties. Those percentages 
amount to between 4,000 and 5,000 products that will be allowed 
to enter the respective countries without paying custom duties.

  [Text] San Jose, 29 Mar (ACAN-EFE) -- Costa Rica has 
abandoned the "banana war" it was waging with other Latin 
American nations against the European Union (EU) and accepted an 
offer shortly after the defeat of Costa Rican Foreign Minister 
Bernd Niehaus as OAS secretary general. Roberto Rojas, Costa 
Rican foreign trade minister, told ACAN-EFE that this agreement, 
negotiated last week with Rene Steichen, EU commissioner for 
agricultural matters, "has nothing to do" with Colombian 
President Cesar Gaviria's election as OAS secretary general. 
Rojas assured that the largest banana producers in the 
Caribbean, such as Belize and Jamaica, voted for Costa Rica on 
Sunday in Washington and that the agreement with the EU 
safeguards the advantages it has always granted to these small 
nations. 
  At the OAS election, some Caribbean nations, as well as 
Panama and Ecuador, which had committed their votes to Costa 
Rica, broke their pledges at the last minute and voted for the 
Colombian president. This gave Gaviria the victory to lead the 
OAS for the next five years. 
  These events caused strong misgivings in Costa Rican 
diplomatic and political circles because, according to Rojas, 
vigorous U.S. pressure in support of Gaviria included the use of 
the banana issue as a negotiating tool. Nevertheless, the Costa 
Rican minister assured that the "banana war" did not have a 
bearing on changes in OAS votes, although there was an attempt 
to link the "banana war" to Foreign Minister Niehaus' bid to 
become OAS secretary general. Neihaus lost to Gaviria by a vote 
of 20-14. 
  The European commissioner today appeared satisfied with the 
agreement which, besides resolving the dispute, "assures that 
the EU's objectives in regulating banana imports will continue 
to be respected." For Steichen, this guarantees respect for the 
interests of EU banana consumers and producers, as well as of 
the producers of the fruit in Africa, the Caribbean, and the 
Pacific. 
  Costa Rica was the most ardent challenger -- followed by 
Colombia -- of the EU restrictions that have been in force since 
July. Costa Rica now will benefit the most by this agreement. 
The agreement grants Costa Rica a 23.4 percent share (25 
million cases) of the quota established for all banana imports 
from Latin America. Of the 2.1-million ton quota for this year 
and 2.2-million tons for next year, Colombia will obtain 22 
percent, Nicaragua 3 percent, and Venezuela 2 percent. 
  The agreement also includes a reduction in (import) tariffs 
from 100 ECU's [European Currency Units] ($112) per ton to 75 
ECU's ($75), as well as granting 70 percent of the import 
licenses to the producing nation. This was one of the most 
controversial issues in the Latin American-EU dispute. 
  Europe imposed a quota system on Latin American banana 
imports on 1 July, reducing its purchases from 2.5 million to 2 
million tons. This unleashed charges from the Latin Americans -- 
led by Costa Rica -- before the GATT, which ultimately ruled in 
favor of the producers, claiming that the EU system violated 
basic GATT principles. 
  The other four nations -- Ecuador, the world's largest 
producer that will have a smaller quota to export to the EU; 
Panama; Honduras; and Guatemala -- will continue their struggle 
before GATT. Of these nations, only Guatemala is a full member 
of this trade agreement, while Honduras is in the process of 
joining. 
  After a meeting with the Costa Rican producers, Rojas said 
this agreement will allow Costa Rica to arrive feeling satisfied 
at the signing of the Final Document of GATT's Uruguay Round on 
15 April in Marrakesh, Morocco. Rojas stated: "This agreement 
will create market and price stability while resolving this very 
difficult controversy for Costa Rica and the producers." At the 
same time, Rojas highlighted the importance of the European 
market for his country. 
  Rojas assured that his country will remain a member of the 
Union of Banana Exporting Countries and will attend all meetings 
in which this matter is studied. Nevertheless, he made it clear 
that the bloc that had negotiated with the EU has been 
dissolved. In this regard, Rojas said Costa Rica will attend the 
meeting of producing nations to be held in Panama on 8 April to 
explain the reasons for and the terms under which Costa Rica 
accepted the EU's proposal.

<F P=106> [Report by Raul Beltran Bonilla] </F>
  [Text] Early this morning, a U.S. Army lieutenant colonel 
was killed following the explosion of a fragmentation grenade 
inside the barracks of the National Civilian Police located in 
Zacamil neighborhood. The police refused to provide information 
regarding this case. We repeat. A U.S. Army colonel was killed 
early this morning after a fragmentation grenade blew up when 
the aforementioned military officer was taking it from inside 
one of the offices of the National Civilian Police [PNC] in 
Zacamil Neighborhood. 
  According to the report, the incidents developed in the 
following manner: A U.S. Embassy international mission vehicle 
was passing near Zacamil neighborhood at midnight. It was going 
at a very high speed. The vehicle was occupied by a driver and 
two other individuals who accompanied him. According to a 
confidential report provided to the YSKL news center, the 
vehicle's occupants were drunk. At midnight, the U.S. Embassy 
international mission vehicle was passing by the Zacamil 
neighborhood when a PNC patrol ordered it to stop. The 
individuals inside the vehicle did not heed the call to stop 
made by the PNC. Minutes later the PNC officers proceeded to 
contact other nearby units and the vehicle was stopped. The 
three occupants of the vehicle were arrested. The three were 
Salvadoran citizens and they were drunk. Three drunk 
Salvadorans were driving the U.S. Embassy vehicle. When the 
police registered the vehicle, they found a Beretta pistol and a 
fragmentation grenade. The police then proceeded to turn over 
the three U.S. Embassy security officers, who are Salvadoran 
nationals and whose names are being withheld for the time being, 
to the PNC's Zacamil Barracks. 
  As usual, the PNC, following precise instructions, allowed 
the drunk Salvadorans to make a telephone call. They were able 
to contact Lt. Col. Julio Guzman Ramon Rivera, a U.S. national. 
According to a U.S. Embassy report, at 0200 the lieutenant 
colonel showed up at the PNC barracks accompanied by a woman and 
a child. The Beretta pistol and the grenade were on the PNC 
guard commander's table. A PNC sergeant, a corporal in charge of 
office work, and three PNC security members were in the office. 
A U.S. Embassy security member, who accompanied Lt. Col. Julio 
Guzman Ramon Rivera, the woman, and the child, remained outside 
the building. The woman and the child had come to find out about 
the three U.S. Embassy security guards, who had been arrested 
for drunkenness and driving at high speeds in an official 
vehicle. 
  According to the report, the U.S. officer took the grenade 
that was on the table and proceeded to pull out the safety pin, 
saying it was a toy grenade. The PNC members immediately ran 
from the PNC office and the grenade exploded. Lt. Col. Julio 
Guzman Ramon Rivera was taken to the military hospital in 
serious condition in the PNC vehicle with license plate no. 
10-100. The lieutenant colonel died a few hours later. 
  According to the reports, U.S. Army Lt. Col. Julio Guzman 
Ramon Rivera, age 47, was taken to the San Salvador judicial 
center at 0407 in a vehicle with license plate No. 10-100 driven 
by PNC official Faustino Portillo Espinoza. This is the duly 
confirmed report on the death of American Lt. Col. Julio Guzman 
Ramon Rivera. 
  [San Salvador Radio Cadena YSKL in Spanish at 1809 GMT on 3

<F P=106> [From the "National Newscast"] </F>
  [Text] Government Minister Alfredo Mendieta has said that 
recent kidnappings and the assassination of Javier Barahona, the 
deputy mayor of Wiwili, are desperate actions by criminal gangs 
trying to undermine peace. Mendieta added that the government 
is working to combat this situation. 
  [Begin Mendieta recording] We are prepared to fully 
guarantee 
that the disarmament process of the 3-80 Northern Front will 
conclude satisfactorily on 8 April, as scheduled, and that the 
second phase of disarmament will begin tomorrow without any 
delay. [end recording] 
  Mendieta said he would meet with high-ranking EPS [Sandinist 
People's Army] officers to counter the criminal gangs. 
  [Begin recording of Colonel Oswaldo Lacayo, member of the 
EPS 
General Staff] We will conduct operations in full coordination 
with the group being disarmed in the areas surrounding the 3-80 
Northern Front disarmament area to prevent any problems. [end 
recording] 
  According to the EPS, gangs such as those under the command 
of Charro, Nortiel, and Omar are trying to hinder the 
disarmament process, but the International Commission of Support 
and Verification-OAS [CIAV-OAS] believes the peace process is 
well under way. 
  [Begin recording of Sergio Carabana, CIAV-OAS 
representative] 
These incidents are isolated. I believe the government will 
take steps in this regard, and we will help conduct a thorough 
investigation to find the culprits. [end recording] 
  The CIAV-OAS will propose that Barahona's case be discussed 
by the tripartite commission.
