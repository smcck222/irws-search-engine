  [Text] Caracas, 6 Apr EFE -- The Venezuelan Government 
today denied that this country is a drug producer and said that, 
on the contrary, it is a role model for cooperation in the 
struggle against these illegal substances. 
  The Venezuelan Government, through a Foreign Ministry note, 
termed "distorted" recent publications identifying Venezuela as 
being among the countries with the most drug trafficking. 
  The Foreign Ministry note refers to the "Annual Report on 
the 
Strategy for the Control of Drugs at the International Level," 
presented by the U.S. State Department to the U.S. Congress. 
  The Foreign Ministry explains that according to this report, 
"Venezuela is not a narcotics producing nation but a transit 
point for drugs going from Colombia to the United States and 
Europe." 
  The Foreign Ministry further states that "Venezuela is among 
those nations that have given exemplary cooperation in the 
struggle against drugs," recalling a long list of international 
agreements signed toward that goal. 
  The Foreign Ministry cited "as an example of the permanent 
struggle against this scourge" the confiscation of 3,405 kg of 
various drugs in 1993 by Venezuelan police. 
  The official document notes that Venezuela "suffers the 
consequences of the illegal trafficking of narcotics and 
psychotropic substances, particularly of money laundering, a 
corollary of drug trafficking." It requests the cooperation of 
the U.S. Government as "it is time to face this problem 
together."

<F P=106> [Report by Enelcys Calderon] </F>
  [Text] "Corruption is everywhere here. It is an obstacle to 
many things in addition to the counternarcotics effort. Anything 
said about corruption in Venezuela is not an exaggeration." 
Interior Minister Ramon Escovar Salom made those statements in 
Congress, where he was called to answer questions about a U.S. 
State Department report that corruption in Venezuela hinders the 
fight against drug trafficking. 
  The interior minister clarified that he had not read the 
report in question and did not have any details on this specific 
case. He did say, however, that "corruption is a very leafy tree 
in Venezuela." 
<H5>  The Legislators </H5>
  For his part, Gustavo Tarre Briceno, representative of the 
Social Christian Party and chairman of the Chamber of Deputies 
finance committee, said he had read that corruption hindered 
counternarcotics efforts just as it negatively affected any 
other government action. 
  The legislator added that he had not read the State 
Department report, which has appeared only in the press, and 
thus could not comment "on a report that only mentions Venezuela 
in a few lines. I prefer that Venezuela be evaluated by 
Venezuelans." He admitted that this type of report negatively 
affects the government. 
  MIN [National Integrity Movement] legislator Gonzalo Perez 
Hernandez said that if the U.S. Government has such information 
on Venezuela "it is probably true, because it is hard to believe 
that drug traffickers do not know the importance of politicians 
in quieting investigations that could take them or their 
representatives to jail." 
  He added that drug traffickers promote corruption in the 
government security organizations to keep drug traffickers from 
being punished. "If the United States has the names of people 
and institutions at the service of drug traffickers in our 
countries, it should identify them to help us combat drug 
trafficking and the corruption it generates."

<F P=106> [Report by Wilfer Pulgarin] </F>
  [Text] Defense Minister General Rafael Montero Revette 
defended the appointment of his predecessor, Vice Admiral 
Radames Munoz Leon, as adviser for Venezuelan military purchases 
in the United States. At the same time, Montero reported that 
said appointment has the president of the Republic's blessing. 
  Montero Revette had avoided making statements on the matter 
on Tuesday. But, speaking this Wednesday at the Miraflores 
presidential palace, he made extensive comments on this matter 
at the conclusion of a regular Council of Ministers meeting. 
  The defense minister justified that appointment of Munoz 
Leon, recalling the admiral's military career, indicating that 
he came to this position without having missing one promotion: 
"He held the post of chief of the Navy's staff, chairman of the 
joint chiefs of staff, and he was defense minister; therefore he 
has enough experience in the military field." 
  Montero added: "He was going to be living in the United 
States anyway on his own account. I asked him to be an ad 
honorem adviser; he will not draw a salary. He will advise, on 
an ad honorem basis, four departments that we have in the United 
States on military purchases. He has a great deal of experience 
in the military field, and he can advise us because he knows all 
of the organization's problems." 
<H5>  Questions for the Minister </H5>
  Reporters asked the minister several questions. 
  [Reporter] Is there no one else with the same knowledge in 
the military field? 
  [Montero] I would like to know if there is. Previously, when 
he was defense minister, even before he was defense minister, 
hardly anyone ever questioned him. Maybe he was questioned about 
some things he said during his seven-month tenure, but Munoz 
Leon's military career cannot be criticized. Besides this is an 
ad honorem post. 
  [Reporter] Why was he given a diplomatic passport? 
  [Montero] He was given a diplomatic passport because the 
Defense asked for one. 
  [Reporter] Where in the United States will he live? 
  [Montero] I do not know exactly where. 
  [Reporter] It is not clear why he has a diplomatic passport 
if he is not a member of the Venezuelan diplomatic corps in the 
United States. 
  [Montero] He is a member of the diplomatic corps in the 
United States because he has an ad honorem post as a Defense 
Ministry adviser in military organizations through which we 
trade with the United States. 
  [Reporter] Are there other advisers with diplomatic 
passports? 
  [Montes] No, we have not issued any during my tenure. I do 
not know if other ministries have done so. 
  [Reporter] Mr. Minister: The Foreign Service law establishes 
that the members of a diplomatic mission, in order to perform 
their duties, are accredited by one nation to the other. If 
Admiral Munoz Leon is an ad honorem adviser and not a 
representative of a mission, why is he then issued a diplomatic 
passport? 
  [Montes] You could say that he is an ad honorem adviser 
because he will not draw a salary. Nevertheless, I do need him, 
with his contacts--he even took the Inter-American Defense 
course--to give us a lot of advice because he knows about the 
problems. It is easier for him to travel to Venezuela to report 
to me on what is going on over there than to have officials from 
there come back here. 
  [Reporter] Is he going to be a member of the diplomatic 
mission? 
  [Montes] He is a member of the diplomatic mission. 
  [Reporter] Excuse me, Mr. Minister, he has said that a split 
had occurred in the FAN [National Armed Forces] over the 
president's decision not to appoint him defense minister. How 
could this appointment possibly have occurred? 
  [Montes] Look here, listen to the following; I am going to 
repeat myself. Maybe--you know him--he made this remark on the 
spur of the moment because he was not appointed defense 
minister. It is not that he was not appointed; he was not 
reconfirmed. I spoke to him subsequently on several occasions. 
He is aware that what he said was a rash reaction, but he does 
have position within the military. He is an officer with almost 
30 years of experience. He knows the organization, he knows the 
organization's problems, he has run the organization. Therefore, 
I appointed him, having taken this into account. 
  [Reporter] Former Commander Chavez confirmed MAS [Movement 
Toward Socialism] and Radical Cause's charges about the defense 
minister's alleged plan to stage a coup. Doesn't this contradict 
the appointment somewhat? 
  [Montes] When anyone here attacks a military man, they 
accuse 
him of planning a coup. If Commander Chavez, who was detained, 
has hard evidence that a coup was being planned, let him present 
the evidence to the court. It is very easy to talk. I want 
evidence because I am not going to fall into the trap of 
believing everything that many people like to say, just to talk. 
Gentlemen, evidence must be presented. 
  [Reporter] Does the appointment have the president of the 
Republic's blessing? 
  [Montes] Of course it does. I must submit every appointment 
to the president of the Republic for approvel. I requested this 
appointment. 
<H5>  No Millions To Equip the Fan </H5>
  Meanwhile, the defense minister denied information to the 
effect that in going over the accounts with the president, he 
asked that 86 billion bolivares be earmarked for the FAN's 
equipment. 
  It was also reported that all the officers who returned from 
Peru had decided to accept a court martial. 
  Montes also said he will not get involved in "tit-for-tat 
bickering" with former Commander Chavez Frias, although he said 
it is wrong to think, as the coup leader said, that armed 
struggle is a valid means of attaining power. 
  He noted: The nation wants peace, tranquillity, and 
progress. 
  As far as patrolling the Gulf of Venezuela--reported by his 
colleague Miguel Angel Burelli Rivas--he said the physical 
presence that has always existed will be reinforced in a more 
organized fashion.

  [Text] Deputy Prosecutor General Francisco Jose Sintura a 
few minutes ago commented on the U.S. State Department report 
criticizing the Colombian judicial system and the policy of the 
Prosecutor General's Office regarding the surrender of drug 
traffickers. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Mr. Sintura, has 
the prosecutor general capitulated in favor of drug traffickers 
in Colombia? 
  [Sintura] That is not true. A communique that we released 
clearly presents the Prosecutor General's Office position, which 
is this: As long as the existing law forbids drug trafficking 
in every stage, the Office will continue to fight drug 
traffickers and charge them in courts of law. 
  [Reporter] Does the United States have the moral authority 
to 
censure us like this? 
  [Sintura] Well, these are comments that one sovereign state 
makes to another. We have said a few things that we think are 
important, particularly because we understand that the 
generalizations made about the Colombian judicial system can be 
based on either incorrect interpretations of our legal system or 
insufficient reports. [end recording]

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 6 Apr (DPA) -- Colombian Senate 
President Jorge Elias today asked the U.S. Government and 
judicial authorities not to meddle in his country's internal 
affairs. Elias was referring to criticisms made in Washington 
on the methods used to reduce the sentences of drug traffickers 
who surrender. 
  Elias, from the ruling Liberal party, defended the system 
implemented by President Cesar Gaviria while noting that it was 
copied from the method that has been used in the United States 
for several years. 
  "The the United States showed us the rules for surrendering 
to justice, the informers, the sentence reductions. We are 
following them here in Colombia," the congressman said in 
statements to the press. 
  The Senate president's position came in the wake of 
criticisms from the U.S. State Department on the "short" 
sentences for drug traffickers and on the contacts between 
Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff and Cali Cartel attorneys. 
  According to newspaper articles from Washington, the State 
Department believes the Colombian justice system is corrupt and 
is weak before the powerful drug traffickers. It is now in the 
hands of the U.S. Congress to decide whether to suspend judicial 
aid. 
  U.S. officials and spokesmen for the Colombian Prosecutor's 
Office said that in the past weeks the U.S. legal authorities 
stopped sending evidence to Santa Fe de Bogota against drug 
traffickers as a form of protest over statements by de Greiff, 
who said that repression is failing as a means of fighting drug 
trafficking. 
  De Greiff favors legalization of the drug trade as a 
strategy 
to dismantle the drug traffickers' multi-million dollar 
business. His ideas are questioned both in Colombia as well as 
the United States. 
  According to the Senate president, Colombia is a free, 
independent country that can decide if it wants to continue 
using sentence reduction for those who surrender. Since 1990, 
approximately 20 drug traffickers have availed themselves of 
this system. 
  Elias pointed out that U.S. judicial authorities "should be 
more concerned with their own problems -- because they have a 
lot of them -- before they make outrageous, unsubstantiated 
criticisms." 
  The decrees signed by Gaviria at the beginning of his 
administration provide for a significant sentence reduction for 
criminals who surrender, confess to at least one crime, and 
cooperate with justice. 
  De Greiff has been in contact with the attorneys of Gilberto 
Rodriguez, who is accused of being a Cali Cartel leader and is 
considering turning himself in.

<F P=106> [From the "National Newscast" program] </F>
  [Excerpts] Today the "National Newscast" learned about the 
U.S. State Department's annual report on the struggle against 
drug trafficking. 
  The report places the country in the dock and notes that 
corruption is widespread in Colombia, particularly in the 
judicial branch. [passage omitted ] 
  The policy of surrendering to justice which the State 
Department criticizes has also been a controversial issue in 
Colombia. 
  We consulted congressmen who approved the Penal Procedure 
Code: 
  [Begin recording] [Senator Hernan Echeverri] We politely 
reject this insinuation and this sort of U.S. intervention in 
our domestic affairs. 
  [Representative Ramiro Lucio] The Colombian Congress, 
independently -- without consulting the U.S. State Department, 
the Belgian Justice Ministry, or any other authority any where 
in the world -- decided to approve the Penal Procedure Code 
basically including the antidrug policy that the national 
government presented to us. 
  [Senator Alberto Santofimio Botero] What is happening is 
that we are increasingly losing our sovereignty. We are going 
to wind up asking the gringos what we are to do in order to 
issue laws in Colombia. 
  [Representative Edmundo Guevara] It is easier to see the 
mote in your brother's eye than to see the beam in your own. It 
is in the United States where sentences are negotiated. We 
copied from them. [end recording]

<F P=106> [From the "Caracol's 0600 to 0900" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Caracol has just obtained the text of the letter 
sent by Gabriel Silva Lujan, Colombian ambassador to the United 
States, to U.S. Senator John Kerry regarding the senator's 
repeated criticism of the surrender policy and the 
interpretation and implementation of the Penal Procedure Code by 
the Prosecutor General's Office. In a strong response to an 
article by Senator Kerry, which was published in THE WASHINGTON 
POST yesterday, Ambassador Silva Lujan has stated: As you 
acknowledge, the Colombian Government differs in opinion with 
the Prosecutor General's Office, an independent office which is 
part of the judicial branch. These differences, Ambassador 
Silva Lujan has admitted, are still significant; therefore, he 
added, de Greiff's opinions on the negotiation of sentences and 
legalization of drugs do not represent those of the Colombian 
Government. 
  As I have said in the past, Gabriel Silva added, the 
Colombian Government will oppose the surrender of drug 
traffickers under conditions that are inconsistent with their 
level of criminal guilt. Furthermore, the Colombian Government 
has not supported, does not support, nor will support the 
legalization of drugs as a strategy in the antidrug struggle. 
  We at Caracol must add that Prosecutor General Gustavo de 
Greiff's position on this topic is 180 degrees different from 
that of Colombian Ambassador Silva Lujan in that letter. 
  In his two-page letter, whose original was in English and 
whose translation was obtained by Caracol, the ambassador added 
the Cali Cartel's greatest achievement would be to provoke a 
breakdown in judicial cooperation between the two countries. In 
the letter, the ambassador also vehemently rejected the 
assertion Colombia is a narcodemocracy: Colombia, the oldest 
and most politically stable democracy in Latin America, which 
has been maintained despite the narcoterrorists' attacks. The 
Colombian people have made enormous sacrifices in defending 
their democracy. Your hasty assertions are an affront against 
courageous commitment of Colombians to their institutions. 
  In his letter to Senator Kerry, Ambassador Silva also denied 
the senator's assertion the Cali Cartel has significant economic 
interests in the banking, finance, shipping, mining, coffee, 
petroleum, and floral sectors. The ambassador has said such 
assertions are unacceptable and groundless: It is untrue the 
Cali Cartel controls the most important sectors of the Colombian 
economy. These sectors are formed by respectable businessmen and 
companies, many of which have permanent relations with the 
United States. As in other countries, including the United 
States, organized crime seeks to infiltrate certain sectors of 
the legal economy, but this does not mean it controls some of 
these sectors or that the government tolerates its presence. 
  Ambassador Silva has also said that Kerry's statement that 
the Cali Cartel controls important elements of the Colombian 
media is false: For a long time, courageous journalists have 
been at the forefront of the crusade against drug traffickers. 
Investigative journalism in Colombia has played a fundamental 
role, revealing the illegal activities of drug-trafficking 
organizations. For this reason, many journalists and media have 
been victims of the drug cartels' kidnapping, assassinations, 
and terrorist attacks. In short, you have cast an undeserved 
shadow of doubt over the integrity of the Colombian private 
sector and media. 
  The ambassador also referred to the corruption linked to 
drugs, stating this is proliferating not only in Colombia but 
also in the United States; in fact, the ambassador added, 
according to a U.S. Justice Department report, more than 5,000 
federal employees have been found guilty of corruption between 
1970 and 1990. 
  This is the vigorous official reply by the Colombian 
ambassador in Washington, Gabriel Silva Lujan, to Senator Kerry, 
who again attacked our country in an article in THE WASHINGTON 
POST yesterday.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 6 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- The Cuban 
Government has accepted Colombia's conditions for supplying oil 
at international market prices beginning in July, Cuban 
Ambassador Jesus Martinez Revelo reported today . 
  In statements to Colombia's Radio Network (Caracol), the 
diplomat said his country promised to get the letters of credit 
demanded by the state-owned Ecopetrol [Colombian Petroleum 
Enterprise] to formally sign an agreement for the sale of crude 
oil. 
  The Colombian oil company said the guarantees offered by the 
island's government two weeks ago to finalize the negotiations 
were unsatisfactory. 
  Guido Nule, Colombian energy and mines minister, announced 
in 
February that his country would supply Havana with between 
15,000 and 20,000 barrels of oil per day at international market 
prices. 
  According to the company's president, Juan Maria Rendon, the 
proposal from Fidel Castro's government to cover the cost of the 
transaction with sugar through a third-party transaction lacks 
the backing of a letter of credit. 
  Nevertheless, the Cuban diplomat explained that he recently 
met with Rendon and promised to get the letters of credit 
demanded by the state-owned business 
  "We will do whatever is necessary to defend our country's 
interests while reaching an agreement with Colombia in this 
matter," Martinez said, while emphasizing the Colombian 
Government's "positive attitude" toward Cuba. 
  Colombia's announcement that it would sell oil to the island 
displeased exiled Cubans in Miami, who threatened to boycott 
Colombian products if the negotiations are finalized. 
  Diplomatic relations between Colombia and Cuba were restored 
in October 1993 after a 12-year suspension. 
  Relations deteriorated in March after Santa Fe de Bogota's 
EL 
TIEMPO published a report on an alleged meeting between 
guerrilla leaders and a Colombian bishop in Havana, a report 
that was later denied by the same newspaper. 
  If the negotiations are completed, the Cuban Government will 
receive the first oil shipment in July, thus allowing it to meet 
one of that Caribbean country's most critical needs.

General Gustavo de Greiff reaffirms his accusations, saying 
there are bishops in Colombia who operate as couriers for 
guerrilla groups. 
  Some of the paragraphs in the prosecutor general's letter to 
Monsignor Pedro Rubiano, president of the Colombian Episcopal 
Conference, state: Some of the bishops have become just that, 
meaning, individuals who deliver messages from guerrilla groups 
to the government and to the public in general. It is dangerous 
to describe the enormous mistake of providing criminals with 
excuses to justify their acts--as has been done by assuring them 
they can still be guerrilla members--as pastoral evangelization; 
this means in Colombia one can continue to murder, steal, 
kidnap, and torment the nation as long as poverty and economic 
and social problems prevail. 
  Finally, the prosecutor general expresses regret over the 
actions carried out by certain bishops, adding that when he 
returns from his vacation he will establish his position with 
regard to the office which will investigate the clergy in 
Colombia.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Enrique Santos Calderon: "The Echo of the </F>
Ballot Boxes"] 
  [Text] A lot of abstention, yes, but what could be 
expected, given the confusion, the lack of seriousness, the 
absence of ideas, and the down-home populism that are proving to 
be one of the most debatable legacies of the Constitution of 
1991? 
  Moreover, it did not strike me as all that dramatic. 
Historically, voter participation in Colombia has always left a 
great deal to be desired. With a few extraordinary exceptions, 
such as the plebiscite of 1957, most elections have had little 
more than a 60-percent turnout. The abstention rate reached 70 
percent in the elections for the Constituent Assembly in 1991. 
After the congressional repeal, the elections to choose a new 
one had a 65-percent abstention rate. 
  This is disturbing, no matter how you look at it. It would 
be 
better to see the voter turnouts of 80 and even 90 percent that 
democracies such as Italy, Spain, and Costa Rica have. Not 
because voting is mandatory--that is a disagreeable 
requirement--but because they have greater political maturity 
and democratic consciousness. 
  Indifference, cynicism, apathy, skepticism, ignorance, 
rejection, or complacency--all these and more explain the 
persistence of abstentionism in Colombia. And it is not 
exclusive to us; in the United States, to choose an example not 
too far away, voter turnout is hardly ever more than 50 percent. 
  It is significant, in any event, that with so much political 
openness, so many new civil rights, the proliferation of 
electoral lists, new groups, special districts for blacks and 
Indians, etc., not only do people not flock to the polls, but 
voter participation actually declines. This is something to 
think about. 
  Furthermore, if blank ballots, the citizen's most explicit 
and conscientious way of expressing his repudiation for 
everything, are not given enough attention, people will feel 
that this form of protest vote is not worth the trouble, either, 
and will be discouraged from participating. 
  A central conclusion to be drawn from these legislative 
elections is that there are no national leaders. Only 16 
senators were elected by quotas, and the impressive battle for 
the leftovers reflects an fragmented political scene in which 
there is not a single figure with national appeal. 
  There are so many things to remark upon in these elections: 
the return of longstanding but very weakened electoral barons, 
such as Guerra Serna and Name Teran; the decline of others, such 
as Gustavo Dajer, Salcedo Baldion, and Humberto Pelaez; 
surprises such as that of Jimmy Chamorro, which confirm the 
political consolidation of the Christian groups; phenomena such 
as Poncho Renteria, whose 20,000-odd votes can be considered a 
protest against the political class. 
  I was saddened by the disappearance of Galanism as a 
parliamentary force and the absence of figures such as Maria 
Cristina Ocampo, Juan Lozano, and Alfonso Valdivieso from 
Congress. No leader has been able to fill that void (Gaviria is 
another matter), and the petty bickering they got involved in 
was the final blow to that liberal faction in Congress. 
  I was also disturbed by the defeat of the M-19 Democratic 
Alliance (AD M-19). It was completely annihilated, losing all 12 
seats. Figures such as Vera Grabe, Anibal Palacios, Bernardo 
Gutierrez, and Eduardo Chaves will not be around anymore. We may 
have disagreed with them, but they were an active presence and 
represented voices of criticism and debate. The debacle of the 
"M" confirms the limits of populism. But the parliamentary 
disappearance of the left (with the exceptions of Cepeda of the 
PC [Conservative Party] and Jorge Santos of the Revolutionary 
Independent Worker Movement, MOIR) may send the wrong signal to 
armed groups about the futility of the parliamentary, legal 
struggle. 
  Some columnists, such as Francisco Santos, have expressed 
the 
opinion that the big winner in these elections was Andres 
Pastrana, while Ernesto Samper lost out. This is a dubious 
argument, apparently based on the fact that the conservatives 
doubled their seats in the Senate--from 16 to 32--and in 
particular on the fact that Samper got 1.5 million votes less 
than Gaviria did in the Liberal Consultation of 1990. 
  It should be noted, however, that at that time of 
indignation 
and grief, people voted overwhelmingly against the dictatorship 
of terror that the drug lords were trying to impose, and in 
favor of the person who had been designated the successor of the 
slain leader. When they feel that something important is at 
stake--the survival of the system, for example--they go more 
decisively to the polls. 
  The results of the legislative elections can be interpreted 
in a number of ways, and everyone talks about the party 
according to how it went for them. But now that the electoral 
scene has been cleared of the confusion of lists and the 
question of the vice presidencies has been resolved, it is time 
for the home stretch in the race between Samper and Pastrana. 
  Samper made a big hit by naming Humberto De la Calle as his 
running mate. He is the ideal vice president, given his training 
and experience, his personal abilities, and his presidential 
stature. The Samper-De la Calle ticket clears the way for the 
Liberals and significantly strengthens Samper's presidential 
chances in an election where every vote will count. 
  Pastrana's ticket, on the other hand, does not have a 
comparable attraction. Not because Luis Fernando Ramirez is not 
up to the job, but because he does not give Andres what De la 
Calle gives Ernesto. The ticket looks very "kindergartenish." 
Lacking a candidate of De la Calle's stature, one whom Pastrana 
sought desperately, or a figure like Noemi Sanin, who prefers to 
save herself for more dignified jobs, the Pastrana-Ramirez 
ticket lacks that element of complementarity, that charismatic 
attractiveness that wins votes, which the Samper-De la Calle 
ticket does have. 
  Now, let the presidential campaign begin in earnest. Let us 
see the debates and the clash of ideas between the presidential 
and vice presidential aspirants. We have two months to find out 
how they plan to govern us; to know what their specific 
proposals are for peace, for the economy, and for the social 
ills that plague Colombians; and above all, to compare them.

<F P=106> [Interview with Federico Storani, Chamber of Deputies </F>
Foreign Relations Committee deputy chairman, by Eugenio Andrea 
Bruno; place and date not given] 
  [Excerpt] He is a national deputy. He has been elected to 
Congress for three terms. He is an expert on international 
economic relations for the opposition. "In my opinion, the 
pressure exerted by U.S. Ambassadors Terence Todman and James 
Cheek and Vice President Al Gore to approve the patents law 
represents a lack of respect," he told LA PRENSA. 
  The former UCR [Radical Civic Union] National Committee 
executive board international relations secretary believes in 
Mercosur [Common Market of the South] because "this market is 
our natural space, and it is the market we must work for." 
  He is very much against the idea of Argentina joining NAFTA: 
  "Argentina's election as a probable NAFTA member was 
presented as an achievement. From the political point of view 
the event might have some significance, but from the economic 
point of view it has no meaning at all. At this time our two 
countries' trade exchange is minimal. Besides, it is largely 
favorable to the United States," Storani said. 
  The Radical Party legislator did not like the U.S. Embassy's 
repeated requests to speed up the approval of a pharmaceutical 
patents law. "I think the pressure exerted by former Ambassador 
Terence Todman, who is returning home, as well as by current 
Ambassador James Cheek and Vice President Al Gore is totally 
negative. They publicly placed the need to approve a patents law 
in accordance with U.S. companies' interests as a basic 
condition. Mr. Carter [not further identified] said the same 
thing to President Carlos Menem in Chile much more brutally. The 
least Menem should have done, considering the insolence of this 
second-class official who was addressing a head of state, is to 
put him in his place." 
  Storani, however, assured us that he has "always supported 
the need to change the law, but protecting our interests and 
without encouraging the monopoly of foreign laboratories, which 
has had fateful consequences in other countries." 
  "In some cases it is a matter of justice to give something 
to 
the inventor. But this gratification should be granted within 
the framework of a broad health policy," Storani said. "We also 
must take into account the interests of local laboratories, 
which are not simply pirates stealing foreign technology." 
  [Bruno] But returning to NAFTA, the government says the 
national economic interest requires... 
  [Storani, interrupting] Our economic interests are 
absolutely 
insignificant. They might be potentially important, but we will 
see that later. 
  For instance, U.S. producers still receive subsidies, and 
this is unfair competition affecting Argentine producers. 
  I have the impression that nothing is clear from an economic 
viewpoint, and I insist our bilateral trade is grossly tilted in 
favor of the United States. Besides, our exports cannot 
diversify, and we cannot sell them more manufactured products. 
  [Bruno] Are NAFTA and Mercosur compatible? 
  [Storani] I visited the United States recently. Every single 
official I talked to said NAFTA and Mercosur are incompatible. 
Therefore, what [Foreign Minister Guido] Di Tella said about 
compatibility is incongruous. 
  [Bruno] Let us suppose they really are incompatible, and we 
have to choose between one or the other. Which one do you think 
the government would chose? 
  [Storani] If this trend of carnal relations continues, I 
think the government will chose NAFTA, even though we do not 
have any economic interest at stake. 
  My position is that our natural space is Mercosur. The fact 
that today we have economic differences with Brazil does not 
mean we must leave that path. 
  I would like to participate in both markets, if possible, 
and 
even work for what George Bush proposed in the Americas 
Initiative. 
  [Bruno] What is your opinion on the issue of a common 
external tariff system between Brazil and Argentina? 
  [Storani] The unification of our different systems is a step 
in the right direction, without a doubt. But I think the 
Argentine Government is overacting on the issue of deadlines. We 
need a gradual process of economic compatibility before our 
tariff systems can be unified. Instead of establishing 
deadlines, the government should have established conditions and 
guidelines. 
  Regarding relations with Brazil, I think first we must look 
at the development of the process of economic reforms, make our 
economies compatible, and eliminate our differences. 
  Then we make evaluate progress in these areas and move 
forward toward unifying our tariff systems. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Jose Genoud, chairman of the Senate Industry </F>
Committee] 
  [Text] The recent visit paid by U.S. Vice President Al Gore 
to Argentina brought to the forefront once again U.S. insistence 
that our Congress pass a new patents law. The second in command 
in the United States simply confirmed the overtures made by the 
former and current U.S. ambassadors to Argentina, Terence Todman 
and James Cheek respectively. 
  There is a broad consensus of opinion in the country on the 
need for a new patents law to replace Act No. 111, enacted in 
1864, which has been in effect without interruption since then. 
This act acknowledges inventors' rights, with the exception of 
pharmaceutical products. The growing globalization of the world 
economy over the last two decades has led the majority of 
countries to align their legislation, albeit differently, with 
the system that acknowledges that the holder of a patent has 
ample production and marketing rights for his or her invention. 
  On the extremes of this controversy, it is argued, on the 
one 
hand, that the right of intellectual property constitutes the 
hub of a free society and that the right to capitalize on the 
profitability of an invention is the best stimulus for doing 
research. On the other hand, it is affirmed that besides all the 
risks that every monopoly entails, patents should not be 
applicable to pharmaceutical products -- as a superior good, 
like public health, is at stake here -- because otherwise their 
prices will inexorably go up. To this one should add arguments 
aimed at protecting the domestic industry in this area. 
  The executive branch sent a bill to the Senate on patents 
and 
royalties [modelos de utilidad], which is under discussion in 
the upper chamber together with the bills that Senators Ricardo 
Lafferriere [Radical Civic Union-Entre Rios Province], Gabriel 
Romero Feris [Corrientes Autonomist Party-Corrientes Province], 
and Federico Storani [Radical Civic Union-Cordoba Province] 
submitted on that subject. 
  It is my considered opinion that the new law ought to 
acknowledge the right of the patent holder, including those 
applied for pharmaceutical products, thus leaving behind a 
legislation enacted 130 years ago. Clear limits should be 
established so as to stave off the possibility of the inventor 
having monopolistic control. In my view, the law ought to 
establish the principle of granting licenses without 
authorization by the patent holder in exchange for acknowledging 
an economic value in favor of the inventor, estimated at a fixed 
percentage of the selling price of the product. (Royalty which 
should be approximately 5 percent of the final consumer price.) 
Obviously, the state must play the undelegated role of being in 
charge of quality control during production and continue 
monitoring it until the product is marketed. 
  Once this law is enacted, there should be a transition 
period 
after which the law will be fully effective and will cover 
pharmaceutical products, like the case in practically all the 
countries that passed similar laws. This will enable the gradual 
accommodation of the national industry to new market conditions 
once the new legislation comes into force. In order to do so, 
one has to bear in mind the degree of development of the 
pharmaceutical industry, which covers 60 percent of the domestic 
demand and exports significant volumes. The new legal text ought 
to stipulate that the law is not to be retroactive. The products 
that are already on the market will therefore be outside the 
scope of this new law. 
  This brief presentation includes the necessary elements to 
draft the new law. The rights of the patent holder are 
acknowledged; the holder will receive a return that is 
proportional to the degree of market penetration of his product; 
the risk of monopolies is eliminated; the medicines supply is 
guaranteed; the possibility of excessive markups is ruled out; 
and Argentine laboratories are given the possibility of adapting 
themselves to future competitive conditions on the market. It is 
inexplicable that there should be those who suggest that this 
law can be enacted in the forthcoming weeks. 
  Argentina signed, together with another 116 countries 
including the United States, the final act of the Uruguay Round 
of GATT in Geneva last 15 December, after seven years of 
negotiations. This act devotes a specific chapter to patents. 
The final regulation of this issue will be made public in 
Morocco in April. 
  The agreement establishes that when signatory countries 
introduce new legislation on patents, they must include an 
acknowledgement of the inventor's rights and may institute 
antimonopolistic mechanisms through mandatory licenses. The 
agreement, moreover, enables governments to establish a 
transition period that may extend up to 10 years and declare 
that the legislation not be retroactive for products that are 
protected by patent. In sum, it leaves a lot of leeway for 
drafting a law like the one that was previously put together. 
  Therefore, it is by no means opportune for Congress to pass 
a 
new law on patents without first having ratified the GATT 
agreement. This, however, does not prevent Senate committees 
from approving their respective reports. The country will surely 
have a new law on industrial patents once both chambers of 
Congress conclude their work and the GATT agreement is ratified. 
All this should be done within the framework of the total 
independence the legislative branch enjoys in decisionmaking in 
any republican system.

<F P=106> [Interview with Florencio Acenolaza, chairman of the Foreign </F>
Relations and Worship Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, by 
Eugenio Andrea Bruno; place and date not given] 
  [Excerpt] [Bruno] What is your opinion of Argentina joining 
NAFTA? 
  [Acenolaza] Argentina's possible entry into NAFTA is 
positive, as it would enhance trade possibilities and improve 
our current negative trade balance position with the United 
States. It has been thought that Argentina's joining NAFTA 
could be in direct contradiction with our participation in 
Mercosur [Common Market of the South], but I do not think this 
is so, as our relations with Brazil, Uruguay, and Paraguay are 
independent. 
  [Bruno] The opposition believes that given the 
characteristics of Argentina's foreign trade -- its main trading 
partners are Europe and Japan -- it would not be suitable for 
Argentina to join NAFTA, as it may imply discrimination against 
these countries. 
  [Acenolaza] I do not think the situation is like that. The 
current trade policy does not have a definite direction. We are 
not thinking about trading exclusively with Europe, as we used 
to do in the past. I believe the point the opposition has 
raised is natural and normal and I accept it as an action by the 
opposition. Let us not forget that if we do not join NAFTA now, 
we will not be able to do so until 1997. 
  [Bruno] Do you believe that joining NAFTA would be 
tantamount 
to sailing under the U.S. flag and participating in the trade 
war it is currently waging against Japan and Europe? 
  [Acenolaza] I believe we ought to start giving top priority 
to our national interests. Our country's main interest lies in 
placing our products on foreign markets and giving jobs to our 
people. It is true that joining NAFTA would imply establishing 
common policies with the United States, but we have to assess 
this from the standpoint of our national interests. We will 
thus see that our joining NAFTA would go hand in hand with an 
economic upswing. 
  The opposition's handling of this issue is simply political. 
It seeks to prevent the government, which is doing things 
right, from joining an economic process that is beneficial for 
us. 
  [Bruno] The other subject that pertains to our relations 
with 
the United States is the one that has to do with patents applied 
for pharmaceutical products and the alleged pressure exerted by 
the U.S. Government. 
  [Acenolaza] That issue is thought to be the number one 
condition for Argentina's joining NAFTA. According to what I 
have managed to find out, however, this is not necessarily so. 
  [Bruno] Is it possible to infer that the pressure the 
government is exerting to have this law passed is, in turn, a 
consequence of the pressure it is receiving from abroad? 
  [Acenolaza] I believe there is a reality which is to try to 
give priority to inventors' rights. The bill under discussion 
is based on the current patents law, namely Act No. 111. 
  The government believes that the rights of the inventor 
should be respected. And so do countries that have nothing to do 
with the United States, like China. With regard to that, I must 
say that there are other countries, like Switzerland and 
Germany, that are also interested in the enactment of this law. 
  I will sum up the government's opinion in one sentence: We 
can no longer pirate research. 
  [Bruno] Is the current trade deficit with the United States 
specifically contemplated in the negotiations? 
  [Acenolaza] Yes, I believe that joining NAFTA will entail 
buying and also selling. We will thus enhance our export 
possibilities to bridge this negative gap. 
  [Bruno] The Brazilian ambassador to Argentina has said that 
if Argentina intends to join NAFTA, Mexico and Canada should 
negotiate within the framework of Mercosur. 
  [Acenolaza] Well, that is a respectable opinion. I believe 
that having signed an agreement with Brazil, Argentina should 
give it preference over others, but this in no way precludes 
Argentina from joining NAFTA. Our country has not singed any 
document in which it is established that Argentina should ask 
Brazil for permission. 
  [Bruno] How are the negotiations on Mercosur progressing? 
  [Acenolaza] Mercosur has two realities. The first is the 
economic stability and balance prevalent in Argentina, and the 
other is the climate of economic and political instability 
reigning in Brazil. 
  When we see that over the last three or four years, trade 
between Argentina and Brazil has doubled, there is no doubt 
whatsoever that both countries have developed economic bonds 
that are very difficult to sever, given the fact that Mercosur 
continues to make headway. I say this without taking into 
account the inflationary process Brazil is going through. 
  Notwithstanding this, we are firmly convinced that Mercosur 
takes precedence over all the other markets. Our insertion into 
Mercosur will be more easily and directly done as it is the 
nearest market and the one that is better developed. At the same 
time Mercosur is in no way incompatible with NAFTA. Argentina 
may join NAFTA and, concurrent with this, continue to be a 
member of Mercosur. As a matter of national interest, Argentina 
should target to both markets. 
  [Bruno] Chile's current foreign minister is in favor of 
regional integration. Is the Argentine Government going to take 
advantage of this to expedite negotiations so that Chile could 
join Mercosur? 
  [Acenolaza] I would first like to tell you that Chile has 
looked on Mercosur with mistrust. Its decision not to join it 
was directly related to this. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Representatives of the Cuban and Argentine 
Governments have signed, in Havana, a bilateral cooperation 
agreement for monitoring and preventing drug addiction and 
trafficking. The document was signed at the Cuban Foreign 
Ministry by Alberto Lestelle, Argentine programming and 
coordination secretary for the prevention of drug abuse and for 
the antinarcotics struggle, and Cuban Minister of Justice Carlos 
Amat. In exclusive statements to journalist Josefa Bussi, the 
justice minister talked about the U.S. State Department document 
that acknowledged Cuba's cooperation in the struggle against 
drug traffic. 
  [Begin Amat recording] Well, we read the statements. We have 
assessed this as something positive because it does recognize 
the effort our country has been making, and is continuing to 
make, despite the existing difficulties in turning into concrete 
action all these things that, actually, have to do with the 
political will to fight drug trafficking, thinking not only of 
our own people but also about all mankind. We think that, 
indeed, this recognition could constitute the possibility of 
continuing to enter deeper [continuar profundizando] relations 
that, in an unofficial way, are being established at certain 
moments with U.S. authorities. And, in the last analysis, it is 
indeed everyone's duty to continue working in that direction. 
[end recording] 
  According to the specialists, Cuba's cooperation in this 
struggle extends to intercepting planes and ships in its air and 
maritime space, as well as in supplying information to the U.S. 
services in charge of confronting that problem.

  [Text] The president-in-exile has not given an official 
answer on the new plan proposed by the United States for an end 
to the crisis. The president-in-exile's spokesman specified that 
the government's position will be known this week. Reacting to 
the initiatives undertaken in Port-au-Prince attempting to apply 
Article 149 of the Constitution, spokesman Jean-Claude Martineau 
stated that the problem of democracy is not a question of 
applying some article of the Constitution, but to neutralize 
those who constitute an obstacle to democracy. Mr. Martineau 
also rejected the calls for resignation by some opponents and 
even some supporters of the president-in-exile. He answered 
Clarence Renois' questions: 
  [Begin recording in Creole] [Martineau] The U.S. plan to 
solve the crisis is still being studied. Before long, I suppose 
that President Aristide will give an answer, his opinion on this 
plan. 
  Concerning the people who are in Haiti -- the political 
parties that want to refer to Article 149 -- there is one thing 
we would like to point out to them and I believe they already 
know: Article 148, 149, 250 or 3000, will not solve the crisis 
in Haiti because the crisis in Haiti does not lie there. The 
president's absence is not voluntary. It is an absence which 
came after a coup d'etat. That is the first thing they should 
know. I believe they know that. The second point to consider is 
that no matter the article they refer to, and no matter how they 
try to replace the president -- the unconstitutional way they 
would like to do it -- it will still not solve the crisis. 
Because the crisis is simply because Haiti, instead of being a 
country, a republic, has become a drug warehouse where people 
are killing people, manhandling people as they please. This 
crisis cannot be solved with articles. Haitians who favor 
democracy must stand up to change things so the country then has 
peace and with peace, it can rebuild itself. 
  [Renois] Mr. Martineau, some supporters and opponents of 
President Aristide asked the president to resign in order to 
allow a solution to the crisis. Does President Aristide take 
into account those considerations? Does he take into account 
those positions. What does he intend to do? 
  [Martineau] No. I suppose those people should know who 
should resign under these conditions. I think the people who 
are killing people should resign. I think if those people can 
ask President Aristide to resign, they should first ask the 
Haitian people if they have changed their vote. Are they giving 
the Haitian people the right to say yes or no, whether they 
changed their 16 December vote? That is what they ought to do 
if they have the courage. I think there is a sort of cowardice 
when President Aristide is asked to resign and at the same time 
one kowtows to the military who are murdering people. I think 
those people know exactly who should resign under these 
circumstances -- people who are killing, who are selling drugs 
and who are manhandling people -- those are the people who 
should resign. In Haiti there should not be a resignation of 
peace, but rather a resignation of the pressure tactics of sorts. 
  [Renois] Mr. Martineau, it appears then that there is a bit 
of Indian wrestling going on between President Aristide's 
legitimacy and the authority of the current government or the 
military who overthrew him. In the end, it harms the Haitian 
people, since sanctions have been imposed. What is now being 
done by the government-in-exile to effect an improvement of the 
situation? Are there some steps being taken at that level? 
  [Martineau] Certainly some steps are being taken at that 
level. Meanwhile, do not forget that a president in any country 
is an advocate of the Constitution. Do we have a Constitution 
or do we not? No matter the compromise that can be reached, 
should those compromises violate the Constitution? In Haiti, 
everyone violates the Constitution, except one group, the group 
that favors democracy. The most stupid thing is that they are 
asking this group to resign. In this case, what is the future of 
elections, of the Constitution in Haiti? Every time a president 
is elected, if the military does not want him, they overthrow 
him and they assert that everything must change. Well! Some 
things must change in Haiti. But, it is not the Constitution, 
it is not the law. It is force, selfishness, and thievery that 
must change in Haiti. 
  [Renois] A final question Mr. Martineau. Does the 
government-in-exile hope the situation will change in favor of 
President Aristide so he can return to power? 
  [Martineau] It is not something that should change in favor 
of President Aristide. It must be in favor of the Haitian 
people. Yes, we hope that things will change and we hope that no 
matter what happens, the Haitian people will win. [end 
recording].

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Drugs: U.S. Assessment"] </F>
  [Text] The U.S. State Department report on international 
drug trafficking is revealing in the sense it escapes the 
intentions of its writers. It exposes the weaknesses, 
incongruities, errors, and interference by the selfsame U.S. 
drug policy and shows, in that respect, Washington has gone from 
militarist attitudes of the Bush administration to something 
very close to inconsistency. Examples of that are: Although the 
U.S. State Department deplores the inefficiency or lack of will 
on the part of the governments of Bolivia, Peru, Panama, and 
Lebanon, among others, in the counterdrug-trafficking struggle, 
it refuses to place them on the list of "punished" nations, such 
as Iran, Syria, Burma, and Nigeria, for reasons of "national 
security;" that is, for reasons totally removed from the drug 
topic. 
  The U.S. document praises the Colombian Government for 
killing Pablo Escobar, top leader of the Medellin Cartel, 
despite the fact this, as well as other actions by Bogota 
authorities, did not significantly reduce the production and 
trafficking of cocaine, nor did it prevent the recent illegal 
production of heroin. In other words, the exhaustive violence 
unleashed in Colombia by the government's war against the 
Antioquia band has caused infinite deaths but has not reduced 
drug trafficking. In another sense, the report criticized 
Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff, a man of renowned moral 
authority in Colombia, for negotiating with certain 
narcotraffickers the reduction of their sentences in exchange 
for their surrender. U.S. officials can hardly condemn this 
practice, however, when it is a daily practice in U.S. courts 
for prosecutors to offer the accused, whether they are 
narcotraffickers, more lenient sentences, acquittals, and even 
money and protection in exchange for information. 
  Continuing with the examples, the U.S. State Department has 
stated the Peruvian Government is plagued by vast corruption, 
which makes it difficult to fight drugs, but does not say a 
single word about the same phenomenon in the United States. It 
omits the fact only the corruption of government employees can 
explain the massive entry of drugs to the nation which consumes 
the most drugs in the world. 
  Panama's case merits separate mention. With the pretext of 
fighting narcotrafficking, Panama was invaded violently by U.S. 
troops, a country whose institutions were destroyed and in which 
puppets to Washington's liking were placed in power. They are 
the same ones now accused by the State Department of doing 
nothing to eradicate the laundering of drug money. This fact 
constitutes either a demonstration a priori of how false the 
Bush administration arguments were or proof the interfering 
imposition of pro-U.S. governments is no guarantee that that 
drug policy will meet U.S. demands. 
  After viewing the confused, partial, and interventionist 
nature of the report issued yesterday in Washington, the 
inclusion of Mexico on the list of nations that "have complied" 
is encouraging only in the sense it can be considered a 
guarantee that U.S. authorities will not use the 
narcotrafficking topic as a pretext to exert undue pressure 
against our country, as they have done other times. The 
assessment of Mexico's counterdrug struggle and achievements, 
viewed as important and commendable, corresponds solely and 
exclusively to Mexicans' sovereignty and no foreign government 
has the legal or moral authority to give "grades" on this or 
other domestic issues. 
  Finally, and strangely enough, it should be noted the U.S. 
Government in its report is capable of setting aside its 
anti-Cuban phobia, giving a report devoid of ideology, although 
no less interfering, on the efforts by the Havana government in 
the counterdrug-trafficking struggle. Concerning the rest, the 
document presented by the U.S. State Department yesterday 
depicts a combination of deplorable attitudes, which hinder 
reaching international agreements that are needed to confront 
the drug plight with a global, multilateral spirit, to attack 
simultaneously consumption, production, and the illegal sale of 
drugs, respectful of sovereignties.

<F P=106> [Report by Roberto Reyes from Hernan Acosta Mejia Air Force </F>
Base in Tegucigalpa -- live] 
  [Text] [Reyes] General Luis Alonso Discua, chief of the 
Honduran Armed Forces, [words indistinct] We are going to try 
to interview the top military chief now that he is preparing to 
receive a report by Air Force authorities. Good morning, 
General, this is HRN [Voz de Honduras Network] [words 
indistinct], and we want to ask you about the latest reports 
[words indistinct] in the country. We are now trying to 
interview Gen. Discua at the Air Force base. 
  General, we would like to ask you about the action by.... 
[pauses] It is impossible. Security is not letting us talk to 
Gen. Discua. Following Discua's car, we see President Carlos 
Roberto Reina's car approaching. We are going to try and wait 
for the president to arrive to learn his views. The general did 
not want to talk. He flatly refused [words indistinct] to 
answer our questions. The president's car is approaching Hernan 
Acosta Mejia Air Force Base. Gustavo Torres seems to be helping 
us improve the sound quality from the base. We are going to 
interview the president, if he is ready to make a statement, if 
he wants to talk to the media. The president's white car is 
reaching the area where he will get out. We will try to carry 
his remarks on HRN, as he is now getting out of his car. 
  Good morning, Mr. President. HRN is voicing the people's 
concern over the reports of a plot against you. 
  [Reina] I think this is a warning for anyone involved in 
public life or governing the state. Deep down, these are 
criminal activities by mobsters; that is my impression. Nobody 
is immune to those dangers. I have the support of the majority 
of the people, to whom I am grateful for their tremendous 
demonstration of support in the wake of this development, which 
we all must express regret over and condemn. These are no 
longer [words indistinct] Mexico has recently become the victim 
of this kind of turmoil, which, of course, forces us to be very 
careful with these criminals. 
  [Reyes] We are going to listen to the president. 
  [Reina] I give it no credence. I am saying this is something 
to be condemned, rejected, but real [words indistinct]. 
  [Reyes] Different sectors of society have supported you 
[words indistinct], but some have said this may be [words 
indistinct]. 
  [Reina] There are always those who have different opinions, 
which I respect. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Why [words indistinct], Mr. 
President? 
  [Reina] These are criminal acts. Any public official.... 
[pauses] And reporters should be careful too. 
  [Reporter] Politics have nothing to do with this, Mr. 
President? 
  [Reina] No, no. These are criminal acts. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct]. 
  [Reina] Out of courtesy, and because we are friends [passage 
indistinct]. Some calls of support and solidarity [words 
indistinct] for the president of all Hondurans. 
  [Reyes] Have you ruled out politics? 
  [Reina] Yes, I have. 
  [Reyes] These were remarks by President Reina from Hernan 
Acosta Mejia.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 6 Apr (NA) -- Economy Minister Domingo 
Cavallo said today that the approval of the Patents Law is "a 
credential in the negotiations with the U.S. Government to get 
it to modify the extremely closed tariff stance it has with 
Argentina." 
  Cavallo complained that while Argentina is "extremely open 
to 
the United States, it is extremely closed to us in tariff and 
rates matters." 
  He stressed it is "fundamental" that the Patents Law be used 
as a lever in the negotiation of a bilateral trade relation with 
the United States, and "no ground must be given regarding future 
sanctions." 
  "It is very important for them that it can be considered as 
a 
credential in the negotiations," the minister reiterated during 
the luncheon he had with an organization of business people. 
  The economy minister warned that if negotiations with the 
U.S. Government are successful, the norm for acknowledging the 
intellectual rights of U.S. laboratories "will have to be made 
within the framework of GATT." 
  This is precisely the measure that is being demanded by the 
national enterprises grouped within the Industrial Center of 
Argentine Pharmaceutical Laboratories (CILFA), something the 
foreign companies, represented in this case by the U.S. Embassy 
with James Cheek at its head, wish to prevent. 
  The minister hopes that the approval of the Patents Law, 
which is sleeping in Congress, will be the "key" to unfreeze 
trade relations. 
  Cavallo then referred to Brazil and stated that trade 
relations with the neighboring country are "as important as 
those with as those with the United States." 
  Moreover, he confessed that the Argentine Government 
"slipped 
up when it negotiated a free trade" [zone], referring to the 
Mercosur [Common Market of the South] Treaty, and he said: 
"There was no need to achieve a customs union." 
  Notwithstanding, he expressed his happiness in that "the 
Brazilians are quite realistic and have come to the conclusion 
that free trade is not yet feasible." 
  As a detail to support his position, the minister maintained 
that many Europeans are "more skeptical about their monetary and 
economic union."

  [Excerpts] La Paz, 5 Apr (EFE) -- Susana Seleme, who was 
the private secretary of former President Jaime Paz Zamora, 
today said she was a "victim of the good faith errors" by the 
former president. Seleme said this while being questioned by a 
congressional commission investigating the former government's 
alleged links with drug trafficking. [passage omitted] 
  Seleme is among the group of militants of Paz Zamora's 
party, 
the Movement of the Revolutionary Left (MIR), charged with being 
involved with traffickers following a police investigation 
prompted by statements by trafficker Carmelo Dominguez, aka Meco. 
  The Bolivian Police investigation is centered on Paz 
Zamora's 
friendship with alleged drug trafficker Isaac Chavarria, aka Oso. 
  Seleme is charged with having protected alleged trafficker 
Edgar Fernandez Lezcano -- who regarded as Chavarrias' aide -- 
and of having accepted money from Chavarrias to finance the MIR. 
  Paz Zamora's former secretary today denied having had a 
personal relationship with any of these individuals. 
  She admitted, however, having spoken over the phone to Meco 
Dominguez once and with Chavarrias on several occasions when 
they unsuccessfully tried to contact, through her, Paz Zamora 
when he was president. 
  Seleme admitted that Paz Zamora and his family had a 
long-standing friendship with Chavarrias. She added that she 
thought Paz Zamora believed that the person who is now regarded 
as a trafficker was involved in strictly legal deals. 
  Seleme took advantage of the occasion to say that she 
believes the struggle against trafficking in Bolivia is a 
violation of human rights. 
  She recalled an attempt to abduct her a few weeks ago, 
apparently by police who mistakenly abducted her niece whom they 
interrogated for several hours. 
  She spoke of the charges, also being investigated by 
Congress, by several inmates charged with trafficking who said 
they had been brutally tortured in "clandestine strongholds" by 
alleged Bolivian and foreign police agents. 
  Seleme said the charges linking the MIR with trafficking are 
part of a "sinister plan" organized by "the first world power 
and its representation in Bolivia," referring to the United 
States and its embassy in La Paz. 
  "I deeply admire Bill Clinton (U.S. President) and (his 
wife) 
Hilary Clinton, but I do not think human rights should be 
violated to fight trafficking," said Seleme. 
  She added: "I am not a delinquent. I am willing to shoot 
myself to prove I am innocent." She also voiced her conviction 
that her party colleagues are also innocent.

  [Text] Brasilia, 4 Apr (EFE) -- Official sources told EFE 
here that acting Brazilian Foreign Minister Roberto Abdenur 
today asked the United States to increase its contribution so as 
to achieve the pacification of Angola. 
  The request was made by Abdenur during a meeting with 
Madeleine Albright, the U.S. permanent representative before the 
United Nations, in Brasilia. Albright exhorted Brazilian 
President Itamar Franco to support the U.S. position to exert 
pressure on the DPRK. 
  The United States is seeking diplomatic support to intensify 
its pressure on the DPRK in order to oblige the latter to abide 
by a recent UN Security Council resolution and allow the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to inspect its nuclear 
facilities. 
  Abdenur took advantage of the U.S. diplomat's visit to 
Brazil 
to ask the United States for greater involvement in the United 
Nations so as to establish peace in Angola. There are strong 
cultural, economic, and historical bonds between Brazil and the 
African nation. 
  Abdenur and Albright decided that they will keep consulting 
with each other to continue assessing the tense situation 
confronting the Korean peninsula due to the DPRK's refusal to 
agree to the inspection of its nuclear facilities. 
  Albright today met President Franco, with Abdenur, and Army 
Minister General Zenildo de Lucena. She is to leave Brasilia 
tomorrow to travel to Argentina. 
  Abdenur and Albright expressed optimism about the electoral 
process in Mozambique, which will culminate with next 
September's elections. 
  Nevertheless, the acting foreign minister voiced concern 
about the hasty reduction of UN peacekeeping forces stationed in 
Mozambique. 
  Both diplomats also discussed future regulations to enhance 
the effectiveness of the economic sanctions the United Nations 
imposes on some countries and to alleviate the harm caused to 
innocent nations or people.

  [Text] Geneva -- Everything is ready for a big party. But 
now, after six years of negotiations, a black cloud is hanging 
over the closure ceremony that will be held in Marrakech on 12 
April for the most ambitious round of negotiations for the 
deregulation of world trade: the Uruguay Round of GATT talks. 
The United States does not want countries where workers are 
exploited to obtain easy access and trade advantages for their 
products in international trade. The United States demands that 
the World Trade Organization that will be officially created 
during the Marrakech meeting study the subject. 
  But Brazil and all the poor countries that already are 
feeling like possible victims of trade retaliations refuse to 
discuss the problem. Brazilian Ambassador to GATT Felipe 
Lampreia protested the idea at the Uruguay Round Negotiating 
Committee. 
  "Labor issues must not be discussed by a trade organization 
but by the International Labor Organization," said Graca Lima, 
one of the Brazilian negotiators. 
  According to Lima, the U.S. proposal is premature and may 
open the door to a new form of trade barrier against products 
from developing countries.

  [Excerpt] Outlining the course he will set for 
Chilean-Bolivian relations, Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa 
said: "We must explore a whole world of possibilities in our 
relations with Bolivia." Our relations with Bolivia have time 
and again been marred by sporadic reactions by Bolivian military 
officials, who have demanded, through unusual appeals, an outlet 
to the sea for their country. 
  This is what happened on 22 March when the Bolivian Army 
commander, General Reynaldo Caceres, called for a change in the 
"thoughtless, obstinate attitude of the Chilean ruling class" 
regarding the Bolivian landlocked situation, a position out of 
keeping with history." 
  Figueroa was asked on 23 March about the approach he will 
take regarding relations with Bolivia in light of the various 
aspects posed by this issue. On the one hand, there have been 
friendly gestures such as the cordial talks held by Figueroa 
with Bolivian Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar, as well as the 
visit paid to Chile to attend the presidential inauguration by 
Mrs. Ximena Iturralde de Sanchez de Lozada, the wife of the 
Bolivian president, who conveyed a message to the Chilean 
people. On the other hand, these gestures have been overshadowed 
by remarks such as that by Gen. Caceres. 
  First, Figueroa said he will not comment on "remarks by 
third 
parties," alluding to Caceres. Second, he outlined his position 
regarding "the course" he will take in our relations with 
Bolivia. 
  Figueroa said: "It is Chile's desire to have the best 
possible relations with Bolivia, in order to seek ways for 
understanding in the areas of politics, economics, culture, and 
tourism and for investment and infrastructure development in 
border areas. There is a whole world of possibilities that must 
be explored to develop these relations." 
  Figueroa outlined his position in a meeting he held with 
Aranibar in Brasilia on 22 March. The two foreign ministers 
took advantage of a meeting of Rio Group foreign ministers to 
hold bilateral talks in Brasilia. At the end of the meeting, 
Figueroa talked about searching for "creative formulas" to 
develop Chilean-Bolivian ties. On 23 March he emphasized the 
need for these formulas. 
  "These formulas could be applied within the whole spectrum 
of 
cooperation and to the work that two countries like Chile and 
Bolivia -- which truly seek to maintain good relations -- could 
undertake." [passage omitted]

  [Text] President Juan Carlos Wasmosy issued a "message to 
the people," which was not read out, to journalists at the 
international airport yesterday. In the message, Wasmosy says 
his government has studied and approved nearly 100 industrial 
projects, and created an Industrial Development Fund for 
granting immediate financial assistance to those projects. The 
message states: "Before the year end we will have a considerable 
number of new job opportunities for our young people, 
professionals, and technicians who anxiously expect to overcome 
the unemployment that afflicts thousands of our fellow 
countrymen." The eight-page message is signed by the president. 
Wasmosy did not talk to the media. 
  In another paragraph Wasmosy says: "The allegation that the 
executive branch wants to maintain a harmful influence on the 
judicial branch is absolutely false. Very soon we will have a 
new judicial branch, reorganized according to constitutional 
mandates. No one is more interested than the executive branch in 
a sovereign, independent, and trustworthy justice system. We 
want a judicial branch capable of assuring not only to our own 
citizens, but also foreigners who might want to work and invest 
in our country." 
  The message says: "The fight against corruption has enabled 
the government to increase its fiscal collections week after 
week. These collections are at record levels compared to the 
same periods in previous years. The government will be able to 
fulfill its obligations in time." 
  Wasmosy's message adds that the political difficulties faced 
by the government to administer situations and conflicts of 
various kinds has sometimes made relations between government 
and Congress more or less critical. He comments: "Events will 
show that our commitment with opposition leaders who consider 
democratic governability an essential factor for the 
consolidation of this historic process will not be destroyed 
with the ease forecasted by those who miss the autocratic 
system." 
  In the message, Wasmosy recognizes "the valuable cooperation 
of various opposition leaders who intellectually contributed to 
our diplomatic efforts, because in my government the national 
interest is more important than any egoist sectarian interests, 
which are a permanent source of mediocrity." 
  Wasmosy says he faced the numerous labor conflicts "with 
calm," stressing that negotiation is the appropriate instrument 
"to transform confrontation into agreement." Wasmosy adds that 
he has "the necessary calmness and equanimity" to listen to 
representatives of groups who have not had the opportunity to 
make themselves heard before. He adds: "We are not impressed by 
force, but we are very sensitive to the force of reason used by 
the different groups in their arguments." Wasmosy concludes by 
committing himself to seek "the well-being of all in freedom, 
democracy, and peace."

  [Text] President Alberto Fujimori asked Congress on 24 
March to expedite the debate and approval of the regulations on 
the new electoral system established by the Constitution, as 
well as the legislation that will regulate the 1995 general 
elections. 
  "They will be regulations the government will support 
because 
they will come from an autonomous branch," said Fujimori, who 
also noted the openness of the official bloc in gathering 
suggestions presented by other political groups and unions. 
  He pointed out that debates and disagreements are always 
good 
because they lead to conclusions. This is why he believes the 
debate on the electoral system is not tangled up in discussions. 
  Fujimori refrained from commenting on the request by some 
congressmen and politicians that he leave the presidency six 
months before next year's general elections if he decides to run 
for reelection. 
  "Excuse me, I am abstaining from commenting on the electoral 
issue for the time being," said Fujimori in answer to a reporter. 
  Regarding other issues, Fujimori announced that as of April 
all public servants will get a salary increase and that the 
increase will be higher for those working in health and 
education. 
  He did not give a percentage because "it is still being 
evaluated by the Economy and Finance Ministry." 
  The president made the announcement after admitting that 
government salaries are very low. 
  He said: "There should not be any doubt that there is a 
desire to increase the salaries not only of teachers but of all 
public servants." 
  After dedicating seven new educational centers in northern 
Lima, Fujimori confirmed his confidence in Peruvian Ambassador 
to Ecuador Eduardo Ponce. 
  Fujimori said: "Peruvian relations with Ecuador are at the 
best possible level, although there are some situations that can 
be misinterpreted but which do not take away the merit of the 
high level of trust between the two countries." 
  He added that relations are fluid because there is direct 
communication between the two countries' foreign ministries. 
  He indicated that the friendship between the two peoples is 
above any circumstantial situation. 
  He noted that the ambassadors are representatives of the 
Peruvian Government and that "as long as they act in support of 
those relations, I am sure there is no need for the government 
to question their performance." 
  Fujimori then confirmed his confidence in Ambassador Eduardo 
Ponce and disregarded reports that he would be called back to 
our country. 
  He said: "I am sure Ecuadoran officials will have a spirit 
of understanding in this situation." 
  Fujimori also expressed his disagreement with the idea that 
part of the resources received from the privatization of public 
companies be used to pay the foreign debt. 
  He said: "We don't want the resources from privatization to 
be used for paying the foreign debt because we have much 
infrastructure to be improved and medium- and long-term projects 
to carry out." He said it is essential that those resources be 
used in social projects. 
  Fujimori reiterated that it is expected that about $3 
billion 
will be received this year from the sale of public companies and 
it will be essential for social investments.

  [Text] Montevideo, 6 Apr (EFE)--Cuban Foreign Minister 
Roberto Robaina, who is making an official visit to Uruguay 
within the framework of a Latin American trip, said Cuba is 
willing to continue its economic opening in order to integrate 
with the current world, but it will not modify its "sacred" 
political system. 
  Political freedom in Cuba is conditioned by external 
pressure, Robaina told the media when he referred to the trade 
blockade the United States imposed more than 30 years ago; 
"therefore, today there is no need for political unity." 
  Regarding the economic opening, the foreign minister 
indicated there are already 100 important international 
enterprises with investments in Cuba, but he stated that he 
could not reveal their names because their enterprises in other 
countries might suffer U.S. pressure. 
  Regarding President Bill Clinton's government, he said: "It 
has less aggressive language (regarding the Cuban regime) but 
the blockade has increased." 
  Regarding President Fidel Castro's stay in power (for 35 
years now), the foreign minister stressed that the president "is 
not in power because he wants to hold it nor does he want to 
perpetuate himself in power: The most important thing is not his 
physical presence, but the continuity of the plan" that he 
embodies. 
  Asked about succession, Robaina explained that Raul Castro, 
the Armed Forces minister and Fidel's brother, has been 
designated, but he added that "under new circumstances, new 
names emerge," although he made it clear that he himself "is not 
in line" for that task. 
  Robaina also commented on the accusations against his 
government regarding human rights violations, which he considers 
"to be a highly manipulated, discriminatory, selective, and 
politicized topic," and he denied that such cases occur in his 
country. 
  "My country disagrees with the entry (into Cuba) of those 
who 
wish to impose conditions" regarding human rights, Robaina said, 
when he was asked why his government has never allowed an in 
situ inspection by UN or Latin American Inter-Parliamentary 
Union members. 
  Montevideo media reports today that Uruguayan Foreign 
Minister Sergio Abreu suggested to Robaina "the desire (of the 
Uruguayan Government) that human rights be respected in that 
country and that a multiparty democracy be established." 
  During the meetings with President Luis Alberto Lacalle and 
Abreu, the Uruguayan Government reiterated these petitions for a 
political opening, according to sources. 
  Robaina arrived on 4 April in Montevideo and today he 
concludes his official visit to Uruguay, where he will remain 
for two more days on a private visit. He then will travel to 
Peru, Argentina, and Paraguay to explain the Cuban economic 
opening to the respective governments and request support 
against the blockade.

  [Excerpt] Antonio Suarez, president of the National

Department's harsh, controversial report. 
  [Begin recording] [Suarez] We have been criticized for not

and employees assassinated in Colombia. We would not have such 
a long history of bloodshed if we weren't doing something. The 
U.S. State Department's remarks are interfering and an attempt 
to meddle in Colombia's administration of justice. That is why 
we, just this once, support the prosecutor general's policy.

objective and measured. [end recording] [passage omitted]

  [Text] We will now read a news agency report that confirms 
what this newscast previously reported. It states that Isaac 
Oso Chavarria's assistant, Edgar Fernandez Lazcano, has been 
clandestinely and illegally removed from the country by DEA 
agents. The news agency report states: 
  The U.S. antinarcotics agency has excused itself before the 
Costa Rican Government for not having warned of the transit 
through Costa Rica of a Bolivian citizen who testified that 
former Bolivian President Jaime Paz Zamora is linked to a drug 
trafficker. 
  Costa Rican Security Minister Luis Fishman reported that the 
DEA cited urgency in its letter as the reason for not having 
informed the Costa Rican Government of the arrival of Edgar 
Fernandez Lazcano in Costa Rica. 
  Fernandez Lazcano, who was on his way to Miami on 3 April, 
again reported in Costa Rica that last week -- during a long 
testimony before Bolivian Prosecutor Leopoldo Ramos Herrada -- 
he revealed the alleged links between former Bolivian President 
Jaime Paz Zamora and drug trafficker Isaac Oso Chavarria. 
  Fernandez Lazcano, who was clandestinely removed from 
Bolivia 
by land via Peru, was detained by chance by OIJ [Investigation 
Agency] agents in downtown San Jose during a drug enforcement 
operation. Following consultations, the Bolivian prosecutor and 
Drug Enforcement Officer Ruben Zegada Portugal asked for 
permission to question him in conjunction with Costa Rican 
officials.

  [Text] The government refuses to clarify the mysterious 
manner in which Edgar Fernandez Lazcano, assistant to Isaac Oso 
Chavarria, traveled to Costa Rica to be questioned by the DEA. 
  Justice Minister Rene Blattman says he has no information 
about this case, which is being investigated by the Ministry of 
Government. He also does not know whether or not Edgar 
Fernandez Lazcano was forbidden to leave the country. The 
minister said, however, this is not very important, as anyone in 
Bolivia can disobey the prohibition on leaving the country and 
get out of Bolivia. The migration under secretary certainly did 
not like Blattman's statement. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified migration under secretary] 
Did the justice minister say that? Well, he must send me a list 
of the names of people who left the country during my 
administration in defiance of an order to remain. 
  [Unidentified corresponedent] Was Fernandez Lazcano 
prohibited from leaving the country? 
  [Under secretary] Fernandez Lazcano? No, he received no 
order prohibiting him from leaving the country. Until the 
moment he left -- because it is not known when he left the 
country -- there was no order prohibiting him from leaving the 
country. [end recording] 
  If Fernandez Lazcano was not forbidden from leaving the 
country, he could have left the country legally, with a 
passport. The migration office says he did not use it: 
  [Begin under secretary recording] I can tell you that his 
departure was not registered in any airport controlled by the 
Migration Undersecretariat. The only thing I can tell you is 
that if he left the country he may have left using one of the 
many methods used by people linked to drug trafficking, through 
clandestine air strips or by land. [end recording] 
  Meanwhile, the president of the Republic has met with 
several 
ministers to discuss this subject, and it has been reported that 
in the next few hours a communique will be released to the 
public explaining how Edgar Fernandez Lazcano left Bolivia. 
  In turn, the DEA was criticized in political circles for 
kidnapping Edgar Fernandez Lazcano to question him in Costa 
Rica. Bolivian congressmen agree that the DEA owes an 
explanation to Bolivia. 
  [Begin Deputy Fernando Kieffer Guzman recording] Yes, of 
course, I think they acted excessively and arbitrarily, which 
must be countered as soon as possible; otherwise, this will 
unnecessarily affect U.S.-Bolivian relations, as there was no 
real reason for this action. The two objectives sought by the 
DEA in this case could have been met: that Fernandez Lazcano be 
a witness in court, and also in the lawsuits that are being 
followed in the United States. Right? Yet this was a 
precipitate, clumsy action. It was an abuse. [end recording] 
  MNR [Nationalist Revolutionary Movement] Deputy Fernando 
Campero said that in the case of Edgar Fernandez Lazcano, 
Bolivian sovereignty is being trampled upon. 
  [Begin Campero recording] The amendment approved some time 
ago by the U.S. Congress, which authorizes the kidnapping of 
individuals linked to drug trafficking even without the 
knowledge or coordination with the officials of the foreign 
country, represents an offense to the dignity of our countries. 
I think that in this joint struggle carried out by the United 
States and all the countries against this scourge of drug 
trafficking, we should seek mechanisms of coordination and 
mutual respect. [end recording] 
  So far, neither the Ministry of Foreign Affairs nor the 
Ministry of Government have made statements on this sensitive 
subject.

  [Text] On 22 March, Acting Foreign Minister Jose Miguel 
Insulza reiterated that Chile is open to discuss either of the 
two possibilities for trade integration with the United States. 
The possibilities are the signature of a free trade bilateral 
treaty or the incorporation of Chile into NAFTA, of which the 
United States, Mexico, and Canada are members. 
  According to Insulza, Finance Minister Eduardo Aninat 
informed U.S. Trade Representative Michael Kantor of these 
alternatives during his visit to Chile to attend Frei's 
presidential inauguration. Insulza said the two countries' trade 
representatives will define an agenda to begin talks soon. For 
this, it must first be decided whether Chile will use the 
bilateral agreement or NAFTA. 
  He added that the United States has not decided which 
countries will join the "fast track" [preceding two words in 
English] to begin the negotiations. This mechanism consists of 
an authorization granted by the U.S. Congress to the executive 
branch to negotiate quickly and then present a general agreement 
to the legislative branch for its approval. 
  The acting foreign minister said the two alternatives have 
advantages and disadvantages. He said a bilateral agreement is 
quicker because it does not include all the items of NAFTA, 
which foresees more complex trade relations between the United 
States, Mexico, and Canada. As for NAFTA, Insulza said the 
advantage is that Chile could join a broader trade association 
and the items to be negotiated are already known and defined. 
  Another aspect of bilateral relations between Chile and the 
United States is connected with the case of cyanide-poisoned 
grapes, which caused an embargo of Chilean fruit in March 1989. 
Regarding this subject, Insulza said the diplomatic 
negotiations are compatible with the lawsuit filed by Chilean 
fruit exporters. He added that some of the negotiation's 
elements could change according to the status of the lawsuit. 
  Regarding the approval of the ambassadors named by Chile, 
Insulza said that so far Argentina, Peru, and Mexico have given 
the "agreement" [preceding word in English] for Eduardo 
Rodriguez, Carlos Martinez Sotomayor, and Carlos Portales, 
respectively. He said this is due not only to the good relations 
maintained with these countries, but also to the expeditious 
processing of the documents, which sometimes is complex. He 
cited as an example the fact that in Europe the approval of 
ambassadors is made by a council of state and in some Latin 
American countries it is made by the Foreign Ministry, which 
grants the "agreement" directly and without delay.

  [Text] Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina said the 
great efforts of the Cuban people are aimed at increasing 
production and exports. In a news conference held in Montevideo, 
Uruguay, where he is carrying out an official visit, Robaina 
stressed that the Cuban Government decided to associate itself 
with foreign capital as an alternative for development in 
determined spheres such as tourism, oil, and nickel. Robaina 
added that Cuba's economic problems will not be solved with 
foreign investments alone. 
  In explaining the human rights issue, Robaina said that in 
Cuba there are no disappearances or tortured people. In 
contrast, Robaina highlighted that for some time now, every 
Cuban generation has participated in the government. 
  Robaina also held meetings with members of the Latin 
American 
Integration Association and with members of solidarity 
organizations with Cuba. In the latter, Robaina stated that 
Havana hopes to establish normal relations with Cuban emigres 
residing in 15 countries, and that the upcoming forum The Nation 
and the Emigre Community will help achieve just that. 
  Cuban Foreign Minister Robaina is carrying out a tour 
through 
Uruguay, Peru, Argentina and Paraguay aimed at expanding and 
strengthening the bilateral relations between Cuba and those 
South American states.

  [Text] Montevideo, 7 Apr (EFE) -- During an interview with 
EFE in the Uruguayan capital, Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto 
Robaina said the America's Summit, called by U.S. President Bill 
Clinton for December in Miami, seeks "to isolate Cuba from Latin 
America." Robaina said: "If it is an `America's Summit,' Cuba 
has earned a place there because, regardless of any different 
economic models, the summit will lack political plurality if we 
are excluded." 
  Robaina also discussed the upcoming Ibero-American Summit, 
scheduled for June in Cartagena de Indias (Colombia). He said 
Cuba hopes that "we, the American countries, will be able to 
meet without receiving orders from the United States." Robaina 
added: "Cuba hopes the Cartagena Summit will issue resolutions 
and not merely express intentions as in the past three summits." 
  The upcoming Ibero-American Summit is one of the goals of 
the 
Cuban Foreign Minister's three-day official visit to Uruguay and 
will be a goal of the visits he will subsequently make to Peru, 
Argentina, and Paraguay within a "political-economical 
offensive" as he described it himself. 
  The Cuban Government hopes to receive more concrete support 
from the Ibero-American Summit against the U.S. trade "blockade" 
on Cuba. The foreign minister added: "It is not necessary to ask 
for (Latin American) political support against the blockade 
because we already have it. Now this support must be translated 
into investments." 
  Nevertheless, the quest for these investments during 
Robaina's current tour is of "a preparatory nature," without 
hopes for concrete results. "Until we honor our debts to these 
countries there will be an atmosphere that does not contribute 
to striking more significant relations," Robaina said. 
  Cuba owes about $1.2 billion to Argentina and $33 million to 
Uruguay. The foreign minister said the Cuban Government intends 
to reduce these debts by delivering goods (specially medicines) 
and, above all, by getting the creditors to invest in Cuba. 
  Concerning his subsequent stops, Robaina noted he already 
has 
a confirmed meeting with Argentine President Carlos Menem, a 
Latin American leader who has been very critical of the 
government system in Cuba. A meeting with Peruvian President 
Alberto Fujimori has still not been confirmed. A meeting with 
Paraguayan President Juan Carlos Wasmosy is much more complex 
because there are no diplomatic relations between Paraguay and 
Cuba and, therefore, Robaina's visit to this country is 
unofficial. 
  Robaina emphasized: "During this tour, my task involves 
explaining to the respective presidents the current Cuban 
situation, which is extremely complex. At this moment, our top 
priority involves finding an economic model that will allow us 
to integrate ourselves into today's world without giving up our 
political system's sacred achievements." 
  In Montevideo, the Cuban foreign minister met President Luis 
Alberto Lacalle and Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu. Although his 
official visit ended on 6 April, Robaina will stay in 
Montevideo, on a private visit, until 8 April. 
  The Uruguayan politicians did not make any remarks on the 
meetings, even though both of them openly expressed their 
government's position, favoring a democratic opening of the 
Cuban system that will allow its integration into Latin America 
by reconciling its government system with those prevailing in 
the rest of the continent.

  [Text] On 5 April at the United Nations, Cuba reaffirmed 
that there is no better way to promote, maintain, and 
consolidate peace than by encouraging development and giving 
such development stability worldwide. Abelardo Moreno, Cuban 
representative on the special committee on UN peacekeeping 
operations, warned that if that fundamental element was not 
taken into account, with or without a Cold War, with or without 
an East-West confrontation, conflicts would continue to 
proliferate and become increasingly dangerous. 
  Moreno predicted: Then, the United Nations will continue to 
be drawn into an upward-spiraling tendency to resort to weapons 
and militarism that will erode its credibility and ruin the 
philosophy that gave rise to the United Nations itself. He 
reflected: Those who believed the end of the Cold War was the 
universal cure-all for solving problems accumulated over 
centuries forgot that erecting solid foundations for development 
and promoting economic and social progress for all constitute 
the very raison d'etre for the collective security system 
provided for in the UN Charter.

  [Text] For the third time in the last three years, the U.S. 
Government has acknowledged Cuba's serious efforts and 
efficiency in the antidrug-trafficking struggle in or near the 
island's territorial waters and airspace. This means that the 
truth about Cuba is prevailing. 
  In an article published on 7 April, GRANMA journalists Leon 
Nicanor Cotayo mentions the specific dates of the U.S. State 
Department reports on this issue: 7 March 1991, 12 April 1993, 
and 4 April 1994. It is interesting how in the last report, the 
U.S. Government notes that Cuba's efforts against drug 
trafficking have not been more extensive because of the effects 
of the more than 30-year-old U.S. blockade. In this regard, the 
document states that the shortage of fuel and essential spare 
parts somewhat limits the Cuban Government's capabilities to 
intercept drug traffickers. 
  Leon Cotayo adds that Miami's far right and other 
conservative sectors in the United States frequently unleash 
smear campaigns, tying Cuba to drug trafficking. This is the 
third communique issued by the U.S. State Department, which once 
again putting objectivity before any propagandistic defamation, 
seems to add an element of significant value to anyone pondering 
the seriousness of Cuba's arguments when it comes to explaining 
its actions, or when it comes to repudiating those who around 
the clock, try to distort Cuba's reality.

Martin Rodin, president of Mitsubishi Motors in Cuba, was 
interviewed by Mariela Diaz. 
  [Begin recording] [Rodin] We have been working in Cuba for 
almost 14 years. Mitsubishi's decision came after eight months 
of work. This decision encompasses more than importing and 
selling vehicles. Once the decision to enter the Cuban market 
was made, the Japanese sent a work group to Cuba to examine all 
technical aspects involving the vehicles. 
  [Diaz] What types of vehicles will you be marketing? 
  [Rodin] The automobile will be the Lancer. They will be 
used, 
for now, as rental cars for tourism. There is also a great 
demand for diesel engine box vans, minibuses for 12 and 26 
passengers. Following today's or tomorrow's signing of the 
contract with Transimport (as heard), we will begin to import a 
full line of trucks, both medium and heavy load. [end recording]

  [Text] Cuban Workers Federation Secretary General Pedro 
Ross Leal has announced that there will be people's marches on 
the occasion of 1 May only in the municipalities of Pinar del 
Rio, Artemisa, and Matanzas and in one of the two capitals of 
Havana Province [sentence as heard]. Here is journalist 
Diosdado Maso with further details on the 1 May celebrations: 
  [Begin Maso recording] Ross explained that the reason the 
marches of the militant Cuban people are not being held in both 
the capital and municipalities is the economic situation the 
country is going through. How can we hold ceremonies when there 
are workplaces and sugar mills that need the labor force and the 
resources we might use in holding such ceremonies? Ross gave the 
construction of the two grandstands at the national ceremony 
held every year in Revolution Square as an example. He said just 
one of these grandstands uses up more than seven cubic meters of 
wood, without counting the nails, the fuel, the fabric -- in 
short, great expense. 
  Concerning the political justification for not holding the 
march of the militant Cuban people here in the capital, Ross 
said that holding the special session of the National Assembly, 
where the suggestions made by the workers during the Parliaments 
in the Workplace were discussed, is the best acknowledgement of 
the Cuban trade-union movement by its government and its people.

  [Text] The Giron-94 exercise of the Unified Vigilance and 
Protection System [SUVP], which began on 5 April in Havana City, 
is an important tool in confronting crime and antisocial 
behavior. Jorge Lezcano, first secretary of the Communist Party 
of Cuba in Havana City, underscored the preventive nature of 
these tasks which are aimed at fighting social indiscipline and 
crime. In the 15 municipalities, the provincial commission of 
the SUVP will inspect marketplaces, supermarkets, hospitals, 
childcare centers, food warehouses, cold storage centers, and 
factories to learn how theft and embezzlement are being fought 
in those centers. 
  Giron-94 will be held in Havana throughout the week and 
includes energetic actions against clandestine restaurants, 
whorehouses [candongas], and those who rent cars to foreigners 
around tourist facilities, among other illegal activities.

  [Text] Ricardo Alarcon, president of the National Assembly 
of the People's Government [ANPP], has stressed the great 
efforts by the people of Granma in confronting the current 
situation, and their profound patriotic and revolutionary faith. 
Alarcon and other ANPP leaders participated in a three-day visit 
to the province, along with seven of its work commissions, to 
inspect preparations for the forthcoming report the province 
will render to the ANPP. 
  [Begin Alarcon recording] [Words indistinct] I must stress 
that beyond a doubt, if we seek that part of Cuba where the 
roots, heart, and struggle of the fatherland have been alive for 
over 120 years, we must immediately think of the Cuban region we 
today call Granma Province. 
  Here one finds many people aware of the progress report 
process, aware of what is being done in this regard. It is a 
stimulus, something that helps boost the tasks conducted by the 
provincial organizations, things they were doing anyhow. This 
process, however, helps to give a certain impetus to the entire 
collective effort. [end recording] 
  The ANPP presidency stressed the fact that in Granma, over 
500 low-cost houses have been built of a semester plan for 
1,000, and the fact that the province has confirmed it will 
fulfill its current sugar production plan.

<F P=106> ["Straight Talk" program with host Osvaldo Rodriguez and </F>
guest Luis Sexto of BOHEMIA magazine -- live or recorded] 
  [Text] [Rodriguez] There are limits to rounding up foreign 
currency inside Cuba: the population's sensibilities. We, Luis 
Sexto of the magazine BOHEMIA and Osvaldo Rodriguez of the 
newspaper JUVENTUD REBELDE, are going to talk about this today. 
Well, Luis, I think this is a subject that is out in the 
streets. I think that many of us -- in family gatherings and 
among friends -- have discussed this subject, what is for sale 
in certain stores within the network of stores that sell for 
hard currency, and about the way certain Cuban businessmen, who 
are seeking hard currency for the Cuban people, handle this 
matter. 
  I think we should talk about this. We could delve more 
deeply 
into certain topics, and also into the intentions, but I think 
intentions have always been noble. As I said upon opening the 
program, I think a limit must be set, and that limit is to try 
to avoid offending the population's sensibilities. I wouldn't 
even say "try": the population's sensibilities simply must not 
be offended. 
  [Sexto] I think, Osvaldo, that the limit has already been 
set, unless the news I have is false. You are referring to the 
fact that recently, in certain places, especially in the 
capital, certain medicines were being sold; in others, certain 
light foods, candies, sweets; even school uniforms came to be 
sold in certain hard currency stores. Of course this represented 
a huge contradiction, which was subsequently quickly caught and 
repudiated by the population. 
  [Rodriguez] But you are speaking to me in the past tense. It 
makes it sound as if all that is over. 
  [Sexto] Well, I understand that such a thing was not a 
government decision. I mean, you have to keep in mind that in 
this country, contrary to what some people both inside and 
outside the country think, power is shared. In Cuba, power is 
shared. But because of the cliches that have been established by 
propaganda, people always think that anything that happens in 
this country is a decision made at the highest level of 
government or by the [Communist] Party [of Cuba]. People do not 
take into account the fact that in this country, precisely, 
power is so widely shared, so broadly distributed, that there is 
enough margin for a businessman or an administrator at some 
store to take certain initiatives that are often not the most 
felicitous. 
  I have sometimes wished, precisely, that that power were 
concentrated -- which does not mean centralization: wished to 
have a concentrated power capable of making decisions, decisions 
which would be obeyed, complied with, by everyone at once. 
  Now, I understand that when the government learned about 
these things, the situation returned to normal and such sales 
were prohibited, disallowed. 
  [Rodriguez] Well, yes, I think so. I believe you have 
mentioned a number of cases that were prohibited. And, well, I 
am thinking particulary about the sweet snacks for children, and 
certain essential medicines that were being sold for hard 
currency, but did not, at that particular moment, exist in the 
hospitals or the pharmacies of the people's network. However, I 
think there are other things that do a lot of damage to that 
image as well, and that contrary to what we meant to do -- give 
businessmen some autonomy -- we are realizing that certain 
businessmen, when given autonomy, do not know what to do with 
it, and begin taking initiatives that are irritating. 
  In principle, we defend autonomy, and could discuss this in 
another program. We would have to draw the conclusion that ... 
[rephrases] in my opinion, the efficiency of our economy entails 
autonomy on the part of the enterprises in the economic sphere, 
to be precise. 
  [Sexto] I agree. 
  [Rodriguez] That's on the one hand. Now, I think that when 
our businessmen and administrators are given autonomy and don't 
know what to do with it, it is because they are still suffering 
the influence of a bureaucratic mentality to the maximum. 
  It seems to me that the other day -- last week, if my memory 
serves me right -- Renato Recio touched on the subject of 
bureaucracy and the bureaucratic mentality on this very program. 
He reached the conclusion that bureacracy means losing sight of 
the end goal. 
  As I was saying just a few moments ago, recalling Comrade 
Renato Recio: When a process has lost sight of its end goal, it 
has become bureaucratized. That means that its entire point has 
been lost, that the thing is being done for no reason at all. It 
is at that point that the purpose for which that action was 
created, founded, begun is forgotten, and the action gets so far 
off course that everything becomes distorted, and the man 
carrying out that action no longer knows when he is taking 
proper action and when he is taking improper action -- despite 
the fact that he may have the best of intentions. We could also 
talk about up to what point those intentions already... 
[rephrases] are good intentions. Well, intentions are 
intentions. It is said that the road to Hell is paved with good 
intentions. 
  [Sexto] Indeed, with good intentions. Now, I want to tell 
you 
that, regardless of how flexible the economy and economic and 
political management in this country may become, and regardless 
of how much autonomy we may be able to give our institutions and 
enterprises, we must never allow ourselves to cease acting as 
political beings. 
  The society, this particular society, this regime, the 
socialist regime -- at least the kind of socialism we in this 
country want to build -- can never be separated from the 
political vision of those who lead it. I mean: I cannot round up 
hard currency at any cost. I have... [rephrases] the country 
needs to round up hard currency. Indeed, the country has 
needed... [rephrases] very clearly, it has taken initiatives 
that, although... [rephrases] These initiatives may have 
bothered us in the beginning because we saw or anticipated that 
certain inequalities could arise. We could also see, however, 
that they were necessary, that the nation was (?sunken) in an 
extremely critical situation and needed to make bold decisions 
that could alleviate our situation. 
  I think time has shown that the decision taken has been the 
right one. Decriminalizing hard currency has helped, somewhat, 
to alleviate certain tensions in the country. 
  Now of course we must not lose sight of the fact that no 
management decision, administrative decision, can be allowed to 
aggravate the possible irritation over the fact that some people 
have access to hard currency while others do not. I mean that 
must not be allowed to be an ostensibly hurtful act. Of course, 
we cannot sell a medicine [for hard currency] because medicine 
is a political product. We cannot sell a medicine in one place 
for Cubans who possess hard currency and not sell it in a 
pharmacy where it can be bought in Cuban pesos. 
  [Rodriguez] We must remind listeners that among the pillars, 
one of the major foundations of this Revolution is public 
health. Even under today's critical conditions, while it does 
have deficiencies, public health is still free to the 
population, and no one has yet died... [rephrases] there is not 
a single person who can say: A hospital has failed to provide 
care for me. 
  [Sexto] Indeed. Look, because of its social import, its 
human 
import, medicine is an eminently political product -- in 
addition to everything else that it is, which I am not going to 
get into defining here. 
  [Rodriguez] Of course. 
  [Sexto] And whoever sells medicine has to keep in mind, 
above 
all, its political implications. It would be... [rephrases] I 
think it is unjust from the very foundation for us to allow the 
absence of a medicine on the national currency market, but allow 
it on the hard currency market. 
  [Rodriguez] Especially those medicines... [rephrases] for 
example, asthma medicines. I remember that that was one of the 
cases most talked about -- the fact that there was a spray 
[preceding word in English] for asthma on certain markets. And 
asthmatic people, at a period when... [rephrases] Everyone knows 
that this time of year, winter, with its constant cold fronts, 
is a time when asthma sufferers experience many attacks. Asthma 
sufferers did not have that medicine available to them -- and I 
think that was a very serious mistake on the part of whoever 
made that decision. I think that, as you say, it was probably 
some administrator, maybe some director of one of the many 
enterprises supplying this network of stores, because no single 
enterprise does it. Several enterprises service this network of 
stores. 
  [Sexto] Osvaldo, in order to avoid becoming bureaucratic, 
to avoid repeating hollow, harmful schemes, the first thing an 
official has to do is not lose sight of the social purpose of 
all his actions -- at least in our society. 
  [Rodriguez] Of course. 
  [Sexto] I mean: Why do I want to round up hard currency? 
What 
goal am I pursuing (?in rounding up) hard currency? The end 
established in this country, of course, is a noble one, a noble 
end. 
  [Rodriguez] We -- Luis Sexto, of BOHEMIA, and Osvaldo 
Rodriguez of JUVENTUD REBELDE -- are discussing the matter of 
rounding up hard currency inside Cuba. We have already 
established the limit: not to offend the population's 
sensibilities. 
  [Sexto] Indeed, that is the basic boundary. How far should 
the manager's, administrator's, action go? To what extent can 
management, or commercial flexibility and initiative be 
positive? At what point does it begin to be negative? At what 
point does it become impolitic? At what point does it begin to 
cause irritation on the part of our citizens because of the 
shortages they are already being affected by? 
  [Rodriguez] Of course this -- all these attitudes -- is also 
to a certain extent related to the so-called depoliticizing of 
the economy. I think that yes, one can to a certain extent speak 
of economics alone, without relation to politics. When those 
economics are put into practice, however... [rephrases] I mean: 
You can talk about ideas, and about economic laws that operate 
independently of will or of the social system. However, when you 
go looking for that economy's end goal, that is when politics 
merges with economics, and that is where these businessmen have 
to act, taking into account not only economic ideas -- the ideas 
of businessmen -- but also political ideas. 
  [Sexto] I think what you are saying is obvious: In a society 
based on social justice -- that is, equitable distribution of 
wealth and a standard of security for all -- indidputably, for 
the majority of the population, economics can never be divorced 
from politics. I think that is one of the many taboos that have 
arisen recently in certain places in the world; and, in fact, we 
already know where such a divorce -- that artificial divorce 
between economics and politics -- is leading. Socialist 
societies are profoundly humane societies, and in my opinion, 
politics is nothing more than the art of getting human beings to 
live together in harmony. Therefore, we cannot forget the 
political implications of all our economic actions. That is what 
I am talking about, Osvaldo. However, I think that we also have 
to talk about other things here, in the few moments left to us. 
  I think there are many Cubans who indeed may have hard 
currency available to them today, for one reason or another. But 
I also think that those Cubans who today have access to -- or 
rather, the right to use -- that hard currency must try to be 
very careful not to offend the sensibilities of their fellow 
citizens, because that problem too is occurring. We are not 
going to criticize, here on our program, only officials who, by 
making certain decisions, have made a mistake. I think that this 
society must also seek harmony on the basis of us, ourselves, on 
the basis of each and every one of its members. I know, for 
example, of schools where compared to the snack of a child whose 
family receives hard currency, the snack of a child whose family 
doesn't, is awful. I mean: Although we have had to accept these 
relationships because of the situation, because of the 
circumstances, let us at least not make them worse by using... 
[rephrases] vanities that are, in the last analysis, puerile 
vanities, vanities that try to create artificial differences. In 
the last analysis, this country was founded for us all, and we 
must all contribute our share so we can manage to live together 
in social harmony. 
  I believe -- and continue to repeat -- that at the present 
time, morality is far more important than under any other 
circumstances. In times of crisis, morality is fundamental. And 
that is what I am talking about right now, Osvaldo. I am saying 
that we must try not to be ostentatious. 
  [Rodriguez] To avoid offending the sensibilities of the 
population -- that is the boundary to keep in mind in rounding 
up hard currency inside Cuba. 
  I think that we have spoken out quite clearly on this 
matter, 
Luis Sexto of the magazine BOHEMIA and I, Osvaldo Rodriguez of 
JUVENTUD REBELDE. 
  Luis, all that is left for us to say to our listeners is 
that 
we should continue talking about this subject. I don't think we 
have exhausted this topic here. We could discuss it further in 
later programs.

that 143 caballerias have been planted in the province to date, 
137 percent of the figure planned for the first 90 days of 1994. 
There are 67 caballerias of cane left to plant in this month's 
plan, and the province expects to plant them with no problem. 
The province expects to have 1,296 caballerias planted in 
sugarcane by the end of June. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1700 GMT on 6 April reports that over 500 
caballerias of sugarcane have been planted in Matanzas Province

farmers in Las Tunas Province, surpassing their first-quarter 
goal by 30 percent, an improvement over last year. 
  Rebelde also adds that the potato harvest in Havana Province 
is 60 percent complete, thanks to good organization and higher 
productivity of the work force. 
  Radio Rebelde on at 1700 GMT on 7 April reports that in 
Sanctis Spiritus Province, the Uruguay Agroindustrial Complex 
will add 150 sugarcane cutters to their Basic Cooperative

fields of the Urbano Noris Agroindustrial Complex in that same 
province.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
fileworthy reports on criminal activity and related judicial 
actions carried on Havana radio and television in Spanish 
between 22 March and 6 April. 
  Radio Rebelde at 0000 GMT on 22 March reports that Case No. 
441 of the Havana City Provincial Court involving 17 people 
arrested in connection with the illegal sale of special gas 
vouchers in Havana has concluded and all 17 defendants are 
awaiting sentencing. The defendants stole special gas vouchers 
from Las Tunas Province and sold them in Havana City. Juan 
Saucedo, an employee of the provincial office of the Cuban 
Petroleum Institute in Las Tunas Province, stole vouchers for 
over 68,000 liters of gasoline. Several doctors, an engineer, 
and an accountant were arrested along with Saucedo for their 
involvement in the matter of the stolen vouchers. 
  Radio Progreso at 1200 GMT on 23 March reports that 
according 
to statistics, cattle rustling has reached 32 percent of overall 
crimes committed in the country in 1993. An example of this is 
that more than 5,000 incidents of cattle rustling were recorded 
last year in the Province of Havana, the province with the most 
cattle. 
  Radio Progreso at 1100 GMT on 6 April reports that 55,000 
pesos were stolen from a construction enterprise in Havana City. 
Two administrators, Ernesto Sanhernandez and Fernando Flores 
Alfonso Tamayo, were accused of tampering with the payroll. They 
used names of students on false payrolls and later forged their 
signatures to collect their checks. The two suspects are in jail 
waiting for their trial. They could get 8-20 years imprisonment 
for their crime.

  [Excerpt] Huacho, 25 Mar -- Six corrupt Peruvian National 
Police [PNP] noncommissioned officers who illegally released 
Clara Chumbe Rondono, aka Aunt Clara -- the most sought drug 
trafficker in the northern region of Lima Department -- were 
imprisoned last night in the Carquin jail located in Carquin. It 
was reported that the corrupt PNP members received $10,000 for 
allowing Rondono to go free. Rondono was arrested with 2 kg of 
highly pure cocaine paste. 
  It has been learned that two other PNP officers were 
reportedly involved in this case, but their names will not be 
disclosed until the investigation that is being conducted is 
completed and their involvement in this regrettable incident has 
been clearly established. According to court investigations 
under way, those arrested are members of the Huaral police 
delegation, and participated in an antidrug operation conducted 
in Huaral on 12 December 1993. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Of the 10 Bell-212 helicopters donated by the U.S. 
State Department to the National Police for interdiction 
operations against drug trafficking in the Peruvian jungle, five 
are broken down in Pucallpa. National Police sources provided 
this information. They indicated that antinarcotics operations 
in the Upper Huallaga as well as in the mountain ranges of the 
central jungle have been temporarily suspended because of a lack 
of these helicopters. 
  Experts in the struggle against drug trafficking said the 
helicopters are a great help in transporting police personnel, 
as land transportation is very difficult in the jungle due to 
ambushes by narcoterrorists. A spokesman for the National Police 
said that despite this inconvenience, operations are carried 
out, but not as many.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a roundup of press 
agency reporting on President Cheddi Jagan's visit to Colombia. 
  On 4 April, Colombian President Cesar Gaviria met with his 
Guyanese counterpart Cheddi Jagan with whom he reviewed 
bilateral relations. Jagan is on a three-day official visit 
aimed at strengthening economic, commercial, and political ties 
between the two countries. The Colombian president said trade, 
tourism, and ecology are some areas of interest. (Madrid EFE in 
Spanish 0156 GMT 5 April 94) 
  Today, Colombian and Guyanese Presidents Cesar Gaviria and 
Cheddi Jagan pledged to support an initiative to create an 
Association of Caribbean States as a broad mechanism through 
which countries in that area can agree on commercial integration 
policies. The commitment was announced in a joint declaration 
signed by the two presidents at the end of Jagan's official 
visit to Colombia. The presidents said the initiative proposed 
by the Caribbean Common Market (Caricom) will facilitate the 
creation of a free trade zone. In that regard, Gaviria recalled 
that one of the main objectives of the Group of Three (Colombia, 
Mexico, and Venezuela) is increasing cooperation with Central 
American and Caribbean countries. Gaviria and Jagan agreed to 
strengthen bilateral relations and encourage integration in 
commerce, health, agriculture, education, electricity, and 
tourism. (Hamburg DPA in Spanish 1800 GMT 5 April 94) 
  Guyanese President Cheddi Jagan, who concluded his official 
visit to Colombia on 5 April, said at a news conference that his 
country "is alarmed by the growing threat of drug trafficking, 
particularly cocaine shipments sent to Guyana from Colombia 
through Venezuela." He added that in confronting this problem, 
his government will sign cooperation agreements against drug 
trafficking with the United States, Great Britain, and Colombia. 
Commenting on Colombian President Cesar Gaviria's election as 
OAS secretary general, he expresssed his confidence that his 
efforts as head of the regional organization will be of great 
value. He said his visit to Colombia will strengthen bilateral 
trade relations and invited Colombian businessmen to invest in 
his country. (Paris AFP in Spanish 2200 GMT 5 April 94)

  [Text] Opposition candidates have reacted with diverse 
opinions to the emergence of Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon as 
substitute standard bearer for the PRI [Institutional 
Revolutionary Party] to the presidency. Presidential hopefuls 
Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, of the National Action Party (PAN); 
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano, of the Democratic Revolutionary 
Party (PRD); Jorge Gonzalez Torres of the Mexican Green 
Ecologist Party (PVEM); Marcela Lombardo Otero of the Popular 
Socialist Party (PPS); Pablo Emilio Madero of the Mexican 
Democratic Party (PDM); Rafael Aguilar Talamantes, of the 
Cardenist Front for National Reconftruction Party (PFCRN); 
Cecilia Soto Gonzalez of the Labor Party, and Alvaro Perez 
Trevino of the Authentic Party of the Mexican Revolution (PARM) 
said the following: 
  Diego Fernandez de Cevallos: Ernesto Zedillo "is a 
respectable and honest person who will certainly play a good 
role as presidential hopeful for his party. I now have an 
adversary again and will strive for the presidency." 
  Cuauhtemoc Cardenas: "Perhaps now more than ever, he is the 
presidential candidate of continuity." Hopefully, despite how 
he was chosen, "it will be a clean and straighforward election." 
  Jorge Gonzalez Torres: "Zedillo represents the continuity of 
a sinking ship and of something that failed." The new candidate 
"bases his political campaign in the image of Colosio, because 
he lacks his own personality." 
  Marcela Lombardo: "The choice of Zedillo falls within the 
same democratic trend presented by Colosio, because it follows 
the same objectives and the same proposals of Colosio." 
  Pablo Emilio Madero: "I hope that Zedillo's participation in 
the elections will be pure and clear, conforming to reality. It 
is hoped he will assume the responsibility inherited from 
Colosio of talking to all sectors." 
  Rafael Aguilar Talamantes: "Zedillo's participation will 
raise the stature of the electoral race and will certainly 
guarantee that it will be civilized, tolerant, and respectful of 
all the candidates." 
  Cecilia Soto: "All the contendors deserve respect. Zedillo 
will be an important contender. It is hoped he will embrace 
Colosio's positions." 
  Alvaro Perez Trevino: "The proposals made to the people and 
the political line of Ernesto Zedillo will differ substantially 
from the proposals made by Luis Donaldo Colosio."

  [Excerpts] Mexico City, 6 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- Catholic Church 
authorities have reported that the Mexican Catholic hierarchy 
accepted a request from Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for 
peace in Chiapas, to promote peace in that southeastern state. 
  Today, Ramon Godinez Flores, secretary general of the 
Mexican 
Bishops Conference, said the Catholic hierarchy will prepare a 
campaign with "positive" messages directed at the people of 
Chiapas to overcome "obstacles" in the pacification process. 
  Camacho Solis announced in a news conference that he had 
asked the Mexican bishops for their cooperation to break the 
"vicious circle" that might "undermine" the pacification 
mechanism. After meeting privately with the members of the 
pro-Chiapas commission of the Bishops Conference, Camacho Solis 
said, without going into detail, that the "obstacles" and 
"vicious circle" in the reconciliation and pacification process 
in Chiapas must be overcome. [passage omitted] 
  Godinez said Camacho Solis asked the bishops to send 
messages 
of peace and harmony to the people of Chiapas with the objective 
of fomenting reconciliation and making the EZLN [Zapatist 
National Liberation Army] more receptive [sensibilizacion] to 
the Catholic hierarchy. 
  Godinez added that during the seven and one-half hour long 
meeting, Camacho Solis refused to mention dates for the 
resumption of the dialogue with the EZLN. Godinez also said the 
bishops see the positive side of the continuation of the virtual 
cease-fire. 
  The meeting with Camacho Solis was also attended by Vatican 
Ambassador Geronimo Prigione and SBmuel Ruiz, mediator in the 
peace dialogue and bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas, a 
Chiapas city located 1,200 km east of the Mexican capital. The 
meeting was presided by Adolfo Suarez Rivera, president of the 
bishops conference, who reiterated the Catholic clergy's 
willingness to support the peace process in Chiapas.

<F P=106> [Report by Elizabeth Diaz Otero from Los Pinos presidential </F>
residence in Mexico City; from the "ACIR Radio News" newscast] 
  [Excerpt] [Announcer] This afternoon, around 1400, Mexico 
and Costa Rica signed a bilateral free trade agreement at Los 
Pinos Presidential Palace. President Salinas de Gortari and 
Costa Rican President Rafael Angel Calderon Fournier, who 
arrived in Mexico City around noon, signed the document. This 
document, which has 23 chapters, will enter into effect on 1 
January 1995. Here is Elizabeth Diaz Otero with a report: 
  [Diaz] Good afternoon. During the ceremony to sign the 
document, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari said the free 
trade agreement between Costa Rica and Mexico will promote 
greater trade and investment, employment, and welfare 
opportunities for both nations. This document, which opens the 
door for the free trade of goods between the two nations, will 
result in greater economic growth and development, and 
consequently more justice with accompanying tangible benefits 
for society. 
  In the presence of Costa Rican President Calderon, who came 
specifically for this ceremony, President Salinas underscored 
that the way to advance Latin American integration is with 
actions, not just words. The meeting took place in the Adolfo 
Lopez Mateos Hall at Los Pinos. President Salinas spoke about 
the diversification of relations between Mexico and other 
countries and the advantages of competition. 
  [Begin Salinas recording] National businesses, especially 
medium-sized and small businesses, will find broader markets 
with differences regarding levels of complexity and development. 
This agreement will benefit economies of scale and facilitate 
the specialization of various goods. With this treaty we sign 
today, we will also promote the development of the comparative 
advantages of all Mexican federal organizations. This agreement 
will lead to strengthening decentralization and federalism 
because domestic producers will be increasingly less dependent 
on the behavior of a single market. [end recording] 
  [Diaz] President Calderon euphorically called this free 
trade 
agreement with Mexico the greatest foreign policy accomplishment 
of his administration because it gives Costa Rican products 
access to the Mexican market, a huge market with 90 million 
people. He gave a long speech in which he said that 5 April 
marked the onset of the 21st century for Costa Rica and praised 
President Salinas, comparing him with Bolivar, Marti, Juarez, 
and San Martin. He emphasized that the free trade agreement 
should not be viewed as a deal that will only favor businessmen. 
  [Begin Calderon recording] The free trade agreement between 
Mexico and Costa Rica should not only be viewed as a matter of 
interest for businessmen and shopowners. The elimination of 
tariffs represents the elimination of economic, mental, and 
cultural barriers. This agreement will have significant 
repercussions for the future of all citizens, and it heralds a 
new period in relations between Mexico and Costa Rica and 
between Costa Rica and the other North American nations. [end 
recording] 
  [Diaz] This free trade agreement between Mexico and Costa 
Rica is considered the most thorough agreement negotiated in 
Latin America. This is so because it contains an entire array 
of rules that will give transparency and security to the 
productive sectors; promote trade in goods and services; protect 
industrial secrets, brands, and copyrights; and facilitate 
investments in both countries. This treaty, as you have said, 
if ratified by the Mexican and Costa Rican senates, will enter 
into force on 1 January 1995. A large number of the tariffs 
will be eliminated -- in the case of Mexican exports, 70 
percent, while in the case of Costa Rican exports, 75 percent. 
This reduction of duties will continue gradually over a decade. 
It will mainly protect agricultural products like meat, 
plantains, poultry products, and sugar. 
  [Announcer] The signing of this treaty is beneficial for 
Costa Rica, as well as for Mexico, of course. I will cite an 
example to give an idea of the figures we are talking about. 
Costa Rica currently exports -- according to 1993 statistics -- 
an average of $60 million to Mexico, mainly raw materials. With 
the signing of this bilateral free trade agreement, Costa Rica 
will be able to increase it sale of goods and services to Mexico 
400 percent. That is, the current value of the market, which is 
$60 million, could grow to $250 million, which is very 
beneficial for Costa Rica and the Mexican commercial opening.

  [Text] In Brussels on 6 April, President Juan Carlos 
Wasmosy again blamed the press for all the troubles in the 
country. He said the media is controlled by powerful 
organizations established during the previous administration. 
  The president said such organizations frequently do not have 
any mercy on the administration's need for space, adding that 
his government was seated only a short time ago and had to 
administer the many conflicts that currently are surfacing. 
  "My government guarantees the most absolute freedom of the 
press, which is controlled by powerful communications 
organizations that were established during the previous 
administration and that frequently do not have any mercy on the 
administration's need for space in the short time it has had to 
administer the many conflicts that are surfacing today," the 
president said. 
  Wasmosy read his speech during a working luncheon with 
European Parliament President Egon Klepsh and various European 
deputies. 
  The head of state said the method for administering 
conflicts 
in a true democracy was quite different from the methods used in 
the past autocracy. 
  Regarding the social crisis, Wasmosy told the European 
deputies that his government was committed to facing the social 
problems caused by poverty, disease, ignorance, and lack of 
communications in wide areas of the country with courage and 
determination. 
  Wasmosy said his government used the invaluable democratic 
instrument of dialogue, compromise, and agreement with 
opposition forces, adding that the opposition controlled both 
houses of Congress. 
  The head of state stressed that this attitude permitted them 
to close a pact with the opposition that will guarantee the 
democratic governability of the country. Wasmosy said the pact 
with the opposition will allow them to fulfill, in freedom, the 
people's long delayed and legitimate aspirations. 
  The president admitted that the country's economy was 
fragile 
and weak because 76 percent of the 4 million inhabitants earned 
their incomes from agriculture, adding that agriculture depended 
on the success or failure of cotton and soybean crops, which 
usually are affected by international markets' cyclical 
variations.

<F P=106> [Report by unidentified special correspondent] </F>
  [Excerpt] Brussels -- Industry and Commerce Minister Ubaldo 
Scavone told NOTICIAS yesterday that the Italian Government has 
finally admitted that legal mistakes were made in a $10-million 
loan to install a citrus company in La Colmena. The minister 
announced that the Paraguayan Government has thus been virtually 
exempted from paying the loan, which, including overdue payments 
and arrears interest, reportedly stands at more than $45 million. 
  During Stroessner's regime, the Italian Government approved 
a 
loan for Rossi Inc. which was allegedly guaranteed by its 
Paraguayan counterpart through fraudulent actions committed by 
former roving ambassador Gustavo Gramont Berres. Following the 
downfall of the dictatorship it was confirmed that the loan was 
not guaranteed by the Paraguayan State or by Congress. 
  Scavone said: "In late March, the Italian Government 
admitted 
that the debt had not been legally granted to Paraguay." 
  This situation virtually paves the way for the Paraguayan 
Government's plan to reschedule its foreign debt payments with 
the Paris Club. A Paraguayan delegation will go to the French 
capital tomorrow to negotiate this alternative. The French 
Treasury is coordinating the Paris Club's interests. The Paris 
Club comprises the seven industrial powers, including Italy. 
  Paraguayan Central Bank official Luis Breuer is in Paris to 
begin the preliminary negotiations. The negotiations will 
reportedly be concluded in the presence of Wasmosy. 
  Our debt with the Paris Club totals about $600 million. Our 
government's basic idea is to renegotiate $300 million so as to 
allocate more funds for poor segments by implementing specific 
projects. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Jorge Benitez] </F>
  [Text] Asuncion, 7 Apr (EFE) -- Paraguayan peasant 
organizations have been sustaining a confrontation with the 
government for the past two months. They warned that the country 
is risking a class struggle due to the official lack of 
sensitivity to solving rural problems. 
  Peasant and executive branch relations had entered a stage 
of 
relative calm following President Juan Carlos Wasmosy's decision 
last month to create the Social Development Council, seeking an 
open dialogue will all social and economic groups. 
  Everything indicated that council negotiations were going to 
end with a final agreement. The signing of the agreement was 
even announced for 5 April. But that day the Senate approved a 
government decision blocking the pardoning of a portion of 
producers' debts to the Agriculture Development Fund (CAH), 
which angered peasants. 
  Peasant leaders withdrew from the negotiating table 
temporarily. However, they later said they considered the 
position of the executive and legislative branches a joke, 
adding that in these circumstances they were not willing to 
agree to anything. 
  "The Senate decision is an insult to peasants, an attack 
against them that will deteriorate their situation even more," 
said Alfonso Cohene of the National Peasants Federation. Cohene 
added that they cannot pay all their debts because they are 
being paid too little for their products. 
  The secretary of the National Peasant Organization (ONAC) 
based in Coronel Oviedo, in the country's center, believes the 
executive and legislative branches' attitude is offensive to 
farmers, adding that it endangers the future of more than 
250,000 families dedicated to cotton cultivation. 
  "It is a dangerous provocation, and the result is obvious 
because the country is made up of a majority of poor people who 
are getting increasingly poor and a minority of rich people who 
are getting increasingly rich," ONAC Secretary Adolfo Ortiz told 
EFE. 
  Peasants distrust everyone. They no longer believe in 
official promises. They can make mistakes if they are pushed 
against the wall, Ortiz admitted, citing as an example what 
happened at the beginning of the week in Colony Yby Pe, San 
Pedro Department, some 300 km north of Asuncion. 
  On that occasion a group of landless peasants blocked a road 
and held four Agrarian Reform Institute (IBR) technicians 
hostage for 24 hours in order to force a meeting with IBR 
officials. 
  "If we follow this path we are not too far from violence and 
class struggle," Ortiz said. The peasant leader announced that 
national peasant organizations' representatives will meet on 8 
April to discuss a strategy to face the derogatory campaign 
launched by the government against rural demands. 
  "We have enough reasons to walk away from the negotiating 
table and resort to new mobilizations. We cannot negotiate for 
six or seven months. We have concrete problems, and they need 
urgent solutions," Ortiz stressed. 
  Thousands of peasants marched on Asuncion on 15 March. It 
was 
the largest rural demonstration the country can remember. 
Peasants protested Wasmosy's economic policies, demanding more 
land, better prices for their products, and more efficient 
sanitary and educational assistance. 
  In the past two months, peasants have blocked several 
highways in the country's northeast, east, center, and south in 
support of their demands. They also are holding the largest 
portion of their cotton production in their farms. 
  According to official figures, cotton bins have received 
only 
30 percent of the total volume anticipated for the year, despite 
a 15 percent price increase over what was initially estimated.

  [Text] Tegucigalpa -- Yesterday, Jorge Arturo Reina, 
brother of President Carlos Roberto Reina, rejected claims that 
the alleged plot to assassin the president is part of a 
"smokescreen" to cover up the country's real problems and 
assured that no Liberal would attack the government. 
  Yesterday, Jorge Arturo Reina, first vice president of the 
legislative branch, arrived at legislative branch headquarters 
and said that "we cannot rule out the fact that democracy is 
always exposed to dangers and that there are always minds 
capable of hatching anything to destabilize democratic order." 
  "I, however, think that the problem should neither be 
overblown nor minimized," he added, after denying that this is a 
"smokescreen." He said "that this is absolutely false because 
it was not planned by Honduran intelligence or the government. 
It was kindly passed on by a neighboring government (Nicaragua) 
to the Honduran Government." 
  As for Private Secretary Lucio Izaguirre's hint that there 
are Liberals seeking to destabilize the government, Reina said 
he had not heard about it. But he clarified that "no one is 
conspiring in Honduras, there is no national goal to do so and 
much less within our political party," 
  "The Liberal Party is more united than ever. It is normal 
for someone to voice his views within the Liberal Party, and 
this will continue to happen because we censor no one." 
  As for the economic crisis and announced increases in 
electricity rates, the president's brother said that there is a 
need for ample and clear explanation on the real situation in 
the country to ensure that Hondurans are informed and support 
the thankless and bitter decisions that the government has to 
make.

  [Text] On 4 April, Peace Commission leader Hector Rosada 
Granados reported that both the uprooting of people by the local 
armed confrontation and the historic clarification of the past 
-- known as the Truth Commission's work -- will be treated 
separately by the government and guerrilla delegates in May in 
what will be a follow-up of the peace talks. Rosada Granados 
said these subjects will be discussed in this order and that the 
second one will be debated in an ad hoc meeting. He said 
special mechanisms will be used to complete the discussion after 
it was decided to carry out the study and analysis. The official 
said the signing of the framework agreement early in the year 
was the end of the beginning and that the General Agreement on 
Human Rights now marks the beginning of the end. 
  Rosada said he regards the fulfillment of the agreement very 
probable because he detected in the URNG [Guatemalan National 
Revolutionary Unity] commanders a determination to make good 
their words and reach a political understanding so they can be 
reincorporated into the country's legal life. He said the URNG 
leaders have also pledged their word abroad, and the negotiators 
and the international community are waiting for the two sides to 
abide by the agreement. Finally, he said the only thing that 
remains is to march forward with common sense and tolerance so 
this process, which now exists only on paper, can become reality.

<F P=106> [Interview with President Guillermo Endara by Jenny Lee </F>
Martinez and Manuel Fernandez from the Bridge of the Americas in 
Panama City on 7 April -- live relay] 
  [Text] [Martinez] President Endara dedicated the widening 
of the Panama-Arraijanj Highway today. Before the dedication, 
President Endara commented on U.S. accusations that Panama is 
not doing enough to fight drug trafficking. The U.S. Government 
accused the Panamanian justice system of releasing drug 
traffickers. Here is President Endara's response: 
  [Endara] [Words indistinct] how many drug traffickers it 
does 
not free? It frees hundreds, even thousands, of drug 
traffickers. The Panamanian judicial branch -- the United 
States Government had better get this from now on -- is not 
controlled by the executive branch, as it is not in the United 
States. The U.S. justice system frees many more drug traffickers 
[words indistinct] the Panamanian justice system. 
  [Fernandez] Do you suggest [words indistinct]? 
  [Endara] The U.S. justice system? 
  [Fernandez] [Words indistinct]. 
  [Endara] Why don't they talk about corruption in the United 
States? They free more drug traffickers than Panama. Why do 
they accuse us Panamanians? Why is our justice system charged 
with corruption if it frees two drug traffickers? Why don't 
they talk about corruption over there? 
  [Unidentified reporter] [Words indistinct] 
  [Endara] I am not justifying the acquittal of any drug 
trafficker. What I am saying is, no matter what the United 
States does, the executive branch will not intervene in matters 
concerning the judicial branch. The executive branch will not 
intervene in the judicial branch. If the judicial branch frees 
someone, we will free that person because the decision concerns 
the judicial branch per the same policy President Clinton 
follows vis-a-vis the U.S. judicial branch whenever it decides 
to free a drug trafficker. If President Clinton respects and 
heeds the U.S. justice system, I want to tell President Clinton 
I also respect and heed my justice system. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] 
  [Endara] [Word indistinct] we will continue the task. This 
is a momentary [words indistinct]. For now, we will follow the 
same path. 
  [Martinez] There will be a lack of U.S. cooperation. 
  [Endara] If they do not want to cooperate, we can do nothing 
about it. They are the ones who consume the drug, and they are 
the ones who have created a problem for us in Panama. The most 
consumption takes place in the United States. Because the drug 
passes through here, some of it remains in Panama, and it 
affects our youths. If they do not help us, what can we do?

  [Text] "The statements by Robert Gelbard, U.S. deputy 
assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs, are 
vague and ambiguous when he says Panama is a drug 
money-laundering center," Foreign Minister Jose Raul Mulino said 
yesterday. Mulino said: "Gelbard's statements are not specific 
and shed no light on the faults committed by Panamanian 
authorities." 
  The foreign minister said that "the administration's report 
does not give names and places where the illegalities occur." 
Mulino said: "The case to which the document alluded was the 
raid on the Gil Cafe Company, but added there was no sustaining 
evidence in the fact." [sentence as published] 
  For his part, Supreme Court Magistrate Jose Manuel Faundes 
cited "the strange U.S. attitude of discrediting Panama's image 
before the concert of nations." Faundes stressed the national 
authorities' cooperation against drug trafficking, a situation 
that can be brought up in the face of any accusation on the part 
of the United States." [no opening quotation mark as published] 
The magistrate said: "Panamanian international financial centers 
have controlled money laundering, something to which U.S. banks 
can attest." 
  A U.S. delegation is visiting the country and being escorted 
by Olegario Barrelier, president of the National Banking 
Association (ABN). This visit will last until 11 April, 
according to Barrelier's agenda.

<F P=106> [Report by Vilma E. Figueroa B.] </F>
  [Text] Carlos Felipe Escobar, chairman of the Legislative 
Assembly Drug Control and Eradication Committee, believes the 
United States is also responsible for the existing drug problems 
in Panama because the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) was 
approved two years ago, but the U.S. Senate still has not 
ratified it. 
  Three days ago, Robert Gelbard, U.S. deputy assistant 
secretary of state for inter-American affairs, said Panama has 
become a "very important" center for the laundering 
narcodollars. This prompted the Panamanian Government to 
prepare a protest note which will be delivered this week to the 
authorities of President Clinton's administration. 
  "MLAT is shelved because there are senators who have been 
unwilling to approve the treaty, which would permit both 
countries (Panama and the United States) to conduct operations 
to counter the drug problem," the president of the assembly's 
drug committee said. 
  For his part, Rodrigo Arosemena, former customs director, 
said the Panamanian authorities have countered drug trafficking 
but if the U.S. authorities do not want to accept this fact, 
they should offer proof.

<F P=106> [Report by Ruben Dario Diaz] </F>
  [Text] Yesterday, Samuel Lewis Galindo, presidential 
candidate of the "National Consensus Alliance," said the United 
States has assumed an irresponsible attitude by saying Panama 
has not cooperated in the antidrug-trafficking struggle. 
Galindo said efforts are being made in Panama to cooperate in 
the antidrug-trafficking struggle, and the United States has 
exaggerated in saying the contrary. "We are all intent on ending 
drug trafficking and money laundering once and for all in our 
country because it is difficult to say it will end, but it is 
incorrect to say nothing has been done," he said. 
  The presidential candidate said there are authorities who 
are 
trying to fight narcotrafficking, but he added there are groups 
of criminals who attempt to evade the security system because 
Panama is a country with long coastlines on both oceans, which 
makes it even more difficult to control. 
  Galindo also mentioned the charges against the former 
government. He said Panamanians cannot live permanently in the 
past but must learn from experiences from the past and look to 
the future; otherwise, "we will be living in the past, and the 
future will be the one that is lost."

<F P=106> [Report by Ciro Ortega from the "RPC Television News" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] Five of the seven presidential candidates agreed 
today on the need to develop a more humane economy. This was 
the most relevant point of the Second National Meeting on Unity 
and Human Development. 
  The activity to support the Panamanian democratic process 
was 
promoted by the United Nations and took place at the Marriott 
Hotel in the capital. At this Second National Meeting on Unity 
and Human Development, presidential candidates Ruben Dario 
Carles of the Change '94 Alliance, Samuel Lewis Galindo of the 
National Consensus Alliance, Jose Salvador Munoz of the 
Doctrinaire Panamenist Party, Ernesto Perez Balladares of the 
United People Alliance, and Eduardo Vallarino of the Christian 
Democratic Party had the opportunity to present their main 
political ideas. 
  The candidates agreed on the need to strengthen democracy 
through politics aimed at the less-favored segments of the 
population by emphasizing education, health, and employment. 
They also stressed the need to put the reverted areas to use 
and to strengthen the transfer of the interoceanic waterway to 
Panamanian hands. 
  The event was attended by the former presidents of Uruguay 
and Colombia, Drs. Julio Maria Sanguinetti and Belisario 
Betancur, respectively, representing the international 
community. Meanwhile, Fernando Zumbado, UN assistant secretary 
general and program director for Latin America, praised the 
degree of maturity displayed by what is being called an state 
agenda for the country's future. He pointed out that similar 
events will be held after 8 May to improve the quality of and 
conditions for the transition between the current and future 
government. 
  Former Colombian President Belisario Betancur emphasized 
that 
the plans that were presented are close to what Panama needs. 
  [Begin Betancur recording] I was candidate for the 
presidency 
of Colombia four times. Thus, I was coprotagonist in four 
electoral processes, and I know that each electoral process 
involves uneasiness and, at times, abuses. Once the elections 
are over, however, this becomes ancient history, not even recent 
history. Ancient history because vast possibilities are opened 
for the future. And I think that Panamanians are searching for 
solutions to their own problems in a normal, constructive, and 
creative manner. [end recording] 
  Betancur pointed out that government policies must be 
stongly 
humane to help the downtrodden.

he would resign if the government approved last week's gasoline 
price increase. Sources close to Merino Pacheco told EL 
OBSERVADOR that he sought to obtain "political profit" inside 
his faction and this annoyed Minister Ache. 
  Merino Pacheco is a nephew of Jorge Pacheco Areco, Colorado

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities monitored through 7 April. 
  Export earnings derived from the marketing of 120,359 tonnes 
of meat, sausages, offal, and by-products totalled $218.3 
million in 1993. Even though the volume exported was down 13.7 
percent compared with the previous year, the price per tonne was 
up by 1.9 percent totaling $1,814. Beef exports, which account 
for 10.2 percent of Uruguay's exports, totaled $156.2 million, 
thus registering a 14.1 percent decline. The leading importers 
of Uruguayan beef are the UK, Chile, Germany, Israel, Brazil, 
and Japan, which purchase 62.7 percent of total meat exports. 
(Montevideo EL PAIS in Spanish 22 Mar 94 Market Indicators 
Section p 1) 
  A study done by the Planning and Budget Office and funded by 
the United Nations Development Program reveals that the level of 
poverty in Uruguay has considerably declined over the last eight 
years. It fell 40 percent in Montevideo from 1984-92, and 20 
percent in the cities of the interior. The study notes that 
Uruguay has the lowest level of poverty in Latin America. 
(Montevideo BUSQUEDA in Spanish 24 Mar 94 p 31) 
  The government registered a surplus totaling 85.8 million 
pesos, some $19.2 million, in January, thus reversing the 
negative results of the previous eight months. Despite this 
positive figure, the fiscal situation continues to show signs of 
deterioration due to the continued increase in government 
spending, which was up 25 percent in January compared with the 
same month in 1993, and the decrease in tax revenues, which 
declined 7 percent in the same month. Public investment in 
January surged 36.5 percent. (Montevideo EL PAIS in Spanish 29 
Mar 94 Market Indicators Section p 1) 
  Wholesale prices rose 3 percent in March, thus registering a 
32 percent increase over the last 12 months and an accrued 
increase of 7.1 percent in the first quarter of this year. 
Agricultural products were up by nearly 10 percent; livestock 
products by 4.0 percent; fishing products by 0.5 percent; and 
manufactured goods by 2.1 percent. (Montevideo EL PAIS in 
Spanish 31 Mar 94 Market Indicators Section p 1)

  [Text] San Salvador, 6 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- The report on El 
Salvador presented by UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali 
to the Security Council is not consistent with the national 
reality, Alfredo Cristiani, president of that Central American 
country, said today. 
  On 28 March Ghali presented a report to the UN Security 
Council concerning the development of the peace accords in El 
Salvador. He emphasized the government's failure to comply with 
several points of the Chapultepec Pact, signed in Mexico City in 
January 1992. Ghali indicated in his report that "it was 
necessary to adopt urgent measures so that the peace process can 
get back on track" and to "demand" that the Salvadoran 
Government comply with all the peace accords. 
  "The truth is that we are surprised because the reply 
implies 
that the government lacks the political will to comply with the 
accords, and this is not true," Cristiani said. He said Ghali's 
report does not explain to the Security Council all the reasons 
that have prevented compliance with important aspects of the 
agreements, and this has nothing to do with a lack of will. 
  The report says constitutional reforms have yet to be 
endorsed in the judicial branch and that there are delays in the 
distribution of land among former fighters, the National 
Civilian Police's deployment, and the former National Police's 
dismantling. Cristiani said: In the case of the constitutional 
reforms, the decision is up to the legislative branch rather 
than the executive branch, and "the (?government) is not 
responsible for this." 
  He said the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) 
is also responsible for the lack of compliance with the peace 
accords, particularly with regard to the distribution of land 
among former fighters. Cristiani accused the FMLN of refusing 
to participate in a high-level meeting to "leave the new 
government with a clean slate concerning the accords." 
  He called into question the fact that no one had waited for 
the report from Augusto Ramirez Ocampo, former chief of the 
[words indistinct] mission, who handed over his post on 31 March 
and whose analysis of the peace process is "more in accordance 
with the country's reality." 
  According to Cristiani, the report presented to the UN 
Security Council was prepared based on information delivered by 
the UN secretary general's adviser, Alvaro de Soto, who made "a 
quick visit to the country." 
  The Salvadoran president announced his government will send 
a 
written reply to Ghali next week, debating his report point by 
point. It will also send a copy to the Security Council. "The 
time to answer has come because it seems the government does not 
want to comply," Cristiani said, who noted that the official 
document would be released soon.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on developments related to the runoff in the Salvadoran 
presidential election scheduled for 24 April 1994. 
  On 5 April, the leftist coalition presidential slate 
confirmed its participation in the runoff presidential election 
scheduled for 24 April. Presidential candidate Dr. Ruben Zamora 
said the Salvadoran left hopes the irregularities registered on 
20 March will be overcome so as to guarantee the cleanliness of 
the process. The commitment made by Supreme Electoral Tribunal 
(TSE) magistrates to correct the anomalies is key to democracy, 
and the cleanliness of the Salvadoran electoral process depends 
on it, Dr. Zamora remarked. Zamora concluded by saying a draft 
bill will be presented before the Assembly requesting a series 
of temporary reforms to the Electoral Code. (San Salvador Radio 
Cadena YSU in Spanish 1800 GMT 5 Apr 94) 
  Dr. Francisco Lima, leftist coalition vice presidential 
candidate, has strongly denied reports some coalition parties 
exerted pressure so that the left would not participate in the 
runoff elections. Lima stated: "What has characterized the 
coalition's political campaign is its sincerity." In a news 
conference, presidential candidate Zamora confirmed the TSE 
commitment to correct irregularities registered in the previous 
elections. He added: "The TSE has pledged to double the number 
of polling stations in the largest cities and place ballot boxes 
apart so as to avoid overcrowding." (San Salvador Canal Doce 
Television in Spanish 0300 GMT 6 Apr 94)

<F P=106> [From the "Five O'Clock Sharp" newscast] </F>
  [Excerpt] At a very lively news conference during which 
reporters asked many questions, General Humberto Ortega said the 
Army and the executive branch had still not reached an agreement 
on the military organization law. He said an agreement will 
probably be reached in 15 days but that the draft has not been 
sent to the legislature because no consensus has been reached. 
We asked Gen. Ortega if he was not the center of discord [words 
indistinct] his retirement. He denied this. Let us hear what 
Humberto Ortega said: 
  [Begin Ortega recording] I think we have to be confident. 
Our work with the executive branch has been detailed and 
determined. We have discussed it several times precisely 
because we want to give the country and the Army a law that is a 
solid basis for the future. We do not want things to be done 
haphazardly. I think it is preferable to have a delay and end 
up with a solid document that can take us into the end of this 
century and into the next than to reach an agreement quickly. 
We want a serious law, not something done carelessly that will 
not be respected later or whose regulations will not be followed 
or that impede the institution's efforts to mature, as has been 
the case throughout this century. 
  The truth is that we did not inherit a Nicaraguan Army. The 
National Guard was destroyed in the 1979 revolt. We started to 
build the Army after the peace agreement was signed in Sapoa in 
1988. During the war [words indistinct] during the Reagan 
administration, it was impossible to build an Army for all 
Nicaragua. So this Army is still young and things are still 
rough. It is true that there has been a delay in the executive 
branch's and Army's search for a mature, adequate, and feasible 
law. We think it is worth it to wait 15 days at the most to see 
if we are able to reach an agreement on a law that will not be 
disregarded later on. The Army and I are totally willing to 
achieve this goal, and we are confident that we will overcome 
the problems that still, today, prevent me from telling 
Nicaragua that the executive branch and the Army have reached a 
thorough agreement. We agree on many things, but there are 
others crucial issues about which we have not been able to reach 
an adequate consensus. I am confident that we will reach it.

<F P=106> [News conference by National Assembly President Luis </F>
Humberto Guzman with unidentified reporters; place not given; 
from the "Five O'Clock Sharp" newscast; broadcast in progress -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Reporter] ...Humberto Guzman, General Ortega 
emphatically stated he will not step down under the current 
circumstances. What happened? Did he negotiate with you? What 
did you talk about? 
  [Guzman] I do not know if he emphatically stated he will not 
step down. He said he is perfectly aware of the temporary 
nature of his mandate; he knows it is for a fixed period of 
time. It seems to me he is aware of the temporary nature of 
that mandate. 
  [Reporter] Do you agree with the military organization law 
being debated in the National Assembly? 
  [Guzman] It is obvious that movements and deployments by the 
Armed Forces should be in accordance with the law. 
  [Reporter] Ortega said an agreement could be reached within 
15 days and that there are problems with the executive branch at 
present. What can you say about this? 
  [Guzman] He told me there are various criteria regarding the 
military organization law, but it seems to me that these 
differences do not pertain precisely to the nature of his 
mandate. 
  [Reporter] If the military organization law is not 
presented, if a consensus is not reached between the executive 
branch and Armed Forces, will the National Assembly present its 
own draft bill? 
  [Guzman] According to the Constitu?ion, the National 
Assembly is the country's legislative branch, and it must do its 
duty. 
  [Reporter] Will it? 
  [Guzman] Of course. 
  [Reporter] Are any draft bills ready? 
  [Guzman) Yes, there are a few draft bills pertaining to 
military organization. I would like to say, however, that the 
National Assembly is not trying to create unproductive and 
useless crises in the country. We are not setting a deadline 
for the government to submit its draft bill. I must say, 
however, that we cannot wait indefinitely. We have promised the 
country that we would pass a military organization law during 
the first half of 1994, and the National Assembly will keep its 
word. 
  [Reporter] Doctor, you stated emphatically that Gen. Ortega 
should step down before the year ends, as President Chamorro 
said. Do you still hold that opinion? 
  [Guzman] I maintain that public posts should be temporary. 
That includes the post of Armed Forces chief. 
  [Reporter] The general spoke of a 15-day deadline. Has the 
National Assembly reached an agreement with the general 
regarding that 15-day deadline? 
  [Guzman] He told me he expects and hopes that within the 
next 15 days he and the cabinet will reach an agreement 
concerning a draft bill for the military organization law. 
  [Reporter] The general said the Assembly cannot prepare a 
draft bill without reaching a consensus with the military. 
  [Guzman] The National Assembly obviously consults with the 
people who are affected the most by any given law, just as it 
invites bankers to discuss the general banking law or to discuss 
the advantages or disadvantages of certain laws. Obviously it 
must do the same with the Armed Forces on the military law. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] working on certain topics, 
according to Gen. Ortega. 
  [Guzman] That was the gist of the conversation. He told me 
there were difficulties with certain issues on which agreements 
had not been reached but that, in his opinion, this debate 
should not extend beyond the next two weeks. 
  [Reporter] He spoke of (?vital) topics. (?What are those 
vital topics) [words indistinct] after eight hours of talks. 
  [Guzman] They involve the Armed Forces' general functions, 
but I would like to say that I do not believe the deadline on 
the issue of Gen. Ortega's remaining in the Army were among the 
issues discussed.

  [Text] The arrest of two suspects in a plot against the 
Honduran president, the arrest of Commander Saul Alvarez' 
murderer in Miami, and the drug problem in the country were 
topics addressed by Commander Fernando Caldera, director of the 
National Police. Police arrested two individuals suspected of 
participating in the plot to assassinate Honduran President 
Carlos Roberto Reina. Santiago Rivas Betancourt was arrested in 
Esteli on 5 April, and Luis Rene Quintero was arrested in 
Managua on 6 April. 
  [Begin Caldera recording] Because it is a sign of a serious 
act, we are proceeding to arrest them. The law empowers us to 
hold them for 72 hours; during that time, we are going to try to 
determine the facts. [end recording] 
  Another Nicaraguan suspect in the case, which was made 
public 
in Honduras on 5 April, remains at large. Honduran authorities 
have identified him as Roger Arguello. Caldera made these 
statements when he announced Commander Saul Alvarez' murderer 
was arrested in Miami last week. Javier or Manuel Velasquez 
murdered Commander Alvarez on 21 September 1992 during a 
transportation strike. The murderer illegally entered the United 
States by going from Managua to Guatemala and Mexico, then to 
the United States. The police worked in coordination with the 
FBI and Dade County police to capture Velasquez. 
  [Begin Caldera recording] He is now under the jurisdiction 
of 
immigration authorities. The Nicaraguan Government -- it is no 
longer up to the police -- will make every effort to bring him 
to Nicaragua so he can be tried in Managua. [end recording] 
  Velasquez left the country 10 days after the shoot-out on 
the 
northern highway. 
  On another topic, Commander Caldera said he is unaware of 
the 
State Department report which indicated Nicaragua has reportedly 
not achieved progress with its strategy against drug trafficking. 
  [Being Caldera recording] The Nicaraguan state has been 
advancing in the antidrug struggle starting from zero. Drug 
trafficking in Nicaragua is a relatively new crime. [end 
recording] 
  He described the draft law against drugs as a modern law 
that 
will fight crime.

<F P=106> [Report by Juan Jose Lacayo] </F>
  [Text] Yesterday, National Police Chief Fernando Caldera 
said he did not have any details concerning a U.S. State 
Department report that charges Nicaragua has made little 
progress in its struggle against drug trafficking and money 
laundering. Nevertheless, Caldera said, "The Nicaraguan state 
has made progress in its fight against drug trafficking, a fight 
that started from nothing." 
  Caldera indicated that in Nicaragua drug trafficking is a 
relatively new crime. The police chief said: "Drug 
consumption, particularly cocaine consumption, is a new element 
that has increased significantly in the past two years with 
trafficking." He said this kind of criminal activity has 
increased 116 percent. "These actions have significantly 
increased since 1993," the high- ranking police officer 
asserted. 
  Nevertheless, Caldera explained that last year, the National 
Assembly began discussing a draft drug fighting bill, which he 
termed modern. He also stressed that last year the government 
created the National Antidrug Commission, while police created 
the Narcotics Directorate. "We now have a higher level of 
coordination with the DEA and Central American police forces," 
Caldera remarked as he recalled that the amount of drugs 
confiscated has increased sharply. "We are not yet doing 
everything we can, but the foundations have been laid," he 
pointed out. 
  Caldera explained that the U.S. DEA does not have an office 
in Managua, "but we maintain a close, cooperative relationship." 
He insisted a large publicity campaign will be needed to fight 
drug trafficking and consumption, but he warned that there will 
not be enough resources this year to undertake such a campaign. 
  Caldera said he wants "all of us" in Nicaragua "to develop a 
social disapproval for those engaged in drug-related activities 
in order that these people do not acquire the levels of 
notoriety they have in other countries in which there is a 
certain status attributed to narcotraffickers." 
  The police chief added there are abuses by some judges who 
lend themselves to the objectives of drug traffickers. "These 
are very rare cases, and they do not mean that everyone within 
the judiciary branch is in on it," he explained. 
  In addition, Caldera admitted some policemen have been 
punished for collaborating with drug traffickers, and he 
reiterated that police organizations are determined to fight 
these crimes. 
  The police chief said money laundering is an activity that 
is 
very easily detected in our country, although he admitted it 
might take place on a small scale in Nicaragua. "Dollars are 
laundered everywhere, even in the United States," Police Chief 
Caldera concluded.

<F P=106> [Proposal by committee on "Details of the FSLN Principles </F>
and Program"; first four paragraphs are introduction] 
  [Text] In its session on 28 August 1993, the Sandinist 
Assembly convened the National Congress of the FSLN [Sandinist 
National Liberation Front] to an extraordinary session to be 
held in May 1994. In both the National Leadership and the 
Sandinist Assembly, it has organized committees to prepare 
documents to serve as a basis for discussion. 
  One of these committees is called "Details of the FSLN 
Principles and Programs". Its specific mandate was to 
prepare positions for discussion on four issues: 
  a) The FSLN's position on its relations with the U.S. 
Government. 
  b) The FSLN's position on the government of Nicaragua. 
  c) The FSLN's position on the problem of property. 
  d) The FSLN's position on the multiclass composition of 
the Sandinist membership. 
  The present document is the result of the work done by this 
committee, which revised the FSLN's Principles and 
Program on the issues listed above. It hereby presents the 
following proposal which updates and attempts to clarify the 
FSLN's positions. 
  This document is the basis for discussion which the 
Sandinists should use in their debate. The theses were prepared 
so as to facilitate discussion and so that the FSLN members can 
vote to express whether they wish to approve, reject, or amend 
each thesis. Then the results of the debate will be sent back to 
the Sandinist Assembly's Program Committee and be incorporated 
in the final version which the Congress will consider and 
approve in its Extraordinary Session to be held from 20 to 22 
May. 
<H5>  I. FSLN's Position on the Government of Nicaragua </H5>
  1. The FSLN opposes any restoration of the system of 
exploitation of human beings that prevailed during Somozism, the 
oligarchical governments of the past, or any other form of 
dictatorship or authoritarianism, either civilian or military, 
which represents a restriction of the exercise of participatory 
democracy. 
  2. The FSLN demands that the Public Administration be a 
loyal 
servant of the interests of the people and the Nation, for which 
purpose it shall fight against embezzlement, administrative 
corruption, abuses of state and community property, and against 
any manifestation of arrogance, bureaucratism, and negligence in 
public activity. 
  3. It will work to decentralize the government's role and 
bureaucracy by providing strong support for municipal autonomy. 
Consequently, it asks that the necessary resources be given to 
each local government to promote development within its 
territory. 
  4. The FSLN will work to ensure respect for Nicaragua's 
Constitution and democratic institutions. This will 
include limits on the State in relation to civil society and the 
rights of the individual; independence of state powers; 
periodic, transparent, and fair elections; respect for law and 
legality as the standard governing relations among individuals, 
and between individuals and society and the state; respect for 
and development of individual protections and liberties and 
human rights, as well as institutions, organizations, and areas 
for participation and management by the workers and by all the 
people, so that democracy may be transformed into an everyday 
occurrence. 
  To cope with the crisis, overcome instability, and 
reactivate the nation, the FSLN proposes: 
  1. To pursue a clear strategy of opposition to government 
policies that are causing the nation's prostration and the 
impoverishment of the vast majority of the people. 
  2. To demand that the state serve as the principal promoter 
of national development, guaranteeing to the people their 
integral democratic participation in this development, and 
performing, without pursuing state-aggrandizing aims, a 
regulatory role for economic activity that will work to benefit 
the majority of the people. 
  The state needs to ensure that the development model to be 
pursued in Nicaragua does not give rise to large concentrations 
of capital and of power in a few decision-making centers; to the 
loss of national sovereignty by succumbing to foreign capital; 
to exclusion and poverty in large sectors of the population; and 
to injustice and arbitrary actions concerning access to the 
opportunites provided by the nation's resources. In summary, the 
state must not allow Nicaragua to again become a breeding ground 
for conditions that will lead to confrontation and violence. 
  3. We demand economic democratization as an indispensable 
requirement for achieving stability and national economic 
development with social justice. State economic policies must 
act in consistency with those objectives, by encouraging the 
development of small and midsized businesses, cooperatives, and 
associative enterprises. 
  The only way to overcome the vulnerability of the democratic 
process and ensure its stability is by basing this process on a 
nonexclusive economic and social project that rests on the 
foundation of economic democratization. 
  4. We demand that the state guarantee freedom of trade, 
along 
with fulfilling its obligation to protect citizens when, in 
crisis conditions caused by a variety of reasons, unjust 
situations of speculation arise that primarily afflict the 
poorest sectors of the population. 
  5. The Sandinist Front is working for a thorough 
democratization of the state and to strengthen Sandinist 
influence in institutions and in all spheres of power of civil 
society. 
  We believe that in order to deepen and expand 
democratization, it is of strategic importance to promote the 
organizing capability and influence of the organizations of 
civil society: social and popular movements, productive and 
professional associations, the media, etc. 
  The campaign to democratize the state and institutions is an 
ongoing and strategic objective for Sandinists. Today from the 
opposition, and tomorrow--after we win the elections--from 
inside the government, the FSLN has no desire to wield absolute 
power. 
  6. For the Sandinist Front, the electoral approach is the 
only valid way to regain the government. Acting in harmony with 
our democratic commitment, we proclaim that today there is no 
room or justification for armed conflict in Nicaragua. 
  The Sandinist Front calls upon Sandinists to promote and 
develop methods of civic struggle that will be most effective in 
developing a political consensus in support of its goals. 
<H5>  II. FSLN's Position on Property </H5>
  1. Property must be in accordance with the nation's economic 
development and social justice for the population. For that 
reason, the FSLN must fight for the security, democratization, 
and productivity of all forms of property: private, individual, 
or business; cooperative, associative, community, and public 
property. 
  The FSLN should encourage respect for private property by 
promoting the productivity of its possession and the social 
function of its management and use. This political claim to 
property must be founded on and sustained with efficiency in 
economic management, while at the same time the concentration of 
property in just a few families is discouraged. 
  2. The FSLN respects and defends the stability of private 
property. In the same way, it also encourages the development of 
all forms of cooperative, associative, and community property, 
considering them an expression of the socialization process. 
  3. The FSLN opposes the confiscation of property in any of 
its forms of management. 
  4. The FSLN considers the following to be strategic 
undertakings: productive and commercial organization, access to 
credit and investment programs, participation in national and 
international markets by small and midsized forms of property, 
as well as that of cooperative, associative municipal, and 
community property. 
  5. The FSLN pledges to the nation's economic and social 
agents that it will deal with the issues of property as they 
relate to political stability, productive growth, jobs, social 
equality, and environmental sustainability. 
  In this context, the FSLN is working for the immediate 
legalization of the property of workers and campesinos in 
concessional or licensing conditions, terms, and for just 
compensation to be provided to sectors whose property rights 
have been infringed. 
<H5>  III. FSLN's Position on its Social Composition </H5>
  1. The fundament of Sandinism's Political Program 
and of its Statutes. The FSLN is a multiclass 
organization in its composition, which reflects the composition 
of the Nicaraguan population. 
  The Political Program of the FSLN--the proposal it 
offers to society--in which it expresses the objectives of 
Sandinism in each phase, is decisive. Sandinism is not defined 
simply by the composition of the membership ranks of the FSLN. 
  2. After 10 years of profound changes, Nicaraguan society is 
now a pluralistic society. Today economic and political power 
are distributed among numerous government institutions and 
throughout civil society. 
  The Front recognizes this situation as the basic condition 
necessary for an authentically democratic system to function. We 
propose to strengthen this tendency by encouraging and 
developing it in all of the nation's socioeconomic sectors, 
without failing to prioritize the strengthening of the capacity 
of the masses to exercise political power for the defense of 
their interests, and in favor of an economic, social, and 
political model that will benefit them. 
  3. As a revolutionary party, the FSLN must extend its roots 
deep into the masses, through its efforts to defend 
revolutionary gains and the democratic transformations of 
society. 
  The Front must promote and defend the campesinos as the most 
important sector at this time, because of their economic 
significance and their political weight. 
  4. The FSLN must clearly define its policy toward various 
social sectors, not only social classes, but those forces that 
play an important role in society, like women, young people, 
indigenous communities, the Atlantic Coast communities, 
territorial movements like the Community Movement, etc. 
<H5>  IV. FSLN's Position on Relations with the U.S. Government </H5>
  1. In the context of establishing relations of respect, 
cooperation, and friendship with all nations, the FSLN calls for 
a new relationship to be created between the United States and 
Nicaragua, in which mutual interests may be preserved and 
historic differences may be resolved to our mutual advantage and 
benefit. 
  The events judged by the International Court of Justice in 
The Hague cannot be repeated. Nicaragua's policy toward the 
United States must be oriented toward encouraging that country 
to help to remedy the material damages caused, both by bilateral 
means and within multilateral organizations. 
  2. The FSLN believes that a respectful relationship between 
the United States and Nicaragua has two essential components: 
strict respect on the part of Nicaragua for self-determination 
and noninterference in the internal affairs of other states, and 
meaningful respect on the part of the United States for the 
sovereign and democratic decisions of the Nicaraguan people; and 
that the political, trade, and cooperative relations of the 
United States shall not be determined by the political ideology 
of whatever government may be currently in office in Nicaragua, 
nor shall any type of strings be attached to these relations. 
  Therefore, the FSLN will pursue an active relationship with 
all political parties and social groups of the United States 
which are prepared to move in this direction. 
  3. The FSLN supports the membership of Nicaragua in 
particular and Central America in general in free trade 
agreements with the United States and other countries. This 
integration must allow Nicaragua sufficient time and the 
commercial and tariff terms necessary for Nicaragua's productive 
capacity to be brought to a competitive position in relation to 
the rest of Central America. 
  Such integration must mean a net flow of financial aid and 
capital from the North to the South, which will enable us to 
overcome the deterioration in our people's standard of living 
and promote the recovery of our economies. It must be a means so 
that all, both North and South, may benefit equally and 
proportionally, rather than simply being a formula for helping 
the United States to solve its own economic problems.

<F P=106> [Interview with FSLN, Sandinist National Liberation Front, </F>
leader Sergio Ramirez Mercado with unidentified correspondents 
and audience members; place and date not given; on radio program 
"60 Minutes With Xavier Reyes Alba"; first paragraph EL 
SEMANARIO introduction] 
  [Text] In the midst of what has perhaps been the greatest 
public debate ever generated in the Sandinist Front's history, 
Dr. Sergio Ramirez Mercado, leader of the party's bench in 
Parliament and of the recently emerging faction known as "For a 
Sandinism of the Majorities," appeared on the radio program "60 
Minutes With Xavier Reyes Alba" to present his political views. 
The following is the edited, condensed transcription of 
questions posed by the newsman and his audience, along with 
Ramirez Mercado's replies. 
  [Question] Why should Sergio Ramirez sign a document of one 
faction of the FSLN? I have heard people say that the DN 
[National Directorate] should stay out of it and then, later on, 
act as a "grand judge" and hand down a final ruling. 
  [Ramirez] That view is now history. The FSLN is going 
through 
a very important phase of evolution and transformation during 
which differing points of view must be expressed in order to 
enrich debate. I have always thought that ideas and thought were 
the only thing that could change the world--along with action, 
naturally--since no change takes place without thought behind it. 
  I am a member of the DN, elected on the 1991 ticket, and we 
were supposed to remain on the Directorate until 1995, but we 
have not been protected by history. If a special congress is to 
be held, it is because the party leadership comes up for 
election. In other words, starting now and until May, I consider 
myself a provisional leader of the FSLN because that congress 
will decide whether or not I continue to occupy a post of 
leadership. Based on that freedom of action and thought, I felt 
authorized to sign a document expressing a nonconfrontational 
position, a document that is an attempt to contribute to the 
debate. When a group of FSLN comrades met to draft the document, 
we discussed whether Major Luis Carrion, who is also a member of 
the DN, and I should sign or not. We decided that the most 
honest and most transparent thing was for us to sign since we 
were involved in the drafting. We could not fall back on the old 
trick of throwing the stone and then hiding our hand. 
  [Question] How can you win power when some think that the 
Front is not yet prepared to be unified, not just because 
factions exist, but because of an entire culture, different 
styles of work and leadership, that seem to stand in the way of 
any possibility of unity? 
  [Ramirez] That is precisely what we must change. The FSLN 
must face up to a process of transformation because it has never 
been afraid of change. Far worse would be to imagine a 
conservative Sandinism afraid of taking a chance, of moving 
forward, of thinking. If the Sandinists were able to put an end 
to the Somoza dictatorship, it was because they moved ahead, not 
just with military action, but also with new political ideas, by 
joining forces and forming alliances. The creation of the Group 
of the Twelve was a key move enabling the FSLN to take power by 
calling upon social sectors which, at the time, did not yet 
envision the FSLN as a government alternative and which in 1979 
did so despite the fact that the FSLN proposed the option of 
armed struggle. Now, if what the FSLN is presenting is the 
option of civil, electoral struggle, then I believe all the more 
strongly that we can once again summon thousands of Nicaraguans 
who believe that this country deserves a better fate and that 
the FSLN can provide it. 
  [Question] The crux of the matter is how to unite the 
so-called "majorities." What must the Sandinists offer in order 
to win them back? 
  [Ramirez] A very clear message. I think the Sandinists lost 
the 1990 elections because many Nicaraguans began to harbor many 
prejudices in their minds. The people thought the FSLN was a 
symbol of war, that it would not solve the country's economic 
problems. 
  [Question] But it continues to project that image at times. 
  [Ramirez] That is what we want and need to change at all 
costs. I maintain that if the FSLN does not get to the 
majorities with the image of a civilian party, removed from 
violence, removed from any confrontation, one that wants harmony 
and reconciliation for this country, then it will be very 
difficult for us to rally the votes we need to win because we 
are indeed talking about votes here. Furthermore, it neither 
frightens me nor makes me ashamed to say that the FSLN is a 
revolutionary, electoral party because it has to go into the 
elections and win. One wins elections by rallying the will of 
all those who go into the little booth and who then, alone with 
their conscience, place a mark under a flag and decide for whom 
they will vote. That is the decisive, definitive time for a 
political party, far from the noise of the crowds and the 
demonstrations. I hope that a new, transparent FSLN, an FSLN 
that is very clear and firm about what it says, about doing what 
it says and saying what it does, can convince the voters that we 
are once again a viable alternative for the country. 
  [Question] I would like you to define what you mean when you 
say, "We oppose violence," what kind of weapons the working 
people still have, people who, because of the Sandinism of the 
majorities, accused the group of being social democratic. 
  [Ramirez] I do not think the FSLN has any weapons left. 
Those 
weapons are now in the hands of the Army and the Police, which 
are the only institutions allowed to have weapons in this 
country. This must be stated quite clearly and without fear. The 
FSLN is a party that must use all the paths of civic struggle 
that are open to it, not lending themselves to confusion. The 
FSLN must fight from the perspective of the majorities, their 
conquests and their rights. The right to strike, marches, and 
social pressure are legitimate instruments. What is not 
legitimate is resorting to violence in a strike, attacking those 
who do not agree with what is being done. 
  In addition, certain terms are deliberately used to confuse 
the people. I am referring to the notorious "social democracy." 
As a result of a decision by the Sandinist Assembly, the FSLN 
appealed to the Socialist International, an international 
organization of social democratic parties, to admit it as a full 
member, but the IS decided to admit the FSLN as an observer. The 
request was a party decision, not a decision by individuals in 
the party. Before that, as we prepared for the World 
Interparliamentary meeting, we decided, following the 
assassination of Olof Palme, one of the outstanding social 
democratic leaders in the world, to give his name to the 
convention center. Major Daniel Ortega, secretary general of the 
party, personally attended the funeral of Willy Brandt, another 
of the foremost social democratic leaders in the world, in order 
to pay homage to him on behalf of the Sandinists. The Sandinists 
have always been a friend of social democrats and continue to 
be. I am not an enemy of any social democratic leader. Next week 
I will meet in Spain with Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, a 
great friend of Nicaragua and the Nicaraguan revolution. He is a 
social democrat and does not go around denying it. I am not a 
social democrat, but I am not their enemy either and see nothing 
wrong with being one. I am a democratic Sandinist who believes 
that the only possible Sandinism is democratic Sandinism because 
if someone were to tell me that there is a type of Sandinism 
that is potentially totalitarian, I would not believe it. 
  [Question] Why is there no definition of the left anywhere 
in 
the document? 
  [Ramirez] It is stated in the document, a leftist document. 
It is not, in my view, a rightist document, nor is the one 
drafted by our other comrades in the FSLN rightist because the 
FSLN is not a party of the right. The Nicaraguan political 
spectrum has a right and a left and the political space occupied 
by the latter is filled by the FSLN. However, it is necessarily 
a democratic left and I find it unnecessary to speak of a 
democratic left. The left is the left, the left of today. 
Perhaps there was a totalitarian left before, but it disappeared 
and one cannot say "I belong to the democratic left" because 
this would amount to agreeing that there is also a left that is 
not democratic and for me such a thing is impossible. If I 
belong to the left, I am democratic. 
  [Question] How convinced is the entire FSLN and all its 
members that they do indeed no longer represent the majority, 
that they cannot lay claim to representing the nation or 
thinking for it, that we must have a change in style, method, 
and thought in order for the FSLN to return to power in the 1996 
elections? 
  [Ramirez] I believe there are many more people convinced of 
that than would appear. An attempt is often made to give a false 
image of radicalism in the ranks of Sandinism, as if it were 
enclosed in a radicalism with no way out and as if ideas about 
transformation, change, and renewal existed only in the heads of 
a handful of intellectuals. I am labeled an intellectual as if 
it were an offense, and it seems to me to be somewhat odd that 
anyone who thinks or who is an intellectual should be treated in 
a pejorative manner. All of us who think are in some way 
intellectuals, but the term "intellectual" is used to denote an 
elite that is unaware of what is happening among the rank and 
file, that only thinks about things unrelated to Nicaragua, as 
if to renew Sandinism, to transform its ideas, to go back to the 
majorities, were social democratic, European notions removed 
from this society. I have even been accused of having a European 
education, as if that were somehow negative. 
  [Listener fromn Boaco] Why do you not have access to 
broadcasting stations such as "Radio Ya," "Radio Sandino," 
"Channel 4," and all the supposedly Sandinist media? That 
worries the rank and file because while the leaders say there is 
no split, we see different groups. What is happening within the 
party? 
  [Ramirez] I share your concerns, comrade. They are 
well-founded, but you should not be worried about finding 
different ways of thinking within the FSLN. Thought must be 
heterogeneous in order to enrich debate, provided we are still 
speaking the same language. What we should be concerned about is 
silence, particularly when one is not allowed to express 
oneself. I would be very happy to speak on "Radio Ya," but I do 
not have access to that station. About three months ago, I 
participated in a debate on the constitution on Channel 4, but I 
would not say that I have access to that television or radio 
time. I think we must be honest in stating that this is an 
internal problem of the FSLN that we must air publicly. I prefer 
not to have time on certain radio stations, but I hope they will 
not mention me or my late brother at all! I prefer it that way 
because I have always opposed insults, slander or lies, which I 
cannot accept as a Sandinist. Your concern is well-founded 
because all Sandinists should have access to all the media. It 
is a great pleasure to be on Xavier Reyes's program because he 
invited me and has never denied me access. It was I who delayed 
coming for reasons of time. 
  [Question] The emergence of currents of thought with 
well-defined positions has "shifted the ground" under the feet 
of those traditionally accustomed to "the line," to the fact 
that such matters were not debated publicly. They say they are 
confused, that the party is split and is falling apart. 
  [Ramirez] That is a concern which must be removed from the 
thinking of people who truly believe in the strength of the 
party. The FSLN continues to be a very strong party and will be 
strengthened even further the more we debate, the more we think. 
You do not have to worry about me. If the ideas I present do not 
find acceptance among the majority of the FSLN and the latter 
makes a different decision, then, in a disciplined manner, I 
will yield to what the party says. That is why I belong to a 
party. I will continue to be a member of the FSLN. I would never 
switch to another party, nor would I fit into any political or 
ideological faction other than my FSLN. If the majority decides 
that the methods of struggle that we must choose are precisely 
those which I view as the wrong ones, then I shall continue to 
criticize such positions if they are taken by the majority, but 
I would not leave the party. I have complete confidence that a 
revolutionary party must evolve constantly. Every tree must shed 
its leaves in order to have new green ones; that is one of 
life's laws. 
  [The same listener] I am concerned about the split in the 
party and I wish you would explain why, when you continue to be 
a member of the DN, Mr. Guadamuz denies you access to his 
program. What is going on? I wish you would be more explicit. 
  [Ramirez] It is not that I am avoiding responding because 
that is not appropriate for a leader, but I think the question 
should be put to the person who is denying me space. He should 
reveal his reasons for doing so. However, it should also be put 
to those who are insulting and slandering me and the memory of 
my brother Rogelio. Let them explain why they act as they do. 
That radio station does not belong to the party. I asked for a 
clarification from the DN, and Major Henry Ruiz, who is 
treasurer, responded that the radio does not belong to the FSLN. 
Consequently, I assume that it is a private radio station and 
that its owners--I do not know who they are--are the proper ones 
to answer for what the radio station says. Consequently, if it 
takes a divisionist attitude, an attitude that does not 
contribute to party unity, then that is the responsibility of 
the owners, not the DN or the FSLN, because they do not own it. 
That must be made quite clear. 
  [Carlos Guadamuz, director of "Radio Ya"] I was happy to 
hear 
Dr. Sergio Ramirez say he would like to be on "Radio Ya." For 
several days now, I have been trying to start a debate between 
the different factions and I am inviting him to come tomorrow or 
the day after tomorrow during prime time. It would be an 
enormous pleasure and source of pride to have Dr. Ramirez with 
us on "Radio Ya." 
  [Ramirez] I am truly very happy to hear that tone of voice 
because it is not the same (perhaps it is not the same person) 
as the one that for days has been directing insults, lies, and 
slander at me. As a Christian, I forgive them because the 
Christian faith teaches us to forgive. I would merely ask Carlos 
Guadamuz to allow me to go first to Masatepe Cemetery to consult 
with my brother Rogelio, with whom I sometimes talk at his tomb 
because he continues to be my faithful adviser, about whether I 
should accept the invitation to speak on "Radio Ya." I will 
reply when I have spoken with Rogelio. 
  I do not refuse to speak on any broadcasting station, 
particularly those claiming to be identified with my party. 
However, what I refuse to accept is that an invitation to speak 
on a station that previously heaped insults on me should then 
serve as a justification without first uttering a word of 
apology for those lies and insults. For example, it has been 
said that I betrayed Carlos Fonseca, something I cannot accept 
as mere words or verbal excesses. These are very heavy charges 
that wound me deeply because I have always defended my political 
honesty. I cannot therefore yield to such schemes or, as we say 
in Nicaragua, use such "ways out."

<F P=106> [Communique issued by the Foreign Ministry in Caracas on 6 </F>
April] 
  [Text] Given the distorted reports transmitted by certain 
foreign news agencies and subsequently published in a local 
newspaper on 5 April on the "Annual Report on the Drug Control 
Strategy at the International Level" presented by the U.S. State 
Department to the U.S. Congress, which lists Venezuela among the 
leading drug producing countries and countries used most often 
as transshipment points for drugs, the Foreign Ministry has done 
an in- depth evaluation of the aforementioned report and states 
the following: 
  1. The report and list refer to countries, Venezuela 
included, that are victims of the drug problem and which have 
cooperated fully with the United States or adopted their own 
measures to achieve full compliance with the goals and 
objectives of the 1988 UN Convention Against the Illegal Traffic 
of Narcotics and Psychotropic Substances. The preparation of 
the aforementioned report is foreseen in the U.S. Foreign Aid 
Law and allows a confirmation of the various categories of 
countries affected by the drug problem that may continue to 
receive U.S. aid. 
  2. As the report indicates, Venezuela is one of the 
countries that has offered exemplary cooperation in the struggle 
against drugs. The U.S. State Department recognizes this when 
it admits that "Venezuela is not a narcotics producing country; 
it is only used as a transshipment point for drugs going from 
Colombia to the United States and Europe." This categorically 
denies the negative reports spread by certain biased foreign 
news agencies that included only certain parts of the report in 
question. 
  3. Moreover, the U.S. Government recognizes the efforts made 
by Venezuela, a country that has endorsed the 1988 UN Convention 
Against the Illegal Traffic of Narcotics and Psychotropic 
Substances that was ratified in 1991. Furthermore, our country 
has signed 23 bilateral agreements that include most of Latin 
America, the Caribbean, and North America as well as several 
Western European countries in coordinated efforts and policies 
for the prevention, control, and repression of the illegal 
traffic of narcotics and psychotropic substances. In addition, 
on a multilateral level, Venezuela is part of the 1961 Single 
Narcotics Convention, the 1971 protocol which modifies this 
convention, the South American Accord on Narcotics and 
Psychotropic Substances (ASEP), and the Lara Bonilla Accord 
among Cartagena Agreement member countries. It is also actively 
working on programs of the Inter-American Commission for the 
Control of Drug Abuse (CICAD/OAS). 
  4. Likewise, Venezuela is among the pioneer Latin American 
countries which promulgated the 1984 Basic Law on Narcotics and 
Psychotropic Substances, which was revised in 1993 to include 
almost all the Model Regulations for the Control of Precursors 
and Chemical Substances, Machines, and Elements prepared by the 
CICAD. Moreover, the current law on this issue was adapted to 
the terms of the 1988 Vienna Convention. 
  5. Within this same context, and as acknowledged by the U.S. 
State Department report, the Venezuelan Government's struggle 
against the illegal traffic of drugs has been permanent and 
systematic. Referring to this issue, measures have been taken 
to equip the state's security organizations, and special 
financial investigation divisions have been created in the 
Technical Judicial Police (PTJ), Directorate of Intelligence and 
Prevention Services (DISIP), and the Armed Forces of National 
Cooperation. 
  6. In addition, seminars and conferences have been held in 
Caracas this year to examine the drug problem, including the one 
recently held by the CICAD on the "Use of Capital Resulting From 
the Illegal Traffic of Drugs," and the first Latin American 
Congress of Drug Experts, under the auspices of the U.S. Embassy 
and the Jose Felix Ribas Foundation. Furthermore, the country 
was visited by the executive secretary and assistant secretary 
of the International Narcotics Supervision Board (JIFE) on 21-25 
March for a firsthand look at the drug situation in Venezuela. 
Those individuals expressed their recognition of the work being 
done in this country. 
  7. As proof of the permanent struggle against that scourge, 
the state's security organizations seized 3,405,197 kg of drugs 
in 1993: cocaine (1,704,883 kg); bazuko (1,160,898 kg); 
marijuana (526.26 kg), heroin (12,686 kg), and hashish (0.500 
kg). Moreover, 12,309 people were arrested as a result of those 
seizures and Police operations; and charges were filed for drug 
consumption (10), drug possession (9,931), and drug trafficking 
(2,368). 
  8. To conclude, the Venezuela Government wishes to reassert 
its firm decision to continue the struggle against drugs, and it 
avails itself of the occasion to request the same cooperation 
from the other countries of the international community, 
particularly the government of the United States of America, a 
country with which we have excellent relations of friendship and 
cooperation. Venezuela is not a drug producer but it is 
suffering the consequences of the illegal trafficking of 
narcotics and psychotropic substances, particularly the 
laundering of dollars generated by drug trafficking activities. 
It is time to face the problem together, not through a 
misrepresentation of the facts or slanderous charges, but with 
serious efforts focused on strengthening the actions against 
this terrible scourge.

<F P=106> [Article by General Fernando Ochoa Antich, Venezuela's </F>
former defense and foreign minister: "The Coup d'Etat"] 
  [Text] I read Hilarion Cardozo's statements with great 
interest, not only because of their striking content but because 
he has always accurately interpreted the Venezuelan military's 
thinking and feelings. His position is clear. He says there 
are three groups in the Armed Forces. The first one, described 
as conservative, will follow ideas similar to the ones endorsed 
by the 27 November coup leaders and which are close to economic 
right-wing groups. Another one is located, as far as I 
understand, in the organization's middle ranks and has 
progressive tendencies. It maintains contacts with radical 
groups in our political sector. A third group prefers to give 
the Caldera government the military strength to face the current 
crisis. Cardozo is right. Three groups exist and have existed 
in the Armed Forces since 1958. 
  We recall the initial efforts of Rodolfo Jose Cardenas, the 
right-wing trend of the conspiracy against Luis Herrera, and the 
first basis of military support for Romulo Betancourt when he 
decided to put a stop to leftist congressmen of the era 
following the Encanto train attack. I believe it is necessary to 
clairfy Cardozo's proposal. Two groups have always existed in 
the Armed Forces, united by a national feeling: one, a majority 
devoid of political passion, which carries out its professional 
military job, and the other, which thinks the Armed Forces is 
the path to power. 
  What Cardozo failed to explain in his statement is that the 
politically-influenced group requires sufficient social 
deterioration to convince the majority of the Armed Forces of 
the need for a coup d'etat. Without those special conditions 
existing in the country, a coup simply would fail and would not 
be more than a coffee shop conspiracy. President Caldera and 
his government have sufficient political experience to prevent 
the forming of support around the minority group that might 
stage such a coup d'etat. I am certain of that. What does 
concern me is the vast popular unrest that exists against the 
leadership sectors for maintaining excessive privileges and 
unbridled ambitions. We Venezuelans blame that leadership for 
the misguided administration of the country. Until 1970, we had 
faith in creating a modern, developed, and different society. 
Expectations ended in utter failure and frustration. That 
perception permeated the Armed Forces and was the cause of the 4 
February and 27 November coups. The prospect that Rafael 
Caldera would come to power, with all his moral authority and 
abilities, calmed the country during those historic moments and 
again created new confidence in the Armed Forces. That is the 
true origin of the existing institutional stability. 
  Certainly, Rafael Caldera must reestablish a national 
consensus to avert a coup d'etat. Hilarion Cardozo is clear on 
this, but he does not interpret or say this consensus can only 
be secured by achieving profound national change. That is the 
government's dilemma. If it does not face the existing 
political, financial, labor, and judicial state of affairs and 
continues with sweeping reforms, popular resentment will again 
infiltrate the Armed Forces' ranks, creating the climate for a 
coup d'etat -- hence the real fear of Hilarion Cardozo and 
traditional party leaderships. They know the first obligation 
of a politician, moreso if he is a chief of state, is to 
preserve power. What will Rafael Caldera do if he feels that 
the very basis of his government is threatened? Will he permit 
a climate for conspiracy or, on the other hand, will he prefer 
to lead the national resentment, conducting the big changes 
required by the country? Only time will tell.

<F P=106> [Report by Berenice Gomez Velasquez] </F>
  [Text] Most of the servicemen who have returned from Peru 
have voiced their disappointment and puzzlement because the 
pledges made to them have not been kept. They are anxious to 
know their immediate fate since reality is very different from 
what they were promised. 
  Lawyer Virginia Contreras has briefed the local press at 
length on this situation on behalf of her clients. The 
servicemen wish to resume their military careers, but they feel 
a public statement constitutes another matter. Unofficially, the 
servicemen indicated that when they were in Lima an agreement 
was signed "and now nobody knows where it is," so that the idea 
is to ignore the terms of the agreement. They specifically 
agreed that in order to have the charges against them dropped, 
they only needed to return to the country. Now they are also 
being told to give statements accompanied by their defense 
lawyers, something that was not planned. 
  Hugo Chavez' release proved to them that there is no need to 
testify to have the charges dropped. He did not appear with the 
law, did not read the records of the proceedings, and did not 
even appear before a judge, maintained an attitude of contempt 
of court, and was always making statements. 
  To be pardoned, an arrest warrant should have been issued. 
Is 
the president dropping the charges based on privileges of rank? 
Is this hierarchical discrimination? 
  They protest the demand of prior request for discharge 
because it is not legal and because they wish to return to the 
Venezuelan Armed Forces. They charge that the authorities 
request they limit themselves to appointing counsel for the 
defense who would allow their defendants to request a discharge. 
  The officers regret the noncompliance of their commander in 
chief, who had promised to drop charges once he gained power. 
They question why they are told "the forces do not want them," 
when that statement can only be made by the High Command, the 
majority of whom were detained or confined by the coupists who 
were obeying superior orders.

  [Text] Santiago del Estero, 6 Apr (NA) -- Today, President 
Carlos Menem harshly criticized the parties that are urging 
Argentines to cast blank votes in the 10 April elections. He 
asserted it was time for people "to decide on whether to be hot 
or cold, as God will spew forth those who are lukewarm." 
  Yesterday, similar to what happened in Cordoba Province, the 
head of state once again called on citizens to turn out in 
massive number at the polls to elect Constituent Assembly 
members. Menem defended the advantages of the constitutional 
reform during a political tour he made of Frias, La Banda, and 
the city of Santiago del Estero to prop up the electoral 
possibilities for the Justicialist Party [PJ] in the provinces. 
  The president arrived in Santiago del Estero this morning 
from Cordoba, accompanied by Education Minister Jorge Rodriguez, 
Tucuman Governor Ramon Ortega, and National Mortgage Bank 
President Adelina Dalesio de Viola. He was welcomed at the 
airport by Santiago del Estero federal trustee Juan Schiaretti. 
He then flew to the city of Frias, which is located 175 km from 
here, where he later presided over a party rally. Menem 
delivered a speech at this rally, which was held in the 25 de 
Mayo Square in front of the town hall, after Schiaretti. 
  Menem sharply reprimanded those who are campaigning for the 
blank vote. Once again, he exhorted citizens to turn out in 
massive numbers to vote on 10 April because "now is the time to 
take a firm stand" to keep abreast of our country's 
transformation process. During his address, the head of state 
stressed that "the time has come to turn to the Biblical 
expression: As you are lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold, God 
will spew you forth. Lukewarmness is not a viable choice. This 
is why I do not understand how some politicians can be 
campaigning in favor of the blank vote," he stressed before 
asking "what is the value of a blank vote at a time when one has 
to stake everything on our homeland?" 
  Menem harshly reprimanded those who criticize the agreement 
signed with the Radical Civic Union [UCR]. He stated: "More than 
70 percent of Argentines are included in the pact," as they are 
represented by the two leading political parties in the country, 
the PJ and the UCR. He recalled that "six constitutional 
amendments were made in the past without there ever being a 
consensus by the majority parties." He deemed that "it is of 
paramount importance to reformulate the current legislation in 
this transformation process Argentina is undergoing." 
  The president then conceded that "these are not easy times." 
He nonetheless warned that "there was no other way but to apply 
the model and the proposal that is under way in order to lift 
Argentina out of its stagnation." He noted that "40, 50 years 
ago, the Argentine Republic was counted as one of the 10 best 
countries in the world. We are now rated as No. 16. I intend 
to once again occupy the position we used to have," he remarked. 
He also insisted that with regard to GDP, Argentina "is the 
country that has registered the greatest growth in the western 
world over the last three years, and comes in third within the 
world context after the PRC and Thailand." 
  Menem then devoted several minutes to the particular 
question 
of Frias in alluding to the building of sewage lines, the 
possible establishment of a free trade zone, the building of the 
Federal Channel which will provide water to three northwestern 
provinces, and the canalization of the Bermejo River. 
  After the rally, the head of state returned to this capital 
and got on a bus to travel to La Banda. There, at the Olimpia 
Club, he participated in a ceremony to dedicate 122 homes in the 
Ramon Taboada neighborhood. During the evening, Menem attended a 
ceremony at the Juventud Club where he made several 
announcements of strictly local interest. Later, he presided 
over a political rally to close the PJ's election campaign at 
the intersection of Belgrano and Leon Gallo Streets. 
  Menem's visit to Santiago del Estero Province coincided with 
a strike of physicians, teachers, and civil servants united in 
ATE [Association of State Workers], which the previous day had 
declared him "persona non grata." Today, ATE Chairperson Alba 
Luna de Castillo stated Menem was given "an icy welcome." She 
emphasized that "there was nobody at the airport because today 
is a day of mourning for Santiago del Estero residents." 
Moreover, she engaged in a vitriolic attack on Schiaretti, 
saying that "he spends province funds on political rallies" and 
"has done nothing to solve the problems affecting our public 
administration."

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 7 Apr (EFE) -- Argentine political 
parties will close their political campaign today in the midst 
of widespread indifference. On 10 April, citizens will elect 
305 members of a Constituent Assembly that will be responsible 
for reforming the Constitution. 
  Numerous radio and television surveys indicate that a good 
percentage of Argentine citizens are not aware of what is 
involved in the reform except that it will permit President 
Carlos Menem to run for reelection. Other surveys indicate that 
more than 25 percent of eligible voters will not vote despite 
the fact that voting is compulsory, or they will submit blank 
votes, as during the 3 October 1993 legislative election. 
  Yesterday, former President Raul Alfonsin, candidate for the 
Radical Civic Union (UCR) in Buenos Aires Province, asked people 
to vote for his party "to make sure that the Constitution will 
be a guarantee of justice and security for all." Carlos Menem, 
in turn, presided over a ceremony in Santiago del Estero during 
which he called on citizens to vote for the party of their 
liking and not submit blank votes, as blank votes "are of no 
use." 
  The progress made by the center-left coalition Grand Front 
(FG) in the Argentine capital, where surveys place it behind the 
ruling Justicialist Party (Peronist) and ahead of the UCR, has 
been the significant event of the two weeks leading up to the 
election. 
  The FG is headed by Deputy Carlos Alvarez, a dissident 
Peronist who has occupied the most important sections in local 
newspapers over the last few months because according to 
observers, he is the Argentine leader who understands best that 
political campaigns must be carried out in the communications 
media. 
  Over the past few days, Menem and Alfonsin have defended the 
agreement the two leaders signed at the end of 1993 to have a 
project for reforming the Constitution approved by Congress. 
Their remarks were aimed at accusations made by other parties' 
candidates that "the pact" was signed behind the people's back. 
  The Peronists and Radicals association opened a deep breach 
between them and the other political groups which are also 
fighting for votes. 
  Jesus Rodriguez, who is in first place on the UCR ticket for 
the capital, said "people know the UCR alone can control Menem's 
growing power," and called on citizens "to concentrate votes for 
the opposition." 
  Fernando "Pino" Solanas, Argentine actor and candidate for 
the FG, proposed the election of Neuquen's emeritus bishop, 
Monsignor Jaime de Nevares, as Constituent Assembly president. 
De Nevares left his provincial diocese when he turned 75, at the 
beginning of the year. He will be the main speaker today at the 
FG campaign closing act in a Buenos Aires theater. The prelate 
was one of the few leaders who maintained a critical position 
against the political repression unleashed by the military 
regime (1976-83). He has also criticized the market economy 
system Menem adopted ever since he came to power in 1989.

  [Text] (NA-DYN) -- Yesterday, Economy Minister Domingo 
Cavallo said there was no possibility of him resigning while at 
the same time denying that the peso would be devalued and 
recessive policies would be applied to increase exports. He did 
say, however, that to achieve this the current consumption rate 
should be reduced. 
  Speaking at the American Club yesterday to a group of 
businessmen, Cavallo said he does not foresee President Carlos 
Menem asking for his resignation in the near future. He also 
added: "I am not thinking about resigning, I will carry on for a 
long time, I hope." 
  He repeated, however, that should this event take place 
"there will surely by an economic team as good if not better 
than the present one." Cavallo even went one step further and 
added that "if, for example, the Radical Party win the next 
elections, they will not do what (Raul) Alfonsin tells them, 
rather they will field a much better team than us and manage the 
economy just as we are doing." 
  Cavallo insisted that "one day" he would "cease to be a 
minister" but "there would be no discontinuity in President 
Carlos Menem's administration." Continuing on this issue he 
said: "President Menem's government will probably continue until 
1999 and he guessed that "I will probably continue at the head 
of this Ministry. If I were not here or were only heading a 
partial Ministry, then whoever replaced me would not stop the 
work being done or propose a different team, but would complete 
the reorganization task," Cavallo added. 
  Cavallo also said that now that the US economy is picking up 
those dollars that are not injected into the capital markets 
"should be obtained in exchange for our exports." He said that 
recessionary measures or a devaluation are not the way to 
increase production, rather investments," Cavallo added. 
  Cavallo also admitted that to encourage exports, "more 
favourable relative prices are needed than there have been in 
the last three years." He pointed out that these will be 
achieved by "working on the service prices, all production 
costs, and the tax systems that distort companies expenses." 
  During his speech Cavallo lashed out at Bolsa Stock Exchange 
President Jorge Berrardi his "lack of professionalism and 
seriousness in the statements he made. Berrardi had criticized 
the 3.75-percent commission the banks charged in the repurchase 
of YPF shares as excessive. "With these sort of opinions, how 
are we going to have a stable market?" Cavallo wondered.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities monitored through 7 April. 
  Tax collection in March fell 4 percent with respect to 
February, and 3.7 percent with respect to the estimate for the 
month. Official sources state that 3.57 billion pesos was the 
target, while only 3.44 billion were received. This sum is 
nevertheless 11.2 percent above the figure for March 1993. 
(Buenos Aires BUENOS AIRES HERALD in English 5 Apr 94 p 5) 
  The government's railway privatization policy picked up 
steam 
on 1 April, when the Belgrano Norte and San Martin metropolitan 
rail services were handed over to their new operators. The 
Belgrano Norte line was handed over to Ferrovias SAC, which will 
run the railway for the next 10 years. Ferrovias will be 
receiving government subsidies of $150 million over the life of 
the concession to make new investments. 
  The San Martin line will be run by the Transportes 
Metropolitanos Gral San Martin SA consortium (TMS). The new 
operators will have to invest $70 million during the 10-year 
concession with government subsidies of $10.9 million. (Buenos 
Aires BUENOS AIRES HERALD in English 2 Apr 94 p 5) 
  The World Bank and the Economy Ministry signed loan 
agreements for $3.3 billion covering the next three years. The 
loans will cover food, child education, reform of the provincial 
economies, and the environment. According to Economy Ministry 
sources, $800 million will be spent on bringing the provincial 
economies up to date, and $750 million for education and rural 
poverty plans. The funds will be administered by the World 
Bank. (Buenos Aires BUENOS AIRES HERALD in English 2 Apr 94 p 5) 
  According to data disclosed today by the National Institute 
of Statistics and Census, the Consumer Price Index was up by 0.1 
percent in March, while wholesale prices and construction costs 
rose by 0.2 percent. Retail prices have edged up by 5.2 percent 
over the last 12 months. Accrued inflation since the Argentine 
peso was pegged to the U.S. dollar is 53.2 percent. (Buenos

  [Text] Chilean Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa has stated 
that Chile seeks to strengthen its bilateral ties with the 
United States; and, within this framework, negotiating a free 
trade agreement is a priority issue for the Chilean Government. 
He added that an inter-ministerial team will be established to 
negotiate a bilateral treaty or Chile's inclusion in NAFTA. Here 
is a report by Carmen Castro: 
  [Begin Castro recording] Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa 
said the Chilean Government seeks to consolidate its ties with 
the United States at all levels. Figueroa said the Chilean 
Government's overall foreign policy guidelines grant particular 
importance to the strengthening of its ties with neighboring 
countries, the United States, and Asia. 
  Within this framework and on the basis of the new 
international order, Carlos Figueroa stated that Chilean policy 
toward Latin America should be fully compatible with a greater 
insertion in North American markets. 
  According to Carlos Figueroa, the Chilean Government grants 
great importance to negotiating a free trade agreement with the 
United States at either the bilateral level or within the 
framework of NAFTA, an alternative which is being deeply studied 
at the Foreign Ministry. He said there is an imperative need to 
establish a solid interministerial negotiating team that will 
act in a coordinated and coherent manner to this effect. 
  Carlos Figueroa also stated Chile faces the challenge of 
consolidating its bilateral ties with the Untied States at all 
levels. Figueroa said the strengthening of Chilean-U.S. ties is 
not restricted to negotiating a free trade agreement but 
includes other important issues like the defense of democracy, 
the nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the 
struggle against trafficking, the insertion of Chile among the 
Pacific rim countries, and other multilateral issues. Figueroa 
stated that, beside constituting relevant issues by themselves, 
the latter may have a considerable influence on Chile's ability 
to negotiate the free trade agreement. 
  Figueroa said Europe continues to be a relevant area for 
Chilean foreign policy but he placed a special emphasis on Asia. 
Figueroa said an opening within the Asian-Pacific region 
constitutes one of the main focal point of Chilean foreign 
policy. He added that the Pacific Basin is undoubtedly one of 
the most important international scenarios of the future. This 
region encompasses over 40 interrelated countries, with a 
population surpassing 2.5 billion and an economic power 
concentrating over half of the World's production. Figueroa 
stated that the Asian-Pacific region has experienced the 
greatest economic growth and has achieved the greatest economic 
dynamism over the past few decades. The economies of 
Pacific-rim countries, he stressed, have played a key role in 
inserting Chile in the new international scenario. [end

  [Excerpts] Yesterday, Chile became the second country of 
the Americas, after the United States, to export fruit to China. 
The Agricultural and Livestock Service (SAG) signed a plant 
health agreement with the PRC Agriculture Ministry National 
Animal and Plant Quarantine Service which opens the Chinese 
market to Chilean fruit. Exports will include apples and kiwi 
fruit grown in the sixth and ninth region where the fruit fly 
has never been reported. 
  The signing ceremony was attended by the PRC ambassador to 
Chile and Agriculture Under Secretary Alejandro Gutierrez. The 
agreement was described as a major step toward opening the 
market to Chilean fruit. A PRC agricultural technical mission 
has been in Chile since 14 March and the agreement was concluded 
after two weeks of talks. [passage omitted] 
  Gutierrez said "Sino-Chilean trade has grown to $400 
million. 
This is proof of the purchasing power of the Chinese market, 
which consists of 1.2 billion people whose income is rapidly 
increasing." He added that the agreement stems from the 
fruitful relations existing between the two countries and from a 
trade agreement signed by the two countries in 1990 during the 
visit of then President Patricio Aylwin. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Cony Stipicic] </F>
  [Text] The subject of the FBI in our country has become 
nearly as untouchable as its detectives were years ago. The news 
that Chile had asked the United States to open an FBI liaison 
office in Chile caused considerable impact last year. The debate 
extended to many sectors. Politicians, police, and government 
officials spoke about the controversial subject. Some people 
even qualified the initiative as interference in Chilean 
domestic affairs. It is said that Washington was surprised by 
this reaction and preferred not to touch the subject in public 
in order not to continue creating a flurry. 
  The problem is that nowadays, no one or very few people know 
what will happen with this initiative. Before leaving, the 
Patricio Aylwin administration said everything was status quo 
and opening a FBI office depended on the dedication of a new 
U.S. Embassy building. The current administration has not made a 
decision yet on the matter but everything indicates that it will 
stay the same. That is, the FBI will come. 
  Neither Carabineros nor the Investigative Police have 
coordinated meetings yet with the eventual "liaison" officers, 
even though they will be work colleagues. Meanwhile, the U.S. 
Embassy is totally silent on the subject. "There is nothing 
new," is all they say. And when one tells the Embassy that we 
are not asking for news but for the date when the new Embassy 
building will be ready, all the Embassy answers is that it 
probably will be ready by the middle of next year, without 
further details. 
  Something more concrete, however, was learned. The FBI 
already has assigned the "individual" who will work in the 
office that will be opened in Santiago. It will be only one 
agent. There will not be two, three, or four agents like it was 
once said. Unofficially, it was revealed that the number of 
agents interested in being transferred to Santiago was far 
greater than expected, something that had not happened in a long 
time in an American institution. 
  The U.S. State Department and the Chilean Interior Ministry 
still must take some joint steps. Apparently, the two 
institutions have not discussed the subject lately, after it was 
announced by former Minister Enrique Krauss on 16 July 1993. 
  As vice president of the Republic, Krauss then said the 
purpose of asking for the opening of an FBI office in Chile was 
only to strengthen cooperation between the Chilean forces of 
order and the FBI in the struggle against international crime. 
<H5>  Maximum Alert </H5>
  One of the people who expressed a warning on the subject 
noted that Chile is becoming -- due to its economic development 
-- an attractive country for international traffickers and other 
types of criminals. This would make it necessary to reinforce 
the Chilean police by increasing its operational capability 
instead of creating a situation that would demand the 
participation of foreign agents. But this will not be the case 
because the U.S. agents will not have any power to operate. The 
Chilean law, like those in every other country of the world, 
prevents foreign agents from operating in territory other than 
their own country. Their task, therefore, will be merely to 
exchange information in addition to granting technical and 
academic support. 
  There were also protests from those who feared the fact 
would 
be misinterpreted by Chilean police in the sense that FBI agents 
were being brought to Chile because things were not being done 
properly here. While some politicians tried to minimize the 
issue, others tried to explain the government's true purpose to 
the Chilean people: That it did not aspire to have agents with 
operational capability in Chile; that the idea was to have an 
FBI agent who would allow for a more fluid and expeditious 
relationship between the security forces; that bringing an FBI 
agent did not represent interference in domestic affairs; and 
that by no means did it reveal a government weakness in its 
struggle against drug trafficking. 
  Everything boiled down to a mere discussion until a group of 
National Renewal legislators decided to ask the government to 
withdraw its invitation to the FBI. They argued that the 
initiative violated the law currently in force and national 
sovereignty because, according to the Constitution, Carabineros 
and the Investigative Police are in charge of safeguarding 
domestic order. 
  The government was indignant and Krauss said it was "great 
insolence" to believe that the Chilean Government and police 
institutions could be manipulated by foreign interests. 
  But those directly affected were barely consulted on the 
subject. Carabineros, through Director General Rodolfo Stange, 
at first reacted negatively, although in an indirect manner. A 
few days later, however, Carabineros suggested it might view 
this initiative as positive for cooperation in the police field. 
Carabineros, though, still has not disclosed its official 
stance on the issue. 
  The opinions within this force are varied. A Carabineros 
source stated those who are against the idea or choose not to 
state their opinion do so because they are not fully aware of 
the effect that a liaison with the FBI in Chile may have. 
Carabineros believe this difference of opinions is positive. 
The same person made an interesting comment: The FBI office in 
Santiago will not be autonomous; it will be subject to the U.S. 
Embassy. It will, in fact, be located in the Embassy building. 
  He also asserted that it is merely another of the 21 
officies 
the FBI already has throughout the world, which is also the case 
of the Chilean Armed and security forces. Carabineros has 
attaches in some embassies, like in Spain, Colombia, the United 
States, and Costa Rica, as well as missions stationed in El 
Salvador and Ecuador, among other countries. 
<H5>  Between Doubts and Advantages </H5>
  The Investigative Police has voiced its full support for the 
initiative. The thing is that its agents, for some time now, 
have maintained a cooperative relationship with the FBI office 
in Montevideo, which is in charge of coordinating actions in the 
Southern Cone. The FBI has four agents in Montevideo. But the 
distance, although short, causes certain inconveniences. The 
relationship is not as fluid as it should be. 
  Carlos Espinoza, administrative chief of the Santiago 
Interpol National Headquarters, said one must admit that the FBI 
is in the vanguard of technological developments and this is 
highly positive for the development of criminal investigations 
carried out by Chilean agents. Espinoza said: "If we reach a 
point in our investigations at which our resources prevent us 
from going any further, as has been the case, there are our FBI 
friends who, somehow or other, can help us complete our work." 
He added: "They have more technology than we do, but our human 
resources, the quality of our professionals, are good. When 
they need something they get it done properly and in time." 
  Carabineros also offers human resources. Their offer, 
however, is less specific than the offer of the Investigative 
Police, dedicated mainly to criminal matters. Carabineros has a 
greater choice of professionals. 
  They also point out their viewpoint of another social 
situation, in addition to their experience in confronting other 
social phenomenons in the crime field also applicable in the 
United States. This is the case of the struggle against 
delinquency in the capital's outskirts, also applicable to the 
actions carried out in the United States in neighborhoods or 
areas where different ethnic groups are gathered. 
  There are coincidences on the reasons why the United States 
may have so readily accepted the Chilean Government request to 
install an FBI office here. Basically, they refer to the degree 
of economic development reached by Chile, which makes it 
increasingly vulnerable to the much-talked-about 
"internationalization of crime." In other words, that important 
foreign delinquents increasingly choose Chile in which to commit 
their crimes or hide. 
  In view of this situation and the globalization phenomenon 
the world is experiencing in all fields of action, few see the 
purpose of denying the existence of a liaison with U.S. police 
in Chile. A person linked to this issue commented: "We cannot 
close our borders if there is a tendency toward rapprochement 
and international police cooperation throughout the world," and 
added, "why would we hesitate before crime if it can only be 
fought by working." 
  There are some who believe one must suspect the U.S. 
attitude 
to readily accept the request. Some believe that "the gringos 
do nothing for free." But others believe there is nothing wrong 
with that. Police forces believe Chile also has done the right 
thing. Although many may say the benefits are shared, it is true 
that Chile will benefit even more.

  [Excerpt] The government has stated that Carabineros 
Director General Rodolfo Stange is morally incapable of 
exercising his duties because of Judge Juica's ruling on the 
slain communist leaders. The following is a live relay by 
Reporter Jose Miguel Alfaro from Government House: 
  [Alfaro] President Frei's decision to summon General Rodolfo 
Stange to suggest his retirement from the Carabineros was the 
main issue discussed by Frei during today's cabinet meeting. We 
have the following report on this issue: 
  During the two-hour cabinet meeting the president informed 
his immediate advisers about the arguments he raised before the 
Carabineros director general. 
  Victor Manuel Rebolledo, minister general secretary of the 
government, explained that President Frei is not arguing about 
petty issues, but defending basic moral issues. 
  [Begin Rebolledo recording] What the government and the 
president have specified is that although General Stange has not 
been indicted and no sentence has been issued, the fact that he 
is being questioned virtually morally incapacitates him from 
adequately fulfilling his duties as Carabineros director 
general. Consequently, the Carabineros are impeded from properly 
fulfilling those duties established by the Constitution and the 
laws, and which all Chilean citizens expect to be fulfilled. 
[end recording] 
  Rebolledo said there is tension between the government and 
Gen. Stange, but not an institutional crisis. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Rio de Janeiro District Attorney Antonio Carlos 
Biscaia has released an official list of 150 people charged with 
receivding bribes from numbers game operators. Former President 
Fernando Collor de Mello and Sao Paulo Mayor Paulo Maluf are on 
the list. [passage omitted] 
  In addition to Collor and Maluf, the list includes Rio de 
Janeiro Governor Nilo Batista and Deputy Cleto Falcao. Next to 
the names of Collor and Maluf are entries indicating that they 
received donations to their 1989 electoral campaign. There are 
also documents indicating that donations were made for a rally 
of then-candidate Paulo Maluf in Rio de Janeiro. 
  Sao Paulo Mayor Paulo Maluf has denied the charge that the 
numbers game operators made donations to his electoral campaign. 
He vowed to press charges against Biscaia. 
  [Begin Maluf recording] This is an individual who is 
hysterically trying to get into the limelight. He is just an 
impetuous, irresponsible rascal, and he is lying. I have never 
received any help from anyone. I have put the case in the hands 
of criminal lawyer Enio de Bastos Barros, who will bring this 
irresponsible individual to court. [end recording] 
  Collor also issued a statement denying he received any 
donations to his campaign from kingpins of the numbers game. 
The former president contends that he fought the numbers game 
during his tenure as governor of Alagoas State. He adds that he 
was already found not guilty in the investigation of his 
accounts during the impeachment process. He concludes by 
stating that his executioners have already testified to the fact 
that he has never received one cent from the illegal game he 
tenaciously fought as governor. [passage omitted] 
  Federal prosecutors who are participating in the Rio de 
Janeiro district attorney's investigations are increasingly 
convinced that the numbers game was nothing but a front for more 
lucrative businesses, such as arms smuggling and the 
international drug trade. 
  The prosecutors were quite impressed by the volume of 
transactions maintained by numbers game operators with some 
South American countries, such as the ties numbers game kingpin 
Rodomiro Garcia maintained with one of the most notorious 
Paraguayan smugglers, [Governor of Alto Parana Department] 
Carlos Barreto Sarubbi. 
  Rodomiro Garcia and Barreto Sarubbi own a casino in Ciudad 
del Este, Paraguay, across the border from Foz do Iguacu. 
Garcia also owns a large estate in Paraguay, approximately 10 
km from the Brazilian border. Barreto owns an airstrip. He has 
been charged by U.S. police with having used the airstrip for 
many years for arms smuggling and drug trafficking operations.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities monitored through 7 April. 
  The increase in interest rates on the U.S. market, and the 
expectations that this rate will continue to grow, has prompted 
foreign investors to withdraw approximately $1 billion from the 
Brazilian stock market in one week. The decision has also 
affected the Brazilian foreign debt, as higher interest will 
make debt certificates more expensive. (Sao Paulo FOLHA DE SAO 
PAULO in Portuguese 5 Apr 94 Section 2 p 1) 
  The Sao Paulo stock market yesterday registered its sharpest 
drop of the year (10.5 percent), with losses estimated at 
between $12 and $16.5 billion. This drop was prompted by a U.S. 
Federal Reserve decision to increase interest rates. According 
to Citibank, on 29 March the stock market value stood at $132 
billion, a loss of $16.5 billion. Fibra Bank director Julio 
Krauspenhar estimated the loss at $12 billion. (Sao Paulo O 
ESTADO DE SAO PAULO in Portuguese 5 Apr 94 p B3) 
  The Sao Paulo State Federation of Industries, FIESP, and the 
Sao Paulo State Industries Center has reported that the Sao 
Paulo industrial activity level dropped by 1.5 percent in 
February in comparison with January. Industrial activity in 
February has nonetheless increased by 3.6 percent in comparison 
with the same month last year. The use of installed industrial 
capacity climbed from 75.1 percent in January to 75.3 percent in 
February. Meanwhile, real sales of electric-electronic and 
communications materials increased by 65.7 percent, mechanical 
capital goods and agricultural machinery sales increased by 15.2 
percent, car industry sales increased by 11.7 percent, furniture 
sales increased 9.6 percent, and metalworks sales by 9.5 percent 
in January 1994 in comparison with January 1993. In all, sales 
of Sao Paulo industry dropped in February by 0.4 percent in 
comparison with the previous month, which is still 4.6 percent 
more than the sales registered in February 1993. The hours 
worked in February in the industry sector dropped by 1.5 percent 
in comparison with January, and the average real salary 
increased by 3.9 percent, while the salary mass increased by 1.6 
percent on real terms. (Sao Paulo GAZETA MERCANTIL in

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 6 Apr (EFE) -- Today, the 
Colombian Prosecutor General's Office rejected charges made by 
the U.S. State Department that the Cali Cartel has infiltrated 
the Colombian Government. 
  On 4 April, the State Department published its annual report 
on its global strategy to fight drugs. With regard to Colombia, 
the report states among other things that the mafia "still 
manipulates the judicial system through intimidation and 
bribery." 
  Deputy Prosecutor General Francisco Jose Sintura denied this 
allegation, saying that arrests, sentences, confiscations, and 
seizures prove the opposite is true. "Such generalities are 
unacceptable," Sintura stressed in a news release. 
  Noting the achievements made by the Prosecutor General's 
Office, Sintura said it is not clear to whom the report refers 
as a "fourth-level member of the (Colombian) Prosecutor 
General's Office who is under investigation for his alleged 
links to the Cali Cartel." 
  The news release says that in 1993, "Colombia extradited an 
alleged Argentine drug trafficker to the United States, and in 
1994 extradited four citizens of other nationalities. In 
addition, seven others whose extradition was requested by the 
United States were arrested, and those cases are currently 
moving through the legal process." 
  Sintura adds that as a result of the fight against drug 
trafficking, 40 people linked to this crime surrendered, 30 were 
arrested, and 23 were killed in clashes with the authorities. 
The news release stresses that all of these people were 
"members of drug trafficking organizations, and not common 
criminals." Sintura's report adds that "17 top leaders of these 
organizations have received sentences of 10-24 years in jail."

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Reporters were highly 
interested in the current leadership of Cuba and the future 
successor to Cuban President Fidel Castro. In response to this, 
Robaina stated that for a long time, every Cuban generation has 
participated in the People's Government, adding: We do not need 
to worry about a replacement for Fidel because Fidel, together 
with the Cuban people, the youth, and the not so young, is part 
of a project of development and change. 
  Other issues, like The Nation and the Emigre Community 
conference; the new impetus of Cuba's foreign policy; and 
Havana's possibilities for paying its debt to Montevideo were 
discussed by Robaina at this news conference, which concluded 
just minutes ago.

  [Text] Lima, 6 Apr (EFE) -- Today, the Freedom and 
Democracy Institute of Peru (ILD) submitted a proposal to 
Congress to amend the 1993 Constitution. The proposal, which 
was signed by 500,000 people, is based on the people's 
constitutional right to initiate laws. ILD President Hernando De 
Soto, who is a former adviser of President Alberto Fujimori, 
reported that the proposal contains 12 amendments "that seek to 
make governments listen to the people and to prevent the market 
economy from becoming a privilege of a few." 
  One amendment proposes the establishment of a "democratic 
procedure for popular consultation to decentralize the 
government's decisionmaking power" so that the executive branch 
will no longer exclusively make decisions "on every subject 
without listening to the opinion of the Peruvian people." Other 
proposed amendments deal with the creation of multiple electoral 
districts in lieu of the current single district system "so that 
elected officials may be held directly accountable to their 
constituents" and to make the constitutional right to cancel 
terms in office applicable to all political representatives and 
officials. 
  De Soto said that during the 5 April 1992 coup, President 
Fujimori said he took that extreme measure, among other reasons, 
to democratize political power through a constitutional reform. 
De Soto contended that Fujimori has not fulfilled his promise 
because the new Constitution has incorporated "only half" of the 
changes he promised. Therefore, he said, the ILD has availed 
itself of the people's right to initiate amendments to the 
Peruvian Constitution. The Peruvian Constitution recognizes this 
right of the people, "but only to a certain extent," De Soto 
said, "because it is the Congress, not the people, that has the 
power to approve or reject the proposal."

  [Text] PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] deputies, 
senators, and assembly members have affirmed their total support 
for PRI presidential candidate Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon. 
Thanking them for their support, Zedillo said he favored honest 
elections and respect for the citizen's vote. 
  [Begin Zedillo recording] As the PRI's presidential 
candidate, I promise to respect the electoral law reliablely and 
honestly. Today I confirm, before my party colleagues and the 
entire nation, that I will assume each and every one of my 
party's commitments in favor of electoral democracy. [end 
recording] 
  Zedillo reiterated he will not accept any illicit votes and 
demanded that there be an external audit of the electoral 
register. He said he will heed the decisions, reached by 
consensus, on the presence of foreign visitors at the elections. 
  The PRI candidate said he is prepared to debate other 
presidential candidates and added that PRI members do not fear 
democracy. Zedillo observed that lasting economic progress and 
social improvement can only be achieved in a democratic system. 
  At the meeting with the legislators, candidate Zedillo 
appointed new PRI Secretary General Ignacio Pichardo Pagaza as 
the general coordinator of his political campaign. 
  Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon also met with CTM 
[Confederation of Mexican Workers] leaders and promised to 
defend the workers' rights. He said he will allow changes to 
the labor law that will benefit Mexican workers and added that 
their benefits will not be withdrawn. 
  [Begin Zedillo recording] The time has come for wages to 
improve in Mexico. We can do this without risking the stability 
that has cost us so much. We will do it by improving 
productivity and making sure the benefits that result from this 
productivity end up in the Mexican workers' pockets. [end 
recording] 
  As he arrived and when he left the CTM auditorium, the PRI 
candidate hailed all PRI members gathered there.

<F P=106> [Report by Abraham Ardon for "The Morning Newspaper" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] First Congress Vice President Jorge Arturo Reina 
returned from Cuba amid constant announcements about his return 
to the legislative branch. The president's brother announced he 
will carefully study the recently implemented economic measures 
before commenting on the issue. He said, however, these measures 
are undesirable and unpleasant because they negatively affect 
the majority of the Honduran people. Despite this, the 
congressman explained, the political slogan "Power to the 
people" is still valid, adding that some measures are 
unavoidable given the country's economic situation. 
  [Begin recording] [Reina] I want to tell you I have yet to 
talk with anyone in the economic cabinet about this issue. That 
is why I would rather say nothing right now. I will talk with 
some of them today, however, and I will be pleased to discuss 
the issue tomorrow. 
  [Ardon] Dr. Reina, what happened to the slogan "Power to the 
people"? 
  [Reina] It is still in effect. What happens is that we found 
an extremely serious economic situation. I have learned about 
the economic cabinet's analysis. It said the situation is so 
acute the country is headed for a collapse if no financing is 
found and if fuel consumption is not restricted. Consequently, 
certain measures are unwanted and undesirable for everyone, but 
they are absolutely essential. The magnitude and duration of 
those measures is another problem. 
  [Ardon] What about the human side mentioned in the campaign, 
Dr. Jorge Arturo Reina? 
  [Reina] I do not know. I do not know. Frankly, I cannot 
provide an answer because, like I said a few minutes ago, I have 
yet to talk to the economic cabinet. I would rather not comment. 
  [Ardon] There is already talk about the implementation of 
further economic measures, Dr. Reina. What is your opinion? 
  [Reina] I believe the measures should not continue. 
Something should be done to prevent those measures because the 
essential goal is to help the vast majority of the population 
and seek the legal, juridical, and financial mechanisms that 
allow us to help the vast majority of the Honduran people. That 
is the main goal of this government. 
  [Ardon] Dr. Reina, the trips made by the previous 
government's officials were criticized. How do you explain your 
trip to Cuba? 
  [Reina] Not a single cent of the Honduran Government's money 
was spent. Not a single cent. 
  [Ardon] Dr. Reina, did you talk with Commander Fidel Castro 
in the island of Cuba? Also, who issued the invitation? 
  [Reina] [Words indistinct] invitation and the minister of 
tourism visited Honduras some time ago, and he invited us to see 
the status of their plans to develop tourism in Cuba. Frankly, 
they are spectacular. Frankly, they are spectacular. I had no 
idea they could be done in this magnitude. 
  [Ardon] Dr. Reina, your participation in the legislative 
branch has been questioned because you do not frequently attend 
its sessions. 
  [Reina] I already said I would return to the National 
Congress after Holy Week -- and here I am, ready to work full 
time. I will always be willing to cooperate with the Executive 
Branch. [end recording]

<F P=106> [News conference by National Congress President Marco </F>
Vinicio Villar Anleu with unidentified reporters; place and date 
not given; from the "Telepress" newscast -- recorded] 
  [Text] Deputy Obdulio Chinchilla Vega remains hospitalized 
after he was the victim of an attack on 6 April. Reports from El 
Peten Department indicate that the controversial congressman was 
to be proclaimed presidential candidate next Saturday at a 
meeting of the 12 organizations affiliated with the 
Revolutionary Party in that department. 
  Today there were more reactions to the attack. Here is 
National Congress President Marco Vinicio Villar Anleu, who 
commented on the subject with reporters. 
  [Villar] The Board of Directors has no knowledge of death 
threats against any deputy or against Deputy Obdulio Chinchilla 
Vega in particular. We only know what has been reported about 
the attack on Deputy Obdulio Chinchilla Vega and the attack 
yesterday on Deputy Rene Barrios. 
  [Reporter] Will the National Congress Board of Directors 
adopt any special strategy? It is obvious that any deputy can 
be the target of an attack. Will the Board of Directors take 
any special security measures or [words indistinct]? 
  [Villar] Yes, the Congress will take preventive measures to 
protect the deputies and the building where congressional 
meetings are held. It is clear that this was an attack against 
the Congress as an institution, obviously to destabilize the 
country and hinder political activities. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] 
  [Villar] No. Our analysis of the situation has remained 
within Congress. I have clearly said that we will not recommend 
a state of (?emergency). That decision must be made by the 
executive branch. It will depend on the information we receive 
from the ministers summoned by Congress and a meeting we will 
have with the president. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] 
  [Villar] No. They were called upon to inform us of the 
mechanisms, it is not an (?interpellation). 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] health of the two deputies 
[words indistinct]? 
  [Villar] Thank God, we can say that Deputy Obdulio 
Chinchilla Vega, who is currently in a private hospital, is 
clinically out of danger, although his condition is still 
critical. He will be under observation for 72 hours. As for 
Deputy Rene Barrios Samayoa, thank God it was only an attempt to 
kidnap him. He is in perfect health, but he was emotionally and 
psychologically affected. 
  [Reporter] It is said that Deputy Chinchilla Vega knew there 
would be an attack against him and that he met with the defense 
minister and other top government officials the day before the 
attack to inform them. 
  [Villar] We have heard that report. Several deputies and 
even journalists have reported this, but the Board of Directors 
has no official knowledge of that. 
  [Reporter] Deputy, Deputy Rene Barrios reportedly has not 
filed any complaint with the National Police. [Words indistinct] 
  [Villar] We were informed yesterday and at last night's 
meeting with the deputies and the Board of Directors that he 
said he has information about the vehicles used in the 
kidnapping attempt. He said he spoke directly with the president 
and the presidential staff to apprise them of the facts. They 
are aware of the situation. 
  [Reporter] Mr. Congress President, how can it be possible 
that (?Congress has not) said anything about a possible state of 
emergency when the government is waging a campaign in 
Guatemala's [word indistinct] in support of such a measure. 
[Words indistinct] 
  [Villar] Quite simply, the executive branch is authorized to 
call a state of emergency. Congress cannot do it. All Congress 
can do is confirm it if it is officially sent to the 
legislature. I believe that the state of law and constitutional 
order must prevail in such situations and that we should demand 
that the executive branch, which is in charge of public and 
internal security, adopt the necessary urgent measures within 
the framework of the Constitution and existing laws. 
  [Reporter] [Question indistinct] 
  [Villar] No. I have categorically stated that Congress will 
not request a state of emergency. So far Congress has not 
decided to do that. The executive branch has the authority to 
implement such a measure, and the decision will have to come 
from that branch. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] can Congress ask the president 
to impose [words indistinct]. 
  [Villar] That is what I announced at the beginning of the 
news conference. We are going to invite the president and the 
two ministers to a meeting. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] 
  [Villar] In the president's case -- I must be clear about 
this -- in accordance with existing laws, he cannot be summoned 
to Congress or to the plenum. We can, however, extend a cordial 
invitation to him to attend a meeting within the framework of 
the coordination of the branches of state, but always observing 
each branch's independence. 
  [Reporter] Is it true that the secretary general of the 
Christian Democratic Party left the country because of this 
situation? 
  [Villar] I have no official information on that. I spoke to 
him early this morning. He was in the country as of 0830. 
Since then I have been in a meeting with the Board of 
Directors, and I do not have any official information about his 
departure. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] to generate a coup d'etat. 
[words indistinct] 
  [Villar] I had not heard that until you mentioned it, so I 
have no opinion.

<F P=106> [Article by Samuel Blixen] </F>
  [Excerpts] If the promotion to colonel of Tomas Cassella -- 
the intelligence and counterintelligence agent who first 
protected and then abducted Eugenio Berrios, a former Chilean 
Dina [National Intelligence Directorate] agent -- put the six 
legislators who approved his promotion in an awkward position, 
the details of the blackmail case that almost scuttled his 
promotion are producing more embarrassment to judges and 
financial authorities. 
  The misappropriation of accounting information stored in a 
computer and the lieutenant colonel's persuasive techniques to 
further increase his income will not be able to compete with the 
notorious history concealed behind his blackmail. For Cassella, 
the misappropriated information was worth $500,000. This was 
his fair price for not disclosing the deposits made by 
foreigners and the foreign transfers very secretly managed by a 
banking house through two "covert" companies that, in typical 
Argentine fashion, acted as "financial caves" for unholy deals. 
  The blackmail report, filed in a fit of rage by one of the 
people managing the "covert finance companies," upset the 
Central Bank authorities who had done nothing despite ewvidence 
of large-scale money laundering that had been discovered after a 
Social Security Bank [BPS] inspection. 
  Cassella struck a successful deal. The money launderers' 
blackmail was based on the two "covert" companies' requirement 
for secrecy. Cassella figured "it is not a crime to steal from 
a thief." Thus far, he has been able to escape court action 
and, furthermore, be promoted in his professional career. 
[passage omitted] 
  A more careful review revealed that the two "covert" 
companies, Relmon, Inc. and Urafix, Inc., were actually part of 
an economic team. In a nutshell, they were linked to a banking 
house established in Buenos Aires and Montevideo. Recently, 
this banking house has been attempting, unsuccessfully, to 
obtain a banking license. Behind Relmon and Urafix appeared 
Exprinter International Corporation [preceding three words in 
English], the main concern grouping the Exprinter Banking House 
and the Exprinter Tourism company in Uruguay and linked to the 
Bunge y Born group and the Deutsche Bank in Argentina. 
Therefore, the inspectors collected evidence on the existence 
of "financial caves," a reality that "everyone" but the Central 
Bank "is aware of." [passage omitted] 
  A typical Uruguayan solution, at least for this Uruguayan 
fiscal haven, was implemented. The BPS debt was accepted 
without a word, to prevent the closing of the banking house and 
the affiliate companies. The criminal report was withdrawn by 
the injured people and the judge expressed reasonable doubt on 
the method to be pursued in this strange case. On 16 March 
alone, the judge sent the dossier to the prosecutor. The judge, 
however, sent it to the wrong prosecutor's office. Therefore, 
court proceedings began last week to determine the actions to be 
taken on the blackmail report, as this is a crime that is being 
officially (that is, beyond the injured people's will) 
investigated when the injured people strongly recant. 
  After this stormy summer season ended, Lt. Col. Cassella was 
promoted to colonel. It was not reported if he finally managed 
to collect the $500,000, but his representatives claim they 
reached a "settlement between the parties." 
  The measures taken by the Central Bank, which is supposed to 
control financial activities, also were not reported. The BPS 
inspection and the blackmail episode exposed the money 
laundering operations in Relmon and Urafix. The money launderers 
will consider that Montevideo no longer represents a safe center 
because the "controls" that the state does not implement 
actually are implemented by the personal initiative of gangs of 
blackmailers dressed in uniform. It is no longer possible to 
trust anything.

<F P=106> [Report by Luis Orellana from the "Notivision" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Jose Maria Monterrey, director of the National 
Civilian Police [PNC], has said he expects the U.S. Embassy to 
publish a report on the death of Lieutenant Colonel Julio Ramon 
Rivera, a member of the U.S. Armed Forces. [Words indistinct] 
his police organization already issued an initial report on the 
incident based on results of an autopsy conducted on the body of 
the U.S. soldier. 
  [Begin Monterrey recording] U.S. investigators are here to 
collect as much information as possible. We will now wait 
because we already issued our report. The decision of what to 
do is now in their hands. [end recording] 
  Last Wednesday Robert Adams, chief of investigations of the 
Southern Command, which is headquarted in Panama, [words 
indistinct] commentaries on the incident after requesting the 
respective analyses from the Legal Medicine Institute. Julio 
Ramon Rivera died early last Sunday after he detonated a 
fragmentation grenade while under the influence of drugs. The 
explosion seriously injured three PNC agents. They should be 
compensated because they will not be able to work normally, 
Monterrey pointed out: 
  [Begin recording] [Monterrey, in progress] ...collaborators 
of justice. We can only do so much, but we cannot go beyond our 
limits. The justice system [words indistinct] or the Foreign 
Ministry. 
  [Reporter] [words indistinct] 
  [Monterrey] Yes, we talked yesterday with our Legal 
Department. I requested an appointment with the ambassador on 
Friday to talk about that. I think this will move ahead. 
Yesterday, a U.S. Embassy official afternoon [words indistinct] 
with me. We think that this is on the right track. [end 
recording] 
  Jose Maria Monterrey rejected claims from Rivera's relatives 
who said the U.S. soldier had not consumed drugs, as confirmed 
by the director of the Legal Medicine Institute, who based his 
opinion on an autopsy conducted by Salvadoran forensic surgeons.

<F P=106> [Report by Eduardo Estrella Baltodano from the "Cosmovision" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] A few minutes ago, a special meeting was held 
between National Assembly President Luis Humberto Guzman and 
Sandinist People's Army [EPS] Chief General Humberto Ortega 
Saavedra. After the meeting, Gen. Ortega said various issues 
had been discussed, including the country's pacification, 
security for the Nicaraguan people, and the military 
organization law. 
  Addressing local and international reporters, Gen. Ortega 
reiterated that he will not step down under pressure from the 
United States or because of anyone's whim. Gen. Ortega Saavedra 
said: 
  [Begin Ortega recording] The problem is not whether Humberto 
Ortega leaves the Army. That is not Nicaragua's problem. The 
problem is whether I am capable of bequeathing to Nicaragua the 
Army it has never traditionally had. The problem is that 
Humberto Ortega will not leave the Army because of what happened 
on (?2) September, which resulted from pressure from the United 
States and from whimsy. Neither Humberto Ortega nor anyone else 
will ever leave this Army within that context. 
  The problem is not whether Humberto Ortega leaves but how he 
leaves. We are capable of providing the country with a 
military law that will consolidate this Army as the nation's 
Army, an Army with a pledge to defend national sovereignty and 
safeguard the security of all Nicaraguans regardless of their 
race, religious creed, or political affiliation. To this end, I 
believe that to insist that the problem is whether or not 
Humberto Ortega steps down this year would be to view the issue 
quite superficially. 
  I must state clearly that I will never leave this Army, nor 
will the Army allow it -- it is a matter of dignity and 
principles -- under the conditions that were raised on 2 
September. I will never retire under such conditions. 
  This not mean that I am trying to enthrone myself or that I 
want to remain here forever. That is not the case. My 
departure should not result from pressures; it should be the 
result of a decision among Nicaraguans regarding what is the 
most advantageous thing to do within the framework of the law 
and the framework of dignity; it must not be the result of 
pressure, let alone pressure from foreigners. [end recording]

budget shortfalls. As is already known, the Global Plan was 
formulated by the Defense Ministry a few months after the 
unfortunate 4 February and 27 November 1992 incidents. The 
objective of this plan was -- and continues to be -- to improve 
the military's standard of living, enhance benefit quality, 
strengthen the programs that would finance the plan, and widen 
the coverage and design new programs to protect the entire FAN 
[National Armed Forces] population. These specific objectives, 
however, according to the military source, will not be 
implemented because of the serious fiscal deficit that is 
hampering the Armed Forces' capital requirements. 
  During the administration of then Defense Minister General 
Ivan Dario Jimenez Sanchez, the plan was encouraged in order to 
meet the general objective of offering welfare and security to 
FAN military and civilian personnel. The plan itself was 
designed by taking into account issues like health, housing, 
recreation, socioeconomic support, social security, sports, 
education, and culture and to include other related issues that 
would ensure as many "benefits as possible" to all FAN 
personnel. At any rate, under the administration of Gen. Angel 
Rafael Montero Revette it has become necessary to reschedule the 
plan. The fiscal deficit would seem to be the stumbling block 
to welfare and social security benefits since it unfortunately 
hampers several of the programs which had been allocated until 
1995, the date selected to implement the plan. 
  The Defense Ministry spokesman indicated that after 
analyzing 
the socioeconomic situation of military personnel, including 
those civilians working for the military, it was concluded that 
the FAN personnel's social securuty and welfare in general is 
inadequate. This is especially true in health care, housing, and 
recreation, where there is a need for more money. In principle, 
the plan stipulated the need for 18 billion bolivares. This 
amount would be divided as follows: 37 percent to health issues, 
40 percent to housing, and 9 percent to recreation. On the 
other hand, the plan would be divided into three parts based on 
how it would be financed: A Global Investment Plan to be 
implemented by means of additional financial investments 
procured through a Public Credit Law and a contingency budget 
prompted by the aforementioned Investment Plan, the financing of 
which would be done through ordinary budget stipulations. In 
addition, financially quantifiable measures are clearly needed 
in order to reinforce decisions made in the two previous plans. 
  The military spokesman concludes by indicating that the 
strategies of the Global Plan, which have so far been more 
theoretical than practical, are aimed at achieving the 
implementation of the welfare and social security system, 
accomplishing and consolidating the development of social 
policies through legal, institutional, and financial mechanisms 
and procedures in order to provide administrative consistency 
and coherence to the social programs. It also seeks to 
encourage the active participation of all social sectors, draft 
systematic and balanced programs to continuously improve health 
care, housing, education, culture and recreation, sports, social 
welfare, as well as socioeconomic support.

<F P=106> [Article by Geneva Correspondent Ana Fernandez] </F>
  [Excerpts] A bilateral agreement was signed yesterday 
between Chile and the European Union (EU) on the controversy 
over Chile's exports of apples and other fruits. The move ends 
a year of anxiety and negotiations. The initial bilateral 
negotiation was followed by others within the GATT, where a 
panel was set up after the EU imposed countervailing duties in 
April 1993. 
  Ernesto Tironi, the Chilean Ambassador to Geneva who 
receives 
the kudos for this agreement, labeled this process as 
"laborious" and told EL MERCURIO that it entailed a race against 
time. "The agreement was ready on 8 March and it was practically 
closed on 17 March," he added. 
  He explained that the agreement entails both a change in the 
way the EU calculates the countervailing duties and a reduction 
in EU tariffs on Chilean apples and other fruits. In exchange 
for this, Chile suspended its protest before the GATT which had 
established a panel presided by Swedish Ambassador to GATT 
Christer Manhusen and included representatives of Mexico and 
Pakistan. 
  This agreement will be instrumental in boosting Chile's 
export earnings. Tironi stated: "A surplus in the European 
production of apples last year, coupled with a 10 percent 
increase in tariffs -- up from 6 to 16 percent -- caused exports 
of Chilean apples to drop by 40 percent." [passage omitted] 
  A Foreign Ministry communique states that the countervailing 
duties which affected Chile last year will be replaced by 
another, less restrictive, more transparent, and more 
predictable system. This was negotiated within the framework of 
the Uruguay Round of GATT trade talks. This new tariff system 
will apply to all Chilean fruits, not just to apples. 
  The communique adds that within the framework of the Uruguay 
Round, Chile managed to increase the selling price of its apples 
from 8 to 12 percent [as published] without being penalized by 
extremely high additional customs duties. This measure will 
become effective in July 1995. 
  The agreement also includes clauses to make the EU system 
that limits the entry of fruit less severe when there are 
exceptional market conditions. For example, countervailing 
duties will not be levied when sales volumes are very small. 
  The communique adds that the agreement includes a commitment 
for closer cooperation between Chile and the EU on the exchange 
of information about fruit market conditions. The agreement 
states: "The information provided by the Exporters' Association 
is of utmost importance for the fulfillment of the cooperation 
commitment." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Raul Gutierrez from the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Gabriel Silva, Colombian ambassador to Washington, 
has told U.S. Senator John Kerry that Colombia is not a 
narcodemocracy and that our economy is not controlled by drug 
traffickers. In a letter, Silva refutes the statements made by 
influential U.S. Senator John Kerry against the Colombian 
Government and legal system that were published in THE 
WASHINGTON POST. 
  The ambassador said: The Colombian Government has made 
enormous sacrifices to defend its democracy, so it is hasty to 
say that Colombia is a narcodemocracy. 
  Referring to the Cali Cartel's alleged control over some 
areas of the economy and media, Silva said organized crime tries 
to infiltrate certain areas, just as it does in the United 
States, but the government and legitimate businessmen in those 
sectors do not tolerate it. 
  Another part of the letter stated: The abolition of 
extradition is a sovereign decision made by the Constituent 
Assembly, elected by the people. 
  In conclusion, the ambassador admited that the government 
has 
and will continue to have differences with the prosecutor 
general, but he emphasized that government branches cooperate 
and are independent.

  [Text] Santo Domingo, 7 Apr (AFP) -- This Thursday, Fabio 
Herrera, Dominican deputy secretary of state of foreign 
relations, described the letter by 48 U.S. legislators urging 
President Joaquin Balaguer to prevent the UN and OAS embargo 
against the Haitian military regime from being violated as a 
"verbal threat." The Dominican Republic and Haiti share the 
Caribbean island of Hispaniola. 
  Herrera "categorically" rejected the terms used in the 
letter 
and suggested that "Dominican political sectors" whom he did not 
identify could be behind the note. He did clarify, however, 
that the opposition candidates preparing to participate in the 
10 May elections are not behind the letter. He indicated that 
the language used in the note "seems to be more political 
because these are not diplomats making the demand but pressure 
groups resorting to any language." 
  The deputy foreign minister indicated that the letter's tone 
"is not that which is normally used in diplomatic relations 
between the Dominican Republic and the United States, which are 
generally conveyed through the U.S. Embassy." The letter said 
"it would be tragic if our productive and friendly relations 
were undermined by your government's lack of willingness or 
inability to fully implement the embargo against Haiti." 
  The U.S. legislators stated contraband gasoline is moving 
from the Dominican Republic to Haiti, and they said that "fuel 
is being taken across the border by hand and in boats and 
trucks." The legislators' note also states that amount of fuel 
crossing the border has increased "despite the embargo." 
  This Thursday in Caracas, Claudette Werleigh, foreign 
minister of deposed President Jean Bertrand Aristide, stated 
nearly 2,000 gallons of gasoline cross the Dominican-Haitian 
land border every day. The gasoline is later sold on the 
Haitian "black market" at prices ranging from $15 to $18 per 
liter. The Dominican press has consistently reported, even with 
photographs, this fuel operation shows coordinated activity 
between both countries' militaries. 
  In one of the note's most aggressive passages, the U.S. 
legislators indicate that "this flagrant, massive violation of 
the embargo cannot be condoned." They stress to Balaguer that it 
is "imperative that your country end the Haitian embargo 
violation. These violations undermine international efforts to 
isolate the coupist regime and pressure it into reestablishing 
President Aristide's elected civilian government." The 
signatories are all members of President Bill Clinton's 
Democratic party. Heading the list is Joseph Kennedy II, a 
member of the famous U.S. dynasty.

  [Text] There is already a shortage of oil products in the 
southwest Dominican Republic. The people in the border cities of 
the southwest of the Dominican Republic have been deprived of 
fuel for several days due to the flourishing trafficking of oil 
products with Haiti, according to what the correspondent for the 
Haitian press agency in Santo Domingo has seen. This situation 
has paralyzed the enterprises in several Dominican cities, 
including Duverger, (Villard), Ragua, Neyba, Galvan, Tamayo, and 
Vicente Noble. Besides, numerous Dominicans, who went to these 
cities for Holy Week, have not been able to return to the cities 
from which they came due to lack of transportation. 
  Dominican President Joaquin Balaguer, whose regime is 
accused 
of violating the sanctions imposed on Haiti, stated on 2 April, 
during an electoral tour of Romana city, that his government was 
employing all necessary efforts to definitively control 
smuggling at the Haitian-Dominican border. The ban on smuggling 
is part of a new strategy aimed at restoring democracy in Haiti, 
said the Dominican head of state. 
  The announcement of these measures was made following the 
visit to Santo Domingo last week of U.S. Senator Christopher 
Dodd, who told President Balaguer about the the United States' 
concern over the increasing violation of human rights in Haiti.

  [Excerpt] On 6 April, the Dominican newspaper EL DIARIO 
denounced the smuggling of oil products between the Dominican 
Republic and Haiti, which is being done extensively, according 
to the newspaper. A reporter of the daily confirmed that 
transactions between Haitians and Dominicans are made daily in 
homes, located not far from the border between the two 
countries, where the products are stored. The trafficking of 
fuel and other products affected by the international embargo is 
done for the profit of the Haitian military regime, according to 
the Dominican daily. The article points out that in Dajabon, a 
region located 350 km northeast of Santo Domingo, a gallon of 
gasoline is sold for 55 Dominican pesos, that is, $5; whereas 
the regular price is 20 pesos, or $1.50. [passage omitted]

  [Text] I am still the president of Haiti. This is a 
statement by Justice Joseph Nerette on the afternoon of 7 April 
during a news briefing at his home. Hoping to ignore the 
parliamentary decree restoring President Aristide to his post, 
Justice Nerette said several times: I am the constitutional 
president of Haiti. 
  [Begin recording] [Nerette] Once again, I have not tendered 
my resignation. 
  [Unidentified journalist] For the time being, you consider 
yourself the president of the Republic of Haiti even though the 
parliamentarians restored President Aristide to his post? 
  [Nerette] I am the constitutional president of the Republic 
of Haiti. Do you want me to repeat the same thing again and 
again? 
  [Journalist] Mr. Nerette.... 
  [Nerette, interrupting] I think that is all, gentlemen. 
  [Journalist] One small question. 
  [Nerette] No, no, not half a question. 
  [Journalist Rotschild Francois] Why [do you make] these 
statements today when you kept silent for a long time? 
  [Nerette] I have the right to say nothing. Are you 
contesting 
my right to say nothing? 
  [Journalist Patrick Eliancy] Anyway, there is a [word 
indistinct], there are actions undertaken by the Revolutionary 
Front for the Promotion and Progress of Haiti [FRAPH], the 
Mobilization for National Development [MDN], the Group of 
Citizens of the Greater North [CCGN], and the Action Committee 
for National Reconciliation [CARENA] for the disentanglement of 
the crisis.... 
  [Francois, interrupting] Do you support this initiative by 
FRAPH, CARENA, MDN, and CCGN to try to establish a new 
government in the country? 
  [Nerette] I have already said that the country is in danger. 
They can call on a -- I would even say -- honest, loyal, and 
worthy citizen.... 
  [Journalist, interrupting] Have they called you? 
  [Nerette] Whether they have or not, I am president. 
  [Francois] But, Mr. Nerette, how can you explain that you 
are 
not at the National Palace? 
  [Journalist] Must one be at the National Palace to be 
president? Namphy was [words indistinct]. He refused to sit at 
the National Palace. He said that his office is in the barracks 
[previous six words in Creole: se kay jon nan'k kay li]. You 
have forgotten all that. [end recording]

  [Text] On 6 Aprio, President-in-exile Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide denounced in an official letter the agreement signed 
with the United States in 1981 on refugees. He did so to protest 
the systematic return by the United States to Haiti of those who 
want to leave the country. This agreement constitutes the legal 
basis of U.S. Coast Guard efforts to systematically return 
Haitian refugees who attempt to enter the United States. 
  Mr. Michael Barnes added that President-in-exile 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide also gave notice of his refusal of the 
latest plan for a settlement to the crisis in Haiti. U.S. Vice 
President Al Gore presented the plan to the president last 
month. Father Aristide considers unacceptable the American 
proposal to lift the sanctions before his return to Haiti as 
head of state. 
  The American policy is a perversion of democracy, says the 
letter to President Bill Clinton from the Haitian president, who 
has lived in exile since 1991. The letter points out that in 
any case the 1981 convention concerning the refugees expires in 
six months. 
  It should be recalled that the American policy regarding the 
Haitian refugees is based on the presumption that the refugees 
are not fleeing persecution, which is unbelievable, writes 
President Aristide. He reproaches Mr. Bill Clinton for having 
taken on the responsibility for the policy of his Republican 
predecessor George Bush, who began to send back Haitian refugees 
in 1992.

  [Text] Wednesday, 6 April, should mark a step in the 
opposition's attempt to implement Article 149 of the 
Constitution. Rothschild Francois has a report: 
  [Begin recording] [Francois] What is certain is that the day 
appears extremely decisive for the Coordinating Committee for 
National Mobilization, which is seeking installation of a new 
power in Haiti. The fate of this resolution bill submitted to 
parliament will perhaps be known today. As a matter of fact, the 
members of the committee that groups FRAPH [Revolutionary Front 
for the Promotion and Progress of Haiti], MDN [Mobilization for 
National Development], CARENA [Action Committee for National 
Reconciliation] and other political formations are due to be 
received by the conference of presidents in the Chamber of 
Deputies. For MDN leader Hubert de Ronceray, the meeting 
represenets a step forward within the framework of actions taken 
by the Coordinating Comittee. 
  [DeRonceray] We think this is an important step and we hope 
that something encouraging for the country comes out of this 
meeting. 
  [Francois] Do you support application of Article 149 of the 
Constitution? 
  [DeRonceray] Yes. Naturally, for us, all the conditions are 
fufilled right now, so that Article 149 of the Constitution is 
applicable. It is therefore up to our lawmakers to assume their 
responsibilities, fulfill their duties, and respond to the 
expectations and aspirations of the majority. 
  [Francois] Article 149 meaning Judge Nerette, or the 
president of the Court of Cassation, Attorney Jonassaint? 
  [DeRonceray] We think that the constitutional principle must 
prevail. There are two interpretations of Article 149: an 
interpretation favoring the president of the Court of Cassation, 
and another favoring the 8 October 1991 government, which would 
mean Judge Nerette. For us in MDN, what is important is for 
constitutional principle to triumph. Whichever interpretation 
prevails, we will accept it because what is important for us is 
that the country be endowed with a government capable of 
restoring order to this country's life and of finally endowing 
Haiti with a stable government capable of promoting development, 
progress, and peace. 
  [Francois] Asked about the attitude of the international 
community regarding this anti-Aristide initiative, Hubert de 
Ronceray thinks that it is more than time for Haitians to take 
responsibility by emerging from this stalemate. He also points 
out that the international community is aware of its mistakes in 
managing Haiti. That is why, according to DeRonceray, it is 
important to move in the right direction. 
  [DeRonceray] It is certain that during the early days, the 
international community will not be enthusiastic. As soon as the 
new government shows discipline, competence, and seriousness, 
however, there is no doubt that the international community will 
be sensitive to such demonstrations and will tend to change 
their attitude toward us. [end recording]

  [Text] Professor Hubert de Ronceray, leader of the 
Mobilization for National Development, MDN, reacting to the 
cancellation of a conference with the presidents of the 
political blocs in the lower chamber, still believes it is up to 
the legislators to fill the institutional vacuum. The MDN 
leader, member of the Coordinating Committee, invites the 
legislators to cooperate in the installation of a new power. 
  [Begin recording] [De Ronceray] I believe that the joint 
resolution is very clear. It says very clearly that we support a 
constitutional solution with application of Article 149 of the 
Constitution. But in case parliament refuses to follow up this 
constitutional demand, then parliament will be responsible for 
all favorable or unfavorable reactions that result from this 
refusal. We are therefore very sorry to see that those who are 
in charge of the defense of this country's Constitution, those 
who are mandated by the people to defend their rights, are 
threatening to drop the Constitution as they did so many times, 
but are also threatening to hasten the chaos. We hope that good 
sense will finally prevail. We invite all those in parliament, 
in the Chamber of Deputies and in the Senate, who still have 
minimal respect for this country, to accept their 
responsibilities and defend, tooth-and-nail, what is left of law 
and duty for senators and deputies. 
  [Francois] If the situation persists, are you going to give 
up, or are you going to pursue the fight by developing new 
strategies? 
  [De Ronceray] The fight must continue until a solution is 
found to the crisis. Because right now, I think that we are 
facing a national tragedy. There are seven million men and women 
who can no longer resist. There are seven million men and women 
who are asking the political authorities to show that they are 
still real men and women. I think it is our duty to continue the 
fight until the truth is respected and implemented. [end

  [Excerpts] The Coordinating Committee [for National 
Mobilization, CCMN] is at a deadlock. The Conference of 
Presidents at the Chamber of Deputies has resisted the pressures 
of this committee. We are deaf to threats, stated Mr. Frantz 
Robert Monde. Those men have no program, no plan for the future, 
he proclaimed. The following is a report by Daly Valet. 
  [Begin recording] [Valet] On Wednesday, 6 April, the 
ultimatum of the CCMN expired. There was surprise as the 
committee did not go into action as they had threatened to do in 
the event that the parliamentarians did not ratify their plan 
for an ad hoc government. Anyway, we must say this matter was 
debated by the Conference of Presidents at the Chamber of 
Deputies on the morning of 6 April. The results and decisions 
are the following: the Conference is prepared not to receive 
the delegation of the mobilization committee even if they go to 
the parliament. If we are to trust Monde's explanations, the 
bloc presidents will make their positions known in a letter they 
will send to the CCMN on 8 April. 
  [Monde] These men decided not to meet with this delegation 
and to write them back instead. This letter will be 
ready....[pauses] We are discussing it; this letter will be sent 
to them on 8 April. Anyway, the press will have a copy of it. 
  [Valet] The president of the Chamber of Deputies stated 
that he does not allow himself to be intimidated by pressure and 
that pressure will not make him obey. The president explained 
that the deputies remain committed to the parliamentary plan 
they passed in the Chamber of Deputies at the beginning of 
March. Monde added they had not rejected the CCMN's ad hoc 
government plan, but a small group of people cannot think that 
they can take power to defend their personal interests. 
Besides, wonders Frantz Robert Monde, what is the plan of those 
people who want to take power? What have they decided to do for 
the people who are living in poverty? [passage omitted] 
  According to the president of the Chamber of Deputies, 
the country's political crisis looks complicated to several 
parliamentarians especially the latest statements by former de 
facto President Joseph Nerette who claims still to be president 
of the Republic. On that score, Monde asserted that events have 
passed Nerette by. [passage omitted] [end recording]

  [Text] There is already emotion within the Coordinating 
Committee for National Mobilization [CCMN] after the decision of 
the Conference of Presidents not to receive the members of this 
committee. Hubert De Ronceray calls President Monde's 
allegations spectacular. 
  [Begin De Ronceray recording, in Creole] You must be 
careful. 
You must not give much importance to certain spectacular 
statements. I call them spectacular statements because there are 
people who want to show that... [pauses] They are attributing 
much importance to themselves whereas what is being settled here 
is something very serious. It is about an imperiled country. 
Our contacts have shown us that many people within the 
parliament, both in the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate, take 
the matter very seriously. So, if there are other people who 
are providing entertainment, who are making somewhat noisy 
statements, we think it is because they want to attribute 
importance to themselves. But we are more than convinced that 
something serious will result from this resolution. [end

  [Excerpts] The Senate of the Republic is tied up. There is 
mistrust. [Senate] President Firmin Jean-Louis is being keenly 
criticized and is suspected of working to get named prime 
minister. Yvon Gislain, vice-president of the legal office 
[title as heard], explains that he can convene the Senate if he 
wishes. Here is a report by Daly Valet: 
  [Begin recording, in Creole] [Valet] It is true that the 
[Senate] office presided over by Bernard Sansaricq did not 
follow Senate regulations to the letter when it was being set 
up. It is true that this office trampled underfoot certain 
articles of the nation's Constitution. It is true that a climate 
of fear, worry, and insecurity was established at the Senate. It 
is also true, however, that Senator Firmin Jean-Louis, president 
of the legitimate [Senate] office, is not a wholly innocent 
party in the Senate crisis. Thus said several parliamentarians 
who have broken their silence to condemn the dilatory maneuvers 
being effected by Sen. Firmin Jean-Louis in order to prevent the 
Senate from holding sessions. This time, the reactions come from 
Sen. Firmin Jean-Louis's side itself. 
  Sen. Yvon Gislain, vice-president [title as heard] of the 
legitimate Senate office, condemns the fact that the office of 
which he is a member has not created any means for holding 
sessions at the Senate since [acting Prime Minister] Robert 
Malval was ratified. 
  [Gislain] The Senate crisis began back at the time of 
Malval's rafification. From the time Malval was ratified, 
nothing has been done at the Senate. There is an office, of 
which I am a member. I admit that the office has never taken any 
initiative to hold further sessions. Other elements within the 
Senate take the initiative to form a second office without 
respecting the constitutional norms regarding the Senate's 
internal regulations. This is what has made this office 
ineffectual. It is really unconstitutional. I think, however, 
something must be done so that we can come up with something 
because the country is collapsing due to the fact that the 
Senate remains totally tied up. 
  [Valet] Rumor has it that through the empty-seat policy at 
the Senate, Sen. Jean-Louis is defending his personal interests. 
Some say Sen. Jean-Louis is seeking to become prime minister. 
According to such people, this is why he does not want to hold 
Senate sessions. We have said: Well, these are rumors that 
Firmin Jean-Louis has not confirmed. 
  The vice-president of the legitimate Senate Office, however, 
calls on Sen. Jean-Louis to hold sessions so that personal 
interests can be set aside for the benefit of the nation's 
interests, which are suffering. 
  [Gislain] The whole thing is a question of holding sessions. 
If sessions are held, the [parliamentary] plan will be passed. 
It will be ratified, because there will always be a majority 
that will allow the plan to pass. [passage omitted] 
  [Valet] After Deputy Duly Brutus, [Deputy] Antoine Joseph, 
and [Senator] Gislain, the ball is now in Sen. Jean-Louis's 
court, and he can do one of two things: either he will decide to 
create the means to hold Senate sessions or he will decide to 
let rumor continue to claim that, at the Senate, he is defending 
his own, personal interests. [end recording]

  [Text] Illegal immigration is an issue on which our people 
have many different views. It is an extremely dangerous endeavor 
for those who have emigrated illegally from Cuba by sea. 
Research is being conducted precisely on this topic by a 
specialist of the Center for Political Alternatives of the 
University of Havana. Its deputy director, Antonio Aja, explains: 
  [Aja] "This is an in-depth study of the characteristics of 
those who emigrate illegally; the motives of the people who make 
the decision to emigrate illegally; who they are; what their 
reasons are; and the risks taken once the decision and attempt 
to illegally emigrate is made." 
  The researcher also spoke about the significance of this act 
for national security and human life. 
  [Aja] "Emigrating through the Guantanamo Naval Base is not 
the same as emigrating in a raft." 
  The classification of people who attempt to emigrate by sea 
was another of the goals of this study. 
  [Aja] "They can basically be classified as young. This is 
understandable because, first of all, this endeavor requires a 
certain physical ability." 
  This interview is only an excerpt of a broad subject that we 
will discuss further in this program over the next few days.

  [Text] On 10 April, Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina 
arrived in Peru for a two-day visit. He arrived in Lima from 
Buenos Aires where he met with Argentine Foreign Minister Guido 
Di Tella, representatives of more than 15 news agencies, and 
with Cuban singer Silvio Rodriguez. Rodriguez, accompanied by 
Anabel Lopez, is to sing in various Argentine provinces. Robaina 
said that it was mandatory to meet with Silvio Rodriguez, 
because with his art he takes Cuba's reality to thousands of 
Argentines who appreciate his music. Robaina added that 
Rodriguez' music is also an expression of Cuba's foreign policy. 
  In Lima, Robaina met with representatives of the LA 
REPUBLICA 
newspaper, and Cuban Embassy staff and officials. Robaina also 
met with a large group of Cubans who work in Peru, over 30 
sports trainers, doctors, and other support personnel. Robaina 
also met with the Cuban community in Peru, which for over 30 
years has maintained an attitude of respect, dialogue, and 
understanding with Cuba. 
  On 11 April, Robaina and his delegation will meet with 
Peruvian businessmen at the Banco Continental de Lima. Later on, 
high-level meetings will be held between the representatives of 
Cuba's and Peru's Foreign Ministries.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Roberto Morejon from the "Evening Information </F>
Review" newscast] 
  [Text] Agreements with two countries could clear up Cuba's 
energy future if they are ultimately implemented, allowing the 
island to improve its economy, whose Achilles' heel is precisely 
the lack of fuel. 
  The weekly OPCIONES, which circulates in Cuba to provide 
information to tourists and foreign residents, said in its 
latest edition that Cuba and Russia ratified an agreement last 
December to exchange Cuban sugar for Russian petroleum. Through 
this agreement, Moscow would send 2.5 million tons of petroleum 
to the island this year in exchange for 1 million tons of 
unrefined sugar. 
  A few days ago, Mexican Ambassador to Cuba Carlos Tello 
revealed both countries had signed a letter of intent to 
exploit, under a joint enterprise scheme, some 60,000 barrels of 
petroleum at the Cienfuegos refinery on the southern coast of 
Cuba, and to produce petroleum byproducts for sale on domestic 
and world markets. 
  If the accord signed by Havana and the Mexican state-owned 
company Mexpetrol advances favorably, the refined product would 
be sold in the Cuban market and the oversupply in other nations. 
The origin of the current Cuban economic crisis is related to 
energy following the reduction in petroleum supplies from the 
defunct Soviet Union, which in 1989 supplied a little more than 
13 million tons. 
  Cuba has been forced to get its economy going with only half 
of this amount, because it does not have the financial reserves 
to purchase all of its petroleum needs. For similar reasons, 
Cuba mothballed its electronuclear program launched with the 
Soviet Union in 1980, when investments exceeded $1.2 billion. 
For the time being, this has eliminated the possibility of 
reducing dependence on imported petroleum. Cuba does not have 
plentiful rivers, large forests, or significant coal deposits, 
and it only exploits wells of heavy petroleum, whose production 
last year hit a record of 1.1 million tons. 
  National crude oil is used in industry, the production of 
cement, and power-generation. Additionally, the country has 
resorted to foreign investments to explore new fields of light 
petroleum by granting risk contracts. The results of these 
contracts will only be known in the future. 
  Even if the agreements with Russia and Mexico bear fruit, 
not 
all of the country's needs will be met. Nevertheless, annual 
payments on imports would be reduced by using petroleum refined 
at the Cienfuegos installation, in addition to securing the 
Russian supply in exchange for Cuban sugar.

  [Text] The new tourism structure, which will be headed by 
the Tourism Ministry [as heard], has been implemented gradually 
since 1 April. Osmany Cienfuegos, vice president of the Councils 
of State and Ministers, said in a news conference a few minutes 
ago that this new structure in the tourism sector is seeking 
greater economic efficiency, more profitability, more 
expeditiousness in transactions, and better organization 
throughout the country. 
  Three main hotel chains have been created. The [name 
indistinct] chain which will group the four- and five-star 
hotels. This chain will be headed by Javier Ardizones, former 
Cuban ambassador to Italy. The Horizon chain, which is headed by 
Jose Fernandez de Cossio, former Cuban ambassador to Mexico, 
will comprise three-star hotels. The other chain is the National 
Blue Island chain, which is headed by Rafael Cespedes, and which 
in addition to grouping a number of hotels, will also be in 
charge of other facilities that will offer special honeymoon and 
other services for national tourism. The installations of the 
two international chains will be included in this group. 
  At the national level, the entertainment and tourism 
companies are organized to exploit the potentials of each 
province or municipality in the cultural, historical, and sports 
areas, among others. 
  This report has been released by Osmany Cienfuegos at the 
close of the first working meeting on tourism and the role of 
the media, which was held for three days at the international 
press center.

  [Text] Osmany Cienfuegos, vice president of the Council of 
Ministers, has announced that the process of making structural 
changes in the sphere of tourism was set in March. There will 
henceforth be a Ministry of Tourism and a series of provincial 
enterprises and chains. Three of these chains will specialize in 
hotel exploitation. 
  [Later in the same newscast, in a report on items appearing 
in GRANMA on 9 April, correspondent Roger Ricardo Luis says: 
"Among GRANMA's main stories today is a report on the new 
structure being imposed on the tourism sector in Cuba on the 
basis of the changes in Intur, the National Institute of 
Tourism. Osmany Cienfuegos, vice president of the Council of 
Ministers, has announced that a Ministry of Tourism will be 
formed soon. The new structure aims to obtain greater efficiency 
in this vital economic domain."]

  [Text] On 8 April, the National Secretariat of the Cuban 
Workers Federation [CTC] agreed to hold, for the first time, 
assemblies on economic efficiency, beginning in the second half 
of May. The first of these assemblies will be held in April and 
will examine how to fulfill the decision reached by the workers 
in the workplace assemblies, as well as new problems in the 
workplaces. The CTC National Secretariat also officially agreed 
to allocate eight million pesos a year to cover the expenses of 
the Jose Marti Pioneers Organization [OPJM]. 
  CTC Secretary General Pedro Ross Leal pointed out that the 
goal of the decision is to reduce Cuba's budget and ensure that 
children do not suffer the consequences of the special period 
and are prepared for the future. OPJM Vice President Laritza 
Diaz applauded the gesture of the CTC, which will cover the 
expenses of over 300 children's facilities nationwide to benefit 
the workers' children. 
  The CTC National Secretariat also discussed the results of 
the plenum that closed the Parliament in the Workplace process, 
and discussed the accomplishments of a group of workplaces 
nominated to receive National Emulation Vanguard status.

  [Text] Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada, president of the 
National Assembly of the People's Government [ANPP], stressed 
that we must thoroughly explore every possibility to achieve 
higher economic efficiency. Alarcon made this assertion at the 
closing of a meeting with deputies, Communist Party of Cuba and 
government officials, and presidents of the People's Councils in 
Las Tunas Province. Alarcon stressed that the difficulties of 
the special period will not be solved through nationally 
implemented measures alone. 
  The ANPP special session convenes in less than a month to 
analyze measures aimed at streamlining Cuba's economy, as well 
as to make it more efficient.

  [Text] Upon visiting several labor centers in Santiago de 
Cuba and learning about the principal problems and objectives in 
each workplace, Politburo member Carlos Lage Davila granted an 
exclusive interview to this station during which he assessed the 
final stage of the harvest. 
  [Begin Lage recording] We can say that the harvest is going 
through a very difficult, tense situation. In Santiago de Cuba 
and other provinces as well, the harvest is behind schedule, 
perhaps because of rains and other factors. The conditions under 
which the harvest had to be prepared were very difficult. [end 
recording] 
  For this reason it has been decided to continue the 
harvesting activities until May. We must get ready to conclude 
the harvest under the abnormal conditions of rain and humidity. 
After more than three months of harvesting, breakdowns are 
reasonably expected to increase, and so we must look for rapid 
solutions. However, notwithstanding the inclement weather or 
material failures, Lage trusts that the workers' spirit will not 
decline: 
  [Begin Lage recording] The leaders and workers who are 
engaged in this harvest have not shown any sign of weariness, 
although some of these groups have been working for more than 
140 days and still need to continue working through the month of 
April, and perhaps even some days in May. [end recording] 
  Despite the difficulties, Santiago de Cuba seems to be 
determined to fullfill its objective. According to the latest 
assessment, the conditions are appropriate to achieve these 
objectives, but as in any endeavor to reach the final goal, a 
greater effort is demanded.

  [Text] The required levels of manual sugarcane weeding were 
not met by every province during the January-March quarter. This 
process does not require any type of imported resources, but 
relies fundamentally on manpower and the organization and 
mobilization of the necessary work force. 
  Holguin and Granma where the only provinces that surpassed 
their weeding goals; Havana and Camaguey Provinces followed 
close behind. However, Pinar del Rio, Villa Clara, and Ciego de 
Avila Provinces did not reach even 50 percent of the areas 
completed in their best quarters.

will be invested to provide sheets and uniforms to workers and

came out in favor of preserving free health care services in all 
specialized fields, including cosmetic surgery. 
  The suitability process among work group personnel will 
begin, with serenity and maturity, said Ramon Crespo, secretary 
general of the Health Workers Union, who guaranteed that the 
administrations of all organizations will benefit from this 
action. 
  It was determined that attention and motivation in regard to 
night shift personnel could no longer be postponed. Havana 
Province has a successful experiment underway in this connection. 
  [Begin unidentified speaker recording] We in the province 
have developed and are continuing to develop a program of 
sponsorship by large production centers, such as sugar mills, 
cooperatives, Basic Cooperative Production Units, and cement 
factories in the muncipalities where they exist, by which the 
administration and political elements at those centers sponsor 
and attend to our night shift workers, including medical 
personnel on the night watch and others who work the graveyard 
shift. 
  What does this involve? It involves providing dinner, an 
afternoon snack, or some snack or cold drink in the late, 
predawn, hours for those workers who are giving their best and 
their all to comfort and care for our people. [end recording] 
  Cuba will be the site of the first international meeting of 
health care union leaders, to be held in December, 1994.

  [Text] The reactivation of an old power plant, the "Manuel 
Julien," located in the historic sector of the city of Camaguey 
is one of the responsibilities assigned to the province's 
scientific hub. After being taken out of service a few years 
ago, this plant is now undergoing modifications that will allow 
it to burn solid fuels, mainly bagasse. 
  Seven groups made up of people from 11 provincial 
organizations are working on the power plant, which began 
operating in the 1920's. These people are responsible for 
repairing the plant's boilers, cooling system, pipes, and water 
treatment system. The plant is expected to be operational in 
June, and to be capable of generating 10 megawatts, which is a 
third of the city of Camaguey's demand. 
  This is a new responsibility that has been given to the 
productive scientific hub, and reactivating the plant will allow 
us to make it available during two periods, as well as 
incorporate it into the power grid.

  [Text] Santo Domingo, 8 Apr (AFP) -- President Joaquin 
Balaguer said on Friday he does not oppose the international 
community providing logistical assistance in Dominican territory 
in order to supervise compliance with the UN and OAS embargo 
against the Haitian military regime. 
  The Dominican Republic and Haiti share the Caribbean island 
of La Hispaniola. Recently 48 U.S. Democratic congressmen sent 
a letter to Balaguer calling on him to put an end to the embargo 
violations by stopping the transfer of gasoline and fuel oil 
across the Haitian border. 
  In an interview with the press, Balaguer admitted "there had 
been a certain loosening in the surveillance the Armed Forces 
should maintain to make the blockade effective." 
  He said many Haitians cross the border, thanks to the "lax 
surveillance," to stock up on gasoline at gas stations in the 
Dominican Republic, thus increasing the volume of fuel 
contraband into Haiti. 
  He reaffirmed his opposition to the blockade, however, 
because of the implications it could have for his country. He 
said the faltering border surveillance "is because of the 
exceedingly long time the embargo has been in place and because 
the naval blockade has not been strictly enforced either." 
  He announced he has told the representatives of the Group of 
Friends of Haiti (the United States, France, Canada, and 
Venezuela), the Dominican Republic cannot maintain an 
"indefinite policy in support of the blockade" against Haiti. 
"This is impossible for humanitarian reasons." 
  He said that the representatives agree it is necessary to 
resolve the situation and that the Dominican Republic cannot 
support the blockade for too long. 
  For the time being, he said, the government will continue to 
take steps to maintain the embargo. The measures will be 
reinforced with support offered by the Group of Friends of 
Haiti, as presented by a spokesman for the U.S. State 
Department, with whom Balaguer met a few days ago. 
  Balaguer expressed his hope the Haitian crisis will soon 
end. 
"I believe it will, as things are moving in the right 
direction. I hope the crisis will conclude sooner for the good 
of all sectors and for the improvement of trade between Haiti 
and the Dominican Republic," he concluded.

  [Text] Port-au-Prince, 10 Apr (AFP) -- The Haitian Senate 
Bloc, not recognized by the international community, today 
approved a motion for the appointment of a provisional president 
and the calling of elections. The bloc approved the motion by 
11 votes in favor and two opposed thanks to the support of the 
eight senators elected in the January 1993 partial legislative 
elections which has been challenged by the international 
community. 
  The proposals refer to the application of Article 149 of the 
Constitution that foresees the appointment of the president of 
the court of appeals as president of the Republic in case of a 
prolonged absence by the president. The Constitution stipulates 
that in such cases, elections must be called within a "45 to 90 
day" period. 
  The senators decided to announce their decision to the 
Chamber of Deputies and Appeals Court President Emile 
Jonassaint. The deputies had already approved another plan, 
supported by the United States and the United Nations, to solve 
the country's crisis, but not with the senatorial bloc (led by 
Firmin Jean-Louis) acknowledged by the international community. 
  Deposed President Jean Bertrand Aristide rejected the 
aforementioned plan that contemplates the designation of a new 
prime minister after the departure of Army Chief General Raoul 
Cedras, even though no mention is made of the date when he will 
be able to return to the country. [sentence as received]

  [Text] No official request for the safety of senators has 
yet been sent to the Haitian police, according to the Senate 
president, Firmin Jean-Louis, on 7 April. The senators are 
hesitant because risks exist in parliament, he explained. He 
stated, however, that everything will be done to resume 
activities in the Senate. Let us listen to Senator Firmin 
Jean-Louis. 
  [Begin recording] [Jean-Louis] Certainly, words were spoken. 
You have heard Osny Eugene say he is resolutely waiting for us. 
We have assessed the situation and again hesitate. The senators 
[words indistinct] safety. Once there is a risk of danger or 
real danger, we hesitate. The diplomatic lounge is not meant for 
holding sessions. As you know well, there is a session room. It 
is not question of meeting once or twice. It is question of 
running the parliamentary institution, the senatorial 
institution. There is now a problem -- the occupation of the 
premises by those elected during the contested 18 January [1993] 
elections. We make it a point of.... [pauses] We wish to resume 
work. We wish to resume normal sessions. To do so, we must, of 
course, have the session room; we must actually control the 
administration of the institution. 
  [Unidentified journalist] Senator [Yvon] Gislain, a member 
of 
your office, has accused you of having done nothing to resume 
activities. How do you react to his statements? 
  [Jean-Louis] Perhaps, Sen. Gislain (?did not attend) our 
last 
meeting. There are a total of 17 senators, including five who 
are more or less dissident, who now side with the 18 January 
parliamentarians; five others who peremptorily say they will sit 
only in the session; and others who might possibly agree to work 
elsewhere. You know very well that to hold sessions, you need a 
minimum of 11 [senators], which constitutes our quorum. Until 
now, it has been (?impossible) to hold sessions in a place other 
than the session room. If the police would like to give us a 
hand to convince those elected in the 18 January elections to 
put an end to their occupation of the premises, we would 
certainly not say no. 
  [Journalist] There is no formal request? 
  [Jean-Louis] No, not yet. [end recording] 
  That was Sen. Firmin Jean-Louis, president of the National 
Assembly, who was answering questions from a crowd of 
journalists concerning the situation in the Senate of the 
Republic. No formal request has been sent to the Haitian police 
to ensure the safety of parliamentarians if the activities 
resume in the Senate of the Republic.

  [Text] The Coordinating Body of People's Organizations 
[Coordination des Organisations Populaires, COP] has reaffirmed 
its support for the Governors Island agreement, the only valid 
framework to get the country out of the crisis, according to 
COP. It thinks the formation of an ad hoc government would just 
plunge the country into even more chaos. Let us listen to an 
unidentified COP spokesman: 
  [Begin unidentified spokesman recording, in Creole] Our 
position in COP regarding the ad hoc government that is being 
discussed today is that this idea is not viable. It offers 
nothing toward resolving the country's crisis. We in COP have 
always said there is no solution but the Governors Island 
agreement for resolving the country's crisis, because the 
Governors Island agreement is an agreement of principle signed 
by General Cedras and President Aristide in the presence of the 
international community to resolve the country's crisis. 
  We think that so long as stalling maneuvers are aimed at 
preventing the reactivation of the Governors Island agreement, 
the country's crisis will never be resolved. [end recording]

  [Text] The Dominican Republic is opposed to the presence of 
foreign observers on the border between Haiti and the Dominican 
Republic. On 7 April, Dominican Vice Chancellor Fabio Herrera 
Cabral criticized the idea of sending UN observers to the 
Dominican Republic border. Vice Chancellor Fabio Herrera Cabral 
said that to post foreign observers on both sides of the border 
would be an insult to national sovereignty. 
  He added, however, that the Dominican Government would be 
agreeable to accepting observers if they were recruited from 
among the Dominican population. Mr. Fabio Herrera Cabral was 
reacting to statements by a UN spokesman raising the possibility 
of observing the behavior of Dominican authorities from the 
border with Haiti. 
  It should be pointed out that over the past few days the 
Dominican Government was subjected to severe criticism because 
of its ambiguous attitude toward the embargo, especially its 
providing gasoline and gas oil to the Republic of Haiti.

  [Text] Jeremie city hall employees have been on strike for 
several weeks to demand overdue salaries. It is impossible to 
communicate by phone with Jeremie. Our regional correspondent 
came to Port-au-Prince, having noticed a slight improvement in 
maritime transport. Jean-Obed Maturin has a report: 
  [Begin Maturin recording, in Creole] The city hall employees 
continue to demand 10 months of overdue salaries. The employees 
have asked the minister of the interior to act on their behalf 
because they can wait no longer. The city hall employees in 
Jeremie stopped working several months ago. 
  The population in Jeremie is again begging the telephone 
company's managers to do something about the telephone lines in 
Jeremie, which have been out of service for five months. The 
telephone line failure completely isolates Jeremie from the 
other departments and from foreign countries. The company's 
employees spend their days without working. Many of the 
population hope that the company's managers in Port-au-Prince 
will take the case of Jeremie into consideration and not dismiss 
their complaints. 
  Maritime transport resumed two weeks ago, with the ship 
FRETA 
and a few others bringing a little life to Jeremie, which was 
almost dead. However, even though these activities have resumed, 
the cost of living has increased in Jeremie. [end recording]

  [Text] Inhabitants of San Miguel and La Union Departments 
have called this station to deny that Armando Calderon Sol 
visited these departments as reported by a television station. 
The televised report showed Calderon Sol campaigning in the 
Belen neighborhood, at San Miguel's Student Center, and in El 
Pilon, La Union Department. 
  Our sources, meanwhile, say they only saw Dr. Borgo 
Bustamante and Guadalupe Sorto. On 6 April, Calderon Sol was 
supposed to have met with members of the Supreme Electoral 
Tribunal and Dr. Ruben Zamora at El Presidente Hotel, but he 
failed to show up. Several government officials maintained that 
the ruling party candidate was visiting eastern El Salvador, but 
others said he was in the western region. 
  The public disappearance of the ARENA [Nationalist 
Republican 
Alliance] candidate, along with the designs of certain media to 
show Calderon Sol in places he has not been, reinforce 
unofficial reports that Calderon Sol is in a hospital outside of 
the country. Diplomatic sources who asked not to be identified 
noted that last weekend Calderon Sol had a nervous breakdown 
that prompted him to severely beat his wife, Elizabeth de 
Calderon Sol, and this is why he is in a hospital in New Orleans.

  [Text] The FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front] 
today denounced serious distortions in the fulfillment of the 
peace agreements, and expressed the fear that a failure to 
fulfill pending agreements may cause social instability. The 
FMLN appealed to the UN secretary general for "a stronger 
reaction" to force the government to fulfill the agreements. 
  FMLN leader Leonel Gonzalez pointed out that the distortion 
of the peace agreements is part of the government's plan to 
merge the National Police [PN], which is to be dismantled, with 
the National Civilian Police [PNC] and the government's 
presentation of a new plan to step up the transfer of lands that 
would overlook over 20,000 former FMLN and Armed Forces fighters. 
  Regarding the government's failure to fulfill the 
agreements, 
Gonzalez pointed out that the constitutional reforms to 
modernize the administration of justice are pending, and he 
expressed the fear that on 1 May the new Legislative Assembly 
will be installed without the previous assembly having approved 
the reforms. 
  According to procedure, constitutional reforms must be 
approved and confirmed by two legislative assemblies and if they 
are not approved by the current assembly, changes in the 
judicial system will remain on hold until 2000. "The judicial 
system is obsolete, and it allows impunity to succeed," Gonzalez 
said, adding: "these are factors that could destabilize the 
country's transition process." 
  Another issue denounced by Gonzalez is that the government 
"has disregarded ONUSAL [UN Observers for El Salvador], and it 
has been unable to confirm how many soldiers are in the PNC or 
to assess how much they earn." Expanding on the dismantling of 
the PN, Gonzalez said: "There is an agreement to dissolve the 
PN. A reduction in force program has already been presented, 
and 3,000 policemen were to be demobilized this month, but the 
government suspended the demobilization process, and we are 
aware of its plan to merge the PN and PNC in October." The 
possible merger of the PN and PNC and the incorporation into the 
PNC of the Narcotics Executive Unit and Commission for the 
Investigation of Crimes, means to Gonzalez that "by 1995 the 
seed of a new repressive body will exist." 
  To make the government fulfill the peace agreements, 
Gonzalez 
has proposed that the United Nations and Group of Friends 
(Mexico, Spain, Venezuela, and Colombia) exert pressure on the 
government with a mandate from the Security Council. He added 
that the UN "must take firmer action." 
  UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali said yesterday that 
still pending are the reintegrations into society through the 
land transfers and constitutional reforms recommended by the 
Truth Commission. Ghali also pointed out the persistence of 
significant signs of reluctance to establish the PNC, which was 
a fundamental goal of the peace agreements between the 
government and FMLN. He added that there seems to be a desire 
to distance the formation of the PNC from the dismantling of the 
PN.

<F P=106> [From the "YSU Radio News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front] 
has denounced the fact that the Land Transfer Program [PTT] for 
former guerrillas is at a standstill. Meanwhile, the United 
Nations has appealed to the government to resolve issues pending 
in the peace agreements. 
  Antonio Alvarez, of the FMLN's Secretariat of Agrarian 
Affairs, questioned President Cristiani's announcement regarding 
the deadline to fulfill this point of the peace agreements. 
  [Begin Alvarez recording] The current problem is that the 
implementation of the PTT remains at a standstill. Some 100 
properties from the first phase have not been legalized. These 
properties would benefit 5,000 landowners and former guerrillas. 
To date, the first phase has not been completed and the second 
phase has not begun; it has not even begun. 
  In the second phase, there are 1,879 properties located 
primarily in Morazan and Chalatenango Departments. The 
properties in the second phase would benefit 20,000 landowners 
and former fighters who are still awaiting the legal transfer of 
lands. I am talking about 111,000 manzanas. 
  The government pledged to guarantee the transfer of 1,300 
properties in Morazan and Chalatenango after noting it had 
encountered judicial and legal difficulties in registering them. 
Their registration would require an exceptional judicial, legal 
decree which the government promised that the Legislative 
Assembly would approve, but to date this has not happened. 
Therefore, it is impossible for these 1,300 properties to be 
legalized. 
  The delays in the first and second phases involve 1,989 
properties and 20,000 landowners and former fighters. 
Therefore, I would characterize as incredible and unrealistic 
President Cristiani's remarks to the effect that by 31 May the 
PTT will have concluded. He knows perfectly well that this 
assertion is neither true nor realistic. We believe this 
program will take much longer. [end recording] 
  Alvarez said the government's land transfer proposal does 
not 
take into consideration the UN's stipulations regarding the 
number of beneficiaries. 
  [Begin Alvarez recording] We maintain that the government 
must adhere to the figure established in the UN General 
Secretary's 13 October 1992 proposal, which is 32,500. The 
problem is that the government has registered less landowners 
than the 32,500 stated in the UN secretary general's proposal. 
Therefore, there are 6,500 landowners who are living on 
properties that have owners whose names can be verified, who 
have not been registered by the government, and who, therefore, 
have been excluded from the government's lists. [end recording] 
  To this end, the FMLN representative gave assurances that 
this situation will foster social unrest. He added that to date 
the government has not provided any loans to the former 
fighters, which will hinder the country's next agrarian cycle.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 8 Apr (NA) -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin has addressed a letter to his Argentine colleague, 
Carlos Menem, in which he expresses interest in Menem's proposal 
to create a UN corps of "white helmets." 
  Yeltsin also invited Menem to meet with him to evaluate the 
viability of the proposal. 
  This was revealed today by the Argentine chief of state 
himself, who indicated that he had received the Russian leader's 
letter on 7 March. 
  In remarks to a radio station Menem today explained that his 
proposal "is in keeping with the Church's social doctrine," and 
indicated that "I am trying to find answers as quickly as 
possible to the tremendous problems that are produced by the 
huge numbers of very poor people existing in the world." 
  "I received a letter from President Yeltsin on 7 April in 
which he expresses interest in the topic, and he has invited me 
to a summit between Argentina and Russia to exchange opinions on 
the matter," he revealed. 
  Menem said that "poverty has made impressive advances during 
the past few years, but in addition to poverty characterized by 
a lack of sustenance, we are mostly concerned with the poverty 
of scarce knowledge."

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 10 Apr (EFE) -- The ruling 
Justicialist Party (Peronist) won in the elections held today to 
choose 305 legislators tasked with reforming the Constitution, 
according to private polls held "by word of mouth." The Great 
Front [Frente Grande] center-left coalition won in the federal 
capital and moved up to third place in Buenos Aires Province, 
the country's most populated district. 
  It is reckoned that President Carlos Menem's Peronism won 
between 43 and 45 percent of the votes in the country's 24 
districts. The Great Front won between 35-36.5 percent of the 
votes in the federal capital, followed by Peronism with 25.5 
percent, and the Radical Civic Union (UCR) with 15 percent, 
according to polls conducted by Buenos Aires television stations. 
  The voting results in the federal capital mean a hard defeat 
for radicalism led by former Argentine President Raul Alfonsin. 
  Menem's Justicialist Party won 44.5 percent of the votes in 
Buenos Aires Province, followed by the UCR with 15.2 percent of 
the votes, the Great Front with 14.7 percent, and the right-wing 
Movement for Dignity and Independence [MODIN] with 11.7 percent.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 10 Apr (EFE) -- The Great Front 
center-left coalition was victorious in the federal capital in 
the elections held today in Argentina to elect the 305 
legislators who will reform the Constitution. The coalition 
triumph, which the polls had predicted, surpassed estimates 
because according to the first unofficial poll it reached 
between 30-35 percent, according to several sources. The 
Justicialist Party (Peronist) dropped in Buenos Aires to a 
distant second with between 25-30 percent, and the UCR dropped 
to between 14-15 percent. 
  Carlos Alvarez, Great Front candidate for the federal 
capital, said that residents "voted for ethics and to warn the 
government that it cannot protect those responsible for 
corruption." The vote for punishment for Peronism and for the 
UCR is, according to Alvarez, "a reflection of the people's 
weariness and moral fatigue and who tell the government 
`enough.'" 
  In the rest of the country the victory went to Peronism, 
with 
more than 40 percent, according to polls, while the UCR was 
second. 
  [Hamburg DPA in Spanish at 2201 on 10 April reports from 
Buenos Aires that the Argentine elections "ended this afternoon 
normally." The item adds that "according to Buenos Aires radio 
polls, about 70 percent of eligible voters participated, which 
comprises 21.64 million people with a right to vote." The item 
adds that the historic record shows an average voting attendance 
of 80 percent.]

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 10 Apr (DPA) -- Argentine President 
Carlos Menem highlighted tonight (local time) the victory of the 
ruling Justicialist Party (PJ-Peronism) in the Constituent 
Assembly elections and forecast that the official party and its 
allies would have their own majority in the assembly, which will 
amend the Constitution during the middle of the year. During a 
news conference the president highlighted the PJ victory in 15 
of the country's 23 provinces. 
  The Radical Civic Union (UCR), the main opposition party, 
which Peronism signed a pact with to reform the Constitution in 
common agreement, won in three districts. The other districts 
were won by provincial parties and the Great Front [Frente 
Grande -- FG], a center-left coalition that rejected the pact. 
  Menem stressed that the agreement with the UCR will be 
"strictly adhered to" and that "there is not the slightest" 
danger, despite the force's low performance [preceding word in 
English]. To his way of thinking, the UCR did well in the 
elections. 
  Regarding FG's victory strategy in the federal capital, 
Menem 
considers that this coalition "correctly interpreted" the 
message of the people of Buenos Aires. "We will attempt to make 
certain corrections, because this serves democracy," Menem said. 
  Nevertheless, Menem stressed that Argentina is "not the 
federal capital. [sentence as received] It is a victory that 
can be overcome and I want to congratulate them, but we have to 
reckon with it." Menem said that the FG, which he described as 
"Marxist and Trotskyite" in mid-campaign, can become an 
important force at the national level. He did not rule out 
dialogue with this sector of the opposition. 
  According to the president, the reports of alleged illegal 
dealings by the official Buenos Aires candidate Matilde Menendez 
did not affect results in the capital. "Argentines do not vote 
out of spite," he said. 
  Menem asked himself: "How are we, the winners, going to make 
self-criticism?" Menem was replying to a question about the 
bitter election experience, wherein the ruling party won 42 
percent of the votes, an amount similar to what was attained in 
the October 1993 elections to renew parliament. In this 
connection Menem recalled that Peronism won in the provinces 
that suffered social outbreaks in 1993, such as Santiago del 
Estero or San Luis, where Governor Adolfo Rodriguez Saa was 
involved in a sexual scandal. 
  Regarding the 6 percent who cast blank votes, Menem said 
that 
this made no sense in a country where there is freedom and no 
restrictions.

acknowledging his wrongdoings, announcing his retirement from 
public life, and being politically "crucified" as a result of 
alleged links to drug trafficking, former Bolivian President 
Jaime Paz Zamora decided in the last few hours to break his 
silence and to defend himself. 
  On 26 March, in a televised address to the nation and 
flanked 
by a crucifix, former theology student Paz Zamora acknowledged 
"his mistakes, made in good faith" during his presidential 
administration (1989-1993). In addition, he announced his 
retirement from public life, and therefore, his decision to 
withdraw from running for president in the 1997 elections. 
  However, yesterday Paz Zamora formally requested to make a 
statement "as another citizen, without seeking protection in any 
privileges whatsoever," to the parliamentary commission that has 
proceeded to unmercifully question several fellow party members 
who occupied high-ranking positions during his administration. 
  According to Paz Zamora, his only "sin" that has been proven 
up to now is having cultivated a close and "naive" friendship 
with an alleged drug trafficker who goes by the name of Isac, 
surnamed Chavarria, and alias "Oso," whose habit is to 
constantly bite and gently suck a rosary in public. 
  As result of that friendship, Paz Zamora's main apostles and 
several leading members of the Movement of the Revolutionary 
Left (MIR) were investigated and accused by the police of links 
with drug trafficking and cross-examined by a parliamentary 
commission. 
  All of the former public officials proceeded to defend 
themselves firmly and some of them, such as Susana Seleme, Paz 
Zamora's private secretary during his presidential term, even 
denied on more than three occasions being involved in anything. 
She even described herself as "the biggest victim of good faith 
mistakes" committed by the former president. 
  On the other hand, this past Friday the Bolivian Interior 
Ministry, apparently always well-advised by the U.S. Drug 
Enforcement Administration (DEA), indicated its lack of solid 
evidence in its accusations against the MIR during an appearance 
before the parliamentary investigation commission this past 
Friday. 
  During cross-examination by the parliamentary commission, 
General Renato Lopez, head of the Special Front in the Struggle 
Against Drug Trafficking (FELCN), and Prosecutor Leopoldo Ramos, 
reluctantly admitted that their only evidence was based on 
unsubstantiated accusations made by confessed drug trafficker 
Carmelo "Meco" Dominguez, a former MIR activist arrested during 
Paz Zamora's administration and sentenced to 12 years in prison. 
  Lopez and Ramos even accepted the possibility that they may 
have to publicly apologize to some MIR members because some of 
the accusations that were mysteriously leaked to the media now 
seem not to have any support whatsoever. 
  Nevertheless, up until today, most commentators and 
politicians in Bolivia agree in predicting the inevitable 
political demise of the MIR and its leader, Paz Zamora. 
  Parliamentary Investigation Commission President Edil 
Sandoval, has acknowledged Paz Zamora's request to be 
cross-examined and has announced that the former president could 
present his testimony this coming Tuesday. Based on the content 
of the letter sent to Sandoval, Paz Zamora insinuates that he 
would like to be cross- examined publicly in presence of the 
media, as his fellow party members have been. Their respective 
testimonies were broadcast daily and live by La Paz Radio 
Panamericana. 
  However, the members of the parliamentary commission 
summoned 
a meeting for this Monday to decide if the cross-examination 
will take place publicly or privately in honor of the former 
president's investiture, which would be contrary to Paz Zamora's 
request.

  [Text] La Paz, 7 Apr (EFE) -- Oscar Eid, leader of the 
[Movement of the Revolutionary Left--MIR] party of former 
Bolivian President Jaime Paz Zamora, denounced today illegal 
actions of the antidrug police and the U.S. Embassy in La Paz to 
incriminate him. This occurred after he heard his recorded 
voice in a conversation with the alleged drug trafficker Edgar 
Fernandez who admits that the "situation is f......" [situacion 
j......] 
  Eid testified today for three and a half hours before the 
Constitutional Committee of the Chamber of Deputies that is 
investigating alleged links between the MIR leadership and Isaac 
"Oso" Chavarria who is considered by the Special Antinarcotics 
Force, FELCN, to be the top trafficker in the country. 
  Eid, who is Paz Zamora's right-hand man, surprised the 
committee by indicating that he was summoned by "high officials 
of the U.S. Embassy" in La Paz who handed him a questionnaire on 
the FELCN regarding an alleged trip by Paz Zamora and Chavarria 
to Cuba, and on the whereabouts of Fernandez. 
  The committee members heard a tape recording of phone calls 
by Edgar Fernandez, Chavarria's aide, apparently late in 
February or early in March 1994 to Oscar Eid's house, and to the 
house of former President Paz Zamora in Tarija. 
  Fernandez, in a desperate voice, asks Eid and his party for 
help "to disappear" before the police find him and make him 
appear before the Constitutional Committee because he was sure 
"I will be torn to pieces," in other words all his alibis would 
be discredited. 
  "Please Oscar, please help me," and "get Jaime (Paz Zamora) 
to tell me where to go" Fernandez said in a pitiful tone. But 
in the face of Eid's evasive answer, Fernandez warned: "I have 
not said very much about you," adding "I will not continue to be 
f......" 
  Eid refused to help Fernandez, admitting "we don't know what 
to do" and then repeated: "f....., f....., we are all f......" 
  Eid very confidently confirmed before the committee that 
"those calls were made," adding that Paz Zamora told him that 
similar calls were received in El Picacho, Paz Zamora's ranch 
near Tarija. 
  Eid said that the existence of the recordings confirmed his 
fear that illegal methods were being used to incriminate people. 
  He told the committee: "This is not an accusation against 
the 
embassy" merely information to the deputies regarding his 
presence in the U.S. Embassy to answer a FELCN questionnaire. 
  Eid not only answered the FELCN questionnaire through the 
U.S. Embassy but also traveled to Tarija to obtain Paz Zamora's 
personal confirmation that "he definitely did not go to Cuba" 
with Chavarria. 
  During the three and a half hour interrogation, Eid admitted 
that Chavarria had provided small planes and a wagon during the 
MIR electoral campaign and that he went to Chavarria's farm to 
supervise the drafting of a communique regarding the 
"narco-photograph." 
  This photograph shows Chavarria and Paz Zamora sitting on 
the 
wing of a plane. It was published in 1988, when Bolivian 
politics were shaken by another "narco-scandal" that affected 
two other political parties (the Nationalist Democratic Action 
and the Nationalist Revolutionary Movement). The photograph was 
used to reach an agreement to halt investigations into possible 
links between politicians and drug trafficking. 
  The MIR leader asserted that, on Paz Zamora's instructions, 
he gave Fernandez $9,000 from party funds to pay Chavarria's 
medical bills in La Paz. Franco added that he never accounted 
for this money to anybody but the former president.

  [Text] Prosecutor Jose Nemtala on 29 March confirmed the 
arrest of Victor Poma, alleged member of the Tupac Katari 
Guerrilla Army, EGKT, who is charged with terrorist attacks and 
attacks against the state's security. 
  Nemtala said that Poma was arrested following relentless 
investigation by the state's intelligence services. He declined 
to provide further details or the place where Poma is being held. 
  The EGKT began its terrorist activities in July 1991, with 
the "bombing" of two high tension pylons in the Alto Lima zone 
of the city of El Alto. Poma reportedly participated in this 
attack, which claimed the life of an EGKT member. The 
organization then perpetrated a number of attacks leading to the 
arrest of top leaders: the brothers Raul and Alvaro Garcia, who 
are jailed in the Chonchocoro prison, and Felipe Quispe, known 
as "El Mallku," among others. The state's intelligence services 
are searching for Carlos Lara, who is considered to be a member 
of the EGTK "general staff."

  [Text] Tegucigalpa, 8 Apr (ACAN-EFE) -- Honduran President 
Carlos Roberto Reina said today that the alleged plot to 
assassinate him, hatched by fellow Honduran Luis Hernandez Sosa 
in complicity with three Nicaraguans, is "a case of gangsterism 
and drug trafficking." 
  Speaking briefly with reporters in the city of San Pedro 
Sula 
in northern Honduras, Reina pointed out that the conspirators 
initially intended to set a factory on fire but later thought it 
"a better deal to assassinate the president." "A white book is 
going to be opened to outline in detail everything that has 
happened in this case and the people will be informed," the 
Honduran president said. 
  Reina reiterated that this is a case of "gangsters or drug 
traffickers who came to Honduras to burn down a paint factory 
and then perpetrate a kidnapping, but it occurred to them that 
it might be a better deal to kill the Honduran president." 
  Reina's statements corroborated local media reports to the 
effect that Hernandez Sosa, who yesterday surrendered to the 
authorities accompanied by human rights leaders, is involved in 
drug trafficking. Hernandez Sosa, 30, was turned over to the 
police in Tegucigalpa, who were unaware of his whereabouts, 
after appearing in court escorted by members of the (government) 
National Human Rights Ombudsmanship. 
  The alleged conspirator, who is being held in a special cell 
at the National Penitentiary and under strict surveillance by 
Army troops, pointed out: "It is stupid to think that I wanted 
to murder the president." In a brief message he sent to the 
media today, Hernandez Sosa requested that his family be 
informed that he is well, has faith in God, and will emerge 
unblemished from this case. 
  The newspaper LA PRENSA reported today that Hernandez Sosa 
allegedly hatched the plot against the president to "slip away" 
from a group of alleged drug traffickers to whom he owed money. 
According to this report, Hernandez put the plan together with 
an unspecified quantity of money given to him by cocaine 
addicts, who were now demanding their money. 
  A government source today told ACAN-EFE that there is proof 
of Hernandez Sosa's drug trafficking activities, which will help 
resolve the alleged plot against President Reina, about which 
the Honduran authorities were notified on 13 March by the 
Nicaraguan Government. 
  Meanwhile, two of the three Nicaraguans implicated in the 
plot have been arrested by the Nicaraguan police, who have not 
made any disclosures regarding the depth of their involvement in 
the plot. The detainees are Luis Rene Quintero, who alerted the 
Nicaraguan authorities to the plot and helped thwart it, and 
Santiago Rivas who has denied any involvement. Meanwhile, Roger 
Arguello's whereabouts are unknown. 
  Honduran Armed Forces Chief General Luis Alonso Discua said 
last Wednesday that the investigation of the plot has been 
"dashed" because of the information that has been leaked by the 
press. 
  Certain opposition politicians have not dismissed the 
possibility that the alleged plot against Reina is a "smoke 
screen" to distract the people's attention from the country's 
economic problems.

  [Text] Tegucigalpa, 7 Apr (ACAN-EFE) -- The presumed 
mastermind of the plot to assassinate Honduran President Carlos 
Roberto Reina has voluntarily surrendered to a court in this 
capital on 7 April, a judicial source has confirmed. 
  Luis Hernandez Sosa, 30, surprised the security corps when 
he 
arrived unexpectedly at the First Lower Criminal Court in 
Tegucigalpa at 1600 local (2200 GMT) accompanied by human rights 
leaders. 
  Sosa is linked to a plot to assassinate President Reina 
uncovered on 13 March when Nicaraguan citizen Luis Rene Quintero 
confessed his participation to the Nicaraguan Government 
Ministry. 
  According to Quintero, Honduran Hernandez Sosa hired him 
along with Nicaraguan citizens Santiago Rivas and Roger Arguello 
to kill President Reina for $400,000, as confirmed by Honduran 
military spokesman Colonel Napoleon Santos Aguilar. 
  Members of the Human Rights Commissioner's Office and of the 
court confirmed to ACAN-EFE that Hernandez turned himself in to 
the First Lower Criminal Court in Tegucigalpa. In a brief 
statement to judicial reporters, Hernandez said he is "innocent" 
of all charges.

<F P=106> [Report by Cesar Ubeda Bravo] </F>
  [Text] Nicaraguan President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro 
reiterated once again upon her return from Mexico that "EPS 
[Sandinist People's Army] General Humberto Ortega will step down 
in 1994," thus contradicting the assertions made concurrently by 
Ortega to local reporters at the National Assembly. 
  President Chamorro's remarks prove that military power is 
subject to civilian power and that, as she promised on 2 
September and during her stay in Mexico, the Army chief will 
retire during the course of the year. 
  President Chamorro announced on 2 September 1993 at the Olof 
Palme [Convention Center] that Humberto Ortega would retire this 
year, which prompted a disrespectful reaction from the Ortega 
brothers toward the president in the presence of Latin American 
diplomats. 
  The presidential announcement, which created friction 
between 
the top military commanders and the government, forced the 
Executive Branch to convene an extraordinary emergency meeting 
at the OAS, where the government gained continent-wide support. 
  "Neither Humberto Ortega nor anyone in the Army will retire 
due to U.S. pressures or due to anyone's whim. Within the 
context of the 2 September announcement I will never retire," 
the EPS general emphatically stated after meeting yesterday with 
National Assembly President Dr. Luis Humberto Guzman to discuss 
topics related to the Military Organization Law. "I must clearly 
establish my position regarding the issue of my dismissal under 
pressure. To insist that Humberto Ortega will step down this 
year is to take a superficial view of the Military Organization 
Law," stressed Ortega after adding that he will not leave his 
post under those conditions "out of dignity and principle." 
  Ortega admitted that relations between the Executive Branch 
and EPS "have not been good" since the presidential announcement 
of 2 September. "This does not mean that I am enthroning myself 
as commander of the Armed Forces, but my departure will be 
within the framework of the Constitution and the Military 
Organization Law," the EPS chief added. 
  Article 144 of the Constitution establishes that the 
president of the Republic is the chief of state and government 
and commander in chief of the nation's Defense and Security 
Forces. 
  Questioned about the authority of President Chamorro, who is 
empowered to replace the EPS chief, Ortega replied evasively: 
"It is not a matter of the president removing the EPS chief nor 
of the Army removing the president as has historically occurred 
in Latin America, but we must work harmoniously for the good of 
the nation and avoid falling to extremes," he stated. 
  The high-ranking military officer indicated there is no 
consensus between the EPS and the Executive Branch on the 
aforementioned law. Nevertheless, he refused to specify the 
points of conflict. "The Army wants an agreement on this," he 
underscored. He said it is very probable that an agreement will 
be reached within 15 days so the law can be sent to the 
Legislative Branch. Ortega defiantly said that if no agreement 
is reached in these two weeks, "the EPS will see what course it 
will take," but he refrained from indicating what measures the 
military command would take. 
  He indicated that the Military Organization Law must have 
the 
consensus of the National Assembly, the EPS, and the Executive 
Branch. "We must draw up a strong and firm law among all the 
involved sectors," he said. 
  Meanwhile, National Assembly President Luis Humberto Guzman 
threatened to draw up this law if it does not reach the assembly 
soon. "If the Military Organization Law is not sent to the 
National Assembly in the first half of this year, we will 
proceed to draft it," he said. 
  Guzman said the Nicaraguan people were promised that this 
law 
would be drawn up in the first half of the year, and this 
promise will be kept. "We (the parliament) are not setting a 
deadline for the presentation of the Military Organization Law 
but one cannot wait forever," he stressed. 
  Regarding the removal of Humberto Ortega from the EPS, he 
was 
categoric in stating: "If the president announced that this year 
she would appoint a new EPS chief, that is what must happen. It 
does not merit discussion." "After talking with Ortega, the 
impression I have of him, is that he is aware that his position 
is temporary," Guzman said. This contrasts with Ortega's remarks 
to journalists. Guzman also denied that there is U.S. pressure 
for the removal of the Army chief.

  [Text] President Guillermo Endara said yesterday that under 
no circumstance will he consider renegotiating the 
Torrijos-Carter Treaties to prolong the existence of U.S. 
military bases in Panama beyond the year 2000. 
  Endara's statements followed the arrival of a U.S. mission 
headed by Republican Phil Crane. The U.S. delegation is in 
Panama to collect information from different economic and 
political sectors on the possibility of renegotiating the 
presence of U.S. military bases in Panama. According to the 
Panama Canal treaties, the last U.S. soldier has to leave 
national territory before midnight on 31 December 1999. 
  The U.S. delegation of about 25 people met with President 
Endara yesterday. The delegation also plans to meet with 
different business groups, as well as with the presidential 
candidates for the 8 May elections (Ernesto Perez Balladares, 
Ruben Blades, Mireya Moscoso de Gruber, and Ruben Blades [as 
published]). 
  "They visited me, and I told them I had a promise to fulfill 
for the people--a promise I made in the 1989 campaign, when I 
vowed that during my administration the renegotiation of the 
treaties will not be considered under any circumstance," the 
Panamanian president said. 
  According to Crane, prolonging the presence of U.S. military 
bases along the Panama Canal and in national territory will 
guarantee the security of both countries, as well as the 
security of the entire world. Crane also said Panama would 
benefit economically "because it will simply be a business deal 
between two countries."

  [Text] According to Legislator Leo Gonzalez, it is unfair 
for the U.S. Government to say that drug money laundering in 
Panama has increased. What must be done to dispel all doubts is 
to update all laws dealing with this matter. 
  [Begin Gonzalez recording] Panama has done an excellent job. 
Customs, the PTJ [Technical Judicial Police], and the National 
Police have confiscated large amounts of drugs. A number of 
narcotraffickers have been captured, the country has cooperated 
with the U.S. Government, and the DEA [Drug Enforcement 
Administration] works unimpeded here, which I think is all 
right. We must admit, however, that we have lagged a little 
regarding money laundering. We have experienced trouble with 
money laundering because of our banking center and the Colon 
Free Zone. [end recording] 
  The Legislative Assembly is making every effort to approve 
the new drug bill as soon as possible. Gonzalez said it is 
urgent to pass money laundering legislation as soon as possible. 
  [Begin Gonzalez recording] The only weak link in our 
legislation has to do with money laundering, for which we will 
have to pass special legislation. Yet we are moving in that 
direction. This fight against drug trafficking will not end 
overnight. The important thing is that we are taking firm steps 
to solve this problem. [end recording]

  [Text] Brasilia, 7 Apr (EFE) -- British Foreign Secretary 
Douglas Hurd denied here today having negotiated an agreement to 
sell arms to Brazil during his talks with President Itamar 
Franco and with several Brazilian ministers. 
  Asked about possible negotiations for the sale of British 
arms to the Brazilian Armed Forces, Hurd said in a news 
conference that "no agreement has been made by the two 
governments in this area, but there has been ongoing, steady 
aid" by private companies. 
  Hurd said that he and the Brazilian Army minister, General 
Zenildo de Lucena, discussed the development of "joint work" 
that would enable Great Britain "to help meet the needs of the 
Brazilian Armed Forces." 
  Hurd added that there are "promising areas" for cooperation, 
and that as a British official it was incumbent upon him to 
persuade his Brazilian counterparts. 
  A senior British military official also attended the meeting 
between Hurd and Gen. Lucena. 
  Hurd said he has promoted in Brazil a privatization process 
similar to that which was successfully implemented in his 
country. He added that in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo he 
discussed the possible participation of British businessmen in 
the privatization of state-owned electricity and water companies. 
  Hurd's entourage consists of British businessmen from the 
trade, construction, generator and electricity distributor, 
arms, and fire equipment sectors. 
  Hurd emphasized the need for the two countries to reach 
agreements that would promote trade and economic relations, such 
as the elimination of double taxation, the mutual protection of 
investments, and the solution of controversies. 
  Hurd added that there is heightened interest in Brazil among 
British investors. He also said that he had conveyed to Mines 
and Energy Minister Alexis Stepanenko the desire to transfer 
British know-how to the area of privatization to Brazil. 
  In his meeting with Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero, Hurd 
discussed the Brazilian stabilization program to eradicate 
inflation. 
  Hurd believes that the economic plan formulated by 
Ricupero's 
predecessor -- Social Democratic presidential candidate Fernando 
Henrique Cardoso -- is popular in Brazil. He conveyed his hope 
that the plan might be instrumental in defeating inflation, 
which currently stands at 45.7 percent monthly. 
  He added that in light of Brazil's potential, its economic 
prospects are "fantastic." 
  Brazil is the largest market for British exports in South 
America. Brazil is also the fifth largest recipient of British 
investments, with an estimated total of $2 billion. 
  According to official figures, Great Britain has a deficit 
in 
its bilateral trade with Brazil, because in 1993 its exports 
totaled $662.5 million while its imports of Brazilian products 
totaled $1.3545 billion. 
  British exports increased by 52 percent in 1993 compared 
with 
1992.

  [Text] Brazil and the United Kingdom will sign an 
extradition accord next week. British Foreign Secretary Douglas 
Hurd is examining the Brazilian proposal to create a 
businessmen's forum, but talks between Hurd and Foreign Minister 
Celso Amorim did not stop there. They also discussed the 
environment, free trade zones, and technical cooperation, but 
all attention was indeed focused on the extradition accord. The 
accord has yet to be signed, but according to Minister Celso 
Amorim it will soon become a reality. 
  [Begin Amorim recording] An extradition accord was proposed 
a 
long time ago. The idea was not born after the Paulo Cesar 
Farias affair. The problem is that in the past the United 
Kingdom did not sign extradition accords. That policy has now 
changed, and they do sign this sort of accord. The Farias 
affair, naturally, made the need more urgent. From that affair 
on we began a negotiation process, which is practically 
finished. I believe, however, that there is still a small 
problem regarding coordination among UK Government departments. 
I believe the difficulty resides, practically speaking, in a 
language problem. [end recording] 
  Douglas Hurd has already left for Britain.

  [Excerpts] President Itamar Franco on 7 March told Planning 
Minister Beni Veras to call in specialists of all ministries to 
draft the federal budget. They will replace officials of the 
Budget and Finance Secretariat who have been on strike for the 
last 36 days. "The country will not go without a budget," the 
president said, as he announced that he had stopped payments to 
the strikers. "They will not be paid for the days that they are 
on strike," he stressed. [passage omitted] 
  Legal expert Celso Bastos has said that Franco could be 
impeached [preceding word in English] for not having submitted 
to Congress the necessary documentation for the approval of this 
year's budget. The legal basis for an eventual request of 
impeachment is foreseen in Article No. 85, Paragraph VI of the 
Constitution. This says a crime has been committed if the 
president's actions abuse the budget law. Bastos said the fact 
that the country does not have an approved budget shows that 
Franco has violated the constitutional norm twice: For not 
having given Congress the documentation to approve the budget 
law, and for not permitting it to be approved. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Brasilia -- President Itamar Franco is trying to 
separate the economic plan from the presidential candidacy of 
former Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso (PSDB) [Brazilian 
Social Democracy Party]. He fears that the stabilization 
program, chosen by the PSDB as its main campaign banner, will be 
rejected in Congress for electoral reasons. His main concern is 
the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party], which believes 
the PSDB candidate will be the main beneficiary if inflation is 
curbed. 
  "We need maturity; the stabilization plan is not simply a 
convenient electoral banner, but a national commitment that must 
be complied with, even by future governments, for the benefit of 
the country," Franco said. On 6 April Franco discussed the 
subject during a meeting with Cardoso, Civilian Household 
Minister Henrique Hargreaves, and Deputy Luiz Carlos Santos 
(PMDB-SP) [Sao Paulo], the government leader in the lower house. 
Franco still intends to talk with the government leader in the 
Senate, Pedro Simon (PMDB-RS) [Rio Grande do Sul] and with other 
party leaders. Franco will probably even summon a cabinet 
meeting to explain that the economic plan must not be confused 
with the PSDB candidacy. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Editorial from the "Notes and Information" column: "New </F>
Ministry, Old Problems"] 
  [Excerpts] Provisional Measure [MP] No. 434 is gone, and 
No. 457 has come; and the new finance minister still faces the 
same problems his predecessor had, as Congress still wants to 
modify the MP so as to distort the economic plan. This matter 
was the main subject of analysis during the first workday of 
Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero. In meeting with some of the 
members of the congressional committee that will give an opinion 
on MP 457, Minister Ricupero verified that obstacles still 
exist, and with a further aggravating factor: After the exit of 
Fernando Henrique Cardoso, political interests are still 
hindering the approval of the economic plan. 
  Congress does not consider itself defeated by the executive 
branch triumph in having MP 434 reedited. The electioneering 
congressmen insist on introducing three modifications to the MP: 
a recovery of salary losses, a minimum salary increase, and the 
inclusion of a certain kind of price freeze. The only objective 
of these changes is to make the economic plan not feasible. 
[passage omitted] 
  The problem is that the new finance minister does not have 
Cardoso's ability to convince the congressmen to approve the 
economic plan. The fact that Cardoso is a candidate for 
president of the Republic has increased the number of 
congressmen interested in the failure of the economic plan.

<F P=106> [Editorial from the "Notes and Information" page: "A Job To </F>
Be Finished"] 
  [Text] It could not be expected that from the moment he 
became head of the Finance Ministry, Ambassador Rubens Ricupero 
would present a new economic policy or report in detail his 
plans to continue implementing the FHC2 [Fernando Henrique 
Cardoso Second] plan. In his own words, his main mission is to 
act simply as a successor, not a substitute. His is a very 
delicate duty: to administer a program inherited from someone 
else. This, however, did not prevent him from clarifying that 
although he will be faithful to the process, he plans to give it 
his personal style. 
  He must, nonetheless, firmly become the one in charge of 
implementing an already defined program. With this objective, 
the new finance minister thought it necessary to point out the 
plan's perfection, which reflects the skills of the person who 
masterminded it. He praised his predecessor to show that he was 
thoroughly familiar with the program drafted by Fernando 
Henrique Cardoso. 
  His praise of President Itamar Franco sought to calm those 
who feared he did not have the same Planalto support his 
predecessor had. He emphasized that he could count on the 
president's thorough support "without which," he added, "my work 
would lack effectiveness, and the appointment would have been 
pointless." 
  In the long introduction to his speech, in which he sought 
to 
clearly define the aspects of his mission, the new minister 
tried to characterize his style, although he is aware that he 
will be staying for fewer than nine months at the head of the 
Finance Ministry. He painted this picture in a discreet and 
indirect manner, but made everyone realize that his decisions 
will always be inspired by his social concerns; that is, that it 
will always pursue one objective -- man, in all of his 
dimensions. 
  He made no demagogic promises and pointed out that no 
economic policy can be successful without being preceded by a 
constitutional reform. He added that the absence of this reform 
has been foiling all attempts at adjustment to failure. He 
therefore plans to do his best to ensure that the reform process 
continues. He is even willing to negotiate and temporize to make 
sure that the process will be concluded, particularly because 
unless it is concluded the country will reach a serious impasse. 
  He added, however, that the success of the FHC2 plan does 
not 
depend entirely on the support the Congress or the president of 
the Republic gives it. He thus calls for society's cooperation 
in making the program effective. "The judicial branch, 
state-owned companies, and the governments of states and 
counties, as well as the media, entrepreneurs, workers, and the 
public in general, will all have to contribute to this success," 
Ricupero said. Through this call Minister Ricupero carefully 
established levels of responsibility. It must be noted that the 
judicial branch appears at the top of the list. 
  Rubens Ricupero is giving priority to the moralization of 
public expenditures. He pointed out that if the order given by 
Tancredo Neves at the beginning of the New Republic era -- "it 
is forbidden to spend" -- had been complied with, the country 
would have been in a very different condition. Talking on 
behalf of an administration that holds him responsible for 
fulfilling this task, he said: "We will persevere in the 
relentless pursuit of an operational balance of the budget." We 
are giving emphasis to this sentence because the new minister 
seems to indicate that such a balance -- on which the FHC2 plan 
is based -- has not yet been ensured. As we have said in 
previous commentaries, Rubens Ricupero will certainly pay more 
attention than his predecessor to the public deficit issue, 
which still has not been resolved through the congressional 
approval of the Emergency Social Fund. 
  Perhaps the minister has been daring in announcing that as 
soon as the stabilization is consolidated it will be possible to 
gradually reduce interest rates. Everything indeed indicates 
that for a long time the monetary area officials will have to 
maintain high interest rates to prevent the inflation rate from 
going up too much and making the FHC2 plan fail. Surely the 
president of the Republic, who so far has not been entirely 
conscious of this need, will demand that his new minister 
prevent the inflation rate from going up. While working on the 
monetary problems, Rubens Ricupero announced that in the 
immediate operational plan, he will define rules for issuance of 
the new currency and ways to back the new currency. These rules 
are certainly essential for creating confidence in the real. 
  It would not be fair to conclude an analysis of the speech 
Minister Rubens Ricupero delivered at his installment ceremony 
without pointing out that his concern over social problems 
permeated all his remarks. In his opinion, the problem of an 
unfair distribution of wealth must be urgently solved. He 
however does not plan to correct this situation through a 
populist way of distributing wealth. On the contrary, he 
believes that the success of the anti-inflation effort depends 
on the capacity to reduce social unfairness. We can rest 
assured that as the economic program is implemented, the new 
minister's characteristics will be reaffirmed.

  [Text] Rio -- Edgar Kircher, the Furnas Electric Power 
Plants, Inc. [Furnas] adviser for environmental security, has 
reported that Angra-1 will probably be dismantled in about 15 
years, or in other words around the year 2009. 
  Furnas failed to earn a profit of nearly $100 million (97.7 
billion real cruzeiros) as a result of the fact that the Angra-1 
nuclear plant has been closed for more than a year without 
producing any electrical energy. This energy should have been 
connected to the electricity system serving the southeastern 
region of the country. Angra-1 can produce energy equivalent to 
20 percent of the electricity consumed in the city of Rio de 
Janeiro. Furnas experts said that "this loss is not really a 
loss, but a profit the company failed to make." 
  Angra-1 construction costs totalled about $2 billion, but 
through having been disconnected over 30 times due to faulty 
parts and equipment and to comply with court orders, the plant 
has already forced the government to spend much more than that. 
Exact figures, however, have never been reported. Kleber 
Cosenza, head of the Furnas Power Generation Department, 
reported that Angra-1 fuel -- enriched uranium purchased from 
Urenco (a consortium from Germany, England, and the Netherlands) 
-- alone cost Furnas $20 million last year. Another $5 million 
was spent in repairing the plant. 
  Consenza added that Angra-1 is undergoing final tests for 
being put into operation again in 20 days. According to him, 
the plant is theoretically ready to be put into operation. To 
do so, however, Furnas needs the authorization of the National 
Nuclear Energy Commission and the conclusion of the emergency 
plan to evacuate Angra dos Reis residents in case of an 
accident. The evacuation plan is about to be finished and has 
undergone a series of modifications, Consenza said. 
  Luiz Henrique Goncalves de Moraes, assistant at the Furnas 
Thermonuclear Generation Superintendency, said that this plan 
has to be reviewed so that Angra-1 can again operate. According 
to him, the new plan meets the international requirements that 
state that in case of an accident, residents living in a 3 km 
radius must be evacuated. 
  He reported that the latest data issued by the Brazilian 
Institute for Geography and Statistics, IBGE, indicate that 
nearly 9,000 people live in this area. In accordance with the 
new plan, monitorial teams will determine small areas at a 
radius of 5 km to 15 km around the plant to be isolated. He 
said that in accordance with IBGE data nearly 70,000 people 
currently live in this wider area. 
  On the night of 5 April, Furnas experts visited Angra-1 
facilities during a visit made to the plant by a group of Sao 
Paulo environmental experts.

  [Text] As of today [Carabineros Director] General Rodolfo 
Stange will enjoy a special leave permit. The resolution does 
not state how long he will be on leave. 
  Carabineros sources this morning confirmed that Carabineros 
Director General Rodolfo Stange Oelckers has started his 
vacation. His special leave permit is the result of an agreement 
reached after a lengthy meeting until dawn today between Defense 
Minister Edmundo Perez Yoma and members of the Carabineros high 
command. It was stated that the purpose of this leave permit is 
to make the proceedings more clear and impartial. 
  In addition to the special leave granted to Stange, 
Carabineros Justice Service Director General Carlos Pecchi Croce 
will ask the Court Martial to appoint a special judge to the 
case. It was pointed out that the decision to request the 
appointment of a special judge is based on the so-called 
Cumplido law, and follows a lengthy meeting by Carabineros 
generals. 
  It should be recalled that these decisions were made at dawn 
today following a series of meetings. It should also be 
recalled that last February Gen. Stange took his regular 
vacations. This new leave permit is the result of negotiations 
between the government and Carabineros. 
  This information was confirmed this morning by Carabineros 
sources but there was no official report on what happened at 
dawn today during the meeting between the defense minister and 
members of the Carabineros high command at an undetermined site.

  [Excerpts] After a meeting between Defense Minister Edmundo 
Perez Yoma and members of the Carabineros high command, it was 
officially announced that General Fernando Cordero Rusque has 
assumed duties as acting director general of this institution. 
  This was disclosed after the meeting, when Gen. Cordero 
chatted with the media, at times in a harsh tone of voice. 
  [Begin recording] [Cordero] You have asked me on several 
occasions whether or not I think about the matter. The truth is 
that I do think about it. 
  [Unidentified reporter] No, what I meant is what do you 
think 
about Carabineros officers being charged with unlawful 
association for terrorist purposes? 
  [Cordero] Well, that will be determined by the 
investigations. 
  [Reporter] Yes, but Judge Milton Juica has sentenced several 
Carabineros officers for unlawful association for terrorist 
purposes. 
  [Cordero] Yes. The ruling has not been appealed yet. [end 
recording] 
  Later on, Defense Minister Edmundo Perez Yoma said that the 
government is fully satisfied with the solution to this problem. 
  [Begin recording] [Perez] It is a solution. We always 
maintained we thought it unsuitable that General Stange remained 
head of the institution while the investigations continued. We 
believe the right thing has been done, and greatly appreciate 
Gen. Stange's gesture to request the Supreme Court to appoint a 
special judge to hear the case. This gives him and the public 
guarantees. We are fully satisfied. 
  [Reporter] Does this mean that the National Security Council 
will definitely not be summoned? 
  [Perez] I think so, definitely. [passage omitted] 
  It was not stated how long Gen. Stange will be on leave, but 
Minister Perez did say he would remain on leave until his legal 
situation is resolved.

  [Text] NOTICIAS learned from police sources yesterday that 
alleged Lebanese or Palestinian terrorists entered the country 
through Ciudad del Este during the week to attack the Israeli 
Embassy. Recent events in the Middle East and the possible 
signing of a peace treaty in the conflict area has allegedly 
hurt the interests of terrorists who are trying to boycott it 
through attacks against Jewish people and assets in South 
America and around the world. The police are handling the issue 
with absolute secrecy. 
  The Israeli intelligence service told the National Police 
about the entry of the alleged terrorists into the country. They 
came through Argentina, Uruguay, and Brazil. 
  In Brazil, these individuals allegedly obtained the support 
of some of their people to get false passports and other 
documents, including the famous special permits called "Border 
Controls," which are handled by the border mafia. 
  The National Police ordered the Intelligence Department, the 
Investigative Department, Interpol, and the 4th Zone Police 
Command to carry out an in-depth investigation to locate the 
foreigners. Police Superintendent General Lopez Pintos, director 
of the Technical Support department, said foreigners are 
regularly and routinely controlled. He minimized the importance 
of the issue. 
  Police Superintendent General Santiago Flores Torres, chief 
of the 4th Zone, said his first concern when he assumed the 
command of Canindeyu, Alto Parana, and Itapua Departments, was 
to order a census of foreigners residing in the border zone, 
which is very vulnerable to the entry of undesirable people. 
  "The Immigration Department and this command are strictly 
controlling the situation. We will provide documents to residing 
foreigners and place illegal residents at the disposal of the 
court. We usually make those controls. We have been intensifying 
them in the past few days," Flores Torres said without 
confirming or denying the report on the presence of terrorists 
in the country. 
  According to a reliable police source, the Israeli Embassy 
is 
aware of the possibility and has asked for police reinforcements 
for the guard outside the embassy and the residences of their 
diplomats. 
  The embassy has also allegedly said that the terrorists are 
possibly members of Arab groups who are trying to prevent the 
signing of a peace agreement in the Middle East. They are 
allegedly moved by their interest in the arms trade.

  [Text] San Jose, 5 Mar [date as received] (NOTIMEX) -- Luis 
Fishman, the Costa Rican government and public security 
minister, said today that the DEA had brought alleged Bolivian 
drug kingpin Edgar Fernandez Lozcano into the country. 
  DEA officials brought Fernandez Lozcano into the country 
without consulting local authorities, on a private flight on 16 
March, Minister Fishman said at joint news conference with 
Rafael Angel Guillen, director of the Judicial Investigation 
Agency (OIJ). 
  Fishman and Guillen ended 12 days of silence when Attorney 
General Jose Maria Tijerino announced that he was initiating an 
investigation on "the mysterious conditions under which the 
South American citizen entered" the country. 
  Bolivian drug officials believe Fernandez Lozcano to be the 
right-hand man of Isaac "Oso" Chavarria's -- Bolivia's most 
prominent drug trafficker -- who is charged with bribing 
important politicians in that South American country. 
  Fishman said the Bolivian drug trafficker "arrived in Costa 
Rica aboard a U.S. Government plane with registration number 
N55949." 
  The authorities explained that Bolivians do not require a 
visa to enter Costa Rican territory, but they asserted that "we 
do not know why (the Costa Rican Government) was not informed of 
this matter." 
  According to the Costa Rican officials, the drug kingpin 
stayed at the luxurious San Jose Palace Hotel accompanied by DEA 
officials and three unidentified Bolivian police officers. 
  Fishman said that "the DEA's actions are a blatant abuse by 
this organization" because they did not report Fernandez 
Lozcano's arrival to Costa Rican authorities. 
  Fishman said that Roberto Mendez, director of the Drug 
Investigation and Control Center, has requested an explanation 
of DEA activities from the DEA head in this country. The 
minister also warned that "we will not allow any more of their 
arbitrary actions." 
  Fishman revealed that Fernandez Lozcano had left for the 
United States, escorted by DEA officials, on TACA Airlines 
flight 40 last Sunday. 
  The Costa Rican officials said DEA officials had taken 
Fernandez from Bolivia to Panama, where local authorities denied 
him entry because he did not have a visa. They thus decided to 
bring him to Costa Rica, where Bolivians do not need a visa. 
  The minister justified his office's previous silence on the 
case by saying that "Fernandez is a great witness who apparently 
knows a lot about the ties between drug traffickers and 
politicians in his country. That is why we could not reveal the 
details of his stay in Costa Rica."

  [Text] Guatemala City, 9 Apr (ACAN-EFE) -- Guatemalan 
President Ramiro de Leon Carpio has urged U.S. congressmen to 
pressure the guerrillas and the U.S. Government to ensure 
compliance with human rights agreements and the signing of a 
firm and lasting peace agreement. 
  Government spokesman Felix Loarca today said a group of U.S. 
congressional advisers and officials headed by Robert White met 
privately with De Leon. Loarca added that the president and the 
U.S. officials discussed the human rights situation, the peace 
process, and the struggle against abject poverty that affects 
eight out of every 10 Guatemalans. 
  The congressional advisers asked the government to outline 
ways in which the U.S. Congress might help achieve the signing 
of a peace agreement. In response, De Leon urged them to put 
pressure on their government and the Guatemalan National 
Revolutionary Unity (URNG) guerrillas, Loarca said. The U.S. 
politicians, who also met with Peace Commission President Hector 
Rosada, were here on a private visit, the spokesman added. 
  Meanwhile, former U.S. Ambassador to Guatemala Thomas 
Stroock 
described the human rights situation in this country as being 
"serious," and he added that the future remains "uncertain" 
because of a wave of violence. Stroock arrived in the Guatemalan 
capital on Friday to receive the "Order of Quetzal, Great Cross 
Grade," which President Ramiro de Leon conferred upon him last 
night for his efforts to strengthen relations between the two 
countries. 
  The diplomat said he is "surprised" by the meager flow of 
tourists into this country, noting that some U.S. citizens have 
canceled trips because of prevailing security problems. Stroock 
recalled that in 1990 his government suspended military aid 
because of constant human rights violations, and specifically 
because of the murder of U.S. citizen Michael Devine at the 
hands of Army members. 
  In the wake of the political violence, the Guatemalan 
Congress has urged the United Nations to appoint a special 
rapporteur, but Rosada said the verification mechanism outlined 
in an agreement signed with the URNG is more efficient. Rosada 
contended that the deputies were showing their "ignorance" by 
making this request, because a rapporteur is tantamount to 
receiving a condemnation. 
  Foreign Minister Maritza Ruiz said the request for a 
rapporteur cannot be viewed as an isolated issue, but instead 
should be viewed within the general context of the situation. 
Ruiz thinks it will be difficult for the United Nations to 
appoint a rapporteur because the Commission on Human Rights 
ended its session in February. During its past session, the 
commission decided to extend the mandate of Argentine adviser 
Monica Pinto in light of the efforts being made by the 
government in the area of human rights.

  [Text] The executive branch said yesterday it firmly 
disagrees with a request from Congress to urgently seek the 
appointment of a UN rapporteur for the country. 
  Even though he recognizes the Congress' right to make the 
request and respects the congressional resolution, presidential 
spokesman Felix Loarca reiterated that the resolution runs 
counter to what has been determined by the international 
community. 
  He noted that the 50th Session of the UN Human Rights 
Commission in Geneva, Switzerland, maintained the position of 
appointing an independent expert adviser for Guatemala, ruling 
out the possibility of appointing a rapporteur or other drastic 
action in recognition of the government's efforts. 
  Loarca said the government's intentions and steps to 
consolidate democracy and to continue with the national peace 
and reconciliation process are clear to the people and the 
international community, and, therefore, the call from Congress 
runs counter to this. 
  As for the congressional decision to condemn the executive 
for the attack on Deputy Obdulio Chinchilla, he said he does not 
have any substantive comments to make because he believes the 
people can draw their own conclusions after the government 
showed clear signs of its concerns to guarantee the safety of 
Guatemalan citizens. 
  He said a series of problems have been generated in the 
country over the past three decades; in turn, it is unfair to 
blame this government for the situation when its democratic 
commitment has been demonstrated through abundant proof and 
evidence. 
  He said Congress sometimes overlooks the scope of the 
problem 
and people start thinking we have a magic wand to solve this 
problem, when, in actuality, it has been less than a year since 
we received a government facing one of its worst crises ever. 
  As for death threats against other deputies, Loarca said the 
government condemns all types of violence, regardless of who is 
carrying it out. Likewise, he called upon those people promoting 
these kinds of actions to reflect on the serious damage they are 
inflicting on the democratic reconciliation process.

  [Excerpt] Guatemala City, 8 Mar [date as received] 
(ACAN-EFE) -- Guatemalan President Ramiro de Leon Carpio 
announced today that he will act with a "firm hand" against the 
terrorists, whom he labeled "Neanderthals" who started a wave of 
political violence in the country. He also dismissed the 
possibility of decreeing a state of emergency. 
  "Unfortunately, there are people in Guatemala who think like 
Neanderthals, and for many years they have fought ideas with 
bullets, not with words," he said. Upon reiterating his 
condemnation of the murder of Constitutional Court President 
Epaminondas Gonzalez on 1 April and the attack against Deputy 
Obdulio Chinchilla on Wednesday, De Leon emphasized that he is 
"worried" about the recent violence. 
  "The government rejects any kind of violence and will act 
strongly to counter it," the president told reporters. He added 
that security forces have been given precise instructions to get 
to the bottom of their investigations and find the people 
responsible for Gonzalez's murder and the attack against 
Chinchilla. 
  De Leon pointed out that Guatemala must enter without 
further 
delay a phase of reconciliation to stop the violence and the 
civil war that began in 1960 so it can achieve welfare and 
social development. The president asked the groups causing the 
violence to reconsider and reflect on the "serious damage" they 
are doing the country through their actions. "It is not violence 
but dialogue that will solve our problems," the president 
emphasized. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Guatemala City, 9 Apr (AFP) -- A wave of violence 
in Guatemala, which intensified over the past few weeks, has 
forced President Ramiro De Leon Carpio to request intervention 
by the Army, which will "take to the streets" to support the 
police as part of a government security plan. 
  Defense Minister General Mario Enriquez today confirmed to 
AFP that the Army is willing to participate in the struggle 
against violence, "which has surpassed the limits of normalcy," 
and he explained that a rapid deployment platoon will be created 
to support the National Police. 
  Enriquez and Government Minister Danilo Parinello yesterday 
addressed Congress to explain the measures that will be 
implemented to counteract the wave of violence. [passage omitted]

  [Text] In an urgent communique following the attack against 
Deputy Chinchilla Vega, Human Rights Ombudsman Jorge Mario 
Garcia Laguardia reported the existence of an antidemocracy 
conspiracy and asked the government to use the constitutional 
mechanisms to stop the continuation of these events. 
  Upon condemning the attack against the deputy, Garcia said 
this incident demonstrates an attempt is being made to end the 
democratic system in the country. He added the attack represents 
an unjustifiable action, just like the assassination of 
Magistrate Epaminondas Gonzalez at a time when the government 
and URNG [Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity] signed a 
global human rights accord. 
  The human rights ombudsman demanded the government of the 
Republic end this series of events aimed at disrupting the 
democratic regime. He asked the government to implement the 
constitutional mechanisms; that is, to have security forces 
comply with their duty.

<F P=106> ["Declaration" issued by the Guatemalan National </F>
Revolutionary Unity General Command on 5 April; place not given] 
  [Text] The latest round of negotiations held in Puebla, 
Mexico, allowed the signing of three basic agreements in the 
negotiating process, such as the General Agreement on Human 
Rights, Timetable for the Negotiations, and the joint 
government-URNG [Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity] 
declaration on the issue of a commission to clarify violations 
of human rights. 
  The serious events and incidents that have taken place in 
Guatemala after this signing demand that the URNG General 
Command address national and international opinion to: 
<H5>  Communicate </H5>
  The great satisfaction with having signed the aforementioned 
agreements, which are the result of an intense and difficult 
process, and that they offer a solid and viable base for a 
serious, fair, and in-depth negotiation. [sentence as published] 
  A current General Agreement on Human Rights and its prompt 
verification concern the urgent needs of the country insofar as 
it covers the basic demands of Guatemalans and it opens the 
doors to a new phase in the negotiation process. Full compliance 
with this agreement creates the necessary conditions for all 
sectors of society to find solutions to the current problems. 
  That the value of the General Agreement on Human Rights must 
be evinced through its true implementation and compliance. In 
addition to the obligations pledged by the parties in signing 
this document, the right of the entire population to demand its 
respect and validity becomes legitimate. 
  This agreement has been made possible through our people's 
heroic toil, the substantial efforts and sacrifice of their 
organizations, which express, under totally adverse 
circumstances, their complaints and demands as well as the 
contribution of those who, understanding this situation, have 
abided by and supported it. 
  This pivotal agreement was also made possible thanks to the 
understanding and favorable reception of the international 
community, which with its statement and support helped advance 
it. 
  The General Agreement on Human Rights and the timetable 
agreement cover the entire content of the negotiation. They do 
not mean an end to the conflict, but they constitute a basic 
step in a process that calls for the participation and permanent 
mobilization of all sectors of society to achieve its true and 
practical significance. 
  Compliance with the General Agreement on Human Rights and 
the 
prompt establishment of the agreed verification mechanism by the 
United Nations constitute the first trial by fire of the 
process. The first aspect would make no sense in the absence of 
the second one. 
<H5>  Warning </H5>
  Regarding rights and statements that are alarming and highly 
negative. 
  The heinous assassination of Constitutionality Court 
President Epaminondas Gonzalez on 1 April is condemnable and, in 
the context of the signing of a human rights agreement, 
constitutes a flagrant provocation of Guatemalan society and the 
international community. 
  The statement by President Ramiro de Leon Carpio immediately 
following the signing of the General Agreement on Human Rights 
does not demonstrate his commitment to comply with it, but 
rather his intention of offering the URNG militants amnesty. 
This action conveys the existing contradictions, contravenes the 
negotiation process, and calls into question his political will 
to conclude a negotiation that will bring a just and democratic 
peace. 
  The campaign of misinformation and distortion conducted by 
official and unofficial spokespersons before the signing of the 
General Agreement on Human Rights, and which continues to 
flagrantly seek to discredit the URNG--blaming it for actions 
that have been perpetrated by groups of the Army itself--reveal 
recalcitrant wills that oppose a fair political solution. 
<H5>  Urges and Demands </H5>
  The government of President De Leon Carpio and the Army to 
comply with the General Agreement on Human Rights, thus 
returning the support and trust offered by the international 
community and the national public. 
  That the assassination of the Constitutionality Court 
president, an action that lies within the jurisdiction and scope 
of the security forces, where it originated, be cleared up as 
soon as possible. 
  The threat of imposing a state of exception is part, 
whatever 
its true or presumed justification, of a preconceived plan to 
limit the freedom of expression of civic and popular forces. 
Therefore, it is inadmissible and condemnable. 
  Fair play in the negotiation process is the fundamental 
condition for it to evolve. This is why the Army organizations 
must suspend the psychological war, and the president must not 
lend himself to maneuvers to discredit the URNG as its main 
counterpart in the negotiation process. 
  Nothing must be allowed to curtail the expression of 
Guatemala's civilian sectors. The international community plays 
a highly significant role in ensuring this freedom, and we urge 
it to express its solidarity. 
  [Signed] URNG General Staff: Comandante Rolando Moran; 
Comandante Pablo Monsanto; Comandante Gaspar Ilom; and Carlos 
Gonzales, secretary General of Guatemalan Labor Party Central 
Committee. 
  [Issued] 5 April 1994

  [Text] Lima, 10 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- Peruvian President Alberto 
Fujimori today guaranteed that the rules of the game will be 
"clear" for next year's general elections and said that he has 
still not decided on whether he will run for reelection. 
  "I speak as President of the Republic Alberto Fujimori, not 
as a candidate," the president said in an interview in Sunday's 
"Counterpoint" political program aired on Channel Two. "The 
electoral atmosphere is premature and many things are said that 
deep down are demagogic," Fujimori replied when asked why the 
opposition was so distrustful of fraud. 
  Fujimori stressed that during his tenure three elections 
have 
been held (legislative, municipal, and the referendum on the new 
Constitution). "These elections have been open, unquestionable, 
and approved by international observers and we will continue 
down this line," Fujimori assured. The president said that 
"there must be guarantees that here in Peru free elections will 
be held, with the presence of international observers" and added 
that "the people are the only ones who should decide." 
  According to Fujimori, Javier Perez de Cuellar is "an 
outstanding citizen who has given Peru a good name with his 
work" as UN secretary general. Several conservative opposition 
sectors have said that their possible candidate, capable of 
defeating Fujimori, is the former UN general secretary. Even 
though Perez de Cuellar has not confirmed his candidacy for the 
1995 elections, the Peruvian president "welcomed the virtual 
candidate." 
  Fujimori stressed that elections can be held in Peru because 
"now there is democracy and security" and he refused the 
adjective "authoritarian" to describe his regime. 
  A national poll released today confirmed that there are 
significant differences regarding the approval of Fujimori's 
term and citizens' choice in the next election. According to a 
poll by Imasen, in Lima and the provinces 57.7 percent of the 
population back the president's term, with 31.8 percent 
disapproving. If the elections were held tomorrow and the 
candidates were Fujimori and Perez de Cuellar, the president 
would get 35.1 percent of the votes and Perez de Cuellar 32.9 
percent. The study disclosed that the distance between the 
president and the former UN secretary general is lessening and 
in the provinces the president leads by a much smaller margin. 
  In a runoff election, Perez de Cuellar would win in Lima 
with 
45.7 percent of support, and Fujimori receiving 44.1 percent. In 
the country's interior, the former diplomat would win in 10 of 
the 11 cities polled. 
  Fujimori said "that human rights in Peru are guaranteed" and 
added that the subversive elements are tried effectively, in 
accordance with his government's anti-terrorist legislation. 
The Peruvian president said that the Maoist Shining Path group 
is "totally weakened" and that the desertion of its members who 
are still in the country is "massive." 
  The fight against terrorism will continue with the same 
force, without neglecting the fight against drug trafficking. 
"Without the national pacification, democracy could not have 
been built as we are doing," Fujimori stressed.

  [Text] Former UN Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar 
said it would be premature to talk about a presidential 
candidacy. He said that any candidate would demand that the 
elections be clean and have guarantees. 
  [Begin Perez de Cuellar recording] I did say that any 
candidate who runs for the presidency, or for a seat in the 
unicameral Congress we now have, would demand that the elections 
be clean, that the elections have guarantees. But having said 
that does not mean I have accepted becoming a presidential 
candidate. I believe that would still be a little premature. We 
do not know if the current president will run for reelection; 
that is not known, either. But naturally I cannot fail to say 
that I feel very honored [words indistinct] who believe I could 
represent a democratic solution in the upcoming general 
elections. [end recording] 
  Let us continue to listen to Javier Perez de Cuellar, in an 
exclusive interview with Radio Programas del Peru from Paris. 
Perez de Cuellar said that if he becomes a candidate, he would 
not be a candidate in opposition to President Alberto Fujimori, 
but rather to his government policy. 
  [Begin recording, in progress]...not in opposition to 
President Fujimori, but to a policy, and not necessarily against 
an individual. We are not dealing with an individual. The 
Peruvian problem is not the problem of an individual, it is the 
problem of government, a problem of policy. When I gave you an 
answer, what I meant was that I don't want to be a candidate in 
opposition to the president, if he runs for reelection, but to 
various aspects of his policies. And this is how it should 
be--not an opposition to an individual but to his policy, to his 
government actions. Therefore, if I were a candidate, I would 
not be a candidate in opposition to the president, but in 
opposition to the policies of the current government. [end

  [Text] President Alberto Fujimori announced yesterday a 
salary increase of 40 percent for teachers and health personnel 
with professional degrees, and a 30 to 33 percent increase for 
those without degrees. 
  He also announced that the minimum salary for the private 
sector will go from 72 to 132 new soles as of 1 April, and that 
for public servants the minimum salary will be 300 new soles. 
  According to the presidential announcement, the salary 
increase will represent an additional spending in the budget of 
180 million new soles. 
  President Fujimori indicated that the increase represents a 
partial recovery of the purchasing power of state workers. 
  He added that a decision was also made to increase the 
salaries of the National Police and the Armed Forces, but he did 
not specify by how much. 
  The salary issue was one of the more difficult demands to be 
met by the government. In all the polls done a high percentage 
demanded an urgent salary increase. 
  When the sale of some public companies such as the Peruvian 
Telephone Company was done for more than $2 billion, many 
sectors believed the government was in the condition to increase 
salaries substantially. 
  The president, however, denied this several times, saying 
that the country cannot go back to populist measures. 
  The president said: "Under no circumstances will the income 
from privatizations be used in administrative spending such as 
salary increases." 
  On the contrary, he said, about $1.6 billion will be used on 
what he called "social spending," which was later defined as 
"investment in productive employment." 
  The president also said that the money received from 
privatizations will not be used to pay the foreign debt, and 
therefore it is not clear where the money to pay the announced 
salary increase will come from. 
  Regarding the "minimum salary" of 300 new soles for public 
servants, some leaders expressed their doubts because "for the 
first time the salaries of public servants will be above the 
private sector." 
  Despite the fact that the president said many times that it 
was not necessary to increase the minimum salary "because we are 
in an open market ruled by the law of supply and demand," this 
salary was increased yesterday from 72 to 132 new soles. 
  President Alberto Fujimori also referred to the recent 
election of Colombian President Cesar Gaviria as new OAS 
secretary general. 
  Fujimori said Gaviria would give greater dynamism and a new 
focus to this continental organization, "which for years has 
been involved more in international political discussions." 
  He added that an emphasis on regional integration in the 
fields of economic and commercial development and the struggle 
against drug trafficking are points that will receive special 
treatment by the new OAS secretary general, with whom Fujimori 
shares these concerns. 
  Fujimori then referred to the working tour to be made by 
Efrain Goldenberg, president of the Council of Ministers and 
foreign minister, and Energy and Mines Minister Daniel Hokama 
throughout Asia to promote the investment possibilities offered 
by Peru. 
  Fujimori is confident that as a result of the meetings to be 
held by the ministers with Asian businessmen and investors, they 
will respond with the same enthusiasm found in the Americas and 
Europe to invest in the country. 
  President Fujimori made these comments after dedicating five 
educational centers built by the National Institute of Education 
and Health Infrastructure (Infes) with an investment of 
$1,425,630 from the Public Treasury.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu, who returned to our 
country on 30 March after chairing the OAS assembly, rejected a 
UN report on the "laundering" of drug trafficking money in some 
of our country's free trade zones. 
  Abreu categorically rejected this possibility. Nevertheless, 
he said he would carefully review this issue. 
  Denying the document that circulated in the United Nations, 
the foreign minister stressed: "There is not a single 
possibility for Uruguay to be a drug trafficking center." 
  For his part, Jose Luis Ovalle, the Free Trade Zones 
national 
director, said this document is almost one month old. This 
information has been picked up from the press, he said, adding 
that the entire issue is inaccurate. 
  Abreu also pointed out that during his visit to the United 
States to participate in the OAS General Assembly in which 
current Colombian President Cesar Gaviria was elected new OAS 
secretary general, he met his Argentine counterpart, Guido Di 
Tella, with whom he discussed the Martin Garcia Canal issue. 
  During these talks, compliance with the agreements reached 
by 
the two countries on the Martin Garcia Canal was confirmed, 
Abreu said. 
  Abreu added that Gaviria's appointment as OAS secretary 
general is good news and that his candidacy allowed the 
achievement of a Latin American consensus. 
  Gaviria will step down this year and take over the OAS 
General Secretariat in August. Gaviria's candidacy was 
supported by Uruguay and the rest of the Mercosur [Common Market 
of the South] partners. 
  During Gaviria's campaign, Abreu conducted negotiations to 
enhance a Latin American consensus, a political goal pursued by 
the Uruguayan foreign minister for a long time.

  [Text] Caracas, 10 Apr (AFP)--The Venezuelan Police have 
reported that 10 heavily armed individuals, alleged members of a 
Colombian drug trafficking-guerrilla column, today raided the 
Cachiche-Aramara Airport in Puerto Ayacucho, 520 km southeast of 
Caracas, hijacked a plane, and fled to Colombia. 
  A Caracas Radio Rumbos report indicated that the violent 
attack took place at 0600 (1000 GMT)--a time when more that 
1,000 members of the military and police forces quartered at the 
airport "were sound asleep." According to the radio station, the 
airport's traffic controller, whose name remained undisclosed, 
arrived as the plane was taking off with the attackers on board. 
  It was also reported that the raid by the alleged Colombian 
drug trafficking-guerrilla column took place at a time when 
members of the state security corps were in Puerto Ayacucho 
combing the area to rescue a Venezuelan citizen who was 
kidnapped 10 days ago. The plane, of which no details were 
released, belongs to the regional Puerto Ayacucho government.

  [Text] Caracas, 8 Apr (AFP)--It has been officially 
disclosed that for the very first time the Venezuelan Air Force 
today used war planes to bomb several clandestine landing strips 
used by garimpeiros [Brazilian gold seekers] in the southernmost 
part of the country. 
  Defense Minister General Angel Montero Revette said after a 
meeting with President Rafael Caldera that Tucano airplanes and 
ultramodern F-16 fighter bombers destroyed the landing strips 
with war bombs "to prevent the garimpeiros from violating 
national sovereignty." 
  Although Montero did not disclose how many airplanes were 
used or landing strips destroyed, he said that reconnaissance 
efforts had been conducted previously by land in Sierra de 
Parima and Delgado Chalbaud hill, over 1,100 km south of Caracas 
and virtually on the Brazilian border. 
  The minister stressed that these actions were coordinated 
with the Brazilian Armed Forces. 
  Government sources have disclosed that the Army and 
militarized National Guard also participated in the operation. 
  A week ago National Guard troops clashed with a group of 
garimpeiros. One of the gold seekers was killed, two were 
captured, and four managed to escape.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" report by special correspondent Ernesto Esparza] </F>
  [Excerpts] Tijuana, Baja California -- Self-described 
insurgent Subcommander "Marcos" of the Zapatista National 
Liberation Army [EZLN] is Jesuit Priest Jeronimo Hernandez 
Lopez, according to an investigation by a special federal 
government group that has its center of operations in Chiapas 
State. 
  According to the results obtained from computerized tests, 
photographs, recordings of his voice, physical similarities, and 
videocassettes, it was possible to establish that the enigmatic 
figure who emerged on 1 January in the armed conflict in the 
mountains of Chiapas is a priest of approximately 36 years of 
age. 
  According to confidential information obtained by SUMMA, 
Jeronimo Hernandez Lopez was sent to Chiapas State four years 
ago. However, for over two years no one has known in which 
community he lives. 
  Photographs obtained by this newspaper corroborate the 
results of the investigation conducted by the specialized group, 
which reveals the considerable resemblance and body similarities 
shared by the priest and Subcommander "Marcos." 
  Another piece of information that corroborates this is that 
"Marcos'" guerrilla comrades in the mountains of Chiapas call 
him the "Monk from Altamirano;" furthermore, in the jungle, 
mountains, or in combat, he constantly changed his code to avoid 
being identified. 
  "Marcos'" alleged identity was obtained through operation 
"Identity," for which it was necessary to have a special agent 
infiltrate the EZLN. Through this agent the Federal 
Government's special group learned all of the insurgents' 
tactical moves, especially those of its spokesman who, it is 
said -- behind the [ski] mask he always wears when he appears on 
television or is photographed -- is a Jesuit priest who 
occasionally says mass dressed in white and without a "hood." 
[passage omitted] 
  Jeronimo Hernandez Lopez' curriculum, the investigation 
states, shows that he has always been of a revolutionary bent 
and that when he was sent to Chiapas he welcomed the appointment. 
<H5>  Conscientious Investigation </H5>
  SUMMA gained access to the investigation whereby the 
subcommander's alleged identity was established. The most 
interesting study of all was, unquestionably, the computerized 
physiognomical study because the eyes, forehead, mouth and nose 
of the enigmatic figure were compared with hundreds of faces 
that bore the same characteristics. The task was difficult and 
quite complicated because there was no room for mistakes. 
According to the federal government's theory, the Jesuit priest 
"meets all the requirements" to be Subcommander "Marcos." 
  Another key feature in the establishment of similarities 
between both men was the pockmark or mole that both have between 
the corner of the eyebrow and the eyelid of the right eye. 
Likewise, the sharp and robust nose; skin color; eyes, which 
are light brown; the shape of the mouth; the breadth of the 
forehead is the same; and voice and arm movements. 
  A comparison was made between "Marcos'" voice during the 
interviews he has granted to the electronic media and the voice 
of the Jesuit priest officiating mass. The priest's voice was 
[recorded] during a mass he presumably officiated in Ocosingo 
Municipality several hours after the armed uprising on 31 
December 1993. 
  In his homily on that occasion, Hernandez Lopez said: "We 
will never again allow the murder of a single Indian; to do this 
we must defend ourselves and always remain united at all cost, 
with God's help." 
<H5>  State Secret </H5>
  This investigation, which the Federal Government considers a 
"state secret" and which was already disclosed to the highest 
ranking officials of the current administration, resulted from 
the arduous labor of almost three months. 
  We do not know if, now that the negotiations for stable 
social peace are to resume in Chiapas, this investigation will 
be published, but for the time being SUMMA has done so, not with 
a desire to create confusion over the real identity of 
Subcommander "Marcos," but solely to attest to the veracity of 
this information, which is of national and international 
interest. 
  We are hereby reiterating our desire to be at the 
journalistic forefront in order to serve our readers.

  [Text] Mexico City, [no date as received] Apr (AFP) -- 
Jeronimo Hernandez Lopez, a Jesuit priest, "is not Subcommander 
Marcos," the military chief of the Zapatista guerrillas in the 
southeastern Mexican State of Chiapas, as the daily SUMMA 
reported on Friday. Thus was communicated to AFP by Carlos 
Morfin, member of the Mexican Chapter of the Jesuit Order. The 
Jesuits "strongly condemned" the publication as "totally false," 
given that the priest has been working in a Guatemalan refugee 
camp since 1992; this is why the authorities have his activities 
registered, Morfin added. 
  SUMMA published on Thursday [day as received] on its front 
page a note in which it was reported that Hernandez Lopez was 
Subcommander Marcos. This was based on a federal government 
investigation considered to be a "state secret." According to 
the "secret" report, a computer study of photographs and videos 
established "a great similarity between the Jesuit priest and 
Subcommander Marcos, who hides his face behind a ski mask. 
  Hernandez Lopez, 36, is registered with the Mexican 
Commission for Aid to Refugees, as the authorities demand of all 
those who work in the Guatemalan refugee camps, Morfin stressed. 
From 5 August 1992 to 5 April 1994, Father Hernandez Lopez was 
assigned to provide pastoral ministry to the Guatemalan refugees 
in the State of Campeche, in southern Mexico, Morfin explained 
in an official Jesuit Order communique, subsequently sent to 
AFP. Since 5 April he was transferred to Chiapas to cooperate 
in a project the Jesuits have in Bachajon hamlet, the communique 
adds. Morfin said that Lopez's new transfer "had been reported 
to Diego Valadez, attorney general of the republic, and 
Government Secretary Jorge Carpizo, as several days ago he had 
been interviewed and photographed by national security agents 
who wanted to confirm his location and place of work." 
  The Jesuits "strongly condemned SUMMA's report," indicating 
"it is not very professional to generate slander and insecurity 
stemming from false reports, without indicating who is 
responsible for the mentioned investigation." It added that "it 
was very serious to involve the federal government in general. 
This publication is added to a long list of false accusations, 
orchestrated by some media." 
  The Jesuit member said they fear for the priest's security 
after publication of the newspaper report; therefore they have 
talked with the nation's authorities to clear up the matter.

  [Text] San Cristobal de Las Cases, Chiapas, 3 Apr -- 
Chiapas interim Governor Javier Lopez Moreno today said that the 
delays in the peace talks are causing uncertainty and that 
Chiapas natives should not be subjected to such anxiety. 
  At the inauguration of the Spring Peace Fair, Lopez Moreno 
said: "There is a collective need for the second phase of the 
dialogue to start soon." This is why he reported that within 
the next 48 hours he will meet with Peace Commissioner Camacho 
Solis. 
  Meanwhile, Felipe Aguirre Franco, bishop of the Tuxtla 
Gutierrez Dioceses, urged the federal government to speed up the 
release of 21 "alleged Zapatists" who have been staging a hunger 
strike at Cerro Hueco Penitentiary since last Friday. The 
bishop indicated that no matter what the circumstances are, 
justice must be applied within the framework of the 
Constitution, "freely, swiftly, and expeditiously." 
  In Tapachula, Felipe Arizmedi Esquivel used his Easter 
message to urge the faithful not to give up hope. He said: 
"Although the rock at the Holy Sepulcher was heavy, Jesus rose 
from the dead. Courage, do not give up!" 
  He said: Since 1 January, we have lived in a state of 
anxiety, doubt, and fear. All of us have asked ourselves: What 
is going to happen? What violence is going to continue to be 
unleash? When will we enjoy an honest and true peace? 
  Arizmendi said that what is being felt at the state level 
has 
been felt nationwide since the murder in Tijuana. It seems that 
a very heavy object fell on us, like the enormous rock that 
covered the Holy Sepulcher. 
  He added: There is a feeling of uncertainty, defeat, and 
pessimism, as if a solution to the problem cannot be found -- as 
if we are buried in an abyss without hope. 
  Nevertheless, he said, this bleak outlook will be 
transformed 
because "the one crucified has risen from the dead.... Do not 
fear... He will lead you." Indeed, Christ could not be 
defeated. He is the Lord of life and the Lord of history, 
Arizmendi added in his Easter message. 
  This is why we want a new, just, fraternal, united, and 
pacified Chiapas and Mexico. We must all bury injustice, 
discrimination, verbal and physical violence, corruption, lies, 
and arrogance. 
  He insisted: It is necessary to crucify egoism, arrogance, 
envy, hatred, and the desire for vengeance, and we must open our 
arms for pardon and reconciliation! Arizmendi noted: Chiapas 
can rise! Mexico can rise! 
  For the first time in three months, hundreds of people met 
at 
the main plaza. More than to mark the initiation of the 
traditional fair, the meeting was highlighted by the hope of 
creating a fitting climate to enable peace to dwell forever in 
San Cristobal. 
  The collective effort carried out during Easter week was 
designed to ease the tense climate, and it had a tranquilizing 
effect that caused faith to return. The smile of the fair's 
queen, "Maria de la Luz," was enough to raise the spirit of 
those who believe that it will be difficult to smile again in 
San Cristobal de las Casas. 
  Shortly after placing the crown on and delivering the 
scepter 
to the queen of the fair, Governor Javier Lopez Moreno pleaded 
for San Cristobal to become "to a greater extent a center of 
civilized coexistence among ethnic groups, religions, and 
ideologies." 
  He said the city is not simply a common meeting ground for 
the outlying communities. He said he hoped that "this fair will 
be an sign, an announcement of what is to come. A peace that is 
tolled by the bells and nurtured enthusiastically by us is an 
active peace for all."

<F P=106> [From the "ACIR Radio News" Newscast] </F>
  [Text] The current big question is: What is happening to 
peace in Chiapas? The answer remains silence. After 15 days 
away, Peace and Reconciliation Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis 
has returned to Chiapas. Chiapas Governor Javier Lopez Moreno 
seems worried because the situation is worsening with regard to 
the governability of the state. Juan Carlos Santoyo has this to 
report. 
  [Begin recording] [Santoyo] It was a very important meeting, 
called to evaluate state governmental actions, to strengthen 
peace negotiations. What is the meaning of this meeting? 
Manuel Camacho Solis readdressed the Chiapas issue, especially 
its peace process, for the first time after 23 years, I mean, 
after 15 days. 
  The first person to speak at the meeting was the Chiapas 
attorney general; the Chiapas Supreme Court of Justice president 
and the Chiapas Congress president also spoke. The three 
Chiapas Government officials pointed out that the main thing to 
do is to reform the Constitution, as well as state laws ranging 
from labor to agricultural justice. They also talked about the 
creation of an Indian Rights Ombudsman's Office. All these 
issues combined will make the Javier Lopez Moreno government 
submit more than 13 draft bills to the state congress. These 
drafts will probably be made public on 12 April. 
  The meeting laid down the guidelines for the governor to air 
a panorama that, as you already mentioned, is very difficult for 
Chiapas. Lopez Moreno said: We are experiencing a crisis; 
better yet, the crisis already experienced us. This crisis can 
belittle or change us should we behave as we usually do; that 
is, should we behave as though nothing happened. 
  Governor Lopez added: What we are currently facing is not 
the exception to what usually happens. The state government is 
reacting according to nonconformities, because we cannot halt 
legitimate rebelliousness, or at least, we cannot constrain 
social energy. Agricultural laws are about to be modified to 
improve the daily life of Chiapas residents. Searching for 
peace must mean that all Chiapas social sectors have to truly 
work hard. He said something very important: In view of what 
the EZLN [Zapatista National Liberation Front] did, it is 
imperative to humanize power in Chiapas. This will constitute a 
great lesson for all federal government and presidential 
candidates. Governor Lopez concluded that humanizing power 
means accepting that power must be shared and that people must 
be patiently listened to, especially those who complain and 
stage protests. However, for Javier Lopez Moreno, the important 
aspect of the meeting was the message he delivered to the peace 
commissioner: 
  [Lopez] Mr. Manuel Camacho Solis: We are ready; we are 
already moving forward, and so are the commitments. This is how 
we are heeding social complaints to embark on an authentic 
agrarian justice, on flesh and bone human rights, on effective 
law enforcement, and on holding honest elections. These are 
democratic commitments that will lead us to reach genuine peace. 
We Chiapas residents will continue to comply with such 
commitments. Now, it is your turn. We ask you to resume 
negotiations with the EZLN as soon as possible; we ask Bishop 
Samuel Ruiz to resume his great efforts. The truce is good, but 
peace is urgently needed. Uncertainty and unfounded reports 
have saturated our atmosphere since the aberrant murder of Luis 
Donaldo Colosio; only peace will end ambiguity. 
  No Chiapas resident wants hostilities to return. Reinstating 
war would be even worse, because we will lose everything, 
including our future, should weapons replace understanding. We 
refuse to accept the silence of rifles; we want them to 
disappear for good. This is why we are struggling for justice 
to reemerge. We have no time to waste. No one must lose the 
war; we all must win peace. Commissioner Camacho, you have the 
last word; it is your turn. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Juan Carlos Santollo; from the "Radio ACIR </F>
Newscast"] 
  [Text] In answer to questions on whether he plans to 
continue as part of the pacification process, Manuel Camacho 
Solis, commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas, 
said the following: 
  [Begin Camacho Solis recording] The governor [Javier Lopez 
Moreno] has told me: We are elated with just hearing you say 
that there is no cease-fire process that has lasted longer than 
the one in Chiapas. We acknowledge that this is a very 
significant step which, during the past decade, did not occur in 
any Central American nation, or with any similar armed group. 
However this not the only thing we want. We are calling for 
and demanding more. In this respect I say to the governor, and 
at the same time answer a question that is floating around, that 
yours truly has no intention of retreating to any embassy. 
Yours truly plans to remain in Mexico, and wants to remain in 
Chiapas because he believes that the people who are doing things 
here are doing it in good faith and intelligently. Yours truly 
also believes that there are issues to be solved here that are 
worth solving, and because he intends to continue working for 
peace. [end recording] 
  Without any doubt, one of the important questions 
surrounding 
this issue is related to when the peace talks will resume. When 
will the EZLN [Zapatista National Liberation Army]; peace 
mediator Samuel Ruiz, bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas; and 
Special Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis once again sit 
at a negotiating table? In this respect, Camacho Solis' reply 
was as follows: 
  [Begin Camacho Solis recording] I am also aware that this is 
the most important effort we can make because by safeguarding 
the negotiation process with the EZLN, and respecting their 
decisionmaking process, I am sure that in the next few weeks we 
will be able to take further and firm steps to ensure lasting 
peace. [applause] Who will accomplish this? The peace 
commissioner? No. The mediator? No. This will be accomplished 
by all of us. Every individual, every household that can come up 
with an answer. When abuses by the authorities are amended, then 
we already have someone who is working for peace. Every 
resolution by a magistrate or a judge that carries this same 
spirit, is already supporting the peace process. [end recording] 
  Manuel Camacho Solis indicated that by adding all these 
dispositions, and with the support of the president of the 
republic, as well as all the political forces committed to 
peace, there is no reason why progress in the Chiapas peace 
process cannot be made.

  [Text] Mexico City, 10 Apr (AFP) -- Subcommander Marcos, 
the military chief of the Zapatist National Liberation Army 
[EZLN], says no conditions currently exist that permit the 
resumption of peace talks with the government or allow the EZLN 
to continue consultations within the Indian communities on the 
government's proposals, according to today's edition of LA 
JORNADA. 
  The newspaper quoted the rebel leader as saying: "There is 
movement among Mexican Army troops to cut off EZLN forces in the 
zone" in which the EZLN maintains control over various 
communities. 
  The guerrillas and the government held their first round of 
talks 21 February-1 March. At the conclusion of the talks, the 
two sides issued a list of 32 commitments (rebel demands and 
government proposals). The EZLN then opened discussions among 
the Indian communities on the government's proposals, but this 
activity was suspended following the 23 March assassination of 
ruling party presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio. 
  Marcos indicated that in order for the consultations to 
resume, "it is necessary for the Army to reduce its presence and 
for the ranchers, businessmen, and politicians to suppress their 
belligerence, at least to the level that existed before the 
dialogue." 
  Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis recently said peace 
talks could resume within the next few weeks, but Marcos insists 
that new conditions are required. The guerrillas have denounced 
a series of alleged aggressions by the cattlemen, including the 
killing of an EZLN member by a rancher in Altamirano 
Municipality.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with EZLN Subcommander Marcos by Jesusa </F>
Cervantes; from the "jungles of Chiapas"; date not given] 
  [Text] If Manuel Camacho Solis is removed from the Chiapas 
peace negotiations, the National Zapatist Liberation Army [EZLN] 
will break off its dialogue with the government, according to 
the EZLN's Subcommander Marcos. 
  Asked about the latest turn of events in the nation, 
including the slaying of Luis Donaldo Colosio and the nomination 
of presidential candidate Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, 
Subcommander Marcos said the government is either preparing for 
the Institutional Revolutionary Party's [PRI] honorable defeat 
or for a great electoral fraud. 
  As for the peace commissioner, Marcos said his removal would 
bog down efforts to find a peaceful, political solution to the 
armed conflict that began on 1 January. The subcommander said: 
"The removal of Camacho from the peace talks would force a break 
in the dialogue. If they bring in someone else, we would have 
to approve him, just as we approved Camacho, subjecting him to 
the same process. The worst part of all this, however, would be 
that the whole process would drag on and on." 
  Marcos, who is in charge of the EZLN's military strategy, 
said that at the start of the peace talks, the EZLN thought the 
government would force it into a confrontation with belligerent 
groups of businessmen and ranchers in Chiapas, while ordering 
the Mexican Army to sit on the sidelines and watch. 
  "At that time, we thought there was a move afoot against 
Camacho. We thought attempts were being made to force an impasse 
in the dialogue and to force a break in the cease-fire in order 
that the political cost would fall on Camacho at a time when 
there was talk that he might decide to become a presidential 
candidate," Marcos pointed out. "Then came the incident with 
Colosio, and we thought there were plans to blame us for the 
assassination, for ordering his assassination, or for creating 
an atmosphere of violence leading to his assassination. We 
thought military actions against us would start at that time," 
he added. 
  Subcommander Marcos argued that Colosio Murrieta's 
assassination was ordered from within the government, which now 
appears as the only entity capable of guaranteeing order and of 
preventing this type of violence from continuing. 
  "The government knew of the attack; perhaps it knew about it 
but allowed it to happen because Colosio's commitment to 
security was too uncertain at a time when the country was not 
calm," he said. 
  "On one hand, I think the state and Salinas greatly 
benefited 
from Colosio's death, but on the other, they were hurt by the 
ensuing political instability and the loss of international 
prestige, because they proved they were unable to protect their 
own candidate. It certainly left Camacho Solis out of the 
picture," Marcos said. He added that with the assassination of 
the PRI candidate, the PRI not only took Camacho out of the 
political picture, but it also recovered the newspaper headlines 
-- an ideological priority. Finally, he said, the PRI came to 
be viewed as a victim instead of an aggressor. 
  With Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon's nomination, 
Subcommander 
Marcos said he believes it is doubtful that Zedillo will be able 
to conduct a strong political campaign and win the election. 
"When Colosio was killed, we thought it would weaken Camacho's 
position and the government's alleged negotiating position, but 
when Zedillo entered the race, it did not make sense because 
with this candidate the PRI will not be able to fend off the 
other contenders," he said. 
  "If the PRI continues with Zedillo, of whom nothing is known 
other than the textbook scandal and the fraud committed in 
Chiapas by his relatives, then only two things are possible: 
Either the government is preparing for the PRI's honorable 
defeat or it is preparing a very, very large fraud -- an 
unprecedented fraud," he said. 
  What does not make sense, the subcommander said, is to plan 
an electoral fraud, because then the entire nation would rise 
up, the problem could no longer be blamed on the EZLN or Aburto, 
and the war would definitely continue. If the PRI is trying to 
open the door for democracy in the political arena, it should 
have nominated a transitional candidate, and, in this case, the 
logical candidate would have been Camacho Solis. 
  Marcos said: "If the PRI would ultimately decide to share 
power or agree to a democratic opening in the electoral game, 
the logical thing would be for it to nominate a transitional 
candidate, in this case a solidarity candidate. The logical one 
would be Camacho, despite everything the PRI might want to 
impose on Camacho following Colosio's death." 
  He explained, "Camacho would be the logical candidate 
because 
he has insisted that he would maintain Salinas' economic 
project." The subcommander said, however, that a political 
change would lead to a change in economic policy, which would 
contradict the neoliberals. 
  He added: "No one can be a political democrat and an 
economic 
tyrant. Reforms within the same general guidelines would have 
to be made. Reforms in social spending and income distribution 
would have to be made, but this would run against neoliberal 
thinking," he said. 
  The subcommander said he doubts a Camacho Solis candidacy is 
possible at this time: "I do not know if he will decide to run. 
I have not seen him for a long time, but I think that 
ultimately the decision will not be his to make. He is waiting 
for a signal from someone, perhaps from a sector within the PRI 
or Salinas himself. At any rate, he will let time pass, but I do 
not think it will be until 21 July [date as published]." 
  Finally, as for the invitation presented to the presidential 
candidates before Colosio's assassination to visit EZLN 
territory, the rebel subcommander said the situation has changed 
in accordance with what the Clandestine Indian Revolutionary 
Committee-General Command has already announced. However, 
Marcos added, it might be possible for the EZLN to obtain safe 
conduct guarantees for its delegates so they can participate in 
a meeting with the candidates or for the presidential candidates 
to send representatives to EZLN-held areas. 
  Marcos said: "We had planned to invite the candidates here, 
but we have changed our minds. This is because if they are shot 
while they are in this region of the country, we would be blamed 
for it. Can you imagine what would happen if they were to be 
shot here?" 
  Marcos added: "What we could do is to request safe conduct 
guarantees so that some committee delegates could participate in 
a meeting at a certain place and talk with the candidates, or 
for the candidates to send representatives so that they could 
outline their positions regarding the agreements presented by 
the government in case these agreements are accepted by the 
EZLN."

  [Text] Mexico City, 9 Apr (DPA) -- A leader of the Zapatist 
National Liberation Army (EZLN) was killed yesterday by a 
rancher in Altamirano municipality, Chiapas State, the EZLN 
Clandestine Revolutionary Committee reported today. 
  In a statement published by the EXCELSIOR News Agency, 
guerrilla spokesman Subcommander Marcos said this action 
contradicts the alleged climate of peace to which Manuel Camacho 
Solis, commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas, has 
referred. Nevertheless, the cease-fire will be maintained. 
  According to the statement, the EZLN leader went with a 
companion to see a parcel of land to farm. When they arrived at 
the site, they were met with shots fired by the ranch owner's 
son. The leader's companion was wounded.

  [Text] Five members of the Zapatist National Liberation 
Army [EZLN] were killed in a clash with cattlemen in Comitan, 
Chiapas. In San Cristobal de las Casas, EZLN forces demanded the 
release of 21 civilians accused of being EZLN members from Cerro 
Hueco Prison. Patricial Serrano filed this report: 
  [Serrano] Five EZLN members were killed during three clashes 
in Comitan Municipality, Chiapas States. The incidents occurred 
when EZLN members trespassed on the ranchers' properties to 
rustle cattle. The ranchers reacted immediately to save their 
property and the lives of their families. 
  Upon being informed of these events, Subcommander Marcos 
confirmed from an undisclosed location in Lacandon jungle that 
indeed two [number as heard] EZLN supporters were killed in 
clashes with ranchers. 
  Meanwhile in San Cristobal de las Casas, the EZLN demanded 
the release of 21 civilians from El Cerezo de Cerro Hueco Prison 
who were arrested on suspicion of being EZLN members. From that 
place, Subcommander Marcos also said that keeping these innocent 
individuals in jail is an obstacle to peace talks with the 
federal government. Marcos stated that the indiscriminate 
arrest of civilians on unfounded charges that they are members 
of the EZLN is an arbitrary action. 
  Ceremonies, parades, marches, and festivities were held in 
Chiapas on Sunday to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the 
death of revolutionary leader Emiliano Zapata.

  [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas (Mexico), 9 Apr (EFE) -- 
Today the rebel Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN) 
demanded the release of 21 civilians imprisoned since January, 
charged with being Zapatistas. 
  "We have learned that the 21 civilians are confined at the 
Cerro Hueco prison, unfairly charged with being members of our 
army; furthermore the EZLN leadership hereby declares that none 
of its members are currently in any of the country's prisons," 
the rebel Subcommander Marcos stated. In a communique signed by 
the subcommander published today by some morning newspapers in 
the State of Chiapas, southeastern Mexico, the EZLN insists that 
it has verified its list of fighters and the names of the 
persons currently in prison do not appear on the list. 
  The 21 civilians were taken prisoner on 2 January, during 
the 
armed clashes between the Army and the rebels. In addition, 
they were all charged with being EZLN members, accusations which 
they have all repeatedly denied. Since last week, the civilians 
detained at the Cerro Hueco prison near Tuxtla Gutierrez began a 
hunger strike demanding that the charges be withdrawn and they 
be released. 
  The civilians are also demanding an investigation and that 
penalties be imposed on a group of soldiers who, according to 
the prisoners, proceeded to beat them, tied their hands and 
feet, and held them isolated and without food for several days 
before throwing them in jail. 
  According to Marcos "to continue holding these innocent 
persons in jail is an obstacle to continuing the peace process 
and dialogue with the federal government." Finally, Marcos 
indicated that the EZLN believes that with these detentions 
"there is a clear intention to cover up arbitrary actions in the 
indiscriminate arrest of civilians during the conflict and 
accusing them, without any basis whatsoever, of being members of 
our army."

  [Text] After several weeks of silence, the Zapatist 
National Liberation Army [EZLN] issued another communique on 7 
April. The Clandestine Indian Revolutionary Committee-General 
Command [CCRI-CG] of the EZLN issued a communique dated 7 April, 
which includes five basic points. 
  The first point states that in recent days EZLN members have 
learned that 21 civilians are being held at Cerro Hueco 
Penitentiary and are wrongfully accused of being EZLN members. 
  The second point states that following the release of the 
EZLN fighters, who are under arrest in Chihuahua, the EZLN has 
no other guerrillas in government prisons. 
  The third point states that the EZLN General Command has 
carefully reviewed its lists of combatants and that the names of 
those who are being wrongfully detained at Cerro Hueco 
Penitentiary are not on those lists. 
  In the fourth point, the EZLN denounces government plans to 
arbitrarily cover up the indiscriminate arrest of civilians 
during the conflict by accusing them without proof of belonging 
to to the EZLN. 
  In the fifth point, which is a warning to the authorities, 
the EZLN warns that if these 21 prisoners continue to be held, 
the detentions will be an obstacle to continuing the dialogue 
process, because the EZLN cannot speak of peace if the 
government speaks of war with its actions. 
  It also notes that the CCRI-CG communique is signed by 
Subcommander Marcos.

  [Text] Mexico City, 10 Apr (DPA) -- Thousands of Mexicans 
marched today in the capital city to commemorate revolutionary 
peasant Emiliano Zapata, murdered 75 years ago. 
  With a march along Reforma Central Avenue to the Zocalo, the 
demonstration -- which included peasant organizations from all 
over Mexico as well as leftist groups based in the capital city 
-- also protested the reforms made to Article 27 of the Mexican 
Constitution which now allows the privatization of the so called 
"land tenures" [ejidos]. 
  Zapata, born in the State of Morelos, south of Mexico City, 
was a leading figure during the Mexican revolution (1910-1917). 
He became famous as a result of his cry "land and liberty" as 
well as because he demanded the distribution of large estates 
among the peasants. He was murdered in an ambush on 10 April 
1919. 
  Since this Mexican revolutionary and national hero's name 
was 
adopted by the Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN), some 
of the protesters openly expressed their support for the Chiapas 
guerrilla group that took up arms on 1 January 1994. Several of 
the signs held by the protesters read: "Zapata lives in the 
EZLN." Other signs carried the revolutionary hero's image, and 
expressed support for a "Government by the EZLN, the workers, 
peasants, and people's organizations." In addition to shouts 
such as "Here, there, Zapata will prevail," there were also 
shouts condemning the North American Free Trade Agreement 
(NAFTA) between Mexico, the United States, and Canada which 
entered into effect this year. 
  In the meantime, during a commemoration ceremony that took 
place at the Topanzolco Municipal Auditorium in Morelos, 
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari said that many of Zapata's 
aspirations have come through. "However, Mexico changed, new 
problems arose as well as new opportunities, the Mexican rural 
sector changed, and our peasants also changed," Salinas pointed 
out in justifying the much criticized reforms to Article 27 of 
the Constitution which now allows the privatization of state 
land tenures established by the Mexican agrarian reform. 
  The president highlighted that "prior to modifying Article 
27 
of the Constitution, we proceeded to discuss it exhaustively 
with the peasant organizations." Likewise, the president ruled 
out fears related to the reappearance of large estates. "The 
large estates will not reappear, they disappeared from our 
country's history," the president indicated.

  [Text] Members of peasant, Indian, and mass organizations 
from various states marched today from the Altar to the 
Fatherland Monument to the Zocalo to mark the 75th anniversary 
of the death of General Emiliano Zapata. The march, which began 
at 1110 and ended at 1420, was held without incident. Walls 
along the route were painted with social demands. The march 
passed along important Mexico City avenues such as Reforma, 
Insurgentes, and Juarez. The police reported that some 300 
officers were deployed along the route to maintain order and

<F P=106> ["Text" of communique issued by the Prosecutor General's </F>
Office in Santa Fe de Bogota on 7 April] 
  [Text] In view of the wrong interpretations that some media 
have made regarding the letter sent by Prosecutor General 
Gustavo de Greiff to Honorable Judge Sterling Johnson, the 
Prosecutor General's Office states the following: 
  1. [number as published] The Prosecutor General's Office, in 
its missive, simply provided the honorable judge with a piece of 
information requested by the defense lawyers of Mr. Dandenys 
Munoz Mosquera in the sense that a person being prosecuted in 
Colombia had claimed responsibility for the unfortunate 
incidents surrounding the bomb attack on Avianca Flight No. 203 
and that no charges had been filed against the person being 
prosecuted in the United States. 
  Constitutional mandate (Article 250) states that in Colombia 
the Prosecutor General's Office is compelled to investigate both 
the favorable as well as unfavorable elements surrounding the 
case of an indicted person, and, as a result, the prosecutor 
general contends it is his duty to inform the honorable U.S. 
judge about the information being requested by the defense 
lawyers of Mr. Munoz Mosquera without attempting to meddle in 
the judge's jurisdiction, let alone to assume the defense of a 
person being prosecuted in another country. That is why the 
information provided by the Prosecutor General's Office does not 
contain statements but, rather, specific verifiable facts that 
should be taken into consideration by those in charge of 
determining the person's culpability in the incidents. 
  Just as in the past, the Colombian Prosecutor General's 
Office has provided the documents requested by the U.S. Justice 
Department that led to the correct identification of Dandenys 
Munoz Mosquera and to his sentencing in that country for the 
crime of providing false identification. The office has also 
provided the list of charges that have been brought against him 
in Colombia, including charges against him for his participation 
in a band of paid assassins and the judicial charges against him 
for the possession of weapons and for assisting in a prison 
escape. In this case, at the request of Munoz's defense 
attorneys, the prosecutor general is referring to a specific 
incident, the Avianca case, for which Munoz is not responsible, 
according to the evidence on the case contained in our country's 
files.

  [Text] Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff is disappointed 
with everything and everyone and is very seriously considering 
the possibility of resigning. This is our newscast's 
confidential report. The serious dispute between Prosecutor 
General Gustavo de Greiff and U.S. Government authorities in the 
past days, added to his differences with top officials in 
President Cesar Gaviria's government on all his recent actions, 
has brought up the possibility of his resignation. 
  According to information obtained by this newscast, de 
Greiff 
is seriously considering the possibility of officially tendering 
his resignation next Monday, when he returns from the United 
States. Entirely trustworthy sources have asserted that the 
prosecutor general will resign because he is disappointed with 
what he has called the Colombian Government's lack of solidarity 
in confronting strong criticism by U.S. authorities who accuse 
him of being weak in his negotiations with the drug traffickers. 
  This newscast has also established that next week, the 
prosecutor general will also present a long document in which he 
will clarify his actions with legal arguments and point out that 
all his measures have been in accord with the strict 
implementation of the new criminal law. Prosecutor General de 
Grieff and the Supreme Court chief justice met today to discuss 
the need to strengthen this law. 
  In addition, de Grieff will declare that the Prosecutor 
General's Office is being hindered in continuing the 
investigation of the attack on the Avianca plane and will ask 
the government to appoint ad hoc officials to this case, which 
caused his differences with the United States to increase.

  [Text] Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff has said that 
his office "has never intended to tell the United States how its 
judges should try its cases or how to evaluate evidence sent 
there. "I have never said that the U.S. Justice Department is 
uncommonly charitable toward drug traffickers." 
  As for U.S. Justice Department officials, De Greiff pointed 
out he has never said that one of them "met clandestinely with a 
drug cartel chief, and I have never made similar charges against 
U.S. executive branch officials or a senator." 
  The prosecutor general argued that neither his review of a 
possible long-term drug legalization program nor his demand that 
the industrialized countries -- particularly the United States 
-- make greater efforts in the fight against drugs was ever 
intended "to discredit U.S. officials, or to tell the U.S. 
attorney general how to enforce the law, much less intend to 
attribute slanderous remarks to her." 
  These statements are included in a 30 March letter De Greiff 
sent to President Cesar Gaviria to explain his position on 
remarks Gaviria made in an interview he granted to this 
newspaper. 
  When asked about whether the executive branch was completely 
independent with regard to drug trafficking in light of 
statements made by the U.S. drug czar and Attorney General Janet 
Reno, both of whom commented on how the Cali Cartel should be 
dealt with, the Colombian head of state replied as follows: 
  "We must understand that judicial cooperation is a very 
difficult process and that the two countries' judicial systems 
are different. The U.S. Justice Department has significant 
differences with the Prosecutor General's Office. In the past, 
the executive branch also had differences of opinion, but I 
believe we are overcoming these now. Nevertheless, we cannot be 
surprised by this. 
  "The president is usually very careful when he issues an 
opinion with regard to U.S. counternarcotics policies. However, 
the Prosecutor General's Office does not always react in the 
same manner. If this happens here, then we must expect to 
receive criticism from over there." 
<H5>  Prosecutor General's Letter </H5>
  In response to President Gaviria's comments, De Greiff sent 
him the following letter: 
  In the 30 March issue of EL TIEMPO, you said you are careful 
when you comment on U.S. internal policies on fighting drug 
trafficking, but that the Prosecutor General's Office is not 
always careful. It is very clear to me that these remarks also 
insinuate that it is acceptable for U.S. officials to express 
their opinions on our ability to fight drug trafficking. 
  Let me tell you that the United States does not behave in 
this manner, because the Prosecutor General's Office -- 
especially me -- has never intended to tell the United States 
how its judges should try its cases or how to evaluate evidence 
sent there. I have never said that the U.S. Justice Department 
-- much less its main representative -- is uncommonly charitable 
toward drug traffickers. In addition, we have never claimed that 
this department met clandestinely with a drug cartel chief, and 
I have never made similar charges against U.S. executive branch 
officials or a senator. 
  It seems to me that all of this is very different from 
saying 
the way in which we are waging the war against drug trafficking 
has proven unsuccessful, that we should study the possibility of 
legalizing drugs in the long term to reduce drug traffickers' 
profits, and that drug-consuming countries (especially the 
United States) have failed to do enough to curtail drug 
consumption. In none of these statements, however, did I intend 
to discredit U.S. officials, or to tell the U.S. attorney 
general how to enforce the law, much less intend to attribute 
slanderous remarks to her. 
  So you see, there is a difference! 
  [Signed] Gustavo de Greiff

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Attorney General Carlos Gustavo </F>
Arrieta by Caracol news director Dario Arizmendi in Santa Fe de 
Bogota on 8 April; from "Caracol's 0600 to 0900" newscast--live] 
  [Excerpts] [Arizmendi] We greet Attorney General Carlos 
Gustavo Arrieta. Good day. 
  [Arrieta] Good morning, Dario. How are you? 
  [Arizmendi] In the last few hours you reiterated the thesis 
you maintained in Congress during discussion of the new Penal 
Procedure Code, in the sense the approved provisions were going 
to create confusion, ambiguity, and would lend themselves to 
criticism from national and international public opinion. Have 
your statements been corroborated in practice? 
  [Arrieta] You know the Attorney General's Office has 
maintained a position in this regard for a long time. We 
believe if this country wants to develop a serious and coherent 
criminal policy on the drug struggle, it must have solid and 
strong regulations that permit it to advance in this matter. I 
think this does not exist. 
  The Attorney General's Office has stated on several 
occasions 
the Penal Code is weak and does not establish appropriate 
sentences for drug trafficking crimes, and the Penal Procedure 
Code is a confused and profuse regulation. It does not 
establish clear procedures, and if it is handled 
inappropriately, it could lead to impunity. 
  [Arizmendi] What would have to be done to strengthen this 
Penal Code and establish appropriate sentences to avoid what is 
happening? 
  [Arrieta] I believe the country must definitely undertake an 
integral project to reform the Penal Code and the Penal 
Procedure Code. I am not aiming at a large project to modify 
all the provisions, but coherent legislation should be issued 
regarding drug trafficking. 
  Something very worrisome is taking place. As violence 
increased during the last six or seven years, occasional 
legislative reactions have sprung up, and new and different 
provisions have been issued. A judge or attorney must now apply 
60 or 70 different provisions concerning drug trafficking in 
order to understand the norm or applicable situation in a 
particular case; this creates confusion and does not produce the 
necessary clarity in dealing with this matter. 
  Naturally, the country's problem is not related to 
regulations only, but it has many additional aspects. One of 
the first steps that would have to be taken is a definite 
integration, coherently and systematically, with existing 
legislation so as to tighten sentences and clarify procedures. 
  [Arizmendi] A unanimous decision by the various 
organizations 
would be required, namely, from the Justice Ministry, the 
Prosecutor General's Office, and the Attorney General's Office; 
this agreement does not exist. 
  [Arrieta] I think this requires an effort by all concerned 
organizations, not only the government, judiciary, or Attorney 
General's Office but also Congress, which is ultimately 
responsible for issuing the codes. I believe the gravity of the 
circumstances and the questioning of Colombia justify an 
unvarying and strong reaction from all Colombians to show that 
this country is not a narcodemocracy. We must demonstrate this 
is a country that is indeed ready to fight drug trafficking. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Arizmendi] Colombia at this moment is in the eye of the 
U.S. 
media and many U.S. congressmen. The country is well aware of 
the letter exchanges between the Prosecutor General's Office and 
the U.S. attorney general, the response of the Colombian 
ambassador to Washington to THE WASHINGTON POST's article by 
Senator Kerry. In sum, does this confusion and confrontation 
originate in the verbal recklessness of the prosecutor or 
existing regulations? 
  [Arrieta] I think there are many factors that come into play 
here. I think we are facing a problem that has evolved for no 
reason. From basic discussions on legalization issues we have 
gone to such expressions as narcodemocracy or the questioning of 
Colombian justice. I think this is the right time to end this. 
  I do not know what the cause is and cannot offer a specific 
solution. The cause may be a combination of the factors you 
mentioned. The absolute truth is I, as attorney general and a 
Colombian citizen, cannot allow this to continue. We have 
reached such harsh terms as the ones we have seen in recent days 
without any justification. The [word indistinct] has snowballed 
into such dimensions I believe we must put a definitive end to 
this, because this is affecting not only the functioning of 
Colombian institutions but relations with the United States. 
This may have more serious effects we cannot foresee at this 
moment. 
  Our responsibility is to end this problem. We must not act 
separately, but we must act in a coordinated manner. 
  [Arizmendi] How can we end this problem, and how can we act 
in a coordinated manner? Who is the one out of line? 
  [Arrieta] I told you earlier I will issue a communique today 
on that issue. In it, we will adopt a position on this matter. 
We will provide a complete picture of what has happened, but at 
this moment I believe it is fundamental for us to make an effort 
so that the situation will not continue to intensify and does 
not affect all Colombians. [passage omitted] 
  [Arizmendi] Let's address the case against General Jesus 
Armando Arias Cabrales [army commander who ordered troops to 
take back the Justice Palace from rebel control in 1985], whose 
discharge was requested in 1990. You affirmed that decision 
three years ago. Is there a difference of opinion between the 
executive branch and the Attorney General's Office on this issue? 
  [Arrieta] In this particular case the Attorney General's 
Office has no other option but to request application of a 
decision the Attorney General's Office had previously taken. We 
conducted a detailed evaluation of the situation and arrived at 
the conclusion there were no legal means of modifying the 
decision. Eventually it came to where there was no legal way to 
avoid carrying out the order the Attorney General's Office had 
issued in 1990. 
  [Arizmendi] What does it mean to an Army general to be 
discharged as repeatedly ordered by the Attorney General's 
Office? 
  [Arrieta] It is a heavy blow. In this specific case it 
involves removal from his current post, something which will 
create rather difficult and complex problems for him and the 
institution. 
  [Arizmendi] Does this mean Gen. Cabrales is the only one 
responsible for what the government troops did during the events 
at the Justice Palace? 
  [Arrieta] Allow me to explain. When I first assumed my 
post, I took on the challenge of studying the decision by the 
previous Attorney General's Office. I had several doubts about 
the investigation. I felt they did not dig deep enough in 
certain areas. I felt if they had gone a little further we 
might have seen slightly different results in certain matters; 
this does not mean Cabrales is not responsible for anything at 
all. It means the investigation did not go far enough regarding 
whether certain decisions were really made and, in particular, 
who took the specific decisions regarding the operations that 
took place in the bathroom between the third and fourth floor of 
the palace, which is where the events to which the Attorney 
General's Office objected occurred. 
  In a disciplinary action such as this, we can no longer 
claim 
these doubts. The terms for filing such claims were prescribed 
in 1990. We have tried to clarify certain facts, but we have 
been unable to make it work as swiftly as we would have 
preferred. Given we were unable to make it work and in light of 
the specific laws that order the fulfillment of rulings issued 
at the Attorney General's Office, we decided to apply the 
Attorney General's Office ruling as originally issued. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Arizmendi] Mr. Attorney General, turning to another topic, 
and going back somewhat to what we were talking about at the 
beginning of our conversation, you said on television last night 
that at this time you do not think the conditions or 
circumstances exist for new surrenders of Cali Cartel drug 
traffickers. On what basis did you make this statement? 
  [Arrieta] I think what we discussed a short while ago 
sufficiently supports this. I do not think the conditions exist 
at this specific time. The environment is not the appropriate 
one. There is a great distrust and prejudice; there is great 
concern about the whole topic. I think the most important thing 
is to calm the waters again, to have the authorities sit down 
and agree on policy and then proceed with the surrender to 
justice program. 
  In these days, at this particular moment, I think the 
atmosphere is too heated to make a surrender to justice process 
feasible. I am not setting a time limit; this might be solved 
in eight, 10, 15 days or in one or two months. What I have 
always said is that the surrender to justice policy is important 
for the country. It is useful. I think that as Colombians we 
should try to move forward with it, with clear and firm rules, 
but as circumstances stand at this time, with the level of 
debates taking place both nationally and internationally, I 
think there should be at least a halt, a temporary halt, which 
might last a few days or somewhat longer, according to [words 
indistinct]. 
  [Arizmendi] In other words, we might say the attorney 
general 
is proposing the process of surrender to justice by the drug 
traffickers be frozen until there is an agreement, juridical or 
political, to make the sentences against these drug traffickers 
harsher or more rigorous? 
  [Arrieta] I cannot propose that it be frozen, among other 
things, simply because the legal provisions exist and they 
establish the possibilities of surrender; therefore, if tomorrow 
an individual presents himself before a prosecutor or judge of 
the country, there is no other alternative but to receive him. 
What I think is that regarding a broad case, such as that of 
the Cali Cartel, which has political and juridical [word 
indistinct] and which requires full coordination among all the 
authorities, I do not think it would be appropriate to advance 
with this process until we reach agreement on all the parameters 
under which we should act. As soon as that occurs, something 
which might be done very rapidly, then we could-- if this is 
what is desired--continue with that process. At this time, at a 
time of debate, when the atmosphere is heated, and when 
positions are not entirely clear, I think, however, it would not 
be appropriate, because the country would simply not understand 
it, precisely because of the prevailing climate of distrust and 
confusion. 
  [Arizmendi] You said the legal provisions exist, evidently 
in 
the Penal Code and the Penal Procedures Code. You also said in 
the past the surrender to justice policy has ended, replaced by 
the codes. If the sentences are evidently so minimal, 
ridiculous, and short as certain U.S. authorities assert, one 
might then think this is exactly the best time for the Cali 
Cartel drug traffickers to surrender massively before the codes 
are reformed and made harsher. 
  [Arrieta] Of course, of course. That is the position they 
[not further identified] might want. I think our position, as a 
state, is precisely to try to design all the mechanisms so there 
will be a surrender process, but one that will not create any 
feeling of impunity under any viewpoint. Of course, what you 
mentioned is part of the dilemma that always arises. On the one 
hand, there are a number of people who want to take advantage of 
the law for their own benefit; this is inevitable and is the 
reason why lawyers, procedures, and legal provisions exist. On 
the other hand, there is the state, which has the responsibility 
to fulfill its social function and to ensure those legal 
provisions are applied the best way possible. What I am 
suggesting is that there be a review of the overall reform of 
the legal provisions so that we can have a Penal Code, 
procedural provisions, and a surrender to justice policy which 
are clear and which do not produce any kind of impunity. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Arizmendi] Why is the prosecutor general the only one 
taking all the flak when all he is really doing is interpreting 
and applying code provisions. In Congress you courageously 
warned the country about what was coming, and unfortunately time 
has shown you were right. But the prosecutor general was not 
the one who drew up the codes. It was Congress, and in Congress 
Justice Minister Andres Gonzalez even changed the meaning of 
certain bills, and he defended what was finally approved in 
Congress. Now the prosecutor general is the one being 
criticized when the government was also involved in what was 
finally approved. The government signed the law. 
  [Arrieta] I think one has to put this issue back into 
perspective. If one looks at what has been taking place in the 
past two or three months, there have not really been new 
(?actions) in the application of the Penal and Penal Procedures 
Codes. There has been debate, and it has been growing, but only 
based on topics that are not directly linked to the Penal 
Procedures Code, such as the issue of legalization and the issue 
of whether the struggle against drug trafficking has worked. 
All of this has led us to a debate that involves not only 
thinking about aspects of policy but also aspects of norms. 
  I agree with you in part that a portion of the problem is 
not 
only caused by isolated actions but also by the very existence 
of legal provisions which are not clear and are inappropriate; 
therefore, what we propose is that we halt a debate that is not 
taking us anywhere. With the increase in crime, what we 
Colombians must do is form a barrier, a united front, with 
everyone confronting the problem. Facing the problem entails a 
review of legal provisions to resolve all those vacuums, all 
those weaknesses that might exist in the codes. It entails 
acting in a coordinated way, because it is a problem of national 
interest, which not only involves one institution but all 
Colombians. 
  [Arizmendi] Lastly, Mr. Attorney General, and thank you for 
your willingness to speak with Caracol network so extensively 
about such relevant topics, I would like to know whether the 
Attorney General's Office knows the names of the infiltrator in 
the Prosecutor General's Office, who the State Department says 
belongs to the Cali Cartel, and four high-ranking government 
officials, who the State Department said last night also work 
for the Cali Cartel? 
  [Arrieta] I want to make a comment regarding the question. 
In the State Department report, it is said the Colombian 
Government is studying the fourth-ranking person in the office 
of what they call the Attorney General [preceding two words in 
English]. The Americans make a distinction between the office 
of the Attorney General [preceding two words in English], which 
is the Attorney General's Office [Procuraduria General de la 
Nacion], and the office of the Prosecutor General [preceding two 
words in English], which is the Prosecutor General's Office 
[Fiscal General de la Nacion]. When they said the 
fourth-ranking person in the office of the Attorney General 
[preceding two words in English] was being investigated, they 
were referring to what they called the fourth- ranking person in 
the Attorney General's Office. It is a case that for us has 
been extremely mortifying and painful. It is the case of Dr. 
(Guillermo Villa). They were not referring to a person in the 
Prosecutor General's Office but to a person in the Attorney 
General's Office. It is a case that is well known and has been 
sufficiently debated by public opinion. I think it is important 
that this be clarified, because shadows of doubt should not be 
cast over other people. Regarding the other four people who 
might be investigated, I do not have information about them. 
  [Arizmendi] In the case of Dr. (Guillermo Villa Alzate), who 
you just mentioned, what is happening? 
  [Arrieta] I think the process is about to conclude. The 
final phases of the evidence period are being carried out, and, 
as far as the Attorney General's Office is concerned, I hope 
that in the course of the next few weeks, at the latest in one 
or two months, a definitive decision is going to be made.

  [Text] At the request of the Attorney General's Office, 
President Cesar Gaviria today ordered the dismissal of General 
Jesus Armando Arias Cabrales, who led the counterattack on the 
Justice Palace [which was taken over by the M-19 in November 
1985]. Defense Minister [Rafael Pardo] sent a letter to the 
attorney general expressing his disagreement with the decision. 
  Defense Minister Pardo established his ministry's position 
on 
the dismissal of Gen. Arias Cabrales. He said he will obey the 
order but disagrees with it. Why? First, he said that Gen. 
Arias Cabrales only fulfilled a legal duty and carried out a 
legitimate order from his superiors. Pardo insists that the top 
commanders were fully aware of the operation and could have 
stopped it. 
  Second, says Pardo, Gen. Arias Cabrales' responsibility in 
the case is not entirely clear because the criminal 
investigation has not been concluded that an inquiry ordered by 
the prosecutor appointed by the Attorney General's Office is 
still pending. 
  The "National Newscast" has learned that the purpose of this 
inquiry is to find out who gave Gen. Arias Cabrales his orders, 
who was in the chain of command, and who planned the attack on 
the bathroom where several hostages died.

  [Text] Flor del Monte (Colombia), 9 Apr (EFE) -- The 
Socialist Renewal Movement (CRS) today became the fifth 
Colombian guerrilla organization to reach a peace agreement with 
the government within the past four years. 
  Government representatives and leaders of the CRS -- a 
dissident group once under the Marxist Army of National 
Liberation (ELN) -- today signed an agreement incorporating 
about 850 members of this organization -- 430 of whom were 
bearing weapons -- into national political and institutional 
life. The agreement was signed in Flor del Monte (northern 
Colombia). 
  On 9 March 1990, the 19th April Movement became the first 
group to lay down its weapons. It was followed by the Popular 
Liberation Army (EPL) in March 1991, the People's Revolutionary 
Party (PRT) in April 1991, and the Quintin Lame Indians Movement 
in May 1991. 
  The weapons surrender ceremony in Flor del Monte (Sucre) was 
attended by a dozen ambassadors, politicians from all parties, 
delegations from domestic and international organizations, and 
Catholic Church representatives -- all of whom attended as 
observers. 
  The activities marking this event began on 8 April with the 
collection and inventory of weapons and ammunition under the 
supervision of an international oversight group established to 
monitor compliance with the agreements. The Dutch Government 
and Socialist International are members of this oversight group. 
  The weapons will be smelted and turned into bells for 
churches located in the pacified zone. Meanwhile, the 
ammunition was spent when the rebels fired all of their weapons 
into the air. In all, some 450 weapons were emptied, including 
rifles, submachine guns, revolvers, and pistols of various 
calibers. The last remaining weapons, which are in the hands of 
some 50 men, will be surrendered in two parts -- today during 
the main ceremony and, later, when the combatants start to 
abandon their camp. 
  After the ceremonies, which included cultural activities and 
a symbolic farewell to arms, the Flor del Monte camp will be 
dismantled and the former combatants will immediately depart for 
different regions to establish political headquarters and work 
places. 
  The Arco Iris Foundation, which was established by the 
guerrillas, will coordinate the integration process. It will be 
in charge of channeling funds to various programs, including 
programs aimed at promoting small businesses and farms. 
  The CRS also will be entitled to two seats in the Chamber of 
Representatives. 
  Some 430 members of this group are in the camp, and there 
are 
another 221 in various prisons. There are also about 200 people 
who have been giving the CRS political and logistical support. 
Most of these people have been investigated for subversion. 
Now, they also will enjoy legal benefits. 
  The negotiations included eight areas: human rights, civic 
participation, economic consensus, regional development, 
economic and social integration, political benefits, legal 
benefits, and the surrender of weapons. 
  The CRS emerged five years ago following a split within the 
ELN. The ELN is a Marxist guerrilla group led by former Spanish 
priest Manuel Perez. Some commanders had criticized the 
philosophy, methods, and procedures used by the group's central 
leadership. Based on these major differences, a dissident group 
known initially as "The Patch" [El Parche] emerged. 
  The ELN dissidents mainly disagreed with making the struggle 
more military than political and focusing it on the countryside 
and not in urban centers. They also disapproved of the strategy 
of using terrorism and kidnapping to promote the war against the 
state. 
  Following the CRS demobilization, there are still some 
10,000 
active guerrillas, mostly under the Communist Revolutionary 
Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), the ELN, and a dissident group 
of the EPL.

<F P=106> [Report by Patricia Uribe from the "NTC News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The peace process ended today in Flor del Monte, 
Sucre Department, when members of the Socialist Renewal Movement 
[CRS] -- a dissident faction of the National Liberation Army -- 
turned over their weapons to the government minister and the 
presidential peace adviser. 
  Beginning today, more than 400 CRS guerrillas will lay down 
their weapons and join in a new sociopolitical movement. Those 
present at the ceremony included government representatives, 
ambassadors, and, for the first time in the peace process, 
international observers from the Netherlands. These 400 rebels 
will turn over their weapons, some of which will be smelted and 
others thrown into the sea. The two sides today agreed that 300 
weapons will be turned over, even though a document being 
finalized by the CRS states there are 450 weapons. One of the 
important points agreed to between the government and the CRS 
has to do with legal benefits. 
  [Begin unidentified official recording] Pardons for 
kidnappers have been ruled out. We believe kidnapping is a 
crime that cannot be justified, not even for political ends. 
[end recording] 
  Meanwhile, according the CRS leadership, this process should 
provide an example to the CNGSB [Simon Bolivar National 
Guerrilla Coordinating Board]. A verification commission 
comprising government and CRS representatives and international 
observers will verify compliance with the peace agreement every 
four months. 
  The signing of the peace agreement makes the CRS the fourth 
rebel group that Colombian President Cesar Gaviria Trujillo has 
convinced to join civilian life during his administration.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 4 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- The Colombian 
company ECOPETROL stopped pumping crude oil through the Cano 
Limon-Covenas pipeline, the country's largest, after a new 
attack by the guerrillas. 
  ECOPETROL sources said the sabotage, which caused a moderate 
fire and spilled an unspecified quantity of crude oil, occurred 
at Km 150 between Arauquita and La Esmeralda, near the border 
with Venezuela. 
  According to the report, members of the National Liberation 
Army detonated three dynamite charges against the pipeline, 
damaging a sizable portion thereof and forcing suspension of the 
pumping, a suspension that will continue until it is repaired in 
a few days. 
  Colombia's oil infrastructure has become one of the Simon 
Bolivar Guerrilla Coordinating Board's main targets. The 
guerrilla organization is attempting to thwart the oil exporting 
of multinational enterprises. 
  Authorities of Arauca Department, where the recently 
discovered Cusiana oil fields are located, mounted a strong 
security operation to preclude new attacks.

  [Text] The U.S. Government ratified its immigration policy 
on Cubans who try to enter that nation through third countries. 
Mike McCurry, spokesman for the U.S. State Department, said that 
the U.S. Government will continue denying U.S. entry to those 
Cubans who use third countries to achieve that purpose. McCurry 
pointed out that U.S. immigration policy will remain unchanged, 
while defending the decision of the U.S. Coast Guard to return 
to the Bahamas 19 Cubans who on 12 April tried to enter U.S. 
territory from those Caribbean islands. 
  The U.S State Department spokesman admitted that crossing 
the 
sea by Cubans who abandon the island in boats or fragile vessels 
is not safe, but is a threat to their lives. Cuban authorities, 
on the other hand, believe that Washington encourages the 
illegal departure of Cubans by breaking the migration agreements 
that establish a concession of up to 20,000 visas per year. 
  Wayne Smith, former head of the U.S. Interests Section in 
Havana and an expert on Cuban issues, from the International 
Center for International Policies, stated that the U.S. 
Government has even systematically denied visas to people who 
have traveled to the United States in the past.

  [Text] The 125th anniversary of the first Constitution of 
the Cuban Republic at War was observed on 10 April in Guaimaro, 
the town that witnessed this historic event in Camaguey 
Province. The Mambi reveille once again stirred the heart. It 
summoned the independence movement of 125 years ago today. It is 
a symbol of the unity of all Cubans around their Revolution and 
Fidel. 
  Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada, president of the National 
Assembly of the People's Government [ANPP], stressed during the 
political and cultural ceremony marking the 125th anniversary of 
the Constitution, the heroism of those who in the midst of the 
struggle selflessly fashioned a republic with altruism, for a 
just fatherland and equality among men. 
  [Begin Alarcon recording] When on May Day, the ANPP special 
session meets to examine the nation's main problems, it will be 
rendering homage to our heroic and devoted workers, but it will 
also be a tribute to those who founded the fatherland and held 
its first meeting here. The ANPP session, like the one in 
Guaimaro, will achieve a consensus of ideas for the struggle, 
and in the midst of the struggle; from it, we will emerge as in 
Guaimaro, with a renewed fighting spirit, with strengthened 
unity, with a will bolstered to wage today's battle with the 
energy, dedication, and dignity of the men of 1868. [end

  [Text] Representatives from ARENA [Nationalist Republican 
Alliance] have asked the Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE) to 
recheck the vote count in the presidential election and correct 
mistakes that have been observed. 
  Dr. Sergio Mena Mendez, ARENA's legal representative, 
presented to the TSE General Secretariat a petition to 
investigate the vote count because, according to ARENA's count, 
there is a difference of more than 38,000 votes that cannot be 
found anywhere. 
  Mena Mendez said his party knows perfectly well that the 
deadline to contest the election results has expired, and that 
it only wants the TSE to correct the mistakes that were made to 
prevent them from being repeated in the runoff. 
  Mena Mendez said that after the final results of the vote 
count for deputies were disclosed, members of ARENA discovered 
an inexplicable difference of more than 38,000 votes between the 
figures for deputies and the figures for president. 
  According to party representatives, this difference of 
38,000 
votes resulted from "a computation error at a specific number of 
voting tables in San Salvador Municipality; it is an error that 
affects all of the parties." 
  Mena Mendez said the party does not know where the error 
could have occurred, and this is precisely what it is asking the 
TSE to investigate. 
  As is well-known, all of the polling stations were manned by 
a representative from each party, and because of this, it is 
nearly inconceivable that more than 38,000 votes could have been 
lost, including the vote count certificates that are signed by 
each of the party representatives. 
  Mena Mendez argues that there were more votes for deputies 
than for president which, according to ARENA, is unusual. 
Nevertheless, the trend is proportional in terms votes garnered 
by the respective parties. In other words, all of the parties 
received more votes for deputies than for president. 
  Meanwhile, TSE President Dr. Luis Arturo Zaldivar said the 
deadline to contest the presidential election results has 
already expired, adding that ARENA's request is "completely out 
of place." 
  Furthermore, he denied that such a mistake occurred at the 
TSE computation center. 
  Following is a breakdown in the different number of voters 
announced by ARENA in the election for mayors, deputies, and 
president in San Salvador Municipality:

  [Text] Tegucigalpa, 10 Mar [date as received] (ACAN-EFE) -- 
Honduran Army Chief General Luis Alonso Discua has ordered the 
reinforcement of the nation's border with Nicaragua and ordered 
troops to answer "with force" any armed groups of Nicaraguan 
recontras. 
  A clash with these groups left three people dead on 8 April. 
A Honduran corporal and two Nicaraguan guerrillas died in the 
clash between a recontra group and the 9th Infantry Battalion 
headquartered in Ojo de Agua in northeastern Honduras. 
  Colonel Hernan Seaman, 9th Infantry Battalion commander, 
told 
ACAN-EFE: "At dawn, the border had an increased military 
presence because of Gen. Discua's orders. He ordered us to use 
force and to repel the recontras to guarantee the safety of 
people residing along the border." 
  The officer said the armed Nicaraguans who entered the 
country "are criminal contra fighters who hid their weapons 
following their 1990 demobilization." He added: "They are 
currently attacking small businessmen, whom they targeted when 
the contras were in Honduras, and are murdering peasants, raping 
women, and raiding border towns." 
  According to a Honduran military report, some 12-15 men 
brandishing "AK-47's, FAL rifles, and RPG-7 grenade launchers" 
opened fire on an Army patrol on 8 April in the area of 
Chilamates along the Nicaraguan border. Seaman pointed out that 
Cpl. Santos Armando Dominguez, 21, died during the clash, as 
well as two "recontras"; other attackers were wounded and 
returned to their country. Cpl. Rodriguez was buried today in 
the eastern city of Danli with honors corresponding to a "hero 
who died while carrying out his duties." He was posthumously 
promoted to sergeant. 
  Seaman also said that two weeks ago, two recontras attacked 
a 
Buenos Aires woman, whom they murdered by shooting her in the 
mouth after stealing her television and radio. They later fought 
with one of the victim's sons, who wounded one of the recontras 
with a machete. The other recontra then shot the son. 
  Col. Seaman added that Nicaraguan authorities were notified 
and that the two recontras were apprehended at a Nicaraguan 
border town. He said that thanks to the Nicaraguan authorities' 
cooperation, relatives of the slain woman will now be able to 
take the alleged perpetrators to court. 
  The Nicaraguan Sandinist People's Army (EPS) has already 
been 
notified of the 8 April incident between Honduran military 
personnel and an armed group that, according to Seaman, could be 
linked to the recontras' 3-80 Northern Front led by Jose Angel 
Talavera, a.k.a. "El Chacal." The armies of the two Central 
American countries are carrying out joint exercises along their 
common border to counter movements by armed groups in the area.

  [Text] British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd has confirmed 
that British businessmen are interested in associating with the 
Brazilian Petroleum Corporation [Petrobras] to develop the 
investment project for the construction of the Brazil-Bolivia 
oil pipeline. The secretary and entrepreneurs who comprise the 
official British delegation met yesterday with Petrobras 
Financial Director Celando Galvao at the company's headquarters. 
They collected information on the development of the project. 
Hurd deems the project "very creative and appealing to the 
British private capitalists," who are interested in supplying 
technology and equipment. 
  Secretary Hurd had lunch with Brazilian entrepreneurs 
affiliated with the Brazilian-British Chamber of Commerce and 
Industry. In the afternoon, he gave a lecture at the Getulio 
Vargas Foundation about "How to Administer a Changing World: A 
European Point of View." 
  Today the British delegation will leave for Brasilia, where 
they will be received by President Itamar Franco and the 
ministers of finance, mines and energy, and foreign affairs.

<F P=106> [Article by Sonia Mossri and Gustavo Patu] </F>
  [Text] Brasilia -- Disagreements among the members of the 
economic team prevented Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero from 
announcing during his swearing-in ceremony on 5 April the rules 
for transition into the new currency, the real. 
  The only consensus within the economic team is the 
feasibility of putting the real into circulation on 1 June, 
despite the fact that the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy 
Party] prefers 1 July. Finance Ministry advisers observe that 
the acceptance of the URV [Real Value Unit] is widespread. 
Several price indexes have already adopted the URV as the new 
unit of reference. 
  The PSDB believes that the creation of the new currency on 1 
July will help the candidacy of former Finance Minister Fernando 
Henrique Cardoso. According to PSDB projections, inflation 
should be below 5 percent by October. 
  One of the main controversial subjects among the economic 
team members is the exchange system that will be adopted 
following the creation of the real; that is, the dollar 
quotation in the new currency. 
  Central Bank [BC] President Pedro Malan, BC International 
Affairs Director Gustavo Franco, and special adviser Jose Milton 
Dallari do not favor a fixed exchange rate (that is, a fixed 
dollar price in reals). 
  However, Economic Policy Secretary Winston Fritsch and 
special adviser Edmar Bacha defend a fixed exchange rate during 
the first stage of the real so as to curb inflation more quickly. 
  Another point of disagreement is the manner by which 
inflation will be eliminated at the moment of transition from 
one currency to the other. This means not taking into account 
the price variations of the periods before and after the 
creation of the real. The objective is not to transmit the price 
variations of the old currency (cruzeiro real) to the new 
currency. 
  As for prefixed contracts [credit card payments or purchases 
in installments] other economic plans had adopted a conversion 
scale with daily conversion indexes. Given that these are 
short-term contracts (an average 30 days), part of the economic 
team believes that the anticipated announcement of the date of 
creation of the new currency does not make the adoption of a 
conversion scale necessary. 
  The economic team has not yet agreed on mechanisms for 
eliminating the monetary correction during the month that the 
real will go into effect, and the following month. 
  Gustavo Franco, who used to push for the issuance of a 
decree 
that would establish rules to eliminate the inflationary 
residues, now has begun to say that the subject is "very 
complicated." 
  The rules for the adoption of the URV in the financial 
system 
also cause contradictions. In the past two weeks Franco and 
Dallari envisaged creating as soon as possible CDB's [Bank 
Deposit Certificates] in URV's. Malan and BC Norms Director 
Claudio Mauch believe that the immediate adoption of such a 
measure would be precipitate. 
  Another controversial point is the conversion of public 
utility rates into URV's. Dallari believes that a daily 
correction of fuel and electricity prices would further bolster 
inflation. 
  The creation of a special BC directorate with the sole 
objective of looking after the issuance of the real implies 
further problems. The subject is being discussed behind closed 
doors because the creation of such a directorate requires 
congressional approval. 
  The measures that divide the economic team are: 
<H5>  The Date for Placing the Real into Circulation </H5>
  The most probable date is 1 June, as most of the team wants, 
while Cardoso and the PSDB favor 1 July with an eye on the 
elections calendar. 
<H5>  Backing for the New Currency </H5>
  This is the mechanism to guarantee the real, to turn it into 
a strong currency. It is not yet known what portion of the 
exchange reserves will be used to guarantee the real, or whether 
the government will take any actions in this regard. 
<H5>  Dollar Exchange Rate </H5>
  Part of the economic team wants a fixed exchange rate; that 
is, that the dollar price in real should always remain the same. 
The BC defends a fluctuating exchange rate. 
<H5>  Financial System </H5>
  The Finance Ministry wants a faster adoption of the URV in 
the financial system, while the BC favors a more cautious 
approach. 
<H5>  Public Utility Rates </H5>
  While some members of the economic team defend the immediate 
conversion of public utility rates into URV, others consider 
that such a measure would fuel inflation as the utility rates 
could increase daily. 
<H5>  Special BC Directorate </H5>
  The BC would create a special directorate only to look after 
the issuance of the real. Finance Minister Ricupero has not yet 
given the green light for this project, and the economic team 
has not yet defined how the measure will be sent to Congress. 
<H5>  Inflation </H5>
  It has not yet been decided how to eliminate inflation in 
real cruzeiros at the moment of the creation of the real. Other 
economic plans adopted a conversion scale to discount the 
inflationary expectations embedded in prefixed contracts.

<F P=106> [Article by special ABC COLOR correspondent Luis Maria Maiz </F>
in Brussels] 
  [Text] President Juan Carlos Wasmosy told ABC COLOR 
yesterday that his European tour comes at a key moment. He said 
he received an "excellent response" from European Union [EU] 
officials. Wasmosy said he has the "complex" mission of 
reconditioning the "completely unrealistic" image of "today's" 
Paraguay. Today he will raise with [French President] Francois 
Mitterrand the possibility of rescheduling the foreign debt for 
the next two years so as to allocate funds for social programs. 
  Wasmosy said his European tour is taking place "at the right 
moment." He said he has received an "excellent" response to his 
explanations of cooperation projects, most of which seek to 
favor the most vulnerable classes. 
  Wasmosy yesterday ended a two-day visit to Brussels where 
his 
busy agenda involved meeting with high EU and European 
Parliament dignitaries and European Bank of Investments 
officials, among others. 
  He is scheduled to meet on 8 April with French President 
Francois Mitterrand at the Elysee Palace in Paris. Wasmosy will 
raise with the French president his desire to reschedule the 
Paraguayan foreign debt repayments. 
  Wasmosy will discuss the same issue with French Patronage 
and 
Paris Club board members. 
  In a brief chat with ABC COLOR, Wasmosy described his 
meetings in Brussels. He explained to the European Parliament 
our country's political situation, our hopes for agro-industrial 
development and progress in processing raw materials, which are 
currently exported without added value. 
  Wasmosy said he clearly explained the peasant problem and 
the 
way in which his administration is coping with this situation 
that was broadly covered by the press, specially in February and 
March. 
  Asked if the key point of his European tour involves 
rescheduling our foreign debt, Wasmosy made it clear that 
Paraguay is not specifically asking for renegotiations because 
"we have no arrears." 
  The president emphasized: "We have not come to ask for 
pardons, but to raise a rescheduling of our repayments for the 
next two years so as to have the funds we wish to allocate for 
social programs. We have not come to ask for renegotiations or 
pardons." 
  Wasmosy described as complex the task of overcoming the 
distrust towards the image that Paraguay had projected over the 
past 30 years or so, an image that still prevails in Europe. He 
added: "Think about Paraguay's current profile in Europe. It is 
completely unrealistic nowadays. As president, I have the huge 
task of reconditioning this image." 
  Industry and Commerce Minister Ubaldo Scavone said the 
Paraguayan delegation was impressed by the interest demonstrated 
by European officials in the Paraguayan process and Paraguay's 
future. 
  Scavone noted: "The president was subjected to what we could 
call a very interesting questioning by the European Parliament 
Foreign Relations and Security Committee. This demonstrates that 
there is considerable interest in the Paraguayan process and 
Paraguay's future." 
  The EU is experiencing difficult times both in its internal 
recycling, its stance toward GATT, and its relationship with the 
United States. 
  These complications, however, will not prevent Paraguay from 
securing some assistance. Scavone said: "Considering our past 
achievements, which were nil, we have very good possibilities." 
  Scavone emphasized the favorable inclination that exists. He 
added that "President Wasmosy's image and his correct and able 
handling of the issues has greatly contributed" to this visit's 
success.

  [Text] Via a communique, the Mexican Front Against 
Governmental Corruption [Frente Mexicano Contra la Corrupcion 
Gubernamental -- FMCCG] yesterday claimed resposibility for the 
assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio during his visit to the 
Lomas Taurinas neighborhood in Tijuana. 
  Sources within the Mexican Government report that a 
document, 
which was sent to the editorial staffs of PRENSA HISPANA and 
Radio Campesina, both headquartered in Phoenix, Arizona, 
indicates that the front was established recently and that it 
opposes the president of Mexico, his cabinet, and the PRI 
[Institutional Revolutionary Party]. 
  The document states: "The front was created autonomously 
through the initiative of members of the government of the 
Mexican Republic, members of the Mexican Army, and 7,000 Mexican 
`illegal alliens' [indocumentados] now residing in the United 
States." 
  Members of Chicano communities in Arizona, California, and 
New Mexico who were questioned about this said they knew nothing 
about this new organization. PRENSA HISPANA is a small weekly 
distributed among the Mexican-American community and Radio 
Campesina belongs to the Peasants Union established by Cesar 
Chavez. 
  The document says Mario Aburto Martinez, who is currently 
being held in Almolova in connection with the Colosio slaying, 
is a member of this front and was the person who opened fire on 
the presidential candidate. 
  The document says: "The FMCCG (along with its member Aburto 
Martinez), weary and desperate because of the alarming economic 
situation facing the Mexican people for the past 24 years, is 
adopting measures against the government and claims 
responsibility for the assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio." 
  The group claims to have deployed death squads throughout 
the 
country and vows to attack its targets should its demands not be 
met. 
  The document points out: "Over the past six years, we have 
prepared ourselves to realize, fight, and die for our ideals by 
punishing those politicians who are in power and are using this 
power to their advantage to abuse, steal, and commit 
injustices." Although the document says members of the group are 
willing to die for their cause, it adds, "of course, they will 
die before we do." 
  The five-page document addressed to the Mexican people says 
Colosio was the first of several targets, and it adds that the 
attack on the politician marked the start of a fight to the 
death against the "corrupt traitors of the Mexican Government." 
  The group warns that there will be no peace in the country 
until its demands are met and until the members of the 
government change their positions. 
  The document adds: "All demands must be met or the loss of 
thousands of Mexican lives will be inevitable. The only person 
responsible for this will be you, Carlos Salinas de Gortari." 
  Among the front's main demands is the establishment of an 
OAS 
commission to oversee respect for the human rights of prisoners. 
Other demands include the addition to the Constitution of an 
article attributing responsibility to and punishing members of 
several Mexican governments for crimes of embezzlement and 
mismanagement of public funds. 
  The front wants capital punishment established for "traitors 
of the homeland," and it calls for the confiscation of personal 
fortunes estimated at $1 billion amassed by former Presidents 
Luis Echeverria Alvarez, Jose Lopez Portillo, and Miguel de la 
Madrid, as well as by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari and 
Fidel Velasquez, leader of the CTM [Confederation of Mexican 
Workers]. The group also levels charges against former Jalisco 
Governor Guillermo Cosio Vidaurri, other former state leaders, 
and federal senators and deputies.

<F P=106> [Report over video by Juan Manuel Pereira from the "Early </F>
Morning" newscast] 
  [Text] Mario Aburto Martinez has already given a 
preliminary deposition from Cell No. 3 at the high security 
prison in Almoloya de Juarez, Mexico State. Before he gave his 
deposition, which began at 1730 on 5 April and ended in the 
morning of 6 April, Aburto watched five videocassettes on the 
Tijuana events on 23 March, when he killed Luis Colosio. [video 
shows footage of Colosio walking at the Tijuana campaign rally 
at which the presidential candidate was shot] Images similar to 
this one -- sometimes in slow motion and sometimes frame by 
frame -- depict Aburto's part in the crime, as well as other 
people's contribution. A Television Azteca Network camera 
filmed this event on 23 March. 
  After Aburto assassinated Colosio, many people beat and 
virtually crushed him. In this other shot, we can see Vicente 
Mayoral Valenzuela, Sr., wearing a white leather jacket. [video 
shows Mayoral walking behind Colosio at Tijuana campaign rally] 
It seems he was also beaten after initially being mistaken for 
the murderer because of the blood stains on him. His son, 
Rodolfo Mayoral Esquer, later appeared on the scene and 
attempted to rescue his father. It seems he was able to rescue 
his father, because little by little, father and son are left 
behind by the group that was violently apprehending Mario Aburto 
Martinez. 
  Despite all depositions in the hands of judicial authorities 
who are trying to clarify Colosio's murder, Aburto denied in his 
preliminary deposition that Colosio's murder was premeditated. 
He also denied he knows the four people presumed to be his 
accomplices. He said those who appear in these videotapes and 
are alleged to be his accomplices are innocent. He insisted he 
worked alone. 
  In addition to Aburto, Vicente Mayoral Valenzuela, Rodolfo 
Mayoral Esquer, Rodolfo Riva Palacio, and Tranquilino Sanchez 
also gave preliminary depositions. 
  Television Azteca Network is in the position to confirm the 
identity of Mario Aburto Martinez. This follows claims that the 
person apprehended on 23 March and the one who was taken to the 
Almoloya de Juarez prison two days later were not the same 
individual. Television Azteca Network was able to film these 
shots when Mario Aburto, after being arrested in Lomas Taurinas, 
Tijuana, enters the quarters of the Attorney General's Office. 
This is Mario Aburto Martinez after he was cleaned up. [video 
shows clean-shaven Aburto behind glass, being presented to 
media] There are no doubts whatsoever that he is indeed the 
same person who murdered Colosio.

  [Excerpt] Mexico City, 10 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- The Special 
Assistant Prosecutor's Office in charge of clearing up the 
murder of presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio reported 
today that one of the suspects in the case was released with 
reservations and that formal jail warrants were issued for two 
others. 
  The Attorney General's Office of the Republic (PGR) added 
that Jose Rodolfo Rivapalacio Tinajero was released under "legal 
reservations," due to lack of evidence of his participation in 
Colosio's murder, which took place on 23 March. 
  In an official communique, the PGR added that formal jail 
warrants were issued for Rodolfo Mayoral Esquer and Vicente 
Mayoral Valenzuela, as being probably responsible in the murder, 
to the degree of co-participants as aides or accessories to the 
crime. 
  The Mayorals, father and son, were acquitted on charges of 
criminal association due to a lack of evidence; nevertheless, if 
new evidence is found the case could be reopened for the same 
crime. 
  Included in this case are Tranquilino Sanchez Vanegas and 
Mario Aburto Martinez, perpetrators of the crime that took place 
in Tijuana, Baja California State, in northwestern Mexico. 
  The four individuals remain incarcerated in the Almoloya 
Penitentiary in the State of Mexico, 90 km from this capital 
where they are to be processed. In the Rivapalacio Tinajero 
case, the Attorney General's Office made him responsible for 
incorporating Tranquilino Sanchez Vanegas, Vicente Mayoral 
Valenzuela, and Rodolfo Mayoral Esquer into the group he 
organized, apparently to keep order during the Lomas Taurinas 
political event. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Prosecutor General's Office has just issued a 
communique explaining why Prosecutor General de Greiff has sent 
the judge who is investigating Dandeny Munoz Mosquera, alias La 
Quica, a letter stating there are no charges against him in the 
case of the Avianca plane. 
  The communique states that the letter has been 
misinterpreted 
and specifies that all de Greiff did was send the information, 
which was requested by La Quica's defense attorney, to the 
United States. Second, the communique notes that by 
constitutional mandate, the Prosecutor General's Office must 
investigate the pros and cons involved in any case. Third, it 
points out that it was the Prosecutor General's Office that sent 
the evidence to the United States that allowed La Quica to be 
condemned in the United States for forgery. 
  De Greiff's controversial letter could change the course of 
La Quica's case, but the judge will not decide until this 
afternoon whether the letter will be accepted.

<F P=106> [Report by Alberto Pepe Leira] </F>
  [Text] Montevideo, 7 Apr (EFE) -- The Common Market of the 
South (Mercosur)'s progress toward a projected common tariff 
system as of 1995 has encountered new stumbling blocks in the 
past few weeks following Argentina's and Brazil's intransigence 
in recognizing Uruguay's free trade zones, sources involved in 
the negotiations have said. 
  The Brazilian delegation, within working subgroup No. 7, 
expressed the Brazilian Government's decision of "not yielding 
on this issue" because its interests "are non-negotiable." 
  Mercosur also has run into other difficulties in its 
integration march, like the establishment of a common foreign 
tariff for third-country imports, an issue that remains unsolved 
after one year of negotiations. 
  The fast development of free trade zones in Uruguayan 
territory, which has attracted many investors from 
industrialized countries, has become an issue of constant 
concern, especially for Brazil, which fears the competition of 
East Asian countries within Mercosur's borders. 
  The latest negotiations have been suspended, hoping for "a 
high-level political decision" to shed light on this problem. 
  This issue now must be directly resolved by the presidents 
of 
Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay, who in January 
postponed their decision on the common tariff system. 
  In the Uruguayan city of Colonia, the presidents on 26 
January committed themselves to establishing a tariff before 
July, after ordering a number of additional technical 
negotiations. 
  The free trade zone issue also must be resolved in July. 
  Concerning these two controversial issues, the main Mercosur 
partners have taken different sides. 
  While Argentine, along with Uruguay and Paraguay, promotes a 
low tariff to avoid dependence on Brazilian technology, the 
Brazilian Government pursues the idea of protecting industries 
and endorses a high tariff that will make imports from third 
countries less competitive. 
  Concerning the free trade zone problem, Argentina and Brazil 
have allied themselves and are forming a common front against 
their weakest partners: Uruguay and Paraguay. 
  The uncertain situation involving the future of Mercosur's 
free trade zones has had international repercussions and 
negative reports for investors are circulating in the developed 
nations. 
  The Uruguayan newspaper EL TELEGRAFO, published in the city 
of Paysandu, 380 km northwest of Montevideo, publishes today an 
"exclusive report" drawn up by a Rotterdam consulting group. 
This "exclusive report" reviews the services potential in the 
River Plate basin. 
  The report notes: "Despite the substantial incentives and 
benefits that the free trade zones offer to foreign investors, 
there are certain uncertainties regarding their future." 
  The report notes that it would not be positive for capital 
outside Mercosur to introduce raw materials from other nations 
and industrialize them in the regional free trade zones. 
  According to EL TELEGRAFO, the Brazilians do not accept 
these 
products because "they would destroy Brazilian industry at the 
root of their business within Mercosur." 
  Pursuant to this new reality, Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu 
has told Uruguayan journalists that his country "will defend its 
free trade zones at any cost."

<F P=106> [Report by Gisela Yanez in Guayaquil from the "The Reporter" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] The ministerial meeting of banana exporting 
countries -- Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Panama, and 
the Dominican Republic -- ended in Guayaquil. The participants 
analyzed the framework agreement on bananas signed by the EU 
commission and representatives of several Latin American 
countries to [word indistinct] the import of bananas to EU 
markets. 
  [Begin unidentified speaker recording, in progress] ...the 
market of agricultural products in general and bananas in 
particular. [Words indistinct] regional unity, formulas must be 
found to help guarantee equitable and adequate access to the 
European market by all suppliers. Within that context, the 
representatives of Guatemala, Mexico, Honduras, Panama, the 
Dominican Republic, and Ecuador approve the following 
ministerial declaration of Santiago de Guayaquil: 
  1. Reiterate their disagreement with the clearly 
discriminatory attitude toward our countries that has 
characterized the actions of the EU commission throughout the 
negotiations that concluded with the framework agreement for 
bananas in March. 
  2. Emphasize to the international community the fact that 
the trade policy in Regulation 404-93, which has been termed a 
violation of GATT by the special group, is not [words 
indistinct] acceptance by some countries. 
  3. Invoke the spirit of legality and justice that inspires 
the EU member countries so, in exercising their rights and 
powers, they will reject the procedure adopted by the EU 
commission on this issue and therefore reject the aforementioned 
framework agreement for bananas because it does not constitute a 
lasting, legal, or equitable solution. 
  4. Bring to the attention of the trade negotiation 
committee of the GATT Uruguay Round, which will meet in 
Marrakech at the ministerial level, (?our logical rejection) of 
the so-called "improved offer" on bananas because it does not 
resolve the illegalities of Regulation 404-93, does not resolve 
the problem of discrimination, imposes new barriers [words 
indistinct], and disregards the recommendations of the GATT 
special group. [end recording]

  [Text] On 11 April, Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina 
met with approximately 100 Peruvian businessmen on the first day 
of his official visit to Peru. The frank, open dialogue focused 
on the needs, prospects, and difficulties of foreign investments 
in Cuba. 
  Robaina expressed, in a direct manner, the situation and 
difficulties that Cuba is experiencing, as well as the existing 
interest in obtaining foreign investments. Robaina explained 
that the investments' aim is to meet capital, technology, and 
markets needs. Robaina stated that Cuba has raw materials, a 
trained work force, and the infrastructure. Robaina added that 
Cuba is perfectly aware of the need to create a climate of 
confidence and security for foreign investors and has therefore 
established the appropriate judicial framework. 
  Robaina praised the approximately 100 businessmen who have 
already invested in Cuba, despite difficulties of all types such 
as the fact that Cuba is still undergoing a learning process. 
Robaina also discussed the U.S. blockade and added that 
Washington is determined to stop investors from negotiating in 
Cuba. 
  Robaina asserted that Cuba does not discriminate on the 
basis 
of the origin of foreign investments, but that those from Latin 
America are preferred, for this area is of the same historical 
and geographical background as Cuba. Robaina mentioned Cuba's 
daily difficulties and efforts to get ahead in the midst of 
great problems, and added: We are not interested in the surname 
of our model. We only want it to be Cuban and viable.

out the participation of third parties in the conference on the 
Nation and the Emigre Community scheduled for 22-24 April in 
Havana. He said that representatives from Cuba and its community 
abroad will participate exclusively in this conference. 
  In a meeting with the press in Camaguey, Alarcon de Quesada 
stressed the importance of the meeting as part of a process 
toward normalization of relations between Cuba and its community 
abroad. 
  The ANPP president also referred to the special situation of 
Cuban residents in the United States, some of whom have been 
manipulated by imperialism against the Revolution since the very 
beginning. 
  Alarcon de Quesada added that the conference, to be held in 
11 days, will favor the new trends and the old, pre-1959 
migrations to the United States, with the objective of working 
in order to survive.

  [Text] The weekly newspaper TRABAJADORES today published a 
commentary by reporter Nicanor Leon Cotayo in which he details 
the chaos and ambition prevailing within the anti-Cuban Radio 
Marti. 
  In his commentary, Cotayo says that nine years after its 
creation, this radio station has become a sort of convention of 
chirping crickets hatching political plots. He also mentions the 
tight control exerted on this station by the most reactionary 
Miami circles headed by Jorge Mas Canosa. 
  The article adds that the U.S. Congress this year agreed to 
finance the station with $19 million of the U.S. taxpayers' 
money. But at the same time, it decided to withhold part of 
those funds until an advisory panel reviews Radio Marti 
activities and issues recommendations on the matter. 
  The manipulated objective of this anti-Cuban station is no 
secret to anyone. Moreover, Florida Representative Lincoln 
Diaz-Balart has said this station plays an important role in 
U.S. policy on Cuba. 
  In conclusion, Cotayo states that the validity or lack of 
validity of the role played by the radio station will be 
established by a working group of the U.S. Information Agency, 
but headed by the ultraconservative satellite, Jorge Mas Canosa.

<F P=106> ["Text" of letter sent by Cuban President Fidel Castro to </F>
Camilo Cienfuegos contingent construction workers; date not 
given -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] Dear Comrades: I deeply regret having been unable to 
be with you in the ceremony held on 4 April when you completed 
the Jiguey-Romano-Cayo Cruz rockfill embankment project, but 
other work activities that could have not been postponed 
prevented my being there with you. 
  I wanted to convey to you now, however, that I felt great 
satisfaction and joy when I learned that you have successfully 
concluded that very important project. 
  I have been continuously informed on the development of the 
work by Comrade [Politburo member Julian] Rizo and, more 
recently, by the reports published in our press. 
  The figures clearly and eloquently speak of the deed you 
have 
accomplished: More than 270,000 truckloads of various materials 
were used; almost 2 million cubic meters of rock were dumped 
into the sea; over 43 km of highway were built; and all that was 
completed in just 54 months and 18 days of intensive and 
unselfish work under very difficult conditions. 
  Such achievements are possible only where there are groups 
of 
workers like those of that contingent, men and women with the 
same resolution and will to work that you have demonstrated. It 
is no secret to you that the current circumstances in the 
country give a strategic significance to the effort we must make 
to create, at a more accelerated rate, the minimal structure 
that will help us increase our tourist capacity and enhance the 
quality of service in that sphere. 
  The rockfill embankment you have just completed is a 
concrete 
contribution to that priority effort, which is the same as 
saying that it is a contribution to the historic battle we are 
fighting today in defense of our independence, of national 
identity, of the future of the fatherland, of the Revolution, 
and of socialism. 
  I am pleased to know that we can count on such a group of 
hard workers as you are, especially now that most of the people 
are waging a heroic battle on all fronts to overcome this 
special period. You have played a leading role in another heroic 
deed, showing once more the spirit of fight and the 
revolutionary awareness that makes us increasingly stronger and 
more invincible. 
  I wholeheartedly congratulate you and thank you on behalf of 
the Cuban people for the contribution you have made. I also urge 
you to continue to be the pride of our working class, especially 
of the construction workers. 
  [Signed] Affectionately, Fidel Castro.

<F P=106> ["Straight Talk" program with host Osvaldo Rodriguez from </F>
JUVENTUD REBELDE and guest Eloy Concepcion from TRABAJADORES -- 
live or recorded] 
  [Text] [Rodriguez] Lack of controls and criminality go hand 
in hand. This is the subject Eloy Concepcion of TRABAJADORES and 
I, Osvaldo Rodriguez of JUVENTUD REBELDE, will discuss today. 
Eloy, I want to invite you to meditate a little on how the lack 
of control of state institutions is fostering more criminal 
acts. I think the most harmful criminal activity today is the 
theft of the goods basic to survival that we have in minimal 
amounts. 
  [Concepcion] The visible face of criminality is often that 
of 
the petty thief who steals a bicycle, breaks open a door in an 
establishment to steal a few things, enters a home and steals, 
etc. This is the classical thief who exists in all societies, 
everywhere in the world. 
  I have meditated several times -- and at times when we held 
a 
roundtable meeting to discuss this subject and have listened to 
the experts -- and I ask myself why there was an increase in the 
crime rate last year, and why this problem has not yet been 
definitively eradicated. Without trying to be absolutist and 
without dreaming of being the only perfect society in the world 
-- which is almost impossible because human beings react 
differently under often incredible circumstances -- I keep 
asking: Why does this theft or misappropriation exist in our 
society? I want to add here the word missing inventory 
[faltante] in four categories: theft, misappropriation, 
embezzlement, and missing inventory. 
  The day before yesterday I brought up this subject for 
discussion, because talking on the street -- we reporters must 
converse a lot on the streets and listen to what people have to 
say, especially those in lines, etc. -- I listened to two people 
talking. A man was asking a woman how to get a pound of powdered 
milk. The woman answered: Well, you know that the boat has not 
arrived yet. I began to think: Well, the boat has not yet 
arrived... and where are that man and woman going to buy the 
powdered milk if she is not entitled to receive it as a special 
food quota or because she has a child? But later, watching 
Havana television and after reading the newspaper TRIBUNA DE LA 
HABANA, I realized that the boat with powdered milk indeed has 
not arrived. 
  I ask myself: Where does this milk come from? Milk that 
often sells for dollars or for 100 or 200 pesos? I cannot 
understand the astronomical prices that they charge for a pound 
or a kilogram of powdered milk. I am not talking about the milk 
that is bought at the hard currency stores, but the milk taken 
from what is distributed to children and sick and elderly people. 
  [Rodriguez] And the milk used to make pasteurized milk. 
  [Concepcion] Yes. I would like to point out one thing: All 
this demonstrates that we have very inefficient control 
mechanisms. I do not want to mention the port because it has 
been mentioned several times. I do not want to take it off the 
list or add it to the list. I do not want to mention the dairy 
complex, where that milk is produced, or the different plants 
where the it is processed. I do not want to offend anyone, so I 
am not naming anyone. But I do want to mention all those who 
have to do with the powdered milk distribution network, because 
it is painful. It cannot be allowed, in this society of justice, 
that the state spend money to import milk later sold on the 
black market. 
  [Rodriguez] We are talking about the lack of control by the 
state establishments, which, in my opinion, is the origin of the 
great black market that we are suffering today. We must say that 
the great majority of the Cuban people are suffering, because we 
must all go to that market to try to complement our diets -- 
even though it is a mirage, because no hard worker can purchase 
these products at those prices. I believe these are products 
that we could be receiving through normal means, through our 
quota, our norm; yet they remain in those hands that, as you 
said, are the hands of people who are uncontrolled, on the one 
hand, and corrupt, on the other. 
  [Concepcion] Yes, because we spoke of an basic product like 
powdered milk. We can mention other basic products, where the 
state....[pauses] As reporters we know; we have the information. 
This is a country that is facing a serious and difficult 
financial situation. We understand that the government and the 
leadership of the country, those comrades who are in charge of 
administering the little hard currency we have, work miracles to 
maintain and guarantee those products to the people who need 
them. Sometimes, because of the blockade, we must go around the 
world to purchase those products on credit, credit that many 
times is not granted. We must obtain hard currency, one way or 
another. 
  As a reporter, as a Cuban, and as a patriot, I am hurt by 
these things, especially when one sees these products being sold 
on the black market. Now, I ask the comrades, officials, 
administrators, workers who have to do with this: Does it hurt 
you that these products, which are brought into Cuba to cover 
specific needs, fall into the hands of the black market? What 
control is there at the port? What control exists in the dairy 
complexes and the processing plants? What control is there in 
the business system and in the distribution network? What 
control is there over the truck driver who distributes the 
product to the marketplaces and stores? What control is there 
over the administrators of those stores to keep those products 
from reaching the black market? 
  [Rodriguez] I believe that in the last few days, the Cuban 
people have had the opportunity to see action by the police and 
are getting upset with the attitude of certain administrations. 
I have in mind one administrator who did not regard the 200 tons 
of sugar stolen from his enterprise a considerable amount. At 
that moment, Havana City was going through a sugar crisis. It 
was the middle of the month and sugar still had not been 
distributed to Havana City. 
  I believe there are many administrators who do not care. But 
I also believe that some of these administrators are consciously 
linked to this type of illegal activity. I am not saying that 
they always participate in the distribution or theft network; 
but they embezzle some for their home, some for their friends, 
and some to solve the problems for John Doe at X enterprise 
because, at the same time, he is solving X or Y problem for him. 
  I believe this to be a key element. It is something that 
used 
to be criticized in the enterprise assemblies which were held at 
provincial levels, and it is something that continues today. It 
is something that is unimaginable. 
  Just recently, I wrote an article in JUVENTUD REBELDE on 
just 
such an incident. It was about a person who used fake checks to 
steal from several enterprises in the capital. Those 
enterprises, in an attempt to solve the problem of another 
supposed enterprise, would sell him their products. That 
individual would simply sell those products on the black market 
and thereby solve a number of problems far removed from the 
purpose for which the goods had been produced. 
  [Rodriguez] Concepcion and I are talking here about the 
damage caused by the lack of controls in state institutions. 
  [Concepcion] I think we cannot generalize the idea that all 
comrades in state institutions are involved; the state 
institutions have an organization of their own and comrades work 
in various areas -- commerce, gastronomy, industry, and 
construction. That is, there are comrades working at the 
provincial level, at the state institution level, and at the 
municipal level, who must oversee and check these institutions 
in addition to what is done by the state administrative 
apparatus, by the company, or by the ministry. Now I ask: What 
do these comrades do? Why, if this is well known -- because if I 
am aware, all people are aware of this problem -- why are not 
the officials, administrators, and leaders of the people's 
government in charge of that area not doing anything? But even 
more serious is the fact that most workers from the labor 
centers are aware of the problem. I think there is also the 
other problem you mentioned: I think there is a false concept of 
cronyism, of comradeship, of the idea that I see you and I let 
you do it, because this follows the saying that a shrimp that 
jumps into the water will splash. 
  [Rodriguez] No, it is not a shrimp, it is a shark. A shark 
swims and splashes. 
  [Concepcion] Yes, something along that line. The truth is 
that there is a moral lack. In my opinion, there is a lack of 
morality in the administration and in the labor centers where 
there are no requirements and where there is no moral authority 
who can point a finger, because he himself is afraid of being 
pointed at. He is not saying anything because he is afraid that 
others will say: What can you say, since I saw you doing this? 
  [Rodriguez] And what about those who justify theft because 
of 
the current scarcity in the country? This subject will surely 
demand another "Straight Talk" discussion, because lately people 
would agree in saying: Well, what can we do about it if this is 
the way things are? But I have not seen anyone stealing in order 
to eat. This case I have not yet seen, although it might happen. 
Everyone steals goods to sell on the black market. 
  [Concepcion] Theft has nothing to do with people's needs. I 
was raised under capitalism, and my father taught me not to 
steal. I think our people are sound and honest. Our workers are 
honest and most of our officials are honest, I am convinced. 
What happens is what you recently talked about: something called 
bureaucracy, something called scheming or mechanization. We have 
discussed these ideas at length. For instance, this morning I 
used the term, missing inventory [faltante]. I think all these 
things have created a negligence, a lack of requirements, and a 
lack of aggressiveness. I would also say, as Luis Sexto once 
said on this program that there is a passivism. I do not know 
where the dividing line is between passivism and negligence, but 
both are damaging to the Revolution. I think there must be some 
elements behind this who either wittingly or unwittingly are 
damaging the Revolution. When I was in the black market, I 
realized that selling one kg of powdered milk brought for 
children and the elderly is much more harmful than any direct 
counterrevolutionary action. 
  [Rodriguez] I believe that many of these administrators do 
not even know what is being stolen from them, because they do 
not have the slightest controls over the products. 
  [Concepcion] If they do not have any controls, and if they 
do 
not know what is being stolen, they should not be 
administrators. So, in addition to a raid against thieves, there 
must also be a raid against the administrators who allow 
themselves to be robbed. 
  [Rodriguez] Lack of controls and criminality unquestionably 
go hand in hand. I think we have to cut off the hand of 
criminality and the hand of lack of controls.

  [Text] Politburo member Jose Ramon Machado Ventura has 
visited several agroindustrial complexes and Agriculture 
Ministry organizations in Ciego de Avila. During these visits, 
he learned about the measures adopted in that province to make 
up for the delays in sugar production. 
  [Begin Machado Ventura recording] A great effort is being 
made here concerning sugar cane production, because we have to 
fulfill, the country has to meet a goal; this province, 
specifically, is behind schedule, and this plan, which is behind 
schedule, must be recovered. It does have the possibility of 
overcoming the delay. [end recording] 
  On a different occasion of his visit, Machado Ventura 
praised 
the working spirit of the people of Ciego de Avila, not only 
during the harvest period but also in all other agricultural 
activities despite the severe limitations imposed by the special 
period. 
  [Begin Machado Ventura recording] There is optimism despite 
the current conditions, and in general I can tell you that the 
effort being made by the people is admirable. [end recording] 
  According to Machado Ventura, this effort is the best 
greeting they can convery on international workers' day. 
  [Begin Machado Ventura recording] This year, as has been 
explained, workers' day will be observed in each workplace by 
carrying out the main tasks, those which are essential. This has 
begun, because the workers are not waiting for 1 May to do so. 
This does not mean that the commemoration will take place on 
that day alone. I think that 1 May must be celebrated every day 
in the area of production and under the current circumstances. 
[end recording] 
  Machado Ventura concluded by stressing the significance for 
the country of sugar production in this province. For this 
reason the fulfillment of the harvest objectives is the major 
challenge for the people of Ciego de Avila, and is the response 
the nation expects of this province.

<F P=106> [Second "Open Agenda" program segment on Cuba's nuclear </F>
program with host Antonio Resillez and guest Gilberto Salazar, 
vice secretary of the Nuclear Affairs Executive Secretariat, 
SEAN -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Resillez] Today's program is rather unusual in 
that most of the information will come not from dialogue but 
through videos. We have prepared several reports that we are 
confident will give our viewers a comprehensive idea of the 
practical application of nuclear technology in the Cuban 
economy's principal developing sectors. 
  "Open Agenda" will include exclusive statements by the 
director of the radiation health and safety center, as well as 
by SEAN executive secretary, engineer Andres Garcia -- a rather 
important part of tonight's program. 
  We wish to begin with a report by Cienfuegos correspondent 
Omar George. [passage omitted] 
  [Resillez] Salazar, the SEAN gives particular attention to 
the completion of the isotopes production center. I recall that 
on last Tuesday's program we talked about isotopes and their 
characteristics. I would like you to explain the importance of 
this center. 
  [Salazar] The Isotopes Production Center is going to be the 
largest and most complex nuclear-technology facility, and is 
extremely important for economic as well as strategic reasons. 
At its temporary facility at Quinta and 30th Streets, three 
radiopharmaceutical products are manufactured, but there are 
certain products that cannot be made there. The new facility 
will make producing more products a reality. It will also allow 
us to increase the volume of these products. In a short period, 
we will be able to produce 25 items. At the temporary facility, 
we can produce only three items. By 1995, we expect this 
increased production to save Cuba approximately $1 million; 
hence its economic importance. In strategic terms, this increase 
in production will allow us to increase the application of 
nuclear technology nationwide, and reduce our foreign dependency. 
  Moreover, this work of producing, receiving, and handling 
the 
isotopes in a centralized manner will increase safety in this 
area. This new center will thus be of tremendous importance to 
the country. 
  [Resillez] Thank you, engineer. We are now going to run a 
video that will confirm and perhaps increase understanding of 
this center, and will also show the current stage of 
construction of this isotopes production center here in Havana. 
  [Begin video recording by unidentified reporter] Among the 
priorities of Cuba's nuclear program is a modern isotopes center 
that is being built in the vicinity of Pedro Pi in the eastern 
part of Havana. Conceived as a production, research, and 
development unit, this center seeks to extend nuclear techniques 
to medicine and industry. Its basic objective is to organize 
reception and quality control, distribute the primary 
radioisotopes, and produce whatever is needed in Cuba. 
  This center intends to carry out a number of tasks, among 
them production of radiopharmaceutical products and tracer 
compounds [compuestos marcados] essential for medical diagnoses 
and therapy. The tracer compounds are practically irreplaceable 
instruments in developing new medicines, a program the country 
is implementing. 
  The requirements for registering and marketing these 
medicines include complex pharmacokinetic studies, many of which 
are possible only when the molecules are marked with radioactive 
isotopes that allow them to be followed through the living 
organism, tracing their body's accumulation and excretion 
processes, as well as other characteristics. 
  A group of radiochemists from this center are in charge of 
doing the radioactive marking of this new medicine known as PPG. 
This has allowed a savings of $17,000, and above all, protection 
of the formula, which should be revealed to the foreign company 
in charge of the marking. 
  Because of its production capacity and characteristics, the 
new plant -- which employs Argentine technology -- will be the 
largest facility in Cuba to handle radioactive material. 
Consequently, SEAN has paid special attention to the work in 
order to guarantee its safety from the very beginning. [end 
recording] 
  [Resillez] Probably very few people are aware that nuclear 
technology is employed in vital areas of the country's economic 
and productive spheres. Some may be aware of this, but for many 
it will come as a surprise. 
  When I say vital areas of the country's economic 
development, 
I am referring, for instance, to the sugar agroindustry, 
nonsugarcane agriculture, the nickel industry, biotechnology, 
and others, which could include exploration for and extraction 
of Cuban crude oil. In all these lines of development, nuclear 
technology is used. I think the best way to convey this to our 
viewers is through the following report: 
  [Begin video recording of unidentified correspondent] The 
use 
of nuclear technologies in various spheres of national life is 
one of the main objectives of Cuba's nuclear program, which 
received a special thrust in the 1980's. The areas in which 
these techniques are used includes agriculture, the sugar 
industry, and iron and steel production, as well as geological 
exploration for oil and minerals. 
  Cuban agriculture has especially benefited from the use of 
nuclear techniques. Through the use of ionizing radiation, an 
important phytotechnical program of mutation has allowed us to 
obtain a variety of new plants of great economic importance. An 
accelerated program using the technique that leaves plants 
insect-free has been implemented to control pests that affect 
several crops; the most important results achieved have been 
with the borers that attack sugarcane. Radioactive tracers and 
nuclear analytical techniques in the sugar agroindustry have 
allowed us to evaluate the operations of our installations and 
learn about the chemical composition of the products and 
by-products obtained. 
  The use of radioisotopic instruments has developed greatly 
over the past few years. The iron and steel and mechanical 
industries must be highlighted. Factories in these industries 
use monitoring systems based on this type of equipment. This 
production line is currently being strengthened, with the 
possibility of developing and producing equipment for these 
purposes in Cuba. An example of this is the nickel industry's 
humidity-measurement system based on the method of reflecting 
neutrons that was designed and manufactured in Cuba. This system 
gives us a tremendous saving in fuel. 
  The other area in which nuclear techniques are used is 
petroleum research. Determining the point of interphase between 
water and oil and establishing the causes of failures in wells 
under exploitation are two of the objectives of the use of 
radioisotopic techniques in which foreign companies currently 
operating in Cuba have expressed interest. [end recording] 
  [Resillez] Engineer Salazar, before going on to discuss the 
use of these practical techniques, I think our viewers might be 
interested in learning whether our nuclear development program 
is maintaining fluent international relations or is at all 
isolated. 
  [Salazar] It maintains good relations, internationally. 
[Words indistinct] to show that our program is consistent and on 
the right path. We have bilateral relations with approximately 
15 countries, and multilateral relations through the assistance 
and cooperation system of the International Atomic Energy Agency 
[IAEA], of which we are a member. Proof of this is that we have 
been elected to the board of governors by Latin America for a 
fourth time. This will give you an idea of the prestige we have 
achieved and of our current relations in this regard. 
  We have received support from the IAEA for the period 
1993-94 
in support of the work we have been developing in Cuba involving 
the use of nuclear techniques. This support amounts to $1.2 
million and has been provided to Cuba in equipment, training, 
and advising. This cooperation increased to $8 million over the 
past two [as heard] years and includes a food irradiation plant; 
a gamma chamber; modern nuclear-medicine equipment; modern 
equipment for other techniques applicable to industry, 
agriculture, (?and) computer laboratories; and technical 
assistance. 
  I also want to point out that when we talk about $8 million 
over the past 10 years, we are referring not only to SEAN but to 
the nation. The Cuban nuclear program, through SEAN, supplies 
the entire country: Over 56 percent of those resources is in 
other organizations such as the Ministry of Agriculture, the 
Public Health Ministry, et cetera. 
  [Resillez] Thank you, engineer. I see Engineer Salazar's 
reference to the health program and the presence of nuclear 
techniques in the health system as opportune. I am almost 
convinced that this is nothing new for our viewers, but let us 
see what happens with the practical use of nuclear techniques in 
the health system and in biotechnology. 
  [Begin video recording of unidentified correspondent] 
Nuclear 
science and technology are becoming increasingly more important 
in the health program, in biotechnology, and in the 
pharmaceutical industry. Diagnostic methods with the use of 
radiopharmaceutical instruments are indispensable to the public 
health system. Among the radioisotopic techniques we can mention 
is the gammagraphic technique broadly used in neurological, 
cardiological, oncological, renal, and other studies. Cuba has a 
total of eight gamma cameras installed in nuclear medical 
services nationwide, in which professionals and experts in 
nuclear matters are working. National consumption of 
radioisotopes and tracer compounds has increased to more than $1 
million annually over the past five years, although this cost 
has dropped over the past few years thanks to a group of 
radiochemists from the SEAN who have produced three tracer 
compounds used in renal, bone, and brain studies. This has 
allowed a savings of more than $100,000 annually. The 
radiosterilization system has allowed the decontamination and 
sterilization of bioprepared plastic materials and of 
medical-pharmaceutical products. The tracer compounds are in 
great demand in the genetic engineering and pharmaceutical 
industries. They facilitate the demand for studies of new 
pharmaceutical products before their registration. The task of 
the Cuban nuclear experts has also been extended to producing a 
small quantity of medical equipment. This equipment, which is 
produced in the country, are of high quality and very 
competitive. An example of this is the Degos bone density 
measurer for the diagnosis and treatment of problems in bone 
metabolism and in osteoporosis. It operates through a nuclear 
method called (photonic) absorption. This is very important for 
the studies of bone metabolism implemented by the Public Health 
Ministry. [end recording] 
  [Salazar] Resillez, with the opportunity presented by this 
video, I would like to mention a few things. The video says that 
we have eight gamma cameras in the country. I would like to add 
that nationwide today, we have 17 nuclear medicine modules. This 
shows the high-level diagnoses that can be made of given 
diseases anywhere in the country. 
  The video also mentions the production of some medical 
equipment we already discussed in the previous program. As you 
can see, the quality achieved is outstanding, and not only for 
this show. This has been confirmed by our own medical personnel 
who are using this equipment, although they are still facing a 
medical registration process. 
  [Resillez] Thank you, engineer. The use of all these nuclear 
techniques, not only in Cuba but in any country in the world, 
demands very professional work and severe safety measures to 
prevent damage to people or the environment. In Cuba, of course 
we are doing this. In the following video we are going to see 
what is happening in this field. Then we are going to listen to 
Dr. Luis (Jova), who is head of the Center for Radiation 
Protection and Control [centro de proteccion e higiene de las 
radiaciones -- CPHR]. We therefore consider this video and these 
exclusive comments for Open Agenda of great importance to 
national public opinion. 
  [Begin video recording by unidentified correspondent] Since 
its founding in 1985, the CPHR has been the coordinator and 
leading guide for radiological activities in Cuba. Together with 
the territorial delegations to the SEAN, it controls the 
radiation dosage received by each worker professionally linked 
to ionizing radiations in the 192 radiation institutions 
operating in the country. One of the most relevant activities 
carried out by this center is the research entitled: 
Environmental Radiological Studies Carried Out in Cuba Between 
1984 and 1992, awarded by the Cuban Academy of Sciences. 
  The radiation control task includes study and control of the 
local and regional influence that man has on the environment, of 
nuclear and radiation installations, and the influence of 
overall radioactive discharge. The data released by the national 
network is representative of the whole country. For their study, 
zones of economic interest have been prioritized, such as 
Juragua in Cienfuegos, and those of interest to tourism such as 
the northern coast of the provinces of Ciego de Avila, Camaguey, 
and Las Tunas. One of the conclusions of the radiation studies 
is that the radioactivity to which current and future visitors 
could be exposed in a tourist zone as important as Cayo Coco, 
Cayo Guillermo, Cayo Paredon, or Cayo Sabinal, and the beaches 
of Santa Lucia, Covarrubias, or Por Ella, is much less than the 
average level throughout the world. 
  Cuba is a territory with a normal radioactive background. It 
is a place with radiological conditions favorable to the 
development of any human activity in general, as well as being a 
magnificent place for those people who, in addition to the 
beauties of the area, enjoy the environmental cleanliness. The 
CPHR has demonstrated this with solid scientific arguments. [end 
recording] 
  [Begin (Jova) recording] In fact, in addition to what you 
just saw, we can add that our center, as a center in charge of 
all scientific and technical services in the area of 
radiological safety, has participated [passage indistinct] 
treatment of children from the area affected by the Chernobyl 
accident, our experts have been charged with making a review and 
evaluating the amount of radiation these children received. 
Other studies have been developed in the field of radiology. 
  In 1986, our center was also given the mission of collecting 
all radioactive sources no longer in use in the country, and to 
confine them safely in quarters owned by the SEAN and specially 
designed and built for that purpose. We were also charged with 
collecting all radioactive waste generated by institutional 
users of these sources. These wastes were also treated and are 
safely kept, thanks to technology designed by experts from our 
institution and our country. 
  As you were able to see in that video, our center has an 
important responsibility concerning environmental radiation 
control. This, linked to services rendered in the radiation 
protection area by workers who are professionally exposed to 
radiation, guarantees radiation protection of the people, of 
workers who are exposed because of the work they do, and of the 
environment throughout the country. [end recording] 
  [Resillez] Cuba has been working on its nuclear program for 
almost 20 years. Preparation, production, and training have been 
the essential pillars of this complex project which, as you have 
seen through these two consecutive programs on Open Agenda, the 
country can already witness the results it has achieved. 
  A few hours ago we had a long chat with Engineer Andres 
Garcia, executive secretary of the National Atomic Energy 
Commission. As we said in the beginning, we attribute great 
importance to this conversation, especially regarding 
information for national and international public opinion. We 
have taken one segment of that dialogue, which basically 
discusses the prospects of the Cuban nuclear program. With that, 
we wish to conclude these two programs devoted to this issue, 
but not before expressing our gratitude to the SEAN and its 
information center for all the support they have provided us for 
this program. I would also like to thank Engineer Salazar, and 
you, viewer, for tuning in to this Open Agenda program. 
  [Begin Garcia recording] First, I would like to thank 
everyone involved in this program, and especially you, Resillez, 
for this opportunity you are giving us to inform our people 
through this program about the Cuban nuclear program. 
  Those videos have demonstrated that our nuclear program is 
in 
good health. Concerning future prospects, we are making efforts 
to begin the nuclear energy program. Thus, in the development of 
increasingly more complex installations, we have begun with the 
principle of using our own efforts -- in this case, the 
scientific potential created by the Revolution -- in this 
scientific-technical structure. 
  Apropos to this idea, I wish to say that our development 
must 
be essentially based on the capacity created by the country to 
design and build complex installations in this field. We thus 
consider it a priority to keep our experts united, and 
especially to keep them developing their knowledge in the 
scientific-technical field. 
  The world must think more and more about how to solve future 
energy problems. It is not only Cuba facing this energy crisis 
today. Man must think about how to solve this problem in the 
future. In this regard, nuclear energy plays an important role, 
and great efforts are being made today to develop sophisticated 
reactors, fast-breeding reactors, and nuclear fusion, which have 
greater potential than the current methods. 
  What we have been doing so far is a way of keeping ourselves 
up to date on possibilities for beginning a much more complex 
energy generation system in the near future. However, if we 
abandon this idea, the potential created over the years by the 
Revolution would be dispersed. I think we, the men working in 
this field, have an obligation to be realistic and sensitive to 
the country's situation, confronting tasks that have to do with 
current times. But we must also have a view of the future, and 
work on this view. This is the way we think at the SEAN, and I 
think I can say, to sum up this idea: We must be able to 
daydream. 
  I think our commander in chief, in his historical allegation 
-- and history will support me -- being a young lawyer, was able 
to have a future view of nuclear energy. In his allegation then, 
he was already referring to the importance of nuclear energy to 
solve the country's economic problems. Imagine! In 1953, we were 
a year short of operating the first nuclear power plant in the 
world. [end recording]

  [Text] Enrique Ters Hors, the new director of the UN 
Observers for El Salvador [Onusal], said yesterday that if he 
had to give a diplomatic opinion about the state of Salvadoran 
human rights, he would have to say it could use improvement. 
There is still a long way to go before we can say there is a 
full respect for human rights in the country. 
  Ters Hors, who met with Human Rights Ombudsman Carlos 
Mauricio Molina Fonseca, said there is concern at the United 
Nations about the visible delays in the deployment of the 
National Civilian Police [PNC], land issues, and constitutional 
reform. These reforms should be approved by 30 April at the 
latest by all of the political parties represented at the 
Legislative Assembly. 
  He said that each of the items included in a letter by UN 
Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali expresses concern about 
the current state and progress of the peace agreements due to 
the Salvadoran Government's delay. The letter addresses issues 
from land transfers to the PNC's training and deployment. 
  The international official said "it is important for all of 
the peace agreements to be fulfilled, but it is also important 
that they be properly fulfilled. Sometimes haste affects the 
quality of fulfillment." 
  He added that the more important issues listed in the 
secretary general's letter demonstrate that there is in fact 
concern about the delays in the agreement, which is why 
Butrus-Ghali found it appropriate to bring them before the 
Security Council. 
  President Cristiani recognized yesterday there are certain 
delays regarding the PNC, land transfers, and constitutional 
reform. He said this was not due to a lack of political resolve 
on the part of his government but, rather, due to delays in 
receiving international aid and the Farabundo Marti National 
Liberation Front, which did not want to meet with the government 
to try and find a solution to the problems. 
  Ters Hors said he feels optimistic, because the president 
has 
publicly expressed his will to accelerate completion of the 
pending issues. He said that he personally knows President 
Cristiani has given his minister instructions, thus 
demonstrating the government's will to begin working. 
  The Onusal director said he believes several programs 
designed to strengthen human rights in El Salvador will go into 
effect in July with coordination by Human Rights Ombudsman 
Molina.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article] </F>
  [Text] Following the Easter holiday and without yet knowing 
the definitive outcome to the elections, ARENA [Nationalist 
Republican Alliance] and the coalition have already begun 
campaigning for the runoff elections. Both assume this will 
take place on 24 April, even though the Supreme Electoral 
Tribunal [TSE] has not been able to officially decree the date 
of the runoff. 
  Despite heavy technological investment in the TSE, after two 
weeks, the country still does not know the official outcome of 
the elections. It had been pompously announced that the results 
would be available just hours after polling places closed, but 
the TSE was not even able to supply overall preliminary figures. 
A lack of openness, impartiality, and effectiveness on 20 March 
hindered the vote count. The same structural deficiencies have 
caused the opposition to report fraudulent acts and challenge 
the election results in 44 municipalities. Nevertheless, the 
most probable outcome will be that the TSE will dismiss these 
reports to end, as soon as possible, an electoral process that 
got out of control. The vote count in these elections has not 
been much different from those in previous elections. 
  ARENA would like to avoid a runoff, because a first-round 
victory would make the outcome indisputable and give ARENA a 
pretext to continue ruling as if it has the complete support of 
El Salvador's citizens. The truth of the matter, however, is 
that ARENA only received 25 percent of the vote from those 
citizens registered. ARENA's untamed ambition for power led it 
to commit illegitimate acts on 20 March -- acts whose limits are 
still unknown. If these acts were a determining factor in the 
final results, ARENA will have to repeat them with the serious 
risk of getting caught. 
  On the other hand, the coalition is ready for the runoff 
elections, because it believes that the people's vote is a 
commitment that cannot and should not be negotiated with the 
ruling party, and because it wants to show its ability to 
provide strong opposition in light of the fact that it will be 
very difficult to win the runoff. The coalition's task is not 
at all easy. The Christian Democrats, who were divided among 
those who would like to support ARENA and the coalition, decided 
not to support either. The small parties also do not appear 
willing to back the coalition directly. 
  Even though the immediate electoral outlook does not favor 
the coalition, the runoff election could be an important 
contribution to the nation's democratic future, especially if 
one seriously considers the need to totally reform the electoral 
system after 24 April. Moreover, such a reform process should 
begin immediately and, in turn, remedy the most easily 
correctable anomalies in the little time remaining before the 
runoff elections. Unfortunately, for the time being, it is 
practically impossible to correct the most serious anomalies. 
The runoff elections provide a new opportunity to move ahead 
toward the democratization of the country, but for this to take 
place, the electoral event has to be radically transformed.

<F P=106> [Report by Ghandi Montoya for the "Up-to-Date" newscast] </F>
  [Text] According to an article published by a local 
newspaper on 7 April, Orlando Arevalo, a Christian Democratic 
Party [PDC] deputy, said that he, as a peasant leader, will 
support ARENA [Nationalist Republican Alliance] in the 24 April 
runoff elections. The PDC leadership, however, believes Arevalo 
spoke on behalf of the party and thus has reiterated its 
position on the upcoming presidential runoff elections. 
  [Begin unidentified speaker recording] We have not committed 
our votes to Armando Calderon Sol or to Ruben Zamora. We have 
said that rank and file party members are free to vote for 
whomever they choose. Any view expressed by a member of the 
party must be interpreted as his personal views. [end recording] 
  Despite this statement, and even though the newspaper that 
carried Arevalo's statements said he spoke on behalf of the 
peasant union he represents, his deputy colleagues believe he 
disregarded the party statutes. 
  [Begin unidentified speaker recording] The party statutes 
state that party members who express to opposition parties, on 
television or radio programs, or to the press positions that are 
contrary to the party's political policy will be subject to 
expulsion or suspension. This man has done just that. [end 
recording] 
  The PDC, as well as other parties that did not get a 
majority 
of votes during the 20 March elections, have said that their 
rank and file will be free to vote for the candidate of their 
choice during the 24 April runoff election.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 11 Apr (AFP) -- A girl of U.S. 
nationality was kidnapped today as she was on her way to school. 
Despite the silence of authorities and the school, diplomatic 
sources learned that the girl's father is a businessman. 
  Sources from the Attorney General's Office who spoke with 
AFP 
and asked to remained anonymous identified the girl as 
seven-year-old Georgina Rosse Robyn, the daughter of a U.S. 
businessman who exports nontraditional products in Guatemala. 
  According to this report, the girl was abducted by 
unidentified persons shortly after leaving her home in a 
residential neighborhood in southern Guatemala City. 
  Thus far, both the U.S. Embassy and the principal's office 
of 
Maya School, which the girl attends, have remained silent and 
have neither confirmed nor denied the news, which was also 
disclosed by Police sources. 
  Two weeks ago the U.S. Embassy in Guatemala warned U.S. 
citizens of future attacks in retaliation for the presumed 
abduction of Guatemalan children by U.S. citizens. 
  Recently an Alaskan photographer was accused of abducting 
children and was attacked by a mob in a rural town. The 
individual was hospitalized in serious condition.

<F P=106> [Speech by Government Minister Danilo Parinello to the </F>
Congress of the Republic in Guatemala City on 8 April; broadcast 
in progress -- recorded] 
  [Text] ...my endeavors at the Government Ministry during 
this difficult time, in an attempt to maintain the democratic 
process which, with the help of many Guatemalans -- as I have 
already said -- we initiated more than 10 years ago. 
  I cannot say anything more than we are still consolidating 
the organization of the Government Ministry which I head and its 
many departments. Working with me is Deputy Government Minister 
(?Erwin Quesada) who was sworn in just 48 hours ago. I am not 
trying to make excuses or rationalizations; I am just pointing 
out the facts. 
  I am grateful, therefore, to the honorable Congress of the 
Republic for this opportunity to explain to the Guatemalan 
community how we are dealing with these problems that are 
fostering anxiety, and, moreover, to inform the people of the 
mechanisms through which the ministry will establish increased 
security in the short-term, restore the people's confidence and 
safety, allow them to live their lives normally, and counteract 
the people's lack of confidence in those officials who have 
failed to do their jobs. 
  1. After 17 straight days of continuous work or 12 working 
days, the Government Ministry's employees have assessed the 
country's security situation as critical. I repeat, the 
situation is critical, because it affects all sectors equally. 
It is critical because many cases of individual and collective 
violence are being reported throughout Guatemalan territory for 
a variety of reasons. This violence completely undermines the 
legal framework that is the foundation of the de jure state. 
  If you carefully examine these circumstances, you will 
discover two relevant facts -- a shortage of funds and a lack of 
justice because of the strike by certain members of the 
bureaucracy who work for the security services. You will also 
notice there is a shortage of equipment primarily due to a lack 
of maintenance, and you will also see that the population is 
rightfully demanding an end to social confrontation and 
violence, while calling for true security that will improve life 
in Guatemala. 
  2. The Government Ministry, charged with providing internal 
security, has an insufficient budget, which has not been made 
effective for reasons already mentioned. The ministry's 
personnel are working hard but without proper training. Their 
morale has become weakened and jaded as the result of the 
distorted way in which some groups continue to deal with the 
value of general principles of human rights. A great deal of 
equipment has proved to be inadequate and obsolete. 
  Please let me read the assessment made by myself and Col. 
Merida -- the other deputy minister who assumed office 17 days 
ago and who is with me today. This basic assessment made within 
the past few days, as I said, should show you what, in fact, the 
National Police are, and what they should be. Again, this is 
not the Government Ministry's sole concern, but something which, 
as I said a short while ago, can be viewed as a touchstone for 
the ministry. If the police force works -- in other words, if 
there is security -- the people tend to forget that the 
Government Ministry performs many other functions. Therefore, I 
will refer specifically to the current state of affairs within 
the National Police. 
  Following a detailed review of all procedures, functions, 
members, equipment, and support, we wish to report on the 
current status of the National Police. 
  A. Organization. The current organization of the National 
Police includes a number of departments and agencies that are 
broken down as follows: 
  Directorate. The General Directorate is in charge of 
outlining policies and delegating responsibilities to all of the 
National Police's administrative agencies. This includes the 
director general and all of the organization's personnel. 
  Currently, the Directorate is headed by Salvador Figueroa, 
an 
experienced lawyer. It is necessary to give you this 
explanation, because even historically the government minister 
is believed to be a [words indistinct] minister. You must 
remember, however, that procedures, instructions, reports, and 
[words indistinct] must be directed to the National Police 
Directorate. Of course, there is a deputy director, who is in 
charge of implementing all guidelines issued by the director. 
This position is held by Armando Orellana Flor, a systems 
engineer. The inspector general is the third in command. He is 
in charge of controlling and ensuring that the deputy director's 
guidelines are met. The person in charge of this is Inspector 
General Roberto Marroquin Rivas, a professional soldier. It is 
also necessary to point out that the police have a Joint 
Operations Center that is in charge of coordinating the 
activities of all agencies. It has a headquarters, a statistics 
section, a communications section, and a section.... [recording

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Defense Minister Mario Henriquez </F>
by unidentified reporters in Guatemala City on 8 April; from the 
"Telepress" newscast] 
  [Text] Government Minister Danilo Parinello and Defense 
Minister Mario Henriquez arrived at Congress today after being 
summoned to report on measures adopted by their offices to 
confront increased violence in Guatemala. Before appearing 
before the plenary session, General Henriquez spoke to reporters 
about the congressional initiative to ask the United Nations to 
appoint a special rapporteur for our country. 
  [Begin recording] [Henriquez] The legislative branch has the 
right to make such a decision. 
  [Reporter] Do you think it could negatively affect 
Guatemala? 
  [Henriquez] If it was made by all of the deputies, I will 
respect the congressional decision to request a rapporteur. I 
believe Congress has the authority to do this. 
  [Reporter] Do you think the presence of a rapporteur is 
unnecessary? 
  [Henriquez] I believe the presence of a rapporteur is 
unnecessary, because we have already signed a human rights 
agreement, and, perhaps -- I do not know for certain -- 
approximately 100-150 UN representatives will come here to 
review the human rights situation. 
  [Reporter] Could the congressional measure sway the peace 
agreement [words indistinct]? 
  [Henriquez] I do not think so, because, as I have said, we 
already have expert advisers on human rights, a human rights 
ombudsman, a Human Rights Commission in Congress, Cofrere 
[expansion unknown], and Dona Monica Pinto [not further 
identified]. We have everything we need, and, to comply with 
the general human rights agreement, many more people are going 
to come here. Therefore, one more rapporteur does not mean a 
thing. 
  [Reporter] However, the human rights ombudsman has stated 
that his resolutions are not being accepted by several 
organizations, including the government and [words indistinct]. 
  [Henriquez] I believe the resolutions issued by the Human 
Rights Ombudsman's Office or the ombudsman himself are accepted 
and mean a great deal. I have received several resolutions or 
admonishments [words indistinct]. [laughs] They were 
resolutions to censure, for example, the recruitment of a minor. 
I, of course, respected the resolution. I am talking about my 
personal experience. It was an admonishment. The resolutions 
move your conscience, and they must be respected. 
  [Reporter] Could the presence of a special human rights 
rapporteur in Guatemala corroborate the international petition 
to dissolve the Civilian Self-Defense Patrols? Would the Army 
be willing to dissolve the patrols if a rapporteur specifically 
requested this? 
  [Henriquez] One thing has absolutely nothing to do with the 
other. It is not the Army's responsibility to dissolve the 
Civilian Self-Defense Patrols. The government of the Republic 
has to do this. However, this issue has already been outlined 
in the agreement with the URNG [Guatemalan National 
Revolutionary Unity]. The agreement clearly states that 
voluntary civilian defense committees will remain in place until 
the guerrillas disappear. Furthermore, the recommendation made 
by the 50th Human Rights Conference in Geneva was that the 
government should start demobilizing the voluntary civilian 
defense committees in those areas where guerrillas are no longer 
present. We will start doing this on 30 June. 
  [Reporter] My next question refers to the investigations 
into 
the case of Dr. Obdulio Chinchilla. He says he told you he had 
received death threats. What can you say about this? 
  [Henriquez] I am going to talk about this issue in a few 
minutes. I can tell you right now, however, that he did not 
talk to me. I thank God that he is alive, and I hope there 
never is another attack against Deputy Chinchilla Vega. 
Nevertheless, he did not talk to me at the time. He talked to 
the head of the ministerial command staff, and I am sure he will 
confirm this later. 
  [Reporter] [words indistinct] you made investigations? 
  [Henriquez] We paid a lot of attention to these charges. For 
example, Father Giron [not further identified] called me 
yesterday to say he was being threatened. I immediately offered 
him security and provided security to him. Chief Justice Juan 
Jose Rodil Peralta also told me he had been threatened, and I 
sent him security personnel the same day. It seems a wave of 
terror has started, and we have to stop it because it is time 
Guatemala [words indistinct]. 
  [Reporter] [question indistinct] 
  [Henriquez] In general, there is security for people because 
it is the government's job to provide security and to assure the 
people. However, the most likely targets are top-ranking 
officials, politicians, and military officers. On an individual 
basis, they have to be more careful, and the government must 
provide these people with more security. 
  [Reporter] Mr. Minister, the possibility that a soldier 
might be implicated in the attack against Deputy Duilio 
Chinchilla Vega was mentioned by Deputy Chinchilla Vega himself 
days before the attack. At the same time, he said... 
  [Henriquez, interrupting] He spoke with that soldier. He 
received an anonymous note, and he spoke with that officer. 
That officer is with me now. 
  [Reporter] [words indistinct] 
  [Henriquez] That is what we are going to discuss now. 
Colonel Fernandez Ligorria was mentioned. He is none other 
than the chief of the ministerial staff. Deputy Chinchilla Vega 
met with him, not with me. They discussed the matter, he was 
offered security, and so on, and so on, and he left without a 
fuss. 
  [Reporter] What do you think should be done to counter the 
current wave of violence? Some areas are under a state of 
emergency. What actions do you recommend? 
  [Henriquez] I believe some measures should be implemented. 
This is precisely what will be done, following instructions from 
the president of the Republic, and it will be done without 
having to implement a state of emergency in accordance with the 
five cases mentioned in the Constitution. We hope that the 
press and all Guatemalans will take note of this. The measures 
will be announced soon, no later than next week. The government 
minister has only been in his post for 17 or 18 days, but he has 
been working on this in coordination with the Guatemalan Army. 
  [Reporter] What will those measures be? 
  [Henriquez] We prefer not to disclose them yet, because if 
there are 30 [words indistinct], many criminals, and terrorists. 
Why should we alert them? There are about 500 car thieves. We 
must be cautious when we talk about such things. Some degree of 
secrecy is necessary in certain cases to achieve our objective 
-- namely, guaranteeing the personal safety of civilians, peace, 
and harmony. 
  I am very pleased to know that state employees have lifted 
their strike and that an agreement has been reached. This means 
the situation will soon return to normal. 
  I wish Congress and the judicial branch could work in 
harmony 
for the benefit of all Guatemalans. I would like to see the 
press comply with its sacred duty of reporting objectively and 
truthfully. Guatemala would be a beautiful country, right? 
  [Reporter] Mr. Minister, former President Vinicio Cerezo has 
said former soldiers were implicated in the current wave of 
violence that is creating a nationwide crisis. Although he did 
not mention names, there are rumors that those involved could be 
Colonel Menardo Perussina and others who retired from the Army. 
  [Henriquez] I would not dare mention any names. I know all 
of them, and, frankly, I believe it is very unlikely that a 
retired officer would engage in destabilizing activities. In 
addition, the Army has its own means of information. It has 
intelligence and counterintelligence services to detect such 
actions. If any of these men were involved in any wrongdoing, 
we would likely already know about it, and certainly the defense 
minister would have called them in and reprimanded them. 
  If it is confirmed that they are involved, they will be 
tried 
and punished according to the law. However, I do not think this 
is the case. I read about former President Cerezo Arevalo's 
statement. He said some civilians and retired officers could be 
trying to destabilize the country to promote a coup. He was 
probably referring to those who destabilized his government. 
There are many rumors and a great deal of speculation. I would 
like this to stop in Guatemala, because sometimes friendships 
are lost because of such rumors. This should not happen. 
  [Reporter] Mr. Minister, you just said the Army has its own 
intelligence and counterintelligence services. Why then have 
the murderers of Jorge Carpio and those responsible for other 
attacks, as well as those individuals behind the nationwide wave 
of violence, not been identified yet? 
  [Henriquez] That is why I said we have our intelligence 
agencies, but it is not easy to detect terrorists. I have also 
noted that even in the United States, the only superpower in the 
world at this time, terrorists managed to introduce large 
quantities of explosives into those tall buildings in New York 
-- what are they called, the twin towers in New York? -- and set 
off a large blast, killing people. This happened right on the 
noses of the FBI, the CIA, and a huge military. You see, it is 
not that easy. For example, we would like to find out right now 
who killed Epaminondas or who attacked Chinchilla Vega and 
announce to the press: Gentlemen, this person did it. I would 
like to do that, but sometimes I feel helpless. 
  [Reporter] Are there any clues? 
  [Second reporter] It has been reported that someone was 
arrested in connection with Epaminonda's murder. 
  [Henriquez] I have no knowledge of that. What I know is that 
the technical investigations are ongoing and that there is a 
good chance of arresting the murderer. [end recording]

  [Text] Mexico City, 9 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- The rebel Guatemalan 
National Revolutionary Unity (URNG) today said it has no 
objections to meeting the Guatemalan Government negotiating 
commission in Oslo, Norway in May. Luis Becker of the URNG 
Political-Diplomatic Commission confirmed that government and 
guerrilla delegations are studying the Norwegian Government's 
invitation to meet in that European nation. 
  Norwegian Deputy Foreign Minister Jan Egelan said yesterday 
that the two parties would meet under UN mediation at a 
residence in the forest near Oslo, the same site where 
Palestinians and Israelis met secretly in 1993. 
  "In principle, the URNG does not have any objections to 
meeting in Oslo at the invitation of the Norwegian Government," 
Becker stated. 
  According to the Norwegian deputy foreign minister, the 
purpose of the round of talks in Norway would be to discuss the 
mechanisms for forming the so-called Truth Commission. 
  On another topic, the guerrillas accused Guatemalan soldiers 
of killing a peasant in a village in Peten Department in 
northern Guatemala. They said the man was killed in the 
presence of townspeople, whom the soldiers threatened to kill if 
they cooperated with the URNG. In a communique issued in Mexico 
City, the rebels said the crime was committed by government 
troops a few days after the signing of the comprehensive 
agreement on human rights on 29 March "to prevent the 
fulfillment of that agreement." The guerrillas demanded that 
the document signed in Mexico City be "totally honored without 
reservations." 
  "We again urge the United Nations to send a verification 
mission as soon as possible before the crisis of ungovernability 
worsens and opens the door for even more repression," the URNG 
stated. 
  There was an increase in attacks on politicians, judges, 
legislators, reporters, and foreigners in Guatemala last week, a 
situation that created a climate of violence and insecurity. 
  The guerrillas stated that "there is no respect for human 
rights and there is no justification for the reemergence of 
genocidal practices by the Army in our country. Guatemala needs 
peace and respect for human rights, especially the sacred right 
to life." 
  Guatemalan Government and URNG delegations have been 
negotiating since April 1991 to end an internal armed conflict, 
the only ongoing one in Central America. The conflict has 
claimed approximately 175,000 lives in 33 years.

  [Excerpt] Buenos Aires, 11 Apr (NA) -- Peronism 
[Justicialist Party] has obtained its fifth [as received] 
consecutive victory with an ample win in most of the country, 
although its electoral percentage decreased in an election for 
Constituent Assembly members. The elections also show the 
resounding fall of the Radicals [Radical Civic Union -- UCR], 
the consolidation of MODIN [Movement for Independence and 
Dignity], and the notable growth of the center-left coalition 
Grand Front, which won in the Federal Capital and in Neuquen 
Province. 
  The Peronists have thus been able to maintain their 
supremacy, although they were not able to obtain a majority of 
members in the Constituent Assembly in order to guarantee, 
without any ups or downs, the reform that was agreed upon in the 
Olivos Pact. They must now seek alliances with other parties. 
  For the anti-pact forces the election results proved to be 
much better than estimated, with the absolute victory of Carlos 
"Chacho" Alvares (Grand Front) in the federal capital, the 
victory of the Liberal Autonomist Pact in Corrientes Province, 
the excellent showing of the Popular Jujeno Movement in Jujuy 
Province, the Democratic Party in Mendoza Province, and the 
Grand Front's win in Neuquen Province, where it obtained a 
surprise victory with the candidacy of Bishop Emeritus Jaime de 
Nevares. 
  According to observers, the biggest winners in the elections 
were Buenos Aires Governor Eduardo Duhalde and Cordoba Governor 
Eduardo Angeloz, who raised their stature with ample victories 
over their rivals. In Angeloz' case the winner was his protege, 
Ramon Mestre. 
  Duhalde is now placed in a strategic political position, and 
Angeloz seems to have consolidated his aspirations to be the UCR 
candidate in 1995. 
  The victories of Ruben Marin in La Pampa Province, Carlos 
Reutemann in Santa Fe Province, Radical Horacio Massaccesi (Rio 
Negro Province), and Radical Carlos Maestro (Chubut Province) 
must also be highlighted. 
  The victory of General Antonio Domingo Bussi, retired, over 
Governor Ramon "Palito" Ortega in Tucuman also came as a 
surprise. 
  This time around information on the results of the elections 
ran into a lot of problems, and official figures only began to 
come in during the evening, although many of the candidates 
acknowledged their defeats through the exit polls. 
  According to the most recent data the Justicialist Party 
lost 
some 5 percent when compared with the October 1993 elections, 
and the UCR lost 10 percent, while the MODIN preserved its third 
place at the national level. 
  In Buenos Aires Province the UCR suffered the worst results 
of its history, and its fall in the federal capital was 
catastrophic, as it came in third place with 15 percent of the 
votes. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 11 Apr (NA) -- Raul Alfonsin, head of 
the UCR [Radical Civic Union] executive board, made it clear 
that despite the poor results achieved by the UCR, he "would 
again sign" the so-called Olivos Pact. He stressed that he will 
not "take a single backward step, or step aside" as party leader. 
  Shortly after 1930, Alfonsin conceded defeat in the 
Constituent Assembly elections for the district of Buenos Aires 
at the hands of the PJ [Justicialist Party]. He admitted that 
this situation will force him "to ponder" before making a 
decision on his next step. 
  The former president believes that the ticket headed by 
[Buenos Aires Province] Governor Eduardo Duhalde won because 
"the people voted based on government actions rather than on 
constitutional issues." He denied that the Grand Front [FG] 
victory in the federal capital had been prompted by a rejection 
of the [Olivos] Pact. It was rather prompted by "a rejection of 
government actions," he said. 
  In a news conference at the UCR executive board headquarters 
last night, the former president said the numbers achieved by 
the UCR "do not represent" the party's "greatest defeat in 
history." He stressed that, quite to the contrary, "it 
represents a victory, because the political peace has been 
saved." 
  Alfonsin emphasized: "It was not the worst elections, and I 
am very satisfied with our position because we managed to 
enhance institutional democracy." 
  Alfonsin also confirmed that he trusts that the points 
agreed 
upon in the Olivos Pact that he signed with President Carlos 
Menem "will be absolutely observed." He made it clear that "no 
meeting has been scheduled" with the president within the next 
few days. 
  Asked about the possibility of resigning as UCR executive 
board head, Alfonsin stressed that he does not plan on taking a 
single step aside, or backward step" because he is the UCR's 
rightful leader. He emphasized that he feels "strongly 
supported by half of the party" even though he is not supported 
by Federico Storani's and Juan Manuel Casella's Convergence 
Faction and metropolitan UCR leader Fernando De la Rua. 
  Nevertheless, the former president said that if the 
executive 
board plenary, which is scheduled to meet late this month, asks 
him "such a thing," he would have to leave the UCR leadership, 
even though he predicted that "this will not happen." 
  Alfonsin finally said that a national convention will be 
called in September to establish the bases of an electoral 
platform for the 1995 elections. He believes that the UCR 
presidential ticket will be established "in October or November."

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 10 Apr (NA) -- Antonio Bussi, leader 
of the Republican Force, considers the elections for Constituent 
Assembly members "indicate a flat no to the reform, a flat no to 
reelection, and a severe alert to Governor (Ramon) Ortega, as 
the people of Tucuman Province are demanding that he start 
governing." 
  Bussi also indicated that the results of the elections "have 
exploded the dream" of Governor Ortega of being President Carlos 
Menem's number two on the ticket for the 1995 elections. 
  "His balloon has burst," Bussi stressed in remarks to a 
radio 
station. 
  "Please forgive my lack of modesty, but I believe I have 
been 
winning ever since I entered politics because the people of 
Tucuman have no other reasons to forget the recent past, when 
the province had me as governor," he said. 
  Bussi maintained that "as no governor has yet surpassed my 
governorship, the people are thinking about the past," and he 
reiterated that the decision of the voters "is a severe alert to 
Ortega to once and for all start governing the province." 
  The former provincial governor indicated that he has not yet 
studied the possibility of running for the governorship in the 
next elections and stated that the decision will be made by the 
members of the Republican Force.

<F P=106> [Interview with elected constituent member Carlos "Chacho" </F>
Alvarez, founder of the Grand Front, by unidentified reporter on 
10 April; place not given] 
  [Text] [LA PRENSA] How would you define the Grand Front? 
  [Alvarez] The Grand Front is a center-left movement. I 
define 
it as an open political alternative aimed at recovering values 
that the Argentine people are losing. 
  I do not know if the fact that we propose modernizing the 
economy with emphasis on social aspects means that we are on the 
government's left. But we think Argentina must be more equitable 
and balanced. 
  [LA PRENSA] Do you identify yourself with any European 
socialist movement? 
  [Alvarez] I think there is a models' crisis. Marxism failed. 
The authoritarian socialist systems collapsed. Social democratic 
movements also have failed in their aim of creating more 
equitable societies. The idea of a fundamentalist market system 
also has failed. The opposite is happening; there is an increase 
in racism and xenophobia. 
  Our challenge is to create a new model. This model does not 
have to look like any of the options currently dominating the 
international scene. 
  [LA PRENSA] If you controlled the public administration, 
what 
type of model would you implement? 
  [Alvarez] It is difficult at first to place ourselves in a 
different situation than the present one. We represent Argentine 
society's need for an efficient political force to control 
excesses and abuse of power. 
  We will try to develop an alternative economic program after 
the election for constituent members is over. 
  Our growth must be gradual. We must institutionalize the 
Grand Front as a political force first. 
  [LA PRENSA] Is it true, as comments have it, that you are 
working on a mini-cabinet to eventually run for mayor? 
  [Alvarez] I am not tied to any candidacy. I want to be part 
of a political project capable of becoming a government 
alternative. 
  We made this clear to the Socialist Party. We proposed the 
name of Socialist Party followers to head our tickets in this 
election. 
  However, we are going to work on city matters because the 
people are not going to vote for us to rule the country unless 
we show that we are efficient administrators of a local 
government. 
  [LA PRENSA] But neither will they vote for you to administer 
the city unless you explain what you intend to do first. 
  [Alvarez] Correct. We must develop a clear administration 
and 
government alternative and show that corruption in the public 
administration is not fortuitous. Corruption is systemic, 
structural, and is affecting the operation of services that are 
indispensable for the development of a better standard of 
living. For instance, the most pessimistic estimates of the 
black money circulating in our financial system is around $4 
billion per year. 
  [LA PRENSA] Are your remarks that stability is an important 
achievement and that you will maintain it, indications of the 
Grand Front's economic project? 
  [Alvarez] It would be silly to deny the importance of 
stability. We believe that stability is undeniably beneficial 
for society, but we must face the problems that stability alone 
cannot solve. 
  [LA PRENSA] Do you believe in privatizations? 
  [Alvarez] We must study them on a case-by-case basis. It is 
an instrument that we do not reject. 
  I do not think we can talk about a [Economy Minister 
Domingo] 
Cavallo model. There are instruments. We must analyze them one 
by one. We do not have ideological prejudices against the 
instrument of privatization. 
  But we must always analyze privatizations case by case. For 
instance, we believe that the privatization of Aerolineas 
Argentinas was very bad because we now have a single airline and 
it is in foreign hands. We know we cannot reverse the process 
but we want to discuss efficiency, service quality, and fare 
structure. 
  In sum, we agree with some privatizations and disagree with 
others. 
  In the same way, we do not think it is prehistoric to 
discuss 
if the state could have efficiently administered some profitable 
companies, as occurs in other parts of the world. 
  [LA PRENSA] What about the economic opening? 
  [Alvarez] The opening process bets on Argentine companies' 
improved competitiveness. We propose a different opening model, 
making sure -- as is done by the most advanced countries in the 
world -- that some industries have the necessary level of 
competitiveness and insertion into the world. The idea is to 
design an economic system between the private sector and a state 
that guides, establishes the infrastructure, and seeks 
competitiveness. 
  If we leave everything in the hands of the market's 
spontaneous development we may end up without production of 
goods with high added value. I do not think it is bad for the 
state to help private companies. 
  [LA PRENSA] Could Patricio Aylwin's government be an example 
of your policies? 
  [Alvarez] The Chilean model developed in stages. First, the 
government sought an efficient economic plan, with a 
not-too-dogmatic vision. There is, for instance, a Chile Fund 
that helps small- and medium-size companies become competitive 
in the world. 
  But the system also forgot areas that remained on the 
sidelines and at the margin of the ideological reconversion. 
  I do not think Argentina should wait for a new government to 
begin looking at the areas that were left aside.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 11 Apr (NA) -- Elected constituent 
member Carlos "Chacho" Alvarez of the Grand Front (FG) said 
today that PAMI [Comprehensive Medical Assistance Plan] 
President Matilde Menendez was "punished by society and 
condemned politically" in yesterday's election. 
  The Buenos Aires district winner said that Menendez -- 
second 
on the Justicialist Party ticket -- represents "an example of 
the saturation felt by a good part of the capital's people." 
  He added that despite his victory he will not forgive the 
government for "everything it did" to "disqualify him." Alvarez 
said the campaign "was not traditional and did not include the 
debate of ideas or the exchange of proposals" because the ruling 
party "carried out a very harsh campaign below the surface." 
  He said that "part of the political game's cynicism" is due 
to the fact that "when the aggression ends everybody pretends to 
love each other again." 
  Alvarez denied that the reports of alleged bribes in PAMI 
were "low punches" because "knowing where the money comes from 
is as serious as discussing proposals." 
  "The people said it was enough and wanted to put a limit on 
abuse and corruption in government. The FG was the instrument 
citizens from different political and ideological groups used to 
show this, which proves that no one has a captive electorate in 
the capital," Alvarez said on the radio. 
  The legislator questioned "the government's insults and low 
punches against the FG during the campaign," adding that "the 
incidents created a tense situation because we knew the 
information services were looking for any excuse to attack us." 
  "When the government saw our growth through the surveys it 
started attacking us from all sides. Government officials linked 
us with the issue of the super gang. Then they said I was being 
financed by the SIDE [Secretariat for State Intelligence]. They 
paid two mercenaries who came from the south to say that I wrote 
letters from Congress to former political prisoners, which is 
totally absurd," Alvarez added. 
  According to the FG leader, "there were various government 
operations, one after the other, to hit us below the belt. They 
gave people the impression that they could not accept the 
possibility of losing democratically." 
  Alvarez said the reports on possible bribes inside PAMI 
"were 
not low punches, because to speak of kickbacks or bribes is as 
serious as to discuss proposals." Alvarez concluded by urging "a 
continuation of the investigation because the report was not 
presented for electoral reasons."

  [Text] (NA) -- The fourth Argentine-British Conference 
opened here yesterday and sources said that the main topic of 
discussion centred on the rejection on the part of the Malvinas 
islands inhabitants to bring the issue of sovereignty under 
debate. 
  "As long as Argentina continues to claim sovereignty over 
the 
islands it is difficult that there will ever be normal relations 
between the two countries," a spokesman for the Kelpers at the 
conference said. 
  However progress was apparently made on the issues of 
commerce and culture between the islands and continental 
Argentina, sources said. 
  The Conference, which will go on until tomorrow, will 
continue to be staged behind closed doors.

<F P=106> [Report by German Reyes] </F>
  [Excerpts] Tegucigalpa, 8 Apr [date as received] (ACAN-EFE) 
-- Honduran citizen Luis Hernandez Sosa has denied being the 
mastermind of an alleged plot to assassinate President Carlos 
Roberto Reina, and he told the press: "I am innocent, and I am 
not an assassin." 
  Hernandez Sosa, 30, turned himself in on Thursday to 
Honduran 
judicial authorities through the government's Office of the 
National Human Rights Ombudsman. [passage omitted] 
  When reporters asked him about his relationship with the 
three Nicaraguans, Hernandez Sosa said: "I have no contact with 
Nicaraguans or anyone else. I only have contact with God." 
  President Reina described the alleged assassination plot as 
an act of "gangsterism and drug trafficking." 
  "No one has accused me. I am not an assassin, and tomorrow I 
will clarify everything," Hernandez Sosa said before being 
admitted to the Tegucigalpa Penal Center, where he was placed in 
a special cell under tight security by Army personnel. [passage 
omitted] 
  A presidential spokesman told ACAN-EFE, "it is absurd to 
think that the president could be used as a smokescreen," and he 
underscored that the plan "existed." The source added, "We have 
information that Hernandez Sosa is involved in drug trafficking, 
and this will allow us to clarify the situation for all of the 
Honduran people." 
  Hernandez Sosa has six days, beginning on Friday, to respond 
in court to the charges against him in a case in which there is 
joint cooperaton between Honduran and Nicaraguan authorities.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Ernesto Paz Aguilar has announced a 
series of measures to prevent the illegal entry of foreigners 
into Honduras. These measures range from heavy sanctions 
against airlines that repeatedly transport them to the 
punishment of officials involved in the trafficking of illegal 
aliens. 
  These measures result from reports an international mafia 
operating from Honduras is involved in the trafficking of 
illegal aliens to the United States. 
  "The government's intention is to clean up public 
administration and whatever is associated with the Foreign 
Ministry in line with its fight against corruption in all 
fields," the minister has said. 
  According to the minister, there are names of people, 
including former officials, who are involved in this business. 
"Irregularities have been detected in the Honduran consulates in 
Hong Kong and Panama," the minister said. 
  "Both consulates are under investigation, and the 
responsible 
officials will, naturally, be punished," Paz has said. 
  He has said the name of a former Foreign Ministry senior 
officer from the previous administration was being used for 
illegal procedures. "The former officer is aware of this, and 
we are investigating the matter." 
  Paz has charged certain attorneys, whom he did not identify, 
handle the documentation of illegal aliens who arrive in the 
country. 
  On the other hand, the minister considers it unfair the 
United States should take steps against the new Honduran 
Government for cases that were not resolved during previous 
administrations. 
  Paz believes most of the claims show delays in the 
application of justice, "something which is linked to the 
general problem afflicting the Judicial Branch, which many 
believe should be brought up to professional standards to allow 
Honduras to offer legal security to foreign investors." 
  Meanwhile, the minister expressed pride over Honduras' 
diplomatic victory as a virtual nonpermanent UN member. 
  "This would be a resounding success for Honduran diplomacy," 
he expressed with satisfaction.

<F P=106> [Report by Jose Orlando Sarmiento from "The Morning Paper" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] Reports that say a Honduran and some Nicaraguans 
have threatened to attack the president are distressful, because 
anyone can easily enter or exit Honduras. Corrupt foreigners 
must be controlled. Angelina Ulloa Duarte, head of the 
Directorate of Population and Immigration Policy, has addressed 
this issue. 
  [Begin Ulloa recording] We believe this situation threatens 
national security and, therefore, also threatens our president. 
We are doing everything within the powers of the Directorate of 
Population and Immigration Policy to control the admission of 
certain people who are outside the law. This needs to be done 
in light of the easy access that vehicles and people from 
Central American Group of Four countries have to our country. 
This easy access has prompted a number of problems. 
  Current immigration controls are insufficient to completely 
control certain types of people whose behavior does not 
necessarily follow what is stipulated by Honduran law. We must 
also consider that, despite having administrative border posts, 
our borders are vast and include unsupervised areas of which 
outlaws take advantage. [end recording] 
  It seems there are different types of trafficking bands in 
our country, ranging from trafficking in drugs, stolen cars, and 
money laundering to gunrunning and others. All of these 
threaten social harmony. 
  [Begin Ulloa recording] We used to have gunrunning and drug 
trafficking in Honduras. Because we are situated in the 
geographic center of the American continent, we have become a 
conveniet place for those those people involved in a new type of 
crime -- people smuggling. This crime yields large earnings for 
an international crime network. 
  We have information about the high cost paid by people of 
certain nationalities who are ineligible to emigrate to the 
United States. Indians, Chinese, Pakistanis, Peruvians, or 
Bolivians pay $15,000-$20,000 to ensure access to the United 
States. An international crime network is responsible for this. 
We are aware that, in addition to causing us problems and 
affecting the good relations we should maintain with other 
countries of the region, including the United States, this 
situation also encourages corruption among officials who handle 
documents that allow these people to move about the country 
freely. [end recording] 
  The Honduran state will have to create organizations similar 
to the Directorate of Population and Immigration Policy to 
control the admission of individuals that come here to cause 
problems after gaining easy access to our country.

  [Text] Rene Steichen, EU agricultural affairs commissioner, 
has reported Honduras was excluded from the new Latin American 
banana agreement, which favors only the banana exports to Europe 
of Colombia, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. 
  According to the agreement, these four countries must 
withdraw from GATT, which rejected the quotas imposed by the EU 
on Latin American banana imports. 
  Steichen has said that Colombia, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, and 
Venezuela are supplying the Latin American banana amounts the EU 
requires. 
  In July of 1993 the EU imposed an annual quota of 2 million 
tonnes of bananas on Latin American exports to protect producers 
from the Canary Islands and the former European colonies in the 
Caribbean and Pacific regions. 
  It was agreed last December to increase the quota to 2.1 
million tonnes as of 1 October 1994 and to 4.2 million tonnes as 
of 1995. 
  The new agreement states duties on the fruit will be reduced 
from 100 to 75 European Currency Units per tonne. 
  The quota assigned to Costa Rica amounts to 23.4 percent of 
the total amount imported by the EU, while Colombia will export 
21 percent, Nicaragua 3 percent, and Venezuela 2 percent. 
  Honduras, Ecuador, Guatemala, and Panama refrained from 
supporting the agreement and are demanding suspension of the 
restrictive system.

<F P=106> ["Economic report" by Trinidad Murillo from "The Morning </F>
Paper" newscast] 
  [Text] The government of the moral revolution, as Honduran 
President Carlos Roberto Reina has named it, is experiencing 
great pressure from the international financial institutions 
[IFI's] to reduce the budget deficit to less than 4 percent, to 
reorganize the economy, to stop the wave of speculation of our 
currency in the face of the U.S. dollar, and to put an end to 
the deterioration of the national economy. Many government 
officials regret inheriting what they believe could have been 
overcome by the previous government -- a high budget deficit of 
more than 10 percent and an uncontrollable economic imbalance. 
  According to government officials, the country is currently 
facing a severe crisis. Prices cannot be stabilized, nor can 
economic order be maintained to avoid additional burdens on the 
Honduran people. A lack of decisionmaking in the face of high 
fuel prices has angered the people. There has been a shortage 
of staple products, and, worse, prices are out of reach of 
ordinary citizens' pocketbooks. The people are also enduring a 
milk shortage -- a heavy blow to the children of Honduras -- 
without any solution to this serious problem in sight. 
  The IFI's will continue to pressure the government to comply 
with its debt commitments. In order to meet this demand, the 
government must reduce its budget deficit and its expenses, 
stabilize the currency, and reduce the size of government. The 
IFI's are even recommending taxes, such as a sales tax of 7-10 
percent. 
  The World Bank itself, in it latest recommendations, demands 
that the tax structure be simplified; that the tax base be 
broadened; and that existing tax exemptions, including some 
income tax exemptions, be reduced. More serious to consumers is 
that the government has been asked to eliminate subsidies that 
are not directed at the poorest sectors, including urban 
transportation subsidies, and to improve supervision of the 
decentralized enterprises and to revise their rates, which means 
higher priced public services such as electricity, water, and 
telephone service. 
  In the same way, there is a clear intention on the part of 
the IFI's to privatize as soon as possible Hondutel [Honduran 
Telecommunications Enterprise], SANAA [National Autonomous 
Aqueduct and Sewage Service], and ENEE [National Electric Power 
Company]. As a result, the people will continue to suffer 
through greater increases in the price of food and other 
household products -- in other words, the price of staples. 
  At this moment there is a natural concern among the 
country's 
different organized sectors. These sectors already foresee a 
weak and wavering government, despite its promised humaneness 
and boasts of social liberalism. It is not easy for President 
Reina to carry out a definitive plan to face Honduras' economic 
and social problems in the first 100 days of his government. 
Moreover, the external pressure is so strong that the 
government is seen as being a (?hybrid) without a true policy of 
its own to confront the country's economic and social problems. 
In other words, nothing is getting accomplished. 
  The campaign promises were a good means for gaining power, 
but thousands of Hondurans will continue to buy more expensive 
food. Thousands of Hondurans will continue to pay more taxes, 
and thousands of Hondurans will continue to bear an increase in 
public service rates. The country is on the brink of economic 
imbalance and desperation, hoping that a governmental solution 
will avoid so much abuse against its citizens.

  [Text] Brasilia -- The Socialist Convergence -- a political 
faction that had been expelled from the Workers Party [PT] 
because of its radical, intolerant ideas -- has managed to join 
the front that will support the presidential candidacy of Luis 
Inacio Lula da Silva. Under the new name of Unified Socialist 
Workers Party (PSTU) [Partido Socialista dos Trabalhadores 
Unificado], the former Socialist Convergence wants to influence 
Lula's campaign with slogans calling for an "anticapitalist" 
Brazil that will accept "no masters." 
  The PSTU has only two federal deputies: Ernesto Gradella 
(Sao 
Paulo) and Maria Luiza Fontenelle (Ceara); and few members in 
the states. The PSTU, which follows an ultraleftist, Trotskyite 
line, has its stronghold in Sao Paulo. The PSTU criticizes the 
PT, describing it as "bourgeois." 
  PT members have been upset by the PSTU joining the coalition 
supporting Lula's candidacy. Deputy Paulo Delgado (PT-Minas 
Gerais State) finds it absurd for the PT to have accepted as 
allies those who had been expelled from the party for not 
following the party guidelines. Delgado said: "The left 
operates as an exclusive club in which there is ultimately 
greater solidarity among club members themselves than between 
the club and the people." He added: "Could people who do not 
respect anyone speak in someone's name?"

  [Text] Brasilia -- The Brazilian Social Democracy Party 
[PSDB] and the Liberal Front Party [PFL] on 6 April sealed an 
agreement supporting the presidential candidacy of Senator 
Fernando Henrique Cardoso (PSDB-Sao Paulo). In a meeting that 
lasted all morning, PSDB President Tasso Jereissati and Luiz 
Eduardo Magalhaes, PFL leader in the Chamber of Deputies, made 
progress in consolidating the alliance between the two parties 
and seeking to find a PFL candidate for the vice presidency. In 
another meeting, PFL President Jorge Bornhauser and Tasso 
Jereissati established a schedule. At the beginning of May, the 
two parties will hold simultaneous conventions to officially 
report on their electoral ticket. 
  Despite having succeeded in ensuring an agreement to make 
the 
electoral alliance formal, the PSDB and PFL leaders did not 
confirm Luiz Eduardo Magalhaes' name as the vice presidential 
candidate on Fernando Henrique Cardoso's ticket. Magalhaes is, 
nonetheless, the candidate preferred by the PFL and by Cardoso 
himself. In addition to the alliance, it also was decided on 6 
April that two committees comprised of representatives from the 
two parties will be created to draft a common government program. 
  Bornhauser explained: To avoid complaints about possible 
differences in the program of each party, we decided to draft a 
joint government program to last four years. This program's 
pillar will be the resumption of development. 
  He believes that after sealing the agreement, the natural 
tendency will be to gradually reduce the PSDB and PFL factions' 
rejection of the alliance. The strategy now will be to seek new 
partners for this front. According to Bornhauser, the initial 
targets will be the PTB [Brazilian Labor Party], the PPR 
[Progressive Renewal Party], the PP [Popular Party], and the PL 
[Liberal Party]. 
  The wider the range the better, the PFL leader said. 
  One of the decisions made on 6 April was to hold the 
regional 
directorates responsible for eliminating the differences PFL and 
PSDB members living in the various Brazilian states still might 
have. Another proposal approved during the meeting was on 
holding simultaneous conventions to officially announce the 
PSDB-PFL ticket amidst huge celebrations. Two dates have been 
suggested for the convention: 15 May or 22 May. Each party will 
hold its convention separately as established by the law and, at 
the end of these conventions, the two parties will get together 
for a festive ceremony in which they will announce the electoral 
ticket.

  [Text] Brasilia -- In its national convention, the Liberal 
Party [PL] on 10 April nominated Deputy Flavio Rocha (Rio Grande 
do Norte State) as its presidential candidate. Rocha has thus 
become the first candidate to be officially nominated by his 
party to seek President Franco's office. Rocha, who is unknown 
to the public, will use the eight-minute television time 
allotted daily to his party to exclusively defend his proposal 
for a single tax. 
  Rocha's immediate objective is to preserve an alliance with 
little-known groups that will guarantee him a reasonable share 
of TV time. Rocha is hoping to get a significant number of 
votes during the first round so that in the run-off he can exact 
a commitment for his single tax proposal from one of the two 
candidates. 
  Drawing on his family fortune built on profits from the 
Riachuelo chain of stores, Rocha already has visited nearly 100 
Brazilian cities on board his private jet. In just the past 45 
days, the PL candidate's flying time stood at more than 200 
hours and he plans to visit a minimum of 500 cities. 
  At 36, Rocha is serving his second term as a federal deputy 
and will be the youngest presidential candidate in Brazilian 
history. In the February PL primaries, he defeated retired 
Brigadier Ivan Frota, who obtained only 19 percent of the votes.

<F P=106> [Article by Jayme Brener and Luiz Antonio Novaes] </F>
  [Text] The Brazilian Government is ready to undertake a 
prickly mission: convincing the White House that Brazil's space 
program is completely peaceful. In other words, that our 
satellite launch rockets will neither don military uniforms nor 
transform themselves into missiles capable of landing in our 
neighbors' territories. In February, the government announced it 
would adhere to the terms of the MTCR [Missile Technology 
Control Regime] an international treaty that restricts missile 
production. And the new Brazilian Space Agency (a sort of 
green-and-yellow NASA), which acquired its first directors in 
early March, is likely to permanently disconnect the program 
from any military content, in the eyes of the Americans. Until 
February, when the agency was created, the Brazilian Commission 
for Space Activities (COBAE), linked to the Armed Forces General 
Staff, was responsible for this project. The oaths taken as to 
the peaceful nature of our space program will probably also 
appear on the menu at the meetings that U.S. Vice President Al 
Gore will hold in Brasilia this week. Major General Ajax Barros 
de Melo, 59, the new director general of the space agency, 
confirmed the overtures to the United States, saying: "We want 
to make it plain that we really never had military objectives." 
The United States acknowledges the blandishments: "The creation 
of the civilian agency puts relations between the two countries 
back on track," commented an American diplomat. 
  There is a clear motive behind these Brazilian signs of good 
will: a relaxation of the veritable blockade the White House has 
been imposing on Brazil's space mission. Since the United States 
suspects that a parallel missile program exists, it has always 
done everything possible to keep Brazil from accessing the most 
sensitive technology. One American diplomat told ISTOE that his 
government went so far as to prohibit the presentation of 
certain books to Brazilian scientists. A study that the White 
House commissioned in 1993 from the Rand Corporation, an 
ultraconservative research institution, concluded that the 
Brazilian space program is "not economically viable." Unless its 
true objective were the production of missiles. The skirmishes 
between the two countries peaked at the end of last year, when 
Brazil accelerated its participation in a joint program with 
China for the launching of two observation satellites. At the 
time, the military command signalled that Brazil might attempt 
to obtain, from the Chinese and Russians, the special technology 
denied it by the United States and its allies. 
  The Brazilian space program calls for the launching of four 
communications satellites. The first two in the Brasilsat series 
are already in orbit. It is expected that another will take off 
in 1995, mounted on the nose of a Brazilian satellite launch 
vehicle (SLV). The Sino-Brazilian project, in turn, includes the 
launching of two observation satellites, the first in 1996. "Our 
space mission has not only created about 5,000 highly 
specialized jobs, it transferred First World technology to 
different sectors of civilian industry," said Marcio Barbosa, 
director of the National Institute of Space Research (INPE) in 
Sao Jose dos Campos (SP). One of the examples of this 
technological transfer occurred at the Esca company, of Barueri 
(SP), which is involved in the Sino-Brazilian satellites 
project. Esca used the aerospace know-how to develop cheaper 
plastic bottles for soft drinks. 
  Even with all the guarantees offered the United States as to 
the civilian objective of the space mission, there is little 
possibility that the Brazilian project will get a powerful 
injection of the latest technology in the near future. "I do not 
think our potential partners will help us build the SLV," Ajax 
de Melo said. "We will have to do it right here." And even if it 
has "adhered to the conditions" of the missiles limitation 
agreement, there are still doubts that Brazil will actually sign 
the document, an action that would make the White House more 
tractable. "There will be no formal signature. We are adults and 
we will do what Russia and China did, which is simply to declare 
that we will adhere to the terms of the agreement," the general 
explained. After enduring spartan budgets when Fernando Collor 
was president, the SLV is supposed to get US$40 million from the 
government between now and 1995. And its development may yet 
provoke new frictions with the Americans. After all, as Ajax de 
Melo noted,"if you build a rocket and put it into orbit, you can 
aim it anywhere you want. We have that capability and the 
Americans know it. That is what sovereignty is," the officer 
concluded.

<F P=106> [Article: "Change, Change, Change"] </F>
  [Text] Last week, President Itamar Franco made the 40th 
change in his cabinet. It features shifts like that of the 
acting minister of a ministry that was going to be abolished who 
became the permanent minister of a ministry that will be 
maintained--the case of Leonor Franco, of Social Welfare. A 
reserve minister became head of a ministry in his own 
right--Colonel Djalma Morais, of Communications. A former 
minister with a questionable background was called to hold a 
portfolio that was to become extinct--Deputy Aluizio Alves of 
the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party], summoned to 
Regional Integration. The military reinforced the olive-green 
cordon of Itamar's team by adding General Rubens Bayma Denis, 
the new transportation minister, and the tucanos 
gained another ministry--the Ministry of Planning--now held by 
Ceara Senator Beni Veras. In the commotion, former Minister of 
Transportation Margarida Coimbra even sought support from her 
mother, in Rio de Janeiro. After phoning her mother Monday 
night, the former minister wept. "I don't know what is going on 
out there, I haven't the least idea. Now I am unemployed and 
have no place to go," a desperate Margarida told Marcelo Auler, 
VEJA assistant editor in Rio. 
  The administration did not announce any new plan or new 
goals 
as part of the reform, only changes in names. In less than two 
years, Itamar has made more appointments than former President 
Jose Sarney did in five years of government (see box). The game 
of musical chairs brings to a close a reform that has been 
dragging on for five months. It has accomplished almost nothing, 
except to reaffirm Itamar's taste for uniformed ministers. The 
addition of Bayma Denis brings to five the number of top-ranking 
military officers holding civilian posts at the first and second 
echelons of the government, The minister of the Strategic 
Affairs Secretariat is from the Navy--Admiral Mario Cesar 
Flores. The president of Telebras [Brazilian Telecommunications, 
Inc.] is from the Air Force--Brigadier General Adyr da Silva. 
General Romildo Canhim is minister of Administration. Another 
general, Nilton Moreira Rodrigues, is the head honcho at Sudene 
[Northeast Development Superintendency]. There are so many 
top-rank military men in civilian posts that Itamar has 
surpassed former President Joao Figueiredo, a military man who 
had only four generals on his team. Itamar also has two high 
officials who bear the rank of colonel: Djalma Morais, confirmed 
last week as head of Communications, and Wilson Romao, director 
of the Federal Police.

<H5>  Numbers from the Tumult </H5>

  -  Itamar replaces an average of two ministers a month. 
  -  In 
less than two years in office, the president made more 
appointments than Sarney did in five years--69, compared with 62 
for the former president. 
  -  Itamar took office with 15 ministries, 
created 12, and now has 27. He had 12 acting ministers and one 
extraordinary one. 
  -  Alexis Stepanenko, now minister of mines and 
energy, has held three posts in this administration. 
  -  The one who 
warmed his chair for the shortest time was Wilson Romao. His 
stay at Agriculture lasted one day. 

<H5>    "I Want a General" </H5>
  President Itamar decided to appoint Bayma Denis on Tuesday, 
during a phone conversation with Minister of the Army Zenildo 
Lucena. "I want a general," Itamar said. "I am not going to 
allow the cabinet to be the target of birds of prey." By "birds 
of prey" he meant opportunistic politicians, the technicians 
connected to economic groups, and the construction contractors. 
Minister Lucena suggested Denis, who was head of the Military 
Command of the East from which, two months ago, he dispatched 
troops to forestall demonstrations at the Rio-Niteroi Bridge. A 
Rio native, age 64, the general is respected within the Army. He 
was minister of the Military Household in the Sarney 
administration. 
  "Our administration makes no distinction between civilians 
and military personnel," President Itamar said in Caracas, 
Venezuela, on Friday. "There are civilians who should hold 
civilian posts. But there are also military men who can occupy 
civilian posts, with civilian objectives." As Fernando Henrique 
Cardoso said during a conversation about the reform with Raul 
Jungmann, executive secretary of the Ministry of Planning, this 
is a putt-putt administration. "Putt-putt?" Jungmann wondered. 
"Yes. It takes two or three months for something to happen. When 
it does happen, everything changes: the economy, the currency, 
the ministers...." Minister Alexis Stepanenko, who was shifted 
from Planning to Mines and Energy--his fourth move within the 
cabinet--is tired. "I hope they don't move me again," he 
grumbled. He found out he would be reassigned on Wednesday 
morning when he got a phone call from Itamar. "You're going to 
Mines and Energy, O.K.?" [preceding word in English] the 
president said. "But why? Don't you and Fernando Henrique like 
my work?" Stepanenko wanted to know. "Best wishes, minister. 
Best wishes. Ciao," said President Itamar, ending the phone call. 
  Senator Beni Veras, of the Ceara PSDB [Brazilian Social 
Democracy Party], went to Planning thanks to his party colleague 
Fernando Henrique. A former traveling salesman and the son of a 
tailor, Veras had to struggle to earn his degree in business 
administration. As an executive in the Guararapes apparel 
factory, he never took a vacation or missed a day of work. When 
fired, he sued the company and used the money he received to set 
up his own clothing factory, Confex. Soon he became a business 
leader and participated in the movement that launched Tasso 
Jereissati as candidate for governor of Ceara in 1986. 
<H5>  Gutsy </H5>
  For the Ministry of Regional Integration, Itamar went 
looking 
for a name in the PMDB. The post had been vacant since the 
budget scandal broke out and implicated then-Minister Alexandre 
Costa. The party chose Deputy Aluizio Alves, who was minister of 
administration under Sarney and once served as governor of Rio 
Grande do Norte. Aluizio Alves is a choice that comes with a lot 
of baggage. Along with his son and office manager Aluizio, Alves 
is accused of igniting a bonfire of improprieties in the 
ministry, ranging from payments to contractors for projects 
never built, to disappearance of equipment. The father was 
indicted in four Federal Police investigations. He was 
eventually acquitted in three of them. In the remaining one, he 
is accused of crimes against the public administration. The son 
has four cases pending against him in the federal courts. 
"Appointing Aluizio Alves is just another gutsy move by the 
Itamar government," was the sarcastic comment by Deputy Augusto 
Carvalho of the PPS [Socialist People's Party] of the Federal 
District, who plans to requisition information on the minister 
from the Federal Police, the National Accounting Office, and the 
Federal Supreme Court. 
  As minister, Aluizio Alves hired 620 employees in irregular 
fashion, including six relatives. He was responsible for 
managing 213 apartment buildings that are occupied by federal 
civil servants. He took care to hand over the best units to his 
relatives--one of them measuring 242 square meters and featuring 
four bedrooms, all renovated with marble. Minister Aluizio Alves 
is a wealthy man, the owner of a newspaper, a TV station, and 
five radio stations in Rio Grande do Norte. When he left the 
Sarney government in 1989, he tried to get himself elected to 
the Superior Military Court. He won the election, but was never 
sworn in. The vote in the Senate was annulled when evidence of 
fraud came to light. Starting Monday, Aluizio Alves will have a 
budget of 23 billion real cruzeiros to administer.

<F P=106> [Interview with Workers Party political adviser Francisco </F>
Weffort by Fernando de Barros e Silva; place and date not given 
-- first two paragraphs are FOLHA DE SAO PAULO introduction] 
  [Text] The PT [Workers Party] has distanced itself from the 
peoples' movements that gave it birth and become a party of 
officeholders and internal camps. The diagnosis of the crisis 
hanging over the PT comes from political scientist Francisco 
Weffort, 56, a professor at USP [Sao Paulo University] and 
member of the political council that drafted the platform for 
Lula's campaign for the presidency. 
  A founder of the PT, its former secretary general (1984-87), 
and a former member of its Executive Board (1980-89), at 1500 
today Weffort will attend a public meeting at PUC [Pontifical 
Catholic University] in Sao Paulo, an event convened by 
intellectual and labor union members who see in the "castling" 
of the PT leadership a threat to Lula's election. Weffort says 
he is rooting for the FHC [Fernando Henrique Cardoso] plan. 
  [Barros e Silva] What do you think of the FHC economic plan, 
and the administration? 
  [Weffort] Fernando Henrique is the government. I hope the 
plan is successful and achieves the stability it seeks. That 
could be a better starting point from which the next 
administration can implement a policy of growth. Any 
reservations one might make at this point are secondary, in my 
opinion. The policy of "the worse things get, the better" does 
not help anyone. 
  [Barros e Silva] The PT calls itself a socialist party. 
Would 
a Lula administration pave the way for socialism? 
  [Weffort] No. Lula's program seeks to democratize and 
modernize capitalism. This means redistributing income, finally 
implementing agrarian reform, correcting the imbalances in 
regional distribution, and carrying out a series of economic 
reforms, including a reform of the State, that will permit 
resumption of growth. Brazil is so conservative that the 
capitalists are unable to democratize capitalism. 
  [Barros e Silva] What effect does the fact that the most 
orthodox faction of the party holds a majority of the leadership 
posts have on the PT program? 
  [Weffort] I do not know what you mean by "orthodox faction." 
Orthodox as regards what? 
  [Barros e Silva] The dogmas of the Left. 
  [Weffort] That does not exist in the PT. The backwardness 
people talk about today does not lie with the PT's Left; it is 
in the eyes of those who are looking at the party. The problem 
is something else: the PT is a national party that expresses the 
inequalities and heterogeneities of Brazilian society. One 
cannot imagine Brazil having a national party of the Left that 
does not express the protest sentiments that are at work in 
society. Sometimes the party has trouble understanding certain 
requirements of development policy in Brazil today. 
  [Barros e Silva] So what are the party's "blind spots?" 
  [Weffort] The PT's biggest problem lies in the fact that it 
ends up making room for some of the corporativism we have in 
this country. Sometimes you think a fellow is defending the 
government monopoly on petroleum because he is a radical. 
Actually he is connected with the corporativist interests in the 
petroleum business. What passes for radicalism is a sectoralist 
view of the policy, held by those who cannot see the country as 
a whole. 
  [Barros e Silva] Lula's electoral base at this point is 
larger than that of the PT. If he becomes president, who will 
govern--Lula, or the party? Does Lula risk becoming a new 
"savior of the nation," thus reviving the old messianic 
tradition of Brazilian politics? 
  [Weffort] It is neither the party nor Lula that will govern. 
It is the government of alliances that Lula will preside over. 
Even if he does not forge alliances for purposes of the 
election, it is clear that he needs to build alliances in order 
to govern. As regards the messianic tradition, I do not think 
such a risk exists. Lula is a charismatic leader who has been 
working for years to build up the institutions. That runs 
counter to the messianic route. 
  [Barros e Silva] Is the current configuration of the PT 
leadership the result of the weakening of the social movements 
that played a central role in the formation of the party? Has 
the petista culture been lost? 
  [Weffort] In part this is due to a decline in the ability of 
the social movements to exert pressure, but mainly it is an 
expression of the changes in the national political picture. 
When the PT was born, at the end of the military regime, people 
were convinced it would be possible to build democracy from the 
ground up. An antigovernment sentiment was spreading throughout 
the society. As the dictatorship was on its deathbed, the social 
movements became weaker, while the channels of representative 
democracy with its extremely powerful attraction were opening 
up. The PT threw its grass-roots leaders onto the scenario of 
representative democracy. The consequence was a certain 
strangulation of the fellow who simply wanted to be a 
petista militant, the guy who has no political 
ambitions and does not take part in the internal tussles among 
the different camps in the party. It is not the leadership's 
fault. 
  [Barros e Silva] Has the PT become a party of cadres? 
  [Weffort] It has become a party of officeholders and 
internal 
camps. It has some fairly well-organized partisan factions 
within it. I am not against this, but I think that by itself 
this is not enough. You have to have people who are not aligned 
with any camp and not interested in running for elective office. 
What is missing are those militants whom we used to call PT-PT, 
those who do not belong to any faction. 
  [Barros e Silva] The PT leadership reacted vehemently to the 
manifesto that called on the militants to discuss the gap 
between the leadership and the rank and file of the party. As 
one who signed the text, what do you think of that reaction? 
  [Weffort] There is a mistake in all that. I signed that text 
with the intent of discussing how the PT could go back to being 
a party of the masses. I did not sign off on criticisms of the 
leadership, and I tell you that if that was the intent, I would 
not have endorsed it. I believe this could hurt not only Lula's 
campaign, but the objectives I want to achieve. 
  [Barros e Silva] What are the PT's boundaries in terms of 
political alliances during the presidential campaign? 
  [Weffort] The chances of an alliance during the first round 
are very limited. Now the chances of an alliance of masses 
during the runoff are great, if the PT keeps an open mind from 
now on. In regard to the boundaries, I believe the classical 
parties of conservatism--the PPR [Progressive Renewal Party], 
the PFL [Liberal Front Party] and, secondarily, the PTB 
[Brazilian Labor Party]--are beyond the realm of possibility. 
Alliances could be formed on the other side. 
  [Barros e Silva] Even with Quercia? 
  [Weffort] It is unlikely, but I think it has to be discussed 
separately. We must not think only of the leaders; we must 
consider the masses they represent. 
  [Barros e Silva] Do you concur with the PT leadership's ban 
against party participation in the constitutional revision? 
  [Weffort] I think the PT got itself into a mess on that. The 
party had every right to oppose the revision but, once it was 
approved, it had a duty to participate. It lost more by not 
joining the revision than it would have had it taken part, even 
if it always voted against the changes. Staying out helps 
isolate a party that needs to leave itself open to alliances.

<F P=106> [Interview with Workers Party Vice President Rui Falcao by </F>
Carlos Eduardo Alves; place and date not given -- first two 
paragraphs are FOLHA introduction] 
  [Text] Since last June, journalist Rui Falcao, 50, has held 
the political command over the PT [Workers Party] in his hands. 
A state deputy alternate in Sao Paulo who is himself now holding 
the seat, Falcao is the man responsible for the PT leadership's 
swing to the left. A former militant in the PCB [Brazilian 
Communist Party] and in the VAR-Palmares [Revolutionary Armed 
Vanguard], the current vice president of the PT was a political 
prisoner for three years during the military regime. 
  Falcao defends the legitimacy of the current PT leadership 
and says the lack of electoral representativeness at the top 
does not disqualify the leadership in comparison with the 
previous party officers. Following are the highlights of 
Falcao's interview with FOLHA. 
  [Alves] The PT calls itself a socialist party. Would a Lula 
administration pave the way for socialism, and if so, what would 
be the content of that socialism? 
  [Falcao] We define a Lula government as being democratic and 
people-based. A government of profound social, economic, and 
political reforms that plans to tackle longstanding privileges 
and create conditions for the people to participate in drafting 
the budget, in government decisions, in giving a new direction 
to the role of the State, and strengthening the organization of 
Brazilian society. The PT is a socialist party and sees the 
opportunity to govern the country as the time to change values, 
raise the consciousness of the public, and democratize land 
ownership. 
  [Alves] So it would be a government of transition to 
socialism? 
  [Falcao] We want to create democratic conditions so that in 
the future we can live in a society of fraternity, justice, and 
equality. In our view, such a society is socialist and 
democratic. 
  [Alves] Is the current configuration of the PT leadership 
the 
result of the exhaustion of the social movement? 
  [Falcao] The present leadership is as pluralist and 
legitimate as its predecessors were. The majority was 
constituted by capturing a sentiment pervading the party that 
there was too much distance between sectors of the leadership 
and the party's rank and file, that there had been 
indecisiveness in the former leadership's attitude toward the 
Itamar Franco administration when it was formed, and a certain 
natural loss of influence of leaders who had spent a lot of time 
in command of parties. 
  [Alves] Among the classical schools of thought that founded 
the PT (the Church, the labor movement, and people from leftist 
movements), this last group has become superimposed on the 
others. Why did this happen? 
  [Falcao] That sounds like a sociological explanation of the 
life of a party. There is no domination by formative legacies in 
the composition of the present leadership. Lula, who was mainly 
responsible for creating the PT, continues to be the expression 
of party unity, and a democratic fellowship among the different 
tendencies is what rules the PT today. 
  [Alves] The groups that now control the PT lack social and 
electoral representativeness. Why is that? 
  [Falcao] I would not say they lack social 
representativeness, 
inasmuch as several of my fellow leaders are associated with 
various movements. Electoral representativeness is conferred by 
the party as a whole. The legislators who serve in the current 
leadership and all the legislators of the PT were elected by the 
weight of the party--not to mention their individual qualities. 
Those who are now in the leadership did not go through the same 
voting process as their predecessors. But I do not believe this 
disqualifies, or qualifies, the colleagues who served previously 
in comparison with the present group, or vice versa. 
  [Alves] Isn't this a sign that the PT is becoming a party of 
cadres and not of the masses? 
  [Falcao] We never defended the idea that the PT should be a 
party of cadres. Since its foundation, the PT has broken with 
that tradition of the Brazilian Left. We believe that just 
because a party organizes millions of workers and common people, 
it does not mean that political cadres, organic intellectuals, 
are not developing. 
  [Alves] Lula's electoral base is greater than what the PT 
has 
historically achieved. If he is elected, will the mandate be 
his, or the PT's? 
  [Falcao] The president's mandate comes from the people, but 
it reflects a commitment to a program. It is that relationship 
that we establish so that there will be no doubt. It is a 
mandate from the people, but one that is also legitimized by the 
fulfillment of a program. 
  [Alves] In case of doubt, will Lula, or the PT, make the 
decision? 
  [Falcao] The one who governs this country is the president 
of 
the Republic, and his ministers, in conjunction with the 
Congress. We want to expand that concept of democracy by having 
the population not just vote, but be able to participate in the 
control over the government and in government decisions. 
  [Alves] What are the PT's boundaries in terms of alliances 
during the campaign? 
  [Falcao] Our policy as regards alliances must be coordinated 
with our program. We put priority on alliances in society and 
also with parties. The PCB [Brazilian Communist Party], the PC 
do B [Communist Party of Brazil], the PSB [Brazilian Socialist 
Party], the PPS [Socialist People's Party], the PV [Vanguard 
Party], the PMN [National Mobilization Party], and the PSTU 
[United Social Workers Party] are possibilities. The PSDB 
[Brazilian Social Democracy Party] is disputed territory. We 
recognize that the PSDB has a people's camp within its 
electorate and among its troops, and we are competing for the 
support of part of the PSDB for Lula's candidacy, even though we 
know the PSDB will run its own candidate for president, riding 
piggyback on a stabilization plan, something that is in the 
worst tradition of Brazilian politics. 
  [Alves] What do you think of Minister Fernando Henrique 
Cardoso as a candidate, and what about the economic plan? 
  [Falcao] The economic plan does not deal with the issue of 
the monopolies and the financial system. It does not associate 
stabilization with the need for development of this country; 
therefore, we might actually move into a situation of declining 
inflation rates but still have unemployment and misery. In the 
third place, it ties the country's economic decisions to the 
United States and to the IMF via a shamefaced dollarization of 
the Brazilian economy. In the fourth place, it is an 
electioneering program because it is betting on the possibility 
of a partial and temporary decline in the inflation rate to pay 
dividends at the ballot box. It is a Cruzado Plan without a wage 
bonus. 
  [Alves] Now that the constitutional revision is a fact, is 
there any regret that the PT is absent from it? 
  [Falcao] I do not consider the revision to be a consolidated 
process. What we are seeing now is an auction. There is dissent 
even among the elites as to the course the revision should take. 
We have maintained a tactic of obstruction, of attempting to 
reduce the boundaries of the revision and to shorten its 
duration. If the revision process does get going, we hope to 
achieve the longest possible agenda and a change in the rules so 
that our deputies can get involved in the process. 
  [Alves] How do you view the manifesto by the intellectuals 
who criticized the party leadership by pointing to a distance 
between it and the PT grass roots? 
  [Falcao] Any group of PT members may legitimately band 
together and express themselves either against or in favor of 
the leaders. I cannot, however, agree with their view of the 
current PT leadership. This leadership is legitimate, and there 
are other intellectuals who support it.

<F P=106> [Report by Alberto Rivera] </F>
  [Text] Jinotega -- Eleven former commanders of the 
Democratic Forces for National Salvation [FDSN] have given this 
LA PRENSA correspondent a copy of a communique expressing their 
firm determination to take up arms again "because of the 
government's failure to fulfill the pledges signed in 1992," 
when more than 2,000 fighters were demobilized. 
  The former FDSN fighter's noms de guerre are: Alexis, 
Campeon, William, Osmar, Cain, Efrain, Luis, Venado, Conejo, 
Danto, and Tigre. 
  In the communique, the commanders address Francisco Valdivia 
Chavarria, known as Commander Dimas: "Mr. Francisco Valdivia 
Chavarria (Dimas) and staff: Prepare yourselves. Do you people 
think you will be allowed to keep the haciendas and vehicles you 
were given? No, gentlemen. Time is up. No one will stay 
behind. All of the 5,000 FDSN demobilized will fight for our own 
interests, land, and homes." 
  The commanders remind Dimas of his pledge to take up arms 
again if the agreements fail to be complied with, and they urge 
him to join them in the mountains, making it clear to him 
neither he nor the government will cheat them. 
  The commanders blame Violeta's government, saying: "The 
government will be held responsible for any rebellion in the 
country's north, because the government made a pledge and 
failed." 
  The commanders describe themselves as "men of peace" but 
warn 
they will not tolerate deception. Finally, they set a two-week 
deadline for the government to show signs of willingness to make 
good on its word.

<F P=106> [Interview with PNC [National Conservative Party] Vice </F>
President Adolfo Calero Portocarrero by Edgard Solorzano; place 
and date not given; first six paragraphs are EL SEMANARIO 
introduction] 
  [Text] He is the principal leader of one of the three 
conservative parties in Nicaragua. He defines himself as just 
another citizen of this land that has been traversed from one 
end to the other by nationalist, anti-interventionist, and 
frequently fratricidal wars throughout its history; in which the 
leaders of gangs in parallel situations have led and sometimes 
still lead the peasant masses into total slaughter. And there 
are those who say that he is not innocent in connection with all 
of this. 
  He went into exile during the period of the Sandinist 
revolutionary government and was a member of the leadership 
structure of the resistance movement. His role while abroad was 
above all diplomatic in nature, involving negotiations, mainly 
with Washington, and the solicitation of funds amounting to 
millions to finance the war against Nicaragua. There are also 
those who believe that it is not entirely clear where all of 
this money went. 
  Calero Portocarrero is a tall man with a rough voice and 
totally white hair. Despite his involvement in politics, and 
thus the recent history of the country, he has not evidenced 
much of the intellectual legacy of his father, the well-known 
writer Adolfo Calero Orozco. He was one of the precursors of the 
body of Nicaraguan short stories and the author of the book 
"Sangre Santa" ["Sacred Blood"], among others. 
  "I am very proud of both my father and my mother, Mrs. Maria 
Portocarrero," he is forthright in saying. 
  He began his political life in the Conservative Party. He 
says this affiliation is in his blood, since one of his 
grandfathers, his father, and his mother were conservatives as 
well. After returning from Europe at the end of the last 
century, his maternal grandfather, Bernabe Portocarrero, became 
a liberal, imbued with liberal ideas. 
  Calero Portocarrero's first political activity was as a 
member of the Conservative Youth in about 1957. He recently 
turned 62. 
  [Solorzano] How would you define your political career? 
  [Calero Portocarrero] I have progressed in a straight line, 
with no inconstancy. I have always sought the achievement of 
freedom, democracy, and a social market economy, aware of the 
obligation borne by those of us who have some education to share 
our knowledge, ideas, ideals, and achievements with the rest of 
the people. I feel very profoundly Nicaraguan. This was 
something inculcated in me by my father. 
  [Solorzano] What role did you play during the Somoza era and 
during the decade of the Sandinist government? 
  [Calero Portocarrero] When I returned to Nicaragua from the 
United States in the 1950's, I never had a choice, in the sense 
that there was a dictatorship in power, and there was one 
opposition party--the Conservative Party. Thus I chose to be a 
member of the opposition from the beginning, and I continued to 
oppose Somoza until the dynasty came to an end. Then came the 
Sandinists, in whom the people of Nicaragua placed the highest 
hopes. But they were totally disappointed. I remained in 
Nicaragua in opposition to the Sandinist movement until I was 
refused permission to leave the country in 1982. I did leave, 
legally, and they then put obstacles in the way of my return in 
January of 1983. Given those circumstances, I had no alternative 
to staying abroad. I was not going to remain at their mercy. Nor 
did I accept the position they offered me in Ecuador, if I would 
forget about politics. But I did choose and agree to join the 
Nicaraguan Democratic Force (FDN). I had been in contact with 
Enrique Bermudez even before my departure from Nicaragua, and he 
had urged me to join the FDN. I joined in January of 1983. That 
same year, I was elected to serve as its president, and I held 
that position until the Nicaraguan resistance, made up of the 
various groups working against the Sandinist movement, was 
formed. 
  [Solorzano] Why did these groups suddenly decide to join 
together? 
  [Calero Portocarrero] This union, which included more than 
90 
percent of the belligerent forces, was forged by the 
circumstances in the United States. It was necessary to appeal 
to the Congress there, to present a broader front, and to obtain 
from that country the economic aid essential for the task of 
continuing the struggle. 
  [Solorzano] What difference do you see between the nature of 
the Sandinist movement when it was in power and now that it is 
out of power? 
  [Calero Portocarrero] The Sandinist movement was clandestine 
when it began. Once it had won power, its preference for 
dictatorial command, for absolute, arbitrary control, became 
clear. Later, due to circumstances and the pressure exerted by 
the rebel forces (and even international pressure), the 
Sandinists found themselves forced to hold elections, which they 
lost. Then, once they were out of power, they were never willing 
to recognize that this was the situation. Instead, they 
continued to wield power from below, as Mr. Ortega has put it. 
  Little by little, however, I have been seeing a change. 
  [Solorzano] What kind of change? 
  [Calero Portocarrero] A relatively secret one. 
  [Solorzano] To what do you attribute this behavior? 
  [Calero Portocarrero] It looks as if the Sandinists have not 
been able to overcome this preference for secrecy that 
characterized the beginnings of the movement. And so we find 
that we are dealing with an apparently divided movement with 
different factions, one moderate and one radical. 
  [Solorzano] Based on your analysis, what is the reason for 
this situation? 
  [Calero Portocarrero] I think that there is no ideal in the 
Sandinist movement that would provide the ranks with cohesion. 
The Sandinists are confused. It was very difficult for them to 
make the transition from guerrilla warfare to government power, 
and then from government power to life in the countryside. Thus 
the Sandinist movement has become the victim of its own errors, 
its own failures, and it will be very hard for it to find a 
direction. The Sandinists will have to deal with many 
contradictions. Only they themselves can strip the movement down 
and straighten it out, once they know who they are. 
  [Solorzano] Who are those you believe can give direction to 
the Sandinist movement? 
  [Calero Portocarrero] Well, I would say that it is now 
possible to discern some innovative forces that merit respect 
and should be taken into account. 
  [Solorzano] What do you think of this internal debate in the 
movement? 
  [Calero Portocarrero] All of the parties here in Nicaragua 
tend to have internal divisions. And since we see that there are 
several conservative and liberal parties, it would not be 
surprising to see several Sandinist Fronts. 
  [Solorzano] What was your role in the 1990 elections? 
  [Calero Portocarrero] I was not permitted to return to 
Nicaragua during that period--not until after Mrs. Chamorro had 
taken office. 
  I did not participate in the electoral campaign and I did 
not 
proselytize. I even wrote an article for the MIAMI HERALD in 
which I predicted that Dona Violeta would win, based on the 
Gueguense [Nicaraguan folklore character]. Now then, my 
party--the National Conservative Party--nominated Enrique 
Bolanos as its candidate. In the end, I favored the United 
Nicaraguan Opposition (UNO) and Dona Violeta's candidacy. 
  [Solorzano] Why, at this point, does the National 
Conservative Party continue to believe in the UNO and to call 
for a constituent assembly? 
  [Calero Portocarrero] We believe, with the greatest 
conviction and in all sincerity, that simply patching up or 
repairing the present political problem in Nicaragua by means of 
partial reforms is not the solution. I even doubt that such 
reforms could be carried out, because there are forces in the 
National Assembly that have entirely different interests. And so 
I believe that the solution to the problem of reorganizing the 
powers of the state can be found only in a new constitution. In 
order for this to become a reality, it is necessary to go back 
to the people, to take back the initiative, and to clarify the 
ideas of the people so that it will be they who choose. 
  [Solorzano] My attention is drawn to the fact that while all 
of the parties making up the UNO are calling for a constituent 
assembly, their members have resumed their parliamentary seats. 
How can these two things be reconciled? 
  [Calero Portocarrero] I believe it was a very great mistake 
for the UNO to withdraw from the assembly in protest against the 
election of the board of officers headed by Dr. Gustavo Tablada. 
The UNO deputies should have stayed, opposed what they needed to 
oppose, and voted "yes" when they believed it necessary. The UNO 
lost the majority, whether this was due to mistakes or 
conflicts. One can never hope that an elected congress will 
remain united if it has no cohesive factor. 
  Now then, I think the fact that the UNO deputies returned to 
their seats is a healthy thing, although we are opposed to any 
partial reform of the Constitution. But it must be remembered 
that there are other laws that are very important, and the 
deputies can do nothing from outside the assembly. It is 
perfectly possible for them to occupy their assembly seats while 
favoring a constituent assembly. Let us remember that it is 
these same deputies--those in both the UNO and the Front--who 
will cast the votes. 
  [Solorzano] How can the UNO position be explained when, on 
the one hand, it is calling for a constituent assembly, while, 
on the other, a UNO commission met with the Sandinist Front to 
seek out common ground with a view to partial reforms? 
  [Calero Portocarrero] The National Conservative Party did 
not 
approve of the holding of these talks. We had already decided to 
wage the struggle for a constituent assembly. We have never had 
faith in partial reforms, but as members of the UNO, we halted 
our campaign for a constituent assembly and waited to see what 
the results would be. They proved to be what we had expected 
since nothing was achieved. The articles that are of principal 
importance to both the Sandinist Front and the UNO were not 
discussed. And so, then, I think we must look to reality, 
coexistence, peace, and mutual respect, so that we can all live 
in an ideal country. This can be achieved only through a 
constituent assembly. 
  [Solorzano] One of the things the UNO proposed as a 
condition 
for supporting partial reforms was a change in the board of 
officers of the National Assembly. Engineer Alfredo Cesar even 
publicly recognized the election of Dr. Luis Humberto Guzman. 
Why then do you continue to insist on a constituent assembly? 
  [Calero Portocarrero] In my opinion, the UNO has clung to 
arguments that were not so important. I did not agree with the 
UNO, but since our party is a member of the coalition, we 
respected the decision of the majority. But I reiterate that I 
did not approve of the withdrawal of the UNO deputies from the 
assembly solely because a board of officers that deprived them 
of control of the National Assembly had been elected. 
  It is hard for me to understand Cesar's position in the 
parliament. 
  [Solorzano] Does the National Conservative Party regard the 
present board of officers as legal? 
  [Calero Portocarrero] My party has made no statement on the 
matter. 
  [Solorzano] Doesn't the participation of the UNO deputies in 
the assembly perhaps give it legal status? 
  [Calero Portocarrero] Well, you see, the UNO deputies either 
did not appear at the assembly sessions or presented themselves 
but then withdrew. However, they did accept their salaries. I 
believe that this was illogical. It was inconsistent for them to 
question the legal status of an officer of the assembly, denying 
it by withdrawing from that body, and then subsequently to 
recognize the validity of his signature on their checks. 
  [Solorzano] Originally--in 1989, the UNO was made up of 14 
parties, while now there are only seven. Do you believe the UNO 
is headed toward disappearance? 
  [Calero Portocarrero] In 1989, there were 14 parties that 
belonged to the Coordinadora [Coordination Council]. I believe 
the UNO was formed with fewer parties, and that it was a 
coalition organized with a view to the 1990 elections. It 
contained no force that would keep it united. When the catalyst 
for the formation of these coalitions disappears, they tend to 
disintegrate. It is true that the UNO has a government program 
to oversee, and that is the only thing that is sustaining it. 
Moreover, the UNO will not be a factor in the 1996 elections, 
since new alliances will be formed. It seems likely to me that 
even the Sandinist Front will seek alliances with other parties 
that are sympathetic to the new ideology allegedly professed by 
some Sandinists. 
  [Solorzano] Do you believe that no single party will be able 
to rally the votes needed to win the elections in 1996? 
  [Calero Portocarrero] Very frequently, this depends on who 
the leader of a given party is. Here in Nicaragua, there is a 
tendency to vote for the individual, and not necessarily for the 
party. However, anyone who aspires to the presidency must have a 
party behind him. For this reason, I think this is important 
when the time comes to choose people. And therefore alliances 
will have to be formed. 
  [Solorzano] What is the National Conservative Party thinking 
where the 1996 elections are concerned? 
  [Calero Portocarrero] We are engaged in a process of 
consolidation, modernization, and dynamic action. We are working 
on a data bank with a view to drafting a program, and we will 
operate as if we were going to proceed alone. It is possible 
that we will participate in alliances.

<F P=106> [Interview with PSD President Adolfo Jarquin by Walter </F>
Lacayo Guerra; place and date not given; first five paragraphs 
EL SEMANARIO introduction] 
  [Text] The way out of the crisis in which the Democratic 
Social Party (PSD) now finds itself can be glimpsed, however 
vaguely, in the distance, although without Alfredo Cesar and his 
principal ally Guillermo Potoy included in it. The actions of 
the group headed by Deputy Adolfo Jarquin Ortel have been real 
shows of strength. A total of 29 of the 50 members of the 
National Directorate (DN) appeared at the meeting called by 
Jarquin to straighten out the political course of the party 
previously headed by Cesar. 
  Ortel's followers reaffirmed their support for the proposed 
constitutional reforms, the incorporation of PSD deputies into 
the National Assembly, and reorganization of the National 
Executive Council (CEN) as a result of the sanction which the 
Disciplinary Council imposed on Potoy, Cesar, and Adan Morales, 
who were removed from their posts for one year. The National 
Directorate decided that new party leaders would be elected in 
June and that those disciplined would not have the right to run. 
  The unanimous resolution of the National Council of 
Political 
Parties (CNPP) to resolve the conflict in favor of Jarquin's 
group was the coup de grace for Cesar's bunch, which was to be 
expected since the latter group's allegation was extremely weak. 
After all, it was easy to see that the majority--no fewer than 
29 members of the National Directorate--were on Jarquin's side. 
  Thus it is that Cesar and Potoy's faction exhibits a 
significant weakening, not just within the PSD, but in the UNO 
[National Opposition Union] itself, where leadership will now 
pass to the liberals of Virgilio Godoy's PLI [Independent 
Liberal Party] and Arnoldo Aleman's PLC [Constitutionalist 
Liberal Party]. Cesar apparently ends up alone in the National 
Assembly, without any party or bench. The defeat has crushed his 
aspirations to become head of the UNO bench now led by Luis 
Sanchez. 
  The CNPP resolution virtually creates a new social 
democratic 
party in Nicaragua. There is a potential opportunity to stand 
out as a party that takes decisive steps to consolidate the 
National Assembly's stability and its contribution to the 
process of constitutional reforms could make it a party of the 
future. Adolfo Jarquin granted the following exclusive interview 
to EL SEMANARIO. 
  [Lacayo Guerra] What are your impressions of the CNPP 
resolution recognizing you as the legitimate president of the 
PSD and removing Guillermo Potoy? 
  [Jarquin] The National Council of Political Parties acted in 
keeping with our party statutes because as soon as the 
illegalities and arbitrary acts mainly committed by Guillermo 
Potoy and Alfredo Cesar began, we went before national and 
international public opinion to condemn that antidemocratic 
outrage and violation of the statutes. A minority opposed a 
decision of the majority to support the reforms of the political 
constitution and not raise such false banners as the Constituent 
Congress. The CNPP is the body that governs and controls the 
activities of political parties and we must abide by its 
decision. We logically expected the ruling to go in our favor 
because we had the majority of the members of the National 
Directorate behind us. Likewise, the majority of the rank and 
file supported the movement, which has been seeking a way to 
rescue social democratic ideals and ensure that our efforts in 
Nicaragua would actively support democratization and the 
establishment of a state of law. We also wanted laws to be 
passed or adapted for society within an acceptable legal 
framework enabling us to develop along the lines of social 
justice and in a manner promoting sustained development of the 
economy rather than merely grope our way along. We maintain that 
in order to win we must judge, and the democratic struggle lies 
in strengthening the institutions of government. 
  [Lacayo Guerra] Deputy Alfredo Cesar has claimed that the 
ruling was rigged because the UNO is not properly represented on 
the CNPP even though it won the elections. What comments do you 
think such an observation merits? 
  [Jarquin] Cesar's claim is incongruous. He has been saying 
that it is he who gives the new board legitimacy and now he 
wants to maintain that the composition of the CNPP is not in 
keeping with the nation's laws. What is incongruous is that they 
did appeal a ruling by the CNPP to the Supreme Election Council. 
I say that by lodging an appeal, they are tacitly recognizing 
the validity of the Council of Political Parties. They have the 
right to appeal, but Cesar has been saying that since there is 
an appeal, the CNPP resolution is suspended. It is they who are 
suspended, not us. One must abide by the law and the CNPP is the 
body that governs and controls political parties in Nicaragua. 
We must be respectful of such bodies and not resort to the 
tactic that whenever something does not go in favor of any one 
person, then one is accused of belonging to or being allied with 
the government or the Sandinists. Such a tactic cannot continue 
in Nicaragua. Here we must have sectors of national life that 
want to advance and implement a national program to further the 
democratic process. 
  [Lacayo Guerra] Have you had contact with the members of the 
Supreme Election Council in order to defend yourselves, as you 
have the right to do, and what resolution do you expect from 
that body? 
  [Jarquin] We intend to pay the Supreme Election Council a 
courtesy visit and hope the judges will review everything done 
and the evidence provided by those of us who abide by the law. 
There are absolutely no human rights violations or violations of 
the political constitution. We continue to be right because we 
have abided by the law. The problem is that when someone does 
something wrong, he always ends badly. From the standpoint of 
our organization, we have statutes that must be respected. 
  [Lacayo Guerra] The UNO recently issued a bulletin stating 
that the real authorities in the PSD are Guillermo Potoy, 
president of the PSD, and Alfredo Cesar, secretary general. 
  [Jarquin] It is not comrade Eli Altamirano, coordinator of 
what is left of the UNO, who decides who has legitimacy. We have 
government institutions for that purpose. They determine who the 
legitimate officials of a party are and they must be respected. 
  [Lacayo Guerra] What does the future hold for the PSD? What 
will happen to the group of leaders sanctioned by the party's 
disciplinary council? 
  [Jarquin] We have entered a phase of strengthening our 
structures. We maintain that what we are trying to determine is 
how to get back on the social democratic path. The PSD had 
shifted to the right and lost its identity. We have a role to 
play in building the history of Nicaragua. When this party was 
conceived, it was conceived as a party of the center left, a 
viable alternative for Nicaraguans with aspirations to resolve 
the problems of the country, which is facing social injustice. 
We are going to put out a political manifesto defining our lines 
of action, which basically number four. 
  [Lacayo Guerra] What are the four lines of action that you 
have defined? 
  [Jarquin] The first must be to strengthen our country's 
political stability. Second, we must contribute to Nicaragua's 
economic takeoff. Third, we must expand and activate the social 
democratic rank and file. Fourth, we must renew and broaden our 
international relations. On this last point, I would point out 
that we recently acted as observers for the general elections in 
Costa Rica. We met with the president of the National Liberation 
Party, Dr. Carlos Manuel Castillo, and even with President-elect 
Jose Maria Figueres. We also met in the Dominican Republic with 
Jose Francisco Pena Gomez, vice president of the Socialist 
International. We have made different international contacts so 
that this project will not be confined to the organizational 
strengthening of the party and active participation in 
parliamentary debates and specific political tasks. Rather, on 
the international level, we want to find help and support of 
social democratic friends abroad. 
  [Lacayo Guerra] What is the situation of your bench in 
Parliament and its programs? Will you be integrated into the 
Political Council of Benches? 
  [Jarquin] We will join the Political Council of Benches 
because we have a great deal to contribute. We must not forget 
that Parliament is going through a new phase in which we must 
participate with solid criteria so as to strengthen that 
institution of government which the Legislative Branch is, 
drafting acceptable laws for the people of Nicaragua and helping 
to strengthen the other branches of government. The political 
action line in Parliament will be to seek reforms of the 
political constitution. In that sense, while my party was part 
of the UNO, we participated in a commission that engaged in a 
dialogue with the Sandinist Front and we hope to participate in 
the Political Council of Benches in a like manner. We want to 
make our best contributions with respect to the Law of Military 
Organization and other important laws that will be debated and 
passed this year. We shall also continue to contribute to the 
country's stability. 
  [Lacayo Guerra] Could you sum up your experiences in the 
political battle that you have won over the other sector of 
social democrats led by Alfredo Cesar? 
  [Jarquin] The members of this movement are young and 
courageous members who, despite all manner of schemes used 
against us, have held fast and put up a good fight. It was not 
easy to face a group that is self-governing and that sets itself 
up as the owner of truth when anyone opposing what they consider 
to be the truth is accused of being allied with the government 
or the Sandinist Front. I repeat: It was not easy. We were 
looking for a way to contribute to the sustained development 
that is so essential to the country. We shall be guided by the 
thought that it must be Nicaragua that emerges as the winner. 
  [Lacayo Guerra] In quantitative terms, what is the 
composition of your bench? 
  [Jarquin] Right now we have four deputies, without counting 
the two persons sanctioned by the party, Alfredo Cesar and Adan 
Morales, but we shall soon increase that number to six. 
  [Lacayo Guerra] Who are the other two? 
  [Jarquin] We are waiting for the right time to move ahead. 
We 
are involved in talks with them and for the time being I prefer 
not to divulge their names. 
  [Lacayo Guerra] You have said that the crisis in your party 
occurred because a majority group wants to make reforms in the 
constitution. Do you have a proposal? 
  [Jarquin] No, we have no proposal, but I personally 
participated in the drafting of a joint proposal between the 
Sandinist Front and what was the UNO at the time. 
  [Lacayo Guerra] That FSLN-UNO proposal was thwarted and only 
the Sandinist Front signed it. Do you still agree with the 
spirit of that document? 
  [Jarquin] I agree with the document. I believe there are 
certain points requiring further discussion since we cannot 
close our minds to any potential debate. I am specifically 
referring to international economic agreements. Their approval 
must be subject to the participation of other sectors, not just 
the National Assembly. 
  [Lacayo Guerra] What is your view of the impossibility of 
reelecting the president and the ban on relatives of the 
president being candidates? 
  [Jarquin] I do not think we can give first or last names to 
a 
restriction because we are talking about legislation for the 
nation, for the future. Let us remember that the constitution 
governs all Nicaraguans. It is not a matter of closing the door 
to other persons because of political desirability. Some groups 
say there must be no reelection at all. I am of the opinion that 
it should be allowed in alternate periods, but I would like to 
hear all opinions and learn the experience of other countries. 
Costa Rica has no reelection, but I realize that there is a 
struggle to reform the constitution in that country to allow 
such reelection. It is argued that four years is a very short 
time for a president to carry out his platform. That is why I 
agree that the term be five years, but I do not have a closed 
mind on the subject. In the National Assembly, we must be open 
to public debate, with all groups saying what they think. We are 
building for the future and we cannot erect obstacles. 
  [Lacayo Guerra] It is said that Antonio Lacayo is a 
potential 
presidential candidate and that the Democratic Social Party that 
you head would support him. Your comments? 
  [Jarquin] It is too soon to speak of such a possibility, 
first of all because Antonio Lacayo is not a member of the PSD. 
  [Lacayo Guerra] But many ministers and government officials 
are members of the PSD National Directorate. 
  [Jarquin] Well, we must start from the fact that the PSD 
participated actively in Violeta Chamorro's campaign. Our party 
supplied the activists, and many of the president's bodyguards 
and chauffeurs come from the PSD. Some ministers are also from 
the PSD because we believed and continue to believe that the 
process which began on 25 February 1990 must have continuity. 
There must be a national program to further democracy in 
Nicaragua. Right now we cannot talk about any candidacy of 
Antonio Lacayo. The opponents of our decision are the ones 
supporting that view. We could talk in the future, but right now 
we face the task of strengthening our structures. 
  [Lacayo Guerra] What future do you envision for the group of 
social democrats headed by Alfredo and Guillermo Potoy? 
  [Jarquin] They have three options: to form a new party, and 
it is already being rumored that they are thinking about forming 
a party called the Nicaraguan Democratic Party or something 
similar. Their appeal to the Supreme Election Council is an 
attempt to gain six months, the time they think they need to win 
our rank and file. Second, they can ally themselves with the 
right and adopt a policy of confrontation. They would need such 
a party in order to do so. Third, another party could take them 
in, but I do not know which party would. It is said that the 
Communist Party would take Alfredo Cesar. That could happen, 
right? (Laughter)

<F P=106> [Interview with FSLN National Directorate Member Bayardo </F>
Arce by Noel Irias; place and date not given; first four 
paragraphs are BARRICADA introduction] 
  [Text] Bayardo Arce, a member of the National Directorate 
of the FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation Front], feels that 
his party's priority must be to support the workers and 
producers who have been hurt by the government's economic 
policies. 
  Arce emphasized the need to support--and not for electoral 
purposes--the agricultural and industrial producers "who do not 
see their work yielding any profits," and who are harassed by 
high bank interest rates and a fiscal policy that makes it 
impossible for their products to compete in Central America. 
  The Sandinist leader said the FSLN should form alliances for 
the 1996 elections in order to offer Nicaraguan society a 
consensus political platform. 
  In speaking of the selection of candidates for the 1996 
national elections, Arce said that "any member will have the 
right to seek the nomination or to propose nonmembers of the 
FSLN as candidates. No one should be disturbed by that or reject 
those potential candidates or suggestions for candidates." 
  [Irias] What should the FSLN's priority be until 1996? 
  [Arce] Our top priority must be to stand at the side of 
civil 
society to defend its interests and solve its problems. We 
cannot seek an election victory with fancy words and abstract 
concepts. 
  Coffee growers and cattlemen now face severe credit problems 
that threaten them with the loss of their properties. Business 
and industry have serious problems because they can not even 
compete in Central America because of the current fiscal policy; 
and there is terrible and growing unemployment. 
  Our priority must be to stand in support with those sectors. 
And in 1996 to offer alternatives so the nation can move 
forward. It is a vital and strategic necessity for Sandinism to 
win the 1996 elections. 
  Sandinism is the only political force in the history of 
Nicaragua that has presented innovative alternatives. We broke 
with the either/or dichotomy of liberals and conservatives and 
gave Nicaraguan society a number of political and economic 
options, multiple possiiblities for expressing itself. 
  If that program were to suffer a political setback in 1996, 
it might well mean that an exclusionary and absolutist concept 
from the past could be reinstated, in which only liberals and 
conservatives could take part in the process. 
  That is the intention of liberals and conservatives when 
they 
say: "We have to get rid of Sandinism and other small political 
groups." That would be catastrophic for the nation's future. 
  [Irias] Does that mean that the FSLN should stand in support 
with those sectors in order to win the elections? 
  [Arce] Standing with sectors of society wins you the status 
of a credible negotiator, but we are not doing that just to win 
votes. 
  We defend the transformations which we brought about. When 
we 
support the rights of people who were helped by Agrarian Reform 
or who were given urban lots, we do so for the principle of 
economic democratization, although we know that many of those 
people voted against the FSLN. 
  Because of that democratizing principle, we support the 
privatization of businesses, with their workers to become the 
owners of these businesses. If those workers worked to build 
them and keep them going, it is just that they should have the 
possibility of becoming the owners of those businesses. 
  In addition, we say that properties which were improperly 
confiscated should be returned when that is possible, and when 
it is not possible to return those properties, compensation must 
be made. 
  [Irias] The FSLN's secretary general, Daniel Ortega, said 
the 
1996 election will be between Sandinism and Somozism. Do you 
agree? 
  [Arce] When Daniel Ortegs says the 1996 election will be 
between Somoza and Sandino, I think he means that the strength 
shown by the PLC [expansion not given] in the Atlantic Coast 
makes clear the danger of bringing back those exclusionary 
concepts which were expressed in Somozism. 
  Arnoldo Aleman talks about getting rid of Sandinism and 
calls 
us SOB's, thieves, and murderers. Those are pejorative 
descriptions to use in a democratic system. Still, I do not 
believe that Aleman's group represents Somozism; Somozism was an 
integrated economic and military force. 
  Accepting that idea would mean that the National Police and 
the Army are acting in support of that exclusionary and 
repressive philosophy. I would be very careful about saying that 
the antagonism is between Sandinism and Somozism. Many of the 
young people who will be voting in 1996 were not yet born when 
the dictatorship was overthrown. They have no idea of what 
Somozism was. 
  I think Daniel is warning people that the danger exists that 
those elements of Somozism might be restored. 
  [Irias] Should the FSLN form alliances for the 1996 
elections? 
  [Arce] I personally believe the FSLN should form alliances 
to 
run in the 1996 elections. We have to seek an alliance, and not 
just in order to neutralize the danger of a restoration of 
Somozism. 
  The polarization of the nation has reached such profound 
levels--despite the attempts made to establish a philosophy of 
reconcilation--that Nicaraguan society is still divided, wary, 
and suspicious. 
  That is why it is so important to offer society a consensus 
platform in which other political, economic, and social groups 
will take part, no matter what their size, so that through the 
alliance a truly national platform may be developed. 
  [Irias] What might be the mechanism for selecting 
candidates? 
  [Arce] If you start from this idea, obviously the FSLN will 
have to establish a mechanism to select suitable people and a 
mechanism to round off those candidacies with candidates from 
the other groups in the alliance. 
  We cannot go to the 1996 elections simply to win votes and 
declare that we are winning. We have to do so with suitable 
people who can really put this national program into practice, 
candidates who are sensitive to the people. 
  [Irias] And how might the FSLN candidates be chosen? 
  [Arce] The present FSLN Statutes--and I do not think they 
are 
going to change--say that the Congress selects the candidates. 
It has been proposed that the Extraordinary Congress in May 
convene an Ordinary Congress to be held within the next two 
years to select the FSLN candidates, as well as to handle other 
matters. 
  I think that in this democratic process any member will have 
the right to seek the nomination or to nominate someone else, 
even someone not in the party, if that person has the right 
qualities to meet the goals proposed. 
  No one should be disturbed by that or reject those potential 
candidates or suggestions for candidates, much less sabotage the 
choice, for that is unworthy of the quality we Sandinists should 
have. 
  [Irias] What should the FSLN do to be ready for 1996? 
  [Arce] In 1996 we must first of all have become credible 
negotiators speaking for the interests of the workers and the 
poorest sectors of society, those who are now sunk in 
hopelessness because of the current economic policy. We even 
suggest giving priority attention to the campesinos. 
  In addition, we need to serve as representatives and 
spokespersons for the nation's productive sectors, who see that 
their hard work is not paying off. 
  In 1996 the FSLN needs to be positioned as the hope of 
Nicaraguan society to move the nation forward in a realistic 
manner. 
  No one in Sandinism thinks that the party can again try do 
do 
what we did in the government in the same way that we did it 
before. 
  [Irias] How should the state be run? 
  [Arce] On government policy we state--and this is true for 
the present time when we are not in the government and also for 
when we are--that we are opposed to holding absolute power. 
  We want to promote social self-management, the role of civil 
society's organizations as an active component with a role to 
play in shaping the nation's destiny. 
  We also favor the decentralization of power through 
municipal 
governments. Putting the government in a balanced role as a 
guide for the economy. 
  On relations with the United States, a decisive factor in 
our 
national situation, we seek a relationship of mutual respect, a 
relationship that is not only a matter of words, but one in 
harmony with the new international context, in which economic 
rationales prevail. 
  [Irias] How do you conceive the new leadership body of the 
FSLN? 
  [Arce] A new leadership organization needs to be created, 
and 
the National Directorate should disappear. That name creates a 
distorted image in the minds of some party members, who think 
about what it has meant during the past decade. 
  I believe a leadership organization needs to be established 
with more people to bring together the experience of cadres who 
have already held those responsibilities with other cadres who 
have acquired both moral and political authority. 
  It would be wise for this leadership organization to have an 
executive body with responsibility for handling different areas: 
organization, training, finances, propaganda, international 
relations, etc. 
  The Congress only elected the General Secretary and the 
Treasurer. We do not have anyone who can be held accountable for 
the other jobs. I think the new election should distribute 
individual responsibilities so we can generate the collegial 
style of operation which has been weakened during the past two 
years. 
  I support the idea that the responsibility of the Secretary 
General should be separate from the duties of the head of 
government, especially as it may well be that our candidate for 
president will not be from the Front. 
  [Irias] Do you hope to be elected a member of that executive 
body? 
  [Arce] Of an executive body, no, I definitely have no desire 
for that. I have already spent over 10 years doing that. On the 
subject of the leadership organization, what I can tell you is 
that I never tried to run or presented myself as a candidate for 
membership of the National Directorate. I came in to fight for 
"Patria Libre o Muerte" [Liberty or Death]. 
  In 1977, after the death of Oscar Turcios and Ricardo 
Morales, Pedro Arauz told me that the members of the leadership 
of the GPP [Prolonged Popular War] faction to which I belonged 
had chosen me as a member of the leadership of that organization. 
  In 1979 they informed me from abroad that I had been named a 
member of the Joint National Directorate. 
  During the first Congress, the DN [National Directorate] 
decided not to stake out personal options, but instead to go "as 
a slate," to take collegial responsbility for the decisions we 
had made and the pledge to promote the transition from Sandinism 
toward greater democracy. 
  I am not going to "toss my hat in the ring" or campaign, but 
if I am nominated and elected to a leadership post, I will 
handle my responsibilities in the same way that I did when I was 
a courier, a student leader, or an underground cadre. If not, I 
will do whatever I can as a grass-roots activist. 
  [Irias] People say that some DN members are involved in 
managing FSLN assets. How are those assets managed? 
  [Arce] The way in which the party's assets will be handled 
is 
going to be decided by the Congress. It is important to make it 
clear that for some time now these assets have not been managed 
by members of the National Directorate. 
  Moreover, this is separate from the political leadership. 
That is a legal requirement, because the FSLN, as a party, is a 
nonprofit organization. By law, no party as such may have any 
business activities. 
  Only through a business organization outside the party like 
any other business arrangement can we try to engage in business 
ventures to benefit the organization and earn a financial return. 
  In the beginning, some members of the DN--Jaime Wheelock, 
Sergio Ramirez and myself--were asked to set up that 
organizational process that has now been completed. No specific 
member of the DN administers that business plan. The party 
treasurer controls these assets and it is the treasurer who will 
provide the appropriate report to the Congress. 
  [Irias] There are complaints from FSLN members in the 
Atlantic Coast area about the lack of support they have received 
from the national organization. What is your opinion? 
  [Arce] Actually, we did neglect the Coast from the central 
level, as a result of the 1990 defeat. The idea was that 
everyone would "cultivate his own garden," at least until the 
election campaign in the Coast. 
  The Front was divided about getting involved in that 
campaign, because Sandinist groups formed and created 
independent slates of candidates in the RAAN [Northern Atlantic 
Autonomous Region]. What the PLC did was to join in alliance 
with Yatama de Fagoth, for their interest was not autonomy or 
the problems of the Coast, but rather to create a political 
impact...and that is just what happened.

    [Editorial Report] Managua LA TRIBUNA in Spanish of 18 
March 1994 on page 7B reports that over the next few weeks the 
National Enterprise for Staple Foods (Enabas) will export 60,000 
quintals of black beans to Venezuela, the United States, Costa 
Rica, and the Dominican Republic. According to Enabas Executive 
Director Alfredo Guzman, Enabas will buy 25 percent of the total 
production from growers for 105 to 110 cordobas per quintal. 
Enabas exports will generate $1.4 million. Guzman predicts that 
the country will export 240,000 quintals, totalling $5 million. 
The article explains that the cultivation of black beans, a 
nontraditional product grown for export, is sponsored by the 
Nicaraguan Investors Financial Institute, the Social Action 
Ministry, and nongovernmental organizations. Growers include 
6,000 peasants from Chontales, Nueva Segovia, and Matagalpa. 
According to Guzman, yields average 20 quintals per manzana with 
production costs of 78 cordobas per quintal. Enabas is offering 
incentives to producers to increase the area under cultivation, 
the article reports.

<F P=106> [From the "Telemetro Reports" newscast] </F>
  [Text] National Bank of Panama General Manager Luis 
Horacio Moreno said that the money-laundering charges made by 
the United States against Panama are unfair and that the biggest 
money launderers are in the United States. Luis H. Moreno 
refuses to accept the conclusions of a U.S. report, which states 
that the Panamanian Government has implemented several measures 
to reduce the risks involved in misusing the Panamanian banking 
center. 
  [Begin Moreno recording] Bankers in the National Banking 
Association, among whom I count myself as a representative of 
the National Bank of Panama, have done and continue to do 
everything possible to reduce the incidence and risk of misuse 
of our services in the form of money laundering. We have not 
done it because the United States asked us to or because we want 
to qualify for a loan, but because we are convinced that 
attacking and fighting money laundering is a patriotic duty. In 
so doing, we are also fighting drug trafficking, one of the 
worst plagues of our time, which jeopardizes our young people 
and our entire community. That is the real reason; it is not to 
qualify as one of the good little boys. 
  All we want is to fulfill our patriotic duty. This 
government has carried out innumerable actions and made great 
effort that have been unacknowledged until now. Beginning in 
March 1990 we took effective steps to control cash deposits at 
banks. Since then and for the last four years, Panama has 
implemented an incredible number of controls such as that last 
measure you just mentioned: declaring the amount of cash one is 
bringing into the country when going through customs, which is 
something many other countries do. We will continue to do so, 
because this is not something that will go away with two, three, 
or even 100 measures. The United States, which is the 
qualifying party, launders the most money in the world. The 
United States invests tens of billions of dollars each year and 
they have still been unable to do solve the problem. [end

<F P=106> [From the "Forum" column] </F>
  [Text] U.S. authorities have been accusing our country of 
being a center for regular and abundant drug-related money 
laundering. They have done this without, in any instance, giving 
specific details regarding the persons, place, and time the 
actions have taken place. In addition, they have done it 
indirectly, without denoting the attitude of a serious 
government such as that of the United States, a country seeking 
to end that illegal business. The U.S. accusations indicate a 
rather obvious intention to tarnish the country so as to free 
itself partly of the social stigma of currently being the 
largest drug consumer worldwide. 
  If instead of trying to raise "doubts" regarding the 
reputation not only of our country, but also of other nations on 
the continent, Washington tried to outline joint strategies to 
solve this serious problem, then the sincere will of the U.S. 
Administration to stop the illegal business of those who come to 
our countries to "clean up" would become evident. [sentence as 
published] Then those countries, and their governments, 
including Panama, would have a greater chance to succeed in this 
fight against the negative forces of the U.S.-fed, thriving, and 
powerful drug enterprise. These countries south of the Rio 
Grande could never generate so much money because they do not 
have it; and if they had it, they would use it to satiate the 
overwhelming hunger of their peoples and not to use and abuse 
cocaine, marijuana, and their many byproducts. In this serious 
war, Washington should be the one to set an example for the 
other participants.

  [Text] Ernesto Perez Balladares, presidential candidate for 
the United People political alliance, yesterday called for 
compliance with the Torrijos-Carter Treaties during a meeting 
with U.S. congressmen who advocate U.S. military presence in 
Panama beyond the year 2000. 
  "Compliance with the Torrijos-Carter Treaties is the most 
advisable thing for the United States and Panama," Perez 
Balladares told U.S. Congressmen Phil Crane and Howard Phillips 
[title as published], who are holding talks in Panama to promote 
a law before the U.S. Congress to extend the U.S. military 
presence in Panama after 31 December 1999. 
  Perez Balladares said his government would be "willing to 
hold talks" if the United States should request discussions on 
defense issues and on a U.S. military presence beyond the year 
2000. 
  The United People candidate said: "We held very frank 
talks." 
He added that times have changed and currently "our interests 
and the interests of the United States are focused on the war 
against drugs and drug trafficking." 
  Perez Balladares said drugs are causing havoc in Panama, 
adding that, if he wins the 8 May elections, he will ask 
neighboring countries, specifically Costa Rica and Colombia, "to 
establish a united Latin American front to fight drugs." The 
struggle against drugs, the presidential candidate added, must 
be based on mutual respect that must prevail among free, 
independent, and sovereign countries. 
  Perez Balladares' meeting with Congressmen Crane and 
Phillips, who were accompanied by about 20 people, took place in 
the afternoon in the Blue Room of the Continental Hotel.

<F P=106> [Report by Victor de la Hoz from the "Day to Day" newscast] </F>
  [Text] CADE [Annual Conference of Business Executives] 94, 
organized by the Panamanian Association of Business Executives 
[APEDE], continued today with the participation of the 
presidential candidates, who explained their government 
platforms. 
  The first candidate to speak was Ruben Dario Carles of 
Change 
94. He was followed by Jose Salvador Munoz of the Doctrinaire 
Panamenist Party, then by Ernesto Perez Balladares of the United 
People alliance. 
  Professor Ruben Dario Carles pointed out the previous 
government's administrative mistakes in handling public 
finances. Carles said that 21 years of military government left 
a $7.2-billion financial disaster due to the lack of an 
appropriate fiscal policy. The Change 94 candidate stressed that 
payment of the foreign debt must be preceded by attention to the 
country's social debt. 
  [Begin Carles recording] There has been an obvious, general 
deterioration of basic public services, but this failure is not 
the result of a lack of funds. It is due to a lack of 
structural efficiency by the government caused in many cases by 
legislation imposed by the dictatorship. Gentlemen, forget it; 
the government cannot do it all. Those who believe that the 
government is going to satisfy everyone who asks for something 
are dead wrong. That is impossible. This country is bankrupt 
and has no credit. [end recording] 
  The event is organized by the APEDE and is being held in a 
local hotel. Six of the seven presidential candidates are 
participating. Arnulfist Party candidate Mireya Moscoso de 
Gruber declined to attend. 
  Doctrinaire Panamenist Party candidate Jose Salvador Munoz 
seriously criticized President Guillermo Endara's 
administration, calling it a continuation of militarism. He 
also said that the country's social problems have not been 
solved. Ernesto Perez Balladares of the United People alliance 
based his speech on giving priority to resolving the country's 
social problems as part of his government's platform. 
  [Begin Perez Balladares recording] The potential natural, 
human, and financial resources that Panama has available 
guarantee an increase in Panamanians' quality of life. The 
previously mentioned human development guidelines implicitly 
include the adoption of a strategy of equitable economic growth 
to serve as a source of and support for the country's overall 
development. 
  In my administration, the economic growth program will mean: 
  1. [number as heard] The rational and effective use of the 
reverted areas and areas that will revert in accordance with the 
Torrijos-Carter Treaties. This should allow us to coherently 
plan our development model, ensuring that the benefits gained 
are accessible to all areas of the country and to all 
Panamanians. [end recording] 
  CADE 94 ends this afternoon.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on developments related to the Panamanian elections 
scheduled for 8 May 1994: 
  Ruben Dario Carles, the presidential candidate for the 
Nationalist Liberal Republican Movement [Molirena], said on 1 
April that as soon as he becomes president, he will implement a 
program to improve, expand, and modernize public transportation 
services in Panama City and the interior. Carles pointed out 
that he will promote the participation of cooperatives, private 
companies, and independent transportation workers. (Panama City 
LA PRENSA in Spanish 2 April 94 p 5A) 
  According to the latest CID-Gallup poll, conducted from 20 
to 
26 March in 1,204 homes, Ernesto Perez Balladares, presidential 
candidate for the Democratic Revolutionary Party [PRD] leads the 
field of presidential candidates with 34 percent of public 
support; followed by Carles, 15 percent; Blades, presidential 
candidate for the Papa Egoro Movement, 12 percent; Mireya 
Gruber, presidential candidate for the Arnulfist Party, 11 
percent; and Eduardo Vallarino, presidential candidate for the 
Christian Democratic Party [PDC], 4 percent. (Panama City EL 
PANAMA AMERICA in Spanish 4 April 94 pp 8A, 9A) 
  Following the funeral mass for PRD member Mauricio Foster, 
victim of an allegedly political attack, Ernesto Perez 
Balladares asserted: "I urge fellow party members to show their 
civic awareness and patriotism, to be aware that there will be 
more provocations, and to avoid violence and sorrow at all 
costs." (Panama City Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 
GMT 5 April 94) 
  On 5 April, Ruben Carles met with teachers' groups, to whom 
he presented his proposal on education. Carles believes the 
approval of new laws on education reform is crucial. In his 
proposal, he mentioned the need for reforms that guarantee that 
those people who have the ability to teach be allowed to work 
and have training opportunities. He added that public finances 
must be strengthened to improve teachers' salaries and that 
social programs to enhance school-home relations and programs 
for adult literacy and training must be resumed. (Panama City 
EL SIGLO in Spanish 6 April 94 p 14) 
  During a meeting with members of the diplomatic corps, Perez 
Balladares emphasized: "We will be very strict in dealing with 
government corruption." He added: "Security concerns will be 
addressed through the professionalization of the National 
Police, which will definitely remain under civilian control." 
Regarding his foreign policy, Perez Balladares noted that what 
Panama needs is respect, fraternity, and friendship with the 
United States and other Latin American nations. (Panama City 
Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 6 April 94) 
  A recent Veritas Data poll conducted nationwide on 28 and 29 
March shows that over 80 percent of Panamanians plan to vote in 
the 8 May elections. Other findings include that 73 percent of 
Panamanians say they have watched the presidential debates and 
that Perez Balladares' performance created the most favorable 
impression. (Panama City Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300

  [Text] Deputy Sergio Lopez, a member of the Chamber of 
Deputies Defense Committee, yesterday visited the Armed Forces 
Command building where he met with Colonel Carlos Medina 
Monjagata, the Military Forces' public relations director. 
  Lopez was accompanied by Deputy Carlos Riveros and Senator 
Fernando Pfannl. The visitors wanted to clarify the incident on 
5 April when NOTICIAS photographer Ismael Villalba was held for 
one hour after he committed "the sin" of photographing a 
conversation between Lopez and soldier Crispulo Sanchez. 
  A captain whose last name is Galeano and other two officers 
were also arrested as a consequence of this incident. 
  "The colonel told us there had been a misunderstanding in 
the 
case of the reporter and explained that the Armed Forces does 
not intend to restrict freedom of the press," the deputy said. 
  Regarding the arrest of the captain and the other officers, 
the colonel said they were arrested for not carrying out the 
already famous "order from above." The deputy, however, could 
not say who gave that order. 
  "It seems that the order was that I could not speak with the 
soldier either despite the colonel's remark that the soldier was 
at my disposal. Those were the two reasons for the arrest of 
Galeano and his comrades," the deputy said.

<F P=106> [Article by Carlos Martini: "Why a Coup d'Etat?"] </F>
  [Text] There was a time when the hazard was real: on 
Saturday, 2 January 1993 (just 3 days after the Electoral Court 
of the ANR [National Republican Association--Colorado Party] 
released unofficial data giving the victory to the Argana-Ybanez 
ticket [for the Colorado Party presidential nomination] as 
opposed to the ticket supported by General Oviedo). On other 
occasions, the rumors were mere speculation. 
  Moreover, in the case of Paraguay, the risk of an 
interruption, or even the reversal of the democratic process, 
cannot be rejected. But today the possibilities for a 
traditional coup are very few. This is not, however, because of 
the democratic characteristics of a certain protagonist who 
could head a military revolt. Oviedo has proven, with sufficient 
evidence, that democratic norms and procedures are dead letters 
for him. But he is aware that it is not suitable--nor does he 
right now have the reasons to do so--to interrupt the process. 
He has the necessary power to allow him to project himself into 
the future. The fact is that he is one of the powers behind the 
government. The current and inconclusive transitional scenario 
permits this play of parallel powers. Referring to the current 
scenario, Diego Abente Brun says: "Civilian and political 
freedom will presumably be maintained and expanded, but the 
contest to guarantee that the election results will not endanger 
the hegemony of the military and/or the governing party will be 
limited. This scenario of continuous and gradual liberalization 
is what at other times has been called restrictive democracy." 
("Scenarios for the Future" in Abente Brun, Diego (compiler), 
"Paraguay in Transition." Caracas, Nueva Sociedad, 1993, page 
234). 
<H5>  Eternal Transition </H5>
  In other words, and in this respect, an inconclusive 
transition and restrictive democracy are one and the same. 
Abente Brun's description corresponds to the phase that we are 
now experiencing. But what is even more worrying is the fact 
that it is a scenario that can be projected to 1996 [municipal 
elections] and 1998 [presidential elections] if certain 
substantial changes do not occur in the judicial branch and the 
Armed Forces. If the two branches are not purged of party 
politics, especially the Electoral Court, the 1998 elections 
could be a repetition, even including an improved version of its 
vices, of what happened in 1993. Therefore, from the perspective 
of those who are trying to outline the game plan for the current 
power elite for the years after 1998, the most important thing 
is not a coup d'etat (it would cause many problems with the 
international community: read loans). They will try to overcome 
all possible obstacles in an attempt to ensure that there are no 
institutions that will effectively guarantee the free play of 
democracy, but will maintain the facade and sufficient public 
freedom in order to legitimize themselves in the external 
spheres. 
  Therefore, the central theme for completing the transition 
does not reside so much in the risk of a coup d'etat, at least 
not under current circumstances. The axis of the debate should 
be centered on the mechanisms that favor the adapting of certain 
institutions and leaderships to democratic conditions. And it is 
here where we have the risks, as we have said above, of bogging 
down. The changes in the judicial branch do not favor the 
creation of a favorable atmosphere for that democratic 
institutionalization. 
<H5>  The Agendas Blend </H5>
  Since mid-February the social agenda, which has been 
repeatedly announced in previous evaluations, has been added to 
this inconclusive political transition. From that date we now 
find ourselves in a time of key definitions. On the one hand it, 
is a question of trying to close the political transition 
agenda, and on the other, and at the same time, undertake public 
social policies that will include the poorest sectors. 
  But neither the political nor the social agenda can be 
undertaken by just one political protagonist. And much less so 
can this protagonist come from the Colorado Party, which lacks 
stability in its leadership and which has a minority in 
Congress, in addition to the split due to the dissidence of the 
Argana faction. The scenario calls for a policy of basic 
consensus. But we return to the beginning; during this phase, 
the basic consensus must include priority for drastic changes in 
the judicial branch and modifications in certain leaderships in 
the Armed Forces. If the Liberals [Authentic Liberal Radical 
Party] and National Encounter accept any type of agreement 
without clear demands and commitments that will be complied with 
(as opposed to what President Wasmosy did with the 13 January 
[1994] "democratic commitment"), then they will be betting in 
favor of strengthening restrictive democracy and in the medium 
term for maintenance of the invisible powers.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Jara V.: "Cocaine Riders Take Root in </F>
Paraguay"] 
  [Text] The seizure of two kilos of very pure cocaine by the 
antinarcotics police last week pales into insignificance when 
compared with the 60 small planes loaded with cocaine that 
depart daily from our territory for Brazil. 
  This comparison clearly establishes the great difference 
between the power of the police and that of the mafia 
organizations, which have taken root in our country, are a 
reality, and not even the police or the government can do 
anything against them. 
  It has been known for a long time--as prophesied by U.S. 
Embassy experts and even the police--that Paraguay is a point of 
transit for cocaine on its way to the great underground markets 
of the American continent and Europe. 
  It is known that there are clandestine airstrips in the 
hills 
of Amambay, Alto Parana, Canindeyu, and throughout the Chaco 
region. 
  The absence of insufficient action by the government has 
allowed the establishment in Paraguay of contacts for the 
Colombian and Bolivian mafia groups that make huge profits from 
cocaine. 
  This lack of action by the government, not just the current 
administration but also previous ones, has made Paraguay--in 
everybody's eyes--a great shelter for criminals and the center 
of large illegal negotiations. 
  The Brazilians now surprise us with concrete information 
that 
Colombian and Bolivian drug barons are using our territory to 
land, reload their illegal shipments, and calmly depart for the 
Brazilian markets. 
  At least 60 small planes depart from our country every day, 
carrying cocaine to Brazil. This is alarming. 
  Is it possible that this number of flights could occur 
without the knowledge of our authorities--be they the police, 
the National Directorate for Civilian Aviation, or even the 
Armed Forces themselves? We doubt it. 
  The concrete issue of all this is that the lack of 
government 
action has allowed traffickers to definitively take root in our 
country, turning it into a drug corridor. The appropriate 
measures were not taken in time; but not because they were 
unaware of the problem.

  [Text] Lima, 11 Apr (EFE) -- Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto 
Robaina said today that Cuba will not raise any obstacles to 
returning to the OAS if the members ask for it. 
  Cuba was expelled from the OAS in 1962 at the request of the 
United States. Cuba has taken a very harsh attitude since then 
to this organization, which it labeled the "U.S. Ministry of 
Colonies." 
  Robaina said that "nothing can be evaluated in the same 
manner after 30 years," and that the Latin American countries 
also are not "under the same conditions they were three decades 
ago in relation to the OAS." 
  Robaina added: "Independently of the fact that the United 
States remains the same, which is something I cannot evaluate, I 
believe Latin America is not the same as 30 years ago. 
Therefore, the OAS can be an organization where Latin Americans 
can discuss their problems in an open, frank, and sincere 
manner." 
  He said: "If this is achieved by the OAS, by [Secretary 
General-elect] Gaviria, we would have nothing against it." 
  In reference to an eventual return of his country to that 
Latin American forum, Robaina said his country "has nothing to 
negotiate" and also does not demand that Cuba be allowed to 
return. 
  Robaina said: "We were unjustly expelled from it and we will 
return to it if voices emerge, like the ones now emerging, 
proposing the idea that the OAS must be with Cuba and not 
without Cuba." 
  He said: "If that idea becomes a reality, my country will 
raise no obstacles." 
  Regarding relations with Peru, Robaina said that "they are 
normal but we should strengthen them and not resign ourselves to 
historic relations," in allusion to the participation of 
Peruvians in the war for Cuban independence. 
  He added: "Strengthening relations means agreements like the 
one we signed today, visits like this one, visits we expect to 
receive in Cuba, and trade and economic agreements to put our 
relations at that historic level." 
  Robaina today signed with his Peruvian counterpart, Efrain 
Goldenberg, an agreement on customs cooperation and another on 
the struggle against drug trafficking. 
  Before the meeting, Robaina met about 200 Peruvian 
businessmen whom he invited to invest in Cuba after explaining 
the incentives offered by his country for foreign investment. 
  In the afternoon, Robaina was received by Jaime Yoshiyama, 
president of Congress and vice president of the Republic. 
Robaina also met Industry, Tourism, and Integration Minister 
Liliana Canale. 
  Tomorrow Robaina will pursue private activities and on 13 
April he will leave for Paraguay to continue his South American 
tour that started last week in Uruguay and includes Argentina.

  [Text] When he returns from Malaysia, Peruvian Foreign 
Minister Efrain Goldenberg will convey that government's 
interest in signing with Peru an agreement for mutual promotion 
and protection in their capacity as member countries of 
multilateral Pacific organizations. 
  According to information disclosed by the Foreign Ministry, 
the two countries have also decided to sign an agreement 
eliminating the need for visas. 
  The president of the Council of Ministers and foreign 
minister is currently in Washington, where he will participate 
in the election tomorrow of the new OAS secretary general. The 
results of this election will be disclosed at noon tomorrow. 
  In Kuala Lumpur Goldenberg closed the 10th General 
Conference 
of the South Pacific Economic Cooperation Conference (PECC) with 
the approval of a declaration emphasizing the private sector's 
participation in promoting free trade and investments for joint 
Asia-Pacific development. 
  The day before, Goldenberg addressed an audience of some 200 
bankers and investors from Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, and 
other Asian countries. 
  The minister's speech focused on the changes taking place in 
the Peruvian capital market, one of the most attractive of the 
region. 
  This phenomenon is caused by the positive influence of the 
privatization process currently under way and the consolidation 
of a national market which is opening its doors to foreign 
markets. 
  The foreign minister commented that this situation has 
benefited by Peruvian laws and recent agreements on the 
protection and promotion of investments, signed at a bilateral 
as well as multilateral level. 
  Another important aspect of the prime minister's visit is 
the 
meeting he held with one of the representatives of the Malaysian 
business sector, T.Y. Lee, who voiced his desire to invest in 
Peru. 
  Fishing and mining as well as the lumber industry were the 
sectors in which the businessmen voiced most interest. 
  Minister Goldenberg had the opportunity to meet with other 
government representatives, such as the Thai vice premier, the 
Malaysian prime minister, the U.S. National Security Council 
adviser for Asian affairs, and the Indonesian economic 
coordinating minister.

  [Text] According to the last report issued by the Apoyo 
survey company in March, President Alberto Fujimori obtained 61 
percent support for his government, which shows a three-point 
recovery of the eight points lost in February as a result of the 
promulgation of the polemic Cantuta law. Moreover, the way in 
which the government is handling the economic policy obtained 
the approval of 42 percent of the polled people, which is the 
same as last month. 
  Apoyo also asked people what they thought about the current 
government: 51 percent said they thought it was democratic and 
31 percent a dictatorship. 
  In February, however, 61 percent believed Fujimori's 
government was democratic. This 10 percent drop is probably an 
indication that the effects of the Cantuta law still prevail. 
  This probably also explains why the number of people who 
would vote for Fujimori remains at 40 percent (although the 
number of people who approve of his performance has increased), 
while those who would vote for Javier Perez de Cuellar has 
increased from 41 to 44 percent. 
  This also shows in the fact that 43 percent have said they 
will vote for Fujimori, 28 percent for an independent candidate, 
and 12 percent for an opposition candidate. Which means that the 
people favor an independent rather than an opposition candidate, 
which, in turn, is in line with the increasing support for Perez 
de Cuellar, who is not viewed as an opposition candidate but 
rather as a continuation of Fujimorism without Fujimori, as a 
"democratic" Fujimorism or free of Fujimori's "dictatorial" 
aspects. 
  However, approval for the political opposition has increased 
by one point (34 percent) and disapproval dropped by two points, 
that is, from 45 to 47 percent, which reveals a slight 
improvement. 
  Moreover, Clae [Latin American Center of Business 
Counseling] 
President Carlos Manrique's popularity has dropped since last 
November. The percentage of people who consider him a dishonest 
person has increased from 54 to 61 percent. There are, however, 
27 percent who consider him honest. 
  But only 10 percent believe in what Manrique says. Which 
means that 17 percent believe he is honest but do not believe 
what he says. Can one be honest and a liar at the same time? 
This is a paradox of polls.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on insurgent activities in Peru compiled from Peruvian 
media monitored through 11 April. 
  Alleged members of the Shining Path, SL, maoist group last 
night bombed some high tension pylons. The city of Juliaca, on 
the border with Bolivia, was left in the dark. A Latino Bank 
branch was also bombed causing serious material damage. (Madrid 
EFE in Spanish 1815 GMT 2 Apr 94) 
  A group of 183 Ashaninkas indigenous people who had been 
members of the SL for the past four years, hacked the seven SL 
leaders to death with machetes when they saw a peasant defense 
patrol coming to free them. The incident took place at dawn on 
27 March in Shequireni, on the River Tambo bank, 80 km south of 
Satipo. The terrorists were sleeping when the peasant defense 
patrol surrounded the camp to free the Ashaninkas. (Lima EL 
COMERCIO in Spanish 29 Mar 94 p A11) 
  Two members of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement 
(MRTA), 
identified as Jorge Enrique Santiago and Juan Lazaro Garcia 
Carranza, were arrested by the police in the Progreso shantytown 
in Chimbote. They were carrying submachine MGP 22480 which 
belonged to a policemen they murdered two years ago. In another 
operation, Monterrey police station personnel arrested Glicerio 
Pedro Ciriaco Pajuelo, 42, who was inciting Tahuantisuyo 
peasants to lynch Agriculture Ministry workers. (Lima EXPRESO in 
Spanish 27 Mar 94) 
  SL members, armed with AKM guns and pistols, are believed to 
have gunned down, on 26 March at point-blank range, Mayor 
Gregorio Lecca Franco, 54, of Huaylillas District, La Libertad 
Department, as he was on his way home. (Lima EXPRESO in Spanish 
27 Mar 94 p A24) 
  Colonel Adolfo Unda Rojas, chief of the Political-Military 
Command of the Apurimac Southeastern Security subzone presented 
to the media three new repentant terrorists: Comrades Roberto, 
Luis, Javicho were arrested in Amizo town, South of Apurimac on 
the border with Ayacucho. Their arrest led to the confiscation 
of literature, ammunition, fuses, and explosives in Amizo. (Lima 
EL COMERCIO in Spanish 26 Mar 94 P A11) 
  The Peruvian National Police, PNP, have completely 
dismantled 
the SL Northern Regional Committee, CRN-SL, with the arrest in 
Chiclayo of two of its most important leaders within the 
framework of the Remate-1 operation. The first to be arrested 
was Jose Flavio Gonzalez Perez, aka Pavel, 36, whom the police 
believes heads the Great Unit No. 2 of the CRN-SL. Pavel's 
brother Segundo Salvador Gonzalez Perez, aka Eduardo, 46, was 
also arrested. He leads the Lambayeque Zone Committee and CRN-SL 
Peoples' Aid Committee. Within the same operation the police 
also arrested Nolbel Torres Sanchez, 26, and Salatiel Davila 
Anambal, aka Jose, 41, who are members of the logistic support 
group for the Lambayeque Zone Committee; Luis Antonio Guerrero 
Mestanza, aka Juan, 28, a member of the so-called Peoples' 
Guerrilla Army of the Lambayeque Zone Committee; while Karl 
Lenin Gonzales Rodriguez, aka Antonio, 19, surrendered. The six 
are at the Picsi Jail. Their arrest caused the failure of the 
so-called Second National Congress which the SL was preparing in 
Chiclayo. Colone Marco Miyashiro, head of the PNP 
Counterterrorism Division, said the CRN-SL has reorganized 
itself into the Great Unit No. 1 formed by the La Libertad, 
Cajamarca, and Chimbote zone committees and Great Unit No. 2 
formed by Lambayeque, Piura, Tumbes, and Amazonas zone 
committees. (Lima LA REPUBLICA in Spanish 26 Mar 94) 
  General David Jaime Sobrevilla, head of the 
Political-Military Command of National Security Zone No. 7, 
today disclosed that in less than a year some 2,000 Ashaninkas 
indigenous people from Satipo Province have been rescued from 
the hands of terrorists and have returned to their villages to 
work. (Lima EL COMERCIO in Spanish 30 Mar 94 p A14)

  [Text] On 7 April, key national union leaders categorically 
rejected remarks by the U.S. State Department and, in 
particular, an article by U.S. Senator John Kerry in THE 
WASHINGTON POST, in which Kerry says Colombia is a 
"narcodemocracy" and its economy is pervaded by mafia activities. 
  Spokesmen for the banking, industrial, and coffee sectors 
issued statements yesterday from Cartagena, site of a banking 
convention. 
  One of the first statements was issued by Carlos Arturo 
Angel, president of the National Association of Industrialists, 
who pointed out that economies throughout the world are pervaded 
by drug trafficking and that Colombia is not a special case. 
  Angel stated: "We are a small part of a huge business which, 
among other things, conducts a substantial share of its 
operations in industrialized countries, and especially in the 
United States." Angel also asserted that U.S. laws have 
benefited drug traffickers. 
  Cesar Gonzalez, president of the Association of Financial 
Institutions, expressed his confusion about these charges, and 
he conveyed his confidence that these comments do not represent 
a widespread view or the view of the U.S. Government or Congress. 
  He noted: "The United States has viewed the countries that 
are south of the Rio Grande as one huge hacienda, and it 
believes it can submit these nations to its will." 
  Gonzalez Munoz pointed to the efforts Colombia has made to 
fight drug trafficking and the price it has paid in its fight 
against organized crime, and he added that this is why he 
believes remarks by some U.S. officials are less than 
appropriate. 
  Gonzalez added: "The existence of drug money in the economy 
cannot be denied, but this also happens in the United States." 
  Gabriel Rosas Vega, president of the Association of Coffee 
Exporters, also rejected Senator Kerry's remarks. Rosas 
indicated that the United States has no moral authority to call 
us into question because U.S. banks, both large and small, 
handle drug money. 
<H5>  More Reactions </H5>
  Rosas Vega said "we cannot bite our tongues" and avoid 
saying 
the United States is not morally qualified to speak on the 
subject. 
  Carlos Caballero Argaez, president of the Bank of Foreign 
Trade, noted that the problem "must be examined from its true 
perspective, which is that Colombia's situation cannot be viewed 
only in the light of drug trafficking activities when its 
economy depends on and is rooted in traditional exports of oil, 
coffee, ferronickel, and so on." 
  Last, Labor Minister Jose Elias Melo said that Senator 
Kerry's opinion shows total ignorance of the recent progress of 
the Colombian economy. He stated: "The fact that he has finally 
noticed Colombia's recent strength and development does not mean 
that this progress stems from drug activities; on the contrary, 
it comes from the hard work of Colombian businessmen and 
workers." 
  Melo added that efforts are being made to prevent money 
laundering, and these efforts must be perceived in a better 
light when viewed from abroad.

  [Text] Tonight, Andres Pastrana sent a letter to 17 other 
presidential candidates, asking them to demand clarification 
from the U.S. State Department regarding recent statements in 
connection with the use of drug money in the current election 
campaign. In his letter, Pastrana says these statements are 
very serious, and, therefore, all candidates are obliged to 
request that specific charges be made, including details on 
which campaigns allegedly received such money and the origin of 
any such funds.

  [Text] All indications point to the fact that Cuba will not 
be able to offer the necessary guarantees to buy approximately 
20,000 barrels of oil per day [bpd] from Colombia. Such a deal 
can only be carried out if the Cuban Government offers a letter 
of credit to Colombia -- that is, if an international bank 
finances its debt. 
  According to a study to which EL TIEMPO has gained access, 
the banks are not interested in backing Cuban debts. In fact, 
countries such as Iran and Libya suspended their supply of crude 
because of a lack of financial guarantees. 
  Although the situation improved somewhat after Russia 
resumed 
the commercial exchange of oil with Cuba in January 1994, Cuba 
still is not in any position to pay for imports. Russia will 
sell Cuba 4.0 million tons of unrefined crude in exchange for 
1.5 million tons of sugar this year. 
  The government of Fidel Castro prefers to offer Colombia a 
three-way exchange system. This means that the companies to 
which Cuba sells sugar would, in turn, pay Colombia for the 
crude. Many of the countries that receive sugar in exchange for 
oil have suspended these kinds of deals because of Cuba's 
enormous debts and because there is a surplus of sugar, and 
future production is in jeopardy. This suspension of imports 
heightens the already difficult energy situation. Cuba only has 
resources to supply 40 percent of its oil needs. 
  Even with Colombian oil, the crisis would not be resolved. 
Rather than crude, what Cuba needs is fuel, particularly fuel 
oil and diesel, to generate electricity and to compensate for 
its lack of hydraulic sources of power. This is because Cuban 
refineries are also in a state of crisis. 
  The plants in Havana and Santiago (built by Exxon and Shell) 
reportedly produce 30,000 bpd but are currently at a standstill. 
The Havana plant requires investments in the order of $100 
million, while the Santiago plant needs a $75 million investment 
to operate efficiently. Another Soviet-built plant, with the 
same capacity, and another located in Matanzas (which reportedly 
generates 5,000 bpd) are also at a standstill because of a lack 
of maintenance. 
  The new refinery located in Cienfuegos has the capacity to 
produce 60,000 bpd, but it is not operational right now and 
requires an investment of approximately $200 million to produce 
commercially viable gasoline. 
  Difficulties in generating electricity have forced Cuba to 
obtain gasoline through four international companies (Marc Rich, 
Vitol, Mabanet, and Totisa) which receive sugar and nickel as 
payment for their exports. According to the document, however, 
even refined imports have been reduced. These are now limited 
to the volumes of sugar and nickel that Cuba can offer. For 
this reason, the document questions Colombia's willingness to 
sell oil to Cuba "while other countries have decided to suspend 
sales."

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 7 Apr (EFE) -- President Cesar 
Gaviria Trujillo met in his office today with Cuban Castro 
opponent Jorge Mas Canosa, sources at the Colombian presidential 
palace confirmed to EFE. 
  Gaviria had an hour-long talk with Mas Canosa, and, 
according 
to the delegation of Cuban exiles, they discussed the sale of 
Colombian oil to Cuba, which anti-Castro groups have strongly 
criticized. 
  According to Mas Canosa's retinue, they also analyzed the 
future of relations between Cuba and the United States in the 
wake of Gaviria's election to the post of OAS secretary general 
on 27 March. 
  Two weeks ago, Huber Matos, head of the Independent and 
Democratic Cuba [Independent and Democratic Cuba--CID] movement 
visited Colombia to request suspension of the oil sale to 
Castro's government, but he did not meet with Gaviria, because, 
he said, he was not expecting to be received by "Castro's pals." 
  Matos, one of the commanders of the triumphant 1959 
revolution, which Castro now heads, said the oil sale means the 
rupture of the economic embargo the United States imposed on 
Cuba 30 years ago. 
  Colombia announced it will supply approximately 20,000 
barrels of crude a day to Cuba starting in July, under the 
condition Cuba guarantees the operation with the corresponding 
letters of credit. Castro opponents oppose the transaction, 
however, and threaten to boycott Colombian products in the 
United States.

  [Text] Guyanese President Cheddi Jagan said yesterday that 
the OAS, under the leadership of Cesar Gaviria, will have a 
greater vigor and dynamics and will recover its role as an 
inter-American democratic forum. 
  Jagan, who arrived in the country yesterday to initiate a 
three-day official visit, said his country is pleased to have 
contributed to the election of his Colombian colleague as new 
OAS secretary general. "Even though we recognize the job done 
by the OAS during all these years, we hope the presence of 
President Gaviria will add a greater dynamics and leadership to 
OAS actions," the distinguished visitor said during a dialogue 
with journalists, who waited for him at the Military 
Transportation Air Command. Jagan, who arrived in Santa Fe de 
Bogota in a Fokker jet belonging to the Colombian Presidency, 
was received by Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin de Rubio. 
  The Guyanese president said he believes his visit will go 
beyond protocol and will yield fruitful results in the field of 
integration. He also said he hopes the visit will serve to 
"expand relations between the two countries." Jagan also had 
words of praise for the Colombian foreign minister and said he 
is convinced that her personality and her work helped President 
Gaviria win the votes he needed to be elected to the OAS. 
  Jagan was accompanied by various cabinet ministers, a group 
of specialists in technical cooperation, and a team of private 
sector businessmen. The official schedule includes tours to the 
cities of Cartagena and Cali to visit the Cementos del Caribe 
processing plant and sugar mills, respectively. 
  Following their meeting with President Gaviria, each one of 
the groups that accompany the Guyanese president will meet with 
their counterparts to discuss topics of bilateral interest, 
including trade and cooperation in the areas of health, 
agriculture, education, electric energy, and tourism. 
<H5>  A Good Associate </H5>
  Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin said she hopes to 
consolidate excellent relations with Guyana, a country called 
upon to become one of Colombia's best associates. "It has a 
been a country with which we have been building very strong 
relations. It has been wonderful for me to have found, in my 
latest visits, a country so full of opportunities with which we 
can truly integrate," she said. 
  The foreign minister talked about other topics and said 
there 
is no reason why Colombia should apologize to the Cuban 
Government over the recent episode regarding the alleged 
guerrilla summit in that country. On this topic, she noted that 
the Foreign Ministry abided by the reports provided by the 
Prosecutor General's Office, adding that she always said there 
were "indications," but no definitive conclusions over the 
topic. She said she was pleased to see that Bishop Nel Beltran 
had come out unscathed in this incident, "because the Foreign 
Ministry always trusted him."

  [Text] Guyanese President Cheddi Jagan expressed concern 
over increased drug trafficking in Guyana and said that he was 
visiting Colombia with a high-raking police official who has 
been entrusted with learning how to fight this scourge. 
  "We are a little scared about the growing threat of drug 
trafficking through Guyana, especially cocaine, which probably 
comes from Colombia through Venezuela," Jagan said today. He is 
on the last day of his visit. 
  Jagan yesterday signed with President Cesar Gaviria a joint 
declaration agreeing to establish an official, private 
binational council to develop various aspects of the 
relationship. 
  The Guyanese president yesterday visited the Cementos del 
Caribe cement factory on the Atlantic Coast and the sugar 
industry in Valle Department. Guyana is interested in both 
products.

  [Text] During General Martin Balza's official three-day 
visit, the Colombian and Argentine Armies reached educational 
exchange agreements in the military sector. 
  Balza and General Hernan Jose Guzman, Colombian Army 
commander, set dates for visits to Colombia and Argentina by 
high-ranking staff officers of both armies and established a 
student exchange program for advanced military courses. 
  Thus, in principle, two Argentine officers will arrive soon 
in Colombia to take lancers courses and other military 
disciplines, while two Colombian officers will travel to 
Argentina for an advanced military intelligence course and other 
advanced studies. 
  In addition, the Colombian Army commander is scheduled to 
officially visit the Argentine Army headquarters in late June. 
  Balza praised the good relations between the two forces, 
saying: "We must try to achieve greater cooperation through 
mutually beneficial agreements. We do not have to gain each 
other's confidence, because we already have it."

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on developments related to the Colombian elections 
scheduled for 29 May. 
  Former Justice Minister Enrique Parejo Gonzalez, 
presidential 
candidate of the National Democratic Alternative (Alternative 
Democratica Nacional), has asked President Cesar Gaviria to 
appoint an international supervisory board for the elections. 
In a letter to the president, Parejo has said candidates Samper 
and Pastrana "maintain a monopoly over the media while the other 
candidates are discriminated against, in open violation of 
constitutional provisions." He has also charged state resources 
are being diverted for electoral purposes and in favor of the 
two major candidates. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 
27 March 94 p 7A) 
  During his recent visit to Miami during Holy Week, Andres 
Pastrana, New Democratic Force (NFD) presidential candidate, 
reiterated his criticism against reestablishing relations with 
Cuba. He said: "I do not think it was the right time for 
Colombia and Cuba to reestablish relations. I maintain that 
position, because when President Castro visited Colombia, all 
?he reporters of Colombia and the world asked him if he 
condemned the armed struggle, and a condemnation of the 
Colombian guerrillas never came out of his lips." Pastrana also 
said Colombia should seek the means to join NAFTA, because it 
would increase foreign investments and help the country compete 
in international markets. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in 
Spanish 2 April 94 p 6A) 
  Liberal Party (PL) candidate Ernesto Samper has said in 
Cartagena that recent expressions of support for him from 
Christian, black, and conservative groups show that people are 
convinced his campaign "is a serious and organized option." He 
has said his proposal?to the country is that of "social 
capitalism which considers people," while that of Pastrana is of 
"brutal capitalism." (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 28 
March 94 p 6A) 
  In an interview by Bibiana Mercado, Antonio Navarro Wolff, 
presidential candidate of the 19 April Movement Democratic 
Alliance (AD/M-19), has said he is sure his organization 
will,come ?n t?ird place?in the elections. Regarding the 
AD/M-19?s d?feat in t?e 13 March legislative elections, Navarro 
said i? taught him "obe has to hear?the people's voice which 
tells us we are not doing things right. We hav? to correct our 
cou?se, and?we are doing so by? Bmong other things, admitting 
there is a need for clear positions and for a message of 
definite change." He den?ea if there is a runoff between 
|??didates Samper and Pastrana, he would call for blank votes, 
saying "if I agreed with casting blan 
votes, I would not have registered as a presidential 
candidate." Asked if he is afraid the AD/M-19 might disappear, 
he said: "I am sure the AD will continue to live. I think the 
essential thing is to understand that we must go to the local 
e?ections with much strength." (Santa Fe de Bogota E? TIEMPO in 
Spanis? 27 March 94 p ?A) 
  Gabriel Borja, spokesman?of the Socialist Renewal Movement, 
CRS, has said the group will test its support by promoting a 
campaign for blank votes in the presidential elections. He has 
said the CRS has ruled out the possibility of supporting any 
presidential candidate, including Navarro Wolff. The spokesman 
of the CRS, which will give up its weapons and demobilize on 9 
April, has said "the campaign for blank votes is a protest 
against bipartisanship, corruption, and the government's 
disastrous handling of the economy." (Hamburg DPA in Spanish 
2015 GMT 2 April 94) 
  A poll by the firm Centro Nacional de Consultoria taken 
between 25 and 27 March in the urban areas of 40 municipalities 
showed "if the 29 May elections were held today, Ernesto Samper 
would obtain 49 percent of the votes and Andres Pastrana, 41 
percent." It also showed that although Navarro Wolff is in third 
place, only four percent would vote for him. (Santa Fe de 
Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 30 March 94 p 8A)

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Colombian guerrilla activities monitored through 4 
April. 
  Two police officers were killed when a two-kg explosive 
device launched against the home of Fabio Ospina Giraldo, former 
secretary of the Administrative Services of the Valle 
Governorship, exploded in southern Cali. This is the second 
time that police officers assigned to protect Ospina have been 
killed. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 30 March 94 p 
8a) 
  The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia's (FARC) 12th 
Front burned 27 new vehicles being transported by car carriers 
on the Barrancabermeja-Puerto Araujo highway. Subversive 
checkpoints have appeared throughout the department. Military 
units in armored vehicles initiated an intense sweep operation 
where daily the guerrillas' actions cause significant losses to 
the transportation sector. (Santa Fe de Bogota Inravision 
Television Cadena 1 in Spanish 1800 GMT 31 March 94) 
  Army troops supported by helicopters attempted yesterday to 
encounter two guerrilla commandos that last Friday attacked two 
military patrols in Boyaca and Cesar, leaving eight dead 
soldiers and 11 wounded. Meanwhile, on 26 March ELN (Army of 
National Liberation) rebels dynamited once more the Cano 
Limon-Covenas oil pipeline at the Km 60 marker in Arauquita 
Municipality. As a result pumping was halted although it was 
resumed yesterday. In Bogota, the XIII Brigade uncovered a 
secret factory of guerrilla uniforms. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL 
TIEMPO in Spanish 27 March 94 p 19a) 
  Pedro Jose Chavarria David, alias "Colacho" or "El Mono," 
third man of the dissolved Popular Liberation Army's (EPL) 
dissident movement, was captured together with two other persons 
in a Medellin neighborhood, official sources reported today. 
The sources said that Chavarria is in charge of the finances of 
the EPL's dissident movement, which is comprised of 150 men who 
operate in the Antioquia, Risaralda, and Caldas departments. 
(Madrid EFE in Spanish 1637 GMT 1 April 94) 
  The Colombian Government today blamed FARC for the murder of 
Prospero Merino, councilman and political leader of the 
Caribbean community in Cienaga, Magdalena Department, in an 
attempt to hamper the 29 May presidential elections. Merino was 
shot in a small town outside Cienaga by five men who also killed 
Luis Sanchez accompanying him while two others were wounded. 
(Hamburg DPA in Spanish 1535 GMT 3 April 94) 
  Army sources disclosed an alleged terrorist plan by the 
guerrilla against several government institutions at the Narino 
Department. Authorities confirmed that at the former Public 
Works Ministry's camp were seized 230 kg of dynamite, 1,250 
meters of slow fuse, as well as maps of institutions to be 
allegedly attacked by the Farc's 29th Front. (Santa Fe de 
Bogota Emisoras Caracol Network in Spanish 1200 GMT 4 April 94) 
  On 30 March, guerrillas set 27 new cars and the trailer in 
which they were being transported on the Pan-American Highway 
near Barrancabermeja. In addition, a bus -- which was carrying 
no passengers -- was also destroyed on the road between 
Bucaramanga and Maicao. It was also reported that during the 
past few hours army troops killed seven FARC and ELN guerrillas 
during clashes in Santander and Putumayo. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL 
TIEMPO in Spanish 2 April 94 pp 1A, 8A) 
  Two presumed FARC guerrillas were killed on 1 April during 
clashes in the rural area of Sampues, Sucre Department. The 
Army confiscated a .38-caliber revolver, a .9-mm pistol, 
ammunition, and subversive propaganda. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL 
TIEMPO in Spanish 3 April 94 p 16A)

  [Text] ...by 11 of 13 votes, thanks notably to the votes of 
eight senators elected in the contested partial legislative 
elections of 18 January 1993 and not acknowledged by the 
international community. Article 149 stipulates that in the 
event of a vacancy in the Presidency of the Republic for any 
reason, the president of the Court of Cassation is invested 
provisionally with the powers of president of the Republic by 
the National Assembly, duly convened by the prime minister. It 
stipulates also that new presidential elections will take place 
within 45 to 90 days after the beginning of the vacancy. 
  In this precise case, the senators pointed out that the 
elections, which will be presidential, legislative, municipal, 
and local, could be held after the 90-day deadline in order to 
respect the constitutional electoral calendar. The 
parliamentarians who passed this resolution intend to send it to 
the Chamber of Deputies on 11 April and to inform the president 
of the Court of Cassation, Emile Jonassaint, of their decision. 
  No senators from the National Front for Change and Democracy 
or the [Constitutionalist] Anticorruption Alliance were seen at 
the 10 April session, where political leaders spoke. The leaders 
of Mobilization for National Development [MDN, headed by Hubert 
de Ronceray], Haitian Party of God [the Reverend Richard 
Vladimir Jeanty], and Democratic National Rally Party [Constant 
D. Pognon] explained the resolution of the Coordinating 
Committee for National Mobilization [CCMN]. 
  After the vote, the MDN leader expressed his satisfaction 
and 
made the following clarification before the microphone of 
Leontes Dorzilme: 
  [Begin De Ronceray recording, in Creole] You must not 
confuse 
the stance of CCMN and that of MDN. The latter takes and always 
has taken a stand in favor of Justice Joseph C. Nerette, whereas 
CCMN has never cited any name. It merely demands the 
implementation of Article 149 with the formation of a 
provisional, ad hoc government. It does not specify any names. 
So, we cannot say CCMN is satisifed or dissatisfied with Justice 
Jonassaint or Justice Nerette. I would like to make this 
distinction: This problem concerns MDN and does not concern 
CCMN. [end recording] 
  It should be recalled that the Chamber of Deputies has 
already approved a plan for the resolution of the crisis. This 
plan is backed by the United States and the United Nations and 
is not yet supported by the opposing bloc of the Senate headed 
by Senator Firmin Jean-Louis, who is acknowledged by the 
international community. 
  For his part, President Jean-Bertrand Aristide has rejected 
this plan, which provides for the installation of a prime 
minister after the early retirement of the head of the Army, 
General Raoul Cedras, but sets no date for his return to Haiti. 
  It must also be said that the resolution passed on 10 April 
states that the new provisional president will have to handle 
the international embargo against Haiti.

<F P=106> [Report by Juan Carlos Santoyo in San Cristobal de las </F>
Casas, Chiapas; from the "ACIR Radio News" newscast] 
  [Excerpt] We have something important to report. We have 
obtained a communique from the Clandestine Indian Revolutionary 
Committee-General Command, Zapatist National Liberation Army 
[EZLN]. As usual, communiques get to us a bit late. This one 
is dated yesterday, 10 April 1994 and reads: 
  To the rank and file which support the EZLN. To the Zapatist 
regular and irregular fighters in all the EZLN corps. 
  Companions. Today, 10 April 1994, marks the 75th anniversary 
of General Emiliano Zapata's murder and the 100th day of our 
just struggle against this bad government. 
  Just as in 1919, the Zapatists must shed blood to pay for 
our 
demands to obtain land and freedom. Just as in 1919 the supreme 
government kills us to make us pay for our rebellion. Just as 
in 1919 the land is not for those who work it. Just as in 1919 
weapons are the only option the government leaves to those of us 
who do not have land. That is why we have taken up arms. That 
is why our companions have been killed during the 100 days of 
our war. That is why we pay homage today to the heroes and 
martyrs of the Zapatist struggle, to the people who always die 
and who will always live with us. 
  It is for this reason we repeat today we will not surrender 
or give up our weapons. There will be no peace until we can 
achieve a just and deserving one. We will not abandon the 
struggle until people throughout Mexico have democracy, freedom, 
justice, independence, decent housing, well-paying jobs, land, 
good nourishment, health, and education. Until such conditions 
are met, our armed measures will continue, and our flag will 
continue to fly in the Mexican mountains. 
  Salutations, Zapatist brothers. Death to the government. 
Viva the EZLN. 
  The communique, as is customary, is signed by Subcommander 
Marcos. 
  We have received this communique from colleagues who were 
allowed to go to the area in the jungle where the EZLN is 
stationed. We note the EZLN is only allowing a few reporters to 
enter the area it controls; access is very limited. Only a few 
media sources are allowed to enter. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 10 Apr (NA) -- President Carlos Menem 
denied tonight the existence of a "protest vote" in the 
elections in the federal capital, and congratulated the Grand 
Front [FG] for its "excellent results" in the district elections. 
  Menem also emphasized the government's nationwide victory 
"for the fourth consecutive year" in as many elections, and 
ruled out the possibility of introducing changes in the national 
cabinet. 
  The president also confirmed "all the terms" of the current 
economic model, and emphasized that the convertibility program's 
"measures will be further enhanced." 
  The president confirmed PAMI [Comprehensive Medical 
Assistance Plan] head Matilde Menendez in her post, because "it 
is not the time to have heads roll" even though he admitted that 
"we will correct some mistakes." 
  Menem said that the PAMI head "has not tendered her 
resignation, nor has anyone asked her to resign," thus denying 
press reports that circulated shortly after the elections. 
  The president also emphasized that the Justicialist Party 
[PJ] defeat in the federal capital "cannot be blamed on anyone 
in particular." 
  Menem said "Argentines no longer vote angrily," and denied 
that the FG victory in the federal capital represents a "protest 
vote" against the government. 
  During a news conference at Government House, Menem said "we 
will strictly abide by" the Olivos Pact that we signed with Raul 
Alfonsin. 
  Discussing the FG victory in the metropolitan district, 
Menem 
said that "the federal capital does not represent the entire 
country," and praised the victories achieved in San Luis and 
Santiago del Estero Provinces, among others. 
  Asked to interpret the election results, Menem said "there 
was a shift in votes." In this regard he made the 
interpretation that "UCR [Radical Civic Union] electoral 
strength has declined" and that "these votes were not cast for 
the PJ" but for the FG, among other forces. 
  Menem specifically made it clear that "even though" some 
provincial forces that won in their respective districts "do not 
support the Olivos Pact, they actually agree with the 
possibility of reforming the Constitution." 
  Asked if after his overwhelming victory in Buenos Aires 
Province, Governor Eduardo Duhalde would be his running mate in 
1995, Menem said: "The governor is free to make any decision. 
If he wants to be my running mate, I would be very pleased, but 
I emphasize that it is much more important to hold a 
governorship like that of Buenos Aires than to hold the post of 
vice president." 
  Menem then reviewed the provinces where the PJ won. 
Nevertheless, he refused to discuss [Republican Force leader] 
General Domingo Bussi's victory against [Tucuman Governor Ramon] 
"Palito" Ortega in Tucuman Province. Menem said that for this 
province the Republican Force and the PJ will have "five 
Constituent Assembly members" each, while the UCR will have one. 
  Asked if the government would conduct a self-examination 
over 
these results, Menem initially responded that it would be 
conducted "within the next few days," but immediately asked 
himself: "Is it possible to conduct a self-examination after a 
victory? We have won throughout the Republic, and there is but 
one country; there are no isolated areas." 
  In this regard, Menem extolled the results achieved in 
Santiago del Estero Province, where Peronism defeated UCR leader 
Jose Zavalia, and in Catamarca Province, where "Dr. Ramon Saadi 
again won after two years of federal intervention." 
  Menem also praised the PJ victory in Salta Province and San 
Luis Province, where "a few months ago, after a great scandal, 
politicians and the media asked for federal intervention of this 
province. We did not implement such an intervention, and won 
with 66 percent of the votes in San Luis Province." 
  Menem then stressed that according to initial projections, 
it 
will not be difficult for Peronism "to have a majority in the 
electoral college" in the Constituent Assembly, as Peronism 
"will be supported by the provincial forces because even though 
these forces do not support the (Olivos) Pact, they support the 
constitutional reform."

  [Text] It is quite likely that the U.S. request for the 
extradition of retired Colonel Faustino Rico Toro will be 
rejected, as has been the case with over 10 requests by the U.S. 
courts for the extradition of Bolivian citizens, due to the lack 
of an extradition agreement between Bolivia and the United 
States. 
  High-ranking judicial branch authorities, who asked not to 
be 
identified, made this comment in recalling that the extradition 
of Asunta Roca Suarez to the United States generated a negative 
reaction from the Bolivian public. 
  After this case the Supreme Court announced that it would 
not 
extradite any more Bolivian citizens to the United States unless 
a treaty in this regard was signed by the two countries. 
  One of the sources said: "The United States would have to 
exert a lot of pressure to obtain Rico Toro's extradition, 
because the Supreme Court was quite clear on the issue." 
  All the U.S. requests for extradition refer to cases of drug 
trafficking and, in that sense, the sources stated that the 21 
April 1900 treaty signed by the two countries does not mention 
that type of crime. 
  Drug trafficking was a crime not known at that time, and 
this 
is the argument of the Bolivian Court to reject the U.S. 
requests for extradition. 
  Although the extradition of Asunta Roca was based on the 
1900 
treaty, and was approved with the Vienna Convention signed in 
1988 (a multilateral accord which includes drug trafficking as a 
crime for which a delinquent may be extradited), the sources 
explained that that document is contradictory.

  [Text] Brasilia -- The future Brazilian president-elect 
already has an official engagement scheduled for 9-10 December: 
to attend the Summit of the Americas in Miami. Responding to 
U.S. President Bill Clinton's invitation, President Itamar 
Franco has stated that he will attend the meeting with his 
successor. In remarks to O ESTADO, President Franco said: "By 
then I will be in the final stage of my tenure and I believe the 
president-elect should go with me." He stated that he would 
invite his successor "whoever he might be." 
  Franco has already set a date for leaving Alvorada Palace: 
30 
September; that is, prior to the first round of the elections. 
He said: "I want to leave the palace at that time to make it 
available for the president-elect to use for meetings during the 
transition period." He noted that in this way the palace could 
be thoroughly cleaned in time for its new resident. 
  Although he still has eight months in office, Franco is 
already dreaming of more peaceful days at Planalto Palace. For 
instance, he mentioned that his youngest daughter, Fabiana, will 
graduate in Economics by the end of this year. He is convinced 
that her graduation ceremony will not be as hectic as that of 
his daughter Georgeana from Law School late last year. Franco 
said: "Everyone will be thinking about the new president and no 
one will be chasing after me." He added: "At the end of your 
term, only the wind knocks on your door." 
  Franco hopes to leave the government with a low inflation 
rate. He believes prices will drop soon. He believes time will 
help overcome the resistance observed in some sectors to the 
FHC2 [Fernando Henrique Cardoso-2] Plan. This would help 
Cardoso -- his presidential candidate -- qualify for the second 
round.

  [Text] Voters' preferences for PT [Workers Party] candidate 
Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva have risen, in one month, from 30 to 
36 percent, while preferences for PSDB [Brazilian Social 
Democracy Party] candidate Fernando Henrique Cardoso rose from 
11 to 20 percent, putting him in second place in the 
presidential race. Both benefited from PPR [Progressive Renewal 
Party] candidate Paulo Maluff's walking out of the race. 
  These results are part of the first nationwide poll by 
Datafolha following the deadline for candidates to resign their 
current government posts (2 April). Preferences for Leonel 
Brizola (PDT) [Democratic Labor Party] and for Orestes Quercia 
(PMDB) [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] stood at 10 and 8 
percent, respectively. FOLHA is for the first time publishing 
charts comparing the performance of parties in the campaigns of 
1989 and 1994. The PT and the PSDB have improved their 
performance in all regions, while Brizola became weaker, 
especially in southern Brazil.

  [Text] Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo reiterated in 
statements this morning that Army chief Humberto Ortega is the 
one who has the weapons and therefore the power even though 
President Violeta Chamorro is commander in chief of the Armed 
Forces. 
  "It is well known that in this country, whoever has the 
weapons has the power. It will be hard for Ortega to leave soon 
because he has the rifles," the chief of the Nicaraguan Catholic 
Church said after meeting with Managua Mayor Arnoldo Aleman. 
  Dr. Emilio Alvarez Montalvan, a prominent political analyst, 
labeled Humberto Ortega's statements as "praetorian" and 
exceeding his military duties. 
  "Ortega's statements are a clear praetorian sign that the 
Sandinist People's Army (EPS) exercises control over the 
civilian government," said Alvarez Montalvan. 
  Alvarez Montalvan said that the EPS meddles in civilian 
society "where it has no right to meddle." 
  "At this stage of the game, Humberto Ortega should be home 
after his 14 long years at the head of the EPS," he said. 
  Various social sectors have requested Ortega's retirement. 
Some Sandinists such as Edmundo Jarquin and Carlos Tunnerman 
Bernheim have said on several occasions that the high-ranking 
military head's retirement "would be healthy." 
  Guillermo Potoy said that Ortega's statements demonstrate 
once more that "military power prevails over civilian power." 
  "Humberto Ortega is another gorilla [derisive term used to 
describe military officers] among those that have existed in 
Latin America and who want to remain in power backed by 
weapons," Potoy commented. 
  According to Potoy, Ortega's continued presence as EPS chief 
would bring more instability to the nation. 
  Meanwhile, Wilfredo Navarro, president of the Independent 
Liberal party, told a local radio that Humberto Ortega's 
statements "reflect the fragility of the state of law that some 
are attempting to establish in Nicaragua."

<F P=106> [Commentary by Larry Astorga] </F>
  [Text] Nicaraguan youth and Sandinist youth: I believe it 
is my responsibility to tell the truth and get to the heart of 
the matter concerning the internal crisis now afflicting the 
JS19J [19 July Sandinist Youth] organization. I hereby state my 
political position. 
  I think we need to try to dot the i's and act without 
subterfuge or ambiguity. It is essential to speak out clearly, 
particularly as the people for whom I have the greatest respect 
are the members of the National Assembly of JS19J and its 
rank-and-file members in general. 
  Brothers and sisters in Sandinist Youth: 
  The decision made by the National Council of Sandinist Youth 
on 19 February was the result of manipulation controlled from 
outside our organization, encouraged by some of the National 
Committee (some were naive, while others were well aware of what 
they were doing, realizing that the rank and file had not been 
consulted, and that only the National Assembly of JS19J can 
elect the organization's national officers. 
  The Sandinist youth leadership, like other sectors of 
Nicaraguan society, has been confronted with some major changes 
in behavior, and has been rejecting everything that it considers 
harmful to the youth sector. We now have leaders whom we support 
for the joint leadership in Sandinist Youth. 
  1. We are not the founding leaders of JS19J, and so we do 
not 
have the same age and experience that others may have had. 
  2. Our organization's financial resources available for 
working with youth are totally inadequate. 
  3. The apathy and scepticism felt by the majority of young 
people concerning political participation is not the 
responsibility of our work, and it greatly affects what we can 
do. 
  4. We have led Sandinist Youth under the banner of the unity 
of Sandinism, and so we have rejected any attachment to specific 
ideological factions or persons. This was part of a decision 
made in the National Committee of JS19J, a decision which I have 
respected with fairness and which I have always defended. 
<H5>  JS Should Not Be a Springboard </H5>
  The decision made on 19 February affects the unity of JS19J 
because I was unwilling to allow Sandinist Youth to be used to 
strengthen specific individuals in the FSLN [Sandinist National 
Liberation Front]. I want to make it clear that I had been 
pressured on various occasions by the departmental secretary of 
Managua, Bladimir Soto, to take a position in relation to one of 
the factions (which I refused to do out of respect for the 
decision of my youth organization). This meant both supporting 
his candidacy for political secretary of District Two in Managua 
and of Henry Petrie for political secretary of Managua. By 
making this clear, I believe that the rest may be readily 
deduced. 
  This situation is seriously detrimental to Sandinist Youth, 
both nationally and internationally. The comrades who set up the 
political ambush in the National Council should consider this 
carefully. I call upon them to reflect and return the situation 
to normal immediately. If not, they could be parties to the 
destruction of JS19J. 
  I will not fail to mention here my amazement about the 
ingenuousness displayed by comrade Roger Grijalva, who is being 
used to defend a divisive concept, behavior, and attitude in 
JS19J. My brother, a man must adopt a single standard of 
judgment. As a thinking being, no one takes away your right to 
speak out and to act with honesty. Even in the National 
Committee we decided that everyone of us has the full right to 
choose one faction or another, but not to use Sandinist Youth as 
a springboard to strengthen individuals. On the contrary, our 
mission is to work to strengthen the party as a whole. 
  Sandinist young people: it is up to you to decide; you have 
the truth and the power in your hands. Let us strive for 
Sandinist unity.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities monitored through 7 April. 
  Brazilian and Chilean Foreign Ministers Celso Amorim and 
Carlos Figueroa signed the "Agreement on Promotion and 
Reciprocal Protection of Investments" at the end of the Rio 
Group meeting held in Rio de Janeiro on 22 March. The agreement 
seeks to create favorable conditions for intensifying bilateral 
economic cooperation, and especially for granting fair and equal 
treatment to investors in the respective countries. (Santiago 
ESTRATEGIA in Spanish 23 Mar 94 p 7) 
  The Chilean trade balance registered a $101.3 million 
surplus 
in February, with exports at $737.2 million and imports at 
$635.9 million. The cumulative surplus for the year's first two 
months was $68.6 million, compared with the same period in 1993 
when there was a deficit of $220.7 million. (Santiago 
ESTRATEGIA in Spanish 24 Mar 94 p 4) 
  The Central Bank reported that the GDP increased 6 percent 
in 
1993, and that the sectors that contributed most to the economic 
growth were construction, with 14 percent; commerce, 
restaurants, and hotels, 8.7 percent; transport and 
communication, 7.9 percent; and financial services, 7.1 percent. 
(Santiago EL MERCURIO in Spanish 24 Mar 94 pp A1, A12) 
  The Consumer Price Index stood at 1.1 percent in March. 
Accrued inflation so far this year stands at 2.5 percent. The 
hike in public utility rates, coupled with an increase in school 
fees, caused the inflation rate to exceed the estimates for the 
first quarter of the year. (Santiago Television Nacional de 
Chile Imagen Internacional in Spanish 0100 GMT 7 Apr 94)

  [Text] President Juan Carlos Wasmosy's government 
categorically rejects diplomatic relations with Cuba. Our doors 
will, therefore, remain closed to any initiative in that 
direction. 
  Foreign Minister Luis Maria Ramirez Boettner said this 
morning that our country will not change its position over that 
Caribbean island despite Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto 
Robaina's visit to our country on 15 and 16 April. 
  Following a meeting with the president at government palace, 
Ramirez Boettner said Paraguay is only interested in commercial 
contacts within the framework of Mercosur [Common Market of the 
South]. 
  "Our position continues unchanged. Paraguay has not changed 
its position over Cuba. We will receive him to talk about 
Mercosur and trade matters," said Ramirez Boettner. The foreign 
minister added that Robaina and his entourage will make an 
unofficial visit to the country because we do not have 
diplomatic relations with the island. Ramirez Boettner added 
that Paraguay is very interested in talking about Mercosur, 
particularly because Robaina will be arriving here after 
visiting the other three Mercosur member countries. 
  Ramirez Boettner said he will depart for Marrakech, Morocco, 
tomorrow and will not be in the country during Robaina's visit. 
Robaina will be received by Deputy Foreign Minister Oscar 
Cabello Sarubbi. The foreign minister said Wasmosy will not 
receive the Cuban foreign minister either. "I do not think he 
(Wasmosy) will receive him because his visit is unofficial," the 
foreign minister noted. Robaina wants to talk about Mercosur so 
perhaps he will also meet with Industry and Commerce Minister 
Ubaldo Scavone. 
  An interesting detail is that no government official is 
scheduled to meet Robaina at the airport.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 10 Apr (AFP) -- Colombian 
Justice Minister Andres Gonzalez admitted on Sunday that the 
sentences given to those who surrender to justice should be 
tougher, but he denied U.S. allegations that Colombia is a 
"narcodemocracy." 
  In an interview with Caracol Radio Network, Gonzalez denied 
assertions that the current Colombian legal system is a 
"narcocode." Just as the Attorney General's Office, the 
Prosecutor General's Office, and the Supreme Court have been 
saying, the minister admitted that the code requires immediate 
changes, especially regarding sentences given to drug 
traffickers. 
  Gonzalez insisted that despite the success of the policy to 
get drug traffickers to surrender, the law can still be 
improved. He said the code, contrary to what some groups are 
saying, does not grant automatic benefits to drug cartels and 
establishes discretionary mechanisms that allow authorities to 
impose strict sentences. 
  The minister said that the recent differences regarding 
sentences given to certain criminals arose because of problems 
in the way the sentences were applied and the interpretation of 
norms. The minister, however, refrained from identifying the 
reasons for the problems. He also described as unacceptable 
statements made by U.S. Senator John Kerry that Colombia is a 
"narcodemocracy" and said that "Colombia is a democracy that 
grows stronger each year, a democracy that has made huge 
sacrifices to fight organized crime, terrorism, and drugs."

  [Text] The executive branch yesterday issued regulations on 
overtime in the public administration and limited the purchase 
of vehicles by ministerial departments. The government also 
raised the level of extra budgetary resources that can be used 
to pay for budget items from 20 percent to 30 percent. 
  This mini-economic package is the fourth approved by Economy 
and Finance Minister Ignacio de Posadas' administration to 
contain public spending. The previous packages were approved in 
February 1992 and March and June 1993. 
  The first decree released yesterday establishes that 
overtime 
is work completed in addition to the normal workday, in either a 
six-hour or an eight-hour workday regime, according to the case. 
A normal work week cannot exceed 30 or 40 hours. 
  The overtime period cannot exceed one and a half or two 
hours 
per day, or 26 to 40 hours per month, for the six-hour day or 
the eight-hour day, respectively. Exceptional work periods can 
be authorized when there is a lack of personnel to do the job. 
  Overtime on public holidays may not exceed four hours per 
day. Overtime financed by third parties may not exceed 80 hours 
per month per employee. 
  Overtime will be paid at 50 percent over the normal hourly 
rate. Permanent overtime will not be authorized in any case. 
  As of 1 January 1994, the public administration will reduce 
its overtime by 25 percent compared to the previous year. 
  The second decree that was approved yesterday suspends the 
purchase of vehicles by state offices until 31 December 1994. 
  Funds used to purchase new vehicles must come exclusively 
from the sale of used units. Vehicles will be replaced starting 
with those purchased before 1 January 1986 and those that are 
unusable. 
  The decree establishes the obligation to sell vehicles older 
than 1986 by 31 December 1994. Unusable vehicles, up to 25 
percent of the total fleet, will also be sold by that date, 
except for vehicles belonging to the Interior and Public Health 
Ministries.

  [Excerpts] One of the two antagonistic blocs in the Senate 
of the Republic, presided over by Senator Bernard Sansaricq, 
voted on 10 April to implement Article 149, which provides for 
the nomination of a provisional president and the holding of new 
elections within 90 days. Rothschild Francois filed a report: 
  [Begin Francois recording] By deciding on 10 April to vote 
for implementation of Article 149 of the Constitution, the 
branch of the Senate led by Sen. Sansaricq intends to implement 
the closing of the Aristide file and a new beginning; endowing 
the country with a provisional president chosen from the Court 
of Cassation; the ratification of a new government; the holding 
of elections; and the assumption of office by an elected 
president on 7 February 1995. 
  Long before he became involved in voting for this resolution 
during the session attended by some political leaders, the 
president of this Senate office, which is not recognized by the 
lower chamber, pointed out that he did not expect the sanctions 
to be lifted this way. Sen. Sansaricq asserts, however, that it 
is necessary for the country to be led by a conscious, 
responsible team that could manage the embargo. His colleagues 
also recommended a serious government capable of assuring the 
management of the heavy burden of Haiti's economic sanctions. 
  This session on 10 April in the Senate brought together 
eight 
senators elected on 18 January and five from the normal office. 
Four hours of discussion were necessary for the legislators to 
reach a vote on this resolution leading to Article 149 of the 
Haitian Constitution. Osny Eugene, elected on 18 January, is the 
author of this document. In the 10 April resolution, senators 
from the Alliance and from 18 January equate the refusal of 
President Aristide to choose a prime minister with his 
resignation. 
  These senators also decided to revoke the June 1993 decree 
that restored President Aristide to his functions and to declare 
and acknowledge the presidential vacuum. For them, Article 149 
was unavoidable. [passage omitted] It should be recalled that 
the Chamber of Deputies does not recognize this office of the 
Senate of the Republic. [end recording]

  [Text] The leader of the Mobilization for National 
Development, Professor Hubert de Ronceray, attended the session 
in the Senate and called the initiative of the second Senate 
office a step in the right direction while political leader 
Montalvo Despeignes wonders about the applicability of such a 
resolution: 
  [Begin recording] [De Ronceray] "I believe a major step has 
been taken, a very important step. Now other steps must be 
taken. For instance, the Chamber of Deputies must also act. I 
think that the effort that has just been accomplished here is a 
major one, and I believe that the whole country, following this 
action, must appreciate it very much. We are almost sure that in 
the Chamber of Deputies there are some men, some representatives 
who are more or less responsible, who understand the seriousness 
of the situation. We therefore hope that good news will also 
come out of the House of Deputies... If they reject it, they 
will again create some serious problems in the country, and I 
believe the population will finally speak its piece. 
  [Reporter Francois] "Will you be willing to accept the post 
of prime minister if they call on you? 
  [De Ronceray] "If they call on me, I will consult with the 
party and if the party agrees, then I have no problem." 
  [Francois] Mr. Despeignes, your comments. 
  [Despeignes] When it comes to the Constitution, there is 
nothing one can do, but I question the implementation and 
applicability of what has just been done because the parliament 
is not the only actor in this play. 
  [Francois] The Senate is not the only actor.... 
  [Despeignes] The Senate, the parliament -- it is still the 
same entity -- let us say they are not the only actors despite 
the principle of sovereignty in this crisis. 
  [Francois] Do you mean the Army? 
  [Despeignes] There is the Army on one side, there is the 
international community, and there are the political forces. 
Perhaps it will be necessary at an appropriate time to reinforce 
this Article 149 with the vast possibilities offered by Article 
111. Because in any case, this is already an ad hoc government. 
It will therefore be necessary to broaden the operational field 
of this ad hoc government in order to institutionalize the 
state, the society, and to organize the nation. [end recording]

  [Excerpt] Any viable solution to the Haitian crisis must 
facilitate the lifting of the embargo, according to statements 
by [Senator] Julio Larosiliere, who labels the actions of the 
second office of the Senate of the Republic a bluff. The true 
solution is the one that will answer the desiderata of the 
Haitian people, says Sen. Larosiliere. 
  [Begin Larosiliere recording, in Creole] In my opinion, this 
is a bluff because any solution that does not take into account 
the entire Haitian people and the lifting of the embargo will 
fail, is not good. I have the impression that those who want it 
have something up their sleeve. Many of those who want it would 
like to see a government established even though they know it 
will not be ruling for longer than two months. Meanwhile, they 
will have time to dissolve the parliament, raise the money 
ceiling, put money into circulation. It will also allow them to 
put some money in their pockets. As exile does not harm them, 
this is not a problem for them, even if they find a way to 
remain in Haiti. But at least they will have time to make some 
money. [end recording] 
  In addition, the quaestor of the legitimate [Senate] office 
has asked the 18 January senators to refrain from participating 
in the sessions, as provided for by the New York pact. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] Evans Paul, mayor of Port-au-Prince and National 
Front for Change and Democracy spokesman, criticizes the authors 
of the resolution for enforcement of Article 149 of the 
Constitution. It is the coup d'etat logic that continues, 
Port-au-Prince Mayor Evans Paul told the Haitian Press Agency 
regarding the 10 April vote by the Senate [office] led by 
Bernard Sansaricq for a resolution relating to the reenforcement 
of the Constitution. It is a masquerade without legal 
foundation, by individuals with no electoral legitimacy, who do 
not respect any logic, he adds, explaining that their objective 
is to work for the ruin of the people and to guarantee 
themselves continued illicit wealth. 
  Paul further stated that the international community will 
not 
back this undertaking, which is already doomed to failure and 
which will most likely result in reinforcement of the sanctions. 
  After accusing the authors of the resolution and their 
allies 
of responsibility for the misfortunes of the country, Mr. Paul 
noted that no one has acknowledged Sansaricq as president of the 
Senate. Neither have the parliamentarians stemming from the 
contested 18 January [1993] elections, whose fate depends on the 
verdict of the arbitration committee provided for by the Haitian 
Constitution, been acknowledged as senators.

<F P=106> [Report by Miguel Perez and Jesusa Cervantes] </F>
  [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas -- Subcommander Marcos 
has said the second stage of negotiations between the Zapatist 
National Liberation Army [EZLN] and Peace Commissioner Manuel 
Camacho Solis, which was supposed to begin here yesterday, was 
postponed following Luis Donaldo Colosio's assassination. 
  The EZLN leader did not give a date for restarting the 
dialogue, nor has the government. Sources that asked not to be 
identified have said Peace Commissioner Camacho Solis will 
arrive in San Cristobal de las Casas on 5 April. The source 
added part of the team and Camacho Solis could arrive on the 
first commercial flight to Tuxtla Gutierrez on 5 April. 
  The commissioner suspended his message on restarting talks 
he 
was to give the media on 23 March, because Colosio was 
assassinated that day. No one knows the content of Camacho 
Solis' new message, because the one he was to deliver two weeks 
ago concerned restarting negotiations with the self-styled EZLN. 
According to reports from Marcos, the second stage of talks 
should have begun yesterday in what has become known as the 
Peace Cathedral here in San Cristobal de las Casas. 
  The announcement the peace commissioner will make will also 
be influenced by the decision of the Clandestine Indian 
Revolutionary Committee-General Command to suspend consultations 
with the EZLN over an alleged withdrawal of Mexican Army troops 
from their territories. 
  Up to yesterday there was no communique from Marcos to 
report 
the resumption of talks between the armed group on Camacho 
Solis' proposals. 
  Mexican Army troops enjoyed a fourth day off thanks to a 
decision by the 31st Military Zone based in Tuxtla Gutierrez 
granting rest and relaxation to soldiers who had spent the most 
time in the front.

<F P=106> [From the "Radio ACIR Newscast"] </F>
  [Text] The most recent information supplied by the 
authorities tasked with investigating the murder of Luis Donaldo 
Colosio indicates that the authorities have so far arrested six 
people who are presumably involved.... [pauses] accused of 
co-participating or co-masterminding the assassination of 
Colosio. 
  The last person to be arrested was Salvador Hernandez 
Tomasini. He was identified as one of the individuals who 
collaborated with the plot to assassinate Colosio. Sources at 
the Attorney General's Office reported that Hernandez, according 
to the Assistant Attorney General's Office in charge of the 
case, was the person in dark glasses who was advancing on the 
candidate's left flank, called his attention, and knelt on three 
occasions; the last time when the Institutional Revolutionary 
Party [PRI] candidate was hit by gun shots. 
  The arrest of another person who is assuredly involved in 
the 
plot is pending. He is the person who threw himself at the feet 
of the candidate forcing him to stop and look down. At that 
moment, Colosio was shot by someone holding a revolver, 
apparently Mario Aburto Martinez, the confessed assassin and 
presumed murderer of the PRI presidential candidate. 
  It is still said in Tijuana that it is shameful and grave 
that the PRI recruited those involved in Colosio's assassination 
to work as security guards. In other words, the party recruited 
the hired assassins. Jesus Ruiz Barraza, former PRI leader 
during 1986-89 in the State of Baja California, made this 
observation. 
  Remember that elections were held in Baja California in July 
1989 and that the PRI lost the governorship, which was won by 
Ernesto Ruffo Appel of the National Action Party [PAN]. 
Henceforth, the PRI in Baja California started to dismember, to 
disintegrate. There is resentment, profound resentment. 
  Thus -- and this is speculation, a theory that we were 
noting 
yesterday and that continues to gain force -- it appears that 
the masterminds of this crime are PRI groups that resented Luis 
Donaldo Colosio, because as national PRI president, he 
recognized the PAN victory, that is, the victory of Ernesto 
Ruffo Appel. PRI candidate Margarita Ortega de Villa lost that 
election. 
  This is very serious, this former PRI leader in Baja 
California said. It shows a lack of responsibility and 
knowledge, but this was predictable a long time ago, because 
these people were attacking the party ever since I was a leader, 
Barraza pointed out. He added that they are the people with 
whom I had frictions and disputes, because I did not want the 
scourge of society to be part of the PRI. This is a very 
serious and delicate issue. Barraza was interviewed at the 
international airport in Tijuana. 
  Lazaro Cardenas, also a former political leader in Baja 
California, said that the result of a disorganized party and 
Political Council, in which each one of its 300 members have 
gone their own way, is negligence in contracting those who 
should have protected Colosio. This was undoubtedly an 
important factor that affected his assassination. 
  The people involved in the assassination of Luis Donaldo 
Colosio, according to the authorities -- and based on available 
videotapes -- were identified as members of a group called 
TUCAN. TUCAN, we reported yesterday and the newspapers noted 
today, is an acronym whose expansion is: All United Against 
National Action [Todos Unidos Contra Accion Nacional]. In other 
words, this is a group struggling to recover the governorship, 
power in Baja California. In this case, they resorted to 
violence to protest against what Luis Donaldo Colosio had done, 
at least that is what the evidence shows for the time being. 
  Thus, we are getting closer to what might be the truth. This 
is why Ernesto Zedillo, who leads this effort, and leaders of 
the industrial, commercial, and other sectors, and of the 
political party demand that this investigation be completed at 
all cost.

<F P=106> [Report by Roberto Gonzalez Amador] </F>
  [Text] The political atmosphere and a significant increase 
in the U.S. interest rate in the last six days of financial 
activities led to the transfer of $3 billion of Mexican deposits 
to foreign markets. According to the Mexican Association of 
Currency Exchange Agents (AMCC) [Asociacion Mexicana de Casas de 
Cambio], as of Tuesday, however, "the tendency has decreased." 
  The AMCC, which comprises 39 currency exchange corporations 
nationwide, indicated that the Mexican currency floated close to 
the upper limits established by the eighth session of the 
Stability, Competitiveness, and Employment Pact (PECE). The 
association added that the Bank of Mexico poured about $3 
billion of its international reserves into the exchange market 
during the six days following the death of Luis Donaldo Colosio. 
This was to respond to the demand for U.S. currency and prevent 
a sharp depreciation of the new peso. 
  The Central Bank did not confirm its participation in the 
exchange market activities. Nevertheless, the $3 billion that 
it reportedly contributed to defending the new peso represented 
11 percent of the total amount of international currency 
reserves the country held in December. 
  "There is no doubt," according to the AMCC, that the Bank of 
Mexico did in fact intervene in the exchange market to meet the 
demand for U.S. dollars. Analysts accredit the demand to spring 
vacations, the increase in U.S. interest rates, a general 
downward trend in leading stocks, and the air of uncertainty in 
Mexico generated by events in noneconomic sectors. 
  The AMCC said that as of 25 March, the Central Bank has sold 
treasury bonds worth $2 billion. This helped prevent, "to a 
certain extent," a sudden fall in Mexico's currency. By 
covering the currency exchange demand, said the AMCC, the local 
monetary authorities strengthened the new peso. The $6 billion 
lifeline offered by the U.S. Treasury also contributed to the 
stabilization efforts. 
  The exchange market was quiet again, yesterday, as no major 
operations were recorded. The new peso did remain near the 
upper flotation limits, though. If it should surpass this 
ceiling, the Bank of Mexico will intervene immediately to 
stabilize the exchange rate. The AMCC reported that there was 
very little activity in the 48-hour dollar market yesterday, 
with no large deposits or withdrawals registered. There was 
some demand for the new peso in the currency exchange markets 
yesterday, where it closed at a 3.35-new-pesos purchase value 
and 3.36-new-pesos turnover to the dollar. The group believes 
that the exchange markets will stabilize again sometime between 
now and Friday, and the daily decline rate will return to the 
usual 0.0004 new pesos, as established by the PECE. 
  AMCC reports indicate that the sale of dollars on Tuesday 
was 
lower than the previous days. They do point out, however, that 
it is not recommended forecasting any type of activity regarding 
the transfer of currency abroad. The association said that the 
$3 billion that left the country did so almost "all at the same 
time," within the few days following the murder of the PRI 
[Institutional Revolutionary Party] presidential candidate. 
"The highest amounts were transferred abroad on 25 March," and 
since that date "the trend has been downward." 
  The exchange agents said that the amount of dollars leaving 
the country has not been sufficient to jeopardize the Bank of 
Mexico international currency reserves, which total a 
considerable amount -- a little more than $29 billion. They 
also pointed out that they are sure there will be no sudden 
devaluation. 
  One factor that promoted the transfers is the recent 
increase 
in U.S. interest rate. Once the 30-year treasury bond reached 
7.44 percent, however, it was believed that yields had reached 
their ceiling. Therefore, stability is expected to return the 
financial markets in the coming days.

  [Text] Mr. Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, the presidential 
candidate for the PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party], said 
before autonomous PRI peasant organizations that he is committed 
to eliminating bureaucratic pitfalls that have hindered the 
development of Mexican agriculture. 
  [Begin Zedillo recording] We also have to work for the 
productive recovery of the countryside; this is very urgent. 
For many years, Mexico's farmlands have been either at a 
standstill or have been growing at a very gradual rate. [end 
recording] 
  The PRI candidate promised to break the vicious circle that 
has kept 18 million of the nation's 23 million peasants in 
poverty. To do this, he promised a very vigorous social policy. 
  [Begin Zedillo recording] My pledge is to eliminate all of 
those obstacles that have limited agriculture's productive 
potential. We must specifically attack the severe bureaucratic 
problem that still afflicts Mexican farming. If there is a 
single victim of centralism in Mexico, it is the Mexican 
peasant. [end recording] 
  Peasant leaders who spoke with the PRI candidate were 
Alfonso 
Garzon Santibanez from the Independent Peasants Central 
Organization, Aquiles Cordoba from the Peasant Torch [Antorcha 
Campesina], Humberto Serrano from the Mexican Agrarian Council, 
Hugo Andres Arauco of the National Peasant Confederation, Jose 
Luis Gonzalez of the General Union of Workers and Peasants of 
the Mexican State, and Guadalupe Martinez Cruz of the National 
Council of Tenant Farmer and Peasant Associations [Consejo 
Nacional de Sociedades y Uniones Campesinas de Colonos]. All of 
them voiced support for the PRI presidential candidate.

  [Text] The 31 governors and cabinet members met with 
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari in Los Pinos today. The 
Presidency Press Office said that the purpose of the meeting was 
to analyze and evaluate priority projects to be implemented this 
year. 
  Unusual movement has been noticed in Los Pinos since 1800. 
Governors arrived practically at the same time, which caused a 
traffic congestion. Some of the secretaries of state had to 
walk to the entrance of the Presidency. 
  The Presidency Press Office did not say if the meeting was 
included on the president's agenda. A bulletin was issued 
later, in which some of the topics discussed were mentioned. 
According to the Media Directorate, Government Secretary Jorge 
Carpizo talked about the electoral reforms for the 21 August 
elections; the finance secretary presented a report on the 
country's current economic situation; the secretary of commerce 
mentioned a price reduction on some staple products; Secretary 
of Social Development Carlos Rojas discussed social matters; 
Secretary of Agriculture and Hydraulic Resources Carlos Hank 
Gonzalez reported on checks delivered to peasants; and Secretary 
of Labor Arsenio Farell mentioned aspects of a training program 
he is currently implementing. 
  Governors left the Los Pinos official residence at 2100, 
while the secretaries of state stayed behind. None made any 
statements to the media.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Daniel Dultzin Dubin, director </F>
general of the multilateral negotiations in the Mexican Foreign 
Relations Secretariat, by Jesus Aranda; place and date not given 
-- all quotation marks as published] 
  [Text] Daniel Dultzin Dubin, director general of 
multilateral negotiations in the Foreign Relations Secretariat, 
has said that in the wake of Mexico's entry into the OECD, the 
country will now have to make adjustments in several fundamental 
economic areas. 
  According to Dultzin, included among the areas in which 
Mexico is willing to make midterm and long-term adjustments is 
maritime transportation. He also noted that, in general, all 
environmental agreements are being carried out. 
  Modifications will have to be made in 38 economic areas, 
including capital goods, services, environment, foreign 
investments, multinational corporations, consumer protection 
programs, agriculture, nuclear energy, and tourism. Other areas 
that will need to undergo adjustment include financial markets, 
fiscal issues, trade, employment and social issues, insurance, 
scientific and technological policies, computer technology, data 
processing and communications policies, development assistance, 
and others. 
  Dultzin also mentioned areas such as education, in addition 
to specific naval construction and steel agreements. 
  Although adopted agreements affect all of these areas, the 
energy sector will not be affected because "we decided not to 
participate in this area, and also, we did not participate in 
developmental assistance or in independent agreements on 
exports." 
  Other agreements are aimed at creating a more prosperous, 
stable Mexican economy that will raise the people's standard of 
living and increase employment, and all of these agreements "are 
designed to improve the Mexican economy." 
  Daniel Dultzin explained that the adjustments really have 
nothing to do with trade: "There is a Trade Committee that 
thoroughly reviews international trade policies. If the OECD's 
mission is to safeguard a multilateral trade system, they can 
rely on the Uruguay Round of the GATT negotiations. This, 
however, has nothing to do with the required adjustments on 
issues such as trade deregulation or the granting of preferences. 
  "We are not about to lose our status as a developing 
country; 
our admittance into the OECD does not connote this. This is 
something completely different; we are not going to lose this 
status." 
  The SRE [Foreign Relations Secretariat] official explained: 
"We have lost our concessional credits [creditos concesionales] 
because our per capita income has surpassed the fixed $2,300 
amount, and also because of the overall income level. In terms 
of increases in our level of income, we will be losing some of 
the advantages that come with being a poor country, or one in 
development." At any rate, this will not take place just 
because we are an OECD member. 
  On the contrary, the Basel Agreements between all of the 
central banks imply government credits are rated as zero risk 
for all OECD members. They fell from 100 to zero, but for the 
commercial banks they will fall to 20. In other words, it is 
expected that there will be an impact on the cost of what is 
paid in premium for the credits Mexico acquires. 
  [Aranda] What can we expect from our admittance to the OECD? 
  [Dultzin] What we can expect is, first of all, to be 
completely involved in all discussions of the more than 200 
working groups and committees. Mexican officials will be 
receiveing training in every area of government. The OECD 
covers all areas of government except security, sports, and 
culture. 
  In addition there will be "improved training and increased 
coordination of programs in the interior, and, therefore, we 
will be better informed, which in turn will allow us to better 
apply new policies." 
  "We are gradually committing ourselves to offer 
nondiscriminatory, fair treatment as long as economic conditions 
in Mexico and the legal structure allow this. However, we also 
expect to guarantee these liberties to all Mexicans living in 
other countries. It is vital that the Mexican economy is 
capable of globalizing. Of course, all of this depends on what 
we might do." 
  [Aranda] Up until 31 December, there was a certain 
perception 
of Mexico abroad. Considering Colosio's murder, what support 
can the OECD provide Mexico? 
  [Dultzin] All of the governments are well aware of the 
problems we have had. They have decided not to modify the 
discussions or the manner in which these are being carried out. 
Our internal problems are our problems, and it is up to us to 
resolve them. They have accepted us as a mature [maduro] 
country confronting problems related to growing up. Maybe it is 
a transition in our development process. We are being accepted 
as a mature country by other mature countries. 
  "It will be up to us to resolve our problems as best we can. 
However, the other nations are there, not so much to tell us 
what to do, but to offer support and guidance, as well as to 
help as much as possible because many of them have similar 
problems." 
  [Aranda] The member-states have a democratic culture. Was 
there any problem when you adopted the decision concerning 
Mexico's admission? 
  [Dultzin] There are principles; these include a basic 
philosophy, market economies, and economies that date back 
hundreds of years. The relationship between states and markets 
is very old. Democracy and respect for human rights are very old 
principles and, obviously, they are essential to those countries 
and to us, too. Within the OECD, there are various cases in 
which various countries have faced very difficult political 
situations. 
  "Mexico's pledge basically deals with human rights, 
democracy, and a market economy that improves the people's 
overall lifestyle and will become increasingly prosperous. 
These are the principles we share. They do not touch on 
political issues; they deal with other topics -- in depth and 
vigorously. 
  Daniel Dultzin Dublin said Mexico's pledge is to strive for 
a 
better trained work force; a better adaptation of the labor 
market to the need for more industrial services, greater 
competitiveness, and productivity; and to include the working 
class in the overall marketplace with a better lifestyle and 
training. 
  [Aranda] The country faces uncertain times. What does the 
admission to the OECD represent? 
  [Dultzin] Admission was scheduled for 24 March; the date was 
established so the OECD Council could adopt a decision. It 
adopted the decision despite all of the events that have 
recently occurred in Mexico. The council was fully aware that 
its decision was coming within a new context, but it 
nevertheless adopted the decision as scheduled. The 
confirmation and acceptance were planned for 14 April. 
  "It is an element of all of these countries' great 
confidence 
in Mexico, in its institutions, in the maturity of its society, 
and in Mexican society's ability to face these problems and 
overcome them. This can result in specific and mutual benefits, 
and the OECD countries will be more aware of the problems that 
afflict developing nations such as ours." 
  The director general of multilateral negotiations in the SRE 
says OECD countries know what conditions prevail in Mexico: 
"They know perfectly well how revenues are distributed and that 
we are 5 percent above the median for the population with the 
highest income -- a level in which Mexico is above the median 
for industrialized countries. Some 20 percent of the low-income 
population is way below the median for industrialized countries. 
The general trend is for greater overall productivity and a 
better distribution of wages." 
  Moveover, "very specialized work is being carried out on 
regional development and rural development, which will give us 
the experience to attack the poverty problem." 
  [Aranda] What topics interest Mexico the most as an OECD 
member? 
  [Dultzin] There is one critical issue. In order to ensure 
that economic development will be sustainable in the long run in 
Mexico, higher growth levels must be compatible with reduced 
inflation, price stability, and a sustainable external deficit. 
  "Also, everything dealing with the development of small and 
medium-sized enterprises, their problems, and international 
production tasks." [sentence as published] In addition, Mexico 
is interested in "doing everything possible to incorporate an 
underground economy, and this must be increasingly strengthened 
through production chains, large companies, and large 
distribution chains or their international counterparts, because 
this will help us a great deal." 
  The official emphasizes it is essential for Mexico to have 
much more access to international markets. "If this does not 
happen, we will be inhibited in our development; we will not be 
able to develop the Mexican economy's potential, which could be 
around 5, 6, or 7 percent, and we will not be able to achieve an 
in-depth solution to the problem of increasing our participation 
in international markets with Mexican assets, services, and 
experience. Mexican products are competitive, and they have a 
market. 
  "It is an enormous challenge, but there are many topics 
within the OECD that can help promote Mexico." 
  [Aranda] What other topics are important for Mexico? 
  [Dultzin] The basic problems that afflict large cities -- 
pollution, development, and urban planning -- as well as similar 
problems dealing with regional development, more successful 
agricultural policies, and assistance for the peasants. We can 
find many areas in which we can improve our economy. 
  [Arenda] We have joined the APEC [Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation] organization, NAFTA, and the OECD. What next? 
  [Dultzin] Our admission does not guarantee we will fare 
better. Mexico has maturity, knowledge, and experience that are 
of interest to industrialized countries, as well as to East 
European countries, where Mexico's experience may be of great 
interest -- both our achievements and our backwardness, and what 
we do with them -- and we can benefit from this. Mexico has 
made a name for itself in the world community because it has 
something to say, and it is capable of absorbing the experience 
of others for its own benefit.

<F P=106> [Report by Jorge Araya] </F>
  [Text] San Jose, 7 Apr (AFP) -- According to several 
government officials, following the signing of a free trade 
agreement with Mexico in Mexico City on Tuesday, 5 April, Costa 
Rica's priority is to become part of NAFTA before the rest of 
Central America. 
  Officials in both governments said that after three years of 
negotiations, Mexico and Costa Rica signed the "most advanced" 
commercial treaty in Latin America. The treaty will go into 
effect on 1 January, after it is ratified by both legislatures. 
  Costa Rican President-elect Jose Maria Figueres, a social 
democrat who will assume office on 8 May, noted that trade 
negotiations will be a priority for his administration in an 
effort to put his country on the political map of nations 
advancing toward regional integration. 
  The future president stressed the need to train experienced 
negotiators so they can make the best of the difficult trade 
negotiations ahead, particularly with a view to joining NAFTA, 
formed by Mexico, the United States, and Canada on 1 January. 
  Foreign Trade Minister Roberto Rojas, who has been 
responsible for trade negotiations so far, said that the 
agreement with Mexico puts Costa Rica in a "privileged" position 
for its integration into NAFTA. 
  "We would have liked to have signed a similar agreement with 
the rest of Central America, but that has been more difficult," 
the minister told a group of reporters. He added that before 
such an agreement can be signed, "the right internal, economic, 
and institutional conditions must exist, and Costa Rica found 
them" in the negotiations with Mexico. 
  According to Rojas, it would take approximately 10 years to 
join NAFTA if the negotiations were carried out in concert with 
the other Central American nations, and he predicted that it 
will take two years for Costa Rica to sign a free trade 
agreement with the rest of Central America. 
  The treaty with Mexico gives Costa Rica access to a market 
30 
times larger than the Costa Rican market. Business associations 
and government officials expect a significant boost in foreign 
investment and commercial trade, which currently represents a 
deficit for Costa Rica. 
  In 1993, Costa Rica exported approximately $60 million and 
imported $150 million, mostly in oil purchases, from Mexico. 
  Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani said on Wednesday 
that 
it was "excellent" that Costa Rica had signed the agreement 
because it can serve as an example for the other countries in 
the region, which are currently in preliminary negotiations with 
Mexico. 
  Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua form the 
Central America 4 (CA-4) group, which must set a date in the 
next few weeks for the next summit of heads of state to discuss 
the continuation of trade talks with Mexico. 
  These countries agreed on the joint negotiation of a free 
trade agreement with Mexico. Efforts in this direction have 
also been made in Nicaragua, where authorities have expressed 
their desire to sign the agreement this year. 
  The subject was included on President Violeta Chamorro's 
agenda during her official visit to Mexico, which concluded on 
Wednesday. Nicaragua maintains modest trade with Mexico and owes 
that nation nearly $1 billion, half of which is for oil imports.

  [Text] San Jose, 6 Apr (ACAN-EFE) -- While Costa Rican 
businessmen and government considered the signing of the Free 
Trade Agreement (TLC) with Mexico a landmark in Costa Rican 
history, union leaders expressed great reservations about this 
economic opening and the consequences it will have for the 
country. 
  The signing of the TLC by Presidents Rafael Angel Calderon 
(Costa Rica) and Carlos Salinas de Gortari (Mexico) in Mexico 
City yesterday, Tuesday, was given wide coverage by the Costa 
Rican media. A television station even broadcast the event live. 
  Costa Rican businessmen and government officials estimate 
that with the TLC, which has to be ratified by the parliaments 
in both countries, exports to Mexico should go from $60 million 
to $250 million in the next five years. This would make Mexico 
Costa Rica's fourth commercial partner, after the United States, 
the European Union, and Central America. 
  In its editorial today, LA NACION newspaper pointed out that 
the signing of the TLC, considered to be one of the most 
advanced of the ones signed in Latin America, "gives a greater 
momentum to a new era of commercial opening," whose commercial 
benefits "are as great as the challenges it poses." After 
highlighting the benefits the TLC can bring to the country, 
offering a market of more than 85 million people to the Costa 
Rican producers, the newspaper warned, however, that "one cannot 
rest on one's laurels because the challenges imposed by this new 
reality are many." "More than ever before, it is necessary to 
expand the economic modernization program," the newspaper 
appraised. LA NACION published a big photograph of Calderon and 
Salinas signing the agreement in its front page, two pages with 
information related to the TLC, and one with the Costa Rican 
president's speech. 
  The LA REPUBLICA newspaper, for its part, gave less coverage 
to this story and published a small photo of Calderon and 
Salinas de Gortari in its first page and highlighted that the 
signing of the TLC opens a ""new era in the relations between 
Costa Rica and Mexico." Costa Rican business sectors are 
focusing on the possibility of developing joint investments, 
starting next January, when the TLC, which will regulate the 
trade in approximately 12,000 products, will go into effect. 
  Carlos Alvarado, the Costa Rican Chamber of Commerce 
president, announced that this same week, Costa Rican 
businessmen will start to make contacts in order to attract 
financial investments. 
  Chamber of Industries President Samuel Yankelewitz said the 
TLC "includes all the elements for things to go well" and 
considered it was "just and balanced" for both nations. 
  Doris Osterlof, the executive director of the Export 
Chamber, 
asserted: "Our industry is prepared" to compete with the 
Mexicans. 
  However, Albino Vargas, secretary general of the National 
Association of Public Employees (ANEP,) questioned the Treaty 
because the labor sector had not participated in the three years 
of negotiations and also because the TLC does not state clearly 
the workers' benefits. 
  Another union leader, Guillermo Garcia, told ACAN-EFE the 
TLC 
will benefit the country's development but said unions had 
reservations about the new economic model (the commercial 
opening) and the consequences it can have. 
  Garcia added that the Costa Rican Government will have to 
abrogate protection measures for workers and labor organizations 
because of the pressures the economic opening will have on Costa 
Rican society. 
  The experience of the decades between the 1960's and the 
1980's, Garcia underscored, left a negative balance because "we 
were asked for sacrifice in exchange for future economic bonanza 
and the economic models that were implemented prompted a larger 
social gap and an unfair distribution of the benefits resulting 
from production."

    [Editorial Report] San Jose LA REPUBLICA in Spanish on 24 
March on page 12A reports that public sector participation in 
the loan market dropped from 43 percent to 20 percent during 
1993, leaving the other 80 percent to the private sector. Jorge 
Corrales, president of the Central Bank of Costa Rica, reported 
that services received the larger portion of the funds, thus 
showing a decrease in primary and secondary activities. He 
explained that this behavior is consistent with current economic 
trends, where services tend to show the greatest movement.

  [Text] The restriction of consumerism and an increase in 
public and private savings will be the guidelines for the 
economic policy from now on. 
  This was announced by Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo in an 
address to some 60 businessmen during a meeting organized by 
Foro, an organization that is headed by Maria Tezanos Pinto and 
Eva de Soldati. 
  The following are the highlights of Cavallo's address: 

  -  "I am going to continue at the head of the Economy 
Ministry for quite a long time. I do not feel that President 
Menem is going to ask me to resign in the near future, and I am 
not going to submit my resignation." 
  -  If the Radicals [Radical 
Civic Union -- UCR] win the elections and come to head the 
government, they will implement the same type of economic policy 
that we have implemented. 
  -  Up to the present time, we have had 
favorable international conditions. There was money and a 
willingness to invest in Argentina as there was a recession in 
the United States, Japan, and Europe. But this recession had an 
impact on the markets that receive our exportable products. 
Thus to attract a lot of capital to recover the level of 
investment and to advance in productive modernization was an 
intelligent move. 
  -  In the future we may not be able to obtain so 
much capital for investment. But at the same time there is a 
favorable phenomenon -- the recovery of the United States and 
the recovery that can be seen on the horizon in Japan and Europe 
-- and this will benefit our exports. 
  -  From now it will be 
difficult to obtain resources on the capital market, but it will 
be possible to obtain them on the stock market. The difficulty 
that could emerge from the international financial markets will 
be compensated for by the improved possibilities for placing our 
exports. 
  -  National consumerism will not be able to grow at the 
same rate it has grown for the past 3 years. We are going to 
have to reduce the growth of consumerism, and thus get the 
companies to sell more on the international market. 
  -  We are not 
going to provoke a recession. It would be silly to believe that 
the government is going to devalue in order to resolve the 
problem of the income of capital. 
  -  The government is going to 
invite families to control the increase in consumer outlays, and 
it is going to induce an increase in public and private savings 
but without affecting the increase in productive 
capability. 
  -  There will be innovations that will help in the use 
of the resources that will be used by the administrations of 
pension funds. Article No. 40 of the social welfare reform, 
which guarantees the funds that are deposited with the Bank of 
the Nation, "is causing problems, and we are going to resolve 
these." 
  -  Cavallo took a poke at Jorge Berardi, the president of 
the Stock Exchange, because he had stressed that if the 
pensioners waited until 1 August 1994 to sell their YPF 
[Government Oil Deposits] shares, the broker would have charged 
a lower commission.... "This is very silly, and a lack of 
professionalism." He also indicated that if the majority of the 
96,000 pensioners that hold shares sold them on that day, then 
they would suffer a lot of harm. 
  -  Regarding brokers, "there are 
signs of a lack of maturity and too many individual gambits. It 
seems that they play the stock market in the same way one plays 
in the casino."

  [Text] The creation of a Finance Ministry is practically a 
fact. The candidate? Public Income Secretary Carlos Tacchi 
appears to be the perfect man for the job. 
  No one can forget the president's plaudits regarding Tacchi, 
nor his very good relations with Minister Domingo Cavallo. 
  The Economy Ministry's prognosis for the upcoming elections 
is very optimistic. It is therefore to be believed that in the 
near future the number of ministries will be increased. 
  The division of the Economy Ministry is becoming more and 
more of a fact with the reform of the Constitution. 
  The economic team has always held the hypothesis that public 
resources must be managed by one organization during a new stage. 
  In the corridors of the Economy Ministry, Tacchi appeared to 
be the most solid person to give life to an alternate 
organization to that of Cavallo. 
  And at Government House, the full endorsement that Carlos 
Menem has given the "collector" seems to place him at the top of 
the list of those whose names were mentioned by the presidential 
clique. 
  The president is always repeating in addition that Tacchi 
knows more about tax legislation than Cavallo himself. 
  In second place, the names of Vice Economy Minister Carlos 
Sanchez, followed by that of Finance Secretary Ricardo 
Gutierrez, were mentioned. 
  Cavallo was, however, more cautious in mentioning 
candidates. 
He preferred not to make any forecasts, and only repeated that 
anyone on his team is prepared for the post. 
  The campaign closes today. There is no doubt that the 
Economy Ministry foresees a favorable outcome. Some analysts 
are asking themselves whether a future ministry managed by 
Tacchi might not cast a cloud over Domingo Cavallo.

<F P=106> [Article by Eduardo Barcelona] </F>
  [Text] Brigadier Eugenio Miari, auditor general of the 
Armed Forces, has asked the chiefs of staff and the Foreign 
Ministry to send him all background material on the violations 
committed by the British against Argentine soldiers during the 
Malvinas War. The request is the auditor's first firm 
demonstration after having received the report of the Defense 
Committee on the crimes committed during the conflict. 
  The chiefs of staff must answer as soon as possible, but the 
Foreign Ministry has not acknowledged Miari's authority to 
submit the data, and has asked the Defense Ministry to confirm 
the authenticity of the military auditor. Defense Ministry 
spokespersons made it clear that the Foreign Ministry's reply 
must be understood within the context of the interminable 
internal discord that has separated the ministries for a very 
long time. 
  Institutional Affairs Under Secretary Roberto Ahumada sent a 
note expressing his support for Miari, which was received by 
Foreign Policy Under Secretary Rogelio Pfierter. 
  The first thing that the Foreign Ministry officials said in 
public was that they had no knowledge of the report, something 
that happens to be true. But the political view of the people 
at the Defense Ministry was that the diplomats "are very 
sensitive, and air the disagreements in the newspapers." 
  Reliable sources at the Auditor General's Office said that 
"Miari wants to know how the Foreign Ministry granted Scotland 
Yard permission to come and investigate the alleged Malvinas war 
crimes." 
  Miari, a Malvinas War veteran, is also investigating 
something that could cause real harm to the British: accusing 
them of perfidy. This is considered a crime according to the 
Geneva Convention. 
  According to the sources, the British exhorted the 
Argentines 
to surrender, with the promise that if they did so they would be 
looked after properly. This message was heard in the islands 
over British radios from the time the Task Force disembarked in 
San Carlos Bay. The Defense Committee's report outlines the 
killing of the Argentine soldiers at the hands of the British. 
  For Miari, this is an act of perfidy. It is the same as 
using a white flag as a tactic for distracting the attention of 
the enemy. The Auditor's Office is convinced that if it can 
prove the allegations, the international charges would be as 
serious as an accusation of homicide. "In a future war no one 
would believe the British, and they could suffer more casualties 
than they otherwise think they might," the military sources said.

<F P=106> [Article by Graciela Guadalupe: "Politicians: A Majority in </F>
the Constituent Assembly"] 
  [Text] Pact: The two leading parties prefer to take 
"loyal" delegates to the convention in order to secure the 
Olivos Pact. Fewer than 10 percent will be specialized 
jurists. 
  Nearly half of the 305 delegates to the Constituent 
Convention will be lawyers, the lists of candidates from the 
nation as a whole reveal. 
  However, jurists specializing in constitutional law will 
comprise less than 10 percent of the total number of attorneys. 
  The projected profile of the future convention, based on the 
votes obtained by political forces in the most recent elections, 
will also include a large number of teachers and doctors, 
followed by trade unionists, engineers, clerk/secretaries, and 
businessmen. 
  They will be joined by economists, accountants, farmers, and 
journalists, plus dentists, former military men, housewives, a 
bishop, and possibly a poet! 
  However, the list would not be representative if it were not 
observed that a very large percentage of these professionals--no 
more than a dozen of the likely conventioneers have no higher or 
university degrees--have not toiled in their profession for 
years, having devoted all their efforts to politics. 
<H5>  Members </H5>
  Therefore, it is not surprising to find provincial or 
national lawmakers, intendants, officials from various areas, 
and party presidents who, by virtue of their charisma, their 
distinguished political careers, because they are in positions 
of leadership, or based on strictly numerical considerations 
will supply more votes for the partisan mills. 
  The party affiliation of most candidates would seem to 
indicate that the convention will have more of a political than 
constituent tint. The points of greatest interest to President 
Carlos Menem and Raul Alfonsin, head of the UCR [Radical Civic 
Union], were put together in a "package" that will be voted upon 
without being opened! Which explains the concern of the leaders 
of the two majority parties over taking delegates to the 
convention who will be faithful to the Olivos Pact rather than 
ones who might contribute to reform. 
<H5>  Insurance </H5>
  It is the Justicialist Party (PJ) that is most interested in 
the business of election insurance. Many of those heading the 
lists are in fact provincial governors, followed by deputy 
governors and even former governors. 
  Ramon Ortega (Tucuman), Adolfo Rodriguez Saa (San Luis), 
Nestor Kirchner (Santa Cruz), Eduardo Duhalde (Buenos Aires), 
Carlos Reutemann (Santa Fe), Ruben Marin (La Pampa), Mario Moine 
(Entre Rios), and Federico Puerta (Misiones) head the PJ lists 
as well as the governments of their respective districts, while 
Radical Carlos Maestro does the same in Chubut. 
  Deputy Governors Gildo Insfran (Formosa), Julio Diaz Lozano 
(Tucuman), Eduardo Arnold (Santa Cruz), and Miguel Robles (Santa 
Fe) will back their chiefs from the next, although no less 
predictable, posts. Also enjoying every chance at a convention 
spot are former Peronist governors Arturo Puricelli (Santa Cruz) 
and Jorge Escobar, removed from his stewardship of San Juan. 
  Two governors will have the inestimable presence of their 
wives in the assembly: Evangelina Salazar de Ortega (former 
actress) and Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner (attorney) are 
certain to represent Tucuman and Santa Cruz respectively at the 
convention. 
  Because of its legal status, the capital could not fall back 
on the governor, but the ruling party found a way to make sure 
the assumed insurance would be just as important as in the rest 
of the districts. The names topping that list belong to five 
officials from the Central Government: Carlos Corach (legal and 
technical secretary), Raul Matera (Science and Technology 
secretary), Matilde Menendez (head of PAMI [Comprehensive 
Medical Assistance Plan]), Claudia Bello (Civil Service 
secretary), and Adelina Dalesio de Viola (president of the 
National Mortgage Bank). 
  Justicialists Alberto Pierri and Eduardo Menem, who head the 
Chamber of Deputies and Senate, will be convention delegates 
from Buenos Aires and La Rioja, while the UCR will send former 
President Raul Alfonsin to the assembly, also for Buenos Aires. 
<H5>  Bishops and Poets </H5>
  Few convention candidates are from unusual professions (no 
value judgment intended). Among them, Jaime de Nevares, bishop 
emeritus of Neuquen, will very likely have a seat, representing 
the Grand Front, along with poet David Gatica (PJ, La Rioja). 
However, the latter is an alternate on the party list. 
  The names of farmers Oscar Paz (Republican Force, Tucuman) 
and Jose Piccinato (UCR, Santiago del Estero) and journalists 
Jose Mantilla (PJ, La Pampa) and Domingo Schiavoni (PJ, Santiago 
del Estero) are sure to go down in history. 
  Formosa Deputy Governor Insfran is a veterinarian, a 
profession he shares with La Pampa Radical Carlos D'Amico. 
  Susana Sanchez (UCR, La Pampa) is a housewife, while the 
first candidate for the Cordoban UCR, Ramon Mestre, is a dentist 
and the former intendant of Cordoba. 
  One important fact for possible future mothers who might be 
active in the Constituent Convention: They will be able to rely 
on the presence of delegate Ada de Liggerini (PJ, Entre Rios), 
who is an obstetrician.

<F P=106> [Article by Sergio Levit: "The PJ Devises a Chamber of </F>
Deputies Strategy To Safeguard Olivos Pact"] 
  [Text] No risk: To prevent the pact from failing, the 
ruling party is reportedly promoting a reform of the Lower 
Chamber's procedures. 
  The Justicialist Party (PJ) is reportedly backing a 
modification of the Chamber of Deputies' procedures in order to 
prevent the Olivos Pact from running the risk of failing during 
the Constituent Convention due to a procedural matter, one 
highly placed source in the Chamber has admitted. 
  "We have the strong impression that the party in power will 
try to change Chamber procedures, which means modifying the 
rules of play for the Convention," LA NACION was told by Raul 
Galvan, president of the UCR [Radical Civic Union] bloc of 
deputies. 
  The first step in that direction was the appointment of 
prominent deputies to the Commission on Petitions, Powers, and 
Bylaws of the Lower Chamber, a parliamentary body traditionally 
enjoying little importance. 
  The convention will be governed by Chamber of Deputies 
bylaws, whose Article 176 states textually that: "All voting 
will be done on a single, specific article, proposal, or term, 
but when any of the latter contain several ideas that may be 
separated, the parts may be voted on separately if so requested 
by any deputy." 
  In other words, any delegate to the Constituent Convention 
could ask that the core of basic agreements be voted on 
separately. If the motion garners enough votes, reelection of 
the president, creation of the post of head of the Cabinet, 
direct election of the intendant of Buenos Aires, and 
standardization of the terms of the Executive and Legislative 
branches would have to be considered one by one. 
  Although this would at first glance appear to present no 
difficulty for the government, one has but to recall that Alvaro 
Alsogaray, the leading candidate for the Constituent Convention 
for the rightist alliance from Buenos Aires, has stated 
repeatedly that he opposes the pact "because it implies a 
modification which conceals a desire for reelection. It would 
have been better if the statement of the need for reform 
contained a single article allowing reelection," he explained 
during the Chamber's debate. 
  This example, which is apparently valid in terms of the 
governing party's intentions, could endanger the survival of the 
pact since everything would be debated with an unpredictable 
outcome. "Fear did in fact exist with respect to what the 
Constituent Convention might decide, for which reason it was 
explicitly stated that voting would be done on the package of 
measures," one deputy from the ruling party admitted. 
  However, Galvan places more emphasis on a proposal gathering 
dust in the Commission, one that sets time limits on the 
statements of lawmakers, which could open the door "to other 
modifications." 
<H5>  Commission </H5>
  Any amendment to Chamber procedures must be considered by 
the 
Commission on Petitions, Powers, and Bylaws that was appointed 
yesterday. 
  The Commission is chaired by Radical Mario Negri and 
includes, among other PJ members, Humberto Romero, Horacio 
Macedo, Marcelo Lopez Arias, Alberto Balestrini, Damaso 
Larraburu, Eduardo Varela Cid, Osvaldo Borda, and Miguel 
D'Alessandro. The UCD [Democratic Center Union] is represented 
by Francisco de Duranona y Vedla, the Salta Renewal Party by 
Jorge Folloni, and, in addition to Negri, the Radicals include 
Leopoldo Moreau, Antonio Hernandez, Sergio Montiel, and Rene 
Balestra, among others. 
  The UCR's concern over any modification of the bylaws has 
prompted the scheduling next week of a meeting of its deputies 
sitting on the Commission. The meeting could result in clashes 
because while Moreau is a staunch defender of the pact, Montiel 
detests the Menem-Alfonsin accord. 
  The alleged intention of the defenders of the accord, led by 
the government, is to ward off any possible risk of witnessing 
the failure of an agreement put together with such zeal.

  [Text] The Army Ministry has been following the charges 
being made about the involvement of police and members of the 
judicial and legislative branches in the numbers game scandal. 
The ministry does not dismiss the possibility of intervention in 
Rio de Janeiro if the state government requests, and the 
president of the Republic so determines. General Gilberto Serra, 
who is Army Minister Zenildo Lucena's spokesman, said: "We are 
following the situation, as our constitutional duties tell us 
to." The Army leadership believes the possibility of an Armed 
Forces' initiative would not have the explicit characteristics 
of an intervention, but of assistance. 
  Chamber of Deputies President Inocencio Oliveira admitted 
the 
possibility of creating a numbers game Congressional 
Investigating Committee to look into charges being made against 
deputies. In Congress, the legislators did not hide their fear 
that the scandal will affect the institution. In Rio de Janeiro, 
Deputy Jorge Bittar -- Workers Party leader in the Chamber of 
Deputies -- announced that he will ask for Mayor Cesar Maia's 
impeachment [preceding word in English].

<F P=106> [Interview with PFL national President Jorge Bornhausen by </F>
Rita Tavares; place and date not given -- first paragraph is 
JORNAL DO BRASIL introduction] 
  [Text] The national 
president of the PFL [Liberal Front Party], former Minister 
Jorge Bornhausen, is convinced his party has a strong candidate 
for the presidency of Brazil, a modern platform for governing, 
and that the party rank and file are ready to go to work. That, 
according to him, is enough reason for the PFL not to agree to 
participate in a coalition unless it is part of the majority 
slate. In other words, the PFL wants the vice presidency, and if 
it does not get that spot on the ticket, it will nominate Bahia 
Governor Antonio Carlos Magalhaes for president. Despite 
resistance from sectors of the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy 
Party] to a rapprochement with the PFL, Bornhausen is not 
worried and almost disregards the subject. He says that Finance 
Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso is modern and in tune with 
the liberals. The former minister respects his former partner in 
the Democratic Alliance, the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement 
Party], and said people must not underestimate the strength of 
the party in the coming campaign, but his judgement on the PT 
[Workers Party] is different. Bornhausen believes the PT is tied 
to communism and that Luis Inacio Lula da Silva is not 
sufficiently prepared for Planalto Palace. Although he has 
definite opinions about his opponents, his position regarding 
Sao Paulo Mayor Paulo Maluf (PPR) [Progressive Renewal Party] is 
an unknown. Bornhausen was in Sao Paulo this week to explain the 
PFL's negotiations with Fernando Henrique to his friend. At the 
same time, the former minister does not rule out a coalition 
with the party of Maluf, which he says is the PFL's natural 
ally. Maluf's PPR has the platform that most closely resembles 
the PFL's system of ideas. 
  [Tavares] Does an alliance between the PFL and PSDB 
necessarily mean that the PFL would occupy the vice presidential 
spot on a slate headed by Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso? 
  [Bornhausen] I believe that the PFL, with about 3 million 
members, 18,000 city councilmen, over 1,000 mayors, about 200 
state deputies, more than 100 federal legislators, and nine 
governors is in a position to run its own candidate for 
president. In fact, it has a natural candidate in Governor 
Antonio Carlos Magalhaes. If any alliance is to be made for the 
sake of this country, it is obvious that a political 
organization with this kind of strength cannot be left off the 
presidential slate. 
  [Tavares] If the PFL were to be given ministries and 
influential state enterprises in the composition of the future 
administration, wouldn't it have an important and sufficient 
role? 
  [Bornhausen] It must be very clear that the PFL is not going 
to discuss participation in the government. The PFL is going to 
discuss its plan for governing. We adopted a course of action at 
the convention: the party would first develop a platform; only 
later would it select its candidate for president. We put 
together a team of Brazilian notables: Drs. Daniel Dantas, Paulo 
Guedes, Paulo Rabello de Castro, Roberto Procopio Lima Netto, 
Thomaz Pompeu Magalhaes, Nilton Molina, as well as our 
distinguished colleague Mauro Salles, are all members of this 
committee. I plan to have this document ready by the end of 
March, and we are absolutely not concerned about what posts we 
might hold. We want Brazil to experience a resumption of 
development, to see jobs being created again, because Brazil's 
social problem cannot be resolved by paternalism. Not at 
all--unless new jobs can be created, Brazilians will not really 
be able to exercise citizenship. It is a platform that gives 
preference to education. 
  [Tavares] Won't it be necessary to hold high office in order 
to carry out this platform? 
  [Bornhausen] The PFL is not worried about holding office in 
this or that state enterprise. On the contrary: we want them to 
disappear, for there to be as few as possible of them. We want a 
smaller state. We want privatization. We want a modern state 
where the citizen is respected, a state devoted to education, 
health, and safety. There is no need to talk about any coalition 
in terms of ministries. However, the political participation and 
political influence of the PFL demand that it be part of the 
presidential slate. 
  [Tavares] Has the platform changed the identity of the PFL 
in 
any way? What is the party's identity today? 
  [Bornhausen] The PFL was not born at a meeting of a group of 
liberals who formed a political party. It was born at an 
historic moment when the members of a political organization 
decided they could not tolerate the absence of freedom to select 
their candidate for president. Therefore, it was born so that 
the transition to the democratic system could take place. The 
PFL platform is a liberal platform. I was the coordinator of 
that platform. But the party was not born of those ideas 
exactly; for that very reason, we have taken some very difficult 
positions at different times, because the party was not 
preaching what was in its platform. 
  [Tavares] On what occasions did that happen? 
  [Bornhausen] We went so far as to have, in 1989, a candidate 
for president who had nothing liberal about him, a man who even 
today defends the monopolies every chance he gets. Although he 
is a man of the greatest political integrity, Dr. Aureliano 
Chaves is in no sense a modern and progressive liberal. He is 
really a statist. So now, the PFL is living according to its 
program. The opportunity provided by the constitutional revision 
was precisely what enabled us to put the party on the road to 
modern and progressive liberalism and be a party that truly 
wants to solve Brazil's problems, via the market. The PFL knows 
that is the only way to actually achieve a breakthrough on those 
serious social problems that exist in Brazil. So we are in a new 
phase: that of identity with our platform. And for that very 
reason we do not want to discuss possible government posts. We 
want to talk about ideas. 
  [Tavares] Isn't there a contradiction in that reasoning? 
Former Minister Aureliano Chaves is now a member of the PSDB, a 
party the PFL is talking about allying with for the presidential 
race. And there are strong factions in the PSDB that think the 
same way as the former minister does. Isn't the PFL, once again, 
giving up its platform? 
  [Bornhausen] I want to make it very clear that the PSDB has 
its own platform and that certainly if there is any 
alliance--remember, there is none as yet--we will have to sit 
down at the table with each party's platform and see what the 
common points are and pick out the parts that Brazil needs. And 
I believe the PSDB leadership is modern enough to find these 
points. 
  [Tavares] Would you say that, right now, the party is 
leaning 
more towards running its own candidate, or towards forging a 
coalition? 
  [Bornhausen] As a result of what I am doing right now with 
Senate leader Marco Maciel and Chamber leader Luis Eduardo 
Magalhaes, and with the party's secretary general Deputy Eraldo 
Tinoco--which is to listen to the senators, and the federal and 
state deputies, the chairmen of the party executive boards, and 
the governors--I can say, after consulting the delegations from 
the south, southeast, and west central regions, that the party 
prefers to run its own candidate and that, if he wants to run, 
the governor of Bahia is the natural candidate of the party 
without any reservation. He would have the support and 
enthusiasm of all the units of the PFL. That is really what the 
PFL prefers. 
  [Tavares] What happened? Until last week, even Governor 
Antonio Carlos was publicly advocating an alliance with the 
tucanos. Is it resistance from parts of the PSDB that 
hinders this coalition? 
  [Bornhausen] I believe the ideal is for each party to have 
its own candidate. Governor Antonio Carlos announced his 
candidacy, but added that it was not irrevocable and that, in 
his view, the country should look beyond partisan interests. 
That gesture was typical of a public figure. So we came to the 
conclusion that it was possible to study not only whether to run 
a candidate of our own, but consider alliances as well. 
Incidentally, we never ruled out alliances with any party. 
  [Tavares] Is there a possibility of a rapprochement with the 
PMDB? 
  [Bornhausen] It is very unlikely at the moment, because the 
PMDB is experiencing internal conflict that will be decided at 
its convention. If you don't know how the convention will turn 
out, you cannot sit down at a table to negotiate. That's the 
problem, but we are moving in the direction of several accords 
with the PMDB. 
  [Tavares] For example? 
  [Bornhausen] At the state level--Pernambuco, for example. 
  [Tavares] How do you explain the fact that the PMDB, the 
PFL's former partner in the Democratic Alliance, is not much of 
a factor in the presidential succession contest? 
  [Bornhausen] I do not think the PMDB is a weak party. I see 
strong grass-roots support there. It is going through internal 
difficulties, there is internal dissension, and that really is 
not good for the party. But to underestimate the PMDB is not to 
understand Brazilian politics. It is a party with a very 
significant number of members, of city councilmen, of 
mayors...and it certainly will not fail to have a role in this 
campaign that bears watching. 
  [Tavares] What can be done to circumvent some of the 
resistance that has emerged among some tucanos to a 
rapprochement with the PFL? 
  [Bornhausen] I think each party has its own life and should 
live that life within its own walls, following the path of its 
particular position. It is not appropriate for me to comment on 
the behavior of A or B, because that is something that has to be 
resolved internally. Just as I would not accept comments on 
behavior within my party, it is not right for me to comment on 
things outside my party, because it is a matter interna 
corporis for the PSDB. I just don't think there should be 
intrigues at this point. That's all. 
  [Tavares] Do you see Minister Fernando Henrique as an 
antidote to the candidacy of Luis Inacio Lula da Silva? 
  [Bornhausen] I don't believe people in this country should 
ever think about being against someone. What we need to be is 
pro-Brazil. We need to opt for a platform that makes Brazil 
resume its development, that admits this country into the world, 
because today we are a country that is very closed toward what 
is most modern in the world and we really must find a candidate 
who is prepared to carry out an open program. Not to think 
against others, but to think in favor of Brazil. 
  [Tavares] So Lula's candidacy doesn't scare you? 
  [Bornhausen] No, it is a respectable candidacy from the 
election politics standpoint. I do not believe, however, that 
Lula is well-prepared to be president of Brazil and I do not 
believe that his party has overcome the reasons that led to its 
creation. It is still attached to what is most backward in the 
world, which is communism. 
  [Tavares] What does Lula lack? 
  [Bornhausen] I think Lula lacks administrative experience, 
political ability, and a modern party. 
  [Tavares] How strong do you think Fernando Henrique Cardoso 
is as a candidate today? 
  [Bornhausen] In the first place, I do not think his 
candidacy 
can be assessed until it actually exists. In other words, we 
must wait until Minister Fernando Henrique says he is a 
candidate, leaves the ministry, goes out into the public square, 
and returns to the Senate to play the additional role of working 
for his plan which is to modernize this country, in the 
constitutional revision. Then we can evaluate him. What I 
believe is that Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso is a man who 
is prepared to be president of Brazil. 
  [Tavares] Isn't there a risk that the minister might be seen 
as a candidate of the more intellectual segments of society, 
that he might not have popular appeal? 
  [Bornhausen] I think that a candidate for president of 
Brazil 
should be as well-prepared as possible. I cannot fault someone 
who is cultured and intelligent. 
  [Tavares] But do you think he has charisma? 
  [Bornhausen] I think he has run for office before, he has 
won 
before, and he has lost before. Well, he has enough electoral 
experience and his language is suited to all strata of society. 
He is modern. Now, obviously, I have to say this does not mean 
that the PFL will take that road. I repeat: the PFL has a 
natural candidate in Governor Antonio Carlos Magalhaes. The PFL 
has not closed the doors to an understanding with any party. 
This week, we visited the mayor of Sao Paulo. 
  [Tavares] What was the significance of that conversation 
with 
Mayor Paulo Maluf? 
  [Bornhausen] I believe that Mayor Paulo Maluf had been 
talking with the PFL, and with the PP [Progressive Party], and 
deserved to hear from us an explanation of our party's current 
position. By this I mean what we are doing, what we are finding 
out in this x-ray of our colleagues in terms of the progress of 
the presidential succession process. He has a deadline when he 
must make a decision and it is not my business to talk about 
that. But I did have an obligation to tell him what was 
happening in the PFL, and that is what I did. And my explanation 
was clear: there is a clear preference in favor of having 
Governor Antonio Carlos Magalhaes as our candidate. Only if he 
does not run will we discuss the problem of alliances. I think I 
made that very clear. 
  [Tavares] Did Mayor Maluf suggest an alliance with the PFL? 
  [Bornhausen] Of course. He proposed either supporting 
Governor Antonio Carlos for president, or receiving an 
indication of a vice presidential candidate on a slate he would 
head. I took this issue to my fellow leaders in the party. And 
that possibility can certainly not be ruled out. 
  [Tavares] Historically, the PFL has always been more closely 
associated with the PPR than with any other Brazilian party. If 
the PFL could choose between a coalition with the PPR or with 
the PSDB, which road would it take? 
  [Bornhausen] I think the partisan/political platform of the 
PFL is closer to the PPR than to the PSDB, but there are no 
insuperable problems between the platforms of the PFL and PSDB. 
Either road could easily be taken. 
  [Tavares] Isn't there a point of conflict between the two 
parties, since part of the PSDB still favors some very statist 
ideas that go against the PFL ideology? 
  [Bornhausen] In this case, I know the views of Minister 
Fernando Henrique, and they coincide with those of the PFL. 
  [Tavares] Aren't you worried about this resistance within 
the 
PSDB? 
  [Bornhausen] I think Minister Fernando Henrique has a 
position, and if he becomes the candidate, there is no reason 
for me to worry about some opposing minority views. 
  [Tavares] You said the PFL still needs to reach a decision, 
internally. How much more time does the party need before it can 
take a position? 
  [Bornhausen] I think we will decide within a month, at most, 
i.e., during the first half of April.
