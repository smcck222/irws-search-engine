<F P=106> [Article by Jorge Antonio Barros] </F>
  [Text] The Federal Police wants to plug one of the biggest 
holes in the "Swiss cheese" that has made the international 
airport of Rio de Janeiro notorious for permitting weapons 
smuggled from Miami, in the United States, to enter this 
country. Chief Edson Antonio de Oliveira, superintendent of the 
Federal Police in Rio, revealed that for the first time he has 
won a commitment from the Federal Revenue Secretariat to 
cooperate and facilitate registration of the weapons seized, or 
merely retained, at the airport. In six months, the revenue 
authorities have retained about 100 weapons, out of a total of 
almost a ton of equipment and ammunition. 
  With the cooperation of the revenue authorities, the Federal 
Police will be able to add new information to a dossier that, in 
two years, has already listed more than 150 individuals involved 
with weapons smuggling in Rio. A good many of these are 
policemen, such as detective Luiz Eduardo Sato, who was arrested 
last month on Andarai Hill in possession of 22 kg of cocaine 
paste and ammunition for the AR-15, an American rifle that has 
become the weapon of choice for Rio bandits. Arrested along with 
informant Luiz Alexandre Etiene Ferreira, Sato was supplying 
ammunition to the enemies of his coworkers. He was assigned to 
the 37th precinct (Governor's Island). Proximity to the airport 
makes the neighborhood one of the main gateways for weapons 
entering Rio. 
<H5>  Miami </H5>
  According to police findings, Sato was a trusted lieutenant 
of trafficker Romildo de Souza da Costa, aka 
Miltinho, of Dende Hill--also on Governor's 
Island--who became known as one of the biggest suppliers of 
weapons to Rio traffickers. Sato is thought to also have had 
connections to dollar-trader Oto Gomes de Miranda, who was 
arrested along with four other Brazilians in Miami in April 1991 
and accused of smuggling weapons to Rio. 
  The arrest of the Brazilians--who had used a Miami house to 
store 400 weapons for smuggling--led the superintendent of the 
Federal Police in Rio to begin, two years ago, an exchange with 
the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF), an agency of 
the U.S. Department of the Treasury. On that occasion, the 
Bureau estimated at more than 50 buyers the number of weapons 
smugglers working the Miami-Rio-Medellin route. They take 
advantage of Florida laws, which do not restrict the sale of 
firearms. 
<H5>  Investigation </H5>
  After making contact with the ATF, Edson de Oliveira 
realized 
that only gradually, by patient investigatory work, could he 
deal a blow to the contraband in weapons in Rio. Not only were 
police and people with access to the air freight terminal 
involved--which hampered the investigation--but the business is 
extremely profitable and attracts people who are even willing to 
kill potential witnesses. For example, an AR-15 rifle costs 
about $700 in the United States, while in Brazil it can command 
the princely sum of $5,000. 
  Just as the contraband is carried out in an "ant-like" 
procession, as Edson de Oliveira described it, the files on the 
illegal trade in weapons also require a meticulous search. The 
leading smugglers stroll through the airport baggage areas 
weekly, while they divert weapons through the Teca (Air Cargo 
Terminal) at Galeao. That is why Edson asked for help from the 
Federal Revenue Service, whose inspectors never bothered to 
notify the police when they seized weapons. They look at the 
problem as one of tax evasion. 
  It seems simple. The revenue inspectors and technicians work 
with the federal police in the same space--the restricted 
section of the airport--but the communications links between 
them were never very strong. Revenue Inspector Sylvio Jose 
Barros de Sa Freire, assigned to the Rio international airport, 
admits that the inspectors took the initiative only to report 
criminal facts to the Office of Prosecutor of the Ministry of 
Finance, as the law requires. The inspectors claim the area is a 
"primary zone" in which only revenue officers can act. 
Therefore, the information on the individual carrying the weapon 
got lost in the desk drawers of the bureaucracy. 
<H5>  Customs Has Few Inspectors </H5>
  Inspector Sa Freire admits that 200 inspectors are not 
enough 
to control the customs service at the airport. He says the 
number should be doubled, at least. With 30 years of service but 
only eight months in this section, Sa Freire reports that the 
Federal Revenue Secretariat has a plan to come to the aid of the 
customs officers, revenue watchmen who have police powers. 
  Despite the shortage of personnel, the federal revenue 
inspectors at the airport have almost quintupled the sums 
collected at that post. In eight months, they have seized a 
total of $30 million in goods, including weapons. The latter 
usually rust away at Revenue Secretariat warehouses. Even so, Sa 
Freire admits that the service has been significantly dismantled 
in the past 10 years because of administrative policies leading 
to a relaxation in that sector. 
  That is why he advocates stricter laws on the entry of 
weapons into Brazil. "Even the Army, which regulates weapons, 
ought to issue authorizations in advance," Sa Freire pointed 
out. Any weapon can be brought into Brazil without prior 
authorization, provided the Ministry of the Army [subsequently] 
authorizes its entry. When caught with concealed weapons, the 
smugglers almost always claim to be collectors. Even so, 
according to the Federal Police, the air cargo terminal is still 
one of the key points of entry for weapons that are then shipped 
elsewhere in boats that ply Guanabara Bay. 
  Sa Freire also announced measures that have been put into 
effect since he took the assignment in July, with a view to 
plugging the holes in the "Swiss cheese." 
  Using 36 cameras that operate 24 hours a day to transmit and 
record movements in strategic sectors, the airport revenue 
inspectors plan to achieve the following goals: eliminate the 
selection of baggage on flights considered high-risk (those from 
Miami, New York, and Latin countries where there is a high 
incidence of drug traffic), containerize the freight beginning 
right at the door of the airplane hold to sort of "suck out" the 
goods; and link computers with European and American airline 
systems in order to check the freight manifests.

  [Text] It's raining Russians in Rio. They come from cities 
like Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Nijni Novgorod--among others. 
Their passports say Vladimir, Ilia, Igor, Irina, and Olga. The 
Russians are coming to town in an invasion as sweet as their 
Slavic accents. The wave is swelling to such a point as to 
constitute a new tourist boom, far from the prejudices of the 
Cold War. But the invasion has not only sent tourists; it has 
brought more than 30 scientists and high-tech researchers, 
first-rate "brains" from the former Soviet Union, now settled 
down and teaching at institutions like Rio de Janeiro State 
University (UERJ) and the State University of Northern Rio de 
Janeiro [UENF] in Campos. 
  "For us in Rio, this is an occasion as important as the 
arrival of 40 of Europe's brightest at the University of Sao 
Paulo (USP) during the Second World War. It was that importation 
of `brains' that gave USP the influence it has today," said 
Senator Darcy Ribeiro. 
<H5>  Competition </H5>
  As chancellor of UENF, Ribeiro has already sent three 
delegations to Russia to compete--mainly with Israel, Germany, 
the United States, and Japan--for the chance to transfer to 
Brazil "22 of the best and the brightest," who were orphaned by 
the dismantling of Soviet scientific institutions. Not wanting 
to be left behind in the seduction of Russian "brains," UERJ 
Rector Hesio Cordeiro has now brought five scientists to his 
campus. 
  When it comes to tourism, it is also "the Russians' turn" 
now, said Olga Dalamarczuk, assigned by Hotur (Association of 
Tourist Hotels of Rio) to take care of the visitors from that 
country. In general, these are people from the middle class who 
have benefited from the economic reforms begun in 1992. An 
Aeroflot flight brings groups of 50 every week. That has led 
Riotur and Hotur to invest in promoting Rio in the Russian 
capital. 
<H5>  Salary Makes Move Worthwhile </H5>
  "They say that if you go to Salvador, you'd better not drop 
anything on the floor because if it makes a noise the Bahians 
will think it is a new rhythm and will start dancing." The joke, 
which conveys a feeling of intimacy with things Brazilian, is 
told by Irina Potapenko, a Russian physicist and mathematician 
who has been here for three months. Along with her colleagues 
Arthur Elfimov, Vladimir Tsypin, Nicolay Grishanov, and Fedor 
Nekrasov--all theoreticians in plasma physics (a scientific 
field concerned with such things as making better use of solar 
energy)--she works at the Department of Quantum Electronics at 
the UERJ School of Physics. 
  Like her colleagues, Irina likes Rio, "a city that combines 
modern buildings, the sea, unusual mountain shapes, and 
hospitable people," as she puts it. The Russian scientists earn 
$1,000 (CR$700,000) a month at UERJ. In their own country, 
researchers would earn only $80.00 (CR$56,000) a month. "Russia 
has no means of investing in science. But since scientific 
knowledge is universal, it is better to do the work here than 
sit idle back there. Later, we can take the results back home," 
said Elfimov. 
<H5>  Supply </H5>
  The researchers recall that their country now has 1.5 
million 
researchers at the doctorate level, plus 200,000 scientists who 
have attained the highest level of education--all of them 
susceptible to becoming part of the "brain drain." Another 
physicist, Sergei Ivanov, came to Rio to develop "x-ray 
equipment to measure tension inside metals." He lives with his 
wife Nina and daughter Maria in Leblon. "Russia pays specialists 
low wages. Some day I'll go back. Although my 9-year-old 
daughter, who attends Saint Patrick School in Leblon, wants to 
stay in Rio. You say there are criminals here? Well, there are 
criminals in Russia, too," observed Ivanov. 
  At the State University of Northern Rio de Janeiro [UENF] in 
Campos, says its president, Gilca Wainstein, an elaborate 
process of transfer and absorption of technology is under way. 
"We sent delegations to the Russian Academy of Sciences and 
reviewed more than 80 resumes from each scientific field. The 
idea is that even if the Russians go back to their own country, 
they will leave the technology here," said the university 
president. At UENF, 22 Russian researchers are earning about 
$3,000 (CR$2.1 million) each. They work in sophisticated 
specialty fields of biotechnology, diamond technology, fracture 
and corrosion engineering, and oil and gas.

<F P=106> [Article by Nicanor Leon Cotayo: "The Path of Truth Opens </F>
to Cuba"] 
  [Text] Havana [no date as received] -- For the third time 
in three years the U.S. Government has recognized Cuba's serious 
efforts and efficiency in the antidrug-trafficking struggle in 
or near the island's territorial waters and airspace. 
  On the first occasion, an AP wire dispatch reported on 7 
March 1991 that Washington "stated today in an official report 
the antidrug campaign initiated by Cuba almost two years ago in 
its territorial waters and airspace has aided in reducing 
narcotrafficking in the Caribbean." 
  The State Department report, always cited by AP, admitted 
that in 1990 "the Cuban Government continued to maintain its 
policy of denying Cuban airspace and territory to the (narco) 
traffickers, and there was broad evidence of its efforts begun 
in mid-1989 which curbed drug trafficking." 
  Later, on 12 April 1993, a NOTIMEX wire dispatch reported: 
  "A U.S. State Department report published earlier this month 
recognizes Cuba's cooperation in controlling drug trafficking in 
1992." 
  "The Cuban Government continues to give a high profile to 
its 
antidrug policy, part of which has been substantiated by 
actions, the U.S. branch report stated." 
  Now, on Monday, the Spanish news agency EFE announced from 
Washington that a U.S. State Department report on international 
narcotrafficking stated the Cuban Government continues to grant 
priority to its antidrug policy and that in 1993 it cooperated 
with the United States, "the largest drug consumer in the world." 
  That same document admitted that in the past five years, 
heroin consumption increased in the United States. The document 
noted that due to this, heroin narcotrafficking in Latin America 
has been diversified. 
  According to the U.S. State Department, of all the threats 
entailed in drug trafficking the greatest is its unlimited 
capability to corrupt institutions, among other things, because 
only the value of the drugs confiscated in the United States is 
superior to the gross internal product (GIP) of many countries 
of the hemisphere. 
  Amid this assessment, the U.S. Government added in the 
report 
published this week that Cuba signed the UN 1988 Drug Convention 
and "is working to fulfill many of the convention's objectives." 
  Interestingly enough, the U.S. State Department assessment 
finds somehow that Cuba's antidrug trafficking efforts may 
possibly have not been more extensive because of the blockade 
imposed by the White House on the island more than three decades 
ago. 
  In this sense, the official analysis notes that the scarcity 
of fuel and essential spare parts limits the Cuban Government's 
ability to intercept drug traffickers. 
  As known--it has been generally promoted by the extreme 
rightist sectors of Miami and other Conservative groups in the 
United States--one of the campaigns used insistently against 
Cuba internationally has been to link it with narcotrafficking. 
  This is the third report issued by the U.S. State Department 
on the topic since 1991 in which objectivity prevails above any 
distorting propaganda. The report offers a highly valuable tool 
to anyone who seeks to assess the seriousness of arguments used 
by Cuba at the time that it has to explain its actions or refute 
those who professionally attempt around the clock to distort its 
present situation.

  [Text] Havana, 10 Apr (PL) -- Nicanor Leon Cotayo, a Cuban 
writer and analyst, asserts the station Radio Marti, which the 
U.S. Government established nine years ago to further its 
anti-Cuban policy, is being shaken by chaos and personal 
ambitions. 
  In his article, which TRABAJADORES, the workers union weekly 
publication, is to publish tomorrow, Leon Cotayo states the 
radio station, which costs U.S. taxpayers $19 million, "has 
turned into a madhouse in which shady political dealings 
prevail." 
  He also adds this White House propaganda office has been 
used 
to increase the personal interests of Jorge Mas Canosa, one of 
the most prominent leaders of the ultraconservative sector of 
Cuban emigrants in Miami. 
  He states that during U.S. congressional hearings last year 
to study the radio station's future, several former Radio Marti 
employees had criticized Mas Canosa for promoting an atmosphere 
of fear among those who refused to yield to his points of view 
against Cuba. 
  What's more, the newspaper THE WASHINGTON POST reported on 
23 
March 1994 that several station employees, in private 
interviews, had accused Mas Canosa of imposing on the radio 
station's information line and promoting his personal political 
designs through the radio station, the specialist states. 
  He reports the U.S. newspaper maintained that the Cuban 
community in Miami is saturated with intrigues and that it 
described Mas Canosa as a "shameless political manipulator." 
  Leon Cotayo also quotes an anonymous report, which has been 
widely commented on in the United States, in which Mas Canosa's 
critics are called "sympathizers of communists" and Cuban agents. 
  He says the first investigation into the document's source 
has revealed it had been written by Agustin Alles, the 
information chief of the so-called Radio Marti. Several station 
employees say Alles is one of Mas Canosa's agents at the station.

  [Text] Montevideo, 6 Apr (PL) -- Speaking here today, Cuban 
Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina called for a more humane 
approach to Latin American integration "because its sole purpose 
is the well-being of our peoples." 
  The minister spoke at the Latin American Integration 
Association (ALADI) headquarters. He called on association 
members to work for the convergence of subregional processes and 
for joint action on economic, social, and political issues. He 
referred to the need to accomplish more in this sense by 
gradually integrating production and service sectors. 
  In regard to the island's situation, Robaina asserted that 
his government is taking concrete steps to restore as quickly as 
possible the principal economic indicators. 
  Robaina added that in his country everything is subject to 
debate at several levels so as to resolve current problems. 
  He also denounced the economic, commercial, and financial 
blockade imposed by the United States for the past 30 years and 
said the measure was a flagrant, massive, and systematic 
violation of human rights. 
  The minister added that the Caribbean country will not 
negotiate over its sovereignty or its right to speak for itself. 
Nor will it abandon the social achievements it has accomplished. 
  The head of Cuban diplomacy arrived in Uruguay last Monday 
for an official three-day visit which will continue until 
tomorrow, 7 April, according to reports. 
  During his stay, Robaina was received by President Luis 
Alberto Lacalle and met with cabinet members, including his 
colleague Sergio Abreu, businessmen, intellectuals, and 
compatriots who reside in that country. 
  Robaina's South American tour includes Ecuador, Peru, 
Argentina, and Paraguay, according to sources in the Caribbean 
delegation.

  [Text] Montevideo, 7 [no month as received] (PL) -- Cuban 
Foreign Relations Minister Roberto Robaina today described his 
official visit to Uruguay as very positive. One of the trip's 
main objectives was to renegotiate Cuba's $33-million debt with 
Uruguay. 
  Robaina believes that his contacts with the highest-ranking 
government and banking authorities, entrepreneurs, and 
businessmen, was a first step toward the solution of this 
problem. 
  To this end Robaina explained his government's policies 
regarding the opening to foreign capital as one more alternative 
in facing Cuba's current economic difficulties. 
  The main idea behind this decision is to attract capital, 
technologies, and markets in certain branches such as tourism, 
oil, nickel, communications, science, and others, according to 
his explanation in interviews. 
  During the next few months entrepreneurs and businessmen 
will 
travel to Havana, invited by Robaina, to explore investment 
possibilities. 
  The other purpose behind Robaina's stay in Montevideo is to 
explain Cuba's situation, especially following the end of the 
socialist bloc and a stepped-up U.S.-imposed economic, trade, 
and financial blockade, which has been in force for more than 
three decades. 
  Regarding this, Robaina referred to the efforts of Cubans to 
face the adversities and find solutions through the common 
resolve to increase production and exports. 
  The local media highlighted the visit of the head of Cuban 
diplomacy with a balance that could be considered favorable to 
Cuba's interests, according to observers. 
  Tomorrow, Foreign Minister Robaina and his retinue will make 
a technical stopover in Buenos Aires, Argentina, where they will 
spend all day. Television, radio, and newspaper reporters will 
take advantage of this to obtain exclusive interviews, which are 
already planned, according to Cuban delegation sources. 
  By dawn on Saturday, Robaina will begin his official visit 
to 
Peru, the second stage of his South American tour, which will be 
followed by visits to Argentina and Paraguay.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 8 Apr (PL)--Cuban Foreign Minister 
Roberto Robaina on 9 April gave an account here of the progress 
made in his country's process of opening to foreign capital 
investment. Robaina also spoke of the bustling international 
activity in Cuba and asked for solidarity against the economic 
blockade imposed by the United States over three decades ago. 
  In that regard, Robaina asked for international solidarity 
in 
light of this pressure tactic, which it considers unjust. 
Robaina reiterated Havana's willingness to discuss any topic 
with the United States so long as no strings are attached. 
  Following a meeting with Guido Di Tella, his Argentine 
counterpart, Robaina said that he had informed Di Tella of the 
economic measures Havana has implemented as well as the steps it 
is taking toward integration with Latin America and the 
Caribbean. 
  Robaina also spoke to Di Tella about Cuba's criteria for the 
democratization process of the United Nations; the preparations 
for the upcoming Ibero-American summit in Cartagena, Colombia; 
and a presidential summit called by Washington at the end of 
1994. 
  Robaina, who is here on an official visit on 13 and 14 
April, 
made a stop in Buenos Aires as part of a tour that began in 
Uruguay and will continue with Peru and Paraguay. 
  Robaina gave a news conference following his one-hour 
meeting 
with Di Tella and said that Cuba and Argentina are living in a 
"new phase with a smoother communication." 
  Commenting that Cuban-Argentine relations "have overcome 
difficulties," he pointed out that "the things both nations have 
in common are stronger." 
  Cuba is currently opening to the investment of foreign 
capital. That, he emphasized, is of great interest to Argentina 
and its businessmen. 
  Regarding Cuba's debt with Argentina, estimated at some $1 
billion, Robaina reiterated Havana's intention to "unfreeze" the 
topic and have experts from both countries begin talks in that 
regard. 
  Argentine Foreign Minister Di Tella called his meeting with 
Robaina positive, fruitful, and sincere, and added that topics 
of mutual interest were discussed in a respectful manner. 
  Robaina gave numerous interviews to major local and foreign 
media throughout the day.

  [Text] UN, 6 Apr (PL) -- Cuba, Antigua and Barbuda have 
agreed to establish diplomatic ties as of 6 April at the level 
of nonresident ambassadors. 
  Fernando Ramirez De Estenoz, first deputy foreign relations 
minister, and Lionel A. Hurst, Antigua and Barbuda permanent UN 
representative, signed the agreement on behalf of their 
respective governments in a solemn ceremony at the Cuban 
permanent mission at the UN. 
  In a brief speech after the exchange of the corresponding 
documents, Ramirez said that this event is a historical moment 
for the two countries. 
  He added that it was not a mere diplomatic ceremony, but a 
step forward for the Caribbean peoples. 
  He pointed out that his country expects to become part of 
the 
Caribbean commonwealth because of its blood, race, culture, 
geographic position, and traditions. Cuba is a Caribbean nation 
and gladly joins said community, he said. 
  Ramirez stressed that this agreement is a modest 
contribution 
toward the integration of the Caribbean people to ensure that 
collectively we will occupy the corresponding place in the 
international community. 
  Meanwhile, Ambassador Hurst emphasized the transformation 
process that began in Cuba in 1959 and its biggest achievements 
in the fields of sports, health, and education, and its steps to 
join the regional commonwealth. 
  He added that the current step will contribute to peace and 
the peoples' self-determination.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" article by Raimundo Lopez: "The Atypical Path </F>
Toward the Solution of Economic Difficulties"] 
  [Text] Havana -- Faced with the worst ever economic 
situation, the Cuban Government chose a somewhat unusual road to 
solve its woes. It simply placed the matter in the hands of 
those whom it usually affects the most in other nations. 
  Following this decision the so-called Parliaments in the 
Workplace became popular in Cuba. These are meetings among the 
workers in each workplace, summoned by the Cuban Workers 
Federation (CTC), to try and find solutions to the difficult 
domestic financial situation. 
  The system was launched last January and triggered an 
unusual 
process of consultation at the grass-roots level. More than 3 
million persons took place in the almost 80,000 meetings that 
took place all over the island, until last March. 
  CTC leader Pedro Ross explained that the meetings had the 
double purpose of finding ideas to increase the economic 
efficiency at each specific center, while seeking other more 
general solutions related to the national situation, as a whole. 
  Ross, responding to PRENSA LATINA, affirmed that the 
reaction 
to these meetings surpassed all expectations. This was so, 
first, "because of the insight shown in the worker's 
presentations about the solutions that should be implemented to 
enhance the domestic economy and clean up the financial system." 
  He added that another aspect, deemed to be highly positive, 
was the response to the summons. The meetings had an average of 
over 86-percent attendance of all union members. 
  The first study to determine the measures needed to face the 
nation's difficult situation was carried out last December at 
the National Assembly of the People's Government [ANPP]. There 
they decided to hold an extraordinary session to discuss only 
the country's financial situation. 
  The situation shows a current money surplus of more than 10 
billion pesos -- equivalent to the same amount in U.S. dollars 
at the current exchange rate -- a fiscal deficit of as much as 
4.2 billion [currency not specified], and substantial subsidies 
for several sectors. 
  These factors have negative effects on the Cuban economy, 
which is already suffering the sudden loss of its trade partners 
in the former Soviet Bloc in Eastern Europe and a tightening of 
the trade embargo the United States has maintained against Cuba 
for over three decades. 
  Local authorities maintain that neoliberal economic policies 
will never provide solutions for these problems. 
  A CTC report on the progress at the assemblies suggested 
that 
this process constitutes "a democratic exercise that quickly 
earned its place as a useful tool and a viable way for the 
people to participate in solving our vital economic problems." 
  The fact is that the meetings that took place at the more 
than 80,000 work centers gave all Cuban workers, from the most 
humble to the highest members, the opportunity to voice their 
opinions and possible solutions to the economic difficulties. 
  The decision originated from the principle expressed by 
President Fidel Castro that "without the understanding and 
disposition of the workers and the people, no problem would be 
solved and no measure would be any good." 
  The magnitude of the process was also highlighted by ANPP 
President Ricardo Alarcon in statements to PRENSA LATINA. 
  The workers parliaments -- Alarcon stated -- have served to 
jointly discuss possible general measures and for each worker to 
express their opinion and compared to others, in order to form a 
single plan. 
  He also indicated that the workers parliaments have 
encouraged the rise of a national consensus in relation to the 
critical measures to resist the situation, since "the solution 
to the economic difficulties is the entire nation's problem." 
  Financial reorganization and economic efficiency are not 
matters solely for a group of legislators, but a collective 
enterprise to be confronted by the entire nation, Alarcon 
emphasized. 
  In other words -- he added -- we must conceptualize a 
people's government as it really is, that is, it is not an 
isolated parliament above the rest of society, but a parliamnent 
inserted into society. 
  In this respect, Alarcon explained "we are legislating 
these issues from the moment every workers group meets to 
express their recommendations on this matter and, most of all, 
when they specifically agree on what to do at each work place 
and in cooperation with other enterprises." 
  From this perspective -- he pointed out -- it has been 
possible to identify and explain thousands of proposals, 
thousands of specific measures, many of which are already being 
put into practice, and are already being implemented. 
  Precisely, one of the CTC's first objectives is to find 
solutions to the proposals suggested by its members and linked 
to their respective work centers. 
  Felix Jimenez, director of La Corona tobacco factory, told 
PRENSA LATINA that as a result of implementing proposals 
suggested by the factory's employees, output objectives are 
being met by 146 percent. 
  He indicated that we are all trapped in a spider's web, and 
we are starting to shake ourselves out of it. We cannot let 
this die out. 
  Another example cited by TRABAJADORES weekly magazine, is 
that of an agriculture company located in the western Province 
of Matanzas, where the number of workers was cut from 1,135 in 
1993 to 217 in March 1994, a measure that enabled the company to 
save 105,000 pesos in wages. 
  Despite the cuts implemented, the company expects an 
increase 
in productivity and expects to ensure income producing levels. 
  With respect to discussions surrounding the national 
measures, these will be debated by the ANPP deputies on 1 May, 
international labor day. 
  Ross insisted that on this occasion all proposals made by 
the 
workers will be taken into considerations.

  [Text] Havana, 7 Apr (PL) -- Cuba reduced state subsidies 
to the agricultural sector by 50 percent from January to March 
this year, union leader Pedro Ross announced today when he read 
the decisions recently made by the Cuban Government. 
  The country spent 2.700 billion pesos, equal to the dollar, 
to subsidize this field in the sugar cane and non-sugar cane 
sectors that underwent transformations at the end of 1993, when 
state farms where converted to cooperatives. 
  During a news conference, the secretary general of the Cuban 
Workers Federation maintained that in the past quarter the 
tobacco sector surpassed its production goal in the manufacture 
of tobacco for export by 125 percent. Meanwhile, tourism grew 
by 30 percent. 
  Regarding the parliamentary debate on the reorganization of 
internal finances announced for 1 May, he indicated that the 
measures to be taken will be political and not technocratic. 
  Ross said that these decisions cannot be made behind the 
workers' backs given their affect on millions of people and the 
benefits and sacrifices that almost the entire nation will have 
to make. 
  He indicated that a great deal of suggestions were made 
during the more than 80,000 meetings recently held throughout 
the nation and in which more than 3 million workers participated. 
  Ross admitted there were different points of view and 
different criteria for some issues, but everything was taken 
into consideration during the labor union debates, called 
parliaments in the workplace. 
  The workers' meetings began to show results, according to 
Ross, when decisions were applied on efficient productivity and 
savings that have immediate effects on the economy. 
  For Ross, this is part of a group of measures implemented in 
the past months, such as the turnover of thousands of hectares 
of state-owned lands to workers for the organization of Basic 
Productive Cooperation Units. 
  The creation of such units was of the greatest political and 
social scope as it changes production and distribution 
relationships established since the triumph of the Revolution in 
1959 and which have benefited more than 1.1 million workers, he 
added.

  [Text] Havana, 8 Apr (PL) -- Carlos Lage, vice president of 
the Council of Ministers, admitted today that the current sugar 
harvest is facing difficult and tense moments, the reason for 
which it has been decided that the sugar grinding will be 
rescheduled during the month of May. 
  In statements to Cuban television, the member of the 
Communist Party of Cuba [PCC] Politburo commented on the delays 
in the production plans of several provinces. 
  Lage proceeded to cite the excessive humidity caused by 
heavy 
rains and the problems experienced in preparing the harvest as 
being the main reasons for the delay. 
  In expressing his confidence that they will be able to grind 
the quantity of sugar forecasted, Lage stressed that there is no 
indication of exhaustion among the sector's leaders and workers 
despite having been at work for more than 100 days. 
  During the past year, Cuba was only able to produce 4.2 
million tons of sugar, an amount considerably lower than the 7 
million tons the country was able to produce in previous years. 
  The sugar harvest will be rescheduled, a situation that had 
been forecasted by experts, as a result of the beginning of 
spring, a fall in productivity, and an increase in manufacturing 
and equipment breakdowns after more than three months of 
continuous activity at the agro-industrial installations. 
  Previously, Lage had indicated the economic need to grind 
the 
sugar as efficiently as possible and manufacture the entire 
sugar committed, without neglecting to plant and clean the 
thousands of hectares of land in preparation for next year's 
harvest.

  [Text] Havana, 8 Apr (PL)--Osmany Cienfuegos Gorriaran, 
vice president of the Cuban Council of Ministers, announced 
today that the Cuban tourism industry this month has undertaken 
a new system for making this activity more efficient and 
profitable. 
  He said that in the near future a Ministry of Tourism will 
be 
officially created to replace the existing National Institute of 
Tourism (INTUR). The ministry will have a more compact 
organization, with 50 or 60 people, and will not be affected by 
the administration. 
  Cienfuegos stated that the ministry will draft the country's 
policies on developing tourism, control the activities of 
existing or new tourism institutions, participate in 
price-drafting policies, and be tasked with initial training. 
  He said that as a result of INTUR's shutting down, three 
hotel chains have been created, each with 6,000 or 7,000 rooms: 
Gran Caribe, Horizonte, and Islazul. The first two will be 
primarily for international tourists and the third for local 
vacationers. 
  Gran Caribe will control four- and five-star installations 
and be led by Javier Ardizones, former Cuban ambassador to 
Italy. Another former diplomat, Jose Fernandez de Cosio (until 
recently Cuba's ambassador to Mexico), will head the Horizonte 
group, and INTUR Director Rafael Sed Perez will take over as 
Islazul director. 
  Likewise, Cienfuegos added, Marinas Puerto Sol has been 
created, the Cubatur tour company, plus the territorial 
recreation and tourism enterprises, which will operate under the 
name Rumbos. 
  These last ones will be tasked with increasing, organizing, 
promoting, and selling products from the areas where they 
operate and like the hotel chains or cruise lines, will operate 
under the principle of competition and efficiency. 
  In every case, he stressed, the newly created institutions 
will enter the market to compete with the product offered by the 
Cubanacan Corporation or the Gaviota Corporation tourist group 
-- both also subject to structural improvement processes, but to 
a lesser extent. 
  Asked about future mergers with foreign firms, Cienfuegos 
said that each enterprise will determine their particular needs. 
  Due to the old structure under which the tourism industry 
operated, lately there had been sale problems, Cienfuegos said, 
which resulted in fewer holiday makers than originally estimated. 
  Some of the figures were not as good as they should have 
been, Cienfuegos said, and added that Cuba received 560,000 
tourists during 1993. 
  Gross income increased 30 percent compared to 1993 [as 
published] and increased to $700-$720 million. During the 
current year this figure should increase similarly, Cienfuegos 
estimated. 
  He added that at any rate tourism will earn for the Cuban 
economy more than $1 billion in 1995, even if the actual number 
of tourists does not reach 1 million.

  [Text] Guadalajara, (Mexico), 11 Apr (EFE) -- The 35th 
Annual Assembly of the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) 
began on Monday in Guadalajara (Mexico) and focused on the need 
to foster social development in Latin America just hours after 
member countries agreed to increase the organization's capital. 
  In the opening ceremony, Mexican President Carlos Salinas de 
Gortari said that now that the structural adjustment programs 
are resulting in growth, there is a need to fight poverty and 
social inequality. 
  "We need to face the challenges common to all people, to 
wage 
a frontal assault on poverty to ensure growth and job creation, 
to build strong and lasting democracies, to protect and conserve 
our natural and cultural heritage, and to continue the 
unyielding fight against the criminal force of drug 
trafficking," Salinas said. 
  IDB President Enrique Iglesias, a Uruguayan, said that 
"economic growth and social integration are essential for 
political stability." He also warned against populist voices 
that affect social economic costs within society. 
  "The social costs of misadjustment and hyperinflation have 
been much higher than the inevitable adjustment processes. We 
see this now when we look at social investment deficits," 
Iglesias added. 
  Iglesias recalled a recent comment by Salinas de Gortari, 
who 
said that democracy is not only elections, because "people on 
the social fringes cannot effectively participate in politics. 
It is impossible to have full citizens' rights amid poverty and 
ignorance." 
  Iglesias added that history has taught us that 
"macroeconomic 
stability is absolutely necessary" to improving social 
conditions in Latin America. 
  "We need to redouble our efforts to continue modernizing and 
to bring stability. We also need to complete the great task 
that lies ahead," Iglesias said in reference to social support. 
  The IDB president highlighted the fact that Latin American 
countries are increasing their social sector budgets and he 
expressed satisfaction at the recent agreement reached by IDB 
member countries to increase the IDB's funds to $40 billion. 
  This agreement, which was reached a few hours before the 
assembly began, is a mandate so the IDB will increase by 50 
percent its credit fund for loans destined to the social sectors 
of Latin American and Caribbean countries. 
  This is going to allow us to earmark about $3.5 billion 
yearly for regional social development projects, compared to 
about $2 billion in 1993. 
  The agreement, in addition to increasing the IDB capital 
from 
$60 billion to $100 billion, includes the repayment of $1 
billion to the Special Operations Fund (FOE), IDB's "teller 
window" intended to grant very long-term financing at low 
interest rates to the region's poorest countries. 
  Projects financed by this "teller window" will fight 
poverty, 
mainly in countries like Bolivia, Nicaragua, Honduras, Haiti, 
and Guyana. 
  The National Assembly president, Mexican Finance Secretary 
Pedro Aspe, highlighted in the opening ceremony that the 
increase in capital will guarantee continued IDB loans at a rate 
of $7.5 billion a year. 
  Aspe said: "Once we achieve repayment, we have urgent, 
unpostponable tasks ahead; that is, to create jobs and to fight 
extreme poverty." 
  According to the IDB's annual report, there are 
approximately 
200 million Latin Americans living in poverty; in other words, 
46 percent of the population, which means a 2.5 percent increase 
compared to a year as recent as 1986.

<F P=106> [From the "Early Morning" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The meeting of Inter-American Development Bank [IDB] 
governors has begun in Guadalajara. They talked about economic 
growth and the fight against poverty as requirements for 
political stabilization and a more just society. Patricia 
Gutierrez has filed a report: 
  [Begin recording] [Gutierrez] As the 20th century comes to 
an 
end and as we approach the threshold of a new millennium, no 
country is immune to events that shape politics and economics at 
a world level. This is what President Carlos Salinas de Gortari 
said as he opened the IDB governors assembly. 
  [Salinas] As we look forward, we must start facing the 
challenges common to all nations: the head-on fight against 
poverty; a solution to the world dilemma of creating and 
ensuring employment; the construction of a strong and lasting 
democracy; the protection and preservation of our natural and 
cultural resources; and the endless fight against a criminal 
force--drug trafficking. 
  [Gutierrez] Before the 46 IDB governors and hundreds of 
representatives from financial institutions and governments of 
many nations, the Mexican head of state stressed his commitment 
to contributing to the creation of more just societies, more 
efficient economies, and stronger and more democratic 
institutions. 
  Pedro Aspe, finance and public credit secretary who also 
attended the meeting, said there are no deviations from the path 
the country has chosen to follow. He said: We believe 
investors will continue to have a long-term vision to ensure the 
viability and permanence of economic recovery. He maintained 
national unity prevailed during the painful, difficult, and 
unexpected situations Mexico experienced during the first few 
months of the year. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Jose Maria Monzon for NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS] </F>
  [Text] Buenos Aires, 8 Apr (NA) -- Carlos Menem's 
administration took advantage of the nearly unnoticed visit by 
Madeleine Albright, U.S. permanent representative before the 
United Nations, to once again raise one of the issues that 
worries the Argentine military the most; namely, NATO member 
countries' refusal to sell weapons and military hardware to our 
country. 
  During their talks with the U.S. diplomat, officials from 
the 
Defense and Foreign Ministries pointed out that it was totally 
incoherent that on the one hand the United Nations asks 
Argentine servicemen to participate in peacekeeping missions 
like those in Croatia and Bosnia, while at the same time 
Argentina is hampered from being able to reequip itself in a 
manner suitable to the dangers being faced in those places. 
  "If we are trustworthy enough to participate in such 
important missions as those in the former Yugoslavia, we should 
also be trusted with access to the latest generation 
conventional weapons," they underscored during the meetings with 
Albright, in which they did most of the talking. 
  The Argentine strategy seeks basically to undermine the 
United Kingdom's influence on its NATO partners, which is, in 
short, the root cause of the discrimination against our country 
concerning military materiel. 
  London so far maintains its ability to exert pressure on its 
partners in the Atlantic alliance nearly intact. Proof of this 
are the countless obstacles the Argentine Air Force has had to 
overcome to purchase the old Skyhawk planes. It is still not 
known whether the U.S. Government is willing to fit them with 
second generation tactical radars. 
  The Menem administration is interested -- as a priority 
issue 
-- in opening a breach in the embargo imposed following the 
Malvinas war, and feels it has made all the necessary gestures 
and efforts to that effect in the international arena. Sending 
ships to the Persian Gulf, participation in the blockade against 
Haiti, sending humanitarian aid to Somalia, and the deployment 
of more than 900 servicemen in the former Yugoslavia are 
concrete examples that Argentine officials intend to offer as 
proof of the country's faithfulness to the initiatives taken by 
Western countries within the UN Security Council. 
  The Argentine military's concern is not limited to the 
impossibility of having at their disposal the appropriate 
materiel for participating in peacekeeping missions. It also 
includes the imbalance which is indeed taking place in the 
region, as the Chilean Armed Forces have found a clear path to 
reequipping themselves. 
  With regard to this, Margaret Thatcher's recent visit to 
Santiago and the special interest the British showed in the 
military aeronautics fair held in Santiago caused uneasiness 
among the Argentine military, who believe that behind these 
gestures of rapprochement London is pursuing a strategy of 
pressure. 
  The Argentine Government has allegedly discussed its 
uneasiness with the new civilian authorities in Chile, and 
although they are not fostering this rapprochement with Great 
Britain, they seem unable to control their military's public 
relations. 
  Leaving this mistrust aside, what the Argentine Government 
is 
trying to do is to neutralize London's influence in the 
international scene. In order to achieve this, it is interested 
in becoming a permanent member of the UN Security Council. 
  The Argentine Government is aware that the United States is 
in favor of increasing the number of permanent members to 20, 
and intends that our country be taken into account when the 
latter are appointed. In any case, it remains to be seen what 
the United Kingdom's stance is on this aspiration. Actually, 
one should bear in mind that it still has enough clout with 
Washington to twist any important decision that has to do with 
Argentina.

  [Text] The agreement between the Energy Secretariat, headed 
by Carlos Bastos, and the National Commission for Atomic Energy 
[CNEA], headed by Manuel Mondino, materialized in a sort of 
legal document establishing the steps to be taken for the 
transformation of nuclear activities, particularly those having 
to do with the generation of electricity. The following is the 
text of this document, which constitutes an inarguable victory 
for the privatization drive pursued by the Economy Ministry: 
  "The CNEA needs streamlining and reorganizing to adapt to 
the 
(electricity) market. This demands splitting two large areas of 
activity -- namely the control and licensing of nuclear power 
plants, and production, research, and development activities -- 
into different organizations. 
  "For the former it would be possible to establish a unit 
that 
would come under the jurisdiction of the federal government, 
with resources from the National Treasury plus the fees or 
royalties that this unit would charge to companies subject to 
control. 
  "The other activities would be entrusted to one or more 
joint 
stock companies subject to commercial laws. In other words, 
they would act as individuals under private law, and would 
therefore be affected by the bankruptcy act. 
  "Initially, all the shares of these companies will belong to 
the state. 
  "The preceding paragraph means that the state will not 
contribute -- through the Treasury -- funds to finance any 
expenditures to be incurred by these companies. 
  "The Treasury will contribute the necessary funds to 
conclude 
the construction of the Atucha-2 power plant, according to a 
budget that will be put together in the future. 
  "The shares, which will initially be controlled by the 
state, 
will be sold to private investors on the stock exchange at a 
later stage (same procedure as YPF [Government Oil Deposits]). 
  "The expansion of the nuclear sector will be accomplished 
through private investments in new power plants. 
  "Once the unit responsible for the control of nuclear power 
plants is operational, current and future power plants will be 
subject to the same control provisions."

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 8 Apr (EFE) -- Cuban Foreign Minister 
Roberto Robaina and Argentine Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella 
both agreed and disagreed over the state of bilateral relations 
at the end of an unofficial meeting they held today in Buenos 
Aires. 
  Robaina, who arrived in Buenos Aires on a private visit of 
less than 24 hours, stressed that "agreement over our 
disagreements predominates" in relations between Cuba and 
Argentina. 
  Di Tella, who gave a separate news conference after the 
unscheduled meeting, indicated that "serious disagreements" 
still persist in the political area. 
  Witnesses to the meeting told EFE that during his 45-minute 
meeting with Robaina, Di Tella nevertheless promised to ask 
Argentine businessmen to explore the possibility of investing in 
Cuba in all the sectors that are open to foreign capital. 
  Robaina, who made a 5-day official visit to Uruguay, will 
travel within the next few hours to Bolivia, and will return on 
13 April to Buenos Aires to begin his programmed 48-hour 
official visit. 
  The total debt that Havana maintains with Buenos Aires can 
be 
highlighted among the disagreements. While Robaina states that 
"it does not amount to $1 billion," Di Tella maintains that it 
surpasses $1.2 billion. 
  Robaina insisted that his government "has the political 
desire" to pay this debt, within the context of the inviability 
of its overall debt throughout the world; that the outcome must 
be reached with "creative solutions" from the experts of the two 
countries; and that it is necessary for these to meet. 
  He also stressed that the present time "is a new time in the 
history of the relations" between the two countries, and that he 
believes that relations remain "firm and close despite the 
political disagreements" that have lasted since 1989, when 
Carlos Menem became president. 
  Di Tella again demanded "the beginning of a process of 
political transformation" in Cuba, and said that "it still can 
not be seen." 
  Di Tella told the reporters that the trade opening program 
that was expounded by Robaina is just a "sample." 
  Di Tella, who was in the company of Vice Foreign Minister 
Fernando Petrella and Central America and Caribbean Director 
Raul Martinez, met with Robaina in the Foreign Ministry. 
  Moreover, he admitted that in the future "there could be" 
Argentine businessmen who would be interested in investing in 
Cuba. 
  Robaina's "quick" visit -- people in his entourage indicated 
that he had to stop over in Buenos Aires due to flight 
connections -- allowed him to meet with Di Tella, because the 
Argentine foreign minister is off to Morocco on 13 April. 
  Sources close to Robaina consider the results of this first 
contact "positive", within the framework of the process that 
includes the signing of the cooperation agreement in the 
antidrug fight that was signed in Havana on 5 April, which could 
lead to the signing of an agreement regarding the mutual 
guaranteeing of investments.

<F P=106> ["Summary" of "exclusive" interview with Cuban Foreign </F>
Minister Roberto Robaina by Daniel Santoro, Carlos Arroyo, and 
Rogelio Garcia Lupa; in Buenos Aires on 8 April] 
  [Text] [CLARIN] Last year, [President Carlos] Menem said in 
Bahia Blanca that he was absolutely disgusted to be at the same 
summit as Castro. The latter stated that the Argentine 
president is an "opportunist" who aligned himself with the 
United States. Is there any possibility of their meeting in 
Cartagena [de Indias, Colombia]? 
  [Robaina] The presidents must decide that, and secondly, my 
country wants bilateral relations with Argentina to be above any 
argument. 
  [CLARIN] If Menem continues to demand what he terms "the 
democratization of Cuba," do you still want them to meet? 
  [Robaina] We really want to explain to him what we 
understand 
by democratization. We agree with their request that our country 
institute a multi-party system, but Cuba is a besieged 
stronghold (by the United States) and cannot afford to lose its 
unity. 
  [CLARIN] Brazilian trade unionist Lula da Silva has a good 
chance of winning the Brazilian presidential elections and the 
Grand Front may be successful at the polls in Buenos Aires City 
on 10 April. Are we seeing a resurgence of the left in Latin 
America? 
  [Robaina] Latin American peoples have an extremely complex 
economic reality which has helped the resurgence of the left in 
some Latin American countries. This goes to prove the extent to 
which they continue to believe that some (neoliberal) movements, 
currently in office, have not yet met their needs. 
  [CLARIN] Will your government grant refuge to [former 
Revolutionary People's Army leader Enrique] Gorriaran Melo, just 
as it granted asylum to Argentines who were persecuted by the 
military regime? 
  [Robaina] Cuba has relations with several leftist parties 
throughout Latin America, but it would be unwarrantable for the 
Cuban Government to undertake acts that may damage its relations 
with other countries. The times of Cuban relations with a left 
that was experiencing persecution and savagery are behind us now. 
  [CLARIN] With the election of Colombian President Cesar 
Gaviria as OAS secretary general, does Cuba believe the time has 
come for it to return to this forum? 
  [Robaina] That is not a matter of priority for us because we 
were expelled from that organization. Notwithstanding this, 
those already furthering that idea within the OAS should know 
that Cuba will not object. 
  [CLARIN] Will you invite anti-Castroist groups residing in 
Miami to the meeting of Cuban exiles to be held on 22 April in 
your country? 
  [Robaina] It will not be a meeting of groups. In any case, 
those who have not been invited are just hysterical individuals. 
  [CLARIN] Will the agenda include proposals like the one 
allowing elderly Cubans living abroad to spend their last few 
days in Cuba? 
  [Robaina] You are well informed (he laughs). One cannot say, 
however, that there is a closed agenda. 
  [CLARIN] Will the legalized use of dollars on the island 
lead 
to the establishment of a privileged social group -- one that 
has foreign currency? 
  [Robaina] No. The country is undergoing a process of 
economic transformation which entails the implementation of an 
open market policy for foreign capital, the liberalization of 
the job market, and the legalization of the use of a hard 
currency.... But this has an enormous political and social 
cost, which we assume because if we do not effect these changes 
the consequences will be even worse. 
  [CLARIN] It has been mentioned that you, a 37-year-old 
minister, might be Fidel's successor. Is that true? 
  [Robaina] Fidel himself brought up the subject in a very 
clear way -- he is not interest in staying in power for ever.... 
He is there because Cubans decided to give him that mandate.... 
Instead of looking for a successor, we should try to find a 
way, as Cubans, to collectively participate in the process.

[ANPP], gave the heroic deed banner to sugar workers of the 
Sierra de Cubitas Agroindustrial Complex in Ciego de Avila 
Province in recognition of their outstanding work. The sugar 
mill was ready to begin operations in just eight days after 
intense 18-hour work shifts. The repairs will allow the plant to 
overcome the delays of the present harvest. 
  Alarcon de Quesada also participated in the provincial 
analysis of the potato harvest, which will be completed within 
hours with the harvest of more than 150,000 quintals of tubers, 
despite plant disease infestations. 
  Ricardo Alarcon and Politburo member Julian Rizo Alvarez, 
first secretary of the party in Camaguey, praised combatants of 
the 1390 military unit, which became the most productive force 
in the current campaign with the collection of 40,000 quintals 
of potatoes. 
  [Begin Alarcon recording] In accomplishing this, you have 
carried out one of the orders of the commander in chief and the 
minister of the Revolutionary Armed Forces, which at the moment 
is a very important mission for all revolutionary combatants. In 
addition, you were able to lead our people because you have 
demonstrated the historic (?courage) of our glorious 
Revolutionary Armed Forces. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Commentary by Fernando Davalos: "Tourism in the Forefront" </F>
-- live] 
  [Text] A workshop for journalists and advertising people 
was held recently in Havana. In it, the new structure for the 
Cuban tourism sector was announced. When I say structure, I mean 
tourism's managerial system and its operational concepts. 
  Osmany Cienfuegos, vice president of the Council of 
Ministers, who has for years directed this strategic endeavor, 
explained the gradual functioning of this sector from now on -- 
specifically, from 1 April on. 
  I want to discuss the operational principles -- the ideas 
upon which these tourism enterprises are based: The highest 
quality hotels -- four- and five-star hotels -- are grouped in 
the Gran Caribe chain; three-star hotels belong to the Horizonte 
chain; and those for Cuban tourism to the Isla Azul chain. The 
interesting thing is that these chains are merely hotel chains. 
In other words, they are specialized in the operation of their 
hotels, and if they need rental cars, will contact Transtur; if 
supplies, Abatur; if advertising, Plublicitur; and so on. Thus, 
they can direct all their energies to manage the hotels without 
having to manage ancillary services, which on many occasions 
affect their profits and efficiency. 
  Every region, perhaps every province, on the basis of its 
tourism facilities, excluding hotels, will create a recreation 
and tourism enterprise to exploit every resource in the region 
for the entertainment of visitors: for example, restaurants, 
parks, fishing or hunting preserves, museums, theaters, et 
cetera. 
  Something I have yet to mention, although it is inferred, is 
that the new Cuban tourism structure will be guided by a new 
ministry. However, as Osmany Cienfuegos said: It will be a small 
ministry, perhaps 50 or 60 people, not responsible for the 
management of anything, but in charge of setting the pace to 
improve performance. 
  Cienfuegos stated that if, for example, it is necessary to 
have ministry representation in a province, it will consist of 
only three people: the delegate, a secretary, a driver, and 
nothing else because nothing else is needed to guide or set the 
pace. This has to be this way because if we minimize personnel 
at the root level -- the hotels and tourism services -- we are 
not then going to create a super ministry full of people. 
  Tourism, as Cuba's strategic front, remains thus in the 
forefront.

  [Text] On 12 April, Sugar Minister Nelson Torres stated 
that the remaining part of April is decisive for the sugarcane 
harvest and that we have to do everything possible, and more, to 
meet the production plan. He made this statement during a 
harvest emulation assessment over the last 10 days in the 
eastern provinces. Torres, who is also a member of the 
Politburo, added that the weather is helping; we therefore have 
to take advantage of it during the last 20 days of April and 
make the best effort in cutting and grinding with great 
efficiency.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Regarding Prices, Subsidies, and Economic </F>
Efficiency"] 
  [Text] The people's debates on efficiency and 
improving domestic finances will be over in just about a week. 
Now we can talk, without fear of error, of an ample number of 
proposals on which Cuban workers have reached consensus. 
  Some of these proposals concern price adjustments for 
specific products, like cigars and rum; they are primarily 
related to basic commodities for which coupon books are used for 
purchases. 
  For cigars, the formulas proposed have two basic variants: 
one favors eliminating all quotas, with the unrestricted sale of 
this product at a new price; and another advocates eliminating 
the additional quota (1.60), and keeping cigar prices 
unrestricted. 
  For rum, the majority of the people who expressed an opinion 
in the people's parliaments felt the price should be increased 
and it should be offered only on free sale. 
  These two items, which are not necessities, no matter how 
much many people do need them, have the potential to attract 
foreign currency in an amount that could reach 4 billion pesos a 
year, if Cuba were to ensure a sufficient production of both 
items so they could be sold without restrictions. 
  For essential goods which are now subsidized, the workers' 
meetings frequently suggested new prices that would at least 
cover production costs. 
  At the present time the subsidies included in these prices 
may be calculated at about 400 million pesos a year; the 1993 
budget deficit was 10 times larger. 
  This means that, financially speaking, the contribution that 
cigars and rum could make toward a healthy budget is much 
greater. The price adjustment for essential goods, assuming that 
it were applied to all subsidized items, would not be decisive, 
though it would make a significant contribution. 
  At this point, it is wise to emphasize one point in order to 
avoid misinterpretations of what we are saying. Consensus does 
not mean unanimity, and consensus approval does not mean there 
is no dissent on this or that aspect of a given issue. 
  This is also the right time to say that the existence of 
popular consensus on a broad group of possible measures does not 
mean they will definitely be applied immediately. It is the 
responsibility of the People's Government National Assembly and 
of other high-level government bodies to decide which are the 
most appropriate and possible measures, with what dynamism and 
intensity they should be applied, and how they should be 
implemented so that they will have an impact on the economy in a 
harmonious and interrelated manner, so they will become part of 
the system and not enter the financial universe in isolation. 
  But whether or not all the measures the workers have 
recommended on prices are adopted immediately is not the most 
important thing. The essential is that the problem of prices is 
beginning to become a part of our national economic awareness. 
  For years, partly because of lack of foresight and partly 
because the Cuban economy was integrated in an international 
trade system that was essentially fair and certain, the problem 
of prices, both domestic and foreign prices, was something that 
did not concern the population. 
  Just remember: the price of sugar in what was called the 
world market, an issue that had earlier obsessed our 
grandparents, was barely of interest to specialists. 
  For domestic prices, it was often true that we consumers 
paid 
for products without even bothering to find out the unit price 
of the items we were buying. 
  Now we are beginning to realize that we have to pay much 
more 
attention to economic laws if we are going to keep our economy a 
socialist economy. And we can understand that prices are a 
leading instrument for restructuring our economy that has been 
forced by circumstances to become a part of an external world 
that is absolutely driven by market laws. 
  No matter what measures may emerge from the next session of 
the People's Government National Assembly, it is extremely 
important for people to understand that when they buy a pound of 
black beans at the retail price, it costs the state 50 centavos, 
while the consumer buys it for 30. 
  Something similar takes place with almost all grains, dairy, 
and meat products, coffee, bread, fuels, and other items. Of 30 
essential household items, over 20 are subsidized by the state. 
  Here we are speaking of merchandise whose real costs could 
be 
estimated in freely convertible currency, as these items are 
mostly acquired abroad. In this world of prices, both the prices 
paid by the population and those used in the business economy, 
we need to become more aware and realize that everything we 
consume, everything we see around us that is produced by labor, 
in the end has a specific cost in convertible currency. 
  This will force us to make a much greater effort to increase 
the correlation between real costs and prices, while not 
overlooking the fact that in the future it will be virtually 
impossible to keep prices immobile, which was the normal 
practice during the last three decades. 
  But this does not mean we are advocating that this 
correlation in retail prices should be reached suddenly and 
automatically. Prices paid by the people in our socialist 
society will always be a means used to promote the just and 
equitable distribution of social production; this is not to be 
confused with egalitarianism. 
  The workers are asking that people whose incomes are too low 
for them to pay the regular prices be subsidized, in order to 
avoid having the state subsidize everyone in an egalitarian 
system. 
  Paradoxically, subsidized prices benefit both the money 
hoarder and the retiree, and both the idler and the model worker. 
  The workers want this to come to an end. They know this is a 
process. They know it will take time. They agree that sacrifices 
will have to be made, but they have confidence that, in prices 
as well as in other areas, we will achieve rationality and 
efficiency.

<F P=106> [First of a series of reports by journalist Carlos Santana </F>
Ojeda on unlicensed private taxi drivers in Havana; date not 
given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Santana] Beginning today, I would like to report on 
a journalistic research project that is intended to shed some 
light on the work of private drivers who provide services to 
tourists, especially at hotels. This situation is really 
alarming. Tourists usually would rather hire private taxis 
rather than licensed taxis. Why is this? Is the work done by one 
or the other more or less efficient? These are questions I 
intend to answer, one way or another, during the course of this 
research within the next few days. I want to begin by 
interviewing a private driver, one of those who are usually 
called pirates. 
  [Unidentified driver] No. I am a hired driver. 
  [Santana] A driver hired by whom? 
  [Driver] Hired by tourists staying in this hotel. 
  [Santana] And how can you do this forbidden work? 
  [Driver] Well, we know that many things are forbidden here; 
but we have to do it. 
  [Santana] How do you do this work? 
  [Driver] We wait for tourists who leave the hotel and are 
looking for a taxi to go somewhere in town. We propose the trip 
to them and they agree to hire us. 
  [Santana] What proposals do you make? Just the price? 
  [Driver] No. In addition to the price proposal, which is 
much 
lower than that of the taxi driver, we also propose a trip 
through town, to take them to special places. 
  [Santana] Do you establish fixed prices or do the prices 
vary? 
  [Driver] The price depends on where they want to go in the 
Havana downtown area. 
  [Santana] Are the prices low or high? 
  [Driver] Our prices are much lower than those of taxi 
drivers. 
  [Santana] And are you aware of the prices charged by the 
taxi 
drivers? 
  [Driver] Sure, we know the prices charged by taxi drivers. 
  [Santana] Are there many private drivers like you working in 
front of the hotels? 
  [Driver] There are a few of us. 
  [Santana] And you surely charge the tourists in dollars, 
because the tourists do not have Cuban pesos. What do you do 
with the dollars? 
  [Driver] I use the dollars to buy things that are not found 
in the market -- soap, oil, and other things not found in the 
(?state stores). 
  [Santana] Where do you buy those items you need? 
  [Driver] I buy them on the street, on the black market where 
they are much cheaper than in the state stores. 
  [Santana] Do you have children? 
  [Driver] Yes, I have three children. 
  [Santana] What do your children do? 
  [Driver] They study. They are still in school. 
  [Santana] What is your name? 
  [Driver] Well, you told me that this would be an interview 
without giving names. If I tell you my name, you might [words 
indistinct]. 
  [Santana] Where do you work and what is your profession? 
  [Driver] I am not going to tell you my name or where I work. 
But I am an engineer. 
  [Santana] And what would you prefer to be called: engineer 
or 
driver? 
  [Driver] For the time being, because of the work I am doing, 
I would rather be called a driver. 
  [Santana] These remarks by this private driver give you an 
idea of the nature of the work and how it affects the economy of 
taxi drivers. It is obvious that the currency they earn is 
outside the country's funds and therefore is not reinvested in 
social programs like health and education. Tomorrow, I will 
continue this work by discussing the subject from the point of 
view of the official taxi drivers, so we can draw our 
conclusions on the causes of this problem.

  [Excerpts] There is still no reaction from the Chamber of 
Deputies more than 24 hours after the vote on application of 
Article 149 of the Constitution by the Senate office led by 
Senator Bernard Sansaricq. Some deputies have begun to react to 
this proposal by the Senate. Edner Jean, after questioning some 
Haitian deputies on 11 April, filed this report: 
  [Begin Jean recording] First of all, the president of the 
Chamber of Deputies was in a stew on 11 April because the office 
of Bernard Sansaricq not only disregarded his warnings, but 
forced the parliamentary gates in order to hold their 
exceptional session on 10 April. In fact, it was by breaking 
into the parliament, blowing up the institution's lockers, that 
the 18 January elected senators were able to enter the 
Legislative Palace. After the session, in the euphoria of the 
moment and the satisfaction of an accomplished feat, they did 
not even take the time to close the doors behind them, leaving 
the parliament's premises open to the night. In response to 
this, President Monde was so angry that he could not stay in his 
office on 11 April. 
  We were able to make contact with the few deputies present 
in 
the Legislative Palace, and please understand that the 
legislators of the lower chamber have not budged one inch from 
their official position, meaning they simply reject any solution 
that does not take into account the interests of the various 
parties involved in the crisis. 
  National Front for Change and Democracy, FNCD, Deputy Serge 
Jean-Louis did not hesitate to say that the men Senator Bernard 
Sansaricq is leading are irresponsible men. [passage omitted] We 
learned from reliable sources that the BP-FNCD will, within the 
next few hours, publicly issue its common position on this 
decision. The same is true for the socialists, who have been in 
consultation since 11 April. Everything leads us to believe that 
those political blocs are simply going to renew their support 
for the parliamentary plan, as pointed out by Deputy Milou 
Laguerre, a veteran among the deputies, who confessed to Radio 
Metropole that he does not know much. [passage omitted] 
  The decision, unanimously reached by the office of Bernard 
Sansaricq, could, however, receive the support of some deputies. 
But there again, nothing is really relinquished to Bernard 
Sansaricq because those deputies seem to want to impose their 
own conditions. [passage omitted] 
  All things considered, the deputies might need to take a 
stand during their Tuesday session on this resolution proposed 
by the branch of the Senate led by Sen. Bernard Sansaricq. [end 
recording]

  [Text] The official text of the resolution voted in the 
Senate on 10 April was submitted to the House of Deputies today. 
The president of the lower chamber, Frantz Robert Monde, has 
some serious reservations on the resolution. According to Monde, 
this resolution does not have much chance of being ratified by 
the deputies' assembly. 
  [Begin recording] [Monde] "The reactions that I gathered 
from 
some deputies proved that they felt humiliated and indignant, 
frustrated with the behavior of some senators who treat them as 
children. They do not agree at all, and they even ask this 
morning, [word indistinct] of the Senate, saying that this 
building, which was built by Duvalier for the Chamber of 
Deputies, is a building that was lent to them to hold the 
sessions, and that the vile show that they offered us does not 
accommodate the good relations that should exist between 
senators and deputies. The wise ones did not give this example, 
but asked that we take the building back to be used as a 
committee room. 
  [Francois] "Do you think that it is a realistic plan? 
  [Monde] "In my humble opinion, what is the objective of 
these 
men?" These gentlemen want to have a new government, a new 
Dessalines; I do not even say a new Toussaint Louverture -- 
Toussaint was a very flexible man who played with the great 
powers; Dessalines said this is my country, and I am leading it. 
Do those men have the will to do it? Will they find this new 
Dessalines? Because my experience taught me that there is more 
than one trend [word indistinct]. There is a greater tendency to 
have ministers as friends. It is to occupy the realm of power. 
Thus, I have a big question mark. In any case, we are going to 
begin talking and see as soon as possible what to do so we can 
endow the country with a government. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] Within the scope of reactions to the 
implementation of Article 149 of the Constitution, the National 
Congress of Democratic Movements [CONACOM], one of the two rival 
branches of Haitian socialism, called on Haitians on 11 April to 
mobilize in order to prevent the implementation of Article 149 
of the Constitution. [passage omitted] Let us listen to the 
explanations of Dunois Eric Cantave, the person in charge of 
political affairs in CONACOM. 
  [Begin Cantave recording, in Creole] Personally, I will say 
that I understand them, but I do not agree with them. I 
understand them because everybody in the country is tired of the 
crisis. Everybody is tired of the status quo and the 
wait-and-see policy that prevails. The country's economy has 
gone to ruin. The middle classes are exhausted. Regarding the 
people, the most serious thing that can happen to them is 
repression, starvation, death through a lack of care. Everybody 
is fatigued. It is normal and it is [word indistinct] that 
citizens are proposing initiatives, but I do not agree with the 
methods they are using, methods using threats, and through which 
they violate a pact that was signed and which provided that 
those who were elected in the 18 January [1993] elections should 
step aside until the arbitration committee offers a verdict on 
their case. 
  I disagree especially because, as we in CONACOM always say, 
the solution must take into account first President Aristide and 
all those who were regularly elected in the country. Second, it 
must take into account the military institution that is the 
keeper of public order and which is also one of the protagonists 
in the crisis. Third, it must take into account what we call the 
international community, an unavoidable economic partner. [end 
recording] 
  The only consequence of such a strategy would be the 
exaggerated extension of the embargo that has had hard effects 
on the majority of the social body, while making a minority 
rich; and the prolongation of the logic of coup d'etat with all 
that that involves, such as threats against the national 
institutions, social frustrations, and repressions throughout 
the country, CONACOM says.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The implementation of Article 
149 of the Constitution does not have a future, according to 
Jean-Claude Martineau, spokesman for President Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide. Martineau said this is a return to the Nerette-Bazin 
method. Ever since the September 1991 coup d'etat, the country 
has been led only by General Raoul Cedras and [Lieutenant] 
Colonel Michel Francois, Martineau states: 
  [Begin Martineau recording, in Creole] This is not the first 
time men have tried to establish an unconstitutional government. 
They did it with Nerette and Honorat. Then they did it with 
Bazin. In fact, all these things are maneuvers, but everybody 
knows that the true head of the country is the Army. I (?see) 
those men bustling about; I do not know what they hope to 
achieve. In fact, [words indistinct]. It seems that in their 
minds, this Constitution has been shelved for a long time. So we 
will see -- if they succeed in setting up a government -- 
whether they have more power than Nerette, Honorat, or Bazin 
because we know that only Cedras and Michel Francois are 
governing. [end recording]

  [Text] After 30 months of crisis, the deadlock among the 
Haitian factions looks complete, while the list of victims of 
repression and of the embargo grows longer everyday. A 
hypothetical negotiated solution was further postponed by a vote 
on 10 April for implementation of Article 149 of the 
Constitution by one of the antagonistic blocs in the Senate. 
This Senate bloc is not acknowledged by the international 
community. The article they propose provides for the appointment 
of a provisional president and new general elections, which must 
result in the installation of a new president on 7 February 1995. 
  Washington has already warned that this kind of solution is 
not acceptable. The United States and the United Nations is 
still supporting a parliamentary compromise inspired by the 
Governors Island agreement and widely approved by the moderate 
deputies supporting President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, by the 
socialists, and the centrists. 
  President Aristide has rejected this plan. Despite 
parliamentary and diplomatic pressures, the Senate bloc 
acknowledged by the international community and presided over by 
Senator Firmin Jean-Louis, who is close to the 
president-in-exile, has so far not approved it, provoking a 
vacuum that is being exploited by the bloc of adversaries of the 
president headed by Sen. Bernard Sansaricq. The latter spoke of 
a letter from the military high command acknowledging him as 
legitimate president of the Senate. This document has so far not 
been made public. Neither has the Army taken an official stand 
on this parliamentary issue. Its chief, General Raoul Cedras, 
has always, since the beginning of the crisis, found a way out, 
allowing the military institution to save face and to preserve 
its unity. 
  While awaiting a solution in which fewer and fewer Haitians 
believe, the gruesome detailed accounts by victims of 
repression, partisans of Father Aristide, and victims of the 
international sanctions, are increasing daily. According to the 
latest figures, communicated to AFP by the international 
civilian mission in charge of ensuring that human rights are 
respected in the country, 111 cases of extrajudicial execution 
and suspicious death were recorded in Port-au-Prince between 
February and March. Six similar cases were already recorded 
between 1 and 10 April. 
  The mission has also denounced the existence of clandestine 
detention centers and cases of rape of a political nature. For 
the same period, the Haitian Platform of Human Rights 
[Plateforme Haitienne des Droits Humains], PHDH, which 
encompasses several organizations, has reported 162 people 
wounded by gunshot or beatings; 153 illegal arrests, and 297 
cases of illegal search or destruction of property belonging to 
individuals or organizations. The civilian mission and the PHDH 
accuse civilian police auxiliaries; members of the Revolutionary 
Front for the Promotion and Progress of Haiti, the main 
neo-Duvalierist formation, which has rejected these accusations; 
and the Armed Forces. 
  A doctor, who wishes to remain anonymous, told AFP that an 
average of 12 people are admitted to the Port-au-Prince general 
hospital with gunshot wounds (?per day), where the sanitary 
conditions, previously precarious, are now disastrous. Half of 
these survive surgical operations, according to this doctor. 
  The victims of the international commercial embargo, 
effective since October 1991 and intensified in 1993 by an oil 
embargo that has quickly affected the most deprived members of 
the least advanced country in the American hemisphere, have 
added to this assessment. The sanctions have created over 10,000 
victims within the most vulnerable groups, including women, 
children, the elderly, and the ill, according to independent 
religious and humanitarian organization officials who wish to 
remain anonymous. One of them, a priest working for 34 years in 
peasant circles, has denounced the tragic continuation of a 
collective punishment for the poorest of people, and the morally 
inadmissible use by the international community of the suffering 
and death of thousands of children for political ends.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>
  [Excerpts] Where is our hope? All Haitians who are lucky 
enough to still be alive today, who have not been shot down, and 
who have not been abducted by military or civilian police 
auxiliaries must know the fundamental reason our country is 
experiencing such a bad situation. What is now happening allows 
everyone to clearly see that the criminal 30 September 1991 coup 
d'etat was a master plot hatched by the imperialistic countries, 
especially the United States and the bourgeoisie under the 
command of the United States and its [word indistinct] Army, 
which is always there to make [words indistinct] execute to the 
letter all the orders of the United States. This is why nobody 
should be surprised at seeing the unscrupulous Army and numerous 
civilian police auxiliaries -- who are drug dealers, rapists, 
assassins, and thugs -- have fun pitilessly assassinating those 
who have decided for one reason or another to struggle against 
this criminal and repressive system. [passage omitted] 
  The coup d'etat has taught the people a big lesson: Today, 
the people know who are their friends and who are enemies, as 
well as who the hypocrites are. If the people's enemies have put 
them in a situation from which they cannot defend their freedom, 
their rights, and their lives today, it is not because they have 
resigned themselves. On the contrary, the people already know -- 
just like all other people on earth who are struggling for their 
liberation -- that in all battles, there are good moments and 
bad moments. Nobody will tell us that we are now experiencing 
bad moments. We see how many people, who pretend to side with 
us, have used those bad moments to harm us even further, to make 
us suffer more. But we promise them one thing: We have a good 
memory; we will never forget. The time has come for us to think 
about the struggle for liberation, the battle for the true 
democracy we need. [music by Manno Charlemagne] [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Luiz Alberto Weber] </F>
  [Text] During the government of General Ernesto Geisel 
(1974-1979) the "responsible pragmatism" of the Brazilian 
Foreign Ministry led Brazil to become one of the pioneers in 
recognizing the African socialist regimes of Angola, Mozambique, 
Guinea-Bissau, and Cape Verde. Brazil, as an emerging power, 
wanted to exert its influence over the Portuguese-speaking 
countries that had recently become independent from Portugal. 
Almost 20 years later, Itamaraty and a group of Brazilian 
businessmen are playing their cards on a South Africa governed 
by the African National Congress (ANC) of Nelson Mandela. But 
the priorities are different: There is no longer the idea of 
projecting Brazilian political influence, but rather that of 
doing good business. From 13 to 20 March, just over one month 
before the first South African elections in which the black 
population will vote, a delegation of 34 Brazilian businessmen 
headed by Celso Marcos Vieira, chief of the Trade Promotion 
Department of the Foreign Ministry, made a commercial visit to 
that country. The Brazilian companies were represented by large 
companies such as Andrade Gutierrez, Norberto Odebrecht, Mendes 
Junior, NEC of Brazil, Embraer [Brazilian Aeronautics Company], 
Varig Airline, Furnas [Furnas Electric Power Plants, Inc.], and 
Petrobras [Brazilian Petroleum Corporation]. Vieira said: "The 
time could have not been better: With this initiative we showed 
confidence in the South African electoral process." 
  The South African elections, which will put an end to 46 
years of white minority government, will be held on 26, 27, and 
28 April. Even with the growing political violence of the last 
few months, the inauguration of Nelson Mandela on 10 May is 
considered a sure thing by analysts, including those of 
Itamaraty. The Brazilian delegation got ahead of possible 
missions from Europe, the United States, and Japan. According 
to Otavio Cardoso Pontes, director-superintendent of 
Poliolefinas and one of the members of the Brazilian delegation, 
Brazilian businessmen see many possibilities for bilateral trade 
with South Africa, which is a country with a high level of 
consumption and a well-developed infrastructure. Mandela's 
representatives guaranteed the Brazilian businessmen that an 
eventual ANC government would not implement a policy promoting 
government intervention in the economy, as planned in the party 
program. 
  The Brazilians met with heads of the ANC economic 
departments 
and with representatives of five different sectors (including 
the National Federation of Africa Chamber of Commerce, which 
includes only black businessmen) interested in joint ventures 
and consultant services. The future for prospective Brazilian 
deals in South Africa lies in the reconstruction and development 
project that Mandela and his team have drafted. Vieira 
commented that "the ANC intends to build 1 million low cost 
houses and to expand its electricity supply system. There is 
lots of room for Brazilian companies in these areas." Mandela's 
supporters, moreover, are willing to review the energy policy 
implemented so far by the government. The ANC intends to 
minimize the African nuclear program which, it is believed, 
includes nuclear bombs. 
  The ANC leaders are also quite interested in the 
establishment of an economic bloc including Mercosur [Common 
Market of the South] -- Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay 
-- and South Africa, Angola, Mozambique, Tanzania, Zambia, and 
Botswana. According to Minister Vieira, Brazil regards South 
Africa as a doorway for the entry of Brazilian products into the 
African markets. He added: "They know how to negotiate with the 
region, and this could be useful to the Brazilian businessmen." 
  Although the ANC has asserted it does not have any 
nationalization program in mind, it has asked to consult 
Petrobras [Brazilian Petroleum Corporation] to determine whether 
or not it is feasible to maintain the state monopoly in the oil 
field. The Bank of Brazil has already opened credit lines with 
the purpose of promoting bilateral trade. But the Brazilians' 
visit to Mandela's country does not boil down to promises only. 
At least one deal worth $3 million has already been closed: 
The petrochemical industry Poliolefinas will buy raw material 
from a South African company to manufacture polyethylene. 
Minister Vieira exclaimed: "We have discovered South Africa." 
What remains to be seen is whether Mandela's virtual election 
will be enough to guarantee political stability in that country. 
After all, Brazil's initiatives in all the Portuguese-speaking 
African countries failed because they all were drowned by 
endless civil wars.

  [Text] The faction led by PT [Workers Party] presidential 
candidate Luis Inacio Lula da Silva emerged as the winner in the 
10th Sao Paulo State meeting that concluded yesterday in the 
city of Sao Paulo. Lula's Coordination/Unity 
[Articulacao/Unidade] faction obtained the largest number of 
votes among the Sao Paulo delegates, and managed to make its 
proposals prevail in the PT platform. Deputy Jose Dirceu, PT 
candidate for governor of Sao Paulo State, said: "The meeting 
showed that Lula's majority has prevailed." He added: "It is 
not true that Lula does not have the support of the majority 
within the PT." The vote outcome was, however, close. 
  The victory of Lula's faction over Time for Truth [Hora da 
Verdade], a more radical group, signifies that Lula's government 
plan will be more moderate. The PT decisions in Sao Paulo 
State, the stronghold of the party, will weigh heavily in the 
drafting of the final document, which is to be approved at a 
national PT meeting to be held from 29 April to 1 May. 
  For instance, on the subject of the foreign debt -- one of 
the most controversial topics in the PT program -- the Sao Paulo 
members decided to reject the proposal to immediately suspend 
payments and to support the PT executive board's original 
proposal, which is less radical on this point. 
  In the final document, the suspension of foreign debt 
payments may appear as a measure that could be adopted by the 
government after a detailed analysis of the debt. The PT 
proposal may also endorse open debt negotiations. 
  On the subject of privatization, Sao Paulo will also support 
the original document, which proposes the suspension of the 
privatization process and an assessment of those companies that 
have been privatized thus far. The PT delegates declined to 
support the idea of bringing back to the government fold those 
companies that had already been privatized. 
  In the opinion of Jose Dirceu, who attended the meeting, the 
main PT adversary in the 3 October elections will be the 
Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB). Dirceu said: "It will 
be Lula against Fernando Henrique Cardoso; and Jose Dirceu 
against Mario Covas in Sao Paulo." He noted that the opposition 
by Covas -- PSDB candidate for the Sao Paulo gubernatorial seat 
-- to the PSDB alliance with the Liberal Front Party [PFL] "is 
just a publicity stunt." He added: "In Sao Paulo, Covas is 
promoting an alliance with the Liberal Party and with the 
Brazilian Labor Party. Hence, he could not possibly claim that 
he is against the PSDB-PFL alliance." He said: "What the PSDB 
members want is to seize power; they do not care with whom."

  [Text] Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, presidential candidate 
for the Workers Party [PT], on 11 April promised Bishop Luciano 
Mendes de Almeida, chairman of the National Conference of 
Brazilian Bishops (CNBB), that two controversial proposals that 
irritated the church will be withdrawn from the PT government 
platform: the legalization of abortion and marriage between 
homosexuals. 
  Lula and Bishop Mendes de Almeida met in Sao Paulo at Lula's 
request. "I told Bishop Luciano that the final decision on this 
subject will be made at the national party convention, but I am 
sure, just like the rest of my party, that although these 
problems must be discussed by society, they must not be part of 
our government platform," Lula said. 
  Lula is thus attempting to eliminate the discomfort created 
in the relations with one of the PT's traditional allies -- the 
so-called progressive church. Lula has guaranteed Bishop Luciano 
that he is against abortion and that the PT's greatest concern 
is "the defense of the lives of millions of Brazilians who are 
alive and about to be born. Issues like these are not a 
priority in a country where millions of people are starving or 
unemployed. The priority is the distribution of wealth and the 
agricultural and employment policies." 
  Lula discussed with Bishop Mendes de Almeida the document 
"Brazil: Alternatives and Protagonists," which is an analysis of 
the current situation prepared by the CNBB for its annual 
meeting that will begin on 13 April in Itaici, Sao Paulo. "We 
will speak with all the presidential candidates because it is 
our duty as a church to bring suggestions to help solve the 
national crisis," Bishop Mendes de Almeida said. 
  He clearly established that the church expects the PT to 
reconsider its position regarding abortion and marriage between 
homosexuals. "The key, for us, is the defense of life," he said. 
"A fetus is defenseless and it is our duty to defend its 
rights." As for the document that will be discussed in Itaici, 
the CNBB chairman said: "We want a firmer stance by the 
democratic state, an economy centered on society, and the 
elimination of corruption in public administration."

  [Text] Brasilia, 7 Apr (EFE) -- Congressional sources today 
told EFE that the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies is investigating 
reports on the exchange of young prostitutes for cocaine on the 
Brazilian border with Bolivia. 
  A delegation of three deputies today went to investigate the 
charges raised by residents of Brazilian townships located in 
border areas with Bolivia in Mato Grosso, Acre, and Rondonia. 
  The deputies investigating the report are socialist Deputy 
Chico Vigilante and conservative Deputies Maria Valadin and 
Zelia Mendes, who serve on the Chamber special committee that 
investigates child prostitution. 
  According to the reports received by the committee, the 
minors are in the 11-16 age bracket -- although one was eight 
years old. They are exchanged for cocaine and taken to coca 
growing and producing areas in Bolivia as prostitutes for the 
men working there. 
  The delegation will hear testimonies of state and municipal 
officials and local residents. 
  Some witnesses told the congressmen that a presumably 
Brazilian couple is recruiting minors in the Amazon region, 
ostensibly to work as household servants in Sao Paulo, but these 
minors are taken to the border with Bolivia to be exchanged for 
cocaine. 
  The congressional committee, which started to work six 
months 
ago, will release its final report on 31 May. 
  Social democratic Deputy Moroni Torgan, who is a police 
officer and the rapporteur of this committee, was rather 
cautious about this case but did not rule out this type of crime.

  [Text] Rio de Janeiro -- The Rio de Janeiro district 
attorney will send the federal government files on the entrance 
of cocaine into Brazil through Paraguay in operations allegedly 
financed by the Rio de Janeiro illegal numbers lottery bankers. 
This is one of the main branches of the investigation that began 
after police busted into the fortress home of illegal lottery 
banker Castor de Andrade last week. Hundreds of names of 
individuals and organizations financed by the illegal lottery 
were found thanks to the investigation. 
  Illegal lottery banker Waldermiro Garcia, known as Miro, who 
is considered the richest of all the numbers lottery bankers, 
owns a casino in Ciudad del Este (Paraguayan city on the border 
with Foz de Iguazu). According to Paraguayan builders, nearly a 
year ago he invested $2 million just to refurbish his casino. 
  According to information obtained by Brazilian police that 
is 
in the District Attorney's Office's hands, 60 small, private 
airplanes fly daily from Paraguay into Brazil bringing drugs 
from Bolivia and Colombia. Most of the airplanes land in Sao 
Paulo State, from where the drugs are taken to Rio de Janeiro in 
small quantities. 
  The Rio de Janeiro district attorney will ask the government 
to carry out negotiations with the Paraguayan Government to 
further control the flights of small airplanes leaving for 
Brazil. The subject is being handled with total discretion 
because there are suspicions that Paraguayan Government 
officials may be involved in these operations. The 
investigations show that besides being used to bring cocaine, 
the airport [not further specified], which already has been 
closed once, also is used to receive smuggled weapons. 
<H8>  Reactions </H8>
  The day at the Rio de Janeiro District Attorney's Office was 
marked by reactions against the release of the list of names of 
people who received money from the illegal lottery scheme. 
  Rio District Attorney Antonio Carlos Biscaia, who today 
wanted to concentrate on analyzing the thousands of pages from 
the accounting books where the financial movements of the 
illegal lottery bankers are registered, was forced to receive 
politicians and lawyers protesting the manner in which the case 
was made public. 
<H8>  Files </H8>
  After decoding 166 diskettes confiscated from the home of 
Castor de Andrade, the prosecutors and computer experts 
investigating the corruption scheme operated in Rio de Janeiro 
by the illegal lottery on 8 April managed to enter the files of 
the illegal lottery's top bankers, and they believe they will 
obtain extraordinary revelations. Nonetheless, they are waiting 
for authorization from District Attorney Biscaia to reveal their 
findings. 
  The diskettes found in the safes of Castor de Andrade's 
fortress home that police broke into last week are being studied 
by experts from the District Attorney's Office and the Rio de 
Janeiro State Data Processing Center [Centro de Processamento de 
Dados -- Proderj]. The work being carried out at the Military 
Police Classified Services Office, at the institution's 
headquarters, were surrounded by mystery on 8 April. 
  According to Classified Services Commander (P2) Colonel 
Marcos Paz, some of the diskettes' contents already have been 
printed by the experts. The printed pages were taken to the 
District Attorney's Office. The experts did not want to give out 
any information about their work, saying the information on the 
results is being held at the District Attorney's Office.

  [Text] Police have learned how the illegal numbers lottery 
money is laundered. Another illegal lottery betting place was 
busted by police in Rio de Janeiro today. Police believe some 
betting places are changing their location as a result of the 
investigations. Police this morning confiscated this material as 
it was taken from the Cobacabana district to another southern 
Rio de Janeiro district. 
  Federal Police learned how the illegal lottery money 
laundering scheme works. It is done through the Acaray Casino in 
Ciudad del Este, Paraguay. One of the casino owners is illegal 
lottery banker Waldomiro Garcia, known as Miro, who uses the 
casino to justify a good portion of the illegal lottery money 
that is registered as profits from the casino. 
  The illegal lottery bankers also use the Uruguayan financial 
market to launder the money produced by other illegal 
businesses. This money circulates through Montevideo banks as if 
it were money from Uruguayan companies that make large 
investments in Punta del Este's real estate market. These are 
fictitious businesses that always render fantastic profits. 
  The money leaves Rio de Janeiro, goes to Paraguay, and then 
to Uruguay. From there, already converted into clean money, it 
is sent to fiscal paradises like Bahamas, Cayman, and Virgin 
Islands. In the end, the money circulates normally in the 
international financial market. 
  The illegal lottery bankers charge from 10 to 15 percent to 
facilitate the laundering of money both in Uruguay and Paraguay. 
After the money is laundered abroad through several financial 
method, the money returns to Brazil as foreign investments. It 
is as if I lend my money to myself through a foreign company, 
apply it in the Brazilian financial market, then repay the money 
to myself with interest, and then once again send it all abroad.

<F P=106> [Article by Rosa Costa and Diana Fernandes] </F>
  [Text] Brasilia -- At a meeting with Justice Minister 
Alexandre Dupeyrat and the government leaders in Congress, 
President Itamar Franco today will begin discussing the 
possibility of the federal government exploiting the numbers 
game. The government considers this to be "an emergency 
solution" to fight the widespread corruption system set up by 
the numbers game kingpins around betting places. According to 
Pedro Simon (Brazilian Democratic Movement Party-Rio Grande do 
Sul State), who is the government leader in the Senate, the 
inclusion of the numbers game on the list of crimes forced it to 
go underground and to generate a system of "related crimes," 
such as trafficking in drugs and arms and holdups of armored 
bank vans. 
  Minister Dupeyrat will propose at the meeting that the 
numbers game continue to be considered an illegal activity if it 
is exploited without the government's authorization. He claims 
that to simply legalize it -- as proposed by some -- would only 
benefit those offenders who now are facing charges because the 
courts would then have to dismiss all charges. Dupeyrat 
believes the problem may be solved by authorizing the Federal 
Savings Bank (CEF) or another government institution to exploit 
the game to compete with the illegal operators. 
  Dupeyrat said: "The numbers game is being exploited by 
criminals who are obtaining very high profits because they are 
withholding part of the prizes." He added: "If the game is 
exploited adequately and if higher prizes are distributed to 
bettors, the people will prefer the government-run game." 
Planalto Palace expects to learn today whether the CEF has the 
capability to include another betting game in its lottery system. 
  Sen. Simon believes, however, that a solution should start 
by 
excluding the numbers game from the list of crimes and by 
legalizing it. He wants it to become a legal activity that 
would be supervised by the government and would be liable for 
taxes. He said: "That would put an end to payments of bribes 
to policemen and government officials." He added: "It also 
would become much easier to fight the number of crimes 
surrounding betting places." Playing on Simon's side is the 
fact that he "legalized" the numbers game upon his inauguration 
as governor of Rio Grande do Sul as soon as he realized that 
one-third of police personnel in the state were officially 
assigned to fighting this crime, but that in reality they were 
only offering protection in exchange for kickbacks. 
  The proposal now being discussed by the government will 
block 
a Congress vote on a previous proposal that virtually reserves 
the market for the current numbers game operators. The bill, 
which already has been approved by the Constitution and Justice 
Committee, legalizes the numbers game and authorizes its current 
operators to continue to exploit it exclusively. The proposal, 
which was endorsed by the Rio de Janeiro kingpins, was sponsored 
by Deputy Paulo Almeida (Democratic Social Party-Rio de 
Janeiro), who is the president of the League of Samba Schools, 
Liesa.

  [Text] According to a survey by the Sao Paulo State 
Federation of Industries, 82 percent of industrial companies 
already have converted their prices into Real Value Units, 
URV's. The survey was delivered today to Finance Ministry 
special adviser Milton Dallari. The survey also shows that 
nearly 40 percent of commercial stores already have set their 
prices in URV's. 
  Dallari, who today met with nearly 200 businessmen in Sao 
Paulo, said the government will institute the real only when all 
prices have been converted into URV's. Commenting on the 
conversion of utility rates, Dallari said that only the 
conversion of electricity and telephone rates will require an 
implementation decree, which will not be issued until June. 
Other utility rates will be converted into URV's by May.

  [Text] In Morelos State on 10 April, Mexican President 
Carlos Salinas de Gortari presided over the 75th anniversary 
commemorating the death of southern caudillo Emiliano Zapata. 
  Thousands of peasants attended the commemoration. Salinas 
pledged to do more justice to the Mexican peasant sector and 
vowed to reverse the peasants' isolation and poverty. He said 
the ejido will be reinforced as the fundamental expression of 
social property in the country. 
  [Begin Salinas recording] We will do it, because Zapata's 
struggle is alive. Zapata lives and keeps fighting and demanding 
more justice, more respect, and more consideration for Mexican 
peasants. [end recording] 
  In Morelos, Zapata's birthplace, Salinas said changes to 
constitutional Article 27 meet the peasants' demand for legal 
ownership of their lands and freedom to work them. 
  [Begin Salinas recording] Large land owners will not 
reappear. They have already disappeared from our homeland's 
history. [end recording] 
  Salinas delivered checks for direct aid to peasants for the 
1993 to 1994 fall-winter crop cycle. Financial aid was 
delivered to 35,000 peasants throughout the country. Under the 
Prorural Areas Program, more than 100 million pesos have been 
doled out so far to assist 82,000 peasants. Salinas handed over 
ejido rights certificates and spoke about the agricultural 
sector's due loans, 70 percent of which will be refinanced with 
commercial banks. The president stressed the importance of 
these measures but admitted they are not enough. 
  [Begin Salinas recording] We must reverse the isolation and 
poverty we are still confronting in many rural areas. [end 
recording]

  [Text] In Tijuana, Baja California, Dr. Gustavo Salazar 
Fernandez, the legal medical expert who performed the autopsy on 
Luis Donaldo Colosio, said that the bullets that killed the 
former PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] presidential 
candidate were fired from different weapons. Gerardo Segura 
filed this report from Tijuana, Baja California: 
  [Segura] Two people may be implicated in the assassination 
of 
Luis Donaldo Colosio. According to reports disclosed by Federal 
Judicial Police agents present on the day of the murder, the 
bullet fired at the head of the PRI candidate was different from 
the one that hit the abdomen. They stated that the bullet in 
the skull destroyed a large amount of brain because it 
fragmented, contrary to the one in the abdomen, which did not 
seriously damage the internal organs. 
  The informants, who in light of the current events asked to 
remain anonymous, expressed their distrust in the official 
report. Given this situation, Dr. Gustavo Salazar Fernandez, 
legal medical expert, affirmed that the autopsy performed on 
Colosio did not establish whether one or two firearms were used 
for the attack. 
  [Begin Salazar recording] We recover projectiles left inside 
the body, if any, or state if there was fragmentation. It is 
impossible to retrieve them in each and every case. The autopsy 
report does not officially establish the caliber of the 
projectile. This is done by special request of a prosecutor or 
at a given time when the ballistic tests are performed. 
  From a strictly medical viewpoint, we try to be descriptive. 
[end recording] 
  [Segura] Salazar added, however, that it is possible that 
two different guns may have been used by two different 
perpetrators, but the exhumation and new inspections of the body 
would not provide sufficient evidence to confirm or support such 
hypotheses. 
  Informants of the Federal Judicial Police said that the 
second shot may have come from the person who dove at the feet 
of Luis Donaldo Colosio. Authorities are still searching for 
that person.

    [Editorial Report] Mexico City Radio ACIR Network in 
Spanish at 0000 GMT on 8 April broadcasts live, during its "ACIR 
Radio News" newscast, an interview with Diego Fernandez de 
Cevallos, presidential candidate of Mexico's National Action 
Party, PAN, by an unidentified interviewer. 
  After commenting on the preelection political campaign and 
the assassination of Institutional Revolutionary Party, PRI, 
presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio, Fernandez says 
should he win the elections, he would include members of other 
parties in his cabinet, "not only PAN members, not at all. I 
would have to firmly adhere to my ideas and appoint to the 
topmost positions of public administration individuals who 
belong to other parties or no party in particular. There are 
academicians, industrialists, ranchers, and peasants who could 
hold various positions in the government who are more 
knowledgeable than many politicians who would like to hold all 
the positions and pretend to be good for anything." He expresses 
disagreement with the PRI, whose members, he says, "seem to be 
so versatile that they are appointed to any position." 
  Asked about his party's economic platform, Fernandez says: 
"PAN's economic proposal is broad and firm. We admit several of 
the current government's macroeconomic measures have been 
positive. No one can deny restructuring the state's finances as 
well as reordering, reducing, and renegotiating Mexico's foreign 
debt, attempting to reduce inflation considerably, and trimming 
the government apparatus by selling many enterprises that should 
have never been purchased in the first place are positive." He 
says the government has polarized the country's economic life by 
making the rich richer and the rest poorer. PAN proposes, he 
says, "a social market economic system, which consists of 
prioritizing labor over capital. Labor must be protected, but 
it must be kept in mind that labor requires capital. A key 
issue is the millions of unemployed and underemployed in 
Mexico." Fernandez says permanent, well-paying jobs are 
required, which would be created through the creation of 
state-supported enterprises which would in turn "direct the 
economy, which supports those jobs. All this requires secure 
and productive investments. Another requirement is a legal 
guarantee investment protected by law. A third requirement is 
capital. Mexico does not have resources of its own to create 
enterprises and jobs," says Fernandez. 
  Resources must come from abroad, he adds. Mexico has failed 
in economic growth due to, he says, "the government's 
centralist, authoritarian policies. Mexico needs to create the 
necessary conditions for foreign capital investment on a 
long-term basis with sound infrastructure." 
  Fernandez, answering a caller's question on the low income 
of 
social security pensioners, says: "The parties have been 
discussing the issue, and PAN has proposed immediate measures to 
correct this situation." 
  The PAN candidate finally says he offers the Mexican people 
"a democratic alternative," and he invites all to participate 
"in an honest electoral campaign and clean elections."

<F P=106> [Article by Oscar Camacho Guzman] </F>
  [Text] The Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI] has 
conceded during a Permanent Commission meeting that Mexico still 
faces "very serious" economic problems. The PRI also believes 
that despite the "efforts" taken in past years, the fact that 7 
million Mexicans are unemployed is "alarming." 
  That statement was made during a brief debate held by the 
PRI 
faction with PRD [Party of the Democratic Revolution] 
legislators who have criticized the current administration's 
economic policy, the "forceful" conditions under which Mexico 
joined the Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development, and the $6-billion line of credit the United States 
opened for Mexico following Luis Donaldo Colosio's assassination. 
  PRD Deputy Alejandro Encinas opened the debate by saying the 
announcement of Mexico joining the OECD "seeks to convey an air 
of optimism despite the overwhelming evidence that shows our 
nation's economic and social decline." 
  Encinas said this air of optimism also seeks to "stop the 
drain of capital, both local and foreign, as a result of the 
news" of Colosio's slaying. 
  Encinas criticized President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's 
announcement that Mexico had been accepted into the OECD as a 
full-fledged member when the country will not be admitted until 
14 April, the date the OECD will issue its formal reply to the 
Mexican Government's petition. 
  Encinas said Mexico will have to make adjustments and 
changes 
in at least 38 economic fields including capital assets, 
services, the environment, foreign investment, agriculture, 
trade, and consumer protection policies, among others. He said, 
"Mexico is responsible, by joining the OECD, for consolidating a 
more thriving economy, which will lead to higher standards of 
living for Mexicans by incorporating the public into the job 
market, and, overall, for improving the economy." 
  He also said in order to join the OECD, a country must have 
a 
solvent market economy and a democratic government that respects 
human rights. 
  The PRD argues Mexico does not meet these conditions, and to 
illustrate the weakness of the current economic model, Encinas 
mentioned two incidents that followed Colosio's assassination. 
  First, he mentioned "to prevent the financial crack 
triggered 
by Colosio's slaying on 23 March, banks, exchange offices, and 
the stock market had to be closed to gain time and ask for 
foreign assistance." 
  Application of the "life-saving" mechanism, which consisted 
of the United States' establishing for Mexico a $6-billion line 
of credit, followed shortly after. 
  Thus, Encinas added, "the Clinton administration's financial 
rescue of the Salinas government and the announcement of 
Mexico's membership in the OECD correspond to Washington's basic 
interests of national security rather than to the efficient 
results of the economic policy, although, for the current 
government, they constitute a fundamental step in regaining 
foreign investors' trust." 
  "The risks of a financial crack or a devaluation of the 
Mexican peso would spread their harmful effects through the 
interdependence between the Mexican and U.S. economies, given 
the commitments assumed by U.S. intermediaries in international 
markets with the issuance of Mexican currency. It is worth 
noting that U.S. pension and investment funds have invested 
considerable resources in these financial instruments and would 
incur losses in case of an additional upheaval in Mexico." 
  Finally, he said "the economic slowdown negatively affects 
jobs, salaries, small- and medium-sized industries; the foreign 
debt has increased, and speculative activities in financial 
markets are becoming more volatile, threatening to reduce 
international monetary reserves and maintain artificially high 
interest rates, given the false value of the Mexican peso." 
  PRI member Javier Garduno Perez took the podium to respond 
to Encinas' statements. 
  Garduno said Encinas' arguments resembled "a soap opera 
script in which the most horrible scenarios are forecast for the 
Mexican economy" rather than a first-rate debate. 
  Garduno claimed that because he did not believe Encinas' 
arguments were serious enough, he was not going to refer to them. 
  Garduno said "I only want to say the PRI has never come to 
this forum to tell rose-tinted stories and has never come here 
with demagogy to manipulate distorted figures or use different 
scenarios and dates for comparison." 
  "We have always explained the economic situation is still 
unresolved, and that there are very serious problems, very 
serious. We have made substantial efforts in the past five years 
and have not established that an economic policy to achieve 
monetary stability is the main goal of the economic policy." 
  "We have said it is a means to achieve sustainable growth 
and 
to generate jobs, which are what we need at this time. 
Unemployment is the fundamental problem of this country and its 
economy. Job creation is one of the main issues the economic 
policy must carefully examine, because nearly 8 million Mexicans 
are jobless. This is alarming and concerns the PRI very much." 
  This is why he said that according to his party, efforts 
regarding economic policy must be heightened, especially in job 
creation, so that public funds can tackle social problems more 
efficiently and thus "deal a serious blow to the extreme poverty 
affecting millions of Mexicans." 
<H5>  To Reorganize Politics: Munoz Ledo </H5>
  During yesterday's session, PRD national leader Porfirio 
Munoz Ledo demanded the cycle "of impunity, violence, and 
suppression that has unfortunately pervaded national politics in 
the past years" be closed as soon as possible. Munoz also urged 
that dialogue as a means to advance toward a truly democratic 
state be strengthened. 
  In this sense, he called for the resumption of multiparty 
dialogue in order to resolve unsettled aspects of electoral 
reform, including the electoral register, the media, absentee 
votes, the immediate implementation of reforms in the Federal 
District, independent nominations, and a more flexible alliance 
system. Munoz said all these reforms will help clear up any 
doubts about the PRI's trying to impose its candidate in the 
coming presidential elections. 
  PRI member Carlos Jimenez Macias has told Munoz his party 
respects and approves the commitments to improve the democratic 
system that were signed on 27 January. 
  In this regard, Jimenez Macias said Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de 
Leon, the new PRI presidential candidate, upholds the political 
will to increase and deepen the political dialogue so that all 
Mexicans will be sure the 21 August elections will be a process 
based on total respect of the will of every citizen."

  [Text] There will be no 1994 fiscal deficit in Mexico 
despite the events in Chiapas and PRI [Institutional 
Revolutionary Party] candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio's 
assassination, said Finance Secretary Pedro Aspe Armella. He 
has said the country's economic recovery began in November 1993. 
  [Begin Aspe recording] The agreement was ratified in 
November. The economy had reached a deadlock in October, and we 
already had a negative 3-percent drop in industrial production. 
Ratification of the agreement took place in November, and 
industrial production rose to 0 percent that month. Recovery 
began in December, and figures for the industrial sector in 
December show a 4.1-percent increase. The change was truly 
dramatic. [end recording] 
  Secretary Aspe has said even though the events in Chiapas 
and 
Mr. Colosio's death were reflected in the financial market, a 
progressive adjustment has occurred, and this has allowed us to 
withstand the situation. He said all the country's sectors 
reasserted their pledge with ratification of the pact for 
stability, competitiveness, and employment to continue with a 
gradual 3-percent economic recovery, a 7-percent inflation rate, 
which is less than last year's inflation, and a zero fiscal 
deficit.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Mexican economic developments monitored through 12 
April. 
  The employment situation in Mexico is worsening. In 1993, 
unemployment or partial employment adversely affected 23 percent 
of the economically active population of 33.7 million. A report 
from the Bank of Mexico and other organizations indicates that 
in 1993 a total of 7.8 million people were unemployed or had 
part-time jobs. Jobs decreased between 1991 and 1993, and 
expectations for 1994 are grim. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in 
Spanish 5 April 94 pp 1, 24) 
  The National Banking Commission has reported that 3.1 
percent 
of total credits granted by the banking system, 13.6 billion new 
pesos, cannot be recovered. The figure is 198-percent higher 
than that registered in December 1992. (Mexico City UNOMASUNO 
in Spanish 5 April 94 p 16) 
  Mexican foreign debt grew 6.9 percent last year, reaching 
$105.7454 billion by the end of 1993. Banks and the private 
sector incurred debts with international financial institutions 
because they found it less expensive to seek financing in 
currencies other than the Mexican peso. International interest 
rates were three, four, and five times lower than local rates. 
(Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 5 April 94 p 3A) 
  Productive investment in the country will be weak in the 
short run because direct foreign investment has dropped to 14.7 
percent in 1993, down from 57 percent in 1990. Experts say 
foreign investment is stable; they do not expect sudden changes 
this year although political events could hinder the growth of 
foreign investment. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 6 
April 94 p 3A) 
  Emilio Lozoya Thalman, energy, mines, and parastate industry 
secretary, reported on 5 April that during 1993 the production 
of copper, zinc, iron, and coal rose to its highest level this 
century. Gold and silver production was the highest in four or 
five decades, he said. Lozoya said Mexican mining is 
consolidating itself as a promoter of regional development. 
(Mexico City UNOMASUNO in Spanish 6 April 94 p 19) 
  Mexican Petroleum, PEMEX, reports that 1993 was one of the 
worst years for the world's petrochemical industry. PEMEX 
Petrochemicals suffered revenue losses totalling $230 million. 
PEMEX management said the losses were due to falling 
international market prices. (Mexico City UNOMASUNO in Spanish 7 
April 94 p 20) 
  The national Consumer Price Index increased 0.5 percent in 
March, as compared to February, for an overall increase of 1.81 
percent during the first quarter of the year, the Bank of Mexico 
reported. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 0410 GMT 8 April 94) 
  PEMEX reported today that at least 58 oil fields have been 
located in the past five years, which is 80-percent higher than 
the previous five-year period. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 2051 GMT 9 
April 94) 
  Mexico has the second highest foreign debt in Latin America, 
second only to Brazil. The country's total foreign debt is 
$118.894 billion, according to an Inter-American Development 
Bank, IDB, report. The Mexican foreign debt has grown 26 
percent since 1989. The IDB report also indicates that the 
country's per capita GDP fell 1.2 percent in 1993 as compared to 
1992. (Mexico City UNOMASUNO in Spanish 11 April 94 pp 1, 18) 
  During the first quarter of 1994, the country's workers 
received salary increases of under 4 percent as compared to the 
same period last year, while wage increases stipulated in 
revised collective bargaining agreements only went up by less 
than 2 percent according to figures provided by the Metropolitan 
Association of Industrial Relations Executives. (Mexico City LA 
JORNADA in Spanish 11 April 94 p 22) 
  PEMEX confirmed today that it granted a contract to the 
Spanish company Mecanica de la Pena for the construction of a 
plant in Guanajuato for $22 million for gasoline quality control 
improvement. PEMEX said the company won the contract in a bid 
last week. The new plant will have the capacity to store up to 
3,440 barrels of gasoline per day. It will begin operations 
next year. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 2137 GMT 11 April 94)

  [Text] Chetumal, Mexico, 11 Apr (AFP) -- The spokesman for 
Quintana Roo State told AFP on Monday a boat adrift with 83 
Cubans on board, which had attempted to arrive in Miami 
(Florida), was rescued in Mexican waters and taken to Islas 
Mujeres. 
  The Cubans, 53 men, including three doctors, 16 children, 
and 
14 women, had sailed from Cuba on 6 April and stopped at (?Grand 
Cays) Island for food and fuel. 
  Nevertheless, once they sailed from the island, the boat (54 
meters long) developed a mechanical failure and went adrift 
until dawn Sunday when it entered Mexican waters. 
  On Monday the boat was towed to Islas Mujeres. The 83 Cubans 
will remain on board until immigration authorities decide what 
to do. 
  It is estimated this will take three days. During this time 
the Cubans will be held on board under detention and will not be 
allowed to go ashore.

<F P=106> [Message to the nation by President Ramiro De Leon Carpio in </F>
Guatemala City on 11 April -- live or recorded] 
  [Text] Dear Guatemalans: Accompanied by the government and 
national defense ministers, tonight I must announce to the 
Guatemalan people that public security is one of the country's 
main problems. Regardless of the solutions that may be found, it 
is necessary to guarantee full observance of the law and 
compliance with legal norms as fundamental principles in 
preserving the state of law. 
  I have therefore decided that the Government Ministry will 
have the support of the Defense Ministry in an effort to provide 
honest citizens with the security they have previously lacked so 
they can achieve their personal aspirations. I reaffirm the 
government's commitment to consolidate democracy and the state 
of law. I have ordered an immediate budget allocation for the 
civilian security forces that will allow them to readily acquire 
the necessary resources to fulfill their duty of safeguarding 
the lives, property, and interests of the Guatemalan people. 
  My government believes the security issue is critical. It is 
necessary for the Guatemalan people to support all initiatives 
to attain peace and security, especially by filing charges in a 
due and timely manner with the state's security organizations 
according to the procedure set forth by the Republic's laws. 
  It has never been so important for the people to regain 
their 
hopes of achieving real paths toward security. We must end the 
unfortunate tradition of police forces being incapable of 
resolving the problems that generate uncertainty and 
helplessness among citizens. 
  The current government is promoting these changes and it 
will 
not rest until they have been made. The authorities, however, 
cannot be left alone to achieve this national objective. All 
sectors must play their proper role. In this sense I want to ask 
for the media's cooperation to help us face this problem 
objectively by not listening to the sectors that are trying to 
destroy Guatemala's international image. It is also important to 
note, without trying to justify our current conditions, that 
another one of our unfortunate inheritances from previous 
administrations is the abandonment of the civilian security 
forces. Previous governments stripped them of vital resources 
and passively allowed their moral deterioration by condoning 
corruption. 
  I must also note a paradox. Now that we have a government 
that truly respects human rights, our opportunities to purchase 
equipment for the security forces have been limited abroad under 
the argument that the current government does not respect these 
human rights. That is obviously not true because we are 
frequently accused of being extremely tolerant and of not taking 
the severe actions that some would like. 
  To return to the central part of my message, which is the 
decision to have the national defense minister support the 
government minister in providing public security, I must inform 
the national and international public that such a decision will 
be carried out according to the objectives of the Guatemalan 
Army as established in Article 244 of our political 
Constitution, which are to preserve national peace and security. 
  Continuous evaluation and analysis of the results will 
provide the necessary criterion on which to base the decision, 
in an extreme case, to establish a state of emergency and 
enforce public order controls. Army participation in the 
security plan does not imply that the country will be placed 
under military control, as certain persons or groups might 
think. It simply means that the efforts of all the state's 
institutions are being brought together to provide maximum 
security for the people and their property. 
  The Army and the various police bodies will work with full 
force, but within the law, against those groups that have 
perpetrated acts of violence and created an atmosphere of 
insecurity and uncertainty among the population. The government 
has maintained full respect for the law and will continue its 
policy of absolute legality, but it will not hesitate to take 
drastic action against criminals. 
  In conclusion, I wish to express my horror at the recent 
attacks against U.S. citizens. Such acts are instigated by 
groups harboring individual interests and are part of an 
organized strategy to harm the good relations that fortunately 
exist between our two countries. As part of the new security 
plans, we will act with full force against the groups that are 
instigating this violence against U.S. citizens. As a part of 
its new public security plan, the Government of the Republic 
hereby reiterates its determination to implement whatever 
actions are necessary to safeguard the lives, safety, and 
property not only of Guatemalans but of the foreigners living 
among us or visiting us for business or pleasure. 
  I have said that I received a nation at war and that I hope 
to hand it over in peace. To do so, however, I need everyone's 
help. I ask you all to report any act against defenseless 
citizens, Guatemalans or otherwise, to the security authorities. 
In most cases there has not been such assistance. We are all 
responsible for security. We will enforce order with the law in 
our hands. No more anarchy. Thank you for your attention and 
good night.

  [Text] The latest events are deplorable, Vice President 
Arturo Herbruger has said when referring to the U.S. 
Government's warning to its citizens urging them not to visit 
our country. 
  He added: This is a deplorable situation, but, 
unfortunately, 
the events which occurred in San Cristobal, Alta Verapaz, are 
too terrible. This has caused shock in the United States. 
  Nevertheless, he has stated his optimism that the suspension 
will not last too long and that that country will lift it. 
  He has recognized this has had a negative effect on the 
arrival of foreign exchange. He has reasserted his belief the 
U.S. Government will soon suspend its recommendation. 
  He has said, however, this will be done provided Guatemala 
restores peace, which he believes is already being done, so that 
the United States will realize it involved isolated incidents.

  [Text] Defense Minister Mario Enriquez Morales said 
yesterday: "The Army is ready to go into the streets to support 
civilian security forces and to fight the wave of violence 
Guatemala is experiencing." 
  He made these statements during his speech to Congress and 
affirmed them as the special session concluded. He stressed this 
plan is part of the new project drafted by the government's 
security cabinet to face the current situation. 
  He added the military institution is constitutionally 
empowered to support civilian security forces by using its 
47,000 agents; we must follow President Ramiro de Leon Carpio's 
instructions, because we are part of the executive branch, he 
said. 
  Government Minister Danilo Parinello Blanco also talked 
about 
the joint project, which could become effective in the next few 
hours. He added the security cabinet has planned the creation of 
assault, elite, and investigative police units. 
  The first police unit will initially have 300 men and 600 
men 
after 90 days, while 200 men will be assigned to the elite 
police unit. The investigative police unit will have military 
support. All these plans will be implemented despite the 
Government Ministry's current economic status. 
<H5>  Deficiencies </H5>
  At the deputies' insistence, Parinello Blanco said his 
institution, especially the National Police (PN), has a number 
of deficiencies. Among the shortcomings, he mentioned the lack 
of economic resources and technology and the shortage in staff 
to work in all the regions. 
  The official cited the fact that 1,027 agents are at the 
service of diplomatic institutions and individuals. He added a 
policeman must buy his uniform and shoes, and should he use his 
weapon he must use his 750-quetzal salary to buy ammunition. 
  Among the projects to be implemented, he said there is the 
possibility of establishing an emergency telephone number, 
similar to the U.S. 911 emergency phone number. 
<H5>  Historical Plenary Session </H5>
  Deputies interrogated the two officials at a historic 
plenary 
session. The main topics addressed were the murders of Jorge 
Carpio Nicolle and Constitutionality Court President Epaminondas 
Gonzalez, as well as the recent attack on Legislator Obdulio 
Chinchilla Vega and other violent actions throughout many 
regions. 
<H5>  Fernandez's Testimony </H5>
  Colonel Jose Fernandez Ligorria, chief of staff of the 
Defense Ministry, testified yesterday he has no links with the 
Chinchilla attack; on the contrary, he learned of the anonymous 
letter on 5 April and offered the deputy protection.

  [Text] A large number of rebels has accepted amnesty after 
signing the Overall Human Rights Agreement, and they are now 
under the military corps' protection to prevent a possible 
attack by subversive factions. 
  The statement was given by Army Spokeswoman Berta Edith 
Vargas de Marroquin, who did not provide additional information 
on the number or identity of the rebels who sought amnesty or 
their current whereabouts. 
  She has said the number of URNG [Guatemalan National 
Revolutionary Unity] members to be demobilized in September will 
be less given the events that have resulted from the latest 
agreements signed in Mexico. 
  They accept the amnesty's legal norms, and the Army is 
implementing a special protection plan so they will not be 
attacked after deciding to become part of our society, she has 
added. 
  The spokesperson has also said the former fighters were 
members of various guerrilla factions, and they have approached 
military zone facilities located in different departments of the 
country; she added they have provided important information on 
their activities. 
  Marroquin has said: From the military viewpoint, the recent 
signing of an agreement, which included the United Nations' 
international verification, has made them reconsider their 
actions, and the Army is happy about this, because it results in 
fewer attacks on society. 
  The spokesperson also mentioned the URNG's charges that 
soldiers executed a peasant in the village of Santo Domingo, 
Sayaxche, Peten Department. She categorically denied this, 
saying it involved a military clash that occurred on 3 April in 
that same place. 
  She has said a unit from the 21st Military Zone in Coban, 
Alta Verapaz, clashed with 10 terrorists at 1300 that day. A 
subversive was injured in the clash, and he jumped into the 
river, leaving behind his weapon, an AR-15 rifle. 
  The Army spokesperson has said she did not know the name of 
the man who died in Santo Domingo, but she said he had a bullet 
wound and later drowned. She has said the military is prepared 
to organize a trip to the place so the media can talk with local 
residents and confirm the truth. 
  Referring to Peten, Marroquin has said the Army is still 
concerned about the safety of Guatemalans whom the Belizean 
authorities have asked to vacate the areas where they settled 
along the border. She has said the Armed Forces are ready to act 
in accordance with the situation.

<F P=106> [From the "This Morning" newscast] </F>
  [Text] President Violeta Chamorro disclosed yesterday upon 
returning from her official visit to Mexico that the two 
countries will sign a free trade agreement this year. 
  The Nicaraguan president said that her trip to Mexico and 
her 
working meetings with both public and private sectors had been 
productive. 
  [Begin Chamorro recording, in progress] ... with President 
Carlos Salinas de Gortari the signing of a free trade agreement. 
We think it will probably be signed before the end of the year. 
We also discussed [words indistinct] issues related to the debt 
inherited from the Sandinists, the previous administration, ten 
years ago. We agreed that both countries' finance ministers 
should search for a viable solution for us to be able to repay 
that debt, most likely with Nicaraguan assets. In spite of 
that, Mexico will open a $10-million line of credit for us 
through private commercial banks. 
  We also discussed the meat problem, which we hope will be 
resolved within the Nicaraguan-Mexican free trade agreement that 
we expect to sign this year. We expect all sectors to benefit 
from the agreement because it will boost our economy and exports 
to Mexico. 
  In terms of social programs, we also discussed issues 
related 
to the continuation of a solidarity program with Mexico. 
Regarding my administration's social programs, we hope to 
continue with an exchange of technical expertise. We also 
signed a health and social welfare cooperation agreement with 
the Mexican Health Secretariat and the Mexican Social Security 
Institute. That means special attention will be given to the 
many services provided by [Nicaraguan] social security to its 
affiliates. 
  I also had the opportunity to meet with Mexican businessmen 
during a breakfast engagement. I was accompanied by my 
ministers and four Nicaraguan business representatives. This 
gave us the opportunity to exchange opinions and invite everyone 
to visit Nicaragua to check out its investments opportunities. 
The Nicaraguan business sector representatives who accompanied 
me during the breakfast were Mr. Alberto Chamorro, president of 
the Nicaraguan Chamber of Industries; Mr. Roberto Teran, 
president of the Chamber of Commerce; Mr. Juan Chimilino, vice 
president of the National Union of Farmers and Cattlemen; and 
Gerardo Segura, president of [word indistinct]. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Carlos Torres, Radio Corporacion chief editor, </F>
from the CIAV-OAS in Managua -- live or recorded] 
  [Text] A few minutes ago, Jose Angel Talavera, a.k.a. 
Chacal, head of the 380 Northern Front [FN-380], granted an 
exclusive interview with Radio Corporacion. He discussed a 
report, disseminated by some media, that Honduran troops had 
been dispatched to the Nicaraguan border. Chacal denied that 
the Honduran troops had been deployed because of the presence of 
the FN-380 and explained that the Honduran troops had been 
mobilized to check the actions of criminal gangs on Honduran 
territory. This movement is unrelated to FN-380 troops. 
  Talavera also told us that the negotiations initiated this 
morning to discuss the problem of land ownership will resume in 
a few minutes. 
  Here are some of Talavera's remarks. 
  [Begin recording] [Talavera] We have no reports that this 
mobilization has anything to do with FN-380. We do know that 
troops have been dispatched to the northern border with 
Nicaragua to try to counter a crime wave in the area. But this 
mobilization has nothing to do with FN-380. The media that 
reported on this mobilization have been manipulating the reports. 
  FN-380 troops are stationed in various places, the location 
of which has been negotiated with the government and the Army, 
in the area of Quilali and Jicaro. Most of our troops are 
gathered on the outskirts of Quilali, Nueva Segovia. 
  We do not rule out the truth of reports on a crime wave in 
Honduras. There are always armed men who infiltrate, but in 
this particular instance there are armed bands that do not 
belong to FN-380. Consequently, reports in the Nicaraguan media 
are not objective and are rather hampering the negotiations, for 
which we cannot be held responsible. 
  Just as there are criminal gangs on the border with 
Honduras, 
so there are in the center of Nicaragua. They might be either 
Nicaraguans or Hondurans. Anyway, these gangs have nothing to 
do with our organization. Such activities contravene our 
principles. We have always opposed and fought crime. We are 
responsible and honest people, intent on helping the Nicaraguan 
people and society. Therefore, we reiterate that these actions 
have nothing to do with us. [end recording] 
  Regarding the situation in Jinotega, where the Sandinist 
National Liberation Front opposes the Nicaraguan Government's 
plan to fill National Police positions with members of the 
FN-380, Talavera said the National Assembly's government 
commission, headed by Andres Robles, has already solved this 
problem and that commisison members will continue to talk during 
a meeting set to open in a few minutes. 
  Talavera also said that the Nicaraguan Government has made 
good on its promises on education by appointing a number of 
teachers in rural areas of the country's north, where before 
there were only few teachers. 
  In health care, the Nicaraguan Government has also been 
complying with the agreements signed by the FN-380 and the 
government. 
  A meeting will open in a few minutes that will end for good 
the demobilization of members of the FN-380. Talavera said the 
meeting will be attended by CIAV [International Commission for 
Support and Verification] Director General Celso Caramagna, as 
well as by government, INRA [National Agrarian Reform 
Institute], FN-380, Finance Ministry, and National Development 
Bank delegates. The latter will be present because the FN-380 
seeks financing for the land they are demanding from the 
government.

<F P=106> [Report by Erving Sanchez Rizo] </F>
  [Text] The government is, in practice, putting the 
administration of the country's economy into the hands of the 
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, thereby 
losing sovereignty in its decisionmaking ability, even in such 
areas as education and law. 
  This is not only demonstrated by the government's acceptance 
of the so-called Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF), 
which is a formula imposed by multilateral organizations, but 
also by the acceptance to reduce the state payroll by dismissing 
13,500 employees and appointing supervisors in the programs of 
tax administration and public investment. 
  As part of the measures to be implemented in the so-called 
Macroeconomic and Structural Adjustment Policy, the government 
is calling for a series of measures that will affect not only 
thousands of public employees but the entire population. 
<H5>  Voluntary Mobility Program </H5>
  In terms of fiscal policy, the government is determined to 
reduce the size of the public sector by firing, through the 
so-called "voluntary mobility program," 7,000 employees in 1994, 
5,000 in 1995, and 13,500 in 1996. 
  This decision in reality will only affect sectors where 
state 
jobs will be "voluntarily guided." The ensuing effects of this 
decision will fall, however, also on the families of the 
dismissed state workers, businesses that will see their sales 
reduced, and even maids, who will lose their jobs after their 
employers get fired. 
  Although there are very few exemptions on indirect taxes, 
the 
government is determined to eliminate such exemptions, while 
adopting a mechanism to increase the price of fuel monthly in 
relation to the U.S. dollar. 
<H5>  Fuel Indexed and 6 Percent Eliminated </H5>
  The decision to index the price of fuel to the U.S. dollar 
will result in an immediate increase in the price of consumer 
products as well as in the price of raw materials and tools as a 
result of higher monthly costs in transportation. In addition, 
the price of energy will gradually increase. 
  The ESAF also establishes fees for such services as health 
and education as well as elimination of the law earmarking 6 
percent of the national budget for national universities. This 
may have serious repercussions on the training of personnel the 
country needs for its development. 
<H5>  Customs and Revenues Under the IMF </H5>
  A very serious aspect of the ESAF is that the government is 
willing to place under IMF supervision both the tax 
administration program and the revision of the Public Investment 
Program with the World Bank before the country's spending plan 
is presented. 
  With that decision and the meddling of the two multilateral 
world organizations, the government will in turn lose its 
ability to freely decide on its annual budget for revenue and 
expenditures. 
<H5>  No Small- and Medium-Sized Production </H5>
  In another of its recommendations, the ESAF proposes to keep 
the financial sector free from guided credit policies. This 
decision will deflate the hopes of small- and medium-sized 
producers of access to special credit to implement development 
programs. 
  With regard to the Banades and Banic banks, a continued 
restructuring and reduction of operating expenses is envisioned, 
which has normally translated into a reduction of employees. In 
addition, capitalization of these state-owned financial entities 
is rejected. 
<H5>  ESAF Eliminates Restrictions on Payments Abroad </H5>
  In this aspect, which shows the IMF's true nature as a debt 
collector, the organization is proposing the elimination of all 
restrictions on payments for current international transactions 
and is calling for a reduction in importation taxes. A positive 
aspect of the ESAF is that it creates a mechanism to encourage 
exports. 
  One aspect of macroeconomic policy is a draft bill to 
privatize Telcor [Nicaraguan Telecommunications and Postal 
Services Institute] by using indemnity bonuses. It also 
recommends the liquidation or sale of 38 businesses still 
remaining at Cornap [National Corporations of the Public 
Sector], among which are mining and energy companies. It also 
calls for the "restructuring of ports." 
  As part of this point, the ESAF also deprives the government 
of its ability to control or interfere in market prices at any 
given moment. Some of the few positive aspects include the 
proposed administrative and legal framework to consolidate 
rights with regard to agrarian property and the preparation of 
environmental regulations. 
<H5>  6 Percent for Universities in Danger </H5>
  Regarding education, the ESAF proposes giving priority to 
elementary school education, reducing subsidies on high school 
and higher education. This will in fact result in a possible 
reduction in student enrollments at state-owned high schools or 
universities. 
  This last proposal is linked to the project to eliminate the 
law which gives 6 percent of the budget to state-owned 
universities, for which the student movement fought so hard. 
Although this has not come true yet, there is a danger of 
eliminating this right. 
  Finally, in one of the most dangerous decisions for workers, 
behind the decision to revise the Labor Code to facilitate the 
functioning of the labor market lies the possibility that 
private sector or state employees may be dismissed at any 
minute, and temporary job contracts will prevail.

<F P=106> [From the "RPC Television News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] President Guillermo Endara has announced that on 18 
April he will disclose a decision he has made, a decision which 
will generate controversy and prompt criticism against him. 
  The president has warned the statements he is planning to 
make on a television network broadcast on 18 April will shock 
the Panamanian community. He has said the mere thought of it 
makes him ill. 
  [Begin Endara recording] The only reason I am ill is due to 
the worry this decision has caused me. This decision is that 
I.... [pauses] I have made a very difficult decision, and it may 
be very controversial. I will speak on a national network on 18 
April at 1900. At that time you will know why I am ill. You 
will have to wait until 18 April to know. [end recording] 
  The president made the announcement during inauguration of a 
bridge that links the so-called old section of the Free Zone 
with the France Field warehouses in Colon Province. [The 
announcement is] prompting speculation of a possible 
resignation, because the president said repeatedly over the past 
few days that his feet are itching to leave the Palace of the 
Herons. 
  [Begin recording] [Endara] In reality it has nothing to do 
with that other foot disease. It has nothing to do with the 
feet. This is a disease of the head and heart. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Is it a political decision, Mr. 
President? 
  [Endara] It is definitely political, but it is my duty. It 
will be very controversial, and I will be widely criticized, but 
it is my duty. [end recording] 
  Despite reporters' persistent questions, Endara declined to 
provide any details regarding the statements he will make on 18 
April at 1900, and he appealed for patience until then.

<F P=106> [Report by Ibeth Vega] </F>
  [Text] The National Assembly's Narcotics Commission 
yesterday approved a draft law establishing stiffer penalties 
for drug-related crimes and updating the type of activities 
considered to be money laundering. 
  The Commission unanimously approved the draft and passed it 
on to the Assembly plenum for its second debate as an emergency 
bill. 
  The bill defines the strategy for fighting the production, 
consumption, and trafficking of drugs, money laundering, 
possession of goods and assets obtained from drug trafficking, 
and related crimes. 
  The document is a combination of proposals presented by 
Legislator Leo Gonzalez and Acting Attorney General Jorge Ramon 
Valdes. It also includes recommendations made by the UN 
International Narcotics Convention held in 1988 in Vienna. 
  The draft improves the current description and adds several 
types of criminal activities to the list, including covert 
operations and controlled deliveries.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Panamanian economic developments monitored through 12 
April. 
  Delia Cardenas, planning and economic policy minister, has 
reported the government has managed to sell 90 percent of 
treasury bonds worth $452 million it issued in 1993. The 
revenue was used to pay part of the national debt. The 
Comptroller General's Office has listed the debt, as of 31 
December 1993, at $7.2 billion, of which 27 percent is domestic, 
53 percent is foreign, and 21 percent is interest and expenses. 
(Panama City EL PANAMA AMERICA in Spanish 6 April 94, p 8E) 
  The Panamanian Exporters Association, Apex, and the 
Association of Panamanian Industrialists, Sip, have reported 
that 1993 exports of manufactured goods totaled $58.3 million, a 
figure considerably lower than the $102.8 million of 1992. 
Although certain exports, such as chemicals, increased as much 
as 69 percent, prices dropped by 9 percent. Competition, 
particularly in the Central American market, forced prices down, 
while production costs tended to grow. (Panama City EL PANAMA 
AMERICA in Spanish 6 April 94, p 8E) 
  The consumer price index dropped .1 percent during the first 
two months of 1994. The drop was mainly due to a .3-percent 
drop in food and beverages and a 5.4-percent drop in fruits and 
vegetables. February showed an increase of 1.1 percent as a 
result of a 5.5-percent increase in transportation and 
communication costs. Compared to the same period in 1993, there 
was an increase of 1.2 percent. (Panama City LA PRENSA in 
Spanish 8 April 94, p 11A) 
  Apex President Juan Alberto Pascual has called on the 
government to "implement a more aggressive export policy," as 
industry is still faltering in the face of growing competition 
and higher production costs. "As long as these factors exist, 
the country will never be competitive on the international 
market," he has said. Meanwhile, Economist Rogelio Alvarado, 
from the Sip, has said exports have been steadily slipping for 
some time now, "mostly due to restrictions imposed by the 
European Union in July 1993." (Panama City EL PANAMA AMERICA in 
Spanish 8 April 94, p 3B)

  [Excerpts] Santiago, 11 Apr (EFE) -- General Augusto 
Pinochet, Army commander and former Chilean president 
(1973-1990), today held a 20-minute meeting with President 
Eduardo Frei at La Moneda Palace, according to government 
authorities. 
  The meeting raised expectations due to the recent crisis 
between the government and the Carabineros forces, but the 
purpose of the visit was for Pinochet to thank the chief of 
state for his concern for his wife [Lucia Iriarte de Pinochet], 
who underwent surgery last week, according to an official 
communique. 
  The communique states that on the occasion they "also raised 
institutional Army subjects." Pinochet apparently arrived at La 
Moneda through underground entrances to avoid meeting with the 
media. 
  Last week Frei faced his first government crisis when 
Carabineros Director General Rodolfo Stange ignored Frei's 
request for him to resign, after a court ruling charged him with 
not fulfilling his duties and with having obstructed the court's 
actions in the case of the murder of three communist leaders in 
1985. [passage omitted] 
  Some analysts considered Pinochet's position of not 
intervening in the conflict and his statement that the possible 
resignation of Gen. Stange "was a problem that concerned him 
alone," were decisive in convincing Stange to accept leaving the 
post.

  [Excerpt] Valparaiso -- Following a heated debate, the 
Coalition of Parties for Democracy [CPPD] on 23 March received 
the minority in 16 of 17 Senate committees in relation to the 
opposition and the government-appointed senators. 
  The Senate committees were constituted during a voting 
session. All the committees were constituted with two CPPD 
senators, two from the opposition, and one government-appointed 
senator. 
  This result was described by several senators as "a great 
defeat" for the CPPD and "a great triumph" for the center right 
(Unity for the Progress of Chile) in the Senate. Also within the 
CPPD, the bloc formed by the PS [Socialist Party], PPD [Party 
for Democracy], and PR [Radical Party] was strengthened to the 
PDC [Christian Democratic Party]'s detriment. 
  During the first legislative term, the CPPD obtained the 
majority in five committees (defense, labor, government, 
finance, and mining). 
  On 23 March, the CPPD obtained a majority only in the 
Finance 
Committee, which is considered a "key" issue for the 
government's economic administration. 
  This majority was decided by a coin toss that favored PDC 
Senator Andres Zaldivar, who was tied with government-appointed 
Senator Carlos Letelier with 30 votes each. (The committees are 
made up of five members, but in this case there were six 
candidates). 
  The other committee members are Jorge Lavandero (PDC), who 
obtained 36 votes; Sebastian Pinera (RN) [National Renewal], 35 
votes; Francisco Javier Errazuriz (UCC) [Center-Center Union], 
35 votes; and Carlos Ominami (PS), 34 votes. 
  The chairmen of each committee will be elected by their own 
members during the first week of April when they meet to agree 
on their work methods. 
  It was learned on 23 March that the right will offer the 
CPPD 
the presidency of the Labor and Defense Committees (to Arturo 
Frei in the latter case). The government-appointed senators will 
preside over two or three committees; the independents will 
preside over one or two; the RN will preside over seven or eight 
committees; the UCC will preside over one; and the Independent 
Democratic Union [UDI] will preside over two. 
  The CPPD senators believe the 23 March voting session 
changes 
the balance that existed during the last four years and has 
turned the official bloc into "a minority in all the committees." 
  This is a "real change" in the political reality and a fact 
that will have consequences in the Senate's future work, the 
CPPD senators said. 
  They said that by joining the committees from which they 
were 
left out before 1990, the government-appointed senators left out 
the CPPD senators. They also pointed out that the 
government-appointed senators have constituted a new political 
bloc. 
  The opposition (RN-UDI-UCC) senators believe the new 
distribution of posts is the result of "a perfect balance" of 
harmony and unity in the center right and also the logical 
result of the parties' representation in the Senate. [passage 
omitted]

  [Excerpts] The Socialist Party [PS] is aware that it is 
currently the leader in the Coalition of Parties for Democracy, 
which is a role played by the Christian Democratic Party [PDC] 
at the political and congressional level in the past. 
  This comment was made on 23 March by Socialist Youth 
President Mauricio Bugueno, who said his party has shown that it 
is capable of politically leading the coalition and that it has 
been able to face the situation better than other parties, 
including the PDC. 
  Asked if he believes the PDC has lost the political 
leadership of the coalition, Bugueno said the PDC is in a 
situation of "perplexity and confusion" and that this is proven 
in some way by the comments made by PDC President Gutemberg 
Martinez, who said the Socialist Party's current strategy is to 
become a political choice. 
  Bugueno said that such a statement is absurd. 
  Despite the comments by PDC Senators Andres Saldivar and 
Juan 
Hamilton denying the PS' leadership of the coalition, PDC 
leaders at the national, provincial, and municipal level and the 
militants see with concern that their party is not creating 
political events or leading the coalition; on the contrary, the 
party is involved in infighting for leadership that is 
unnecessarily wearing down the party. [passage omitted] 
  The PS' talks with the RN [National Renewal] on political 
reforms have been interpreted as a good political strategy. This 
led the PDC to talk with the Independent Democratic Union (UDI) 
on corruption and administrative integrity, which is an issue 
also being discussed by the PS with the RN. [passage omitted]

  Rodriguez met at the Santiago City Hall -- for the first

the Mayors Regional Coordinating Council. [passage omitted] 
  Rodriguez Grossi said that city halls "are the best organs

relationship with the neighborhoods." He said they "have the 
duty to be morally efficient," adding, "municipal efficiency 
will encourage decentralization." 
  Rodriguez Grossi added: "Clear policies and administrative

right to mishandle public assets." [passage omitted]

  [Text] President Juan Carlos Wasmosy returned to the 
country at noon on 9 April after visiting Belgium and France. On 
arriving at the airport he reviewed his main activities in 
Europe. In view of the fact that in Europe he had reiterated his 
desire to privatize state enterprises, he was asked about the 
Senate's determination not to privatize ANDE [National Electric 
Power Administration], Corposana [Water and Sanitation 
Corporation], Antelco [National Telecommunications 
Administration], and INC [National Cement Industry]. He answered 
that he fully respected the senators' decisions, but he made it 
clear that he will inform himself fully of the scope of that 
decision and will speak afterward with the senators. "It is not 
a question of talking about privatizing enterprises.... For 
example in ANDE's case, the distribution, maintenance, 
invoicing, etc., can be privatized. This can even be done 
through bids or with the private sector," he insisted. 
  He commented that he had asked for "fresh resources in terms 
of foreign investment, nonreturnable cooperation, and the 
financing of the expansion of social programs." He stressed that 
he had received the EC's commitment to support these plans, and 
that, of course, he had discussed our democratic process. He 
also stated that he had discussed the situation of the Pilcomayo 
River, state reform, the third stage of industrial reconversion, 
and the Chaco's sustainable development, etc. He gave no details 
on these points. 
  He then said: "It is not the government's idea to get the 
country into debt, but to advance in accordance with our 
possibilities so as not to affect the pocket and stomach of the 
people. 
  "I have spoken about the openness of our government in the 
sense that governments and the armed and police forces are 
always accused of corruption. Moreover, in some European 
countries the winners of bids even figure on their balance 
sheets the commissions they pay to Latin American countries," he 
said. He announced that, together with other chiefs of state, 
they hope to "submit a project of openness" during the meeting 
they will have with President Bill Clinton on 9 and 10 December 
in Miami, Florida, referring to the Summit of the Americas. 
  He announced that he had found the possibility of 
modernizing 
our railway in order to count on a rapid transit system between 
Asuncion and neighboring towns. He even spoke of the intention 
of connecting Asuncion with Itaipu Lake and finally with the 
[Paraguay-Parana River] waterway through a railway system. A 
mission is going to come for the technical studies, but for the 
time being there are no details. Finally, he admitted that our 
country is unknown in Europe. "I am pained to see that we are 
not known in the world," he said.

  [Text] According to Interior Vice Minister Ruben Villalba 
Cataldi, two Arabs presumably entered our country with the 
intention of carrying out illegal actions, but one of them has 
apparently already left the country. 
  Moreover, the National Police limited themselves to 
reporting 
that they are checking out the information that has been 
provided by the Israeli Secret Service, through the Israeli 
Embassy, indicating that Arabs had reportedly entered the 
country with the objective of carrying out attacks against 
Israelis. 
  Despite the fact that the police did not provide many 
details, Villalba Cataldi stated that there is information that 
two Arabs entered the country with that purpose in mind. One of 
them has apparently already left the country, while the other is 
being sought by the police, according to the vice minister. 
  Commissioner Enrique Martinetti, chief of the Intelligence 
Department, stated that an investigation has already begun in 
cooperation with the Migrations Department, Interpol, and 
authorities of the 4th Police Zone based in Ciudad del Este, as 
it is believed that the Arabs entered the country through that 
city. 
  The Israeli Embassy has not been observed to have taken any 
special measures for the security of its diplomats and officials.

  [Excerpt] Interior Minister Carlos Podesta on 9 April 
announced that the government is going to investigate the local 
connection with an international network that deals in narcotics 
and arms trafficking and money laundering. He confirmed that 
"numbers game kingpin" Miro Garcia had been seen several times 
in the casino in Ciudad del Este that belongs to Carlos Barreto 
Sarubbi. Podesta confirmed that Garcia is linked to "the world 
of illegal gambling" in the neighboring country. 
  "They are things that have to be investigated, because one 
never knows whether it is simply media speculation or whether it 
goes beyond that, and in this case the government is going to 
investigate," the minister said, when asked about a published 
report regarding the discovery of an international network 
dealing in smuggling, narcotics and arms trafficking, and money 
laundering with connections in Ciudad del Este. "This Garcia is 
known in the world of illegal gambling in Brazil," the minister 
confirmed. In the investigations Garcia appears to be seriously 
involved in being pinpointed as the "numbers game kingpin." As 
is known, the "animal lottery" (a game) is banned in Brazil; it 
is similar to the numbers game played in our country, with the 
difference that the cards have pictures of animals instead of 
numbers. According to the Brazilian police, this game was 
implemented by the mafia, and it seems that it is a cover for 
other illegal activities such as the laundering of dollars, 
smuggling, and narcotics and weapons trafficking, among other 
things. 
  Podesta stated that he had information that Garcia is 
apparently involved in arms or drug trafficking. "This is why I 
am waiting for my men (investigators) to tell me how they plan 
to coordinate and begin actions to clarify this charge," he 
promised. [passage omitted]

  [Text] "It is unquestionable that there is corruption 
within the Armed Forces, as in any other level of our civil 
society." This remark was made yesterday by General Anibal Rejis 
Romero (retired) during a break at the Armed Forces seminar that 
is currently being held at the Chamber of Deputies building. 
  Gen. Rejis Romero and his colleague Mario Escobar 
Anzoategui, 
also retired, participated in the seminar on "International 
Meeting on Military Issues," at the Chamber of Deputies, which 
was also attended by Argentine and Paraguayan congressmen and 
special guests. 
  Gen. Rejis Romero skirted round the issue of corruption 
quite 
craftily. He nonetheless acknowledged that "nowadays, thanks to 
the invaluable help of the press, we are learning that some 
members of the Armed Forces have also fallen into 
corruption--that general so-and-so is well off, but 
what's-his-name has this and that, etc. Nevertheless, the fact 
that a sergeant, a captain, or maybe a colonel are involved in 
corrupt practices does not give us the right to say that the 
Armed Forces are racked by corruption. This is not so," he 
warned. 
  He conceded that "we can all make a slip, but this is no 
reason to implicate the entire Armed Forces. The Armed Forces 
are too great and meritorious to mix them up with individual 
actions," he said. 
  Later in the interview, the retired general said that a war 
is being waged against corruption. "Have you not read that the 
Army commander in chief has ordered the investigation of 
criminal acts? A pre-trial inquest was ordered not long ago to 
identify those guilty of smuggling logs out of the country, 
after charges were made in Pacova, Canindyu District. A sergeant 
was indicted for this crime, but this does not entitle us to 
involve the Armed Forces as a whole in it," he explained. 
  Gen. Rejis Romero further stated that relations between the 
military and the public are more intense at present because 
there are many officers who are attending school. "This was 
totally forbidden during the dictatorship. Things are different 
now. The commander in chief allows officers to go to the 
university, where they are brought into contact with other 
citizens," he stated. Gen. Rejis Romero declined to answer a 
question about the prevalence of authoritarianism in the 
government's top echelons, saying that as he had been retired 
for months, he had relinquished all official duties and was 
therefore not abreast of current affairs. He later praised the 
Army commander in chief and the military leadership.

  [Text] Cali, Colombia, 10 Apr (AFP) -- One of the attorneys 
for a confessed drug trafficker has told AFP that the process 
whereby Cali Cartel drug "barons" can surrender to justice has 
been "completely halted" because of the dispute between U.S. and 
Colombian justice officials. The process had started in March. 
  One of Julio Fabio Urdinola's lawyers, who spoke to AFP on 
the condition of anonymity, said: "There are no negotiations 
under way with authorities. The process has been completely 
halted." 
  The jurist made these statements in front of the main gate 
of 
Palmira Prison near Cali (490 km southwest of Santa Fe de 
Bogota), where his client has been detained since his 12 March 
surrender. 
  A high security pavilion that will house those drug 
traffickers who surrender is still under construction at Palmira 
Prison (40 km northeast of Cali). Construction is expected to 
be completed in June. 
  Julio Fabio Urdinola, 29, is considered one of the leaders 
of 
the Northern Valle del Cauca Cartel, which is closely linked to 
the Cali Cartel. U.S. and Colombian narcotics agents are 
accusing the Cali Cartel of supplying about 70 percent of all 
cocaine consumed in the United States and Europe. Urdinola's 
surrender, the first by a Cali drug "baron," took place 11 days 
after 28-year-old Yonier Espinosa surrendered. Espinosa is also 
a Northern Valle del Cauca Cartel member. 
  These two surrenders prompted speculation that Gilberto 
Rodriguez Orejuela, alleged Cali Cartel chief, could surrender 
soon. Rodriguez's lawyers were also negotiating with 
authorities. Urdinola's lawyer, however, pointed out that 
Rodriguez's surrender is now highly unlikely because of the 
dispute between U.S. and Colombian judicial authorities. He 
added: "The North Americans have created a tense situation, 
because they oppose the surrenders." 
  On several occasions, U.S. judicial authorities have accused 
Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff of being too lenient on 
confessed drug traffickers. The U.S. State Department stopped 
handing over evidence against drug traffickers, because it 
believes it has only led to light sentences. 
  In view of such criticism, the Colombian Government 
distanced 
itself from De Greiff, and Attorney General Gustavo Arrieta 
proposed a revision of the penal code. The current penal code, 
which has been in force for the past six months, indeed seems to 
be particularly tolerant of drug traffickers, because in some 
cases, it stipulates that those who confess are eligible to be 
put on probation. 
  Within the past few months, the U.S. State Department also 
admonished Colombian officials for failing to try a major drug 
trafficker and for doing nothing to confiscate the trafficker's 
large fortune. 
  A visit to Cali can underscore the scope of the wealth of 
drug traffickers. It is common knowledge that the most 
exclusive Cali neighborhood, Ciudad Jardin, is almost completely 
controlled by the local mafia. Ciudad Jardin is a row of 
beautiful mansions, most of which have pools. High walls 
protect the most opulent mansions, which are constantly guarded 
by security agents on permanent alert. 
  A somewhat nervous taxi driver said during a quick tour of 
the neighborhood: "You had better not take pictures here; you 
could be mistaken for a DEA agent."

<F P=106> [Report by Jesus Ortiz Nieves] </F>
  [Text] Cartagena -- The first live broadcast debate between 
two presidential candidates took place yesterday in Cartagena 
during a Socialists International seminar. 
  Ernesto Samper spoke first before an audience of 500. 
Antonio Navarro followed; both received the same amount of 
applause. It was a formal setting, but there were some small 
quips on coastal humor. 
  The Liberal and the Colombian Commitment candidates 
addressed 
issues such as the scope of social investments, the size of the 
state, job policy, and the results of the economic opening. 
  There was a sort of unexpected referee: President Cesar 
Gaviria, who actually had Samper and Navarro as ministers during 
the first phase of his government. Navarro arrived on time, 
impeccably dressed in a suit and tie. He read a speech critical 
of the government's economic policy and against Samper's 
proposal. Gaviria and Samper wore guayabera shirts and left the 
text of their speeches aside. 
  The president said he strengthened the Armed Forces and 
justice system. Samper said production will be his priority, 
because it is the only way to create jobs and provide integral 
social security for all Colombians. According to Navarro, 
everyone wanted to take a picture with the neoliberals four 
years ago, but today, he said, "no one wants to be in this 
picture." 
  President Gaviria's participation was a type of testament. 
He did not hide the fact his government's priority was national 
security. He defended it by saying all other problems can be 
considered secondary in view of the incredible threats from 
violent people. That is why, he said, he substantially 
increased resources for the Armed Forces and also strengthened 
the justice system. At the same time the president defended his 
government's work in the social field. He said social 
investments were greatly promoted during his administration and, 
in addition, he reprimanded those who try to turn the 
macroeconomic debate into the central topic of discussion. 
  "That is not a relevant topic, at least in Colombia," the 
president said. His participation was received with a certain 
skepticism, even irony. When Gaviria said the 50,000 people 
left unemployed by the state's process of modernization had been 
replaced by new jobs for professional soldiers, policemen, and 
teachers, a student said: "Aha! You are playing musical 
chairs." 
  The first speaker of the evening was Pierre Mauroy, 
president 
of the Jean Jaures Endowment, which had convened the 
international seminar. The public listened carefully to the 
president's speech. Despite the Caribbean atmosphere, the 
guayabera shirts, and a few previous, humorous comments, the 
audience behaved very formally. After the president spoke there 
was a brief intermission. Navarro took advantage of the 
opportunity to say the head of state "is reading the figures 
backwards," because according to him the number of people with 
jobs has increased, but its quality has dramatically dropped. 
According to Samper, we cannot speak of security if we have not 
yet spoken about production, social investment, and jobs, "lots 
of jobs." 
  Gaviria emphatically said his government has not been a 
neoliberal one. He mentioned the subsidy policies for housing 
and the policy of administrative decentralization, which has 
turned over abundant resources to the municipalities so as to 
provide them with drinking water. Navarro said later it seemed 
like a paradox how four years ago everyone wanted to be a 
neoliberal. Samper also said he believes the neoliberalism 
pendulum is on its way back. 
  The president was dismissed with a thunderous applause. The 
fact the president did not bring a written speech forced Samper 
to leave his behind as well. His speech was eight paragraphs 
long, and even though its main points were an important part of 
his presentation, he always made reference to, with a good dose 
of humor, other topics that were not included. 
  He said, for example, Kissinger was once paid $1 million to 
get a lion and a lamb to live together in the same cage. 
Kissinger did it. They asked him how, and he charged another 
$1 million to answer the question. When he finally revealed the 
secret, he said he had simply put into the cage one lamb after 
the other so that the lion would devour them until he was 
exhausted. 
  "That is not the peace we want for Colombia," according to 
Samper, for whom reconciliation must be achieved via a good dose 
of productivity, which can generate another good dose of jobs, a 
total of 1.5 million, according to his estimates, for the next 
few years. 
  The political debate ended with a handshake and with 
Navarro's promise they would see each other again before the 
runoff elections and with Samper's promise there would not be a 
runoff election, "because I will win by a knockout."

<F P=106> [From the "AM/PM" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Throughout last week, the relationship between 
Antonio Navarro Wolff and Ernesto Samper was very active, so 
much so that Navarro accused Samper of harassment. The story 
began 5 April in Cartagena at the Socialist International Summit. 
  Samper, in a first seductive move, tried to have his picture 
taken next to Navarro. Navarro played hard to get, but in the 
end the picture was taken. Samper said his social and economic 
platform coincided with Navarro's. Next in this new love 
affair, Navarro told Samper this was not true and described 
Samper as a neoliberal, saying in social matters, the peace 
process, and concerning corruption their views were very 
different. 
  The next day when the coastal press published reports on the 
alleged love affair, Navarro reacted. He spoke of harassment 
similar to that of Miguel Angel Bermudez. Then, on 7 April 
there was a commotion on the air of RCN [Radio Cadena Nacional]. 
Samper's harassment reached the point where he proposed to 
Navarro a legal matrimony and told him the doors were open until 
the day of the elections. Navarro answered his suitor 
[pretendiente] yesterday in Cali. 
  [Begin Navarro recording] I want to tell Dr. Samper once and 
for all, with all due respect but with all clarity, to quit that 
story. We represent a different project from the one he 
represents, and we do not accept terms or invitations that 
definitely do not match our way of doing things or that of our 
people. [end recording] 
  Today Samper insisted on the wedding. 
  [Begin recording] [Samper] I believe Navarro thinks 
deep-down 
that if we are close to a 51-percent popularity rating and there 
will not seemingly be a runoff election, it is best to jump onto 
the winning bus. 
  [Navarro] Dr. Samper is hoping I give up my candidacy to 
support him, but no way. The dawn shall come, and I will not 
support him. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Carlos Mario Diaz; from the "NTC News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The two leading presidential candidates' intense 
political activities along the Atlantic coast coincided with a 
survey published by the newspaper EL TIEMPO today showing 
Ernesto Samper received 49 percent of voter support compared 
with 39 percent for Andres Pastrana. This brings Ernesto Samper 
close to the percentage of votes that would determine the 
presidential elections in the first round. 
  [Begin Samper recording] I think the decision to choose Dr. 
Humberto de la Calle was predictable, as the report so clearly 
states. He is a serious, very responsible person, a great 
constitutionalist, and he is well aware of the country's 
problems. He guarantees not only a responsible ticket but also 
the Liberal Party's unity. [end recording] 
  Samper also warned of the risks of being overconfident: 
  [Begin Samper recording] My principal enemy at this moment 
is overconfidence. I ask all those who have supported me, 
especially the Liberals, not to ease up in this campaign. The 
election is not won yet. It is true things are going along very 
well, but we must do better to exceed the 50 percent needed to 
win in the first round. [end recording] 
  Samper and Pastrana concentrated their political activities 
on the Atlantic coast. This area of the country has become a 
decisive factor in the campaign, given its enormous electoral 
potential.

<F P=106> [Interview with former General Jesus Armando Arias Cabrales </F>
by Sandra Vergara; place and date not given; from the "Noticiero 
Nacional" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Vergara] Do you feel responsible for the civilians 
reported missing or killed in the Justice Palace takeover? 
  [Arias] I do not feel responsible, nor do any of my men. We 
have never felt responsible for the situation. The 
responsibilities we assumed were determined by operational 
directives and dictated by our commanders. Of course some 
people died, but everyone tends to forget or they neglect to 
mention that the public forces' actions allowed us to rescue 
more than 250 hostages. 
  [Vergara] Do you feel like the scapegoat for this whole 
thing? 
  [Arias] Yes, I think so, judging from the results of the 
Attorney General's Office investigation, meaning the resolutions 
issued in 1989 implying that Colonel Edilberto Sanchez and 
General Arias were the only ones at the Justice Palace. This is 
not a matter of blaming someone else. The investigation should 
have been more thorough and decisions should have been based on 
the facts.

<F P=106> [From the "TV Today" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Eight months of negotiations ended today with a 
peace agreement between the government and 430 guerrillas of the 
Socialist Renewal Movement, CRS. The rebels turned in their 
weapons to Dutch Government and Socialist International 
representatives at a ceremony today in Flor del Monte, Sucre 
Department. 
  The CRS today formally surrendered their weapons and began 
making peace in the presence of peasants from Sucre Plains, more 
than 12 ambassadors from various countries, village priest Nel 
Beltran, Government Minister Fabio Villegas, members of the 
Advisory Board for Peace Issues, and media representatives. 
  [Begin recording] [First guerrilla] I am anxious to see my 
family, I haven't seen them for a long time. 
  [Unidentified reporter] What is your main concern? 
  [First guerrilla] We are not worried as much about the Army 
or the government as we are about other guerrilla groups. 
  [Second guerrilla] We know what has happened to many 
demobilized guerrillas, and we are afraid it could happen to us. 
[end recording] 
  Most of the rebels are under 30 years old. They say they 
will return to civilian life and to their homes to study and to 
work toward improving the country. Today they turned in their 
rifles, pistols, and grenades. Some of the weapons were dropped 
into the sea off the coast of Barranquilla. The other weapons, 
it was reported, will be melted down to make three bells for 
Flor del Monte, Ovejas, and El Pinar. 
  Here is Guillermo Perez, a member of the Advisory Board for 
Peace. 
  [Begin Perez recording] This is a victory for peace, for the 
reconciliation of all Colombians, which strengthens our hopes of 
building a democracy through the consolidation of peace. [end 
recording] 
  During the ceremony, the rebels remembered their comrades 
killed in action and mothers cried for their sons. Afterward, 
the rebels began their journey into civilian life. They 
departed in buses to Uraba, Barranquilla, Santa Marta, Pereira, 
and other places. They said they will participate in politics. 
  Many believe this was the Gaviria administration's last card 
for peace. 
  [Begin Government Minister Villegas recording] We have shown 
that there are options for peace in our country and that the 
vast majority of Colombians are rejecting violence and terrorism 
as a form of political expression. [end recording] 
  The government will issue identification cards and military 
cards to those who do not have them and will make loans of up to 
4 million pesos per person to be used in productive projects. 
In addition, each demobilized member will receive 170,000 
pesos per month for a year. 
  The rebels will create a political organization that will 
also be called CRS. They will automatically have two 
representatives in the Chamber of Representatives. CRS members 
will be asked to submit blank votes in the upcoming elections. 
  Thus 433 CRS guerrillas departed from Flor del Monte on the 
afternoon of 9 April to embrace peace. 
  The residents of Flor del Monte are afraid that other 
guerrilla groups could replace the CRS rebels. The agreements, 
however, contemplate the establishment of a verification 
commission, including the presence of soldiers and church 
members in Flor del Monte.

  [Text] Another incident between Caracol and the 
presidential campaign of Andres Pastrana occurred yesterday. 
  Ricardo Alarcon, president of the [Caracol] radio station, 
said that Luis Alberto Moreno, Pastrana's campaign director, had 
publicly threatened to declare "war" on him and had done so in 
the presence of the presidential candidate. 
  Alarcon sent a letter to Moreno yesterday asking for an 
explanation and telling him many people are thinking that with 
this kind of behavior he is driving more people away from 
Pastrana than he is attracting. 
  There has been no response from Moreno who, at the close of 
this edition, had still not seen the contents of the letter. 
  The circumstances surrounding the incident have to do with 
the alleged censuring, by the station, of the Tunja news 
director's interview with the candidate and his wife which was 
to be aired on the "Personality of the Week" program. 
  On 14 March Moreno sent a letter to Alarcon in which he 
protested the decision by Caracol--which has not yet been 
explained--not to air the interview. 
  Relations between the campaign and the radio station have 
been tense since Andres Pastrana decided not to accept 
contributions from the Santo Domingo Group, which owns the 
station. 
  Alarcon's letter to Moreno states the following: 
  "The fact that I have been abroad for the past few days has 
prevented me from responding to your letter of 14 March. 
  "I deeply regret that, once again, you have misunderstood 
Caracol's position with regard to the presidential candidates. 
  "With respect to news information, our policy has been, and 
will always be the same: to defend the right of our listeners to 
be well informed. This is a reality which we are able to 
substantiate and which you are aware of as a cabinet minister 
and now as director of Dr. Andres Pastrana Arango's campaign. 
  "I cannot refrain from referring to the incident which 
transpired on 16 March in the El Campin stadium at the 
Colombia-Sao Paulo match. At that time and in the presence of a 
group of people, among whom was Dr. Andres Pastrana, you 
threatened me with a `war.' 
  "Of course, I would not hesitate to let the angry incident 
pass, or forget your angry and disconcerting reaction, 
understandable perhaps in the light of certain political facts 
and realities, but there is a lingering doubt. I don't know 
whether I should take your defiant threat, `if you want a war, 
you will have a war,' as intended for Caracol, or for the entire 
Santo Domingo Group. 
  "If the above is serious, you should let us know beforehand 
what this war involves and what the arena will be. If, on the 
other hand, it was brought on by a fit of temper or was the 
result of a difficult moment, we would like to have an 
explanation of the incident. 
  "Many people think, ourselves among them, that you are 
driving more people away from Dr. Pastrana Arango than you might 
think you are attracting."

  [Text] Yesterday Peruvian Foreign Minister Efrain 
Goldenberg reiterated that Eduardo Ponce, the Peruvian 
ambassador in Quito, will continue in his post as the Peruvian 
Government sees no reason to replace him. Moreover, he asserted 
that there is no problem with the Ecuadoran Government. The 
minister stated: "The Peruvian ambassador in Quito does not need 
to be confirmed in his post. Ambassadors are appointed, and 
cannot be confirmed in their posts. Ponce therefore continues to 
be Peruvian ambassador to Ecuador until the Peruvian Government 
decides otherwise." 
  Goldenberg said that the relationship between the two 
countries is satisfactory. "Ecuadoran Foreign Minister Diego 
Paredes, with whom I met in Washington recently where we both 
voted for Colombian President Cesar Gaviria as new OAS secretary 
general, can himself tell you that." 
  Regarding Argentine Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella's visit, 
Goldenberg explained that it is to return the visit he paid to 
Buenos Aires last December. 
  Among the subjects on the agenda, he said, are the 
arrangements for President Carlos Saul Menem's upcoming visit. 
  Moreover, he announced that a group of Peruvian Government 
officials who belong to the Commission for the Promotion of 
Private Investment (Copri) will shortly travel to Buenos Aires. 
He said that "Argentine businessmen want to participate in the 
privatization process," and then mentioned that this will be 
another issue he will discuss with Di Tella.

  [Excerpt] President Alberto Fujimori said the United States 
has no moral authority to criticize Peruvian judicial 
legislation because injustice is also committed in that country. 
  Regarding the report released by the commission headed by 
well-known jurist Robert Goldman, President Fujimori said the 
commission's criticisms do not match the real Peruvian situation. 
  Fujimori said: "Injustice also is committed against ethnic 
minorities in the United States; therefore, that country has no 
moral authority to criticize us." 
  Fujimori added that the Peruvian Government's position 
regarding the Goldman report is established in the letter signed 
by Justice Minister Fernando Vega Santa Gadea, which considers 
the criticisms of the Peruvian judicial system unfounded. 
  According to the Goldman report, the Peruvian judicial 
system 
is not independent and many innocent people remain in prison due 
to the excesses of the antiterrorist legislation approved by the 
government. 
  Fujimori also said on 6 April that the antiterrorist 
legislation already has been changed four times and no more 
changes will be made. 
  He noted: "The antiterrorist legislation was necessary in 
the 
struggle against terrorism. It is logical to make mistakes when 
enforcing the law." 
  "What I am convinced of is that we should not allow violence 
to take over the country," said Fujimori in ratifying his 
support for the antisubversive regulations. 
  He admitted there are cases in which innocent people are 
accused but he said this does not mean they are the majority of 
those accused or arrested for terrorism. 
  Fujimori also expressed satisfaction with the release of 
eight reporters accused of praising terrorism and he regretted 
they had to remain in prison. 
  He blamed the judicial branch for this problem, and 
indicated 
that the branch is still slow in clearing charges against 
innocent people. 
  In an effort to defend himself from criticism, Fujimori said 
there is a clear intention to do justice, which was shown with 
the reporters' release. 
  "This shows that freedom of expression is respected here," 
said Fujimori to the reporters who asked him about this issue. 
  Asked how many innocent people are still in prison, Fujimori 
said he did not want to talk about percentage but that there are 
not too many. 
  He added: "But there are flagrant cases that should be 
corrected." 
  Fujimori indicated, however, that the fact that the accused 
are doctors or reporters does not give them impunity if they are 
linked to subversive activities. 
  He added: "There are cases in which some doctors appear 
committed in Shining Path military operations or in support of 
the People's Aid of Peru." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Another State Department Aggression"] </F>
  [Text] The U.S. State Department is responsible--regardless 
of its good or bad intentions--for another attack against Peru. 
This time through the disclosure in Washington of a report on 
Peruvian justice prepared by a commission of international 
jurists sponsored by the U.S. State Department. This reported 
was widely covered by the international media. 
  An AFP report, for example, disseminated throughout the 
world 
states that according to that commission, "the reorganization of 
the Peruvian judicial branch carried out by President Alberto 
Fujimori since his self-inflicted coup has seriously eroded, if 
not eliminated, the independence of this branch in Peru." The 
report urges Peru "to eliminate anonymous judges, define with 
precision what the crime of betrayal of the fatherland entails, 
and review the decree law against terrorism." 
  The damage this information causes Peru is obvious, 
especially taking into account that it does not reflect reality. 
It is no secret that the Peruvian judicial branch currently is 
undergoing a deep-rooted reform, ranging from the 
appointment--not by the executive branch but by the Disciplinary 
Board for Magistrates, which enjoys consensus--of worthy and 
capable judges to an efficient and modern administration of the 
institution and the implementation of new modern procedural 
codes. 
  For the first time in the republican history of Peru, our 
Supreme Court members are selected after passing difficult tests 
and not due to political influences. These judges enjoy full 
independence because they owe nobody in the executive branch or 
Congress, except their own ability, for their posts. But neither 
the commission of jurists nor the State Department ever mentions 
this fact. To ignore this, especially under the circumstances 
Peru has experienced, represents a lie. 
  The antiterrorist laws--harsh and of a summary nature in the 
beginning--have made it possible to severely punish terrorists 
who in the past almost always were freed, and at the same time 
give them a chance to repent. This formula has been an effective 
legal and psychological tool in the struggle against terrorism, 
which by far is the main threat not only to human rights, but 
also to the survival of the Peruvian nation. Moreover, these 
laws have become more flexible through the implementation of 
other measures approved last year before these pure and 
immaculate jurists finished their report. These laws will be 
made more flexible in a gradual and prudent manner. The Peruvian 
citizenry is not willing to run any risks.... 
  Therefore, what is the U.S. State Department's purpose in 
giving the world a distorted image of Peru? Why isn't Peru 
judged the same way as countries such as the PRC and Mexico, 
whose judicial and electoral institutions are indeed pinpointed 
by the executive branch? 
  The parameters used for Peru are so different and so 
shockingly incapable of taking into account--for many obvious 
reasons--the same considerations given other countries, that one 
wonders whether what really bothers the U.S. State Department is 
the fact that the Peruvian president is of Japanese descent and 
may thus represent, in the nightmares of U.S. officials, the 
spearhead of Japanese economic power pointing toward Brazil, 
where the largest Japanese colony in America resides and from 
where the soybean that the all of Asia consumes comes. 
  If this were the case, which we believe is not, the State 
Department should say it aloud. It is no secret that during 
World War II niseis were persecuted in Peru with the support of 
the local authorities that ruled at that time and under the 
sponsorship of the also Democratic Washington administration at 
that time. We wonder whether the commercial war that is about to 
unleashed between these two powers also will be fought over our 
heads? 
  Peru now is proud to have, in the midst of its poverty and 
most serious domestic decay, given intelligent and successful 
answers to win the internal war that already has resulted in so 
many deaths. 
  Therefore, the fact that the State Department sponsors the 
international dissemination of a deceitful, superficial, and 
slanderous report drafted by four jurists, as the justice 
minister has rightly stated, after a stay of only three days in 
our country represents a lack of respect for our country.

  [Text] Congress President Jaime Yoshiyama on 4 April 
predicted that the declining figures in favor of President 
Alberto Fujimori's candidacy will pick up as soon as he starts 
his electoral campaign. 
  Yoshiyama thus virtually made official Fujimori's candidacy 
for reelection, something the chief of state has refused to 
confirm so far. 
  Yoshiyama thus refuted poll results that show former UN 
Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar as the undoubtable 
winner of the presidential elections. 
  Polls show 47 percent support for Perez de Cuellar and only 
38 percent for Fujimori. 
  Fujimori's "representative" also referred to Perez de 
Cuellar 
in stating that all candidates who live abroad should go into 
the opposition to debate the president and state their 
viewpoints. 
  Without mentioning his name, he said the candidates who live 
abroad should come to the country and dirty their shoes by 
visiting different points of the country. 
  He also said it would be good that Fujimori remains 
president 
to be able to continue his pacification and economic 
stabilization program. 
  Yoshiyama later said that the delay in the beginning of 
ordinary Congress sessions is due to the need for the committee 
presidents to coordinate their debate agendas to make them as 
productive as possible. 
  Legislator Henry Pease has repeated charges that government 
representatives seek to delay beginning Congress sessions to 
prevent the debate of electoral bills and others such as the 
ones on fiscal policies and municipalities. 
  Pease charged that there is an attempt to implement an 
electoral system that everybody regards as untimely and 
inconvenient for the country because it is unreasonable. 
  Yoshiyama, in turn, said that among the draft bills to be 
debated are those for the electoral system, which will allow the 
system's reorganization, as established by the new Constitution. 
  He commented that it will prevent any chance of fraud and 
will allow clear elections. 
  The Congress president added that the important thing is 
whether there is any political will to hold clear elections with 
the presence of international observers. 
  He commented that Congress will make the laws clearer so 
there is no intention of fraud, as the opposition groups have 
charged. 
  He added that the Constitution was approved by the large 
majority of the people and all that remains to be done is to 
adjust the electoral law to it. 
  Yoshiyama said he is not against the establishment of an 
independent body to supervise the elections, as some groups have 
proposed. 
  He said that everything that will contribute to a clear 
process is welcome; the presence of international observers and 
the media is something in favor of the electoral process. 
  Another bill that must be debated is the one referring to 
ownership certificates that will allow the distribution of 2 
million title deeds to farmers. 
  He added that next week Congress also must debate the water 
and education draft bills. 
  The Congress president made these statements after a 
ceremony 
to mark the 95th anniversary of the Japanese emigration, which 
also was attended by Japanese Ambassador Nobuo Nishisaki.

  [Text] The Christian Democratic Party [PDC] on 4 April 
proposed the establishment of a Democratic Front encompassing 
the widest social and political spectrum to oppose the Alberto 
Fujimori administration's plans to remain in power. 
  Addressing a PDC rally at the Ovalo on Saenz Pena del Callao 
Avenue, PDC President Julio Luque Tijero called on all 
democratic political parties, labor centrals, federations and 
unions, peasants, professionals, and students to join this front. 
  The current PDC leadership held the rally "as a sign of 
mourning for democracy on the second anniversary of the rupture 
of the national institutional order," on the occasion of the 
self-inflicted coup perpetrated by President Fujimori with the 
support of the Armed Forces high command. 
  In his speech, Luque Tijero said the PDC "looks favorably 
upon the presidential candidacy of Javier Perez de Cuellar," who 
is heading voters' opinion polls by considerable margins. 
  Speaking later to LA REPUBLICA, PDC President Luque Tijero 
said: "The main objective of all Peruvians with democratic 
heritage is the defeat of the concealed dictatorship headed by 
President Fujimori." He added that the Democratic Front should 
elect its presidential candidacy through a consensus. 
  He said: "I believe that in this case all of us must look 
beyond any selfish party ambitions or ideologies and that Perez 
de Cuellar is the person who will enjoy everyone's support." 
  In his address at the rally, Luque Tijero warned citizens 
and 
international public opinion about the danger that "at any time" 
the government may decide to either postpone or not hold the 
1995 elections. 
  He said: "President Fujimori has an extensive record so as 
to 
be able to trust him. First, he won over the people's confidence 
by promising that he would not implement an economic `shock' 
program but he turned around and enforced a brutal `supershock' 
program." 
  He added: "Later, he swore before God and the fatherland to 
uphold and enforce the Constitution but he abruptly violated it 
exactly two years ago. Now that polls show that his popularity 
is sharply declining, who can guarantee what Fujimori will do 
tomorrow?" 
  In this regard, he said the country must stay alert and 
united in case of eventual election fraud or any attempt to 
perpetrate another coup. 
  Luque Tijero said: "Not only all Peruvians but also 
international public opinion must be alert." 
  To this effect he called upon all democratic governments of 
the world, particularly those who comprise the so-called 
"Support Group," and international organizations such as the 
United Nations, the OAS, the ILO [International Labor 
Organization], etc., to demand from the Fujimori administration 
the full and effective upholding of the sovereign will of the 
Peruvian people expressed in free elections. 
  For our part, stated Luque Tijero, we have addressed letters 
to international organizations that represent the PDC such as 
the Christian Democratic International and the Christian 
Democratic Organization of the Americas. 
  Present at the 4 April rally were delegations from the 
Peruvian Port and Maritime Workers Federation, the PescaPeru 
[State Fishmeal and Fish Oil Production Agency] Workers 
Federation, and other Callao port labor unions. 
  Sergio Valdivia, secretary general of the Port and Maritime 
Workers Federation, who harshly criticized President Fujimori's 
administration's antilabor policy, delivered a speech before 
Luque Tijero.

  [Text] Respect for the human rights of those arrested on 
drug trafficking charges in the Upper Huallaga zone is no longer 
a cold guideline given by the military and police commands. It 
is now a conscientious action taken by all members of the Army 
and the National Police operating in that part of the Peruvian 
jungle. 
  On 2 April in San Martin, an inhospitable area in the 
Tarapoto jungle, a Dinandro [National Antidrug Division] patrol 
supported by the Air Police detected a lab for processing 
cocaine base and acted by surprise. Not even the torrential rain 
or the thunderstorm stopped police, who arrested five people. 
  After the operation, police seized 128 kg of cocaine base, 
many ingredients for making the drug, and a shotgun. 
  Back at the Tarapoto airport the arrested were taken to the 
police station. The police then, without knowing reporters were 
present, gave the arrested soft drinks and their own food 
rations they used in their operations. 
  None of the arrested showed signs of violence on their 
bodies 
when they were put under the jurisdiction of judicial officials. 
They also never complained about being mistreated by police. 
  A police sergeant said: "We always respect the rights of the 
people we arrest, even under the most adverse circumstances 
after they use their weapons on us and we capture them." 
  This National Police action, without the tempting presence 
of 
cameras and microphones, shows that human rights are indeed 
respected in Peru and that there is no need for "spokesmen" 
abroad to report alleged human rights violations. The real 
situation is in that remote region where perhaps one of those 
"spokesmen" never saw what happened.

<F P=106> [Interview with General Alfredo Rodriguez, chief of the </F>
Huallaga Countersubversive Front Command, by Braulio Orellana 
Flores; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Orellana] General Rodriguez, how is the 
pacification process developing in the Huallaga 
Countersubversive Front under your command? 
  [Rodriguez] Regarding the pacification process, we can say 
that it is 90 percent under control in the northern region (San 
Martin). This means that the MRTA [Tupac Amaru Revolutionary 
Movement] and Shining Path [SL] have been almost totally 
annihilated. In the southern region (mainly in Tingo Maria) we 
are still facing problems with subversion because the last 
subversive groups persist in their genocidal venture and have 
not surrendered to authorities. However, I can inform you that 
the entire area will be completely under control very soon. 
  [Orellana] The legal measures issued by the government, such 
as the Repentance Law, have yielded excellent results in other 
regions. What was the impact of this legislation on the 
antiterrorism struggle? 
  [Rodriguez] Look, initially these measures were received 
with 
some mistrust in the region. People did not believe they would 
result in anything positive. It was thought that the measures' 
objective was to pressure people. Time has gone by and these 
people, I cannot say to what sector they belong, have realized 
how mistaken they were. There have been many terrorists who have 
voluntarily resorted to the Repentance Law without any sort of 
pressure. 
  When these terrorists presented themselves to the Armed 
Forces barracks and units their human rights were respected, and 
this attitude also has influenced subversives to resort to this 
new law. 
  [Orellana] What other factors have yielded positive results 
in the counterterrorist struggle in the Huallaga Front? 
  [Rodriguez] In addition to the Armed Forces' actions and the 
legal measures, we can say that citizen participation has been 
another fundamental element in winning the war against 
terrorism. Their cooperation has been valuable in the last few 
years. 
  In addition, the Armed Forces are actively participating in 
this effort and we are constantly engaged in clashes with 
terrorist groups with very positive results. 
  Finally, I must say that psychological operations are also 
an 
essential part of the war we are currently waging against the SL 
and MRTA. In the jungle area, we drop pamphlets from our 
airplanes telling terrorists, who have been recruited by force, 
about the serious mistake they are making by staying with the 
terrorists. Many already have abandoned these shelters and 
surrendered under the Repentance Law. 
  [Orellana] In the Huallaga Front, there have been some cases 
of the involvement of military officers with drug traffickers. 
What can you tells us in this regard? 
  [Rodriguez] We have sustained harsh blows from these bad 
elements of society who have seriously damaged our institution. 
The Peruvian Army will never allow its members to be involved in 
this illegal activity. 
  However, we bear the full responsibility and we fully trust 
that this situation will end there. Corruption is not part of 
the Armed Forces' institutions. 
  [Orellana] How are you combating drug trafficking in the 
Huallaga Front under your command? 
  [Rodriguez] At the present time, our units, our commands, 
and 
the Huallaga Front commander himself are directly involved in 
fighting drug trafficking. 
  We are constantly destroying airfields and the shelters the 
drug traffickers build in the more remote jungle areas. We 
conduct dragnet operations whenever we have specific information 
to capture the "drug traffickers" and this is yielding very good 
results. 
  [Orellana] This, of course, is forcing drug traffickers to 
withdraw to other areas where they are also under attack. 
  [Rodriguez] Quite so. We are destroying all illegal activity 
in this area. This is why drug traffickers are withdrawing to 
other areas, where they are being attacked in the same manner. 
They will have no way out when we control the entire region. 
  We witnessed this when we seized three metric tons of 
cocaine 
paste some time ago in Manu. We have had access to this 
information since January. This is very important for us because 
very soon we will eradicate them from the entire San Martin 
region, although not entirely. 
  [Orellana] General, how has the respect for human rights 
developed in the pacification process? 
  [Rodriguez] We uphold human rights in every aspect of the 
word. There are no human rights abuses in this area. If there 
have been charges in this regard, they have been from biased 
parties uninterested in seeing the Armed Forces working in the 
region. 
  I will give you one example: When we entered Bellavista 
within the framework of a military operation that upheld all the 
laws in force and that even appointed a special prosecutor, 
there were people who reported that the alleged terrorists we 
arrested had been allegedly mistreated. All these fabrications 
were later denied by the special prosecutor who accompanied the 
military operation. 
  [Orellana] Does this mean there is no evidence of the 
alleged 
human rights violations charges that have been raised? 
  [Rodriguez] No there are not. None of the charges raised 
against the Armed Forces' activities in the area have been 
proven. Perhaps some may have been very aggressive but this does 
not mean that people have deliberately committed abuses against 
those arrested in Huallaga.

  [Text] Lima, 11 Apr (EFE)--It was disclosed today that a 
high-ranking Peruvian Army chief has been accused of heading a 
military organization that protected drug traffickers in 
exchange for money. 
  General Eduardo Bellido, current Peruvian military attache 
in 
Israel, was charged by retired Major Evaristo Castillo with 
letting drug traffickers operate in Huallaga, where he was 
political-military commander during 1991 and 1992. 
  Castillo, who said he has been harassed and received death 
threats, asserted that in 1992 Bellido ordered his troops not to 
intervene in the struggle against drug trafficking and that they 
only fought terrorism. 
  The retired Army major stated that the alleged links 
Peruvian 
military officers maintained with the drug mafias "are a 
complete system" and that it is not only isolated cases of 
corruption involving certain officers. 
  He thus disagreed with a recent U.S. State Department report 
stating that one of the obstacles facing the fight against drug 
trafficking in Peru is the corruption of police and military 
officers, but that the problem does not have an institutional 
character. 
  Castillo stated that in 1992 he witnessed how chiefs of 
battalions under Bellido's command collected protection fees 
from drug traffickers to let them operate and then handed that 
money over to Bellido. 
  As an example he mentioned that the general never ordered 
the 
arrest of the most important Peruvian drug trafficker, Demetrio 
Chavez Penaherrera, aka Vaticano, arrested last February in 
Colombia, "although he knew where he was through Intelligence 
Service and DEA [Drug Enforcement Administration] reports." 
  He also asserted that the Peruvian military also knows where 
Colombian trafficker Waldo Vargas, aka Ministro, operates and is 
not doing anything to arrest him.

  [Text] Caracas, 12 Apr (DPA) -- Several Banco Latino 
branches in Caracas were the targets of low-intensity explosions 
this morning which resulted in only property damage. Banco 
Latino was taken over by the Venezuelan state in mid-January for 
a lack of liquidity, thus giving rise to the worst financial 
crisis in the country's history. The bank reopened its doors 
last week. 
  A homemade explosive device exploded at the Banco Latino 
branch in Quinta Crespo (southwestern part of the Venezuelan 
capital) at 0520, causing only slight property damage. Police 
found and defused another device placed inside a gasoline 
container at another nearby Banco Latino branch. Banco Latino's 
main office has received several phone calls throughout the day 
warning of possible explosions. 
  Banco Latino press department spokesmen reported about an 
attack on one of the bank's branches in Altamira (eastern 
Caracas), the windows of which were all shattered. 
  So far only one person has been arrested. Interior Minister 
Ramon Escovar Salom said he will wait to see the police reports 
before issuing his position on the incidents.

<F P=106> [Report by Miguel A. Liendo] </F>
  [Text] Merida--President Rafael Caldera has said that 
Venezuelans who want something that a majority of the country 
does not are behind an anti-Venezuela campaign. He said this at 
a news conference in Merida where he was attending the 
ordination of Monsignor Juan Maria Leonardi Villasmil, the 
auxiliary archbishop of Merida. 
  President Caldera asked the media "to stop echoing foreign 
campaigns and publicizing this negative campaign because it is 
detrimental to the country and its interests." He added that 
such campaigns come from very unimportant U.S. concerns 
[empresas] and organizations that are not well recognized. 
  The president addressed media concerns about the national 
economy and reports that circulated regarding the risks that the 
country could entail to foreign investors. 
  That campaign has repercussions in Venezuela because certain 
sectors are echoing it with intentions and interests unknown to 
me, he added. "Actually, behind the campaign are certain 
Venezuelans who want something that a great majority of the 
people do not: to see the government that I head fail to comply 
with commitments made to the Venezuelan people." 
  The U.S. Government, he added, as stated explicitly by its 
ambassador accredited in our country, has no role in or the 
slightest liking for that negative campaign, because this 
government recognizes and proclaims the efforts that my 
government is making for Venezuela, democracy, and the entire 
American Continent. 
  Caldera said that in the United States Enrique Iglesias, 
president of the Inter-American Development Bank [IDB], "has 
very clearly recognized the efforts being made by the current 
government, and this is confirmed at meetings with important 
government officials. Iglesias made this statement after having 
serious and thoughtful study; morover, the IDB, World Bank, and 
IMF have also conducted similar studies of the Venezuelan 
situation." 
  He added: Thus, I urge my country's media, which sometimes 
publishes excessively large headlines on any opinion issued by 
any unimportant organization that is virtually unknown in the 
United States, to realize that they could hurt the country and 
the very interests they represent. 
<H5>  Taxes </H5>
  [Reporter at news conference] How will your government 
control any wave of speculation? How will it control tax money 
to ensure it is truly channeled to solving the country's 
important social and economic problems? 
  [Caldera] No one likes to pay taxes; it is not pleasant to 
collect them either. The need for them is determined by the 
serious budget crisis facing the country that is worsened by a 
drop in the price of our main product, petroleum. The measures 
that will be adopted are important, and they very clearly 
reflect the concern for social justice that governs this 
government's activities. 
  He recalled his commitment to eliminate VAT [value-added 
tax] 
at the consumer level and to shift the burden of taxes to those 
who are economically able to pay them. 
<H5>  Salary Increases </H5>
  The president said that he trusts that there will be no 
price 
increases because, in his opinion, it would be unjustified. We 
think, he added, that it is an indispensable obligation to 
increase the minimum wage of all Venezuelans who do not earn 
enough to meet their basic needs. 
  He said that the economic guarantees were supressed and that 
the powers granted to the government by those measures have not 
been exercised with much prudence, but we know that there are 
prospects for eliminating any outrageous abuses that might 
further worsen the already difficult economic situation facing 
Venezuelan households. 
  When asked whether his government will define a true policy 
for foreign investments, Caldera said that very important people 
in the international economic world and in developing countries 
trust our economy, the course it is following, and the 
guarantees it offers. 
  [Reporter] Fedecamaras [Venezuelan Federation of 
Associations 
and Chambers of Commerce and Industry] fears inflation will 
result from the announced increase in wages and salaries; the 
CTV [Confederation of Venezuelan Workers] demands them. When 
will that announcement be made? What is your opinion on the 
position of the business leadership? 
  [Caldera] Salary increases are not enacted to create 
inflation but because there is inflation. My administrations's 
main goal is to fight inflation.

<F P=106> [Article by Manuel Lopez Calo] </F>
  [Text] The financial crisis had a very high price for the 
country, reaching 10 percent of GDP. Credit assistance reached 
363.058 billion bolivares (6 percent of GDP) and there was 
capital flight worth $2.65 billion during the first quarter of 
the year. The collapse of important banks created such a climate 
of distrust that those holding liquid assets were forced to 
purchase foreign exchange in an amount eight times greater than 
the decrease in international reserves for the entire year of 
1993. 
  The reopening of Banco Latino, where the problems confronted 
by the banking system were first detected, coincides with the 
decline of the crisis in the financial system. The intervention 
at Banco Latino was a bad business for the government in terms 
of opportunity costs, but the lowest point of the curve seems to 
have passed. The Central Bank of Venezuela (BCV), announcing the 
reserve levels at the end of the first quarter, reported that 
the foreign exchange movement had begun returning to normal. 
  With a balance of $12.656 billion in gross reserves at the 
end of 1993 and a positive balance in the current account of the 
balance of payments--$937 million at the close of the first 
quarter--the gross amount of foreign currency to date is $10.943 
billion, which means there had to be a $2.65 billion flight of 
capital. 
<H8>  Indebtedness To Bridge the Gap </H8>
  The government made a cut in the 1994 Credit Law to reduce 
net public indebtedness. Liabilities of 240 billion bolivares, 
equivalent to $2.1 billion, are expected, but 100 billion 
bolivares are expected to be amortized. 
  The government's objective is to reduce the number of 
sources 
of financing from multilateral organizations not considered 
priority and which are tied to requirements that the government 
cannot meet. But this shift in the government strategy harms the 
position of the capital account of the balance of payments. 
  The multilateral organizations' loans committed to social 
programs allowed the country to capitalize the loans because 
they did not signify expenditures of the country's foreign 
currency. This mechanism would mitigate the negative tendency of 
the balance of payments. 
  The governmental goal of the 1995 Umbrella Law is to commit 
resources to purchasing strategic military equipment, ruling out 
the possibility of capitalizing the indebtedness. 
<H8>  Necessary Aid </H8>
  The monetization of financial aid could promote inflation if 
the BCV does not use mechanisms to reduce liquidity. An increase 
in the monetary base without an increase in goods and services 
produced by society increases the price of products. This, 
however, was a necessary evil to reestablish the system's 
stability. 
  The failure of one bank could generate the failure of 
others, 
a risk the fiscal authorities did not want to take. One 
peculiarity of the financial crisis is that there is a 
systematic relationship: The collapse of bad banks could provoke 
the failure of good banks. 
  Without a solid financial system, it is impossible to think 
about the entry of new capital. The people's distrust increases 
the demand for dollars, creating distortions in the economy, as 
occurred in the country in the first quarter of the year. 
<H8>  Cover Deficit in the Current Account </H8>
  The basic objective of the government's stabilization 
program 
is to obtain a macroeconomic equilibrium to reestablish a 
climate of confidence that will open new opportunities for 
private investment and promote productive activity. The entry of 
capital would improve the balance of capital, thus strengthening 
the country's international reserves. 
  If we are unable to attract foreign exchange capital, our 
international reserves will continue to decrease. The current 
account will continue along the same trend of 1993 and might 
reach a $3-billion deficit balance this year. The entry of 
nonspeculative and short-term foreign exchange capital would 
strengthen the Venezuelan position. A climate of political 
stability and an economic proposal devoid of excessive 
adventurism could be the key to recovering investor confidence.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Venezuelan economic developments monitored through 12 
April. 
  Data collected by the Foreign Investment Superintendency, 
Siex, and the National Committee for the Promotion of Foreign 
Investments indicate German companies made $43.6 million in 
direct investments in Venezuela in 1993. Sven Heldt, president 
of the Venezuelan-German Chamber of Commerce and Industry, has 
said most investments focused on the chemical and pharmaceutical 
areas. The main investors were Hoechst ($24.9 million), Bayer 
($7.5 million), Siemens ($4.6 million), Schering ($3.5 million), 
Wella ($ .8 million), Fichtel and Sachs ($ .6 million), and Viex 
Anstalt ($ .6 million) (Caracas EL REPORTE DE LA ECONOMIA in 
Spanish 5 April 94 p 22) 
  The most recent Siex figures indicate foreign investments 
reached $3.03 million in March 1994 compared to $30 million in 
March 1993, a 90-percent drop. The accumulated investment for 
1994 is $21.867 million compared to $33 million for the first 
three months of 1993, a 30-percent drop. The major contributors 
of foreign capital are Denmark, the United States, the 
Netherlands, Switzerland, and Saint Martin. The manufacturing 
sector, with $13.5 million, was the main recipient of foreign 
capital in the first three months of 1994. Transportation, 
storage, and communications also received major investments. 
(Caracas EL NACIONAL in Spanish 7 April 94 p E-8) 
  The Venezuelan Petroleum Corporation on 5 April announced a 
price increase of its crudes and other products as of 6 April. 
Heavy crudes increased by 50 cents, light crudes by $1 per 
barrel. Other products increased by 2 to 3 cents per gallon. 
Gasoline increased by $2.50, jet fuel by 3 cents, and distilled 
products by 2 cents. The decision stems from an increase in 
international petroleum prices and an adjustment in the price of 
Venezuelan petroleum to the price established by the 
international market. This increase established the price of 
Venezuelan export petroleum at $12.05 per barrel. (Caracas EL 
DIARIO DE CARACAS in Spanish 7 April 94 p 15) 
  The Central Bank has reported Venezuela paid $783.5 million 
of its foreign debt during the second half of 1993. Of that 
figure, 5.4 percent was used to pay capital, the rest to pay 
interest. Aggregate domestic demand dropped by 5.6 percent in 
real terms during the second semester of 1993 due to a 
1.2-percent drop in private consumption and 4.1-percent drop in 
government consumption. 
  Investment dropped by 3.3 percent in real terms due to a 
12.5-percent drop in public investment. In contrast, private 
investment grew by 13.4 percent, fueled by demand from the 
construction sector. Hotels and restaurants, commerce, 
agriculture, construction, and manufacturing were the most 
affected areas. The Central Bank has reported the domestic 
public debt amounted to $223.641 million bolivares during the 
second half of 1993 in comparison to $156.546 million over the 
first half. Treasury bills totaled 30.7 million bolivares during 
the first half of 1993 compared to 66.08 million in 1993 over 
the second half. (Caracas EL NACIONAL in Spanish 10 April 94 p 
E-8) 
  Banco Latino spokesmen have reported this bank increased its 
cash savings and deposits by 6.19 percent between 4 to 7 April, 
the first week following its reopening. Deposits and savings 
amounted to 84.961 million bolivares as of 7 April. (Caracas 
REPORTE DE LA ECONOMIA in Spanish 11 April 94 p 3)

  [Text] In connection with the implementation of the North 
America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) last January, the Economic 
Planning Agency [EPA] has conducted a survey on the agreement's 
impact on Japanese companies' investment behavior. According to 
the survey results, Japanese companies are not yet highly 
motivated for investments in Mexico and other NAFTA nations, and 
the EPA concluded that NAFTA's impact on the companies' behavior 
has not clearly been observed so far. 
  As a trilateral agreement among the United States, Canada, 
and Mexico, NAFTA is seeking tariff cuts on a step-by-step basis 
to establish a free trade zone involving the three nations. 
Following the implementation of NAFTA, the EPA surveyed 1,990 
Japanese companies which have sales or production subsidiaries 
overseas. As a result of the January survey, responses were 
obtained from 635 companies. 
  In response to a (multi-choice answer) question asking in 
which countries or regions companies desire to expand their 
operations, 41.6 percent said they want to expand business in 
the United States; however, those who favored Mexico and Canada 
remained at 10.4 and 6.5 percent, respectively. In contrast, 
39.7 percent were interested in Newly Industrialized Economies 
(NIES) in Asia, 53.2 percent preferred ASEAN, and 51.3 percent 
were for China. The companies thus showed great interest in 
Asia rather than NAFTA. Commenting on this, the EPA said that 
the business sector prefers brisk and prospective markets, and 
that NAFTA is unlikely to drastically change companies' 
investment policies for the time being. 
  Yet, about 40 percent of the companies that are planning 
expansion of operations in Mexico said their plans are to "catch 
up with the regional economic merger." The EPA said that 
influence of NAFTA is observed on this point.

  [Text] Finance Minister Domingo Cavallo took people by 
surprise by making a categorical remark conditioning the 
approval of the new patents law to a greater opening of the U.S. 
market or to Argentina joining NAFTA. 
  Only four days before crucial elections for the government, 
Cavallo harshly reacted to the pressure being exerted by 
Washington for the approval of this controversial draft bill. 
  Cavallo said: "Since it is so important to them, let us use 
the patents law as a negotiating tool to obtain better terms for 
our exports." 
  Among other things, the current patents law allows 
pharmaceutical laboratories to freely use formulas that do not 
belong to them, which has generated serious criticism and 
pressure by the U.S. Government. 
  For more than a year now the official intellectual property 
draft bill has been blocked in Congress by government and 
opposition legislators who are against it. 
  This is not the first time Cavallo has voiced doubts about 
the simple approval of the draft bill. What is more, during a 
recent economic team meeting, Cavallo and Economic Programming 
Secretary Juan Jose Llach agreed on the disproportionate U.S. 
interest in the draft bill's approval and what they are willing 
to grant in exchange. 
  Cavallo now has asserted: "We will approve the patents law 
when we, in exchange, can join NAFTA or obtain greater 
facilities for the entry of our exports."

  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto 
Robaina met on 12 April with Peruvian Minister of Industry 
Liliana Canales [title and name as heard] to discuss issues of 
mutual concern. Canales inquired about the various sectors of 
the Cuban economy open to foreign investments where Peruvian 
investors could get quickly involved, and confirmed her plans to 
visit Havana as soon as possible. She will be accompanied by a 
group of Peruvian businessmen who will have a definite set of 
proposals ready for the relevant Cuban organizations and 
authorities. 
  Robaina also met with several solidarity groups. [passage 
omitted] 
  Robaina's visit served further to confirm that Peru's 
Minister of Public Health and Minister of Industry, accompanied 
by businessmen, will visit Havana in the very near future.

  [Text] Santo Domingo, 12 Apr (EFE) -- The Dominican Army 
dismissed General Aurelio del Rosario Polanco on 12 April and 
appointed Tommy Fernandez Alarcon to monitor communities on the 
Dominican border to prevent the trafficking of fuel to Haiti. 
  The replacement took place after del Rosario objected to the 
presence of international observers in Dominican territory. 
  Army Chief Major Gen. Ivan Hernandez Oleaga ordered the 
dismissal. The Army has been monitoring the border area since 
11 April. 
  Del Rosario assumed responsibility of commanding the 
military 
garrisons 15 days ago as the Dominican measures to strengthen 
the UN-imposed embargo against the Haitian military coupists 
toughened. 
  Hernandez is in charge of an operation to restrict the 
trafficking of fuel to Haiti at the Dominican border. 
  The presence of Haitians in Dominican communities has 
decreased since the military officer's arrival at the border, 
because they fear arrest by Dominican military agents. 
  As fewer Haitians cross the border, Dominicans stand in long 
lines to buy fuel which later will be illegally traded with 
Haitians. 
  The Armed Forces reported this week more than 10,000 
Dominican agents are guarding the border to prevent the 
trafficking of fuel. 
  The surveillance of the Dominican-Haitian border increased 
three weeks ago after the meetings Dominican President Joaquin 
Balaguer held with U.S. officials. 
  In addition, the Dominican Government is trying to silence 
an 
international campaign accusing it of violating the embargo on 
the neighboring country.

<F P=106> [Article by Pedro de Camargo Neto: "A Deceitful GATT Deal"] </F>
  [Text] The new International Commerce Agreement will be 
signed in Marrakesh. It is the result of the so-called Uruguay 
Round of talks held within GATT. What enthusiasm should 
Brazilian farmers have about the new agreement? 
  The way in which the agreement was negotiated cannot be 
ignored. Negotiations violated a basic principle, that of 
multilateral action. The position of weak countries was for the 
most part ignored. Stronger countries made it clear that orders 
come from those who have power. Orders are obeyed by 
common-sense countries. The authoritarianism adopted by the 
United States and the EU jeopardized the principle of 
negotiation that should be observed by all commercial rules. It 
is not a matter of claiming that we can have the same weight. 
But it is necessary to clearly admit that most countries had 
limited participation. We are actually in a submissive position, 
and recognition of this situation will make it possible for the 
Brazilian economy to find its appropriate place in international 
commerce. 
  The Uruguay Round began with the revolutionary proposal to 
eliminate subsidies for agriculture. The challenge represented 
by the destruction of this economic "barrier" was exciting. Time 
showed the change in the U.S. position against subsidies and for 
free trade. For their part, weak countries lacked cohesion for 
eliminating the "barrier." In the end it was clear that the 
"barrier" is not a priority. The EU is facing problems in its 
own structure. It has very close neighbors that might cause more 
serious problems in the future. The United States is concerned 
about building a "dike," not about eliminating the "barrier." 
Agricultural subsidies were postponed for another occasion. 
  It would be very difficult to hail the 21 percent reduction 
of subsidies on farm exports over the next six years. Subsidies 
on exports have nothing to do with food insurance [seguranca 
alimentar]. Nor do they have anything to do with the well-being 
of U.S. or European farmers. They do not protect less 
competitive farm sectors. They represent a simple and cheap way 
of making internal adjustments -- unfortunately -- at the 
expense of others. 
  Food support and food insurance policies generate a 
production surplus. This surplus, however, can be managed 
internally. The complexity of stronger countries' farm policy is 
such that it allows for adjusting production without a 
noticeable drop in farmers' income and without subsidizing 
exports. Doing it on the international market, however, is 
simpler and easier. This way, internal policy affairs are 
adjusted by throwing out the economic waste of the production 
surplus. They destroy international market prices by adjusting 
their internal policy. What is simple and cheap for the strong 
harms the agriculture of the weak. 
  Subsidies on exports cannot be justified. It is actually a 
79 
percent injustice. It means that because of a solution that is 
simpler and more economic for the strong, a vast part of the 
world will still have to wait perhaps six years to grow. We 
obtained very little, if anything at all. We can resign 
ourselves to the room we have. We should sign the agreement 
because not doing so might be even worse. But hailing this would 
be too much.

  [Text] Comitan, 11 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- A human rights 
association reported on 11 April the alleged kidnapping of their 
president by ranchers, and requested the intervention of Chiapas 
Governor Javier Lopez Moreno. 
  Candelaria Alfaro Garcia, the organization's spokeswoman, 
said that Enrique Perez Lopez, president of the 
South-Southeastern Human Rights Association, was reportedly 
kidnapped by 80 cattlemen at La Piedad Farm, Chicomucelo 
Municipality. The source added that Perez Lopez was forced 
aboard a truck on Sunday and taken to La Florecita Farm, 
Chicomucelo. His whereabouts are unknown. 
  The local human rights ombudsman [words indistinct] was 
kidnapped after he accepted an invitation to visit La Piedad 
Farm, where ranchers are accused of violating peasants' rights. 
  The charge was filed in the Chiapas town of Comitan, about 
1,400 km southeast [words indistinct] of Mexico City and about 
200 km from the region of Los Altos, where an armed group 
emerged on 1 January. 
  Peasants and Indians have trespassed on land belonging to 
large landowners since the appearance of the Zapatist National 
Liberation Front and during the peace talks between this group 
and Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis. 
  The human rights organization on Monday sent a letter to 
Governor Lopez Moreno to plead for the release of Perez Lopez 
and to urge the state Attorney General's Office to punish the 
alleged kidnappers. 
  Spokeswoman Alfaro Garcia added that the presumed kidnappers 
are Guillermo Ruiz, Manuel and Arturo Velazco, Amin Garcia, and 
Corazon Lopez, among others. Meanwhile, the state Attorney 
General's Office pointed out that it is about to Perez Lopez.

<F P=106> [Report by Manuel Alvarez Cedeno] </F>
  [Text] Local diplomatic sources have reported that 
President Guillermo Endara is currently examining the draft of a 
protest note that his government will officially present to the 
U.S. Government in light of a U.S. report that Panama is an 
international money laundering center. 
  Jaime Ford, the Panamanian ambassador in Washington, D.C., 
met yesterday with Foreign Minister Jose Mulino to draft the 
protest note. Government sources told LA PRENSA that the 
president is carefully analyzing the draft note before signing 
it. 
  Officials from the Clinton Administration recently affirmed 
that Panama has become a major center for laundering drug money. 
Endara and Foreign Minister Mulino later rejected the 
accusation. 
  Jaime Ford stated that there has been no major reaction from 
the United States since the report was released. The ambassador 
explained that "we are working very hard to draft this protest 
note. That is the reason for my visit to the Foreign Ministry." 
  Last week Endara said that Panama is helping in the fight 
against drug trafficking and money laundering. 
  Ford added that the Foreign Ministry and the Presidency are 
drafting the protest note together and "will deliver it as soon 
as it is ready." 
  The diplomat also said that the world, as it faces the 
invasion of drugs, must create an organization that can combine 
efforts, with proper respect for the sovereignty of each nation, 
to fight drug trafficking and its effects. 
  U.S. Government sources have also said that there is more 
money being laundered in Panama now than during the days of drug 
dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega. 
  The Endara administration has rejected the charges, arguing 
that this is a campaign to tarnish the country's image.

  [Text] Santiago, 11 Apr (EFE) -- Chile will lose $295 
million per year if it does not establish some sort of 
relationship with Mercosur [Common Market of the South], 
according to a survey the Chilean Foreign Ministry asked a 
private consulting firm to carry out. The firm recommended a 
rapprochement with this group that seeks the integration of the 
Southern Cone. 
  The survey results, published today by EL DIARIO, which 
specializes in economic subjects, states that if Chile does not 
establish some sort of relationship with Mercosur it "will lose 
all the advantages to promote trade." 
  The survey states that Chile will lose $125 million per year 
in exports and $170 million per year in imports. 
  The figures only reflect the impact of trade with Brazil and 
Argentina, without taking into account Uruguay and Paraguay, the 
other Mercosur member countries. 
  The survey states that "Mercosur is definitely important to 
Chile," noting that its member countries are the main importers 
of Chilean goods. 
  Moreover, it states that joining any integration initiative 
will only speed up the flow of foreign investments, attracted by 
the size of this broadened market, and also may contribute to a 
greater complementation of the economies. 
  The report also refers to the negative effects that Chile's 
possible link with Mercosur may have; the macroeconomic 
instability of the member countries and their failure to agree 
on a common external tariff, which would be a maximum of 11 
percent of the current one in Chile. 
  According to the consulted analysts, the main problem in 
reaching an agreement with Mercosur is in the establishment of a 
common external tariff that the group must agree on and, within 
this context, the true problem is that Brazil has higher taxes 
for its capital goods, informatics, and electronics industry. 
  The report also states that if Chile joins Mercosur, it will 
increase its exports to Brazil by only $2.5 million and its 
imports of Brazilian goods, in turn, will increase by $71 
million, of which 67 percent would represent a change in trade 
partners not new deals. 
  In Argentina's case, it is quite the opposite because, 
according to the survey ordered by the Foreign Ministry, exports 
would increase by $58 million of which 68 percent would 
represent new deals. 
  Imports, in turn, would increase by $100 million, of which 
$67 million would represent new deals.

  [Text] Lima, 11 Apr (EFE) -- Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto 
Robaina today invited Peruvian businessmen to invest in Cuba, 
and added that his country has opened its doors to foreign 
capital by granting juridical and constitutional support.

official visit, today held a working meeting with 200 private 
businessmen to inform them about the incentives that the Cuban 
Government is granting to foreign capital. 
  Robaina said that the Cuban opening is "generally considered 
a priority, but within this perspective we want to prioritize 
Latin American investments." 
  Explaining the Cuban juridical framework that regulates 
foreign investments, Robaina said that "it is sufficiently clear 
and flexible so as not to cause any mistrust." 
  He added: "This can be certified by investors from Spain, 
Canada, Italy, France, Argentina, Brazil, and Colombia, 
countries that have already invested in Cuba and with which we 
maintain good relations." 
  Robaina also said that Cuba "is not asking anyone to adopt 
its political ideology as a precondition for the establishment 
of economic ties, because these foreign investments are in line 
with Cuban national interests." 
  Commenting on current Cuban economic problems, Foreign 
Minister Robaina said "they are the result of many factors, but 
the greatest obstacle is undoubtedly the U.S. commercial 
blockade." 
  Robaina today held a meeting with Peruvian Foreign Minister 
Efrain Goldenberg, with Congress President Jaime Yoshiyama, 
while tonight he is scheduled to hold a news conference. 
  On Tuesday, the last day of his visit, Robaina will carry 
out 
private activities. He is scheduled to resume his South American 
tour, which started last week in Montevideo and also includes 
Argentina and Paraguay, on 13 April.

<F P=106> [Report by Annerys Gonzalez; from "The News" newscast -- </F>
live relay] 
  [Text] Disip [Directorate of Intelligence and Prevention 
Services] members arrived at San Martin Avenue at 0910 [1310 
GMT] this Tuesday to defuse an alleged explosive found near a 
Banco Latino automatic teller machine. Well-protected members of 
the Disip Explosive Division are proceeding to defuse the pipe 
bomb. An official is signaling that the situation is under 
control. 
  As you can see, people were ordered out of the building to 
avoid any possible mishap. 
  Disip officials picked up a polyethylene bag--apparently 
containing an explosive device--and put it inside this truck to 
transport it to a location where it can be detonated. Members of 
the Special Action Brigade of the Judicial Technical Police 
[PTJ] and officials of the Disip Explosive Division arrived at 
the location to take pictures of the pipe bomb before it was 
detonated. 
  As you can see, all security measures are being taken to 
carry out this operation. Additionally, vehicle traffic in the 
area was stopped to prevent injury to people near the explosion 
site. We expect the detonation of the pipe bomb found at Banco 
Latino any minute. [loud explosion heard in background] 
  Vehicle traffic was finally resumed, and Disip officials 
departed the area. The Disip and PTJ will investigate this 
situation to determine who planted this explosive at Banco 
Latino in San Martin.

  [Text] A note from PRENSA LATINA says that Cuban Foreign 
Minister Roberto Robaina today received, in Buenos Aires, the 
Illustrious Visitor decoration which was granted to him by the 
deliberative council of the Argentine capital. The ceremony took 
place during a 48-hour visit by Robaina to Argentina during 
which he also met with the provisional president of the Senate, 
Eduardo Menem. 
  It has been reported that legislators from all the political 
parties represented in the Senate participated in this meeting, 
which has been described as friendly. Upon welcoming Roberto 
Robaina, Eduardo Menem ratified a resolution approved by the 
Senate last year in which the Senate came out in favor of a 
cessation of the U.S. blockade of Cuba.

  [Text] A valuable cargo of approximately 50 garbage trucks 
arrived from several regions of Spain, mostly from Valencia, 
which donated 35 units. Upon the official delivery of these 
vehicles, among them garbage collectors, trucks, water tanks, 
and 612 containers intended for the collection of solid wastes, 
special expressions of gratitude were extended to the people of 
Valencia for their gesture of solidarity. State employees were 
also urged to take special care of these vehicles. Some 30 
additional vehicles and more than 4,000 containers are expected 
to arrive from Spain by 30 April. These units will be put into 
operation immediately. 
  Cesar Romero, Havana City Council provincial director, 
expressed thanks for the donation received from Valencia. He 
said that these trucks arrived at the most critical moment for 
sanitation in the capital.

  [Text] The cuts in the electric power supply currently 
occurring in Cuba are caused, basically, by difficulties in the 
nation's thermoelectric plants' generating capacity. Over half 
of the nation's 3,132 megawatts of generating capacity is 
produced by thermoelectric plants of Soviet or Czechoslovak 
manufacture. The Santa Cruz del Norte and Mariel plants, as well 
as the Rente plant in Santiago de Cuba, came from the Soviet 
Union; the 10 de Octubre plant in Nuevitas, which has a 
generating capacity of 330 megawatts, was made in 
Czechoslovakia. This means that our country has not received 
parts for that equipment since 1990, which has had an influence 
on the difficulties being encountered with power plants. 
  Today, the electric system's generating availability 
averages 
50 percent, while under normal conditions it once reached over 
70 percent -- for, because of maintenance and breakdowns, no 
plant operates at 100 percent of installed capacity. This year, 
the power plant maintenance program has available resources that 
allow it to perform maintenance aimed at gradually recovering 
generating capacity. It is undoubtedly important to be able to 
count on Cuban oil, which since last year has been guaranteeing 
approximately 30 percent of the fuel earmarked for generating 
electric power. Cuban crude is burned only in the Maximo Gomez 
plant in Mariel, the Rente plant in Santiago de Cuba, the Santa 
Cruz del Norte plant in Havana, and the Jose Marti plant in 
Matanzas. 
  The problems of electric power service due to a lack of 
generating capacity are going to diminish progressively through 
the efforts of that sector's workers in maintenance tasks, 
supported by the construction workers of certain provinces. By 
carrying out the maintenance program planned for this year, and 
completing two new generating units early next year, there will 
also be a gradual recovery -- toward normal levels -- in the 
availability of the (?fuel ration). One of these new units will 
be the 200-megawatt Felton unit in Holguin Province; the other, 
the 100-megawatt unit at the Santa Cruz del Norte power plant in 
Havana. All this will benefit the national electric power grid, 
as will the entering on line next May of two units currently 
undergoing maintenance.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Miguel Angel de la Guardia Hernandez from the </F>
"Evening Information Review" newscast] 
  [Text] The so-called daily blackout system that Cuba has 
been forced to implement because of the country's serious 
economic crisis has intensified over the past few days because 
of fuel problems and numerous damages to electrical generators. 
  The Maximo Gomez thermoelectric plant, one of the nation's 
largest with an installed capacity of 600 megawatts, suffered 
damages and had to be removed from the national network. Other 
plants throughout the country have also been damaged by Cuba's 
heavy oil, which can cause serious damage if it is not 
adequately treated or if adjustments are not made to the 
industrial equipment in which it is used. Cuba has been forced 
to use this heavy oil to generate a considerable amount of the 
electricity required by the country, because there is an 
insufficient amount of light oil for all of the generators. 
  Workers at the Maximo Gomez plant are struggling tooth and 
nail to repair this important power plant before the month is 
over in an effort to restore services to the limited level the 
people were receiving before the plant went off-line. Problems 
like these, which pose a daily inconvenience for the entire 
population and generate severe economic problems because they 
paralyze various services that require electricity, are 
characteristic of the critical economic situation Cuba has 
suffered ever since the USSR collapsed and the full burden of 
the criminal blockade imposed more than 30 years ago by the U.S. 
Government was brought to bear on the country. 
  This blockade has now been intensified by the well-known 
Torricelli amendment, whose purpose is to extend the so-called 
embargo to all of the countries that maintain commercial ties 
with Cuba. This is yet one more difficulty the Cuban people 
must deal with. It is perhaps one of the main difficulties, if 
you will, but certainly not the only one, because the industrial 
sector is nearly paralyzed by a shortage of fuel, replacement 
parts, lubricants, fertilizers, and numerous other resources 
which, in turn, has created the worst economic situation in the 
country's history. 
  A situation like this would have made the best of the 
capitalist or so-called democratic-representative governments 
collapse. In Cuba, however, we have a heroic people who are 
resisting, because they know what they are defending, and 
because they are fully aware of what they would lose with the 
disappearance of their socialist system, which has brought them 
so many achievements, not only material, but also moral and 
spiritual. This is why the Cuban people voted overwhelmingly in 
favor of the revolution headed by Fidel Castro during the recent 
elections. This is why Cuba has so much strength and prestige 
throughout the world. This is why the Cuban people will 
continue fighting until they achieve victory.

  [Text] After the latest control assessment in the country's 
western region, when Havana was declared the winner, Sugar 
Industry Minister Nelson Torres said the climate is favorable 
for making a maximum effort in cutting and grinding sugarcane 
with greater efficiency. 
  He said that Havana, Sancti Spiritus, and Cienfuegos are the 
provinces with the greatest possibilities for meeting the 
established plan before 1 May. He also urged all other provinces 
to set concrete goals for the international labor day. Nelson 
Torres explained the country's need to complete the planting of 
5,000 caballerias of sugarcane this month during the Spring 
campaign. 
  In the assessment by region, the western region has 
overpowered the eastern region, while Havana Province reached 
the best production level and was also one of the best in sugar 
production, sugarcane planting, and care of plantations.

  [Text] Despite the negative reaction reported at the lower 
chamber regarding the 10 April resolution demanding the 
installation of the president of the Court of Cassation, the 
president of the Senate opposition office, Bernard Sansaricq, 
shows great optimism. For Senator Sansaricq, the text of this 
resolution will receive the approval of the deputies. He warns 
the populace against rumors of [someone's] taking the office of 
Justice Jonassaint. Sen. Sansaricq specifies that the Senate he 
leads is expecting a green light from the deputies. 
  [Begin recording] [Sansaricq] I am very optimistic, and I 
believe the Chamber of Deputies will definitively shoulder its 
responsibilities and pass the resolution. We have many deputies, 
I repeat, who agree with this resolution; I think it will be 
passed this week or, at latest, next week, and we are waiting 
for its passage so that the resolution has full impact. If the 
Chamber of Deputies commits the mistake, before history, of not 
approving this resolution, then at that time we will think of a 
solution to take, but not now. Right now, we are optimistic that 
it is going to be passed by the Chamber of Deputies. 
  [Reporter Francois] Have you already contacted Justice 
Jonassaint in that regard? 
  [Sansaricq] I can tell you that officially we were waiting 
for the result of the vote on the resolution in the Chamber of 
Deputies in order to contact Justice Jonassaint. Unofficially, 
contacts with him have been made by some senators. I can tell 
you that Justice Jonassaint is a patriot, a nationalist, a man 
who definitely will fulfill the duty that he must fulfill toward 
the nation. It is a page of history that we are writing, and I 
do not think that the Chamber of Deputies is going to shy from a 
constitutional duty. 
  The Legislative Palace is also ours. It was built by 
President Dumarsais Estime for the use of both chambers. No one 
can prevent us from entering our home. There are all kinds of 
rumors spreading about how so-and-so will be appointed prime 
minister; the installation will take place today. No! We are 
doing what is right, a historic action for the nation, and we 
want to come out great in the eyes of history and the Haitian 
people. We ask the populace not to believe those rumors and to 
remain calm. [end recording]

  [Text] The leader of the socialist bloc in the Chamber of 
Deputies dissociates himself totally from the resolution passed 
by the Senate office led by Senator Sansaricq. The socialist 
bloc remains committed to the parliamentary plan regarding the 
unblocking of the Governors Island agreement, says Deputy Duly 
Brutus: 
  [Begin Brutus recording] We remain faithful to the plan 
which 
we ratified in the Chamber of Deputies in the Haitian 
parliament. We are waiting for the Senate's position with Sen. 
Firmin Jean-Louis; on the other hand, we feel that we must 
continue negotiating a solution to the Haitian political crisis. 
  [In Creole] The socialist bloc does not relate to this 
position on the application of Article 149 of the Constitution. 
We believe the time is not right to take such a step, mostly 
because we think that the parliament has made some progress on 
the international level. It would be a pity if today we were to 
take some false steps that would cause the parliament to lose 
the credibility it has on the international level. [end

  [Text] Priest-President Jean-Bertrand Aristide is not 
qualified to fill the high office of president of the Republic 
of Haiti, according to Louis Dejoie II, acting minister of 
commerce and industry, advancing the opinion that the latest 
communique on the Port Tortuga matter has demonstrated the 
meanness of the president and his lack of political maturity and 
ability to analyze state affairs. In a letter to the general 
director of the weekly HAITI EN MARCHE, Dejoie assails the 
president as audacious. He writes: It seems odd that I can be 
accused of being a traitor -- unless this accusation comes from 
a mentally ill, malicious, racist, and embittered Haitian 
jealous of my democratic stands in favor of the Haitian people. 
  Louis Dejoie II explains that he is not seeking revenge and 
has not raised a destructive weapon against Haitian brothers, 
political clans, or social strata but has always preached 
national reconciliation. Dejoie says he is the victim of a plot 
against him hatched by the lavalasians. A lavalas brigade from 
Miami is allegedly already in Port-au-Prince for the purpose of 
assassinating Minister Dejoie. That would be something! he 
exclaims, in this letter to the general director of HAITI EN 
MARCHE.

  [Text] Gunfire was exchanged during the night of 7 April 
between armed strangers and soldiers at the outpost of Borgne in 
northwest Haiti, sources reported in Port-au-Prince on 12 April. 
According to the sources, two military detachments from 
Cap-Haitien, 260 km north of Port-au-Prince, were sent to the 
area. Neither side suffered casualties. The unidentified 
attackers are being sought, according to a Haitian military 
source. Weapons of unrevealed nature and number were abandoned 
by the attackers, according to the same source. 
  A similar incident took place the night of 2 February in 
Chantal, near Les Cayes, 200 km south of Port-au-Prince. Two M-1 
rifles abandoned on that occasion by the attackers were 
recovered by soldiers.

  [Text] The Haitian Anti-Drug Service announced that it 
seized 12 kg of cocaine intended for the U.S. market at the 
Port-au-Prince International Airport on 12 April. The drug was 
concealed in the luggage of a Haitian citizen who was going to 
Miami, Florida, on a commercial flight. He was arrested and 
imprisoned. Two other people, who were with the owner of the 
luggage, were questioned. 
  In recent days, more than 60 kg of cocaine coming from 
Colombia and intended for the U.S. market has been seized in 
Port-au-Prince by the Haitian Anti-Drug Service, which is 
working jointly with the local branch of the U.S. anti-drug 
office, Drug Enforcement Agency [DEA] [previous four words in 
English].

<F P=106> [Letter and "Official Explanation" sent by Carlos Morfin </F>
Otero, member of the Mexican Chapter of the Society of Jesus, to 
LA JORNADA; place and date not given] 
  [Text] Mr. Director: On 8 April, the daily newspaper SUMMA 
published on its front page a report identifying subcommander 
Marcos [of the Zapatist National Liberation Army] as one Father 
Jeronimo Hernandez Lopez. 
  I would appreciate your publishing in your newspaper a note 
from the Jesuits of Mexico that denies the information published 
in that newspaper. 
  As we indicated in our communique, public opinion needs 
truth. False opinions encourage -- during the difficult times 
the nation is experiencing -- slander, violence, instability, 
and insecurity. 
  I reiterate my appreciation for the objectivity that has 
characterized LA JORNADA's reporting. 
  [Signed] Carlos Morfin Otero, S.J. 
  Member of the Mexican Chapter 
  Official Explanation by the Jesuits of Mexico: 
  On 8 April 1994, the daily newspaper SUMMA, whose director 
is 
Jose Antonio Perez Stuart, published on its front page the 
following news: "Marcos" is the Jesuit Jeronimo. This was an 
exclusive report for SUMMA by special correspondent Ernesto 
Esparza. 
  The report says that this information came out of an 
investigation conducted by a special federal government group 
whose operations are headquartered in Chiapas. 
  The Society of Jesus in Mexico (the Jesuits), reports: 
  1. Jesuit priest Jeronimo Alberto Hernandez Lopez is not 
subcommander Marcos. We would like to state clearly that from 5 
August 1992 to 5 April 1994, Father Jeronimo Hernandez Lopez, 
S.J., was assigned as a pastor to Guatemalan refugees in 
Campeche State. 
  This information was made public and is known to national 
authorities, as is demanded of anyone who wants to work with the 
refugees. 
  2. As of this date, Father Jeronimo Hernandez has been 
assigned to our project in Bajon-Arena, Chiapas State. 
  Attorney General Diego Valades and Goverment Secretary Jorge 
Carpizo were duly informed of the preceding. 
  3. Several days ago Father Jeronimo was interviewed and 
photographed by National Security agents from the Campeche State 
delegation, allegedly to confirm his whereabouts and his work 
with refugees. These agents were provided with the requested 
information. 
  4. We strongly condemn the report published in SUMMA. It is 
unprofessional to contribute to slander and insecurity based on 
false reports, without indicating who is responsible for the 
mentioned investigation. It is very serious to involve the 
federal government in general. That report should be added to a 
long list of false information orchestrated by some media. 
Public opinion demands the truth. False opinions encourage -- 
during the difficult times the nation is experiencing -- 
slander, violence, instability, and insecurity. 
  [Signed] Carlos Marfin Otero, S.J. 
  Member of the Mexican Chapter

<F P=106> [Report by special envoy David Aponte on an interview with </F>
Subcommander Marcos of the Zapatist National Liberation Army by 
unidentified reporters in Lacandona jungle on 9 April] 
  [Text] Lacandona Jungle, Chiapas, 9 Apr -- Rebel leader 
Subcommander Marcos announced today that the Zapatist National 
Liberation Army (EZLN) says the "political and military" 
conditions are not right for them to continue discussing the 
government's proposals within the Indian communities, in search 
of dignified peace in Chiapas, or to resume talks with Peace 
Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis. 
  He said the Clandestine Indian Revolutionary 
Committee-General Command (CCRI-CG) is demanding that the 
Mexican Army cut back its presence in the region and that 
livestock breeders and ranchers suppress their belligerence in 
order for the talks to resume. 
  The EZLN military strategist also said the rebels have heard 
nothing from Manuel Camacho Solis -- either privately or 
publicly -- as previously stated by the former foreign minister. 
  In an interview with three reporters in a clearing in the 
Lacandona jungle, the subcommander commented on Camacho Solis' 
public reappearance and on his views on the peace process. 
  On Friday, the commissioner, speaking to representatives of 
the three branches of the government, reaffirmed his commitment 
and his position on a political solution to the armed conflict. 
He also mentioned that new steps will be taken in the next few 
weeks aimed at building peace. 
  Basically, Marcos believes that "political and military" 
conditions are not right for the resumption of talks. He 
charged that the Mexican Army is conducting new troop movements 
into new areas in the region. 
  [Marcos] "What they did was to move them out of the press' 
way. They retreated across the flank the press covers, namely 
Tuxtla Gutierrez, San Cristobal de las Casas, Ocosingo, 
Altamirano, and Las Margaritas. Some of them came around 
Arraiga, and the others came through Villahermosa and Tenosique. 
Five days ago about 30 8.5 ton trucks came down from Tenosique 
along the border highway, transporting about 1,000 or 1,200 
soldiers." 
  [LA JORNADA] Don't you think this is just movement of troop 
replacements? 
  [Marcos] This is within the replacement. What they do is to 
relocate the parachute and sapper units; they get them out of 
the press' way and place them in the rear. The paratroopers are 
counterguerrilla rangers [preceding word in English]. In 
military terms this means sappers and paratroopers in the rear; 
thereby the hammer and anvil operation is inverted. It would 
now be on the border and the anvil here. 
  "I believe here they have too much at stake and the game is 
to penetrate the woods (the Lacondona jungle), control the road 
and from there position the anvil. I do not think they will 
risk positioning the anvil in Ocosingo, Altamirano, and Las 
Margaritas because this would be too obvious and they do not 
want this." 
  [LA JORNADA] What are they thinking of then? Is this an 
offensive tactic? 
  [Marcos] Isolation, removing the guerrillas as spokesmen on 
society. They want us to stop making statements; they want us 
to stop doing what we are now doing. They want to take us out 
of these woods. Nevertheless, the troop movements here have to 
be very quick to force us out of here. What was planned 
previously on this side -- that is to move in the sappers and 
the paratroopers who are the green berets -- was to defuse the 
mines. These are counterguerrilla units who come in to clash 
and to locate us. 
  "The units used are from 12-15 [not further explained]. We 
are talking about approximately 5,000 men, a division. This is 
an airborne division, following the gringo model of a rapid 
intervention. 
  "Therefore, initially they move in this direction, Ocosingo, 
Altamirano, Las Margaritas, on the landing fields here. The 
landing field of Altamirano was refurbished while all commercial 
flights from Las Margaritas landing field were stopped. There 
they have set up a garrison from where they start to push us to 
over there (the border with Guatemala). Over there is located 
the anvil, in this case it would be the Kaibiles (elite unit of 
the Guatemalan Army). At this point, the Mexican Army eases up, 
and there they would force us to confront the Kaibiles. The 
Kaibiles then apply the anvil. 
  "To this end, they publish in the media that the soldiers 
have left; the reporters see them passing through San Cristobal 
de las Casas. Nevertheless, they turn back and then change 
troops." 
  [LA JORNADA] Is the government playing both sides? Camacho 
said he coordinates the interests of peace, in reference to the 
cattle breeders. 
  [Marcos] Yes, I believe he is going to attempt to include 
the 
cattle breeders somewhere in the dialogue. They had already 
intended to talk to us as they know very well that we have not 
yet invaded the farms. Maybe they want to take advantage of 
this to reach an agreement and solve the problem of the cattle 
that was the war tax and to somehow negotiate land ownership. 
  "Meanwhile, the Army supposedly continues to ease military 
pressure. What it is really doing is maintaining it at the same 
level. It is not compartmented; it simply has changed strategy. 
This is the last report I received yesterday (Friday)." 
  [LA JORNADA] This is not clear. What does the government 
want? Does it want to continue with the dialogue, or is it 
preparing for a final offensive? 
  [Marcos] It does not want to continue with the talks; what 
are now suspended are the talks. They want to know what the 
communities are going to say, and they want to maintain the 
military presence. They are waiting to see the results of the 
talks, to then ease the military pressure and begin 
negotiations." 
  [LA JORNADA] Do you believe you will continue with the 
dialogue if the conditions exit? 
  [Marcos] No. Right now the conditions do not exist. We 
thought they were since the committee had been noticing the 
withdrawal of soldiers, but their departure was not confirmed. 
Reports from our front line indicated that (the soldiers) were 
not leaving. Later we received reports that they were coming 
through another place. Since there was no movement in the rest 
of the country, we figured out that it was just the same 
soldiers moving from one place to another. 
  "Thus far, the situation has not changed. Colosio's slaying 
was the pivotal factor in the suspension of the talks. We said: 
There is the perfect excuse. Seemingly, it is now when it is 
becoming clear that it is not our fault, and there is an 
internal government plot. We can hold the talks with that 
(military) tactic in place so long as they do not have a legal 
basis to attack us..." 
  [LA JORNADA] Is it true that you met with Camacho Solis a 
few 
days ago? 
  [Marcos] No. I have not seen Camacho since the talks, and it 
is not true that he has sent any secret communiques. If he did, 
they have not arrived. We have not heard from Camacho since the 
talks. He was awaiting the results of the talks. We went along 
with the process; then Colosio was assassinated, and the whole 
thing was suspended. We had heard he was coming (to Chiapas). 
However, I have not had any contact with him, either written, 
public, or secret. 
  [LA JORNADA] Why are they saying that? 
  [Marcos] The government is waiting to see how the situation 
evolves. Colosio was their alternative in the negotiations. 
After Colosio's death, they must readjust to decide what they 
will offer or negotiate. 
  [LA JORNADA] Under what conditions will you resume the 
dialogue and come down to the cathedral? 
  [Marcos] In order to resume the dialogue, some military 
conditions must exist. One is that the Army reduce its 
presence. Another condition is a decrease in aggression -- at 
least until the dialogue is resumed -- on the part of the 
cattlemen, businessmen, and the political class. This 
aggression seemed to come mainly from the municipal presidents 
and the cattlemen. Obviously, Salinas' resignation would be a 
welcome sign. 
  [LA JORNADA] Is it true that you want to speak to Zedillo? 
  [Marcos] No. I have never said... I could give you some 
advice on how to write textbooks, but I never said that. The 
committee has not held a meeting since it was appointed, and it 
is very possible that it will not support any of the candidates. 
  "I had already given up on the idea of the candidates coming 
here. We will not invite them anymore, but we are willing to 
talk with a representative. For that matter, we are willing to 
talk with any representative. What truly matters to us is that 
they come here because if something happens to them, if a plane 
crashes... What I have said is that we are willing to talk 
with any candidate, but I did not think they would come because 
if something happened to them, they would blame us. Seeing as 
how Colosio was killed, we can expect anything to happen to any 
other candidate."

<F P=106> [Communique issued by Mexico's Clandestine Indian </F>
Revolutionary Committee-General Command of the Zapatist Army of 
National Liberation (EZLN) in Mexico on 10 April: "Emiliano 
Zapata Will Not Die by Decree: EZLN"] 
  [Text] To the people of Mexico, 
  To the world's peoples and governments, 
  To the national and international press, 
  Brothers: 
  The Clandestine Indian Revolutionary Committee-General 
Command of the Zapatist Army of National Liberation hereby 
addresses you to say the following: 
  Today, 10 April 1994, marks the 75th anniversary of General 
Emilio Zapata's assassination. An attempt was made to drown his 
cry of Land and Liberty! through the betrayal of Venustiano 
Carranza. Today, the usurper Salinas de Gortari, the 
self-described "president of the Mexican republic," lies to the 
Mexican people, saying his reforms of Article 27 of the 
Constitution reflect the spirit of Gen. Zapata. The supreme 
government is lying! Zapata will not die over such a haughty 
decree. The right to land for those who till that land is 
irreversible, and the war cry of Land and Liberty! still has not 
found rest in these Mexican lands. Under the blanket of 
liberalism that has darkened our lands every peasant who fights 
for his agrarian rights is jailed and murdered. Salinas' 
reforms to Article 27 of the Constitution represent a betrayal 
of the fatherland, and the usurper of federal executive power in 
Mexico should be prosecuted for this crime. 
  Brothers, today is the 100th day of the new dawning of our 
voice; from the mouths of the rifles of faceless men and women 
spoke the voices of landless peasants, farm workers, small 
landowners, and Mexican Indians. The voices of those who have 
nothing and deserve everything had to follow the path of their 
smallest men, the most humiliated, the most persecuted, the most 
forgotten. The voices of true men spoke for the Mexicans who 
are dispossessed of their lands, dignity, and history. 
Everything seemed lost during our people's long night. The 
land gave nothing but pain and death, but 10 years before this 
day certain good people sowed in our grieved land the hope that 
true men would return to life. The seed of their words found a 
good place to be born in the Mexican mountains. Their silence 
was cultivated. Their passage was night which turned to day. 
  At the dawning of our cry of "Enough!" the land yielded the 
fruits that had been sown. Instead of grief, anger was born; 
instead of humiliation, dignity emerged; instead of regrets, we 
reaped weapons. Thousands of men and women unearthed, from the 
very land that only gave them poverty, the tender fire that 
would fill their hands; they covered their faces, erased their 
pasts, left behind their names and lands and followed the steps 
of war. None of us men and women of nocturnal passage will have 
a tomorrow. There will never again be peace for our yearnings. 
Never again will our bones and blood have rest. 
  For whom are these men and women walking? Who drinks their 
blood? For whom is the light in their words? Who will gain 
life from their death? One hundred days. Ten years. Whose 
hands, besides those of the men and women who cannot be here 
with you today, will pick up the flag their blood tore from the 
hands of the powerful? Who will fall in with their dignified 
stride? Who with them, with us, can speak with only a look, a 
voice and fierce tenderness? Who cries out with us? Who does 
not abandon us? Who struggles with us? Who listens to our dead? 
  Not the usurper, who sells his pride at the National Palace. 
That pride is not the pride he sells to us. It is not pride 
that is murdering us. It is not pride that is dispossessing us. 
It is not pride that humiliates us. 
  You do, brothers. For you, our blood. For your night our 
timid light. For your life our death. Our war for your peace. 
For your ears our words. Your grief, brothers, will seek 
relief in our struggle. For you everything, brothers; for us, 
nothing. 
  Brothers, before you, in that palace where lies reign 
today, lives he who denies us and whom no good person has asked 
to be there. The powerful gentleman who snatches our lives away 
everyday should leave. He must go, brothers. His voice should 
not be a mandate for us. Nothing good comes from his doors. 
There are lies in his face and deceit in his words. He must 
go, brothers. This is the cry coming from the mountains; this is 
what our blood is saying; this is what our dead are requesting. 
He must go. Tell him that, brothers: He must Go! 
  Let no one else arrive at that palace you have in front of 
you if it is not by the mandate of the others; he who sits in 
that chair must give orders while obeying; he who speaks from 
that balcony must have the truth in his words; he who calls 
himself our chief must be that while obeying. Tell him that 
this, brothers, is what we want. 
  We cannot be with you on this day, brothers; our steps 
follow 
the night into the mountains; our faces are still gagged, and 
our words are very distant. Take us for one moment, Mexican 
brothers! Give us your voices a moment and allow your mouths to 
speak our words. At this very instant, in the mountains of 
southeastern Mexico, thousands of men and women who have been 
rejected, who have no names or pasts are reviving in their 
chests the first cry of the beginning of the year. Our hearts 
are happy, because Emiliano Zapata has come again, in your 
steps, to the square [zocalo] in Mexico. We, small and 
forgotten, raise the image of Zapata in the other heart of the 
fatherland: the mountains of the Mexican southeast. 
  Cheers, Mexican brothers! Let our cry be yours: 
  Long live Emiliano Zapata! 
  Death to the supreme government! 
  Freedom! 
  Justice! 
  Democracy! 
  Respectfully, from the mountains of the Mexican southeast. 
  Clandestine Indian Revolutionary Committee-General Command 
of 
the Zapatist Army of National Liberation. 
  Mexico, April 1994.

<F P=106> [Report by Jaime Guerrero; from the "Early Morning" </F>
newscast; passages within quotation marks are recorded] 
  [Text] President Salinas said that reforms to Article 27 of 
the Constitution do not mean the privatization of the Mexican 
countryside. Issuing property titles for the peasants' land is 
an act of justice, not an act of alienation. He also said that 
ejidos will not be privatized. 
  [Salinas] "These titles mean justice, not alienation." 
  He pointed out that two years after Article 27 was amended, 
only 38 of the 30,000 Mexican ejidos have requested the full 
issuance of property titles to become part of the real estate 
market. 
  [Salinas] "Urban areas are already surrounding those 38 
ejidos. Without property titles, their prospects, as Agrarian 
Prosecutor Arturo Warman already said, would include only 
expropriation or, even worse, invasion and loss of their own 
legacy." 
  Salinas pointed out there currently is a sound possibility 
of 
overcoming poverty and neglect in the countryside. In short, 
the validity of Article 27 was discussed. 
  [Warman] "We did not find any reason to revise Article 27 of 
the Constitution." 
  Prosecutor Warman said that a reform to Article 27 would 
constitute a setback; in addition, the reform lacks the support 
of the majority of peasants. He added that only minority groups 
are requesting modifications to the article. He also talked 
about Chiapas and rejected that legal large estates are 
predominantly in the hands of a few individuals. 
  [Warman] "We will continue to search for legal large 
estates, 
but I believe that we will find very few." 
  Warman submitted to the president his second report on the 
works of the Agrarian Prosecutor's Office.

  [Text] Three changes were made within the PRI 
[Institutional Revolutionary Party] on 11 April. Mr. Lievano 
Saenz Ortiz left the Secretariat of Information and Propaganda 
to become the private secretary of PRI presidential candidate 
Ernesto Zedillo. Lievano Saenz has held several posts in the 
government. He was a senior officer at the Secretariat of 
Social Development, director of property and furnishings of the 
defunct Secretariat of Urban Development and Ecology, and 
general director of the Panamericana Sulphur Company [Azufrera 
Panamericana] and the Istmo Exploration Company. 
  The PRI's new secretary of information and propaganda is Mr. 
Carlos Salomon Camara, formerly the Federal District's secretary 
general of social development, a political delegate in Coyoacan, 
and commercial director of Fertimex [Mexican Fertilizers]. He 
has been a PRI member for 19 years and is a columnist for the 
newspaper EXCELSIOR and the magazine SIEMPRE. 
  Mr. Esteban Moctezuma Barragan will hold the newly created 
post of first adjunct secretary; he was a senior officer at the 
Secretariat of Programming and Budget, a senior officer at the 
Secretariat of Public Education and, until recently, deputy 
secretary of public education. 
  These appointments were disclosed by Mr. Fernando Ortiz 
Arana, president of the PRI's National Executive Committee, who 
swore in the three new appointees. Mr. Ortiz Arana stated the 
following about the three appointees: 
  [Begin Ortiz recording] They will give credit to the rules 
that have governed their conduct in the many positions they have 
held. They have personal and political honesty, integrity, 
intelligence, and a determination to serve foremost the causes 
of the Mexican people. [end recording] 
  The brief ceremony was also attended by Mr. Ignacio Pichardo 
Pagaza, the recently appointed PRI secretary general.

    [Editorial Report] Mexico City Canal 13 Television Azteca 
Network in Spanish at 0530 GMT on 7 April broadcasts a live or 
recorded 120-minute interview with Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, 
presidential candidate of Mexico's Party of the Democratic 
Revolution, PRD, during the "Let Us Speak Clearly" call-in 
program hosted by journalist Lolita de la Vega. 
  After a brief introduction and a video clip of Cardenas' 
biographical data, de la Vega begins receiving calls from people 
shown on video who are identified by caption. 
  She asks Cardenas if his party agrees with some of the 
ruling 
party's policies, to which he replies: "We may agree in certain 
areas." He says: "we are pleased with the initiation of the 
negotiations in Chiapas, which in our opinion was necessary. 
Fortunately, the government sought negotiations to prevent a 
military resolution to the Chiapas conflict. We are also happy 
to see inflation is under control. We recognize the 
government's positive steps, but it is also our duty to point 
out those things with which we disagree or which we believe are 
negative." 
  When a caller asks Cardenas if he is running for president 
again to serve Mexico or to satisfy his personal ambitions, 
Cardenas replies: "I was asked by my fellow party members," 
adding, "we are seeking profound changes in the country. It was 
not a personal decision. I can serve my country as a candidate, 
as a president, or as a simple citizen but will always struggle 
for democratic changes." 
  When de la Vega asks if he would be willing to invite 
members 
from other parties to participate in the changes he proposes, he 
says: "Yes, of course. The only condition is that the person 
should have a real commitment to make democratic changes, should 
be someone known for his desire to serve, should have a proven 
honor, capability, knowledge, and, as I said, a willingness to 
make changes and to serve the country." 
  Concerning corruption, de la Vega asks what actions he would 
take to ensure dishonest officials would be punished; he says: 
"Certain mechanisms would have to be implemented, because as it 
is the comptroller general's office does not function, because 
it is both judge and defendant." He adds "this position should 
be in the hands of the opposition." 
  Regarding his approach to tackle the problem of 
unemployment, 
he says: "I see the country's reconstruction as a joint effort 
of many forces, not just of the government, private enterprise, 
or workers. I believe private enterprise, workers, and the state 
can work together to achieve common objectives. We all want to 
create jobs, to increase production, to improve productivity, to 
have better salaries, more purchasing power, more tax revenues, 
more investment funds." He adds: "We must use our resources. 
I believe one of our main acts should be to reactivate our 
energy policy, to build electricity plants, to develop our oil 
industry, to improve our highway system." 
  In response to a caller who asks him what would be his first 
steps to separate the executive and judicial branches, Cardenas 
says: "First of all, through a different policy; in other 
words, by effectively complying with the law and the 
Constitution and not by interfering with or intervening in areas 
where we are not supposed to. The president should not go 
beyond his constitutional and legal capacity. We should 
effectively advance to guarantee the autonomy among the 
government branches. I am confident the next Congress will be 
different, because the majority of deputies and senators will 
not owe their election to the president." 
  A caller asks Cardenas if he fears an attack similar to 
Colosio's by members of his own party; he says: "No, much less 
from within my party." 
  Cardenas is asked what he would do to resolve extreme 
poverty, especially among Indians throughout the country. He 
says: "We must spend more funds for this purpose and realize 
the problem of poverty is affecting more than 50 percent of the 
country's population; that is, more than 40 million Mexicans." 
He adds: "We must encourage employment, better salaries; this 
cannot be done overnight, but we must make great efforts to 
revert current practices, to strengthen the educational system, 
and to improve our health system." 
  A caller from Monterrey asks if he plans to unify health 
service and improve salaries of professionals in the health 
sector. Cardenas says: "We must make a great national effort, 
both economic and political, to improve the salaries of all 
workers." He adds: "How? Through a better distribution of 
expenses, making better use of the country's resources, and by 
managing those funds better." 
  De la Vega asks Cardenas what he thinks would be the best 
solution to improve salaries; he says: "We must generate 
economic activity, jobs, and better salaries." Asked to be more 
specific in explaining his economic policy, he says his economic 
proposal is "making the economic policy more social; in other 
words, we must realize economic measures affect the people, 
their standards of living, job opportunities." He adds: "We 
will have to reduce interest rates, make our banking system more 
efficient, create a climate of confidence for domestic and 
foreign investors, and create the conditions to strengthen our 
markets." 
  When asked why there should be international observers in 
the 
elections, he replies: "We believe if there is nothing to hide, 
there can be observers both from inside the country and from 
abroad who can contribute to cleaner elections, which is a 
national demand that has become stronger after Colosio's death." 
  A caller from Mexico City asks Cardenas what actions he 
would take against the mafia and manipulation of the public 
through television stations. He replies: "I believe it is 
absolutely necessary to open new opportunities in television, to 
create the possibilities of opening television stations at 
universities and higher centers for education, stations handled 
by community organizations, opening more opportunities for 
artistic creativity, for the film industry." He adds: "We 
believe it is necessary to break the monopoly in the country, 
specifically concerning Televisa, as it is unfair for one 
station to have excessive coverage, which is what is happening 
today." 
  When asked by a caller: "What lesson did all Mexicans get 
from the problem in Chiapas?" Cardenas answers: "It showed us 
there are problems of misery, arbitrariness by authorities, land 
evictions, a lack of democracy, elections that are not held. 
Those problems must be attacked at their roots. I believe this 
is one of the main lessons we have received from the Chiapas 
conflict, which also indicates what the solutions are: If we 
attack misery, strengthen the productive sectors in that region, 
if we end arbitrariness, we will surely prevent a similar 
problem in Chiapas or any other part of the country." 
  De la Vega continues to read letters received from viewers. 
She reads a letter from a Mexico City viewer who asks: "What 
is your opinion of Subcommander Marcos?" 
  Cardenas replies: "We do not know much about him. He is a 
fighter. He is definitely a fighter who defends his ideas. He 
risks his life for his ideas and the people in whom he believes 
and those who believe in him. We respect that position. We 
have followed different paths in the hopes of solving similar 
problems or reaching similar goals. We hope we will have the 
opportunity to meet him during a future visit to Chiapas. 
Perhaps we can sit down and talk and exchange views so that I 
can have more firsthand information on what he wants and what we 
can do to contribute to a stable peace in Chiapas and throughout 
the country." 
  De la Vega then asks Cardenas what he will do for retirees. 
Cardenas says: "We have suggested increasing pensions. During 
the first phase of the plan we would like to increase them to at 
least the minimum wage. We hope to later increase pensions to 
the same salary the retired person earned while he was working." 
  De la Vega reads a letter from listener Rene Ortiz who asks: 
"If the PRD wins the elections, what kind of a cabinet will you 
have?" Cardenas answers: "With people from the various 
political forces that support a democratic change," adding 
"honest people who will honor their commitments. It will be a 
pluralist government." 
  De la Vega then asks: "Do these people have a name?" 
Cardenas responds: "In certain cases I can say yes, and I hope 
I will be able to disclose those names shortly." 
  An unidentified speaker then asks Cardenas about Mexico's 
economy and "how he plans to solve those problems?" 
  Cardenas says: "We have already said how we would solve 
certain problems. As I said earlier, productive investment must 
be boosted. We must stress job creation. We must reduce 
interest rates and make loans more accessible so that more 
investments can be made." Cardenas goes on to say: "We must 
improve our road systems and build hydroelectric plants. The 
construction industry must serve as a guide toward economic 
recovery. That is what we must do to ensure the economy will 
begin to recover, but everyone must contribute to this. We need 
the help of the businessmen, the state, and workers." 
  Caller Juan Villagran asks Cardenas about changes to the 
Constitution. The caller wants to know if Cardenas agrees with 
the changes made. Cardenas responds: "We do not agree state 
education is no longer free. I believe this is something we 
must reinstate. Only elementary and high school education are 
free today. I believe if the state is funding education, all 
education, from kindergarten to the university, should be free. 
We oppose other changes to the Constitution. We are against 
changes made to Article 16 of the Constitution. This change 
grants the Attorney General's Office the right to be judge and 
jury. This office no longer needs a warrant issued by a judge 
to arrest someone. We also oppose changes to Article 27, 
because with these changes the people lose their right to demand 
land that is in the hands of large landowners. These large 
landowners have land that surpasses the amounts legally allotted 
to one person. We oppose these changes and believe a review of 
these changes would be appropriate and more changes made." 
  De la Vega reads a letter from viewer Elina Perez Gomez who 
asks: "Mr. Cardenas, are you aware you have provoked violence 
in our country? If you love Mexico and the memory of your 
beloved father, you would not do the things you do. There are 
mercenaries of war, and I believe you are involved with them." 
Cardenas responds: "I do not agree with that opinion. We are 
not seeking violence; quite the contrary, we have been victims 
of violence. The PRD has lost more than 250 members. We do not 
want more violence, and this is precisely why we are struggling 
for a change in the country." 
  Viewers continue to ask questions on education and the PRD's 
plans for those women who head households. Cardenas says: "We 
want to offer these women the many rights and services the state 
can offer. For example, they should have equal rights when 
requesting a home; they should not be discriminated against when 
requesting a job. They should also have the opportunity to 
train for specific jobs so they can provide for their children. 
That is what we must do." 
  Another viewer comments on the issue of ideological violence 
and asks: "Don't you think that with your way of being you 
contributed to Colosio's assassination?" Lolita de la Vega 
says: "That is terrible." Cardenas replies: "I do not believe 
I did." De la Vega says: "I am sure you did not." 
  De la Vega continues to read letters sent in by viewers. A 
viewer from Veracruz wonders where Cardenas will get the money 
the Mexican people need. He wonders if Cardenas will borrow the 
money as other presidents have done. Cardenas answers: "No. 
We will have to work with a budget. We can only spend what we 
receive." De la Vega asks: "What if that is not enough?" 
Cardenas responds: "We must find a way. We must better 
distribute our resources. We must boost production. We must 
ensure greater production, resources, more taxes." De la Vega 
says: "But the people will not like the idea of more taxes." 
Cardenas responds: "Not higher taxes. We need to get more 
people to pay taxes. It does not mean we will increase the 
taxes for those already paying taxes." 
  An unidentified caller asks Cardenas about his plans to 
promote foreign investment in Mexico. Cardenas replies: "As I 
said earlier, we must bring back trust and create the necessary 
conditions for foreign investment to return to Mexico. Foreign 
investment must be mainly in the production sector. It should 
promote new projects that will create new jobs." Cardenas 
continues to say this is possible with "an honest government, a 
government that does not accept bribes and commissions, a 
government that does not demand a share in investment, a 
government that will treat everyone alike and give advantages to 
those who wish to come to the country and take the risk to help 
the country progress." 
  Again on the topic of women, Cardenas is asked about his 
plans for women should he win the elections. Cardenas 
reiterates women should have the same rights as men to an 
education and a job. He adds many people must understand the 
rights of women must be respected. Cardenas adds: "We must be 
aware women will need special work schedules. We have made 
women responsible for the care of children, old people, and the 
sick, and something must be done to help them." 
  Lolita de la Vega then asks Cardenas how many women 
candidates for the Senate his party will nominate, and he says 
at least 30 percent of the nominees will be women. When she 
asks why only 30 percent when women constitute 52 percent of the 
Mexican population, Cardenas responds: "Because we are 
advancing slowly. There are parties which do not even have that 
many women candidates. This is a first for the PRD, and I hope 
we will be able to do this. It is often not easy to find people 
to work with." 
  A caller asks Cardenas about differences between the 
political platform he had when he was a PRI member and his 
current platform. Cardenas replies: "If you read the two 
platforms carefully, you will find that there are not too many 
changes." "This platform states the need to make democratic 
changes; the need to build a democracy in the country." 
Cardenas continues: "The only difference is that we are 
opposed to corporate unions and corruption. We want a pluralist 
government. We believe in changing political and economic 
policies. We believe in seeking other social opportunities. 
That is the basic difference between the two platforms." 
  Asked about the budget he plans to allocate for education, 
Cardenas says: "We must strengthen the budget for higher 
education. We have said that the education system should receive 
at least 8 percent of the budget, but it would be great if we 
could allocate more than 8 percent." 
  Regarding the loan U.S. President Clinton made to Mexico the 
day after Luis Donaldo Colosio was assassinated, Cardenas said: 
"It was done to save the country's economy. It was to keep our 
currency, which is already weak, from falling. The U.S. 
Government undoubtedly gave political aid to the Mexican 
Government. That is the existing relationship between the two 
governments, and I hope that this help, whenever it is positive 
help, will continue once another administration assumes office." 
  Lolita de la Vega reads the final question for the evening: 
"Will you accept the elections results even if you lose? 
  Cardenas responds: "The important thing is that we have 
clean elections in the country. This is not something we should 
see only on election day. We must begin to see it today. If 
observers are allowed to come and observe, if all political 
parties have access to the data on the electoral lists, if we 
see that mistakes in the electoral lists are corrected, then we 
will see that the conditions are right and that there is a 
willingness to guarantee that the results are accurate. At that 
point we will all have to admit that they were clean elections. 
These changes, however, must begin right now. They cannot wait 
until the last day. It is a process that takes months to 
conclude."

<F P=106> [Report by Wilmer Murillo] </F>
  [Excerpts] Mexico City -- Mexican President Carlos Salinas 
de Gortari and Costa Rican President Rafael Angel Calderon 
yesterday signed a treaty that establishes a free trade zone 
between the two countries. [passage omitted] 
  The Free Trade Agreement [FTA] covers issues such as access 
to markets, norms of origin, agriculture, technical hours, 
phytosanitary issues, protection measures, disloyal actions, 
government purchases, investments, services, intellectual 
copyright, and settlement of controversies. The agreement will 
allow a better flow of trade and investments, and it will entail 
growth and welfare for the two countries. 
  According to political and business leaders, this is the 
most 
advanced agreement signed to date between two Latin American 
nations; and it will have particularly beneficial effects for 
Costa Rica, whose trade balance with Mexico has a 90-million 
colones deficit. 
  Certain Mexican newspapers said the treaty was not timely 
and 
prompted by the two countries' political interests. 
Nevertheless, the deep emotion that prevailed during the 
ceremony where the document was signed proved the need to 
reassert historical and cultural ties with Latin America after 
joining the great northern trade bloc -- NAFTA with Canada and 
the United States. 
  Samuel Yankelewitz, president of the Chamber of Industries, 
emphasized the treaty is very technical and includes all the 
necessary elements for things to work correctly. Although he 
admitted it was certainly necessary to hasten things because the 
current administration is about to end, he warned that things 
were done correctly despite the haste. This resulted in a fair 
and balanced treaty for the two nations. 
  Doris Osterlof, executive director of the Chamber of 
Exporters, referred to this issue and said businessmen are ready 
to face the challenge of competing with the Mexicans. "We have 
an industry that is ready because we have experimented and 
competed in the Central American market for 30 years. Now our 
industry will expand its limits to the Mexican market," she said. 
  According to Costa Rican businessmen's estimates, the 
country 
may quintuple its current exports to Mexico in five years -- 
from 60 million colones to 250 million colones. 
  Carlos Alvarado, president of the Chamber of Commerce, 
announced that businessmen began their contacts this week to 
attract foreign investments from Costa Rica to Mexico. 
  The Mexican and Costa Rican stock exchanges signed an 
agreement after the FTA was signed, opening the market to new 
financial opportunities; and the International Bank of Costa 
Rica (BICSA) announced it will open a new support office in 
Guatemala to study the possibility of going to Mexico. This way 
the bank can continue to support everything dealing with foreign 
trade, BICSA Vice President Arturo Cuevillas noted. 
  According to official sources, the FTA signed yesterday will 
allow investments in Costa Rica to increase by approximately 10 
billion colones. The possibility is a result of the attraction 
Costa Rica will have as a point of access to a market of 90 
million people. Mexican businessmen will be able to install 
their factories here and export to their country. Currently 80 
billion colones, approximately 8 percent of the GDP, in Mexican 
capital has been invested here. 
  Meanwhile, businessmen from other countries who are seeking 
access to the Mexican market through the tariff advantages that 
the agreement grants products manufactured in Costa Rica, will 
be able to do so. Hitachi, National Batteries, Ticatex, Cocoa 
Products, and Salas Lizano are included in that category. 
  The agreement foresees the immediate elimination of tariffs 
for 70 percent of the Mexican exports; for 20 percent in five 
years; and for 10 percent in 10 years. Also, 75 percent of 
national exports will be cleared immidiately; 15 percent will be 
cleared in five years; and 10 percent will be cleared in 10 
years. 
<H5>  [Box, p 12A] </H5>
  The Mexican authorities accepted last minute changes to the 
FTA, allowing Costa Rica the possibility of exporting 5,000 tons 
of powdered milk per year to that country." Meanwhile, "Mexico 
will be able to freely export condensed and evaporated milk to 
Costa Rica.

  [Text] San Jose, 12 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- Costa Rican Foreign 
Minister Bernd Niehaus highlighted today the process of 
strengthening political, commercial, and cultural relations with 
Chile. 
  Niehaus made this acknowledgment while awarding the Juan 
Mora 
Fernandez Order, the highest award given by Costa Rica to a 
foreign representative, to Chilean Ambassador Benjamin Maluenda, 
who is ending his diplomatic term in Costa Rica. Niehaus 
underscored "Chile's will to further its close and constant 
cooperation with Costa Rica and, especially, the sense of honor 
with which it has conducted its foreign policy regarding our 
country." 
  The foreign minister reviewed the deep roots of friendship 
that unite both nations "since the dawn of our independence in 
1821." He recalled Costa Rica's debt to Chile in the fields of 
health, culture, and education. Many Costa Rican nationals have 
gone to Chile to study, and, "today, they serve our country with 
the knowledge they acquired in that great nation." Niehaus 
acknowledged the benefits obtained by Costa Rica "when thousands 
of Chilean exiles came to give us their knowledge in 
universities, the theater, and other fields of culture. We also 
render homage to the Chile that has been returned to its sons, 
the Chile that has always been democratic and independent, the 
Chile of the quiet heroes who held their heads upright when they 
faced despotism, the Chile that gives its word and keeps it, the 
Chile that shakes your hand and keeps it firm," the foreign 
minister stated. 
  The Chilean ambassador expressed gratitude for the 
distinction and said it marked the wonderful relations between 
both countries, which "continually grow stronger to our mutual 
benefit." Chile and Costa Rica march on different roads, but 
toward a similar destiny of prosperity, democracy, solidarity, 
understanding, and firm friendship, the South American diplomat 
stated.

<F P=106> [Interview with President Ramiro de Leon Carpio by reporter </F>
Juan Luis Font at the Presidential Palace in Guatemala City on 6 
April -- first two paragraphs are introduction] 
  [Text] It is the first Wednesday of April at 2200, and the 
Presidential Palace is full of people. President Ramiro de Leon 
Carpio has been talking for more than one hour with a delegation 
from the private sector, among whom are Peter Lamport and Victor 
Suarez. It appears the give and take on tax reform--seen by the 
government as salvation from the financial chaos in which it 
finds itself--still have a long way to go. In the Room of 
Mirrors more than 30 union leaders are waiting for the 
government's last proposal to end the two-and-a-half-month old 
bureaucratic strike. Via the president's private telephone 
line, the deputies are requesting a midnight meeting to discuss 
the implications of this afternoon's attack on Obdulio 
Chinchilla. 
  The economic difficulties, the confrontation with the 
public, 
the new acts of violence, which have added to the air of 
xenophobia, and the murder of the Constitutional Court president 
all seem to indicate a slowly simmering plot and an urgent need 
for a state of emergency. The stew of the crisis is on the 
verge of boiling over now, and the president has his back 
against the wall. 
  [Font] It appears someone is bent on forcing the suspension 
of guarantees. 
  [De Leon] There are many theories on the origin of violence. 
One of these points to a group which wants to destabilize the 
government, create anarchy, and force me to decree a state of 
emergency. 
  These sectors believe a suspension of guarantees would bring 
benefits, but they do not realize if this is decreed we would 
utilize the full extent of the law. Our security forces would 
be ready to operate efficiently. We are already prepared should 
this occur. 
  [Font] If the government is prepared to take action in a 
state of emergency, does this mean the decision to implement 
this state of emergency is imminent? 
  [De Leon] Every president can count on this resource. I do 
not rule it out. 
  [Font] Why did you decide to postpone the measure? 
  [De Leon] Because it has its disadvantages. Our security 
forces do not have enough training to act in these 
circumstances. Meanwhile, the state of emergency would interrupt 
the legislative election process. In addition, our image would 
suffer internationally. 
  [Font] Could the UN Verification Commission, which was 
recently agreed upon with the guerrillas, carry out their duties 
with suspended guarantees? 
  [De Leon] Probably not. It is possible the liberties granted 
to the Verification Commission in the agreement with the 
guerrillas, such as unrestricted access, would be restricted in 
this case. The subversives could use this as a pretext not to 
fulfill the agreement. 
  [Font] You only mentioned specifically the guerrillas as one 
of the sectors that could be interested in putting you up 
against the wall concerning a state of emergency decree. Who 
are the others? 
  [De Leon] The sectors that after 30 years of war still have 
not understood democracy is the best road for the nation. 
  [Font] Are there members of those sectors in the Army? 
  [De Leon] No, not there. Outside the Army it is possible, 
not inside. 
  [Font] You have given a greater role to the Army than your 
predecessors in formulating your government policy. 
  [De Leon] No. I have not given a greater role to the 
military than other governments. To which officers are you 
referring? 
  [Font] It is said the center of power revolves around the 
Presidential Staff chief and the G-2 [military intelligence]. 
  [De Leon] Many things are said. It is also said Finance 
Minister and Presidency Secretary Ana de Molina has all the 
power, or that Foreign Minister Martiza Ruiz is the 
superminister. Both are excellent government officials. This 
is the case of Colonel Otto Perez Molina. He is a leader within 
the Army, and, of course, he had power because he is near the 
president. 
  [Font] Is that why he is establishing your government 
strategies? 
  [De Leon] He does have some degree of participation in 
defining government policy, but it is limited to certain areas. 
So much is being said, but a president needs his team. 
  [Font] Why did you appoint Colonel Mario Alfredo Merida, 
former military intelligence director, as the deputy government 
minister? 
  [De Leon] I need him to coordinate the security forces. He 
is a brilliant and very capable officer, and the people are 
demanding security. 
  [Font] Doesn't that mean the military is gaining greater 
influence within your government? 
  [De Leon] The Army did not suggest the appointment, nor did 
they impose him upon me. I asked him to take a job in which he 
will he extremely useful to me. His experience and the kind of 
information he handles make him the best possible coordinator I 
could have for the security forces. Military cooperation is 
needed now. The Armed Forces and I agree on the need to 
demilitarize the public security system, but there must still be 
a transition period from one state to the other. 
  [Font] First, you appointed a completely civilian security 
team. What made you change your mind? 
  [De Leon] I realized we had made a mistake. We tried 
cutting off military participation in matters of public security 
completel but we were unable to do this. I realize this could 
be seen as regression, but I do not mind. I am sure I will lay 
the foundations for a professional civilian security force. 
  I avc not given the military more participation than other 
governments have, as you charged. What I did do was consolidate 
the Army's institutionality. That, I did manage to do. I feel 
fully in control now. The current military leaders back the 
president, and they have a very clear picture about my 
government's objectives and their commitment to democracy. 
  [Font] Most people believe, however, removing General Jose 
Luis Quilo Ayuso has also created division within the 
institution, between those who believed in him and those who 
follow you. 
  [De Leon] No one questioned my decision to remove Gen. 
Quilo. One does not question an order in the Armed Forces; one 
obeys it. Quilo's outburst was an understandable reaction to his 
discharge. 
  [Font] Many say you are a dubious and undecided president 
who has let things get out of hand. 
  [De Leon] There are very few who say I am dubious and 
undecided. When I tour the countryside, even here in the city, 
people always tell me encouraging things in the street. If the 
polls say my popularity is slipping, we must remember no one has 
ever received a country in worse condition than I did. 
Furthermore, I have not exactly chosen the easy way of solving 
problems. 
  [Font] You and your government have been criticized for 
being slow to react to the Constitutionality Court president's 
death, for example. 
  [De Leon] It is unfair to say the government or the 
president was late in reacting to the death of Chief Justice 
Gonzalez. Barely minutes after the incident we put all our 
resources into motion to investigate the crime and protect his 
family. I went to the funeral, and almost all the cabinet 
members were there. 
  [Font] The investigations do not seem to have produced any 
results. Will international experts be called in to resolve the 
case? 
  [De Leon] I understand the desperation caused by an 
unresolved political crime, such as the Epaminonda Gonzalez 
case, but we do not plan to bring in international experts to 
conduct investigations. 
  Violence is the country's most difficult problem I have had 
to face. Certain people have asked me to act stronghandedly, 
knowing this cannot be done. We must act in accordance with the 
law. Under current circumstances, with a judicial branch as the 
one we have and the kind of Congress we have had thus far, what 
do you expect me to do? 
  I cannot promise I will stop violence, as first I would have 
to resolve the problems that cause it. After so many years of 
social injustice, I hope to lay down the foundations for future 
solutions. 
  [Font] Are you concerned about rumors the U.S. Embassy has 
reinstated an old plan to evacuate U.S. citizens should there be 
more violent actions against them? 
  [De Leon] There is a xenophobia in Guatemala that has even 
reached the U.S. Embassy. The media should help eradicate that 
xenophobia, which has become another method of destabilization. 
  [Font] On another subject, at the current pace it seems by 
the end of your presidential term the economic crisis will be 
worse than now. 
  [De Leon] No. We will straighten out public finances. We 
will achieve our goals in tax revenues and social investment. 
For the first time in many years, 28 percent of the budget will 
be invested in the country. We are working in the country's 
interior, although you may not see it. 
  [Font] Why have you found it so difficult to implement tax 
reforms? 
  [De Leon] Who says it has been difficult? Only a short 
while ago we started evaluating, together with the private 
sector, the tax reform options recommended by the economic 
cabinet. 
  [Font] Don't you believe you are making too many concessions 
to the private sector? 
  [De Leon] Of course not. If for any reason whatsoever I have 
taken my time in approving the tax reforms it is because I want 
to take the necessary precautions so as not to affect the people 
and to ensure those who can afford to pay more taxes. 
  [Font] Will you be the president who sells off state 
property? 
  [De Leon] I plan to be the president who breaks up 
monopolies whenever necessary, privatize whenever it is 
necessary, and sell off state property whenever it serves to 
benefit consumers and modernize the country. I do not plan to 
do it just to get rid of any debt but, rather, to reorganize the 
state. 
  [Font] Are you willing to end monopolies and privatize in 
exchange for the private sector being willing to pay more taxes? 
  [De Leon] There is no on-going negotiation between the 
private sector and the government leading to tax reform in 
exchange for privatization. Decisions related to ending 
monopolies and privatizing were already included in the 
government's agenda when I began my administration. If anyone 
has any doubts, they simply have to check out the documents we 
published at the time. This process is going to take place 
openly. 
  [Font] Do you agree with the concept of fiscal crime? 
  [De Leon] I do. I believe certain minimum penalties could 
ensure more efficiency in the process of tax collection. 
  [Font] Concerning the rapprochement between the executive 
branch and Congress, can this be interpreted as a political 
understanding that eases the way to the approval of new laws? 
  [De Leon] No. There is no other agreement between the 
government and the political parties except that which was 
signed before the bishops. 
  [Font] Do you feel the people appreciate you? 
  [De Leon] I feel misunderstood by a vast majority of the 
public. 
  [Font] How do you want to be remembered? 
  [De Leon] I want to be remembered as an honest president who 
combated corruption and achieved peace. 
  [Font] What assets have you declared? 
  [De Leon] Two homes, my office, my bank accounts, and my 
wife's Antigua farm and home. The house from which I escaped 
through the roof on 25 May was rented, but I am going back to 
live there. 
  [Font] Do you consider yourself a daring president? 
  [De Leon] Yes, but I have my own style. I do not go boasting 
about it like others. I play chess, and I venture to play on 
several boards at the same time. 
  [Font] Do you consider yourself as daring in your private 
time? 
  [De Leon] I can tell you that several days ago I was 
swimming 
in the turbulent waters of the Pacific. I like to climb 
mountains. Nevertheless, I would say in my private life I do not 
run so many risks. 
  [Font] What dictatorial action tempts you? 
  [De Leon] I would like to resolve the nation's violence. 
  [Font] How did you react to problems as a child? 
  [De Leon] I always faced them. My mother insists I never 
told lies. 
  [Font] Invalidation of the preliminary hearing against you 
infers something else. 
  [De Leon] It does not. Invalidation of the preliminary 
hearing against me is irrelevant. I was surprised by this 
action and not at 
all happy the deputies put me in the same boat as the others. 
Besides, the preliminary hearing against me is based on a 
ridiculous accusation of human rights violations, given the hike 
in electricity rates. 
  [Font] Do you fear the coming months? 
  [De Leon] Not at all, the coming months will be difficult 
but 
not insurmountable. I am sure, thanks to the measures we are 
taking, the force of order, the force of a government that is 
not weak, will be felt. 
  [Font] With an electoral process on the doorsteps, it is 
easy 
to assume the violations will be heightened in the coming months. 
  [De Leon] We are at the end of three decades of political 
and 
common violence. Following the signing of the agreement with 
the guerrillas two weeks ago we are very near to securing peace. 
The road we still have to cover is very thorny. To that, one 
must add violence, which an electoral process always generates. 
I am well aware of all of this, but I believe this will be the 
last breath of violence in Guatemala, but what can I do? The 
people approved the legislative elections in a referendum.

  [Text] Nicaraguan Vice President Virgilio Godoy Reyes this 
weekend agreed with Daniel Ortega's opposition to the national 
economy adjustment agreement. On Sunday, Godoy Reyes and 
Daniel Ortega both said on local radio stations that street 
violence may erupt if the government implements the economic 
measures scheduled for this month. Godoy, however, did not say 
whether UNO [National Opposition Union] will support such 
protests. The Sandinist National Liberation Front, which has 
always supported violence, says it will support these events. 
  Ortega and Godoy agreed the economic measures are very harsh 
and might prompt disturbances. The leadership of COSEP [Higher 
Council of Private Enterprise], through its president Ramiro 
Gurdian, said the measures should be implemented as the only 
real solution to Nicaragua's economic problems.

that the implementation of economic adjustment measures will 
provide financing for the agriculture and production sectors. 
Lacayo, while visiting several communities in La Trinidad, 
Esteli Department, where he inaugurated several projects, said 
the agreement with the IMF should definitely be signed. Lacayo 
has said on previous occasions that with or without the support 
of the Sandinist National Liberation Front, the adjustment 
agreement should be implemented. He has also characterized 
Daniel Ortega's objections as political populism.

  [Text] The Panamanian Government has issued a formal 
protest to the U.S. Government over recent statements that 
Panama is not cooperating enough in the struggle against drug 
trafficking and money laundering. 
  Jose Raul Mulino sent a four-page letter noting that the 
U.S. 
statements are general and subjective. He added that the 
Panamanian Government has taken many actions to fight those 
crimes. 
  In the document, Mulino says that Panama is not an economic 
power and on many occasions it has had to establish it 
priorities. Regarding the struggle against drug trafficking, our 
cooperation has been expeditious and in good faith. 
  Mulino asked for a meeting at the highest level, with the 
participation of the financial sector, to discuss this problem. 
  The letter clearly states that the national government has 
not eluded its responsibility.

  [Text] Ruben Dario Carles, Change '94 presidential 
candidate, said during an impromptu news conference in the lobby 
of the Europa Hotel yesterday that "the U.S. Government has 
authorized drug trafficking and money laundering in Panama for 
some years now." He also said "the charges against Panama are 
unfair." 
  Carles acknowledged "money laundering is taking place in 
Panama more so now than during the past regime." 
  According to Carles "this activity belittles the country's 
image throughout the world." According to Carles "President 
Guillermo Endara's administration has ample means to defend 
itself from the attacks imposed by U.S. policies." 
  Carles said "we Panamanians cannot accept the U.S. charges, 
but we must condemn the performance of certain court officials, 
judges, district attorneys, the Prosecutor's Office, and certain 
institutions responsible for curbing drug trafficking." 
  Regarding the discrediting of certain Panamanian 
organizations involved in the struggle against money laundering 
and drug trafficking, Carles said "we must improve the tarnished 
image of official institutions by implementing measures aimed at 
ensuring officials' performance so as to prevent them from 
submitting to this illegal activity."

April that, pursuant to an agreement reached on 12 April in 
Tunisia between Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella and Palestinian 
leader Yasir 'Arafat, the Palestinian Liberation Organization 
(PLO) will open "an affairs bureau" in Buenos Aires within a few 
months. 
  According to the talks held on 12 April between Di Tella and 
'Arafat, when the PLO achieves statehood, thanks to the historic 
peace agreements between the Israelis and Palestinians, the 
bureau may become an embassy, with the appropriate powers. 
  The establishment of an "affairs bureau," a diplomatic 
status 
below that of an embassy, has been an old goal of the Arab 
community in Argentina. After President Carlos Menem -- of 
Syrian ancestry -- was inaugurated in 1989, the Arab community 
in Argentina again favored this measure. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] (DYN-NA) -- President Carlos Menem yesterday [12 
April] rejected the possibility of an agreement between the 
Justicialist Party and the Frente Grande [Grand Front, FG] on 
constitutional reform at the Constituent Assembly and also 
judged unlikely an alliance between the Radicals and the 
opposition front. 
  Provisional Senate head Eduardo Menem pledged that the 
government will respect the Olivos Pact on reform signed by 
President Menem and Radical Party Chairman Raul Alfonsin after 
FG head Deputy Carlos "Chacho" Alvarez suggested that the 
agreement should be set aside. Democratic Progressive Party 
Deputy Alberto Natale also urged the Radicals to "open up the 
Olivos Pact package." 
  Alfonsin warned that a campaign to "distort" the contents of 
constitutional reform had been launched and said that it would 
be "disappointing if Alvarez joins in." 
  Alfonsin described Alvarez' call on the Radicals to abandon 
the points agreed on by the Olivos Pact "absurd." 
  Menem, who denied cabinet changes, told a local radio 
station 
that the government was "on the alert" for a possible alliance 
between the FG and the Radicals and accused Deputy Jesus 
Rodriguez -- who is promoting the idea within Alfonsin's party 
-- of having an "ancestral hatred for Peronism." 
  But Menem defended Alfonsin, who has come under fire from 
anti- reform sector's within his party. "Alfonsin stood up in 
what is a difficult moment for Radicalism," Menem said. 
  The head of state said that the Justicialist Party will 
stick 
to the Olivos Pact and that it would only seek agreements with 
the pro-reform provincial parties and not with the centre-left 
Frente Grande. 
  On the same day the President denied that the Peronist 
defeat 
at the hands of the FG in the Federal Capital could trigger a 
Cabinet reshuffle, Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo told a local 
radio station that Sunday's election result should be seen as a 
triumph for the government. [passage omitted]

in the Federal Capital in Sunday's election claimed its first 
head yesterday [12 April] as candidate Matilde Menendez resigned 
from her newly won seat at the Constituent Assembly. 
  There was no word at press time whether the Peronist 
candidate planned to resign as well from her post as president 
of the PAMI [Comprehensive Medical Assistance Plan] pensioners' 
health care service. 
  Menendez, under fire since a bribery scandal involving PAMI 
erupted in late February, said in a letter to the local branch 
of the Justicialist Party that she had never been one to cling 
"either to candidacies or to personal political ambitions." 
  She said she was stepping down to concentrate on setting 
"the 
actions under investigation." [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Buenos Aires, 12 Apr (NA) -- With the goal of 
resolving the crisis being experienced by his province and 
forestalling federal intervention, Jujuy Governor Jose Carlos 
Ficoseco asked tonight for a six-month leave of absence. This 
will allow the appointment of a replacement, with the agreement 
of the other provincial parties. 
  According to remarks made tonight by Interior Minister 
Carlos 
Ruckauf, the new provincial governor will emerge from an 
agreement among the ruling Justicialist Party, the Jujuy Popular 
Movement, which won the 10 April elections, and the Radical 
Civic Union. At the government house Ruckauf announced that the 
legislature will meet tomorrow to appoint Ficoseco's replacement 
and begin the province's political recovery. 
  Ficoseco made his decision to ask for a leave of absence 
after meeting at the government house with Ruckauf and 
presidential Secretary General Eduardo Bauza. [passage omitted] 
  Nevertheless, the possibility of tipping the balance in 
favor 
of an intervention, following an escalation of the conflict in 
the province after unending protests by the state workers labor 
union and other labor unions, has not been ruled out. The 
government source placed the possibility of an intervention on a 
"stand-by" status. 
  Ficoseco's "elegant" departure cools down Jujuy's overheated 
situation, even though the social situation experienced by this 
province remains very critical, and might have serious 
consequences.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 12 Apr (EFE) -- Official sources 
reported today that the deficit in the Argentine trade balance 
increased by 328.6 percent during January of this year as 
compared to January of 1993. In January imports added up to 
$1.5321 billion while exports exceeded $946 million. 
  The figures released by the National Institute of Statistics 
and Census (INDEC) of the Finance Ministry shows that the trend 
that began in the middle of last year has increased. 
  Economic Programming Secretary Juan Llach announced these 
figures during a news conference. He said the trade deficit 
increased during January because of climatic problems that 
affected export- quality agricultural products and postponed 
agricultural exports. 
  Llach stressed the importance of the growth in capital goods 
imports, which increased by 98.8 percent compared to the same 
month last year. 
  Llach said that the figures also show an increase in 
investments, which is positive for the economy. 
  According to the INDEC report, the purchase of fuels 
increased by 140.6 percent, the purchase of intermediate goods 
by 26.4 percent, spare parts and accessories for capital goods 
by 36.5 percent, consumer items by 23 percent, and passenger 
vehicles by 46.5 percent. 
  The figures confirm that Brazil is the main purchaser of 
Argentine exports, with a total of $188.9 million. The United 
States comes second with $108 million. 
  The United States, in turn, heads the list of countries that 
sell to Argentina. Argentina imported a total of $410 million 
worth of goods from the United States. Brazil is second on the 
list, selling for a total of $285.4 million worth to Argentina. 
  The United States, Brazil, Germany ($113.4 million), and 
Italy ($102.6 million) account for 59 percent of the country's 
total imports during January. 
  Argentina's trade exchange (exports plus imports) with its 
three Common Market of the South (Mercosur) partners -- Brazil, 
Uruguay, and Paraguay -- reached $615.1 million in January, or 
23.8 percent of the country's total, and a 29.8 percent increase 
compared to the figures registered in January of 1993. 
  The exchange with the United States, Mexico, and Canada -- 
the three NAFTA partners -- also increased by 61.3 percent, 
reaching a total of $554.3 million during January. 
  The export of Argentine products to NAFTA member countries 
increased by 31.1 percent during January compared with the same 
period of 1993, while imports from the United States, Mexico, 
and Canada increased by 72.6 percent. 
  The INDEC report says that Argentina's exports to Mercosur 
member countries increased only by 9.5 percent, while imports 
from these countries increased by 50.2 percent.

  [Text] La Paz, 30 Mar (LOS TIEMPOS) -- Sources linked to 
intelligence offices in the Government Ministry and the Special 
Antinarcotics Force (FELCN) reported today that a reactivation 
of the subversive Tupac Katari Guerrilla Army [EGTK) 
organization has been detected in the last few days in three 
departments. 
  The sources told LOS TIEMPOS in La Paz that the subversive 
group that was broken up in 1991 resumed its terrorist 
activities in La Paz, Cochabamba, and Sucre by calling for armed 
insurrection in various rural districts. 
  They said this subversive organization "plans to act with 
greater force" in La Paz and Cochabamba Departments, and that 
the signs of subversive activity "are the writing on walls seen 
by state intelligence in the two departments' rural districts." 
  They indicated that the EGTK, in contrast to other guerrilla 
organizations with similar characteristics such as the Nestor 
Paz Zamora Command (CNPZ) or the Zarate Willka Armed Liberation 
Forces (FAL-ZW), "still have ideological leaders because not all 
of them were arrested by the intelligence organizations." The 
sources added: "An example is the recent capture of Victor Poma 
after three years. He was accused of terrorist activities and 
actions against state security." 
  The EGTK began subversive activities on 4 July 1991 when it 
blew up two high-tension pylons in El Alto's Alto Lima area. 
  This terrorist action lead to the death of one of its 
members 
and was the beginning of a series of subversive acts against 
state security, which later led to the arrest of its main 
leaders. The intelligence organizations then arrested brothers 
Raul Garcia and Albaro Garcia, and Felipe Quispe, alias "El 
Mallku," who are currently in the high-security Chonchocoro 
prison. 
  The sources said Victor Poma's arrest is the beginning for 
the arrest of Carlos Lara, who has been identified as one of the 
EGTK "general staff" members and is currently a fugitive from 
justice.

  [Text] Guadalajara -- After meeting with the creditor bank 
committee, Central Bank President Pedro Malan said on 12 April 
he is "confident about conclusion of a debt agreement" on 15 
April. The meeting was prompted by the banks' concern that 
Kenneth Dart, a U.S. entrepreneur who bought 3.5 percent ($1.4 
billion) of the Brazilian debt and who refuses to accept the 
agreement's terms, may take action to prevent the conclusion of 
the agreement. 
  Washington's Arnold &amp; Porter lawyers, a firm advising 
the 
Central Bank in the negotiations with the bankers, warned 
Brazilian authorities about the possibility of Dart's trying to 
obtain a preliminary court decision suspending the exchange of 
financial certificates through which the agreement will take 
effect. "We have several lawyers at work in New York," Michael 
Degraderied said on 8 April. A Citicorp executive, Degraderied 
chairs the bank committee. Citibank Vice President William 
Rhodes said Dart will not be able to prevent the agreement. 
  Brazilian authorities do not believe Dart will attempt to 
impede the deal's implementation. But the government has taken 
several precautions because it has not ruled out the possibility 
of Dart taking legal action after the agreement's conclusion. On 
12 April, while issuing the Bank of International Settlements 
(BIS) an order to transfer approximately $2.8 billion in U.S. 
Treasury certificates -- which will serve as initial collateral 
for the agreement, the Central Bank took care to prevent the 
certificates from being seized by an eventual legal embargo. 
  In New York, Dart spokesperson Melissa Krantz said the 
entrepreneur maintains his opposition to the agreement's terms. 
In order to avoid problems, Brazilian Ambassador Paulo Tarso 
Flecha de Lima consulted in Washington with the White House and 
the State Department about the possibility of the Clinton 
administration invoking the International Economic Emergency 
Powers Act [preceding five words in English] if Dart attempts to 
impede the agreement. 
  Dart -- In Brasilia, the Central Bank said that if Dart 
refuses to participate in the exchange of bonds, it will issue a 
regulation allowing the use of the old certificates being held 
by Dart for the purchase of state-run companies.

  [Text] Brasilia -- Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero on 12 
April said private sector workers who earn a minimum salary will 
be entitled to receive bonuses throughout the next months. The 
measure will not benefit either public employees or retired 
workers. The bonus proposal, which will be presented next week 
to President Itamar Franco, was the solution the government 
found to improve the minimum wage without causing impacts on the 
social security system and the accounts of states and 
municipalities. With this proposal the government expects to 
convince Congress not to establish a $100 minimum wage. Ricupero 
disclosed that he accepts negotiating Provisional Measure [MP] 
No. 457 as long as it does not affect the budget balance and not 
change the conversion of salaries based on the peak exchange 
rate variation [of the previous four months]. 
  According to Ricupero, the economic team is negotiating with 
Congress the article of PM No. 457 that forbids the 
readjustments of contracts established in URV's [Real Value 
Unit] for periods shorter than a year. The idea, Ricupero said, 
is to find a midpoint between the current strict rule and the 
stability the economic team seeks for the economic plan. 
  The minister still is concerned about the foreign debt 
renegotiation agreement, which will be signed 15 April. Ricupero 
said the government still faces difficulties in convincing the 
Dart family, which holds $1.4 billion of Brazilian foreign debt 
titles, to accept the renegotiation terms approved by the 
creditor banks' steering committee. Ricupero disclosed that he 
will not travel to the United States on 15 April to sign the 
agreements. Central Bank President Pedro Malan will go in his 
place. "I cannot leave the battlefield right now without being 
certain of our triumph," Minister Ricupero said. 
  The minister reasserted his strategy to give absolute 
priority to the approval of MP No. 457. He wants it to be 
approved before the end of the month. He asked for some credit 
from Congress, workers, and business people, and more 
consideration for the stabilization plan. "It would be 
incomprehensible that the other economic plans, which were 
authoritarian, should have been approved and that this one, the 
first democratic economic plan, be distorted before proving its 
merits," he said.

<F P=106> ["Highlights" of "exclusive" interview with Finance Minister </F>
Rubens Ricupero by reporters Clovis Rossi, Jose Roberto Campos, 
and Demian Fiocca at the FOLHA DE SAO PAULO offices on 9 April] 
  [Text] [FOLHA] Considering that the economic plan has no 
surprises, packages, etc... 
  [Ricupero] Nor adjustment tables, freeze, nor bank holidays. 
  [FOLHA] Why not make an earlier announcement of the exact 
date for putting the real into circulation? 
  [Ricupero] Because there is no such date. If possible, I 
will make the announcement earlier than 35 days in advance. I 
will try to report the date as early as possible. You know I 
never lie in my remarks to the press. I can say that it is 
absolutely sure that there is no such date. Sonia Mossri, a 
FOLHA reporter in Brasilia, has been reporting for weeks that 
the date is 1 June. I don't know how she reached that 
conclusion, because there is absolutely no date; no secret 
decision has been made. We have not picked any date because we 
are in a complex transition stage. For example, we have to look 
at the issue of utility rates. This week we will begin with 
mail rates, but we will need the entire month of April and part 
of May, because it is an immense universe. We are now drawing 
up the decree on public contracts. We should allow private 
contracts to adjust themselves. Negotiations between the 
industrial and commercial sectors are in some areas much slower 
than in others. In areas like that of meat, negotiations began 
earlier but are going more slowly. 
  [FOLHA] In the negotiations between the wholesale and retail 
sectors, it is possible to see that there is more disagreement 
than accord. Isn't there the risk that this transition stage 
will last too long? Considering that the MP [Provisional 
Measure] provides for up to 360 days for adoption of the real, 
negotiations could continue for an indefinite period. 
  [Ricupero] What I can say is even rather obvious: The real 
will be adopted neither too early nor too late. It must be 
adopted within a reasonable period, because we cannot wait too 
long, as we would then be running the risk that you mentioned. 
We want to feel the pulse of the market. Facts like the one 
you mentioned will be relevant in making a decision. Yet there 
are still things to be resolved, like monthly school fees, for 
which no guidelines have yet been issued. We will be doing it 
in the immediate future. Contrary to what has happened on other 
occasions, we are trying to have economic agents find the 
balance themselves. Yet people expect the government to make 
all the definitions. Society has sort of a vice, as it expects 
the government to define everything. 
  [FOLHA] Taking into account this complexity, isn't there a 
risk that the need to adopt the real will make the government 
issue sort of an adjustment table, as not all contracts have 
been adjusted, that is, because the entire economy has not 
already adopted the URV [Real Value Unit]? 
  [Ricupero] No. I have never heard anything about that. We 
are still confident that the adjustment will be made. In FOLHA 
DE SAO PAULO I read the opinions of Joao Sayad, Luiz Paulo 
Rosemberg, and others, noting that it is necessary to move 
faster. We must have definitions also in other areas, like 
currency, the backing of the currency, the adoption of an 
exchange rate index that can or cannot be fixed. We are trying 
to very carefully measure the pros and cons of those options. 
Yet the process, which is gradual, can become the target of 
such criticism. You have the traditional experience of the 
fight against inflation and hyperinflation, especially in 
Central Europe, which resolved the problem overnight on the 
basis of a fixed exchange rate. In the case of Austria, 
inflation collapsed within 48 hours, but at an astronomical 
price. 
  [FOLHA] Despite the fact that the government advised that 
the inflation rate would drop only after adoption of the real, 
many people believed that adoption of the URV would produce a 
drop in inflation. However, exactly the opposite is happening. 
  [Ricupero] I am aware of that. I have noticed that there is 
such a concern. In my opinion, this involves a communications 
problem. The best way to avoid this risk, which is real, is to 
make an additional effort at communication. One of the things I 
have felt during these first days of work is the need to give a 
better explanation of the meaning of the plan. Yet I would like 
to add that my concern does not focus only on the plan, in the 
short term. I am also concerned about structural matters for the 
medium and for the long term. I am sure that within the short 
term, the plan will yield very positive results. After adoption 
of the new currency, the inflation rate should significantly 
drop. 
  Now, we have never concealed that stability is only a first 
stage for reactivating economic growth with new patterns. 
Economic growth should include both the social and the 
environmental cost, something that we did not do in the past. 
To this end it is essential to reform the structure, that is, 
the Constitution. It is necessary to resolve the problem of 
lack of coordination between the branches of government. I have 
said that if we had to identify the two main Brazilian problems, 
the Social Security system would be one of them. In my opinion, 
this subject will be the great distortion of the next few years. 
We might be the only country that has placed all Social 
Security regulations in the Constitution. There is also the 
federal system, the three levels, the conditioning of budget 
allocations, and the transfers. Everyone demands additional 
spending reductions, but when we deal with the budget, it is 
rigidly maintained. All revenues go to salaries, transfers, and 
conditioned allocations. Only a 7 to 8 percent parcel remains 
available. 
  It is a situation in which the country cannot move. I have 
just read a paper by Professor Jose Pastore showing that the 
cost of creating a job in Brazil is much higher than in any 
European country. The only country that is close to the 
Brazilian cost is France. As the cost of creating a job is very 
high, entrepreneurs prefer not to create jobs. They resort to 
overtime work, or else shift their activities toward the 
informal economy or toward middlemen. Take the example of the 
minimum salary. I met with the congressional committee that is 
studying the provisional measure. They insist on their idea of 
raising it to $100. I also believe it is fair to set the 
minimum salary at $100, but to do this it is necessary to amend 
the Constitution, making the minimum salary no longer 
conditioned on the Social Security system, allowing for the 
adoption of minimum salaries in each region. 
  [FOLHA] Yet hasn't the executive branch been slow as far as 
making proposals for the constitutional revision is concerned? 
Don't you think it is very naive to expect the constitutional 
revision to succeed? 
  [Ricupero] I am doing my best, and I will continue to do so. 
The constitutional revision does not affect me, as I will remain 
in this position for only a few months. Even if the 
Constitution were amended in May, I would not get any benefit 
from it. The problem will be for the new president. I see no 
reason for not doing the revision right now. If this is not 
accomplished, it is necessary to make sure that after the 
government changeover the conditions will be appropriate for 
continuing the work. 
  [FOLHA] Are you in favor of an exclusive constituent 
assembly? 
  [Ricupero] My best friend since I was in school, Fabio 
Konder 
Comparato (a jurist), favors this idea. I have already told him 
that my doubts lie in how to elect the members of that assembly. 
If members are elected with the same distorted rules of 
representation, I do not see many differences with the current 
constituent congress. 
  [FOLHA] The economic plan was made by a presidential 
candidate. Don't you think that most of the difficulties that 
you will have will stem from this fact? Don't you feel directly 
responsible for the victory or the defeat of Fernando Henrique 
Cardoso? 
  [Ricupero] I will begin by answering the second question. I 
am not committed. I am a friend of Cardoso just as I am a 
friend of people in all parties, even in the PT [Workers Party]. 
I am a public servant, I have never been anything else, and I 
do not intend to be anything else, either. I am really 
independent. My commitment is to stabilization. We want a 
dynamic economy so that our country may recover from the 
heritage of four centuries of slavery. 
  [FOLHA] In 1986 you worked with then President Jose Sarney, 
at the time of the cruzado, which was considered a major 
electoral fraud. Some people now say the same thing, that the 
economic plan was made to promote the election of Fernando 
Henrique Cardoso... 
  [Ricupero] I believe this interpretation is wrong for 
several 
reasons. The first is the premise that if the plan had not been 
made, it would have been possible to continue with a routine 
policy until the end of the year. I believe the pressure that 
has already accumulated over Brazil's inflation is so heavy that 
we would have had to face very serious situations that might 
have even jeopardized the atmosphere for elections in our 
country. We are in a complicated situation and, even with the 
plan, we have a difficult journey ahead of us. 
  If the economic plan did not exist, I believe the problems 
that would have accumulated by the end of the year would not 
have allowed the maintenance of such routine policy. To speak 
the truth, there was no choice. If we did not have this plan, 
we would probably have brought forward the elections or adopted 
just as important a measure. Second, we are doing everything 
necessary to stabilize the economy. But everything does not 
depend on us alone. Many decisions depend on the legislative or 
judicial branches, or on the state or municipal governments, or 
on other institutions, like public companies, in which case the 
responsibility is ours. If the legislative branch does not 
approve these essential constitutional reforms we are 
suggesting, you cannot accuse me of committing an electoral 
fraud. Besides, I would like to hand over the Finance Ministry 
with a more solid budget situation. But in order to attain this 
we depend on structural reforms we cannot control. Incredibly, 
this economic plan is considered by [former Finance Minister] 
Mario Henrique Simonsen as the best ever made. That is the 
general opinion about it, here and abroad. This plan belongs to 
everybody. In an editorial, FOLHA DE SAO PAULO stated that I 
exaggerated in the speech I gave at my swearing-in ceremony. I 
said that every citizen must consider the economic plan his own, 
and an untransferable responsibility. But I confirm what I 
said. FOLHA DE SAO PAULO is wrong, because no plan in the world 
can be successful if the citizens do not engage in it 
personally. To think that the plan has an automatic effect is 
an illusion. If FOLHA DE SAO PAULO has a better idea it should 
suggest it, because I do not know it. As for the economic plan, 
it is mine now. Of course the plan cannot be separated from 
those who contributed to its preparation; this is the case over 
the entire world. A government is recognized by its success. 
That is the case of Menem in Argentina. He will be reelected 
because he did things well. Such is the logic of a political 
dispute. People vote according to the merit of the public lives 
of their politicians. I think the candidates themselves must 
prove they have better alternatives. 
  [FOLHA] It is natural that President Franco should want 
someone from his own administration to succeed him. In order to 
attain this happy ending, he could perhaps resort to some kind 
of magical solution for the economy... 
  [Ricupero] I am committed to defending the budget balance 
and 
the economic plan guidelines. That is why my dialogue with the 
members of the congressional committee that is examining the MP 
has been difficult. The changes they want to implement will 
distort the plan. The plan must be given at least a chance to 
be tested in practice. 
  [FOLHA] Does this mean that the MP is not at all negotiable? 
  [Ricupero] To accept negotiation over it implies that the 
plan is not perfect. So far, nobody has demonstrated its 
imperfections. For example: They spoke about salary losses. 
Salaries were converted into URV's based on the average 
exchange rate and, as Simonsen says, the average is at an equal 
distance from the floor and ceiling peaks. To convert the 
salaries based on the peak exchange rate is absurd. This is not 
an imperfection but a difference of opinion. If you defend 
salary conversion based on the peak rate, and I defend the 
conversion based on the average rate, we will disagree until the 
day of the final judgment. If you are stronger, you will defeat 
me, and I will go home, and then you can govern the country by 
converting salaries based on the peak rate. 
  [FOLHA] But that second hypothesis does not exist. If 
Congress turns down the conversion of salaries based on the 
average rate, you can go home, but Congress will not govern... 
  [Ricupero] That is the point. At some moment, I do not mean 
now, we will have to make the other government branches 
responsible for their actions. This situation in which you have 
power and not responsibility is one of the reasons for which we 
are the only country on the American continent that has not 
defeated inflation. Nowadays even Russia is curbing inflation. 
Why is this happening here? Is it because of some genetic 
degeneration, or is it because we have an institutional problem? 
I believe the media has a lot of responsibility in this; it is 
incoherent. I think some of these newspaper columns of short 
notes are regrettable. No newspaper in the world has three 
columns of short notes, each one serving a different intriguing 
interest. There are people who earn a living by inventing news 
in a column. 
  [FOLHA] Going back to the economy, has the backing of the 
real currency been defined? 
  [Ricupero] Partly. The reserves will back it partly, but we 
must define to what extent, and if any other kind of backing 
will be necessary. We are considering different options 
regarding the date the new currency will be put into 
circulation, the backing it will need, and the exchange policy. 
  [FOLHA] Some economists defend the principle that in order 
to 
prevent the new currency from being born contaminated, a fixed 
exchange rate will be necessary for at least some time... 
  [Ricupero] That is one of the ideas that is being analyzed. 
They all have advantages and disadvantages. It is not true that 
the historical background should point in that direction (the 
dollar/real parity). Chile, for example, has been very 
successful with the establishment of a fixed exchange rate. In 
my opinion Chile is the most evident case of successful economic 
adjustment in Latin America. I will not say Chile is an example 
for Brazil, because it represents only 10 percent of the 
Brazilian economy. But it is nonetheless an example of success, 
because it managed to stabilize without problems its balance of 
payments, maintaining a good export capacity without a fixed 
exchange rate. I am not establishing a position. In Latin 
America you can find successful experiences both with a fixed 
exchange rate, as in Argentina, and without a fixed exchange 
rate, as in Mexico and Chile. None of these solutions is 
transferable on its own. There is hardly any alternative. If 
there were, we would have announced it already.

  [Text] Brasilia -- On 15 April, Brazil will conclude an 
agreement with private creditor banks and exchange the old debt 
certificates for renegotiated debt bonds. This will give Brazil 
30 years to repay the principal, which amounts to $45 billion, 
of which $35 billion is owed to foreign banks, and $3.8 billion 
is "fresh money" -- from previous agreements -- loaned after 
1983. The rest is owed to Brazilian banks abroad. 
  The new bonds, which will be issued by the national 
Treasury, 
are like promissory notes that will be delivered to creditors in 
exchange for the old promissory notes the country failed to 
honor. Those promissory notes will be transformed into six new 
types of bonds: discount, parity, temporary interest reduction, 
capitalization, conversion, and "fresh money" bonds. However, to 
implement the exchange, Brazil tomorrow will have to present 
$2.8 billion in guarantees of a total of $4.6 billion. The 
balance will be paid over a two-year period in six-month 
installments. 
  In order to calculate the total renegotiated amount, the 
Central Bank added all public sector debts -- overdue and about 
to fall due -- plus $28 billion that state institutions already 
have paid to foreign creditors but has remained deposited at the 
Central Bank. This has happened since 1983, when the debt crisis 
began, and when the country had few international reserves and 
could not make any payments. That money will be transferred to 
the Treasury, which may use it only for reducing the domestic 
debt, which in February stood at $48 billion. The government has 
not decided yet how this payment will be made. 
  According to Central Bank technicians, with the new 
agreement, the foreign debt will stop being a problem because 
the government will be able to schedule the payments. 
Technicians believe that by that time, the country will have 
reached economic stability, a condition that will facilitate the 
repaying of obligations owed to international creditors.

  [Text] Brasilia -- The Brazilian Government on 12 April 
broadened the discount rate range applicable to foreign debt 
bonds used by foreign banks to purchase shares of state-owned 
companies being privatized. The standard 25 percent discount 
off the face value of debt bonds has been replaced with 
discounts ranging from 25 to 35 percent, depending on the type 
of bond involved. Bonds and contracts alone pertaining to the 
agreement that will take effect on 15 April total $52 billion. 
  According to Central Bank [BC] sources, creditors have thus 
far used only $90 million of their credit in privatization 
auctions. The creditor banks have claimed that the discount rate 
on debt securities is very high. The creditors do not seem to 
have confidence in the Fernando Henrique Cardoso-2 Plan. 
  A BC resolution provides that of the new bonds to be issued 
on 15 April, par bonds will be converted into shares with an 
initial discount of 35 percent. This rate will gradually 
decline until dropping to zero in 30 years. 
  Foreign debt bonds converted into shares of privatized 
companies may not be repatriated over a six-year period. 
Profits and dividends earned on these shares may be freely 
taken out of the country. Brazilian companies that purchased 
debt bonds may not convert them into shares of privatized 
companies. 
  The National Comptroller General extended from 31 March to 
29 
April the deadline for rescheduling fiscal debts registered as 
standing debts of the federal government.

<F P=106> [Article by Claudia Safatle] </F>
  [Text] The government is preparing an ingenious solution to 
the problem of privatizing the state-owned companies of the 
electric energy producing area that belong to the federal 
government, without having to depend on the approval of the 
draft bill on franchises. This draft bill has been languishing 
in national Congress drawers. 
  The solution consists of dividing the Brazilian Electric 
Power Company, Inc [Eletrobras] into two companies by separating 
what is a typical government function from what can be exploited 
by the private sector. 
  A provisional measure accompanied by a report on the reasons 
for this proposal -- which was signed by Mines and Energy 
Minister Alexis Stepanenko, Planning Minister Beni Veras, and 
former Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso -- has been 
under study at the Finance Ministry Executive Secretariat. The 
idea is to send this proposal and the studies, as soon as 
possible, to the presidency of the Republic, which will then 
send them to the national Congress. 
  The proposal to divide Eletrobras into two enterprises -- 
Eletrobras Participacoes (Eletropart) and Eletrobras -- resulted 
from studies made by the Eletrobras technical team, the National 
Bank for Economic and Social Development, and the Mines and 
Energy Ministry. The objective of these studies was to 
privatize the field of electrical energy, which yields an 
overall $15 billion per year. Half of this amount is produced by 
the companies owned by the federal government. 
  Eletropart would have control over the shares of Furnas 
Electric Power Plants, Inc., Sao Francisco Hydroelectric 
Company, Southern Electric Power Plants, and Northern Electric 
Power Plants, and would be able to open its capital and sell the 
shares of these companies at the stock market of [unfinished 
sentence as published]. 
  This proposal changes the government concept of 
privatization 
only through the sale of physical assets. According to 
government sources, this system would represent a sort of 
"socialization of capital" of the federal state-owned companies 
in the electrical energy field. 
  The provisional measure that would make this possible 
establishes that all Eletrobras areas that have functions 
typical of those performed by the government will remain with 
the company that will retain this name. Such will be the case 
of the Electrical Energy Research Center, the planning and 
coordination areas, the nuclear energy enterprises, and the 
Itaipu Binational Enterprise. Eletrobras would continue to 
manage two companies that are already in the privatization list: 
the Light and Power Company and Escelsa (Espirito Santo State). 
  According to official sources, the current text of the 
proposed provisional measure would receive a favorable report 
from jurist Fabio Konder Comparato. It has still not been sent 
to the presidency of the Republic because of the recent 
installation of a new finance minister. As a result, the 
Finance Ministry Executive Secretariat is late in examining this 
new privatization model. 
  Another contribution this model could bring to the 
privatization of the federal state-owned companies in the 
electrical energy field would be to make biddings unnecessary. 
The draft bill on franchising for the exploitation of the 
energy field by private sector companies makes biddings 
mandatory. Privatization through the sale of shares and the 
system of share control would not alter the franchise contracts. 
  The privatization program has been dragging on, and the 
companies producing electrical energy represent nowadays the 
most attractive companies in the hands of the federal government 
unless constitutional monopolies become more flexible. The 
government has been keeping this provisional measure secret, at 
least for the time being, so as not to have to face corporatist 
reactions from employees of the electrical energy producing 
companies. 
  Official sources believe that this proposal is, therefore, 
an 
effort to preserve the field and to create the required 
conditions to finish construction work that has been paralyzed 
for lack of resources.

  [Text] Federal Police have begun to break up the Nigerian 
cocaine connection. Police believe that nearly a metric ton of 
cocaine per year still leaves Brazil and is taken to Nigeria. 
Following a year of investigations, Federal Police unveiled the 
daring African cocaine trafficking scheme. 
  The drug leaves Bolivia, is sold in Sao Paulo for $5,000 per 
kilo, and then is taken by the traffickers to Lagos, Nigeria. 
There, it is worth $17,000 per kilo. From Lagos, the cocaine is 
taken to Switzerland, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and 
Canada, where a kilogram of cocaine can reach the price of 
$60,000. 
  Given the Nigerian cocaine trafficking route, all passengers 
on the weekly flight to Lagos are filmed in the airport. 
Suspects are followed day and night by police. The tactic has 
worked. Since the beginning of the year, Federal Police have 
arrested 14 drug traffickers red-handed in Guarulhos 
International Airport, Sao Paulo, and confiscated 100 kg of 
cocaine from them. 
  The confiscations reveal that the Nigerians are experts in 
camouflaging the drug; for example, drugs can be hidden inside a 
spray can that, like this one, can conceal up to 300 grams of 
cocaine. Cocaine also was found in the inner soles of tennis 
shoes. Drug traffickers normally create double-bottom suitcases. 
Nigerians go further. The whole structure of this suitcase is 
pure cocaine that, mixed with a resin, has been shaped into a 
suitcase. The most difficult way to detect cocaine, but also the 
most dangerous for the drug trafficker, is cocaine capsules. 
Nigerians can swallow up to 60 capsules at once. They thus use 
their own body to hide the drugs.

<F P=106> [Report by Vera Lima from Manaus, Amazonas State] </F>
  [Text] The Amazonia Military Command [CMA] is monitoring a 
Venezuelan operation against gold prospectors at the 
Venezuelan-Brazilian border. The operation seeks to destroy 
clandestine airfields. 
  In an official communique, the CMA reports that it was 
informed in advance of the operation by the Venezuelan Army. 
The communique notes that the Venezuelan Air Force is trying to 
destroy clandestine airfields in the Alto Quieto and Alto Ocamo 
townships, adjacent to the Brazilian border. 
  The communique adds that this operation has been planned 
since late March. At that time, 36 gold prospectors who had 
been illegally prospecting in Venezuelan territory were turned 
over to Brazilian authorities. 
  The CMA states that there are no reports of damage in 
Brazilian territory as a result of an air strike that took place 
in Venezuelan territory on 8 April. The CMA believes the 
Venezuelan authorities are just exercising their legitimate 
sovereign rights.

  [Text] The 3d Helicopter Squadron has joined the Navy's 
effort to patrol rivers in the Amazon region. Captain Napoleao 
Bonaparte Gomes, the helicopter squadron commander, said the new 
military unit is designed to strengthen the Navy's presence in 
the region that, within the context of Brazilian national 
security, remains quite vulnerable. 
  The 3d Helicopter Squadron will initially operate with five 
Esquilo helicopters equipped with machine guns and rockets. 
These helicopters will be primarily used for patrolling rivers, 
police operations, and support for communities located on the 
river banks. 
  The Navy has more than 1,000 men and seven ships -- five 
patrol ships and two hospital ships -- in the Amazon region.

<F P=106> [Article by Claudia de Souza: "South Africa and Vietnam: New </F>
Business Fronts for Brazilian Firms"] 
  [Text] Sao Paulo--The Brazilian businessmen's mission to 
South Africa, consisting of a group of 25 representatives of 
private and government-owned firms, will leave for that country 
this coming Friday. Its purpose is to explore business 
possibilities, and it hopes to find opportunities for Brazil not 
only to expand its investments and trade with that 
country--currently totaling around $300 million--but also to 
sound out the markets in neighboring countries. 
  The Odebrecht Group, for example, which is part of the 
expedition, has become accustomed in recent years to 
participating in bidding and sounding out opportunities not only 
in South Africa, where it has an office in Johannesburg, but 
also in neighboring countries that are considered promising, 
such as Swaziland and Tanzania, as well as Angola and 
Mozambique, where the group has been active in the past. 
  "This is an exploratory trip," editor Fatima Belchior was 
told yesterday by Jose Coutinho, vice president of Braspetro. 
That Petrobras subsidiary explored the possibility of building 
oil tanks in the country last year, but was unable to sign any 
exploratory risk contracts. 
  Even the approaching date for the first elections and the 
uncertainties regarding the first government of national 
integration's chances for economic and political stability are 
not diminishing the optimism of the Brazilian Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs concerning the prospects for increased business 
with that country. The head of the Trade Promotion Department, 
Minister Celso Marcos Vieira de Souza, says that even though 47 
percent of South Africa's manpower is unemployed, that fact is 
offset by other, positive indicators: a recent revival of the 
economy, with the gross domestic product expected to grow by 3 
percent this year; inflation of around 9 percent per year; and 
the willingness of the South Africans to encourage investments 
in the form of joint ventures both locally and in third 
countries. This will allow Brazilian businessmen to open new 
business fronts in the neighboring countries. The mission 
chief's schedule includes a meeting with Nelson Mandela's 
economic team. 
  The Trade Promotion Department of the Brazilian Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs is making arrangements for a similar mission to 
Vietnam, Singapore, and Malaysia in April. That delegation will 
include, among other companies, construction firms such the 
Odebrecht Group (which is already active in Singapore), the 
Maxion farm implement firm, and Petrobras, which will sound out 
the opportunities for offshore risk contracts in the region. 
Braspetro's Coutinho is not ruling out the possibility that the 
firm will operate under the risk contract system in Vietnam, 
although he feels it is too early to make any definite 
statements. 
  "Vietnam needs everything" is how Vieira de Souza sums it 
up. 
During that same visit, the Brazilian Government is scheduled to 
pick the residence where it will install its embassy in Hanoi.

<F P=106> [Article: "PF Seizes $100,000 in Counterfeit Dollars in </F>
Manaus"] 
  [Text] Manaus--Federal Police [PF] seized $100,000 in 
counterfeit dollars disguised as money belts on the legs and 
around the waists of passengers Juarez de Paula Sobrinho, 37, 
and Artemio Nunes de Souza, 49, at the Eduardo Gomes 
International Airport early yesterday morning. 
  The PF made a similar seizure on the 23d of last month when 
it found $36,000 in the luggage of passenger Eldon Barreira 
Castelo Branco, 25. In both cases, the route was the same: the 
passengers had boarded a Varig flight bound for Manaus from the 
municipality of Tabatinga, Amazonas, across the border from 
Leticia, Colombia. 
  Paula Sobrinho and Nunes de Souza were approached by police 
as they were waiting for the connecting flight to Para. Giving 
an appearance of calm, they both denied carrying anything 
illegal, but upon being searched, they were found to be in 
possession of the false banknotes. The dollars had been packed 
in bundles, each containing $10,000 in $100 bills. Paula 
Sobrinho and Nuno de Souza had covered the packages with plastic 
and attached them to their bodies using adhesive tape. Upon 
being caught in the act, the passengers told Police Chief 
Claudio Rosas that the money had been acquired in Tabatinga. As 
had been true with the dollars seized from Castelo Branco on the 
23d, the PF discovered that the almost perfect banknotes were 
counterfeit only after expert analysis. 
  Police Chief Rosas said that the two passengers must belong 
to the same gang as Castelo Branco. That gang seems to be part 
of an international scheme, since there have been other seizures 
in various places around the country. According to him, the 
dollars are probably being produced in Leticia. The Federal 
Police want to conduct a joint investigation with Colombian 
police.

Vaccine"] 
  [Text] Rio de Janeiro--Representatives of five of our 
country's scientific institutions will meet in Salvador next 
week to begin studying the possibility of using the Cuban 
vaccine against meningitis B and C and in immunization 
campaigns. The task force was appointed by the Ministry of 
Health in February for the purpose of ending the controversy 
surrounding the quality of the vaccine. "The scientists have 
carte blanche to conduct all possible investigations and 
determine the product's real rate of coverage," says Gerson 
Penna, president of the National Epidemiology Center. 
  The committee, which the ministry calls a task force, 
consists of representatives of Unicamp [Campinas State 
University], Rio de Janeiro State University, the Federal 
Universities of Bahia and Minas Gerais, and the Evandro Chagas 
Institute. Institutions involved in the controversy over the 
vaccine, among them the National School of Public Health of the 
Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz), which advocates its use, were 
excluded from the group. "In this work, there is no room for 
anyone defending an impassioned position," Gerson Penna 
explained. 
  The Brazilian ban on imports of the Cuban vaccine was the 
subject of a debate held at Fiocruz yesterday with Brazilian and 
Cuban health authorities in attendance. Epidemiologist Eduardo 
Costa accused the Ministry of Health of deliberately delaying 
purchase of the vaccine until Brazilian researchers could 
discover a similar one.

  [Text] The United Labor Confederation (CUT) has called for 
a mass meeting in March "to inform the right wing and those who 
want or intend to promote the idea of privatizing the 
enterprises of all the Chilean citizens that the workers will 
not allow the continued draining of the state so that private 
citizens can take over the patrimony of the people of Chile." 
  Arturo Martinez, the vice president of the trade-union 
organization, together with other leaders, met with 
representatives of the Copper Workers' Federation (FTC). 
  Martinez offered the support of the trade-union body for the 
petition being drafted by the FTC demanding clarity and 
penalties for those who are guilty of causing harm. 
  This leader expressed regret that the executives of the 
CODELCO [Copper Company], who are responsible for the 
administration of the enterprise, have "betrayed" the confidence 
of President Aylwin. "There is abandonment here in terms of 
concern and respect for their responsibilities." And this, he 
explained, applies to all of those who have had the 
responsibility for the management of the enterprise. "We are 
alarmed that the political right wing has seized upon this most 
regrettable fact, which will mean less money to be used to aid 
the poorest of the people, in order to renew their intention of 
privatizing the CODELCO and other state enterprises once again." 
<H5>  Atmosphere of Peace Endangered </H5>
  Martinez noted that the CUT collaborated with the 
establishment of democracy and the development of an atmosphere 
of social peace, "very frequently postponing the legitimate 
interests of the workers. But we want to warn the businessmen, 
the right wing, and the political parties that this climate of 
social peace may change if the efforts to privatize and plunder 
the national assets are continued. 
  "If the modernization of the enterprise is carried out 
without the workers, it goes against the workers," he warned, 
proposing that there be dialogue rather than unilateral 
decisions. In this connection, he noted that the FTC has 
proposed a plan for CODELCO expenditures that "the enterprise 
has not wanted to adopt or hear about. 
  "We are defending the assets of all the people of Chile. We 
will proceed through every necessary measure if we are not 
heard." He recalled that it was the CUT that "within an 
atmosphere of bullying, ousted Pinochet and his dictatorship. It 
was neither the parties nor any of the technocratic officials in 
the government who initiated the battle in 1983. It was the 
Chilean workers." 
<H5>  No Mixed Companies </H5>
  He also expressed the view that an attitude of the CODELCO 
administration favorable to privatization began when some 
services were transferred with the approval of the executives. 
"We want the next administration to discuss the modernization of 
the business with the workers, so that it will not mean mixed 
companies. We are prepared to take all the necessary steps, 
including separation of the divisions into departments, but not 
to discuss privatization or mixed companies." 
  Meanwhile, Carlos Gomez, the secretary general of the FTC, 
reiterated that the Investigative Commission of the Chamber of 
Deputies will be asked to review the situation of all of the 
divisions, the transfers to the sectors of third parties in 
particular. He stated that the CODELCO has 22,000 workers, and 
that it is a "deception of the nation" to say that the personnel 
strength has been reduced, since there are 18,000 contractors. 
He noted that there is work that has been passed on to third 
parties for two years, but has had to be returned to the CODELCO 
to be done by its employees because they are more efficient. 
  A meeting of the National Advisory Council of the FTC is 
scheduled for 2 March. At that meeting, the proposal regarding 
the future of the CODELCO will be analyzed. This document will 
be debated at the base levels and in the social entities, and 
then reexamined with a view to approval during the National 
Congress in April.

  [Text] One of the proposals the Socialist Party (PS) will 
present to the other groups included in the Concertacion 
tomorrow, Monday, calls for a transition from the present 
political system to a semipresidential system. 
  This idea is included in a document for the guidance of the 
legislative debate presented yesterday by Camilo Escalona, the 
president of the PS, on the basis of the conclusions reached at 
the plenary session of the political commission of that party 
last Friday. 
  Escalona maintained that to ensure the political stability 
of 
the country, what is needed is to bring about a series of 
changes designed, among other things, to establish "the 
presidential authority over the Armed Forces; a corrected 
proportional electoral system; a national security council with 
an advisory, rather than a tutelary, relationship to the 
president; and a parliament emanating entirely from the exercise 
of popular sovereignty." 
  With specific regard to the semipresidential system, the 
socialists are saying it is the model best suited to the 
country, taking the Chilean sociocultural reality into account. 
  This was made clear by Marcelo Schilling, the vice president 
of the PS, who explained that a semipresidential system would 
mean retaining for the president certain types of authority, 
particularly that pertaining the foreign and defense policies. 
The other policies would be left to a prime minister who, 
although he would have to enjoy the confidence of and be 
appointed by the president, would also require the approval of 
the parliament. 
<H5>  "Excellent Prospects" </H5>
  Camilo Escalona explained that the socialists will propose 
initiation of the changes in the political system during the 
first six months of Eduardo Frei's government, a period he 
termed one "of grace" for the entire administration. 
  He also said that the proposed changes have the support of 
the greater part of the public, which would mean more than 70 
percent of the citizenry. They even have the approval of the 
more liberal sectors of the opposition. 
  It is for this reason that Escalona predicted that the 
political-legislative positions of the PS will be "very 
well-received" by the Concertacion, especially since they are 
very close to the program of the government alliance. And in 
addition, the PPD [Party for Democracy] has already indicated 
that it views them favorably. 
  In any case, Escalona admitted, the approaches or viewpoints 
of each group on the scheduling and timeliness of initiating the 
changes, and also the priorities concerning them, might be 
debated tomorrow, Monday. 
<H5>  The Socialist Proposal </H5>
  The following are some of the proposals the socialists 
regard 
as essential: 
  --A civic probity law, defining the crime of trafficking in 
influence, providing for prosecution of unexplained wealth, and 
penalizing corruption of government employees and bribery more 
harshly. 
  --Elimination of the designated senators at the end of their 
terms in 1997, as well as the suspension now of their right to 
vote on substantial political issues. 
  --Establishment of a corrected proportional electoral system 
and rejection of the formula for expanding the number of 
candidates within the framework of the binomial system. 
  --Establishment of the exclusive confidence of the president 
of the Republic as a requirement for the commanders of the Armed 
Forces and the forces of law and order. 
  --Renewed sponsorship of the interpretive law allowing 
removal of the obstacle represented by the 1978 Amnesty Law in 
the realm of human rights.

  [Excerpt] Tomorrow, Monday, the Chilean Air Force expects 
to receive the first two CASA [Spanish Aircraft Manufacturing, 
Inc.] 212 light transport planes purchased recently from Spain. 
The transfer will take place during a ceremony at which Minister 
of Defense Patricio Rojas and Air Force General Ramon Vega, 
commander in chief of the Chilean Air Force, will preside. 
  These aircraft were purchased in accordance with a general 
agreement signed between this service branch and Aeronautic 
Constructions, S.A. (CASA), a Spanish aircraft factory, 
following the construction in Chile of the CASA 101 jet reactor 
aircraft that Group No. 1 currently has in service. 
  Thanks to its special STOL [short takeoff and landing] 
characteristics, its usefulness on unprepared terrain, and the 
rear ramp designed for the handling of large cargo volume, these 
planes are an excellent tool for providing transport and aid 
when catastrophes occur in our country. 
  These planes are destined for use by the Third Air Brigade 
based in Puerto Montt as replacements for the old Twin Otters. 
They will provide support services to the isolated localities in 
continental Chiloe and Regions XI and XII, as well as for the 
missions to the Antarctic. 
  The CASA 212 aircraft have excellent navigation equipment 
and 
computers, a flight range of 2,000 kilometers, a maximum speed 
of 350 kilometers per hour, and a capacity of three tons of 
cargo, 26 passengers, or 12 patients on litters. 
  Pedro Bermejo Marin, the Spanish ambassador to Chile, as 
well 
as representatives of the CASA enterprise, will attend the 
acceptance ceremony as special guests. 
  As to the possible purchase of airplanes of the Mirage line 
announced by Minister of Defense Patricio Rojas, they are 
expected to be entirely operational by the end of this year, or 
at the beginning of next year at the latest. 
  These planes would be Belgian Mirage 5 BR's, which the air 
force in that country is now replacing with U.S.-manufactured 
F-16's. These fighter-bombers were modified in accordance with 
the special Mirage System Improvement Program (MIRSIP), and have 
been equipped with new electronic and weapons systems. The SABCA 
[Belgian Company for Aircraft Manufacturing], an affiliate of 
Dassault, participated in this reequipment process. 
  The MIRSIP Mirage 5 is equipped with modern electronic 
detection and attack systems. It has an Atar engine manufactured 
by the SNECMA [National Aircraft Engine Research and 
Manufacturing Company], which enables it to exceed double the 
speed of sound. It can transport up to four tons of bombs and 
air-to-air missiles. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Patricio Peralta Zavando] </F>
  [Text] Yesterday, with but a few days left to completion of 
its term, and after more than a year of processing in Congress, 
Patricio Aylwin's government promulgated the Capital Market Law. 
It is one of the Aylwin government's most economically important 
pieces of legislation and a far-reaching modernization of the 
financial system. The law will become effective with its 
publication in the DIARIO OFFICIAL on 16 March. 
  The bill, which has now become a Law of the Republic, 
fundamentally modifies the current Securities Market, Pension 
Funds, Investment Funds, Mutual Funds, and Insurance Companies 
laws. The bill, it will be recalled, gave rise to intense 
debates in Congress, and prolonged negotiations between the 
government's Congressional supporters and members of the 
opposition, which finally culminated in a political agreement 
that enabled its enactment. 
  The new law embodies a number of instruments designed to 
diversify investment options, and opens investment possibilities 
abroad for pension funds, insurance companies, and mutual funds. 
To balance the greater liberalization, the law introduces 
regulations that seek to prevent conflicts of interest and shady 
practices in the stock market. It also categorizes crimes and 
stipulates sanctions. 
<H5>  Foxley </H5>
  In the promulgation ceremony held yesterday at the 
Government 
House, the minister of finance, Alejandro Foxley, said that 
"this reform will have a favorable impact on the efficiency of 
the savings and investments process, the size and security of 
the pensions the workers will receive in the future, and the 
openness and strength with which the capital markets will 
operate in our country." 
  According to the minister, this reform represents an overall 
effort to revise and update the legislation relative to the 
securities market and institutional investors, especially the 
pension funds. 
  With reference to the fundamental objectives of the reform, 
Foxley stated that it seeks "to develop mechanisms that enhance 
opportunities for financing investments in production, 
infrastructure, and housing." He said that this effort can be 
expected to have a positive effect on the country's long-term 
growth rate, and to reduce the Chilean economy's vulnerability 
to external factors, in that, "financing of the productive 
investment process will be able to depend to a greater extent on 
our national savings resources." 
  The law is also aimed at enhancing the diversification of 
pension fund investments by increasing their returns and 
security. And lastly, it seeks to substantially improve the 
openness of capital market operations and reduce conflicts of 
interest so as to increase confidence in the equitable 
functioning of this market. 
<H5>  Pension Funds </H5>
  Foxley pointed out that the most important feature of 
Pension 
Fund Law 3.500 is the capability it provides for pension funds 
to invest in new instruments, including refunding bonds, project 
financing bonds, securitization bonds, low-liquidity stocks, new 
foreign equity issues, and funds for the financing of 
development. 
  He added that the modification of investment limits enables 
greater diversification in the pension fund's investment 
portfolio, expanding the opportunities for investment of funds, 
and reducing the pension fund's risk. In this regard, he pointed 
out that the easing and greater diversification of pension fund 
investments in bonds and other securities is accompanied by a 
set of regulations on conflicts of interest that could arise 
between the administering entity and the fund itself. Added to 
this are the regulations that govern the voting by pension fund 
administrators in corporations in which they hold shares. They 
stipulate that the administrators must vote for directors who 
are independent of the groups controlling the corporation. 
<H5>  Securities Market </H5>
  The finance minister stated that one of the most important 
objectives of Capital Market Law 18.045 is to buttress the 
private-sector's rating of risk. "Knowledge alone of the 
regulations on the rating of risk, contained in the law on 
securities, has generated a rapid consolidation and 
internationalization of the industry of risk rating," he said, 
adding that for the development of a debt-securities-intensive 
market, the development of a solid, independent, highly 
respected risk-rating industry is essential. 
  He emphasized that the establishing of new norms and 
mechanisms regulating the use of insider information, including 
criminal sanctions and the addressing of conflicts of interest, 
especially in the case of administrators of the funds of third 
parties, will enhance the openness of the securities market.

<F P=106> [Article by Monica Gonzalez] </F>
  [Text] Last Wednesday, President Patricio Aylwin finally 
received the Treasury Inspector's Office's first report on the 
huge losses amassed by Codelco [Copper Corporation]. And the 
chief executive must have breathed a sigh of relief upon being 
informed that--as found by the country's principal auditing 
body--the responsibility for those losses stops at the level of 
Codelco's former chief executive officer, Alejandro Noemi. 
  At this point in time, after an exhaustive examination of 
the 
proceedings of Codelco's Board of Directors, after taking the 
depositions, not once but several times, of its former 
executives and of others who are still with the Copper 
Corporation, after a thorough analysis of a large number of 
operations with brokers, and after having heard the testimony of 
Juan Pablo Davila at least twice (the last was on 14 February), 
the Treasury Inspector's Office has concluded that there was a 
flagrant breakdown of the control systems in place for 
supervision of the operations conducted by the Department of 
Futures Markets. 
  In a separate paragraph of the report, Treasury Inspection 
officials Raul Ailtken, Marcelino Pineda, and Martin Garrido 
conclude that: "The spirit and regulation relative to metals 
market operations were systematically violated by the Department 
of Futures Markets, without any supervisory monitoring of the 
situation having been exercised by the committee created for 
this purpose, the management, or the deputy manager for sales." 
  The cited committee consisted of Gonzalo Trivelli, vice 
president of marketing; Ignacio Guerrero, vice president of 
finance and treasury inspection; Owen Guerrini, sales manager; 
Carlos Derpsch, deputy sales manager; and Davila himself. 
  The report finds that the committee, created on 24 September 
1990 to evaluate periodically and oversee the operations managed 
by Juan Pablo Davila, ceased functioning on 13 August 1992, the 
date of record of the minutes of its final meeting. 
  The Treasury Inspector's Office is delving, furthermore, 
into 
several of the contradictions incurred by Davila since the 
irruption of the case. For example, Codelco's former operator 
has insisted that the computerized monitoring systems that it 
had been decided to use in futures operations were not used 
because they were inoperative. 
  After a diligent on-site investigation at Codelco's head 
office, however, the Treasury Inspector's Office found that, two 
years ago, the company decided to purchase this monitoring 
equipment. In December 1991, the necessary hardware--an A.S.400 
computer--was purchased, and simultaneously, a contract was 
signed for procurement of the software. The contract bore a 
German signature. 
  The investigation revealed that since April of last year the 
complete system has been in operating condition, and that it was 
not put into operation not because of any technical fault or 
lack of any element in the system, but simply because the data 
that Davila was to provide was never inputted. 
<H5>  November: Key Month </H5>
  But there is more. The Treasury Inspection experts also 
discovered a situation that goes back to a date in November of 
last year and that has become a key piece in the investigation. 
  On that date, two of Juan Pablo Davila's management 
superiors, Carlos Derpsch and Gonzalo Trivelli, were informed 
that as of that moment Codelco had open positions into 1994 
involving losses on the order of $10 million. That is, the 
margin of exposure expressly set by Noemi when he authorized 
operations of that type had been exceeded by a factor of 10. 
  The information concerning these losses did not emanate from 
Juan Pablo Davila on that occasion, but from one of his 
subordinates, operator Gonzalo Sanchez, who for that reason had 
to testify more than once before Minister Benquis. 
  That seems to have been the starting point of all the 
confusion as to whether Davila actually realized gains of more 
than $30 million in 1992. Be that as it may, it turns out that, 
instead of immediately ordering the placement of stop-loss 
orders, as they should have, Trivelli and Derpsch allegedly 
instructed the "star" operator to transfer the loss to 1993. 
  Moreover, the Treasury Inspector's Office report cites 
another fact that can hardly pour oil on the government's 
troubled waters. According to the above-named experts, losses 
could exceed the $206 million figure by an amount close to $40 
million. The definitive figure will have to be determined month 
by month, step by step, given the high degree of fluctuation of 
copper prices on the international market, and the impact they 
will have on the still open operations effected by Juan Pablo 
Davila.

<F P=106> [Report by Hector Ordonez] </F>
  [Text] General Luis Alonso Discua Elvir, Armed Forces 
chief, today ruled out the possibility the military will disrupt 
the democratic process. Nevertheless, while Discua denies any 
possibility of a coup d'etat, President Carlos Reina affirms the 
report. Moreover, Discua said he would rather resign than 
participate in an uprising. 
  The Reina administration was compelled to organize a news 
conference to state its position on the prevailing fear among 
U.S. human rights groups that the Armed Forces will seize power 
to prevent the abolition of mandatory military service, the 
privatization of Hondutel [Honduran Telecommunications 
Enterprise], and the transfer of the Merchant Marine to 
civilians. The curious thing is the president affirms this new 
report and the alleged plot that reportedly was prepared against 
him. 
  [Begin Reina recording] A white book must be published on 
the two events, which I must interpret positively. The people 
should have all the details about that unfortunate plan to end 
the Honduran president's life. Second, I reassert it is a 
report from human rights organizations, because, according to 
those rumors, they see a threat to democratic government. [end 
recording] 
  Other Liberal Party members have been more categorical; the 
version deserves no credibility. 
  [Begin unidentified speaker recording] We must not believe 
it, much less encourage it. [end recording] 
  Referring to the alleged motives, the president said 
Hondutel's privatization will be clear; his proposal for a 
voluntary and educational military service will be presented to 
Congress no later than next week; the Merchant Marine's transfer 
to civilians is being discussed, and the Armed Forces have 
offered no resistance. 
  [Begin Reina recording] I must state, however, with all the 
chivalry of the world, I have had no problems with the military 
in connection with strengthening of the authority the people 
have delegated to the president of the Republic, who is also 
commander general of the Armed Forces. [end recording] 
  Moments later the president and Discua attended a sports 
event, and they appeared quite relaxed. The general was 
categorical: 
  [Begin recording] [Discua] If at any moment Gen. Discua, 
commander in chief of the Armed Forces, receives a proposal to 
participate in this type of action, I would rather leave my post 
than violate my pledge to the Constitution and the laws. 
  [Reina] That represents the new American military, a new 
doctrine. The coups d'etat are a thing of the past. The new 
military has faith in democracy, as the general has said, and 
let there be no doubt he will honor that new model of a soldier. 
[end recording] 
  Given the forceful statements by the president of the 
Republic and the Armed Forces commander in chief, the 
possibility the Armed Forces will obstruct the moral revolution 
has been ruled out.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Enrique Ortez Colindres, adviser </F>
to Honduran President Reina and Liberal Party spokesman, with 
Alfredo Villaclara -- live] 
  [Text] [Villaclara] We are in touch Lawyer Enrique Ortez 
Colindres, adviser to the president. Is this sort of warning, 
made even at the United nations -- as revealed by Deputy Luis 
Lagos [regarding a possible coup d'etat in Honduras] -- possible 
at this stage of the process to consolidate Honduran democracy? 
Good morning, Dr. Ortez. 
  [Ortez] Good morning, HRN.. I thank you for being so kind 
to call me, because I would like to comment in two capacities, 
as the official Liberal Party spokesman and as an adviser to the 
Presidency of the Republic. It is also worthwhile to say -- I 
hope without seeming pedantic, because I am trying to shed light 
on this case -- that I also speak as former Honduran ambassador 
to the United Nations. 
  I want to tell you that about 160 countries are represented 
at the United Nations, and its members can talk about anything 
from A to Z. In the assemblies and committees, anyone can talk 
about robberies, human rights violations, marijuana, cocaine, 
and gunrunning. Anything goes. 
  Nevertheless, I do not see how any credence can be given to 
a 
coup d'etat in a country as serious as ours; a country that 
installed a new government, which is supported by the people, 
not even 100 days ago. I see no possibility of that, and I will 
tell you why. 
  First, the Honduran Army took an oath and promised to obey 
the people's mandate. You could say they offered to do just 
that under several governments that were dealt coups d'etat. 
But I want to ask you whether there could be a coup d'etat -- 
you who know Honduras -- 90 days after a party as strong as the 
Liberal Party assumed power. I want to ask you if there could be 
a coup when 1 million Liberals are ready to defend this 
government. What de facto government could achieve stability 
given the current circumstances if even strong governments led 
by tyrants, as was the case in Panama, could not achieve it? 
You also saw what happened in Nicaragua. You see what is 
happening in some South American countries and in Haiti, where 
they have been unable to consolidate themselves. 
  At present, with the resolutions issued by the United 
Nations, which brings the international community together, it 
is difficult for any John Doe to break constitutional order and 
stay in power. I think that the time for coups is over. Why? 
Because if support is what is needed at this time, we are 
capable of showing support. We will make the call within the 
party and we will urge the 1 million people who supported Dr. 
Carlos Roberto Reina to make a show of force. You will see what 
kind of party the Liberal Party is. 
  It would not be the first time we faced a coup. What has 
happened when someone dared do carry one out? Corrupt 
governments that brought virtual destitution to our country were 
installed. Thus, I do not think it would be possible -- in light 
of the international situation -- because there would be no 
support for it. I do not think it will happen because the Army 
is obedient. I do not think it could happen because the Army 
lacks a leadership capable of ousting a democratic government 
supported by 1 million Liberals and people who believe in 
democracy. It would be the suicide not of the Liberal 
government but of the Armed Forces. There are intelligent people 
in the Armed Forces. 
  Believe me Rene, I have noticed that selfish interests -- 
the interests of corruption, of sinecures, of all those who have 
been on the payroll, all those who today are not enjoying 
privileges from the government because we are implementing a new 
system -- are trying to promote unrest. I can assure you that 
this will not happen. As a member of the Liberal Party and as 
official spokesman, I urge the Honduran people, especially the 
members of the Liberal Party, to express their support for the 
government, whose only crime is trying to end corruption and 
establish a new system of government. It is obvious that the 
wounded have joined forces because they know that a moral 
revolution is on and that dishonest people will be put in jail 
because the Honduran people have elected a completely different 
person. We can see in the media -- spoken and written -- that 
they are trying to exploit the discontent that exists in the 
country. 
  Carlos Roberto Reina is not God and he cannot perform 
miracles. Our country was completely sacked. In December alone, 
1 million pesos were distributed in transfers using the people's 
funds. The previous administration supposedly subsidized 
kerosene, while three big fish stole the people's money. The 
previous government sacked Injupen [Retirement and Pensions 
Institute], so now the 50,000 houses that were to be built for 
young people will not be built as quickly as planned. The 
project will not be canceled. According to the director of that 
institute, only 500,000 lempiras were left. When I was 
government minister, the contributions and savings of public 
employees totaled $1 billion, but those funds were misused in 
risky projects. Land that had been purchased for 1.14 [currency 
not specified] per square meter was sold the following day for 
200 or 300 lempiras per square meter, stealing 40 to 42 million 
in each of those operations. All this will be uncovered, 
because this government will make decisions. 
  Therefore, I ask the Honduran people and Liberal Party 
members to remain calm but to be alert, because those who 
lost....[pauses] I am not even blaming the National Party, which 
suffered the defeat, but people and groups that held sinecure 
jobs in the past and lived like parasites on the national 
budget. They are defending their interests and attacking the 
government to negotiate those shameful salaries that previous 
administrations paid at the expense of the Honduran people.

<F P=106> [Report by Orlando Sierra] </F>
  [Text] Colonel Alvaro Antonio Romero Salgado, chief of 
Presidential Staff, yesterday testified before Lower Court Judge 
Jesus Martinez Suazo that the much-publicized plot to 
assassinate President Carlos Roberto Reina never existed. This 
information was learned in the capital's courts. 
  Given this, the judge will have to release Luis Rodolfo 
Hernandez Sosa due to lack of evidence. 
  Hernandez Sosa, 33 years old and a native of Danli, El 
Paraiso, turned himself in on Thursday [14 April] after 
realizing he was the Police's and Army's most wanted man because 
he was presumably the man who masterminded the plot. 
  "I will reveal absolutely nothing because that would be a 
violation of the law," Martinez Suazo said as he left Romero 
Salgado's office in the Presidential House. 
  He said the decision on whether Hernandez Sosa would be 
imprisoned or released would be made today. He added that he 
would only take into consideration what is on the record. 
  "I would never take part in any foul play," he said. He was 
accompanied during his statement by Special Judge Roy Medina and 
Prosecutors Eidelman Mejia and Omar Borjas. 
  He explained that conspiracy in Honduras is punishable by 
two 
to four years in prison. However, he stressed he has yet to 
identify the crime that the alleged plot leader may have 
perpetrated. "The investigation will determine whether a crime 
was committed," he added, noting that there are legal limits on 
the time allowed for such an investigation. 
  He noted that reports published by different media prompted 
the court to order the necessary investigation. 
  Regarding Hernandez Sosa's situation, the judge added: "We 
will either issue an arrest warrant or release him, based on the 
evidence uncovered during the process." 
  Martinez Suazo did not rule out the possibility of 
questioning President Reina and Armed Forces Chief General Luis 
Alonso Discua Elvir. 
  As Martinez Suazo heard Romero Salgado's declaration, 
Hernandez Sosa underwent a blood test in the Legal Medical 
Department. 
  He claimed that he had requested the test. "This is all a 
farce. If the Nicaraguans have already testified, there is no 
need for me to do so," said the visibly angry prisoner. 
  He said he is confident he will win his freedom, and, 
although he promised to "reveal all" to the media, he did not -- 
claiming the media had denigrated him. 
  "It was you, rather than the authorities, who reported 
something you should not have. The people I thought were with 
me were really against me," he said. 
  Because of this, he said he does not want to say anything 
else about his problem. "You have hurt me very much, and 
newspaper reporters have treated me the worst. People behave 
like Judases, and you intimidate me simply to make a good 
impression on your bosses," he said defiantly. 
  He said he was surprised that newspapermen had published so 
many things against him because he did not deserve those 
commentaries. 
  Referring to the president, he said that Reina can do 
nothing 
against him because he has told the whole truth. "I am involved 
in nothing, and I chose to turn myself in because I feel free," 
he stressed. 
  He said that as a man he does not lend himself to anything. 
Therefore, he has nothing to hide. "I am not into drugs and 
that is why I requested this test," he said. 
  He said Abdala Gianini, owner of El Millon department store, 
is a Judas. "I knew him as all employees know their own boss," 
he said, when stating it never crossed his mind to burn down a 
paint factory. 
  [Panama City ACAN in Spanish at 2330 GMT on 12 April 
reports: 
"Luis Hernandez Sosa, implicated last week in a plot to 
assassinate Honduran President Carlos Roberto Reina, was 
released Tuesday [12 April] due to lack of evidence. The lower 
court in Tegucigalpa issued a temporary release order for 
Hernandez Sosa, who had turned himself in on Friday claiming he 
was `innocent' of the crime with which he was being charged."]

<F P=106> [Statement by Cesar Castellanos, Honduran National Party </F>
leader; place and date not given; from "The Morning Paper" 
newscast -- recorded] 
  [Text] Good morning, Hondurans. The rumors that are 
spreading are truly alarming. Two days ago I spoke on another 
radio network, and [words indistinct] told me about this rumor 
that is spreading nationwide. I think that all Hondurans must 
support the constitutional government. The National and the 
Liberal Parties have had to pay a high price to bring democracy 
back to Honduras. Ours is a democracy that must be broadened and 
strengthened. 
  In addition, rumors of this kind, especially if they are 
promoted by various national sectors, substantially undermine 
the country's economy vis-a-vis the international community. I 
believe and reiterate: We cannot let this government fail, but 
this government must also act to prevent this from happening. 
There are no doubts. We sensed it when we spoke with fellow 
party members and many Liberals. They all agree that people are 
very disappointed. The government lacks leadership and often 
improvises because it is not prepared to rule. There is a 
general feeling that the government makes hasty decisions, and 
we must find a solution to this. We must unite to find a 
solution to national problems. This is not about whether the 
government fails, it is about the system losing its credibility, 
which might lead people to seek other mechanisms to govern. 
  I do not think a military coup d'etat would change the 
country's economic situation because such a forceful action will 
not bring food or money; it would do more harm. The 
international condemnation following a coup d'etat would be 
serious, widespread, and our country would be faced with even 
worse problems. We have also been in touch with the military on 
various occasions, and they have expressed their concern 
regarding the country's economic situation and willingness to 
cooperate. 
  I think we should disregard these rumors. Regarding the 
presidential adviser and Liberal Party spokesman, who commented 
recently about feeling pressured, I know many people will go out 
and rush to sell their things because there is a high level of 
disappointment. I am positive, however, that all Hondurans 
reject the possibility of a coup d'etat. I reiterate that we 
must hold a national dialogue. All Hondurans must be aware of 
their positions. If ordinary people must make sacrifices, 
businessmen, producers, industrialists, and banks, which have 
fared well and have increased their wealth substantially, must 
make even greater sacrifices.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Honduran economic developments reported through 12 
April. 
  Tegucigalpa Telesistema Hondureno de Television in Spanish 
0100 GMT 6 Apr 94 reports the government confirmed on 6 April 
that fuel prices will be adjusted every 15 days. A government 
official said that fuel prices will be based on an average of 
international prices and that the government will prevent 
profiteering. It was officially announced on 6 April that 
electricity rates will be increased for those who consume 300 kw 
of electricity or more. 
  Panama City ACAN in Spanish 2141 GMT 11 Apr 94 reports that 
according to a study conducted by the Honduran Economists 
Association, food prices increased 21 percent in the first three 
months of Carlos Reina's administration. Reina's economic 
cabinet eliminated $8 million worth of fuel subsidies and 
increased the dollar exchange rate from 6.20 to 7.27 lempiras in 
March. The Honduran Central Bank revealed that the consumer 
price index increased 1 percent, compared with 0.2-percent 
increase in March 1993. Martin Barahona, vice president of the 
Economists Association, said that 1.5 million people are able to 
work but 25 percent of them are unemployed or underemployed. 
Barahona added that eight out of 10 Hondurans live below the 
poverty level.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Attorney General Carlos Gustavo </F>
Arrieta by unidentified reporter; from "Caracol's 0600 to 0900" 
newscast -- live] 
  [Text] The big news in the last few hours was a news 
conference by Prosecutor General Dr. Gustavo de Greiff 
yesterday. Dr. de Greiff clearly refuted U.S. Senator John Kerry 
and revealed the text of a letter his office sent Kerry days ago 
indicating the mistakes and untruths presumably contained in the 
senator's statements on the drug trafficking problem in our 
country and on the efforts of the Prosecutor General's Office. 
  The prosecutor general also criticized the national 
government and -- if you read between the lines -- the Justice 
Ministry. De Greiff told reporters that the justice minister -- 
on behalf of the executive branch -- defended [words indistinct] 
as it is commonly said, before Congress, a bill that would later 
become the nation's new penal code, which is the center of 
controversy right now. 
  De Greiff also lashed out at certain media, accusing them of 
not having read the documents in question. He accused the media 
of distorting his position toward La Quica [Dandeny Munoz 
Mosquera] and the letter he sent the U.S. judge handling the 
case. In sum, the prosecutor's decision not to step down will 
leave much to be done and ample material for comment by the 
media. 
  Prosecutor General de Greiff urged the national government 
to 
work together against the drug trafficking cartels. He recalled 
that the executive branch worked intensively in discussing the 
issues and drafting the penal procedural code. As previously 
mentioned, the prosecutor general criticized the justice 
minister and said he does not understand why a decision that was 
discussed and jointly adopted is now being criticized. 
  That collaboration, that harmony among the various branches 
of public power to establish a common front against drug 
trafficking, was also demanded in due time by an official who 
has appeared to be conciliatory, who has served as a bridge in 
the reestablishment of talks between the prosecutor general and 
the president as well as with the justice minister. We are 
talking about Attorney General Carlos Gustavo Arrieta. Good 
morning, Attorney General Carlos Gustavo Arrieta. 
  [Arrieta] Good morning. How are you? 
  [Reporter] What is your opinion about the documents revealed 
to the general public yesterday by Prosecutor General Gustavo de 
Greiff and about his news conference, especially the last part 
of it, when he requests greater harmony and cooperation among 
the branches of government to fight drug trafficking. 
  [Arrieta] I think it is the most important part of the 
document. I am talking about the latter part, where the 
prosecutor general urges the executive branch to cooperate in 
the entire process, with the criminal policy, with the 
(?repentance) policy. He pledged to do his part. De Greiff also 
reaffirmed his determination to continue fighting drug 
trafficking. 
  We all want to deal with the core of the problem [words 
indistinct] in the past months. I think that if the Prosecutor 
General's Office is clearly determined to contribute and 
participate in the [words indistinct], then we have taken an 
important step toward breaking the deadlock. 
  [Reporter] The media have reported that the prosecutor 
general agreed, as the president did this week, with the 
presentation of a bill to Congress to reform certain rules of 
the penal procedural code. You met yesterday morning for 
several hours with Prosecutor General de Greiff. Were you able 
to discuss which chapters or issues of that penal procedural 
code should be reformed? 
  [Arrieta] Frankly, this was an idea we had discussed on 
several occasions. We also discussed it with certain government 
officials and, fortunately for the country, there has been 
progress. 
  There is a consensus on the need to review certain points of 
the penal code and the code on penal procedures. The penal code 
brings together a series of legal provisions which, as I 
mentioned, are dispersed in more than 50 or 60 regulations. We 
need to review sentences and adjust certain aspects of the code 
on penal procedures that I think merit review, such as that 
which concerns automatic advantages [ventajas automaticas] and 
the implementation of certain benefits. 
  I dare say that there is almost a consensus, and I expect 
our 
proposal to be accepted so we can form a working group that will 
be able to quickly present a coherent draft to Congress. We 
cannot make mistakes. We will take a week to do things right, 
but I do hope that we will be in the position -- I repeat -- to 
present a draft to Congress in two or three months with the 
suggestions we have made plus those that the Prosecutor's Office 
feels are important, because Congress believes that it is vital 
that this draft be presented correctly. 
  [Reporter] Based on what you just said, we can surmise that 
there are three basic aspects: the [word indistinct] of 50 or 
60 regulations that are dispersed in various codes; the review 
of sentences that seem to be too short -- there is a consensus 
about that in the country; and the review of what you termed 
automatic advantages and certain benefits for those who turn 
themselves in. Are there points of disagreement? 
  [Arrieta] As for [words indistinct], I do not think there is 
any discrepancy. In that specific aspect, I do not think there 
is any disagreement; on the contrary, there is a consensus. I 
feel it is also important to mention the famous Article 369E, 
which was so controversial in its own time. Do you remember a 
couple of months ago when it was implied that certain people 
were being investigated by the prosecutor general. 
  [Reporter] Is there a consensus on reforms to Article 369E? 
Does the justice minister, who so vigorously defended the way it 
was drafted at Congress, agree with it? 
  [Arrieta] [Words indistinct] a small disagreement but 
precisely the work of the commission, made up by the group I 
mentioned, is aimed at ironing out differences so we can present 
a project on which we all agree. 
  [Reporter] Could domestic and foreign critics be right in 
saying that we are lax in dealing with drug traffickers. 
  [Arrieta] I think we must realize that the surrender policy 
and the methods by which it is implemented have had excellent 
results, but they have also created some problems. We must 
learn from our mistakes to improve the process. No one thought 
we would would perform miracles in one or two years. An 
important procedure was designed and it has had some clear 
results. We must learn from the mistakes made in the 
implementation of this policy. We must perfect the process 
until we have tools that will strengthen the state and allow us 
to have a clear and effective criminal policy within our laws. 
  When we talk about doing a review, it does not mean that 
what 
we did before did not work. It is something we must keep 
working on to fine tune these tools until they are right for the 
purposes for which they were intended. 
  [Reporter] So you are telling us that we need a legal 
interpretation of how the principle of favorableness [principio 
de favorabilidad] of the criminal code will be applied in the 
event that standards that are currently considered favorable are 
reformed, making them stronger and more strict for people who 
are going to be tried. 
  [Arrieta] You are right, just as you usually are when you 
comment on legal matters. The truth is that the principle of 
favorableness implies that some of the changes, especially 
substantial ones, could be applied only for crimes committed in 
the future. This is important because it has a preventive 
effect, an effect that could be useful for the country. 
  [Reporter] What can be done so that U.S. officials, so Mr. 
Kerry or the U.S. attorney general, can agree with [words 
indistinct] penal code? 
  [Arrieta] I truly do not believe [words indistinct] agree or 
disagree because Colombia is independent in that sense. I think 
the basic problem with the United States is a lack of 
communication. They should understand the vicissitudes, the 
difficulties, and the characteristics inherent to our national 
problems. I do not think they simply want us to have 
legislation that is similar or comparable to the existing 
legislation because the circumstances are very different. The 
idea is to come up with legislation that will be in keeping with 
our situation and that will give us the tools to fight crime and 
prevent impunity. I believe that [words indistinct] they will 
understand in the end. If one looks back one will find that 
there were very controversial decisions in the judiciary which 
could seem weak, but when they are analyzed under the current 
laws, they were not controversial per se, such as the [name 
indistinct] case, the case of the Ochoas, which involved [word 
indistinct] that, within the Colombian context, were very 
negative but in the end, the North Americans understood. That is 
why I say that the problem is not whether they accept or reject 
it, because Colombia is independent in these matters. It is a 
problem of [words indistinct] in consensus. [Words indistinct] 
in the face of controversial decisions [words indistinct] two or 
three behind [words indistinct] reasonably explain why certain 
decisions were made, and they understood in the end. [passage 
indistinct] have been asking [words indistinct] for coherence 
among all those concerned with this issue because [words 
indistinct] can present a united front with wise and reasonable 
explanations there is no reason to [words indistinct]. Our 
experience in these matters shows that the North Americans have 
not been [words indistinct] we have been the problem and thus we 
must think about our own laws in terms of our own criteria and 
what is best. 
  [Reporter] With all due respect, Mr. Attorney General, one 
can understand correspondence and opinions coming and going 
between Prosecutor General Gustavo De Greiff and Mrs. Reno. What 
one cannot understand, as a Colombian, is why pay so much 
attention to what Senator John Kerry has to say? Who is Sen. 
John Kerry? He is a U.S. senator, he is a very important 
person, he is very respectable, he is a writer for THE 
WASHINGTON POST, and so on, but is that enough to have a whole 
country paralyzed, to have its people divided and waiting for 
what a U.S. senator has to say? 
  [Arrieta] That is why it is important to nip this in the 
bud. 
I found his statements yesterday interesting, from a certain 
standpoint. He defined the true dimensions of the problem and 
highlighted the basic fact that he does not have a full 
understanding of some areas. I do agree with you, but this is 
not just any old senator. He is the chairman of the Senate 
Narcotics Commission. Nevertheless, I believe that as we move 
on and we explain these things to this fellow, we will surely be 
able to solve the problem in the end. In general terms, though, 
I do agree with you on this. 
  [Reporter] Thank you sir. I have three different issues 
here. First, is it true that the Attorney General's Office has 
almost taken over the Administrative Department of Civil 
Aeronautics? 
  [Arrieta] I would not really say takeover is the appropriate 
term. We have been working closely with them and we have had 
the full cooperation of the department's directors in solving 
several delicate problems. There were in fact a great many 
problems regarding investigation and such, so we decided to 
implement a permanent surveillance system. This was not just to 
solve the internal problems we found in security, corruption, 
and mismanagement in the area of licensing. Through this 
surveillance operation, without affecting the investigative 
process, we expect to assist them in the implementation of 
corrective measures within the department, in order for it to 
operate much better. To that end, I repeat, we have had the 
full cooperation of the department's administrative personnel. 
We are very pleased about this, because we can find the 
solutions if we continue to work together. We have found 
several very serious problems there and this cooperation system 
has allowed them to explain the situation. We will continue to 
have a permanent presence and continuous surveillance there. 
  [Reporter] Another question. Is the prosecutor general 
getting his way, from a legal point of view, following the 
decision to transport five of Pablo Escobar's former lieutenants 
to participate in judicial proceedings going on Antioquia? 
  [Arrieta] I do not think so, Dario. I do not think anyone is 
getting their way. I think that this is a way of finding 
understanding among the parties. On the one hand we have the 
prosecutor general's wish to have these people in Medellin so 
the proceedings can progress. The government is getting its way 
as well, because there will not be a mass transfer, but one 
person at a time. That way we will not see any of the public 
security problems they believe could have occurred. I believe 
that what we are seeing here is a negotiated solution which 
tries to avert any possible public disturbance, while serving 
the prosecutor general's legal purposes. I do not think, then, 
that anyone is getting his way. 
  [Reporter] Very well, we will have individual transfers. 
Will their stay at the Itagui Prison, in Medellin, be temporary 
or indefinite? 
  [Arrieta] I believe it will just be temporary, Dario, until 
certain legal activities are completed, to ensure normal 
progress of the various cases. As soon as they finish they will 
return to Bogota, unless the conditions that led the government 
to object to the transfers still prevail. 
  [Reporter] We thank you for this interview with Caracol, Mr. 
Attorney General. The last issue has to do with the order 
issued by the Attorney General's Office and carried out by the 
Armed Forces and the president. This was the dismissal of Gen. 
Jesus Armando Arias Cabrales. You had a full year to overturn 
the special prosecutor's sentence following the investigation 
and the legal proceedings. Why did you decide not to overturn 
that ruling? Why did you ratify your predecessor's ruling? 
  [Arrieta] I think it is important that we set the record 
straight on this issue. This office could not legally overturn 
my predecessor's ruling. Legally, given the circumstances at 
that specific time, the ruling could not be revoked, whether I 
agreed with it or not. According to the law, once a case is 
filed under the jurisdiction of the administrative legal 
authorities, and that authority rules on the charges, their 
ruling cannot be revoked. The attorney general could not 
legally revoke the ruling, whether he agreed with it or not. 
  [Reporter] Under the law and in your mind, did you agree 
with your predecessor's ruling? 
  [Arrieta] Dario, it is very difficult for me to answer that, 
but let me say what I have said on several occasions. When we 
examined the case we found that there were certain additional 
issues that should have been investigated, particularly in two 
areas. The first question was which higher ranking officer gave 
Gen. Arias Cabrales certain orders regarding the operation? I 
do not mean civilian authorities; I mean the military 
authorities that participated in the operation, besides Gen. 
Cabrales. Then there is a question of who was involved in the 
specific action that prompted the Attorney General's Office to 
investigate -- the events that took place in the restroom 
located between the third and fourth floors of the Justice 
Palace. 
  I think it is important to make one point here, Dario. When 
the Attorney General's Office examined the case, it did not 
examine the operation in general. Many believe that the 
office's decision was against the reaction, the use of the 
tanks, the fierceness, the violence, and so on, and that is just 
not true. The ruling has to do with the specific and precise 
events that took place on 6 and 7 November -- particularly 7 
November -- in the restroom between the third and fourth floors. 
  [Reporter] You mean the alleged abuses and excessive use of 
force the Armed Forces displayed? 
  [Arrieta] Dario, the Attorney General's Office argued that 
when these events took place, the Palace had almost been 
recovered and there was almost no resistance. The hostages were 
concentrated at specific locations and the rebels were also 
grouped together. The Attorney General's Office found what went 
on in the restroom between the third and fourth floors merited 
some degree of admonishment. The troops opened a hole in the 
wall using dynamite or a rocket and shot into the room with a 
machine gun, against rebels and hostages alike. The Attorney 
General's Office ruled against that specific line of action. 
That is why the attorney general sentenced Gen. Arias Cabrales. 
  [Reporter] It was not because he followed orders from higher 
ranking civilian and military authorities, but for that specific 
incident? 
  [Arrieta] I think the debate has wandered off in that 
direction. The orders he received are not in question. No one 
said that obeying orders frees you from all responsibility, as 
long as these orders are carried within the law. I cannot but 
agree with the justice minister, because I do not believe there 
was a specific and direct order to open fire with a machine gun 
into a room containing 60 or 70 people. That is the part that 
has created the controversy. There is a question of whether 
Gen. Arias Cabrales is in fact directly responsible for these 
specific acts and I have found no specific evidence in the file 
to prove that. This is why I am in no position to give you a 
specific answer to your question. I do believe it would be 
beneficial to offer the people a more detailed explanation about 
why the Attorney General's Office made this decision. 
  [Reporter] Why has the president remained so silent. At the 
time he was a congressman and a spokesman for presidential 
candidate Virgilio Barco. He strongly criticized Former 
President Belisario Betancur, the minister of defense, and other 
high government officials for having issued the orders? 
  [Arrieta] Dario, I cannot answer that question. 
  [Reporter] Thank you, Attorney General Carlos Gustavo 
Arrieta, for accepting this interview for Caracol.

  [Text] Medellin, Colombia, 9 Apr (AFP) -- Drug trafficker 
Juan David Ochoa will have to serve 15 additional months in 
jail, with respect to his initial sentence, although he has also 
won a $100,000 reduction in his fine, the regional prosecutor's 
office in Antioquia Department, northeastern Colombia, reported 
on Saturday. Thus, the sentence of the eldest of the three Ochoa 
Clan brothers now stands at 93 months in jail (instead of 78), 
and he will pay, thanks to the reduction of his fine, $300,000 
(240 million pesos) instead of $400,000. 
  Juan David Ochoa, together with his brothers Jose Luis and 
Fabio, of the Medellin drug cartel, voluntarily surrendered to 
justice in 1991. The first sentence handed down against the 
confessed "narco" at the beginning of this year for collusion, 
illegal enrichment, and financing clandestine laboratories to 
process cocaine took into account his good conduct, work, and 
studies in prison. 
  The decision to increase his jail sentence and reduce his 
fine were negotiated under the surrender to justice policy that 
grants benefits to drug traffickers and paramilitaries who 
voluntarily surrender, confess to at least one crime, and agree 
to return money obtained through illegal means. According to 
unofficial reports, the former "capo" did not have the money to 
pay his fine and thus agreed to spend an additional 15 months in 
prison in exchange for a reduction of that fine. 
  It has also been reported that the sentence meted out to 
paramilitary Jose Otoniel Vanegas, who also surrendered 
voluntarily to authorities, was reduced to 15 years in prison 
for the murder of Conservative Party Senator Alfonso Ospina 
Ospina in 1988. The National Tribunal considered that his 
initial penalty -- 19 years -- had been excessive and granted 
him a four-year reduction. 
  The measures against Ochoa and Vanegas were adopted within 
the framework of reversal hearings for the anticipated 
conclusion of their trials, which were carried out in the 
presence of the prisoners, their defense attorneys, Deputy 
Prosecutor General Jose Sintura, Attorney General's Office 
representatives, a prosecutor, and a regional judge.

and Julio Mario Santo Domingo over alleged wiretapping has not 
ended. SEMANA issued a communique today saying that it will wait 
for a ruling from the Colombian judicial authorities as this is 
not merely a case of gossip but a serious crime. 
  Santo Domingo had previously issued a communique denying a 
report published by the magazine linking him to an alleged case 
of wiretapping.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Guillermo Perry: "Pastrana's Shifts"] </F>
  [Text] This week's edition of PORTFOLIO carries an 
interview with Conservative candidate Andres Pastrana titled 
"`No' to Revaluation." It is surprising, to say the least, that 
less than three weeks after launching his program, Dr. Pastrana 
has decided to change his position on such a central issue as 
how Colombian economic policy should be handled. Indeed, on page 
5 of his announcement speech, one reads: "The recent evolution 
in the rate of exchange is largely the result of having a more 
open economy that has at the same time won the trust of national 
and foreign investors." In other words, 20 days ago, Pastrana 
defended the revaluation process as something inevitable and 
almost appropriate, given the recent influx of capital. 
  On Monday, for reasons I ignore, he decided to support 
Ernesto Samper's position. For more than eight months now, the 
Liberal candidate has been explaining that "revaluation is not 
the path" for an open economy because it hurts exports and all 
activities that compete with foreign products and services. He 
has therefore pledged to support a macroeconomic policy that 
will keep the real rate of exchange stable. What fate would 
await the country on such a delicate issue as exchange policy in 
the hands of Andres Pastrana if he changes his mind on the 
matter every 20 days? 
  Nor is this the first time this has happened in the past two 
weeks. It is a well-known fact that Ernesto Samper has focused 
his program on the generation of an adequate number of 
productive jobs. At the international seminar on Liberalization 
and Employment sponsored by his campaign and held in Medellin on 
28 January, he laid out his employment policy in detail, giving 
out the figures on how many jobs would be generated by its 
different components: the export plan, agricultural conversion 
plan, investment and physical infrastructure programs, 
low-income housing and human resources, a program to support 
mini- and small businesses, programs to recruit and train 
vulnerable groups. According to the numbers, Samper's program 
would create 1.5 million new and better jobs over the next four 
years, exceeding the goal of 3.5 million new jobs set for the 
decade. 
  In contrast, the jobs issue is not among the seven 
priorities 
contained in Pastrana's program, priorities publicized profusely 
in paid advertisements carried by all the daily newspapers and 
the topic of his announcement speech. His platform, which, as 
President Gaviria would say, is more of a telephone directory 
than a true platform, devotes only two of its 200+ pages to the 
problem of employment, contains no overall strategy for handling 
it, and offers absolutely no figures whatsoever on the matter. 
  Bombarded with criticism as the result of such a notorious 
omission on an issue so critical to all Colombians, candidate 
Pastrana next tried to dispatch the matter by saying that if 1.5 
million jobs were created under the Gaviria Administration, he 
thinks more could be created over the next four years. In 
addition to being superficial, the argument contains one tiny 
flaw: Even the most optimistic calculations estimate that fewer 
than a million jobs have been generated over the past four 
years. Pastrana's lack of seriousness about and commitment to 
the issue of employment is more than obvious. 
  The third example of the same approach is the agricultural 
sector. In his announcement speech, candidate Pastrana goes 
after the subsidies and protection for the agricultural sector 
that are part of Samper's Agricultural Conversion Plan. Pastrana 
said textually on the day he announced that "we shall remove the 
barriers preventing the agricultural sector from joining the 
commercial world." "I am telling you that the solution to the 
crisis does not lie in trying to compete by granting equal 
subsidies" (equal to those extended by other countries) and that 
"our only path is to achieve greater efficiency" (in order to 
overcome the agricultural crisis). In recent days, he has 
changed that position in public speeches, offering all manner of 
support to the rural world. Pastrana's position on agriculture 
apparently depends on whether he is speaking at the Bogota 
Convention Center or in a town square! 
  The last and most incredible change in position is on the 
Bogota Metro [subway]. After saying "No" to the Metro in two 
speeches and opposing Samper's proposal, on the television 
program "Panorama" broadcast on 28 February, he said with 
particular cheekiness that he would build the Metro in Bogota. 
He added that he proposed to do so when he was mayor, even 
though all Bogota residents recall that he killed the Metro when 
the Barco Administration and Mayor Sanchez had practically 
awarded the contracts. By the same standard that you judge, you 
shall be judged! 
  When the Samper campaign urged candidate Pastrana to take 
the 
high road during the campaign and engage in a debate based on 
ideas, no one ever imagined facing a chameleon-like strategy 
that changes color to blend with the background: Prussian blue 
when speaking to the Conservative Convention and when writing to 
Alvaro Gomez on their many points of ideological agreement; 
pinkish when sensing a sprinkling of Liberals in the audience. 
  Whether it be on the revaluation, employment, agricultural 
policy, or the Metro, the country at least knows what to expect 
from Andres Pastrana: "In all likelihood, who knows?" as he 
himself said in answer to a question on a different issue put to 
him by the periodical CAMBIO 16 two weeks ago.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Fernando Botero Zea, principal adviser and </F>
strategist for the Samper campaign: "Why Ernesto Is Going To 
Win"] 
  [Text] It would be difficult for the overwhelming majority 
of citizens to conceive something more confusing and complicated 
than presidential elections. With what the traveling, the 
alliances, and the speechmaking, voters easily get lost amid the 
hubbub of the campaigns. When the smoke of the electoral battle 
clears, however, it becomes obvious that campaigns, here, there, 
and everywhere, boil down to three elements: party affiliation, 
the candidates' image, and their platforms. In the case of 
Colombia, an analysis of the three variables leads to a simple, 
inexorable conclusion: Ernesto Samper will be the next president 
of the republic. 
  Party affiliation: Belying all forecasts, the current 
campaign has been conducted along distinctly party lines. Carlos 
Lleras de la Fuente's entry into the Liberal primary and Alvaro 
Gomez's support for Andres Pastrana's Conservative candidacy are 
effects rather than causes of this development. In this regard, 
being the sole candidate of the Liberal Party carries a huge 
advantage. The Liberal Party encompasses almost half of the 
electorate (46 percent) and has an admirable track record of 
reforms to help the weak, young people, and women, and it has 
now set the stage for Colombia to benefit from the 
internationalization of its economy. The Liberal Party has been 
the driving force behind the major political and economic 
reforms of recent years, and another of its assets is the most 
successful and popular president in the country's recent 
history. In contrast, Pastrana's position is extremely weak. 
With the millstone of the minority party on his back, he has had 
to resort to a supraparty strategy that does not enjoy 
credibility among the public. The inadequacy of the program 
"Liberals with Andres" and the difficulty of finding a prominent 
Liberal as a running mate reflect this harsh fact. 
  The Candidates' image: Pastrana has clearly deployed all of 
his artillery in the image battlefield. Will it be enough to win 
the election? Although I am not unaware of the positive image 
that the Conservative candidate may have, there are obviously 
major obstacles to his winning the big prize this way. The polls 
and the "group sessions" are starting to point up the artificial 
streak in Pastrana's image. The transition from a former 
president's son to a supraparty candidate and the sudden 
transformation from a newscaster and rock-and-roll promoter to a 
man of substance and ideas smack of an artificiality that the 
public is readily noticing. People are increasingly of the 
opinion that Pastrana is too green to take up the most important 
job in the country. Moreover, Mayor Pastrana's image has been 
tarnished somewhat as people grow increasingly aware of two key 
blunders during his administration: the city's heavy borrowing 
(people are saying that Pastrana bankrupted the city) and 
blocking the construction of the Bogota subway. Samper has not 
devoted his life to polishing his image and therefore finds such 
an effort more difficult. In spite of the above, Samper is known 
as an experienced man who has devoted much of his public life to 
the economic and social issues that are keys to this election. 
Moreover, at this political juncture, concern for people is 
going to be a crucial factor, and in this regard Samper's social 
sensitivity, warmth, and why not come out and say it, sense of 
humor are invaluable assets. 
  The platforms: Essentially, Samper is well positioned in 
terms of his platform. He supports President Gaviria's policies 
but says that more must be done by moving from the purely 
economic phase of liberalization to the social phase. He has 
focused his campaign proposals on the issue of jobs and on 
raising the income of Colombians. These factors make Samper part 
of the worldwide trend that has recently won elections in 
countries as dissimilar as the United States, Costa Rica, 
Canada, and Chile. The difference between him and Pastrana is 
enormous. The Conservative candidate's diffuse platform 
identifies him as an extremist on liberalization; jobs do not 
have a central place in his platform, and his social proposals 
have all the overtones of the old welfare-state policies that 
are discredited around the world. In this regard Pastrana seems 
out of place and behind the times. The Conservative candidate 
has tried to correct these shortcomings in recent weeks with 
belated proposals for jobs and mass transit. The underlying 
point is this: even if Pastrana takes up Samper's issues as his 
own every time that the polls tell him to, public opinion 
believes in the Liberal candidate because of the concrete 
results that he has achieved on economic and social issues in 
settings as diverse as ANIF [National Association of Financial 
Institutions], the Senate of the Republic, the Ministry of 
Economic Development, and our embassy in Spain. 
  I have some final thoughts about political strategy. At this 
point, the big difference between Samper and Pastrana is the 
cards that each has yet to play in the electoral poker game. The 
fact is that Pastrana has used up almost all of his weapons, 
whereas Samper is holding his gun powder in reserve, dry and 
ready. Samper is still seeking the nomination, whereas Pastrana 
already has it. Samper has the Liberal Party Convention and his 
nomination as the single candidate ahead of him, whereas 
Pastrana has already been nominated by the Conservative Party. 
Samper has not yet launched his publicity campaign, whereas 
Pastrana's advertising has been on the street for a month. 
Samper has not undertaken the much needed reorganization of the 
Liberal Party or selected his vice president, whereas Pastrana, 
who has barely recovered from the setback of Alvaro Gomez's 
support, has huge difficulties ahead of him in making sure that 
his running mate is a Liberal. So when the political battle 
intensifies, Samper will have a large reserve of ammunition, 
whereas Pastrana has, in essence, used up most of his weapons. 
  For all of the above reasons, this election is, as the 
Liberal candidate's publicity proclaims, simultaneously the 
people's day and Samper's day.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Luis Alberto Moreno, general coordinator for </F>
the Pastrana campaign: "Why Andres Is Going To Win"] 
  [Text] With the support of the Colombian people, Andres 
Pastrana is going to be the next president of Colombia. The 
reasons are threefold: 
  1. His understanding and practice of politics; 2. His 
serious, specific, and viable government program; and 3. His 
compatible, serious, and imaginative team of colleagues 
  1. Andres Pastrana understands and practices politics in a 
different way. He tries to surround himself with competent, 
upstanding people, no matter what party they belong to. He did 
this as mayor and in the Senate, where he worked with Liberals, 
Conservatives, and independents. Andres' multiparty philosophy 
stems from his own convictions about who he is and what politics 
is, convictions that he has demonstrated with deeds. This is 
unlike the multiparty approach that Samper Pizano has proclaimed 
at the eleventh hour, motivated by a publicity strategy as with 
so many of his proposals. 
  Andres is in tune with the new country. This is why every 
day 
he receives more support from young people, women, and 
independents. They are the spokespersons of a Colombia that is 
tired of empty promises, corruption, and political hucksterism. 
And they are key pieces in Andres' political agenda, as he 
believes in young people and in women, not because of their age 
or their sex but because of their potential, which has not been 
properly harnessed. 
  It is with good reason that Andres has been building his 
credibility among the public. Those who think that this campaign 
is and ought to be polarizing Liberals and Conservatives are 
wrong. This is a short-sighted view of the citizenry's position. 
At bottom, this campaign is about credibility and trust, about 
the person Colombians believe in and in whose hands they will 
place their country's future. In this regard, the support for 
Andres is telling. People know him; they know that he is 
straightforward, honest, committed, and experienced. Those who 
identify with the new politics acknowledge him as such. They 
remember his record as mayor; this is why more and more people 
are supporting his political agenda every day. 
  In contrast, the feeble single-party approach does not 
represent the new country. Political parties are going through 
an unprecedented crisis. It is a surprise to no one that 
patronage and corruption are no longer the exception but the 
rule, thus putting an end to ideological debate. They have 
replaced it with a simplistic blend of mechanical alliances and 
with subliminal messages that wind up trivializing politics. 
This shows that they underestimate our thoughtful, reflective 
young people, who would like to analyze and compare platforms 
before voting for a color or article of clothing of little 
significance. 
  Colombia is tired of lies. The incident involving Samper 
Pizano and Juan Gomez Martinez is truly regrettable. To offer 
the vice presidential nomination to the current governor of 
Antioquia and then to retract it is altogether irresponsible. It 
is worrisome that a presidential candidate's credibility has 
been undermined, to judge by the opinion poll that one radio 
news show conducted. The fact is that Samper Pizano should have 
acknowledged the offer he made and explained the political 
circumstances under which he did so. The country would have 
preferred a clear answer to a lie. 
  2. Andres Pastrana is the only candidate who has put a 
serious, specific, and viable government program before 
Colombia. For the first time in history a candidate has 
identified what the priorities of his administration would be, 
what they would cost, and where the revenue would come from. 
Andres' government program is, in itself, a development plan. It 
has a profound social content. Education, drinking water, and 
housing are priorities, because we want to make a leap towards 
development. Andres is committed to these issues and to the 
environment, infrastructure projects, agriculture and 
agribusiness, the modernization of government, security, 
justice, and a growing economy, based on the liberalization 
model, that can create more and better jobs, and his commitment 
is the result of a responsible analysis of national realities, 
of people's needs, and of ways to meet them. 
  Meanwhile, shallow proposals such as the ones that Samper 
Pizano made at the Economic Association of Friends of the 
Country, for example the need to update our antimonopoly 
legislation, reflect a lack of familiarity with the real world. 
When I was development minister, I issued the regulations for 
promoting competition that implemented the principles set forth 
in Law 155 of 1959 and that contain provisions designed to 
insure a free market without abuses by the players in it. This 
law is now being enforced. Therefore, to call for its updating 
when it has been in effect for barely a year is superfluous. The 
problem here is a lack not of laws but of political will. And 
Andres has never lacked will. 
  The other side's lack of a program is also worrisome. The 
country is aware of Samper Pizano's contradictions. Let me 
mention a few. In May 1993, for example, he said that "the 
circumstances that justify the legalization of drugs are more 
imperative now." But he later asserted that such a move "would 
be an insult to those who have been slain by narcoterrorism." 
During his time in the Development Ministry he fiercely attacked 
the liberalization policies of the administration he was 
serving, which cost him self-exile in Spain. Now, in contrast, 
he admits that he wholeheartedly backs such policies. Likewise, 
during his 1989 presidential campaign he defended patronage as 
"a personal relationship between a political leader and the 
community that he is trying to help." Today, however, realizing 
that this political practice is on the decline, he says that 
"patronage continues to exist and is worrisome." I share this 
concern with Colombia: our citizens want clear-cut positions, 
not vacillation. 
  3. Andres Pastrana has a compatible, serious, and 
imaginative 
team of insightful colleagues who can make adjustments. One of 
Andres' major virtues is that he knows what sort of people to 
surround himself with. He demonstrated this throughout his term 
as mayor and in the Senate. His campaign team is conscientious 
and works together. Most of us have known each other for many 
years; we are friends and we believe in Colombia and in Andres. 
None of us seeks personal gain. This is why we are working with 
enthusiasm and conviction. We have not had to make a pile of 
mistakes or heal rifts within the campaign staff, as the other 
side has. This quality has enabled us to remain in tune with 
each other and to act promptly, imaginatively, and tenaciously. 
  Andres Pastrana will be the next president of Colombia 
because he is an open, receptive man who understands and 
practices politics without sectarianism or clannishness. Because 
he has shown his independence by taking stands that benefit the 
country above and beyond groups and parties. Because he is a man 
of action, as he has shown in both the mayor's office and in 
Congress. Because he has the moral authority and the resolve 
needed to combat corruption. Because as a public official he has 
been steady and calm during crises and in handling problems of 
law and order. Because he is a team player and surrounds himself 
with good people. Because he is a man with renewal-oriented 
ideas. In short, because what Andres wants for Colombia is what 
the great majority of Colombians want.

  [Excerpt] Foreign Minister Luis Maria Ramirez Boettner 
stated on 12 April that our country does not have the resources 
to combat drug trafficking or other illegal activities. He 
indicated that this is why cooperation and help from the 
consumer countries is needed, and he proposed as a solution that 
"drug trafficking has to be fought where drugs are consumed." 
  Former Bolivian President Jaime Paz Zamora said these same 
words when he received the U.S. demand that his country must 
fight the cultivation of coca leaf, which is the raw material 
from which cocaine is produced. 
  During the past few days our country has been involved in 
the 
trafficking of drugs or other illegal activities such as the 
Brazilian "numbers game." When the foreign minister was asked 
what the government is doing to clear up the bad image that has 
been created, he said: "I believe the government is doing 
everything it can to control drug trafficking and other illegal 
activities. We do not have sufficient resources to combat drug 
trafficking, and the help Paraguay receives from the consumer 
countries is not very much." 
  He indicated that the government cannot perform miracles 
without the necessary resources. He stated that our country has 
requested cooperation and help from the consumer countries, 
"because drug trafficking must be fought where the drugs are 
consumed. Because if there is consumption and an good price, 
then without a doubt there will be production and the 
possibility of [drug] routes." 
  He then proposed another solution to this scourge: that the 
consumer countries emphasize aiding the countries where the drug 
is produced or in countries where drug routes are discovered.

  [Excerpt] The Palestine terrorist Imadal Mekdav [name as 
published], a Shiite who over the past few days became the most 
wanted man in this part of the continent, has again been located 
in Lebanon by Israeli security forces posted to that country. 
  Commissioner Enrique de Jesus Martinetti, chief of the 
National Police Intelligence Department, reported that he has 
received a confidential report confirming this data from the 
Israeli Intelligence Service. 
  "He (Imadal Mekdav) has again been located in Lebanon, and 
the Israeli Intelligence Service is on his heels. In any case it 
has been suggested that we continue the investigation, just in 
case there are ramifications," Martinetti said. 
  The police chief confirmed that Imadal Mekdav and another 
person arrived in a South American country--presumably Paraguay 
or Argentina--some weeks ago with the objective of attacking an 
Israeli diplomatic seat. 
  "This man and another Shiite came to Paraguay or Argentina. 
One of them returned immediately to the Middle East, but the 
other remained," the intelligence chief said. 
  Martinetti indicated that at present it is not known whether 
the Shiite came to Paraguay or to Argentina. "What is known is 
that the Israelis warned the Paraguayan and Argentine police 
forces that two Palestinians had arrived in one of the two 
countries, with unknown intentions. One of them remained 
somewhere around here. The report indicates that he came to 
carry out sabotage actions," Martinetti said. 
  "These people are fundamentalist fanatics that want to 
expand 
the struggle, known as the intifadah, against the Israelis in 
other parts of the world. And one of their ways is to attack 
diplomatic seats," he added. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] No less than 23 babies, most of whom apparently 
are in an irregular situation, were discovered during raids 
carried out in an Asuncion luxury hotel and in a day care center 
in Fernando de la Mora District. A legal expedition, headed by 
Judge Nelson Mora, initially discovered seven [number as 
published] babies in the day care center. Later, 16 babies were 
discovered in the Gran Hotel del Paraguay. It is estimated that 
11 babies might be in an illegal situation. 
  The operation began at noon on 12 April at the "Villa 
Esperanza" day care center at the intersection of Libertad 
Avenue and 25 de Agosto Street in Fernando de la Mora District. 
Three boys and four girls, ranging from three to six months of 
age, and a 22-day-old baby were in the day care center. 
  The woman running the day care center did not have any 
documents on the babies. Therefore, the judge banned the babies' 
removal from the day care center. The babies' adoption 
proceedings are being handled by Judges Jorge Amarilla, Ninfa 
Alcaraz, and Juan Angel Bernal. 
  At the day care center, the court officers discovered the 
records of three other babies: Natalia Caballero, Javier Olmedo, 
and Maria Elba Ramirez, all of whom are four months old. 
  According to Norma Saldivar, the woman running the day care 
center, these babies were at the Gran Hotel del Paraguay with 
their respective adoptive parents. These babies were scheduled 
to travel abroad on 12 April. Therefore, the judge ordered the 
immediate suspension of their adoption proceedings and went to 
the luxury hotel. 
  At the hotel, the judge, to his great surprise, confirmed 
that not only the three babies mentioned by Norma Saldivar were 
there, but many more. He immediately ordered an inventory to 
determine the number of babies there and if any of the three 
babies, whose whereabouts were reported as unknown [as 
published], were there. The three babies were actually at the 
hotel, along with 13 other babies, all of whom already were with 
their adoptive parents. Four of these babies reportedly are in 
an irregular situation. The adoption proceedings for the rest of 
the babies reportedly are under way or have been completed. 
  According to the documents carried by the people involved, 
it 
was learned that all the babies are bound to leave for the 
United States, specifically to Michigan, Ohio, Atlanta, and 
Minnesota. 
  Since the babies' origin is doubtful, the judge summoned the 
attorneys handling the adoption proceedings to present the 
babies' documents by 0800 today at the latest. 
  Judge Mora ordered that the mothers of the babies involved 
present themselves to the court to testify in order to confirm 
the conditions under which they delivered their babies for 
adoption. [passage omitted]

  [Text] In addition to the political reasons of the 
government majority in Congress for holding the 1995 general 
elections with the electoral system established in the current 
Constitution, there are concrete proposals of a technical nature 
to prevent the new electoral institutions from falling into the 
bureaucracy and slow procedures of the previous system. 
  For example, the National Election Board [JNE] will be 
reduced from the current six administrative levels to only 
three: National Board (five members); General Secretariat, 
Internal Control, and Auditing (at the same level); and third 
and last, Special Electoral Boards, Archives and Registry, 
Public Relations, and General Services. 
  In other words, it will have seven sections that, according 
to government bloc experts, will not need more than 30 employees. 
  It would be a National Election Board specialized in 
electoral justice. It would only be a court. 
  The technical report says the JNE currently has more than 
1,200 employees--without counting those on contract--and almost 
half of them are here in Lima. 
  Regarding the National Electoral Process Office, ONPE, the 
proposal for organizing this office has three levels: National 
Headquarters; Planning and Organization, and Control and 
Auditing; Decentralized Process Office, Information, General 
Services, and Electoral Procedures, which would be in charge of 
the systems, operations, and logistical offices. 
  The government experts said the ONPE should be a very small 
institution that should not have more than 30 employees, but 
temporary organizations with more employees can be established 
during elections. 
  This office is the most complex of all to the point that the 
Constitution itself says that the integration of all registries 
of the country in a single office--which currently are in the 
hands of the municipalities--will be made gradually.

  [Text] Mexican attorney Jose Enrique Gonzalez Ruiz and U.S. 
attorneys Peter Erlinder and Leonard Weinglass have been hired 
by the Shining Path [SL] International Emergency Committee (CIE) 
for the Defense of Abimael Guzman's Life, which has appeared 
before the Inter-American Human Rights Committee (CIDH) to 
condemn the Peruvian Government for the way it is treating the 
Maoist leader. 
  Colombian attorney Juan Jose Landinez, who travelled to Lima 
to support the SL efforts to get a group of legislators to visit 
Guzman Reinoso to check his health conditions, has joined the 
group of attorneys. 
  A large group of SL members believes Guzman has either died 
or is in a regrettable psychological state because they do not 
believe he is the author of the letter addressed to President 
Alberto Fujimori, and less still the person who appears on the 
videos asking his supporters to uphold the peace accord. 
  According to the latest "emergency bulletin" issued by the 
CIE, headquartered in London, so far five delegations of jurists 
and activists have arrived in Lima to ask the government and the 
Supreme Court of Military Justice to authorize a visit to Guzman. 
  However, despite the government's opposition, the SL abroad 
continues its efforts: "Other attorneys are ready to travel to 
Lima to continue working until an authorization to visit Guzman 
is granted (and) donations specifically for this juridical 
project are welcome. The (Peruvian) Government will not be left 
in peace on the subject," according to CIE members headed by 
Abimael Guzman's in-laws. 
  Moreover, a "Letter of Protest" that will be sent to 
President Fujimori has been circulated within U.S. intellectual 
and artistic circles. The letterhead reads: "I support the world 
demand that you end the abuse and isolation to which the 
president of the Peruvian Communist Party, Abimael Guzman, is 
subject." 
  As if this were not enough, the CIE has sent a delegation to 
the Philippines and Japan headed by Yuri Kochiyama and Carolyn 
Hadfield. 
  The SL is particularly interested in this visit to Japan 
because, in view of the fact that "Fujimori is of Japanese 
descent, the campaigns of slander and lies against Guzman and 
the peoples' war have been very spiteful in the Japanese media. 
Chauvinistically (sic), Fujimori has been adopted as a Japanese 
hero." 
  But they also are concerned over the fact that "since 
Fujimori assumed the presidency, financial ties between Japan 
and Peru have increased. During their visit to Japan, the CIE 
representatives will disclose Japan's true role in Peru." 
  The CIE, in its exhaustive effort, has got the Pakistani 
Human Rights Organization and the Kerala Communist Party of 
India [as published] to also start campaigns in Guzman's favor 
and to send letters of support to the CIDH. 
  As part of the campaign, the SL international branch also is 
distributing a video in English entitled "You Must Tell the 
World," describing the war unleashed against Guzman and his 
supporters. 
  The video includes clips of Guzman's address to the Dincote 
[National Counterterrorism Directorate], actions perpetrated by 
terrorists who infiltrated the Raucana settlement, and 
interviews with attorneys Luis Arce Borja; Guzman's lawyer, 
Alfredo Crespo Baygrac; and the leader of the International 
Revolutionary Movement, MRI, Heriberto Ocasio, who was in Lima 
praising Guzman and his outrageous actions. 
  The only obstacles the SL has found abroad was the Belgian 
Government's decision not to allow Adolfo Olaechea Cahuas to 
enter the country. Olaechea was supposed to attend an event on 
Peru in Brussels organized by the Belgian Anti-Imperialist 
League. 
  Olaechea ended up sending a video recording of his address 
to 
the event in which, for a change, he asserts that the people's 
war will win despite everything. 
  Is that all the Foreign Ministry was able to do? Is it aware 
of the Shining Path propaganda agents' presence in Japan?

  [Text] Lima, 12 Apr (EFE) [date as received] -- The 
Peruvian press reported on 13 April that the arrest of "Red 
Path" terrorist group leader Oscar Ramirez Durand, alias 
"Comrade Feliciano," is imminent. 
  According to the newspaper EXPRESO, National 
Counterterrorism 
Directorate (Dincote) agents on 11 April found a trail leading 
to "Feliciano" when they raided a house in Lima's Callao Port 
where Red Path leaders held meetings. 
  Five people were arrested in the raid and in addition 
Dincote 
agents seized guns and propaganda implicating the so-called Red 
Path "Central Committee" and the "Lima Metropolitan Committee" 
headed by Ramirez Durand. 
  EXPRESO reported that according to a Dincote spokesperson, 
it 
is known that Feliciano is in Lima with some of his main 
lieutenants and that Dincote is following his footsteps. 
  In the last two weeks, Dincote has arrested in Lima more 
than 
20 Red Path terrorists, some of whom, it seems, have supplied 
information that will lead to the arrest of their main leaders. 
  "Red Path" is an armed group that split from the "Shining 
Path" Maoist gang, rebelled against Shining Path top-ranking 
leader Abimael Guzman, and rejected the peace negotiations 
Guzman currently is holding with the government. 
  Guzman decided to negotiate a peace agreement with the 
government in September 1993, one year after his arrest, in two 
letters addressed to Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori in 
which he admits the political and military defeat of the Shining 
Path, which took up arms in 1980.

<F P=106> [Interview with General Tomas Marky, chief of the Ayacucho </F>
Political-Military Command, by correspondent Abilio Arroyo; 
place and date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Arroyo] After 14 years, what is the situation 
of subversion in Ayacucho where the fighting began? 
  [Marky] It has been reduced considerably. I believe the 
reason for this success--in addition to the capture of [Shining 
Path, SL, leader] Abimael Guzman--is basically the union between 
the population and the police. This is why our first objective 
was to gain and keep the support of the population without which 
it would have been impossible to defeat the SL. The people are 
currently cooperating with us and the 51st Los Cabitos Garrison 
now has a different image. This was possible thanks to our road 
development and civic action program. 
  [Arroyo] What role do the peasant defense patrols and 
self-defense committees play in the antisubversive struggle? 
  [Marky] The peasant defense patrols have helped tremendously 
in the pacification program. I would say that this is one of the 
factors that caused the SL to crash. About 60 percent of the 
rural population is organized in patrols. 
  [Arroyo] There are, however, many accusations of abuse by 
the 
defense patrols which sometimes involve the security forces. 
What measures have you taken? 
  [Marky] There are isolated cases of abuse. As you can 
understand, Ayacucho Department is large and it is not possible 
to guarantee adequate action. We learn about the abuses from our 
patrols which are permanently covering the zone. If there is a 
serious mistake, we immediately report it to the court. This is 
why some peasant defense patrol members are under arrest. Abuses 
happen within the context of a war and are comprehensible but 
they are not part of the antisubversive policy. It is like in 
any institution, if someone commits a crime he is reported to 
justice and punished. 
  [Arroyo] How many of the settlements that were abandoned are 
coming back with life in Ayacucho? 
  [Marky] There are 30 settlements. The newest are 
Nununhuaycco, Umaru, Marccaraccay, and all the settlements in 
Uchuraccay. We give them security with a military patrol. These 
settlements are taking great steps to return to tranquility and 
going back to agriculture gradually. There is also a food 
program from the Pronaa [National Food Assistance Program] and 
the PAR [Rapid Assistance Post] which are creating the basic 
conditions for the people to live in a dignified manner in their 
communities. This means reconstruction of houses, medical posts, 
and schools. This is important because in the past the people 
returned to their communities in a disorganized manner. Perhaps 
not everyone will return to the communities, especially the 
youth who have already adjusted to city life. Many people long 
to return to their land and prefer their community instead of 
promiscuity and poverty far from their home. We help with the 
transportation and every other way we can. 
  [Arroyo] When did the strategy in Ayacucho change? 
  [Marky] Last year. It was realized that it was necessary to 
stop giving priority to repression and to concentrate on 
development. We took advantage of the legal framework of Law 
24150 and Legislative Decree 749 which modified Article 5 of 
this law regarding the rights of the Political-Military 
Commands. [passage omitted] 
  [Arroyo] Is it true that the Apurimac valley is the second 
Huallaga due to the "cocalization" of the zone and the increased 
drug trafficking? 
  [Marky] Denying that would be like trying to cover the sun 
with a finger. These people have no good roads and the prices of 
coffee and cocoa are very low. There is not much incentive to 
grow those products, so many people are now growing coca. We do 
not repress coca growing because the Enaco [National Coca 
Enterprise] is in the area and there are many legal coca 
growers. But we are not naive, part of that production is used 
for drugs. 
  As the zone is wide and long, we would need many people to 
fight it. We are doing it but we need specialized personnel, 
perhaps a police base like the one in Santa Lucia to give us 
greater logistical support with radar in this struggle. I have 
information on the clandestine airfields in the zone but we have 
no means to control them. If we go to one place to fight 
trafficking, these people with their resources will move their 
illegal trafficking. This is why it is urgent to promote 
alternative development instead of repressive measures. 
  [Arroyo] How do you evaluate the subversion in that zone? 
  [Marky] That question will allow me to clarify a statement 
on 
a television program that the red flag was flying over the 
Apurimac River valley. That is not true. I know that zone and I 
can assure you that the SL was eradicated from there. The latest 
subversive outbreaks occurred in Viscatan where we intervened to 
evict the subversives. We fired on them with gunships, our 
military patrols captured many subversives and seized an 
important arsenal. We have information that the subversives are 
returning through the Sello de Oro zone but we will pounce at 
any moment. 
  [Arroyo] And in other zones of Ayacucho? 
  [Marky] Very little, we know of the presence of a few 
subversives in the zone of Rasuhuillca, Huanta, but we are 
permanently patrolling that area. With the information provided 
by the subversives who repented, we have discovered several SL 
hideouts which prompted the subversives to migrate to other 
regions. 
  [Arroyo] How many SL members do you estimate are operating 
in 
Ayacucho? 
  [Marky] I cannot say, but there are only a few. Their 
internal struggles have led to murder. One SL leader was 
murdered a month and a half ago. We were surprised because it 
involved Engineer Chocce, the departmental director of the 
Transportation and Communications Ministry. The police found in 
his house several letters of obedience to "President Gonzalo" 
and other letters recriminating him for the lack of action in 
Ayacucho. 
  [Arroyo] Did you know him? 
  [Marky] Yes. We suspected he was a terrorist because a 
repented terrorist reported him. After a police interrogation, 
and as no concrete evidence linking him with subversion was 
found, he was released and resumed his work as an important 
Transportation and Communications Ministry official. He held 
meetings with everybody, including us, and kept a close watch of 
the work in his sector. Then one day he was found dead on the 
slope of the Acuchimay with a SL sign saying: "This how the 
traitors of the party die." 
  [Arroyo] Did he participate in the SL Committee meetings? 
  [Marky] Never, he was a low ranking official at a regional 
level. He did, however, participate in official meetings. This 
case has helped us adjust and improve our intelligence service, 
making it more selective and much more accurate, to identify 
terrorists and their aides who have infiltrated public 
institutions. 
  [Arroyo] Does this mean there are terrorists in the city? 
  [Marky] Very few. They have repented and want nothing to do 
with the SL column that continues to perpetrate terrorist 
actions. Proof of this is that since last year there have been 
no actions such as the feared "armed strikes" in the city. In 
the education field, there might be some cases of 
indoctrination, but we are detecting them gradually. We believe 
some teachers were recruited through fear. They have now changed 
now and want peace. Not long ago members of the SUTE [Trade 
Union of Education Workers] of Huamanga requested permission to 
hold a rally and I granted it. They held their rally peacefully.

<F P=106> [Interview with President Luis Alberto Lacalle by EL PAIS </F>
reporters Walter Sanchez and Heraclio Labandera; place and date 
not given] 
  [Excerpts] [EL PAIS] What was the scope of your meeting 
with U.S. President Bill Clinton in Washington? 
  [Lacalle] Apart from being a meeting between the Uruguayan 
president and the U.S. President -- the world's most important 
political personality -- the occasion on which the meeting was 
held gave it certain special characteristics. While the 
continent's presidents were in Chile (when President Eduardo 
Frei assumed the presidency), we received a fax giving us an 
advance copy of a letter, which was later received by our 
secretaries, in which President Clinton expounded his idea of a 
summit of democratically elected presidents in Miami in 
December. Our meeting, which was held at the White House, had 
two distinct parts: The first part was held with the director of 
the National Security Agency and the under secretary for Latin 
American Affairs; and the second with these two gentlemen and 
President Clinton himself. The topics that dominated the 
meeting included the calling of the presidential summit, its 
role, my opinion of the idea, and what I thought my colleagues' 
opinions would be. President Clinton's summons is formulated in 
a two-page letter: In other words, it is more than an 
invitation. He outlines an idea that I would like to elaborate 
on because it was the main topic that we discussed. He has 
chosen December for the summit, which is too far off -- from 
March to December is practically a whole year. In one paragraph 
he writes: "From now until December we must work together to 
ensure that the agenda of this summit will be very ample and 
very productive." 
  He indicates some topics: "We must jointly consider the best 
way to strengthen democracy, to improve the quality of 
governments, to collectively defend democracy, to promote 
economic growth through expanded trade and larger investments, 
and to advance toward a sustained development strategy that will 
protect the environment and help overcome poverty." 
  He then states that a certain point of the meeting had to be 
highlighted because it was the most discussed. He says: "I see 
this summit as a process. Between now and December we should 
organize a series of very intense consultations between 
governments. I also foresee meetings among non-government and 
government organizations, including meetings with government 
officials, to formulate new initiatives for their organizations 
and for the summit. A productive summit should generate 
consensus, give impetus to new ideas, channel a series of 
meetings between ministers, and strengthen multilateral 
mechanisms." At this point, I tried to evaluate the difference 
between this meeting and others. At this point we must recall 
that all U.S. presidents, practically without exception since 
Franklin Roosevelt, have had initiatives for Latin America. We 
had the "Good Neighbor Policy," which was the first, then the 
"Alliance for Progress," then the "Americas Initiative" just to 
mention a few. In other words, they all -- under different 
names -- have attempted to create stronger links with Latin 
America. I told President Clinton that, from the contents of 
his letter and from his invitation, my intuition told me he was 
less interested in a meeting of governments and more interested 
in a meeting of nations, because this will be more than just a 
meeting of governments, of foreign or economy ministers; the 
meeting should include society's intermediate organizations, 
businessmen, cultural and educational sectors, and 
non-government organizations that today are having more and more 
importance within society. We were in complete agreement. 
Without pretending that one meeting will overcome the 
disagreements we may have with the United States or that one 
meeting will bring immediate results -- because one has lived 
long enough to know that this is not the way things happen -- if 
President Clinton's formula is accomplished, then I believe this 
meeting will see the presidents complete a process instead of 
just initiating and beginning a new one. 
  Interpreting and sharing President Clinton's thoughts allow 
us to suppose that the Chambers of Commerce of the involved 
countries should get together. Calling a meeting relative to a 
specific type of activity will more probably facilitate 
agreements because the interests of those involved are 
concentrated and intensified. The same can be said of any type 
of rectorial meeting. There is understanding among sectors 
because the world is interdependent. One can speak as an 
educator on topics that are as problematic in the United States 
as they are in our country. Talking about investment or trade 
brings us to the same conclusion. Thus, I believe doing things 
this way is much more intelligent and complex. Those meetings 
will be more difficult than getting 20 presidents to sit 
together, because drafting a good declaration and listening to 
erudite speeches is quite easy. It only takes 15 to 20 days to 
prepare. But this other way of doing things is much more 
ambitious because the interests at various levels have to be 
ironed out. This is where I see the strength and importance 
that this meeting can have if this kind of libretto and proposal 
are accomplished. But everything must be done in a coordinated 
manner. Our idea is to get the Rio Group to have the summit as 
the main topic on its agenda; we will thus know how we will 
respond collectively to this invitation. It will be useless if 
only the Uruguayan, Chilean, or Peruvian Governments are in 
agreement when the others are not. 
  [EL PAIS] Is this an attempt to reactivate -- under another 
name -- President Bush's Americas Initiative ? 
  [Lacalle] The Americas Initiative represented a qualitative 
change. Let us not forget it was based on aid for opportunity 
and loans for investment. It represented a major change. This 
was after the 1970's and the 1980's when foreign aid was 
requested and credits were easily obtained. It may seem a 
platitude to say this, but those loans had to be repaid. 
Partnership in a venture, however, is not repaid because risks 
are shared. This is why we were one of the first to share and 
endorse, together with President Bush, that qualitative change. 
And yet, this new proposal goes even deeper. President Bush 
proposed the Americas Initiative, which so recently constituted 
progress. This president has now presented a panoply that 
includes trade and investment, and other subjects like the 
environment, the sustainability of development processes, and 
the strengthening and enhancement of government management. 
This makes the project quite ambitious. The risk of convening 
such a summit is, perhaps, the fact that as it is so 
all-encompassing and so complex, it may meet with more 
difficulties. Notwithstanding this, I think some conclusions 
may be drawn from this -- President Clinton's -- outlook. The 
first is that his government was not satisfied with having 
established NAFTA, which was one of the risks we foresaw. We 
said: The U.S. Government has signed a trade and economic 
agreement with one of the leading countries in Latin America and 
may therefore deem that this is enough. The U.S. Government did 
so because Mexico might cast a shadow on the U.S. horizon. The 
U.S. Government is, however, aiming beyond the horizon and at 
other countries. I believe that, by joining societies rather 
than administrations, it will achieve greater strength because 
our administrations will be changing. In December, when I am 
scheduled to represent my country, I already will know who will 
be my successor. In other words, in December my administration 
will end within 60 days. Therefore, if we achieve agreements, 
plans, and goals among associations which do not have terms of 
office as we the presidents have, then it will be a process 
involving the entire society. Therefore, at first glance, I 
believe this proposal is different, interesting, profound, and 
complex, but also very attractive. 
  The integration process was another issue that President 
Clinton and I discussed. We are constantly quoting [former 
Bolivian] President [Jaime] Paz Zamora, who said the American 
integration process must be modular and contemporary. Instead 
of attempting to achieve everything at the same time, NAFTA was 
established to strengthen the North, while the Mercosur [Common 
Market of the South] will soon be established. Coincidentally, 
an effort is being made to link these processes at a higher 
level. Thus, our relationship would be facilitated. During my 
visit, I mentioned that we -- the four Mercosur countries -- 
have signed with the United States a treaty called "4 + 1," 
comprising the four Mercosur countries and the United States. I 
suggested making it into a "4 + 3" treaty, comprising the 
Mercosur countries, Canada, Mexico, and the United States. In 
this way, seven nations would be linked. 
  [EL PAIS] Did they accept the proposal? 
  [Lacalle] The idea has been sown. No one will say yes to an 
idea instantly. I left it with them. We will take the proposal 
to our Mercosur partners first. We will see if we can discuss 
it during the next presidential summit. I think it is a good 
idea. It is, above all, logical. The conversation then moved 
around these two main topics. I think Mercosur is acquiring an 
increasingly important international stature. The same happened 
with the European Union [EU], with which we have a 12 + 4 
proposal -- that is, the EU plus Mercosur. Europeans constantly 
refer to Mercosur as an entity. That is our big responsibility. 
We must develop and launch Mercosur. This does not mean that 
we must reject other ideas. We cannot change or start anything 
new until we finish building Mercosur. The Uruguayan Government 
position is: First finish building Mercosur. When all problems 
are overcome and the organization begins functioning, which we 
expect will occur before June, then we will be able to look 
around. It will probably take 20 years, easily, from the time 
Mercosur starts operating until it becomes effective. It is a 
very difficult task. I think it has granted the four member 
countries a personality in the world we must appreciate. When 
Mercosur is finished, there will be four commercially organized 
groups in the world: The EU, NAFTA, Mercosur, and the Far East 
agreements. It is a very small league. Just think what it 
means for our country to be, through Mercosur, in what we can 
call "the first division" of world economic and commercial 
matters. These two issues will give us a lot of work and are 
very positive. During my trip I repeatedly said that Latin 
America is not part of the problem but part of the solution. It 
is an area that does a lot of trade with the United States. The 
zone has political and economic stability. Figures are 
constantly improving. It is a good field for investment. The 
zone has resolved its debt problem to a good extent. We are no 
longer ballast, the lead weight on the fishing line, the problem 
that sometimes we did not even want to look at. Problems in 
Latin America have been gradually ironed out. This is the 
message I took to Washington. 
  [EL PAIS] The "Americas Society" held an important meeting 
in 
Punta del Este recently. Within the framework of our 
international agenda, what can you tell us about that meeting? 
  [Lacalle] That is not an international agenda of the same 
level. The "Americas Society" has existed for many years. 
Every year it visits different areas of the world with some of 
its main associates. People from Argentina, Uruguay, Chile, and 
Brazil are represented. It is not a strictly North American 
entity. It is based in New York, but many countries are 
represented. What is the purpose of the organization? Mutual 
understanding and better knowledge of reality. The previous 
meeting, if I recall, was in Chile. This time the association 
met in Buenos Aires and Punta del Este, trying to cover 
Argentina and Uruguay at the same time. We talked about the 
situation, just as we do with the many groups that visit us. In 
this case [Economy and Finance Minister Ignacio de] Posadas 
spoke about our economic situation. Then [former President Luis 
Maria] Sanguinetti spoke about integration on Saturday morning. 
I gave the closing speech around noon. Many people said it was 
a "surprise visit" of the "Americas Society." We knew about the 
visit seven months in advance and announced it. It was a 
meeting of important people, a meeting of important economic 
groups. It is never a bad idea to let them know about the 
process of change in our country. 
  [EL PAIS] Right, but is this visit not in the context of 
what 
was proposed by President Bill Clinton, that is, to take 
integration to the continent's private sphere? 
  [Lacalle] Yes, yes, of course. I think people are 
increasingly aware of the idea. Politicians and diplomats' work 
is increasingly one of opening doors, building bridges, and then 
stepping aside to let those interested walk through. These 
people could be economic or cultural agents, or anyone 
interested in a proposal. 
  [EL PAIS] You criticized Congress several times during your 
trips abroad. Many people wondered if you would renew your 
attacks during your state of the nation address on 15 March. 
  [Lacalle] First we must clarify the word criticism. We 
always take the word criticism as meaning something bad. We 
almost consider it as a synonym of "insult" or "attack." Those 
in the political arena who cannot tolerate criticism have chosen 
the wrong profession. I find it amusing that when I state the 
number of times Congress could not muster a majority to pass a 
bill -- without adding adjectives, just mentioning facts -- 
people feel I am attacking and insulting Congress. Let us not 
forget the number of times the executive branch was subjected to 
the most atrocious -- and here I will not use the word criticism 
-- attacks, insults, and inventions. It's the same old story. 
It looks like a one-way street. We have been described as 
"disorganized," "irresponsible," "that we do not know how," 
"that we do not get things done," without counting the personal 
attacks directed against ministers, their personal life, and 
their honesty. Is it not so? If we count the number of times 
we were attacked the list will be very long. When I talk to my 
fellow countrymen, I am usually frank and I say, for instance, 
that the police need more than arms and pick-up trucks when they 
launch an operation. When our policemen subsequently face a 
criminal and the situation tells him he might have to use his 
gun, he needs to know that we accept he is representing the law. 
This does not mean we give them a blank check, but we must give 
them the assurance that he will be supported. Well, when I say 
Congress has not voted on the bill regulating this area since it 
was presented three years ago, I am only stating a fact. I do 
not believe this is an attack but an attempt to state who is 
responsible. I have enough with the executive branch 
shortcomings. If you want changes in some fields you need 
executive branch cooperation. I can list those fields. I say 
this as a matter of fact, I do not add a single adjective. I am 
sorry if someone is annoyed because I say this. 
  [EL PAIS] Your administration has only a few months to go. 
Do you feel you had the congressional support you expected? 
  [Lacalle] I remind you of what I said during my state of the 
nation address. One-third of my speech was taken up with 
explaining the conditions under which the government had to 
operate. It is already known that the next government will not 
have a congressional majority and will have to form a coalition. 
You have seen the result of my government's coalition. Results 
have been interpreted in different ways because we were able to 
obtain a majority of votes for several projects, perhaps not as 
quickly as expected or as quickly as I would have wanted. I 
conceived a parliamentary type of government with different 
blocs negotiating and giving speed and assurance to 
congressional action. I have no doubt that those who supported 
the proposal to end the car insurance monopoly in 1993 could 
have acted in 1990. I have no doubt that the port reform could 
have been approved earlier. There were occasions when votes 
were there and other occasions when they were not. You are 
aware of the most outstanding case, the case of the bill 
reforming the social security system, without a doubt... 
  [EL PAIS] That was a great frustration... 
  [Lacalle] Frustration was not the word. It was an objective 
that we could not achieve. We said before the election that we 
had to do something about it. We talked to all party leaders 
here at government house. The BPS [Social Security Bank] 
greatly participated, explaining that it was necessary to do 
something to defend the system, to strengthen it. The system 
has a deficit that year after year has to be covered by the 
national budget. It is a very heavy burden for the country. The 
deficit amounted to some $200 million in 1993. These funds 
could have been used elsewhere, or total spending could have 
been reduced. This is something that the next government will 
have to face, no matter who is the next president. The problem 
involves us all. Pensioners trust the BPS will continue as a 
strong bank that will continue to pay their pensions, including 
the important recent increase. Pension adjustments were several 
percentage points above the inflation rate. This was a great 
improvement. It is also important for those who contribute and 
want to leave their savings in a place that will give them their 
pensions later. Contributions also affect the cost of products. 
There is no doubt that social security contributions are a very 
heavy burden on productive activities. If there is a topic of 
national scope, this is it. The government I have the honor to 
preside over has a clear conscience because we tried to 
administer a solution to the problem several times. We did not 
want to impose our solution, nor did we hear alternative 
proposals. Our proposals received a no, a no, and a no, but we 
never saw an alternative proposal. Our responsibility here is 
totally in the clear. 
  [EL PAIS] Have some representatives from the Batllist Forum 
criticized your handling of the Armed Forces? 
  [Lacalle] It ill behooves me to sing my own praises. I can 
only say that I have abided by the Constitution and the law, and 
that during my administration the Armed Forces have been totally 
and absolutely subject to the legitimate command -- the 
president of the Republic. 
  [EL PAIS] Do you believe La Republica University is keeping 
up with the times? 
  [Lacalle] The university is undergoing a dramatic and 
positive change. We recently discussed this with university 
authorities, noting that it is coming into contact with the real 
world by drafting reports for public and private companies, and 
by selling its services -- like some of the most prestigious 
universities in the world -- to obtain financial resources. 
This new phase in university life is, therefore, most welcome. 
I believe, however, that the university still finds it 
difficult to adapt to these changes; it does not instigate 
change. 
  [EL PAIS] What would you tell your detractors about the 
exchange lag? 
  [Lacalle] I think this subject has been analyzed by experts. 
In my view, the cost of running the government weighs heavily on 
the exchange lag. The current exchange situation stems from the 
adverse effect of this cost on the economy, something which we 
have been trying to eradicate since we assumed office. We 
believe the decline in inflation will be instrumental in 
breaching that gap and that a relatively strong currency is a 
better indicator than a devalued one. To those who criticize 
this, I would ask them to publicly identify a better 
alternative, whether to devalue or to liquidate the assets of 
all those who have a fixed income. 
  [EL PAIS] The constitutional reform is beginning to take 
shape. Some contend that there is agreement while others deny 
this. What is your opinion? 
  [Lacalle] For obvious reasons, I have not been directly 
involved in the dealings of Congress, but I have been following 
all the latest developments. [Senator Walter] Santoro, [Senator 
Juan Andres] Ramirez, and [Vice President Gonzalo] Aguirre have 
always kept me informed. They assure me that congressmen 
reached consensus and an agreement will be voted on. [passage 
omitted] 
  [EL PAIS] The press insists that President Lacalle's choice 
as presidential candidate is Senator Juan Andres Ramirez ... 
  [Lacalle] That will be settled by the Herreraist Convention, 
at which I suppose -- and believe -- my comrades will take my 
opinion into account. 
  [EL PAIS] ... in your capacity as leader of the Herreraist 
sector ... 
  [Lacalle] No, just as a comrade. 
  [EL PAIS] Do you think that this "primary election" may give 
rise to splits within the sector? You are its leader and 
should know how to handle it ... 
  [Lacalle] The doors of the different factions swing; one can 
go in and out through those doors; no one is a prisoner. I have 
heard my comrades voice their feelings of unity and vocation to 
serve the Herreraist sector. This is not limited to just one 
person, it goes beyond that. 
  [EL PAIS] Do you want the Blanco Party to field a common 
candidate for Montevideo mayoralty? 
  [Lacalle] That issue has not been formally raised for 
consideration. Therefore, it will depend on what my 
distinguished comrades say when their opinion is sought. I 
would thus discuss that when the situation presents itself. We 
have to see if there will be a constitutional reform. This is 
an important consideration to be taken into account. 
  [EL PAIS] Your wife recently made some remarks to the effect 
that women in Uruguay play a marginal role in politics and that 
she will run in the November elections if the people request 
that she do so. 
  [Lacalle] Well, you should ask her about that. My considered 
opinion is that Julia Pou [de Lacalle] is a very intelligent 
person who is most able to communicate. She has made herself 
known through her works, her activities. She could have stayed 
at home during these past five years and that would have spared 
her much distress. Yet, it is incumbent upon her to reply to 
your question. There is total and absolute equality at home. 
  [EL PAIS] What will President Lacalle do after 1 March 1995? 
Will he continue to be involved in politics? 
  [Lacalle] Yes, because I opted for this walk of life when I 
was 17 years old. Thus, it is rather difficult to change my 
path.

  [Excerpt] The office of the Chamber of Deputies is due to 
announce its official position tonight regarding the resolution 
passed by the Senate office headed by Senator Sansaricq 
regarding the application of Article 149 of the Constitution. 
The president of the Chamber of Deputies is scheduled to address 
the nation on the evening of Wednesday [13 April] on the crisis. 
On 12 April, the office led by Sen. Sansaricq submitted the text 
of the 10 April resolution to the office of the lower chamber. 
  Questioned on this document, the president of the deputies 
expressed serious reservations regarding the future of this 
resolution. Deputy Monde thinks that it is necessary to fill the 
institutional vacuum. However, Monde explains that it cannot be 
done in just any manner. Deputy Monde calls the conference on 10 
April, which led to the resolution on Article 149, a pirate 
action. The president of the lower chamber indicates that 
hidden, major, economic interests are behind this resolution. 
[passage omitted] 
  Moreover, the president of the Chamber of Deputies 
maintained 
that his colleagues would not give in to the senators' pressures.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Costa Rican President-elect Jose </F>
Figueres by reporter Roberto Reyes at Toncontin International 
Airport; from "The Morning Paper" newscast; date not given -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] Costa Rican President-elect Jose Maria Figueres and 
his entourage are en route to El Salvador. Members of his 
cabinet are also accompanying Figueres, who will take office on 
8 May. We have Figueres' remarks while he was at the country's 
largest airport, Toncontin International Airport. 
  [Begin recording, in progress] [Figueres] ....the meetings I 
will hold during the coming months, such as the Ibero American 
meeting, which will be held in Cartagena in June. (?My meeting 
here) was very advantageous. I want to have the best of 
relations with Honduras. I want to have constant, permanent, 
and very fluid relations that will allow us to deal with our 
problems. 
  [Reyes] Mr. President-elect, will Central America's 
integration be strengthened now that Costa Rica will be 
participating directly and firmly, and did you discuss Central 
America's drug-trafficking problem with President Reina? 
  [Figueres] President Reina told me of his concern and firm 
decision to combat every manifestation of drug trafficking. We 
have that same idea in Costa Rica. I believe this is an area in 
which we can cooperate and truly strengthen both countries' 
efforts to be more effective. Drug trafficking is one of modern 
society's everyday problems today, and we must do everything 
within our capability so that the problem will not affect 
Honduras, Costa Rica and, of course, other countries. I believe 
this is an area in which we can make great progress with our 
other Central American neighbors. 
  [Reyes] Will you continue to visit Honduras after you are 
president? 
  [Figueres] Of course, quite frequently. [Words indistinct] 
of seeing me here. 
  [Reyes] Was Central American integration the main topic you 
discussed with the Honduran president? 
  [Figueres] Yes. Costa Rica is keenly interested in making a 
significant contribution to a more effective and beneficial 
integration by all of our countries. 
  [Reyes] What effect will the North American Free Trade 
Agreement between Mexico, Canada, and the United States have on 
Central American unity? 
  [Figueres] That must be decided by all the presidents and 
countries. It is, of course, a topic we must study, and I am 
sure it will take up a considerable portion of agendas for 
future meetings we will hold. 
  [Reyes] Has your assembly made any arrangements for Costa 
Rica to finally become a member of all the Central American 
organizations? 
  [Figueres] We are going to have a new assembly, and we will 
have to see what the deputies think. Meanwhile, we can make 
progress in many other areas. There is much to be done 
concerning the economy and trade, and we want to do all we can 
to emulate Honduras, which is engaged in a permanent struggle 
for Central American integration. 
  [Reyes] Are your views on this issue essential to a decision 
by the assembly? 
  [Figueres] I do not think so. Our legislative branch is 
independent of the executive branch. I can contribute my grain 
of sand so that things in Central America will go as well as 
possible within the legislative sphere. Certain sectors in 
Costa Rica oppose joining the Central American Parliament, 
however, and I hope that as time passes we will gradually defeat 
that position. I will not engage in that debate for now; we 
must progress in other issues, an attitude which is much more 
positive and constructive. 
  [Reyes] In conclusion, Mr. Figueres, did the Honduran 
president confirm to you and your entourage he will attend your 
inauguration on 8 May? 
  [Figueres] He did, and I am very pleased and satisfied over 
that. 
  [Reyes] A final word for the Honduran people? 
  [Figueres] A strong embrace, a warm greeting, and wishes of 
success for the four years that lie ahead. Costa Rica will 
always be at your service to help as much as it can, be it a 
little or much. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Esperanza Navarro Francois] </F>
  [Text] President Guillermo Endara said yesterday that on 
Monday he will announce a decision that "has made him ill." 
There are persistent rumors that he will be on leave from the 
Presidency and will be replaced by Vice President Guillermo Ford. 
  "Unfortunately I cannot say much today because I am sick, 
probably due to a decision I had to make, which I will announce 
Monday on a national network," Endara stressed. 
  He said that the decision will be announced on a national 
network on 18 April at 2000. 
  In a statement to reporters aboard the National Air Service 
(SAN) aircraft, Panama Governor Daphne Clement said Endara will 
announce a leave of absence, but she did not specify the reasons. 
  Endara's remarks came during the inauguration of the Silvio 
Salazar Bridge in the Colon Free Zone, which links France Field 
with the old section of that commercial center. 
  In the presence of Vice President Guillermo Ford; ministers 
of state; directors of autonomous and semi-autonomous 
institutions; provincial, municipal, and religious authorities; 
businessmen; merchants; and Colon Free Zone tenants; Endara said 
he could not give any further details on his "decision," 
although he admitted it was "tough and controversial." 
  Endara also said that the decree-law requiring that amounts 
exceeding $10,000 be declared when brought into the country is 
intended to keep money obtained from drug trafficking or money 
laundering from entering the country. 
  Endara noted that the decree-law was the result of numerous 
consultations with the banking sector and the Free Zone and that 
its economic impact on both sectors has been analyzed. 
  Endara did not deny that Finance Ministry officials could be 
involved in mishandling funds while carrying out the decree-law, 
but he said that this possibility has been reviewed and control 
measures implemented. 
  "It is a tough and controversial measure, but it cannot be 
avoided, Endara stressed. [quotation marks as published]

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 13 Apr (NA) -- Cuban Foreign Minister 
Roberto Robaina stressed this afternoon that the debt his 
country has not yet settled with Argentina "is not an issue that 
has been frozen." In this regard, he expressed his government's 
willingness to seek alternative repayment methods. 
  The diplomat, who is paying a 48-hour official visit to 
Argentina, also denied negotiations for a meeting between 
President Carlos Menem and Cuban leader Fidel Castro during an 
upcoming Ibero-American summit in Cartagena de Indias. 
  In remarks made in the Senate, Robaina added: "The 
possibilities are always open. It depends on the activities 
each one of them has during the summit. My visit's goal, 
however, is not to prepare a meeting. Thus far, there is 
nothing on this issue."

<F P=106> [Article by Foreign Minister Celso Amorim] </F>
  [Text] Brazilian foreign policy is bound by the permanent 
doctrines and principles specified in the Constitution. The 
central characteristics of our foreign affairs activities can be 
summarized in the following basic objectives: to pursue national 
development, establish democratic values, defend international 
peace and security, and struggle for a politically fairer 
international economic order. 
  The illusion that a new order has been created following the 
end of the Cold War, fortunately, is already been discarded. We 
are living a period of transition between two structures -- like 
so many other times in history -- and it is difficult to 
forecast how long it will last. The most marked characteristics 
of this period can be concocted into unsteadiness between 
political hegemony -- which is currently concentrated in a 
single center -- and economic hegemony which is concentrated 
into at least three centers. Another characteristic is the 
revival of conflicts based on cultural and ethnical differences, 
although this sort of conflict seems to have already been 
forgotten. 
  As it is well known, changes in the international order 
present risks and opportunities. Brazil's role in the new 
international order is still in the "pending" tray. In face of 
the frequently mentioned dichotomies between globalism and 
regionalism, we must consider a basic surmise: As a result of 
its size, its complexity, its social fabric, the ethnical and 
cultural composition of its population, and the diversification 
of its trade partners, Brazil must have a foreign policy with 
universalist characteristics and discard the possibility of 
making exclusivist options. This, however, does not prevent our 
policy from having priorities and different emphases. I will 
refer to some of them. 
  The first priority that comes to our minds is South America 
where we have been intensifying contact with our neighbor 
countries. The consolidation of democracy in the continent has 
facilitated the materialization of informal mechanisms of 
political consultation -- such as the Rio Group -- and 
stimulated the adoption of measures to overcome old suspicions 
and antagonisms. 
  In the regional sphere, we are decisively engaged in an 
ambitious project to consolidate integration within the 
framework of the Common Market of the South [Mercosur], with any 
corrections that may prove necessary. The implementation of the 
zero-customs tax within Mercosur continues to advance as 
foreseen, with a strong positive impact on trade among the four 
countries. Trade among these countries has increased virtually 
300 percent since the Asuncion Treaty was signed in 1991. 
  The Mercosur priority is complemented with two initiatives 
launched during Itamar Franco's administration: First, to 
negotiate a series of accords for economic complementation with 
the countries of the Amazon region and, second, a proposal for 
the establishment of a South American Free Trade Area (SAFTA), 
which will comprise the countries that make up Mercosur, the 
Andean Group, and the Amazon Initiative, plus Chile. This way, 
a free trade zone will be established in South America before 
the year 2005. These initiatives, to which our main regional 
partners have reacted positively, encompass realistic 
alternatives to improve the competitiveness of our industries in 
a way that will not contradict the goal of implementing a 
zero-customs tax system internationally. This does not preclude 
the possibility of uniting, at the right moment, all other South 
American integration processes. 
  It is especially important for Brazil, with its diversified 
trade profile, to strengthen the multilateral trade system in 
open and flexible patterns. The conclusion of the Uruguay Round 
of the GATT, the final act on which will be signed in a few 
weeks, has opened to Brazil auspicious prospects, although some 
results, not specially satisfactory, have been registered in 
certain areas. These prospects are particularly auspicious 
because the decisions made in relation to regulations -- such as 
safeguards, the solution of controversial matters, and 
antidumping [preceding word in English] measures -- will 
noticeably reduce the chances of establishing protectionist and 
unilateral measures. 
  In the multilateral plan, we will continue to energetically 
defend the need to reform the UN Charter and increase the number 
of permanent seats at its Security Council, on which Brazil is 
again occupying a non-permanent seat, to grant it more 
representativity and legitimacy without harming its efficiency. 
Thus the imbalance between developing and developed countries 
that currently exists in the United Nations will be reduced. In 
view of its size and influence in the regional and international 
scenarios, Brazil has often been considered a natural candidate 
for an additional seat on the Security Council. Brazil has 
actively participated in debates and discussions about this 
issue within the specific framework of the United Nations, as 
well as in bilateral political contacts with our main partners. 
  The foreign policy implemented by Itamar Franco's 
administration obviously cannot overlook our relations with 
developed countries. It is of extreme importance to intensify 
and diversify our relations with these countries -- the United 
States, the European Union, and Japan -- because they represent 
invaluable sources of investment and technological know-how, as 
well as impressive markets for our products. The key word in 
this context is negotiation. For a country such as ours, the 
possibility of signing "compulsory support contracts [contratos 
de adesao]" is "initially" excluded. The progress made in our 
relations with the United States (over intellectual property) 
and with Germany (nuclear area) illustrates the determination 
with which this priority is being pursued. 
  In addition to confirming the importance of our relations 
with Portugal, the initiative to institutionalize the Community 
of Portuguese Speaking Countries is a natural result of the 
priority we have always given to relations with the African 
Continent. Based on this and the geographic link -- the South 
Atlantic -- which connects us to Portuguese-speaking African 
countries, Brazilian diplomacy plans to dedicate special 
attention to the other countries in southern Africa, where a 
large part of the continent's economic, trade, and financial 
resources are concentrated. 
  Now that opportunities have been opened by this series of 
profound changes, we must be attentive and actively participate 
in everything relevant to the formulation of a new international 
order. Brazil certainly has a role to play in the construction 
of this new order, through the defense of an effective 
democratization of international relations, the prevalence of 
multilateralism in the political and economic spheres, the 
legitimate right of the developing countries to have access to 
the so-called "sensitive" high technology as long as it is used 
for peaceful objectives, and the inclusion of the right to 
development among the priority topics of the international 
agenda. We must not limit ourselves to adopting attitudes that 
are merely a reaction to agendas drafted abroad, but to be in a 
position to define our own foreign affairs agenda.

<F P=106> [Article by Jose Casado] </F>
  [Text] Brazil has changed the course of its foreign policy: 
It will begin expanding its actions in South America for the 
purpose of increasing its economic base in the region and 
overcoming the phase of excessive concentration of diplomatic 
operations in Southern Cone countries (Argentina, Paraguay, and 
Uruguay). 
  In 90 days, the Brazilian Government expects to begin 
simultaneous negotiations over bilateral free trade agreements 
with eight South American countries. The goal is to consolidate, 
as of 1995 and over a 10-year period, a regional market in which 
80 percent of trade will be made with zero tariffs. 
  Negotiations have a very broad scope and, for this reason, 
the Brazilian Foreign Ministry has decided to set no rigid 
limits on the talks with the other South American governments, a 
Foreign Ministry spokesman said. 
  The decision already has been made. As has happened in 
Brazilian foreign policy over the past few decades, the decision 
seeks to extend beyond the terms of the Franco administration, 
which designed it. Itamaraty already has included this decision 
in the "permanent principles" that are always mentioned by 
Foreign Minister Celso Amorim. 
  From a strategic viewpoint, it means that South America's 
biggest nation now will engage in broad negotiations to 
integrate the Amazonas (to the north) and the River Plate (to 
the south) basins. 
  The objective is to create a regional free market that will 
be, nonetheless, open to promoting relations with the emerging 
political-economic blocs in North America, Europe, and Asia. 
  The representatives of the South American governments 
involved in those negotiations regard this Brazilian diplomatic 
initiative as a legitimate effort to recover the political 
influence the country had in the region until the early 1980's. 
  Furthermore, it is also regarded as sort of a countermeasure 
for the action the United States began undertaking in South 
America after Mexico joined NAFTA. 
  The U.S. action seeks to reach, in the medium term, the 
largest possible number of bilateral free trade agreements in 
Latin America. This obviously interferes with the interests of 
Brazil, the region's main exporter and largest market. 
  The two other major emerging Latin American markets are 
confronting political and socioeconomic problems that cast 
doubts on the future expansion of their economies: The Mexican 
risk increased after the Chiapas revolt, while Argentina is 
facing social upheavals in specific areas and increasing 
commercial deficits. 
  This situation, which is dominated by the U.S. need to 
expand 
its business base in the Southern Hemisphere to assure its 
future world leadership, might be leading Washington to adopt a 
new political position toward Brazil. 
  The appearance of irritation in the economic competition 
with 
Europe and Japan already had led the United States to modify the 
foundations of its foreign policy, Brazilian diplomats said. 
Now, since Mexico joined NAFTA, Washington has decided to 
emphasize its actions in South America. 
  The Clinton administration began to use diplomacy as a lever 
to open markets for U.S. exporters. Until a short time ago, the 
U.S. State Department would only preach free trade, allowing 
exporters to operate naturally and independently. 
  "During the Cold War, the U.S. Government did not need to 
engage very directly in the battle for the opening of markets in 
support of U.S. products because this was done indirectly and 
domestically through subsidies to local industries, 
technological projects, and the national defense budget. But the 
international arena has changed," a Brazilian ambassador and top 
Itamaraty member said. 
  He added: "Now they are engaged in a real diplomacy of 
commerce, of business. It is something similar to what Japan and 
Europe are doing, though with different intensity." 
  Based on such prospects, the Brazilian Government decided to 
intensify its efforts around its plan for the creation of what 
the diplomatic bureaucracy has called the South American Free 
Trade Zone. 
  In addition to a relative competition with the United States 
for political influence in the region, there might be very 
specific economic reasons that justify this Brazilian endeavor. 
  One of those reasons is that Brazil's participation in the 
commercial flow within Mercosur [Common Market of the South] has 
almost reached a saturation level: Brazil already supplies 25 
percent of the total imports bought by Argentina, Paraguay, and 
Uruguay. 
  Brazil's current participation in the trade operations of 
the 
rest of South America (that is, outside the Southern Cone) is 
five times smaller. This group of countries is spending $36 
billion annually in imports bought from the rest of the world. 
  In the eyes of the Brazilian Government, this is a very 
promising market for Brazilian products. It has enough 
possibilities for making current Brazilian commercial operations 
grow at least four times as much. 
  In other words, it has the potential for becoming something 
as important as Mercosur is now for the Brazilian economy after 
a decade of negotiations. That is, the creation of a free trade 
zone in South America has become a priority for Brazilian 
foreign policy.

    [Editorial Report] Santiago Radio Cooperativa in Spanish at 
1100 GMT on 13 April reports during its regular newscast that 
Planning Minister Luis Maira Aguirre announced the creation of 
the Social Inter-Ministerial Commission, Comision Social 
Inter-Ministerial, that will be headed by President Eduardo Frei 
and coordinated by Maira. The health, education, housing, 
labor, justice, finance, and agriculture ministers and the 
Women's Service director also will be members of the commission 
that will be in charge of maximizing the government effort to 
fight poverty. The commission will focus its attention on 
specific regional programs such as those related to 
mini-enterprises, indigenous communities, infants, handicapped 
people, and specific government programs that must be reviewed. 
Maira said the initiative will not entail new taxes but rather 
a rationalization of the public effort and better distribution 
of expenditures.

<F P=106> [News conference by President Carlos Roberto Reina with </F>
unidentified reporters at the Presidential Palace in Tegucigalpa 
-- live] 
  [Text] [Reina] Distinguished guests: The media have 
produced in the past few days a number of reports on various 
aspects of national life. Far from considering such reports as 
negative expressions, I consider them to be positive, because 
the people have high expectations and want to see the 
implementation of a number of actions that are in line with our 
proposal for a new style of government and a moral revolution 
for everyone. 
  People know that this new course of action will soon be 
established and want to participate. We have encouraged this 
process through the establishment of a great national consensus 
on which we are working intensively. A government that 
establishes a new style also generates a new style of response. 
No longer is there in Honduras a government that subjugates and 
paralyzes the people. It is now trying to establish power... 
[pauses] the role of co-protagonist in [words indistinct]. This 
is essential (?under the circumstances). 
  We anticipated this in our messages of 27 January and 7 
March. In them were clearly established the [word indistinct]. 
My next lengthy speech will be on 8 May, although on that day I 
must travel to Costa Rica for the new president's inauguration. 
That speech could be delivered a day early or a day late. In 
that speech, marking 100 days in office, we will advance in our 
efforts to keep our people informed. 
  We maintain an impartial position as we try to fulfill state 
duties. The people gave us a very clear mandate: to attack the 
problem of corruption in all its forms. This government is 
committed to establishing the bases for tackling this major 
problem. It is neither easy nor feasible in only 60 days to 
change situations that have been present on national territory 
or in the mentality of many of its protagonists. 
  Among such reports there was news of a plot against the 
president of the Republic. This was analyzed in various forms, 
but the truth is that the people have detected that persons 
involved in very deplorable activities have tried to carry out 
this kind of attack on Honduran democracy. 
  And lately, there was the news of a coup d'etat. I 
understand that those charges are based on reports from human 
rights organizations that wish to prevent in Honduras acts that 
are so negative and so outrageous, not only to the nation's 
dignity but also to constitutional rule and to the strength of 
democratic institutions. 
  I am ready for your questions. I wish to reaffirm my 
intention to maintain the best of relations with the media. I 
will do whatever it takes to contribute to this with utmost 
frankness and to promote greater rapprochement. I want the 
common man in Honduras to benefit from correct information and 
information that is not distorted in order to ensure that the 
people are well informed. This is a requirement for all free 
men. 
  [Reina] I want to take this opportunity to thank General 
Luis Alonso Discua Elvir for his statements, which I think are 
very timely and very correct. We must analyze their 
extraordinarily positive nature, because they reaffirmed support 
for civilian power and for the great strength of democratic 
institutions. I believe the Armed Forces will play a new role 
as an institution within democracy to contribute in order to the 
country's development, to fight corruption, and to improve the 
general situation of our compatriots. This new role reflects a 
new mentality, which is totally contrary to the ideas of making 
attempts against the people's sovereignty by threatening state 
institutions. I am now ready to answer your questions. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] criticisms against government. 
First there were reports of a plot and now of a coup d'etat. As 
president of the Republic do you think there could be a coup 
d'etat in Honduras? Also, what is the situation with regard to 
the plot, since the suspect was released? 
  [Reina] I look at both situations in a positive way. With 
regard to the plot, we will have to publish a white paper so 
that the people can have all the [two-minute break in reception] 
the Armed Forces. We are now getting used to this new style. 
These rumors alert the people, so they can defend their 
institutions and prevent any intention that could exist in the 
minds of anyone, meaning anyone who is against the moral 
revolution. After 8 May, when we will have names and specific 
cases, you will see those reactions intensify. They will try to 
seek things. What for example? Many Liberal Party members are 
impatient because their hopes of getting a job with the 
government -- which were fully justified -- have not been 
fulfilled. If 1 million Liberals vote for the Liberal Party, 
not all of them can get a job with the government. Good 
citizens understand this, are patient, and above all, they want 
this to be a good government in order to have the opportunity to 
stay in power. In that sense, all good Liberals know of our 
desire and intention to satisfy their needs. 
  [Reporter] [question indistinct] 
  [Reina] The IDB [Inter-American Development Bank] is an 
economic organization. It analyzes the country, and, however, 
the country is run by the Executive Branch. All they do is give 
ideas as to what they believe could or should be done. I am not 
going to go into a detailed discussion of the Armed Forces 
economic activities. We have referred to that before. However, 
it is not the IDB which leads this country. It is the Executive 
Branch and the other branches of the state, within the realm of 
their duties, which run the country and it is with them that we 
should discuss all the details of this situation. 
  When they hear the news, those who oppose the government 
want 
to interpret it negatively. We have had to take specific 
actions. There was talk that no actions were taken. We did so 
in order not to affect the large majority as was been done in 
the past. Instead, we sought solutions to that bad tradition 
which many do not want mentioned. 
  However, after two months [in office], we do have to talk 
about the way we received the country. It is our obligation. 
It is not an excuse, it is a reality and measures have been 
taken. But I do not accept the charges that when there were 
invasions it meant that there was anarchy. Actions were taken 
to dislodge the land invaders, and then there is talk about 
brutality in the methods used. This is a true picture of ill 
faith. This is not correct because we are acting very 
correctly. Some of the values of this government have not yet 
been perceived by the majority. One of them is the honesty with 
which we handle the government. It will yield its fruits, but 
it is a matter of having patience to consolidate the great 
values of democracy. 
  [Reporter] Recently there has been much criticism of your 
government. Labor, peasant, and private sectors [words 
indistinct] of your own party, what do you think is the reason 
for this criticism? Do you think that your government has lost 
popularity or credibility? 
  [Reina] Popularity is a value I appreciate, but if your 
president is going to act based on keeping or losing his 
popularity, then he could make big mistakes. 
  Criticism comes from sectors that do not want this 
government 
to move ahead with its theory of a moral revolution. When the 
presidential designate said that some of the measures could 
cause disappointment, that was interpreted as if the government 
lost its credibility. But that is not true. As long as the 
people trust that the moral revolution is on and that it will 
give the people all their rights, the people's trust will 
constitute the government's main source of support. There will 
always be criticism. Some will be right. However, what we do 
not want is for misinterpretation of facts to prevail. For 
example, the story that someone can tell, from such a long 
distance, that the United Nations wants a coup d'etat in 
Honduras.... [pauses] this is where I call for your 
understanding and help. How can it be that a human rights 
organization, an organization to defend man, could perceive that 
the government is threatened? The organization reported it. 
That is a defense. Just as Costa Rica's solidarity is a 
defense, Costa Rica has proven its solidarity in a thousand ways 
and so has President Gaviria. He expressed his solidarity as 
the new OAS secretary general. I also received a very 
flattering note from U.S. President Bill Clinton. These are 
facts that show that Honduras' image is an excellent one in the 
eyes of all democrats on this continent and the world. 
  [Reporter] When we talk with the people, including the 
leaders of the Liberal Party, everyone agrees that the 
population is dissatisfied. The vice president of congress told 
us just yesterday that you should fulfill your campaign 
promises, because there is enormous doubt among the people, 
which could polarize the country. That could end up who knows 
where. I would like you to expand on this a little, because the 
voice of the people is saying that your campaign promises are 
not being fulfilled and there is discontent. 
  [Reina] I am glad you asked me that. I am going to fulfill 
all of my campaign promises. I am not going to miss any of 
them. If, by the end of my four years, I have to say that I was 
unable to accomplish something I had promised, I will do so 
honestly. But what were my campaign promises? We must 
constantly remind everyone. My main promise was to promote a 
moral revolution in Honduras. It would not be true to say I 
have failed to meet that one. I promised to select the best 
Hondurans to lead the Executive Branch. I fulfilled it. I 
promised to restore justice in Honduras. The Supreme Court of 
Justice is a guarantee for juridical security. I cannot change 
these promises, and I am going to keep them. 
  I have not said that the media in general misinterpret the 
facts. I have said that sometimes, under certain circumstances, 
the media have published an interpretation of the facts that 
differs from my analysis. An example is the UN issue, and 
another example is the plot to assassinate me. This is not the 
first time, either. Once, during the campaign, the media said I 
had passed away, and when I reappeared they said I invented the 
report myself. The same is happening now with this thing about 
a plot. It is all an effort to hurt me or harm me, because 
everything is subject to interpretation. I am not the kind that 
hides cards up his sleeve or contradicts himself. I stand by my 
principles. I have not failed to fulfill any of my promises. I 
hardly made any promises. 
  What did I promise to do? I promised to throw all the 
thieves in jail. How can anyone expect all of the thieves to be 
shaven and groomed and in jail after just two months? I 
promised to carry out a moral revolution; not hold discretionary 
funds; be thorough in overseeing the people's money. 
  If you speak to any member of the PLH [Liberal Party of 
Honduras] who has not managed to fulfill his legitimate 
aspirations, he is not going to be very happy. He will say that 
he struggled for so long and is still living poorly. That is 
perfectly understandable, but that does not make that PLH member 
an enemy of the government. He is a citizen who has the 
absolute right to demand understanding and claim his share of 
well-being from the government. This is not a loss of 
credibility. It is impatience to see the government's 
objectives fulfilled. 
  I will be in continuous contact with the media. I have the 
greatest appreciation for all of you. Our state of 
underdevelopment leads us into somewhat uncomfortable 
situations. When I arrived at the Copn Sula Hotel [as received] 
in San Pedro Sula the other day, I encountered 50 reporters all 
hurrying to get the scoop -- which was very logical -- and they 
almost smothered a woman who was just there to deliver an 
envelope. She is a very respectable lady, and she almost 
collapsed. Situations such as this are sometimes 
misinterpreted. I would ask you not to promote such 
misinterpretations, but to try and achieve an open and frank 
flow of communication. I am an honest and open man, and I have 
nothing to hide from the media or from anyone. I hereby submit 
each event of my public and my private life to tour 
consideration. I have not contradicted myself on this matter 
either. I have not failed to keep any of my promises. I have 
not yet had enough time or space to fulfill everything I 
promised. These are all a matter of principles: to promote a 
moral revolution; to fight corruption; to tell the truth; and to 
guard the public funds. These promises, you can believe me, I 
have kept. 
  [Unidentified speaker] Lourdes Janet Bonilla. 
  [Bonilla] [Words indistinct] government institutions and 
this 
hinders the country's socioeconomic development. He has said 
that medium- and long-term measures will have to be adopted 
immediately to prevent an imbalance in the country's economy. 
What can you tell us about that? 
  [Reina] There are some tremendous contradictions. They are 
demanding measures that could damage the economy of a people who 
are facing a very difficult situation. I made a promise to 
defend the poor in Honduras, and they are the majority, and I am 
doing all that I can to keep that promise. The organizations at 
times can be very cold, but I have to admit they can help us. 
This will be proven when we show that the public funds are 
being handled properly. The organizations become upset when 
they see that the aid they are providing does not reach those it 
was intended to help. I believe that even the charges made in 
New York will work for the good of the government. No one makes 
charges for something to happen; they make charges to ensure 
that things do not happen. 
  Honduras has a new image. Everyone knows, and everyone has 
admitted, that Honduras' image suffered during the Cold War. 
Today, Honduras' image has regained prestige. It has a 
legitimate government and authorities who want to work for the 
good of the people. 
  [Unidentified speaker] According to the press secretary of 
the Office of the President this will be the last question. Let 
us hear what the president has to say. Basically, he is 
analyzing his government and the international image his 
government been able to project. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] Merchant Marines to the 
military, that Hondutel [Honduran Telecommunications Enterprise] 
be privatized, and that the draft be abolished. Do you believe 
that this would hinder the relations between the government and 
the Armed Forces? What do you think your government should do 
in light of the verbal confrontations between the Honduran 
private sector and the Armed Forces? 
  [Reina] The steps you have mentioned are logical steps and 
there is no reason why they should create problems between the 
military and the civilians. The talks in Brussels will be open 
talks. The highest scientific, technical, and ethical 
international authorities will attend the talks. There will be 
nothing hidden. We are going to accept the ruling. 
  Now, regarding the other two issues, the Merchant Marine and 
the draft: the Executive Branch has drafted a bill on the 
military draft and it is going to be submitted to the 
Legislative Branch. We have taken our time on this to ensure 
that the draft bill has been done properly. We do not have to 
improvise because improvisation only leads to problems. The 
draft bill will be submitted to the National Congress sometime 
next week. The Merchant Marine issue is being studied, and I am 
pleased to tell you that the Armed Forces has not defied me on 
this. 
  Regarding the confrontation between private enterprise and 
the Armed Forces, it is all a matter of the new times in which 
we are living. We are undergoing a period of economic changes. 
We have seen that the institutions that (?protect) their 
employees social security rights and retirement have money, and 
we must put that money to good use. This creates competition 
for the private sector. However, a balance must be kept. As 
long as the Armed Forces refrain from using their military power 
for economic pressure, I believe they are in their right to do 
what they think is correct. What would be serious would be for 
the Armed Forces to abuse their power to compete. That is the 
balance my government has established, and the soldiers I have 
talked to agree fully with me. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct]. 
  [Reina] What everyone has is the goodwill to help our people 
overcome their problems. 
  [Unidentified speaker] This is Voz de Honduras broadcasting 
from the Presidential Palace. We are bringing to you a news 
conference by Honduran President Carlos Roberto Reina. Another 
question is being asked about internal politics. The Honduran 
president met with Liberal Party deputies who strongly 
criticized the government and government operations. 
  [Reporter] How do you react to this? [Words indistinct] 
  [Reina] I will tell you frankly. I do not think I will go 
there at this time. I have talked with them, and the ministers 
have been instructed to listen to them and tend to them as best 
as possible. Should any such request be made, I would discuss 
it with them because the ministers are willing to cooperate. 
What they cannot do, however, is give jobs to all active 
members recommended by all the deputies, mayors, and leaders. I 
think the education minister is excellent; she is doing a very 
good job in a tremendously difficult ministry. If the minister 
does not have a good team to control the various agencies, the 
ministry can get out of hand. This is why I hereby reaffirm my 
support for her. This I have already done, both orally and in 
writing, so everyone knows that the president of the Republic 
backs up his ministers. 
  [Announcer] This is the news conference held by Honduran 
President Carlos Roberto Reina at the Presidential Palace press 
room. He is now leaving for sports activities. 
  [Reporter] The Honduran president discussed his campaign 
pledges. One was missing. He did not mention military service 
as one of the pledges that will be fulfilled, Mr. President. 
  [Reina] I have said I will present the bill to the National 
Congress next week. The implementation depends on congressional 
approval. I have no authority to approve it, but I can defend 
it in Congress.

  [Text] When asked about the remarks made by Julio Cesar 
Vasconcellos, who stressed that it would be an insult to the 
independence of the branches of government if there was a call 
for the impeachment of Supreme Court members, and that it could 
cause anarchy in the country that would fully justify closing 
Congress, President Juan Carlos Wasmosy said: "I will do 
everything in my power to maintain this democratic process. I 
believe that even with all the mistakes and imperfections, we 
are advancing and that all of us have to mature, but I will 
never implement a measure that will cause a backward step in 
this democratic process. I am following this very closely." 
  The possibility of closing Congress was rejected by Wasmosy, 
who indicated that he would not accept any type of pressure, 
even if it existed, to close Congress. 
  Asked what "everything in my power" meant, the chief of 
state 
indicated that he was referring to his absolute desire to make 
the democratic process work. "In other words, I am going to 
give this democratic process everything that I can to 
consolidate it, and I do not believe the democratic process will 
be consolidated by closing Congress. That is what I meant," he 
stressed. Asked whether that desire had limits, he said: "There 
are no limits." 
  Army Commander Division General Lino Cesar Oviedo indicated 
that there are no signs in our country of the possibility of a 
self-coup through the closing of Congress, and he also rejected 
that he would support any type of attempt to violate the 
Constitution. 
  "In principle I see no signs of a self-coup. This is all I 
can say," the military chief said. 
  He added that the military chiefs will obey the decisions of 
Juan Carlos Wasmosy, commander in chief of the Armed Forces and 
president of the nation, as long as he rules his government on 
the basis of the Constitution. 
  "I am going to cooperate with President Wasmosy on the basis 
of his oath to respect the Constitution and have it respected. 
In this way I will cooperate because I risked my life for 
democracy," he stressed when he insisted that he will not 
support any type of coup d'etat that violates the Constitution. 
  Oviedo also indicated that the project to reduce and 
modernize the military structure remains firm. "Within the Army 
there are six fewer generals, and the Paraguayan Armed Forces' 
budget is located in third place of the lowest budgets in the 
world," he said. 
  Oviedo stated that the operational costs of our country's 
Armed Forces are the lowest in the world in relation to the 
number of its inhabitants. 
  He explained that the clearest indication that there has 
been 
a reduction in the Armed Forces is the fact that its budget was 
cut 27 percent compared with last year's budget.

<F P=106> [Report by Enrique Lemus, from the "YSU Radio News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The National Association of Private Enterprise, 
ANEP, is sponsoring a series of activities to establish 
conditions for participating in international free trade 
agreements. ANEP General Manager Juan Hector Vidal has said 
that the necessary efforts are being made to begin free trade 
with Mexico. Negotiations between Costa Rica and Mexico have 
been concluded, and, according to Mr. Vidal, the same trade 
relationship will prevail between Honduras, Guatemala, and El 
Salvador -- countries which comprise the northern Central 
American triangle. 
  [Begin recording] [Vidal] Individual negotiations are 
provided for in the general agreement protocol signed last year 
in Guatemala. We know Costa Rica and Mexico signed last week, 
and we are now trying to sponsor a northern triangle, in 
conjunction with Nicaragua, to speed things up and achieve the 
same conditions that Costa Rica now has with Mexico. Otherwise, 
if we do not achieve the same conditions, preferential treatment 
for Central American imports and exports could be lost. 
Moreover, we risk a diversion of trade and investments to 
Mexico given the advantages offered by the treaty with Costa 
Rica. 
  [Lemus] What will happen to the CA-4 Group [Central American 
Four]? 
  [Vidal] Well, a political decision has been made to expedite 
the negotiations. You may remember that a large Mexican 
delegation of private entrepreneurs and government officials met 
with their counterparts from the northern triangle countries -- 
meaning Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador -- four weeks ago. 
That was a visit... [pauses] I wouldn't characterize that as an 
exploratory visit; it was a visit to establish the rules under 
which Mexico would be willing to negotiate. 
  We now need to define the conditions under which we are 
going 
to negotiate. A trade and investment agreement is not reached 
on the basis of impositions but through negotiations. 
Accordingly, we are trying to inaugurate, under the auspices of 
the ANEP, a seminar on rules of origin that are essential to 
these kinds of negotiations, because this is how rules are 
established for national products that are being traded. [end 
recording] 
  Mr. Omar Rodriguez, a member of the ANEP, said that in El 
Salvador's case, ANEP held a seminar on Monday to explain the 
rules of product origin as they apply to free trade agreements. 
  [Begin recording] [Rodriguez] The rules of origin seminar 
was organized by [words indistinct] and the ANEP to provide 
training -- for Salvadoran businessmen and government officials 
-- on rules of origin, which is basically the most important 
issue in free trade negotiations. 
  [Lemus] What are rules of origin? 
  [Rodriguez] Rules of origin define the nationally-produced 
components of each product prior to its exportation. In the 
case of products included in a free trade agreement, rules of 
origin define the country of origin's share in manufacturing the 
product that is being exported. This is important because it is 
meant to prevent three-way trade -- in other words, that 
finished products be taken from a given country to, let's say, 
Honduras so that Honduras can export it to Mexico as a Honduran 
product, when in fact it is a product manufactured in another 
country. This is what rules of origin try to prevent. 
  [Lemus] As for free trade agreement, it is known that Costa 
Rica has already signed something with Mexico. 
  [Rodriguez] Costa Rica already signed a free trade agreement 
with Mexico. This does not include other countries in Central 
America. The northern triangle countries -- Guatemala, El 
Salvador, and Honduras -- have organized joint negotiations with 
Mexico. They will try to come to some agreement as soon as 
possible, eventually establishing a relationship with the United 
States and possibly with Canada. [end recording] 
  Last week Costa Rica signed a free trade agreement with 
Mexico. Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador will do so jointly 
when these countries' authorities feel conditions are favorable.

  [Text] Guadalajara, 13 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- The free trade 
agreement that Mexico, Colombia, and Venezuela are negotiating 
is at a stalemate over Venezuela's disagreement with Mexico on 
the matter of asymmetry, rules of origin, and government 
purchases. 
  Venezuelan Finance Minister Julio Sosa Rodriguez said here 
in 
this western Mexican city that nevertheless, his country is 
fully confident the pact will be finalized in the next months. 
Interviewed within the framework of the 35th annual meeting of 
the Assembly of Governors of the Inter-American Development Bank 
(IDB), the Venezuelan official said that his country wants a 
total commercial opening. 
  He explained that the diversification of markets should be 
done in a just, equitable fashion so the three economies can 
reap equal benefits from the trade pact without any one country 
taking undue advantages. 
  "The southern part of the continent already has a common 
market. This accord with Mexico and Colombia is meant to 
establish a mechanism for opening with commercial exchanges that 
reflect guarantees as if we were a single country," he indicated. 
  Sosa says Mexico must recognize that Venezuelan products are 
at a disadvantage in the areas of basic industry and capital 
goods. 
  Sosa Rodriguez declined to comment on the obstacles that 
exist regarding the rules of origin and government purchases, 
although he said that no progress has been made on those topics 
because the negotiations have been delayed. 
  Sosa said that his country's oil will not be a subject for 
negotiation in the free trade pact since Mexico is not willing 
to do the same.

  [Text] Guadalajara, 11 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- Cesar Robalino 
Gonzaga, Ecuadoran minister of finance and credit, signed with 
the IDB here today a contract for $14.9 million for an 
ecological protection program. 
  IDB spokesman Carlos Brezina reported that the program is 
intended to reduce and control environmental damage in 
estuaries, mangrove swamps, and other natural resources along 
the Ecuadoran coast, as well as to strengthen the country's 
capacity to protect, handle, and rehabilitate coastal ecosystems. 
  Robalino said the program includes a subprogram to implement 
coastal resource development plans and to implement 120 projects 
for the administration of mangrove swamps and coastal areas, 
environmental cleanups, handling and conservation of marine 
resources, and community organization. 
  Brezina explained that the project's goal is to improve the 
economic opportunities of residents along the Ecuadoran coast 
and to increase revenues derived from ecotourism and aquaculture. 
  At the signing of the contract it was said the 2,860 km of 
Ecuadoran coastal line present [words indistinct] "conflictive" 
demands of tourism, the exploitation of shrimp and a [words 
indistinct], added that the project to be implemented by the 
Executive Directorate of the Program for Handling Ecuador's 
Coastal Resources will cost $16.5 million. Local funds for the 
project total $1.6 million. 
  The contract between the IDB and Ecuador was signed this 
Monday in Mexico's western city of Guadalajara within the 
framework of the 35th Annual Meeting of Governors of the 
institution. The meeting is scheduled to end on 13 April.

  [Text] Santo Domingo, 14 Apr (AFP) -- According to official 
reports, Dominican President Joaquin Balaguer today created a 
military commission to enforce, "throughout the national 
territory," the United Nations embargo on Haiti's military 
government. The commission consists of the minister of the 
Armed Forces and the chiefs of staff of the Army and the Navy. 
  The president's decree says the commission "is authorized to 
request logistical and technical support from the United Nations 
and its corresponding agencies to better fulfill the 
commission's mission." 
  However, this decision by Balaguer, who always opposed the 
embargo, seems to be a response to the demands of 48 U.S. 
Democratic congressmen for a more active role in checking the 
fuel contraband that "oxygenates" the Haitian military. 
According to the Dominican press, fuel is smuggled through the 
very same border checkpoints manned by the military. 
  A U.S. State Department official, during a visit less than a 
month ago, clearly advised Balaguer to check this operation. 
According to reports from Washington, the State Department 
expects Balaguer to ask the United Nations for observers to help 
Dominican troops watch the border to prevent the smuggling of 
gasoline, diesel, and other products sent to the Haitian 
military. Balaguer and his assistants oppose the embargo because 
they think it harms the Haitian people more than it harms the 
military who overthrew President Jean-Betrand Aristide. 
  It has been pointed out in official circles that, despite 
Washington's firm position, the transactions between Haitian 
businessmen and U.S. businessmen increased last year. 
  Analysts recall that Balaguer had hostile relations with 
Aristide when the latter was president and that Aristide accused 
Balaguer of permitting thousands of Haitian sugar cane cutters 
working at Dominican sugar mills to be treated as "slaves." 
Aristide even reported these lowly workers were denied the 
right to go to their villages, where they lived in barracks-like 
dwellings with no potable water, no electricity, and no social 
assistance. Aristide also reported that these workers worked 
more hours than allowed by Dominican law and that they worked 
for extremely low salaries. 
  Balaguer reacted to these charges by ordering the sugar cane 
cutters out of the country. The result was a "cooling" of 
relations with Port-au-Prince. When Aristide was deposed in 
September 1991, however, Santo Domingo accepted the Haitian 
ambassador and others as exiles. 
  Months ago, Balaguer and Aristide formalized their 
"rapprochement" when the ousted Haitian president visited Santo 
Domingo.

<F P=106> ["Text" of speech by Chamber of Deputies President Frantz </F>
Robert Monde on 13 April; place not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] Haitian sisters, Haitian brothers: Our country is 
undoubtedly experiencing the most difficult moment of its 
history. Today, as has happened several times since our 
independence, we find ourselves alone, undergoing a severe, 
pitiless, and murderous universal quarantine. We cannot help 
remembering that it was also like that during the first half 
century of the existence of a dearly won independence, because 
we are alone. We are duty-bound to gather the scattered pieces 
of a torn nation for which nothing has ever been easy and in 
which nobody has ever been spared. It is at such moments that 
the men and women of this nation have always found the sense of 
compromise, of realism, and of the proud vision characteristic 
of our will to live together. 
  Haitian sisters, Haitian brothers, I make a point of 
addressing every one of you today because it is really necessary 
that a legitimate authority of this nation do so. This kind of 
dialogue is essential, especially in these difficult moments and 
because the ultimate resort is you. As for us, we are only your 
representatives. It is you who elected us. We must give you 
explanations, not only at the end of our respective mandates, 
but also and especially at this very important watershed and in 
view of the particularly perilous choices vis-a-vis our 
continuing existence as a sovereign nation. I address you today 
as president of the Chamber of Deputies and vice president of 
the National Assembly. The National Assembly constitutes the 
legislative power and is the joint securer of the national 
sovereignty. 
  In view of the extended absences of a president of the 
Republic and a prime minister; in view of the endless division 
prevailing within the Senate, it is my duty to talk to you about 
the peril that today threatens our existence as a sovereign 
people. 
  This peril is all the greater because our days are numbered. 
Between now and 9 May, the parliament must close the seventh 
session of the 45th Legislature and ensure the opening on 13 May 
of its eighth and final session. We must meet these 
constitutional requirements. It would be irresponsible on our 
part to mortgage the existence of an institution which 
represents today one of the last ramparts of our fragile and 
imperfect democracy. 
  This peril is all the greater because the Dominican 
presidential elections scheduled for 15 May look tumultuous. It 
has become even more essential that Haitian society be governed. 
  This peril is all the greater because new elections aimed at 
renewing one-third of the Senate and the totality of the 
deputies and communal elected representatives are due to be held 
within only seven months. 
  Haitian sisters, Haitian brothers, since the beginning of 
the 
existence of our nation, we have experienced long periods of 
misgovernment; but for the first time, we have found ourselves 
-- since the resignation of Prime Minister Robert Malval, which 
has been accepted by the president of the Republic -- facing a 
complete absence of the executive. A resigning government can be 
in charge of dealing with day-to-day business, insofar as a date 
is set for its replacement. How can it deal indefinitely with 
day-to-day business when the higher authority from whom it comes 
does not seem to be overly affected by the incongruity of this 
situation? 
  Governing does not consist of dealing with day-to-day 
business. Governing is, first and foremost and especially, 
foreseeing, preparing, and facing the great collective 
rendezvous provided for by our laws and customs and especially 
by our fundamental law, the Constitution. It is not just a 
matter of the legitimate authorities' organizing great masses to 
celebrate the anniversaries of our Constitution. The sole 
responsible attitude consists first of doing what the 
Constitution orders done at the proper time and place. 
  For exactly five months, our country has had no government. 
The division that can be observed within the Senate, the Supreme 
Audit Court, and the administrative litigation cannot leave any 
citizen indifferent. One might say that they are autonomous 
entities that must be able to conduct themselves as grown-ups. 
But life also teaches us that no entity, no organization is safe 
from open conflict. It is therefore important that a supreme 
authority be concerned about using all powers of persuasion 
available to achieve an inevitable compromise. 
  This moral and legitimate supreme authority exists. It is 
the 
president of the Republic. He has the duty to be concerned with 
the smooth running of all the institutions and to intervene in a 
noncoercive way. Should the nonfunctioning of all these 
fundamental institutions not interfere with the sleep of a 
responsible president of the Republic? Should the absence of a 
prime minister and of a government not interfere with the sleep 
of of the president of the Republic? The president of the 
Republic has attached a number of conditions to the choice of a 
prime minister. Even our mother law does not set any particular 
conditions. The only stipulation to the spirit and the letter 
of the Constitution is that following acceptance of the prime 
minister's resignation, the president of the Republic, in 
consultation with the presidents of the two chambers, must fill 
the governmental vacuum. It is in this spirit that the 
parliamentary plan, inspired from the international conference 
in Miami convened by President Aristide, was developed and 
presented to the president of the Republic. 
  As president of the Chamber of Deputies and vice president 
of 
the National Assembly, I am assuming my right to observe that 
President Aristide obstinately refuses to fill this 
institutional vacuum. This vacuum does not prevent him from 
sleeping or from traveling around the world. On the other hand, 
it is comforting to find that some political formations, some 
socioprofessional organizations, groups of citizens from all 
social categories are becoming alarmed by the persistence of 
this dangerous vacuum. I am therefore taking this opportunity to 
pay tribute to all those who, in the face of this established 
fact, concerted themselves democratically to address their 
resolution or their petition to the legislative power. Our 
country needs and will increasingly need those conscious 
patriots who are closely following the evolution of public 
affairs. However, a large vision of this crisis commands us to 
clearly and firmly express our disagreement with some ways and 
means of filling this vacuum. We said it and are repeating it 
today: Our country committed itself, with the adoption of the 
1987 Constitution, to building a state of law and institutional 
democracy. The permanence of the organs provided by this 
Constitution concerns all of us. 
  Just because President Jean-Bertrand Aristide persists in 
ignoring the spirit and letter of this Constitution does not 
mean that we should follow him and do the same. This is why we 
understand the meaning and impact of the latest resolution voted 
by an assembly of senators gathered at the initiative of the 
Honorable Senator Bernard Sansaricq. We can only have 
reservations about the crisis resolution option implied by this 
resolution [as heard]. This option sweeps away with the back of 
its hand the obvious, unavoidable fact that the political 
Haitian crisis arising from circumstances has been 
internationalized. We must accept the fact of this 
internationalization. Like everything, it has both good and bad 
sides. In the context of the globalization of events and 
interdependence of nations, our job and our duty as political 
officials consists of doing our best to maximize the good and 
minimize the bad. 
  As this political crisis has been internationalized, we have 
lost exclusive control and exclusive power to define the 
resolution options and make them effectual. We must also reckon 
with slowness, which is less the result of our crisis as such, 
than of the Department of the Interior data and policy of such 
and such a foreign concerned nation. Maximizing the good side 
means to be always ready to hold constructive dialogue with our 
foreign partners who bother to take honest steps to know our 
reality and our culture. To minimize the negative is to again 
refuse excessive interference and insincere gifts. 
  We have refused and will always refuse the crumbs of 
humanitarian aid that France has deigned to throw at us like one 
throws a bone to a dog. France wishes to maintain its prestige 
in international politics. We can certainly understand that. But 
why must France -- in the absence of a true policy toward our 
country and our international conflict -- use our children's 
hunger and our youths' distress as a pawn in international 
politics? It is even worse: By what perverse twist can one 
imagine that the people of Martinique are demanding French 
military occupation of our country? Do those people from 
Martinique have enough historic memory to remember the nobility 
of the address of General Dessalines [Haitian national hero who 
proclaimed Haiti's independence on 1 January 1804] to them in 
1084? 
  We refuse and we will always refuse to believe in the good 
faith of the leading light of the Black Caucus, who has found 
nothing to propose but military occupation of our country. The 
Haitian nation has a long history of exchange and solidarity 
with black Americans. All our governments -- from Toussaint 
Louverture [Haitian national hero who paved the way for 
Dessalines] to Dessalines, and from [Jean-Pierre] Boyer 
[president of Haiti from 1818 to 1843] to [Fabre Nicolas] 
Geffrard [president of Haiti from 1859 to 1867] -- did their 
best to bring constant support to the struggle for emancipation 
of black Americans. But our governments and politicians never 
tried to intervene in national U.S. political space. Our country 
has scrupulously respected the pace of emancipation of black 
Americans in their own national space. Why can they not be as 
reserved with our internal struggles? Perhaps because they have 
become rich while we have remained poor. Franz Fanon [a writer 
from Martinique, author of the book, "Peau Noire, Masque Blanc"] 
was right: Those people, unfortunately, are still black skins, 
but with white masks. 
  For that reason, it is necessary today to continue, with 
all our bona fide partners, to attempt to define as accurately 
as possible the outlines of a realistic plan for a solution to 
the political crisis arising from the present juncture, by 
applying the necessary wisdom and pragmatism. The Governors 
Island agreement constitutes a framework, a reference, and a 
mechanism aimed at achieving an inter-Haitian dialogue between 
Haiti and the international community. At the same time, within 
the framework of our national space, we must take into account 
the daily management of public affairs and the collective 
appointments provided by our law. 
  I am convinced that it is possible for us to define a 
consensual option for the safeguard of our republican 
institutions. I am convinced that no Haitian citizen living in 
Haiti can imagine that it is through further weakening of, if 
not eliminating altogether, the current institutions that a 
democratic and consensual solution to the peril threatening us 
will be found. 
  A democratic solution necessarily implies reinforcement of 
the state and of the institutions in charge of offering services 
to the population. It necessarily implies disengagement of the 
Haitian Armed Forces from their traditional tasks and methods. 
The persistence of the institutional vacuum can only worsen an 
atmosphere of insecurity and increase the already too great 
number of violations of the fundamental rights of citizens. 
  Haitian sisters, Haitian brothers, the slowness that 
characterizes the search for a solution to the political crisis 
arising from the present juncture is crippling our country and 
is wearing all of us out. It has become imperative for us that 
we work on filling the current governmental vacuum and that we 
ascertain the feasibility of the coming electoral deadlines. 
  The constraints inherent in the difficult period we are 
facing force us to refuse any unilateral approach. That is why, 
as the vice president of the National Assembly and president of 
the Chamber of Deputies, enjoying the support of the majority of 
deputies and strong with the bloc [not further identified] of 
the Senate, I intend, beginning this week, to start a series of 
consultations with all sectors of our collective life on two 
points: 
  First of all, how to fill the current vacuum in the 
executive 
power, taking into account the deadlock that the parliamentary 
plan is facing due to the stubborn refusal of President 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide to appoint a prime minister. 
  Second, how to solve the upcoming problem of the expiration 
of the mandates of the entire Chamber of Deputies, of a third of 
the Senate, and of all the communal elected representatives. 
  We will neglect nothing so all sectors of our society can 
be consulted. This means we will consult with the great bodies 
of the state as well as the employers' and union associations, 
the socioprofessional associations, the Episcopal Conference, 
the Protestants, and the various political formations. 
  I would like -- in concluding this address -- to tell you 
that I continue to believe that with the complexity and 
incredible entanglement of our political crisis, there is no 
royal path for anyone. I also remain convinced that reasonable 
compromise solutions can be identified and applied. One might as 
well say that we are duty bound to move toward the definition of 
a political pact for the preservation of the institutional bases 
of Haitian democracy. I want to take this opportunity to 
solemnly call on you, Haitian sisters and brothers in general, 
and all important and unavoidable actors in our crisis, in 
particular. My call goes out to President Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide. I ask him on your behalf to assume his 
responsibilities toward the Constitution that he swore to 
respect. My call goes out to Lieutenant General Raoul Cedras. I 
ask him to refuse to listen to the perverse songs of the sirens 
and to do what his duty and his word of honor as a soldier order 
him to do. 
  Haitian sisters, Haitian brothers: I tell you of my 
admiration. I tell you the Chamber of Deputies is going to do 
what its duty orders it to do for you and for the well-being of 
our nation. Thank you.

<F P=106> [From the "ACIR Radio News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Bishop Samuel Ruiz, from Cuautitlan, today talked 
about the peace negotiations in Chiapas. The bishop said that 
these negotiations are not bogged down. The bishop said that 
the conditions exist for continuing the pacification process in 
southeastern Mexico. In addition, he said that the rebel groups 
will not participate in Mexico's electoral process because they 
consider it an opportunity to achieve the transition to 
democracy. 
  During the first working day of the Mexican Episcopal 
Conference's 56th full assembly, the bishop of San Cristobal de 
las Casas in a news conference, together with Archbishop of 
Chihuahua Jose Fernandez Artiaga, and Bishop Luis Reynoso 
Cervantez of Cuernavaca, and [word indistinct] Altamirano Raul 
Vera Lopez, indicated that the Mexican Catholic Church agrees 
that peace, justice, and reconciliation in Mexico have priority. 
Many of the demands made in Chiapas have a national bearing, 
particularly in reference to Indian dignity and perfection of 
the democratic process in Mexico. 
  Samuel Ruiz said that Camacho Solis, as representative of 
the 
federal government, and the members of the EZLN [Zapatista 
National Liberation Army] are very willing to continue the peace 
dialogue. In this regard, there are broad hopes, Samuel Ruiz 
said, for peace with justice to be achieved in Chiapas. To 
conclude, he made reference to the dialogues that have been set 
up between cattle men and businessmen of Chiapas to do away with 
divisions; particularly dangerous bellicose attitudes that 
prevent social peace in that southeastern Mexican state. Here 
is Juan Carlos Antoyo reporting from San Cristobal de las Cases: 
  [Antoyo] Good afternoon, I would like to clarify that we are 
in Tuxctla Gutierrez. In our opinion, the bishop from San 
Cristobal does not seem to have knowledge of the last statements 
made with reference to this peace process by the EZLN, more 
specifically by Subcommander Marcos. Those reporters who have 
had access to the jungle, to the marking of the 75 anniversary 
of Emiliano Zapata's death, are under the impression, and Marcos 
assured, that currently, the necessary conditions do not exist 
for the dialogue to be resumed in Chiapas. They also said that 
while the EZLN remains on full alert it is not willing to carry 
out the internal consultation; therefore this is one more 
obstacle. One must recall that the EZLN had decided that to 
arrive at a decision on a second encounter, the internal 
consultation must take place first. This consultation has been 
suspended, this suspension has been in effect for approximately 
20 days. 
  Meanwhile I will tell you that the [word indistinct] Chiapas 
Governor Javier Lopez Moreno asked the National Commission on 
Human Rights [CNDH] to issue a recommendation on the 
investigations on the 21 persons under arrest. Twenty of these 
individuals who are at the [word indistinct] penitentiary have 
been on a hunger strike for 12 days. After visiting this 
penitentiary where these 20 persons, accused of belonging to and 
supporting the EZLN are incarcerated, the governor said that the 
recommendations made by the CNDH are very important for one who 
attempts to govern with social justice and to reestablish an 
agreement among the Chiapas residents. 
  In a letter addressed to CNDH President Jorge Madrazo 
Cuellar, Governor Lopez Moreno indicated there are no doubts 
that the judicial system and the Attorney General's Office in 
general have acted in good faith and in keeping with the law. 
In order to clear up or eliminate any doubt, the CNDH 
resolution is therefore important. 
  At the same time Marcos Arturo Lazar Villa, president of the 
Supreme Court of Justice of Chiapas, talked about the legal 
procedure that could be applied in the case of those 21 persons, 
among whom 20 are on a hunger strike. 
  [Begin recording] [Antoyo] What is the legal situation they 
are facing? What can be done so they can obtain their freedom 
at some time? 
  [Lazar] The defense attorney always tries to look for the 
alternatives for liberty. Currently, the alternatives 
prevailing are those that I have mentioned: the dropping of the 
charges, this corresponds to the Attorney General's Office. The 
amparo filed is another alternative; this is also being taken 
into consideration. There is also the possibility of [words 
indistinct] data. There are many possibilities available but 
everything depends on what the federal authorities will resolve. 
[end recording] 
  To conclude, we want to report something that drew a great 
deal of attention. Today, during an interview with Milton 
Morales Arroyo, president of the local Congress, he said that 
the municipal presidents are partially responsible for the 
situation in Chiapas as they have forgotten a basic principle in 
politics, that is to respond to the people's demands. They have 
devoted their time to constructing public works, and in many of 
these mishandling of public funds has been detected.

<F P=106> [Report by Emilio Lomas] </F>
  [Text] Cuernavaca, Mor. [Morelos], 10 Apr -- After 
vindicating the struggle of Emiliano Zapata, "which is still 
alive," President Carlos Salinas de Gortari warned there will 
not be setbacks in the constitutional reforms drawn up in favor 
of the Mexican countryside. Salinas also stressed that large 
landholdings will not reappear in the country, particularly at a 
time when farmers are facing an unfavorable international 
situation. 
  During the ceremony marking the 75th anniversary of the 
death 
of General Emiliano Zapata, which was held at the Teopanzolco 
Municipal Auditorium, the president emphasized that the ejido [a 
form of land tenure] is not going to disappear, adding that the 
laws have been adapted to the new times the country is 
experiencing. Salinas remarked that the struggle of the 
southern leader [Zapata] is still legitimate, and in Mexico we 
must reverse the circumstances of misery and poverty still 
prevailing in the countryside. 
  Accompanied by Morelos State Governor Antonio Riva Palacio 
Lopez, the secretaries of agriculture and agrarian reform, 
Carlos Hank Gonzalez and Victor Cervera Pacheco, respectively, 
Agrarian Ombudsman Arturo Warman, and the leaders of the largest 
peasants organizations of the country, President Salinas said 
significant progress has been made in the countryside, but the 
work is not over yet. 
  "We still have a lot to do, but we are not going to ease up; 
on the contrary, we are going to redouble our effort and 
increase benefits for peasants. From the government of the 
republic, we will work harder and with greater dedication and 
determination," Salinas underscored. He said he had come to 
this area to commemorate an anniversary of sadness and hope: 
"The 75th anniversary of the injust and unacceptable death of 
Emiliano Zapata and also 75 years of commitments and work in 
favor of Mexican peasants." 
  Salinas said many of the aspirations of Emiliano Zapata have 
come true and evidence of this is the exceptional agrarian 
reform. Nevertheless, he explained, Mexico has changed and new 
problems and opportunities appeared along with this change, so 
it was also necessary to promote changes in the law, 
institutions, and practices. 
  Salinas asserted these changes were proposed by the very 
peasants, "because the previous instruments were inadequate for 
the country we had." He mentioned his government has continued 
to support the banners of transformation in favor of peasants. 
The president added that is why greater legal assurance has 
been given to land ownership and freedom to decide and, above 
all, to reaffirm the patrimony of their children." 
  The president recalled the modifications to Article 27 of 
the 
Constitution and said to this end that intense talks were held 
with peasant organizations and the very men and women of the 
countryside. This, he said, allowed the ejido and communal 
property to become part of the Constitution, while it permitted 
ejidatarios [land holders] and communal property owners to 
decide on what fit their needs best. Salinas said the assembly, 
which is a democratic organ where ejidatarios and communal 
owners issue their views, was strengthened. This reaffirmed the 
ejido is not going to disappear, but on the contrary will be 
strengthened as a fundamental expression of social property in 
our fatherland, the president explained. 
  He then spoke about large landholdings and said that since 
that time it was banned from the Constitution; "large 
landholdings are not going to reappear; they have disappeared 
from the history of our fatherland." 
  Later Salinas recalled that in January of this year, 200,000 
land titles of Procede [expansion unknown] were delivered and 
200,000 more were delivered today here in Morelos, where now two 
out of every three ejidatarios own titles to their land. Also 
today the executive delivered new contributions to the 
countryside because he said his government has decided to 
definitely modify the way in which peasants are supported. 
Thus, during the Autumn-Winter cycle, Salinas asserted that 
approximately 700,000 peasants will receive in their hands a 
direct support check, such as the ones he presented today to 
Morelia peasants. 
  Salinas said that 3.5 million peasants will receive direct 
support for the Spring-Summer cycle, while "in the past 2 
million received nothing. Today, they will have this addition 
to their family income guaranteed. 
  He also recalled that in all this process to reactivate the 
Mexican countryside, the problem of overdue credits was resolved 
and accepting their word, more than 1 million peasants received 
support from the country. He added that we have also modified 
commercialization mechanisms and are now working on productive 
infrastructures, "but we have not finished yet. We will 
continue moving forward with firmness and determination." 
  He then noted that the international situation is not 
favorable for farmers and that Mexico must reverse the 
conditions of neglect and poverty that still prevail in many 
rural areas. He stressed that the government will not slow its 
pace and will redouble its efforts and will achieve more 
benefits for the Mexican countryside. He said that the 
government "will work harder, with more dedication and 
enthusiasm. We will not stop." 
  In his speech, Governor Riva Palacio said that today we 
remember the sacrifice of the hero of Anenecuilco, who struggled 
to give land to the Mexican peasants, "but for us his immolation 
means that he won a place in history and glory that the 
fatherland reserves for its children who give everything seeking 
justice for others." 
  Riva Palacio added that we are happy because this 
celebration 
takes place within the framework of the delivery of 15,831 
agrarian titles. He added that this makes a reality of the 
modernization of the Mexican Constitution, in order to align 
with the current world, based on programs derived from the Ayala 
Plan, which reflects the thoughts and ideals that inspired 
Zapata's struggle to achieve justice for peasants, reforms, 
liberty, justice, and law. He said that those thoghts and 
ideals are present in the adjustments that serve as a basis for 
the new agrarian reform. 
  He stressed that those ideals were also made a reality 
through Procampo with the delivery to rural producers of 3,000 
certificates of payment which, as direct encouragement, permit 
the competitiveness in a different market without affecting the 
income the Revolution gave them for working the land. 
  In that manner, Riva Palacio said, an act of agrarian 
justice 
has been made by granting titles and economic support that will 
enable Mexican peasants to receive justice and to project 
themselves into Mexico's future of democracy, and liberty.

<F P=106> [Report by Luz Arcelia Camarena M.] </F>
  [Text] Jaime Serra Puche, secretary of commerce and 
industrial development, said yesterday that Mexico emerged 
stronger from the Uruguay Round because it provides a firmer 
multilateral framework for Mexico's efforts to diversify trade 
with countries with which it has not negotiated free trade 
agreements. 
  Shortly before departing for Marrakech, Morocco, where the 
signing of the Final Document of the Uruguay Round of GATT is 
scheduled to take place, the secretary of commerce and 
industrial development said that "the agreements of the Uruguay 
Round will be crucial in promoting world trade of goods and 
services, as well as in facilitating the flow of capital and the 
transfer of technology." The GATT will reportedly go into effect 
on 1 January 1995. 
  Serra highlighted that "the creation of this new framework 
for world trade complements Mexico's free trade agreements with 
other countries." Additionally, Serra stressed that "the 
Uruguay Round will considerably improve expectations for a more 
favorable international arena, creating jobs and greater 
business opportunities for Mexican exporters." 
  The basic objective of Mexico's participation in the Uruguay 
Round, he said, was to obtain at the multilateral level stable 
and safe access for our exports to international markets, in 
reciprocity for the autonomous measures of trade liberalization 
adopted in the last few years. 
  According to the GATT Secretariat, world trade of 
merchandise 
will increase 12.4 percent between 1995 and 2005 as a result of 
the agreements reached at the round, generating an annual 
increase in the world's gross domestic product of $230 billion 
for the same period. 
  In this regard, the secretary of commerce and industrial 
development affirmed that Mexico has the potential to increase 
its participation in world trade because the country has a 
comparative advantage in some sectors where growth is predicted, 
particularly textiles, clothing, agriculture products, prepared 
foodstuffs, and beverages. 
  Serra remarked that "political stability and international 
security depend on the permanent generation of wealth through 
international trade and the equitable distribution of that 
wealth. The changes undertaken by most countries pose great 
challenges to the world society. The process of globalization 
requires a trade system that facilitates the exchange of goods 
and services to permit all countries to benefit from the 
scientific, technological, and cultural contributions that 
appear in the different areas of the world," Serra concluded.

  [Text] Tomas Borge, member of the Sandinist National 
Liberation Front [FSLN] Board of Directors, said the FSLN does 
not oppose the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility [ESAF]. 
It opposes the harsh terms contained therein. Borge said at a 
FSLN political activity held during the weekend that they do not 
oppose the foreign resources that the signing of the ESAF by the 
national government and the IMF would guarantee. Borge 
disclosed that the FSLN told the government and the ESAF experts 
during a meeting held last week to discuss the terms under which 
the financial institution would loan the government 
approximately $82 million, that those resources should be 
earmarked mostly for production and not for the payment of 
Nicaragua's foreign debt. 
  According to the Sandinist leader, they proposed to Violeta 
Chamorro's government as well as to the IMF that the freezing of 
the foreign debt should be urged. To avoid a social outbreak in 
the nation, they also proposed less harsh terms with regard to a 
massive dismissal of government workers, as well as other terms 
that will adversely affect the needy sectors. Nevertheless, the 
government paid no heed to the FSLN recommendations. 
  Tomas Borge said the nation must unite to face the 
international financial institutions and their impositions. The 
FSLN leader stated that only the nation's unity can save it from 
the disaster resulting from the measures that the IMF will 
impose through the so-called ESAF agreement. To approximately 
200 FSLN members this weekend, Borge made reference to the ESAF 
as follows: 
  [Begin Borge recording] We cannot go against the 
possibilities of foreign aid for this country. Therefore, we do 
not oppose the ESAF in general. What we oppose are [words 
indistinct], the conditions, the terms set out, and terms of the 
agreement. These matters deeply violate the nation's 
sovereignty. Currently, however, sovereignty is described in 
other terms - we cannot speak in the same terms as in the past. 
  The international financial institutions are now going to 
decide on Nicaragua's internal budget and tax policies. The 
high-ranking leaders of the private sector have decided this. I 
am very pleased that [words indistinct] government its fiscal 
policy. But if I were the government I would be ashamed if a 
condition is imposed on me. [Words indistinct] outright 
violates national interests. Many of the aspects agreed upon, 
in principle, violate the nation's Constitution and other laws. 
What is more, it is indicated that if any law of the Republic 
approved by the Legislative Assembly contradicts this agreement, 
such as [words indistinct], it will be vetoed by the Executive 
Branch. 
  We believe that the international organizations should, in 
effect, contribute to this country with foreign aid, as long as 
it does not harm the nation's sovereignty and dignity, and much 
less harm the workers' rights. The outlook for this country is 
greater poverty, growing unemployment, and generalized hunger. 
This is what it appears to mean. Now, what choice do we have? 
It think it would be wise to unite the whole nation, [words 
indistinct] if the government itself were united. [end recording]

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 13 Apr (NA) -- Former President Raul 
Alfonsin has said he does not consider the results of the 10 
April elections a "catastrophe," but rather a "special 
circumstance, as we knew beforehand that we would be sacrificed 
in this election." 
  Alfonsin said that those who are asking him to resign "are 
looking at things from the viewpoint of the electoral strategy," 
stressing that "we must have the greatness to think of political 
objectives that will benefit the nation and democracy as a 
whole." 
  Alfonsin said that the Radical Civic Union's (UCR) worst 
results occurred in those districts "where we had to face 
internal and general elections at the same time." Alfonsin 
commented particularly against the positions of Fernando de la 
Rua in the federal capital and Sergio Montiel in Entre Rios. 
  During an exclusive interview with NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS 
yesterday, the UCR president announced that he will submit a 
report on his activities to the party executive board at a 
national meeting on 6 May, adding that he will not remain at the 
head of the party "a single minute longer" if a majority of 
members reject his arguments. 
  The former president warned about preparations for "a 
campaign" to distort the constitutional reform program agreed 
upon in the Olivos Pact, adding that the campaign is probably 
supported by "the right." Alfonsin said that he "would deeply 
regret it" if Deputy Carlos "Chacho" Alvarez (Grand Front) 
joined the campaign against the pact. 
  The complete text of the interview follows: 
  [NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS] The UCR lost 1.8 million votes if we 
compare the results of this election with the results of the 
October 1993 election. This means a greater than 10 percent 
drop. The party ended in third place in the federal capital, 
Mendoza, and Buenos Aires Province, and in fourth place in 
suburban areas. Is this an electoral catastrophe? 
  [Alfonsin] We would have been forced to accept that it was a 
catastrophe if it had been a normal election. But this was not 
a typical election. Obviously our performance was very bad in 
the federal capital, Buenos Aires Province, and in some 
districts where the party had great problems. We had general 
elections and at the same time internal elections. The UCR 
never faced a similar situation before. 
  The election was not a typical one also because only 
institutional policies were at stake, and voters could punish 
governments without risking their stability. We paid a very 
high price for our efforts to consolidate the political peace, 
and consequently, democracy in Argentina. We not only had 
internal problems, but all other parties turned against us, 
seeking to win more votes. 
  What really hurt me was the attempt to find hidden 
intentions 
in a position that was disinterested and totally patriotic, an 
attempt to present our efforts as something dirty or tarnished 
with some hidden interest. 
  In any case, I think it is very good that no single party 
will have a majority on its own at the Constituent Assembly. We 
have more than 70 convention delegates, and that is an important 
force. 
  I do not see it as a catastrophe, but as a very special 
circumstance. We knew beforehand that we would be sacrificed in 
this election. 
  [NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS] You speak about internal elections. Do 
you think people inside the UCR worked for a UCR defeat? 
  [Alfonsin] Absolutely. A case in point is the federal 
capital, without a doubt. A similar thing happened in Entre 
Rios. In Buenos Aires Province there was more apathy. Some 
misguided statements were made before the elections. But the 
situation here is very different. 
  [NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS] A possible interpretation of the 
results is that there were many more votes against the Olivos 
Pact than expected. Why do you think this happened? 
  [Alfonsin] First of all, I think our society has 
cannibalistic instincts. I was constantly criticized because, 
according to some people, I was "a questioning machine." These 
people said I made a staunch opposition. When I talked with the 
government, the same people who criticize me for my opposition 
criticize me furiously for doing just the opposite. 
  But it is a fact that many of the arguments against the 
agreement originated in the UCR, and were discussed during our 
internal election. May I remind you that surveys conducted in 
December indicated that the pact had the support of 80 percent 
of the population. 
  [NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS] Federico Storani and Juan Manuel 
Casella have said that had they been responsible for the UCR 
electoral strategy, they would have resigned. 
  [Alfonsin] The fact that they see the pact as an electoral 
strategy is their problem. We have seen in it a higher 
political objective for Argentine democracy. You need greatness 
to see things from this viewpoint. 
  [NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS] All those people who tried to prevent 
your return to the party presidency are now demanding a 
reorganization, resignations, and early internal elections. 
What will you do about it? 
  [Alfonsin] I will present a report to the National Committee 
for later consideration by the party plenum. Obviously, if the 
report is not accepted I could not remain in the presidency a 
single minute longer. 
  [NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS] You mean you will accept criticism if 
it comes from the party organization, but not if it comes from 
the press. 
  [Alfonsin] Exactly. 
  [NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS] What arguments will you use in your 
report? 
  [Alfonsin] The main argument is that we had to rescue the 
Republic's peace. The second argument is that we have changed a 
proposal that was designed solely to admit reelection for one 
that will permit us to strengthen our democratic institutions. 
  [NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS] Deputy "Chacho" Alvarez invited you 
"to 
reverse your decision" on the Olivos Pact. 
  [Alfonsin] Look here. I can see the preparations for a very 
strong campaign to distort the agreement on constitutional 
reform. I would very much regret it if Deputy Alvarez joins that 
campaign. 
  [NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS] What would that campaign seek? 
  [Alfonsin] I think there are some items that the right does 
not like at all, such as the limitations imposed on the 
president. I think there are people who would prefer to 
continue to have needed and urgent decrees issued in some areas. 
I think they would also object to the idea of a cabinet chief. 
I can feel the campaign unleashing. I do not know if I am 
wrong, but I can see it coming. 
  [NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS] What do you think of Alvarez' 
invitation not to fulfill your part of the pact? 
  [Alfonsin] I think it is absurd. We have signed an agreement 
and approved a law on those proposals. On the other hand, the 
Group of Basic Coincidences is precisely the guarantee for 
preventing the government from deviating and voting on a reform 
aimed solely at permitting the presidential reelection. 
  [NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS] Do you still have the idea of calling 
for all progressive sectors to join efforts in the 1995 
presidential election? Do you not think that your party's 
internal elections will complicate the matter once again? 
  [Alfonsin] I think you are right, particularly if some 
people 
continue maintaining the same positions. They have already done 
a lot of damage, and they might try to continue doing it in 
1995. They are not concerned. Perhaps they are only thinking in 
1999. We will try to get party organizations to give their 
opinions on those matters, and then we will continue ahead. 
  [NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS] Excuse me, sir, but the party 
organizations have already twice given their opinions with 
respect to the reform. 
  [Alfonsin] You are right. Perhaps they learned the lesson. 
We have lost a percentage of votes because of their position. 
  [NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS] Do you think the government lost 
support? 
  [Alfonsin] Without a doubt. The effects of certain social 
situations and the consequence of some economic policies were 
felt in this election. If policies are not amended, the 
opposition will inexorably increase. 
  [NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS] Can the UCR compete? 
  [Alfonsin] I am sure it can, if we adopt the appropriate 
strategies. 
  [NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS] It is unavoidable that we speak about 
candidacies. Eduardo Angeloz seems to have been favored by the 
election. 
  [Alfonsin] That is correct. Angeloz appears to occupy the 
best position. That is all I can say. 
  [NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS] Can the division of the opposition 
favor the ruling party? 
  [Alfonsin] I could not anticipate that. Our strategy 
attempts to prevent divisions among the group of progressive 
organizations. 
  [NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS] This is the fifth consecutive election 
that the UCR has lost. Some people say that you are a 
"hardheaded Galician" who cannot accept fact. 
  [Alfonsin] Well, we lost many successive elections by large 
percentages in the past, but we were able to come back. I think 
our worst performance was in 1962, but in 1963 we were winning 
again. We are in good shape to win. Even in this election. Had 
we presented ourselves united, we would have obtained excellent 
results.

  [Excerpts] Jujuy, 14 Apr (NA) -- The first decision Deputy 
Oscar Agustin Perassi (Justicialist Party-Jujuy) made following 
his installation as governor of Jujuy was to uphold the veto of 
the wage hike previously passed by Jose Carlos Ficoseco, who has 
gone on leave. [passage omitted] 
  Perassi replaces Ficoseco, who asked for a leave of absence 
until after the Constituent Assembly empowered to amend the 
Constitution concludes its sessions. Ficoseco was elected 
delegate to this assembly on 10 April. [passage omitted] 
  Soon after being installed yesterday evening, Perassi 
announced that he intends to reshuffle the provincial cabinet 
"gradually." He ruled out the possibility of co-governing with 
the other provincial parties, like the Jujuy Popular Movement, 
the UCR [Radical Civic Union], and the Republican Force.

  [Excerpt] (NA-DYN) -- The General Labour Confederation 
(CGT) and the Radical Party agreed yesterday [13 April] to push 
reforms to the Labour bill promoted by the government and to 
seek the support of the Church for this purpose. 
  Trade union leaders did not specify the points discussed but 
said both sides had opposed the planned overhaul of the 
union-run health insurance system. 
  ANSSAL [National Health Insurance Administration] national 
health administration director Jose Luis Lingiero unveiled an 
alternative union-backed health insurance scheme which advocates 
a gradual deregulation of the current system. The proposal will 
be presented to the government and businessmen. 
  The proposal came as a direct reply to Economy Minister 
Domingo Cavallo, who criticized the social welfare funds during 
a visit to Mexico, branding the Argentine system as corrupt. 
  "The union medical plans are and always will be a guarantee 
of health for workers, often replacing the inefficient public 
health system," Cassia said in a communique aired after his 
meeting with Alfonsin. 
  "One thing is to change for the better and another to 
pretend 
to overcome alleged shortcomings by handing health services over 
to other sectors which privilege profits over workers' needs," 
he added. 
  Cassia also told reporters the Radical Party had agreed to 
negotiate all future labour-related draft laws with CGT. 
  Also yesterday Alfonsin and the CGT chief ratified their 
wish 
to curtail the president's power to sign emergency decrees and 
analyzed the make-up of the future Socio-Economic Council to be 
set up after the reform of the Constitution. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 14 Apr (NA) -- Cuban Foreign Minister 
Roberto Robaina asserted that the nearly $1 billion debt Cuba 
has with Argentina "is not a tabled issue," but that Fidel 
Castro's administration "does not have the necessary money to 
repay it." 
  After meeting with Senate bloc leaders on 13 April, Robaina 
said: "In our view, the fact that the debt issue has not been 
tabled means that we will assess all possibilities and 
mechanisms so as to include some items like medicines and 
agroindustrial input." 
  Robaina was received after the meeting by President Carlos 
Menem at the Olivos presidential residence. The Cuban foreign 
minister noted that his trip to Argentina "mainly seeks to 
explain the investment opportunities Cuba offers." To this 
effect, he expected to hold talks with local business people 
from different sectors. 
  The diplomat -- who headed the Cuban Communist Youth General 
Secretariat in the 80's and is now considered one of Fidel 
Castro's "dauphins" [delfines] -- said the opening of the 
country to foreign capital "is part of the situation Cuba is 
going through, which can be labeled difficult." 
  He stated that this economic opening drive also applies to 
the political sphere. Regarding this, he said: "Cuba is 
willing to take any subject to the negotiating table as long as 
it does not affect its independence and sovereignty." 
  "Opening does not mean going backward in education, health 
care, science, or sports because these are achievements that we 
are not prepared to negotiate," he remarked. 
  Robaina explained: "The concept of a normal political 
opening in any country that lives under normal conditions cannot 
be applied in the case of Cuba, since it continues to be a 
besieged stronghold and cannot afford to lose its unity." 
  Commenting on the possibilities of a meeting between 
Presidents Carlos Menem and Fidel Castro at the next 
Ibero-American summit to be held in Cartagena de Indias, 
Colombia, in May, Robaina said it will depend on the heads of 
state's respective agendas. 
  "There are no concrete plans for a meeting, but we keep an 
open mind about it and the practical possibilities of holding 
such a meeting will depend on the meeting date and on Menem's 
and Castro's respective agendas in Cartagena," he pointed out. 
  With regard to trade relations between both countries, the 
Cuban foreign minister said: "There are many opportunities and 
our efforts are geared to areas like tourism, medical and 
paramedical services, biotechnology, and agriculture. 
Nevertheless, we have not yet discussed any project in 
particular." 
  Robaina stated: "Cuba has opened the country to foreign 
investment as part of a huge package of measures that are under 
way. This is precisely what we intend to explain to Argentine 
entrepreneurs. In this lies the fundamental objective of our 
visit."

  [Excerpt] (DYN-NA) -- Both signatories of the Olivos Pact 
on constitutional reform, President Carlos Menem and Radical 
Party chairman Raul Alfonsin, moved yesterday [13 April] to 
squelch continuing rumours that the accord would be opened up 
for point-by-point negotiations yesterday. 
  The Radical leader also continued to defend his decision to 
support the ruling Justicialist Party's reform platform last 
year despite his party's distant second-place finish in Sunday's 
[10 April] Constituent Assembly election. 
  "I have complete assurance," Menem said yesterday, "that no 
matter how much (Radical Deputy) Jesus Rodriguez has expressed 
his desire to support Frente (Grande) or make an alliance" the 
pact will be fulfilled. 
  Rodriguez led the Radicals' Federal Capital slate of 
candidates to a third-place finish in a district that until last 
year's congressional election had been the party's stronghold. 
Following Sunday's election he raised the possibility of forming 
a broad opposition coalition to defeat Menem next year if the 
Constituent Assembly approves the Olivos Pact, which would 
permit the President to run for two consecutive terms in office.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Argentina monitored through 14 
April. 
  Pluspetrol executives said a well drilled in the Ramos area 
of Salta Province has yielded a record production of 1.5 million 
cubic meters per day. This is one of the most productive wells 
in the continent. With five wells in operation, the gas field 
already produces 6 million cubic meters per day, about 8 percent 
of the country's total gas production. The drilling required a 
$10 million investment. The Ramos gas field's proven reserves 
total 100 billion cubic meters. (Buenos Aires PAGINA/12 in 
Spanish 9 Apr 94 p 8) 
  The discovery of a large gas field by Total, a French oil 
company, in the Southern Basin might increase the national gas 
production rate 20 to 25 percent. The drilling of two wells 
into the Carina offshore structure, 70 km off shore Tierra del 
Fuego Province, has been successful, yielding between 470,000 
and 485,000 cubic meters of gas per day. After the new 
discovery, the basin's probable reserves might range between 120 
and 150 billion cubic meters. (Buenos Aires PAGINA/12 in 
Spanish 9 Apr 94 p 8) 
  With the goal of curbing public spending and improving the 
honest and efficient use of state funds, the executive branch 
limited, through Decree No. 502, the ministers' powers to 
allocate and implement their respective appropriations. This 
was reported by Budget Under Secretary Marcos Makon, who 
explained that the decree signed by President Menem on 8 April 
establishes, among other measures, that the budget cannot be 
increased, even if there is more income, and there cannot be any 
reallocations unless there is a specific national executive 
branch decree. (Buenos Aires NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS in Spanish 
0011 GMT 13 Apr 94)

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "What Is the CNEA: Atomic Inventory"] </F>
  [Text] The CNEA [National Atomic Energy Commission] 
includes: 
  Three nuclear plants (Atucha-I and Embalse, in operation, 
and 
Atucha-II, under construction). 
  Three atomic centers (Bariloche, Constituyentes, and 
Ezeiza). 
  Eight associated enterprises (INVAP [Applied Research 
Institute], Coratec [expansion unknown], ALTEC [expansion 
unknown], ENACE [Argentine Nuclear Enterprise for Electrical 
Power Plants], Nuclear Mendoza, CONUAR [Argentine Nuclear Fuel 
Corporation, Inc.], FAESA [expansion unknown], and ENSI 
[expansion unknown]). 
A uranium concentrate plant (San Rafael). 
A manufacturing plant (Cordoba, for the manufacture of 
uranium dioxide). 
A heavy water industrial plant (Neuquen). 
A pilot plant for enriching uranium (Pilcaniyeu). 
Three reactors for research and training (Constituyentes, 
Bariloche, and Pilcaniyeu). 
A reactor that produces radioisotopes (Ezeiza).

<F P=106> [Interview with Energy Secretary Carlos Bastos by </F>
unidentified reporter; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [CLARIN] Will the CNEA [National Commission for 
Atomic Energy] be privatized? 
  [Bastos] Let us begin with something more basic. Let us 
discuss the prospects for nuclear energy. When organizing the 
field, the state reserved for itself the role of supervising 
private activities and determining policies. For most countries 
where this activity is being developed with the private sector, 
nuclear energy is considered one of the future options to 
satisfy energy demand. In Argentina we developed our own nuclear 
industry, with our own technicians, heavy water fuel, and 
companies. It would be a grave mistake to waste all this wealth. 
The Energy Secretariat, as the agency responsible for 
determining policies, is deeply interested in seeing nuclear 
energy as one of the future energy options in Argentina. 
  [CLARIN] There is a study conducted by the Mediterranean 
Foundation headed by Juan Novara saying that the CNEA is not 
competitive and that nuclear energy is expensive, dirty, and is 
being abandoned throughout the world. Is this not contrary to 
what you just said? 
  [Bastos] Fortunately, we have had differences of opinion at 
the Mediterranean Foundation and each one can freely voice one's 
opinion. Yes, it is a little bit contradictory. I do not fully 
share Novara's views. 
  [CLARIN] But the International Atomic Energy Agency contends 
that 100 nuclear power plants are under construction at present. 
  [Bastos] I am not an expert in that field, but to talk about 
100 nuclear power plants is a bit too much. I do not believe 
that such a number of power plants is under construction ... 
  [CLARIN] The report specifically states that there are 72 
power stations under construction and another 54, the 
construction of which already has been approved ... 
  [Bastos] I could not give you precise data. What I do know, 
however, is that all industrial countries are trying to devise 
ways to lower the cost of future nuclear projects by trying to 
build a series of nuclear power plants having a standard design 
and improving security. In this regard, I disagree with 
Novara's assertion that atomic energy is expensive. Well, it is 
indeed expensive now because a barrel of oil costs $14. If the 
price rises to $20, things would change completely. 
  [CLARIN] And how will nuclear activities move ahead? 
  [Bastos] That is the key issue. The industry's organization 
is based on the participation of the private sector in risk 
ventures. It does not pertain to the state engaging in risk 
undertakings. The state is interested in developing nuclear 
activities but without participating as an entrepreneur. The 
CNEA cannot continue functioning as it is now; it must be 
restructured. At present it combines control with business 
activities and receives money from the Treasury for investments. 
It has been decided that the CNEA will be restructured so as to 
separate regulatory from business activities. This will have 
been concluded by December. 
  [CLARIN] Will they be privatized then? 
  [Bastos] That is totally reasonable. With our way of [answer 
incomplete as published] 
  [CLARIN] Incorporating private capital or selling the shares 
of the private stock company? 
  [Bastos] In the privatization of companies in the field, 
like 
Segba [Greater Buenos Aires Electrical Services] for example, we 
made what is known as a strategic sale of shares. We sold a 
percentage of the shares and the companies' control was 
transferred to the buyers of those shares. We took that line of 
action because it was impossible to reorganize those public 
companies within the framework of the state. Is the CNEA now in 
a similar situation to that of Segba? The answer is no because 
nuclear power plants are in an excellent situation. They have 
plenty of financial resources at their disposal, which shows 
that there are top-quality operation and maintenance groups. So 
what do we stand to gain by transferring the management of these 
nuclear power plants? Very little. Our first attempt to 
transfer the CNEA to the private sector will be made along the 
same lines as YPF [Government Oil Deposits]. 
  [CLARIN] How much do you estimate CNEA Inc. would be worth? 
  [Bastos] The CNEA has a positive flow of funds amounting to 
slightly over $200 million annually. 
  [CLARIN] Once Atucha-II is operational its value will 
increase considerably. 
  [Bastos] That is precisely the point. It is very difficult 
to make an estimate because it depends on the investments that 
will be made to complete Atucha-II. Nevertheless, let us 
suppose that of the $200 million, the net cash flow totals $90 
million. With a rate of return for seven years, it would add up 
to $600 million, which in turn is what we estimated is missing 
to complete Atucha-II. 
  [CLARIN] That is a very low estimate. The CNEA contributed 
$8.5 billion compared with the $600 million that could be 
obtained from the selling of all the shares. 
  [Bastos] We go back to the starting point, when we said 
atomic energy is expensive. I said it was because a barrel of 
crude today costs $14 and these estimates are based on this oil 
price. If the prices climbs to $20 or $30, things will change. 
Even so I would not venture to say that it is a total loss. 
  [CLARIN] But $600 million compared with $8.5 billion ... 
  [Bastos] Yes, it is true. We are not taking into account how 
much the Atucha-I and Embalse Rio Tercero power plants produced, 
whether a very low price was paid, and whether the benefits were 
transferred to consumers. State Water and Power Enterprise and 
Segba had debts to the CNEA that were not totally repaid ... 
  [CLARIN] The CNEA argues that they owe it $500 million ... 
  [Bastos] In all likelihood the federal government was the 
one 
that remained as a debtor, but at the same time the CNEA also 
granted some type of credit to the government [as published]. 
Therefore, the best thing to do is start everything fresh. 
  [CLARIN] I insist, do you not think that $600 million is a 
very low price for two nuclear power plants that are already 
operational, Atucha-II -- 70 percent of which is already 
completed, and other industrial plants? 
  [Bastos] I do not think so. It depends on many things. We 
will never have a 100 percent return on investment for Atucha-II 
because it is a capital-intensive sector. When there are 
construction delays, the costs are terrible and one has to 
forego obtaining a 100 percent return on investment. Is the 
CNEA to blame for the cost of Atucha-II? It is not entirely to 
blame for it. The power plant's construction involves the 
handling of 40 or more contracts. During the times of 
hyperinflation, most of them were paralyzed. 
  [CLARIN] Do you approve of Manuel Mondino as a likely 
executive manager of CNEA Inc.? 
  [Bastos] I am going to give you the opinion of a teammate. 
From the technical standpoint, I think that all the CNEA staff 
is excellent. The only criticism I might have is that they need 
more knowledge about business administration, but they can be 
quickly trained in this field.

  [Excerpt] (DYN-NA) -- Federal Judge Nerio Bonifatti has 
formally acquitted former presidential audiences director and 
the President's sister-in-law Amira Yoma in the notorious 
"Yomagate" scandal. 
  Amira Yoma has been summoned to appear in court this 
afternoon to receive the official notification that she has been 
definitely cleared. 
  President Menem yesterday [13 April] said that he regretted 
the way his sister-in-law had been treated since she was first 
accused of being part of the drug money-laundering scheme. Menem 
also accused the press of blowing up the statements of 
drug-dealer Andy de la Cruz Iglesias. 
  Bonifatti, who has been tipped for promotion to the Federal 
Appeals Court, is thought to have quashed the case on the basis 
of insufficient evidence. 
  Last week Federal Prosecutor Carlos Stornelli had 
recommended 
the acquittal of Yoma and other co-defendants. Stornelli is 
reportedly in line to succeed Bonifatti when he steps up to the 
Federal Court. 
  In 1991 Amira Yoma along with her then husband Ibrahim 
al-Ibrahim were accused by various witnesses of having been seen 
at Ezeiza International Airport with suitcases allegedly full of 
drug earnings from the United States. 
  The money passed through Customs without difficulty due to 
Amira's position as Presidential Audiences Secretary at 
Government House and her husband's senior Customs position, even 
though he hardly spoke Spanish and held a Syrian passport.

  [Text] [Announcer Carlos Mesa] At approximately 1930 on 11 
April, I received a phone call from Edgar Fernandez Lazcano. 
Katia Rodriguez now will inform us about this phone call. 
  [Begin recording] [Katia Rodriguez] Edgar Fernandez said he 
met DEA agents in Bogota, Colombia, but that he managed to dodge 
the U.S. agents in Costa Rica. This is the report: 
  [Reporter Amalia Pando, identified by screen caption] Edgar 
Fernandez Lazcano, who worked for Isaac Chavarria, phoned the 
PAT [Television Journalists Association] to tell us he is not in 
the DEA's hands. But when Carlos Mesa asked him where he was, 
he said he would rather remain underground. When he was asked 
how he paid for his trips and these costly phone calls, he broke 
down in tears. 
  [Fernandez] I am so desperate that I am begging for justice 
in my country and the support of my university mates, the media, 
and all those who believe I am not lying. 
  [Pando] We have confirmed that the person who phoned was in 
fact Edgar Fernandez Lazcano, Chavarria's employee. Let us hear 
this person in the recording heard by the Constituent Commission: 
  [Fernandez] Help me don Oscar; I have no money. You cannot 
screw me after all I have witnessed, such as when you received 
40,000..... 
  [Pando] Now let us hear the person who phoned PAT: 
  [Fernandez] My name is Edgar Fernandez Lazcano, identity 
card and passport No. 3365571, both issued in La Paz. 
  [Pando] There is no doubt that the voice belongs to the same 
person. Moreover, he correctly answered personal questions, 
such as when he obtained his identity card or what address he 
gave at the immigrations office when he applied for a passport. 
Therefore, we are certain that the person who phoned PAT was, 
in fact, Edgar Fernandez Lazcano. 
  We told him we wanted to know how he left Bolivia and 
entered 
Costa Rica because there is evidence that Fernandez Lazcano was 
abducted by the DEA. 
  [Fernandez] I will tell you how I left Bolivia when I am 
given guarantees to return to Bolivia. I will tell you what 
towns I went through, what means of transportation I used -- all 
of it public transportation. I was never in contact with the 
DEA. The first time I got in contact with the DEA was when I 
arrived in Bogota. 
  [Pando] As you see, all the details of how he left Bolivia 
are uncertain. He told us later he ended up in Bogota, 
Colombia, but to enter Colombia you need an entry visa, which 
can be requested at any consulate. PAT confirmed that Fernandez 
Lazcano had not acquired that visa. He never appeared at the 
Colombia consulate in La Paz, Lima, or Quito. How then did he 
enter Colombia without a visa? One thing Fernandez Lazcano does 
admit is that the DEA took him to Costa Rica. 
  [Fernandez] When we arrived in Bogota, I talked to DEA 
agents. I concretely told them: The only thing I demand is that 
you help me reach the United States, and once I am there I will 
disclose everything. I admit having gone to Bogota. Initially 
they told me we would go to Panama and I said: Well, I will 
speak in Panama. At first they said: No. Speak now; tell us 
all you know now; tell us what they say. I answered: No, I am 
not going to speak here; I will speak in another country. At my 
insistence -- because I said the United States or nothing -- 
they first said we would go to Panama because the plane was too 
small to fly from Bogota to the United States. So, first we 
will go to Panama. When we were about to land in Panama, 
because I thought we were heading for Panama -- I do not know 
why because the people who picked me up spoke English and 
understood, two of them especially, very little Spanish, I 
wondered whether we were in Panama, but it turned out we were in 
Costa Rica. 
  [Pando] Edgar Fernandez Lazcano's version sounds even more 
incredible when he says that he managed to dodge the DEA in 
Costa Rica. 
  [Fernandez] As you said, in Costa Rica I dodged the DEA, 
because I was surprised only three people interviewed me given 
the importance of the U.S. Embassy. I decided to follow my 
plan. I was arrested in Costa Rica because I decided to wait a 
few days and not go to Nicaragua as I planned in the belief that 
the DEA would be after me in Costa Rica. 
  [Pando] According to Edgar Fernandez Lazcano, after getting 
away from the DEA he was detained, by chance, for 27 hours by 
Costa Rican police. After he was released, a Bolivian 
prosecutor arrived to interrogate him. 
  [Mesa] Didn't you try to contact the DEA or did the DEA seek 
you after you were released in Costa Rica, and were you able to 
move freely and leave Costa Rica without any problems? 
  [Fernandez] This is what surprised me and made me really 
happy because when I was arrested the first thing I thought was: 
The Bolivian DEA [as heard] is quite capable of sending a fax 
or something and messing up my life because I have dodged them. 
But I became very happy when I realized they were not aware... 
  [Pando] Despite what Isaac Chavarria's employee asserts, the 
Costa Rican Government has its own version. It said Fernandez 
Lazcano left Costa Rica in a DEA aircraft bound for Miami. It 
is quite likely that Edgar Fernandez Lazcano may have made fun 
of the DEA but it is quite unlikely he will make fun of all of 
us. 
  [Fernandez] Regarding my job with Isaac Chavarria, I was one 
of his close aides. I do not know what he considered me, 
probably his dog's keeper, an employee with no rank; I do not 
know. But, unfortunately, during the several years I worked for 
him I learned about a lot of things. 
  [Pando] Edgar Fernandez Lazcano's conversation with Carlos 
Mesa lasted 45 minutes. During it he ratified all he told the 
Bolivian prosecutor in Costa Rica and a lot more. Among the new 
things he said was that Jaime Paz Zamora's government had 
offered Isaac Chavarria the possibility of benefiting from the 
repentance law. 
  [Fernandez] Before the 120-day deadline the government 
granted the drug traffickers to surrender, Susana Seleme went -- 
I do not have concrete evidence about this but I was told that 
the captain was upset by the two visits Susana Seleme paid him 
on weekends to suggest that he surrender, that he benefit from 
the repentance law. 
  [Mesa] Who told you that? 
  [Fernandez] The captain's wife; you can ask her. I am sure 
she will not lie; I know she is aware of my true situation. 
  [Pando] So far we have all heard that Chavarria gave Paz 
Zamora money, but according to this new version Jaime Paz Zamora 
gave Chavarria $40,000. 
  [Fernandez] I maintain that Edith [Paz Zamora's sister] went 
to Santa Cruz, to Los Troncos town, where she met Chavarria. 
She asked Chavarria to help her find some good land to buy for 
Jaime Paz's sons. Taking advantage of this occasion, Edith 
said: Oso [Chavarria's nickname], Jaime has sent you this 
$40,000. 
  [Mesa] In other words, Jaime Paz gave Chavarria $40,000. 
  [Fernandez] That is precisely what happened. 
  [Pando] To that end, Fernandez Lazcano said he wants to 
return to Bolivia to speak, to disclose all he knows, but said 
he fears he will be arrested. He refused to say where he is 
now. Anyway, we all know he is in Miami, to be more precise, in 
the DEA offices. And we say this based on the report issued by 
the Costa Rican Government to journalists. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] Our colleague Amalia Pando has prepared an 
exhaustive report on former President Jaime Paz Zamora's 
statements to Congress. He appeared before Congress as a 
witness rather than defendant in a case investigating possible 
links between the MIR [Leftist Revolutionary Movement] and drug 
trafficking. This is what the Constituent Commission must 
determine, and this is why the former president of the Republic 
was summoned to testify. 
  The following is Amalia Pando's report: 
  [Begin recording] [Pando] The information that former 
President Jaime Paz Zamora today gave the Constituent Commission 
confirms his close friendship with Isaac Chavarria, who has been 
arrested under charges of drug trafficking. Paz Zamora, 
however, repeatedly denied having been aware or even suspected 
that his friend was linked to drug trafficking. 
  [Paz] As I have already stated, it started off as a 
political 
relationship. He wanted to work, from the political viewpoint, 
with the MIR and for the candidacy of Jaime Paz Zamora. But 
this relationship turned into a friendship in view of his moving 
background, which he himself disclosed, and the work and 
personal contacts he maintained. This is why if you were to ask 
me how many times I met with Isaac Chavarria, I would not be 
able to answer you. It is the same as if I were to ask you about 
any of your friends, and you started telling him how many times 
you saw him, where you saw him, how many times you met with him, 
etc. It should be pointed out that this friendship grew 
stronger, especially in 1987, and declined a little in 1988. 
But we hardly saw each other in 1989, and almost never during 
my four years as president of the Republic. This relationship, 
through me, spread to my family. Well, not all my family, but 
to my two sisters. I want to point out that this relationship 
never involved any type of crime. I also want to point out that 
Mr. Chavarria was always willing to work, to undertake projects. 
He always showed a great civic and patriotic spirit. I think 
he longed for his years in the Army. [passage omitted] 
  If my great friend Isaac Chavarria now has the misfortune of 
being involved in drug trafficking, I deeply regret it. But 
this fact by no means can stain the spotless relationship I 
maintained with him in the past. 
  [Pando] When the so-called narco-photo [showing Paz Zamora 
with Chavarria] was published, Chavarria was identified as a 
drug trafficker, but not even on that occasion did Paz Zamora 
suspect anything. He said that the reason was that on that 
occasion Chavarria disclosed his address, but that the Special 
Antinarcotics Force [FELCN] did not visit him. 
  He also referred to the position of his social defense 
secretary at that time, Alderete. 
  [Paz] The interesting thing is that on 11 June, I think, the 
media reported Alderete's answer to Deputy Gonzalez Quintanilla. 
As a result of the anonymous photograph attached to a letter 
sent to Congress, Alderete, the social defense secretary in Paz 
Estenssoro's government, promised Quintanilla, Congress, and the 
Bolivian people that within a week he would have a list of Isaac 
Chavarria's crimes, which he would send to all FELCN offices 
throughout the country. The country is still waiting for this 
information, which he had said would be ready within one week. 
  [Pando] MIR Deputy Luis Vasquez asked Paz Zamora whether the 
MIR leaders had ever warned him about the risks his friendship 
with Chavarria entailed. 
  [Paz] I want to reiterate what I have already said. I never 
suspected that Isaac Chavarria was involved in any crime. What 
fellow partisan Susana Seleme [Paz Zamora's private secretary] 
disclosed here before Congress does not belong to a specific 
meeting in Santa Cruz. I was never told: Fellow partisan Jaime 
Paz, come, sit down, we want to talk to you about this problem. 
What I did notice was that some [MIR] members did not like him. 
That is a fact. But MIR leader Guillermo Capobianco and other 
high-ranking members, for example, didn't have this problem. 
  [Pando] In 1990 Chavarria's home in La Paz was raided. Jaime 
Paz Zamora heard about this, and ordered his private secretary 
to find out about it at the FELCN. 
  [Paz] It was not a precise order. What I did do was to ask 
her to find out what had happened because, as I have already 
stated, the private secretary never gave instructions; in this 
case, she only asked for information on what had happened to 
determine whether there was anything illegal about the charges. 
That is what happened. Susana Seleme, as [name indistinct] 
mentioned and also reminded me, informed me that she had phoned 
(General Anez) who told her it was a routine operation among the 
hundreds and hundreds of routine operations the FELCN carries 
out. I think they call them warning operations. And that was 
the end of that. After receiving that information I forgot the 
issue but now, after years, I realize through some documents 
mentioned here in Congress that the operation was not directed 
against Isaac Chavarria. 
  [Unidentified legislator] Didn't this information about the 
FELCN operation against Chavarria's home, linked to a recent 
event, arise any suspicions? We are talking about something 
that happened in 1989 or 1990, when you said called outrageous 
the charges that Chavarria was involved in drug trafficking. 
Didn't the information on the FELCN operation against 
Chavarria's home cause you to suspect something? 
  [Paz] The truth is that I accepted the explanation I was 
given, because in my capacity as president I had a thousand and 
one other things to think about, and forgot the issue. As I 
have already stated, my contacts with Chavarria had become very 
sporadic. At that time it had been almost a year since I had 
last seen him. 
  [Pando] After Chavarria's home in Irpavi was raided by the 
FELCN, Paz Zamora met with Chavarria at Edith Paz Zamora's home. 
He was asked whether on that occasion Chavarria ever mentioned 
the FELCN raid on his home in Irpavi. 
  [Paz] I do not remember. I am afraid I do not remember. 
Aside from our talks on the railroad ties -- because he 
explained the problem, and I told him I would learn more about 
it before I decided what should be done -- the meeting lasted 
longer than ever because we discussed politics. Chavarria is 
very interested in politics. 
  [Pando] Paz Zamora definitely did not find out before, 
during, or after his government that Chavarria was a drug 
trafficker. He also said that neither social defense under 
secretary (Gonzalo Torricos) nor the FELCN had warned him that 
Chavarria was involved in illegal activities. At this point 
Deputy Juan del Granado read 13 press reports from PRESENCIA, 
HOY, and other newspapers published in 1991, accusing Chavarrias 
of drug trafficking. 
  [Del Granado] ...PRESENCIA reports that Isaac Chavarria -- I 
mean Isaac Etcheverria -- heads a list of the nine most 
sought-after drug traffickers by Bolivian courts and anti-drug 
agents the United States had stationed in Bolivia. Didn't you 
read this information? 
  [Paz] No, I didn't. Well, there was another drug trafficker 
called Etcheverria who I believe was taken to the United States, 
but I think it was before then. I think he was the one who 
produced the evidence against [name indistinct]. But, well, in 
any case it does not refer to that Etcheverria. I did not learn 
about this, but what I wonder is, if it is true, why was I not 
informed directly? The FELCN is semi-autonomous. Why was there 
so much noise and no action? Alderete announced something in 
1988, but never did anything about it. I think that worse than 
the fact that I did not read that press report, is that if the 
information was true nothing was done about it. 
  [Pando] But there were 13, not only one, press reports 
published around the same time mentioning Isaac Etcheverria and 
Isaac Chavarria as two of the most important Bolivian drug 
traffickers. Why didn't the FELCN arrest Chavarria during Paz 
Zamora's government? Paz Zamora himself asked this question 
which, some way or another, the Constituent Commission must 
answer. The second important aspect of Paz Zamora's statements 
to the commission were his charges, sometimes in a direct and 
sometimes in an indirect manner, against the U.S. Embassy and 
the FELCN of having orchestrated this plot to destroy the MIR, 
his family, and him. [passage omitted] 
  [Paz] I want to fully reiterate what I said in my message to 
the Bolivian people on 26 March. I reiterate my intention to 
withdraw from politics. I have realized there is a plan, 
through me, to damage the country, its image. There is a plan 
to harm the Republic, to harm values for which all Bolivians 
have worked hard, such as the values of democracy, national 
coexistence, national unity. I have also realized that there is 
not only a plan to harm our country, through me, but also my 
party. 
  [Pando] On this occasion Paz Zamora tried to change from 
playing defendant to plaintiff, and for this he railed against 
the FELCN, which is not very popular and on many occasions has 
been repudiated by the people. We will have to await the 
Constituent Commission's final report to know whether Jaime Paz' 
charges against dubious FELCN procedures will clear all that has 
been said about the connection he, his family, and the MIR 
reportedly maintained with drug trafficker Isaac Chavarria.

  [Text] La Paz, 14 Apr (EFE) -- Most Bolivian citizens who 
listened to former President Jaime Paz Zamora's voluntary 
testimony were discouraged and uncertain because he did not 
dissipate doubts regarding alleged links between politics and 
drug trafficking. 
  The public questioning by the Chamber of Deputies 
Constitution Committee of former President Paz Zamora maintained 
a very high audience during its six-hour broadcast, comparable 
only to the rating obtained by broadcasts of the soccer matches 
played by the Bolivian team to qualify for the 1994 World Cup. 
  Paz Zamora left citizens uncertain when he emphatically 
denied any link by his family, party, or himself to drug 
trafficking, yet at the same time admitted his personal 
friendship with drug trafficker Isaac "Oso" Chavarria. 
  The people's discouragement became worse when the high 
degree 
of dependency the country has on the United States was reflected 
in the statements to Congress by former President Paz Zamora. 
His words ratified similar statements by current President 
Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada. 
  Last weekend Sanchez de Lozada revealed something the 
Bolivian people suspected but did not openly admit: "We have a 
terrible dependency on the IMF, the U.S. Embassy, and the World 
Bank, who tell us what to do." 
  Paz Zamora warned that the U.S. cooperation in the struggle 
against drug trafficking may turn into interference. He added 
that no one had informed him that his "good friend Chavarria" 
was an alleged drug trafficker and that he, as president, was 
informed about antinarcotics operations. 
  "Everyone obeys who pays him," Paz Zamora said, adding that 
the Special Antinarcotics Force (FELCN) is not only advised but 
paid as well by the U.S. DEA. 
  The former president's statements seemed to be aimed at 
rekindling the traditional anti-U.S. feelings of the Bolivian 
people. He also roused a feeling of solidarity with his cause 
when he stated that he had "pinned the national banner on his 
chest" to implement "coca diplomacy," which hurt the feelings of 
the U.S. Government. 
  Paz Zamora and George Bush in 1990 signed a drug enforcement 
agreement that is still in force that regulates financial and 
technical cooperation, the DEA's advising of FELCN, and the 
substitution of coca crops. 
  Coca leaves, which are the raw material for cocaine, have 
become a point of friction between Bolivia and the United 
States. This Andean nation recognizes the need to eradicate 
cocaine but also faces a serious social and economic problem 
with the destruction of coca crops, which produce a living for 
about 300,000 peasants.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Bolivia monitored through 14 
April: 
  The Superintendency of Banks has reported that the private 
banking system made a $23.5 million net profit in 1993, a 0.8 
percent increase over the previous year. Public savings 
increased $517.1 million. (La Paz PRESENCIA in Spanish 25 Mar 94 
p 4) 
  On 28 March, the Swiss and Bolivian Governments signed four 
cooperation agreements totalling $6 million that will be used to 
promote several development projects. (La Paz HOY in Spanish 29 
Mar 94 Political Section p 11) 
  The National Statistics Institute, INE, reported that the 
inflation rate in March was 0.08 percent, the lowest so far this 
year. The cumulated inflation rate for the first three months 
of the year is 1.29 percent. The decision to hold fuel prices 
avoided a major inflation rise. (La Paz HOY in Spanish 5 Apr 94 
p 19) 
  The INE reported that the economy grew 4.6 percent in the 
first two months of the year. Agricultural production increased 
by 6.5 percent; livestock by 1.3 percent; hydrocarbons by 22.2 
percent; gas production by 25.6 percent; fuel by 16.9 percent; 
mining products by 27.4 percent; construction by 3.7 percent; 
commerce by 1.7 percent; and bank services by 12 percent. (La 
Paz PRESENCIA in Spanish 5 Apr Economic Section p 4) 
  Human Development Minister Enrique Ipina on 4 April reported 
that the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, and 
``friendly'' countries have donated a total of $180 million to 
Bolivia for the education reform project. (La Paz HOY in Spanish 
5 Apr 94 p 19)

  [Text] Economy Minister Alvaro Garcia and the minister vice 
president of Corfo [Production Development Corporation], Felipe 
Sandoval, announced this afternoon at a news conference the 
government's decision to privatize Lan-Chile [Chilean National 
Airline], Edelnor [Northern Electricity Company], Empremar 
[State Maritime Enterprise], and Transcontainer [branch of 
Empremar], which will allow, said Minister Garcia, increasing 
the public resources needed to improve the opportunities of 
Chileans with little resources. 
  Garcia added that the privatization process of Lan-Chile for 
the sale of about 35 percent of its shares has begun. He added 
that keeping Lan-Chile will only introduce distortions and make 
competition in the air market too rigid. It also was announced 
that the contract the government will sign with a brokerage firm 
for bidding on Lan-Chile was sent to the General Comptroller's 
Office. The call for bids to privatize Lan-Chile and the other 
companies will be made at the national and international level. 
  Minister Felipe Sandoval referred specifically to the case 
of 
the Empremar Company, which has a branch, Transcontainer: 
  [Begin Sandoval recording] This company has a legal 
restriction imposed during the military regime that prevents the 
state from selling more than 35 percent of the company. What we 
will do in the next few days is to submit a bill to remove that 
restriction on the company in order to allow its capitalization, 
to allow its association with the private sector in order to 
solve its economic problems. [end recording] 
  Economy Minister Alvaro Garcia was asked if this decision 
that is being made only one month after the new government was 
inaugurated was a bit too hasty, too fast. 
  [Begin Garcia recording] As we said, our intention is to 
have 
the markets operate efficiently. And we believe market 
conditions will allow the efficient operation of these companies 
through the private sector. [end recording] 
  Garcia said the government will guarantee an appropriate 
price for the sale of public companies, thus safeguarding 
workers' legitimate interests and giving them the option to 
participate in their purchase. He also said this privatization 
process is the first in this administration and the idea is to 
continue with the privatization of public companies because it 
is the best way, Garcia emphasized, to safeguard the interests 
of all Chileans, especially the poor.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Ernesto Paz Aguilar by </F>
Reporter Roberto Reyes Pineda at Toncintin Airport on 11 April; 
from the "This Very Day" newscast -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Paz] The Honduran Government is very pleased with 
the working visit by the president [title as heard] of Costa 
Rica, by President Figueres. There is no doubt that we have 
made progress on the road to integration, on the road to 
rapprochement with the Central American peoples. 
  [Reyes] Is the position Costa Rica has maintained in the 
past 
few years going to change with the arrival of Jose Maria 
Figueres? 
  [Paz] Yes, we believe that the National Liberation Party's 
leading of the Costa Rican Government, will ease the Central 
American integration process. It will ease the rapprochement 
Costa Rica should undertake with the rest of the Central America. 
  [Reyes] Was an agreement reached with President-elect 
Figueres? 
  [Paz] No joint communique was signed, given that he will not 
take office until 8 May. Nevertheless, the doors have been 
opened for a dialogue, the channels of communication have been 
opened between both governments. 
  [Reyes] Is there anything specific with regard to trade 
relations, the increase that could take place in this sector? 
  [Paz] Basically we talked about the impact the signing of 
NAFTA has had and its repercussions on Central America; what 
position should we Central Americans take on this free trade 
agreement which is a challenge to our nations. We also talked 
about structuring a common strategy to face problems such as the 
marketing of coffee, the price of bananas, and so forth. 
  [Reyes] Was Mr. Figueres asked about Costa Rica's experience 
as a member of GATT, given that Honduras is on the verge of 
becoming a member? 
  [Paz] If I recall correctly, at the Latin American level 
there are just two nations that are not members of the GATT, 
that is Panama and another South American nation. These, 
however, will join in the coming months. Costa Rica does have a 
long history and vast successful experience in the integration 
of the Costa Rican economy in the new international business 
structure. 
  [Reyes] How are the good relations between Honduras and 
Costa 
Rica seen in the coming years? 
  [Paz] I can say we have very good relations, and we expect 
to 
develop and enhance them even further.

<F P=106> [Message to the Nation by President Guillermo Endara from </F>
the Palace of the Herons in Panama City on 14 April -- recorded] 
  [Text] Fellow countrymen: One of the most important duties 
I have as president of a transition government moving the nation 
toward democracy is to ensure clean and free elections. I have 
committed myself to this because the country needs it. I have 
put forth my best efforts to ensure that the traumas we have 
traditionally experienced during similar situations not be 
repeated, especially the shameful experience of the May 1989 
elections. 
  However, it is one thing to guarantee free elections, and it 
is another thing to remain silent while, amid the heated 
electoral campaign, my government is being subjected to unfair 
criticism that neglects the very special circumstances under 
which we have had to work. 
  Within this context, I have decided to make public some 
material of genuinely historical value. I learned of the 
specific contents of this material only a few days ago. Since 
then, I have conscientiously weighed this in my mind. I 
deliberated greatly on whether or not I should disclose its 
contents. In the end, what weighed most in terms of my decision 
was the knowledge that my teacher, Dr. Arnulfo Arias Madrid, 
would have disclosed this material if he were in my position, 
because, if the voice of the people is indeed the voice of God, 
then the people are sovereign and have a right to know. The 
truth must not be hidden from the people, especially truth that 
is relevant when important decisions must be made. My 
conscience would bother me if, knowing that this material is in 
my hands, I did not inform the Panamanian people of its contents. 
  The film clips you will now see are only a sample of 
hundreds 
of films personally recorded by public officials of that time -- 
tapes that were filmed and recorded by the officials of those 
days. They were the only ones who filmed this material. You 
will see their faces and hear their voices in all their crudity. 
They are official Presidency documents that I am making public. 
As a Panamanian these truths embarrass me and fill me with great 
shame. However, this happened in our country. 
  As president, I would not like to see this happen again in 
Panama. However, this does not depend on me. It will depend 
solely on the Panamanian people's choice on 8 May. I will hand 
over power to the person elected by the people. 
  Thank you very much.

<F P=106> [Video montage of recorded footage of events leading to the </F>
1989 U.S. invasion of Panama; narrated by unidentified 
announcer; released to the public by Panamanian President 
Guillermo Endara following a recorded message to the nation in 
Panama City on 14 April] 
  [Text] [Announcer] The military and civilian dictatorship's 
regime turned the Electoral Tribunal [TE] into a machine to 
thwart the people's decision and to carry out political 
persecution. Elections were only bogus processes to maintain an 
international image. [video shows former National Bank Manager 
Jaime Simmons addressing a meeting] 
  [Simmons, identified by caption] Therefore, I want to 
present 
a serious proposal here, Mr. President -- that we coordinate the 
100,000-odd officials we have on the payroll, with the presence 
of the distinguished TE President Yolanda Pulice de Rodriguez. 
We can also make an adjustment; and we can also weed it out. I 
specifically propose that we send the TE all of the details to 
learn who is most adept and what is the political background of 
all of those who comprise the state's workforce. [video cuts to 
show Pulice de Rodriguez addressing meeting] 
  [Pulice de Rodriguez, identified by caption, in progress] 
...because when I hear Mr. Simmons say the TE will supply him 
with a list in order that he may detect whether his government 
officials are or are not registered in a political party, I say 
it is also worthwhile to state here how the TE fulfills this 
request from a state entity that requires the institution's 
service. It is true we render that service. 
  [Announcer] The TE did not want the public to learn this, 
and 
the president of that organization requested confidentiality 
because this would cause its deteriorated image to sink to even 
greater depths. [video cuts to Pulice de Rodriguez at the same 
meeting] 
  [Pulice de Rodriguez, in progress] ...because it has been 
reported that the TE is behind all of these public employees' 
dismissals, simply because they registered, or have failed to 
register, in a political party. That is not advantageous for 
the TE, much less under the current circumstances. Our 
activity, aside from being juridical and electoral, is 
political. [video cuts to show Former President Manuel Solis 
Palma speaking at a podium] 
  [Manuel Solis Palma, broadcast in progress] ...because I 
will 
leave here to address the closing session of an electoral 
seminar, and I will speak well of the elections there. I cannot 
leave here and say there will be no elections and then go over 
there and speak well of the elections. I cannot continue to 
talk about the advantages of the elections while strategically 
planning to abolish them. 
  [Announcer] The military and civilian dictatorship's regime 
became so thoroughly corrupt that it left us a country in ruins 
and morally destroyed. [video cuts to unidentified labor leader 
seated and addressing a group of people] 
  [Labor leader] In our case, we talk about cement. We can 
supply enough information to prove that legislators, meaning the 
unproductive Legislative Assembly we have been mentioning for 
months, use this mechanism as an additional source of income. 
They accept donations and sell these to stores and clients who 
usually purchase from us in cash. This directly affects the 
state's revenues. [video cuts to Labor Party leader Ramon 
Sieiro Murgas addressing a group of people] 
  [Sieiro Murgas, identified by caption] I ask: If the UNADE 
[National Democratic Union] government accepts at this point -- 
10 months from the elections -- the existence of sinecures, will 
this help us or work against our own interests? I will not 
break down the meaning of sinecure, or cushy job, or phantom job 
at this point in time. [video cuts to show former Legislator 
Luis Gomez addressing a meeting] 
  [Gomez, identified by caption, broadcast in progress] ...he 
revealed legislators have 3,200 sinecures. Let us adopt a 
decision in connection with this, Mr. President. We will demand 
something: Let us discuss the government's final decision on 
this. Either we eliminate all the sinecures -- all of them, 
every one of them, not only the mistresses, if they exist; not 
only the ministers' friends, if they exist; or the legislators' 
mistresses and friends; and, why not say it, with due respect to 
our Defense Forces comrades, the Defense Forces' friends. What 
will be the political decision? When will we adopt the 
political decision to abolish the sinecures? Now! [video cuts 
to show Minena de Duran addressing the same meeting] 
  [Minena de Duran, identified by caption] We can negotiate 
with all of the parties and all of the legislators for a 
reduction of salaries among the sinecures. This way, no one's 
feelings will be hurt. Mr. President, I suggest an evaluation 
commission study all of the cases of sinecures, cushy jobs, and 
phantom jobs -- as our friend here says. Simply put, there 
should be an agreement, Mr. President, because we have 
unfortunately learned it is true there are cushy jobs with a 
salary of $2,000-$3,000. [video cuts to show Solis Palma 
seated, addressing a crowd] 
  [Solis Palma, in progress] ...we will win the elections with 
this. They are quite sure about this, meaning we will win the 
elections with 800 sinecures in each ministry. We will win 
nothing! There are no secrets in this country -- much less at a 
lower level. Everyone knows, meaning every employee knows, that 
they are compelled to make sacrifices while others earn $2,000 
or $3,000 in a sinecure and only show up on payday to collect 
their check. [video cuts to show second unidentified labor 
leader addressing a crowd] 
  [Labor leader] We see corruption is rampant. We see 
corruption continues to spread; and we have protested; and we 
have said this since 1984 -- yet there is no way we can stop 
those things. Leaders who figure prominently for different 
reasons are subject to a persecution while crooks and thieves 
receive awards. [video cuts to show Solis Palma, seated at a 
cabinet meeting] 
  [Solis Palma] People are being told that public employees 
are openly selling diesel, gasoline, tires, spares parts for 
tractors, and so on -- all at very reasonable price. The Public 
Works Ministry employees are constantly going around selling 
diesel, gasoline, oil, tires, spare parts... [audio interrupted 
in mid-sentence] 
  [Announcer] The current administration found the state's 
finances completely depleted, the National Savings Banks and the 
National Bank of Panama [BNP] completely ruined, and the Social 
Security Fund [CSS] virtually looted. [video cuts to show Solis 
Palma speaking at a luncheon] 
  [Solis Palma] When we are told to instruct the National 
Banking Commission to release funding, or told to do this or 
that, we cannot tell them to do this, because the moment they 
release funds, the BNP will collapse. The BNP cannot even 
release 10 percent of its savings accounts and time deposits, 
and the National Savings Bank cannot even release 5 percent of 
its savings accounts. They simply cannot do it. They simply do 
not have sufficient financial resources; then we have to 
continue prolonging... [pauses] because there are banks that do 
have sufficient resources. 
  If we do decide to go through with this, we will be opening 
the door to putting the BNP and the National Savings Bank in a 
very difficult situation. We could order them not to pay, in 
light of the fact that government institutions are not forced to 
pay. But what do you think this will do to the National Savings 
Bank and the BNP's image in the banking community? They will be 
the only two banking institutions who will not be able to pay. 
No one would ever again trust depositing money in the BNP or 
the National Savings Bank. [video cuts to show former BNP 
General Manager Rafael Arosemena addressing a group of people in 
an auditorium] 
  [Arosemena, identified by caption] Considering that this 
session is being recorded, I would like to recommend that any 
reference to the BNP at a given moment should be removed from 
the film, because we are talking about financial soundness, 
liquidity.... [video cuts in mid-sentence to show Ovido Diaz, 
former Revolutionary Democratic Party (PRD) vice president, 
addressing a group at a banquet hall] 
  [Diaz, identified by caption] We are aware that during the 
month of December the budget deficit totaled 800 million 
balboas; furthermore, it has probably increased during these 
past months, and at any moment we will have to confront this 
issue. [video cuts to show Solis Palma, speaking at conference 
table] 
  [Solis Palma] The National Savings Bank also has some areas 
that cannot continue operating. It is not a matter that the 
National Savings Bank has not produced sufficient revenues, it 
is just that the revenues are earmarked specifically to cover 
payrolls. [video cuts to show Rafael Rodriguez, former 
comptroller general and former provisional president of the 
Republic, sitting in a conference room] 
  [Rafael Rodriguez] Unfortunately, we have limited ourselves 
to paying for an oversized bureaucracy instead of attempting to 
do something about it. 
  [Announcer] During the military and civilian dictatorship, 
the candidates were always chosen at military headquarters. The 
best example is the 1984 meeting that took place at the 
Tinajitas Military Barracks. [video cuts to show Ernesto Perez 
Balladares, former minister of planning and PRD member, speaking 
to a group of reporters] 
  [Balladares] I took part in the Tinajitas meeting. 
Unfortunately, I do not have copy of my comments because they 
were unrehearsed. [video cuts to show Nander Pitty Velasquez, 
former comptroller general and presidency minister, addressing a 
cabinet meeting] 
  [Pitty, identified by caption] One of the things we have 
always criticized about the Fortuna hydroelectric dam project, 
and I have always been one of its most severe critics, because 
it is not just now that I am saying this. [sentence as heard] 
As presidential adviser, I continuously complained in writing 
about the continuous modifications the IRHE [Institute of 
Hydraulic Resources and Electrification] began to issue after 
the bid had been tendered. 
  In this respect, a bid was awarded for the construction of a 
project, and later on, modifications were made to the contract 
based on what the IRHE described as changes. These 
modifications began to pile up, and when they had a whole pile 
of them, they would bring them to the cabinet meeting to be 
discussed. The ministers at the time could do nothing but 
approve the modifications because the funds had already been 
spent, and the project had been completed. If the funds had not 
been spent, the project had been completed, and then there was 
the need to pay. [sentence as heard] I do not remember how much 
the project ended up costing. Maybe IRHE Chief Engineer Herrera 
could refresh my memory on how much the original bid amounted to. 
  [Herrera, off camera] Yes, Mr. President, Mr. Minister. The 
initial cost of the project was $252 million, and it ended up 
costing $514 million, all costs and benefits included. 
  [Pitty] Thank you very much. 
  [Herrera] I would like to add that $80 million should be 
attributed to inflation and interest. 
  [Pitty] Right. Now, Mr. President, what could take place in 
the second phase of the Fortuna project is something similar to 
what I have already stated. [video cuts to show Solis Palma, 
seated at the same cabinet meeting] 
  [Solis Palma] What we have here is a rush and a real concern 
to prevent the second phase of the Fortuna project from being 
completed. However, it is being said that it should have been 
completed four years ago, and that nearly $2 million are lost 
every month because the project has not been completed. In this 
respect, we are now speaking of $96 million that has been lost 
over the past four years. In spite of this, the two ministers 
responsible for this project have never said anything about the 
issue. 
  [Announcer] The military and civilian dictatorship would 
normally divide the government just like a cake. [video cuts to 
show former provisional President Francisco Rodriguez, 
addressing a cabinet meeting] 
  [Rodriguez] There is enough for all of us. This cake is so 
big that everyone... [video cuts in mid-sentence to show Romulo 
Escobar Bethancourt, former president of the PRD National 
Executive Committee, seated in a conference room] 
  [Escobar, identified by caption] Then it should be the party 
that recommends the person or persons to occupy the positions. 
All of the parties that [word indistinct] must be integrated in 
the high-ranking positions. [video cuts to show Pulice de 
Rodriguez seated in a conference room, addressing a crowd] 
  [Pulice de Rodriguez] We must all support our president. 
[video cuts to show former General Manuel Antonio Noriega, 
standing, addressing a group of legislators in an auditorium] 
  [Noriega] We all came to power united, and we must unite to 
accomplish a purpose. From this position, which is built on the 
power of the people, no one will remove us. In addition, we 
will never allow any of our officials to be substituted, 
replaced, or driven out. We cannot allow ourselves the luxury 
to cry tomorrow for those things we were unable to defend today. 
[video cuts to show Ovidio Diaz addressing a group of people] 
  [Diaz] The least a government in power should do is to do 
all 
it can to remain in office. That is something we heard Gen. 
Torrijos say, and I share his views. [video cuts to show Nander 
Pitty speaking at a cabinet meeting] 
  [Pitty] Our unforgettable Omar Torrijos used to say that the 
duty of every government is to make sure it is not overthrown. 
The first duty of every ruler is to make sure he is not 
overthrown, and this is what we must do. 
  [Announcer] The civilian and military dictatorship raised 
manipulation and deceit to unbelievable levels. Workers and 
government workers were told one thing, while another was being 
planned behind their backs. The people were told of a 
nationalist struggle, but in actuality this was only an 
instrument to hide the real purpose. [video shows Tomas Gabriel 
Altamirano Duque addressing a crowd] 
  [Altamirano Duque, identified by caption] Unfortunately, if 
there is no money, you cannot take part in politics. And there 
is no money. All we have left is to exploit nationalism as much 
as we can, because this is another way of getting into politics 
-- not only against the United States, but against all those who 
are trying to finish off this government. When money is not 
used, then nationalism must be used. I believe we are doing 
pretty well. [video cuts to show Daniel Delgado, lieutenant 
colonel in the former Panamanian Defense Forces, speaking at a 
podium] 
  [Delgado, identified by caption] From the foreign point of 
view, this problem is seen as a demagogic problem. To put it 
simply, Panama is trying to overcome the real problems of lack 
of democracy, lack of human rights, drug trafficking, and 
corruption. That is the problem. 
  [Announcer] Labor leaders were also manipulated. [video cuts 
to show Solis Palma, seated between two unidentified men, 
addressing a group] 
  [Solis Palma] We have a man like Mauro Murillo [general 
secretary of the National Organization of Panamanian Workers], 
who is a man of great quality, and who handles matters with 
great ability, but who cannot overstep himself because we will 
burn him. We will destroy him, and this would be very dangerous. 
It would be dangerous to destroy our leaders who manipulate 
problems for us. We cannot burn Hector Aleman [secretary 
general of the National Federation of Associations of Public 
Employees]. He is trying to navigate in very choppy waters. 
What we must do is provide him with a good boat that will not 
sink. 
  We cannot allow the National Port Authorities to pay out 
$341,000 in 13th month bonuses during the first two weeks of the 
month. How can we do that? There is no ceiling on payments. 
In addition, in December we would have to pay them $867,000, 
because they have additional Christmas bonuses. The National 
Casino workers must be paid $188,000 right now and in December 
we must pay them $548,000. But the worst one is the IRHE. Right 
now we must give them $1.355 million. For them, there is no 
ceiling. And in December we must give them $4.088 million. 
  [Unidentified speaker, off camera] As well as free 
electricity. 
  [Solis Palma] Plus electricity, twilight [media luz], and 
all 
of that. 
  INTEL [National Institute of Telecommunications] would 
receive $759,000 with no ceiling. With a ceiling, it would be 
much lower. In December they would receive $2.173 million. Then 
we have the National Beneficent Lottery. That did not come from 
the Canal Zone. That was established by Fito [Tomas Gabriel 
Altamirano Duque] before he was born. [laughter] 
  [Unidentified speaker] Do not look away. [laughter] 
  [Solis Palma] The National Beneficent Lottery came even 
before that. He was not even involved in the planning stages. 
[laughter] The lottery receives $259,000. I do not know if the 
lottery has a ceiling or not. The next bonus is in the amount 
of $792,000. There is a difference of $5 million in 13th month 
bonuses among those institutions. All of this must be 
confronted sooner or later, because we cannot continue with 
those privileges, with those great disparities we are 
experiencing. It is time we begin looking to the future. The 
biggest mistake we made, and we were forced to make it, was to 
make the first payment of the 13th month bonus. [video cuts to 
show Sieiro Murgas seated and addressing a group] 
  [Sieiro Murgas] It is true that I have said that in 1983 
there was talk of reducing the government payroll. This was to 
pay off the foreign debt. Fine, now we have adopted some 
measures. [video cuts to show PRD legislator Mario Rognoni 
addressing a group] 
  [Rognoni] In that first phase, there is something that is 
even more delicate. It comprises the enemies of the state -- 
the seditious ones who remain inside the institutions. 
Nevertheless, this is a bit more difficult to do than what 
Simmons has proposed. What we must first do is pinpoint them, 
open a file on them, and, based on this, have them removed 
according to the guidelines of each institution. 
  I suggest that in the first phase of this plan we divide the 
government into three areas: those that have to reduce their 
payroll by 8 percent, those that have to reduce their payroll by 
12 percent, and those that have to reduce their payroll by 16 
percent. [video cuts to show former PRD legislator Rigoberto 
Paredes addressing a crowd] 
  [Paredes, identified by caption] The politicians, those who 
should know how to handle this politically and properly, kept 
thinking of protection, of friends, and of the support of this 
or that colonel. They stepped back to let us know that we had 
to learn to live like men and women who can handle themselves 
and run this as it should be run. 
  [Announcer] The state ministers themselves rendered reports 
to the Defense Forces of the Republic of Panama [FDP] rather 
than to the president himself. [video cuts to show Solis Palma 
being interviewed by an unidentified reporter] 
  [Reporter] Are you talking about today? 
  [Solis Palma] Yes, the ambassadors many times call on the 
commander. They do not call on the president to give their 
reports, because it had been like that... 
  [Reporter, interrupting] It has been the established rule... 
  [Solis Palma, interrupting] It has been the rule during the 
past 20 years, or 18 years. It is the FDP itself that gives the 
instructions to call the Presidency. [video cuts to show 
Targidio Bernal, former deputy government and justice minister, 
speaking at a meeting] 
  [Bernal, identified by caption] We have gotten used to not 
acting -- not acting as civilians, and not acting as a civilian 
government, thereby leaving the responsibility to the FDP. We 
have not understood two things: The more the FDP acts, the more 
its image, its prestige, and so on wastes away. The other thing 
is that they could tire of us, because what we did yesterday, by 
the way, was a blitzkrieg. I think that in six hours we changed 
two presidents with one crushing blow to the balls [un solo 
huevazo] [words indistinct]. This has never occurred in our 
nation's history. [video cuts to show Jose Young, not further 
identified, addressing a crowd] 
  [Young, identified by caption] There is general discontent 
in 
the public workers sector because of the reduction in salaries, 
particularly among teachers and professors. [video cuts to show 
closeup of Solis Palma] 
  [Solis Palma] General Noriega is a drug trafficker. He is a 
man that should be ousted from the country, he is a dictator, 
and he is opposed to democracy. [video cuts to another closeup 
of Solis Palma] 
  Air Panama employees have accepted that a large number of 
their personnel must be dismissed, because even if we operate 
with two airplanes, we have to fire people, and even if we 
operate with three airplanes, we have to fire people. The 
Social Security Fund must continue employing 14,000-15,000 
workers. The casinos must continue with the number of workers 
on their payroll. The Digedecom [General Directorate for 
Community Development] has to continue with the number of 
workers it has. Commander Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, Latin 
American leader and idol of Panama -- the general commands and 
the president obeys. [video cuts to show Solis Palma 
addressing large political rally] 
  In Japan, to talk about Alfonsin [former president of 
Argentina] -- well, very few Japanese know who Alfonsin is. 
Nevertheless, I do not believe there is one Japanese citizen who 
does not know who Manuel Antonio Noriega is. [applause] 
Certainly, we all know who he is. [video cuts to show Francisco 
Rodriguez speaking to a group of people] 
  [Rodriguez] Public servants are appointed to institutions 
where they do not work. Some work in other places, while others 
do not work anywhere. [video cuts to show Solis Palma addressing 
a meeting] 
  [Solis Palma] All of those who carry PRD cards are 
interested 
in being promoted, but they are not interested in defending the 
movement. This situation must be brought out into the open 
before the party. It is the party leaders themselves who come 
out and say to us: He is one of our men, he has his party card, 
help him, give him a push. But then, we fail to receive support 
form these individuals when such support is needed. 
  [Announcer] The military and civilian dictatorship employed 
the extreme measure of setting up a regime that was communist in 
nature. [video cuts to show Solis Palma speaking to a crowd] 
  [Solis Palma] When someone says, I have the money, the 
answer 
is, you do not have anything, because here, no one owns 
anything. Everything belongs to the Panamanian state; it belongs 
to the government. [break in video] We cannot rule out the 
possibility of our own currency. 
  [Announcer] The Panamanian people and their true civilian 
leaders were repressed by way of violence. The rights of the 
citizens were violated, and the free press was shut down. There 
was chaos, violence, and desolation. [video cuts to show Rodolfo 
Chiari de Leon, former government minister, seated and speaking 
at a meeting] 
  [Chiari de Leon] In light of this, we have proceeded to 
appoint censors to LA PRENSA, QUIBO, EXTRA, and EL SIGLO. These 
are the dailies that have been attacking the government most. 
[video cuts to show Manuel Noriega speaking to a group] 
  [Noriega] Those people who are under arrest -- we should 
not be alarmed about this. This was necessary. It was 
necessary to undo the prevailing impasse. Currently we have... 
[pauses] we still have approximately 120 individuals under 
arrest. We are placing them under the jurisdiction of the 
administration. Measures were taken to ensure that it would not 
be said that they were stripped naked. Measures were taken so 
that a priest and a doctor were present, as well as a 
high-ranking officer to check all of this and to check those who 
pretend to have a heart condition after being arrested. 
[laughter] [video cuts to show civilians being beaten by members 
of the FPD; video cuts to show former President Eric Arturo 
Delvalle addressing a crowd] 
  [Arturo Delvalle] I agree with General Noriega that the 
groups must be maintained. I would like to reactivate the 
command. I am going to talk to Commander Solis Palma, the 
civilian commander, to reactivate it. [video cuts to show 
Manuel Noriega addressing a crowd] 
  [Noriega] One territory, one flag, and not one step 
backward, 
damn it! [shouts of approval heard among crowd, applause] 
[video cuts to show an unidentified female Dignity Battalion 
member speaking at a podium] 
  [Dignity Battalion member] We have shown the world the 
stamina, the bravery, and the courage of Panamanian women who 
have voluntarily enrolled in the Dignity Battalions and have 
brandished for the first time a T-65 or an M-16. [applause] You 
may rest assured that in the event that our national integrity 
and sovereignty requires it, these [two-second break in audio] 
in the hands of our women, will do what is necessary. [Video 
cuts to show Dayra de Carrizo, wife of Legislative Assembly 
President Celso Carrizo, speaking at a podium] 
  [Dayra de Carrizo, identified by caption] Panama has one 
single territory and one single flag. Not one single step 
backward! Not one single step backward! [applause] [video cuts 
to show medium shot of Manuel Noriega speaking at an outdoor 
podium prior to a military parade] 
  [Noriega] Welcome Messrs. representatives of political 
parties, PALA [Labor Party], Republican Party, and PRD. For the 
first time in the Republic's history, soldiers representing our 
Armed Forces are marching alongside the Dignity Battalions -- in 
other words, the people who bear arms in order to survive. 
[applause; crowd chants: "Not one step backward!"] 
  We have armed the people, and these arms will no longer be 
taken away, because they belong to the people! So, you can just 
forget about Noriega. Perhaps Noriega is the nicest person out 
of all of those still to come. If you do not believe me, just 
ask [Major Jose Heraclides] Trujillo or [Lieutenant Colonel 
Luis] Cordoba. In turn, it is preferable that you put up with 
Noriega. 
  The Defense Forces have said not a single step backward. The 
Dignity Battalions have said not a single step backward. In the 
name of the people who are looking ahead with courage, this 
Panamanian commander repeats from this podium what is already 
our doctrine, our principle, and our prayer: Not one single 
step backward! [applause; crowd chants: "Not one single step 
backward!"] [video cut shows several short recordings without 
audio of Noriega at various speaking engagements, people being 
beaten by riot police; video returns to Noriega at podium, 
military parade getting under way; video cuts to show man being 
beaten by Dignity Battalion members, and, as he lies on the 
ground, a voice off camera says: "Tell Endara to take care of 
you. Tell Endara to treat you. Listen to me carefully. I love 
this country. I do love this country. I am not a traitor. 
Tell Endara and Ford to treat your wounds"; video concludes by 
showing a 1989 still photo of a bloody Guillermo Endara after he 
was beaten by Dignity Battalion members after the 1989 elections]

<F P=106> [Statement by Ernesto Perez Balladares, presidential </F>
candidate of the Democratic Revolutionary Party, PRD, following 
President Guillermo Endara's message to the nation, at the 
Riande Continental Hotel in Panama City--live relay] 
  [Text] [Crowd chants: "Toro, Toro, Toro"] Thank you. 
  Fellow countrymen: Please excuse my voice. I was in Pacora 
and had scheduled a news conference because I thought the 
president of the Republic was going to make an announcement that 
would be very important for the nation. 
  I will confess, quite honestly, that I feel truly 
embarrassed. It embarrasses me to see a man go back on his word, 
especially when that man represents the majesty of the homeland, 
a man who, before the diplomatic corps and the whole nation, 
signed this document which he now seems to have forgotten. It 
is a document which, among other things, states--Mr. President, 
please allow me to remind you of it--: We cannot use our 
authority and influence to serve the interests of those who are 
running for office. The president did not keep his word. The 
president has involved himself in party politics. I would like 
to say this does not mean we will change the tone of our 
national proposal. [applause] 
  Under no circumstances will we be provoked by this 
despicable 
intervention in party politics by the head of the Panamanian 
state. I now call on my supporters, friends, and fellow party 
members to remain calm and maintain peace following this brief 
period of instability that Mr. Endara's words have created. 
  I would like to reiterate what I have said in the past: No 
one, and at no time, can think of returning to those days of 
improvised presidents, economic sanctions, and of suffering for 
all Panamanians. [applause] 
  We want to begin the 21st century with a new concept of 
homeland, with a united Panama, with our political differences 
discussed as the democratic nations do, without intervention 
from governments, with our own autonomy, our proposals for 
solutions to the country's problems. 
  Fellow countrymen, after we win on 8 May we will celebrate, 
without revenge, and without looking back to the past, not even 
to this day. We will introduce what must be a government of 
reconciliation for which most Panamanians are hoping. [applause] 
  In conclusion, I hope this will be an isolated incident, 
that 
we will maintain the dignity of the office the Panamanian people 
gave us. Mr. President Endara, do not shame the people again 
by not keeping your word. [applause] [crowd chants: "Toro, 
Toro, Toro"]

  [Text] The National Executive Committee of the Democratic 
Revolutionary Party [PRD] charged today it has received reports, 
which they have described as reliable, that after President 
Guillermo Endara speaks tonight people who will pretend to be 
PRD supporters will execute acts of violence to create chaos in 
the country. A PRD communique stresses these actions are aimed 
at suspending the 8 May elections. In light of the situation, 
the PRD National Executive Committee calls on its supporters to 
respect the Constitution, the electoral law, and the Santa Maria 
Commitment and not allow themselves to be provoked.

<F P=106> [Interview with Mireya Moscoso de Gruber, Arnulfist Party </F>
presidential candidate, with unidentified reporters outside a 
restaurant in Panama City on 14 April; live or 
recorded--broadcast in progress] 
  [Text] [Reporter] ...in a national network? 
  [Gruber] Look, I share the president's concern this evening 
after seeing the video clips. The video clips show us part of 
our history, part of the past, and we, who suffered that past, 
have relived it this evening; therefore, we have recalled what 
the PRD [Democratic Revolutionary Party] was. 
  [Reporter] Opposition groups claim he did this to support 
your candidacy. What is your comment? 
  [Gruber] I do not think this was done to support my 
candidacy. This president has shown this video clip to the 
country as evidence of his concern for what may happen on 8 May. 
I do not think it was done to help me. 
  [Reporter] Isn't the president taking sides with a party and 
violating the Constitution with this? 
  [Gruber] No, he is not. 
  [Reporter] Nevertheless, Ernesto Toro Perez Balladares has 
said this is negative and that President Endara is violating the 
Santa Maria la Antigua Commitment by doing this. 
  [Gruber] I do not think the president has violated the 
Constitution or the Justice and Peace Commission Pact. He has 
only shown part of our history. We cannot deny this is part of 
our history. There are many people who want to forget it, but 
it is there, and we have seen it tonight. 
  [Reporter] Certain groups want to know why it was done now. 
  [Gruber] Perhaps he was concerned about what is taking place 
in the country. He said it this evening; he is concerned, 
perhaps due to so many attacks against him. He wanted to show 
the country part of Panama's history. 
  [Reporter] Is this a strategy to achieve unity of the 
civilist forces? 
  [Gruber] Look, we have been issuing appeals for unity since 
December. We again issued appeals in January, February, and 
March. I do not think this will help much concerning unity. I 
hope it does, but I doubt it. 
  [Reporter] Do you think this will change the Panamanian 
people's mind so they vote for [words indistinct]? 
  [Gruber] Please. I think.... [pauses] Panama lived under a 
dictatorship for 21 years. The Panamanian people remembered it 
this evening when they saw the video clips. It will definitely 
change their minds.

<F P=106> [Report by RPC reporter Leo Alvarado on interview with Ruben </F>
Dario Carles, Cha;nge '94 Alliance presidential candidate, at a 
hotel in Chitre, Herrera Province, on 14 April-- recorded] 
  [Text] [Alvarado] After listening to the statement made by 
the president of the Republic via radio and television networks 
and watching the video, we came to the hotel in Chitre where 
Ruben Dario Carles, his working group, and a group of followers 
were meeting. Carles will be touring Chitre and Herrera Province 
tomorrow. After the networks ended, we asked presidential 
candidate Carles for his views on tonight's network. 
  [Begin recording] [Carles] What can I say. It was the first 
time I saw it, and I am flabbergasted [words indistinct]. 
  [Alvarado] Do you believe this is a political strategy by 
President Endara? 
  [Carles] I am telling you [words indistinct]. 
  [Alvarado] Do you think there should be an agreement.... 
  [Carles, interrupting] Damn it, didn't you hear me? [end 
recording] 
  [Alvarado] That was all Mr. Ruben Dario Carles told RPC 
Radio. We were shoved and pushed by Carles' bodyguards, who did 
not allow us to complete our job at the hotel; we had to leave 
the hotel. They did not let anyone else in. Mr. Carles remained 
sitting and meditating on a sofa. We were able to see tears 
running down his cheeks. We must stress, however, how poorly 
they are treating the members of the press who are trying to 
interview Carles, who is here in Chitre. If there is a question 
you would like to ask, please do. 
  [Unidentified announcer] You said there were tears in 
Carles' 
eyes. Why? Is there any reason for this? 
  [Alvarado] We were not allowed to do our job. Mr. Carles 
seemed to be angry after watching, on television, Mr. Endara's 
presentation. Mr. Carles was unable to answer our questions. 
We also saw other reporters try to interview him, but they were 
also turned away. We do not know if the tears and anger are the 
result of what he saw on television, or whether he felt 
something else against the president for showing this via a 
national network.

<F P=106> [News conference by Eduardo Vallarino, presidential </F>
candidate of the Christian Democratic Party, PDC, with 
unidentified reporters following President Guillermo Endara's 
message; from PDC headquarters in Panama City--live relay] 
  [Text] [Vallarino] I would like to be brief. I believe 
every Panamanian is sadder now than he was an hour ago. We have 
relived our past, scenes of our past. Our party was a main 
player in the struggle against the dictatorship and paid dearly 
for this in lives and material losses. This reminds the 
Panamanian people, however, that we must remember the past and 
avoid the mistakes made in the past and avoid returning to the 
past. 
  Today, I would like to invite the Panamanian people to look 
forward. I would like to call on all the candidates to set 
their sights on the future. In the hopes of doing this, I made 
a friendly call in good faith to all the presidential candidates 
to join us and enter into a pact with the people to ensure a 
better future for all Panamanians and to assure us we will not 
return to those days of which we were reminded on television 
this evening. 
  [Reporter] How would you describe the [words indistinct] 
president of the Republic? 
  [Vallarino] This was simply a little sample of what happened 
in the past 22 years. This was something most Panamanians did 
not experience, because they were too young. Today's voters do 
not really know what happened between 1968 and 1989, when the 
dictatorship ended. Knowing our history is very important and 
this is part of our history. As I said earlier, it hurts to 
remember, but we must remember it. Just as I say it hurts to 
remember I also say it is necessary to look to the future. We 
must propose and present a better future to the Panamanian 
people. We can do this together. Once again I call on all 
civilians throughout the country, especially the presidential 
candidates, to join in a great crusade for the good of Panama. 
  [Reporter] What political effect will this have only three 
weeks before the elections? 
  [Vallarino] I do believe this will have a political effect. 
There are too many people who for one reason or another forget 
too quickly. There are others who knew nothing of this. This 
will help the Panamanian people do what they must do; that is, 
remember that voting is a serious thing and that our future and 
our children's future depends on this election. Let's not make 
another mistake. Let's look to the future with optimism, and 
let's remember the past carefully.

<F P=106> ["Voting '94/Youth '94" program featuring a debate among </F>
Panamanian vice presidential candidates Fernando Manfredo of the 
Papa Egoro Movement, David Guerra of the National Consensus 
Alliance, Arnulfo Escalona of the Arnulfist Party, Guillermo 
Quijano of the Change '94 coalition, and Raul Ossa of the 
Christian Democratic Party; moderated by Ricardo Samaniego; at 
the El Panama Hotel in Panama City -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Samaniego] Good evening, viewers, and welcome 
to "Youth '94." Tonight we are coming to you live from the El 
Panama Hotel where Public Administration students are holding a 
seminar on today's political outlook. [passage omitted] We are 
going to begin by asking questions on a very current event -- 
namely, President Endara's nationally broadcast message, after 
which he showed the Panamanian people a video. Our first 
speaker will be Fernando Manfredo. 
  [Manfredo] I have just recalled one of the darkest chapters 
in our country's history. God willing, it will never repeat 
itself. What I question is whether it was appropriate for the 
president of the Republic to introduce this subject at this 
moment in the campaign. It would seem appropriate for a 
political party or a judicial branch official to present this 
type of material. Nevertheless, I personally believe that it was 
improper for the president to present this at a time when he 
should be showing total impartiality in the electoral process. 
  [Samaniego] Mr. Guerra, what is your opinion? 
  [Guerra] Over and over again, we have been hammering the 
point that we must not forget the past, especially at this time 
when we are about to choose our leaders for the next five years. 
I believe that advertising portrays everything as if it were 
new. This video forces us to remember that much can be said on 
the screen and on the radio, and that many things can be written 
on pieces of paper. 
  However, the Panamanian people must recall the past in a 
healthy manner to be able to decide the future. Your actions 
tomorrow will depend on what you have in your heart. I believe 
that what you have in your heart does not change from one day to 
the next, and much less when the main actors in your memory are 
still active in today's politics. It scares me to hear a 
current vice presidential candidate talking about how well he is 
doing in some business venture. It is important for the 
Panamanian people to remember all of this. However, the people 
must not only remember what was done by the the PRD [Democratic 
Revolutionary Party] or the military government. The people 
must also choose well. Today, we have seven presidential 
tickets, and it is important that we use this example to choose 
conscientiously. 
  [Samaniego] Dr. Escalona, your views? 
  [Escalona] With pleasure. This evening, I was forced to 
relive something that deep down we all knew, but something that 
we had never seen in action. We knew what was happening to us 
in the streets. We were afraid to go out, and we were afraid to 
let our children out because we feared they would never return. 
However, we did not know of the cynicism we saw tonight on 
television. We did not know how they handled their affairs. 
  You, young students, today more than ever I wish I were in 
your seats and not where I am sitting. But that is life. When 
I was a student, I wanted to be here. Today, however, I wish I 
could relive my life in this country without the things we are 
recalling today. I wish I were a student in order that I could 
live life to the fullest, as one lives when he is young. 
  I recall that when I was a student we had to read Plato. We 
had to read Plato's dialogues, and what caught my attention was 
when he wrote that the greatest virtue a ruler could have was 
the quality of being fair. None of those men has the slightest 
idea of what being fair is all about, and yet, we allowed them 
to stay on after a coup d'etat and cause all of those problems. 
  Now we are confronted by a paradox: They are aspiring to 
reach power by way of the ballot box. This generation and 
future generations will be condemned if we allow those people to 
hold any type of government in this country. They do not 
deserve the chance to repeat their past actions, much less with 
the blessing of the vote in the 8 May elections. 
  My skin burns. I find myself going out of my mind at times 
like this when I have to admit that there are Panamanians who do 
not deserve to be called brothers. Those blows we saw them give 
the Panamanian people were meted out to defend the atrocities 
they were cooking up and feeling proud about. You saw in that 
video how proud they felt about what they did. Do not let this 
happen again in our country. Thank you. 
  [Samaniego] Mr. Quijano, vice presidential candidate for 
the Change '94 coalition. 
  [Quijano] Poet Ricardo Miro wrote a famous phrase: I look 
back and at times it scares me. I am scared for the young 
people. I am scared that terror and fear will be enthroned 
again in Panama. It scares me that we could be robbed of our 
democracy, justice, and freedom. 
  Nevertheless, it was not just one term in office or the last 
term in office. It was 21 years of atrocities in this country. 
Residents of Chiriqui Province died in 1969 while struggling for 
democracy. The atrocities against human rights and the people's 
rights began on 11 October 1968, not June 1987. Many of you 
here tonight were not around in 1968; some of you were very 
young. That was when the disregard for human rights, freedom of 
expression, and freedom of action began. 
  Debates such as this one, where government and opposition 
candidates can present their views and defend their principles, 
would not have been possible during those 25 years. It would 
not have been possible for youths and adults, like those of you 
here tonight, to ask questions and for us to answer them without 
fear that a military boot would be waiting outside, or that we 
would be thrown in jail or get kicked out of the country. All 
that began in 1968 and ended in December 1989. 
  We must defend the principles of democracy, justice, and 
liberty, and young Panamanians, who represent the majority in 
these elections, must choose the best, most capable, most honest 
people -- those people who feel love for the homeland. Young 
Panamanian people, it is up to you to choose the best. 
  [Samaniego] Messrs. candidates, a controversy has arisen 
with 
the presentation of these music videos [as heard] by President 
Endara and the expectation that this created. Some wonder: 
Should President Endara have made this presentation rather than 
other politicians? What is your opinion about this? 
  [Quijano] Look, I believe the president should not have 
caused seven or eight days of anxiety to present this video 
along with his personal opinion. However, I could care less 
whether or not he presented these video clips. I believe it is 
advisable for Panama to know the truth rather than hiding the 
truth about what happened. Dr. Escalona said this here, and I 
was at Santa Ana Square on 10 May when those Dignity Battalion 
members attacked President Endara, Ford, Ricardo Arias Calderon, 
and myself. They ganged up on us and beat us with cudgels while 
the Panamanian Guard or Army looked on. 
  I certainly believe it is advisable to present the truth. 
The truth is never bad. The truth will always prevail -- 
sooner or later. This is not an appeal for violence. This is 
an appeal for harmony; it is an appeal for justice. We must 
recognize our sins in Panama and strive to rebuild our country. 
Let us defend our democracy, justice, and liberty. Let us look 
toward the future with optimism and greatness, because this is a 
great country and what we need is to be united and to define 
programs to resolve Panama's obvious problems, meaning poverty, 
unemployment, and corruption. 
  [Samaniego] Thank you. Dear viewers, we will now hear the 
opinions and questions from some of the young people who 
accompany us tonight on "Youth '94." 
  [Unidentified student] Thank you. To begin with, I have an 
opinion about what we have just seen. I believe politicians are 
always talking, but the situation is different for our people. 
I think the people hoped these elections were the beginning of 
a work program by all political groups, right? This is where my 
question comes in: What would be the Justice and Peace 
Commission's role after listening to these videocassettes? The 
question is for all of the candidates. 
  [Samaniego] Dr. Manfredo, can we start with you? 
  [Manfredo] I would rather have one of my comrades go first. 
  [Samaniego] Dr. Escalona? 
  [Escalona] With pleasure. The Justice and Peace Commission's 
role, until now, has been to prevent violence. It has been 
approached by those of us who are known as politicians, but you 
must remember that we are all politicians. Man is a political 
animal. Plato has described man, and I repeat this, as a 
political animal because we all carry the old city in our 
hearts. The old city is the homeland. We all have the homeland 
in our hearts, and therefore, if we talk about the homeland, we 
talk about politics. 
  Consequently, the expression that you, the politicians, and 
we -- namely, the ones who are not politicians -- is a form of 
participating in politics. [sentence as heard] I do not 
believe in those things. I believe all citizens are politicians 
and each occupies his place, whether on a larger or smaller 
scale, according to his activities and according to the position 
he wants to occupy in the future. He does this to fulfill his 
political role within the city or within the (?country). This 
compels us to establish the appropriate norms for a better 
lifestyle. 
  Referring to the question, it is very specific. Should the 
president of the Republic have presented these videotapes? Yes, 
a thousand times yes; and again, I refer to my knowledge about 
humans. This is part of the Republic's history. This cannot be 
denied; we have lived through this; this is part of our 
heritage. We should not hide this, because, for better or 
worse, it is the history of the Republic, and it should be 
brought out in the open. Whoever does not want to learn from 
history is bound to make the same mistakes because history helps 
inspire us and prevent us from falling for the same causes and 
under the same conditions. 
  Consequently, I believe that, if the president of the 
Republic learned about these videotapes, he did the right thing 
when he presented them to the Panamanian people. This is our 
history, and we cannot forget it because this is what happened. 
It is all there, and it should not only be revealed but also 
repeated so that all the Panamanians may know we lived those 
years under these harsh and difficult conditions. Those years 
cannot be repeated if we truly want to forge ahead. 
  [Samaniego] Thank you, Dr. Escalona. We have another 
question from the young people in attendance. 
  [Unidentified student] I want to know if it does the 
country any good for the president to have released the 
videotape to the public on the verge of elections, when he had 
four years of government to do so. 
  [Samaniego] Mr. Manfredo. 
  [Manfredo] In fact, that is my question: Why now? I am not 
questioning whether citizens should be informed of the inner 
goings-on of the Noriega government, the Noriega regime. The 
question I ask myself is this: If this has been available for 
some time, why release it now? This raises a series of doubts 
and suspicions regarding the president's impartiality. 
  [Samaniego] Engineer Guerra, do you have any response to 
this 
question? 
  [Guerra] Yes. I believe the president's assertion that he 
has had this information for just a couple of days, which 
perhaps some citizens may doubt now. Regardless of this, I 
believe that the information had to be released. Why? Because 
the impression given is that everything is fine, everything is 
normal, and this is not the case. I believe that, in fact, this 
video shows what the true intention is of the party that 
currently heads the polls and where are we headed. I believe we 
need to be very careful. 
  [Samaniego] Dr. Escalona. 
  [Escalona] Precisely, the student's question focuses on 
timing. He asks whether the time is right for the president to 
have presented this video. Each man's actions are his own 
responsibility. This is a private action by the civilian 
president of the Republic, who has explained very well that when 
he received these videocassettes he had to make a decision. At 
this time he had to make this decision. I must confess, young 
student, that I feel very satisfied of having learned about this 
video at the right time. I am very grateful that it was shown to 
me at this time, because I was able to see how the octopus 
worked from inside. I only knew of the actions from the outside 
-- actions that denied my son's freedom, actions that struck me 
in the street, actions that broke my car's windshield, actions 
that endangered the very existence of all citizens. What I did 
not know was the cynicism that these videocassettes show. It is 
well worth knowing this. How a $52 million dam was turned into 
a money scandal, solely and exclusively to keep the octopus 
going. Many thanks. 
  [Samaniego] Engineer Quijano. 
  [Quijano] I must accept the president's word that he knew 
about this video only a few days ago. He made the decision, and 
it was his very own decision. Regarding public affairs, I 
believe each man's or each women's private life is indeed 
private; however, the public life of the public official is 
public. The public life of the public man -- I was a minister 
for two and one-half years -- should be an open book that 
enables citizens to read it, investigate it, and analyze it. 
  [Quijano] All of us adults here experienced the 
dictatorship. We knew what was happening in the streets. What 
we never imagined was the extent of the manipulation taking 
place within the Presidency, how they played with the figures, 
how they manipulated the number of votes, how they would play 
around with the people's wellbeing. 
  There was even mention of specific names of individuals and 
union leaders who dared to say if the president of the Republic 
does not behave, he would be taught a lesson. That means many 
things, such as an indifference to the individuals' self-esteem. 
In this respect, I do believe it should have been said when he 
said he had first found out about the videos. 
  [Samaniego] Thank you, Mr., Quijano. Another question from 
the young voters. 
  [Unidentified student] I am a student at El Istmo 
University. We have just seen what was broadcast via television, 
and we all agree we should never return to that past. My 
question is, considering the results of the public opinion polls 
and the PRD's approval rating, would you all be willing to unite 
and form a common front, divorced of all selfishness in order to 
reach the Presidency? 
  [Quijano] I believe your question is quite valid. I believe 
the groups which support civilian rule in Panama represent an 
absolute majority compared to the militarists; these are the two 
trends now. My personal opinion is that we pro-civilian rule 
supporters must set aside our political ambitions to ensure a 
solid unity which will benefit the lower income groups. The 
young man here just pointed out all of this is in the past. 
That is correct; it is the past. 
  The people want solutions to their problems, concrete 
programs that will resolve issues such as education, health, 
public services, and employment. The people do not want 
programs that are a mere demagoguery. The people want real and 
effective programs. I believe we must set aside our personal 
and political ambitions if we expect to ensure unity and thus 
forge ahead. 
  [Samaniego] Mr. Manfredo, would you like to say something? 
  [Manfredo] I believe the opportunity was lost when the 
political parties--instead of attempting to ensure some degree 
of unity against a situation such as the one you mentioned or 
some unity in preparing a program--gave a sorry spectacle of 
political parties by splitting up the booty. Alliances were 
made based on who would get the Presidency, the vice presidency, 
ministries, autonomous agencies, embassies, and so forth. That 
merely resulted in totally discrediting the political groups 
that became involved in these negotiations. That is why our 
party decided to remain on the sidelines, because we were 
unwilling to get into that game of monopoly; in other words, I 
will give you a vice presidency if you give me two ministries. 
I will give you two ministries, and you give me an embassy. 
  [Samaniego] Mr. Escalona, as part of the government 
alliance, 
you participated in some of these negotiations. Was that the 
way things were done? 
  [Escalona] I can sincerely say only someone who ignores 
Panama's political situation can speak in such a way. Such a 
person has no idea whatsoever of how alliances were made. 
Alliances are over and above that minuscule world which only an 
imagination such as yours can think up. Alliances were not 
established for those reasons. 
  I would like to state the following. On two occasions 
presidential candidate Mireya Moscoso de Gruber has cited the 
need for the groups which support civilian rule to unite. We 
have not received any similar reply from other parties to this 
same call. We made this call on two occasions. Our party does 
not want to give those people we just saw on the video another 
opportunity for them to repeat another dark period in this 
country's history. Just look at what they intend to do. They 
just want to return to repeat everything over again. This is 
the only thing Toro [PRD presidential candidate Ernesto Perez 
Balladares] can promise that group which will ensure their 
return to power. There will be no other opportunity. They plan 
to repeat everything over again. Thank you very much. 
  [Samaniego] Mr. Guerra? 
  [Guerra] Thank you. I must disagree with Fernando Manfredo 
with respect to the manner in which the alliances were 
negotiated. First of all, I was able to witness the many times 
we attempted to ally or find some agreement with the members of 
the Papa Egoro Movement [MPE]. They always said they wanted to 
go out on their own, that they were different. In this respect, 
the search for unity was never their objective. They simply 
believed that they are holders of an absolute truth, and in this 
respect we disagreed. 
  The other inaccuracy being disseminated here is that 
everyone 
is conducting himself as if Toro Balladares is already the 
winner. Allow me to say that in the two previous elections, the 
same polls also conceded up to 35 percentage points to the 
government. The end result was quite different, because they 
had to resort to election fraud and the cancellation of the 
election in order to win. The only thing I can say to the 
Panamanian people is, first of all, those of you who were 
planning to vote for the PRD, for one moment just think about 
what you just saw. Cast your vote according to your conscience. 
Those of you who are allowing yourselves to be influenced by 
the polls, simply vote according to your conscience on 8 May and 
elect a different government. 
  [Samaniego] We will continue with another question. 
  [Quijano] I believe Mr. Manfredo made some comments with 
respect to divvying up the cake. I believe that we were all 
able to see in this video who were the ones dividing up the 
cake, and we could see this through the words of those 
government officials in office at the time. However, according 
to their own statements, they started to divide the cake as far 
back as 1968 and continued to do so until 1989. From 1968 to 
1977, there were no political parties in Panama because the 
dictatorship had outlawed them. We were living in a political 
dark age. At that time, the cake was being divided because 
there were no legislatures, no codes, no public bids to purchase 
sugar mills or cement plants, and no quotas; there was 
absolutely nothing. Everything was done through Omar Torrijos, 
the generals who followed, and the ministers who followed them. 
  [Samaniego] Mr. Manfredo is entitled to reply. 
  [Manfredo] Yes, I will be very brief. The alliance's 
negotiations with our party all featured the condition that we 
should concede the leadership to others. We insisted the 
alliance could only be based on concrete programs and... 
  [Guerra, interrupting] I must completely disagree with that, 
because it is simply not correct. Definitely, the issue now is 
not what took place. The young man just asked a very real 
question: Are we willing to reach an agreement? The answer in 
our case is yes, we are willing to reach a national agreement. 
Why? Because over and above party interest and individual 
interest there is the interest of what the country is going to 
do during these next five, 10, and 25 years. That is the reply 
we, the National Unity Movement [MUN], are giving the Panamanian 
people. 
  [Samaniego] We welcome Mr. Ossa, the Christian Democratic 
Party's vice presidential candidate, who is joining our group. 
Mr. Ossa, can you briefly give us your opinion on what you just 
saw over the television? 
  [Ossa] Congratulations to the students of the School of 
Public Administration for this opportunity. Tonight, we, the 
Panamanian people, watched video footage that makes us remember 
things we do not want to happen again. Human beings remember, 
but they are likely to forget about past events or experiences 
and repeat mistakes. It is fair for us to recall our negative 
experiences so they are not repeated. I think it is worthwhile 
to remember these things, and there are still many more things 
to remember. 
  [Samaniego] Another question by a young man. 
  [Unidentified student] Dr. Escalona, you speak of 
publicizing 
the mainland's history. Why did the government censure the 
video on the invasion of Panama, considering it won an Oscar? 
  [Escalona] As far as I know, the government has not censured 
any video. There have been remarks on it. I watched the video, 
and what it shows is a long way from what really happened in 
Panama. The video partially shows certain things from a 
particular viewpoint, to the extent I am convinced someone paid 
for the video to be manufactured like that. 
  [Samaniego] We will continue with more questions. Here is a 
student who, a few moments ago, asked to participate. 
  [Unidentified student] Good evening, Dr. Escalona, do you 
think the video the president has just aired will in any way 
help reinforce your slate and weaken the PRD? The PRD leads in 
all the opinion polls, while your slate is third. 
  [Escalona] That is probably why the video was aired. I 
cannot tell you for sure. I am sure, however, it has helped me, 
as I said before, to become thoroughly familiar with the 
movements of the octopus. I was aware of the military's will to 
defend their government. I knew of some of the things that were 
shown, but I was unaware of the callousness with which they 
talked about their so-called duty to beat the Panamanian people, 
to weaken a labor leader. These things have been educational for 
me. 
  [Student] The Arnulfist Party is in power, but the 
Panamanian 
people are crying PRD everywhere, meaning people are not 
satisfied with the current government, which has not given us 
what we wanted and asked for when we demanded a change. The 
fact this video has been presented by the president, who also 
belongs to the Arnulfist Party, makes us think. 
  [Escalona] These are everyone's opinions and speculations. 
You have every right to express an opinion and make 
speculations. May I reiterate this could be the purpose of the 
president showing or not showing the video. I dare not say what 
motivated him. I do dare say, however, it has been educational 
for me to have learned about this under any circumstances, 
today, tomorrow, or after the elections. I know the movements 
of the octopus from inside out. These movements and what moved 
them are thoroughly detailed there. They wanted to stay in power 
to retain the privileges they had already acquired. 
  [Samaniego] Mr. Manfredo, one reply to this remark. 
  [Manfredo] We will win on 8 May, not with the votes against 
the PRD but with the votes in favor of our proposal. 
  [Samaniego] Another question by another student. 
  [Unidentified student] My question is this. The video the 
president has presented is just a reaction of fear of seeing the 
PRD as a leader, of fear the government parties will win the 
next elections. Do you think this is a sign of agony on his 
part? 
  [Samaniego] Mr. Ossa, your opinion? 
  [Ossa] My attention has been drawn to the way he criticizes 
the president's actions by describing it as an agony, and he is 
not far from the truth. When he mentioned the announcement, the 
president said he was ill in the head and the heart. I think 
the president has created an unnecessary expectation throughout 
the country, because we all were familiar with 75 percent of the 
information included in the video. I remember having heard 
Solis Palma say over the television five years ago the ministers 
gave credit more to the Defense Forces than anyone else, and 
everyone knew this in Panama, but he is refreshing our memory. 
This workshop deals with the state's dynamics regarding 
globalization and the changes necessary in the state. This is 
one of the necessary changes, and this is why this must not 
happen in Panama again, but it will likely happen. 
  [Samaniego] Another question? 
  [Unidentified student] One of the candidates mentioned 
history. I have always liked history. My question is addressed 
to Mr. Escalona. I would like for him to remember two dates I 
have never forgotten--2 January 1931 and 20 December 1989. I 
would like him to give us an opinion. At the same time, the 
president's remarks give me the impression he is trying to pass 
judgment, not a formal one but a nationwide one, where the 
government is the judge, the people the jury, and the PRD the 
accuser. I would like for you to give me your opinion. 
  [Escalona] Three positions for three entirely different 
perspectives. First, January of 1931 was the first coup in the 
history of the Republic. History says this coup was aimed at 
Goytia. He could not handle it at the time and sought the help 
of Harmodio Arias. This coup changed the country's destiny, and 
a new leadership emerged, because Dr. Arnulfo Arias Madrid was 
born then and there. I remember this very well, because this is 
part of our history and part of the Panamanian people's culture. 
You remember things well. 
  Second, what happened on 19 December 1989? On that day the 
North American forces rained death over the country. Some call 
it invasion, others call it liberation. The result of this is 
that the Panamanian people welcomed the North Americans who came 
not to overthrow a government--and this is where the historic 
analysis is wrong--but to defend democracy, responding to a 
government decision to annul the elections. When the government 
made this decision and the OAS backed the government, the United 
States came up with Operation Just Cause and came to Panama to 
defend democracy. 
  [Samaniego] There is a question left unanswered from one of 
the students participating in "Youth '94" concerning the video 
the president of the Republic just presented. 
  [Unidentified student] I commented in my last question that, 
when the president's video was being broadcast, it gave the 
impression of being a public trial on a national level. Here, 
as I mentioned before, the government is the judge; the accused 
in this case would be the PRD; and the jury would be the 
Panamanian people. If a legal expert can give me a reply based 
on... 
  [Escalona, interrupting] I believe I have the right to 
respond to this question, and I will exercise that right. The 
question is whether this is a trial by jury, or whether this is 
a trial by magistrates. Here is Panama, we do not have the type 
of trial in which both magistrates and jurors participate. As 
far as I know, this only exists in Italy. This formula is used 
to enable the magistrates to compensate for errors the jury 
might commit. 
  There is indeed a victim here, as you have adeptly pointed 
out. The analogy is wrong, however, in terms of the victim. The 
only victim here is the Panamanian people; they are the victims. 
  Those good-for-nothings were feasting on and celebrating 
what 
they were taking from the Panamanian people, what they were 
milking from the Panamanian people. You saw for yourself. 
Sitting there you can see everyone, from the president of the 
Republic, to the commander of the National Guard, every single 
minister of state, and every single deputy minister of state. I 
saw Targidio Bernal among them, and he was only a deputy 
government minister. They were feasting. This was a 
demonstration of what they did to remain in government. Their 
idea was that the most important thing for a government was to 
make sure that it was not overthrown. They do not want to be 
overthrown, even if they are overthrown by way of votes. But 
this time we must overthrow them. Thank you. 
  [Samaniego] Mr. Ossa, as a lawyer, what is your analysis? 
  [Ossa] In my opinion, the student's perception is excellent, 
when he uses the analogy of a trial. I also agree with Escalona 
that the victim has been the people. He mentioned the 
plaintiff, the defendant, and the jury; however, he did not 
include the victim. According to the video, the people were the 
victims, and according to the current situation, the people 
continue to be the victims. Things have not changed. I would 
like to advise my colleague Escalona to be careful when he talks 
about those good-for-nothings, because he could be speaking of 
some people still in government. If you like, I can mention 
some names. 
  [Escalona] Go ahead, mention them. 
  [Ossa] The president's adviser, Menalco Solis, for example. 
  [Escalona] Go ahead, mention them, we are here to... 
  [Ossa, interrupting] You here can help me mention some 
names, 
right? 
  [Samaniego] No, you mention them. 
  [Ossa] I can mention, for example, Menalco Solis, who works 
directly with... 
  [Escalona, interrupting] Go ahead, mention them. We are... 
  [Ossa, interrupting] Do not call him a good-for-nothing, 
because this could offend him. Maybe this would be a 
situation... [pauses] Maybe the people would... 
  [Escalona, interrupting] I think it is your duty to mention 
these names. 
  [Ossa] I think the figure of speech is correct, and the 
application of the term good-for-nothing was correct. Maybe, 
Legislator Escalona is right after all. 
  [Samaniego] Does Mr. Manfredo have something to say? 
  [Manfredo] I agree with my colleague here. [laughter, 
applause] 
  [Samaniego] Let us continue with more questions for the 
vice presidential candidates on the current situation in the 
country following the video presented by President Endara. 
  [Unidentified student] I believe we have discussed the video 
on the previous government, but none of the panelists have told 
us what their plans are for areas such as health, housing, 
education... 
  [Samaniego, interrupting] We are going to discuss this in a 
moment. However, if you wish, they can briefly answer your 
question. 
  [Unidentified student] I would like that, because we have 
discussed the video, but they have not disclosed any plans or 
any solutions for housing, health, and education. We do not 
only want to talk about the video but also about those things 
the Panamanian people need. 
  [Samaniego] That is my fault, because I told them we would 
discuss the video, okay? Let us look at... 
  [Manfredo, interrupting] I have a brief comment on that. I 
agree that without forgetting the past, and without trying to 
reclaim the past, we must begin looking ahead to the future. 
  [Samaniego] Of course. Mr. Ossa? Mr. Quijano, pardon me. 
  [Quijano] I believe it is a very timely question. We have 
not addressed these issues because they have not been raised. 
During the commercial break, by the way, I wondered aloud when 
the young people would ask about programs for the future, 
because we must think of the future. 
  Briefly, in the area of education, I believe we should 
eliminate all remnants of statism from the national Constitution 
and open our borders to national and foreign universities to 
enable Panamanians to have the ability and facilities to educate 
themselves properly and adequately. The state must strengthen 
higher education and provide the necessary financing so that 
young students whose sole problem is money can receive an 
adequate education and, in turn, be prepared for the future. 
  [Samaniego] Engineer Quijano, forgive me for interrupting 
you, but this topic will be discussed after we present the PRD's 
news conference. We would like to wind up our discussion on the 
statements made by the president of the Republic. 
  [Quijano] Later, I would like to discuss the housing issue. 
  [Samaniego] Of course, all you want. [applause] Viewers, 
we are now going to see the news conference the PRD just held to 
discuss President Guillermo Endara's remarks on a nationwide 
television network. [passage omitted] 
  [Samaniego] Now we are going to hear the reactions of each 
of 
the candidates. Mr. Ossa, what is your reaction to the news 
conference the PRD presidential candidate has just given? 
  [Ossa] I noticed candidate Perez Balladares' reaction on the 
TV screen when he said he feels ashamed that the president 
remembered the past and everything else. I do not know whether 
the president did the right thing. I truly believe we need to 
remember things, but I looked up the definition of the word Toro 
in the Royal Academy's dictionary, and it says it is a 
tough-skinned mammal with a long tail. I guess it is true that 
one needs to be tough skinned to go before the country and say 
it is not good to recall the past when one has served as manager 
for Carlos Duque's 1989 campaign. I believe we need to remember 
this, too, and if a person has a long tail, he should try to 
discourage people from recalling the past. I think the 
president's decision to show the video was good because it prods 
the memory, and the PRD has no other option other than to say it 
was not good to have shown it. I simply believe that it was 
good to have shown it. 
  [Samaniego] Viewers and special guests, we will now go to 
our 
studios on the Transisthmian Highway for more reactions. After 
that we will return to "Youth '94." [passage omitted] 
  Viewers and friends we are back with "Youth '94." We will 
now hear more reactions on how the candidates and the people 
feel about President Guillermo Endara's message. [video cuts to 
live relay of an interview with Samuel Lewis Galindo, National 
Consensus Alliance presidential candidate, by an unidentified 
reporter] 
  [Reporter] Thank you, Ricardo. We are here at Las Rocas 
Building to hear what Samuel Lewis Galindo, presidential 
candidate for the National Consensus Alliance, has to say about 
President Endara's message. 
  [Lewis] He presented a documentary that depicts shameful 
events, and most of the Panamanian people condemned these events 
when they occurred. It is because of those things that 
happened, and also because of so many subservient civilians, 
that parties such as Solidarity were born. They were born from 
the need to give the people a change -- a real change from that 
ignominious past and from today, which is full of frustration. 
Today more than ever I believe that Solidarity is fulfilling a 
great duty. It is raising politics to a high level, and it is 
giving politics the dignity it should have and that the 
Panamanian people deserve. 
  [Reporter] What do you think was behind the president's 
decision to make this video public? 
  [Lewis] I believe that the president of the Republic should 
not have been the one to present a strictly political 
documentary. That should have been done by one of the parties 
that opposes the PRD to remind the people about incidents which 
have been condemned by everyone and which were a shame for the 
nation. [video returns to Samaniego at the El Panama Hotel, who 
introduces a three-minute recording of a 14 April news 
conference by PDC presidential candidate Eduardo Vallarino] 
[passage omitted] 
  [Samaniego] Mr. Ossa has already given his views about the 
PRD candidate's statements. We will now ask his opinion about 
the various reactions throughout the country. 
  [Ossa] I simply wanted to say, in 30 seconds, that the most 
important thing which occurred in Mr. Perez Balladares' 
statements is that he did not deny what appeared in the videos, 
although he did beat around the bush. He merely discussed 
whether the president had done the right thing or not. He did 
not deny the most important issue. In this case, silence can be 
taken for consent. 
  [Samaniego] Dr. Manfredo? 
  [Manfredo] I said at the outset of this program that I 
believed it was inappropriate for the president to personally 
present the videotape, but I was equally surprised by Ernesto 
Perez Balladares' appearance on television, because he is the 
candidate of the PRD, which supported Noriega's regime. I would 
have thought that, after viewing the videotape, he would be 
hiding in a closet, beating his chest and saying: mea culpa, mea 
culpa, mea gravissima culpa. [laughter] 
  [Samaniego] Engineer? 
  [Guerra] Politicians or politicos generally use words when 
they are convenient. They talk about feeling ashamed about the 
president's attitude, but they have never talked about feeling 
ashamed about the attitude they adopted during the 21-year 
regime. The other thing is that he is issuing an appeal for 
democracy today, when, for 21 years, he personally abetted 
dictatorship in this nation. Those are incongruent things, and 
I believe the essential thing is he cannot deny this. It would 
be barbaric, because it is there on video. He would have to 
claim he is not the one shown on the screen, although he does 
not really resemble the man shown on the screen. 
  [Escalona] The Scriptures say: They shall be known for their 
deeds. Candidate Ernesto Perez Balladares has shown today what 
he truly is. He has sought refuge in escapism. He has 
criticized the president of the Republic to avoid a problem 
which, he knows, he was a part of. They shall be known for 
their deeds. He has no other option but to do what the Holy 
Scriptures say -- and hear me well, Ernesto Perez Balladares -- 
tie a millstone around your neck and jump into the ocean. 
[laughter] 
  [Samaniego] Engineer Quijano, your answer? 
  [Quijano] The homeland is a remembrance of our history, and 
I 
believe that, at this point, Dr. Perez Balladares renounced the 
video presented by the president. He said the president had 
signed a document at the Santa Maria la Antigua University and 
that, for this reason, he should not have pointed out historical 
truths. Nevertheless, he never denied any act they perpetrated: 
when they attacked the Panamanian people on the streets; when 
they manipulated public funds at the Presidential Palace; when 
they played with the future of workers, nurses, and teachers; 
when they played with the 13th month bonus -- an acquired right 
of the Panamanian people. This is my reaction. 
  [Samaniego] Well, Panamanian friends and students, we will 
now give a round of applause for the candidates who answered the 
young people's call. Thank you for coming to "Youth '94." We 
also want to request a round of applause for the young people 
from the various universities who were here with us and who 
asked insightful questions in a respectful way. I congratulate 
you. Dear viewers, this has been "Youth '94" with the vice 
presidential candidates. Thank you, and good evening.

<F P=106> [Interview with Panamanian Education Minister Marcos Alarcon </F>
by reporter Luis Alberto Jimenez at the Palace of the Herons in 
Panama City on 14 April--recorded] 
  [Text] [Alarcon] We all were watching, let's say, what the 
television stations were analyzing. Nothing at all was being 
planned. We were simple viewers analyzing the various reactions 
as reflected by the television interviews. 
  [Jimenez] Did the members of the Cabinet Council know of the 
content of the document that was going to be presented? 
  [Alarcon] No Cabinet Council member knew about this 
document. 
This was a decision made solely by the president, and if you 
listen to the documentary introduction the president himself 
assumes the responsibility of the content of the document. 
  [Jimenez] Politically speaking, who gains from this? 
  [Alarcon] The people are the ones who benefit. The people 
are the ones who did not know the inside details of how the 
military government operated.

<F P=106> [Report by Mara Rivera; from a "Special Edition" of "RPC </F>
Television News"] 
  [Text] Shortly before President Endara addressed the nation 
via a national network on Thursday evening, the city was 
virtually paralyzed. 
  In view of the fact employees of the private sector received 
their biweekly salaries and 13th-month bonuses today, stores 
should have remained open until after 2100. This was not the 
case, however. By 1900, almost every store was closed, and the 
few that remained open were empty. The uncertainty of the 
situation harmed local business. 
  [Begin recording] [Ricardo Duran] There was even talk of 
street violence, strikes and so forth, and this prompted some 
businesses to release their employees a little earlier and to 
close. After seeing what happened this evening, however, I 
believe the country will return to normal tomorrow. 
  [Rivera] Did this situation in any way affect the country's 
economic activity? 
  [Duran] I would imagine so. I hope no great harm was done, 
and thank God it will not be permanent. [end recording] 
  According to Monsignor Brown, the president's announcement 
did not cause any surprise. 
  [Begin recording] [Brown] I believe too great an expectation 
was created for what, in fact, was said. 
  [Rivera] Do you believe this will have an effect on 
politics? 
  [Brown] I do not know. It is difficult to say. 
  [Rivera] What is your opinion of what Endara said? Was 
there any substance? 
  [Brown] In reality, he did not say much. [end recording] 
  It is most likely the country will return to normalcy, and 
the electoral campaign will continue as it has until now.

<F P=106> [Report by Juan Manuel Diaz C.] </F>
  [Text] Panamanian Foreign Minister Jose Raul Mulino stated 
that 75 percent of the agreements signed by Panama on the 
subject of drug trafficking have not been ratified by the 
Legislative Assembly. 
  Mulino said that the Foreign Ministry has reached a series 
of 
agreements with various countries to combat drug trafficking and 
other related activities, such as money laundering, but that the 
assembly has shelved these initiatives. 
  According to the diplomat, Panama signed a Mutual Legal 
Assistance Treaty (MLAT) with England last year, but the 
document has yet to be approved. 
  He emphasized that all efforts made with Colombia and other 
nations will be nullified if definite approval is not achieved 
during this period. He added that this would leave the country 
in arrears regarding means of cooperating to fight drug 
trafficking. 
  The foreign minister said that approximately 15 treaties are 
awaiting the Assembly's ratification or rejection, but that 
these need to be quickly implemented. 
  The U.S. Senate recently released a document asserting that 
Panama is one of the countries that have cooperated least in the 
war against drug trafficking and money laundering. 
  However, the national government denies these accusations, 
arguing that it has enforced a series of norms to combat drug 
trafficking, including its adherence to the Vienna Convention 
and enforcing a decree that compels tourists to fill customs 
declarations for assets in excess of $10,000. 
  The Foreign Ministry is expected to send a formal protest 
note to the U.S. Government shortly.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Marilut Luis O'Hara: "So long, Mr. Glassman"] </F>
  [Text] Perhaps he will not receive an award for being the 
best diplomat, because maybe he isn't. He ignored the rules 
many times because he considered it necessary. He gave priority 
to the human facet of his work. Being a foreigner, he involved 
himself in internal affairs when he believed it would benefit 
the people. He condemned what was condemnable, he did not hide 
his annoyance over the government's arbitrary measures and, 
committing the serious crime of interference, he prevented a 
coup d'etat with a fierce communique, which possibly merited the 
disapproval of experts in international relations. 
  It cannot be doubted, Mr. Glassman, that you have done a lot 
more for this country than many politicians who stress that they 
are fighting for the needs of the people, and yet take advantage 
of them when they can. 
  It is a pity that he is leaving. Even at the risk of 
sticking my nose into the internal affairs of your country, I 
decry your government's decision to deprive us of a much valued 
and honorable person who was not afraid to lose the confidence 
of the Paraguayan authorities if that helped consolidate the 
national process. 
  It would have been very significant for us for him to have 
continued as head of the U.S. Embassy in these times. We 
Paraguayans know that things are not going well, that there are 
too many people interested in returning this country to the 
past, and that it is those people who have the decisionmaking 
power within the government. 
  Up to the present, we have only had you to confront the 
power 
of those persons, their lack of decency, and their arrogance. 
The only hope we have now is that your successor will not 
respect diplomatic rules, and yes, that he will respect 
democracy, the banner that you raised so bravely. 
  There are very powerful sources in Paraguay that have 
decided 
that the country must return to the dark age of dictatorship. 
We decent Paraguayans have decided not to allow this backward 
step, because in this process we have taken risks, and have many 
times lost too many things and dear ones, which demands from us 
the final victory. 
  But we also need the international community to support us. 
Paraguay was an island that the world ignored during the 
Stroessner dictatorship. Your country supported the dictator 
when this coincided with its interests. We do not want that to 
occur again. Only with the help of the world's democratic 
nations can we prevent a return to the dark ages, a move desired 
by those who hold power today. 
  For this reason we need experts in diplomacy. We do not want 
people who stick to the rules, to protocol. We want persons who 
will stick out their necks when it is necessary to consolidate a 
process that has lasted too long already and has shed so much 
Paraguayan blood. We need someone like you. 
  There is no doubt about it: You will not receive an award as 
the best diplomat, but please accept the thanks of a people who 
are trying to get out of the dark, and who have mortgaged all 
their efforts in order to achieve this. 
  Thank you, Mr. Glassman, and so long.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Paraguay through 14 April. 
  According to the Central Bank, BCP, the drop in March's 
inflation rate, which stood at 1.9 percent, shows that inflation 
will continue its downward rate. The BCP believes the measures 
it adopted, namely a strict control of monetary policy, and the 
adjustment policy implemented by the government were 
instrumental in curbing the inflationary spiral. (Asuncion ABC 
COLOR in Spanish 6 Apr 94 p 16) 
  Paraguay owed more than $566 million to the Paris Club by 31 
December 1993. This represents 46.5 of Paraguay's foreign debt. 
Paraguay's largest creditor in the Paris Club is Japan, with 
which the debt totals about $260 million. Paraguay's 
second-largest club creditor is Germany, with more than $134 
million, followed by France with $63 million. Fifty-one percent 
of the foreign debt involves multilateral organizations. The 
Inter-American Development Bank is the largest creditor, with 
$429 million, followed by the World Bank, with about $150 
million. Paraguay's foreign debt totaled $1.217 billion by late 
1993. (Asuncion ABC COLOR in Spanish 10 Apr 94 Economic 
Supplement p 3) 
  According to information from the General Customs 
Directorate, Paraguayan exports totaled $172 million during the 
first quarter this year, which represents a 32 percent increase 
compared with the same period last year. Soybean exports 
totaled $78,477,750; lumber, $17,169,061; leather and hides, 
$11,905,205; cotton, $8,596,638; frozen meat, $8,067,565; 
essential oil, $2,027,979; meat, $1,014,856; and coffee, 
$526,500. Paraguay's main purchasers were the Netherlands, with 
32.6 percent; Brazil, 23.5 percent; the United States and 
Argentina, 7.6 percent; and Bermuda, 4.4 percent. (Asuncion 
ULTIMA HORA in Spanish 14 Apr 94 p 21)

    [Editorial Report] TRADE WITH COLOMBIA UP--An editorial in 
the 11 March Quito daily HOY commented that the 1992 free trade 
agreement between Ecuador and Colombia has had a "spectacular 
effect," and that bilateral trade has "exceeded all 
expectations." According to the editorial, in 1993 Ecuadoran 
exports to Colombia increased over 100 percent and there was a 
46-percent increase in imports from that country. The editorial 
added that Ecuador has become the third largest exporter of 
nontraditional products to the Colombian market after Venezuela 
and the United States. Colombian investment is also on the rise, 
the editorial continued, with about 350 Colombian companies 
establishing factories or forming joint ventures in Ecuador. 
Furthermore, the 25 March HOY reported that the 
Ecuadoran-Colombian Chamber of Commerce revealed that Colombian 
capital constitutes 18 percent of the capital of 327 Ecuadoran 
companies. Heran Leon, executive director of the Ecuadoran 
Federation of Exporters (FEDEXPOR), told the 10 March HOY that 
evidence of the new trade openness was manifested at the first 
Andean Fair held in Pasto, Colombia from 26 February to 6 March. 
  On 6 March, the Quito business daily EL COMERCIO reported 
that between 1991 and 1993, Ecuadoran exports to Colombia 
increased from $40 million to $195 million, breaking the 1983 
record of $160 million, according to estimates by the Colombian 
Embassy in Quito. The daily reported that Colombia fared even 
better in 1993 with $224 million worth of sales, a 191-percent 
increase from $77 million in 1980. As for Ecuador's principal 
exports to Colombia, the 10 March HOY reported that, in 1993, 
exports of automobiles totaled $40 million; seafood products, 
$12 million; fish meal, $9.5 million; palm oil, $5 million; 
plywood, $3.1 million; followed by 10 other products. Colombian 
products most in demand in Ecuador include raw sugar, books and 
printed material, textiles, medicines, sweets, and tires. 
  By January 1994, according to 6 March EL COMERCIO, Colombian 
exports to Ecuador through the border town Ipiales were 53.4 
percent higher than during the same period in 1993. Negotiations 
are under way to construct a Pacific coast highway connecting 
the province of Esmeraldas in Ecuador with the port of Tumaco in 
Colombia's Narino Department. The project will include the 
construction of a bridge over the Mataje River which would link 
the Colombian department of Putumayo with the Ecuadoran province 
of Sucumbios. 
  WOOD EXPORTS--The Quito daily HOY of 17 March reported that, 
in 1993, wood exports surged to $15.8 million following the 1992 
slump where wood exports only amounted to $5.8 million. Between 
1988 and 1992, wood exports, mainly to the Andean Group, had 
been steady at approximately $12 million. Following the 1992 
slump, Ecuador started reentering foreign markets, especially 
"nonprotected" ones such as Korea, Europe, and the United 
States, ecuador's principal client. The inefficiency of the 
country's forestry sector was pointed out by Alberto Robalino, 
president of Ecuador's Forestry and Lumber Development 
Corporation (CORMADERA), who said that around 10 million cubic 
meters of wood are cut annually, but 70 percent is wasted and 
remains in the forest after it is cut. 
  GUAYAS PROVINCE GENERATES MOST INCOME--A study by the 
Guayaquil civic council and the Chamber of Commerce found that 
Guayas Province, where Ecuador's largest city, Guayaquil, is 
located, generates 49.36 percent of the country's sales, 63.51 
percent of its customs receipts, and 45.40 percent of its 
nonpetroleum revenue. Over 55 percent of the nation's companies 
and 54 percent of its banks are located in Guayas. However, the 
study indicates, this province only receives 11.7 percent of 
provincial council allocations. The state's centralized system 
was blamed for "hampering Guayas development," according to 
Guayaquil EL UNIVERSO of 30 March. 
  SPANISH CREDIT FOR DAM--Spain has granted Ecuador $123 
million to complete the construction of the La Esperanza dam, 
due in 1995. The dam is part of the project to provide Manabi 
Province with water for agricultural and home use, reports 
Guayaquil EL UNIVERSO 2 March. 
  CREDIT FOR INDIANS--Quito EL COMERCIO on 18 February reports 
that the European Commission has approved a credit line of $2.1 
million to finance a development program for the Indians of 
Pastaza Province. The 5-year program will aim at preserving 
natural resources, rehabilitating lands, diversifying diets, and 
improving livestock raising. The program will also encourage 
ecotourism, health and education workshops, and the construction 
of communal meeting places.

  [Text] Peruvian Foreign Minister Efrain Goldenberg 
Schreiber and Argentine Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella on 5 
April issued a joint communique at the end of Foreign Minister 
Guido Di Tella's official visit. In the communique, the foreign 
ministers reassert their countries' willingness to increase 
bilateral integration and cooperation at different levels. 
  During his stay in Lima, Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella met 
President Alberto Fujimori, to whom he extended the greetings of 
Argentine President Carlos Menem. He also met Jaime Yoshiyama 
Tanaka, president of the Democratic Constituent Congress. 
  The Peruvian and Argentine foreign ministers stressed the 
importance of the upcoming Argentine-Peruvian presidential 
summit scheduled to be held in three months. 
  In the communique, the Argentine Government confirms its 
willingness to grant financial help to Peru for the construction 
of integration highways. The communique also expresses the 
desire of Argentine companies to increase their investments in 
Peru and to form joint ventures with Peruvian companies. 
  In the communique, the Peruvian and Argentine Governments 
reassert their commitment to world peace and condemn the 
proliferation of weapons. 
  Before departing for Argentina, Foreign Minister Guido Di 
Tella held a news conference in which he referred to the full 
enforcement of the Rio de Janeiro Protocol signed by Peru and 
Ecuador, of which Argentina is a guarantor. 
  Di Tella stated that any negotiations undertaken should be 
conducted within the framework of this protocol. He said: "We 
believe that what has been signed must be enforced. We believe 
in this protocol and in the role we have assumed." Di Tella 
added that the Rio de Janeiro Protocol "is the most adequate 
mechanism."

  [Text] Lima, 13 Apr (EFE) -- The Peruvian Administration 
and the opposition parties are clashing over the control 
mechanisms for the general elections that will be held next 
year. The two parties are charging each other with intolerance 
and irresponsibility. 
  The clash began on 12 April when the Congressional 
Constituent Committee cast a tie vote on the opposition's 
proposal for a fourth set of voting records in addition to the 
three sets of records that the officials who oversee the 
balloting normally keep. 
  The fourth set of voting records would not be given to the 
voting officials or the Armed Forces, which are entrusted by law 
with keeping all voting records. According to the opposition, 
this fourth set of records will help oversee the elections and 
prevent fraud. 
  The opposition also objected to Constituent Committee 
Chairman Carlos Torres' vote that broke the tie after he had 
promised to abstain. Incidents cropped up and insults were 
exchanged in the corridors of the congressional building. 
  Torres said that had the proposal to have a fourth set of 
records been accepted, "it would have made the electoral process 
chaotic. What would happen if this fourth set of records 
revealed something totally different from the other three? Can 
you imagine the problems this would create?" 
  The opposition threatened to bring charges against Congress 
Chairman Jaime Yoshiyama for not calling a plenary meeting 
because the legislative year should have started on 1 April. The 
opposition also asked Yoshiyama to attend because he has been 
absent from all seven Congressional Executive Board meetings 
held so far this year. 
  With one year to go before the general elections in April 
1995, nobody knows at this point what organization or 
organizations will be in charge of organizing and coordinating 
the elections, which will be held within the framework of the 
new Constitution. 
  Congress is embroiled in a pointless debate, constantly 
changing its course that leads nowhere. On the contrary, the 
disagreements between the pro-government majority and the 
opposition are getting worse all the time. 
  The core of the problem is the new electoral system outlined 
in the new Constitution that was ratified by referendum in 
October 1993. 
  Under the new Constitution, the National Electoral Board has 
been divided into three separate organizations. It will require 
a long and complicated process to get these three organizations 
up and running, and there is little time left for this. 
  The opposition wants the National Electoral Board to handle 
the 1995 elections as it has done with the three previous 
elections held in Peru under President Alberto Fujimori's 
administration. The various opposition parties also disagree 
among themselves on what steps should be taken to achieve their 
objective. 
  The Constituent Committee has approved a bill from the 
Peruvian Bar Association according to which the Constitution 
does not have to be amended for the National Electoral Court in 
order to coordinate the 1995 elections. The bill has to be 
approved by a plenary meeting, which has not been called yet. 
  Experts agree that if the constitutional provisions are 
followed to the letter there will be no time to set up the 
appropriate organizations. Certain news organizations have 
warned that the elections may have to be postponed. 
  The new electoral system is made up of the National 
Electoral 
Board, which will establish the rules and regulations; the 
National Office for Electoral Procedures (ONPE) [Oficina 
Nacional de Procesos Electorales], which will organize the 
elections; and the National Identity and Marital Status 
Registry, which will provide the list of voters. 
  The National Council of Magistrates has to appoint the ONPE 
head, and this council has not been assembled yet. The election 
of council members will require a lengthy process that will only 
further delay the establishment of the new identity registry.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The Clock Does Not Work"] </F>
  [Text] According to the law and the almanac, it is simply 
impossible to carry out the next electoral process within the 
time period planned by the government party. Some people have 
made erroneous calculations based on the closing date for the 
registration of candidates, which falls on 10 October 1994. They 
seem to be forgetting, however, that the elections must be 
convoked by 15 August at the latest. To make this possible, all 
of the electoral bodies for which the current Constitution 
provides would have to be installed. This cannot be achieved, 
even with the aid of Macuito. 
  A detailed analysis of the steps that must be taken in order 
for the elections to be held in April of 1995 reveals that 281 
court days, that is to say 13 months, are needed for the 
implementation of all of the electoral mechanisms required by 
the Constitution. Even if work is done at a forced-march pace, 
full steam ahead, and allowing no respite, 157 court days--that 
is to say seven and a half months--would be needed. 
  In the first case, assuming a normal rhythm, the electoral 
requirements would be met by about April 1995. This is why the 
general elections, according to the electoral law in effect--Law 
23903, Article 2--are to be held "on the second Sunday in the 
month of April in the year prescribed for the renewal of the 
executive and legislative branches." 
  In the second case, the electoral apparatus would be 
complete 
by October. As we have noted, this presumes accelerated work, 
which might possibly complicate the situation. In any case, the 
parties and fronts would have only six months in which to wage 
their electoral campaigns. 
  Now then, according to Article 1 of Law 23903, "The 
president 
of the Republic will convoke general elections at least eight 
months prior to the date on which they are to be held." This 
means that the convocation must be issued by 15 August, at the 
latest. 
  Can this be done when the electoral bodies prescribed by the 
Constitution have not yet been established? Can the candidates 
for the presidency of the Republic or for the parliament accept 
the convocation under these conditions, when, for example, it is 
not known how the process of appointing the National Judgeship 
Council of the Magistracy was handled? (It will be remembered 
that in accordance with Article 182 of the new constitution, 
"The head of the National Electoral Procedures Office is 
appointed by the National Judgeship Council for a renewable 
period of four years." It is the duty of that official, this 
same constitutional article says, "to organize all of the 
electoral and referendum procedures and those of any other type 
of popular consultation, including their budgets, as well as to 
design and draft the ballot forms. He is also responsible for 
providing the documents and other materials required for the 
voting process and for publicizing its results." 
  To obtain a more accurate idea of how troublesome and slow 
the mechanisms conceived by the constituents of the New Majority 
and Cambio 90 (Change 90) are, it suffices to note the 
prescribed procedure for the appointment of the National 
Judgeship Council. 
  The Council has seven members, whose election is more 
complicated than the designation of the mandarins in Imperial 
China. One member is elected by the Supreme Court; another by 
the Higher Prosecutors' Council; another by the members of the 
national colleges of attorneys, by secret ballot; and two by the 
members of the other professional colleges, by secret ballot. 
One member is elected by the rectors of the state universities, 
and another by those of the private universities. 
  It should be added that some colleges have their own 
specific 
procedures for the election of delegates. The bylaws of the 
College of Engineers, for example, provide for a period of 90 
days. 
  The steps involved in the election process in the colleges 
of 
professionals are oppressively slow. The normal period would be 
one day for the approval of the internal electoral calendar, 10 
days for the publication and dispatch of the electoral calendar 
to the Departmental Electoral Commissions, 30 days for the 
checking of the census registers; eight days for coordination 
with the departmental electoral commissions on the design and 
color of the ballot forms, one day for the registration of 
candidates, two days for the publication of the names of the 
candidates, two days for the disqualification of candidates, two 
days for the decisions on disqualifications, two days for 
appeals against the decisions, one day for the final decision on 
disqualifications, another day for the drawing to allocate 
numbers to the candidates, another day for the publication of 
the announcement of the qualified candidates, 15 days for the 
dispatch of ballots to the departments, one day for the election 
process, 10 days for the receipt of the departmental balloting 
reports, 10 days for the national tallying process, and one day 
for the installation of the National Judgeship Council. In 
all--heavens above!--89 days. Three months. 
  In the event of a forced march, the process might be 
compressed into 57 days. But that is all. One is tempted to say, 
in the words of the refrain, "Clock, you don't keep time." 
<H5>  Impossible Either Way </H5>
  Stage I involves the drafting of the organic laws, and the 
procedures required are discussion and approval of the draft and 
laws pertaining to the electoral system and the National 
Judgeship Council and their promulgation and publication, as 
well as the electoral committees of the colleges of attorneys 
and other professionals. The normal procedure would take 91 
days, or if the steps were accelerated, 48 days. 
  Stage II involves the election of the members of the 
National 
Judgeship Council, and the procedures required include drafting 
the electoral calendar, polling the colleges, registration of 
the candidates, disqualification, etc., and installation of the 
Council. The normal procedure would take 99 days, or if the 
steps were accelerated, 57 days. 
  Stage III involves the appointment of the heads of the ONPE 
and the RENIEC, and the procedures required include selection 
and evaluation of the candidates and appointments. The normal 
procedure would take 31 days, or if the steps were accelerated, 
15 days. 
  Stage IV involves the organization of the ONPE and RENIEC, 
and the procedures required include establishment of the 
internal regulations, the requesting of materials and personnel, 
the transfer of resources and equipment, and the reassignment of 
JNE [National Election Board] personnel. The normal procedure 
would require 60 days, or if the steps were accelerated, 37 days. 
  Thus all four stages together would require 281 court days 
normally, or with acceleration, 157 court days, representing 13 
months and seven and a half months, respectively. 
  The five preceding paragraphs describe the various steps in 
the entire process, and the result is equally discouraging. 
Except for those who think that all the preparations have 
already been made, and that on the basis of the political 
situation, it is impossible for Fujimori and his military 
entourage to abandon government power in an ineffably exquisite 
democratic fashion. In the opinion of these skeptics, the 
government party does not care one whit that the opposition 
candidates would not have time enough to wage a real electoral 
campaign. 
<H5>  What Should Be Done? </H5>
  An unrelenting analysis of the time periods required shows 
that the country will be faced with a dilemma. Either the 
elections will have to be postponed, or a formula for compromise 
making it possible to hold elections in accordance with the law 
and the Constitution must be found. In this connection, a 
proposal put forth by Roger Caceres, a congressman, appears to 
provide a means of salvation. 
  The proposal made by Caceres, which has been given support 
by 
Enrique Chirinos Soto and has received the provisional approval 
of the government party majority in the Constitutional 
Commission of the CCD, would put the electoral process in the 
hands of the National Election Board, for this one time. The 
Board would take over the functions of the National Electoral 
Procedures Office and the Civil Identification Registry. 
  Even Gilberto Siura voted for the proposal in the 
Constitutional Commission, although he explained that he only 
did so to speed up the process of getting the text referred to a 
plenary session of the CCD. On the other hand, it is reported 
that Carlos Torres y Torres Lara, the president of the 
Commission, exclaimed recently: "I believe that we have s...d 
this up!" At least he recognizes the fact.

<F P=106> [Special Report No. 34 issued by the Center for Development </F>
Studies and Promotion, DESCO: "Political Violence in Peru 
Today"] 
  [Text] January 1994's statistics on political violence were 
similar to those of November 1993. There were 34 incidents and 
40 killings, more or less the same level as the early years of 
the subversive war. 
  Lima was again in first place in number of incidents: 11 
acts 
of political violence took place in the capital, 32 percent of 
the total. All of the actions sought to maintain the operational 
presence of the Shining Path guerrillas who remain free. The 
incidents were of little importance. 
  The capital and forest regions occupied second place, with 
eight victims (23.5 percent) each. The most important subversive 
incidents took place in the province of El Dorado, where Shining 
Path carried out incursions in at least four villages, and in 
the area of Saposa, where it took part in two clashes with 
security forces. 
  The regional committee of the north took third place in 
number of incidents with three (9 percent). Two of these actions 
took place in provinces of the department of Ancash, and the 
third at the locality of Chiclayo. 
  There was a tie for fourth and last place between the 
principal committee (Ayacucho) and the southern region with two 
incidents (6 percent) each. Two incursions took place in the 
south, in Orurillo District, and there was a targeted killing 
and a guerrilla incursion in the principal region. 
  With regard to number of victims, first place was the 
regional forest committee with 20 victims, 50 percent of the 
total for the month. These were all guerrilla losses in at least 
two clashes in the Saposa area. 
  The principal regional committee took second place with 
eight 
victims (20 percent). They were all civilians, including seven 
peasants, three of whom died in an incursion in Huamanguilla 
District, and the other four because they discovered and handled 
a bomb in a locality near Huamanga. An official of the Ministry 
of Transport and Telecommunications was also murdered. 
  The regional committee of the south placed third with four 
dead (10 percent). These were all peasants murdered in a Shining 
Path incursion in Orurillo District. 
  There was a tie for fourth place between the regional 
committees of the center and of the north, with three victims 
(7.5 percent) in each. Two targeted killings took place in the 
central region, in Huancayo and Tarma, and a guerrilla was 
killed in a prison in Huancayo in a fight between two Shining 
Path factions. In the northern region, the three incidents were 
targeted killings. The most important was the murder of the 
president of the Peasant, Urban and Peaceful Night Patrols, 
Gilberto Diaz Vasquez. A lawyer and a school principal were also 
murdered in the department of Ancash. 
  Finally, last place in number of victims was occupied by the 
capital, with two dead (5 percent). One of the victims was a 
villager from El Pino mountain, and the other was a university 
student who was tortured in a police station and who was 
identified as a subversive.

<H5>  Political Violence Statistics -- February 1994 </H5>
  February 1994 registered levels of political violence 
similar 
to those of the previous month, to those of November 1993, and 
to the first year of the guerrilla war. 
  This confirms a trend, at least with regard to incidents of 
political violence. There is an important decrease in the number 
of victims. There were 32 subversive incidents that caused the 
deaths of 19 persons throughout the country. 
  As is already known, Lima continues to take first place in 
number of incidents; there were 20 incidents (63 percent) of 
political violence in the capital. 
  Shining Path has tried to reestablish its presence, but it 
is 
becoming increasingly clear that it will not be able to attain 
1992's levels of terror. The most spectacular incident was the 
detonation of a car bomb at one of the main buildings of the 
Peruvian Air Force, despite the fact that the surrounding 
streets are closed to traffic. 
  The regional committee of the center was in second place 
with 
six incidents (19 percent). One of these was carried out by what 
remains of the MRTA [Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement] in 
Chanchamayo. Shining Path also had two confrontations with 
security forces in the same province. 
  The regional committee of the north had the third highest 
number of incidents with four actions (13 percent). These all 
took place in provinces in Ancash Department. 
  There was a tie for fourth and last place between the 
regional committees of mid north and mid south, with one 
incident (3 percent) each. In Pisco, an attempt was made to 
ambush two magistrates, and in Barranca, the offices of the 
Municipal Water Service were burned down. 
  With regard to victims, the regional committee of the center 
had the highest number, with nine dead (47 percent), five of 
whom were subversives. Four Shining Path members died in two 
clashes with security forces in Chanchamayo and the other in an 
attack on a community of Ashaninkas in Satipo, where two members 
of the community also died. 
  Another civilian died accidentally during an action carried 
out by the MRTA while capturing the hydroelectric plant at 
Pichanaki. After the capture, the guerrillas mined the 
approaches, and a civilian died when he stepped on one of the 
mines. 
  This was one of the MRTA's most important actions since the 
capture of its kidnapping team in Lima. 
  Finally, a noncommissioned officer of the Dincote 
[Counterterrorism Directorate] was murdered by a Shining Path 
group in Huancayo. 
  Lima had the second highest number of victims with seven (37 
percent), five of whom were policemen and two civilians. But 
only four of the civilians were killed by guerrillas. The fifth 
was killed by the Army near a military factory. 
  The regional committee of the north accounted for the third 
highest number of victims, with two deaths (11 percent), which 
were losses by the guerrillas in an assault on the locality of 
Huari. 
  Last place in number of victims with one killed (5 percent), 
was the forest region, where the president of the night patrols 
committee of Las Palmas, in the province of Leoncio Prado, 
killed a Shining Path member who had availed himself of the law 
of repentance, and who was working as a member of the patrols.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Cuban Foreign Minister's Surprising </F>
Remarks"] 
  [Text] During the brief visit he made to our country, 
Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina disclosed to the Foreign 
Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies some of the unusual 
concepts used by Castro's regime in its assessment of 
international reality. 
  The Cuban foreign minister thus disclosed to Uruguayan 
representatives the fact that "the time was not ripe" to 
institute political changes in his country "due to a still 
prevalent foreign pressure," an obviously allusion to the trade 
boycott imposed by the United States on the island's communist 
regime. 
  Furthermore, Robaina commented on the alleged violations of 
human rights in his country, noting that "the only argument 
those who are waging a human rights campaign against Cuba can 
cling to (sic) is the issue of political liberties and party 
affiliation." 
  The Cuban foreign minister has therefore openly paraded his 
lack of familiarity with current democratic thinking, according 
to which his remarks sound, if nothing else, surprising. 
  Indeed, his mere admission that the U.S. trade boycott is 
used as the underlying reason for the Cuban regime's systematic 
refusal to open the gates of freedom of expression in Cuba 
constitutes the clearest acknowledgment of the essentially 
arbitrary nature of the Cuban dictatorial regime. 
  Havana has cunningly devised a well-orchestrated attempt to 
present the U.S. boycott as a "blockade," an "embargo," or a 
kind of "sanitary cordon" that is virtually driving Cuba to 
famine. It should be clearly asserted that this is not the 
case. The United States has imposed a trade boycott on Cuba, 
thus severing all U.S. trade relations with this island. In the 
eyes of any stalwart supporter of Castro's regime, this ought to 
be simply a welcome gesture of consistency on the part of the 
United States. Not in vain has Castroism been preaching to the 
hemisphere, for nearly 40 years, about the most drastic rupture 
possible with the United States. 
  What is still more serious, however, is the attempt by Fidel 
Castro and his followers to construe this international 
political reality as the cause for their adamant refusal to 
allow Cubans to have access to democracy. This means, in the 
strictest sense of the word, that Cuban citizens are truly 
hostages to the communist regime. 
  Within this context, Minister Robaina's utterances 
concerning 
the campaign denouncing human rights violations -- which can 
"only cling to" (sic) the systematic contempt for political 
freedom, including freedom of association -- are even more 
revealing. 
  It is obvious that the Cuban diplomat brushes aside this 
area 
of public liberty as insignificant, and we have reason to 
believe that the regime he represents shares his views. In 
fact, it would be very interesting to listen to the commentaries 
of such a eulogist of Castroism, for whom the name of General 
Pinochet in Chile is, for example, anathema. He ought to 
explain right now, and clearly, what makes this repression 
desirable in Havana and yet revolting in other parts of the 
Americas. 
  This explanation will surely not be forthcoming for a long 
time, because even though Castroist leaders and their sidekicks 
are not familiar with democratic values, they really know the 
dark side of the system they represent. Otherwise, Minister 
Robaina's efforts in Montevideo to express his wish to see a 
reality in Cuba which "in the not too distant future would 
involve living together under a multiparty system in that 
country" would become incomprehensible. These remarks are 
particularly auspicious in that they were uttered by a 
government official who until very recently labelled multiparty 
systems as "multi-rubbish." 
  Despite the praiseworthy attempts by the young Cuban foreign 
minister to present his country's political regime in the light 
of the promised economic changes -- or at least to concede the 
clearly critical situation in Cuba -- his remarks are neither 
convincing nor timely at a point when the island is facing a 
shodown on its path toward freedom. 
  For all the persuasuve attempts to disguise its actual 
makeup, the Cuban dictatorship is a reality that has outlived 
its useful life and is doomed to end up in the dusty attic where 
the sad ideology that once inspired it is already languishing.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Uruguay through 14 April. 
  Economy and Finance Minister Ignacio de Posadas on 30 March 
announced that total taxes on agriculture production will reach 
$17 million this year, 57 percent less than the previous year. 
Posadas said the reduction of taxes on agriculture activities is 
"without precedent in Uruguay's history." (Montevideo EL 
OBSERVADOR in Spanish 31 Mar 94 p 1) 
  The Uruguayan currency was devalued 2.3 percent in March. 
This monthly devaluation is the highest since June and July 
1993, when it was devalued 3.6 percent and 2.5 percent, 
respectively. The price of the dollar has increased 6.4 percent 
so far this year and 26.8 percent during the past 12 months. 
Inter-bank interest at the end of March was 34 percent. 
(Montevideo EL OBSERVADOR in Spanish 4 Apr 94 Market and 
Companies Section p 2) 
  The National Statistics Institute, INE, reported that 
March's 
inflation rate was 2.83 percent and the total accrued inflation 
rate for the first quarter was 7.85 percent. Last year's first 
quarter's inflation rate was 11.5 percent. The difference 
between inflation and devaluation increased 0.52 percent in 
March. The total difference for the quarter was 1.3 percent and 
for the past 12 months was 16.6 percent. (Montevideo EL 
OBSERVADOR in Spanish 5 Apr 94 Economic Section p 6) 
  According to the INE, salaries maintained their purchasing 
power in real terms during the four months from November 1993 to 
February 1994. During this period salaries increased 11.2 
percent while the inflation rate was 11.7 percent. (Montevideo 
BUSQUEDA in Spanish 7 Apr 94 Economic Section p 28) 
  Planning and Budget Office Director Javier De Haedo said the 
tertiary economic sector -- services -- represents 65 percent 
the country's GDP, adding that 622,000 individuals work in this 
area. De Haedo said that between 1983 and 1992 the primary 
sector of agriculture and fishing grew 14.4 percent, the 
secondary sector of manufacturing industries and electricity 
production by 24.2 percent, and the tertiary sector by 33.2 
percent. De Haedo said exports and tourism added up to $2.69 
billion in 1993. (Montevideo BUSQUEDA in Spanish 7 Apr 94 
Economic Section p 29) 
  According to the INE, the unemployment rate during December 
1993 and January and February 1994 was 8.1 percent. The report 
says the mean monthly income per home during this period was 
$5,968. (Montevideo EL PAIS in Spanish 8 Apr 94 p 8) 
  The National Telecommunications Enterprise, ENTEL, has 
decided to cancel the bidding for a second system of cellular 
telephone services after the Accounting Tribunal reported that 
the winning firm did not have the appropriate technical and 
managerial support. The bid had been won by the consortium 
Telefonica Internacional Holding BV made up by the companies 
Telefonica Internacional, France Cables et Radio of France, and 
Stet International SPA of Italy. (Buenos Aires NOTICIAS 
ARGENTINAS in Spanish 1750 GMT 8 Apr 94) 
  The INE reported on 8 April that unemployment in Uruguay's 
interior urban centers dropped to 7.2 percent of the 
economically active population, PEA, during the last quarter of 
1993. The drop, however, did not represent an increase in jobs 
but a drop in the number of economically active people seeking 
jobs. Last year the PEA in interior urban centers dropped to 
53.6 percent, a full percentage point less than the previous 
year. (Buenos Aires NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS in Spanish 1751 GMT 8

  [Excerpt] The two major projects to modernize and expand 
the production capacity of the Amuay and Cardon refineries, 
which will make it possible to increase production of 
reformulated gasoline by 100,000 barrels per day, call for 
investment of 130 billion bolivars this year, according to a 
PDVSA [Venezuelan Petroleum, Inc.] report which includes 
additional information about other aspects of this industry in 
Venezuela. 
  The report says: "The dynamics of the market for 
hydrocarbons, the new environmental regulations of the 
industrialized countries, and the premise that we will continue 
to be a top oil-producing country lead PDVSA to continue to plan 
considerable investments in the medium and long term to upgrade 
its national refineries in order to adapt the variety of refined 
products Venezuela sells to the changing demands of the world 
market." 
  In most industrialized countries, the governments have 
established deadlines for compliance with environmental 
protection standards without reducing gasoline octane ratings. 
In view of these standards, PDVSA's operating subsidiaries are 
carrying out an investment plan to ensure the quality required 
on our markets. Among their projects are the El Palito 
oxigenates plant, which came into operation in 1993, and the 
plant that is being built in Cardon. These plants will permit 
exports of reformulated gasoline to the United States beginning 
in 1995. 
  The investments, which are around 130 billion bolivars in 
Venezuela in 1994, are focused mainly on the Cardon Upgrading 
Project (PARC) and the Amuay Delayed Coker (CRAY). These 
projects will contribute to increasing the processing capacity 
for heavy crudes in Venezuela's current refineries by 100,000 
barrels per day by 1995, while at the same time reducing 
residual fuel production by about 25,000 barrels per day in 
comparison with 1994 production. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Wilfer Pulgarin] </F>
  [Text] President Rafael Caldera has expressed his regret 
that at the present time, 34 years after the agrarian reform 
program was adopted, this social and economic institution has 
suffered from a deterioration in its public image. At the same 
time he took advantage of the occasion to warn that a similar 
fate could affect the autonomy of universities and state 
governments. 
  The president, who was an honored guest at the anniversary 
ceremony held on 5 March at the offices of the National Agrarian 
Institute, stated that so noble an institution as the agrarian 
reform, which was promulgated on 5 March 1960, should be 
preserved and its name should cease being something which is 
"taboo." 
  He said that, in his view agrarian reform is now, according 
to a substantial number of Venezuelans, the origin of a process 
of "parceling out production funds to the political leaders of 
groups of farmers who exploited their lands and then left them 
in an abandoned and depressed state. They let them go, so that, 
finally, they fell into the hands of those who were prepared to 
work them and make them fruitful. They were therefore violating 
the provisions, limits, and principles set down in the law 
itself." 
  In the president's view that irreversible process can happen 
to university autonomy in Venezuela which, "in the view of large 
numbers of people, is nothing more than a symbol for disorder, 
conflict, class suspensions, and a low return in educational 
activity." 
  He extended his warning to "such an important institution as 
the autonomy of state governments (which) runs the risk of 
becoming a roadway for regional dictators and for the 
degeneration of the fundamental, necessary, and creative sense 
of our Venezuelan fatherland." 
  He observed that in view of the low opinion which agrarian 
reform has he has decided to suggest to Minister of Agriculture 
Ciro Anez Fonseca an addition to or even a change in that name, 
using such terms as "rural, democratic solidarity," "democratic 
solidarity in the countryside," "agricultural solidarity," 
"productive solidarity," etc. 
  However, he emphasized that the most important aspect is 
that 
the institution of agrarian reform should move forward, "With 
the conviction that the fight to rescue agriculture in Venezuela 
is an essential element, without which we could not offer to new 
generations of our people the security of a firm and solid 
economy and a country which enjoys its human rights and social 
peace in security. This is essential to conquer the future." 
  Also participating in the day's program, in addition to the 
chief of state and the minister of agriculture and animal 
husbandry, were Isabel Urbano, president of the IAN [National 
Agrarian Institute], and delegates from farmers' and production 
associations. 
  On the same occasion the president pointed out that 
democracy 
must confront in real terms the subject of land ownership and 
access to it by peasant farmers. 
  He referred to the problem of communities of indigenous 
people, stating that these groups should be provided with help 
to guarantee their natural habitat. At the same time they should 
be given suitable assistance to ensure their progress as 
citizens of the fatherland. 
  The president said: "I am committed to achieving an 
environment of peace, justice, equity, understanding, and 
harmony in the countryside, between capitalist enterprise which 
is beginning to emerge in many areas and the people who have a 
right to the land which they work." 
  He said that he was convinced that, "The bad name of the 
agrarian reform" has distorted the views of many people. He 
invited his listeners to read Chapter 7 of the book, El 
Caso Venezuela, una Ilusion de Armonia [The Case of 
Venezuela, an Illusion of Harmony], published by the IESA 
[Institute of Higher Education for Administration]. In this 
book, he said, the view that the agrarian reform law has been 
the factor responsible for the crisis in the agricultural sector 
is proved to be false. 
  Meanwhile Ciro Anez Fonseca, the minister of agriculture and 
animal husbandry, stated that the problem of refinancing the 
private agricultural debt, estimated at 40 billion bolivares, 
has been definitively resolved. 
  He said: "Now there is no need for concern about that 
problem. The banks are accepting a new way of treating customers 
who are behind in their payments, and there is no reason for 
anything but the optimism of 1994." 
  He explained that, in the first place, financial 
institutions 
have committed themselves to giving special treatment to 
customers in the agricultural sector who are behind in the 
repayment of their loans. He indicated that in addition to this 
there is a formula which the government is developing which has 
the objective of providing the banking sector with the necessary 
resources to compensate for these delays in the repayment of 
loans. 
  He referred to the recently established commission for the 
evaluation of agrarian reform, which Victor Gimenez Landinez 
will head, as the instrument for providing a new start to the 
Law on Agrarian Reform, making use of the economic and social 
development of the country.

<F P=106> [Interview with Minister of State Pompeyo Marquez by Santa </F>
Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO correspondent Orlando Gambos in Caracas; 
date not given -- first six paragraphs are introduction] 
  [Text] Few Venezuelans know the border between Colombia and 
Venezuela better than Pompeyo Marquez. Perhaps no one can be 
more precise and objective in his analysis of those rather tense 
2,200 km of border where, as he says, "Anything can happen at 
any time." 
  President Rafael Caldera appointed Marquez minister of 
state. 
Among the duties assigned to him was handling Venezuelan border 
issues. 
  About one week after assuming this position he said that 
negotiations with Colombia are one of the present possibilities. 
Because of this remark, untranationalist Venezuelan groups 
demanded the dismissal of Marquez, a representative of the 
Movement Toward Socialism (MAS) in the government. 
  Marquez is a man who is committed to his people and to the 
humble. He fights for them 24 hours a day. Once he looked 
forward with patience for several years for the precise moment 
to escape from the jail where he was held prisoner by guerrillas. 
  Today this old "subversive" says that in Colombia the 
guerrillas have no political objective and that they have 
violated their promise not to attack Venezuela. 
  In his two-room office there are three desks and four 
employees. (He is the fourth employee.) The office is decorated 
with a vivid poster which says that Minister of State Marquez 
spoke with an EL TIEMPO representative and said things which 
were not very comforting. 
  [Gamboa] Your appointment as minister of state, with a 
special assignment to border issues, is interpreted as a clear 
sign that President Rafael Caldera has a real interest in 
resolving existing problems with Colombia. Could this mean, 
perhaps, that the possibility of a solution is now at hand? 
  [Marquez] Yes, undoubtedly. The desire of President Caldera, 
demonstrated throughout his life, is to have harmonious 
relations with Colombia. That has been his constant purpose. It 
was he who brought Venezuela into the Andean Pact. Furthermore, 
during the election campaign he said that the border question 
would have priority and he is keeping this promise. His desire 
and will are aimed at that objective. Among my duties are not 
only matters along the 2,200 km of the tense border with 
Colombia but all questions along the entire border, which 
involve Brazil, Guayana, and the Caribbean. Venezuela should no 
longer be so active in world affairs but rather should 
concentrate on its immediate surroundings. 
  [Gamboa] Then what do you need to resolve those problems 
along what you call the tense border with Colombia? 
  [Marquez] There is a series of new and very grave 
situations. 
About a week ago I visited the Tachira area and other border 
zones. I should emphasize my conclusion that there is a total 
and permanent absence of the authority of the Colombian 
Government in the border area. This situation causes many 
problems: the activities of the guerrillas, narcotics 
traffickers, common criminals, automobile thieves, and illegal 
immigrants. These are disturbing situations. They are new, but 
there are other, old problems which have become worse. 
  [Gamboa] There is a tendency to believe that a "greater 
Colombian presence" means a greater military presence. Do you 
agree with this view? 
  [Marquez] It would be a military and a government presence. 
The fact is that there is no Colombian Government presence in 
the border area, and Venezuela suffers the consequences of this 
serious situation. I have been saying for many months, not just 
now, what I said in October 1993 in Bogota, that there is no 
Colombian Government presence there. And the Colombian 
Government should understand this situation and something which 
is much more serious: relations between the two countries are 
involved. This is a reality. I predicted what could happen with 
Venezuela if corrective action were not taken. 
  [Gamboa] And did this happen? 
  [Marquez] It went beyond all of my predictions. After my 
visit to the border my prediction did not become a reality 
because the situation is much, very much more serious because of 
the kidnappings and murders which take place on Venezuelan 
territory, because of the nonpayment for guerrilla "cattle," and 
because of the extortion which increases every day. 
  [Gamboa] What are the consequences of this situation which, 
in your view, went beyond your predictions? 
  [Marquez] A process is taking place which is contrary to the 
desired objective of economic and social development in the 
border area. Disinvestment is taking place. Land and other kinds 
of property are being abandoned, and property owners are moving 
to other areas. And this is a harsh blow against all of the 
progress made in terms of integration, although this is a 
subject for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
  In the committees on border affairs and on negotiations we 
have raised this situation with the Colombian representatives. 
They are aware that there are only three alternatives. We have 
discussed this at the negotiating table. Either there will be an 
armed conflict, or we will live in a state of permanent tension, 
or we will negotiate. There is no other alternative. Everything 
else is a version of these three solutions. Of course, I am an 
advocate of negotiations. 
  [Gamboa] Because you said that, some people asked for your 
dismissal only one week after you took this position. What will 
they say now? 
  [Marquez] This is a free country, and we already know the 
position of those groups. It annoys them that I am a supporter 
of negotiations. 
  [Gamboa] Are you suggesting that those groups support 
another 
kind of solution--armed confrontation, for example? 
  [Marquez] I am not suggesting anything. I only say that it 
irritates them that I am in favor of negotiations. 
  [Gamboa] But do you not believe that by insisting so much, 
over the long term those groups could achieve their objectives? 
  [Marquez] That will depend on me and on what I do. 
  [Gamboa] And could not the greater Colombian military 
presence which Venezuela is calling for heat up the frontier 
area even more and cause armed conflict between the two 
countries? 
  [Marquez] Not necessarily, because our activities could be 
coordinated. Meetings have been held between the military 
commands and the security organizations of the two countries. 
Agreements are urgently needed for precise coordination, because 
the escalation of guerrilla and criminal activity are generating 
honest feelings which could be exploited. The burden of what 
Venezuela receives from Colombia is too much. This is a highly 
negative burden which keeps the whole country worked up. It is 
bringing us to certain limits. 
  The situation has already gone from bad to worse. There is 
real distress, irritation, and fear, and the Venezuelan people 
feel they are victims of aggression, because the country, in 
fact, is a victim of aggression. And as Venezuelan Minister of 
the Interior Ramon Escovar Salom said, the entire country has to 
react to an act of aggression of which it is the victim. 
And it is aggression in the sense that the Colombian 
Government is contributing to it by its acts of omission. It is 
aggression by all of the elements opposing us. Even one of them 
would be serious. Altogether, the total of all of them is very 
serious. 
  [Gamboa] Perhaps Venezuela has had to look at this situation 
because, with proper control, illegal immigrants would not come 
into Venezuela, the criminals would not come, and stolen 
automobiles would not leave the country. 
  [Marquez] Yes, but that is the least of it, because those 
are 
phenomena outside our control. The fact that the guerrillas have 
moved from the cold country to the warmer areas is not a matter 
for Venezuela to decide. They cannot attack Venezuela and, above 
all, they cannot attack people who support border development. 
In the view of Pompeyo Marquez the Colombian guerrillas have no 
political objective. 
  [Gamboa] What do you think of the view that the guerrillas 
are seeking, as part of their political objective, to provoke a 
clash between the two countries so that they can benefit from 
the division between them? 
  [Marquez] That would be criminal, because a guerrilla war or 
an armed clash between Colombia and Venezuela--may it never 
happen!--would be suicide for both countries. It would be a 
horror, a catastrophe, an act of madness. 
  [Gamboa] But is this possible? 
  [Marquez] I have the feeling that the guerrillas would like 
to internationalize the problem. And this is a subject to be 
handled by the two ministries of foreign affairs, the two 
governments, or the two presidents. The guerrillas know that the 
Latin American community will not permit, for any reason, an 
armed clash between Colombia and Venezuela. 
  [Gamboa] According to your analysis, it could be thought 
that 
the delimitation of our marine and submarine boundaries could 
soon and for a temporary period be left in the background. Do 
you share this view? 
  [Marquez] Not only moved to the background but to a less 
important position. Today the key problem is that of aggression 
in many areas. We have to resolve this matter first. A popular 
song says that, "Saturday comes before Sunday." For the moment 
it is Saturday and a serious, very serious Saturday. I was truly 
worried when I returned from my trip to the border. There is no 
peace there, and peace is wanted immediately. 
  [Gamboa] Is it right to think that the people's patience is 
wearing thin to an extent which makes the situation dangerous? 
  [Marquez] Patience no longer exists. It has been worn out. 
And now I take advantage of this opportunity to repeat: the 
Colombians who support friendship with Venezuela and the 
Venezuelans who support friendship with Colombia--we should be 
very worried. There is a generalized climate of violence in 
which anything can happen, and that is what we must avoid. 
  [Gamboa] How would you summarize the situation? 
  [Marquez] It is a somber and harsh reality. It is very 
harsh, 
very dangerous, and it could have unpredictable consequences. 
Anything could happen at any time.

  [Text] About 6,000 members of Democratic Action [AD] have 
been expelled from the party after the Sectional Executive 
Committees reviewed their cases because they were nominated for 
office by other political parties in the last elections held in 
December 1993. These former members had publicly criticized the 
presidential candidate and the party. 
  This information was confirmed by official AD sources who 
explained that persons who were members of the parliamentary 
boards of other political groups were automatically suspended 
from membership. 
  The cases of other persons who campaigned against AD, either 
because they were opposed to the present, national leaders of 
the party or for other reasons, were turned over to the AD 
disciplinary tribunal, with the recommendation that they be 
expelled, as agreed to by the National Executive Council early 
in 1994. 
  It was stated on 4 March that, in addition to national AD 
leaders affected by this strong action, among whom were Juan 
Jose Delpino, Enrique Tejera Paris, Orlando Elbittar, Humberto 
D'Ascoli, and Roberto Pocaterra, the extensive list also 
included regional AD leaders such as Lucia Barrios de Miraglia, 
niece of Gonzalo Barrios, who had been president for life of AD, 
and in her own right was former governor of the State of 
Portuguesa for AD. The list also included Jose Ignacio Casal, 
former minister of development and a former AD senator, and 
Marcos Garzon Bolivar, a member of the Legislative Assembly of 
the State of Sucre.

  [Text] On 7 March the Supreme Electoral Council [CSE] 
approved partially repeating the elections for governor in the 
State of Delta Amacuro on 10 April, the same date approved for 
partial reelections in the State of Lara. It also agreed to hold 
completely new elections in the State of Amazonas on 24 April, 
as provided for in the Law on the Election and Removal of State 
Governors. 
  The action was taken with six directors of the CSE voting in 
favor and five against, with two, independent directors 
abstaining. 
  Isidro Morales Paul, president of the CSE, said that in the 
case of the State of Delta Amacuro, as well as that of the State 
of Lara, the new elections would take place in only a certain 
number of electoral districts, in accordance with the election 
results annulled by the Supreme Court of Justice. In the State 
of Amazonas the election will be completely repeated. 
  Furthermore, it was decided that the mayoral election in the 
town of San Sebastian del Tachira (State of San Cristobal) will 
be held on 17 April, while the mayoral election in the town of 
Rojas, State of Barinas, was set for 15 May. 
  Morales Paul pointed out that a special commission will be 
appointed, consisting of Rodolfo Zapata, director of data 
processing; Manuel Vasquez, director of electoral systems; and 
Carlos Flores Conde, (acting) legal consul. The commission will 
review on a case by case basis the manner in which elections are 
to be held to determine whether very short campaigns will be 
required, as well as determine the budget necessary for holding 
them. 
  Morales Paul stated that the approximate cost of these three 
elections (in the States of Delta Amacuro, Lara, and Amazonas) 
would be in the order of 40 million bolivares. He said that the 
ordinary resources of the CSE will be used, "in order to avoid 
harming the interests of the voters. We will request the 
necessary funds through the Ministry of Internal Relations and 
Congress." 
  For his part Ruben Jaen, an independent member of the CSE, 
stated that the repetition of the elections would cost in the 
order of 25 million bolivares in the State of Amazonas and 100 
million bolivares in the States of Lara and Delta Amascuro. He 
said: "The immense expenditure which is going to be incurred, in 
the absence of these new elections being entirely justified, 
should be a matter of concern to us." 
  Jaen said that he does not agree with the decision by the 
Supreme Court of Justice, although he respects it. At the same 
time he emphasized the fact that this decision of the Supreme 
Court "does not order the repetition of elections in the State 
of Lara but rather orders the CSE to determine the impact which 
such a cancellation would have on the overall result of the 
elections." 
  He pointed out that these decisions--in his view not 
supported by arguments of sufficient weight--threaten to keep 
the country in a permanent state of elections. He went so far as 
to say that: "From now on the slogan of Venezuela will not be 
that it is a country to love but a country to vote, since there 
will be very frequent elections."

<F P=106> [Article by Gabriela Zavatti] </F>
  [Text] Venezuela has joined advanced technology in 
telecommunications with the submarine cable system "Americas 1," 
the first digital fiber optic system in Latin America, which 
will permit the transmission of television, voice, and 
digitalized data, leaving behind the analogue system. 
  Laying of the first cable began yesterday, at 1400, starting 
from the shores of Camuri, on the central coast, aboard a 
British ship bound for Trinidad. The procedure will take 24 
hours, after which our country will be connected to the system, 
which will be offered to domestic and international users on 1 
September. 
  At the national level, the project is being financed by 
CANTV 
[National Telephone Company of Venezuela]. At the same time, 53 
communications companies representing 46 companies are also 
participating. Total investment amounts to $230 million; the 
project contemplates a network of 7,500 km of fiber optic cable. 
Venezuela is the second largest investor in the project, 
surpassed only by the United States. In addition, it constitutes 
one of the cable's land connections, at Camuri. The national 
telephone company plans to recover its investment in two years. 
  Manuel Caceres, CANTV's vice president for international 
operations, called the system an "information superhighway" that 
will unite the country with the rest of the world, at the 
required speed and efficiency. It will connect Venezuela with 
North America, the Caribbean, and South America, in order to 
offer digital telecommunication services between the continental 
area of the United States, St. Thomas, the Virgin Islands, 
Trinidad and Tobago, and Brazil. 
  The system has four branches. The first, from St. Thomas to 
a 
deep interconnecting point in the Atlantic at a distance of 
1,700 km to the south, was installed on 5 January 1993. The 
second was from that interconnecting point to Trinidad, over a 
distance of 583 km. The third--whose laying began 
yesterday--connects Trinidad with Camuri at a distance of 781 km 
and the last, which ties in the interconnecting point in the 
Atlantic with Fortaleza, Brazil, at a distance of 3,000 km was 
installed on 19 January 1994. 
  The "Americas 1" is only one of the projects in the 
telecommunications field; another is Columbus II, whose cable 
will be added to networks that go in the direction of Mexico, 
the United States, and Europe, reaching places as distant as 
Turkey and Israel. 
  CANTV has also planned the construction of a coastal cable 
that borders Venezuela and joins the Colombian system to have 
access to fiber optic cables of the Caribbean. 
  It will also encourage cable networks from the United States 
in the direction of Japan, where the connection with Korea, Hong 
Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore is already being negotiated. The 
most important Venezuelan telephone project in the international 
area is the fiber optic belt, which will cover the entire planet 
in the future. 
  The first of the fiber optic submarine cables that involved 
Venezuela directly was that which began to be installed 
yesterday, at a cost of $60 million. 
  This technology transmits a signal by means of a beam of 
light that has to be revitalized every 130 km with a repeater. 
This first course will have 10 repeaters. 
  The fiber optic, protected by a double armature of copper 
and 
steel, is the size of a human hair, and among its advantages is 
that of guaranteeing the greatest capacity and best quality of 
communications in traffic, high velocity of telephone 
transmissions, and of special services in voice, data, 
television, and video. 
  The cable uses two and three pairs of fiber in its first and 
second connections, respectively, to Trinidad, which will allow 
the establishment of 8,000 calls per pair each second. 
  The French firm Alcatel is responsible for manufacturing the 
cable, repeaters, and auxiliary equipment, as well as for marine 
and land supply and installation. The testing period will begin 
at the end of March in order to start commercial operations at 
the beginning of September.

  [Text] The National Telephone Company of Venezuela (CANTV) 
reported its financial performance during 1993, which registered 
a net profit during the year of 30.72 billion bolivares. This 
net profit signifies 10.6 percent profitability based on the 
firm's assets adjusted for inflation. 
  According to the company's communique, earnings were fully 
reinvested in expansion and modernization programs and 
improvement of telephone services, that have been taking place 
since privatization. A total of 69 billion bolivares was 
invested in these programs in 1993, considerably more than 
investments in 1992, which were 34.7 billion bolivares. 
  Stockholder composition remains unchanged. The transfer of 
10 
percent of the company's shares to the workers was completed in 
1993, which together with 1 percent allocated to the Incentives 
Plan, accounts for 11 percent of CANTV's shareholder capital. 
  The Republic of Venezuela owns 49 percent of the firm's 
shares through the Investment Fund of Venezuela and the Ministry 
of Transport and Communications. 
  For its part, the Venworld consortium, made up of domestic 
companies such as Electricidad de Caracas and Grupo Cima, and 
international firms such as GTE, Telefonos Internacional, and 
AT&amp;T, owns the remaining 40 percent of the shares. 
  The firm has connected more than 251,000 new clients, which 
represents an increase of 456,000 new subscribers, raising the 
telephone density of the country from eight to 11 telephones per 
100 inhabitants. 
  More than 5,000 public telephones were installed throughout 
the country and 12,000 units were replaced with new technology. 
With regard to modernization of the telephone system, the number 
of digital lines available to clients increased to 44.7 percent, 
which represents an increase over 1992, when the share was 33.8 
percent, and over 1991, when only 20 percent of the lines were 
digital. In the area of cellular telephones, the company raised 
its number of clients to 56,000 (268 percent), to finish the 
year with 77,000 clients. On the other hand, debt increased by 
42.4 billion bolivares during the year, reaching a figure of 
68.9 billion bolivares by 31 December 1993. 
  Since its privatization, the firm has generated a number of 
benefits. For one, Venezuela received $1.885 billion from the 
sale of 40 percent of its shares. 
  As a privatized firm, it has invested more than 103.7 
billion 
bolivares in the expansion and modernization of telephone 
services and more than 11.1 billion bolivares have been paid in 
taxes to the Treasury. Public spending has decreased through the 
transfer of 20,000 workers from government rolls to private 
enterprise. New sources of employment, direct and indirect, have 
been created. The firm has spent more than 20 billion bolivares 
each year for material and equipment from domestic suppliers and 
has contributed to the development of the capital market by the 
placement of commercial paper.

<F P=106> [Report by Correspondent Aurelio Garibay and special </F>
correspondents Salvador Guerrero and Jesus Aranda] 
  [Text] Tijuana, Baja California, 11 Apr -- The Office of 
the Attorney General of the Republic is examining possible ties 
between Mario Aburto and a legal political organization that 
advocates Mexico's annexation by the United States. The leader 
of that organization, the American Union Party (PUA), Dr. 
Ernesto G. Messina, denies knowing the confessed assassin of 
Luis Donaldo Colosio, but he explains: "Mario Aburto Martinez is 
a great patriot and a great Mexican because he saved the country 
from the continued dictatorship we are experiencing and which we 
are trying to disguise as a democracy." 
  Documents obtained by local reporters and special 
correspondents covering the assassination of Luis Donaldo 
Colosio Murrieta, attribute to Gabriela Gonzalez, cousin of 
Graciela Gonzalez, the alleged girlfriend of Mario Aburto, 
statements to the effect that the confessed murderer used to 
visit a white building located between Madero and Revolution 
Streets. After exhausting various possibilities involving the 
location of that building, it was decided that it was the 
building that houses the clinic of the plastic surgeon who wrote 
the book entitled Mexico-United States of America Union: 
Worldwide Revolution. 
  Approximately eight years ago, Messina became a public 
figure 
when he decided to place a U.S. flag in front of his clinic on 
the first floor of an old building on Madero Street, between 
Third and Fourth Streets; he painted the last stripe on the flag 
green. He also disclosed that his clinic was the headquarters 
of the American Union Party and shortly after that the book, the 
title of which we mentioned earlier, went on sale. Also in 1992 
Messina was involved in a controversy when "to protest against 
fiscal terrorism, anti- democracy in Mexico and police 
repression," he had a three-colored flag placed on a pole that 
projected from his clinic, but he had the national coat of arms 
removed from it. 
  This final action cost him a complaint for violating the 
symbols of the fatherland, and he had to go to the 4th Penal 
District Court every week to sign a document. He quoted 
Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa, who in his book The 
Fish in the Water justified any means of ending a 
dictatorship wherever it might exist; within this context, he 
said that Aburto did not assassinate Colosio out of hatred or 
because Luis Donaldo Colosio was the person, but because "he 
personified the dictator's unilateral designation [dedazo]." 
  Mario Aburto, he said, is a patriot because he acted against 
a dictatorship, regardless of its nature. That is what does the 
greatest harm to the country and the world. The crime Aburto 
perpetrated, he argued, is justifiable because we are living in 
a dictatorship; it would have been objectionable if he had done 
this in a democracy as happened in the case of John F. Kennedy. 
  Messina said that Colosio's confessed assassin was never a 
member of his organization, but he would have liked very much if 
he had been because "he is a brave man who put his life on the 
line. He knew he could have been killed and despite this he did 
it in view of the inefficiency of the PRI [Institutional 
Revolutionary Party] candidate's security guards." 
  Regarding the possibility that Aburto acted alone, Dr. 
Messina trusts this is so because "we should not undermine his 
discernment capabilities. As you can see, that is what was said 
of Chiapas; that they were ignorant Indians who had certain 
rights and no more, and see what happened. They organized and 
how are they now?

  [Text] Argentine President Carlos Saul Menem has received 
Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina on the first day of his 
48-hour official visit to Buenos Aires, which both parties 
described as very positive. 
  Robaina, who met with the Argentine president for almost an 
hour at the Olivos presidential residence, said that the meeting 
was useful, positive, and friendly. 
  Argentine Acting Foreign Minister Fernando Petrella, who 
also 
participated in the meeting, told the press that the Cuban 
foreign minister's visit is very important, successful, and 
significant. 
  In remarks to reporters in Buenos Aires, Robaina, who on 
Wednesday also met with the Senate president and with the Senate 
Foreign Relations Committee, said that many more things unite 
the countries than separate them. 
  According to what was learned, Menem has proposed the 
forthcoming visit to Havana of a delegation of Argentine 
businessmen to sound out current conditions for trade and 
investments in Cuba. 
  Robaina, who was declared illustrious visitor by the 
Argentine congress, added that he also met with members of the 
Argentine stock market, with members of the community of Cuban 
residents in Argentina, and with leaders of the leftist 
coalition, Grand Front. 
  Robaina's visit will conclude within the next few hours with 
a popular act in Buenos Aires organized by several groups of 
friendship and solidarity that demand the end of the U.S. 
blockade against Cuba. Robaina will leave for Paraguay on 15 
April.

  [Text] Today, the second day of his official visit to 
Chile, PRC Defense Minister Chi Haotian met with Army Commander 
General Augusto Pinochet. 
  Colonel Chi Haotian is responsible for one of the largest 
armed forces in the world. The PRC land, sea, and air forces 
comprise more than 10 million soldiers. 
  Chi Haotian came to Chile in response to an invitation by 
the 
Defense Ministry and met with Chilean Army Commander Gen. 
Augusto Pinochet. The PRC minister is accompanied by seven 
high-ranking PRC People's Liberation Army members. The two 
military commanders introduced each other to their respective 
successors [as heard] and exchanged gifts, after which they held 
a 25-minute meeting. 
  One of Chi Haotian's most important activities in Chile will 
take place this afternoon when he will visit the FAMAE [Army 
Ordnance]. There is a chance the PRC will want to purchase 
Chilean-made war materiel.

<F P=106> [News conference by President Carlos Roberto Reina and </F>
General Luis Alonso Discua Elvir, commander in chief of the 
Honduran Armed Forces, with unidentified reporters in Palmerola; 
broadcast in progress -- live or recorded] 
  [Text] [Reina] ...institutions that have social claims 
should return to the bargaining table, and from there we will 
ensure the harmony necessary for national peace. 
  [Reporter] Mr. President, I for one have faith in you. Do 
you believe there is some sort of plot to destabilize you behind 
all of this? 
  [Reina] I do not think so. What there has been is 
uneasiness, impatience, and disharmony. For example, government 
changes bring about too many expectations, and all of these 
expectations cannot be satisfied immediately. Therefore, we are 
asking for time. After we are in office for 100 days, we will 
make a public statement. I have asked the Liberal Party for a 
two-year truce to avoid all internal strife until the government 
has stabilized. 
  [Reporter] Honduran civilian workers at the U.S. base here 
are worried, and a group of them asked me to ask you whether 
this base will be closed, leaving them without work. I told 
them not to worry, that everything is fine. What is your 
opinion, Mr. President? 
  [Reina] Everything is indeed fine. The new situation in 
America and in the world makes bases like this useful in times 
of peace. Not everything can be viewed within the context of 
war. These discussions are going to produce the greatest benefit 
in terms of U.S-Honduran relations. 
  [Reporter] With all due respect, Mr. President, I want to 
ask 
General Luis Alonso Discua Elvir a question. General, does the 
kidnapping of this deputy worry you? You look worried. 
  [Discua] Yes, this situation is regrettable. Proper orders 
have already been issued to all Public Forces command posts and 
to the various Army units in the departments where they might 
have taken the deputy. All appropriate steps have been taken, 
but it is regrettable that something like this could take place. 
We had enjoyed relative calm up until now and have not had 
cases such as this one. 
  I believe I once mentioned that open borders would give us 
plenty of problems because of the entry of undesirables. I 
theorized that in the decade of the 1980's and the beginning of 
this decade, problems linked to internal conflicts in Guatemala, 
El Salvador, and Nicaragua would cause us problems if we 
maintained an open border. Honduras has remained relatively calm 
and, therefore, has kept acts such as this one more or less at 
bay. I had forewarned of this, however, and this justifies my 
concern right now. 
  [Reporter] Mr. Luis Alonso Discua, can we assume this is a 
political problem, or is it common crime? 
  [Discua] No, I do not think so. I believe it is likely to be 
common crime. We must remember that recently police and Army 
patrols have clashed with criminal gangs from Nicaragua. We 
have already had one death -- a 9th Infantry Battalion corporal 
-- and another person was wounded. This worries us, and we have 
stepped up our patrols all along the Nicaraguan border. We 
should take note of the geographical location of the kidnapping 
-- a place called Las Delicias, 15 km from San Esteban. The 
deputy was on his way to his lumberyard. It seems the 
kidnappers knew who was traveling, and they left a note trying 
to give credit to an armed political group called Los 
Chinchoneros. I tend to believe they are most likely common 
criminals. 
  [Reporter] Gen. Discua, the social segment of this 14 April 
homage to President Reina has been interrupted. We have also 
seen that in an extraordinary meeting moments ago you have also 
taken measures to protect members of the legislative branch in 
various parts of the country. 
  [Discua] Yes, I have already issued all of the necessary 
orders. I will await any information the police director, Army 
unit commanders, or Army intelligence might be able to gather. 
We want to do away with this sort of situation, which disrupts 
domestic order and creates uneasiness among the Honduran people. 
  [Report] Gen. Discua, we see that however united the Armed 
Forces stand around you as their leader, there is still 
criticism from both within and outside the service. 
  [Discua] This is understandable. We are starting a new 
government. There are great expectations. There are groups 
that want to act to grab power, and there are groups that are 
trying to detract from the institution and its leaders. This is 
normal, and I believe things will quiet down in due course. 
There are great expectations within Honduran society. The 
president has already mentioned this, and this is what is 
causing all of this unrest. 
  [Reporter] Finally, Gen. Luis Alonso Discua: These events 
are worrying the Honduran people. The president has spoken, and 
now you speak as the person who is in control of the nation's 
security. What do you recommend the Honduran family do to 
maintain calm, order, and tranquillity? 
  [Discua] The police have been alerted as well as the Army. 
This situation is regrettable, although we have already seen 
this type of thing taking place in other Central American 
countries, although not in Honduras until now. We were aware 
that this could happen in Honduras, as well as many other 
things. Although Honduras is relatively calm, we can 
nevertheless expect violence because we have open borders 
without any immigration controls on entering Honduras, and this 
has helped undesirables enter the country to carry out violent 
acts such as this one. 
  [Reporter] Gen. Discua, last night I listened to the Voice 
of 
America, and the comments made about you were excellent after 
your statements at midday. 
  [Discua] Yes, this is the way the Armed Forces feels. As its 
representative, I am clearly identified with the process that 
has been going on for a little more than a decade. The Armed 
Forces has been the main factor behind the country's return to 
legality. 
  [Reporter] VOA analysts used you as an example for all of 
Latin America. 
  [Discua] This pleases me. It inspires me to continue my 
mission -- a mission that is not easy at this moment. We have 
left behind difficult times such as the Cold War and the 
ideological war, and we are beginning a process in which the 
factors are different, events are different, and other enemies 
have to be faced. I am asking all of the Honduran people to 
give their support and all of their trust to the president. As 
he has said, these are expectations that have arisen, but we 
hope to find the proper road to the development the country 
needs so much.

  [Text] Seven hours before the awaited presidential 
announcement, President Endara has again asked the Panamanian 
people to be patient. He neither confirmed nor denied that the 
announcement he will make tonight is linked to fellow party 
members' involvement in a scandal involving duty free stores. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Is the 
announcement 
you will make tonight linked to members of your party being 
involved in the contraband scandal? 
  [Endara] I am not going to discuss that subject now. Please 
be patient, you only have to wait seven hours. 
  [Reporter] Is the situation so critical that you have called 
a special council [consejo extraordinario] meeting minutes or 
hours before the announcement? 
  [Endara] Yes, I thought it was advisable, and therefore I 
called a meeting yesterday. It was initially scheduled for 
1600, but I had to postpone it until 1700 due to a last minute 
appointment. 
  [Reporter] Is all this related to the announcement you will 
make tonight? 
  [Endara] Yes, it has to do with the announcement. 
  [Reporter] Will they accompany you? 
  [Endara] Yes, they will accompany me. [end recording]

  [Excerpt] The Shiite terrorist who came to our country 
intended not only to attack Israeli diplomatic headquarters 
here, but also to poison Israelis in the Middle East as well. 
To achieve this, he planned to gain access to large shipments 
of beef earmarked for Israel in order to poison them with a 
powerful toxic substance. 
  This warning was announced by the Israeli intelligence 
service soon after it informed the Paraguayan National Police 
that Ahmad al-Maqdaf, a fundamentalist Shiite, had arrived here 
a month ago. 
  Police Superintendent Enrique de Jesus Martinetti, director 
of the National Police Intelligence Department, confirmed this 
report and noted that the information was provided by the 
Israeli secret service. 
  The terrorist had to locate meat-packing plants that export 
meat to Israel, find a way to gain access to the products, and 
then poison them with a deadly toxic substance. 
  The consequences would have been devastating. The objective 
was to kill hundreds of Israelis in important cities in their 
country. 
  The name of the meat-packing plants are "Frigobeef," located 
in Capitan Lombardo close to Artigas, and "San Antonio" in the 
city of the same name. 
  Intelligence Department personnel went to those meat-packing 
plants and warned the managers to take the necessary precautions 
by not allowing strangers on their premises, thereby foiling any 
sabotage attempts. 
  Martinetti noted that the meat was imported by a private -- 
not government-owned -- Israeli meat-packing plant. 
  He said: "We were alerted by the Israelis and are now 
conducting inquiries. We have been informed that this Shiite, 
Ahmad al-Maqdaf, intended to poison a large shipment of beef 
that was going to Israel. We have apparently foiled this 
attempt with the help of the Israelis. Al-Maqdaf has been 
already seen in Lebanon." [passage omitted]

  [Text] President Alberto Fujimori announced today that he 
has a third letter from Shining Path leader Abimael Guzman and 
he will reveal the letter at the appropriate time. Fujimori 
also denied that a letter published in a local magazine is true. 
  [Begin recording] [Fujimori] [words indistinct] Second, I am 
keeping the third letter under lock, in a safe, and no one else 
knows the combination. I therefore do not see how the letter 
could have left my safe. Then [words indistinct] the magazine 
published a letter which is not the third letter. I deny it. 
  [Unidentified reporter] [words indistinct] 
  [Fujimori] [words indistinct] Look, here we must use 
censorship to be able to handle properly the psychological 
aspect in the struggle against the Shining Path. The handling 
of this has been good. Now no one can criticize me about why 
the letter was published or that it was a propaganda coup for 
the Shining Path. All the facts contravene this statement 
because, thanks to the way the famous letters of Guzman were 
handled, massive desertions took place -- not hundreds, but 
thousands of Shining Path members deserted. The study we made 
from the psychological point of view was correct. [end

  [Text] The Army is concerned about the situation of 11 
Uruguayan officers whose lives are at risk in Rwanda. This was 
confirmed by Lieutenant General Daniel Garcia, Army commander in 
chief, who offered details of the Uruguayan officers' situation. 
  Garcia said that all military officers are free to leave the 
area, which is considered a high-risk area. The commander then 
explained: 
  [Begin Garcia recording] Our personnel, who are deployed in 
the country's north and south and in the interior, have been 
evacuated almost completely. They are in neighboring countries 
where they are being cared for. We obtained promises of help 
there. What concerns us is the situation of the personnel in 
Kigali. We have two officers at the local airport and nine at 
UN general headquarters, located in a soccer field in Kigali. 
The field is surrounded by a UN security battalion, which is 
surrounded by a battalion of government forces who will soon be 
attacked by the [word indistinct] forces. 
  We will be in a very dangerous position if the two groups 
begin fighting there. Even if the fighting is not directed 
against us, our men may suffer the consequences. 
  We hope, however, that the situation will improve because 
despite the days of killing and given the problems there, we 
have not noted any attacks against our own people. Except for 
the hostility against the Belgian forces, there have not been 
any problems with the other forces. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Article by Ana Diaz] </F>
  [Text] China is a very important client for sales of 
Orimulsion (R) and negotiations with Bitumenes del Orinoco 
(Bitor), PDVSA's [Venezuelan Petroleum, Inc.] marketing 
subsidiary for the fuel, have been concluded with agreement on 
the export to China of 5 million tons a year over the next five 
years, according to Carlos Borregales, the company's director. 
Beginning in 1995, the thermoelectric plant at Daga will use 1.2 
million tons of the fuel. 
  Borregales, together with the president of Intevep 
[Institute 
of Venezuelan Petroleum Technology], Gustavo Inciarte, and the 
manufacturing director of Venezuelan Petroleum, Otto Martinez, 
explained to the Finance Commission of the Senate, chaired by 
Virgilio Avila Vivas, measures taken by Venezuela to prevent 
protectionist treatment against Orimulsion (the United Kingdom) 
and reformulated gasolines (the United States). The Bitor 
executive was optimistic that the fuel's classification as a 
natural bitumen would prevail at the Council on Customs Matters 
that will meet for four weeks beginning 4 April. 
  The classification of Orimulsion (R) as a natural bitumen 
has 
an excellent chance of being approved by the Council on Customs 
Matters, especially as the organization approved the technical 
report last week. The thermoelectric generating fuel, a product 
of Venezuelan technology by Intevep, would thus not be subject 
to taxes. 
  About 100 countries will participate in the meeting, of 
which 
74 have the right to a voice and a vote, Venezuela being one of 
those with the right only to a voice. According to Borregales, 
the report with the technical data to support Orimulsion's 
classification as a natural bitumen is being sent to embassies 
for transmittal to their governments, so that they may have 
advance knowledge of the material prior to the April meeting. 
  Venezuela will request that Orimulsion be addressed during 
the second week of the council's meeting. Classification as a 
natural bitumen has an excellent probability of being approved 
by the 74 members of the council, among them the United States, 
Japan, Korea, and several European countries that gave their 
approval during the technical-scientific phase last week. 
Classification of Orimulsion as a natural bitumen (code 2714) is 
an important step in marketing the fuel in the old continent 
without facing protectionist barriers, halting the United 
Kingdom's offensive. 
  On 31 January 1994, the United Kingdom announced the 
application of a $10 per ton tax on the fuel next June, if the 
council decided to classify Orimulsion as a refined petroleum 
product (code 2715). Great Britain had pressed for the fuel to 
be classified a refined product during 1993, and that position 
halted negotiations for the sale of 3 million additional tons to 
major British electric companies. 
  Pressure from the United Kingdom resulted in Orimulsion's 
production at less than installed capacity (5 million tons) in 
Morichal. This caused losses to Bitor, said Borregales, although 
the firm's cash flow last year closed in balance. 
  Despite British pressure, the natural bitumen classification 
has majority support in the European Community because, of the 
76 votes that the 12 member countries possess, 43 are favorable 
to Venezuela and 33 are opposed. Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, 
Denmark, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Belgium, with five, 
10, eight, five, five, two, five, and three votes, respectively, 
support Venezuela, while Great Britain, Germany, France (10 
votes each), and Ireland (three votes) are opposed. 
  Orimulsion exports have been growing, and while sales 
reached 
721,000 tons in 1992, last year they totalled 2.79 million tons 
with a value of $65,676,600 at a promotional price of $23.54 per 
ton. PDVSA's Business Plan 1993-2002 provides for the export of 
24 million tons of the fuel during the final year, with 
investments of $1.3 billion.

strengthen relations with Latin America and the Caribbean. 
  The Cuban minister, who was declared illustrious guest of

has never felt less alone than at present, and, as illustration, 
pointed out that Cuba already maintains diplomatic relations 
with 146 countries.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Roberto Cavada -- recorded] </F>
  [Text] On 14 April, Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina 
addressed the Foreign Relations Committee of the Argentine 
Chamber of Deputies, where he again found a receptive audience 
when speaking of Cuba's reality. The meeting included those who 
adhere to campaigns to discredit Cuba on the basis of highly 
manipulated and politicized issues. In this regard, Robaina 
stressed that Cuba is willing to listen to any idea or opinion, 
but that it cannot allow anyone to decide Cuba's destiny and 
future, for this lies only in the hands of the Cuban people. 
  The issue of the Cuban debt to Argentina, estimated at $1 
billion, was also discussed during Robaina's meeting with Carlos 
Sanchez, first vice economic minister [name and title as heard], 
and a large group of businessmen from various sectors. Regarding 
Cuba's debt, Robaina stressed that Cuba does not currently have 
the money or enough products with which to pay its debt. 
However, Cuba does not intend to pay its debt to Argentina or 
any other country by making an issue of it. Robaina added that 
Cuba believes the profits from foreign investments in sectors 
that generate exports is one way to pay the debt. He added that 
Cuba truly wishes to repay its debt and to create a climate in 
which to bilaterally take things one step at a time and with 
both feet firmly planted on the ground. 
  Robaina's agenda also included a meeting with former 
President Raul Alfonsin, and friends of Cuba who met to express 
their support and solidarity with the Cuban people.

  [Text] Cuban Foreign Trade Minister Ricardo Cabrisas stated 
that the U.S. blockade against Cuba is an archaic Cold War 
policy and contrary to the trade agreements established in 
Marrakech, Morocco. During an intervention at the ministerial 
meeting of the Uruguayan Round of General Accord on Tariffs and 
Trade [GATT], Cabrisas pointed out that negotiating under the 
principles of the multilateral system does not seem to be on the 
U.S. Government's agenda regarding Cuba. He added that the U.S. 
blockade limits the positive effects of the Uruguayan Round for 
Cuba by keeping one of the most important markets of the world 
closed to Cuban exports.

  [Text] The British (Tour World) company will begin 
operations in Cuba in early May at Santa Lucia Beach on the 
northern coast of Camaguey. This is Great Britain's fifth 
largest tourism company in terms of the number of people it 
serves. The company will have 140 rooms in the four-star Cuatro 
Vientos and Caracol Hotels. The British tourists will join those 
who prefer the attractions of Santa Lucia beach, the bulk of 
whom come from Germany, Canada, The Netherlands, and Italy. 
  Felix Moreno, regional manager of the Cubanacan S.A. 
Corporation, stressed that there was an increase in the number 
of tourists who visited this region of Camaguey in April. This 
region contains a little over 25 percent of Cuba's beaches.

  [Text] Havana, 14 Apr (AFP) -- The free sale of medicines, 
with the sole exception of oral contraceptives, will be banned 
in Cuba, according to a drastic plan drafted by the Public 
Health Ministry which AFP managed to read. 
  A document entitled "Plan for the Improvement of the 
National 
Medicine Program" also indicates that aspirin and six other home 
remedies usually found in first aid kits will only be sold by 
minimal annual quotas and not in any pharmacy. Each Havana 
resident will be entitled to 40 aspirins each year, with 
one-quarter of the total to be distributed every three months. 
Rural residents will be able to cure fewer migraines, because 
they will only be allotted five aspirins per trimester. 
  An aromatic balsam and another balsam used as an inhalant, 
three skin disinfectants, and sodium bicarbonate complete the 
seven medicines that may be purchased without prescription, but 
only at the pharmacy closest to home. Quotas assigned to each 
family are usually minimal: 30 grams of ointments and balsams 
and three small bottles of disinfectant for external use each 
year. In comparison, the yearly quota for bicarbonate per 
family seems to be more generous: 160 grams. 
  Should they be available at pharmacies, another 64 
medicines, 
which used to be freely sold, will now be available under 
medical prescription, but will be under multiple controls 
established by new regulations issued by the Public Health 
Ministry. These 64 medicines to be sold only by prescription 
involve a visit to a doctor and a visit to the pharmacy later. 
The inevitable delay in obtaining some of these medicines (for 
example, Kaoenterin, a diarrhea suppressant) will place ill 
persons in embarrassing situations. It seems that an equally 
deplorable possibility, but the opposite situation, will be 
created by the need to buy laxatives and ointments by 
prescription to relieve hemorrhoids under prescription. 
  A similar labyrinth will face those who will undoubtedly 
have 
to urgently buy lotions to combat head lice and "crab lice" 
[pediculos pubis] (pediculosis). Other medicines that must be 
sold by prescription are: antacids, antihistamines, febrifuges, 
antimycotics [antimicoticos], digestive medicines, vitamins, 
hydrogen peroxide, and distilled water for shots. 
  The Public Health Ministry deemed as obsolete the active 
elements [principios activos) of 21 medicines that were 
eliminated, including milk of magnesia and lime flowers. It 
also added a list of medicines that are available in Cuba such 
as garlic syrup, pumpkin emulsion, guava powder, onion creme, 
fennel tincture, cress sachets, polen capsules, and various 
kinds of phyto-medicines. 
  It also notes that an oral home serum (water, sugar, salt, 
and lemon drops) is also available for dehydration cases.

<F P=106> [Report by Camaguey correspondent Lucilo Tejera] </F>
  [Text] In Camaguey, Nelson Torres, member of the Politburo 
and sugar industry minister, has issued a call to those 
participating in the current sugar harvest to make a greater 
effort during this phase of the harvest. April is very important 
to the objective of increasing the quantities of raw product 
produced, and May must be the month in which operations are 
concluded, although a number of mills may continue to grind in 
June, said Torres during an analysis of the harvest in Camaguey, 
Las Tunas, and Holguin. 
  He stressed that a greater effort is necessary on the days 
when there is activity, and pointed out that it would be a good 
idea to increase the direct transportation of cane from the 
fields where it is being harvested to the mills. He also called 
attention to the fact that it is indispensable to apply 
alternatives at each place to reduce dependency on electric 
power provided by the national system, because during recent 
working days, collection centers were affected by interruptions 
in electric service. 
  During the analysis meeting, which was presided over by 
Carlos Lage, member of the Politburo and secretary of the 
executive committee of the Council of Ministers, it was reported 
that Las Tunas obtained the best results in principal indicators 
during the period 1-10 April, pushing Camaguey into second 
place. Camaguey had been in first place.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
fileworthy reports on economic developments carried on Havana 
radio and television in Spanish between 8 and 12 April. 
  Radio Rebelde reports at 1700 GMT on 8 April that Cubana de 
Aviacion has initiated flights to Caracas with a stopover in 
Bogota in an effort to enhance tourism. Tour operators Sol y Sun 
[as heard] Agency from Cubana de Aviacion, Nirvana from 
Venezuela, and G.M. Tropical from Colombia are taking part in 
this operation. 
  Rebelde also reports that during the recent Berlin 
International Tourism Conference, industry executives asserted 
that this year Cuba is one of the prime tourist destinations in 
Latin America and the Caribbean. To handle the projected 
increased in visitors, Cuba's Gaviota tourism enterprise is 
planning to open two new four-star hotels, a 260-room hotel in 
Varadero and a 242-room hotel in Holguin, and plans to build 
more facilities. 
  Cuba Vision Network at 2220 GMT on 8 April reports that the 
Sancti Spiritus paper factory has resumed activities upon the 
arrival in the country of the necessary raw materials. The 
factory will this month begin production of 2,000 tons of paper 
designated for that production facing paper deficits, such as 
cigarette boxes and school notebooks. Some 400 tons will be 
earmarked for a match factory. This year 19,000 tons will be 
earmarked for exports. Only one-third of the factory's capacity 
will be exploited, in joint operations with Latin American and 
European nations. Sugarcane bagasse is also used as raw material. 
  In the same newscast, Cuba Vision reports that the operator 
of a sugarcane harvesting machine has cut 1 million arrobas of 
cane during this harvest. The operator is the first woman in the 
country to cut 1 million arrobas; she averaged 10,000 arrobas 
daily despite continuous mechanical problems. 
  Tele Rebelde and Cuba Vision Networks at 0000 GMT on 9 April 
report that the steam-driven trains of the Orlando Gonzalez 
industrial complex in Ciego de Avila are the first of their type 
in the country to run on emulsified fuel and magnetized water. 
This experimental mixture has been used in the boilers of an 
asphalt plant in this province. Use of the emulsion has saved 43 
tons of fuel. After 100 days of harvest, all locomotive engine 
parts are perfectly clean, which will result in great savings 
both in fuel and in labor. The report adds that the Sugar 
Industry Ministry has 200 of these locomotives. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1155 GMT on 9 April reports that the 
workers 
of the Hotel Caracol in Santa Lucia have decided to give health 
institutions all the hard currency they receive in tips during 
the month of April. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1700 GMT on 9 April reports that the German 
airline LTU will increase activity in Cuba. LTU expects to 
double the number of tourists -- currently 26,000 a year -- and 
plans to establish flights to Ciego de Avila in the near future. 
  Radio Rebelde adds that farmers in Matanzas have planted 109 
caballerias of miscellaneous crops during March. The spring 
planting program comprises 900 caballerias of corn, pumpkin, 
cucumber, yucca, yams, and plantains. Specialists stress that 
fulfilling the planting program is vital to meeting the needs of 
the people. 
  Radio Rebelde also reports that in San Cristobal 
Municipality 
in Pinar del Rio, the 93-94 sugar harvest is experiencing 
difficulties. A provincial expert adds that measures had to be 
taken to overcome delays, such as activating the Jose Marti Mill 
to help the 30 November Mill meet the sugar production goal, and 
mobilizing over 1,000 workers. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1700 GMT on 11 April reports that more than 
120,000 poles of tobacco have been collected in Holguin, while 
peasants have already planted 23 caballerias of tobacco. This 
plantation is below its established goal because of bad weather. 
In San Juan y Martinez, Pinar del Rio Province, the municipal 
board has termed positive the results obtained in tobacco 
production by more than 100 producers who, for the first time, 
have received land to enlarge their plantations. 
  Radio Reloj at 1942 GMT on 11 April reports that Mexican 
Ambassador Carlos Tello Macias has presented a humanitarian 
donation to Raul Taladrid, vice president of the State Committee 
for Economic Cooperation. The 10-ton donation includes food 
stuffs such as rice, beans, and cooking oil, and cleaning items 
such as bleach and detergents, powder, and diapers to be 
distributed to the Carlos J. Finlay and Luis Diaz Soto Hospitals 
in Havana. 
  Radio Rebelde at 0900 GMT on 12 April reports that last year 
and during the first quarter of 1994, the Indalecio Monteco 
Metalworking Company in Ciego de Avila assembled 7,800 bicycles 
produced by the Caibarien Factory in Villa Clara. The bicycles 
are to be distributed among peasants and workers in Ciego de 
Avila. Through this effort, almost all peasant members of the 
Ciego de Avila cooperatives have bicycles. 
  Radio Progreso at 1100 GMT on 12 April reports that in Ciego 
de Avila the Agricultural Shops Enterprise has repaired 183 
large and small irrigation pumps over the past 60 days. Last 
year the Agriculture Ministry received only 24 of these pumps 
essential to agriculture. This company is becoming more 
productive and efficient by following guidelines proposed by the 
workers parliaments. 
  In the same newscast, Radio Progreso adds that 17,000 
Agriculture Ministry tractors and equipment are being serviced 
at ministry repair shops under a maintenance and repair program 
running through October. According to the director of the 
Agriculture Ministry mechanization department, 15 to 20 percent 
of machines presently out of commission will be recovered.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
fileworthy reports on economic developments carried on Havana 
radio and television in Spanish between 12 and 14 April. 
  Radio Reloj at 1945 GMT on 12 April reports that the goal of 
Havana Province's Agro-94 is to harvest 1.5 million quintals of 
tubers and vegetables. Potatoes constitute 900,000 quintals of 
this figure. A portion of this amount is to be distributed 
directly to the population and the rest stored in refrigerated 
facilities. The breakdown of the expected harvest is 190,000 
quintals of carrots, 240,000 quintals of cabbage, and 130,000 
quintals of plantains . 
  Cuba Vision Network at 0000 GMT on 13 April reports that an 
animal feed factory, the first in Cuba, is under construction in 
Primero de Enero Municipality, Ciego de Avila Province. The 
factory, which is 60 percent completed, uses Cuban technology 
and will produce 750 tons of feed daily. The product will be 
enriched with oils and honey, producing a Cuban feed that will 
serve, basically, to replace imported feed for poultry and pigs 
in Ciego de Avila Province. 
  In the same newscast, Cuba Vision Network reports that a 
bridge that is almost finished along the Caibarien-Cayo Santa 
Maria causeway is considered the biggest of its kind in Cuba. 
The bridge is over 7 meters high and 350 meters long and is 
expected to be finished by 21 April. 
  Radio Reloj at 1934 GMT on 13 April reports that the 
fishfarming center in Cumanayagua Municipality, Cienfuegos 
Province, has promised to produce over 7 million tilapia fry by 
the end of this year to be sown at dams and minidams. The radio 
also reports, from Cienfuegos, that a 2.5-megawatt 
turbogenerator has been installed at the Espartaco complex in 
Palmira. 
  Radio Reloj at 1940 GMT on 13 April reports that 250,000 
campers have used campsites from January to date. During a press 
conference, Francisco Rodriguez, operations director of the 
National People's Camping Enterprise [Empresa Nacional de 
Campismo Popular], announced that, with a view to improving 
campsites, the price of lodgings and equipment rentals will be 
raised as of 1 May. 
  Radio Reloj at 1943 GMT on 13 April reports that 130,000 
poles of tobacco have been collected to date by the cooperatives 
and small farmer sectors in Los Palacios, Pinar del Rio 
Province, a quantity that represents 50 percent of the plan for 
the current harvest. 
  Radio Rebelde at 2300 GMT on 13 April reports that Cuba 
expects to be ready to test a Cuban-made cholera vaccine in some 
Latin American country by the end of the year. Cuba is employing 
genetic engineering to produce the vaccine. 
  Radio Rebelde at 0900 GMT on 14 April carries an 1-minute 
interview with Colonel (Rene Alvarez Perez), chief of the Giron 
de Victoria unit in Havana Province, who says that members of 
the unit are supporting the potato harvest and that 630,000 
quintals of potatoes and 29,000 quintals of carrots have been 
harvested. The unit has surpassed the original objective of 
500,000 quintals of potatoes. This force of approximately 1,800 
men has worked in six municipalities. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1700 GMT on 14 April reports that the 
British tourist operation company Sun World will tender its 
letter of credentials in Cuba to begin operations on the Santa 
Lucia beach in Camaguey Province. It intends to bring the first 
tourists by next month. The same report adds that at the close 
of the first quarter this year, as compared to the same period 
the previous year, Cubanacan's regional administration has 
reported an increase in the number of tourists brought to this 
northern coast beach. 
  The same newscast reports that the National Poultry Complex, 
the CAN, is celebrating its 30th anniversary. Agriculture 
Minister Alfredo Jordan Morales said that the CAN represents an 
example of organization, integrity, and efficiency. Despite 
difficulties affecting the supply of raw materials and other 
resources necessary for egg and poultry production, egg 
production has increased during the first quarter of this year. 
The CAN is capable of processing its own raw materials and to 
carry out complete production. 
  Radio Rebelde in the same newscast reports that 
approximately 
500,000 tons of potatoes have been harvested in Matanzas 
Province with 15 caballerias yet to be harvested. This forecasts 
a lower result than expected. The setbacks this time are related 
to the appearance of insects. In Las Tunas Province, 1,240 
caballerias of sugarcane were weeded during the past 10 days and 
50 caballerias of cane were planted.

<F P=106> ["Straight Talk" program by host Osvaldo Rodriguez of </F>
JUVENTUD REBELDE and guest Eloy Concepcion of the weekly 
newspaper TRABAJADORES -- live or recorded] 
  [Text] [Rodriguez] Over the past few days, Cuba has once 
again experienced difficulties stemming mostly from the energy 
problem. We have especially been experiencing the effects of new 
blackouts, an increasing number of blackouts. This could perhaps 
create the false notion that the economy is regressing again, 
that we are doomed to a recessive situation. 
  I think our listeners deserve an explanation of our economic 
situation, that our economy is still going through the stages of 
a downward trend, but which can now be considered over. There 
are signs that the recovery process can begin at any moment. 
  Today I invited Eloy Concepcion of the weekly nespaper 
TRABAJADOES to discuss this subject with me. Eloy, take the 
floor, please. 
  [Concepcion] Well, you painted one situation. I think the 
visible face of an economic situation in a given country is 
often reflected in those things that affect us more directly. 
Unquestionably, the energy crisis is the essential point here 
and can reflect the country's situation, whether we are well or 
not economically, because of the implications it might have on 
our technological development, on our social and economic 
infrastructure, et cetera. 
  Now, independent of some details concerning the blackouts 
you 
mentioned, we must insist on some ideas that can somehow explain 
the current situation. I am one of those who have always 
expressed -- and last year when the situation was very serious 
and spiraling, especially in 1993 when the economic situation 
was very difficult -- I expressed a super optimism. And today I 
want to ratify this optimism based on some elements and facts 
showing that our economy is beginning a slight and slow recovery 
process. 
  As everyone knows, for instance, sugar is our main source of 
currency. The sugar harvest for a long time will be our main 
source of currency. And the current harvest, Osvaldo, is being 
carried out under very difficult circumstances. We are all aware 
that there are no spare parts, no rubber belts for tractors and 
harvesters, but that the workers have been very creative and 
have made tremendous efforts to fulfill our harvest goals. 
  A sugarcane recovery plan was also established, but was not 
fully concluded due to logical problems, such as the lack of 
fertilizers that are necessary for increasing the production 
levels. Fertilizers are necessary and they must be paid for in 
hard currency. We must also have fuel to run the pumps to 
irrigate the areas equipped with irrigation systems, et cetera. 
But I do have an idea that this year's harvest will be a bit 
better than last year's. This gives us another example of the 
resistance of our people and of the country under adverse 
situations, in the wake of the collapse of the socialist bloc, 
namely the USSR, and especially because of the Torricelli Law 
which seeks to torment and humiliate us. This is the first 
element we must consider. 
  [Rodriguez] I think it is also important to consider the 
viewpoint of the common citizen who has no access to the 
macroeconomic data and who is not informed about economic 
issues. The economy is improving or worsening to the extent that 
the situation also improves or worsens in his house, in his 
homelife. Society will experience the same with those phenomena 
we encounter on the streets called service, transport, and 
commerce. The common citizen will consider that those things are 
improving or worsening in accordance with the quality of those 
services. For this reason, many believe that the increased 
number of blackouts is a sign of a deteriorating economy. 
  Eloy, you also wanted to talk about sugarcane and the sugar 
harvest situation. Well, everyone is aware of the material 
difficulties we are experiencing because last year we had the 
same problem. Next year I do not think the situation will be the 
same. But I think there are other aspects to consider positive 
within the Cuban economy. We must mention, for instance, the 
prospects in the sugar industry, and without talking about 
triumphalism, without saying that we have solved the problem, or 
that we have found the formula to solve this problem, we must 
first reach a consensus that we are on a path that will lead us 
to an improving situation. 
  [Concepcion] Yes, upon conclusion of the harvest, or even 
before concluding the harvest throughout the country, more 
sugarcane is being planted in clean areas, and I would say that 
in this special period, the efforts being made are yielding very 
encouraging results. 
  Osvaldo, there is another element that is likewise 
important: 
Tobacco harvest this year was the best in years. This is a point 
to be considered because it will also give us the possibility of 
obtaining currency at levels higher than last year when the 
harvest was affected by the Storm of the Century and by other 
adverse weather conditions. 
  [Rodriguez] We have to clarify that the profits from this 
tobacco, which still needs to be processed, will be seen by the 
end of 1995 or perhaps the beginning of 1996, due to tobacco's 
manufacturing requirements -- either made into cigars, or sold 
in bulk. This crop's profit will be seen in 1995 or 1996. 
  [Concepcion] Yes. However, these are realities, rather than 
prospects. 
  Within these prospects we have tourism, which, as everyone 
knows, has experienced an increase of more than 30 percent in 
hard currency earnings. We can also mention the creation of the 
Basic Cooperative Production Units, which are quickly solving, 
more than only the food needs of 4 or 5 million Cubans linked to 
them -- 1 million direct workers and 3 or 4 million relatives. 
We can also mention the issue of the decriminalization of 
dollars [as heard], which, however, creates the well-known 
problems of privilege and inequitable situations. However, we 
cannot deny that the decriminalization of the dollar has also 
been an element that has helped reactivate certain elements of 
the economy. There are also the joint enterprises. There are 
over 130 of these contracts, which are reactivating our economy. 
  [Rodriguez] Allow me to interrupt. I believe you have 
forgotten certain things that represent significant 
developments: One is oil extraction in Cuba. Last year, we 
attained a record level of 1.1 million tons. This year, oil 
workers began January with a very high level which might 
forecast the breaking of last year's production record. Also, 
the price of nickel on the international market has improved. We 
have to add that biotechnology has been consolidating certain 
products and above all, has been gaining a space in the market. 
Recently, there have been reports about Cuban vaccines in 
certain Latin American countries and the welcome they have 
received in certain countries. 
  Eloy, we already discussed power outages as a symptom some 
people -- I believe many people -- see as a new deterioration of 
the national economic situation. I believe we have to discuss 
this further. 
  [Concepcion] My personal opinion is that in the case of 
power 
outages, there is a lack of information, or there is not enough 
information. 
  [Rodriguez] I agree. 
  [Concepcion] Those dry, brief notes from the Electric 
Enterprise regarding a situation that affects and hurts the 
entire population, are unacceptable. I believe our people are 
capable -- they have proven so -- of undertaking the greatest 
risks and difficulties so long as they are for independence, the 
preservation of the fatherland, and the accomplishments of 
socialism. I believe the people deserve everyday more, better, 
and more detailed information. As far as I know, there are 
breakdowns at electric plants due to the use of Cuban oil. Our 
oil is rather heavy and loaded with sulfur and this damages the 
entire national electric system. This is one factor. 
  The other is that many times the people complain that the 
power is turned off in some regions and not in others. Yet, no 
explanations are given. There are places where the power is 
maintained because there is a hospital or neurology center which 
needs the power to continue to operate and so their equipment is 
not damaged. There are also certain neighborhoods where we find 
this happening and this irritates the people. This can very well 
be solved by an explanation of the problem to the people. I do 
not believe the Electric Enterprise should be happy with a stark 
three- line note once a week saying the outages will occur here 
and there and there. Our people are not sheep. Our people are a 
revolutionary people who have proven themselves for years, who 
are capable of resisting and enduring the worst limitations so 
long as they save the Revolution and the fatherland. However, 
the people have to be kept well informed. They need to receive 
all the details and information so they are able to understand 
and better resist. 
  [Rodriguez] I believe that you have expressed the 
irritation of the people. 
  If he has been excessive, it is because of that. He is 
expressing the feelings of the Cuban people. I agree with you. I 
have discussed this with comrades from the Electric Enterprise. 
One of the excuses given is the highly technical details of the 
explanation. I believe that we ought to find a clear way of 
explaining to the people the difficulties at the electric 
plants, which are not always a lack of fuel. There is also lack 
of maintenance due to material difficulties. Last year, the 
electric plants should have received investments or undergone 
maintenance that requires investments of approximately $60 
million. However, I believe that what was invested was minimal. 
Therefore, the problems accumulate. 
  [Concepcion] We also need to know that the outages are going 
to continue to a greater or lesser degree. The outages recently 
increased because of a known situation, not sufficiently 
explained, but known -- difficulties with fuel supplies from 
Russia. Russia is now saying that the fuel accords might be 
fulfilled. We hope so. 
  I believe that this situation will undoubtedly improve in 
the 
coming months. However, we need to clearly understand, and I 
believe the people do, that outages will continue -- perhaps for 
four hours, perhaps five -- until the Cuban economy becomes 
stabilized, so that we can restructure the entire national 
economy including all technological resources, which are high 
consumers of fuel. This will take years. 
  [Rodriguez] To this, we must add that what has been stated 
about Colombia's offer to sell oil to Cuba is on the basis of 
world market trading, on the basis of liquid payment, or simply 
a barter by which we sell to Colombia and buy oil from Colombia. 
However, this does not mean that great amounts of Colombian oil 
are going to be received, nor will it arrive on credit. 
  We need to understand that in Colombia we are going to have 
the advantage of not having middlemen between the Cuban 
Government and Colombia's oil company. Nowadays, when purchasing 
oil on the international market, one needs otherwise to resort 
to middlemen.
