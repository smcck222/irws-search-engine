  [Text] The Cuban Electric Union reported yesterday that the 
continuous and lengthy power cuts in the country are caused by 
serious generation problems. 
  Officials from the electric union last night reported that 
from a total generation capacity of 3,132 mw throughout the 
country, more than half is produced by thermoelectric plants 
built in Russia or Czechoslovakia. The thermoelectric plants in 
Santa Cruz del Norte and Mariel in the western part of the 
country, and Rente in Santiago de Cuba were manufactured by the 
Soviet Union, while the Nuevitas thermoelectric plant, which has 
a generation capacity of 550 mw, was built in Czechoslovakia. 
  Electric Union officials said Cuba has not received any 
spare 
parts for these plants since 1990, and only since May 1993 has 
the country has been able to maintain a certain level of spare 
parts for programmed maintenance operations and repair of 
unexpected breakdowns. 
  Right now, from that total generation capacity, 570 mw are 
affected by the plants' maintenance problems, 821 mw by 
breakdowns, and 372 mw by generation limitations -- the 
equipment operating at lower capacity. 
  Some spare parts and other meterials necessary for a 
maintenance program are already in the country, while others are 
about to be acquired. These spare parts will allow recovery of 
the generation capacity of these plants. 
  Despite our economic limitations, the country has provided 
the necessary resources to make this inevitable investment, in 
an effort to solve the current problems as soon as possible. The 
lengthy power cuts will begin a gradual reduction process 
throughout the country, to the extent that the maintenance 
programs required by these plants are fulfilled.

<F P=106> [Second of a series of reports by journalist Carlos Santana </F>
Ojeda on unlicensed private taxi drivers in Havana; date not 
given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Santana] Yesterday, I presented the reasons and 
means of operation used by drivers of private cars who taxi for 
tourists. Today we will hear from their counterparts. We will 
hear the feelings of the Turistaxi drivers with whom I spoke to 
learn how they are affected by the illegal activity of these 
so-called pirates. 
  [First taxi driver] A lot. They are affecting our work. 
  [Santana] Why? 
  [First driver] Because they do whatever they want and charge 
less than we do. It affects us in regard to the fare because our 
fare is higher. When the tourist sees that we charge 15, and 
that they charge five or seven, they go with them, as can be 
expected. 
  [Santana] How is it with prices and distances? 
  [First driver] Our distances are gauged by a taxi meter, 
which begins with one peso or one dollar. Each kilometer is 35 
cents. 
  [Santana] Are you also a taxi driver here, comrade? 
  [Second taxi driver] Yes. 
  [Santana] How much are you affected by their activities? 
  [Second driver] I would say our business is affected by 50 
percent in one day. 
  [Santana] Do many tourists use your services? 
  [Second driver] Well, this tourist who is approaching us, 
for 
example, is Mexican and is being controlled by these illegal 
drivers because he has come to Cuba several times. That tourist 
likes to visit the prostitutes, and since he has been here 
before, already has directions. As a matter of fact, they even 
pick him up at the airport. We can no longer count on that 
tourist's business. 
  [Santana] According to some interviews I had yesterday, 
these 
illegal drivers say they give better service to the tourists. Is 
that true? 
  [Second driver] That is not true because we are prepared. We 
have even been trained. We are at the political level in 
language and tourism. We have gone to school for that. 
  [Santana] Is the tourist more secure with you than with 
those 
illegal drivers? 
  [Second driver] You want to know if the tourist is safer 
with 
us? With us, the tourist's life is insured. If anything happens 
to the tourist while he is with us, he has no problem because 
his life is insured. Furthermore, if the car breaks down, within 
seconds he has another car because we have a plant. These cars 
are new and are much more comfortable than those of the illegal 
drivers. 
  [Santana] Do you wait for the tourist to come to you or do 
you go to the tourist? 
  [Second driver] Well, we are lined up in front of the hotel. 
When the tourist leaves the hotel, he can see our cars, which 
are right in front of the hotel. What happens is that the 
illegal drivers enter the lobby. If he can enter, he controls 
the tourist and we can no longer count on that tourist. As a 
matter of fact, this type of illegal activity, which has 
increased lately, has, or we believe has, a contact in the 
hotel. They enter the hotel, make contact with the tourist, make 
an offer to the tourist, which is half of what we charge. The 
tourist does not think about accidents or any other situation, 
that if anything were to happen they would not be able to claim 
anything from the state. On the other hand, if they are in one 
of our taxis, they can demand insurance from the state. Besides, 
we are professional drivers who are prepared for this type of 
work. 
  [Santana] How do you think this situation can be resolved 
-- by lowering the fares of the taxis? 
  [Third taxi driver] We believe the state must take measures 
regarding this situation. What kind of measures? Not by fining 
Cuban pesos because after making the conversion, if they are 
fined 100 pesos, it is $1. I therefore believe they should be 
fined in hard currency because they are working with hard 
currency. The first time, they should be fined $50; and the 
second time, their car should be confiscated. There are many 
problems here regarding the problem with cars. 
  [Santana] In this case, how would the problem be solved if 
this action were not taken? 
  [Third driver] The problem of our fares is already being 
analyzed. It is being reviewed to be more competitive. 
  [Fourth taxi driver] I believe our fares are a little high 
in 
comparison with capitalist countries. The tourism that comes 
here is generally from Latin America. In Canada, for example, a 
tourist is charged a high fare, but the salaries and the living 
standards of those countries is superior to Latin American 
countries. 
  [Santana] Has this been discussed? 
  [Fourth driver] Yes, all this was mentioned at the workers 
parliament. 
  [Santana] How do you and how will you defend your work from 
the illegal drivers? 
  [Fourth driver] We have already spoken to them and told them 
they cannot work here because it is affecting our work and is 
affecting the state. While we see them around here, they are 
going to have serious problems with us. We are not going to 
allow that here. 
  [Third driver] I wanted to point out that the problem that 
our comrade mentioned of lowering the fares -- because they are 
a bit high -- does not mean that they are going to be lowered to 
compete with those illegal drivers, because in this case there 
is no competition. We are a serious activity and they are people 
who are not serious in this aspect. Furthermore, they push 
propaganda. They tell tourists: Do not ride in those cars 
because they are too expensive and [words indistinct] by the 
police. They even do that. It is unfair and incorrect. 
  [Santana] Well, that is the opinion of the drivers of 
Turistaxi regarding the activity of the so-called pirates. But 
what do the tourists and the people on the street think about 
this? That will be covered in our next report. Thank you.

<F P=106> [From the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Commerce ministers from 125 countries started a 
four-day meeting in Marrakech, Morocco, which will close with 
the signing of the GATT. This document is over 20,000 pages 
long and considered the most important commercial agreement in 
history. Commerce Secretary Jaime Serra Puche is representing 
Mexico. 
  Moroccan Crown Prince Sidi Mohamed delivered a welcoming 
speech to open the meeting, which will conclude Friday with the 
signing of the final draft of the GATT. The crown prince 
arrived at 1000 sharp, representing his father, Hassan II. More 
than 120 representatives of GATT member countries arrived 
simultaneously at the Marrakech Convention Center to participate 
in the final meetings. The Mexican delegation was among them. 
  Speaking shortly before the plenum, Jaime Serra Puche, 
Mexico's secretary of commerce and industrial development, 
stressed important aspects of our times. He said that 
reciprocal commercial opening and greater competition among 
production plants [plantas] will prompt us to increase the 
scales of production and to redistribute revenue margins. This 
is how the Uruguay Round will promote the creation of new jobs 
and increase the salaries of our workers, he added. 
  [Begin Serra recording] Mexico is convinced that the new 
world commerce organization must focus on three main actions: 
  1. Deepening reciprocal commerce liberalization by 
eliminating barriers and distortions that are still standing in 
various productive sectors. 
  2. Updating and improving the various areas [disciplinas] 
of the multilateral system of commerce to rid them of unilateral 
measures and reverting protectionist trends. 
  3. Ensuring an appropriate interaction between the 
competition policy and commercial measures to fight unfair 
practices. [end recording] 
  Secretary Jaime Serra Puche also advocated respect for the 
environment and protection of labor rights.

<F P=106> [Article by Rogelio Varela, Jesus Rangel, and Connie Ochoa] </F>
  [Text] Guadalajara, Jalisco, 13 Apr -- The Latin American 
and Caribbean nations "have observed the new U.S. attitude 
toward the region," by considering us current and potential 
associates, said Pedro Aspe [Mexican finance and public credit 
secretary], president of the IDB [Inter-American Development 
Bank] Governors Assembly. Meanwhile, Enrique Iglesias, IDB 
president, noted that the first guarantee to control a nation's 
foreign debt is to maintain "clean public finances and good 
administration by the government." 
  Both officials closed the 35th annual meeting of the IDB 
Governors Assembly and the Inter-American Investment Corporation 
(CII), where they stated that the IDB's new commitments and new 
agenda are to support the overall economic and social 
development of the region through dialogue and attention to the 
programs that combat poverty and encourage the private sector. 
  In a news conference at the end of the meeting, Enrique 
Iglesias said that the economic liberalization policy undertaken 
by the Latin American governments "is totally coincidental with 
the policies of social improvement. Other models that were 
applied did not solve this issue, they made it worse, as is 
clearly demonstrated by the hiperinflationary crisis, which is 
the greatest burden on the most destitute in Latin America." 
  When reporting on the new organization of IDB capital 
shares, 
Aspe explained: There is a new attitude on the part of the 
United States toward the region as well as toward extra-regional 
European and Japanese participation. "What we have said is that 
the United States truly regards the region increasingly as a 
current and potential associate; this is resulting in a much 
more balanced and solid relationship. By reducing its shares in 
the IDB, the United States will participate in capital 
replacement without resorting to additional budget resources. 
  The official explained that the IDB Governors Assembly will 
meet on 10 June in Washington DC to establish the strategy to be 
followed in restructuring the CII so that its activities are not 
duplicated by those carried out by the IDB in the programs 
earmarked to finance the private sector, particularly 
infrastructure works. 
  Enrique Iglesias suggested that the IDB members who insist 
on 
pushing the economic reform process specifically improve 
internal savings with procedures similar to those used in the 
southeastern nations. 
  Iglesias said that the IDB has indicated its willingness to 
support the governments in implementing voluntary family 
planning policies and in reducing military expenses so that 
investments are directed toward productive activities. 
  Meanwhile, Iglesias disclosed that the IDB will seek to 
reduce its internal costs "because we feel we cannot preach 
austerity to the governments without practicing it in our own 
home. It is said that charity begins at home." The IDB 
president also explained that as a result of restructuring the 
bank's capital, two additional seats were created on the board 
of directors which still have not been assigned to any nation. 
In the next 60 days, a decision on this will be discussed with 
the multilateral organization's. One seat will be for a Latin 
American nation and the other for an extra-regional nation. 
Nevertheless, it has transpired that one of these seats is 
practically assured to Japan, while the other is being disputed 
by Chile with other Latin American nations. 
  In this context and during his participation in the fifth 
full assembly, Mario Read, a Dominican Republic minister, 
acknowledged the eighth replacement of IDB capital took place 
amid fierce debate. At times, the possibility of transforming 
the IDB from a promoter of economic and social development into 
an institution with a predominantly financial tone, was 
considered. 
  Meanwhile, Barry Hudson, UK alternate governor, indicated 
that the mission at this time is to make the best use of the 
large increase available in the bank's financing.

<F P=106> [By Jose A. Puertas] </F>
  [Text] Guadalajara, Mexico, 12 Apr (AFP) -- The new 
Venezuelan Government has designed an economic program that will 
help overcome fiscal and financial difficulties in the short run 
and establish the bases for a sustainable growth with decreasing 
inflation, Venezuelan Finance Minister Julio Sosa Rodriguez said 
on Tuesday in Guadalajara. 
  Speaking to the 35th Annual Assembly of the Inter-American 
Development Bank (IDB) which is being held in this Mexican city, 
the Venezuelan minister assured that his government will only 
apply "the most orthodox mechanism of healthy macroeconomic 
management, that is, it will finance the deficit through higher 
domestic taxing and expense reduction." 
  Sosa's speech generated great expectations among the 
representatives of the international financial community who are 
attending the IDB assembly, because of the uncertainty, created 
by the inflation and fiscal deficit, that President Rafael 
Caldera found when he was inaugurated in February. Several 
bankers described his speech as "positive" and "encouraging." 
  Sosa Rodriguez listed five guidelines for his strategy: 
adequate macroeconomic management, comprehensive tax reform, an 
economic stabilization program, promotion of domestic and 
foreign investment, and continuation of economic opening through 
free exchange agreements with its commercial partners. 
  The effort will be supported by reaching a consensus with 
the 
labor and business sectors in order to voluntarily restrain 
price increases during the transition to the economic structure 
proposed by the government. He described it as "a competitive 
economy with social justice." 
  As for the assembly's agenda, Sosa Rodriguez said that he 
was 
pleased with the $40 billion increase in IDB capital, but 
complained about a lack of generosity on the part of 
non-borrowing members reflected by their contributions to 
concessionary [concesionales] funds used to assist countries 
that have lower revenues. He pointed out that although there 
was an agreement to reduce their contributions [participacion 
accionaria] to non-regional countries, Latin America and the 
Caribbean have had to bear a higher financial burden in its 
contributions to the bank. "[Word indistinct] the financial 
difficulties of non-borrowing countries, but they cannot be 
compared to the fiscal restrictions facing other countries of 
the region," the Venezuelan minister added. 
  He made it clear that Venezuela does not support one of the 
commitments included in the agreement to increase resources, 
that is, the capitalization of various funds through the 
transfer of net revenues produced by regular capital. This 
mechanism will increase financial charges on loans and will 
recycle resources within the region rather than channel 
additional resources into it, he pointed out.

  [Excerpt] Guadalajara, (Mexico), 13 Apr (EFE) -- The 35th 
Inter-American Development Bank [IDB] Annual Assembly ended 
today in Guadalajara with specific agreements among the member 
states to increase the bank's capital, redefine its 
organization, and place stronger emphasis on fighting poverty. 
  The governors expressed their satisfaction with the 
agreements reached at the meeting. Much of the interest in the 
meeting was lost hours before it even began on Monday because 
the member countries had already agreed to increase the bank's 
capital and to focus more attention on social issues. 
  In addition to deciding on a $40-billion increase over the 
next six years, bringing the IDB's capital to $100 billion, the 
countries of the region decided to relinquish part of their 
voting rights to Japan and the European banks in return for 
greater contributions from them. The non-American members will 
now have an additional representative on the IDB Executive 
Board, which will be headed by Japan, while the Latin American 
members gained an additional seat to compensate for the vote 
that they relinquished. 
  When the meeting concluded, Pedro Aspe, Mexican Finance and 
Public Credit secretary and president of the 35th IDB Annual 
Assembly, said this agreement allows the Latin American 
countries to retain a majority with 50 percent of the votes and 
that no more votes will be relinquished to nonregional members 
in exchange for their contributions. Aspe stressed the 
multilateral nature of this decision, saying that it gives 
nonregional countries 16 percent of the votes. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Havana, 16 Apr (DPA) -- A Cuban Foreign Relations 
Ministry source said today that the NATO bombings of the Bosnian 
city of Gorazde could trigger serious consequences for the 
Balkans, Europe, and the rest of the world. 
  The governmental Radio Rebelde reported that the diplomatic 
source maintained that the air attacks could spark unexpected 
consequences at regional, continental, and world levels, instead 
of contributing to reaching a fair solution of the conflict. 
The source of the Cuban Foreign Ministry believes that the path 
to peace must not follow an escalation of war, not even as a 
result of a foreign military intervention. On the contrary, all 
parties should refrain from encouraging this alternative; they 
should take definite steps toward promoting the success of the 
negotiation efforts and the attainment of a political agreement 
that would bring peace to that region.

  [Text] Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina said in 
Asuncion, the capital of Paraguay, that in response to the 
severe economic blockade imposed by the United States, his 
country is in need of an economic model characterized by 
openness to trade and foreign investment. 
  During a news conference on the second and final day of his 
working trip to Paraguay, Robaina said that one of the main 
reasons for his South American tour was to advertise investment 
opportunities on the island. 
  During Robaina's trip to Paraguay, several political leaders 
from the South American country called for the restoration of 
diplomatic ties between the two nations, which were broken 
during the sixties because of pressure from the United States on 
the Paraguayan Government. The request was made by Senators 
Carlos Romero and Eugenio Zanabria, both members of the ruling 
Colorado Party [National Republican Association] and Manuel 
Benitez, leader of the Authentic Radical Liberal Party, the 
foremost opposition party. 
  The Cuban foreign minister is concluding in Paraguay a tour 
that included official trips to Uruguay, Peru, and Argentina.

  [Text] On the last day of his unofficial visit to Paraguay, 
Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina met with former President 
Andres Rodriguez and members of the Commerce, Industry and 
Production Federation, the largest [words indistinct] of that 
South American country. Robaina gave former President Rodriguez 
a message from Cuban President Fidel Castro, for which Rodriguez 
thanked him. The Cuban foreign minister spoke to Paraguayan 
businessmen about the island's economic plans and said that 
opportunities for investment are open with preference given to 
Latin American capital. Robaina said that Cuba can attract 
investments because it has raw materials, a highly qualified 
labor force, technology, markets, as well as roads, ports, and 
airports. The foreign minister also told the Paraguayan 
businessmen that Cuba has high production in the nickel, citrus, 
tourism, petroleum research, cement, textile, and pharmaceutical 
industries, all with a high degree of technical development.

<F P=106> [From the "Evening Information Review" newscast] </F>
  [Text] General Raul Castro Ruz, minister of the 
Revolutionary Armed Forces, reiterated on Saturday in Guantanamo 
City that Cuba will never renounce its sovereign right over 
Caimanera, where the United States maintains a military base 
against the will of the Cuban Government and people. 
  In a speech commemorating the 33d anniversary proclaiming 
the 
socialist nature of the Cuban Revolution and Militiamen's Day, 
Raul Castro denounced the United States, saying that at a time 
when the United States is closing bases in its territory and in 
other countries to reduce its gigantic military budget, it 
maintains its enclave in Caimanera as a point of constant 
provocation and humiliation of Cuba. 
  Castro, who is also second secretary of the Central 
Committee 
of the Communist Party of Cuba, pointed out that in 1993 and so 
far in 1994, a climate of tranquillity has predominated on both 
sides of the fence that separates Cuban territory from the U.S. 
Naval Base. He said I will do everything in my power so that it 
continues this way. That is why, underscored Raul Castro, 
necessary measures will be adopted to frustrate the outrageous 
attempts by those intending to leave the country through the 
Caimanera base -- attempts which not only seriously endanger 
their lives, but can also cause warlike incidents of 
unpredictable consequences. 
  The leader of the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces called on 
the United States to discourage illegal departures by Cubans, 
not only those through Guantanamo, but also those using unsound 
vessels to reach the Florida coast, where they are allowed to 
stay -- something that is not granted to any other foreigners in 
the United States.

<F P=106> [Interview via phone with Marcos Castellon from Miami by </F>
Radio Rebelde reporters Maria Elena Alonso and Zenaida Costales 
on the "Doing Radio" program -- live] 
  [Text] [Alonso] Good morning Marcos. There are indications 
that there has been a change in the U.S. immigration policy 
toward Cubans. We would like to hear details on this issue. 
  [Castellon] Yes, good morning. This week, for the first 
time, 
U.S. authorities intercepted and returned a group of Cubans who 
were found at sea who were on their way to Florida from the 
Bahamas. 
  Up until now, the policy of impeding groups of illegal 
aliens 
from arriving on U.S. territory had only been applied to 
Haitians and other foreign nationals but not to Cubans, who as 
everyone knows benefit from the 1966 law. 
  This legislation permits any Cuban citizen to be admitted 
immediately once they reach U.S. territory despite the 
originating point of their voyage or the reasons for that trip. 
At the moment, this exclusive privilege is being challenged in 
Congress with a bill that seeks annulment of the privilege 
considering it discriminatory to other foreign citizens who are 
required to present evidence of their allegations of political 
persecution in their native land. 
  The interception and return of these 19 Cuban immigrants to 
Bahamas by the U.S. Coast Guard is described by the MIAMI 
HERALD's 14 April editorial as a good attempt to make the U.S. 
immigration policy more consistent. 
  According to the same editorial, under the new policy, 
Cubans 
will be returned if they come from a third country where they 
were established according to declarations from an official of 
the U.S. Administration who was not identified. 
  With the pretext that there is already an immigration crisis 
with the Haitians in the Bahamas, the government of those 
islands criticized Washington's decision of returning the Cubans 
to the Bahamas and has refused to accept any other deportees. 
The editorial goes on to say that Cubans, Haitians, and other 
possible illegal aliens should be warned, through radio 
broadcasts and family members living in the United States, of 
the risks in traveling to U.S. coasts on fragile boats and rafts. 
  The editorial also suggests that Washington be firm in 
breaking up immigrant smuggling networks, that it ask other 
governments to discourage illegal emigration, and not to expect 
other nations to give up their sovereign rights, as in the case 
of the Bahamian Government which rejected the return of Cubans 
to its territory. 
  [Alonso] Yes, Marcos. But this is something strange 
especially when it regards Cuban citizens. I would like to hear 
your opinion on this change in policy by the U.S. Government. 
  [Castellon] This is a complex issue because the U.S. 
immigration policy is something that is very difficult to 
understand -- it is very inconsistent. Many point out that it is 
full of inequalities and gives privileges to the Cubans. 
  Coinciding with the request by a U.S. Congressmen that the 
United States invade Haiti and get rid of the military council 
that overthrew President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, 16 players of 
the Haitian soccer team asked for asylum at the U.S. Embassy in 
Trinidad and Tobago and were rejected. These players say that if 
they return to Haiti they will be the object of political 
persecution. Nevertheless, the U.S. Government did not accept 
their request for asylum. 
  This brings to mind the situation of Ponce, Puerto Rico, 
where deserters of the Cuban sports delegations to the Central 
American games, encouraged by anti-Castro groups, decided to 
stay. Those that decided to stay had the immediate protection of 
the U.S. Government without having to prove that they qualified 
for the condition of political refugee. 
  On many occasions it has been pointed out that this 
difference in treatment between Cubans and Haitians, in addition 
to having political overtones, has aspects of racial 
discrimination. This is not surprising if one considers the 
results of a recent survey, which was published today, that says 
the U.S. black population is becoming more radical and 
pessimistic every day. This study was conducted by the 
University of Chicago. Half of those interviewed even support 
the formation of a national political party consisting only of 
blacks. Seventy-three percent doubt they will ever be able to 
see racial equality in their lifetime. A similar number believe 
that the legal and economic systems, and society in general in 
the United States, are not fair with black citizens. That is 
partly reflected in the U.S. immigration policy. 
  [Alonso] Yes, that is very interesting. I believe Zenaida 
Costales has a question for you. 
  [Costales] Good morning. I thank you for the help you give 
to 
the "Doing Radio" program. I was wondering if you could tell us 
about the treatment given to those who leave Cuba illegally and 
reach the United States. How are these people received? 
  [Castellon] They are automatically admitted. When Cubans are 
seen in the Straits of Florida they are immediately helped. They 
are taken to Coast Guard bases and are quickly processed and are 
turned over to groups who give them support. They immediately 
become an object of press coverage and later become part of the 
general social current. 
  At the beginning, depending on the position they held in 
Cuba, or if the circumstances of their arrival are dramatic, 
their arrival is used as an element of propaganda. One must 
examine their condition months later. Undeniably, many of them 
have relatives here and they adapt and progress in this society. 
But there is also an enormous quantity, who are not given as 
much press coverage, who months after arriving are still waiting 
for promises of work and are still having problems with housing. 
There are some who are even begging for money on the streets. 
  There also many, many of whom I have met and whom have not 
been given enough coverage, who regret coming to the United 
States and they miss their relatives and their homeland. This is 
a reality that is very shocking. 
  [Alonso] Marcos, we thank you for your opinion and your 
cooperation.

  [Text] The U.S. Interests Section in Havana granted only 
20,000 of the 100,000 visas requested in 1993. Could this be a 
factor prompting the illegal and risky departure of thousands of 
people from Cuba? 
  Why do people chose to leave Cuba illegally? What are the 
main causes? Lourdes de Urrutia, a Havana University sociologist 
and member of a group who conducted a study on the matter of 
illegal emigration, explains. 
  [Urrutia] "I believe it is interesting to point out why 
those 
who choose to leave illegally do so. The fact is that 53 percent 
of those interviewed do not meet immigration law requirements, 
[passage indistinct] first-degree blood relationship that is 
required in order to be legally sent for by relatives in the 
United States. A certain percentage of those interviewed who do 
meet the requirements, or have first-degree blood ties with 
relatives in the United States, opt to leave illegally because 
they believe it is speedier than leaving via legal channels, and 
circumvents all the paperwork required to depart legally. Thus, 
I believe illegal departures are conditioned by the 
restrictiveness of U.S. policies and by the parameters for 
people to be able to emigrate legally to the United States that 
that country establishes." 
  Specialists are of the opinion that economic reasons, as 
well 
as the difficult situation Cuba is going through, are the main 
reasons people weigh in choosing to leave Cuba illegally. 
  [Urrutia] "Among the economic reasons these people mention 
is 
the frustration they are experiencing because of the conditions 
of the special period. There is also the fact that over 70 
percent of them decided to leave Cuba during the special period, 
after 1990. Therefore, these are not people left behind from 
past surges of emigration. They are people who reached their 
decisions between 1990 and the present, and primarily during 
1993, which is the year our study was on. This is the year when 
the difficulties of the special period were most acutely felt. 
We believe that all this supports our conclusion that this 
emigration is of an economic nature." 
  The matter of illegal Cuban emigration to Florida reflects 
the status of immigration relations between Cuba and the United 
States. It also shows that this matter continues to be part of 
this bilateral conflict.

  [Text] In Morocco, Cuban Foreign Trade Minister Ricardo 
Cabrisas signed the final document of the Urugauy Round and the 
document for the creation of the World Trade Organization. 
According to information from the Ministry of Foreign Trade, in 
the declaration the ministers that represent 124 governments and 
the EEC salute the historic achievement that the conclusion of 
the round represents with the conviction that it will strengthen 
the world economy. 
  In his speech before the ministerial meeting, Cabrisas 
described the creation of the World Trade Organization as 
positive, but warned that the economies of the South will 
continue to be subject to inequalities if the foundation of the 
current rules of the game are not changed. He pointed out that 
Cuba will not benefit from the agreements reached in one of the 
most important markets, the U.S. market, because of the U.S. 
economic, trade, and financial blockade imposed on Cuba for more 
than 30 years.

  [Text] The Havana City Provincial Court has sentenced 
Rodolfo Gonzalez Gonzalez to seven years in prison for 
disseminating false information on Cuba to create an image of 
social chaos and promote foreign intervention. 
  During the trial, which was open to accredited foreign 
diplomats and reporters, it was proven that Gonzalez Gonzalez 
disseminated fictitious reports of large-scale attacks on public 
centers and police repression to the United States by telephone, 
which were broadcast by anti-Cuban radio stations. 
  [Madrid EFE in Spanish at 0033 GMT on 16 April transmits a 
related 300-word Havana-datelined report on the Rodolfo Gonzalez 
Gonzalez case. The EFE report says Gonzalez, who is identified 
as the spokesman for the outlawed Cuban Human Rights Committee, 
was convicted of disseminating "enemy propaganda," a crime for 
which he received "one of the harshest sentences handed down 
over the past few years for a political crime." Gonzalez is 
quoted as saying he does not expect to serve his entire 
sentence, "because the current situation in Cuba cannot last 
that long."]

  [Text] Havana, 14 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- Prioritized sectors of 
the economy and social services of Cuba could be affected 
beginning today by sporadic power outages, local radio and an 
official spokesmen confirmed today. 
  "The situation remains tense as Basic Industries Minister 
Marcos Portal has explained," a spokesman for state-owned Union 
Electrica Company has told NOTIMEX. "In the next few hours 
there could be a little more electricity if four or five 
generators that were out of order begin operations," the 
official added. 
  On Tuesday and Wednesday there was an average of five hours 
of electric power in this capital of over 2 million people, 
where extensive areas have remained in the dark for over three 
weeks. Official sources stated two thirds of the electric power 
generating capacity of Cuba is out of service due to failure and 
lack of maintenance. 
  "Today will also be a very tense day and even prioritized 
sectors such as the sugar harvest, industrial production, and 
the population in general will be affected," the spokesman for 
state-owned Union Electrica Company asserted. According to the 
spokesman, the daily power outages do not include hospitals and 
laboratories, selected production centers, state-owned 
organizations, military command centers, and the group of 
tourism installations. "Above everything are the water lines, 
hospitals, and bread making," the spokesman stated. 
  Spokespersons for the Ministry of Basic Industries said a 
repair plan will enter into operations this month, but the 
recovery of some 60 percent of the electric power production 
capacity will only be achieved at the end of the present year. 
  Other sources NOTIMEX consulted explained there are delays 
in 
maintenance due to lack of resources and, although some 
resources have been received, the recovery process in this 
regard will take two to three years. The failure of the system 
was added to the lack of fuel for thermal energy production, 
originated by the shortage of crude oil in the country, despite 
the efforts made by state-owned Cuba Petroleo (Cupet). 
  Cupet representatives reported that 2.135 million barrels of 
crude oil were extracted during the first quarter of this year, 
representing 112 percent compliance with the oil program. The 
national production plan for crude oil, whose high content of 
sulfur is damaging the boilers of the thermoelectric centrals, 
so far this year totals [number indistinct] million barrels, 
that is 700,000 barrels over what was extracted in 1993. 
  Cuba reduced its oil supplies from 91 million annual barrels 
to less than half that amount, following the disappearance of 
the Soviet Union, its former essential supplier. 
  According to Cupet data, the production of 821 megawatts (26 
percent of the total) is hampered by faults and that of 570 
megawatts (18 percent) due to lack of maintenance. Resources 
equivalent to 372 megawatts (11 percent) have different 
limitations and the equipment generates lower-than-capacity 
amounts, according to the energy utility company.

  [Text] On 15 April, the Electric Union of the Ministry of 
Basic Industry announced that the electric power deficit being 
experienced nationwide will continue on into next week, and that 
outages will continue to be extensive. The nation's power 
generation capability is 3,132 megawatts, but the fact that the 
generator units of certain plants have not received maintenance 
or have broken down has resulted in a significant drop in the 
output of energy. Although 1,325 megawatts were provided this 
week, there is a marked difference between the nation's supply 
of electricity and its demand. This has resulted in extensive 
outages between 0500 and 0000. 
  Next week's deficit is estimated at 680 megawatts; 
therefore, 
the extensive outages will continue.

  [Text] Carlos Lage Davila, vice president of the Council of 
State, has urged sugar industry workers throughout the country 
to continue exhibiting the same spirit in the final stage of the 
harvest. 
  During the assessment of the current sugar harvest in the 
southeastern region, Lage presented to Granma the banners 
acknowledging the province as the best of three during the first 
10 days of April. Reporter Jorge Luis Batista has a recording by 
Lage on this matter: 
  [Begin Lage recording] A political message of a sugar 
harvest 
that is beginning to recover is a very positive political 
message, one that helps and encourages us to tackle the 
situation and to confront the daily difficulties. 
  I don't know whether I need to make a call for a final 
effort, because the appraisal that we have from all comrades is 
that the maximum effort is being made. The call must be to 
maintain that maximum effort during this harvest, because this 
is what will bring the nation resources, although these 
resources will be very limited because the harvest is still 
limited. Nevertheless, I am leaving with the conviction that the 
three provinces being assessed will fulfill their objectives -- 
especially Granma, because I had the opportunity to listen to 
the directors of the different complexes and I think the people 
are making the efforts that are necessary for the Revolution.

  [Text] In Granma Province, Politburo member Carlos Lage 
stated that the country's efforts to find a solution to every 
problem deriving from the collapse of the Socialist Bloc are 
beginning to have results and to be reflected in some of the 
branches of our economy. As an example of this, Lage mentioned 
the tourism and oil extraction industries, which are going to 
continue to grow. He went on to say that tobacco production must 
be elevated starting with the current harvest and that 
transformations are being made in citrus, cement, and shrimp 
production. 
  Lage warned that the current year will be a difficult one 
due 
to the fact that the production level of the current sugar 
harvest remains low and that the rest of the areas of income do 
not compensate for this drop. He pointed out that such results 
in the main industry are due to the lack of resources to secure 
it. Lage went on to say that the functioning of the economy and 
the life of the population will improve as we see a recovery in 
production. 
  Lage underscored the importance of stopping the decline in 
production and of producing more than in the past harvest, since 
in the past years each harvest has been smaller. He underscored 
that such an accomplishment would mark a turning point in the 
economy. 
  Regarding the upcoming session of the National Assembly of 
the People's Government [ANPP], Lage stated that specific 
measures will not come out of those debates because to adopt 
such measures requires a high level of instrumentation and 
precision, which cannot be achieved in such a broad forum. 
  [Begin Lage recording] I would say that the assembly has 
great importance because of the significance of the issue that 
will be analyzed: the economy, something that is very important 
and that at the moment is of great interest. 
  As everyone knows, we have an excess of currency which is 
the 
result of the (?decline) in production. This situation must be 
rectified. We must balance the money that is circulating among 
the population, and the money that is printed periodically, with 
the offer of goods to the population. 
  This problem was originated by a policy of justice that the 
revolution adopted in face of the situation that was created 
with the collapse of the Socialist Bloc. In an attempt to level 
the prices, so that people with higher incomes would not be the 
only ones with access to goods, the revolution tried to 
establish a more equitable distribution of goods. This 
distribution was even more rationed than before, so that 
everyone could have access to those goods. Now we hope to 
rectify gradually the imbalance which has been created, as we 
gradually recover our levels of production and the situation is 
normalized. 
  To a certain extent, this assembly will also summarize the 
process of the workers parliaments, the assemblies which 
gathered all those opinions, and the meeting by the plenum of 
the national committee of the Cuban Workers Federation. I would 
say that the assembly will summarize that whole process. 
  Specific measures will not come out of that assembly. Those 
measures require a level of instrumentation and precision that 
cannot be obtained in a discussion among 500 people. Those 
decisions must be taken by the leadership of the government. The 
assembly should make recommendations. It should instruct the 
government and make recommendations and explanations as to what 
direction the government should take in making those decisions 
so that in the following weeks we can begin to see the 
progressive application of the measures that are finally adopted. 
  Therefore, I believe that the assembly that will be held on 
1 
May, will be very important and will be given extensive 
coverage. [end recording]

  [Text] Havana, 14 Apr (DPA) -- Cuba announced today that 
it produced 305,000 tons of oil during the first quarter of 
1994, surpassing by 112 percent the goal set for that period. 
The state-owned National Radio Newscast (NNR) revealed that the 
island plans to extract 1.2 million tons of crude oil this year, 
100,000 tons more than the record amount extracted in 1993. 
  Local oil production, known for its high density and sulfur 
content, represents approximately 16 percent of the oil Cuba 
might have available this year to keep its cement, nickel, and 
glass industries operating. 
  According to NNR, daily hydrocarbon production represents 
approximately 15 percent of the country's fuel needs at this 
stage, which is characterized as the worst economic crisis since 
1959. However, the newscast explained that Cuban crude oil used 
to generate electricity represents 30 percent of the total fuel 
used for that purpose. 
  The drastic decline in deliveries by the former Soviet Union 
to Cuba (from 13 million tons a year until 1989 to less than 6 
million last year) caused a partial paralysis in island 
transportation and continuous and prolonged power outages that 
have angered citizens. Until shortly before its formal 
disintegration in December 1991, the former USSR gave its 
Caribbean ally approximately $120 million a year in credit for 
oil exploration. 
  To balance the enormous fuel deficit, which paralyzed 
hundreds of factories, Cuban authorities encouraged the 
extraction of national crude oil and opened up the sector to 
foreign oil companies for prospecting operations.

  [Text] ANAP [National Association of Small Farmers] is 
analyzing its principal deficiencies. The recovery of production 
in the cooperative and small farmer sectors, indispensable for 
reestablishing the nation's economic equilibrium, is being 
analyzed in depth at the fifth national ANAP plenum. This 
meeting, presided over by Politburo members Ricardo Alarcon and 
Alfredo Jordan and by ANAP President Orlando Lugo Fonte, is 
evaluating solutions to the principal difficulties affecting the 
nonstate sector of Cuba's agriculture. 
  Despite the production potential of the small farmers 
cooperatives, results last year did not correspond to the amount 
of land planted and the existing number of animals, and were 
below expectations. Concerning tubers and vegetables, there was 
an overall decrease, nationwide, and within these sectors, this 
(?was more noticeable) in the agricultural-livestock production 
cooperatives. 
  The fifth pleneum of ANAP's national committee, which is 
meeting in Guira de Melena Municipality, Havana Province, set 
forth the main causes of the decrease in agricultural-livestock 
production. The delegates to the meeting agreed that, in 
addition to the problems of the weather, shortages and the late 
delivery of resources, problems of an organizational nature and 
a failure to make demands also have an effect. The sales on the 
free market by a number of farmers and the bartering of tubers 
and other agricultural products for articles of prime necessity 
are being evaluated in the light of the social disorganization 
prevailing in Cuba. Several plenum participants came out against 
this, and the plenum approved strengthening the work of the 
cooperatives' boards of directors and once again taking up the 
process of discussing pride and honor on the part of the farmers.

  [Text] Santo Domingo, 14 Apr (EFE) -- Dominican President 
Joaquin Balaguer today said his government has not agreed "at 
any time" with a total embargo against any country, be it Cuba 
or Haiti. 
  He revealed that his government's position, which has been 
forwarded to the United States, has nothing to do with the 
cordial relations he maintains with Cuban President Fidel 
Castro. Nevertheless, he said the blockade against Cuba and 
Haiti should be completely lifted only "when international 
organizations consider this course of action to be correct." 
Balaguer stated his views during his regularly scheduled 
Thursday news conference. 
  Balaguer said his government's support for the embargo and 
its surveillance along the border with Haiti "will not threaten 
the Dominican Republic's sovereignty, because this is not at 
stake." Nevertheless, he reasserted he will not permit the 
presence of international observers, although he respects the 
decision by international organizations to maintain an economic 
embargo against Haiti -- a decision he does not endorse. 
  The president said the embargo is detrimental to the poorest 
people in Haiti, and, therefore, the Dominican Republic has 
never favored the embargo. Nevertheless, Balaguer said he 
decided to strengthen surveillance along the border with Haiti 
in the wake of complaints from international organizations that 
said he should not allow fuel to pass into Haiti from the 
Dominican Republic. He announced that surveillance will be 
increased in the future, but he did not specify when.

  [Text] The president of the National Assembly, Senator 
Firmin Jean-Louis, will address the nation today, 15 April, on a 
private radio station in the capital within the scope of a 
message on the immediate political juncture, the HAITIAN PRESS 
AGENCY learned from a source close to Sen. Jean-Louis. 
According to the same source, the legitimate president of the 
Senate reserves the right not to react to the speech of Chamber 
of Deputies President Frantz Robert Monde, but to react to the 
immediate situation of the country. 
  The current political juncture favors numerous irresponsible 
and illegal steps, the same source pointed out, holding as an 
example the attempt by some senators of the Alliance [for 
Parliamentary Cohesion] and senators elected during the 
contested legislative elections of 18 January 1993 to implement 
Article 149 of the Constitution. The president of the National 
Assembly proposes giving his opinion as well on the possible 
legislative elections scheduled for this year in his message. 
The message will be delivered less than 48 hours after the one 
delivered on 13 April by Chamber of Deputies President Frantz 
Robert Monde, who announced a series of consultations for next 
week within the framework of finding a solution to the crisis. 
  Promising to provide explanations on the presence abroad of 
the president elected on 16 December [1990], Deputy Monde, who 
has never hidden his hostility to the return of President 
Aristide to his post, contented himself with evoking the 
extended absence of the president of the republic, whom he 
nevertheless asked to assume his responsibility toward the 
Constitution by appointing a prime minister. Monde also asked 
General Cedras not to listen to the perverse songs of the sirens 
and to do what his duty and his word as a soldier order him to 
do.

<F P=106> ["Text" of speech by Senate President Firmin Jean-Louis on </F>
15 April; place not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] Haitian people: There is nothing in the evolution 
of the world and events that does not have its critical moment. 
The supreme achievement of proper conduct is to know that 
moment. Yes, we are experiencing today a very critical moment 
in the evolution of the Haitian crisis that calls upon me as 
president of the National Assembly -- joint guardian of the 
national sovereignty -- to address you so as to sum up the 
immediate national political juncture. This critical moment is 
marked by a general despondency of the population including all 
social strata in view of the complications of a national crisis 
that appears unsolvable after 32 months. Now, if everybody -- 
including without discrimination politicians, soldiers, 
shopkeepers, state employees, priests, pastors, teachers, 
students, and so on -- is overwhelmed, there is good reason to 
ask the question: What really hinders the resolution of the 
crisis? This is a pertinent question because the viability of 
any community lies first and foremost in its capability to 
define its true problems so as to bring true solutions to bear. 
  Furthermore, this critical moment is marked by a big 
confusion knowingly maintained by some and by others who are 
defending unavowed interests to the very detriment of the 
Haitian national interest. Some are asking for the 
implementation of Article 149 of the Constitution, whereas 
others are asking for the implementation of Art. 148. But all 
of that shamelessly reveals the true elements of the solution to 
the crisis, notably the rehabilitation of the Constitution and 
of the national sovereignty lying in the universality of the 
citizens, normal functioning of the state and reinforcement of 
the republican institutions, social healing, national 
reconciliation -- conditions essential for recovering social and 
political stability and for moving toward the path of economic 
progress. 
  In fact, I say the moment is very critical because -- among 
other things -- there are precise deadlines that are approaching 
rapidly. The deadlines will test the fortunes and viability of 
the Haitian democratic project. The first of those deadlines is 
next 9 May, the date when the first legislative session will 
reach an end. From then on, the honorable deputies will go on 
vacation and will come back on the second Monday of June [13 
June], which implies that if -- between now and next 9 May -- 
the resolution of the crisis has not begun at least in a 
decisive manner, we will have only three free months left, that 
is from the second Monday of June to the second Monday of 
September [12 September] to set up the constitutional measures 
and the practical mechanisms aimed at leading to the forthcoming 
1994 elections. In this regard, I fully share the concerns 
expressed by the president of the Chamber of Deputies, honorable 
Deputy Frantz Robert Monde, in his address to the nation this 
past 13 April, concerns evoked by myself during several meetings 
and discussions with colleague Deputy Monde. 
  However, I bitterly regret that Deputy Monde decided not as 
a deputy or president of the Chamber of Deputies, but rather as 
vice president of the National Assembly to solemnly address the 
Haitian people and country without having had the kindness, even 
the courtesy, to inform the president of the National Assembly. 
I bitterly regret that the vice president of the National 
Assembly just offered reservations about the latest maneuver of 
10 April made by the elected representatives of the contested 18 
January 1993 elections assisted by some dissident senators. 
Finally, I bitterly regret that the vice president of the 
National Assembly labeled this so-called assembly of 10 April 
1994 an assembly of senators under the leadership of an illegal 
office which the vice president of the National Assembly himself 
had labeled a few days before as illegal and illegitimate. From 
that moment, the vice president of the National Assembly should 
have armed himself with his well-known courage to clearly tell 
the nation about the unacceptability by the office of the 
Chamber of Deputies of any and all acts coming from this illegal 
and illegitimate office. This is what the senatorial assembly 
and I, president of the National Assembly, were expecting from 
President Monde. 
  As president of the National Assembly, I must consider all 
necessary measures for the realization of the session scheduled 
for next 9 May to allow the honorable deputies to go on 
vacation. This having been said, it is the duty of each senator 
and each deputy to work toward the disentanglement of the Senate 
of the Republic. Everybody knows the reasons for this 
entanglement are essentially the occupation of the 
administrative premises and of the session room by those elected 
in the contested 18 January 1993 elections and some dissident 
senators and a strong tendency toward physical violence -- which 
has been manifested several times -- among most of them. So, as 
a responsible leader, I have the right to prevent any and all 
situations that might give rise to tragic incidents. 
  All in all the entanglement of the Senate is the 
entanglement 
of the parliament, which falls within the scope of the general 
entanglement of the country. This can be proved by the fact 
that the rare sessions held at the Chamber of Deputies since I 
opened the first session this past 11 January have not enabled a 
move toward the resolution of the crisis. As president of the 
National Assembly, I consider that the efforts of the parliament 
will have a real meaning when all of us, senators and deputies, 
enter the path leading to an effective way out of the current 
crisis. The essential elements binding the parliament directly 
in its constitutional prerogatives are the following: a vote on 
the law relating to the amnesty, the ratification of the new 
commander in chief, and the ratification of a new prime minister. 
  In this regard, I call on the president of the lower chamber 
and vice president of the National Assembly as well as all vital 
forces of the nation to join me so we can reach together this 
immediate and priority objective. This is why, as president of 
the National Assembly concerned with the critical situation the 
nation is experiencing, I am duty bound to draw the attention of 
the honorable deputies and senators to the fact that it is time 
-- yes, I say it is time -- for us to roll up our sleeves and to 
show the people who rely on us that we can do great things. 
Thank you.

  [Text] The president of the lower chamber is allegedly one 
of those responsible for the crisis which has been raging in the 
country for over two years; he should at least have the heart to 
admit it instead of trying to hang the responsibilty on others, 
according to Deputy Fignole Jean-Louis, the president of the 
National Front for Change and Democracy. The deputy says that 
the appointment of a new prime minister will change nothing in 
the current situation. 
  [Begin Jean-Louis recording] We think that Monde... [pauses] 
We think that Deputy Monde contradicted himself. He should have 
said instead... [pauses] He should be courageous enough to say 
if the country has reached such a situation, he is one of those 
who are responsible for the misfortune of the Haitian people, 
for the (?heartbreaks) and the chronic miseries the Haitian 
people are experiencing now because on 7 October [1991].... 
[pauses] We know what happened here. 
  As for us, we could not enter the Senate, only Radio 
Nationale and Television Nationale d'Haiti had the right to 
enter on that day. What happened? After a vote favoring Article 
148, which was ready to be sent to President Aristide in 
Venezuela so he could choose a prime minister, which all 
diplomats pretended to approve, Monde was the first one who set 
up a scenario and came up with a piece of paper in his pocket 
under the pretext that he had been arrested outside the 
parliament. They began establishing the de facto governments on 
the basis of a piece of paper upon which no parliamentarian cast 
a vote. The current situation of the country is a consequence 
of the successive de facto governments. So, he should be 
courageous enough to say that we in the FNCD are not responsible 
for this situation because since the beginning of the crisis we 
said no, we do not agree with this matter of a coup d'etat 
because the government was elected, and it was up to the people 
to take a measure if they were not satisfied with the 
government. [end recording]

  [Text] Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago, 15 Apr (NOTIMEX) 
-- The 25 members of the Haitian national soccer team who have 
requested political asylum in the United States, which was 
subsequently denied, threatened to carry out a mass suicide 
today. 
  After being eliminated from the Shell Cup taking place in 
this capital city, the Caribbean soccer players decided not to 
return to their country, considering the embattled situation 
there. 
  According to their threat, the mass suicide would take place 
in front of the U.S. Embassy in this city. The embassy decided 
not to grant a visa to any of the athletes who are stranded in 
Trinidad and Tobago. 
  "If we return to our country, we will be risking our lives; 
that is why we would rather immolate ourselves now instead of 
returning. The United States must help us," said Earns 
Jean-Baptiste, spokesman for the soccer group.

  [Text] According to the Haiti Press Agency, AHP, the 
situaton remains confusing in the northern Haitian village of Le 
Borgne following a shoot-out that took place last weekend 
between a number of armed civilians and a number of military 
from the Le Borgne outpost. The Haitian military authorities 
have yet to make public any official version of the incidents in 
Le Borgne. 
  AHP says that reports by Inter Press Service mention several 
people being killed during the attack, without specifying which 
side suffered the alleged losses. AHP reports, further, that a 
number of sources, which coincide, make mention of many arrests 
in the Le Borgne area, including that of Le Borgne mayor 
Belizaire Fils-Aime and a rural policeman. Several houses were 
also reportedly burned down. 
  It should be noted that there is no telephone link between 
Port-au-Prince and Le Borgne.

  [Text] Dominican President Joaquin Balaguer has set up a 
commission to enforce the embargo against Haiti. This commission 
-- made up of the Armed Forces minister, the military chiefs of 
the general staff, and the Army -- will have to solicit from the 
United Nations, through the pertinent institutions, the logistic 
support it needs to do its job. 
  This measure by President Balaguer comes after U.S. 
Democratic congressmen asked him to assume a more responsible 
attitude so as to put an end to the flood of goods that cross 
the border between the Dominican Republic and Haiti daily. 
  According to the Dominican newspaper (LA PRENSA), this 
trafficking takes place with the conspicuous complicity of the 
Dominican border guards and other Dominican citizens. 
Information from Washington says the State Department hopes 
Balaguer will ask for UN monitors, so as to strengthen 
surveillance along the Haitian-Dominican border. 
  Observers think this Dominican Government decision to form a 
commission with the mission of strengthening surveillance along 
the border is a compromise that has been reached among the 
divers lobbies in the Dominican Republic and the United States 
that criticize international sanctions against Haiti. 
  Analysts say, furthermore, that Balaguer has exhibited a 
position hostile to President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who 
accuses him of encouraging the hiring of thousands of Haitians 
for the Dominican sugarcane plantations [batey]. 
  President Aristide has stated that the Haitian workers are 
treated like slaves in the Dominican Republic, living under 
subhuman conditions -- without running water, electricity, or 
social assistance -- and working for pathetic wages. 
  It should be recalled that Balaguer's response to this 
accusation was a massive deportation of Haitians.

  [Text] Tuxtla Gutierrez, Chiapas, 15 Apr (DPA) -- The 
Mexican Government has said that today's predawn attack on a 
military checkpoint in southern Chiapas does not jeopardize the 
peace process in this strife-torn region that borders Guatemala. 
  A spokesman for the Mexican presidential palace told DPA 
there does not seem to be any relation between the attack on the 
checkpoint near Tuxtla Gutierrez and the armed conflict that 
broke out in this state on 1 January. In this way, the 
government dismissed reports that the Zapatist National 
Liberation Army (EZLN), which took up arms on New Year's Day, 
waged the attack. 
  Chiapas Attorney General Arturo Becerra said that so far 
there are no indications the EZLN was involved in the attack on 
the checkpoint located on the highway leading from Tuxtla 
Gutierrez to Chicoasen, a town that is far removed from the 
guerrilla's zone of operations. 
  Chiapas Governor Javier Lopez Moreno, in turn, stressed that 
the truce between the insurgents and the Mexican Army, which has 
been in effect since 12 January when the government ordered a 
unilateral cease-fire of its offensive actions, "is alive." 
  The Defense Secretariat today said an Army sergeant died as 
a 
result of wounds sustained when "a small group of unidentified 
civilians" opened fire on the military checkpoint. According to 
the official report, the Army repelled the "armed assault" and 
the assailants fled. It is believed that they are hidden in 
caves in the mountains near the site of the skirmish. There is 
no word on casualties among the attackers. 
  An hour afer the clash, which began at approximately 0530 
(1130 GMT), several Armed Forces helicopter gunships were still 
flying over the area and firing, according to reports from 
residents. The area was reopened to traffic after it had been 
sealed off for several hours. 
  The EZLN recently charged that the Army has been mobilizing 
troops and warned that such deployments threaten the peace 
process, which began on 21 February. The first phase of the 
peace process ended on 2 March when the government announced its 
responses to a 34-point list of demands submitted by the rebels. 
  In the wake of the murder of Luis Donaldo Colosio, the 
ruling 
party's presidential candidate, the EZLN suspended its 
consultations on the government's proposals -- consultations 
that were being held within Indian villages located in the 
EZLN's area of influence.

<F P=106> [Report on communique by Manuel Camacho Solis, Chiapas peace </F>
and reconciliation commissioner, to the Zapatist National 
Liberation Army (EZLN) General Command dated 15 April; from the 
"ACIR Radio News" newscast] 
  [Text] The Office of the Chiapas Peace and Reconciliation 
Commissioner issued the following communique a few minutes ago, 
addressed to the EZLN General Command. I am going to read the 
whole communique. It is a bit long, but you should be informed 
in detail. 
  Just when progress is being made, the communique states, to 
facilitate a return to dialogue, to the negotiations aimed at 
finding a political solution to the situation in Chiapas, the 
regrettable attack on the military checkpoint on the road to 
Chicoasen has been carried out. 
  The message of concordance with facts [mensaje de concordia 
con hechos] of the past few days are: 
  1. The three branches of the Chiapas government, Manuel 
Camacho says, have given clear signs they are preparing the 
Chiapas State's response to the commitments for a worthy peace 
in the established terms and within the scheduled calendar of 
events. This paves the way for in-depth institutional changes 
that will provide answers to the problems you have presented. 
  I repeat, this is the communique Manuel Camacho Solis sent 
to 
the EZLN General Command. 
  2. The National Human Rights Commission has recommended 
to the attorney general of the republic the charges against 16 
of the 21 people being held at the Cerro Hueco Jail for their 
alleged participation in the early January 1994 incidents be 
dropped. Juan Carlos Santoyo reported on this yesterday. 
  The third point in Manuel Camacho's communique to the EZLN 
states: 
  3. The Chiapas government and the indigenous and peasant 
organizations that form the COIC [expansion unknown], signed a 
very important commitment yesterday to suspend all illegal 
occupation of lands and to study the situation of each property 
until a fair and satisfactory solution for all parties involved 
is reached. 
  4. The Mexican Bishop's Conference has called on the 
mediator, commissioner, and the EZLN to immediately resume the 
dialogue. 
  5. Prominent citizens who are committed to peace and 
involved in nongovernmental and human rights organizations are 
demanding the resumption of dialogue as soon as possible. 
  6. In the past few hours additional efforts to reach 
agreements have been made in the hopes of finding a quick 
solution to the problem of those who were recently expelled from 
(San Juan Chamula). 
  7. The Mexican Army has strictly abided by its commitment 
to a cease-fire and has done all it has been asked to do to 
strengthen the political solution to the problem. 
  In conclusion, Manuel Camacho Solis' communique states: We 
are keeping our word. Once again a strategy of messages of 
concordance with facts is being drafted to facilitate the return 
to the dialogue and negotiation. In this context, Camacho Solis 
adds in this communique to the EZLN it is very important that 
the EZLN clearly state its position regarding this morning's 
incident. Camacho is obviously referring to the incident that 
occurred just outside Tuxtla Gutierrez [words indistinct]. The 
Mexican Army, Camacho added, is still determined to cease all 
fire. This commissioner respectfully suggests: 
  Within the current political situation, and after the 
decisions I have mentioned have been made, it is highly 
recommended you issue a statement that will leave no doubts on 
the EZLN's position in light of the attack on the military 
checkpoint. This is necessary, but I do not believe it is 
enough. What the people are demanding is the resumption of 
dialogue and negotiations to find a political solution to the 
conflict, Manuel Camacho states. 
  Camacho concludes by stating: Despite the risk all of this 
represents, and even in light of a possible provocation, your 
decision favoring a dialogue will be a clear sign of your 
willingness to find a political solution and a worthy peace in 
Chiapas. 
  [Signed] Sincerely yours, 
  Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis 
  [Date] 15 April 1994.

  [Text] Mexico City, 16 Apr (EFE) -- The Zapatista National 
Liberation Army [EZLN] said it has no involvement in the attack 
on an Army post, which took place in Tuxtla Gutierrez, Chiapas 
State, in southeastern Mexico, on Friday. In a communique sent 
to the media, EZLN leader "Subcommander Marcos" indicated that 
the EZLN has no military position at all or troops in the area 
where the attack took place. 
  Unidentified persons early Friday morning attacked an Army 
post in the town of Chicoasen, some 8 km from the Chiapas State 
capital, in which a sergeant was killed. "The EZLN does not 
have good weapons or sufficient vehicles, but it does have 
military honor and its word; the EZLN promised, if it is not 
attacked, not to carry out offensive military operations against 
federal troops or their positions," the communique stated. 
  The rebel group reiterated its commitment to respect the 
cease-fire and promised not to carry out offensive military 
actions against government forces in the entire national 
territory under the conditions set forth on 12 January when the 
truce was accepted. Marcos reiterated the guerrillas' commitment 
to continue working for a dialogue in search of peace with 
justice and dignity. He added that the EZLN is waiting for the 
reestablishment of the proper conditions to resume the dialogue 
with the government. 
  The EZLN rose up in arms on 1 January to demand social 
justice for the Indians, and their clashes with the government 
forces lasted until 12 January, when a cease-fire was decreed by 
both sides.

  [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas, Mexico, 16 Apr (AFP) -- 
Samuel Ruiz, the bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas bishop, 
today announced that the Zapatista National Liberation Army 
(EZLN) has asked him to seek mechanisms leading to a resumption 
of the dialogue with the government, the first phase of which 
concluded on 2 March. 
  At a news conference, Ruiz (the mediator in the dialogue) 
said he had received "verbal" communication from the EZLN, and 
he added that it is just "a matter of days" before the 
resumption of the dialogue would be announced. 
  On 2 March, the government forwarded several proposals to 
the 
EZLN in an effort to end the armed conflict in the Mexican state 
of Chiapas. At that time, the guerrilla organization began 
conferring with its grass-roots organizations, but the 
conferences were suspended following the 23 March assassination 
of presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio. 
  Ruiz did not rule out the possibility that a renewed 
dialogue 
could still fail to result in the signing of a peace agreement, 
but he added that the new sessions would allow the two sides to 
review proposals "and, in turn, determine how we might best be 
able to set out on a firm footing."

<F P=106> [First of three-part report on interview with Peace and </F>
Reconciliation Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis by special 
correspondent Miguel Angel Granados Chapas; place and date not 
given] 
  [Text] On the eve of issuing a communique for his Zapatist 
interlocutors, Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis explained 
his assessment of the causes of the conflict and outlined the 
strategies he will employ during the second round of 
negotiations. 
  He asked us "not to get bogged down" between the 
revolutionary and fundamentalist position and the reactionary 
and controlling position, both of which are understandable. Let 
us go on and devise the strategies for the second round of 
negotiations, he said. 
  "I would like to divide the strategies into three key 
issues. 
I believe this division is where the secret of today's peace 
lies. I also believe this division would bring bountiful results 
to the rest of the country." 
  He pointed out that the three key issues will have 
"instrumental" and "institutional" contents, as well as a 
"positive change of mind." 
  The commissioner said that the three issues are essential to 
achieving peace. 
  "It is a big mistake to think that we can achieve peace by 
brandishing rifles. The two parties involved will fail to reach 
a complete military or political victory. Thus, let us forge a 
worthy, just, and serious peace," he added. 
  [Granados] What would the instrumental content be in two of 
the conditions? 
  [Camacho] The first one involves avoiding belligerence; that 
is, to avoid the internationalization of the conflict. I 
believe this is a cost that Mexico must never pay. Should such 
a cost mean the division of Mexico, I would reject it, because 
we have taken care of the country for 150 years; it is the only 
legacy we have. 
  We cannot allow the dynamics of the conflict to lead to 
eventual U.S. intervention in our domestic conflicts and direct 
control over the Mexican political process. 
  This is a limitation. The other limitation is that we must 
look at the arms issue responsibly. No insurgent army can be 
disarmed overnight. Disarmament processes take years and must 
be guaranteed. 
  It is very clear to me that there cannot be peaceful 
conditions should the arms buildup increase in the region 
controlled by the EZLN [Zapatist National Liberation Front]. 
  This cannot happen. Such instrumental guarantees must 
prevail to achieve peace. Should there be more arms or should 
we internationalize the conflict, peace would not be possible in 
Chiapas. Therefore, peace would not be possible in the rest of 
the country, thereby bringing more consequences. 
  Here is where we begin. It is nothing more than taking into 
account concerns and establishing a framework of guarantees 
acceptable to everyone. 
  [Granados] How do you define change of mind? 
  [Camacho] It is a change of mind for everybody; that is, a 
change of mind for all of us directly involved in the conflict. 
  In other words, if discriminating against Indians is one of 
the factors that worsened this conflict, then people who 
discriminate against Indians must change their minds as a 
condition for establishing peace. 
  A change of attitude, behavior, and values with regard to 
the 
government's relations with Indian communities is needed; 
however, these cultural changes take too much time. Therefore, 
we need institutional changes. 
  Institutional changes fail to change minds completely, but 
they uncover opportunities quickly and guide things in a new 
direction. This is the new framework for the construction of 
peace. 
  [Granados] Can you tell us about your participation in the 
negotiations? 
  [Camacho] We proposed that the agenda for the peace and 
reconciliation talks that are to be held in San Cristobal de las 
Casas be limited to the subjects of Chiapas and the Indians. The 
EZLN people wanted very much to include on the agenda election 
subjects, changes in the IFE [Federal Electoral Institute], a 
special term to guarantee an impartial election, and 
nonexclusive governmental control of the country's electoral 
structure. We found a practical, common sense, and efficient 
solution. We did not make it into a decision-dependent subject. 
We gave it a political solution because that is what mattered. 
There was great concern here, because we in Chiapas talked about 
the desirability of a special term, a political reform, a change 
in the IFE, and citizens' participation in the IFE. We did not 
want to intervene in congressional decisions. We were endorsing 
the agreement for peace, justice, and democracy that the 
political parties and the candidates had signed, all of which 
appears right to me. We took into consideration what had been 
done at the chamber, but we also were making a commitment to one 
of the political options that would facilitate finding a 
solution to the current Chiapas conflict. 
  [Granados] Was there a personal position? 
  [Camacho] Yes. That was the advantage of having a 
commissioner. I was not speaking as a secretary of state, but in 
my own name. I was a representative of the president and 
therefore had to be very careful. But that was all. 
  [Granados] Is there a similar framework in the institution? 
Is there a limit that the president of the republic has set or 
that has been suggested to him by his own perception of the 
matter? 
  [Camacho] Our proposal was a response to a sort of petition. 
This petition, however, was not a sleight of hand or something 
we drafted while writing on our knees. Through this response, 
we extracted everything possible from the fragile balance of the 
economy and the country's constitutional order. It was a big 
response to a very big demand. From this viewpoint, the room for 
additional subjects is limited. I also think, however, that it 
would be a very serious error to say that everything has been 
said. Rather than entering a second negotiation, which would 
lead nowhere because it would create additional conflicts 
everywhere, conflicts that would have prevented the most 
important point from being complied with, the important thing is 
for us to regard what we have proposed as a beginning. These 
are actions that would be carried out anyway, because the 
response is fair. It is the government's duty to meet the new 
terms. But that is a beginning. Whether or not additional 
responses can be constructed in due time and proper political 
conditions cannot be decided at present. This is to say, the 
question of whether or not there can be an additional 
Constitution reform cannot be settled on a short-term basis, 
such as by June 1994. 
  [Granados] How can the rest of the country, where there is 
dissatisfaction, be told: Be patient; do not rise up in arms; we 
are solving this problem? The Chiapas people did rise up in 
arms and required answers. 
  [Camacho] I do not think they will take up arms. People do 
not rise up in arms just like that. There are people who speak 
of taking up arms. This decision, however, is a complex one, 
and requires a long time and organization. I think we should 
not fall for either the threat that someone will take up arms or 
the shortsightedness of a government asking people to be patient.

    [Editorial report] Mexico City Canal 13 Television Azteca 
Network in Spanish at 0207 GMT on 18 April broadcasts the 
"Elections 94" program, which consists of a recorded studio 
interview with Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, the presidential 
candidate for the Mexican Institutional Revolutionary Party, 
PRI, by Marisa Escribano. 
  The interview begins with a discussion of Zedillo's 
childhood. When asked what motivates him, Zedillo says serving 
Mexico. 
  At 0222 GMT Escribano says the country is experiencing some 
hard times. She asks how can they face the problems. Zedillo 
says they must remain calm and resort to the values that have 
given the country strength. Escribano notes the economy is on 
the right path, but there is still much unemployment. Zedillo 
responds: "I have pointed out again and again that unemployment 
is one of Mexico's most serious problems at present. Let me 
tell you that I have mentioned Mexico's four big problems. The 
first one, which I mentioned earlier, is insecurity and 
injustice, followed by unemployment, insufficient wages, and 
poverty and inequality. From my point of view, we have to 
attack these four problems on several fronts and simultaneously. 
We must have greater justice in our country. Why greater 
justice? What does it have to do with unemployment? We want to 
have a growing economy, one which creates jobs with plenty of 
productive investment." 
  He goes on to say that the country must make an effort to 
train its workers, improve the infrastructure, and work on the 
social policy. 
  At 0235 GMT Escribano asks whether the economic adjustment 
measures now need to be relaxed. Zedillo answers: "I believe 
conditions to stabilize the economy are essential to promote 
development that will benefit most Mexicans. You are right; I 
have heard people say that fighting inflation should not be so 
important. These people seem to forget that inflation affects 
the poorest Mexicans the most. The largest decrease in real 
salaries, in terms of purchasing power, occurred at the time 
when inflation reached the highest levels: the 1970's and 
1980's. I believe having a healthy, balanced, and low-inflation 
economy is essential, but it is insufficient to generate 
widespread prosperity." 
  The interview then moves on to the topic of education, about 
which Zedillo says the education system needs to be flexible, 
the opinions of teachers must be taken into account, and the 
bureaucracy must be reduced. 
  At 0245 GMT they begin to discuss what type of father he is 
for his children and how he will balance his role as a father 
with that of being president. Escribano then asks how Zedillo 
views the future of Mexico. He says: "I look at Mexico's 
future with great optimism. As I said before, I look at it with 
great hope. Our problems are big, but our potential and 
determination as a country to confront these problems are great. 
I think there are solutions to our problems. I think that, 
historically speaking, the Mexican people have proven to possess 
an enormous capability to meet challenges even bigger than those 
we face at present. I envision Mexico at the end of this 
century or at the beginning of the next one as a strong and 
united nation, with an expanding economy, whose product will be 
distributed more equitably; a fully sovereign nation with a 
stronger democracy, as all Mexicans desire, a nation respected 
in the world." 
  The final question is on whether he will participate in a 
debate with the other presidential candidates. Zedillo says he 
wants to debate the other candidates and is convinced the debate 
must take place. 
  The interview and program end at 0255 GMT.

  [Text] Mexico City -- Presidential candidates, legislators 
from the various political parties, and political leaders 
yesterday expressed annoyance over what they considered U.S. 
meddling in Mexico's problems. This is because democratization 
and respect for human rights in Mexico appear to comprise a 
primary concern in the 1995 U.S. defense budget. 
  Labor Party presidential candidate Cecilia Soto said 
yesterday that the Pentagon's explicit concern for Mexico's 
democratization and respect for human rights, as outlined in its 
1995 budget, represents an erroneous position. 
  She said: "It is a completely erroneous position. If any 
country has shown the world it has violated human rights, it is 
the United States. Rodney King's case and frequent abuses 
incurred by Mexican illegal aliens are clear examples of this." 
She also stressed that human rights violations in Mexico do not 
pose a security threat to the United States. 
  Mexican Green Party candidate Jorge Gonzalez Torres said the 
Pentagon's budget blueprint could be a prelude or a 
justification for military intervention. He said: "The fact 
that they are discussing Mexico's lack of democracy might 
indicate that they are preparing a military intervention." 
  Gonzalez Torres also said the document serves as a means of 
softening public opinion for possible intervention in the event 
that Mexico becomes increasingly unstable. He added, however, 
that the Pentagon cannot legitimately give an opinion on these 
issues because the Pentagon is strictly a military organization 
that has a history of interventionism. 
  Gonzalez Torres described the fact that Mexican soldiers are 
training in the United States as "suspicious," because a corps 
could be trained for a possible "coup d'etat." He said, "They 
could be preparing an Army corps for a possible coup d'etat -- a 
corps that could seize control." He added that the U.S. 
position fails to take into account the Mexican people's needs 
and the abject poverty being experienced in the countryside. 
  Popular Socialist Party presidential candidate Marcela 
Lombardo Otero said yesterday that the Pentagon's training of 
Mexican troops is a threat to the country's sovereignty and 
harms the Mexican Army's patriotic, nationalistic, and popular 
ideology. 
  Lombardo Otero contended the Pentagon is giving military 
advice because the U.S. Government wants to meddle in Mexico's 
internal affairs through any means possible. Moreover, she 
said, this kind of interaction distorts the perception that the 
Army is serving as a patriotic and nationalistic entity that 
traditionally has maintained a great sense of obligation to the 
community. 
  "This presents tremendous danger to Mexico, particularly 
because this nationalistic and popular Army that we have is in 
charge of national security," she said. 
  Meanwhile, Hector Delgado, speaking on behalf of the 
Cardenist Front for National Reconstruction Party, said it is 
all right for the Mexican Army to be trained by the Pentagon, 
provided that this training does not undermine the country's 
sovereignty. 
  "It is good that Army troops train in other places to 
acquire 
greater skills and learn different things," he said. "There are 
Mexicans who are in training programs sponsored by the 
Inter-American Development Bank and GATT, and, therefore, it is 
not bad for people to train," Delgado said. 
  He said that despite the benefits of having the Army train 
in 
the United States, precise limits and restrictions should be 
established on this kind of training to prevent Mexican 
soldiers' integrity or national sovereignty from being 
undermined. 
  PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party], PAN [National 
Action 
Party], and PRD [Party of the Democratic Revolution] deputies 
all have described the Pentagon's position as meddlesome.

    [Text] The move by Citibank out of the Argentine Banking 
Association (ABRA), comprised of foreign banks in Argentina, and 
into the Association of Argentine Banks (ADEBA), made up of 
private banks financed by Argentine capital, caused a "great 
stir" in the national financial system, according to the 21 
March Buenos Aires daily CLARIN. Made on the heels of the 21 
February banking deregulation decree, the move, which 
"significantly alters the balance of power between ABRA and 
ADEBA," according to CLARTN of 10 March, may be the beginning of 
"even greater bloodletting" from ABRA, as "part of a strategy to 
force a merger of the two banking organizations." While ABRA was 
unhappy about the Citibank decision, as well as fearful that 
other members might follow suit, private Argentine banks were 
pleased to have the country's most important foreign bank as a 
new member of their group. "It is an honor for us," asserted 
ADEBA head Eduardo Escasany. 
  The two banking organizations came out on opposite sides of 
the debate over the new banking competitiveness rules, which 
opened up the Argentine market to foreign banks without 
requiring "reciprocity" from their home countries. ADEBA, 
demanding reciprocity, was the first to "scream bloody murder" 
over the new rules aimed at reducing interest rates and the cost 
of banking services in general, according to the 9 March LA 
NACION. On the other hand, ABRA said the measures would 
"stimulate competition" while increasing efficiency. When asked 
whether the "oversized" Argentine banking market, totaling 164 
private and public banks according to Central Bank data, would 
discourage foreign banks from establishing themselves in 
Argentina, ABRA economic adviser Jorge Lopez replied that 
investment banks linked to the capital market would probably be 
interested as long as the market remained stable and profitable. 
He doubted, however, that commercial banks would enter the 
market due to high costs. Quilmes Bank official Carlos Perez 
cited "the possible reduction in interest rates and an increase 
in capital inflows" as advantages of market deregulation. 
However, he pointed to the possibility of greater capital 
outflows as a disadvantage. "Foreign banks will send their 
profits back to their countries of origin." 
  According to the 13 March CLARIN, large banks in Brazil and 
Chile as well as Spain's Bilbao Vizcaya Bank (BBV) have already 
shown interest in taking advantage of the newly deregulated 
Argentine banking market. Brazil's largest private banking 
group, Bradesco (Brazilian Discount Bank), is "very interested" 
in adding to its current network of 3,000 branches. If 
successful in this endeavor, Bradesco will become the first 
Brazilian bank in Buenos Aires to have an aggressive Mercosur 
[Common Market of the South]-oriented policy. Although other 
Brazilian banks have yet to "pound the local pavement," 
businessmen say that deregulation is attractive enough to bring 
them to Argentina within the next few months. Among Chilean 
banks said to be interested in the Argentine market are 
O'Higgins, one of Chile's "heavyweights;" BICE, which belongs to 
the Eleodoro Mate Group; and the Edwards Group, owner of the 
daily EL MERCURIO. Among other Latin American countries, Uruguay 
is the most likely candidate to enter the market, according to 
CLARIN.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 14 Apr (EFE) -- Argentine President 
Carlos Menem today admitted that, in his administration, "there 
still are officials who commit acts of corruption" and people 
who, "through bribes, instigate the corruption of government 
officials." 
  In remarks to Radio La Red of Buenos Aires, Menem added: "We 
have done away with a system in which corruption had been 
established for many years, that is, the oversized state that we 
had. There were state-owned enterprises that had truly become 
centers of corruption." 
  Menem emphasized that his government "had dismantled this 
system" and asked entrepreneurs to cooperate and "help in 
eliminating these small centers." 
  The reports on alleged acts of corruption within the 
retirees 
social services organization (PAMI) [Comprehensive Medical 
Assistance Plan] has been described by political observers as 
one of the reasons why the ruling Justicialist Party (PJ, 
Peronist) lost in the country's capital the Constituent Assembly 
elections held on 10 April. 
  PAMI President Matilde Menendez, the No. 2 candidate on the 
PJ ticket for these elections, resigned as a Constituent 
Assembly member 48 hours after the elections, but denied that 
she was involved in acts of corruption and asked the General 
Directorate of Taxation (DGI) to investigate her assets.

  [Excerpts] Buenos Aires, 14 Apr (EFE) -- Argentine 
President Carlos Menem indicated today that he supports the 
creation of a "court of ethics" to control "aggressive" 
journalism "that humiliates and discredits without proof or 
foundation." 
  Menem reacted in this way after learning of the acquittal 
handed down by Federal Judge Nerio Bonifatti on Menem's 
sister-in-law, Amira Yoma, in the trial for alleged drug money 
laundering. [passage omitted] 
  The matter was investigated by the Argentine media, which 
gave ample coverage of the trial and discussed the actions of 
the judges and prosecutors in the case. 
  As soon as Yoma was acquitted, Menem vented his anger on the 
journalists who had revealed details of the trial within the 
framework of his periodical confrontations with certain sectors 
of the media. 
  Menem told a radio station of this capital that "in my 
opinion the time has come to create a court of ethics to judge 
those who engage in a type of journalism that is totally out of 
line with reality, an aggressive journalism that humiliates and 
discredits without proof or foundation." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 15 Apr (NA) -- President Carlos Menem 
has promised that freedom of opinion, of information, of 
communication, and the freedom of the press as explicitly 
contained in the Constitution "will not be touched within this 
reform" which is being promoted by the government. 
  He cracked down on "some monopolies" within the media, 
saying 
that their presence "is not in line with democracy or freedom." 
  The chief of state made these remarks during an address on 
14 
April at the industrial complex of the city of Pilar, Buenos 
Aires Province, where he dedicated the new printing works of the 
Agrupacion de Diarios del Interior S.A. 
  Menem recalled the policy that the government has 
implemented 
since it came to power to deregulate the media that is in the 
hands of the state, and to achieve "an atmosphere of freedom so 
that the community can quickly receive basically sound and true 
information." 
  He said: "Regrettably, some old monopolies still exist. I 
hope that as we advance in this transformation process these 
monopolies will adjust to the reality of the country, continent, 
and the World." 
  Menem maintained that "freedom of the press is a dogma 
within 
the framework of judicial order that is contained in the 
national and provincial Constitutions." 
  He then lamented that the people of the interior "are 
outshined by the Federal Capital because only events that occur 
exclusively in the Federal Capital are published, but at times 
as a consideration there will be some piece of news on events in 
the interior; if it is bad news, all the better." 
  "We want federalism to become a reality within the sphere of 
information and communication, and this is something that we are 
still lacking," he added. 
  He acknowledged that "there are other deficiencies," such as 
newsprint, although he believes that "there will be no lack of 
opportunities to acquire manufacturing plants" for this raw 
material "with this type of grouping and with enough capital." 
  Menem also defended the fact that "the media -- newspapers 
and magazines -- must have the possibility of purchasing on 
equal conditions paper for their publications." 
  "This is one of the basic facts of freedom of the press. If 
the media in the interior have to purchase raw material at a 
higher price in order to go to press, this is evidently a 
violation of freedom of the press and communication." 
  He demanded "clear rules of the game if we want to reaffirm 
this life style that we Argentines have chosen: Democracy and 
freedom, and the dissemination of this freedom through the 
media."

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 14 Apr (NA)--President Carlos Menem 
today reaffirmed that the results of the 10 April election was a 
Peronist victory and urged his government team "to not waver in 
pursuing the charge" against corruption. 
  In an impromptu message delivered before the start of a 
cabinet meeting, Menem said that through the results obtained in 
the 10 April election the government "achieved its political 
objective regarding constitutional reform," which would enable 
him to seek reelection. 
  Upon accrediting "the government" with raising the banners 
of 
the fight against corruption, Menem warned that these banners 
"should not fall into the hands of those who would use them 
exclusively for election-oriented purposes." He was thus 
tacitly alluding to the successful campaign and victory of the 
Grand Front in the federal capital. 
  Menem, who asked for "applause" for Communications Secretary 
Raul Burzaco on his birthday, reaffirmed that "Justicialism has 
obtained a comfortable victory in the election of delegates for 
the Constituent Assembly." 
  According to government sources, Menem attributed the 
Justicialist setback in the federal capital "to the historically 
proven volatile nature of the federal capital voters," who cast 
their vote "in accordance with historical circumstances." 
  Commenting to his ministers on the reason for the decline in 
ballots cast in this election for the Justicialist Party 
compared to those of 1993, Menem said that this was due to "the 
special nature" of the 10 April elections. He noted that on 10 
April "the ballots were not being cast to elect executive branch 
or legislative officials" nor were they intended to decide the 
economic course. Hence, he said, "small parties were able to 
capture more votes." 
  Underlining the importance of the Justicialist victory, he 
noted that the Justicialist Party won in "123 of the 127 
districts" in Buenos Aires Province and "in all of the 31 
districts" in Santa Fe Province. 
  Menem also emphasized the success of the Justicialist Party 
by affirming that "75 percent of the Constituent Assembly 
delegates elected nationwide belong to parties that voted in 
Congress in favor of the constitutional reform." 
  Finally, and before going on to the cabinet agenda, Menem 
urged his ministers to continue "to work as usual" and put aside 
"any pessimistic approach toward the electoral outcome."

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 14 Apr (NA) -- Interior Minister 
Carlos Ruckauf said today that a professional Army "represents a 
mid- or long-term possibility" and ruled out the possibility of 
Argentina being able, at this moment, to implement "this type of 
project." 
  Thus, Ruckauf discussed the possibility of replacing the 
current compulsory military service system with a professional 
Army. He nevertheless refused to make any additional comments 
because this issue does not specifically involve his portfolio, 
but the Defense Ministry. 
  The interior minister stressed: "An unrestricted dignity 
must 
be guaranteed for those drafted." He added that conscripts 
"must not be petty soldiers, but qualified soldiers in order to 
defend our fatherland." 
  In remarks to journalists accredited to the Government 
House, 
the interior minister pointed out: "In my opinion, General 
(Martin) Balza's quick handling of such a delicate situation is 
very significant."

  [Excerpts] Here are the highlights of former President 
Jaime Paz Zamora's six-hour testimony before the Constituent 
Commission. 
  [Begin recording] [Amalia Pando] In his testimony before the 
Constituent Commission, former President Jaime Paz Zamora 
declared he was both a victim of his own mistakes as well as 
those of the Special Antinarcotics Force [FELCN] and the 
Prosecutor's office. 
  He referred to a U.S. plot that is allegedly focusing on him 
because his government defended coca farming at an international 
level and because he invited Fidel Castro to visit Bolivia. 
  [Paz] I hope the commission agrees with me when I say that 
we 
run the risk of our ineffective struggle against drug 
trafficking being used within our country for political or other 
purposes. [passage omitted] 
  Do you not think, when I saw the regrettable way in which 
the 
FELCN and the Prosecutor General acted, I did not wonder how 
they acted in previous cases and how many people may have been 
victims of this irresponsible, corrupt, and superficial 
management of our prisons throughout the country. 
  [Pando] During his administration, Paz Zamora was asked to 
safeguard our sovereignty in light of the obvious intervention 
by the U.S. Embassy. At that time Paz Zamora talked about a 
sham [pacotilla] sovereignty. 
  [Paz] We must not let the FELCN, in the name of the noble 
struggle against drug trafficking, become a nightmare for the 
citizenry as was the case of the Tonton Macoutes in Haiti. 
  [Pando] The former president then made a series of charges 
which had been reported by the media throughout the four years 
of his administration. 
  [Paz] Higher ranking FELCN officers, district prosecutors, 
and the special prosecutors for drug cases receive their 
salaries directly from the financial cooperation granted by the 
United States. This is not normal. I would say this is a 
typical case of cooperation -- which we need -- but which could 
turn into intervention. After all, you obey the one who pays 
you your salary. 
  [Pando] He ended his attacks against the FELCN and the 
prosecutors in a categorical manner. 
  [Paz] Nothing of what was said was true. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Brasilia -- A result of the foreign debt agreement, 
debt conversion will again be replaced by direct investments in 
the country, which were suspended in 1987. This mechanism 
allows foreign banks to immediately receive real cruzeiros to 
invest in Brazil, instead of having to wait to receive payment 
in foreign currency. The Central Bank believes that the country 
will immediately obtain $210 million for the capitalization of 
financial institutions or holdings, whether or not these 
institutions have foreign capital. 
  According to the provision promulgated yesterday by the 
Central Bank, creditors who in 1998 lent fresh money to Brazil 
have two options: exchange the money which has not been used, 
and is still deposited at the Central Bank, for new certificates 
for the rescheduled debt; or invest in the capitalization of 
companies in the country. The Central bank provision demands, 
however, that these creditors have a balance in the PFA 
(Parallel Financing Accord) [Acordo Paralelo de Financimaneto], 
which was one of the four types of fresh money used in 1987.

<F P=106> [Article by Soraya Alencar in Brasilia, and Helena Vieira in </F>
New York] 
  [Text] Brasilia -- After 11 years of negotiations, Brazil 
will today close in New York the most important foreign debt 
agreement ever reached with private creditors. D day is today, 
as the old debt titles will be exchanged for the restructured 
debt bonds. This means that the last four agreements are no 
longer valid, and Brazil will come to pay the renegotiated debt, 
which is made up of five kinds of different bonds. These bonds 
can even be used in the privatization program. 
  According to the new agreement Brazil will have up to 30 
years to pay approximately $51 billion, of which $35 billion 
must be paid to 800 foreign private banks. In the negotiations 
with the creditor banks Brazil obtained two unprecedented 
concessions: First, the payment of the guarantees in 
installments, a clause which until now had never before been 
obtained by any country. From a total $4.6 billion that the 
country must pay, Brazil will disburse $2.8 billion today. The 
remaining $1.6 billion will be paid in four installments over 2 
years. 
  Another triumph for Brazil was closing the deal without 
first 
obtaining IMF approval, as foreseen in one of the clauses. 
Despite the efforts by former Finance Minister Fernando 
Henrique Cardoso, who travelled to Washington last month, IMF 
approval was not obtained. After consulting all the creditors 
the steering committee of creditor banks reported that the 
closing of the deal was being effected independently from IMF 
approval. 
  Central Bank President Pedro Malan, who has been responsible 
for the debt negotiations over the past two years, said in New 
York today that the current agreement ends the chronic problem 
of the foreign debt. His advisers say that in the next six 
years, until the interest on some of the bonds begins to be 
paid, the Brazilian Government will be able to heave a sigh of 
relief and gain the time to stabilize the economy. 
  But Brazil still has other concerns in the foreign field. 
The agreement with the Paris Club, which groups official 
creditors, depends on an agreement with the IMF. The Brazilian 
Government also needs to reach an agreement with the Dart 
family, the greatest non-financial private creditor of Brazil. 
The Dart family holds $1.4 billion worth of old debt titles, 
and it does not accept the exchange conditions proposed by 
Brazil. Brazil fears that the Dart family may file a lawsuit 
demanding the immediate payment of the debt, or that it may 
prevent the exchange of the debt documents today. 
  Pedro Malan, who yesterday arrived in New York, did not want 
to confirm that everything was ready for the exchange of the 
debt titles. In order to protect the Brazilian reserves 
deposited abroad, the Central Bank has instructed the banks that 
operate with exchange to deposit the surplus of the reserves 
purchased abroad in the name of the Brazilian American Merchant 
Bank, a Bank of Brazil subsidiary headquartered in the Cayman 
Islands, a fiscal paradise safe from legal actions.

  [Text] An initial deposit of $2.8 billion, which the 
government will make today for repaying its foreign debt, will 
be the start of a marathon of disbursements which will permit 
rescheduling the debt's principal over a 30-year period. In the 
final analysis, however, how much will Brazil pay in interest to 
foreign creditors over the next few years? It is difficult to 
know the exact figure. Almost 55 percent of the debt 
certificates that are being exchanged are fixed earning papers 
with an annual ceiling of 8 percent interest. Yet in the case 
of fluctuating rates, payments will be subject to the variation 
of interest abroad. 
  Michael Gartenkraut, economic affairs secretary during the 
Jose Sarney government, estimates that the debt agreement will 
permit the government to economize around $2 billion per year. 
He says that the savings will stem from the reduction in 
principal and interest. 
  Gartenkraut says: "These are preliminary figures, as they 
depend on the creditor banks' decision to choose fixed or 
fluctuating interest rates. In addition, they will also depend 
on the level of interest abroad." 
  According to Carlos Langoni, former Central Bank president 
and current director of the FGV [Getulio Vargas Foundation] 
World Economy Center, the debt agreement could increase 
remittances abroad in the long term, but will make payments 
regular. 
  Langoni says: "This agreement is much more advantageous than 
the previous ones, as it will effectively reduce the principal, 
setting more reasonable repayment periods." 
  Langoni agrees with Joel Korn, executive vice president of 
the Bank of America, who believes that the Brazilian foreign 
debt problem has been resolved. According to him, considering 
that Brazil has a good reserves level and increasing exports, 
the debt will no longer be an obstacle for economic growth. 
  "With the reduction of the so-called Brazil risk, the 
country 
will be able to obtain money abroad at a much lower cost. In 
addition, risk investment in the private sector will grow, 
especially by countries like Japan," Langoni says. 
  Not everyone agrees. Economist Gerald Medley, of Pactual 
Bank, believes that as far as obtaining money is concerned, the 
external market is in very poor condition. According to him, 
the reason is the lack of definition of interest rates in the 
United States, and the uncertainties in the stabilization of the 
Brazilian economy. 
  "Banks do not want those papers in their portfolios. Even 
countries that have already concluded a debt agreement, like 
Mexico and Argentina, are finding it difficult to obtain money. 
The time is not right," he says.

  [Text] After three years of negotiations, Brazil has closed 
its foreign debt agreement. The country will pay $51 billion 
over 30 years, representing a 30 percent discount. A maneuver 
by the Brazilian negotiators thwarted threats by the Dart 
family, which holds Brazilian foreign debt papers and does not 
agree with the discount. The Dart family was threatening to 
file an international lawsuit against Brazil for failure to pay.

<F P=106> [Interview with Persio Arida, president of the National </F>
Economic Development Bank and co-author of the FHC2 Plan, by 
Suely Caldas in Rio de Janeiro; date not given: "Arida Preaches 
Free Market Economy" -- first two paragraphs are O ESTADO DE SAO 
PAULO introduction] 
  [Text] According to this economist, who helped write the 
FHC2 [Fernando Henrique Cardoso-second economic program] Plan, 
the state should not intervene in setting wages or freezing 
prices as it did eight years ago under the Cruzado Plan, which 
he also helped write. 
  Rio de Janeiro--After 10 days of a viral infection that kept 
him in bed with a temperature of 40 degrees just before 
Carnival, and then another 10 days in Brasilia to help complete 
the economic stabilization plan, the president of the National 
Economic Development Bank, Persio Arida, was finally able to get 
back to work last week. One of the authors of the Cruzado Plan 
along with economist Andre Lara Resende--the "Larida" duo--he is 
now back on the scene with a package of measures aimed primarily 
at a free market economy without the persistent state 
intervention that occurred eight years ago under the Cruzado 
Plan. Although he agrees that the current plan is conceptually 
very close to the plan published under the Sarney 
administration, "the principle involved is that prices and wages 
must be left unregulated, and that point is absolutely 
fundamental to understanding the logic behind the program," 
Arida says in this interview with O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO. 
  [Caldas] Economist Affonso Celso Pastore says that this plan 
has resurrected the original version of the Cruzado Plan as 
proposed in an article by you and Andre Lara Resende in 1984. 
  [Arida] The plan is conceptually very close to the article 
we 
published in 1984 as far as its basic outline is concerned. But 
its similarity with the Cruzado Plan as that plan was actually 
implemented is minimal. This plan has no price freezes, 
schedules, or price controls. The basic idea is that prices and 
wages must be left unregulated, and that point is absolutely 
fundamental to understanding the logic behind the program. 
Brazil is still living with the concept underlying the Cruzado 
Plan, and it is surprising that later programs were attempts to 
repeat that experiment successfully. This program is abandoning 
that underlying concept. We are announcing in advance every step 
that we take, our policy is one of absolute consistency, and 
with the exception of the wage issue, what we have done now is 
exactly what we announced last December. 
  [Caldas] But it was announced in December that the prices of 
public services would immediately be converted into URV's [units 
of real value], and that did not happen. 
  [Arida] There are differences in detail--in the pace--but as 
far as the basic concept is concerned, what we are doing now is 
exactly what we announced in December. We are implementing a 
program without surprises on the principle that Brazil is a 
market economy. 
  [Caldas] Does the plan contain an alternative for relieving 
the hardships suffered by the needy? 
  [Arida] We are going to rethink the government's structure 
of 
social expenditures. We are studying conceptually interesting 
proposals for the introduction of a guaranteed minimum income 
program, one such proposal being the one drawn up by Senator 
Eduardo Suplicy. The idea is to improve living conditions for 
the poor population by using budget resources shifted from other 
items so as not to throw the budget out of balance. That idea is 
being discussed, and since its implementation requires only an 
administrative decision by the executive branch, it will not be 
long in coming. 
  [Caldas] You talk about the importance of leaving prices and 
wages unregulated. Why were rules for wages adopted? 
  [Arida] That aspect has frequently been misunderstood. If we 
left wage negotiations entirely unregulated, it is possible that 
some wages would be below average while others would be above, 
depending on the category and especially the region involved. 
Forced conversion to the average actually functions economically 
as a protective mechanism. It does not result in any losses at 
all, and it protects the poorest sectors of the working class. 
Moreover, forced conversion has legal justification derived from 
the rules for the nominal irreducible wage level guaranteed by 
the Constitution. This differentiates wages from all other 
prices. And it was what led us to adopt conversion to the 
average. 
  [Caldas] There are proposals in Congress to amend 
Provisional 
Measure 434 in the direction of a wage trigger. Would the 
administration go along with that? 
  [Arida] The concept underlying the Cruzado Plan is 
surprisingly alive in society. Proposals for wage triggers and 
for price increases expressed in URV's are being revived without 
a clear understanding of what the URV is, the reason being that 
everyone is always raising prices. It makes no sense to agree to 
a wage trigger. The correct economic response in cases of price 
speculation is to let the market operate. 
  [Caldas] The oligopolies are not accustomed to obeying the 
rules of the marketplace. 
  [Arida] There are exceptions; there are specific cases that 
cannot be ignored. But as a philosophy, the concept must be that 
of the marketplace--that is what makes sense for this program. 
The provisional measure does not prevent the existence of 
indexing clauses. It requires only that they run for one year. 
  [Caldas] Will the increases negotiated between unions and 
employers be unregulated? 
  [Arida] Of course. The principles of free negotiation will 
be 
respected. But there is a big difference between a wage increase 
based on free negotiation, increased demand, or increased 
productivity and one based on automatic application of the 
indexing clause. There is nothing to object to in the first 
case, since it involves natural phenomena in a market economy. 
The second case is based on a predetermined situation that we 
must avoid. As for the question of whether losses will or will 
not occur when the real is introduced, I would point out that 
the entire matter of rules for issuing the real and providing 
backing for it has not come up yet. That is an important point 
to be brought up further down the road. 
  [Caldas] Could you tell us anything about it? 
  [Arida] I prefer not to. But the point I would like to make 
is, once again, that we do not want to repeat previous 
experiences in which, even though the unit of currency was 
changed, there was no substantial change either in the 
institutional framework or in the conditions for issuing the new 
currency. I am using generic expressions--institutional 
framework, rules of issue, and backing for the currency--to 
emphasize that we are talking about a different monetary system 
associated with the new currency. That contrasts with the 
previous plans, in which the monetary system remained unchanged. 
  [Caldas] Is there really a two-month deadline for adopting 
the real? 
  [Arida] Look, so far we have not done anything based on the 
electoral timetable. We said that we would not begin the second 
phase until the first was completed, and that was how it turned 
out. The third phase will actually depend on our assessment that 
the economic conditions are most appropriate for beginning the 
third phase. There is no pressure--no timetable. 
  [Caldas] What do you mean by "appropriate conditions"? Would 
that be when inflation in terms of the URV stands at zero? 
  [Arida] This matter of the URV is being misunderstood. Since 
the URV is based on a basket of currencies, we will have a 
mixture of three indices. There will be URV inflation when one 
such index is higher than the average for the three. But since 
the average is equidistant by definition, URV inflation in one 
index means that there must be URV deflation in another just by 
the nature of things. So the question of so-called URV inflation 
is not a concern. As regards the proper economic conditions for 
introducing the real, we need to assess the process of forming a 
new social pact, changes in the tax situation, and the issue of 
constitutional revision--the basic features of the way the 
economy is developing. 
  [Caldas] But aren't you afraid that the speculation of the 
past few days will cause URV inflation? 
  [Arida] I understand the problem. But I would remind you 
that 
there is always discipline in demand. Why is it that Brazilian 
automobiles do not cost $100,000? The reason is not that auto 
manufacturers would not like to charge $100,000. The reason is 
that no one would buy their product. A real price increase when 
the economy is competitive--with unrestricted imports and so 
on--is subject to built-in restraint. Certain speculative 
bubbles are disciplined by demand itself. As for the decision to 
introduce the real, that decision will be made at the proper 
time without reference to the electoral timetable. So far we 
have not done anything subject to the electoral timetable. They 
said we were going to implement the plan in January so that it 
would be successful in April. Now the date has been changed to 1 
May because that is Workers Day. There are no electoral 
considerations in this program. It follows its own logic. 
  [Caldas] There are certain cases in which the free market 
does not function in Brazil. The schools have converted their 
monthly fees to URV's without consulting the parents of the 
pupils. The parents must either pay what the school wants or 
remove their children. 
  [Arida] There are specific examples of abuses in which 
government arbitration is useful. I am not saying that that is 
one example. Neither am I being radical or naive. I am stating 
the basic philosophy behind the program, which is based on a 
free market--on freedom for the economic agents to agree on new 
pacts. This program has an educational side. It involves 
confidence in the democratic process, prior announcements, and 
discussion and confidence in the support of society, in 
Congress, and in the market mechanisms. 
  [Caldas] In what areas could constitutional revision help 
the 
plan? 
  [Arida] The timing we were contemplating had constitutional 
revision occurring sooner. The stabilization of a country does 
not take place in one day, and it will not occur even on the day 
when the real replaces the URV. It is a lengthy process from the 
standpoint of time. In that process, structural reforms of the 
economy are absolutely vital in order to ensure stabilization. 
That is where the importance of constitutional revision 
increases, because revision can open up opportunities for the 
economy to modernize itself and for the government to define its 
role and specific functions. It is essential to reform the 
welfare and health systems, redefine the issue of legal 
monopolies, and simplify and restructure the tax system. Those 
are structural reforms which, when you get down to it, 
constitute the real foundation of stabilization. Much more so 
than the emergency tax issue, the URV, or the real. 
  [Caldas] All indications are that the assembly on revision 
is 
going to eliminate the monopoly on telecommunications but that 
the petroleum monopoly will remain. 
  [Arida] Defending the monopolies is completely wrong. 
Telecommunications are a dramatic example. From the shareholding 
standpoint, the privatization of telecommunications has already 
occurred. The government now owns 17.5 percent of Telebras, and 
the rest is entirely in private hands. From the standpoint of a 
good privatization program, the way in which Telebras shares 
were sold over the course of time was tolerable. They were sold 
at ridiculously low prices without consulting the Treasury, 
which held the controlling interest, at all. The only question 
today is the legal obstacle, since ownership is already private. 
The important thing to emphasize is that the whole world 
provides examples of the advantages of competition in the 
telecommunications industry. There is no room for doubt on that 
score. 
  [Caldas] Some economists have been saying that the 
government 
itself will encourage inflation in real cruzeiros in order to 
force prices up, provoke a recession, and allow the new currency 
to take off with a safety cushion. Is that so? 
  [Arida] The program is going to be managed. We have no 
intention of deliberately provoking an acceleration of 
inflation. It has never been considered. That is Machiavellian 
madness. 
  [Caldas] The expression "economic-financial equilibrium" as 
found in Article 7 of the provisional measure is being 
interpreted to mean the intention to establish a price schedule 
in the move toward the real. In what cases would that be used? 
  [Arida] There cannot be a price schedule. As regards the 
expression you mentioned, there is some concern over the 
specific matter of old residential rents, which are covered by a 
specific law and certain rules regarding increases every six 
months. We will have to think about what to do in that specific 
case, which is regulated by law and must be treated differently 
than other cases. That is the only thing.

  [Text] A secret Army report, the details of which were 
obtained by O ESTADO, establishes the precise moment at which 
the Rio de Janeiro numbers game became involved with drug 
trafficking. The report, which was prepared at the request of 
the Eastern Military Command, mentions a 1981 meeting between 
numbers game chiefs -- represented by Aniz Abrahao Davi, known 
as Anisio, from Beija-Flor; Ailton Guimaraes Jorge, known as 
Capitao Guimaraes; and Toninho Turco, one of Rio de Janeiro's 
major drug traffickers who was killed during a major police 
operation in February 1988. 
  At the 1981 meeting -- according to the Army report -- it 
was 
decided that the numbers game people would finance drug 
trafficking in Rio de Janeiro, and that Turco, Anisio, and 
Guimaraes would be responsible for all drug movements into and 
out of the city. In addition, they also would be responsible for 
the trafficking of smuggled arms. 
  A former Army captain who engaged in political repression as 
a member of the DOI-CODI [Department of Domestic 
Operations-Internal Defense Operations Center], Ailton Guimaraes 
Jorge had been under investigation by the Armed Forces since 
1974, when his name appeared in a military inquest in which he 
was charged with smuggling and extortion. At the end of the 
1970's, he left the Army and joined the numbers game. 
  Says the PDT [Democratic Labor Party] deputy for Rio de 
Janeiro, Miro Teixeira: "Capitao Guimaraes gave the numbers 
game chiefs all the know-how in weapons and smuggling that he 
learned from DOI-CODI. His joining the numbers game was 
simultaneous with the appearance of the link with drug 
trafficking." 
  Before that, in 1976, when the progress of the federal 
lotteries posed a financial threat to the numbers game, the 
alliance with drug trafficking was already in design. Top Rio de 
Janeiro numbers game chiefs met and decided that they had to 
"professionalize" the business. In that year, numbers game 
chiefs met for the first time with U.S. citizen Joe Conforte, 
one of the entrepreneurs who controlled gambling in Las Vegas 
and whose name was linked with drug trafficking. 
  During Carnival 1982, one year after a meeting between 
Toninho Turco, Anisio, and Guimaraes, Conforte returned to Rio 
de Janeiro and was welcomed in the theater box of numbers game 
chief Castor de Andrade. He had Moet et Chandon champagne, 
Iranian caviar, lobster, and tropical fruit as dessert. This was 
the final signal that the numbers game would no longer be the 
"innocent" activity of the 1960's and 1970's. 
  As of that time, Guimaraes and Castor vied for control of 
operations. Guimaraes was the first game chief to control his 
business with computers and to expand his activities to other 
states. He also was designated president of the League of Samba 
Schools -- an activity that cleans up the image of game chiefs 
in the eyes of the people. Despite the fact that he was arrested 
one year ago at Polinter on charges of illegal association and 
creation of armed gangs, he is considered the natural successor 
to Castor de Andrade. 
  At a recent meeting in his gasoline station in Bangu, which 
was also used as an accounting office for the numbers game, 
Castor de Andrade reportedly said to some of his employees that 
he suspected Guimaraes. A maneuver to replace him in the game 
might have been under way. After the collapse of Castor de 
Andrade's operation, many people in Bangu began to openly 
disclose the names of the police and attorney general informers.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The Numbers Game Kingpins"] </F>
  [Text] Castor de Andrade -- According to the district 
attorney he is the head of the gang. A law graduate, he was 
disbarred by the Brazilian Attorneys Association. He is the 
honorary president of the Mocidade Independente de Padre Miguel 
samba school and a sponsor of the Bangu Atletico Clube soccer 
club. Before being sentenced last year by Judge Denise 
Frossard, he had been arrested by the Federal Police and by 
Interpol for making illegal profits, for being involved in video 
poker games, and for his participation in managing casinos. 
Regarding the numbers game, his area of influence is the West 
Zone, in the neighborhoods of Bangu, Marechal Hermes, Realengo, 
Senador Camara, and Mangaratiba, where he operates with his son 
Paulo Roberto de Andrade e Silva, who is also known as Paulinho 
da Mocidade. Andrade has been free thanks to a writ of habeas 
corpus granted by the Rio de Janeiro Superior Court. Paulinho 
remains under arrest at Interpol. 
  Anis Abraao David -- He is better known as Anisio da Beija 
Flor. He patronizes the Beija Flor samba school. He controls 
the numbers game in Nilopolis and Nova Iguacu, in the Baixada 
Fluminense district. In 1978, he was charged with having 
ordered the murder of wall painter Misaque Jose Marques and of 
advertising expert Luis Carlos Jatoba. He was tried and 
acquitted. In 1991, his former wife Eliana Muller was murdered. 
The police found a letter written by Eliana in which she holds 
her former husband accountable for anything that should happen 
to her. Eliana also held Anisio responsible for the murder of 
Misque and Jatoba. Based on this evidence, District Attorney 
Antonio Carlos Biscaia has requested that the case be reopened. 
Anisio is being held in the Ferreira Vieira Neto prison in 
Niteroi, where he receives privileged treatment. 
  Ailton Guimaraes Jorge -- He demands to be called Captain 
Guimaraes because he was an Army officer, but was expelled from 
the force over smuggling charges. He is listed by human rights 
groups as a torturer at the Doi-Codi [International Operations 
Department-Internal Defense Operations Center]. He is a former 
president of the Independent League of Samba Schools (Liesa). 
He controls the numbers game in Niteroi and in the Lagos 
Region, but his businesses extend to Espirito Santo State and 
even to Paraguay. He has already been fined by the Federal 
Revenue Secretariat [SRF] in the amount of $120,000. He was 
also sentenced to six years in prison by Judge Denise Frossard 
on charges of belonging to an armed gang. At present he is 
serving time at Interpol, one of the various police 
organizations having taken graft from the illegal game operators. 
  Waldemir Paes Garcia -- He is nickamed Miro. He is the 
richest among the numbers game kingpins. He is so rich that his 
colleagues only call him Bradesco [Brazilian Discount Bank]. He 
patronizes the Unidos do Salgueiro samba school and controls the 
numbers game in Tijuca, Vila Isabel, and Andarai. He owns 
casinos and ranches in Paraguay. He gained power and money when 
he inherited the businesses of his then partner Angelo Maria 
Longas, known as Uncle Scrooge, who died in 1987. In 1988, he 
was arrested by federal agents who broke into the Barao de 
Drumond Casino in the Baixada Fluminense. Miro is the father of 
Waldemiro Garcia, nicknamed Maninho, who was almost expelled 
from the numbers game leadership for having opened fire on actor 
Tarcisio Meira Filho and Carlos Gustavo Santos Moreira, aka 
Grelha, whom he left paralyzed. Father and son were sentenced 
last year to six years in prison. They are both serving time at 
the Ferreira Vieira Neto Prison in Niteroi. 
  Raul Correa de Mello -- Raul Capitao is 84 years old. In 
addition to being the oldest, he is also one of the richest 
among the numbers game kingpins. He controls the game downtown, 
in the Ilha do Governador, and in other states. Marco Aurelio, 
a son of Raul Capitao, was murdered in 1987, presumably on 
orders of the other kingpins. This incident shook the numbers 
game structure. Because of his old age and poor health -- he 
suffers from Parkinson's disease -- the Superior Court granted 
him a writ of habeas corpus so that he may stay free while his 
appeal of the sentence of Judge Denise Frossard -- who sentenced 
him to six years in prison on charges of belonging to an armed 
gang -- is heard. 
  Carlos Teixeira Martins -- A Portuguese citizen, whose 
nickname is Carlinhos Maracana, patronizes the Portela samba 
school and the Bangu soccer club. He owns a chain of 
supermarkets and is, among the kingpins, the one who has had 
most contacts with politicians. During the administration of 
Moreira Franco, he was decorated with the Pedro Ernesto Medal, 
the highest honor conferred by the Rio de Janeiro City Council. 
He controls hundreds of game points in the suburbs, especially 
in Madureria, Pavuna, and Rocha Miranda, as well as in Brasilia. 
He was also sentenced to six years in prison and is serving 
time at the Vieira Ferreira Neto Prison in Niteroi. Their ward 
is known as the Place of the Yellow Woodpecker [Sitio do 
Pica-pau Amarelo] -- a reference to the comfort enjoyed there by 
the inmates. Unlike the other kingpins, Carlinhos Maracana has 
no direct heirs. Thus, his businesses are being administered by 
advisers. 
  Antonio Petrus Kalil -- In addition to being a numbers game 
kingpin, Turcao is also a prosperous owner of restaurants. He 
controls hundreds of numbers game points in Alcantara, Niteroi, 
Rio (the port area), Minas Gerais, and Bahia. He was charged 
with having ordered the murder of Bahia numbers kingpin Luis 
Carlos Teles de Lima three years ago to take control of the game 
in Salvador. He was fined $5,000 by the SRF on charges of tax 
evasion. Castor de Andrade, Captain Guimaraes, and Turcao make 
up the golden trio of kingpins in Rio de Janeiro. Turcao could 
replace Castor, who has lost face after his "oversight" that 
enabled the Rio de Janeiro district attorney to disclose the 
numbers game accounting records. Turcao is serving a six-year 
term at the Ferreira Vieira Neto Prison in Niteroi. 
  Jose Petrus Kalil -- He is nicknamed Zinho. He is the 
self-styled spokesman of the numbers game kingpins. He is an 
economist and a brother of Turcao. He used to patronize the 
Mangueira samba school, but now patronizes the Estacio de Sa 
school. He controls points in the downtown area. He is the 
most discreet among the kingpins because he has been rarely seen 
in parties or in the company of distinguished people. A former 
partner of kingpin Manuel Nunes Cid, known as Manola, Zinho 
became a member of the select group of commanders of the numbers 
game after the death of his partner. Today, he owns several real 
estate properties and runs game points throughout the city. 
Last year, he was sentenced to six years in prison on charges 
of belonging to an armed gang. Because he is a university 
graduate, he has been remanded to custody at a special section 
of Interpol until his appeal against Judge Denise Frossard's 
sentence is heard. 
  Jose Caruzzo Escafura -- He is also known as Piruinha. He 
controls the numbers game in the northern zone of Rio de 
Janeiro, especially in the neighborhoods of Meier, Engenho de 
Dentro, and Abolicao, where he resides with his entire family. 
In 1992, car thieves stole a car at gunpoint from a woman, but 
they returned the car to her as soon as they found out that she 
was related to Piruinha. A few weeks ago, one of his grandsons 
was kidnapped, but he reappeared a few days later. Sentenced 
with the other kingpins, Piruinha is serving time at the Ari 
Franco Prison. He owns entertainment places and a chain of 
motels -- including one in Jacarepagua, in the western zone, 
which was meant to become a large, luxurious casino. The SRF 
found out that he owns more than 100 real estate properties. He 
has had 14 children by 12 women. He is often visited in prison 
by his women (together). 
  Haroldo Rodrigues Nunes -- In the numbers game underworld, 
he 
is known as Haroldo Saenz Pena. He owns lucrative game points 
in Tijuca, a traditional neighborhood in northern Rio de 
Janeiro. He claims to be just "a simple citizen living on an 
INSS [National Social Security Institute] pension," a retired 
cab driver. He recently sold a shiny Mercedes Benz and a boat, 
even though he has not had financial problems for several years. 
A discreet man, he is one of the most powerful numbers game 
kingpins. Like Carlinhos Maracana, Haroldo does not have a 
direct heir and, while he is serving time for six years at the 
Niteroi prison on charges of belonging to an armed gang, his 
businesses are being run by his managers. 
  Luiz Pacheco Drumond -- He is known as Luizinho da 
Imperatriz, in reference to the Imperatriz samba school of 
Leopoldina, which won the latest carnival samba parade. He 
controls the numbers game in the entire Leopoldina area. In 
1991, the SRF concluded that he could not justify his wealth and 
imposed on him a $24,000 fine. His son Marquinhos Drumond is 
president of Imperatriz and is a councilman for the Liberal 
Party. Marquinhos also served as vice president of the Botafogo 
soccer club during the tenure of kingpin Emil Pinheiro. 
Luisinho is considered to be one of the most violent numbers 
game kingpins, and is suspected of having ordered the death of 
one nephew. He is serving a six-year prison term at the 
Ferreira Vieira Neto prison. 
  Emil Pinheiro -- He owns a fortune, including a princely 
mansion in Angra dos Reis, outside of which he used to anchor a 
huge yacht. A passionate soccer lover, he decided to assume 
control of the Botafogo soccer club. He bought several players 
for the club and managed to have the team win a championship 
after 21 years. He controls game points in the southern zone. 
Nearly five years ago, he was accused of causing the death of a 
manager of the numbers game in Jacarepagua. It should also be 
noted that his partner mysteriously disappeared in 1976. He 
owns several real estate properties in the Barra da Tijuca area. 
He had health problems while serving time at Interpol. He was 
then taken to the Army Central Hospital, where he has been 
staying for 10 months. Last week the Superior Court turned down 
a petition for him to go free while his appeal of Judge Denise 
Frossard's sentence is heard. 
  Jose Carlos Monassa -- He controls the game in Niteroi and 
Sao Goncalo in Greater Rio. He shares some points with Turcao. 
He is president of the Unidos do Viradouro samba school which, 
thanks to his sponsor, has made it to the special group for the 
past two years. One of his sons is married to the daughter of a 
criminal judge. He was the only numbers game "kingpin" who was 
not sentenced by Judge Denise Frossard, but he was sentenced in 
March to six years on charges of belonging to an armed gang. In 
Minas Gerais State, he is charged with a count of murder. He 
remains at large.

  [Text] First Criminal Judge Luis Antonio Villeda today 
instructed Forensic Institute Director Dr. Juan Mateu Llort to 
refrain from making any statements on the death of U.S. adviser 
Julio Ramon Rivera, particularly regarding the toxicological 
test which showed the U.S. officer was on drugs. 
  With several journalists present, Llort said that, due to 
Villeda's orders, he could not make any remarks but that he 
"trusted God and the judge" that everything would come out right 
for the sake of the Forensic Institute's prestige. 
  The judge made this request "so as not to hamper the 
investigations" into the death of the officer, who was killed by 
the explosion of a hand grenade, the safety pin of which he 
pulled, saying it was a toy grenade. The incident took place at 
the police station in Zacamil. Forensic Institute adviser 
Martin Santos has said: "We abide by and obey our laws. We at 
the Forensic Institute will never be belittled by anyone. Our 
analyses are scientific and not biased in favor of anyone. For 
this reason, it will be the criminal judge who will decide who 
is telling the truth." Santos stressed the fact the order to 
keep silent originated with the judge, who surely knows why "the 
investigations should not be hampered." 
  U.S. Ambassador Alan Flanigan has told the Salvadoran news 
media the institute's tests were false and that Jose Maria 
Monterrey, National Civilian Police director, would report on 
the case today or tomorrow. 
  When the ambassador's position was announced, the press 
sought out Dr. Llort, but he replied he must refrain from 
reporting on the situation on the judge's instructions. It has 
been reported the judge will study the institute's tests and 
those carried out by the U.S. Government before making a 
statement. Llort finally said: The prestige and reliability of 
the institute's work has been released to the local news media. 
I trust God and the judge all will come out right. 
  The reporters appeared to have been taken by surprise this 
morning by the turn of events regarding Rivera's death, because 
Ambassador Flanigan himself has announced Police Director 
Monterrey would make a statement with additional details.

<F P=106> [From the "Up to Date" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Shafiq Handal, general coordinator of the FMLN 
[Farabundo Marti National Liberation Movement], has termed as 
logical a U.S. congressmen's request that President Bill Clinton 
withhold economic aid from El Salvador as long as the Salvadoran 
Government does not progress in its democratic reforms. Handal 
has said there is international frustration over both the 
government's failure to comply with certain peace agreements and 
irregularities observed in past elections. 
  Handal said the congressman's request to President Clinton 
shows the international community's interest in the 
establishment of a democratic system in the country based on the 
peace agreements. 
  [Begin Handal recording] Just as the congressman says, there 
is frustration over the progress of democracy in El Salvador. I 
think the congressman is right and is defend the right of the 
people who were unable to vote. [end recording] 
  The congressman has said that progress with democratic 
reform 
is not in sight, because the government is unconcerned with 
fulfilling the Chapultepec Agreements. 
  [Begin Handal recording] I think it will be impossible to 
carry out the necessary reforms before 24 April so that the 
electoral system may become democratic. A radical, in-depth 
change in the electoral system is necessary. [end recording] 
  At the Civic Plaza on 15 April, Handal participated in the 
closure of the political campaign prior to the 24 April runoff 
elections. The activity was marred somewhat when an alleged 
Arena [Nationalist Republican Alliance] activist was caught 
trying to create disturbances. Several FMLN activists captured 
and beat him and finally handed him over to ONUSAL [UN Mission 
to El Salvador].

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on developments related to the run-off in the Salvadoran 
presidential elections scheduled for 24 April 1994. 
  Armando Calderon Sol and Enrique Borgo Bustamente, 
presidential and vice presidential candidates, respectively, for 
the Nationalist Republican Alliance, ARENA, campaigned over the 
past weekend in Sonsonate, Santa Ana, San Vicente, and 
Sensuntepeque. In Sonsonate Calderon Sol said that he wants to 
win the run-off elections convincingly. He stated that "the 
people must categorically show their disagreement with leftist 
ideas." The candidate pointed out that he will continue to 
develop the national reconstruction strategy and work for the 
establishment of a state of law to generate trust in and respect 
for the country's legal system. Calderon Sol praised the 
"political maturity" of parties that will not be in the run-off 
elections, but will support ARENA. Meanwhile, Borgo Bustamente 
said that ARENA did not win the elections in the first round due 
to "a legal technicality," and not because of lack of voter 
support. (San Salvador LA PRENSA GRAFICA in Spanish 11 Apr 94 p 
5) 
  Ruben Zamora, presidential candidate for the Farabundo Marti 
National Liberation Front-Democratic Convergence Coalition, met 
over the past weekend with groups that pledged support to his 
coalition in the run-off elections. He held meetings in the 
Municipalities of Ciudad Delgado, Mejicanos, Apopa, Ilopango, 
and Soyapango, in San Salvador Department. Zamora added that he 
has met with leaders of the Christian Democratic Party and Unity 
Movement, but those parties decided to let their members vote 
for whomever they wish. The candidate denied that fellow party 
members voiced support for ARENA publicly, quite the contrary, 
the coalition has identified "a natural increase in the number 
of followers coming from parties that oppose ARENA." Zamora and 
his vice presidential candidate Francisco Lima will make public 
appearances next weekend in Santa Ana, San Salvador, Santa 
Tecla, and San Miguel to close their campaign. (San Salvador LA

  [Text] Defense Minister Edmundo Perez Yoma has decided to 
again convene the Junta of Commanders in Chief in order to 
expedite government and Armed Forces contacts. The first 
meeting was scheduled for today. 
  The meeting between the defense minister and General Augusto 
Pinochet, Admiral Jorge Martinez Busch, and Air Force General 
Ramon Vega lasted two hours. 
  With this invitation to the commanders in chief, Defense 
Minister Edmundo Perez reactivated an institution that had not 
met since Chile returned to democracy: the Junta of Commanders 
in Chief. The Junta is a Defense Ministry advisory organ 
created in 1960. It is by definition the highest military 
contact with the political power, although it was never convened 
during President Patricio Aylwin's administration. 
  Minister Edmundo Perez decided to reactivate the organ 
because he thinks it is a mechanism that permits an easy 
civilian-military contact. The Junta only deals with strategic 
and defense affairs. During this meeting, the commanders and the 
defense minister analyzed the country's strategic situation. 
  There were no comments at the end of the meeting, but all 
the 
participants looked pleased.

  [Text] Santiago, 14 Apr (AFP-NA) -- It was officially 
reported today that the Chilean Finance Ministry has extended 
the enforcement of the 18 percent surcharge on Chinese textile 
products. 
  The measure aimed at protecting the local textile industry, 
which is facing a crisis of low prices because of an abundant 
and inexpensive supply of foreign textile products, affects 18 
fiber, wool and cotton manufactured products. 
  The Chilean Government has stated that the surcharge on 
Chinese textile products may be increased once a study 
establishes the extent of direct and indirect subsidies received 
by the Chinese textile and clothing industry. 
  Chilean Textile Union Leader Manuel Bustos, who is currently 
president of the United Labor Confederation, has said that some 
Chinese companies have a zero-cost hand labor because people 
serving judicial sentences are used as forced labor.

<F P=106> [News conference by Government Minister Danilo Estuardo </F>
Parinello and U.S. citizens Mr. and Mrs. Rosse, with 
unidentified reporters on the release of U.S. kidnappee Georgina 
Rosse Robyn; place and date not given; from the "Telepress" 
newscast--recorded] 
  [Text] [Parinello] At this moment, as thank God Georgina is 
back with her family, I would like to remind the people of what 
the president of the Republic said on 11 April. At that time 
the president ordered and asked for the support of all the 
security forces, the Army, as well as the police, to help bring 
calm to the Guatemalan people. 
  The fact the child is back at home with her parents is the 
result of the work of all the Guatemalan security forces at all 
levels, at midlevel and top-level. I am talking about the 
operation and the strategy that was developed. It is important 
for you to know this is the result of the first phase of the 
joint operations we are conducting. 
  The Army's patrolling the outskirts of the city has forced 
the bands of criminals to move their hiding places. This move 
helped the police, supported by military intelligence and all 
the Guatemalan security forces, find the group that was holding 
Georgina, return her safe and sound, without the payment of a 
ransom, and bring this incident to a happy conclusion. 
  I would like to add the honest people's cooperation played a 
vital role in this case. We got information from neighbors and 
people who observed strange or dangerous comings and goings. 
This contributed to the return of happiness to a family. The 
family is together again today, thank God. 
  In conclusion, I would like to inform the local press, and, 
through you, the Guatemalan people, this is the result we 
expected. Many times the amount of disclosed information is 
limited, because we do not want the criminals to know what we 
are doing. We can talk about it today, because the outcome was 
a happy one. We ask for your understanding and cooperation. 
  Mr. and Mrs. Rosse and their two daughters are now together; 
they are safe. The president of the Republic, who has been in 
constant contact with us, is very pleased with the outcome. I 
am also very pleased with the outcome, as are all of those who 
were closely following this case. 
  I would like to reiterate my appreciation for the support we 
received from military intelligence and the police. They were 
the ones who rescued Georgina. 
  [Reporter] How many people were arrested, and what are their 
names? 
  [Parinello] Four men were arrested, and their names will be 
disclosed at the appropriate time by the police deputy director, 
who was responsible for the operation. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] state security force? 
  [Parinello] Negative. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] 
  [Parinello] According to the Penal Code there is no death 
penalty for this crime, but if it were up to me, I would request 
the death penalty for kidnappers. 
  [Reporter] Are you going to request the death penalty? 
  [Parinello] I have to do what I was appointed to do. This 
will be a matter the court will handle. The court will decide 
what will happen to those criminals. The criminals are now in 
the hands of court authorities. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] the girl was rescued? 
  [Parinello] Pardon me? 
  [Reporter] How was the rescue conducted? 
  [Parinello] The police director will provide the details of 
the rescue. At this time, the child's parents have only 
authorized me to show you the child. She is safe and sound, and 
let's respect the difficult times they experienced as well as 
the happiness of being united once again. The details will be 
disclosed shortly. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] at the National Palace you 
were going to [words indistinct] Epaminondas. Can you tell us 
something about [words indistinct]? 
  [Parinello] That is not the topic [words indistinct]. 
  [Reporter] How is the child? 
  [Parinello] The doctor who saw her said she is fine. She is 
a bit dehydrated. Her parents are here if you would like to ask 
them. 
  [Reporter] When did you start fearing for the child's life? 
  [Rosse] From the very beginning. 
  [Reporter] What did you [words indistinct]? 
  [Rosse] All I want to say is thank God she is fine, and I 
wish crime in Guatemala could be eradicated. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] 
  [Rosse] [Words indistinct] 
  [Reporter] Was contact made? 
  [Rosse] There is nothing to say; nothing, nothing. 
  [Reporter] Will you stay in Guatemala? 
  [Rosse] Yes. 
  [Reporter] Will the child stay in Guatemala? 
  [Rosse] Why not? Everything is fine. Thank God the police 
did a great job, and I hope there will be changes in Guatemala. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] 
  [Rosse] I do not know. 
  [Reporter] Had you been threatened before? 
  [Rosse] No. 
  [Reporter] What can you tell us? 
  [Mrs. Rosse] That I am very happy. I am very happy to have 
my baby back. 
  [Reporter] How is the child? 
  [Mrs. Rosse] A bit thin, but we can take care of that. 
  [Reporter] How was she treated? 
  [Mrs. Rosse] She said she was treated well. 
  [Reporter] Did the kidnappers contact you? 
  [Mrs. Rosse] Never. 
  [Reporter] Never? Did they [words indistinct] 
  [Mrs. Rosse] No. 
  [Reporter] What do you think of the work the police did? 
  [Mrs. Rosse] The Army and police did a very good job. 
  [Rosse] They did a very good job, and I would like to add 
something that is true. We did not have to pay a single 
centavo. I have been here in Guatemala for [words indistinct], 
and I have seen--please excuse my word--[words indistinct] and 
what they did was just great. The police and Army [words 
indistinct] the United States. I am very pleased and happy the 
situation was resolved. The truth is I did not pay a single 
centavo. 
  [Reporter] Will the child's family now be protected? 
  [Parinello] We will do our duty. Perhaps we can meet and 
talk at another time. Let's allow the family to leave. The 
most important information has been released.

  [Text] Costa Rican President-Elect Jose Maria Figueres was 
received yesterday at the presidential house by President Ramiro 
de Leon Carpio. The two men held a private meeting before 
attending a dinner hosted by the Guatemalan president. 
  The two presidents also held a news conference in the Maya 
Room surrounded by their highest-ranking officials, including 
the foreign, finance, and commerce ministers of the two 
countries. Figueres announced his government's decision to 
improve political, trade, and economic relations with Guatemala. 
  The visitor insisted on praising the peace process and 
voicing his support for the process which, he said, is led by 
President de Leon Carpio. He also said he respects Guatemala's 
internal affairs. 
  He also talked about subjects of special interest -- such as 
coffee, bananas, and exports to the European Union -- and the 
challenge that the free trade agreement represents for Central 
America. However, he said the most important thing at this 
moment is the country's efforts to achieve peace, and he argued 
that economic and social matters were useless without peace. 
  Figueres ended by referring to the possibility that Costa 
Ricans will join the Central American Parliament, but he said he 
respects those people in his country who oppose joining the 
organization. He stressed that a debate on this issue is not 
imperative at this time, only discussions about more urgent and 
positive issues.

<F P=106> [Report on news conference by President Ramiro de Leon </F>
Carpio, following a meeting with Costa Rican President-elect 
Jose Maria Figueres, with unidentified domestic and foreign 
reporters in Guatemala City on 12 April; from the "Telepress" 
newscast] 
  [Text] President Ramiro de Leon Carpio on 12 April flatly 
denied a media report about his alleged secret agreement with 
deputies to ensure that they will extend their terms in the 
National Congress until January 1996. De Leon Carpio held a 
news conference after meeting with Costa Rican President-elect 
Jose Maria Figueres. De Leon talked about the Supreme Electoral 
Tribunal [TSE] decision to hold elections to choose a new 
Congress on 14 August. This new Congress will function until 
January 1996. He pointed out that he will ask the magazine that 
published the report on the alleged secret pact to explain its 
article. 
  [Begin recording] [De Leon, in progress] ...is false. As for 
the first question, through the Public Relations Secretariat of 
the Presidency, we denied the report and asked the magazine that 
published it to offer an explanation in its next issue. We have 
sent the media our explanation that this report lacks integrity. 
In addition, the report mentioned the Army, as well as 
Christian Democrat Alfonso Cabrera. I flatly deny this. I have 
not met with him. If I had, I would admit it. I have no 
reasons to hide it. I repeat, it is untrue that I met with him; 
it is untrue there was such a pact. 
  [Reporter] The TSE today decided to hold congressional 
elections on 14 August. What is your opinion on this decision? 
  [De Leon] Imagine the great pleasure that is overcoming me, 
because it pleases me to say this in front of the Costa Rican 
president-elect and his distinguished delegation, which 
represent Central American democracy. Costa Ricans have upheld 
democracy for so many years. There were times when Costa Rica 
was the only democratic country in the region. We Guatemalans 
admire, commend, and -- I admit it -- even envy them. If there 
is something we lack, it is their democratic system and the 
respect for human rights that has ennobled Costa Ricans and 
their country. 
  I say this because today is a very special day. The TSE 
called elections as a result of a popular consultation. 
Regardless of the number of citizens who participated in the 
electoral process and regardless of abstentionism, the people 
chose to follow this path, the most difficult path. It is worth 
recognizing that Guatemala is following the most difficult, yet 
democratic and constitutional, path. A few months ago, when 
institutional and constitutional order broke down, the 
Guatemalan people requested that the three governmental branches 
be purged. The executive branch acquiesced when I arrived at 
the Presidency. It is still acquiescing, but it asked and 
demanded the purging of the other two branches. 
  Unlike what was done and is being done in other countries in 
which illegal channels are being used, we are resorting to 
democratic ways until we fully comply with the people's 
determination. People won a great battle: They will have a new 
legislative organization -- namely, a new Congress 
democratically elected by the Guatemalan people. They will also 
have a new court of justice. The TSE's decision to hold 
congressional elections strengthens all of these achievements, 
which, along with the new constitutional reforms that have gone 
into effect as the result of the desirable mechanism of popular 
elections, undoubtedly make me unable to hide my great pleasure, 
because, as Costa Rica found out many years ago, we are also 
finding that democratic path, the path of respecting the 
Guatemalan people. I believe the Guatemalan people are 
beginning to know, defend, and love the democratic system for 
the first time. They showed this love by defending it in May of 
last year. 
  I have not been asked to say this, but I am going to say it 
anyway. It is a great honor and pleasure for me to meet with 
the president-elect of our sister nation of Costa Rica, Jose 
Maria Figueres, because he is a great symbol for us. I repeat, 
meeting with President-elect Figueres and his honorable 
delegation is a great pleasure for all Guatemalans, because they 
represent a truly democratic system. 
  As I said before, if there was something we Guatemalans had, 
it was the lack of democracy. We have never, or almost never, 
lived in democracy. On the contrary, our history is plagued 
with all types of dictatorships -- civilian, military, personal, 
collective, open, blatant, and sometimes underhanded. 
Dictatorships, coups d'etats, and electoral fraud plague our 
history. I say this before Costa Rica, which has implemented a 
different system -- a system of accepting the results of the 
Costa Ricans' political resolve. By meeting with Figueres 
today, we are greatly pleased, because we feel we are following 
the same path. 
  We are emulating them, and we are advancing toward that 
democratic path they started traveling so many years ago. 
Additionally, the good relations between both presidents -- one 
a president-elect and the other an incumbent -- are satisfying 
to the Guatemalan Government and the Guatemalan people. This 
underscores the excellent relations not only between Costa Rica 
and Guatemala, but those relations at the Central American level 
as well. 
  President-elect Figueres just said Central American economic 
integration will be further strengthened. This is our 
intention. He also referred to our plans concerning NAFTA and a 
series of issues and objectives that are of common interest to 
Costa Rica and Guatemala, as well as to all Central American 
countries. Therefore, I reiterate before the domestic and 
foreign press that you, Mr. Costa Rican President-Elect, are 
welcome in this country, which is struggling to find the 
democratic path you found so many years ago. 
  [Reporter] Mr. President, after you stated last night in 
your 
message that some countries have opposed [words indistinct] to 
provide the equipment needed to [words indistinct]. What 
countries were you referring to specifically? 
  [De Leon] Well, I would say -- as I said last night in my 
message to the nation -- it is ironic that today, when there is 
a president who respects human rights and who is striving to 
respect human rights and to attain peace, thereby achieving 
respect for individual rights, there appear problems, obstacles, 
and stumbling blocks from some countries that are demanding that 
our civilian military forces be demilitarized. In light of our 
work plan, as we attempt to devise ways to fight poverty and 
achieve respect for economic, social, and cultural rights, it is 
ironic that such obstacles be presented. 
  Nevertheless, when we ask for equipment or support [words 
indistinct] I am not going to answer your question in full, 
because I prefer that the representatives [one-second reception 
break] who have heard this report by the people of Guatemala, 
through their president, reconsider it and note the irony of 
this. At this moment, we need to strengthen civilian security 
forces. To this end, however, we undoubtedly need the aid these 
countries offer to other countries. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Alfonso Malespin Jiron] </F>
  [Text] The armies of Nicaragua and Honduras have agreed to 
conduct "small, joint operations" at the border in which 3,000 
men will participate up to the company level, "without entering 
each other's territory," to neutralize armed groups that operate 
on both sides of the border. 
  "I can neither confirm nor deny if the operation will be 
directed against the FN 3-80 Northern Front; we will 
investigate. I prefer to leave it in general terms," Lieutenant 
Colonel Ricardo Wheelock, spokesman of the Sandinist People's 
Army, EPS, has said. 
  Jose Angel Talavera, El Chacal, has denied the military 
operations are against the FN 3-80, and he said his 250 men who 
are still armed will demobilize on 15 April. "In addition, the 
EPS knows the exact location of my men," El Chacal has said in 
Managua. 
  Wheelock praised the FN 3-80's demobilization, but in his 
opinion, he has said that action will not end violence in that 
area, stressing the EPS will have to fight against the rearmed 
groups. 
  "What will permit the disarming of the FN 3-80 will be 
assigning more funds for the struggle against the rearmed 
groups," he has said. 
  This past weekend, General Luis Alonso Discua, Honduran 
Armed 
Forces chief, ordered the reinforcement of the border with 
Nicaragua to repel recontras who are constantly attacking the 
people in that agricultural and forest area. 
<H5>  EPS Deployment </H5>
  According to Wheelock, that was the Honduran reply within 
the 
framework of existing agreements to a recent clash in which a 
Honduran NCO and two Nicaraguan rebels, one of whom was recontra 
Kaliman, were killed. 
  There will be no movement on the Nicaraguan side, Wheelock 
has said, because the 1,500 Nicaraguan soldiers were deployed 
some time ago. 
  The reasons for this joint operation, the first since 1976, 
are due to the existence of thousands of weapons on both sides 
of the border and an alarming increase in crime in an area that 
was the theater of war: the Honduran former rear guard, and the 
Nicaraguan northern border. 
  According to Wheelock, the EPS believes civilians in the 
northern region have at least 15,000 rifles, which are sold in 
Honduras at prices that are 20 times higher than in Nicaragua. 
  The third reason is the existence of arms caches the contras 
"planted" in Honduran territory, from where its remnants 
operate. Honduran soldiers have promised to destroy them, 
Wheelock has said. 
  According to EPS statistics, last year armed actions in the 
Nicaraguan countryside caused the death of 48 soldiers, 225 
rebels, and 176 civilians. Twelve soldiers, 49 rebels, and 33 
civilians have been killed so far this year. 
  The same statistics give a breakdown of those casualties as 
follows: 95 EPS members, 602 rearmed, and 397 civilians.

<F P=106> [Report by Roberto Orozco B.] </F>
  [Text] The CIAV-OAS [International Commission of Support 
and Verification-OAS] today ruled out that groups connected to 
the 3-80 Northern Front entered Honduran territory and engaged 
in clashes with that country's Army. 
  Colonel Hernan Seaman, chief of the Honduran Army 9th 
Infantry Battalion, informed international news agencies that 
his troops engaged in heavy clashes with groups allegedly 
connected with the 3-80 Northern Front in the area known as 
Chilamates, 300 km east of Tegucigalpa. Two rebels and one 
Honduran soldier, identified as Santos Armando Rodriguez, 21, 
from the border town of Danli, were killed in this clash. 
  "There was no confrontation with any group of the 3-80 
Northern Front, nor has any member of the 3-80 Northern Front 
entered Honduran territory," CIAV-OAS Nicaragua Director Sergio 
Caramagna told LA PRENSA. "All commanders, subcommanders, and 
commandos of this rebel group are within the security zone," 
Caramagna added. 
  LA PRENSA tried to interview Jose Angel Talavera, also known 
as commander "EL Chacal," chief of the 3-80 Northern Front, but 
our efforts were fruitless. 
  "El Chacal" met yesterday with Government Minister Alfredo 
Mendieta to discuss the problem with the Legislative Branch, 
which questioned the executive's decision to incorporate members 
of the 3-80 Northern Front in the police. 
  The Honduran Army is conducting offensive actions in 
territory bordering Nicaragua to reduce crimes by criminal armed 
gangs composed mainly of Nicaraguans who were linked to the 
Nicaraguan Resistance. 
  In this regard, Honduran Army Chief General Luis Alonso 
Discua has ordered reinforcements on the border with Nicaragua 
and has ordered troops to respond "with strength against rearmed 
groups entering the neighboring country." 
  Lieutenant Colonel Ricardo Wheelock, spokesman for the 
Sandinist People's Army (EPS), told LA PRENSA the two armies 
have met to coordinate actions that guarantee security in the 
border areas of both countries. Wheelock termed these actions 
casual operations at specific locations. However, he announced 
larger operations will be conducted in the coming weeks. 
  The Nicaraguan and Honduran armies agreed last month to 
fight 
border crime because crime in general has increased in both 
countries. In Honduras, particularly, gangs of Nicaraguan 
criminals are violating that country's territory. 
  "Assaults, rapes, and robberies have increased at an 
alarming 
rate in southern Honduras, where another dangerous phenomenon is 
also occurring: gun-running by civilians who are not connected 
to gangs of criminals," Wheelock asserted. 
  "What is happening is that in Honduras weapons are sold at 
good prices. This prompts Nicaraguans living near the Honduran 
border to try to sell their weapons left over from the war in 
that country. There are indirect gun-running activities," the 
high-ranking military officer remarked. 
  For Wheelock, the fact the Honduran Army associates criminal 
actions with groups of the 3-80 Northern Front is not an 
important detail. 
  "What concerns us is that there is a tangible manifestation 
of the crime. We have experienced gangs of criminals who 
perpetrate their crimes in other parts of the country and 
identify themselves as members of the 3-80 Northern Front, and 
this is perhaps not true," Wheelock concluded.

<F P=106> [Report by Orlando Mendieta and Lastenia Murillo Munoz] </F>
  [Excerpts] Most of the presidential candidates, political 
leaders, and some authorities expressed some degree of sadness 
when they saw the video showing the outrages committed against 
many people by the military dictatorship. The video was aired 
over a national television network following an introduction by 
President Guillermo Endara. 
  Samuel Lewis Galindo, presidential candidate for the 
Solidarity Party and National Unity Mission (MUN), said the 
video clips presented by President Endara were directed at the 
people, so they will remember the past of the PRD [Democratic 
Revolutionary Party]. "Many of us who suffered those outrages 
in the past have been forced to enter politics so that the past 
will never return," Lewis Galindo added. [passage omitted] 
  Ruben Dario Carles, presidential candidate for the Change 
'94 
ticket, said the video clips broadcast last night "make me want 
to cry because they remind me of those very sad moments we 
endured. What we have seen merits deep thought" by the 
Panamanians, Carles added. Let us hope the Panamanians will 
understand the fiscal problem that existed, the former 
comptroller general said, adding: "Now they know the task I 
undertook, which was to bring order to such a disaster." 
[passage omitted] 
  Juan Chevalier, former government and justice minister, said 
the video showed aspects that must be analyzed -- that three 
political organizations seeking the presidency were linked to 
acts of corruption, weapons, and a specific style of government. 
Chevalier emphasized that the video did not lie, adding that 
everything that was seen was the truth. "What the country needs 
is the truth," the Arnulfist Party member said. 
  Former Supreme Court Justice Cesar Quintero said the 
Constitution prohibits the president from using his office to 
favor a specific candidate. Quintero said that in his opinion, 
that is what Endara did with this message to the people last 
night. The constitutional expert said that Endara's 
presentation of video clips showing the actions of the ousted 
military regime was a "political act" and that the president 
described it as such. "Endara made a political decision and he 
will be the object of either much criticism or support," 
Quintero added. 
  Victoria Figge, president of the Panamanian Association of 
Business Executives, described as "inopportune" President 
Endara's decision to air over a national television network 
video clips of Noriega's military regime only a few weeks before 
the 8 May presidential elections.

  [Text] Professor Ruben Dario Carles, Change '94 
presidential candidate, has said he was moved by President 
Guillermo Endara's video clips broadcast via national network 
last night. 
  [Begin Carles recording] Last night in Chitre, I interrupted 
two important meetings scheduled with area doctors and teachers. 
I watched the documentary on television. I confess I was 
horrified and shocked, and I cried out of shame. What I watched 
and all Panamanians saw as well was the confirmation of what we 
all knew: the disaster and corruption of the military 
dictatorship and their civilian clerks in the PRD [Democratic 
Revolutionary Party]. 
  It matters little that Mr. Perez Balladares now wants to 
downplay the presented documents. Panamanians know this is how 
it happened. The most surprising thing is these individuals who 
appear in this documentary are Ernesto Perez Balladares' closest 
aides today in his desire to deceive democracy and return to 
power. 
  What we Panamanians heard was disaster, inefficiency, and 
corruption, which confirm the efforts we made from the 
Comptroller General's Office to impose fiscal discipline and 
order in the handling of public property, and funds are what was 
needed in the face of PRD actions. Events have proved me right, 
and the Comptroller General's Office was correct. 
  Today, in the face of the embarrassment that affects not 
only 
Panamanians but all citizens of the world, we must think these 
events can never be repeated. Those individuals who want to 
distance themselves from these criminal and immoral acts cannot 
change, because they and their closest allies worked together 
before and will work together again. We cannot allow ourselves 
to be deceived. 
  Civilian and democratic Panamanians who fought together 
against the military dictatorship and against the PRD and all 
their corrupt practices should encourage unity among civilian 
parties to work together and prevent the return of shame and 
dictatorship. We must work together to find a solution to the 
problems that afflict Panamanians, especially those that mean 
poverty and social and economic inequality. This is something 
we should do together. [end recording]

    [Editorial Report] Panama City Television Networks in 
Spanish at 0100 GMT on 12 April broadcast a live debate by four 
Panamanian presidential candidates: Ernesto Perez Balladares of 
the Revolutionary Democratic Party (PRD), Ruben Dario Carles of 
the Change '94 coalition, Eduardo Vallarino of the Christian 
Democratic Party (PDC), and Ruben Blades of the Papa Egoro 
Movement. The debate, which is being held at the Atlapa 
Convention Center in Panama City, is sponsored by the Latin 
American Institute of Advanced Studies (ILDEA) and the Media 
Presidential Debate Committee, and is moderated by Ricardo 
Alberto Arias. 
  Arias begins by saying the debate will focus on four topics: 
the national economy, the Panama Canal and reverted areas, 
social and political problems, and the country's present and 
future. Three television journalists will pose questions to the 
candidates: Luz Maria Noli of Televisora Nacional, Dora de 
Reyna of Telemetro Television, and Julio Miller of RPC 
Television. 
  The debate gets under way with Noli asking Blades what he 
plans to do regarding the $3.4 billion in overdue payments the 
Panamanian Government owes international banks. Blades replies: 
"One possible answer is this: Nothing, which is exactly what 
those individuals in charge of negotiations on the foreign debt 
have been doing. We have a huge problem with the international 
banks. Under the current circumstances, we have no resources to 
amortize this debt." Blades continues by saying that, from 1982 
to 1992, Latin America disbursed more than $110 billion for a 
debt that originally amounted to $330 billion and now amounts to 
$420 billion. He says the nation must concentrate on 
development when dealing with this "immoral and unpayable debt." 
  Asked by Noli about Panama's commitment to repaying its 
foreign debt, Blades replies: "While the Papa Egoro Movement 
recognizes the debts contracted by the Panamanian state, it also 
takes into account the need to repay domestic debts, as well as 
the need to create conditions that will make economic 
development possible." 
  Commenting on this same topic, Carles says: "These debts 
have 
been incurred by the state and must be repaid, but the various 
options available must be negotiated with dignity and firmness. 
I have already said that the current government should stop all 
negotiations with commercial banks and let the next government 
resolve this problem." 
  Vallarino also comments on this issue: "Blades is right to a 
certain extent, but we cannot ignore the fact that Panama, for 
its entire commercial life, has been bounded to the 
international community. Although it was not the Panamanian 
people who incurred this debt, it was illegally agreed upon, the 
money has been spent, and we really have to repay it. We should 
seek rapprochement with the banks and try to utilize the Brady 
Plan or other options, such as exchanging our debts for 
environmental guarantees." 
  When the discussion turns to how the Panamanian Government 
can meet its social goals in light of the burden of the foreign 
debt, Perez Balladares says: "Governments can implement their 
social programs in three ways. One is to levy taxes; another, 
to secure financing through public debt; the third, by way of 
savings." He fails to say which of these means he favors. 
  According to Blades, a government with clearly outlined 
goals 
can successfully handle negotiations on the foreign debt. He 
says, "The problem we have had so far is that we have not been 
taken seriously." 
  Next, Dora de Reina asks Carles how he plans to restructure 
public finances to encourage greater investment. Carles 
answers: "We must continue to stick to the methods we have been 
applying for four years, and we must apply them with discipline, 
seriousness, and honesty." 
  When asked by Reina which government agencies he would 
concentrate on to attain his goals, Carles replies people should 
be required to act in a trustworthy manner. The problem in 
Panama, he says, is not money, but the way in which money is 
used. "We must ensure that those funds allocated to public 
services are returned to the public." Efficiency and 
willingness to work is the key, he says. 
  Vallarino says he views investment differently. "The problem 
of investment in Panama is that investors must be able to trust 
in the government, and the government must be honest." He adds: 
"More investments are necessary, particularly from the private 
sector. This can be engendered by a country that inspires 
confidence." 
  When discussing how to operate the government in tight 
financial times, Perez Balladares says he will encourage reduced 
public spending, although he admits this is not enough. He 
adds: "We are inviting the private sector to participate in 
financing and developing infrastructure works projects. The 
private and public sectors must work together to achieve 
national goals." 
  Blades comments that the country's economic difficulties 
are artificial because the country possesses natural and human 
resources. "Panama's economic difficulties are the result of 
official corruption and the lack of willingness by authorities 
to develop the country. If we eliminate official corruption and 
the lack of imagination and willingness, the economic problems 
will disappear." 
  Carles says he has been arguing for four years that the 
problem is not the lack of money but the use of available 
resources. "We depend very heavily on the private sector." 
  Miller next asks candidate Vallarino if he thinks the next 
government should privatize some state enterprises. Vallarino 
replies: "The next government should privatize everything it 
can, but we must be careful not to harm workers with large-scale 
dismissals. Workers should also be allowed to share in the 
enterprises' ownership." Asked by Miller if obligations with 
the international financial institutions should be honored in 
relationship to this privatization, Vallarino replies that he 
never agreed with the obligations with international banks but 
that they exist so they must be honored. "Public interest comes 
first, then the state's interest. Public interest includes the 
people, families, and the unemployed." 
  Perez Balladares comments: "The criterion for privatization 
should be greater social efficiency. I do not believe in 
privatization for the sake of privatization. I disagree with 
Mr. Vallarino." 
  Blades adds that it is risky to privatize strategic national 
assets such as electric services and telecommunications. "I do 
not think any enterprise in Panama should be privatized if it 
would result in large-scale dismissals. If it must be done, we 
should first try to relocate the workers who would be fired." 
  Carles argues that international banks should not be cause 
for too much concern about privatization matters. "We have to 
privatize services, not institutions. Certain activities of all 
existing institutions can be privatized to prevent loss, waste, 
corruption, and inefficiency." 
  Vallarino concludes: "Privatization must benefit the 
workers. 
When I spoke about privatization, I meant all those services 
that are not monopolies. I disagree with Perez Balladares. 
Ventures in the 1970's and 1980's impoverished the Panamanian 
people and have cost many millions that could have been well 
invested in hospitals, schools, and roads." 
  Noli then asks candidate Perez Balladares the last question 
on the national economy. Asked for his position on the money 
laundering charges made by the United States against Panama, 
Perez Balladares says: "Aside from cosmetic actions, this 
government has not taken the steps that should have been taken." 
He says corporations are chiefly to blame for this illegal 
activity. "The existing instruments in the banking system are 
good enough if they are used. All reports on deposits exceeding 
$10,000 should be fed into a central computer. That would make 
it possible to see at a glance if companies are making cash 
deposits that exceed the sales figures reported to the Finance 
Ministry. Someone should make sure that goods sold in the Colon 
Free Zone actually leave the area to prevent false sales, which 
can be used as a method of money laundering." 
  Blades comments that money laundering is a very particular 
activity that will be very difficult to eradicate, but certain 
measures could be taken. He states: "Control over amounts up 
to $10,000 should be extended to pawn shops and loan companies. 
I am amused when I hear about smuggling, considering that we 
have 1,500 miles of coastline and only a few boats. I wonder why 
the United States and the United Kingdom have not yet ratified 
the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty." 
  Carles says: "I cannot accept the North Americans' drug 
trafficking accusations against Panama after they issued good 
conduct certificates to Noriega." 
  Thus ends the national economy segment. 
  Regarding the topic of the Canal and the reverted areas, 
Reyna mentions that some analysts have suggested that the 
Neutrality Treaty curtails Panama's capability to generate 
revenues. She asks candidates if they have studied the subject 
and their opinion on the analysts' statement. 
  Ruben Blades replies that ``although the Treaty does strain 
our capability to generate revenues, we should not emphasize the 
aspect of tolls.'' Blades emphasizes: "The Canal must have a 
broader function in addition to the simple aspect of toll rates. 
The Canal must be incorporated into a process of economic 
development and the creation of an array of services that do not 
now exist." Asked about an increase in toll rates, Blades 
argued that Panama cannot implement an increase out of the blue. 
He added: "I would call for a direct meeting with the United 
States and the countries that use the Canal most and tell them 
that we must do something because otherwise the operation, 
maintenance, and efficient management of the Canal will be at 
stake. I strongly believe they will be willing to accede to 
changes in the toll policy." 
  On the same subject, Carles argues: "From any angle, the 
Canal is ours and we are the ones who, with good judgment and 
solid criteria, must decide on changes regarding the toll policy 
and services." Considering that Panama does not have a monopoly 
on interoceanic transportation, Panama must examine the effects 
an increase might have on Panama's competitive capability, he 
adds. 
  Vallarino notes that although Article 3 of the Neutrality 
Treaty poses difficulties to Panama regarding tolls, they are 
negotiable. Vallarino stresses: "Article 4 sells our 
sovereignty, and that is why I do not agree with the argument 
that we should not look back." He says running for president is 
like applying for the most important and delicate job in the 
country and says presidential candidates must present their 
references just like any other job seeker. 
  Perez Balladares agrees that users must have some input 
regarding the toll policy. He emphasizes: "What is important 
is not the revenues generated by tolls but the considerable 
wealth that the future utilization of areas bordering the Canal 
could generate." 
  Blades concludes that increases should be considered only if 
they are necessary and that all the benefits resulting from the 
Canal's return to Panama must be invested nationwide. 
  Miller next asks Carles if he agrees with the structure and 
functions of the ARI, the Interoceanic Region Authority. 
  Carles replies that the ARI must be given an opportunity and 
be pressured to work efficiently and rapidly, because gaining 
control of the Canal is a blessed opportunity to profit from a 
geographic situation that is key to the country's development. 
  Questioned by Miller on how to prevent the ARI and the Canal 
from becoming a political pinata, Carles says that it happened 
before during the military period. He adds: "I am optimistic 
that the ARI will be able to make significant contributions to 
the country's progress." 
  Along this line, Vallarino asserts that the ARI is good and 
that it should draft all its regulations and send them to the 
National Assembly for approval. Vallarino believes that "to a 
great extent, the success of ARI depends on who is managing it, 
and that is the bottom line." 
  Perez Balladares comments: "First, I believe that ARI 
decisions must be approved by the president before they are 
implemented. Second, the ARI board of directors must be 
broadened to include more sectors of Panamanian society." 
  Blades states that there are a number of opinions regarding 
the use of the reverted areas. He claims: "I do have problems 
with the way the ARI has been drafted because I can see a future 
conflict between the path the ARI assumes and the path that I, 
as president, would assume regarding the tapping of the reverted 
areas." 
  Noli then asks Vallarino for his opinion on recent polls 
showing that Panamanians want U.S. bases to stay in Panama. He 
replies that the Panamanian people are very much afraid of what 
the government will do with the reverted areas and bases because 
of the many failures. "Panamanians can put all the reverted 
areas to good use and create jobs. A project I studied a few 
days ago would provide between 25 and 50 percent of the jobs 
presently provided by the U.S. Armed Forces stationed in the 
Canal Zone." Asked by Noli if he would favor changes regarding 
the bases, Vallarino replies: "I would show the Panamanian 
people all the things that can be done with the reverted areas." 
  Perez Balladares comments: "I think attention has been 
focused on the wrong issue. The military bases are a military 
problem, not an economic one. Wherever there are military 
bases, the two countries involved agree that the presence of 
those bases benefits them both militarily. In Panama's case, 
the North Americans have said clearly that they do not want to 
stay. If they have changed their mind, they should say so." 
  Blades says the discussion seems like rhetoric. "Panama is 
better off without foreign military bases. We can reap high 
profits from the reverted areas and protect our national 
identity at the same time. An honest government can dispel 
fears of instability and economic depression." Carles counters 
by saying: "The national identity was destroyed by Omar Torrijos 
when he placed us under the Pentagon's umbrella." Vallarino 
comments that Panama should not offer the national territory for 
the bases to stay if the U.S. Government itself has said it is 
not interested. "I am sure that we can turn those bases into an 
emporium of wealth through honest work for the people's good. 
The return of the bases can mark the beginning of our great 
economic growth." 
  Reyna asks Perez Balladares the last question on the 
constitutional amendment proposal on the canal, and he says it 
is not bad. "I would support constitutional reforms regarding 
the canal administration." As for the possibility of keeping 
party politics separate from canal affairs, he replies: "The 
country must make progress between elections and strive for 
national goals regardless of who governs the country during the 
five-year term. This is what we intend to do." 
  Blades says that regardless of what the Constitution says, 
an 
honest government is required. Carles adds that the canal is a 
delicate matter. "The norms introduced in the proposal to amend 
the Constitution by the commission headed by Vallarino considers 
the most important subjects in the canal administration. We 
cannot wait until the year 2000." Vallarino says it is not 
normal to handle these things through the Constitution, "but 
considering the corruption we have seen, it is a good idea to 
include these things in the document to remove them from the 
influence of politics and nepotism and other forms of corruption 
in the government." This marks the end of the discussion on the 
canal and reverted areas and the topic turns to social and 
political problems. 
  Miller asks Blades what he will do to solve the Social 
Security Fund members' complaints about the shortage of 
medicines and hospital beds. He replies that the Social 
Security Fund problem is a complex one. "The government owes the 
fund $828 million in bonds and notes payable. The state has 
been used to divert funds from certain institutions. In 
addition, the state has not developed national economic 
projects. Funds should be redirected to the health sector." 
Asked by Miller about the current retirement age, Blades 
replies that it is risky to speak of bigger pensions and 
retirement unless we can be sure of where the necessary funds 
will come from. "What we need is an honest government that 
manages health resources properly." 
  Carles says the dictatorship and the PRD did away with the 
fund. "We should first consider the technical studies that have 
been done and proceed from there." Vallarino says the health 
problem is serious because many people cannot afford to pay for 
private services. Perez Balladares and Blades agree on the need 
to improve the services offered by the Social Security Fund. 
Carles adds that water service can be improved in a number of 
ways. Vallarino, Perez Balladares, and Blades agree. 
  Reyna then says Panama lags behind the rest of the world in 
terms of education and asks Vallarino what he proposes to 
correct the situation. He replies that "teachers must be 
trained and reassured of their benefits and salaries. We must 
also build schools." Asked about the establishment of private 
universities, Vallarino says they will help raise Panama's 
cultural level. Perez Balladares says: "Our government will 
make education a priority." Blades says education is closely 
associated with health. "We have to make breakfast and lunch 
available to children while they are at school, but we must 
first make sure of our goals." Carles and Vallarino agree that 
education is fundamental. 
  Miller next asks Perez Balladares about the crime rate 
linked 
to the lack of security. The candidate replies: "The police 
have to be given back their self-esteem." "Drug trafficking must 
be fought at its various stages. We must keep young people from 
being lured into it by strengthening the family. Schools must 
be protected, and traffickers must be punished. The police must 
be professionalized." Perez Balladares clarifies that by 
professionalization he does not mean militarization of the 
police, which should be professional nevertheless. Blades 
advocates attacking the causes of corruption. "Officials in 
positions of authority need to set good examples." Carles adds: 
"We need a civilian police force without traces of militarism. 
We should start by creating a real police academy." 
  Vallarino says: "I think it is essential, as several have 
already said, that we must avoid impunity, we need to punish the 
guilty, especially those higher up and the white collar 
criminals, especially when they are public officials. We need 
to punish and act tough with those who are the true source of 
the drug problem." 
  Perez Balladares agrees that the punitive part of drug 
control has to be beefed up but adds: "To truly face up to this 
problem we need to strengthen the structure of the Panamanian 
family." 
  Arias announces that during this last stage of the debate 
with the four presidential candidates, "the topic will continue 
to be social and political problems. Due to time constraints, 
no follow-up questions will be allowed in this stage." 
  Noli asks Blades, if he were president would he back a duty 
free port law for Bocas del Toro Province similar to the law 
already approved for Colon Province, since both places have 
similar unemployment problems. Blades replies that Papa Egoro 
is proposing something even better -- provincial inventories: 
"Each province is being examined to determine its human and 
natural resources and what are its infrastructure and public 
service needs. Once we can determine exactly what are the 
strong points of each province, we will then have the 
opportunity to truly define what the best path is, in economic 
terms, for each province. Nevertheless, as I know the people of 
Bocas del Toro are watching, they should know right now that 
similar to what has been done for Colon, they can rest assured 
that we are not going to forget them, as has been the case up to 
now." 
  Carles then replies to the same question, stressing that 
Panama is a country and we cannot have the country sprinkled 
with duty free stores all over. Instead, Panama needs a 
national economic policy. "We must first test the Colon free 
port system and see how this concept works and then see what can 
be done in the future." 
  Vallarino says that he welcomes the question because it 
gives 
him the opportunity to explain something: "You may not believe 
what I am about to say, but Colon is probably the richest city 
in the world on an average per capita income basis. 
Nevertheless, there are a number of people in Colon who live 
very, very, very badly. The problem is not Colon; the problem 
is helping the people of Colon take advantage of the 
opportunities they have around them." 
  Perez Balladares replies: "To my way of thinking the Colon 
free port proposal is very appropriate for the area of Colon and 
its idiosyncrasy because Colon is located at one of the Canal's 
terminal ports. I sincerely do not believe this is applicable 
to other provinces of the Republic, which have a vocation for 
agriculture, self-production." 
  Arias says that Reyna will ask Carles a question. Reyna says 
that in general, the government in Panama has kept women out of 
posts requiring responsibility. She asks whether Carles can 
make a formal promise for women's participation in his 
government. Carles replies that in the Comptroller General's 
Office nearly half the heads of department were women and that 
they were excellent workers. "In my administration women will 
have the same opportunities as men because experience tells of 
their capacity, dedication, and efficiency." 
  Vallarino again refers to his party's pact and says: "In my 
government, if elected, all land deeds that are distributed will 
be in the name of the couple, in a family. 
  Perez Balladares says: "I want to say that the idea is not 
to passively create equal conditions. I think that we must 
actively and positively establish equal conditions; and under 
equal conditions, we should favor women. Why do I say this? 
Because the contrary has been true historically." 
  Blades points out that his Papa Egoro Movement is "the first 
party in Panama's history to offer, by statute, 50 percent of 
its positions to women." The candidate says he is pleased by 
his colleagues' opinion regarding women. Blades adds that 
"women must be considered not only simply for humanitarian 
reasons, but because they are simply better educated, in primary 
and secondary school and the university, and it would be absurd 
to not use their intellect in a national development project." 
  Carles says that "people are treated equally if they have 
opportunities and are capable. In Panama, education has been 
offered to men and women and this is why both sexes are able to 
compete in the private and public sectors. I think that 
Panamanian women will have great opportunities in the future. 
We have respected their status and will continue to give them 
opportunities and responsibilities." 
  Journalist Miller points out that the citizens are 
constantly complaining about the high rates of utilities, such 
as electricity. He asks Vallarino whether he will promote a 
decrease in rates. 
  Vallarino answers: "Definitely yes. Public utility 
companies are monopolies, and as with all monopolies, they abuse 
people. They abuse with poor services and high rates." He 
calls for the regulation of public utilities as should be done 
with any monopoly. 
  Perez Balladares says that "we must find ways to ensure 
efficiency in the granting of public services." He calls for 
the privatization of certain services. 
  Blades points out that this situation is "a product of 
corruption and administrative inefficiency." He calls for a law 
to force, for example, the telephone company, to invest a 
certain amount of money to improve its services. Blades 
proposes a law to allow public utility companies to be run with 
the same flexibility that private companies are run. 
  Carles recalls that he has faced this problem for years. He 
adds that public enterprises "must be supervised and controlled; 
we must strive to prevent the continued growth of such 
institutions when many of their activities can be privatized." 
As examples, Carles lists cellular telephones, electricity, and 
water processing plants. 
  Journalist Noli poses the last question of this debate to 
Perez Balladares. She notes that the state payroll was reduced 
by nearly 5,000 persons but salaries increased by $5.39 million 
in 1993. Noli asks the candidate how he will effectively reduce 
state bureaucracy without further worsening the unemployment 
situation. 
  Perez Balladares points out that "we must clearly say that 
the private sector is the one that can create jobs in the 
future, not the state." He adds that public servants earning 
low salaries were fired and new servants with higher salaries 
were hired. This is, he says, not only unjust but absurd. 
Perez Balladares points out that the public sector is generally 
efficient. He notes that "I think that all candidates have been 
excessively harsh in criticizing the public sector. I am very 
proud of our public sector." Perez Balladares says public 
employees could be better paid to ensure they do a better job. 
He promises to promote approval of the civil service law 
because public servants deserve respect.

  [Text] Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff yesterday asked 
the Congress of the Republic to investigate him, if it suspects 
he has cooperated with drug trafficking, as charged by some 
persons. Among the accusers are U.S. Senator John Kerry and 
U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno. 
  The high-ranking judicial official also requested the 
Executive Branch to create the necessary conditions for harmonic 
cooperation in the struggle against drug trafficking. This is 
the reason he held a meeting yesterday with Attorney General 
Carlos Gustavo Arrieta. 
  De Greiff, during a news conference upon his return from 
abroad, said that Colombia is possibly giving in to pressure 
from U.S. officials and one senator. In this regard, the 
prosecutor gave as an example the letter that Gabriel Silva, 
Colombia's ambassador to the United States, sent to Senator John 
Kerry in which he explains the Executive Branch's position on 
the surrender policy to justice. In addition, he indicates that 
the government "opposes the surrender of drug traffickers under 
conditions inconsistent with their level of criminal guilt." 
Meanwhile it suggests that De Greiff seeks the opposite by 
indicating that the prosecutor's opinions are not those of the 
Executive Branch. 
  Regarding this matter De Greiff said: "When, how, and where 
has the Prosecutor General's Office or specifically the 
prosecutor general sought something different? Quietly but 
firmly I ask those who have been involved in episodes to present 
any evidence they may have on this. Furthermore, I ask the 
competent institutions, in this case the Congress, to 
investigate if it is true or not that the prosecutor general has 
cooperated with drug trafficking, as is published in the same 
daily that invented the wanted pardon or amnesty (for the drug 
traffickers who surrender to justice)." 
  In addition, the prosecutor general said that to strive for 
the cooperation from another nation to be received with the 
commitment to previously consult with the cooperating nation, on 
the use it will give to the evidence supplied or on the legal 
measures that these could justify, would be an attack on 
sovereignty. "I have been and I am in favor of the nations' 
legal cooperation with Colombia in my country's solitary or 
practically solitary struggle against the drug trafficking 
scourge. However, this has to take place within the bases of 
respect for sovereignty, and fundamentally within the parameters 
of independence in the Judicial Branch and in keeping with the 
constitutional and legal provisions on the matter," De Greiff 
said. 
  The prosecutor, referring to a letter he sent to a U.S. 
judge, in which it is indicated that in Colombia there is no 
evidence that Dandenys Munoz Mosquera, alias "La Quica," was 
involved in the Avianca airplane explosion, he said that this 
was distorted by some media. De Greiff said that all he pursued 
with that letter was for that nation's judicial official to be 
informed of some facts relevant to a decision he should have or 
would have to make, but in no case did he attempt to mediate for 
any specific individual. 
  To defend his action, the prosecutor general based his 
procedure on a court decision issued by the Constitutional Court 
that states: "the omission of a judicial action on which is 
based the exercise of a fundamental right escapes all 
justification and de-naturalizes the legal aspect, turning it 
into a mere exercise of power in the abnormal exercise of 
jurisdictional duty." 
  Meanwhile, De Greiff announced a new tone in his relations 
with the media given that "some media with criteria I do not 
want to label -- that everyone should label according to his 
conscious and his heart, as Dr. Eduardo Santos used to say -- 
have interpreted in their own fashion the measures that in given 
cases the prosecutor general has taken, and what is even worse, 
they have distorted them..." For this reason, the high-ranking 
judicial official announced that from now on he would 
communicate with the media in writing in the briefest form 
possible and through press communiques. 
  The prosecutor general also made reference to the situation 
of the bishops who allegedly have cooperated with the 
guerrillas. In this regard he said "it is not true that the 
Prosecutor General's Office has voiced its opinion on its 
agreement or disagreement on the testimonies of cooperation with 
subversive groups."

<F P=106> ["Text" of letter by Colombian Prosecutor General Gustavo de </F>
Greiff to U.S. Senator John Kerry; date not given] 
  [Text] Senator [John] Kerry's article, which he wrote 
instead of conducting a rational debate, which from my point of 
view is our only hope if we are to find a solution to a social 
problem of such great magnitude, is a long chain of personal 
attacks [ad hominem] that are not in accordance with your 
position nor are they appropriate comments on a high-level 
official of a sovereign state. But for the time being I will 
ignore them so as not to lose focus on what is truly important. 
  However, some clarifications are important because the 
senator is short on the truth. The senator is mistaken on the 
following issues: 
  1. It is not true that I held secret negotiations with 
members of the so-called "Cali Cartel." I believe that only 
distance and access to only selected articles could have led the 
senator to this conclusion. A law promoted by the Gaviria 
administration gives those who are suspected of involvement in 
criminal activities the opportunity to surrender to the district 
attorney and to request an investigation in the hopes of 
clarifying their legal situation. The cases I believe the 
senator is thinking of are those involving Helmer Herrera, Juan 
Ramirez, and Jose Olmedo Ocampo, who came to my office on 11, 
13, and 14 January, respectively, to request the aforementioned 
investigation. As stated in the law, my office issued a 
communique reporting on the facts. 
  The points that must be stressed are the following: a) All 
the procedures were conducted according to Colombian law. b) 
There was nothing secret about the contacts that were required 
by law and that led to the issuance of a public document. 
Furthermore, and as established by the law, my office notified 
the other Colombian judicial agencies and, at the same time, 
asked the foreign governments (including Italy, France, Germany, 
and the United States) to provide any legal evidence they might 
have against these people. c) The documents these men received 
following their visit to my office grant them no legal immunity 
nor any advantage. The documents simply establish the facts and 
purpose of their visit. Therefore, these harmless documents have 
no bearing on the investigation. This whole incident is much 
ado about nothing. Our capacity to prosecute these individuals 
has not been jeopardized; furthermore, it could not have been 
jeopardized for several reasons established in Colombian laws 
and statutes. 
  2. The senator's knowledge of Colombia is not precise. At 
all the forums to which I have access (including THE WASHINGTON 
POST article the senator is responding to), I have unceasingly 
talked about the horrible impact the drug traffickers, 
regardless of where they may come from, have on Colombia. As a 
matter of fact, the generous popular support I still enjoy in 
Colombia is due to my determination to not only speak, but also 
act against drug traffickers in general. However, for the 
record, the senator is mistaken about which crimes are credited 
to which cartel. I cannot blame the senator for this since the 
cartels have been disastrous to this country, and keeping 
straight who did what is not an easy task. But even keeping this 
in mind, the story the senator writes in his article is nothing 
more than a story; the exact same accusations -- participation 
in the assassination of Luis Carlos Galan (true), massive public 
relations campaigning against the extradition law (true), active 
campaigning during the constitutional reforms (true) -- were 
made against the Medellin Cartel throughout the long process of 
the abolition of the extradition treaty and later during the 
approval of the laws on sentence negotiations promoted by the 
Gaviria administration. 
  The same "story" is being told again today with different 
actors. One begins to ask oneself what interests are hidden 
behind this story; could it be that there are people in the U.S. 
Senate who would like to see the continuation of exactly the 
same struggle, at a safe distance from the United States, rather 
than considering alternatives that would distribute the burden 
of a war against drugs more equally? Senator, on this point 
there can be no doubt; the question from my viewpoint is not how 
we should surrender in light of the drug problem, but rather, 
how we should deal with it more effectively. Much of the 
progress Colombia has recently made in this field can be 
attributed to the institutional reorganization resulting from 
the 1991 Constitution, a reorganization created by the office I 
currently hold, which has been an instrument in the efforts to 
ensure that the law in my country is respected. But it is still 
necessary to do more, because, despite the new institutions, I 
cannot see clearly that we are winning this war. 
  3. Senator Kerry is mistaken when he says that Julio Fabio 
Urdinola -- a drug trafficker who surrendered to the Colombian 
authorities on 11 March -- "when negotiating his agreement, made 
use of an idea inspired by Cali, according to which, there is no 
Cali Cartel, rather, individual drug traffickers acting 
independently." This argument was not used by Urdinola (but how 
could the senator know whether it was or was not used?) simply 
because it is irrelevant. The crime for which we are accusing 
Urdinola is cocaine trafficking; therefore, the existence or 
nonexistence of the Cali Cartel is irrelevant. Senator Kerry 
may not like the idea of facing the fact that the Cali 
traffickers are not members of a cartel. But, of course, no 
action or rhetoric on his part can change the facts. By the 
way, in light of the little evidence that the U.S. and Colombian 
Governments have against the members of the alleged Cali Cartel, 
I do not understand the senator's apprehension about our using 
sentence negotiation against the Cali traffickers. I believe 
that, as long as we are thorough and demanding in the terms of 
such agreements, we will have more opportunities to obtain 
information on other traffickers than we would if we acted as we 
did in the past. 
  4. Senator Kerry is mistaken in stating that Urdinola "now 
faces only five years in prison." I believe I know about this 
because my office is responsible for those procedures. The 
length of Urdinola's sentence has not yet been discussed by the 
Prosecutor General's office. At this time I will take advantage 
of the opportunity to reiterate that debates on drug policy 
should not be based only on rational arguments but also on truth. 
  Now that this has been clarified, please allow me to stress 
some points made in the article the senator is responding to, as 
well as other statements I have made on this subject: 
  1. In my opinion, the antidrug policy must be guided by two 
goals: the reduction of trafficking and use and the dismantling 
of organized crime (yes, Mr. Kerry, this includes the "Cali 
Cartel," as well as organized crime in New York, Los Angeles, 
Houston, Chicago, Boston, etc.). The drug policy must also be 
guided by an important down-to-earth preference in favor of 
multilateral decisions, decisions made on the basis of respect 
and mutual understanding, not on disinformation and a 
presumptuous double standard. 
  2. Senator Kerry's answer to my article, to the extent that 
his answers contain an argument, takes it for granted that I am 
willing to consider legalization in terms of a free market. 
Nevertheless, I want to think about legalization models to break 
the economic backbone of the drug traffickers (yes, Mr. Kerry, 
the economic backbone of the Cali traffickers also), without 
increasing the supply. Again and again, I have said that my 
interest in considering legalization depends on the possibility 
of devising a suitable model to reach the goals mentioned 
earlier. 
  3. Senator Kerry has chosen to ignore the terms under which 
I 
defend the use of sentence negotiations. I have clearly said 
that this negotiation can be a useful instrument to the extent 
that we can obtain something that neither the United States nor 
Colombia has obtained so far, despite all their efforts: the 
cessation of all drug-related activities, full information on 
the participants in all involved countries, operational modes, 
location of laboratories, points of entry, financial 
transactions, etc. In addition, I have said that such 
agreements should not prevent the prosecution of both those who 
fail to abide by the agreements and those who refuse to provide 
full information. 
  4. Senator Kerry's insistence on the Cali Cartel's existence 
suggests that he knows something we do not know. This leads me 
to reiterate my request for a more effective information 
exchange. There is only one way to settle the question of the 
Cali Cartel's existence: by presenting evidence that supports 
the statement. Both in word and deed, I have always been willing 
to file charges against drug traffickers. It goes without 
saying, of course, that I need evidence to do this. If the 
senator possesses this evidence, we are prepared to use it. 
  Finally, I reiterate that a rational debate on the subject 
is 
essential. This involves listening to arguments and refraining 
from questioning the moral character of the participants in the 
debate solely because they hold a different viewpoint (something 
easy to do from Washington's comfortable distance). [Signed] 
Gustavo de Greiff R., attorney general.

  [Text] Attorney General Carlos Gustavo Arrieta has 
described certain decisions by Prosecutor General Gustavo de 
Greiff as being "isolated," and he said such decisions generate 
reactions that make people question their institutions and their 
coworkers. 
  "I am respectfully calling on the prosecutor general to stop 
making isolated decisions that can adversely affect the 
country's criminal policy," Arrieta said. 
  The attorney general also referred to Justice Minister 
Andres 
Gonzalez's position: "I have observed with irony and sadness 
how, by way of a letter a few days ago, the justice minister has 
established conditions for subjecting drug traffickers to 
justice, even though more than a year ago the Attorney General's 
Office had requested the inclusion of these same conditions in 
the Criminal Code." 
  Arrieta spoke to journalists yesterday to explain his views 
regarding the controversy that has emerged in the relations 
between U.S. officials and the Colombian Prosecutor General's 
Office, and he called on De Greiff to act in harmony and to 
cooperate with other institutions. 
  He added: "Serious harm will be done to Colombia and all of 
its citizens when, by way of isolated decisions, certain 
reactions are generated that make people question their 
institutions and their peers, because for every criminal there 
are thousands of decent citizens who are demanding respect for 
their dignity and rights." 
  According to the attorney general, the prosecutor general's 
isolated statements and decisions should not be allowed to 
endanger the state's criminal policy, because "no institution 
can claim for itself the exclusive handling of the state's 
criminal policy." He added: "There is a constitutional mandate 
that calls for harmony and cooperation among all branches of 
government. It is necessary to understand that the legal 
strategies of prohibition and prevention should parallel one 
another and be harmonious within the state." 
  The attorney general added: "I do not want this statement to 
be interpreted as if I am supporting someone. I simply want to 
make a constructive contribution toward resolving a national 
problem that has resulted in serious consequences, such as the 
labeling of Colombia as a narcodemocracy." 
  Arrieta admitted that the current Criminal Code is a failure 
because of all of its legal flaws and contradictions. He said 
the drug traffickers' lawyers have taken advantage of these 
shortcomings. 
  Arrieta said: "The lack of standards has prompted attorneys 
for drug traffickers to try to obtain more favorable conditions 
for their clients." The problems with the code, according to 
the high-ranking official, can be summarized this way: "There 
are confusing standards in terms of protocol, advantages and 
benefits of the law, and the application of differing views, and 
these eventually lead to lenient decisions." 
  Arrieta also said there are documents that prove that since 
February 1992 the Attorney General's Office has been insisting 
on the need for a tougher Criminal Code. 
<H5>  Another Criminal Code </H5>
  Arrieta said: "It is no secret that the Attorney General's 
Office was the only office that originally opposed the reform of 
the Criminal Code, because it believed the discretionary powers 
given to prosecutors in doling out benefits were too broad." 
The attorney general said there are 60-70 criminal policy 
standards, but he added that all of these are confusing and 
contradictory. "This is why, according to the Attorney 
General's Office, as far as the struggle against drug 
trafficking is concerned, it is important for the government, 
the Congress, and the judicial branch to assume the challenge of 
issuing as soon as possible significant procedural standards 
that reflect a clear-cut criminal policy." 
  The attorney general said the new criminal code must include 
guidelines for meting out sentences that correspond to the 
seriousness of the crime. He said: "They should offer viable 
judicial alternatives that will generate neither impunity nor a 
sense of impunity." 
  While waiting for these kinds of reforms, Arrieta promised 
"to proceed forcefully and seriously in such a way that those 
guilty of crimes receive punishment that correspond to their 
acts." He also said he will continue to work within the 
framework of the legal and constitutional responsibilities the 
Attorney General's Office has in criminal cases. 
  Arrieta added: "If, as a state, we are unable to promote a 
comprehensive Criminal Code that features sentences that are 
proportional to the crimes and establishes clear criteria for 
the application of benefits, then something is seriously wrong 
here."

<F P=106> [From the "National Newscast"] </F>
  [Text] It will be legally possible to confiscate assets 
owned by drug traffickers. A Constitutional Court ruling has 
given the green light to legislation that authorizes the 
expropriation of property owned by persons charged with 
illegally acquiring wealth. 
  By backing the Vienna Convention, the United Nation's 
highest 
treaty on drug trafficking, the Constitutional Court has 
endorsed one of the leading mechanisms to fight this scourge in 
Colombia. Authorities are convinced that with this endorsement 
of the treaty it will be easier to confront drug traffickers. 
  [Begin Justice Minister Andres Gonzalez recording] It is an 
international instrument that is essential in the fight against 
drug trafficking in all of its phases, such as money laundering, 
taking drugs, and diverting chemicals used in processing 
cocaine. [end recording] 
  The Court has ruled that, from now on and through a judicial 
procedure, seizing goods that originated in drug trafficking or 
goods that represent illegal acquisition of wealth can be 
authorized. 
  [Begin Gonzalez recording] The Vienna Convention is 
important 
because other countries can imitate us. It will be possible to 
establish regulations and agreements to complement the Vienna 
Convention in order to freeze drug trafficking-originated goods. 
It is also an essential instrument in breaking organized 
crime's financial backbone. [end recording] 
  The nonextradition of Colombian citizens was also agreed 
upon 
during the revision of the Vienna Convention.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic developments through 12 April. 
  The Foreign Trade Institute (Incomex) has reported imports 
totaled $1.4 billion during February, a 36.3-percent increase 
over imports for the same month last year. Incomex has revealed 
$2.5-billion worth of goods were imported the first two months 
of the year, a 26-percent increase over imports for the same 
period in 1993. Raw materials and unfinished products accounted 
for 41 percent of imported goods, followed by consumer goods and 
capital goods. The largest supplier of goods to Colombia was 
the United States, with $922 million, followed by Venezuela, 
with $386.6 million. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 
21 March 94 p 2C) 
  According to data compiled by EL TIEMPO, food prices pushed 
inflation upward in March with an average increase of 3 percent. 
Most increases are reported in such products as meat, coffee, 
and certain fruits; nevertheless, there was a reduction in the 
price of onions, string beans, and guavas. Meanwhile, the 
Agricultural- Livestock Market Institute (Idema) has ruled out a 
massive importation of foodstuffs, saying national production 
will be enough to meet the demand. Between 5,000 and 6,000 tons 
of potatoes from Ecuador are expected to enter the country this 
semester, however. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 2 
April 94 pp 1A, 1C, 3C) 
  Shortly after the government adopted measures restricting 
internal and external credits to curb inflation, the effects 
began to surface. Such measures resulted in dissolved 
businesses, postponed purchases, noncompliance with payments, 
etc. Banking authorities on 15 March established a 2.2-percent 
monthly ceiling on the volume of loans granted by banks. This 
measure will be effective for four months, and it is expected 
the growth of loans in the financial sector will not exceed 30 
percent by the end of the year. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO 
in Spanish 3 April 94 p 1C) 
  In an interview with EL TIEMPO, Maria Mercedes Cuellar de 
Martinez, deputy chairperson of the Bank of the Republic, has 
said the economy could face serious hardships in the next few 
months if the government does not curb public spending. 
Martinez has said the measures restricting credits will have 
positive results only if the government does its part. The top 
bank official has said the country could not afford to maintain 
an overvalued peso, concluding a 12- to 13-percent devaluation 
would be "ideal." (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 3 
April 94 p 2C) 
  The National Administrative Department of Statistics (Dane) 
has revealed the March inflation rate totaled 2.21 percent, 
bringing annual cumulative inflation to 9.32 percent. In order 
for the government to meet its 19-percent annual inflation 
target, monthly inflation could not exceed 1 percent by the end 
of the year. The rise in basic basket product prices is mainly 
explained by increases in health, food, and housing services. 
Food prices alone increased by 2.55 percent last year, putting 
upward pressure on prices. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in 
Spanish 3 April 94 p 3A) 
  Dane has reported industrial production rose by 6.04 percent 
last year, excluding coffee production, while in 1992 it 
increased by 4.46 percent in 1992. Dane has noted coffee 
production fell sharply due to reduced exports. Growth in 
industrial production was set at 4.05 percent in 1993. The Dane 
report has also indicated jobs in the industrial sector grew by 
1.36 percent last year. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in 
Spanish 8 April 94 p 1B) 
  Guido Nule Amin, mines and energy minister, has said 
investments in the energy sector are expected to total $24 
billion over the next eight years. Of this amount, Nule 
continued, "the government will only contribute $11 billion, 
because we hope the private sector will come up with the rest." 
Among the projects in the oil industry are the development of 
the Cusiana oil field, construction of oil pipelines, and new 
exploration projects. Nule has reiterated the government will 
promote the private sector's participation in petroleum-refining 
projec?s to liberalize gasoline production. (Santa Fe de Bogota 
EL TIEMPO in Spanish 8 April 94 p 4B)

    [Editorial Report] 
<H5>  Samper Resumes Campaigning Following Convention </H5>
  In a tour of Antioquia and Bolivar Departments, his first 
since the 18 March Liberal Party convention, the party's new 
leader and presidential candidate, Ernesto Samper, said he wants 
to "transform the party into a great force for change" and 
invited Colombians to join him in creating a social coalition 
called "Alliance for Colombia." (EL ESPECTADOR, 27 Mar) 
  During a Liberal Party gathering in Rionegro, Antioquia, on 
25 March Samper announced that the party's renewal would be 
based on five pillars: modernization, democratization, 
participation, institutionalization, and moralization. Samper 
said he was pleased with the enthusiastic response to his 
"Alliance for Colombia" proposal and said that some members of 
the rival Conservative Party see in it the possibility of 
transforming their own party into one which is "less dynastic, 
more democratic, and more concerned about social aspects of 
Colombia's future," according to EL ESPECTADOR (26 Mar). 
  Samper and the party's new secretary general, Pedro Gomez 
Barrero, announced the names of those who will serve on various 
party committees. These include an ethics tribunal which will 
work in coordination with campaign ethics director Jorge 
Valencia; the committee for the renewal of Liberalism which will 
be headed by Samper's running mate Humberto de la Calle, with 
Pedro Gomez and national campaign director Fernando Botero 
acting as coordinators, and additional members to include six 
women, seven youth representatives, and some legislators. Carlos 
Lleras de la Fuente, David Turbay, Carlos Lemos, and Rodolfo 
Gonzalez--all of whom competed with Samper for the Liberal Party 
candidacy--will serve on an advisory committee. In addition, 
Samper appointed Carlos Lemos, Carlos Lleras de la Fuente, and 
former acting mayor of Bogota Sonia Duran to help direct his 
campaign in Bogota. (EL ESPECTADOR, 24, 26 Mar) 
  The candidate has also begun a new publicity campaign which, 
according to Samper's "image adviser" Rodrigo Pardo, emphasizes 
the candidate's desire for a "new social policy, since people 
have been the candidate's primary concern." (EL ESPECTADOR, 24 
Mar) New posters are now being circulated which show Samper, his 
wife Jacquin, and their two sons, standing at the center of a 
long line of people--representing every social class and age 
group, as well as different races--in front of a banner 
displaying Samper's name in huge letters and the slogan "It's 
the people's time." (EL ESPECTADOR, 24 Mar) Speaking with 
reporters after launching this new publicity campaign, Samper 
said the strategy now is to spread that message, according to EL 
TIEMPO (24 Mar). Another version of the poster, symbolizing 
Samper's support for women's rights, shows Samper's wife with an 
all female group. 
<H5>  Pastrana Warns About Political Influence of "External Forces" </H5>
  In a letter to Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff, 
Conservative Party presidential candidate Andres Pastrana 
expressed his "tremendous concern" about the "recent invasion 
into politics, in a brazen manner, of external forces and 
dealings" which he likened to "the first stages of drug 
trafficking in symbiosis with sectors of politics," according to 
the 25 March EL TIEMPO. 
  In a likely reference to his rival Samper, Pastrana began 
his 
letter by stating that at the start of the presidential 
campaign, he had "found a candidate and his political director 
to be running contrary to the idea of making morality and 
scrupulosity a campaign issue, openly discussed before the 
people of the country." 
  He went on to warn that, the "invasion" of "contraband 
mafias" not only "corrodes the moral fiber of politics," but 
makes a "mockery" of tax-paying citizens. He declared that 
"contraband" is the "antithesis and number one enemy" of 
countries seeking to strengthen ties to the rest of the world 
and develop competitive industries, adding that Colombia "cannot 
be complacent in the face of this contraband." Pastrana ended 
the letter with an appeal to De Greiff to investigate the matter. 
<H5>  Reaction to Vice-Presidential Selections </H5>
  In a 20 March editorial, Liberal Party oriented EL TIEMPO 
expressed enthusiasm about Ernesto Samper's selection of 
Humberto De la Calle as his running mate, saying that De la 
Calle's performance as Minister of Government under Gaviria had 
earned him the right to be considered "a big player in the 
Liberal Party's future." 
  The paper also solicited reaction to each candidate's 
vice-presidential selection from the opposing candidate's 
campaign director and from senators of both parties. 
  Samper campaign director Fernando Botero described 
Pastrana's 
selection of Luis Fernando Ramirez--a member of Pastrana's own 
New Democratic Force faction of the Conservative Party--as the 
"last nail in the coffin" for Pastrana's effort to present his 
candidacy as one that "transcends political parties," according 
to EL TIEMPO (23 Mar). 
  Pastrana campaign director Luis Alberto Moreno said the big 
difference between the Liberal and Conservative tickets is the 
importance each places on honoring its word. Moreno noted that 
Humberto De la Calle went from being Samper's most ardent critic 
to serving as his running mate, and cited numerous quotes from 
De la Calle's campaign speeches which criticize Samper's 
proposals and accuse him of changing his views to suit public 
opinion. 
  In addition, noted Moreno, De la Calle declared on numerous 
occasions that he would not accept the vice-presidential slot 
"for any reason." In the end, however, De la Calle "went back on 
his word and surrendered his principles," according to Moreno. 
  In contrast to Samper and De la Calle, Moreno observed, 
Pastrana and Ramirez are "men of their word." He noted that, 
while mayor of Bogota, Pastrana kept his promises and later, as 
a senator, supported President Gaviria during difficult periods 
in his administation. Ramirez, Gaviria's former Labor Minister, 
was committed to pushing forward with social security reform 
despite the fact that Congress "was asking for his head," 
according to Moreno. 
  Liberal Party Senator Victor Renan Barco praised De la 
Calle's intellect and experience, describing him as "right on 
target" as a vice-presidential choice. In contrast, he described 
Ramirez as a "technocrat," noting that while he views Ramirez as 
someone who would appeal to those in central banking and 
national planning circles, he doubts that his appeal will be 
universal among Conservative voters. 
  Conservative Senator Fabio Valencia Cossio said the 
Pastrana-Ramirez ticket seeks to present an image of change, 
adding that Ramirez has proven himself as a public servant and 
is identified with some existing programs. Valencia said 
Samper's choice of De la Calle was based strictly on party 
affiliation and gives the impression that it was done to avoid 
division in the party (EL TIEMPO, 23 Mar).

  [Text] Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina arrived this 
morning at our main airport. During a news conference, he said 
he has not brought any concrete proposals or deals for the 
Paraguayan Government or Foreign Ministry. Basically he wants 
to learn details of the Mercosur [Common Market of the South], 
and to talk about his country's economic reality. 
  Robaina arrived in the company of four ambassadors and 
several journalists. He was met by Lincoln Alfieri, the Foreign 
Ministry vice director of protocol; Senator Carlos Alberto 
Gonzalez, president of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee; 
Senator Victor Sanchez Villagra, president of the Revolutionary 
Febrerista Party (PRF); and Ananias Maidana, secretary general 
of the Paraguayan Communist Party. 
  Robaina indicated that he has not brought a list of deals, 
that he is visiting "to allow the Paraguayan Foreign Ministry to 
explain to me the interest that has made me tour the Mercosur 
countries." [sentence as published] 
  He then commented on what he believes our Foreign Ministry 
might find of interest -- in other words, to what extent Cuba is 
implementing a foreign policy in which Latin America is a 
priority, as attested by the fact that very shortly the 
countries of the continent will hold an Iberoamerican summit 
where opinions will be heard and where Cuba will be discussed. 
  The Cuban foreign minister stated that Cuba has a new image 
and that its government wants this image to be made known to the 
countries of the region within the framework of the diplomatic 
offensive that is embodied in this visit to several countries, 
including Argentina, Uruguay, and Peru. 
  He indicated that today Cuba is a ready and attractive 
market 
for foreign investment, and is an open market. He indicated 
that Cuba can offer highly technical development, pharmaceutical 
and medical industries, and proposals for sports, scientific, 
educational, and cultural sectors. 
  Robaina maintains that he wants to polish Cuba's image and 
project its new economic reality. 
  The foreign minister said that although there are no 
diplomatic links with Paraguay, there have always been contacts 
and dialogue in various American forums. 
  The Cuban minister will carry out a series of activities 
that 
include meetings with the top political leaders of the 
traditional parties and with businessmen.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Relations With Cuba"] </F>
  [Text] Mr. Roberto Robaina, the Cuban foreign relations 
minister, will arrive today on an unofficial visit. In the name 
of pluralism (a concept that in Cuba does not really apply), 
some criticism has been heard over the small amount of attention 
the executive branch reportedly intends to give him, as well as 
some favorable comments on restoring diplomatic relations 
between the two governments. 
  It can be assumed Mr. Robaina is coming to our country with 
a 
clear goal. Therefore, it is right -- as scheduled -- for the 
Paraguayan Foreign Ministry to receive him and listen to him. 
As there are no diplomatic relations with the current Cuban 
regime, there are no protocol reasons for any other official 
attention. 
  There are no special reasons why Paraguay should restore 
relations with the Cuban regime. Relations presuppose a certain 
level of affinity or, at the least, some very specific and 
dynamic interests that make them necessary. It is abundantly 
clear that neither of these two factors stimulate Paraguay's 
restoration of diplomatic relations with Cuba. 
  The only possible interest worth mentioning would be limited 
to some direct trade. Diplomatic relations are not essential 
for such trade. It is enough to establish trade bureaus like 
those used by Taiwan to maintain their very dynamic and 
significant trade operations with a number of nations with which 
it does not have any formal diplomatic ties. 
  The meaning of a Cuban diplomatic mission in Paraguay 
remains 
unknown, but it may well be assumed that establishing a 
Paraguayan mission in Havana might be viewed by the Cuban people 
as a gesture of approval and -- eventually -- support for its 
regime, one of the last and strongest dictatorships still 
remaining in the continent. 
  Paraguay should be interested in friendship with the Cuban 
people, but not with a government and political system that has 
made hundreds of thousands of Cubans choose, whenever possible, 
to go into exile and to force many others to continue to 
challenge the regime's ironclad surveillance and the sea's 
perils to seek in a foreign land the liberty denied to them in 
their own. 
  As a nation with a long experience in the restriction and 
denial of liberties and political harassment and repression -- 
involving widespread fear, imprisonments, and exile -- we should 
not be interested in dealing with any tyrant, regardless of his 
leanings. 
  Out of respect for the liberty restored in our country -- as 
well as the respect that any nation deserves even though 
deprived of such liberty -- it would be inappropriate to take 
any step that might even be viewed as tolerance of an 
unmistakably dictatorial regime like the Cuban regime. So, let 
us use our inevitably limited efforts to strengthen friendly 
ties with free nations.

  [Text] General Nicolas Hermoza Rios, the Armed Forces Joint 
Commander and Army Commander, has said that more than 100 Army 
personnel have been sentenced so far for their involvement in 
drug trafficking. 
  Gen. Hermoza said Army personnel who commit crimes while on 
duty and who allegedly protect traffickers are immediately 
discharged and brought before a military court. 
  He said: "I believe the military court can best investigate 
these cases. If suspects were brought before a civilian court 
today, I am sure many guilty criminals would be released 
tomorrow." 
  Hermoza Rios said that only when an Army member is caught 
red-handed with irrefutable evidence and witnesses to link him 
to this kind of crime is he then taken to a civilian court. 
  Following an operation in the Satipo military base, Gen. 
Hermoza spoke on the program "Dialogue" broadcast by Channel 
Two. He said that in the past few weeks traffickers had 
suffered harsh blows. 
  "We are all witnesses to the accomplishments of the forces 
of 
order during operations in Madre de Dios, Inapari, Manu, and now 
in Satipo, in which important trafficking networks were 
dismantled," he said. 
  He said the operations carried out in these remote parts of 
the country follow a strategy ordered by President Alberto 
Fujimori to eradicate drug trafficking. 
  He added that terrorism is about to disappear in the 
Huallaga 
Valley. It is expected that the military front in the zone will 
eradicate the Shining Path at the same time it ends trafficking. 
  "These actions have forced the traffickers to move to other 
drug production and storage centers, like Madre de Dios and 
Satipo, where clandestine airstrips for the departure of 
airplanes that carry drugs have been found," he said. 
  Gen. Hermoza said he is not worried by the investigations 
and 
criticisms of some journalists about the struggle against 
traffickers. 
  He said there is a campaign to discredit "the Armed Forces" 
through unfounded attacks. 
  "These attacks are not isolated but are made within the 
framework of a campaign to discredit our Armed Forces and to 
destabilize the democratic process in Peru," he said. 
  Gen. Hermoza said the media will never be censored because 
freedom of press and expression are the main bastions of 
democracy. 
  Gen. Hermoza likewise ruled out disagreements between the 
Armed Forces and the National Police, saying that their drug 
enforcement task is being carried out in total harmony and 
coordination. 
  He said that at every military intervention against 
traffickers a prosecutor and a police representative are 
present, adding that the drugs confiscated during the operation 
are handed to them. 
  "There is close cooperation at all levels. It is good to see 
that unity and discipline are being maintained despite the 
difficult conditions in which we are carrying out this 
struggle," he added. 
  He added that the successful anti-trafficking policy in Peru 
is not based on support provided by the DEA but to an 
appropriate strategy developed by the government through the 
national Armed Forces. 
  "Nowhere in the world has a problem like trafficking and 
terrorism been combated with so much success as is currently 
being done in Peru," he said. 
  He recalled that in November last year the Armed Forces 
Joint 
Command correctly evaluated the government provisions to 
eradicate terrorism from the country and to consolidate national 
pacification according to the law. 
  He denied that these actions seek to improve the Armed 
Forces 
image in face of the serious charges against some of its members 
for being involved with drug trafficking. He said the Armed 
Forces began to participate in the struggle against trafficking 
and terrorism when the work exceeded the capability of the 
police force. 
  "These social scourges represented at a given moment an 
imminent risk and danger to national security and the survival 
of our nation, which is why urgent measures had to be adopted," 
he said. 
  Gen. Hermoza said the legal framework established by the 
current regime has allowed the Armed Forces and the National 
Police to carry out their task appropriately in the most 
troubled zones of the country.

  [Text] The creation of the National System for the Control 
and Repression of Drug Production and Drug Trafficking [Sistema 
Nacional de Control y Represion de la Produccion y el Trafico 
Ilicito de Drogas] is the most important contribution 
encompassed in the national antidrug plan drafted by a 
commission of experts at the government's request. 
  According to the draft, this new drug control system will 
group all the many dispersed antidrug government actions which 
need to be centralized and organized. 
  The new Peruvian Government antidrug policy organization 
will 
fulfill functions similar to the Office of National Drug Control 
Policy, which drafts, centralizes, and implements the U.S. 
Government's antidrug strategy under the leadership of Drug Czar 
Lee Brown. 
  The influence of the U.S. model does not stop there, because 
the National Drug Control and Drug Prevention Plan [Plan 
Nacional de Prevencion y Control de Drogas] -- which is already 
in President Alberto Fujimori's hands for study and approval -- 
is a Peruvian version of U.S. goals, objectives, plans, and 
programs in this area. 
  The Peruvian program encompasses drug production and drug 
trafficking; alternative development programs; and drug 
prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation. 
  The plans call for the national system to be divided into 
four subsystems, each of which will concentrate their efforts on 
drug control and drug repression activities in the battle 
against drugs; the deviation of chemical precursors and inputs; 
the transfer of funds and laundered money; drug production and 
drug trafficking; and the smuggling of arms and explosives. 
  These subsystems will be subordinated to the central 
organization, which will be in charge of the planning, 
coordinating, controlling, and information and decisionmaking 
process of the antidrug efforts to be undertaken by the Peruvian 
Government from 1994 to the year 2000. 
  In addition to creating this arm for the antidrug struggle, 
the plan has 20 other objectives, among which are the 
development of the alternative development program, the 
monitoring of coca crops, the safeguarding of the environment, 
and the development of research programs for the beneficial use 
of coca. 
  The main objectives are centered on the gradual reduction of 
coca crops, the repression of drug production and drug 
trafficking, and decreased drug use. 
  By the year 2000 the goal of this ambitious project is to 
incorporate through the alternative development programs at 
least 50 percent of the peasant population currently involved in 
coca production for illegal purposes in legal farming activities. 
  In addition to alternative development, the plan proposes a 
strategy based on the establishment of legal and institutional 
order. 
  According to the draft, during the 1994-2000 period the 
promotion of the alternative development program will be granted 
"top priority" with the objective of achieving the reduction of 
coca crops used for illegal purposes. 
  The national antidrug plan, the first of its kind in our 
country, was drafted by a multisectorial commission headed by 
General Arnaldo Velarde Ramirez, Peruvian representative to the 
OAS Inter-American Committee for the Control of Drugs and Drug 
Abuse (CICAD). 
  The commission was established in November, and is made up 
of 
representatives from government ministries, with support from 
the United Nations International Drug Control Program [Programa 
de las Naciones Unidas para la Fiscalizacion Internacional de 
Drogas] (PNUFID) and prominent experts on the matter.

<F P=106> [Article by Liz Mineo] </F>
  [Text] Since February 1978, when the government promulgated 
the first national antinarcotics law, the antinarcotics struggle 
in the country has been characterized by its isolated efforts 
and meager results. 
  At the end of the 1970's, cultivated coca production did not 
surpass 30,000 hectares. Last year it surpassed 150,000 
hectares, according to the Ofecod [Executive Office for Drug 
Control], which is under the jurisdiction of the Interior 
Ministry. Some less conservative statistics suggest the total 
is about 300,000 hectares. 
  U.S. sources have stated that from 1978 to 1993, drug 
trafficking activities which were previously concentrated in the 
Upper Huallaga Valley expanded at the national level. Some 
200,000 families now farm coca and manufacture cocaine paste. 
Drug-related activities generate an income of about $2 billion 
per year within the Peruvian economy. 
  Many experts believe the failure of the antidrug struggle 
follows the lack of an antidrug strategy and the absence of an 
organization to plan, coordinate, and implement it. 
  The national drug prevention and drug control plan seeks to 
resolve one of the most vulnerable points of the antidrug 
struggle in the country by establishing an organization to 
centralize all government efforts in this field. 
  The General Law on Drugs foresaw in 1978 the need to 
establish an organization to draft a drug control policy, to 
implement it and to coordinate all the actions to be developed. 
  Law No. 22095 established the Multi-Sectorial Drug Control 
Committee (Comucod) [Comite Multisectorial de Control de 
Drogas], an organization to approve the government's antidrug 
policy; and the Ofecod, an executive and coordinating 
organization. Under the law, Comucod was to comprise six 
cabinet members and an alternate from the Supreme Court. The 
truth is that Comucod did not fulfill the duties with which it 
was entrusted by law and never really worked. 
  Ofecod came under the jurisdiction of the Interior Ministry. 
It was to have controlled drugs, and implemented and 
coordinated government actions. As it turned out, Ofecod 
handled administrative functions of disposing of the goods 
seized by the police during antidrug operations and ignored the 
other duties with which it was entrusted by law. 
  Experts believe neither of these organizations completely 
fulfilled its duties. This, undoubtedly, directly influenced 
the expansion of coca farming and trafficking at the national 
level. 
  The lack of leadership, and the dilution and 
ineffectiveness of government actions in the antidrug struggle, 
became obvious in the early 1980's. 
  The main institutions involved in the drug control program 
at 
the time were: the National Coca Enterprise (Enaco); the Upper 
Huallaga Coca Control and Reduction Agency (Corah); and the 
Upper Huallaga Development Program (Peah). 
  Enaco was the government organization responsible for the 
monopoly, legal marketing, and industrialization of coca. In 
fact, it only captured an insignificant part of Peru's coca 
harvest which was mainly being grown for drug traffickers. 
  Corah, which was entrusted with coca eradication programs in 
the area, eliminated several hundred thousand hectares of coca 
in the Upper Huallaga region but paradoxically the valley became 
the main coca producing region in the world. 
  Peah, which was responsible for promoting alternative 
farming 
programs in coca producing regions, yielded insufficient results 
and enjoyed little support among coca farmers. 
  Some experts said the failure of these government 
organizations to control coca farming and trafficking lies in 
the fact that trafficking is merely considered a criminal 
activity that must be disciplined with police repression and 
severe legal punishments. 
  For a long time the antinarcotics struggle was only based on 
repressive actions. The police were the main organization 
entrusted with conducting these repressive actions through its 
diverse specialized units -- among them the Mobile Rural Patrol 
Unit (Umopar), which was involved in the compulsory eradication 
of thousands of hectares of coca; the former Drug Police 
Division (Dipog); the Illicit Drug Traffic Investigative 
Division (Dintid); the Antidrug Division (Dirandro), which later 
became the Antidrug Division (Dinandro). 
  Even today repressive actions are still prevalent. The 
number of actions has risen since July 1992 when the government 
established the Internal Operations Front Command (COFI), which 
falls under the jurisdiction of the Armed Forces. This is the 
top organization, responsible for the planning, implementation, 
and control of the struggle against drugs and terrorism. 
  In the last few years, in addition to repression, the 
authorities have introduced the strategy of alternative 
development. This program seeks to replace economies based on 
coca farming with the alternative farming of legal crops and an 
improvement in the standard of life in coca-producing regions. 
  The Peruvian Government has acknowledged the prevalence of 
the economic and social problems that encourage trafficking. It 
paid particular attention to alternative farming but its results 
in practice have been almost nil. Neither the Institute for 
Alternative Development (Idea), nor the Autonomous Authority for 
Alternative Development (Aada) were ever implemented. 
Considering the antidrug draft bill grants "the highest 
priority" to the alternative development program, there are 
great expectations that this time around, this program will 
finally be implemented.

  [Excerpts] An attempt is being made to have the U.S. Trade 
Representative (USTR) influence the Peruvian Government into 
changing the labor reform it is implementing and adopting new 
labor policies. The statement is included in a document 
prepared by the Coordinating Board of Peruvian Labor 
Federations, which is led by Teodulo Hernandez. 
  The document, signed by Peruvian union organizations, states 
that the American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial 
Organizations (AFL-CIO) believes that the Peruvian Government 
"is seeking to compete with U.S. manufacturers by using a system 
based on an overworked, cheap work force." 
  "This," the document adds, "is not a model compatible with 
the needs of a reasonable, productive trade integration." 
  The document admits that these conditions could be brought 
to 
bear upon the Peruvian Government by recommending the suspension 
of duty-free imports of Peruvian products by the United States. 
[passage omitted] 
  The U.S. Government could fall into the trap of pressing for 
the elimination of our labor reform by threatening to take 
retaliatory measures. 
  The document notes that the USTR is expected to make a 
decision in June in which he could affect approximately $300 
million worth of Peruvian exports. 
  The document states that this could happen "unless the 
Peruvian Government makes substantive corrections in its policy 
toward trade unions." 
  The document says that U.S. officials have received reports 
that "Peruvian union representatives" may have been "publicly 
threatened by representatives of the Fujimori government" with 
being "brought to trial before military courts and sentenced to 
life on charges of treason to the fatherland." [passage 
omitted] 
  The Peruvian trade unions state that their demands are 
designed to bring about changes to "restrictions imposed upon 
the free action of unions in our country, or otherwise face the 
exclusion of Peruvian exports from the Generalized System of 
Preferences (GSP)." [passage omitted]

reported that Armed Forces and National Police salaries will, 
like education and health sector salaries, be increased by 100 
soles. 
  Most of these disbursements will be covered by financial 
reserves that total more than 2.3 billion new soles. Some 840 
million new soles of the national financial reserves have been 
allocated to fund the salary policy. 
  Some 215 million new soles were allocated for school 
expenses, Christmas bonuses, and other labor obligations. He 
reported that more than 1 billion soles have been set aside for 
salaries. 
  With regard to the date when the salary increase will be 
granted to Armed Forces and police personnel, Blanco said the 
executive branch must decide. 
  He said the Budget Law originally contemplated the increase 
on two different dates: The first 70 new soles in February and 
the remaining 30 new soles in August. 
  Regarding the first three-month balance of the National 
General Budget, Blanco said the committee must wait for an 
Economy Ministry report before commenting.

  [Excerpt] The Senate has rejected the constitutional reform 
bill. The group of senators who proposed the bill are 
frustrated over the failure to approve the bill after several 
months of negotiations. There were various short recesses to 
try to iron out the differences but the bill was finally 
rejected. Against the motion were senators of the Battleist 
Forum, the Cruzade 94, and the Broad Front, which added 10 votes 
to the total [sentence as heard]. The bill was supported by 
senators of the National Party, Colorado and Battleist Union, 
List 15, and the Government of the People. 
  The element that brought about the failure of the bill was 
the proposal presented by the group headed by Julio Maria 
Sanguinetti, who wanted to submit the reform to a plebiscite on 
the last Sunday of November, that is, the same day as the 
national elections. This proposal also included the elimination 
of cross-party voting and the approval of a norm allowing a 
system of coalitions between parties with multiple candidacies. 
The proposal was rejected by the National Party. As a result, 
the reform was rejected. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina by </F>
Maria Urruzola; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Urruzola] The day you arrived in Montevideo, you 
made some remarks with respect to the "model of economic 
transformation within which we are working." However, Carlos 
Lage [Cuban Council of Ministers Executive Committee secretary] 
told GRANMA last November that they were not looking for a new 
model, as the whole point was to maintain the socialist model. 
Don't you see a contradiction between these remarks made by two 
key members of the present political leadership? 
  [Robaina] The way we expressed ourselves might seem 
contradictory, but deep down we are talking about the same 
thing. I prefer to explain things publicly rather than look for 
a label for the model. I do not want to maintain a label that 
is no longer entirely correct, nor import a label that is not 
ours. That is why I decided to summarize the model within which 
we are working -- for anyone who might insist on finding a label 
for it -- by saying that it is a viable Cuban economic model 
where many things can be modified, where there is room for other 
things, and where the essence of many things is maintained. 
Those are the things Lage defends, with all clarity. About the 
modifications, I expressed myself in one way, and Lage in 
another. But it is clear that we are not talking about a model 
that is identical to the one we had before, because substantial 
differences already exist. 
  [Urruzola] You are part of the generation of Cubans who were 
educated under the principle that "Cuba belongs to the Cubans," 
even if they make mistakes. That is changing today. You 
accepted opening a space for foreign capital in the country's 
economy. At some time you will have to deal with that capital's 
interference in the decisionmaking process. When I was in Cuba 
I perceived that the people had certain difficulties in 
accepting that. 
  [Robaina] Only "certain difficulties?" Cubans have a lot of 
difficulties understanding that. But the success of what we 
defend depends not so much on the resemblance of what we are 
doing with what we supported in other circumstances, than on our 
capacity to adapt ourselves to the moment in which we are 
living. In the same way I was educated in that concept you 
mentioned, I was also educated to adapt to new times. In this 
process of adaptation the point is to know to what extent Cuba 
continues belonging to Cubans under the new rules of the game. 
We cannot continue to stagnate. But I would be lying if I said 
that the process is clearly or easily understood. It is a very 
complex and tough process, even for the new generations, as they 
were educated based on a series of tenets that are today in one 
way or another being adjusted. We need to do a lot of 
persuading and convincing. 
  [Urruzola] What do you mean when you talk about "what we 
defend" or "the essence?" 
  [Robaina] For us the essence is sovereignty, independence, 
to 
be able to speak with one's own voice, and not wait for someone 
to signal to us what we must do when there is something in the 
world we must speak about. We do not want the infant mortality 
rate to rise, or life expectancy to drop. We do not want to 
need money, support, or relatives' help to act professionally. 
We do not want to stop doing our best in the Olympic Games. We 
want to continue to develop our scientific world. For us the 
essence is not disturbed if we accept mixed associations in our 
economic model, or liberalize work, or let one work on one's 
own, or hand the land to peasants for their use for an 
indefinite period, or reorganize the state administrative 
apparatus. 
  [Urruzola] Nevertheless, with the new economic situation in 
Cuba, scientists, university students and professors, and 
intellectuals have been particularly harmed. Given their 
relationship with government organizations, they are still 
earning 300 pesos, which is equivalent to $3. At the workers 
congress of the National Research Center I heard scientific 
researchers saying: "They are forcing us to do things that we do 
not want to do." Is it not a serious risk that precisely that 
sector which must find a solution to the country's problems is 
in such a situation? 
  [Robaina] My country is a country of many risks. We 
nevertheless prefer to run these risks instead of running a more 
serious risk: that of not facing life, and believing that 
problems will be resolved in some other way. Cubans do not sit 
back and do nothing. Cuba believes that, under circumstances 
such as these, it is actually through the discussion of all the 
issues by workers' congresses that the wise voice of the people, 
which will convey to our country's leadership the need to 
introduce new transformations, will be raised. These 
transformations, for example, include putting domestic finances 
on a sound footing so that sectors like that of the scientists 
will not in some way be harmed after all the contributions they 
have made to our country. This does not merely involve 
deregulating the dollar, but also finding compensation 
mechanisms for the sectors dollars do not reach. This is the 
challenge. 
  [Urruzola] The state's role in the previous period, that is, 
when measures to become self-sufficient were not taken, is now 
strongly criticized on the island. Not everyone believes that 
the current situation has arisen solely from the downfall of 
Eastern Europe and the U.S. blockade -- about which there is 
also discussion of its real economic impact -- but people talk 
about "squandering" and "irresponsibility." Has your country's 
leadership been unable to devise alternative economic policies? 
  [Robaina] We have openly done a self-examination on this 
issue. In my opinion we were overconfident. For a long time we 
got used to the existing pipeline and to the mechanisms that 
guaranteed certain sectors. This led us to believe they were 
guaranteed for life. We thus neglected, for example, the arable 
land and the habits that made the population consume or not 
consume the currently successful crops. 
  It is a very serious responsibility that we are taking on as 
a state. When we began to change, we believed that we would 
have more time, but we were overwhelmed by an extremely tough 
situation in a period of time much shorter than had been 
envisioned. This is one of our dilemmas today: to what extent 
the state must remain in those areas in which it has 
demonstrated efficiency, and what the priorities for change 
might be in those areas in which it has not. I believe the 
phenomenon of mechanically transferring mistakes or copying 
models is very clear. Therefore, with both calmness and 
alacrity, we must avoid running into the same stumbling block. 
Everywhere there are positive and negative experiences, but we 
cannot -- again -- mechanically transfer policies from others. 
I share the opinion of those who must have told you that for 
some time the state implemented measures that led us into 
stagnation. I am also among those who believe that, even though 
the blockade represents the greatest problem in coping with the 
current situation, there are also problems that do not depend on 
the U.S. blockade. There is a second blockade that life has 
imposed on us. And there is a third blockade that involves us, 
that depends on our mistakes, our bureaucracy, and our inability 
to resolve some issues. There are many things on our shoulders, 
but all depends on what we are able to do. Our country cannot 
remain waiting for the blockade to be lifted. We must 
constantly condemn it, and sooner or later it will be lifted, 
but we cannot wait, sitting back and doing nothing. Undoubtedly 
we had to learn things in a tense and very difficult situation. 
Had we done these things before, the country would not be 
experiencing the current economic situation. 
  [Urruzola] Until recently you headed the Union of Young 
Communists. You must therefore be well acquainted with young 
people. Apparently, most of those who are 20 years old dream of 
leaving Cuba. Those who are 30 years old hope to be free to 
leave and enter Cuba, a freedom they do not have nowadays 
because of laws or regulations that have existed for many years. 
Isn't this at odds with the current situation? 
  [Robaina] The situation is, first, not only no longer the 
same as that which prevailed many years ago, but it is also no 
longer that which prevailed a few months ago, either. The 
ability to enter or leave our country currently does not depend 
on Cuba's having more or fewer regulations. For the first time 
Cuba is now under the same conditions as the rest of the world, 
and the people's only limitation -- which is serious, essential, 
and very complex -- is the lack of money or foreign currency. 
  [Urruzola] University graduates, for example, say they 
require the education minister's authorization to go abroad. 
  [Robaina] Incidentally, I was going to discuss the issue of 
professionals. As in any country in the world, some people are 
subject to regulatory processes, not for traveling, but for 
certain proceedings that are required depending on their task. 
As never before, we have become more flexible concerning age 
limits, proceedings, and paperwork. Even though this issue has 
not been entirely resolved, I assure you it will be resolved 
soon, because it will be one of the points for discussion during 
a conference on emigration scheduled for 22-24 April. Many of 
these migration issues were proper for a time that has 
definitely been overcome. In the past, people eagerly sought 
travel. Now there is a process that will be increasing as 
regulations are removed. In this process, people will discover 
their own ways. Nowadays many talk about leaving because they 
have not experienced what is felt when one leaves. 
Nevertheless, it has become normal for people to leave and 
return, even with unexpected frequency. Some people believed 
hundreds of people were going to remain abroad. Actually there 
are hundreds of people who returned with their own conclusions. 
We are experiencing a normalization process, not only for those 
who are inside and want to leave, but also for those who are 
outside and want to enter. 
  [Urruzola] For many years the issue of Cuban exiles has been 
marked by politics. In other words, those who were leaving were 
"worms," or leaving was tantamount to betrayal. This caused an 
entire generation, your generation, to grow up harshly 
criticizing their fellow countrymen living abroad. All of a 
sudden this does not apply, and the people are told that the 
Cubans living abroad, save those who are engaged in "hysterical 
politics" as you have described it, have a right to become 
concerned about your country's destiny. This represents a very 
drastic change. 
  [Robaina] I do not believe it is all of a sudden. We are 
talking about 30-odd years, and there are precedents for this 
new period. It is not the first time that our country has 
maintained a relationship with Cubans abroad. And changes are 
taking place not only within our country, but also outside. Now 
the Cubans who are living in other countries are not 
characterized by the historical attitude of those who, committed 
to politics, claimed for themselves the total and absolute 
representation of the Cuban community abroad. Part of this 
community has remained silent for many years, fearing 
harassment, but now it is no longer silent, and the hysterical 
people are actually concerned. My country requires people from 
outside to become familiar with our internal situation, and the 
people inside need to become familiar with the outside situation. 
  I believe our country needs to understand that today we have 
two paths: Either we hold out our hand and control the 
Cuba-emigration connection as does any country in the world, in 
a normal and civilized relationship, or that large mass of 
people will remain instrumental to policies hostile to our 
country. This must be understood, and overstatements must be 
avoided. If they were called worms at a given time, it was 
proper in a given situation. It is also not necessary to cry 
repentance because, as I have already said, it actually is 
important to be abreast of the new times and stick to 
essentials. And it is essential for this relationship to be 
normal and fluid. There is a limit to this: All those who left 
our country do not have a right to tell us, those of us who 
remained in our country, what to do. These are the rules of the 
game that my country imposes today for talks and rapprochement. 
It would not be true to tell you that everyone understands 
this. And I believe in the people who harbor doubts. I believe 
they are more sincere and more authentic. And I am willing to 
talk and discuss things with these people. 
  [Urruzola] According to Cuba's current legislation, the 
foreign capital that is eligible to invest in Cuba is that 
belonging to companies or individuals residing abroad. Does 
this mean that Cubans living abroad will be able to invest in 
their country? 
  [Robaina] This is a very serious problem. From a legal 
standpoint Cuba cannot embark on a foreign investment drive 
saying that "everybody except Cubans who have left the country 
are eligible to invest here." No country in the world would 
tolerate or understand this. The problem lies in the fact that 
the country in which they want to invest is a country they have 
left, and there are wounds that have not yet healed. In my 
view, we have to build a climate of trust through foreign 
investment in general, because there are many Cubans who are not 
yet convinced that the country needs foreign investments, and 
still less that those who left Cuba should be allowed to invest 
here. The country has just implemented an opening drive. There 
is therefore no need to give precedence to Cubans residing 
abroad, but by the same token we cannot say that they are the 
only ones who are not eligible to invest in our country. The 
challenge that we now face is to try to find a happy medium, 
something that is indeed quite difficult for us Cubans. 
  [Urruzola] There will come a moment when, of necessity, 
Cubans living abroad will invest in Cuba. 
  [Robaina] Precisely. 
  [Urruzola] Will this fact lead to the question: "And why not 
Cubans who live on the island?" 
  [Robaina] That will be at a later stage. It is obvious that 
we cannot limit ourselves to the Cubans that went into exile, as 
this would entail other problems. Scientists will contend that 
they, who stayed behind to do research and were thus unable to 
amass a fortune, are not allowed to invest in their country, 
while others who made money through other means are allowed to 
do so. These are unavoidable risks; and as you see, they cannot 
be solved overnight. 
  [Urruzola] I was told in Cuba that of every 10 youngsters 
who 
reach the age limit for affiliation with the UJC [Young 
Communists Union], approximately nine do not want to join the 
party. At a university, faculty members even told me that they 
were having trouble having students elect class delegates, 
because youngsters did not want to be elected. Have Cuban 
youngsters gotten tired of politics? 
  [Robaina] One needs a lot of background information to make 
that judgment, and I personally do not share that view. During 
their first years at school, just to cite the example you 
brought up, students always ask themselves whether or not they 
should take on political responsibilities incident to the life 
of young university students, which is something very complex. 
I can assure you that the UJC registered an all-time growth in 
1993 -- 100,000 youngsters affiliated with it. 
  [Urruzola] There are those who contend that party 
affiliation 
used to be selective in the past, whereas now there is mass 
affiliation. 
  [Robaina] No, there is no mass affiliation at any level. The 
selection criteria are even more strict, as affiliation is no 
longer dependent on the request made by a youngster to join the 
party, as was the case for some time, but rather on the decision 
to accept or reject this request made at a board meeting. Yet 
the underlying subject concerning the UJC is that it should not 
only devote itself to working with militants, but rather extend 
its wings to target the mass audience. Furthermore, party 
affiliation by youngsters has always had its ups and downs, in 
every place and every province, and even according to the work 
of the party itself. Many times the UJC is blamed for this. 
And yet things do not always depend on the UJC, but also on the 
party in general and the party in particular, and on the body 
the youngsters are to join. 
  I believe the greatest exchange of ideas undoubtedly 
continues to be among the young. Even though throughout the 
world signs of apathy can be seen most clearly among the young, 
things are different in Cuba, as there are a great number of 
youngsters involved in economic, political, scientific, and 
social pursuits. And yet to contend that the change the country 
is undergoing has had no repercussions would be to deny 
something that has been traumatic, for example, for my 
generation. The most important challenge that the UJC faces at 
present is to come to grips with a process involving 5.7 million 
Cubans who are under 30. What my parents considered sacred 
conquests, to be defended until death, are nothing novel to any 
of us as this was already in place when we were born. Moreover, 
the young do not like to be constantly reminded that they never 
lived under capitalism, because they are not to blame for that. 
One cannot establish dialogue or the rules of the game on the 
basis of these codes. I do believe, however, that the key to 
success is that they feel they are participants in and masters 
of their pursuits; otherwise they will not defend them. 
  [Urruzola] Do you feel you are participating today? 
  [Robaina] I think young people are participating. I am not 
saying an overwhelming majority of them; nor do I believe in the 
concept of unanimity. I believe in the thousands of young 
people who participate in the country's development, although I 
also know that many young people feel disillusioned with our 
project, for family, social, or political reasons, or due to 
foreign influences. Or better said, they do not feel enthusiasm 
for our project, but feel attracted by the siren songs emanating 
from abroad. 
  When the blockade is lifted it will not only be medicines 
and 
food that Cuba will receive. The country and the new 
generations will have to face much tougher decisions than the 
ones we are facing today. The discussion will be at the level 
of values, ideas, and lifestyle. The enemy is not as clearly 
perceived as before, which is complex and difficult to 
understand for young people. I think what Cuban young people 
need most today is to learn about young people in the rest of 
the world, and how they live. Their biggest problem is that 
they do not value what they have today. This attitude is also 
due to an excessive paternalism developed over a long period of 
time. 
  [Urruzola] When I visited Cuba I did not feel that Cubans 
were really concerned about the issue of a multiparty system. 
What seems important is the separation of the state from the 
party, the revaluation of civilian society and the role of 
citizens. Cubans seem to want the party reduced to a more 
specific role. They seem to want the party out of numerous 
areas where its opinion and decisions are not necessary. Is 
this so? 
  [Robaina] I am glad you have perceived both feelings, 
particularly the one referring to the multiparty system, which 
is not a priority in my country. The world has taught us that 
like it or not, accept it or not, the single party system in my 
country, in practice, has resolved more situations that the 
multiparty system in other countries. It is a very typical 
Cuban solution. We implemented it because of a threat that has 
not yet disappeared. The interest in setting limits on state and 
party responsibilities is not only society's concern. The party 
itself is concerned about the problem. The issue was discussed 
at length in recent meetings. When the party started 
administering the country, it neglected more appropriate 
political tasks. Besides, it was not prepared to administer, 
and did not do a good job. We realize that clearly. The 
important thing today is to determine what party role we should 
strengthen, which roles are appropriate, and how to strengthen 
the state and the government, also through their own particular 
roles. That means we must strengthen state power structures and 
establish state jurisdictions which for a long time were very 
much superimposed. This situation made it very difficult to 
know who was responsible for what. In this sense we started 
walking down a certain path. But there are more things that we 
must still do than things we have already done. 
  [Urruzola] On that path there has already begun to appear 
something that will probably increase with time: the Cuba of 
differences. Differences of possibilities, opportunities, and 
dollars. This is seemingly provoking an irreversible 
deterioration in the ethical values on which the revolution was 
built. Does the country leadership perceive it that way? 
  [Robaina] That is part of the inevitable risk. We know that 
it will be worse if we do not face reality. I think you are 
correct. Today we live a world of differences. But I think it 
is also necessary to make clear that it was much more serious 
when those differences existed in an illegal world. The 
elimination of penalties for holding dollars did not create 
differences, it only brought to light things that already 
existed. The options we had were either to ignore that reality, 
or to face it and seek mechanisms to compensate for it. 
  We sought mechanisms to prevent society from going 
backwards. 
We wanted society to continue having a solid base, a structure 
of extremely rich moral values. That is not easy to implement. 
Even in the Cuba of differences, there are a lot of examples of 
solidarity and equality. For instance, when young people 
working in the area of tourism decide, on their own initiative, 
to share their incomes with others working in sugar harvesting. 
Or when someone receives hard currency and purchases staples 
for himself and his neighbors, or tennis shoes for his children 
and a friend's children. Cuba is not only a country with 
differences. It is also a country where people share. But it 
is true that we are facing an important challenge in the area of 
values and ethics.

<F P=106> [Report by Jose Marcano from "The News" program] </F>
  [Text] The Venezuelan Congress has approved the Special 
Powers Law granting special powers to the president to decree 
economic and financial measures. The law was approved in the 
same form passed by the Chamber of Deputies, despite dissenting 
votes by Democratic Action. 
  Article 1 includes a luxury consumption and wholesale tax 
and 
repeals the value-added tax. It reforms the income tax law and 
the basic tax code and includes a tax on bank account debits. 
Article 5 reforms the Stamp Tax Law, and Article 6 extends the 
deadline set in Article 22 of the Basic Budget Law for the 
executive branch to submit the draft budget to Congress each 
year. Article 7 establishes norms regulating the concession of 
national public projects and services. 
  [Begin recording] [National Convergence Senator Bernardo 
Celli] We are remembering that people are an important factor in 
all social processes. The current law is a combination of 
something economic and something social. 
  [Radical Cause Deputy Alberto Muller Rojas] Congress must 
maintain control over certain legal instruments that have the 
potential to seriously and adversely affect Venezuelan citizen. 
  [AD Senator William Davila Barrio] We are opposed because we 
are talking about a matter that will have a deep impact on the 
state as well as society. [end recording] 
  After the Special Powers Law is enacted and published in the 
official gazette, the president of the Republic has 30 days to 
implement all the measures contained in the law. That means the 
special powers will only be granted to the president for 30 days.

<F P=106> [Report by Rayma Rondon from "The News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Less than 24 hours after congressional approval, 
President Rafael Caldera signed the Special Powers Law. 
  The new law, which grants special powers to the president, 
allowing him to legislate economic and financial issues, will 
become effective on 20 April, when it will be published in the 
official gazette. 
  President Caldera is to discuss in full that same day the 
Special Powers Law during the Council of Ministers meeting. An 
official source has disclosed the Projects Concessions Law [Ley 
de Obras por el Sistema de Concesiones] will be one of the first 
laws up for approval. The executive branch believes this is an 
important law which is expected to stimulate the economy. 
  [Begin recording] [Allan Viergutz, Venezuelan Oil Chamber 
president] We believe the Concessions Law is very convenient. 
We believe there is a need for creative measures that would 
lead to new options that will benefit the country. These 
measures will allow the government to deal more efficiently with 
the fiscal deficit, high interest rates, and the problem of 
unemployment. This law will stimulate the economy. [end

  [Text] San Jose, 17 Apr (ACAN-EFE) -- The Costa Rican 
justice system gave Paul Carpenter, the former Democratic 
senator from California, 20 days to present evidence in his 
defense before resolving a U.S. Government extradition request 
against him for alleged bribery and misuse of funds. 
  Carpenter was arrested last Thursday by Costa Rican Judicial 
Investigation Agency (OIJ) officials in a neighborhood in 
northern San Jose at the request of U.S. judicial officials. 
The former U.S. senator, located by Interpol (International 
Police) and the Costa Rican OIJ, has been under an arrest 
warrant since he fled his country last February to avoid a 
seven-year prison sentence imposed by a district court in 
Sacramento, California. 
  Carpenter is accused of alleged bribery and misuse of funds 
in a political campaign, illegal financial transactions, and 
obstruction of justice. 
  Carpenter said in San Jose, "I came to Costa Rica to die," 
in 
an interview granted to the newspaper THE SACRAMENTO BEE from 
his San Jose prison, where he has been held under arrest since 
Thursday awaiting an extradition resolution being handled by the 
Higher Criminal Court in San Jose. 
  The former politician is suffering from advanced prostate 
cancer, and he made it known to the Sacramento court in a letter 
he sent a few days before escaping to Costa Rica, where he 
entered with a safe-conduct and not with a passport, according 
to police reports. 
  Carpenter has insisted in Costa Rica that he is "innocent" 
and says he is a victim of the FBI. It has been learned in San 
Jose that a Sacramento investigation of corruption led to an 
accusation against the former congressman and his Democratic 
assistants Alan Robbins and Clay Jackson, alleged masterminds of 
a complicated bribery plan to finance his political campaign. 
Carpenter was a Democratic state senator from 1976 to 1986. 
  "I never broke the law, I am a victim of political ambition, 
the lawyers, and the FBI," he said. He said he believes he will 
win the process begun in Costa Rica, where he expects to live 
until his death.

  [Text] At approximately 0530, a group of unidentified 
individuals opened fire on a military checkpoint located on the 
highway from Tuxtla Gutierrez to Chicoasen Dam in Chiapas State. 
The attack lasted approximately 50 minutes. As a result, one 
Mexican Army communications sergeant was wounded and died a few 
hours later at a hospital. This is all that happened in that 
isolated incident. 
  Miguel Angel Godinez Bravo, Seventh Military Region 
commander, explained on behalf of the National Defense 
Secretariat that there is no relation between this incident and 
the Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN]. We must also 
point out that at 0600, two Bell combat helicopters and a 
Pilatus Air Force airplane overflew La Chacona Mountain, 
strafing different areas in an attempt to locate the 
perpetrators of the attack. Chiapas Attorney General Arturo 
Becerra Martinez ruled out any connection between this morning's 
clash in Tuxtla Gutierrez and the EZLN. 
  [Begin Becerra recording] So far, we do not know the motive 
or name of the assailants. Until now nothing indicates the EZLN 
is linked to the attack. Should we obtain further information, 
the Attorney General's Office will pass it along to you later.

  [Text] United Nations, 14 Apr (EFE) -- Argentina announced 
today its "firm intention" to place at the disposal of the 
United Nations some 1,500 troops for rapid deployment in 
peace-keeping operations. 
  During a meeting at the United Nations, alternate Argentine 
Ambassador Raul Alberto Ricardes said a final decision on this 
issue will be made soon. Negotiations are being conducted at 
the United Nations by which member countries specify the number 
of units and elements they might contribute to the United 
Nations, at short notice, for peace-keeping operations. 
  Ricardes said the conditions, methods, and other specific 
points on Argentina's participation will be negotiated between 
his country and the United Nations. 
  Ricardes said the units that might be placed at the disposal 
of the United Nations include two infantry battalions, a 
logistics battalion, an engineering company, a communications 
company, 40 military observers, and 35 civil police. 
  The materiel would include a missile-launching corvette, 
four 
patrol boats, a transport plane for troops and cargo, a 
transport ship, a field hospital, a mobile air traffic control 
unit, and two terminals for airfields. 
  Argentine diplomatic sources noted that the ceiling for the 
Argentine participation in peace operations is 1,500 troops, in 
addition to the 150 troops recently offered for participation in 
Bosnia at the request of the United Nations to strengthen the 
ceasefire agreements in Sarajevo and central Bosnia. 
  Ricardes' statement today apparently refers to these 1,500 
troops. 
  Those responsible for UN peace-keeping operations announced 
today that 18 of the 184 UN member countries have so far offered 
a total of 28,000 people for the rapid deployment system. They 
hope for additional commitments in the near future that might 
increase this total to about 70,000 people.

  [Text] La Paz -- As the "narco-links" case [involving 
alleged links between former President Jaime Paz Zamora and his 
party, the Movement of the Revolutionary Left, MIR, with drug 
trafficking] gains impetus, fear grows within government and 
political circles that the U.S. Court may issue a "massive 
request for extradition of Bolivian citizens who perpetrated 
attacks and/or crimes within U.S. territory, according to 
official sources. [no closing quotation marks as published] 
  According to Interior Under Secretary Hugo San Martin, 
"there 
is an extradition procedure that has probably been considered 
for the `Rico Toro case' and will probably be used for other 
people." 
  Some legislators fear that as a result of the developments 
following the charges and statements by drug trafficker Carmelo 
Dominguez Vaca and the report on the FELCN [Special 
Antinarcotics Force] operations, the United States may request 
the extradition of "many Bolivian citizens involved in drug 
trafficking such as General Felipe Carvajal Badani, retired, the 
former National Police chief." 
  Referring to the former police chief, the FELCN report 
states: "In October 1989 (Jaime) Paz Zamora swore in Felipe 
Carvajal as the National Police commander. Carvajal, a MIR 
activist well known for being corrupt, has a strong relationship 
with Capobianco. Carvajal resigned on 12 March 1991 charging 
that the U.S. Embassy was pressuring him." 
  When Hugo San Martin was asked on Thursday, 31 March, if he 
knew of an alleged U.S. request to the Bolivian Foreign Ministry 
for the extradition of Gen. Felipe Carvajal he answered: "We 
have nothing official." 
  Diplomatic sources explained that despite the lack of an 
extradition treaty between Bolivia and the United States that 
explicitly refers to trafficking, the latter "has every right to 
seek the extradition of any Bolivian citizens it believes are 
involved in trafficking in U.S. territory." 
  As an example they mentioned that in the past few years the 
number of U.S. requests for extradition for this reason amounted 
to about two dozen. Of these requests, however, the Supreme 
Court only approved the "case of Chunty Roca Suarez," who was 
sentenced by the civil court to 15 years imprisonment. 
  On 23 March the U.S. Embassy officially asked the Bolivian 
Foreign Ministry to extradite former Army Colonel Faustino Rico 
Toro for violating the Miami federal antinarcotics law. 
  The Foreign Ministry submitted the request for extradition 
to 
the Supreme Court of Justice which, in turn, submitted it to the 
Attorney General's office. Attorney General Angel Baldivieso 
has ordered Rico Toro's preventive imprisonment while legal 
procedures are completed. 
  Meanwhile, Government Minister German Quiroga Gomez 
disclosed 
that Faustino Rico Toro, who is believed to have shipped cocaine 
from Bolivia to the United States, will continue incommunicado 
in the FELCN prison in La Paz.

  [Text] Washington -- An effort of almost three years of 
difficult negotiations -- which were marked by the turbulence of 
the Collor era and by five replacements at the head of the 
Finance Ministry -- will end today in New York, with the signing 
of an agreement for reducing and rescheduling the debt that 
Brazil owes to private foreign creditors. 
  Central Bank President Pedro Malan, who designed the 
strategy 
of negotiations with the banks and led the implementation of 
that strategy, will be in New York to supervise the formality 
during which old debt certificates will be exchanged for 
rescheduled debt bonds, making the agreement come into force. 
No ceremonies have been scheduled. The agreement will be 
announced through a press communique which might be followed by 
a brief conference -- which has yet to be confirmed -- hosted by 
Malan and Citibank Vice President William R. Rhodes, who 
represented the banks at the negotiations. 
  Official Brazilian sources and sources from the creditor 
banks committee yesterday said they do not believe that U.S. 
investor Kenneth Dart, who owes 3.4 percent of the Brazilian 
foreign debt, will try to block the agreement. If he attempts 
to do so he will cause a still steeper drop in the value of his 
Brazilian certificates, which are worth approximately $1.4 
billion and have suffered a strong devaluation over the past 45 
days as a consequence of the storm that high interest rates in 
the United States has provoked on the foreign debt's secondary 
market. 
  Early this week in Guadalajara, where Malan represented 
Brazil at an Inter-American Development Bank meeting, he said 
that the doors of the Central Bank remain open to Dart. "Yet 
the Central Bank will be ready to respond if he attacks," Malan 
added. A platoon of Central Bank and banks committee lawyers, 
who are engaged in clarifying a lot of the technical details of 
the agreement, is in a state of readiness. 
<H5>  Option </H5>
  The main U.S. manufacturer of thermal insulators [isopor], 
Dart bought the Brazilian debt papers with a discount of more 
than 70 percent, hoping to earn hundreds of millions of dollars 
with the revaluation of these papers. His initial option was 
for the capitalization bonds, one of the six refinancing papers 
offered by Brazil, and he has for months refused to accept the 
final terms of the renegotiation, which have already been 
endorsed by the other creditors (more than 750). All creditors 
agreed to a second option, which was provided for in the 
contracts, and invested at least 35 percent of their papers in 
discount bonds. 
  Asked about the plans of his client, Dart's lawyer in New 
York, Martin London, replied mysteriously: "No comment." Even 
though Dart is a peculiar person -- he recently changed his U.S. 
citizenship for Belizean citizenship, and moved his residence to 
this small Central American country to stop paying income tax to 
Washington -- financial executives yesterday said that he would 
not burn money or take foolish steps. Consequently, there is 
hope that the agreement will actually be concluded. 
  Just in case, the Central Bank has over the past few days 
adopted several measures to protect Brazilian assets abroad from 
a possible court-ordered embargo. Government legal advisers 
have said that from a technical viewpoint it would be very 
difficult for Dart to justify an action of that kind before a 
judge, because of the terms of the contracts. They are sure, 
however, that Dart will take legal action against the Central 
Bank after implementation of the agreement. The advisers are 
getting ready to reply, and they believe that Dart will also 
find it difficult to convince a judge of the merit of his 
complaint.

"Strong Ties"] 
  [Text] Petrobras [Brazilian Petroleum Corporation] 
President Joel Renno was in Buenos Aires on 13 April closing 
several deals. One of them is very curious: The Brazilian 
company sold 20 percent of its participation in a prospecting 
area in the southern Argentine sea platform between Tierra del 
Fuego and the Malvinas Islands. Do you know to whom it was sold? 
To YPF [Government Oil Deposits], which no longer has the oil 
industry monopoly and is no longer a public company. Renno did 
not reveal the operation's value. 
  In that prospecting area, Petrobras already had invested $7 
million by drilling the first well and will invest an additional 
$12 million by drilling the first well 120 meters below the 
water level. Petrobras is associated in the deal with the 
company BHP Australia and other European companies. Even by 
selling 20 percent of its participation, Petrobras still holds 
40 percent of the capital of this enterprise, which is called 
San Julian-Marine. "We are still the largest shareholders in the 
deal," Renno said. 
  Petrobras also is investing in a new gas prospecting area in 
northwestern Argentina and is selling fuel oil to Buenos Aires 
thermal electric plants. 
  "Brazil is currently the main buyer of Argentine oil and 
Argentina is our second supplier after Saudi Arabia," Brazilian 
Ambassador to Argentina Marcos Azambuja said. 
  Yesterday was a good day to commemorate the increase of 
Brazilian purchases. The Argentine Government has published its 
January trade balance figures. And there was no good news. 
Argentina registered a $600 million deficit, which is larger 
than last year's accumulated January-May deficit. The Argentine 
trade deficit with Brazil in January was $96 million. 
  Yesterday was a typical Mercosur [Common Market of the 
South] 
day in the Brazilian Embassy in Buenos Aires. A group of 40 
Brazilian businessmen who already have businesses in Argentina 
was holding a meeting to analyze new business opportunities in 
the Argentine market. "They meet once a month," said Brazilian 
Embassy minister counselor Pedro Luis Rodriguez, who is also 
enthusiastic about the cooperation possibilities between the two 
countries.

the kidnapping of Deputy Adolfo Alvarado in Olancho Department; 
place and date not given -- live or recorded] 
  [Text] According to our reports, Alfonso Alvarado was 
kidnapped in San Esteban at 0800 today by three people who 
reportedly wanted to do business with him. His butler, who was 
with Alvarado, left them alone so they could talk. After 20 
minutes, the butler discovered Alvarado had been kidnapped. The 
kidnappers left a note, which Alvarado's relatives took to 
Olancho Regional Commander Lt. Col. Medrano. In the note, 
members of an armed group known as Los Cinchoneros informed Mrs. 
Alvarado that they were foreigners and were demanding a 1.5 
million lempiras ransom, otherwise her husband would be 
executed. The kidnappers drove a red Hilux pickup. The note 
also said that the ransom money should be dropped at a lumber 
mill near San Pedro Sula at 1630 local on Saturday, and that Mr. 
Alvarado would be released at Aguacaliente at 1600 on Sunday. 
The note stipulated that neither the police, the Army, nor 
another country should be told about the kidnapping and that 
counterfeit or marked money should not be delivered. The note 
was signed by a rural commando that fights on behalf of 
exploited people. 
  [Panama City ACAN in Spanish at 0016 GMT on 16 April

"Deputy Adolfo Alvarado Lara, who was kidnapped on Thursday,

  [Text] Lima, 16 Apr (EFE) -- The pro-Maoist Shining Path 
guerrilla group today called for a peace agreement with the 
government by sending to a Lima television station a video that 
showed a hooded man reading a letter from Shining Path leader 
Abimael Guzman. The message read by the hooded man, who was 
accompanied by another hooded Shining Path member, emphasizes 
the need to reach a peace agreement with President Alberto 
Fujimori's administration. 
  The letter states that the Communist Party of Peru, which is 
Shining Path's official name, feels that because the government 
"has made progress in its efforts following 5 April 1992" -- the 
day Fujimori staged a self-inflicted coup through which he 
dissolved Congress and assumed total power with the support of 
the military, the Communist Party of Peru "has thought at length 
about this situation." 
  The message adds: "The party and its Directorate must make a 
decision, because, if in the past we advocated a popular war, we 
must now reach a peace agreement." 
  The letter points out: "All popular war activities must be 
suspended, except those that are defensive in nature, under the 
condition that the government also suspends its activities." 
Once this condition is met, the hooded man added, a peace 
agreement can be reached. 
  A few days ago, President Fujimori said he received a third 
letter from Abimael Guzman, which he did not plan to divulge. 
He added that this letter was stored in a safe to which he 
alone knows the combination. 
  In October 1993, Guzman sent two letters to Fujimori in 
which 
he also called for peace and appealed to his followers to 
suspend their violent activities. This appeal, however, has 
gone unheeded by at least one Shining Path faction. In his 
letters, Guzman, who was arrested on 12 September 1992 in Lima 
and has been sentenced to life in prison, did not say that he 
had surrendered.

  [Text] Caracas, 15 Apr (EFE) -- Venezuelan Defense Minister 
General Rafael Montero Revette said today he does not think "the 
installation of foreign military forces will be accepted" in his 
country; he was referring to the possibility the United States 
could install a military base in Venezuela. 
  Montero told journalists the topic was discussed during a 
meeting he had yesterday with General Barry McCaffrey, commander 
in chief of the U.S. Southern Command. 
  Montero refused to comment on whether Colombia will permit 
the installation of U.S. military forces in its territory. 
  "We cannot speculate on that, and I do not know if Colombia 
will accept it," Montero said. He said, however, the Venezuelan 
Armed Forces' position is contrary to a foreign military 
presence in the country. 
  Montero said during his meeting with McCaffrey they 
discussed 
relations between both countries' Armed Forces and the 
drug-trafficking problem. 
  Regarding President Cesar Gaviria's proposal of creating an 
OAS multilateral military force, he said: "Each country is 
sovereign, and we are not going to have a regional intervention 
force; we do not favor creating a multilateral force." 
  Regarding the internal political situation, Montero said: 
"Venezuela knows it wants peace and to overcome the present 
economic crisis." He ruled out a possible new military uprising 
if the government does not overcome the present crisis, contrary 
to what Lieutenant Colonel Hugo Chavez, head of the 4 February 
1992 coup attempt, has said.

<F P=106> [Article by Maria Clara R. M. do Prado] </F>
  [Text] Exchange operations on the financial market have 
registered an $800 million deficit. Payments on external 
obligations have heavily influenced Brazilian external accounts, 
while no sufficient compensatory income came from the financial 
sector. 
  Stock markets have continued to attract rather significant 
amounts of foreign funds -- the balance is $251 million, 
including investments in stocks and portfolios. Foreign funds 
also have been attracted by fixed earning funds for foreign 
capital, which were created at the end of 1993 for investment of 
the debenture funds. The flow of income into these funds, which 
used to stand at $80 million a month, rose to $122 million, with 
the total value of fund capital standing at $1.631 billion on 30 
March. 
  However, obtaining capital through bonds, notes, and 
commercial papers [preceding two words in English] has been 
rather slow. The balance in March was still positive -- income 
reached $1.851 billion while the outflow stood at $1.6 billion 
-- but the balance is expected to be smaller in March as a 
result of the difficulties in selling securities abroad, which 
Brazilian enterprises and banks already have felt. 
  Foreign currency operations tied to foreign debt obligations 
-- this includes interest not only on the debt that was 
contracted in the 1970's but also on the debt contracted in this 
decade in bonds and other papers -- have increased: remittances 
of $470 million went to pay interest, while $270 million went 
for amortizing loans contracted within the terms of Resolution 
No. 63 (contracting of external loans for domestic use). 
  Profits and dividends of $340 million also were paid, while 
$300 million was paid to amortize funds that were used for 
financing imports. The figures were released by the Central 
Bank, whose technicians believe the financial sector performed 
poorly because of the effects of the remittances and payments on 
the external obligations. 
  From a strict viewpoint, the influence of such payments and 
remittances should be inversely proportional to the country's 
ability to contract new loans abroad. Last month, the inflow of 
money into the stock markets was significant -- it reached 
$1.851 billion -- but in this case it is volatile capital. In 
the same month, the capital outflow reached $1.6 billion. 
  Actually, international reserves last month grew on the 
basis 
of the currency exchange operations involving foreign trade. At 
the foreign currency level, exports yielded $4 billion 
(effective cash inflow), repeating the performance of January. 
As for imports, which since the beginning of last year have had 
the same performance, they caused a foreign currency drain of 
$1.8 billion. Last month, the net income from financial and 
commercial operations stood at approximately $1.4 billion. This 
will push the first quarter's net surplus to approximately $7 
billion, well above the $2.3 billion net surplus registered in 
the first quarter of 1993. 
  During the first days of April, the Central Bank has 
observed 
that export income remains high, standing at around $200 million 
per day. In the financial sector, however, incoming and outgoing 
flows still are registering a deficit. It is still early -- only 
four workdays have passed -- to conclude that this is a trend, 
but projections lead to the conclusion that April will also 
register a deficit in the financial exchange market.

<F P=106> [Article by Marta Salomon] </F>
  [Text] Brasilia -- The mint is getting ready to print the 
equivalent of $2 billion in bonds that will serve to back the 
financing of the elections for president, governor, and federal 
and state senators and deputies in October. This is the 
preliminary estimate of the cost of the campaign this year -- 
the first one in which the law will allow donations from 
companies and individuals. From the stamps on the letters to 
voters to opinion polls, shows, small jet expenses, and 
television programs, everything must be accounted for by the 
political parties and converted into electoral bonds that will 
be issued by the national Treasury. 
  According to TSE [Superior Electoral Court] Director General 
Alysson Mitraut, without having received the official campaign 
budgets from the parties yet, the TSE has suggested that the 
Finance Ministry print 20 million electoral bonds with values in 
UFIR's [reference fiscal unit] and real cruzeiros ranging from 
the equivalent of $100 to $100,000. Despite the high value of 
the bond issuance, the members of Congress who approved the law 
last September admit that part of the campaign money will not be 
controlled by the TSE. 
  The TSE cost estimate has shocked Finance Ministry experts. 
The proposal sent to Treasury Secretary Murilo Portugal 
coincides with an unofficial scale that circulates in Brasilia 
on the election costs. According to the scale, a deputy can be 
elected for approximately $500,000. A campaign for governor 
costs between $10 million and $15 million. And the election of 
the president of the Republic might cost something between $50 
million and $100 million. 
  At the end of the campaign, if the law is fully obeyed, the 
TSE will have identified the financing sources of each 
candidate. Without testing the law's efficiency, the TSE is 
certain of one thing: The expenses that will be officially 
declared will be much higher than those in 1989. For example, 
during the last presidential elections, the coalition that took 
former President Collor to power declared having spent $850,000 
in the two election rounds -- nearly 100 times less than the 
average cost estimated for the presidential campaigns this year. 
[Workers Party presidential candidate Luiz Inacio] Lula [da 
Silva] said he has spent $365,000, which would only pay for 
three hours of television programs. 
  "Everything used to be registered in a double accounting in 
the past," admitted Deputy Eraldo Tinoco (PFL-BA) [Liberal Front 
Party- Bahia], responsible for the financial guidance of the PFL 
candidates. "There was a lot of hypocrisy in the past," Senator 
Marco Maciel (PFL-PE) [Pernambuco] summarized. During the times 
of the CPI [Congressional Investigative Committee] on PC [Paulo 
Cesar Farias], Maciel suggested that campaigns be financed by 
the government like in Germany -- the only way, he says, to put 
an end to double accounting by companies, the diversion of funds 
from the national budget, or the reception of funds from the 
illegal numbers lottery. 
  "We will be very careful with the campaign money," said 
former Mayor Pimenta da Veiga, one of the coordinators for 
Fernando Henrique Cardoso's candidacy. PSDB [Brazilian Social 
Democracy Party] Secretary General Sergio Motta thinks Cardoso's 
campaign will cost something between $50 million and $70 
million. "It is absurd to speak of hundreds of thousands of 
dollars," Motta said. 
  The campaign committee of PT [Workers Party] candidate Luis 
Inacio Lula da Silva believes Lula should spend more than what 
he spent in 1989 but not spend very much. According to PT 
members, transportation expenditures will be the highest but 
this will be compensated for by the low cost of television 
programs because the law demands that they be filmed in studios. 
  Electoral bonds are an innovation in Brazil. They were 
designed while the electoral laws were being amended, and their 
objective is to make transparent the relations between 
candidates and their financial agents. They operate as an 
electoral "currency," with receipts issued as in a legal 
financial operation. 
  The existing law sets forth that they will be printed by the 
mint as bearer bonds, numbered and valued in reference fiscal 
units (UFIR). The law also sets forth that they will be issued 
for a total equivalent to the overall expenses estimated by the 
parties for each election, at all levels. 
  Parties will have to operate with those bonds and will 
identify recipients -- the enterprises and individuals who make 
donations for the campaign, for example, this year, for the 
candidates for the presidency, state governorships, Senate, 
Chamber of Deputies, and legislative assemblies. Financial 
supporters are entitled to an income tax reduction. For their 
part, parties must keep a list of donors, identifying each 
delivered bond, for five years. 
  It is expected that the bonds' creation will break the 
"underground" connection between candidates and entrepreneurs, 
especially contractors, avoiding in the future the repayment of 
investments made during the campaign in exchange for projects, 
favors, and budget amendments to satisfy the interest of 
electoral "donors." 
  Supreme Electoral Tribunal President Sepulveda Pertence 
fears 
that despite the issuance of bonds, irregular donations to 
campaigns will continue. In fact, the electoral courts will have 
a very short time -- less than one month -- to analyze party 
accounts before the elected officials take over their posts.

  [Text] The Congressional Joint Committee approved the 
provisional measure for the economic plan. An index to calculate 
inflation in the new currency, the real, also was created. The 
rapporteur read his report, the government agreed with it, and 
the opposition protested. 
  The final report suggests 59 changes to the economic 
stabilization plan but it did not touch the essential: The 
minimum salary will stay as it is for the time being. In 30 
days, the government will send Congress a proposal to gradually 
increase the minimum salary. Salaries in URV's [real value 
units] also will stay as they are for the time being. If after 
four months of conversion, that is; in July, workers conclude 
that they would have earned more under the former salary policy, 
the government will pay for the salary losses on the base date 
of collective labor contracts. 
  When the new currency is put into circulation, salaries will 
have additional protection. The Congressional Joint Committee 
report creates an index to calculate inflation in the real 
currency: The IPCR [Consumer Price Index in Real]. If this index 
indicates inflation in the new currency, it will be incorporated 
into salaries on the base date of each labor category. 
  The report was approved eight votes against one, despite the 
harsh reaction of the only congressman who voted against it. The 
provisional measure nonetheless still must be voted on by the 
Congress plenary before 28 April. 
  [Begin Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero recording] We 
believe 
this demonstrates very well that it is being understood that the 
stabilization is for the benefit of the country and all the 
Brazilian people. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Address to the nation by Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero </F>
from his office in Brasilia; date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] Good evening. You, Brazilian workers in any 
position or activity, have just received your first salary in 
URV's [real value units]. In practice it is the first time we 
have felt the effect of the stabilization program in the 
workers' incomes. I know, however, that people still have many 
doubts, as a lot was said about alleged salary losses as a 
consequence of the conversion of salaries into URV's. The 
truth, however, is that no one has been able to demonstrate that 
these losses have in fact taken place. On the contrary, in some 
cases there have been salary gains. This is why I agreed with 
President Itamar Franco that tonight I would address the nation 
to explain the economic plan a little bit more. 
  For us workers, for most of us who receive a salary with 
which to face family expenses, the economic program yields many 
advantages. To receive a salary in URV's is to receive a salary 
corrected daily according to inflation. Contrary to other 
plans, our program began with the protection of salaries. 
Housewives who go to the supermarket know better than anyone 
else that salaries always lagged behind prices. No matter how 
many salary increases or salary readjustment triggers were 
applied, they never served to protect salaries. 
  This time it is different. With the URV salaries will run 
hand in hand with the prices in real cruzeiros, at the same 
speed. In addition, at this stage industrialists and 
businessmen, along with the government, are converting 
contracts, prices, and utility rates into URV's. 
  Well then, you may now ask yourselves: And the prices in 
real cruzeiros? Don't they continue increasing every single 
day? It is true, as I said before, that at this stage prices in 
real cruzeiros continue to increase while salaries lag behind. 
We need to stop this price stampede, because only a few 
privileged people obtain gains with it. At present salaries are 
already in URV's, and the prices that have already been 
converted into URV's are ceasing to increase. Why? Because 
whoever signs a contract in URV's stops readjusting prices. 
Thus, the price of things remain the same. 
  The government remains alert, as with beer and medicines. 
With the April salary you will be able to buy the same things 
you bought with the salary of March, the first one that was 
corrected. Today many products and services have two prices: 
one in real cruzeiros, which continues to be readjusted, and 
another in URV's, which remains stable and is also the measure 
of the value of your salary. The result is that commerce has 
increased its sales and people can buy goods in URV's with 
credits, without inflation, and without black market quotations. 
  Soon, given that salaries and prices will both be expressed 
in URV's, prices in real cruzeiros will no longer mean anything. 
Soon we will arrive at the much expected moment. Instead of 
only changing the name of the currency we will change the 
currency itself. But this will take place when the URV complies 
with its other role, which is to give producers and businessmen 
the conditions to foresee their costs and thus stabilize prices. 
  The new currency will come when the URV finishes its work. 
Only then will the new real come into circulation, substituting 
for the URV, ending the real cruzeiro, and it will be the new 
currency of a Brazil without inflation. It will be a strong 
currency, like that of the developed countries; a currency that 
is valuable because inflation will be low, the economy will 
work, and salaries will have purchasing power. 
  We are making these changes without surprises, frights, 
without hurriedness, carefully discussing each of the next steps 
of the program. We will announce the implementation of the real 
at least 35 days before it is put into circulation. We now have 
a great chance, perhaps a unique chance to end an inflation that 
is destroying Brazil. We have begun by putting the house in 
order, balancing the government accounts, cutting expenses, and 
chasing tax evaders to increase tax collection. 
  We would all like to have a higher minimum salary and see 
all 
salaries raised. But let us be honest -- right now that kind 
of increase would be unrealistic, because it would further fuel 
inflation. 
  Furthermore, it would bring a serious imbalance to the 
government's budget. Just to give you an idea, an increase in 
the minimum salary may ultimately cause the social security 
system, and many state and city governments, to go bankrupt. 
The Itamar Franco administration has never thought that it 
could save the nation without the support of each Brazilian 
citizen; that is, without the help of workers, businessmen, 
housewives, students, and political leaders. We must all 
shoulder this responsibility. 
  I once again appeal to political leaders, to all candidates, 
to the members of Congress, and to the judicial branch about the 
need for them to understand the stabilization program. Please 
give this program a chance. Those economic packages that had 
instituted shock treatments, price and salary freezes, bank 
holidays, and even confiscation of savings were all approved by 
Congress, which gave these programs the chance to be put to the 
test. 
  It would be an enormous injustice if the first truly 
democratic economic plan -- which does not contain either shock 
treatments, surprises, or any form of violence -- should be 
denied the same vote of confidence. 
  Congress -- which is sensitive to the feelings, anxieties 
and 
hopes of the Brazilian people -- knows that it should pave the 
way for the implementation of a program that meets every 
condition required to be successful. This program does, 
however, need a chance to prove itself. Let us not deceive 
ourselves or the public. Without economic stability, we will not 
be able to increase salaries, correct injustices, or enable the 
government to discharge its duties concerning health, education, 
public security, and retirees. 
  This is the first time that a government, instead of 
spending 
more in an election year, is proposing a plan that reduces its 
own expenditures so that the next government, irrespective of 
who forms it, may inherit a sound economy. 
  All of those who are seeking to rule the nation beginning 
next year should understand that they will be unable to keep 
their promises if they assume a government that is undergoing an 
economic crisis with a high inflation rate, a government which 
would thus be rendered incapable of discharging its most basic 
duties. 
  The Brazilian people will not tolerate it if selfish 
interests prevent the implementation of the economic program in 
the coming decisive weeks. The fact of the matter is that we 
all know that. It is in the best interests of Brazilian voters 
to put an end to inflation, and not in hearing once again 
promises that will not bring solutions to the country's 
problems. And the worst socioeconomic problem in Brazil today 
is inflation. This is our main challenge, the target of our 
struggle. With the help of God and of all Brazilians, we will 
achieve our goal to build a better, more just country where 
there is no inflation, and where money and salaries may reward 
the efforts of the working class. Thank you and good night.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities monitored through 14 April: 
  The Economic Research Institute Foundation, Fipe, has stated 
that the March Consumer Price Index, IPC, totalled 41.9 percent, 
almost 4 percent up on February. The Brazilian Institute of 
Geography and Statistics for the same period, however, showed 
the IPC totalled 42.7 percent, some 1.76 percent down on 
February. (Sao Paulo O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO in Portuguese 8 Apr 
94 p B3) 
  It has been reported that the British businessmen 
accompanying Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd on his visit to 
Brazil have meet with National Iron and Steel Company, CSN, 
board members because they want to participate in the company's 
investment plan. The 6-year CSN plan contemplates investments 
totalling $950 million, $180 million of which have to be made in 
1994. These resources will be used to reduce industrial costs, 
improve quality and productivity, and implement environmental 
control measures. (Sao Paulo GAZETA MERCANTIL in Portuguese 7 
Apr 94 p 5) 
  A drop in the net amount of dollars entering the country in 
March caused the Brazilian exchange balance to drop to $1.7 
billion. This is the lowest since September, when it fell to 
$380 billion. Since October, the balance has been surpassing 
$2.5 billion. This is not bad news to the Central Bank which 
has already been controlling the entry of dollars into the 
country to control inflation. (Sao Paulo FOLHA DE SAO PAULO in 
Portuguese 8 Apr 94 Section 2 p 1) 
  The number of construction companies that have gone bankrupt 
in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo in March increased by 43.4 
percent. In November 34 companies went bankrupt, this dropped 
to 22 in December, to 18 in January, and then rose to 23 in 
February. (Sao Paulo GAZETA MERCANTIL in Portuguese 8 Apr 94 p 
31) 
  The Goods and Services Movement Tax collection in Sao Paulo 
in March rose by 11.2 percent and totalled $701.5 million. 
Between January and March the Sao Paulo treasury collected 
$1.904 billion in taxes. (Sao Paulo GAZETA MERCANTIL in 
Portuguese 8 Apr 94 p 3) 
  Brazilian exports in January and February decreased from 
$3.1 
billion and $3.5 billion, respectively, during the same period 
in 1993 to $2.75 billion and $2.78 billion, respectively. Semi- 
manufactured product exports in February dropped by 24.81 
percent and shoe exports by 1.17 percent, although coffee 
exports increased by 78.91 percent and orange juice by 65.78 
percent. In the same month, Brazil exported $616.22 million to 
the United States, still its largest trade partner, and $280.2 
to Argentina its second largest trade partner. (Sao Paulo GAZETA 
MERCANTIL in Portuguese 8 Apr 94 p 5) 
  The Brazilian agro-industry grew 2.1 percent in 1993. The 
largest growth was registered in Rio Grande do Sul State, 6.6 
percent, followed by Sao Paulo, 6.5 percent. This positive 
performance is a result of a 3-percent increase in agricultural 
production; soy bean byproducts increased by 4.9 percent; coffee 
byproducts by 7.6 percent; orange byproducts by 19.6 percent; 
and grape byproducts by 19.5 percent. Cacao-bean, wheat, and 
sugar cane production, however, decreased, as did cattle raising 
activities, which dropped by 3.2 percent. (Sao Paulo GAZETA 
MERCANTIL in Portuguese 8 Apr 94 p 17) 
  Brazilian car-manufacturers produced in March the largest 
number of cars in the sector's history. Although the 
car-manufacturing sector had planned to manufacture 1.5 million 
cars by 1995, the number of cars manufactured in the last 12 
months already totals 1,481,000. Another record refers to car 
sales in the domestic market in March when 113,517 cars were 
sold. In 1993, 23 percent of the cars manufactured in the 
country were exported. From January to March this number 
increased by 29.8 percent and 79,711 cars have already been 
exported, 70 percent of them to Argentina. Tractors and 
agricultural equipment manufacture increased by 57 percent from 
January to March and 70.4 percent more of these were sold on the 
domestic market. (Sao Paulo O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO in Portuguese 
8 Apr 94 p B8) 
  The February unemployment rate totalled 5.37 percent. 
Compared to January, the rate decreased by 0.17 percent. 
(Brasilia Voz do Brasil Network in Portuguese 2200 GMT 8 Apr 94) 
  The Getulio Vargas Foundation has reported that the General 
Price Index increased by 44.8 percent in March. The accumulated 
increases since January total 173.8 percent and the increase 
accumulated in the last 12 months totals 3,421 percent. A poll 
by the Interunion Department for Statistics and Socioeconomic 
Studies on the price of basic foodstuff indicates that in March 
these prices increased above the Real Value Unit, URV, in 14 
state capitals. (Sao Paulo O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO in Portuguese 8 
Apr 94 p 3) 
  It has been reported that foreign investments on the Sao 
Paulo stock market dropped in March from the 22 percent 
registered in February -- when share movements totalled 
$95,410,000 -- to 20.6 percent. The movement in March totalled 
$62,100,000 million. (Sao Paulo GAZETA MERCANTIL in Portuguese 8 
Apr 94 p 20) 
  The Sao Paulo Gas Company has reported that natural gas 
consumption in Sao Paulo State during the months of January and 
February increased by 24.6 percent compared to the same period 
in 1993 in view of the increasing number of industrial 
consumers. (Sao Paulo GAZETA MERCANTIL in Portuguese 9 Apr 94 p 
18) 
  It has been reported that fuel prices will rise 18.47 
percent 
countrywide at midnight on 12 April. One liter of gasoline will 
now cost 594,00 real cruzeiros. (Sao Paulo O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO 
in Portuguese 12 Apr 94 p B1) 
  Some of the main national banks will begin to convert a 
larger number of their operations into URV on 12 April. 
Interest rates on those operations will range from 2 percent to 
5 percent over the URV variations. (Sao Paulo O ESTADO DE SAO 
PAULO in Portuguese 12 Apr 94 pp A1, B1)

<F P=106> [Interview with Strategic Affairs Secretary Mario Cesar </F>
Flores by correspondent Eliana Simonetti at the old National 
Intelligence Service, SNI, office in Sao Paulo; date not given] 
  [Text] [Simonetti] Why are the military so sensitive over 
their salaries, as we could see during the crisis over the last 
few days? 
  [Flores] Since the Constitution was promulgated in 1988 
there 
has been a process of dissatisfaction going on. At the time of 
the promulgation, the judicial and legislative branches adjusted 
their salaries high above those of the executive branch. Since 
then the difference has been increasing as a result of 
mini-adjustments and bonuses. It is not reasonable to see a 
four-star general receive a salary that is half the amount 
received by a congressional adviser, particularly as they are 
both paid by the same Treasury, i.e., by the taxes collected 
from the same persons. 
  [Simonetti] Why is this dissatisfaction more evident among 
the military? 
  [Flores] The civilian public employees' unions try to make 
themselves heard through inexpressive demonstrations staged at 
the Tres Poderes Square and at the Candelaria Square in Rio de 
Janeiro, and these demonstrations are quite disagreeable to the 
public in general. They also try to make themselves heard 
through strikes, which are normally unsuccessful. They have no 
power. The Armed Forces, however, draw the public's attention 
because of their hierarchical organization and by the impact of 
the traditional military presence in Brazilian politics. 
  [Simonetti] But are salaries the only problem? 
  [Flores] No. The federal government practically went 
bankrupt after 1988. We cannot build highways or ports, and we 
have no funds to make the public health system function. For 
the Armed Forces, the consequences of this bankruptcy are 
translated into excessive slowness in equipping and training the 
contingents. Only 2.5 percent of the 1993 national budget was 
allocated to the three branches of the Armed Forces. This 2.5 
percent represented less than 0.5 percent of the gross domestic 
product. From an international point of view this is an 
extremely low figure -- particularly if we consider that with 
these funds we have to maintain a structure that has more than 
300,000 men. From the professional point of view, all these 
people are living beyond their means. Nowadays the number of 
people choosing the Armed Forces as a professional alternative 
is decreasing. The middle class, which has always been the 
greatest source of military officers, has ceased to be so. 
  [Simonetti] Couldn't the professionalization of the Armed 
Forces be a solution? 
  [Flores] There is a justifiable controversy between 
compulsory military service and a professional Armed Forces in 
Brazil and in other countries. As the Armed Forces become 
technically more complex, soldiers and officers must be better 
trained. This is more difficult with the compulsory military 
service. Brazil has a low educational level, and the compulsory 
military service brings that low level into the barracks. The 
Armed Forces are becoming more professional all over the world. 
This is also happening in Brazil. Yet I believe it would be 
premature to eliminate the compulsory military service. It is 
better to keep it within the legal structure and to gradually 
reduce the number of recruits, simultaneously increasing the 
number of those who voluntarily join it. 
  [Simonetti] How is it possible to solve this increasingly 
generalized deterioration of public service which has affected 
the military and health sectors and the bureaucracy? 
  [Flores] The situation has become so serious that it is 
already affecting the country. Public services do not meet 
national needs. Fixing things will take time. We will first 
have to encourage qualified people to join and stay within the 
public sector. This can be accomplished only through 
appropriate salaries and conditions for productive and for 
professionally and operationally rewarding work. The solution 
calls for a restoration of the Union's financial health, and 
this depends on the reform of the Constitution. I don't believe 
it will be possible to restore good quality public service, like 
the one we had in the past, in less than five to 10 years. Yet 
we have to do something. 
  [Simonetti] Is money the only solution? 
  [Flores] No. It is also necessary to review the single legal 
system law. This law has increased the existing degradation, 
because public servants stopped being encouraged. All of them 
now have full retirement, job stability, and social benefits. 
This law, like the Constitution, is a set of benefits with just 
a few obligations. 
  [Simonetti] You don't speak the way military men usually 
speak. What do you think of the privatization of state 
enterprises? 
  [Flores] Many military men agree with me. My generation came 
after the generation of military men who radically support 
nationalization. That generation was in command in the sixties 
and seventies. I am for privatization. For example, I do not 
agree that the oil sector should be untouchable. It is the 
Union's monopoly -- not an enterprise's monopoly -- which has to 
be maintained. The gas pipeline from Bolivia to Sao Paulo 
proves that we have to introduce changes. It is obvious that 
Petrobras [Brazilian Petroleum Corporation] does not have the 
funds to finance the project. Neither does the Union. The gas 
pipeline depends on the private sector's money, and the World 
Bank will cooperate only if the project is under private sector 
control. And why shouldn't it be under private control? The 
same reasoning applies to the telecommunications and nuclear 
sectors. 
  [Simonetti] Do you think the private sector should also 
exploit the nuclear field? 
  [Flores] I think the government should exert a direct 
monopoly over the fuel cycle linked with nuclear weapons. But 
why not allow private companies to exploit the mineral and 
enrich it, under government franchise? There is nothing wrong 
with that. 
  [Simonetti] Don't you think that national security could be 
placed at a risk? 
  [Flores] No. What places national security at risk is 
inefficiency, not privatization. That is very clear in the area 
of ports. Those who want to maintain the ports under state 
control allege that they are important for national security. 
But national security is not at risk when a port is private and 
efficient. It is at risk when the port is inefficient. 
  [Simonetti] Congress is controlled by corporations like 
Petrobras [Brazilian Petroleum Corporation], Telebras [Brazilian 
Telecommunications, Inc.], and others. How can changes be 
implemented to solve these problems? 
  [Flores] The influence of these corporations exists. The 
corporations exert pressure on the national Congress. But there 
are people in Congress with different ideas, and some studies 
demonstrate that many congressmen favor the current 
constitutional revision. Many of them, perhaps most of them, 
favor maintaining the state, and not Petrobras, monopoly on oil. 
I think it is possible to make changes. We must not confuse 
the number of voters with the noises made by corporations that 
have a great capacity for shouting. It is funny to observe that 
nowadays, the political circles that opposed the military regime 
now defend the work done by the military regime and the state 
companies. They are political circles well represented in the 
PDT [Democratic Labor Party], the PC do B [Communist Party of 
Brazil], and part of the PT [Workers Party]. 
  [Simonetti] They won all that in the 1988 Constitution. 
  [Flores] In 1988 the labor unions were very strong, in 
reaction to the previous regime, when they were very much 
controlled. That was reflected faithfully in the Constituent 
Assembly, when the cold war atmosphere still prevailed and 
ideologies were still important. Today it is only those who 
don't want to who can't see that the world economy is becoming 
global. Either we join the trend and build a competitive 
economy in global terms, or we remain behind. Those who will pay 
the price of our backwardness will be our people, who will 
remain poor. 
  [Simonetti] Do you consider the constitutional revision a 
strategic matter? 
  [Flores] Yes. The revision is essential to allow Brazil to 
overcome its difficulties, to make progress and give the people 
a better standard of living. If the issues that are essential 
for helping the country are not revised we will continue to be 
stuck in the same place; we will continue to lag behind the rest 
of the world, with a poor people depending on welfare programs. 
That is not good for a country with 150 million inhabitants. I 
do not want to think what could happen tomorrow, or the day 
after tomorrow, but some day the problem will explode. It is 
better to straighten out the legal, economic, and social issues 
now than in the future through a social explosion. 
  [Simonetti] What about the Calha Norte project? 
  [Flores] This project will increase the state presence in 
the 
northern border area. That presence includes not only the Armed 
Forces, but also the Federal Police, Ibama [Brazilian Institute 
for the Environment], Funai [National Indian Foundation], the 
Revenue Office, health facilities, and others. A border post 
has a landing strip, an Army unit, a health unit for the local 
inhabitants, a Funai post, and so on. 
  [Simonetti] And what about the Amazon Surveillance System? 
  [Flores] There is a concealed accusation that it is a 
military project, but that is the least of what it is. It is a 
modern, high technology project to control and administer the 
region. It will allow the control of natural resources and of 
invasions of Indian reserves. It will also serve to repress 
smuggling and drug trafficking. 
  [Simonetti] In your opinion, is Brazil a vulnerable country? 
  [Flores] The Amazon region is vulnerable. Not so much from 
the point of view of a military threat, which is not probable, 
but from the point of view of illegal activities. The Amazon 
region represents a vacuum of power, of human presence, a 
disorder that must come under control. We are heading toward a 
new world in which borders are losing their traditional values. 
In order to control the Amazon region, Brazil must learn to use 
it. To use it implies controlling it. The most spoken about 
part of this project is the control of the air space, and there 
is a justification for this: In the Amazon, crime flies. 
Without control of the air space there is no way to control the 
Amazon region. Even the environmental matter depends on this. 
  [Simonetti] How is the Information Service doing now? 
  [Flores] The information service, today called intelligence, 
is being restructured without the vices that harmed the SNI. 
The information service is necessary; all organized countries 
have one. Ours, which was created in 1964 during the Castello 
Branco administration, began well, but with time its functions 
began to be distorted. There are many examples of this 
distortion, such as the interference in Serra Pelada [gold 
mine], which reached the point of being administered by Colonel 
Curio, a SNI officer. This kind of thing should no longer take 
place. 
  [Simonetti] How should an intelligence service operate? 
  [Flores] The intelligence service should be limited to 
gathering, analyzing, and disseminating information. It should 
not operate unless it does so for the purpose of gathering 
information. For example, when there is a meeting it is 
necessary to send intelligence personnel to see what is 
happening. This is absolutely legal. The service is being 
restructured to give the state a safe, modern intelligence 
service. Part of the work by the intelligence service is 
obviously secret. No intelligence agent -- anywhere in the 
world -- wears an identification card. There must be some 
secrecy in his work, but it should not be dubiously legal. 
  [Simonetti] The way your are speaking -- you are using the 
future tense -- it seems that the intelligence service is not 
operating now. 
  [Flores] It is working. It is working well. Almost every 
day I receive reports confirming facts, analyses of what is 
happening, and the press' and people's reaction to developments. 
We send our people to the meetings in which entrepreneurial 
organizations analyze the economic plan. There is nothing wrong 
with that. It is natural to do something like that. 
Information is then gathered, and we analyze it. We have 
competent analysts. 
  [Simonetti] Are they ex-SNI personnel? 
  [Flores] The majority of the analysts are. The operational 
area was heavily reduced in the fields that could be mistaken 
for police activity. In 1990, when former President Fernando 
Collor took power, the SNI had some 3,500 employees. Today the 
Intelligence Undersecretariat has 1,200 employees, all over 
Brazil. 
  [Simonetti] Are there agents outside Brazil? 
  [Flores] No. There were, in the past, but not now. 
  [Simonetti] What do you think of the creation of a ministry 
of defense, headed by a civilian minister? 
  [Flores] I believe that sooner or later there will be a 
ministry of defense, as most countries around the world with 
well-structured armed forces do have defense ministries. It is 
a matter of time; there is no rush. It is necessary to make a 
plan, as it is not simply a matter of saying that there is a 
ministry that is common to the three forces, but to achieve 
integration among the three forces. 
  [Simonetti] Isn't the presence of military men in political 
posts today a source of further complication for the country? 
  [Flores] I see no complication. Over the past 10 years, 
military ministers have carefully avoided meddling in political 
affairs. They are not a factor of complication for the 
political situation. 
  [Simonetti] Are conditions ripe for a coup today? Are there 
sectors that would like a coup? 
  [Flores] I am not aware of any. A coup is not carried out 
just because someone wants it. There must be a breeding ground 
for a coup, and there is no breeding ground in Brazil. The 
coups that had serious repercussions occurred under very special 
circumstances, which do not prevail now. For example, in 1964 
there was a cold war atmosphere in which national security 
played a very important role. There was the problem of the 
masses joining the national political life, and this shocked the 
foundations of Brazilian tradition. There were also hierarchy 
and discipline violations within the Armed Forces. Furthermore, 
we should recall that people were on the streets, demanding a 
break, and this is not happening today. 
  [Simonetti] Will we have elections this year? 
  [Flores] Yes, beyond all doubt. Brazil assimilates, digests, 
and resolves its problems. 
  [Simonetti] Why did you stay in the government after the 
fall 
of President Collor? 
  [Flores] Ask President Itamar Franco. I am a servant of the 
state, and while I am healthy I will try to do a good job. Who 
the president might be is not very relevant to me.

<F P=106> [Editorial from the "Notes and Information" page: "Imposed </F>
`Options'"] 
  [Text] With an already definite initial 1 million-copy 
edition, the Catholic Church of Brazil intends to publish a 
leaflet to teach Brazilians how to vote. This is an old custom; 
a lot of religious and non-religious people have done this. But 
we must recognize that such an "obligation" has become an 
obsession among a group of Brazilian prelates. In every 
election, always at the last CNBB [National Conference of 
Brazilian Bishops] meeting before an election, some kind of 
document defining how Catholics must vote is submitted to the 
bishops conference. In the past few years the tone has always 
been more or less the same -- at least since the PT [Workers 
Party] appeared on the national political scene. This election 
year, The Responsible Vote does not conceal its position. The 
religious men who sign it define themselves politically. 
  The document distinguishes three threats to the informed 
vote: the resistance to voting, the lack of knowledge of what is 
at stake in the elections, and the lack of information about the 
elections. The latter subject is blamed by the voting 
instructors on the pernicious role played by the media, which 
"nearly totally" responds "to the interests of the major 
economic groups." Given that Brazilian voters cannot perceive 
what is correct without the help of these progressive clergymen, 
they have barely three options: the "neoliberal" choice, which 
represents the peak of submission of the sinners to Satan -- 
given that this option meets the "recommendations of the IMF and 
the World Bank" -- and preaches a considerable increase in the 
role of the market; then comes the "organized capitalism" option 
that attempts to "solve the crisis" through the reorganization 
of the economy and the state (is this a crime?). This threat is 
equally sinful because it seeks to promote a "swift 
incorporation of the Brazilian economy into the international 
market." And finally, the redeeming proposal, the "people's 
democracy proposal," which is the only one that seeks "to resume 
development by redistributing wealth and meeting the needs of 
the people." 
  Only one political party fulfills the yearnings of the 
national progressive prelates. As Bishop Demetrio Valentino, 
coordinator of the CNBB Social Pastoral and one of those 
responsible for the document, said: Political action is not "a 
mere option, but an obligation" for Christians. He added that 
through political action "men and women" transform society. 
However, serious problems can result from supporting this party 
because the PT does not divide humankind into two genders. Under 
the light of the Social Pastoral, can the third gender, which 
also is accepted by the PT, transform society? 
  In this document -- which is plagued with commonplace ideas 
(such as "we should not be deceived by speeches" and "several 
candidates who make believe they are good and respectful persons 
only want to fool the people") -- it is stated that our 
participation in the electoral process is not a matter of choice 
"but a matter of faith." Could it be that Pope Johan Paul II 
lends the word this meaning? Can "faith" depend on party 
obligations?

  [Text] With 297 votes in favor and 116 against, the Chamber 
of Deputies on 13 April stripped Deputy Carlos Benevides 
(PMDB-CE) [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party-Ceara] of his 
political rights. In the morning, with 346 votes in favor and 42 
votes against, alternate Deputy Feres Nader (PTB-RJ) [Brazilian 
Labor Party-Rio de Janeiro] also was stripped of his political 
rights. He cannot become a deputy nor run in the next elections. 
Benevides and Nader were both involved in the budget scandal. 
  President Itamar Franco on 13 April sanctioned a law 
approved 
by the Senate that increases from three to eight years the term 
during which members of Congress are deprived of their political 
rights when found guilty of a lack of decorum.

  [Text] Brasilia, 13 Apr (EFE) -- The Planalto Palace Press 
Office reported that Brazilian President Itamar Franco today 
appointed journalist Fernando Jose da Costa as the new 
presidential spokesman, replacing Francisco Baker. 
  Da Costa is a 58-year-old employee of the state-owned radio 
and television network Radiobras [Brazilian Radio Broadcasting 
Company]. He has served as deputy to Baker for the past 18 
months since Franco's inauguration. 
  Baker resigned as Franco's spokesman last month to take a 
top 
position in communications at the IMF in Washington.

<F P=106> [Article by Heloisa Magalhaes] </F>
  [Text] In order to facilitate the installation of fiber 
optics cables in downtown Rio de Janeiro, Embratel [Brazilian 
Telecommunications Company] will use the ducts of the 
underground electric power network of the Light Company. There 
are 21.88 km of links making up the national fiber optics 
network, which Embratel is installing to interconnect the main 
Brazilian capitals. 
  This kind of installation will prevent not only the problems 
caused by work in very busy areas like downtown Rio de Janeiro, 
but will also reduce the cost of installing the fiber optics 
links, Embratel has reported. The cables will supplement the 
distribution work that the Rio de Janeiro Telephone Company 
(Telerj) is doing with the national network. 
  According to Embratel President Renato Archer, Eletrosul 
[Southern Electric Power Plants] electric power towers are being 
used for the Florianopolis-Curitiba-Porto Alegre connection. 
The interconnection with Curitiba and Sao Paulo follows the 
railway network. The work toward awarding the contracts for the 
work in these two cities is in its final stage. The connection 
between Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo is ready. It has operated 
since August 1993, following the Via Dutra highway. Through 
this connection it will be possible to gradually increase the 
capacity for simultaneous phone calls between the two cities to 
123,000, whereas today that capacity lies at 39,000. 
  Archer added that a "fiber optics triangle" joining Rio de 
Janeiro, Sao Paulo, and Belo Horizonte is about to be completed. 
"This triangle is larger than the entire Spanish fiber optics 
network," he said. He expects that by the end of the year the 
contracts for all the connections to the northeastern region 
will already have been awarded, taking cables from Rio de 
Janeiro to Fortaleza. In the area between Salvador and 
Fortaleza the electric power network will be used for the 
cables, thanks to an agreement with CHESF [Sao Francisco 
Hydroelectric Company]. 
  According to Embratel reports, the use of electric power 
company ducts permits a substantial reduction of the cost of 
installing the national network, which provides for investments 
of up to $1.5 billion until 1996. The network reaches Europe 
through the Columbus underwater cable, which is being installed. 
Connection with the United States will be done through the 
Americas II system, while Mercosur [Common Market of the South] 
countries will be connected with Brazil and with the northern 
hemisphere through the Unisur cable.

the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of GATT talks. After seven 
years of negotiations, new rules have been established to govern 
world trade. The agreement sets up rules for establishing 
tariffs, financial services, and the overall trade spectrum that 
range from agriculture to intellectual property. 
  Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim, who is in 
Marrakesh, 
said the agreement will result in an average reduction of 40 
percent in the tariffs of developed countries. In his opinion, 
the agreement will benefit Brazilian exports. The agreement 
also will benefit areas that had been outside the GATT 
framework, such as agriculture and textiles. 
  [Begin Amorim recording] In the case of agriculture, this 
agreement will be very important for Brazil because our exports 
of some agricultural products and even agroindustrial products 
such as soybean, oil soybean, and chicken were competing with 
subsidized products that came primarily from the EC and the 
United States. Subsidies will not be eliminated, but instead of 
continuing to grow, this trend will now be reversed and 
subsidies will have to decline. [end recording] 
  Amorim noted that the World Trade Organization, which will 
be 
created by the GATT member countries, will be charged with 
supervising the agreement. 
  Today Amorim addressed the GATT general assembly and 
emphasized the agreement's positive aspects and Brazil's hope 
that developed countries would discontinue protectionist and 
arbitrary measures.

<F P=106> [From the "Notes and Information" page: "Incomplete Agenda"] </F>
  [Text] The article in which Foreign Minister Celso Amorim 
outlined some features of Brazilian foreign policy, which O 
ESTADO published on 10 April, is important both because of what 
it says and because of what it does not say. It is such an 
exaggerated expression of support for multilateral action that 
to less alert readers it can give the impression that foreign 
policy and international law are exact synonyms, and that the 
only solution for any country, especially Brazil, can be found 
in international organizations. Minister Celso Amorim, who 
completed the brightest part of his career in multilateral 
discussions before becoming foreign minister, is aware however 
that a consistent foreign policy cannot do without the rude 
power balance contingencies stemming from bilateral relations. 
In his article, Amorim has precisely failed to describe the 
objectives and strategies orienting external action to countries 
like the United States, which are so relevant for Brazil. 
  It should be noted that since Celso Amorim has headed 
Itamaraty, Brazil has been relieved of part of the burden of its 
conflicts with industrialized countries. Next to Amorim's 
article, we published on 10 April an article by our Washington 
correspondent reporting a change in the attitude toward Brazil 
from some of the most influential U.S. policy makers [two 
preceding words in English]. They are people who were removed 
from their universe of reflection that fed on negative, mistaken 
perceptions of Brazil, perceptions that concealed the efforts 
Brazil has made over the past three years to modernize itself 
and to adapt itself to the new situation in international 
commerce. Part of this change in perception was caused by the 
weight of facts. But part of it also was caused by a systematic 
effort by Itamaraty to show in the big capitals of the world 
that the dynamics of Brazilian society and the Brazilian economy 
are leading the country along the path followed by 
industrialized nations. There are, of course, differences in 
speed and rate, but not of the goal. 
  It should be noticed, however, that the assistant secretary 
of state for Latin American affairs and the under secretary of 
commerce for international affairs [titles as published] -- as 
well as other people in the U.S. Government or outside it -- did 
not realize the changes that occurred in Brazil thanks to the 
country's presence at multilateral forums. An essential factor 
for them to realize that something positive was happening here 
was the resolution and settlement of matters dealing with 
bilateral conflicts that, because of today's interdependence, 
have affected relations between Brazil and other countries that 
share some of the principles upheld by the United States. In 
this way, the tension in Brazilian-U.S. relations dropped 
considerably after the Brazilian Congress approved the 
quadripartite nuclear safeguard agreement, an action that also 
permitted our relations with Germany to reach -- or return to -- 
a higher level. Likewise, the annoying question of the foreign 
debt was not blessed by the multilateral IMF; instead, the 
agreement with creditor banks moved forward thanks to the U.S. 
Treasury's support. 
  Brazil has good reasons to seek the protection of 
international organizations. A big country, yet unwilling to 
project its own power far beyond its borders, those in charge of 
Brazilian diplomacy prefer the legal protection granted by 
multilateral forums. This formula yielded results for some time, 
and it is still yielding good results in specific conditions. 
The problem is that Brazilian interests are becoming excessively 
complex to be handled exclusively with the consensus method of 
international bodies. For a country demanding rapid and original 
solutions, such organizations can delay the answers too long, 
and, since their answers are based on consensus, they will not 
fully take national interests into account. From this viewpoint, 
multilateral organizations entail "compulsory support," with 
which it is better to do away. Therefore, many multilateral 
organizations administer justice in business and politics 
because those organizations will always give mankind a basis for 
moving toward utopia. But many efforts also concentrate on the 
fast resolution of problems that affect our everyday life and 
that can be resolved only through direct dialogue between two 
sides. 
  Itamaraty has properly given priority to the new action 
aiming at promoting economic and political cooperation and 
integration in South America. New actions should preferably 
concentrate on our neighboring areas. It is important, however, 
that the search for new courses not erase old trails. Brazil's 
future will certainly depend on South American integration. But 
it is also true that the present is the platform of the future, 
and the present is linked to the United States and other 
industrialized nations.

  [Text] Alcantara -- The PT [Workers Party] government will 
give priority to programs like that of the Alcantara Rocket 
Launch Center. This is what PT candidate Luiz Inacio Lula da 
Silva said on 13 April to Aviation Colonel Jose Celso Lauande, 
the center's commander, who met Lula to show him the way the 
project is operating. The project has been fully developed with 
Brazilian technology. 
  Lula, who started another stage of his Caravan of the 
Citizenry in Maranhao, carefully listened to Lauande's briefing. 
To help him ask the colonel questions, Lula was accompanied by 
Reserve Colonel Geraldo Cavagnari, who helped the PT design its 
program for strategic areas and advanced technology. The PT 
candidate showed his indignation at the fact that the center 
needs $40 million to operate at full capacity. Of the center's 
total cost of $260 million, $117 million remains to be provided, 
for which reason the space program has been considerably delayed.

  [Excerpt] Brasilia -- Former Finance Minister Fernando 
Henrique Cardoso has practically secured the support of the main 
PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] dissidents for his 
presidential candidacy. In a secret political negotiation, in 
which President Itamar Franco himself participated, Cardoso 
obtained the support of the so-called Rio Grande do Sul group, 
which is led by Senator Pedro Simon. This group is against the 
alliance between the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] and 
the PFL [Liberal Front Party]. 
  Cardoso also obtained a promise from ex-President Jose 
Sarney 
to support his candidacy as soon as the internal PMDB elections 
reveal stronger support for ex-Governor Orestes Quercia. Recife 
Mayor Jarbas Vasconcellos and some PMDB candidates to state 
governorships will work for Cardoso's candidacy after the PMDB 
internal elections. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Army General Raul Castro has warned that if the 
United States unleashes a war against Cuba, no matter under what 
pretext, Cuba would wage a no-holds barred fight against the 
enemy in every corner of the nation where they may be. The 
Guantanamo Naval Base would, of course, be no exception, because 
in the region surrounding it, we have everything necessary to 
neutralize that U.S. enclave. Raul added that in that case, and 
as long as the aggression does not originate from that base and 
the lapsed time is not used to reinforce the base, Cuba is 
willing to allow the time necessary to evacuate civilians from 
the base, primarily the spouses and children of the personnel of 
the U.S. naval base. 
  In the ceremony held in Guantanamo to observe Militiamen's 
Day and the 33d anniversary of the proclamation of the socialist 
nature of the Revolution, Raul stressed that our historic legacy 
is to fight fiercely for the independence of the fatherland, 
under highly disadvantageous conditions, against the enemy; to 
take their weapons; respect prisoners of war; and help injured 
prisoners. After stressing that our people feel admiration and 
gratitude toward their brave sons, the members of the border 
guard troops unit, Raul pointed out that the Revolutionary Armed 
Forces are proud of the courage, dedication, and discipline of 
this unit deployed on the front line.

  [Text] DPRK President Kim Il-song has stressed that the 
DPRK has neither the intent nor the capacity to produce nuclear 
arms. That would make no sense, he said, adding that the United 
States is mistaken in thinking that pressure and intimidation 
can bring the DPRK to its knees. 
  This statement was made by Kim Il-song in the course of an 
exclusive PRENSA LATINA interview at the Presidential Palace. 
During the two-hour interview, Kim Il-song addressed the current 
tense situation being experienced by the DPRK, relations with 
the PRC and other countries, foreign investment, and the outlook 
for reunification of the Korean peninsula. 
  Kim Il-song also praised the DPRK's ties with Cuba and 
President Fidel Castro. In a measured and firm voice, Kim 
Il-song stressed that his government is committed to turning the 
Korean peninsula into a nuclear-free zone.

  [Text] Colombian Deputy Foreign Minister Andelfo Garcia, 
who is heading the Colombian delegation to the joint 
Cuban-Colombian commission, has stated that diplomatic relations 
between Cuba and Colombia have been reestablished in order to 
preserve and develop them. This is the first bilateral meeting 
since Cuba and Colombia reestablished diplomatic relations and 
according to Garcia there were no difficulties in reaching 
agreements in the spheres of education, culture, sports, 
tourism, and science. 
  [Begin Garcia recording] There were no problems in moving 
forward in all these spheres. The primary difficulty is the 
reestablishment of regular channels so that these relations can 
flow freely. It is usually up to the governments to open such 
channels and allow such relations to be established by 
initiatives on the part of the two sides. That step has already 
been taken. [end recording] 
  Garcia also said that relations between the two countries 
have been strengthened in a very short period of time. 
  [Begin Garcia recording] After the visits to Bogota of 
Foreign Minister Robaina and Carlos Lage, vice minister of the 
Council of State, relations have been boosted. What we are doing 
is merely the continuation of those efforts, made at the 
presidential level through the meeting between President Castro 
and President Gaviria in Cartagena and later through the visits 
of Foreign Minister Robaina and Vice President Lage -- and now 
we are meeting in this joint commission. [end recording] 
  The conversations of the joint Cuban-Colombian commission 
are 
to continue in October 1994 and April 1995 in Santa Fe de Bogota.

  [Text] Colombia and Cuba confirmed their bilateral 
relations in the sports field with the signing of a two-year 
sports agreement which includes the exchange of coaches, and 
information on sciences applied to sports. Luis Alfonso Munoz, 
general director of the Colombian Institute for Youth and 
Sports; and Conrado Martinez Corona, president of the National 
Institute for Sports, Physical Education, and Recreation, signed 
the agreement in the presence of Jose Ramon Fernandez, vice 
president of the Council of Ministers. 
  In a news conference with the accredited press, Munoz 
stated: 
It is the most important agreement that Colombian sports has 
ever made with a country with as much tradition and experience 
as Cuba. Munoz went on to say: We are talking about the first 
country of America in sports and the fifth in the Olympic Games 
of Barcelona. I believe the sports movement of my country can 
benefit from Cuba's important achievements in the field of 
sports.

<F P=106> ["Our Opinion" commentary by Orlando Contreras] </F>
  [Text] Last night, on the "This Very Day" program, Basic 
Industry Minister Marcos Portal informed the people on the 
critical situation in the supply of electric energy in the 
entire country and particularly in Havana City. I believe 
Portal's detailed explanation satisfies all questions, doubts, 
criticisms, and complaints on the generating capacity, 
particularly in Havana City, where in past weeks, unscheduled 
outages have seriously intensified. 
  Portal explained the reasons for the increase in outages and 
the reasons why it is impossible to adhere to a plan of 
scheduled outages. Tomorrow, Sunday, at 1630 local time Tele 
Rebelde will rebroadcast that interview. Those who were unable 
to hear Minister Portal's explanations should listen to the 
words of the Minister of the Basic Industry. I believe he spoke 
clearly without rhetoric, without euphoria, and with specific 
facts. I am not going to summarize his words. It is better that 
you listen to them without an intermediary. 
  I am going to refer to one aspect of Marco Portal's 
discourse 
regarding the exploration and extraction of Cuban oil. He 
announced that the drilling of oil wells will begin in diverse 
areas assigned to well-known foreign enterprises through 
exploration agreements with the state at their own risk. In 
other words, the enterprises cover all the expenses until oil is 
found, if there is any, and after complex research. 
  It is obvious that these costs are very high. They range 
from 
millions to hundreds of millions of dollars. The drilling of oil 
wells is done only when the research yields positive results. 
Similarly expensive, and when the existence of oil is confirmed, 
the phase of preparing conditions for oil exploitation begins 
next. The fact is that the drilling process in several places is 
about to begin. 
  Another fact that to me is of singular importance is that 
there are several contracts with diverse foreign firms, many of 
which are European, which are experienced in this type of work. 
As Portal said, this guarantees that when the United States 
decides to lift the blockade, U.S. enterprises, many of which 
are currently very interested in establishing this type of 
contract, can do so and will join those that already exist. 
Therefore we will follow a strategy -- and I am paraphrasing -- 
that would seem to mark the tone for our foreign economic 
relations: Never again depend on just one market for supplies to 
our country or to sell our products. History has demonstrated 
how risky that can be, especially if that market of buyers or 
sellers is the U.S. market. 
  Cuba will not reject U.S. investments that adjust to our 
laws, but we want to maintain a broad range and never again have 
only one source. Furthermore, when U.S. enterprises are 
authorized by their government to trade with Cuba, in other 
words when the blockade is someday lifted, Cuba will respect the 
contracts with foreign enterprises that made the investments 
when the United States prohibited such transactions. It is a 
principle of ethics and of knowing how to honor the 
responsibilities acquired.

  [Text] Angolan graduates from Cuban education centers last 
week in Luanda celebrated a day of solidarity with Cuba on the 
33d anniversary of the Playa Giron victory. 
  Victor Nataniel Narciso, vice president of the association 
of 
former Angolan students in Cuba, has urged the United States to 
lift the economic and commercial blockade imposed on the island 
for more than three decades. He said this blockade is the main 
cause of the complex economic situation in Cuba. 
  A baseball game was played yesterday as part of the 
celebration, between members of the Cuban diplomatic mission and 
members of the Angolan association. This game is considered 
historical as the first match of this nature played in Angola.

  [Text] Havana, 17 Apr (EFE) -- The situation of the 
national electric power system is one of Cuba's most serious 
problems, and, given this, it is currenty impossible to 
eliminate power outages, Basic Industry Minister Marcos Portal 
said in a lengthy television appearance. 
  Portal gave a detailed explanation of the causes that have 
brought the power system to the brink of collapse, and he said 
that with the measures now being implemented, Cuba might reach 
60 percent of its generation capacity by December. During the 
most critical days, capacity fell to 36 percent, which resulted 
in relentless power outages, and today, according to the 
minister, capacity is at about 50 percent. 
  He said one of the most important steps taken was to improve 
the working conditions of laborers in this sector, mainly in 
terms of provisions and incentives. This, along with the 
startup of two new power plants, the purchase of $10 million in 
spare parts, and strict control over public and private energy 
consumption over the next few months, should alleviate the 
situation by the end of the year. 
  "There are solutions, but we cannot accomplish miracles," 
Portal remarked, after pointing out the current crisis has been 
caused by breakdowns and poor maintenance of the nation's 
thermoelectric plants, the majority of which are Soviet and 
Czech built; the country's difficult financial situation; and 
the use of local crude, whose high sulfur content damages the 
generators. 
  According to the minister, the supply of spare parts was 
interrupted in 1990, and since then the thermoelectric plants 
have been repaired or maintained with the reserve stock of spare 
parts. Also, according to the minister, consumption of 
electricity in homes increased 14 percent over the previous year 
during the first quarter of 1994, mainly because of the use of 
electric stoves, which are often homemade, because of a lack of 
cooking gas, which is very scarce. 
  "It is not possible for every home to cook with electricity, 
because the nation's power system could never assimilate the 
demand," insisted Marcos Portal, after promising that, little by 
little, the distribution of liquified gas would resume. 
  He also said "there are no privileges" in terms of power 
interruptions. 
  He added that the incidents which occurred over the past few 
days in some Havana neighborhoods were provoked "by malicious 
people." Last week, the power outages lasted up to 20 hours in 
different areas of the capital, which sparked angry protests of 
residents and incidents in neighborhoods such as Alamar and 
downtown Havana.

  [Text] Ricardo Alarcon, president of the National Assembly 
of the People's Government, in an address at the 6th plenum of 
the National Association of Small Farmers [ANAP], referred to 
what it would mean to Cuban farmers if the exploiters from the 
prerevolutionary period were to return to power. He made 
reference to two articles in a magazine published in Florida. 
  [Begin Alarcon recording] Farmers had no showers or proper 
housing, not because they were simple minded or because they did 
not care to live any better but because they were being 
exploited. They were being exploited by those who left Cuba. 
Now, some of those people are harboring aspirations in the face 
of the great difficulties and problems that Cuba is 
experiencing. Some of them are watering at the mouth to take a 
bite. I do not blame them. 
  In this magazine there are two articles: The one on the left 
page is titled "This Land is My Land" and the other is titled 
"Reclaiming." The first deals with a man who seems to have owned 
a great mansion in Havana or Havana Province -- it is unclear 
which. He says that his house was awesome -- it is apparently 
now a school -- and that his back yard is no longer private 
[play on words of a children's nursery rhyme] because it is the 
school's sports field. This seems to bother this man a great 
deal, people playing and having a good time. The man goes on to 
explain that when the Revolution collapses his home will have to 
be returned to him, because it is his home. He says he will 
regain his house through legal channels because he is civilized, 
decent, and quiet. He goes on to say that he knows that there 
are many people in Miami who would go about this in a violent 
manner, kicking off their properties whoever was living there 
because those properties still belong to them. They were stolen. 
  The other article refers to a leader of the association of 
Cuban landowners in exile; this concerns the ministry of 
[Alfredo] Jordan. There are people who claim the sugarcane mills 
and fields, as well as the farms you are now using for 
miscellaneous crops, which we hope will multiply and grow more 
quickly and which the ANAP is going to discuss in August. Thus, 
it is not we who are saying: If the Revolution were to 
collapse....[changes thought] We do not say this to convince 
anyone that we must be patriotic, we must be revolutionaries. 
They are the ones saying and repeating that. [end recording]

  [Text] On 18 April, TRABAJADORES newspaper features an 
editorial entitled: "Efficiency Assemblies: Getting Going Strong 
and Right." The editorial states that in difficult and complex 
times like these, the Cuban union movement approaches 1 May in a 
period of growth, renovation, and a strengthened role as guide 
and mobilizer. After stressing the colossal experience of the 
Parliaments in the Workplace process and the willingness to root 
that spirit in the life of every work center, the editorial 
emphasizes the importance of the union leadership's decision to 
give continuity and shape to this method through the new 
Assemblies for Efficiency. 
  The editorial also points out that each of Cuba's 18 unions, 
in a pilot program, will select two work centers in every 
province to conduct these assemblies. The 570 Assemblies for 
Efficiency during the second half of April will be a living 
laboratory to continue down the road opened by the Parliaments 
in the Workplace. The editorial adds that it is essential that 
these assemblies be born strong, vigorous, and well-designed 
because a good start is important to the success and development 
of this concept. It will not be a matter of repeating the former 
production and service assemblies under a new name. 
  The main difference is that the Assemblies for Efficiency 
will not hear worker complaints or requests but will discuss and 
reach specific accords to boost economic efficiency in every 
work center. The TRABAJADORES editorial points out that this is 
not a new idea but the latest economic management methods that 
have resulted in heightened productivity excellence and set a 
priority on worker participation, interest, and morale. The 
editorial adds that the most efficient capitalists have 
recognized the value of these factors and we must learn to take 
advantage of them, in accordance with our system. 
  It is necessary to develop the workers' economic information 
and knowledge and seek and evaluate efficiency on the basis of 
cost-effectiveness. Along with gradual progress toward linking 
production and individual and collective motivation, every union 
leader must focus on the struggle for efficiency. 
  The TRABAJADORES editorial adds that every manager must 
learn 
that the men and women he leads are the primary focus of his 
endeavor. The editorial adds that we are confident this 
participative formula will become an integral part of a Cuban, 
socialist, and efficient economic system. 
  The editorial points out that, as Fidel has said, economic 
efficiency will be a more important result that the streamlining 
of national finances; thence, the importance of adequately 
setting up the Assemblies for Efficiency, which will not follow 
a preconceived plan and to which the quality of management's 
reports will be vital. 
  The editorial also points out that everything learned in the 
workers assemblies helps bolster this new effort. It is 
necessary to personify the Assemblies for Efficiency into what 
Fidel called the "brilliant economist" -- the sum of every 
workplace. The editorial closes by stressing that Cuba, the 
Revolution, and our people need this without delay.

<F P=106> [Report by Mario Munoz for the "Evening Information Review" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] Cuban Basic Industry Minister Marco Javier Portal 
appeared on the "This Very Day" national television program to 
explain the reasons behind the island's difficult energy 
situation. He also took the opportunity to talk about oil 
exploration and future projects. 
  [Begin Portal recording] We divided the island, both land 
and 
sea, into some 26 blocks to search for petroleum. We negotiated 
with several companies to invest in this search. This is 
related in one way or another to the energy crisis and the 
national situation. Why do I say that? Because this is one of 
the most difficult business ventures whereby foreign companies 
risk tens of millions of dollars in investments in the first 
phase and hundreds of millions in the second phase. In one way 
or another, these companies have already invested more than $50 
million in the Cuban oil business. The amount already invested 
in oil exploration is close to $100 million. These companies 
make investments. If they find oil they will recover their 
investments, depending on the volume and quality of the oil 
found. If it is a big field of good quality oil, 90 percent of 
it is for Cubans and 10 percent is for the foreign company. 
During the investment recovery period, the ratio is 50-50. Once 
the investment is recovered in the first years, depending on oil 
volume and quality. [sentence as heard] 
  Of the world's seven most industrialized countries -- 
meaning 
the United States, Japan, Germany, and others -- three are 
already investing in Cuban oil exploration; specifically, 
France, Canada, and the UK. I do not think it is a secret that 
the UK is the United States' most important ally. The UK is a 
country whose parliamentary institutions, the House of Lords, 
for instance, have publicly addressed its relations with Cuba. 
It is interesting to see how some British politicians and 
businessmen analyze U.S. policies toward Cuba and how they 
perceive that the North Americans have two intentions toward us: 
the obvious political intention to try to destroy the 
Revolution at any cost, and the economic intention to prevent 
other countries from investing here. 
  The British have taken a step forward. One company has 
already hired an (?oil explorer). In short, there are four 
countries investing here: France, Canada, the UK, and Sweden. 
  I am not talking about the U.S. Government. I am talking 
about the U.S. oil tycoons and the U.S. oil, mining, 
metallurgic, and tourism industries, which have expressed their 
concerns about not being able to invest here. They are aware of 
this and want to be allowed to invest here because they attended 
the meetings we held in Calgary, Canada, and London, where our 
comrades made offers. The U.S. companies obtained information 
there and learned about what is going on in Cuba. In other 
words, they are eager to invest here. I am not talking about 
the U.S. Government, whose attitude is determined by other 
considerations. But there is a great deal of interest on the 
part of U.S. investors. We confirmed it. [end recording] 
  Minister Portal also explained to Cubans the methods and 
techniques used to find oil. 
  [Begin recording] [Portal] We are currently searching for 
oil 
in all these blocks. We are using the seismic method in several 
blocks. The seismic method is important because it uses the age 
and geologic features of surrounding terrain to determine the 
best place to explore. If nothing is found, there is no 
drilling. This is the first step, a guiding point. Millions of 
dollars are invested in the first step. We need specialized 
ships for ocean exploration. High technology equipment currently 
being used in Cuba is needed for land exploration. The country 
has widely used this sophisticated equipment, which adds to the 
information that we collected for many years with the former 
Soviet Union during ocean and land exploration. We have seismic 
information about the geological features of solid minerals and 
oil. This information is very useful as we move forward so 
quickly. Currently, we have [words indistinct] already hired. 
  As for the seismic method, we have found formations similar 
to those found in other oil-producing countries in some blocks. 
These structures must be drilled. Drilling is already under way 
at sea. In the next few days, these companies will start 
drilling on land. If there were no possibility of....[pauses] 
The drilling shows if underground sedimentary rocks that are 
about the same age as rocks found in other oil-producing 
countries and which are constantly moving as the earth ages are 
oil rich or not. There is no doubt that Cuba has oil. It has 
enough oil to produce 1.2 million tons this year, and there are 
possibilities of producing even more in the future. 
  That is all I can tell you for the time being about the 
seismic method. I repeat: Drilling in those places is already 
under way. We no longer have abstract hopes; we now have 
tangible hopes. 
  [Unidentified reporter] What type of hopes... 
  [Portal, interrupting] I also want to say that if there is 
an 
oil well, we must determine how much oil it has and then build 
three or four more wells, depending on oil volume estimates. 
Then we can begin tapping oil. This operation could last two 
or three years depending on the features of the place. 
  These companies perform other tasks that give us an idea of 
how promising the Cuban oil industry is. The old Soviet 
technique was used in old oil wells that are now being tapped by 
foreign companies. Such companies have taken wells that used to 
produce 30, 20, 15, or 10 tons of oil and, using modern 
technology, significantly increased production to 60, 70, or 80 
tons of oil in some wells. This increase that Cuba would never 
have been able to produce is shared with that company. Base 
production, however, is not shared; it remains ours. It is 
shared if production increases. The Cuban oil industry has many 
possibilities, and we are enjoying them. Every time you conduct 
this type of business in the oil and nickel industry, in mining, 
in the search for precious metals, or in tourism with non-U.S. 
companies, you feel pleased. It is more than pleasure; it is 
the certainty that we will not have to conduct this type of 
business with U.S. companies only. [end recording] 
  Portal also talked about the trust that foreign investors 
have in doing business with Cuba. 
  [Begin Portal recording] These companies have noticed that 
we 
Cubans are loyal. Cuban loyalty is already a tradition. We are 
loyal even to our African ancestors. Regardless of whether the 
United States lifts the blockade, serious capitalists and 
representatives of prestigious firms sense that when we conduct 
business with one of them, we will never betray them, nor will 
we break their contracts. Very serious people in the world 
approach us. We are 29th on the list of countries where one can 
invest safely. Many nations, whose names I refuse to mention, 
are below us. I believe the media has already made this list 
public; it will probably make it public again. I am sure the 
media will comment on it, because it is a very important 
achievement. We are close to the United States, and we are the 
most promising country to import [sentence as heard]. This 
confirms our people's willingness to fight and excel. [end 
recording]

<F P=106> [Commentary by Miguel Angel de la Guardia from the "Evening </F>
Information Review" newscast] 
  [Text] There is no doubt that the shortage of oil and oil 
by-products is the main economic problem Cuba is currently 
facing. It is the main hardship of the so-called special period 
in the aftermath of the sudden fall of eastern European 
socialism, particularly the fall of socialism in the former 
Soviet Union. This lack of oil has had a widespread effect on 
all types of transportation services, because Cuba has largely 
relied on automotive transportation, which requires not only 
fuel, but also lubricants and other important products. 
  The sugar industry, the most important industry in Cuba, 
which is the world's largest sugar exporter, cannot run without 
petroleum. However, many sugar refineries are using bagasse as 
the main source of fuel for their boilers. 
  In addition, the country's electrical industry also needs 
hydrocarbons to generate energy. Cuba, a small country that 
lacks large rivers and waterfalls needed to build hydroelectric 
plants, has only two alternatives: thermoelectrical plants, 
which also need oil, and nuclear plants. The construction of 
the nuclear plant in Juragua, in the central region, was halted 
when it was almost finished, because the mighty Soviet state, 
which was helping Cuba build its first nuclear plant, suddenly 
disappeared. Thus, the Cuban Government is feverishly 
negotiating with other countries to complete this project vital 
to the national economy. This lack of electricity introduced a 
new predicament to the Cuban population, which is exposed to 
daily power outages that last several hours, usually at times 
when it is most needed. 
  These brief examples allow us to visualize the problems the 
Cuban nation is currently facing, because the world's largest 
power is economically blocking and harassing it to subjugate the 
political resolve of the Cuban population. Cuba, along with 
several European and American countries, has given oil 
exploration a large impetus. Cuba has also been able to 
significantly increase national crude production since 1959, 
when the revolution succeeded. 
  Oil production is expected to amount to 1.3 million tons 
this 
year and will continue to grow in the future. Large amounts of 
this oil used to generate electricity are too heavy and require 
special treatment to reduce the number of breakdowns in the 
industry's already worn-out equipment. 
  Cuba also signed an important agreement with Russia to 
exchange 2.5 million tons of oil for 1 million tons of sugar 
this year. In addition, a joint operation with Mexico is 
already under way to jump start the Cienfuegos oil refinery, 
part of whose output will be bought by and consumed in that 
country. 
  After the incident of an alleged meeting that Colombian 
guerrillas held in Havana, which jeopardized the recently 
established relations between the two countries, there is a 
possibility that Colombia will sell some 120,000 barrels of 
crude oil daily to Cuba within the framework of a transaction 
exclusively regulated by international trade guidelines. Other 
efforts are already under way but have yet to materialize. It 
is expected that the Cuban economy will experience some kind of 
relief this year and will begin surmounting the crisis caused by 
the latest political upheavals.

Revolutionary Armed Forces, chaired the national ceremony 
marking the 33rd anniversary of the proclamation of the 
socialist character of the Revolution and combatants day. More

patriotic poems and songs as well as typical elements of the 
national culture. 
  The Mariana Grajales Plaza of the Revolution in Guantanamo 
City also served as the site for the promotion ceremony of 
reservists and combatants and the decoration of combatants that 
served important missions along the perimeter that borders the 
Yankee naval base. The occasion also served to award outstanding 
people and institutions, with a replica of Maximo Gomez's 
machete for their excellent work in the cultural field. The 
ceremony was held outside of La Fortaleza de la Cabana for the 
fist time.

while another group is on their way to cutting a third million. 
Considering these results, Camaguey has obtained the status of 
millionaire in manual canecutting. 
  [Begin unidentified worker recording] All comrades here are 
willing to cut to the last sugarcane for this harvest. This

desire to fight for this Revolution and to bail the country out 
of its current situation. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Passage within italic in Creole] </F>
  [Text] Minister of Commerce and Industry of the resigning 
government, Louis Dejoie, has recommended the clean sweep 
solution to the situation's stalemate. Invited on 16 April to 
the program "Meeting on Metropole," the president of the 
National Agricultural and Industrial Party, PAIN, proposed 
option zero, the only means, according to him, of solving the 
crisis in view of the refusal by the protagonists to meet around 
the table. Let us listen to Louis Dejoie: 
  [Begin recording] [Dejoie] As a leader of a political 
party, I have said that the power is in the streets. If we 
cannot find a solution, well, gentlemen, we should have a clean 
sweep, send everyone home and start at zero, as the CNG 
[National Government Council] did. It is the only way, because 
as I said... [pauses] I believe that President Firmin Jean-Louis 
confirmed what I said -- that elections will soon be held. The 
people will thus hear about all the crooked dealings during 
those two years, and will go to elections because in November, 
there will be no Chamber, no communal mayor, no CASEC [Communal 
Section Administration Council]. No political or administrative 
institution will remain in the country. What are we therefore 
going to do? We have no constitution. 
  [Reporter Renois] Mr. Dejoie, you recommend the clean 
sweep. Does that not refer to the application of Article 149? To 
whom should power be given for the holding of general elections 
in the country if we must choose this path? 
  [Dejoie] We had already done something by putting Mrs. 
Trouillot in power. I believe that if all the democratic 
political parties meet around a table and we realize that the 
solution lies in reshuffling the cards, in restarting at zero so 
the people can resume participation -- but this time, in a 
methodical way, not by worsening a situation [mete abce sou 
clou]: To tell me a month before elections a man is chosen as a 
presidential candidate who, became president like a chance 
mishap -- it is a mishap in Haiti's history to have Aristide as 
Haiti's president -- he came with no political project, no 
political party. He was put up as president because he found a 
hat called FNCD [National Front For Change and Democracy], a 
rooster was placed before him, and a month later he was 
president. 
  [Renois] I see you with a booklet with President 
Aristide's picture. This contrasts with your position? 
  [Dejoie] No, on the contrary. I even told the president that 
the reason I participated in this concord government was my 
reading of this booklet called, "For a New Start," which 
included proposals for a program's general framework, and for a 
government of overture. I found in it 90 percent of the social 
projects PAIN supports. Everything that he wrote there are 
formidable, extraordinary things. If everything included 
in this booklet could be achieved, we would no longer have 
problems in Haiti. 
  [Renois] What prevents those things from happening? 
  [Dejoie] It could be the ambitions of one man, who 
wants everything for himself. 
  [Renois] Could one believe that there is a curse on 
this country and on the political men of this country? 
  [Dejoie] Oh, yes! There is something like a curse, 
despite all the prayers. I myself am a very fervent Catholic. 
Every morning, every Sunday, I kneel before my bed and pray. But 
still, I can find no solution. Perhaps God does not want... 
  [Renois, interrupting] Or should one think like this 
American diplomat who said that Haitians have a chromosome more 
or a chromosome less? 
  [Dejoie, laughing] Frankly I would not want to fall 
into a controversy right now, but I can tell you simply that we 
political leaders are missing something because we still cannot 
agree with one another. 
  Agreement is easy, gentlemen: Gather the 16 political 
leaders around a big table -- whether they are neo-Duvalierist, 
PAIN, Aristide, or anyone else -- there is only one common 
denominator: Haiti. We were saying the other day that even we 
have lost enthusiasm. The people do not understand what is going 
on. They are dying of hunger because two people are fighting, or 
four Haitians got together and are oppressing us. The 
international community worsens the situation, adding fuel to 
the fire until we cannot agree with one another. 
  I must tell you that the Americans are looking for 
something that we do not know about. Is it uranium that we have 
in our ground? I do not know. Why is it that they keep annoying 
us and that we cannot find a solution? Everytime we are close to 
the solution, something else comes up. 
  [Announcer] Louis Dejoie, minister of commerce and industry, 
was the guest of the broadcast, "Meeting." It should be noted 
that the minister of commerce defended himself in a letter to 
the president-in-exile. Louis Dejoie asked Father Aristide for 
rectification after Aristide called Dejoie a traitor, accusing 
him of selling or renting a part of the national territory in 
the case of Port-Tortuga S.A. Dejoie confessed, however, that 
Prime Minister Robert Malval had reproached him for not 
submitting the Tortuga case to the Council of Ministers of the 
resigning government.

  [Excerpts] This week, the president of the lower chamber, 
Robert Monde, will have to set about a series of consultations 
with the various sectors of national life on the political 
crisis the country is experiencing. This was confirmed through a 
news release dated 15 April and released by Emmanuel Reyme, 
first secretary of the Chamber of Deputies. The great bodies of 
the state, the employers' associations, the protesters, and the 
various political groups will be consulted on a solution to the 
political problem. At around 1100 this morning, the office of 
the lower chamber will meet with the Haitian Chamber of Commerce 
and Industry before beginning consultations with the employers' 
associations this afternoon at 1500, according to the timetable 
sent to the media by Reyme. 
  The public was previously informed of this during the 
address 
to the nation on 13 April. In his message, Monde noted the 
institutional vacuum created by the refusal of the president in 
exile to appoint a new prime minister. [passage omitted] 
  Let us recall that the political parties gathered under the 
Coordinating Committee for National Mobilization called Monde's 
initiative maneuvers and a return to the starting point. 
According to [Hubert] de Ronceray, Monde is desperately trying 
to exhume the null and void Governors island Agreement. 
  For his part, National Assembly President Firmin Jean-Louis 
keenly deplored the fact that Vice President Monde had 
unilaterally decided to address a message to the nation and to 
initiate consultations without bothering to send him the 
outlines.

  [Text] Foreign Relations Secretary Manuel Tello Macias said 
in a brief interview at Mexico City's international airport upon 
returning from Paris that Mexico's admittance to the OECD is not 
a cure-all but a recognition of Mexico's democratic and economic 
pluralism. He said the act signifies acceptance of Mexico's 
respect for human rights and the opening of various markets. 
Manuel Tello also assured that Mexico will continue developing 
in order to meet the needs of the Mexican people, who still lack 
the most basic necessities. 
  [Begin Tello recording] It is recognition of our policies to 
establish a market economy; it is recognition of the democratic 
pluralism in Mexico; it is recognition of Mexico's respect for 
human rights. Those are the three conditions for entry into the 
organization, and we have met them. [end recording] 
  Tello also emphasized that Mexico's admittance to the OECD 
was by consensus and in recognition of President Salinas de 
Gortari's economic policies. 
  The foreign relations secretary added that he did not 
believe 
that the Chiapas events would affect Mexico's image abroad.

  [Text] Mexico City, 14 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- The National 
Foreign Trade Bank (Bancomext) and the Chamber of 
Representatives of Foreign Enterprises (Crecex) have signed an 
agreement to exchange information on statistics and customs 
duties systems. 
  Bancomext issued a communique stating that it will make 
arrangements for Crecex to access Bancomext information to 
locate foreign trade business opportunities through its Foreign 
Trade Service Center [Centro de Servicios de Comercio Exterior]. 
The Costa Rican organization will provide information on the 
demand for Mexican products in that Central American country and 
on biddings by public and private organizations, as well as 
everything regarding the customs duties system and foreign trade 
statistics.

  [Text] Leaders of the Coordinating Board of the Zapata 
Lives National Liberation Campaign [Coordinadora de la Jornada 
de Liberacion Nacional Zapata Vive] has announced that it has 
opened talks with Government Secretary Jorge Carpizo, but the 
two side have not yet begun to discuss issues related to the 
demands presented by the various peasant organizations. 
  During a news conference, the leaders of the organization 
indicated that they are more than willing to continue the 
dialogue. They also reported the existence of provocateurs who 
have met with the Civilian Society Bureau [Mesa de la Sociedad 
Civil] installed in Mexico City's Zocalo District to create 
problems and thereby justify any aggression against the peasants 
and Indians who are awaiting a reply from the government. 
  Genaro Dominguez, adviser to the National Coordinating Board 
of United Indian People (CNPI), said, "Those of us here have 
been angered by this situation, and yet no one will force us 
into any provocation that would justify aggression against the 
Indians and peasants." 
  Earlier, peasant leaders disclosed that today at 1200 they 
would head to the Chamber of Deputies to present several 
proposals aimed at reforming Article 27 of the Constitution. 
  They insisted that the camp they have erected in Zocalo will 
remain there. They also indicated that they plan to wait until 
Government Secretary Carpizo announces when panels will be 
formed to discuss problems reported by the various peasant 
organizations. 
  Meanwhile, Francisco Jimenez Pablo, representative of the 
Chiapas State Council of Indian and Peasant Organizations 
(CEOIC), denied that property seizures are being organized by 
ranchers and landowners themselves. He insisted that this is 
just a rumor being spread by the state government "as an excuse 
not to resolve the land problem."

<F P=106> [Report by Rosa Icela Rodriguez] </F>
  [Excerpt] In an effort to make the voter lists for the 21 
August elections more trustworthy, the General Council of the 
Federal Electoral Institute [IFE] has unanimously agreed to 
extend the deadline for reviewing the names of citizens on the 
lists until 30 April. It also agreed to change -- with only two 
votes against -- the conditions for bidding by Mexican and 
foreign firms for the right to conduct an independent audit of 
the lists. 
  After promising that the definitive lists of names will be 
turned over to the parties before the scheduled date, Government 
Secretary Jorge Carpizo McGregor said the Mexican Government "is 
determined to provide all instruments that can yield trustworthy 
results so that everyone can overcome this air of distrust." 
  IFE members unanimously approved the PRI presidential 
candidate's replacement. Jorge Carpizo, president of the 
General Council of the IFE, submitted candidate Ernesto 
Zedillo's legal registration to Humberto Lira Mora, electoral 
action secretary of the PRI. Those present at the session, at 
Carpizo's request, marked a moment of silence in memory of Luis 
Donaldo Colosio. 
  After voting against an independent audit, Party of the 
Democratic Revolution [PRD] Deputy Roberto Robles Garnica, 
minority representative in the Senate, said such an audit will 
prove "useless" because "it is designed to be more of a 
justification than an improvement in the credibility of the 
electoral lists." He added that by the time the audit is 
completed, "we will not have time to use it" to make corrections. 
  PRI adviser Salvador Rocha Diaz denied that the "electoral 
lists are incorrect," and he accused the PRD of having assumed a 
"dubious position." He said "it is a serious thing" for the 
party "to already be preparing to reject the election results." 
  Following a long debate in which an independent audit of the 
electoral lists was approved, Carpizo thanked the members of the 
Independent Audit Technical Council for their work and added: 
"The work done by the 11 scientists contrasts the work conducted 
by other Mexicans whose cooperation was requested and who have 
haggled about their time." He did not go into any details about 
who he was referring to. 
  Carpizo also announced that starting today the electronic 
media will broadcast messages from the nine presidents of the 
political parties in which they will invite their supporters to 
verify the electoral lists in their respective centers. As of 
yesterday, six party presidents had already recorded their 
messages. 
  The official later said that, following demands from the 
parties -- "which, in my opinion, are correct" -- they will be 
given definite party member lists before the scheduled date to 
give them enough time to review the lists. He explained that 
this decision will require a reform of the Cofipe [Federal Code 
of Institutions and Electoral Procedures], for which there is a 
consensus. Nevertheless, he said this would require reducing by 
approximately one month the deadline to deliver credentials with 
a photograph. 
  He explained it will also be necessary to launch a 
large-scale effort to enable the people to immediately pick up 
their voting credentials, and he calculated the first voter 
lists could be delivered by 1 August. 
  The agreement approved by the parties indicates an external 
audit will review and evaluate the voter lists, the credentials 
with a photograph, and the receipt of credentials and party 
member lists. 
  Carpizo admitted that the external audit may reveal 
"mistakes 
in the voter lists involving dead people and changes of 
address," but, he said, "I thought about this before accepting 
this post because, if this was going to be one of the daring 
adventures of my life, I would not work with voter lists that 
did not allow me personally to be confident." 
  The debate between Carpizo and the PRD representatives 
became 
difficult at times, although the tone was more conciliatory in 
later sessions. This session was not attended by PRD leader 
Porfirio Munoz Ledo. Senator Robles Garnica, coordinator 
general of Cuauhtemoc Cardenas' campaign, attended in his place.

  [Text] Guadalajara, Jalisco, 10 Apr -- Behind the backdrop 
of the 35th annual Assembly of Governors of the Inter-American 
Development Bank (IDB), Mexican authorities are striving to 
guarantee economic stability to foreign investors. They can no 
longer, however, hide the fact that the political crisis is now 
stirring up a financial crisis in Mexico. 
  In fact, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari is starting to 
lose control of financial variables [variables] because his main 
U.S. allies feel deceived. Moreover, an outflow of about $6 
billion shows that local and foreign capital has already cast 
its vote against Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, the new PRI 
[Institutional Revolutionary Party] candidate for president. 
  Currently, there is a dangerous paradox that could prompt a 
new crisis now that the current six-year period is drawing to an 
end: Zedillo guarantees economic continuity and offers security 
to large-scale capital in the long run, but, in the short-term 
and midterm, he cannot offer leadership or confidence. 
  The goal of this capital flight is not, specifically, to 
reject Zedillo, but the fact is that domestic and foreign 
circumstances are making it difficult to create a stable 
atmosphere for investment. Doubts are emerging over Zedillo's 
political sense and his ability to maneuver in a complex 
electoral process characterized by division and struggles within 
the PRI. Mexico also is facing a dubious investigation into the 
assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio amid a yet-to-be-clarified 
plot that presages new outbursts of violence, as well as a 
conflict in Chiapas that threatens to drag on as long as a dying 
system that resists political and social opening continues to 
lean toward a harsher, authoritarian line in order to survive. 
  If there are additional indications of a vicious circle 
characteristic of a politically insensitive state and worsening 
social decomposition, the first fallout could be a financial 
crack [previous word in English]. 
  Increasing interest rates in the United States and political 
uncertainty in Mexico are inspiring additional hikes in domestic 
interest rates, which in turn discourage private investment and 
economic growth. This will lead to higher unemployment, low 
consumption, and growing social pressure that will reinforce 
political instability. 
  It might seem pessimistic to say this, but our undeniable 
national reality is frightening investors. Confidential data 
available to this reporter indicate that eight out of 10 
businesses have stocked up [se han cubierto] on dollars. For 
the first time in years, the country began to experience capital 
flight last month, and the outflow reached nearly $6 billion by 
8 April. The country's international reserves, estimated in 
late February at $28 billion, have dropped by a comparable 
amount. This has virtually nullified a line of credit the U.S. 
Treasury Department and Federal Reserve have granted Mexico. 
  The peso has lost 8.3 percent of its value and is currently 
near the ceiling of the range of floating rates. This and no 
other reason explains why interest rates on 28-day treasury 
certificates have increased from 8.81 to 14.31 percent within 
the past 40 days. At the expense of the domestic market, the 
Mexican Government is trying to retain investors by offering 
then outlandish incentives. 
  Former "allies," however, are no longer seeking high 
financial or speculative profits. Instead, they are now looking 
for safety and security that the former Mexican "miracle" can no 
longer guarantee. All quarters feel deceived. Two events have 
coincided to create this sentiment. 
  1. One day after Colosio's assasination, Pedro Aspe, Miguel 
Mancera, Guillermo Ortiz, and Jose Angel Gurria tried to get the 
Federal Reserve and U.S. Treasury to extend their lines of 
credit from $1 billion to $6 billion. 
  The White House became concerned over the impact a 
devaluation could have on the Mexican economy. However, on 28 
March, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL said: "Mexico managed to maneuver 
behind the scenes, and a secret agreement prevented panic from 
seizing the market." 
  With this information leaked by Mexican officials, the U.S. 
House of Representatives Energy and Trade Committee, headed by 
John D. Dingell, is investigating Treasury Secretary Lloyd 
Bentsen and Stock Commission President Arthur Levitt on 
suspicions of having improperly suspended Mexican shares on the 
U.S. market. 
  Bentsen is quite annoyed over the leak because the Mexicans 
violated a secret gentlemen's agreement, and he may refrain from 
promoting the $20 billion line of credit the Mexican Government 
is negotiating with the World Bank and IMF to avoid a financial 
crack [previous word in English] in the country, which will take 
several months despite efforts by Jose Cordoba, Mexico's 
representative at the IDB. 
  2. From the evening of 23 March until Holy Week, the 
highest-ranking officials of the Mexican financial sector 
assured employees, bankers, and consultants for U.S. investment 
funds that Colosio's death was the product of the "sick mind of 
a crazy assassin who read books on Marxism-Leninism, and not a 
plot," but on 4 April, Assistant Prosecutor Miguel Montes 
officially admitted that Colosio was the victim of "a planned 
action." 
  The U.S. financial sector (capital) is also annoyed by what 
it considers a betrayal, and it has noted that its contact in 
Mexico (the financial sector) is unrealistic. This has led to 
the flight of U.S. capital, which is also being prompted by 
other fears: How will the electoral process turn out? How much 
rope will Salinas give Zedillo? What will happen between now 
and 21 August and from 21 August through 1 December? 
  After all is said and done, it is undeniable that with the 
same frivolity that Lopez Portillo staked the country's future 
on would-be and thwarted wealth from oil, Salinas de Gortari has 
staked the country's inclusion in the First World on the Mexican 
Stock Market. The greater the risk, the greater the gain or 
loss. What else can I say? Those are the rules of the market.

  [Text] Industry Undersecretary Fernando Sanchez Ugarte has 
said that "the political situation is becoming stable," and, 
therefore, there will be no permanent repercussions on the 
economy. Sanchez Ugarte added that the federal government has 
not "yet" considered making any changes in its targets regarding 
growth and inflation. 
  Fernando Cortina, president of the Confederation of 
Industrial Chambers [Concamin], noted that the today's "moments 
of political tension" might affect economic prospects, and, 
therefore, "we should not be confused by rumors," because only 
by "visualizing the type of country we want in the future" will 
we be able to eradicate "the signs of violence and antidemocracy 
that pervade these times of confusion." 
  Meanwhile, Enrique Aranzabal, president of the National 
Chamber of the Textile Industry [CNIT], said during an interview 
that in light of political uncertainty in the nation, "it will 
be difficult to meet official economic targets." 
  During the regular General Assembly of the Textile Chamber, 
Sanchez Ugarte pointed out that the federal government is 
determined to stay the course in terms of its macroeconomic 
program, anti-inflationary policies, and healthy public finances. 
  "We hope that all macroeconomic factors continue to hold 
steady and that the economy remains stable," Sanchez Ugarte said 
at the end of his speech. 
  Sanchez Ugarte expressed his confidence that the GDP will 
increase by 3.5 percent, and he added that "no changes have been 
made yet" to meet this target. 
  Asked about the national industrial situation, he commented 
that there are no current figures on industrial performance at 
this time, but he indicated that in December 1993, manufacturing 
sector began to recover. He also expressed confidence that 
figures for the first quarter of 1994 will reflect an 
improvement over previous months. 
  In terms of job creation, Sanchez Ugarte noted that today 
the 
industrial sector provides employment to approximately 3.5 
million workers, and "in 1994, this sector could generate 
150,000 jobs." 
  Meanwhile, Concamin leader Fernando Cortina underscored that 
the intensity of the globalization process is not only reflected 
in greater economic competition, but also in the exacerbation of 
social problems, "which hint the turn of the century will be 
shaken by unemployment, plummeting investment, economic 
slowdown, volatile financial markets, the internationalization 
of new commercial agreements, and the general use of violence as 
a means of political pressure." 
  In Mexico's case, Cortina maintained that in light of 
"uncertain times," it is commonplace to emphasize the negative 
aspects of a period of tension. However, he added that the 
country's industrialists "must trust in Mexico, considering the 
progress accomplished, and they must also, in all seriousness, 
continue to press for those goals that remain unresolved." 
  Cortina added: "We should not be confused by rumors. 
Conditions for economic stability exist, and if we trust in 
Mexico, we will overcome the uncertainty of having little time 
to lead the country along a path of environmentally sound, 
sustained growth." 
  Along this line, Cortina urged the national business 
community to maintain its trust in the future of Mexico, 
because, through hard work, it will be possible to achieve the 
proposed 4.2-percent average industrial growth. 
  Cortina concluded: "Let us not lose our objectivity, and let 
us keep working on what we know how to do efficiently -- to 
produce with quality and efficiency. Let us defeat those 
adversaries who only seek to destabilize us. Together, we will 
create a better Mexico." 
  Meanwhile, CNIT President Enrique Aranzabal noted that the 
Mexican economy is facing a very difficult period characterized 
by political circumstances that are causing instability in the 
national economy and might result in foiled government 
expectations regarding inflation and growth. 
  In his speech before Sanchez Ugarte, Aranzabal demanded 
prompt solutions to the problems threatening the textile 
industry -- namely, financing and the entry into national 
territory of merchandise priced at dumping levels. 
<H5>  The National Chamber of Commerce [Canaco] Says Economic </H5>
Problems Have Not Been Overcome 
  Canaco leader Gustavo A. Madero pointed out on 12 April that 
it would be a mistake to think the nation's economic problems 
have been overcome, because the fight against inflation is still 
continuing. The inflation problem must be truly solved, 
effectively controlled, and secured with "strong locks" to 
prevent the remergence of pitfalls that have been apparently 
overcome. 
  Madero indicated that in terms of growth, the country is 
facing the worst times in the entire six-year period, with local 
problems and increasing obstacles, but organized businessmen 
have neither slowed down nor ceased their efforts to reverse the 
trend. 
  Consequently, Canaco has supported the creation of a credit 
union for its members, as well as the establishment of a "single 
office" for transactions -- although it is currently overwhelmed 
with requests -- and it has implemented a permanent promotion 
campaign to standardize corporate mergers, among many other 
tasks.

  [Text] Thanks to its interdiction policies, Mexico has 
prevented 50 tons of cocaine annually from entering the U.S. 
market over the last five years. This places Mexico third in 
world drug trafficking control. However, this "noticeable" 
level of interdiction prompted the proliferation of "drug 
pushers," especially along the northern border, who have 
triggered hard drug consumption where there was none before. 
  Miguel Angel Gonzalez Felix, Human Rights and Drug 
Trafficking coordinator of the Foreign Relations Secretariat, 
pointed out that we are running the risk that drug trafficking 
money, which will eventually be "laundered," could enter the 
Mexican financial system thanks to the opening of trade. 
  As for the U.S. State Department's International Drug 
Trafficking Control Report disclosed last week, the official 
said that the Mexican fight against drug trafficking is 
currently taking place without any pressure from the United 
States. He added: "It is a more balanced struggle" due to 
President William Clinton's efforts to fight local consumption, 
not foreign production." [quotation marks as published] As he 
emphasized that our country's fight against drugs is due to 
internal reasons, Gonzalez criticized the report, which 
indicated that 50 percent of the drugs coming into the United 
States enter through our territory. 
  He stressed that at the beginning of the current six-year 
presidential term, the detection and interception of cocaine 
failed to reach 10 tons; during the last few years, however, 
drug seizures amounted to about 50 tons annually. The report 
should state the opposite: "Thanks to the efforts of Mexico, the 
amount of cocaine that enters the United States has been 
curtailed by one fifth. Should we look at it from this 
viewpoint, it would be exactly the opposite." [sentence as 
published] 
  We increased drug seizures from 10 to 50 tons. Should we 
take into account that drug interdiction amounts to 100 tons at 
the U.S. border, 60 tons in Colombia, and 50 tons in Mexico, and 
that Spain, among the European nations, intercepts the most 
cocaine, 10 tons, then the detection level will indeed be "very 
noticeable." 
  Gonzalez admitted that one of the big problems with the 
interdiction policies is the proliferation of "drug pushers." 
Although there is no widespread and serious drug consumption at 
the border, it is a problem that worries authorities 
nonetheless, because it is a situation "we never thought we 
would have to deal with." 
  The diplomat [title as published] added that another problem 
that Mexico could face in view of the free trade is money 
laundering, which could emerge at the same time as 
the market opens. This is an issue that the Finance Secretariat 
and the Attorney General's Office have already began to work on. 
The interdiction systems were more vulnerable to drug 
trafficking money before the opening, but these mechanisms are 
currently being strengthened to ensure that "ill-conceived 
money" operations could be foreseen, detected, and controlled. 
  Gonzalez said that this is a vanguard issue on the American 
continent; Europe and Asia do not have to deal with this problem 
despite their open markets. He insisted Mexico is at the 
vanguard. 
  The so-called U.S. report on our country on the drug issue 
is 
secondary for the official. What is really important is the 
Clinton administration's shift to concentrating more on local 
consumption aspects, not on the cooperation systems of other 
nations. It is not that we want to praise his job, but we could 
say that the most praiseworthy part of it is the change Clinton 
made with regard to local drug consumption. "They are 
channeling more resources to their consumption problem; they are 
also realizing that although the strategies that they 
implemented in the past indeed diminish drug inflows to the 
country, said strategies generated a number of unexpected 
conflicts." 
  This does not mean that the United States will drop 
international cooperation programs altogether. The official 
maintained that cooperation systems with Latin America and 
Mexico still prevail, but they are now very respectful of the 
nations' sovereignty. 
  The United States is tackling these problems, as Mexico has 
done for many years, from an integral viewpoint that will combat 
not only production and trafficking, but also consumption. 
  Does this mean the United States is exerting less pressure 
on 
us? 
  The situation changed when President Clinton came to power. 
It is very respectful of sovereignty, and this makes us have 
fewer conflicts and more expeditious cooperation.

  [Text] Commenting on the possibility of providing special 
protection to U.S. citizens, Government Minister Danilo 
Parrinello said yesterday that the "state is obligated to 
provide security for all Guatemalans, foreign residents, and 
tourists, but we cannot provide special security for foreigners 
of a specific nationality." 
  The minister commented on several incidents, including the 
recent kidnapping of the daughter of a U.S. couple, and said "it 
could all be part of an attempt to create divisions between the 
Guatemalan Government and the United States." Nevertheless, 
Parrinello did not rule out the possibility that it could all be 
"a coincidence." 
  The government minister indicated that he is willing to try 
to provide security for everyone who needs its, but he insisted 
that "the state's role is to ensure the safety, life, and 
property of all citizens as well as of the foreigners living 
here. Foreigners and Guatemalans are entitled to the same 
rights." 
  Referring to President Ramiro de Leon Carpio's statements 
regarding a prohibition on weapons sales, Parrinello said that 
he was referring directly to what the U.S. State Department 
stipulates with respect to U.S. manufacturers' sales to 
Guatemala for security forces purposes. 
  Parrinello said that the U.S. measure "is unfair because 
from 
1944 to date, there has never been an administration more 
respectful of individual rights, nor has there been one that has 
given a more prominent position to human rights issues than that 
of President Ramiro de Leon Carpio." 
  Parrinello stressed that the United States must reevaluate 
its political decision. In the meantime, we will continue 
turning to other friendly countries to procure nonlethal 
materials already manufactured in Guatemala "or to import them 
from friendly countries which understand that our government 
does respect individual rights." 
  Commenting on the [Jorge] Carpio murder case, Parrinello 
said: "I do not have any documents that must be turned over to 
the legal system, and if I did, I would hand them over 
immediately." 
  The minister urged the Guatemalan Bishops Conference to 
reveal the names of the responsible parties, as they say they 
have, and emphasized the president's intention to establish the 
Carpio Commission, for which the president has already issued 
precise instructions to the General Secretariat.

<F P=106> [From the "Telepress" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The family of Georgina Rosse Robyn, the girl who was 
freed last Friday after being kidnapped on 11 April, this Sunday 
visited the Presidential House to meet with President Ramiro de 
Leon Carpio. Before entering the building, the girl's mother 
made a brief statement. 
  Following the visit by the girl's family, President Ramiro 
de 
Leon Carpio answered questions on how the girl was liberated, in 
contrast to other unsolved kidnapping cases. 
  [Begin de Leon recording] This was due to several elements 
and factors. Here the participation and cooperation of the 
Robyn family was key. They provided information and immediately 
went to the authorities. Obviously luck was also on our side. 
Many elements came into play here. 
  Other cases have been discovered in which families have 
refused to publicize that the cases have been resolved. In 
other words, it is very difficult to measure or rate all cases 
equally. 
  What I can tell you for sure is that the actions we are 
carrying out with the cooperation of the Army, which I announced 
days ago, have strengthened civil security forces. The results 
are beginning to show not only in the case of the Robyn family, 
but in other cases which will later be made public. 
  Should these results continue, this is a signal the actions 
taken by the president of the Republic, which some have 
criticized, particularly about the Army's cooperation in these 
investigations, are yielding results. We will continue to work 
in this direction to change investigation procedures and how 
results are obtained. 
  We will continue to train civil security forces. This is 
particularly difficult because there are many countries -- I 
already said this in my message to the nation -- that demand 
results, like the United States for instance, but do not provide 
aid or equipment. How do they expect us to cooperate in these 
investigations if we do not receive uniforms or equipment. 
  The investigation of the Guatemalan Army's Intelligence 
Department, with the participation and cooperation of the 
National Police, provided information leading to the arrest of 
the individuals involved in Georgina Rosse Robyn's kidnapping. 
I understand the Robyn family requested the participation of 
FBI agents. I do not know if they finally came or if they came 
in time, but the result of this arrest was made possible by the 
investigation of the Army's Intelligence Department and the 
National Police. [end recording]

<F P=106> [By Ruth de Aquino] </F>
  [Text] London -- Great Britain and Brazil are studying a 
bilateral agreement for the confiscation of goods, aimed at 
punishing those involved in drug trafficking and financial 
crimes. It will be an unprecedented treaty, the likes of which 
Brazil has never before signed with any country. This is one of 
the results of the hectic visit that British Foreign Secretary 
Douglas Hurd paid from 5 to 8 April to Sao Paulo, Rio de 
Janeiro, and Brasilia. Preparations for the extradition treaty, 
which was prompted by the busy presence of entrepreneur Paulo 
Cesar Farias in London, are on their final stage. There are 
only a few details to be adjusted over the next few days by 
Brazilian Ambassador Rubens Barbosa and the British Foreign 
Office. 
  According to Barbosa, Hurd, who visited Brazil accompanied 
by 
representatives of six British enterprises, was -- upon his 
return -- enthusiastic about the prospects for cooperating with 
the Brazilian privatization program. In Sao Paulo, Hurd had a 
productive meeting with Sabesp [expansion unknown], which is a 
state-run water supply enterprise that is being opened to 
private capital. There was also a promise for possible British 
contribution to the Tiete-Parana waterway. 
  During his stopover in Rio de Janeiro, Hurd heard a proposal 
to create a Brazilian-British entrepreneurial council, following 
the model of a council that the Brazilian Government has with 
Germany. "We are at the final examination phase here with the 
Department of Commerce and Industry. We also talked about the 
transfer of technology from British to Brazilian enterprises," 
the ambassador explained. 
  In Brasilia, in addition to an unscheduled meeting at the UK 
Embassy with Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Hurd was surprised at 
the Ministry of Mines and Energy when he learned that the 
privatization program for the Brazilian electric power sector is 
based on the British model that was implemented four years ago. 
"The model is being examined for use in Brazil," the ambassador 
said. He added: "The point is the transmission, how the private 
sector will engage in power transmission. We agreed to send 
more information from here for the final phase of the Brazilian 
privatization program in the electric power sector." 
  Hurd's visit gave new momentum to some bilateral agreements. 
The double taxation and investment protection agreements are 
very close to being concluded and signed. Next week, from 20 to 
22 April, a Brazilian delegation will come to London to talk 
about the guarantees for pound sterling investments. "It is an 
agreement that we are negotiating with six or seven countries, 
like Chile, Korea, Germany, Switzerland, and France," Rubens 
Barbosa explained. The agreement was prompted by the lack of 
formal protection, which has prevented major investments. This 
is what Brazil is trying to avoid.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Under the Shade of Suspicion"] </F>
  [Text] When he was informed about what was happening in 
Rome regarding his wife, Cesar ignored the rumors and did what 
the law allowed him to: He publicly repudiated her under the 
allegation that "Cesar's wife" could not even appear as a 
suspect in conjugal infidelity. No evidence was required: Mere 
suspicion called for a public justification. 
  The episode about Cesar repudiating his wife, which remains 
an example, is always recalled whenever the border between the 
law and ethics seems undefined. In the case of Governor Nilo 
Batista, however, the fact that his name appeared on the numbers 
game list does not embarrass him. He insists on not feeling 
morally prevented from commanding the investigation that seeks 
to dismantle the illegal game network in Rio de Janeiro. And, 
crowning his attitude, he confirms that he will not leave his 
position. 
  Society expected the governor to consider himself a suspect 
after Castor de Andrade's list was released. The law does 
contemplate this sort of situation, but one's morals should not 
compromise matters of principles. Government authorities must 
set the example recommended by ethics even if the law does not 
call for it. 
  All subterfuges converge in the same direction: those 
involved feel uncomfortable in the company of celebrated numbers 
game kingpins and deny the fact, just for the sake of denying 
it, because they count on the law's formalities that make it 
difficult to identify and punish organized crime, particularly 
crime hidden behind the facade of simple infractions. Drug 
trafficking; arms smuggling; holdups of banks, armored vehicles, 
and homes; kidnappings; and moving large amounts of money are 
behind the numbers game facade. 
  Society has been surprised only at how few names are 
included 
on the numbers lottery kingpins' list. It was common knowledge 
that most of the other names on the list had links with the 
illegal game. Society was aware of everything, including that 
several members of the Military Police and the civil police had 
associations with organized crime. All that was missing was the 
link between the different criminal activities. 
  The mafia organization's unity was destroyed as a result of 
charges pressed by the accountant for the numbers game's highest 
capo. The situation was inverted: The district attorney acted in 
an explosive manner and, in a surprise operation, seized 
material that involves many of those who made common cause with 
organized crime. The investigation has started and foretells a 
lot more ammunition. 
  The crime universe that controls Rio de Janeiro's life, 
under 
the protection of some policemen and the involvement of some 
politicians, has begun to crumble. It makes no difference 
whether the numbers game donations were made to candidates: 
Those who have been elected also have been contaminated. Money 
allegedly from numbers game bets is also the money from 
kidnappings, drug trafficking, and bank holdups. It is morally 
unacceptable, although the evidence found so far still does not 
comply with the formal inflexibility of the laws from the legal 
point of view. 
  The Federal Police's own involvement shows the ramifications 
of organized crime in Brazilian life. Wherever the numbers game 
operates -- it functions countrywide -- politicians accept 
bribes because the electoral law does not force them to report 
where these donations come from. Despite all that, those who 
accept dirty money cannot claim they did it in goodwill. The 
first step into illegality is to accept money for which no 
receipt can be issued. It is not a donation, it is tax evasion, 
and it is therefore a crime. Public people cannot commit tax 
evasion crimes. The amount of money, the extent of crime that 
is destroying Rio de Janeiro inside, the widespread sense of 
insecurity, and corruption -- which involves even the civil 
police, the Military Police, the Legislative Assembly, and 
national Congress representatives -- cannot be fought with 
rhetorical antidotes. To say that what has been revealed is 
staging a political coup is to disrespect public opinion and the 
people's right to information and to judge those involved in 
these crimes. 
  Society wants action and not subterfuges. Society wants real 
guarantees and not fictitious ones. Something will have to be 
done in addition to investigating names and the amounts 
received. The citizens want an initiative to dismantle organized 
crime in Rio de Janeiro and are waiting for a sign from above. 
If the order is not given by the local administration, let 
Brasilia order action against crime and against all of its 
central commands, not only against the sources that supply the 
money. Crime is being morally condemned but no firm measure has 
been adopted to end crime, disarm the criminal groups, and 
dismantle the organizations in charge of holdups and kidnappings. 
  It is not important to know the name of the legal operation 
for which Rio de Janeiro has been waiting. It is not important 
to know where the order to fight crime comes from. The people 
expect that the authorities detect the signs of general 
insecurity and translate them into direct action against crime. 
The people will see in a good light any initiative President 
Itamar Franco might adopt to eliminate organized crime in a 
state that does not deserve to suffer what it has been suffering.

  [Text] The Brazilian Labor Party [PTB] has joined a group 
of political parties that is seeking to form a front to back the 
presidential candidacy of former Finance Minister Fernando 
Henrique Cardoso. Following the withdrawal of Senator Jose 
Andrade Vieira's candidacy, the PTB is joining the coalition 
sponsored by the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party], which 
aims to promote Cardoso's election. In addition to the PTB, 
with which an agreement was concluded yesterday, the PSDB is 
already counting in practice on the support of the PFL [Liberal 
Front Party] and the PP [Popular Party]. 
  The consolidation of this big front will require, however, 
further political negotiations. Andrade Vieira was offered the 
Labor Ministry, but he has not yet accepted. PP President 
Alvaro Dias said that the PP "will support Cardoso only if the 
alliance does not collide with the interests of PP candidates 
for state governors." 
  The PSDB is facing a growing internal opposition to an 
alliance with the PFL. Senator Mario Covas, PSDB candidate for 
governor of Sao Paulo State, has again criticized the proposal 
to nominate a PFL member as Cardoso's running mate. Some PSDB 
mayors -- such as Lidice da Mata of Salvador and Paulo Hartung 
of Vitoria, among others -- have conveyed their heightened 
opposition to the PSDB leaders themselves by bringing into focus 
some regional political problems they characterize as 
insurmountable.

<F P=106> [Article by Sonia Carneiro] </F>
  [Text] Brasilia -- Pressured by the threat of a rift, PSDB 
[Brazilian Social Democracy Party] President Tasso Jereissati 
ordered a nationwide survey -- which should be ready in one week 
-- on the feasibility of the alliance with the PFL [Liberal 
Front Party] from an electoral viewpoint. Under his 
coordination, and with the help of Ceara Deputy Sergio Machado, 
the PSDB national board will make a chart showing the prospects 
for regional alliances, which are essential for the success of 
the presidential candidacy of former Finance Minister Fernando 
Henrique Cardoso. Based on the result, the alliance will be 
either strengthened or discarded. 
  "If the incompatibility index is very high, the alliance 
with 
the PFL will not be worthwhile," Jereissati said. He added that, 
based on the survey results, a decision will be made as to 
whether PFL Bahia Deputy Luis Eduardo Magalhaes has the most 
appropriate profile for running as vice president on Fernando 
Henrique Cardoso's ticket. "There is still a long way to go," he 
added. 
  The survey will not break the negotiations over a common 
government program, which the two parties will begin studying on 
11 April. Jereissati added that the PTB [Brazilian Labor Party] 
and the PP [Popular Party] -- which also might join the alliance 
-- will be called to debate the common program. He ruled out the 
possibility of creating another Democratic Alliance -- an 
agreement between the PFL and the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic 
Movement Party] that sponsored the candidacy of Tancredo Neves 
in 1984 and the government of Jose Sarney. 
  For example, in order to harmonize the situation in Bahia, 
Neves gave two ministerial posts to the divergent movements, 
Antonio Carlos Magalhaes for the communications portfolio and 
Waldir Pires for social security. "It was the time to come out 
of the dictatorship, but the situation is different now," Deputy 
Sigmaringa Seixas said with dissatisfaction. "How will I explain 
to my grass roots the alliance with Antonio Carlos Magalhaes?" 
To this Jereissati replied by saying: "Protests always come 
from the same people." In Jereissati's opinion, "convincing 
political adversaries" reflects democratic progress. 
  There might be more than 14 states in which the PSDB 
leadership considers the alliance with the PFL is impossible. 
Bahia, Piaui, Maranhao, Rondonia, Roraima, Santa Catarina, Rio 
Grande do Sul, Ceara, Paraiba, Sao Paulo, Mato Grosso do Sul, 
Goias, Parana, and Rio Grande do Norte are considered the most 
difficult cases. Negotiations are under way in Pernambuco, Sao 
Paulo, and Amazonas.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Brazil monitored through 14 
April: 
  The Brazilian car manufacturing sector produced 140,000 
units 
in March. This is the highest monthly production figure in 40 
years. Executives of the sector expect production in 1994 will 
surpass that of 1993, which amounted to 1,391,000 units. (Rio de 
Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL in Portuguese 6 Apr 94 Business and 
Finance Section p 6) 
  Brazilian Petroleum Corporation, Petrobras, has signed a 
contract with Central Puerto -- a private Argentine company 
which supplies 40 percent of the electrical energy consumed in 
Buenos Aires -- for the supply of 2.7 million barrels of fuel 
oil. The deal is worth $45 million. The fuel oil will be 
delivered between May and September. Alberto Guimaraes, 
Petrobras assistant superintendent for foreign trade, has 
reported that the profile of Brazilian crude oil imports has 
changed and that Argentina has become our second oil supplier. 
He added that between January and March, Brazil imported crude 
oil from the following countries: Saudi Arabia (150,000 barrels 
per day); Argentina (110,000 barrels per day); Kuwait (80,000 
barrels per day); and Algiers (70,000 barrels per day). In 
1993, Petrobras imported an average of 500,000 barrels per day 
of oil and 280,000 barrels per day of oil byproducts. (Rio de 
Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL in Portuguese 9 Apr 94 p 6)

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 14 Apr (PL) -- Argentine President 
Carlos Menem welcomed Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina 
here in the first activity of Robaina's official 48-hour visit, 
which the two described as very positive. 
  Robaina, who met for nearly an hour yesterday with the 
president at his "Olivos" residence on the outskirts of this 
capital, said that the meeting was "useful, positive, and 
friendly." 
  Acting Argentine Foreign Minister Fernando Petrella, who 
also 
attended the meeting, told PRENSA LATINA that the Cuban 
minister's visit is "very significant, successful, and 
important." 
  In statements to reporters, the Cuban foreign minister, who 
also met with the Senate president and the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee, pointed out that "there are many more 
things that unite us than separate us." 
  Regardless of our differences, which stem from our different 
political systems, the meeting with the president at all times 
focused on the common ground in Cuban-Argentine relations, he 
added. 
  During the meeting, the Cuban foreign minister explained to 
the president the current situation in Cuba with emphasis on 
economic aspects and informed him of how Cubans are tackling 
their difficulties. 
  Robaina and Menem reportedly also discussed the 
opportunities 
for Cuba and Argentina to promote Latin American integration. 
  PRENSA LATINA learned that the president suggested further 
exchanges between the two Foreign Ministries and proposed a trip 
to the island by Argentine businessmen to survey current 
conditions for investment and trade. 
  After meeting with Menem, the chief of Cuban diplomacy gave 
a 
lecture on Cuban foreign policy to a large group of Argentine 
and foreign diplomats at the headquarters of the Advisory 
Council on International Relations (CARI). 
  Robaina, who was declared an "illustrious visitor" by the 
Buenos Aires Deliberative Council yesterday, later met with 
partners of the Commodity Exchange in this capital, with members 
of the Cuban community living here, and with leaders of the 
Grand Front Leftist Coalition, among other activities. 
  The Cuban foreign minister arrived from Peru yesterday after 
visiting Uruguay and will meet today with Deputy Economy 
Minister Carlos Sanchez, businessmen of the Chamber of Commerce, 
Industry, and Production, and with the Foreign Relations 
Committee of the Argentine Chamber of Deputies. 
  He will also meet separately with former President Raul 
Alfonsin, leader of the Radical Civic Union, and with the 
Socialist Unity (US) leadership. 
  Robaina will head for Paraguay tomorrow. His visit will 
conclude today with an activity organized by friendship and 
solidarity groups, which are demanding an end to the U.S. 
blockade against Cuba and respect for the country's 
self-determination.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 14 Apr (PL) -- Cuban Foreign Minister 
Roberto Robaina concluded a 48-hour visit to Argentina today 
with a meeting during which he thanked participants for their 
solidarity with Cuba and assured them that Cubans will resist 
until they win. 
  Robaina stressed during his speech that Cuba's independence, 
sovereignty, right to speak for itself, and other principles are 
not negotiable. 
  When introducing Robaina, Monsignor Pedro Padura, bishop of 
Rosario, reiterated the Argentine people's solidarity with Cuba 
and encouraged the Cubans to continue "tending their garden of 
hope." 
  Robaina responded by saying that his fellow countrymen know 
how to tend that garden with "their sweat, their hearts, and 
their very lives if necessary." 
  The event was held in a theater in downtown Buenos Aires and 
attended by more than 1,000 people. It was organized by the 
Solidarity With Cuba group made up of dozens of friendship 
societies from various sectors. 
  The Cuban leader spoke at length of the current situation in 
Cuba, denounced the U.S. blockade, and expressed his 
appreciation for international solidarity with Cuba. 
  Regarding the anti-Cuban campaign focused on the alleged 
violation of human rights on the island, Robaina strongly 
rejected those accusations and said there are millions of people 
in the world who have no rights at all. 
  There are millions of people, Robaina stressed, who cannot 
read or write those two words (human rights). 
  Robaina met yesterday with Argentine President Carlos Saul 
Menem during a meeting the two leaders described as positive. 
Robaina also met with members of the Senate and Chamber of 
Deputies foreign affairs committees, held two working sessions 
with acting Foreign Minister Fernando Petrella, and met with 
Deputy Economy Minister Carlos Sanchez. 
  The distinguished guest also spoke of "investment and trade 
with Cuba" at the headquarters of the Argentine Chamber of 
Commerce and discussed Cuba's foreign policy with members of the 
International Relations Council (CARI). 
  Robaina was declared "illustrious guest" by the Buenos Aires 
Study Council [Consejo Deliberante de Buenos Aires] and met with 
former President Raul Alfonsin, leader of the Radical Civic 
Union, and members of the broad front coalition and the 
socialist union. 
  Robaina also met with Cubans residing in Buenos Aires.

  [Text] Lima, 10 Apr (PL) -- Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto 
Robaina arrived in this city today in continuation of his tour 
of South America. He said, just as he did during his previous 
travels to other regions, he has encountered understanding and 
respect throughout this trip, which is what Cuba expected. 
  During an interview with PRENSA LATINA, Robaina said the 
objective of his trek is to communicate with the Latin American 
community, of which Cuba is a member despite those who have 
tried to tear her away from it. 
  After describing some of his previous tours to Africa, Asia, 
and the Caribbean, he said Cuba, by no means, is dragging its 
woes around the world, as some have said; on the contrary, Cuba 
has many things to offer, as a result of her progress in the 
fields of science, technology, education, tourism, and others. 
There are many other nations interested in these achievements, 
which pave the way for integration and trade. 
  Regarding Cuba's efforts to resolve its current problems, 
Robaina spotlighted the opening of new areas to foreign 
investment, in which Cuba has the raw materials but lacks the 
capital, the technology, and the markets. 
  When asked about the importance of the scheduled "The Nation 
and the Emigre Community" conference, to be held in Havana, he 
said this is just another event that has no bearing on the 
country's survival, because that is related more to the people's 
efforts to resist and to their unyielding determination. 
  The meeting is directed more at promoting relations with the 
emigre community, he said. He refused to comment on the 
hysteria the meeting has triggered among extreme right-wing 
sectors, as this hostile activity only confirms how appropriate 
the meeting is. 
  Regarding the minuscule groups promoting such activity, he 
said simply one can only tell the truth about Cuba through the 
difficulties and needs, and those who have profited from these 
needs do not even deserve acknowledgement. 
  His first event in Peru, where he arrived after visiting 
Uruguay and after a short stop in Buenos Aires, was a meeting 
with almost 100 Cuban physicians, sugar industry technicians, 
and sports trainers working in Peru. He updated them on the 
current situation in Cuba, the efforts to overcome the problems, 
and the need to represent and defend the nation with strong and 
credible arguments. 
  He told PRENSA LATINA that while he was in Argentina he 
stressed the fact that each Cuban represents the island. He 
took advantage of the stopover in Buenos Aires to meet Cuban 
troubadour Silvio Rodriguez, who is touring the Argentine 
capital. Robaina said singing to the Argentines is another form 
of foreign policy, because Rodriguez is telling everyone about 
the Cuban situation through his songs. 
  The Peruvian newspaper LA REPUBLICA, in an interview with 
Cuban physician Dr. Milvio Ramirez, highlighted the importance 
of Cuba's activities of cooperation. Ramirez is a heart surgeon 
who has performed more than 100 operations in the northern city 
of Chiclayo, 780 km from Lima.

<F P=106> [By special correspondent Manuel Robles Sosa] </F>
  [Text] Lima, 11 Apr (PL) -- Foreign Minister Roberto 
Robaina held an open and frank discussion today with 
approximately 100 Peruvian businessmen on the needs, 
perspectives, and difficulties with foreign investments in Cuba. 
  During his first day of official activities in this South 
American country, Robaina, who arrived yesterday in Lima, 
outlined his country's situation, problems, and current interest 
in foreign investments. 
  He said investments must fulfill the needs of capital, 
technology, and markets within a plan in which Cuba provides raw 
materials, qualified labor, and infrastructure. 
  Robaina added his country is perfectly aware of the need to 
create conditions of trust and safety for investors, for which 
it has already established the prerequisite legal framework. 
  The head of Cuban diplomacy stated his remarks to 
approximately 100 businessmen who have invested in Cuba despite 
various obstacles, including the ones concerning the fact the 
island is learning and adapting to new circumstances. 
  Robaina also reviewed the U.S. blockade, saying Washington 
is 
determined to exert pressure on investors so they will desist 
from investing in Cuba. The visitor said: Eight of every 10 
businessmen who want to do business with Cuba become discouraged 
for this reason. 
  He said his country does not discriminate against the source 
of foreign investments, but it certainly gives priority to the 
ones coming from Latin America, because this region is part of 
its history and geography. 
  The Cuban foreign minister also referred to his country's 
daily problems and the efforts to forge ahead amid great 
problems. 
  We do not care whose model it is; we only want it to be 
Cuban 
and feasible, said Robaina, who ruled out a possible automatic 
transfer of experience from other states to the island, although 
he said his nation takes the good things from others. 
  The Cuban minister's statement led to questions from the 
Peruvian businessmen. The questions indicated their interest in 
possible investments in Cuba and their doubts about 
transportation, investments, financial operations, and other 
issues. 
  Robaina is visiting Peru during a Latin American tour which 
includes Uruguay, Argentina, and Paraguay. His agenda here, 
until tomorrow, includes meetings with Efrain Goldenberg, 
foreign minister, and Jaime Yoshiyama, president of the 
Democratic Constituent Congress.

  [Text] Asuncion, 15 Apr (PL) -- Cuban Foreign Minister 
Roberto Robaina met with government, legislative, and political 
party representatives during a working visit here made at the 
invitation of the Paraguayan Foreign Ministry. 
  The high-ranking Cuban official met first with acting 
Foreign 
Minister Oscar Cabello, to whom he explained the available 
options regarding the island's economy. 
  The two also discussed the issues that will be addressed at 
the extraordinary National Assembly meeting on 1 May, the 
recently concluded debates by the Cuban workers on the economic 
situation, and other matters in the country. 
  Robaina then met with members of the local legislature's 
health committee, who expressed interest in the possibility of 
securing products from the Cuban pharmaceutical industry since 
the value of such products was determined during a recent visit 
to Havana. 
  The visiting foreign minister then met with the following 
political party leaders: Manuel Benitez, Radical Authentic 
Party; Eugenio Sanabria, ruling National Republican 
Association-Colorado Party; Guillermo Caballero, National 
Encounter Party; and Senator Victor Sanchez, February 
Revolutionary Party. 
  Robaina was also received by acting Senate President Carlos 
Romero, who was accompanied by members of the legislature's 
foreign relations committee. 
  Reporters and photographers from local media covered the 
arrival of the chief of Cuban diplomacy in this capital, and 
Robaina granted exclusive interviews to many of them.

<F P=106> ["Text" of speech by General Raul Castro Ruz, minister of </F>
the Revolutionary Armed Forces, commemorating the 33d 
anniversary of the proclamation of the socialist nature of the 
Cuban Revolution and Militiamen's Day, in Guantanamo on 16 April] 
  [Text] Guantanamo, 16 Apr (PL) -- For many years we have 
celebrated in La Cabana Fortress in Havana the 16 April acts to 
commemorate the eve of the victorious Bay of Pigs clashes, the 
proclamation of the socialist nature of our revolution, and 
Militiamen's Day. 
  Today, we are having celebrations in "Mariana Grajales" 
Revolutionary Plaza, in front of the monument to this mother of 
the fatherland -- this exemplary woman who wrote a unique epic 
for her people with her life and the lives of her children, whom 
she fed with the milk of heroism. 
  What better place is there than this one, where Mariana 
calls 
on us to kneel and swear to defend the freedom of the fatherland 
or to die for it, and where she orders us to stand up and march 
to Camp Mambi, like she did with all her children, even the 
youngest one? 
  And what better territory is there than this one, the heroic 
east, birthplace of our revolutions, Guantanamo Province, where 
there is no beach, path, valley, or mountain that does not 
deserve glorious mention in our country's history? 
  For the glorious deeds of the Mambises people in last 
century's three wars against the colonial yoke. 
  For the most tenacious and successful struggle by peasants 
for their land, the 18 possessions of the crown [el realengo 18]. 
  For the solid support that it gave our guerrilla column to 
found and extend the 2d "Frank Pais" Eastern Front, giving us 
its best sons, sending us ammunition and all sorts of supplies, 
surrounding us for nine months with their uncompromising support 
until the 1 January triumph. 
  For its contribution to the victory at the Bay of Pigs. 
Perhaps not enough has been divulged about the fact that the 
mercenaries sent to land on the coast of Baracoa were to open a 
front to divert us from the main thrust of the attack, but they 
did not dare step on Guantanamo soil, where a decided and alert 
people in arms were waiting to annihilate them. 
  Faithful to their tradition of rising to the occasion in the 
face of danger and adversity, the people of Guantanamo, under 
government and party leadership headed by Comrade Juan Carlos 
Robinson, faced with courage, energy, and efficiency the 
devastating effects of the November floods. With the solidarity 
of the whole country and with state support they made their 
repairs in silence. Here, nature's catastrophe has served as an 
encouragement to work, and it has not been used as an excuse to 
not fulfill production plans or defense tasks. 
  We are also gathered to promote to higher ranks 33 
militiamen 
and reservists deployed in this province, who symbolize the 33 
years that separate us from the heroic Bay of Pigs and represent 
all of those throughout the country who today receive this 
well-deserved encouragement. 
  We are also gathered to hand over a replica of Maximo 
Gomez's 
glorious machete -- as in previous years -- to a group of 
writers, journalists, artists, and cultural institutions on 
behalf of the Revolutionary Armed Forces in recognition of their 
outstanding contribution to strengthening the country's combat 
capabilities and our people's patriotic and internationalist 
awareness. 
  It is of great satisfaction to decorate, in keeping with the 
Council of State decree, the heroic fighters and civilian 
workers of the border brigade, who in keeping with their duty, 
have many times risked their lives or have been mutilated in the 
minefields that surround the territory illegally occupied by the 
United States. To those who have fallen while fulfilling this 
risky mission, to First Lieutenant Arturo Ruiz Martinez, and to 
soldiers Raul Milanes Labrada, Roberto Navarro Hernandez, and 
Wilbert Vazquez Gamboa, I posthumously confer today the "Antonio 
Maceo" order. 
  They have offered up their budding lives, these brave 
youths, 
worthy followers of soldiers Ramon Lopez Pena and Luis Ramirez 
Lopez, who in past decades lost their lives because of 
treacherous bullets fired from the other side of the fence. The 
sacrifice of those who have been wounded or mutilated forever, 
the hard test of thousands of fighters and officers, who 
throughout the 30 years since the border unit was created have 
repeatedly guarded the fatherland, risking dangers and suffering 
the tensions of the border along the front -- all of this is 
part of the high price we are forced to pay because of the 
existence of this foreign military base on a part of our soil. 
  We have said and reiterated, from the very triumph of the 
revolution, that this base was imposed on the Cuban people by 
force, and we demand that it be dismantled and returned to Cuba. 
Its presence, in disregard of our people's manifest rights and 
their legitimate government, violates all norms of international 
law. It is a brutal act of arrogance by the empire. 
  Today this base, which is obsolete from a military 
viewpoint, 
constitutes an unnecessary expense that must be borne by the 
U.S. taxpayer. 
  To reduce its uncontrollable military budget, the United 
States has dismantled dozens of military installations in the 
United States and abroad. Nevertheless, it maintains this one 
as a source of constant provocation and humiliation against Cuba. 
  We will never renounce our sovereign right to this part of 
our island -- this part of our national territory. 
  We reiterate today what we expressed nearly a year ago in 
this same plaza: There is not one day in which we are not 
reminded that we have a dagger stuck in our country's side, just 
a few kilometers south of where we are now standing. We have 
never stopped believing that some day we may be able to remove 
this dagger in a peaceful and civilized manner in accordance 
with the principles of international law. 
  As everyone knows, our state's social system, as well as our 
military doctrine, dictates that we shall never become an 
aggressor that fires the first shot. 
  Everything we do to strengthen our defense is precisely 
aimed 
at making any aggression against our country a costly 
enterprise. Our defensive efforts constitute a deterrent that 
will make any war prohibitively costly and unwinnable and, at 
the same time, guarantee our people's peaceful and creative 
endeavors. 
  As long as we fail to achieve this legitimate and unyielding 
aspiration of recovering the territory now occupied by this 
base, our position is to avert incidents along the demarcation 
line between this area and the rest of the island. 
  As we stated several weeks ago, during the past year a 
climate of tranquillity has prevailed on both sides of the 
fence, and we are inclined to keep doing all that is necessary 
to maintain this atmosphere. 
  This is why we have taken and will continue to take all 
necessary measures to prevent any foolish attempts by those who 
want to leave the country by way of this route. 
  To try to cross through those densely mined fields on both 
sides of the fence, attempting to evade our checkpoints and 
patrols, is madness and, at the same time, an act of provocation 
against our country's security. 
  Two armies are deployed face to face on either side of the 
fence. Given the United State's permanent hostility toward our 
country and its illegal occupation of this part of Cuba, these 
two armies are not exactly friendly armies.

  [Text] Havana, 14 Apr (PL) -- The Cuban press today accused 
the United States of courting danger by preparing the largest 
military exercise in the Atlantic region, which represents an 
unusual increase of forces in the area. 
  GRANMA newspaper reports the increase of tensions due to the 
Agile Provider-94 joint exercises scheduled for 22 April-11 May, 
in a region which encompasses seven states in the southeastern 
United States. 
  The newspaper states that (according to Defense Department 
spokesmen) the exercise will include the participation of 
approximately 44,000 U.S. Army, Navy, Marine infantry, and U.S. 
Coast Guard personnel. 
  The report explains French and Netherlands units will also 
participate, and the maneuvers will be concentrated in the area 
of Camp Lejeune and Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and Fort 
Chaffee, Arkansas. 
  GRANMA reports that "Agile Provider will help lubricate the 
powerful war machine that the U.S. Atlantic Command represents. 
It includes the largest number of U.S. land, tactical air, and 
naval forces; and they will train together for the first time 
since its reorganization in October 1993." 
  The newspaper specifies that such a concentration of 
military 
troops, with high capability and combat readiness under 
conditions that are very similar to actual combat, represents an 
unusual buildup of forces in the area. 
  It adds that Agile Provider-94, the command's largest 
exercise, renews the United States' large-scale military 
activity just as the Fleetex 2-94 joint maneuvers will conclude, 
and at a time when the program foreseen for the Trade Wind 
maneuvers in the Caribbean Sea is scheduled to end. 
  The strange concurrence of the maneuvers and exercises in 
the 
Atlantic region once again proves that the "supplier" of dangers 
is truly "agile" when fulfilling its goals, the report concludes.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" article by Walfredo Angulo: "Summit Meeting or </F>
Little White House Games"] 
  [Text] Following successive failures in trying for decades 
to achieve greater control in Latin America, Washington is 
convening an inter-American summit in December at a time Latin 
American countries are seeking integration plans that do not 
include the United States. 
  In a message at the first meeting of Latin American 
presidents, including Spain and Portugal, in Guadalajara, 
Mexico, in 1991, Cuban President Fidel Castro stressed the 
significance of that meeting being the first one to gather Latin 
American heads of state and government without being convened by 
the White House. 
  Regular meetings have followed since July 1991 with the 
succeeding summits of Madrid (1992) and Salvador Bahia, Brazil 
(1993), conveying the unpostponable need for integration and 
regional unity on the brink of the year 2000. 
  The Caribbean Basin has not been excluded from the 
integration process, thanks to the creation of the Association 
of Caribbean Nations, which will soon hold a summit of heads of 
state and government. 
  Initiatives that exclude the United States, at a time a 
united Europe is emerging as a powerful economic rival, might 
have motivated President William Clinton to revive the old idea 
of the inter-American summits, tried for the first time almost 
40 years ago in Panama and coinciding with the 130th anniversary 
of the Amphictyonic Congress called by Simon Bolivar. 
  A general, Dwight D. Eisenhower, occupied the White House in 
1956, while for John Foster Dulles, who was then secretary of 
state, his obsession was to try and contain what he called 
Soviet expansionism in Europe, and with this same outlook dealt 
with the neighboring subcontinent at the First Inter-American 
Summit. 
  These were the years of splendor in Hollywood, the years of 
absolute U.S. leadership in the steel and automobile industries. 
South of the Rio Grande, dictators, armed and backed by 
Washington, led the destinies of numerous countries as if they 
were administrators of U.S. ranches. 
  These realities are offensive 40 years later, but are 
nonetheless absolute truths. A brief review of those who 
attended the Panama meeting in 1956 confirms the presence of 
nine generals and two colonels. 
  The list would have been longer if Peruvian dictator Manuel 
Odria, General Gustavo Rojas Pinilla from Colombia, Gen. Paul 
Magliore of Haiti, or members of the Honduran military junta had 
attended. 
  Men who evoke sad memories for Latin America sat beside Gen. 
Eisenhower -- dictators who were some of the most faithful U.S. 
allies stood out -- Fulgencio Batista (Cuba), Anastasio Somoza 
(Nicaragua), Rafael Leonidas Trujillo (Dominican Republic), 
Marcos Perez Jimenez (Venezuela), and Alfredo Stroessner 
(Paraguay). 
  The second summit called for by Lyndon Johnson and held in 
1967 in Punta del Este, Uruguay, was no less flattering, with 
four of the five South American generals. They represented 
Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay. Bolivian Gen. Rene 
Barrientos did not attend, and Haiti was represented by Francois 
Duvalier. 
  The noticeable U.S. interest in this meeting was to 
strengthen its failed Alliance for Progress and create an 
atmosphere of confidence with memories of the 1965 Dominican 
Republic invasion still fresh. 
  Johnson proposed to Latin Americans what he called a 
rational 
development program to reach "a dream of a renewed America" for 
the decade of the seventies. 
  Twenty-seven years after the Punta del Este summit, 
Washington still pursues the old postwar national security 
doctrine fostered by the White House, which served to prop up 
the area's military regimes and dictatorships. 
  But now the national security doctrine attempts to attain 
agreement in its foreign policy, interpreted as a hegemonic 
concept of democratic and economic development as well as 
internal security for the area. 
  Also left behind is Ronald Reagan's Caribbean Basin 
Initiative and the Brady Plan -- tariff reductions for Latin 
American products and a reduction of the government debt through 
privatization of state enterprises, respectively. 
  For Washington and for South Americans, former President 
George Bush's "Enterprise for the Americas Initiative" today too 
is a dead letter. Now the question is what new proposal will 
the United States make in the area of trade and financing. 
  For the time being, following President William Clinton's 
summons, he is known to want to open "a new era in 
Inter-American relations," according to his own words. 
  The U.S. President's probable bait will be the approval by 
the U.S. Congress of NAFTA between Canada, Mexico, and the 
United States, the main trump card to show visitors. 
  The Latin America that will be at the Miami summit will be a 
Latin America wishing to find solutions to its scourge of social 
inequalities, economic crises, and administrative corruption, 
situations that are a contradiction to the very essence of the 
weak democracies. 
  Despite this, the Latin American countries are beginning a 
slow integration process, the only route to solving their 
pressing problems, a joint unitary effort that has marked the 
steps of a difficult path. 
  If the intention is to improve inter-American relations, it 
is impossible to exclude any peoples of the area from these 
summits. 
  For U.S. Senator Jose E. Serrano, who is of Puerto Rican 
origin, no area leader can be excluded if one wishes to speak of 
consolidating democracies. 
  And for those who oppose Cuba's presence at the Third 
Inter-American Summit, the congressman says that no country on 
the subcontinent has the same system of government, and he asks 
himself: What is true democracy?

<F P=106> [By Maria Elena Gil: "Cuba and Grenada Normalize Bilateral </F>
Relations"] 
  [Text] Havana, 12 Apr (PL) -- Another chapter of the Cold 
War, which was brought over to the warm waters of the Caribbean 
Sea, has just ended with the resumption of diplomatic relations 
between Cuba and Grenada and the willingness of the two 
governments to resume bilateral cooperation. 
  Concurrent [concurrente] Ambassador Lazaro Cabezas presented 
his credentials to Governor General Sir Reginald Oswald Palmer 
in St. George's on 5 April and held official discussions with 
Nicholas Brathwaite, prime minister and foreign minister. 
  Cabezas, an ambassador stationed in Barbados and accredited 
to five eastern Caribbean countries, told PRENSA LATINA during a 
telephone interview that the reception in Grenada was 
surprisingly friendly despite many years without diplomatic 
relations. 
  "We felt all of Grenadian society recognizes the important 
contribution Cuba made during the government of Maurice Bishop 
(1979-1983) to the development of that small island," he said. 
  Government officials and professionals who studied in Cuba 
told Cabezas of the importance of Cuba's contribution in 
building the Point Salines International Airport, which has led 
to an increase in tourism, the giving of advice to the fisheries 
industry and health sector, and the offering of scholarships. 
  The Cuban diplomat said the governor general as well as 
Brathwaite conveyed to him their gratitude for past assistance 
and their interest in promoting new ties of cooperation, mainly 
in the public health field. In a visit to explore means of 
cooperation, the Cuban representative met with Phinsley St. 
Louis, health, housing, and environment minister, and Shirley 
Mcthlin, Foreign Ministry permanent secretary and law school 
graduate from Santiago de Cuba University. 
  Cabezas also met with executives of the Grenada Chamber of 
Commerce, whom he invited to participate in the meeting of 
Caribbean businessmen scheduled for June in Santiago de Cuba. 
  In the VIP book of visitors to St. George's Government 
House, 
the Cuban ambassador left a written testimony of "this historic 
day" during which Grenada and Cuba grew close again. 
  Bilateral relations reached their peak during the popular 
revolutionary government of Maurice Bishop, who was ousted and 
killed by a faction of his cabinet on 19 October 1983. 
  The United States launched a powerful military invasion 
against the small island seven days later under the pretext of 
rescuing U.S. citizens who were at St. George's. 
  The U.S. military occupation lasted a year and a half, and 
bilateral relations were frozen during the government installed 
under those circumstances. 
  Following the election of the current Grenadian Government, 
Cuba stopped questioning its legality in international forums, 
and Grenada lifted its objections of allowing Cuba into the 
Caribbean Tourism Organization (CTO). All of these actions can 
be considered a process of detente which culminated in the 
acceptance of the new ambassador's credentials.

<F P=106> [By Walfredo Angulo] </F>
  [Text] Havana, 15 Apr (PL) -- Cuba and Colombia have signed 
a document specifying numerous areas for future economic 
collaboration at the conclusion of a meeting of the Joint 
Commission for Economic and Scientific-Technical Collaboration 
[Comision Mixta de Colaboracion Economica y Cientifico-Tecnica]. 
  This document opens paths for exchanges to ensure that 
"relations between the two sister nations will be maintained 
with patience but without interruptions" Colombian Deputy 
Foreign Minister Andelfo Garcia said yesterday. It will produce 
reciprocal benefits in the areas of education, sports, culture, 
and science and technology, said Raul Taladrid, vice president 
of the State Committee for Economic Cooperation. 
  The agreement also outlines investment possibilities in the 
fields of tourism, mining, communications, aeronautics, and 
energy, and it embraces the possibility of exploring other 
fields such as fishing and textiles, among others. 
  It includes the marketing of Cuban medicines, particularly 
the Colombian purchase of the hepatitis-B vaccine and future 
negotiations for the purchase of the meningitis vaccine. 
  The document also confirms that an agreement will soon be 
reached by Colombian and Cuban university rectors during a 
meeting to be held in Havana in November. 
  The Colombian deputy foreign minister said he thinks that 
meetings between the Colombian and Cuban presidents in 
Cartagena, Colombia, and recent visits to his country by Carlos 
Lage, vice president of the Council of State, and Foreign 
Minister Roberto Robaina contributed to the current state of 
their bilateral relations. The issues of petroleum sales to 
Cuba and the debt that the island owes to this South American 
nation were not negotiated within the joint commission, Garcia 
reported. 
  The Colombian delegation also included the deputy ministers 
of education, communications, and environment, Antonio Jose 
Lizarazo, Jaime Uribe, and Eduardo Uribe, respectively, among 
other important officials. A protocol for collaboration in the 
field of education was signed yesterday and another one on 
sports is scheduled to be signed tomorrow.

  [Text] Havana, 9 Apr (PL) -- The Cuban Workers Federation 
(CTC) has announced workers will continue, beginning this month, 
to hold meetings to analyze measures to optimize economic 
efficiency. 
  The proposals were made during the so-called Parliaments in 
the Workplace, a process involving approximately 80,000 
assemblies in which more than 3 million workers participated 
between February and March in the country's workplaces. 
  Workers made many proposals for attaining profitability and 
economic efficiency in their respective enterprises to solve 
existing problems at that level. 
  Other ideas tied to national issues will be analyzed in the 
National Assembly of the People's Government during a special 
meeting on 1 May, a meeting aimed at drafting the general 
outlines on measures that need to be adopted to improve the 
Cuban economy. 
  Cuba is going through a stage of economic difficulties 
following the disappearance of the European socialist bloc 
(between 1989-1991) and implementation of the Torricelli Law, 
approved by the U.S. Congress in 1992, to heighten the siege 
against Cuba. 
  The continuation of these meetings will begin this month in 
selected enterprises and will extend to all Cuban workplaces 
during the second half of May. 
  The idea is to help, among other aspects, eliminate certain 
severe economic problems, such as an excess in currency of 
approximately 11 billion pesos (equivalent to the dollar 
according to the official exchange) and a 4.2-billion peso 
budget deficit. 
  During the May assemblies workers will analyze the 
application of the proposed measures to stimulate work 
productivity, methods of saving raw materials and fuels, as well 
as undertake new productions or services that are of social use. 
  These meetings will substitute current production 
assemblies, 
according to a CTC report quoted by the National Information 
Agency.

  [Text] Guaimaro, (Camaguey), 11 Apr (PL) -- Ricardo 
Alarcon, president of the Cuban National Assembly, said during a 
ceremony here that the National Assembly of the People's 
Government [ANPP] upholds the principles of the Constitution 
signed in this town 125 years ago. 
  Alarcon spoke after a ceremony commemorating the anniversary 
of the first Cuban Constitution, which was signed in this town 
during the independence war against Spain. The ceremony was a 
celebration of the origins of the Cuban nationality. 
  At Constitution Plaza in Guaimaro, some 500 km from Havana, 
Alarcon stressed the similarity between the current struggle of 
the Cuban people to maintain their social project and the ideals 
of the founding fathers who established the motherland. 
  Alarcon asserted that amid the difficulties Cuba is facing, 
the effort to perfect the Cuban socialist program is still 
pursued in difficult and unpredictable times. 
  Alarcon recalled that from the very beginning of Cuba's 
struggle to gain its independence from Spain the island was 
threatened by the ambitions of the United States, the same 
country that is now trying to smother the social system that was 
able to fulfill the dreams of the founding fathers. 
  He pointed out that following the historic principles of 
Cuban legislation, Cuban deputies will examine on 1 May the 
serious economic and financial problems of the island to seek 
viable solutions to improve the current situation. 
  Alarcon underscored that the constituent assembly of 
Guaimaro 
made provisions to guarantee the equality of Cuba as a nation 
and that of all Cuban citizens among themselves to achieve the 
national ideal: the homeland, "the same one that we defend 
today on an island besieged as in the past century." 
  Education Minister Luis Ignacio Gomez; Julian Rizo Alvarez, 
first secretary of the Cuban Communist Party in Camaguey; and 
Camaguey Mayor Evis Blas Gonzalez also attended the ceremony.

  [Text] Havana, 13 Apr (PL) -- The availability of electric 
generation systems in Cuba currently averages 50 percent of 
capacity and is not meeting the nation's demand for this vital 
energy source because a large number of plants are undergoing 
maintenance or repairs. 
  GRANMA newspaper today says that, under normal conditions, 
the island's generation capacity is 70 percent -- a level 
considered normal at the international level -- because no 
system operates full-time given the time needed for maintenance 
and the number of breakdowns. 
  The newspaper stresses that the country, despite its 
monetary 
limitations, already has the necessary funds and has already 
purchased spare parts and other materials to work on repairing 
the system. 
  The newspaper states that the demand for electricity 
increased significantly at different times during the day in the 
first quarter of 1994, compared with the previous quarter. This 
was attributed to many causes, particularly the use of electric 
stoves that are not in the best of operating conditions. 
  The newspaper stresses the importance of having national 
crude oil, which guarantees about 30 percent of electric power 
generation, particularly at the Maximo Gomez thermoelectric 
plant in Mariel and the Santa Cruz del Norte plant, both in 
Havana Province; the Rente plant in Santiago de Cuba Province; 
and the Jose Marti plant in Matanzas Province. 
  In addition, electric union specialists note that most of 
Cuba's plants came from the former Soviet Union and 
Czechoslovakia, and no spare parts have been received for this 
equipment since 1990. 
  Cuba has been able to maintain a certain response level to 
deal with unexpected breakdowns and scheduled maintenance. 
Nevertheless, it was reported that now 570 megawatts of the 
nation's production capability are affected by repairs to the 
plants, 821 megawatts are affected by breakdowns, and 372 
megawatts are affected by other other limitations. 
  Extended outages will begin to decrease throughout the 
country as soon as maintenance and other work concludes at the 
generating facilities, according to the source.

  [Text] Havana, 13 Apr (PL) -- Basic Industry Minister 
Marcos Portal reported that two-thirds of Cuba's electricity 
plants are out of service due to damage. 
  Portal held a news conference during which he referred to 
the 
causes for the abrupt increase in the number of power outages in 
Havana, where electricity was available for only four hours in 
most neighborhoods this Tuesday. 
  The situation is even worse in the countryside, especially 
because the available electricity is used for harvesting sugar 
cane (from December to April) on a priority basis. According to 
Vice President Carlos Lage, this activity will continue until 
May of this year. 
  Portal explained that a lack of foreign financing and 
technological dependency on the former Socialist bloc -- most of 
the country's electric plants came from the former Soviet Union 
and Czechoslovakia -- have led to a serious delay in the 
national electricity network's maintenance schedule. 
  As of 1989, the plants were able to generate power at 
80-percent efficiency with the remaining 20 percent out of 
service due to damage or for technical maintenance, which is 
normal compared to international practices, the minister stated. 
  The minister added that the country used to work with 
reserve 
stations, but that option is no longer available to us. 
  Up to May 1993, the industry was able to maintain a certain 
level of response to growing demand, Portal said, adding that 
the mechanical condition of the plants deteriorated during July 
and August. 
  On the positive side, Marcos Portal announced that 900,000 
tons of the 2.6 million tons of oil required to generate 
electricity the previous year was national crude oil, which 
allowed the country to save its meager convertible foreign 
exchange. 
  Due in part to greater availability of domestic crude oil 
and 
the foreign credits that have been obtained, Cuba will be able 
to allocate resources for the repair of thermonuclear plants and 
reach the second half of 1994 operating at 50 to 60 percent of 
capacity, the basic industry minister stated. 
  This would allow us, Portal said, to significantly reduce 
power outages during the day, but we would have to continue them 
at night, when the most electricity is used.

  [Text] Havana, 15 Apr (PL) -- The electricity deficit 
facing Cuba has no short-term solution, Basic Industry Minister 
Marcos Portal announced today. He maintained that the country 
will only be able to generate electricity at 60 percent of its 
capacity by December. 
  Speaking on television to a panel of journalists, the 
minister described the prolonged cuts as one of the gravest 
problems facing the country. 
  There may be solutions but there can be no miracles, Portal 
said. He added that there is currently no stable generation of 
electricity due to a lack of spare parts [aseguramiento 
material] for the thermoelectric plants. 
  The minister said that 66 percent of the electricity is 
generated in plants from the former Soviet Union and former 
Czechoslovakia, which disintegrated, and this led to an 
interruption in the procurement of spare parts in the past three 
years. 
  Portal also cited a lack of foreign currency, due to the 
current economic crisis, among the factors that have worsened 
the situation in this sector. 
  He reported that $3 million were allocated to the purchase 
of 
spare parts for the thermoelectric plants and $7 million to the 
generation of electricity in 1994. 
  Two small plants will be operational by end of year, one in 
eastern Cuban and the other near the capital, the minister added. 
  Portal said that limitations in this sector will not impede 
further implementation of development plans promoted by Cuba to 
overcome the serious economic problems currently facing it. 
  We have a new and powerful electricity system, he said, 
after 
pointing out that most Cuban plants were installed less than 25 
years ago. 
  Portal thinks that the use of national petroleum, a heavy 
crude with high sulfur content, is not the cause for breaks 
[roturas] at the hydroelectric plants, because its use only 
causes problems with the gas pipelines. 
  The use of national petroleum will save about $360 million 
this year. This represents 30 percent of total electricity 
consumption.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" article by Juan Triana Cordovi, PRENSA LATINA </F>
contributor and specialist at the Center for Cuban Economic 
Studies: "Changes in the Cuban Economy: Self-Employment"] 
  [Text] [no dateline as received] More than forcing the 
adoption of measures, cicumstances have compelled reflection and 
swift but cautious action in applying basic economic operating 
principles to the Cuban economy. 
  Within the ensemble of measures adopted so far, 
self-employment and the resolution that regulates it comprise an 
important step in stimulating and promoting each individual's 
creative initiative and in resolving a number of community 
problems that the state currently cannot resolve. Historically 
-- because of organizational reasons, lack of control, and the 
absence of alertness and rationale -- these problems have been 
resolved in neither an efficient manner nor in keeping with the 
community's needs. 
  This process of developing self-employment is a clear signal 
of flexibility and pragmatism. It expresses something deeper -- 
that is, to address and resolve economic problems through 
equitable methods without returning to administrative and 
bureaucratic styles that have already been shown not to work. 
  The measure's economic significance will be proven by its 
ability to absorb part of the official and unrecorded 
unemployment the economic crisis and adjustment measures have 
aggravated and will predictably aggravate in the future; to 
reduce the fiscal burden and its impact on the GNP; to stimulate 
small enterprises and services; and, in turn, to discreetly 
improve the people's standard of living. Moreover, this measure 
is greater than the sum of its parts; it is important because of 
the synergy it can generate when implemented along with other 
measures already in place or measures that will be implemented 
in the future. 
  We must not overlook that like every other economic measure, 
this measure, along with its benefits, will also generate a 
series of disagreeable effects that must be corrected in due 
time. 
  The following analysis is only a first draft of the study of 
a very new phenomena that ultimately and undoubtably will 
benefit the economy and Cuban society. 
  The promulgation of the decree-law overrides and somehow 
negates an old and tiresome controversy (in Cuba) concerning the 
theoretical question of whether or not monetary-commercial 
relations should be used to build socialism. 
  Consequently, the resolution on self-employment means 
promoting private initiative to satisfy the needs of the 
population based on market economy mechanisms. 
  Likewise, any automatic association between the existence of 
private enterprise and the market with social anarchy is also 
proven wrong by recognizing that order, organization, and 
control are key factors for the adequate functioning of this 
phenomenon. 
  Planning, organization, and control methods, as well as ways 
and means, cannot be based on a single or set pattern or be 
divorced from the community's reality. 
  Requirements from control mechanisms, state institutions, 
government, and the population (as clients) will be based on 
legal, economic, and health regulations, in accordance with the 
limits imposed by the market. Trying to establish prices, 
quantities, and the quality of production and services without 
taking into consideration the real economic needs would be a 
mistake. The idea is not to subordinate to the market but, 
rather, to use the market in a necessarily intelligent and 
flexible manner. 
  The liberties granted to local governments can play a 
significant role (nonadministrative) in creating 
socio-psychological and political conditions to encourage 
initiative and creativity to exploit the economic, political, 
and social reserves that this economic measure entails. In this 
regard, the regulations issued by the provincial government of 
the city of Havana can contribute to expanding and consolidating 
this new activity when contractual relations between 
self-employed workers and state enterprises (in other words, 
between socialist systems and systems of private ownership) with 
regard to the sale on consignment of products by the 
self-employed, rental of buildings or space within a building, 
and rental of space in public areas or places and sites of 
festivities and fairs. 
  Self-employment will be effective to the extent that the 
supply of products and services it generates is stable and 
systematic. This aspect is linked to sources supplying the 
products necessary for this activity. 
  The stability and authenticity of supplies is undoubtedly 
one 
of the aspects that could be questioned. A stable supply of 
component parts would be the result of a combination of personal 
resources obtained through legal individual efforts; local, 
territorial, and state efforts; and so on. The process must 
develop with state supplies and legal supplies obtained outside 
the free market and speculation. 
  It is relevant, however, to analyze some aspects that could 
become deterrents to growth in production and income that this 
law could promote. 
  The way in which the measure is explained in the resolution 
introduces a sense that it is possible that the measure could 
negatively affect the expansion of this activity, which is 
considered necessary in light of today's reality in the nation. 
  The total prohibition imposed on university professionals 
who 
are not allowed to work on their own could be a negative factor 
for the efforts to improve the country's economy, considering 
they represent a large number in relation to the size of the 
economy and their predictable structural reorganization. The 
Cuban state has always guaranteed professionals employment and a 
salary. Today, however, this is extremely difficult, and in 
some cases only a nominal salary can be guaranteed and graduates 
are not given jobs commensurate with their individual 
aspirations. 
  Authorizing these professionals to perform said duties 
would represent an alternate way of promoting the satisfaction 
of those interests, encouraging creativity, and their employment 
in tasks that would have a direct repercussion on the 
population. This would also signify an alleviation of the 
fiscal situation, although not significant. 
  If in fact the elimination of worker subsidies (because of 
the current economic difficulties) in proportion to the amount 
of the income is perfectly appropriate, it does not seem 
possible to implement at least in the near future, given the 
impossibility to corroborate the amount of earned income. 
  If in fact the prohibition for unemployed persons in areas 
with a deficit of state workers to accept such chores turns out 
to be explicable, it is not the adequate solution for such a 
deficit, and it introduces an external economic element as a 
solution for a problem that can be resolved within the framework 
of the economy. 
  The territorialization [territorializacion] of solutions is 
undoubtedly a fact that allows flexibility in the process. It 
can also turn into some kind of restraint, based on subjective 
interpretations of particular local situations. 
  For instance, the regulations of the provincial government 
of 
the city of Havana establish a suspension in the issuance of new 
self-employed work permits for producers of fast foods, 
collector-vendor of agriculture products, producer of dairy 
products, collector of raw materials, and chauffeur, all of 
whose tasks generate supply of goods and services that are 
scarce in the capital and impossible to provide through the 
state supply. 
  The law makes no reference to family work. Nevertheless, 
self-employed work in many of the permitted activities in fact 
tends to lead to family organization in its execution. 
  State control over the commercialization process, although 
necessary, could also become a factor of constraint, and it 
somehow contradicts the acknowledgement of the supply and demand 
mechanism to set prices. 
  In the meantime, the lack of reference prices in many 
activities or otherwise the general alteration of the relative 
price system established by the current situation questions the 
determination of the high nature of any price. 
  With regard to middlemen, the expansion of these tasks 
generates naturally the appearance of these occupations so in 
the future it would be preferable to regulate them. 
<H5>  The Economic Dimension of Self-Employed Work </H5>
  Time is still too short to quantify the effect of this 
measure in great detail. However, some reflections on this 
issue would be interesting. The measure is promulgated within a 
very complex context, in which the depth of the economic crisis 
gives it an apparent tactical character (which the very text of 
the resolution somehow asserts). 
  However, the character and dimension of this crisis, which 
exceed what is merely circumstantial and turn it into an event 
of deep structural importance, gives it a significance that 
exceeds what is simply tactical. 
  It, thus, has to do with the impossibility of enjoying the 
advantageous relations that the country had with the socialist 
sector, the need to insert itself into world economy, and the 
impossibility of upholding the socialist development that had 
been predominant throughout all these years, which has obliged 
reevaluating different types of socioeconomic methods to be able 
to maintain the achievements of socialism. 
  As long as the national economy is in the process of 
improving its efficiency and the government sector remains 
preponderant, self-employed work must become not only an 
alternative to supply, wherever it is insufficient, but also an 
economic activity which, due to its dimensions and the manner in 
which it relates to the rest of the economy, cannot be carried 
out efficiently by government production organizations. 
  In addition, the state's reorganization, which has to be 
implemented to augment said efficiency, will also oblige it to 
redefine sectors and types of production in this field and to 
readjust the forms of operation in accordance with efficiency 
parameters that are indispensable to survive and progress. 
Self-employed work is also a "mattress" that will help soften 
the negative effects of such readjustments. In this sense, it 
is good to point out that up to the first days of last December, 
there were, according to some estimates that have not been 
officially confirmed, approximately 100,000 self-employed 
workers throughout the country. 
  Should the average annual income be 5,000 pesos 
(undoubtedly a conservative figure), its impact on the GDP would 
amount to 500 million pesos; that is, about 5 percent of a 10 
billion [currency not specified] PSG [expansion unknown] budget. 
Should the predictions made by some officials who believe that 
there will be 300,000 self-employed workers in 1994 materialize 
and should we estimate an average annual income of 4,000 pesos, 
then the resulting 1.2 billion pesos, a very significant amount 
for the national economy, would represent 12 percent of the GDP. 
  In terms of employment figures, these potential 300,000 
self-employed workers represent 8.5 percent of the country's 
work force. In this case, however, we must take into account 
that there are some state workers included in this figure. At 
any rate, the amount is not insignificant in this scenario 
either. 
  Finally, we will have to consider the fiscal effect of this 
measure. Given the current estimate of the fiscal deficit and 
the fixed taxes levied on these activities, which average 36 
pesos in taxes per activity, collections will amount to about 
3.5 million pesos, which in turn increases the revenues of the 
secondary budget [presupuesto no significativo]. This is why 
tax collection must be reconsidered as far as conditions allow 
it. 
  Should tax collection reach 10 percent of total revenues 
created by this sector and using the aforementioned 1.2 billion 
pesos as a base, the difference with the collection level that 
is currently charging fixed taxes would be substantial, and the 
120 million [currency not specified] contribution to the budget 
would represent 3 percent of the current budgetary deficit. 
<H5>  The Political Effect </H5>
  The political meaning of this economic measure is not less 
important. Along with other internal measures such as the 
decriminalization of foreign exchange tenure and the 
reorganization of agricultural production methods, it would also 
mean the recognition of the starring role that the population is 
playing with regard to these changes, whether as subject or as 
object. 
  This creative initiative phenomenon by a population segment 
introduces a new and clear element to the shaping of the 
popularity of the economic politics of resistance and 
development that was implemented as a result of the worsening of 
the current economic crisis and broadens the concept of national 
unity. On that ground, such phenomenon can contribute to 
maintaining national consensus and the identification with the 
revolutionary project. 
  This contribution would be possible as far as the dynamics 
of 
this process serves as a demonstration, whereby the population 
will be able to understand that the material and spiritual 
well-being must be forged by the creative work and initiative of 
each one of us, without expecting that all our needs and 
expectations could be met by the socialist state, as has been 
the case so far. 
  These measures reintroduce an old economic policy: the 
relations among the individual, collective, and social issues in 
the pursuit of national interests. 
  The balance of this system of interests is vital for the 
economic reconstruction of the country. To assume that social 
issues can survive without considering individual interests is 
as old as falling into the old liberalism trap and accepting 
that what is good for the individual is also good for society. 
The same mistake would be made if collective and social issues 
were routinely identified. The balance among these three systems 
of interests lies in recognizing the place that each one of them 
occupies in the economic arena and in the national 
sociopolitical weave. This is a very difficult task that will 
require constantly using the trial and error test as a suitable 
identification formula. Time and the government's ability to 
work out this system of interests without affecting the dynamics 
of each one of us will allow us to evaluate the real 
connotations of this measure.

  [Text] Havana, 16 Apr (PL) -- The resources that Cuba needs 
to secure to implement many economic activities and that it 
needs for the next sugar harvest will depend on the fulfillment 
of the sugar plan, Carlos Lage, secretary of the Council of 
Ministers, has said. 
  During an analysis of the current harvest in three eastern 
provinces, Lage, who is also member of the Politburo of the 
Communist Party of Cuba, said that the final stage of this 
harvest (extended until June in certain regions of the island) 
demands great determination and strength from all workers, 
according to GRANMA. 
  "As never before, we need to meet our sugar production 
target 
[comprometida]," said Lage, who referred to the serious and 
costly limitations imposed by a lack of certain basic inputs, 
including spare parts for sugar harvest machinery, such as cane 
harvester-loaders [combinadas caneras y alzadoras]. 
  After explaining the causes for the reduction in electricity 
production in the country, he urged technicians, specialists, 
and leaders of the sector to seek local alternatives and 
solutions to maintain, even under the worst of conditions, an 
acceptable supply of sugar cane for the industry. 
  Cuba last year registered low sugar production (4.2 million 
tons) due to weather conditions and other problems, and is 
intent on increasing production to market and barter it abroad 
for multiple material resources that are indispensable to 
improving the economy.

  [Text] San Salvador, 15 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- The Salvadoran 
Army today admitted the existence of armed groups comprised of 
former guerrilla and Army members and said it is only waiting 
for orders from President Alfredo Cristiani to begin engaging 
them. 
  Deputy Defense Minister General Roberto Tejada Murcia told 
journalists the gangs were operating in Cerro Guazapa, north of 
San Salvador, and in Morazan Department, in the eastern part of 
the country. He claimed the Army has information concerning 
activities by dissidents of the Armed Forces and the Farabundo 
Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN), which became a political 
party in December 1993. 
  "The armed men have been spotted in different places 
throughout the country, but most of all in Guazapa," Tejada 
Murcia emphasized. 
  He said the Armed Forces have not begun moving against them, 
but he added, "they will be fought, if the president so orders 
it." Tejada explained that patrols to prevent this type of 
activity would fall under the guidelines of the National 
Civilian Police (PNC). 
  Following the signing of the January 1992 peace accords 
between the government and the then-guerrilla movement, the 
Salvadoran Constitution assigned the task of defending national 
territory to the Army and the task of safeguarding public 
security to the PNC. 
  The agreements also led to the dismantling of the FMLN 
military machine, which had approximately 8,000 armed men, as 
well as reducing the Army's military strength from approximately 
60,000 to 30,000 men. 
  Armed groups have kidnapped a number of farmers in Guazapa 
over the past few months, while in Morazan they have threatened 
to kill FLMN leaders. There also have been a number of 
robberies along the highways -- robberies in which anyone who 
resists is killed.

  [Text] General Luis Alonso Discua Elvir, chief of the 
Honduran Armed Forces, in statements to Radio America said that 
the maturity achieved by the Armed Forces cannot be put in 
doubt, adding he would prefer to resign than to harm Honduras. 
  According to Deputy Luis German Lagos, a member of the 
Innovation and Unity Party, data -- in the hands of the United 
Nations -- presented at a recent seminar on human rights in the 
United States indicate that President Carlos Roberto Reina could 
be a victim of a coup d'etat within a period of time not yet 
established. 
  Nevertheless, the military officer said that if the nation 
is 
entering a state of law and is initiating a phase of democracy, 
such an idea should not even be brought up. "If Gen. Luis 
Alonso Discua Elvir, commander in chief of the Armed Forces, 
were to propose this type of situation, I would prefer to resign 
from my post before breaking my oath to the Constitution and the 
laws," he said. 
  He said that this type of speculation "makes us lose some of 
the credibility we have achieved as a nation in the eyes of the 
nations of the world," adding that in Honduras the coup d'etat 
stage has been overcome and we are now on the road that all 
Hondurans wanted. He added that there have been attempts to pin 
negative aspects onto Reina's in order to harm his image. "It 
is certain we are a poor nation but we are also a nation with 
dignity, with an Armed Forces based on the nation's needs. 
"While I am at the helm of the Armed Forces such a monstrosity 
would not cross my mind," he stressed after recalling that "we 
have sworn before the Constitution of the Republic and before 
the altar of the nation our loyalty to the established 
governments." 
  Making reference to Deputy Luis German Lagos, Discua Elvir 
said that when an independent representative attends events 
sponsored by such organizations as the United Nations, he should 
be serious enough to weigh this type of information. "A number 
of hypothetical aspects and situations related to these 
countries were discussed there, he assured, after adding that 
these types of matters do not favor the nation. [sentence as 
published] 
  Likewise, he asked all Hondurans to "give their total 
support 
to President Reina's government for the nation to advance." 
Meanwhile, he recognized that the armed institution has many 
times voiced its opinion on matters of national interest, but as 
recommendations, adding that he personally conveys these to the 
president. 
  "It is shameful that our country is placed on the same level 
as African nations where presidents sill die, where there are 
coups d'etat." I believe that due to our proximity to North 
America where the headquarters of this important organization is 
located, this type of situation should not occur," Gen. Discua 
noted. "I want to tell the Honduran people and the whole world 
that at no time will the Armed Forces think of acting in such a 
manner... this was a matter of the past, these were historical, 
political moments. I do not think this should be repeated," he 
stressed. 
  According to him, the alleged conspiracy against the 
president and the accusations of a coup d'etat are the work of 
small groups that want to create distrust within the community 
toward their authorities. "They attempt to create a climate of 
anxiety and weakness within the community," the military chief 
charged. He recalled that Honduras is beginning a new 
government that faces a series of problems and the government 
does not have a magic wand to resolve the problems immediately. 
  "We are not in a position to resist, rather we are in a 
position to give the president all the support, all the loyalty 
he deserves as the nation's first authority," he noted. "I do 
not know where they want to take the nation. I believe we 
should be the architects of our own destiny, we should be the 
ones called on to resolve our own problems," he remarked. "I 
hope that we will not have situations similar to those in Mexico 
where a political leader dies; Guatemala where a high-ranking 
government official is murdered; and other nations where 
fratricidal leftist forces have emerged," he said. 
  Without naming names, Discua said these persons or 
institutions do not act like friends of Honduras, which is 
striving to come out ahead. He said: It is not true the 
military corps has diverted from its constitutional role; "we 
continue to support and maintain our institution's 
professionalism." 
  Discua added that, since all the institutions currently face 
a difficult situation, the Armed Forces are aware of their new 
role in a country that is immersed in a development and 
democracy process. The Armed Forces, and not just in Honduras, 
have a clearly defined framework where they must assume their 
responsibility; "and I have been clear, and sufficiently 
explanatory, with the president of the Republic," he said. 
  Discua thinks the military corps must be the backbone of the 
democratic system which prevails in Latin American countries; 
and they should not assume a leading role as in previous 
decades. "That must now be history; we had our role, but now we 
must all become involved in solving the country's problem. We 
are contributing our quota of sacrifice; we are assuming our 
responsibility; and, logically, we must guarantee the social 
welfare of our corps' members." 
  The Armed Forces chief emphasized he is responsible for the 
welfare of its members, and he must keep them trained and ready 
to counter any situation which taints, or tries to taint, the 
country's sovereignty or threatens its democratic system. 
  Later, the military commander said the Armed Forces have 
clearly defined their role for the future; and he asked 
Hondurans who became involved in the previous decade's Cold War 
to conduct a self-analysis and see exactly what happened. "I 
have always said that whoever tries to see the past is trying to 
return to the past," he said when asked if the accusations came 
from enemies of the armed corps involved in the 1980's 
confrontation. 
  The military corps looks ahead, toward the country's future, 
he said. "If the Honduran people were ever involved in the 
defense of an ideological position that was imposed on them, now 
is the time to stop and conduct a self-analysis to see exactly 
what happened," he demanded. Discua added: It was a cold war, 
a situation imposed on our country; and we became involved, in 
one way or another, because we believed it was the right thing. 
"However, if we continue to look back, some people might return 
to the past; but the Armed Forces are not in that situation -- 
we look ahead and we believe we have a great mission to 
accomplish, an important role to play," he emphasized. 
  Discua Elvir believes the Armed Forces have matured in their 
responsibility as an institution. "We should have always had 
that maturity but, due to external circumstances, it opposed 
many situations with which, perhaps, we never agreed."

  [Text] The Executive Branch and the National Assembly today 
agreed to work more closely with each other. Council members of 
five Assembly factions went to the presidential building to 
discuss with Minister Antonio Lacayo three points on which the 
two branches disagree but on which some progress was made today. 
One point is the procedures to create and eliminate taxes in 
the country. The two branches agreed to establish mechanisms to 
do away with unilateral decisionmaking. 
  [Nicaraguan Assembly President Luis Humberto Guzman] "The 
basic principle underlying the agreement is that the government 
presents fiscal policy proposals and the National Assembly will 
decide on the contents of the proposals." 
  [Lacayo] "It would be much better if these taxes are 
established by joint agreement, as mentioned by the Assembly 
president, and do away with unilateral decisionmaking." 
  Another point discussed was constitutional reforms. 
According to the Assembly president, the government is willing 
to cooperate on the promulgation of articles that would pave the 
way for the constitutional reforms. 
  [Lacayo] "If we can reach an understanding or an agreement 
next week, I do not see why President Chamorro cannot sign the 
proper document when she returns next week." 
  Lacayo said that today's meeting shows there is no crisis 
between the two branches but only disagreements that stem from 
the branches' independence. 
  [Lacayo] "May I stress that this disagreement can always be 
settled through dialogue. We made some progress in today's 
meeting, which we are concluding." 
  One result of the dialogue is that it was clarified today 
which obligations the government could sign with international 
banks. 
  [Lacayo] "We will never set down in an international public 
document an obligation in the name of another branch. We will 
set down the Executive Branch's will. But we will never commit 
neither the National Assembly, nor the Supreme Court of Justice, 
nor the Electoral Tribunal, to things to which only they can 
commit to." 
  He also said that the possibility of vetoing the Labor Code 
was not discussed and that the Executive Branch made a 
commitment so the Code benefits workers. He announced that a 
meeting with all Nicaraguan sectors will be held on Wednesday to 
discuss the ESAF [Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility] 
document and settle any remaining doubts. 
  [Lacayo] "Some drafts have been distributed. Some people 
have reacted to these drafts. We will share with them the most 
recent versions, which in some respects are more positive than 
the previous drafts." 
  Regarding the military organization bill, Lacayo said the 
government and the Army together intend to complete the bill 
before 25 April.

  [Text] Yesterday, the National Assembly created a 
Commission of Banking Operations that will prevent Nicaragua 
from becoming a haven for money-laundering by large drug 
cartels. The creation of this commission is discussed in 
Article 21 of the draft anti-drug bill on which debate continued 
yesterday in a full session of the legislature. 
  In the past two years, Nicaragua has been the victim of a 
strong assault by the drug cartels that want to overrun our 
territory, taking advantage of the current economic situation to 
institutionalize the laundering of drug money. 
  Article 23, which was approved yesterday, says, "The 
commission's goal is to study the different techniques and 
methods used to carry out all banking, financial, or related 
operations that facilitate the legitimization of capital derived 
from illegal activities." 
  According to this bill, banks -- private as well as 
state-owned -- must report to the commission any deposit whose 
total amount surpasses $10,000 in operations conducted by any 
single client. 
  If a person or institution is being investigated for 
suspicion of money-laundering, the bill mandates that the 
individual is not entitled to any banking or fiscal secrecy 
whatsoever. Banks are obligated to reveal to the respective 
authorities all bank accounts of individuals being investigated 
in cases concerning drug-trafficking or the laundering of money 
or valuable objects. 
  The aforementioned commission will comprise a banking law 
specialist, an auditor, an expert in marketing, and a member of 
the National Police Commission on Economic Crimes. 
  The anti-drug bill moved closer to passage yesterday in the 
wake of a great deal of pressure from police and the U.S. 
Embassy itself, as was disclosed by Congresswoman Doris Tijerino.

  [Text] Managua, 15 Apr (ACAN-EFE) -- Jose Angel Talavera, 
alias "Chacal," the leader of the 3-80 Northern Front 
"recontras," and more than 300 rebels in his group, surrendered 
their rifles to the Nicaraguan Government today, thus concluding 
the disarmament process of the anti-Sandinist rebels. 
  During the disarmament ceremony, which was held at the 
Quilali community that borders Honduras, Esteli Bishop Abelardo 
Matta invoked God and thanked Him for the rebels' decision to 
give up their weapons "for the sake of peace" in this part of 
the country. 
  The weapons surrendered by the "recontras," approximately 
150, included Soviet-manufactured AK rifles, pistols, several 
surface-to- air missiles, and other military materiel, were 
destroyed at the location of the demobilization ceremony. 
  The disarmament process of "Chacal's" men started on 2 March 
and continued on 25 March. On those dates, approximately 300 
"recontras" gave up their rifles and entered civilian life. 
Almost 100 demobilized rebels entered a police academy in 
Managua, where they will receive training in the fields of 
security and public order so they may, in the coming months, 
join police units in northern Nicaraguan municipalities. 
  A military source in Quilali, reached by telephone, told 
ACAN-EFE that chieftain "Chacal" surrendered his rifle and 
ratified his commitment to work "from the civilian field" to 
improve the living conditions of the now-demobilized "recontras." 
  The disarmament ceremony was attended by Government Minister 
Alfredo Mendieta for the government; Lieutenant Colonel Ricardo 
Wheelock for the Army; Bishop Abelardo Matta, who is the 
International Commission of Support and Verification 
coordinator; Argentine Sergio Caramagna; and human rights 
organization representatives. 
  The government and the rebels agree that now that the last 
phase of the 3-80 Northern Front's disarmament process has 
concluded, northern Nicaragua will initiate "a new phase of 
peace" and leave behind a war that left thousands of soldiers, 
civilians, and rearmed rebels dead or injured. 
  "Hopefully God wants this (the peace process) to advance so 
that we can find tranquility," Bishop Matta exclaimed. Matta is 
one of the representatives of the Catholic Church in the area 
who contributed to the signing of the peace agreement between 
the government and the rebels. The Catholic bishop, who 
expressed his satisfaction with the government's decision to 
create the necessary conditions "that would result in the 
successful" disarmament of the rebels, called on the country's 
authorities to promote true socioeconomic programs to avoid a 
new rearmament process. 
  The rearming of the rebels started in Nicaragua in 1990, a 
short time after Violeta Chamorro assumed office as president, 
when several thousand of the 22,000 former "contras" who had 
demobilized initially, rebelled because they considered that the 
government had not kept the promises it made to them to get them 
to reenter civilian life.

  [Text] Managua, 18 Apr (ACAN-EFE) -- Nicaragua today denied 
that it accepted terms "that harm national sovereignty" by 
signing an agreement with the IMF. The government, in turn, 
accused the Sandinists of having "mortgaged the country." 
  According to the government, the agreement with the IMF will 
give the country access to some $600 million to be used in 
structural adjustments and economic expansion over the next 
three years. 
  Presidency Minister Antonio Lacayo said in a news conference 
that "it can never harm national sovereignty to try to relieve 
the burden of foreign debt," estimated by several sources at 
more than $11 billion. 
  Lacayo, who is the son-in-law of President Chamorro and 
heads 
the economic and social cabinet, said the only government that 
has harmed national sovereignty "is the one that mortgaged the 
country," referring to the Sandinists, who governed the country 
from 1979 to 1990. Lacayo added that Chamorro's ministers have 
had to travel abroad to "rescue this sovereignty" by having the 
United States write off Nicaragua's foreign debt. He 
"categorically" rejected the Sandinists' accusations that the 
contents of the agreement with the IMF "were harmful to the 
country's sovereignty." Lacayo added: "We have also gone to 
rescue the sovereignty that was pawned to Mexico, Colombia, 
Argentina, Spain, the Nordic countries, and other Paris Club 
member nations. Each child born in Nicaragua wears an 
identification bracelet on one of his arms and a label saying 
that he owes $3,000 in foreign debt on the other arm." 
  The head of the Presidency Ministry confirmed that the 
agreement with the IMF was signed on Saturday and amounts to 
$140 million to be disbursed over a three-year period. This 
will allow the procurement of another $150 million, which the 
World Bank will lend to Nicaragua, co-financed by the 
Governments of Japan, Germany, Sweden, and Switzerland and which 
will be disbursed over the next 18 months. In addition, the 
Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) will grant other credits 
for health, education, and small enterprise, funds that would 
not have reached the country if the agreement with the IMF were 
not signed. 
  As for the other Sandinist charge that the agreement with 
the 
IMF violates the current Constitution, Lacayo said those who 
believe this may file constitutional appeals before the Supreme 
Court. The minister, who is sort of a coordinator for the 
Chamorro government, added: "We are not going to judge that 
because the government is not a judge in this matter." 
  Lacayo, as well as Finance Minister Emilio Pereira, Foreign 
Cooperation Minister Erwin Kruger, and Economy and Development 
Minister Pablo Pereira, among others, said that the $660 million 
that will reach the country this year will contribute to a 
reduction of the high interest rates in the production sector. 
They said that, although 13,500 bureaucrats will be dismissed 
in the next three years, public investment and producer credit 
will permit the creation of 84,675 new jobs in this country, 
where the unemployment rate is estimated at 60 percent. 
  The ministers said that this year monthly devaluations will 
be 1 percent, economic growth of 2 to 3 percent is expected, and 
7,500 housing units will be built nationwide. They also pointed 
out that signing the IMF agreement has led the Paris Club to 
plan a trip to Nicaragua in the first week of June to 
renegotiate the nation's foreign debt, the equivalent of more 
than 36 years of exports. 
  Lacayo, on the other hand, warned that the government "is 
prepared to respond to violent protests by those who reject the 
agreement, noting "that this path is the wrong one." 
  [Paris AFP in Spanish at 2310 GMT on 18 April in a 
Managua-datelined report adds: "The Nicaraguan Government will 
not pay the debt incurred by the Sandinist authorities to 
finance the war of the last decade and holds them responsible 
for the serious economic crisis that hinders the country, 
Presidency Minister Antonio Lacayo announced on Monday. He said 
that `the government will not pay' the war debt, without 
specifying the amount of the debt. He made the announcement 
during a news conference offered by the economic cabinet to 
explain the scope of an agreement signed with the IMF this 
weekend."]

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 18 Apr (NA) -- President Carlos Menem 
tonight denied suffering a heart problem during the past few 
hours, which, according to persistent rumors, obliged him to 
undergo an urgent operation. 
  "I am very well; that rumor must have been put about by 
someone who wants me to die," Menem said a few minutes ago from 
the Olivos Residence over the state television channel.

  [Text] (DYN-NA) -- Matilde Menendez, who resigned Tuesday 
from her seat on the newly-elected Constituent Assembly, stepped 
down as leader of the PAMI pensioners' health scheme yesterday. 
Meanwhile President Carlos Menem announced that she would be 
replaced by power workers' union leader Carlos Alderete. 
  Menendez has been under fire since a bribery scandal 
involving PAMI erupted late February when it was said that the 
organization had been demanding kickbacks from clinics hired to 
carry out medical work. 
  The initial complaint, filed by Frente Grande city 
councillor 
Anibal Ibarra, pointed the finger directly at Menendez for being 
personally responsible for the financial irregularities. That 
in turn led to a host of accusations against her in the 
politically sensitive moment of an electoral campaign. 
  Many observers said her position on the list of Justicialist 
candidates for election to the Constituent Assembly was a prime 
reason for the Peronist failure in the Federal Capital last 
Sunday. 
  However this latest development failed to placate Ibarra who 
said last night that Menendez should have "been forced to go 
long ago" and that the government was guilty of "keeping in 
office those who have been found guilty of corruption." He 
added that if the government had performed better in the 
elections Menendez would still be in office. 
  Meanwhile Alderete told reporters that he would work to 
stamp 
out "all types of corruption and neutralize any cases...if it 
turns out that there are any."

  [Excerpt] Buenos Aires, 15 Apr (NA) -- The Argentine 
Association of Newspaper Owners (ADEPA) today warned that "the 
main problem facing journalists in Argentina is: the threat that 
an eventual law excessively increasing penalties for slander 
might be left at the disposal of officials wanting to silence 
reports on corruption, which have regularly involved Argentine 
public figures." 
  The institution's concern is included in a report issued by 
the Freedom of the Press and Information Commission presided 
over by Jose Claudio Escribano that was unanimously approved 
during the deliberations of the 94th ADEPA semi-annual board of 
directors meeting that ended today. 
  The editors also unanimously and categorically rejected the 
"ethic tribunals imposed or suggested from the highest 
government levels. We reiterate that no journalism is possible 
without solid moral bases and the implacable daily judgment 
passed by readers and clients who do not hesitate to be 
categorical." 
  The report also discusses "the confusion over the meaning of 
journalistic criticism, the theory of real malice, Santiago del 
Estero's inadmissible situation in the distribution and sale of 
newspapers, the figure of the ombudsman, so-called contempt of 
court, and the investigation of attacks against journalists," 
among other things. 
  ADEPA recognized that "independent journalists are not 
necessarily against governments, but neither will they place 
themselves at their service, for they serve society." 
  ADEPA's board of directors started their meeting on 14 
April. 
On that occasion President Guillermo Ignacio offered his report 
and gave details on ADEPA activities since the Salta assembly in 
September 1993. 
  Ignacio's report includes details of his meetings with 
President Carlos Menem in October 1993 and January 1994. 
  He also referred to meetings with special fiscal prosecutor 
Luis Gonzalez Warcalde to learn about the progress of 
investigations into the attacks against journalists. The report 
gave details on steps taken with the Brazilian Newspaper 
Association to invite other Latin American press associations to 
form an association to represent them. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 18 Apr (NA) -- Guillermo Ignacio, 
president of the Argentine Association of Newspaper Owners 
(ADEPA), today maintained that independent journalism "is not 
necessarily antagonistic to the government that is in office, 
but it has not been conceived to place itself at its disposal," 
and he also flatly rejected the creation of a court of ethics. 
  Ignacio also expressed his concern about the draft law that 
is currently in the hands of Congress and has been approved by 
the Senate's Penal Committee. This draft law provides for "a 
six-year sentence for the crime of slander and damages, and from 
six months to two years for the illegal enriching of an 
official." 
  "The trouble is that President (Carlos) Menem occasionally 
makes these verbal outbursts on certain occasions and they worry 
the media. They are trying to penalize the crime of slander and 
damages in the same way that the Penal Code penalizes a homicide 
committed during a fight," he said. 
  Ignacio added that a court of ethics "only serves for the 
authoritarian censorship of the task of a professional who may 
not be on good terms with the management of a professional 
association or with the members of that court." 
  The ADEPA chief stated that the media submits "to the court 
that is made up of the people, and of course it is always open 
to action by the courts," and that "if this draft law is 
approved the country's press freedom will be doomed." 
  He said: "We have never demanded impunity for journalism, on 
the contrary, we have always said that there are no special 
types of press crimes, there are just common crimes that can be 
committed through the media." 
  In remark to a Buenos Aires radio station, Ignacio termed 
events in Santiago del Estero as "inadmissible because Labor 
Ministry Resolution No. 08/94 obliges the prior recognition of 
the Union of Sellers of Newspapers and Magazines in order to 
allow the distribution of the newspaper EL LIBERAL." 
  ADEPA expresses its rejection of the presidential initiative 
to create a court of ethics to control the media in a 10-page 
document in which the Press and Information Commission expounds 
all the reasons for concern regarding the possible gagging of 
freedom of expression.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 18 Apr (NA) -- A regular-intensity 
bomb exploded at a private mail service in this capital's 
Chacabuco Park area early this morning. No injuries were 
reported. 
  The explosion took place at the headquarters of the firm 
Transclair SRL at 1222 Cobo Avenue, near the corner of Centenera 
Street, at around 0100 local time. It damaged the establishment 
and adjoining buildings. 
  According to reports by neighbors, the attack is said to be 
the result of a "trade war" between companies engaged in the 
same trade. 
  One of the company managers, Antonio Gomez Dolzer, said: "We 
have received telephone threats for a long time. Some shots 
were even fired at the front of the building four months ago." 
  For reasons of jurisdiction, police Precinct No. 12 is 
conducting an inquest into this case. Federal Police bomb squad 
personnel were called when the explosion occurred.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 15 Apr (NA) -- Lieutenant General 
Mario Candido Diaz, the Armed Forces Joint General Staff [EMC] 
chief, stressed today that Chile "has a slight military 
supremacy over Argentina" at the military level, although this 
"does not represent any problem" because "a small imbalance is 
compensated for by good understanding and good relations." 
  The EMC chief described military relations with Chile as 
"superb" and emphasized: "They have been enhanced during the 
past few years thanks to bilateral contacts between politicians 
from the two countries." 
  In remarks to NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS news agency, Diaz 
emphasized the visit that Vice Admiral Patricio Arancibia Reyes, 
the Chilean national defense chief of staff, will pay to 
Argentina on 18 April. 
  The goal of Arancibia Reyes' visit is to enhance the mutual 
cooperation system existing between the two countries to face 
possible natural disasters in border areas. Therefore, 
Arancibia Reyes will hold various meetings with local military 
leaders. 
  Hinting at the tension over border disputes that had been 
marking bilateral relations for many years, Diaz said: 
"Fortunately, the distrust with which we have been living for a 
long time has disappeared." 
  Concerning the military side of bilateral relations, Diaz 
pointed out: "There is a total closeness [acercamiento] that 
has been enhanced with constant cooperation between the forces." 
He added that this mutual assistance "has allowed officers from 
the two nations to take refresher courses." 
  Diaz admitted that Chile "has a slight supremacy over 
Argentina at the military level." 
  Diaz said this point "does not represent any problem" 
because 
"a small imbalance is compensated for by good understanding and 
good relations." 
  The EMC chief emphasized that for the cooperation tasks that 
will be discussed during the meetings with the Chilean military 
officer, "Argentina will contribute with all the experience it 
has gained during the peace missions carried out throughout the 
world within the UN framework." 
  In this regard, Diaz added that the Argentine Armed Forces 
"have gained worldwide prestige thanks to these missions in 
which their high level of professional training was demonstr?ed." 
  Diaz later emphashat in the entire South American region 
there is a "total balance of forces," for which reason "peace in 
the area is guaranteed and a possible crisis is not being hinted 
at." 
  In this regard, Diaz stressed that relations with all the 
[South American] countries "are very good," especially with 
Brazil, Peru, Colombia, and Venezuela, with all of them the 
exchange of know-how has been increased. 
  Diaz said Mercosur [Common Market of the South]'s formation 
"has revitalized joint actions by the armies" of the countries 
forming it. 
  The general also explained that military relations with the 
United States "will be enhanced this year within the assistance 
program" and announced that Argentina "will receive 14 
helicopters that will be assigned to the Army." 
  Diaz added: "We also have scheduled a visit this year by 
General McCaffrey, the commander of the U.S. Southern Command 
headquartered in Panama; and a meeting with General John 
Shalikashvili, the U.S. Armed Forces joint chief of staff." 
  Diaz later ruled out the possibility of joining NATO because 
this organization does not accept the participation of countries 
far from the Northern Hemisphere. Nevertheless, he guaranteed 
that Argentina would receive communications and military 
doctrine technology. 
  In conclusion, the EMC chief discussed the exercises that 
will be carried out this year to face the situations arising 
from natural disasters like floods, fires, and earthquakes. 
  In this regard, Diaz, who is responsible for these 
exercises, 
pointed out that in this field, "a large-scale specific exercise 
will be carried out with the participation of the three 
branches, an exercise that will be prepared by the 5th Army 
Corps, headquartered in the city of Bahia Blanca."

  [Text] Marrakech, Morocco, 16 Apr (AFP-NA) -- It was 
announced in Marrakech that Morocco and Argentina today decided 
to apply "various mechanisms in order to develop their economic, 
trade, scientific, technical, and cultural relations." 
  The strengthening of bilateral relations and several 
international topics were evaluated by Moroccan Foreign Minister 
Abdellatif Filali and his Argentine colleague, Guido Di Tella, 
who -- after representing his country at the recent Uruguay 
Round Conference in Marrakech -- remained in the country on an 
official visit. 
  According to a joint communique, the two parties determined 
"the agreement of their viewpoints on the main topics that were 
discussed and the similarity of the evaluations that have been 
made by the two governments regarding the rapid evolution of 
international relations." 
  After lamenting that their economic exchange has not yet 
come 
up to the level of their good political relations, the two 
countries expressed their desire to "consolidate their 
cooperation in every sphere." 
  At the end of a meeting in which several other Moroccan 
ministers participated, Di Tella announced that President Carlos 
Menem will make an official visit to Morocco "before the end of 
the year." The exact date has not yet been made known. 
  The economic exchange between Argentina and Morocco, which 
was very scarce in the 1980's, has been increasing constantly 
for the past three years.

  [Text] Two journalists have been arrested by the Ministry 
of Government. They have been identified as Edith Munoz and 
David Garcia, both of whom have been charged with having alleged 
ties with terrorism. 
  [Begin recording] [Minister of Government German Quiroga] 
The 
court investigations are about to be concluded. In keeping with 
what is established in the law, they were able to see their 
relatives on 18 April, 24 hours after their arrest, particularly 
the woman in question. 
  This afternoon the police will be instructed to allow the 
press access to those arrested and tomorrow they will be placed 
at the disposal of the courts. 
  We have established that they were very closely involved in 
the killing of the Mormons, especially the woman. Therefore, we 
are conducting investigations in this direction. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Do you mean she was more involved 
than Mr. Garcia? 
  [Quiroga] Yes, absolutely. 
  [Reporter] Are they under suspicion for their involvement in 
terrorist activities? 
  [Quiroga] Yes. [end recording] 
  That was Minister of Government German Quiroga, who at

  [Text] Two more people have been arrested in the last few 
hours in relation to the case involving the Zarate Willka 
terrorist group. But one of them, photographer David Garcia, 
already has been released for lack of evidence. 
  [Begin recording] [unidentified reporter] These men belong 
to 
the Zarate Willka Armed Liberation Front terrorist group. The 
group members became known a few years ago when they murdered 
two Mormons, two Americans, in La Paz. These images from our 
files remind us that these men were sentenced, in some cases, to 
20 years in prison. In the last few hours police arrested Judith 
Munoz and David Garcia for their alleged involvement in this 
case. It has been reported, however, that David Garcia did not 
have any participation in the murder of the two Mormons. 
Therefore, Judith Munoz will be formally accused of belonging to 
the terrorist group. 
  [Minister of Government German Quiroga] We found a close 
link 
between that woman and the Mormons' murder. Therefore, police 
are carrying out an investigation in that direction. 
  [Reporter] Reliable Bolivian police sources indicated that a 
clearly identified jeep was used when the Mormons were murdered. 
The finding of the jeep at her house lead to Judith Munoz' 
arrest. [end recording]

  [Text] Brasilia -- Venezuelan and Brazilian military forces 
will in the next few days implement a joint operation for 
removing the 136 gold miners who were illegally exploiting gold 
in the border zone between the two countries, near Roraima. The 
"Swann" column of GLOBO yesterday reported that the miners were 
besieged by Venezuelan soldiers, who last week intensified 
repression against miners in Venezuelan territory. 
  Acting Foreign Minister Roberto Abdenur yesterday reported 
that at the request of the Brazilian Government, Venezuela 
postponed an operation scheduled for this weekend to blow up the 
illegal airstrips that the miners had built in its territory. 
  "We asked for the postponement of the operation to avoid 
putting the Brazilian miners at risk," Abdenur said, adding that 
as a result of negotiations between the two countries, the 
possibility of unilateral action in the region has been ruled 
out. 
  Negotiations between the two governments began last week, 
after Brazilian gold miners charged that their camps had been 
attacked by Venezuelan forces. Itamaraty has reported that 
Venezuela is keeping the Brazilian Government informed about all 
the operations implemented against the miners. According to 
Itamaraty, during the first operation -- which was carried out 
on 1 April -- the miners resisted, one of them died, and two 
were wounded. The second operation was carried out 10 days 
later, its objective being to blow up the airstrips. 
  According to Abdenur, on 14 April the two countries began a 
coordinated operation to patrol the area and check the number of 
miners who are illegally operating in Venezuela. The patrolling 
is being done by military men from the Amazonas Military 
Command, the Army, and the Venezuelan National Guard. Abdenur 
emphasized that relations between the two countries are 
characterized by total cooperation. 
  According to the last reports received at the Roraima Public 
Security Secretariat, another eight miners were killed in a camp 
in Alto Amajari. Two miners who yesterday arrived in Boa Vista 
said that the attack was carried out by a beige helicopter used 
by the Venezuelan National Guard. A Roraima Civil Police 
helicopter was sent to the area, but found no evidence of the 
attack. Itamaraty has stated that it is not aware of this 
attack.

  [Text] The town of Chaparro, on the Venezuelan side of the 
border, is within rifle range of Brazilian territory. From 
there it is possible to see the increased military activity in 
the Amazon region. Venezuelans are reinforcing their positions 
and building a defense line similar to our Calha Norte. There 
are also rumors that the Caracas Government might be buying 
missile batteries from Eastern European ex-Communist countries. 
There is no territorial dispute between Venezuela and Brazil, 
and this military buildup does not mean that Venezuela is 
preparing to invade the Brazilian Amazon region. It is just a 
reaction to the increased Brazilian military presence, which 
began early in 1993. Military observers have confirmed what 
high-precision satellites have for a long time detected: The 
Amazon region has become a training camp for the Brazilian Armed 
Forces. It is not yet like that ofApocalypse Now, 
the famous Francis Ford Coppola film, but military activities 
have become routine in the area. 
  There is abundant evidence of the increased Brazilian 
military presence in the area. The airport of Boa Vista, the 
capital of Roraima, is a virtual frontline defense base. The 
Brazilian Air Force (FAB) has deployed F-5 and Mirage squadrons 
in the area. They join the Tucano single-engined planes to 
perform exercises with ground and sea forces. Navy frigates and 
destroyers are conducting maneuvers in the mouth of the Amazon 
River, where they have performed beaching exercises. Ex-Army 
Minister Carlos Tinoco, and current Army Minister Zenildo de 
Lucena have both transferred military units from central and 
southern Brazil to the Amazon. The Petropolis Infantry Brigade 
(Rio de Janeiro) was sent to Roraima and the Santo Angelo 
Infantry Brigade (Rio Grande do Sul) was sent to Tefe (Amazon). 
Border platoons are being created to safeguard the military 
presence in the area. The Tefe brigade camp, for example, will 
occupy 500,000 square meters and operate along 2,200 km of the 
border. It will have three jungle infantry battalions, a 
hospital in Tabatinga (Amazon), and will have 1,700 troops: 500 
in Tefe, 900 in Tabatinga, and 300 in Cruzeiro do Sul, in Acre. 
  The Amazon military unit will have jurisdiction over a 
highly 
strategic region: from Santa Rosa in Acre to the Traira River 
near the Colombian border. It was there that Colombian 
guerrillas clashed with Brazilian soldiers in 1990. There have 
been successive incidents in the Amazon since the 1960's, when 
the Venezuelan Government attempted to take Pico da Neblina, 
Brazil's highest peak, (3,014 m). In the past few years, 
intense drug trafficking activities and the growing presence of 
miners who dispute land ownership with Ianomami Indians, have 
heightened the tension. Last year Brazil was accused of 
massacring 73 Ianomamis, although it was later discovered that 
there were only 19 victims and they were killed in Venezuelan 
territory. From neighboring Colombia there is also the 
potential threat of 12,000 FARC [Revolutionary Armed Forces of 
Colombia], ELN [Army of National Liberation], and EPL [Popular 
Liberation Army] guerrillas. Those organizations allied 
themselves with drug trafficking cartels to obtain funds for the 
armed struggle. According to Colombian intelligence services, 
the guerrillas are giving armed protection to drug trafficking 
routes, and they are likely to end up clashing with Brazilian 
military and police forces. In Peru, the Maoist Shining Path 
group has allied itself with drug trafficking. 
  The increased presence of Brazilian military troops stems 
from a change in the strategy of the Armed Forces. According to 
studies by the War College (ESG), the increased cooperation with 
Argentina and the development of Mercosur [Common Market of the 
South] have reduced the geopolitical importance of the southern 
region of the country, which has been the traditional point of 
attention for the military. The hypothesis of an external 
conflict has moved to the Amazon. What was mere theoretical 
expectation has become official doctrine: since the beginning of 
1993, the new line of the ESG has been blatantly christened the 
National Strategic Concept. Admiral Hernani Goulart Fortuna, an 
ex-ESG commander who is now a reserve officer, believes Brazil 
is now really devoted to the Amazon, which occupies an area that 
is subject to various international interests. "Brazil does not 
have border problems, it has problems at the border," he said, 
adding that it is no longer reasonable to maintain 35,000 Navy 
and Army men in Rio de Janeiro. Fortuna has written a report 
entitled: "The Amazon: Real Situation and Political, Strategic 
Vision." In his report, Fortuna claims Brazilians became more 
concerned about the Amazon following the end of the Cold War. 
The admiral explains that the latent conflicts, which were 
being kept on hold by the nuclear terror balance between the 
United States and the ex-USSR, have begun to emerge in various 
parts of the planet, and South America -- particularly the 
Amazon -- is not free of this phenomenon. 
  Sergio Porto da Luz, a reserve sea captain and ESG 
strategist, has pioneered the thesis of military reinforcement 
in the region. In his book, Structure for National Power 
in 2001, Luiz criticizes the broadly disseminated concept 
that the Amazon is a sort of "world lung." Porto da Luz says: 
"French President Francois Mitterrand has said that the Amazon 
is an asset that belongs to mankind, where it could be necessary 
to exercise the right of intervention. International interest 
in this region, which has been monitored by all possible sources 
of the First World, is growing." He believes it is necessary to 
"show to the international community that Brazil is firmly 
determined to prevent the Amazon from being treated with 
impunity." General Antenor Santa Cruz Abreu, who headed the 
Amazonas Military Command for three years, agrees. He says 
Brazil should never yield to the "spurious thesis" of the 
so-called relative sovereignty. Santa Cruz believes the 
measures adopted by the Army to strengthen the defense of the 
region, and those of civilian nature like those under the Amazon 
Region Surveillance System (Sivam) are essential to prevent an 
international strategic plan from being imposed on the country. 
"If Brazil abandons the Amazon, there will not be a 
conventional invasion but an attempt to create an international 
force to preserve the earth's lung," he warns. Army Minister 
Zenildo de Lucena prefers not to regard the increasing military 
presence in the Amazon within the context of a possible 
conflict, but as a guarantee of security and integration. 
  Not all military men, however, feel free to openly discuss 
the issue. General Sampaio Maia, current chief of the Amazon 
Region Military Command, CMA, did not want to talk to ISTOE 
reporters. According to the officer in charge of the CMA public 
relations, Gen. Sampaio Maia was "disgusted" at the treatment 
the press had given to military activities in the region. 
Nonetheless, on 8 and 9 March, Gen. Sampaio Maia met in Sao 
Gabriel da Cachoeira, Amazonas State, with General Valentin 
Porras who commands the 5th Jungle Infantry Division of the 
Venezuelan Army. The objective of the meeting was to reduce 
border tension between the two countries. During the meeting, 
which could not be covered by the press, they discussed the need 
to improve communications between the Brazilian and Venezuelan 
armies, to establish more simplified rules for military flights 
along the border area, and to adopt common procedures to deal 
with citizens who are caught in irregular situations. One week 
later, Sampaio Maia received in Manaus the new head of the U.S. 
Southern Command, General Barry MacCaffrey, who officially 
conveyed to him the Pentagon's decision not to conduct military 
maneuvers in Guyana. Brazilian military experts stated that 
this decision was more than mere courtesy toward the Brazilian 
officers who did not hide their concern over these maneuvers. 
Porto da Luz is convinced that Pentagon strategists are aware 
that Brazil is very seriously considering occupying that 
territory. Admiral Fortuna said the U.S. Navy proposed to the 
Brazilian Government to conduct joint maneuvers in the Amazon 
Region. He even suggested modifying military doctrine and 
giving priority to the antinarcotics effort. 
  Within this framework, it can be seen that General Bayma 
Denys' appointment to the Transportation Ministry was no 
accident. Gen. Denys, a former secretary of the National 
Security Council and former head of the Eastern Military 
Command, knows very well the logistic problems faced by the 
Brazilian Armed Forces in the Amazon region as a result of the 
somewhat sketchy highway system. Gen. Denys will begin to 
repair the main accesses to the Calha Norte project site. To 
give an idea of how precarious the region's roads are, it takes 
more than five hours to drive the 200 km that separates Sao 
Gabriel da Cachoeira, Amazonas State, from the Venezuelan and 
Colombian borders, and it is impossible to do it during the 
rainy season. Only recently did the Brazilian Army ensure 
deployment through the use of Manaus Aviation Squadron 
helicopters and Brazilian Air Force Buffalo planes. Bayma 
Denys' appointment to the Transportation Ministry implies the 
presence of more Brazilian Armed Forces contingents in the 
Amazon Region.

  [Text] President Itamar Franco today congratulated the 
military officers promoted to general on 31 March. In his speech 
to the generals, President Itamar Franco mentioned the general 
elections that will be held this year and the need to guarantee 
that the process take place in perfect democratic order: 
  [Begin Franco recording] We are getting close to a decision 
by the people who will elect their governors. As citizens, we 
have our candidates, parties, and ideas. In our condition as 
citizens, we will, as is our duty, struggle for the triumph of 
the candidates chosen by our conscience. As servants of society 
it is our responsibility to guarantee the freedom of the voters 
and the transmission of power within a strict democratic order. 
[end recording] 
  President Itamar Franco also pointed out the Armed Forces' 
cooperation with the government and its understanding in the 
face of difficult situations: 
  [Begin Franco recording] When I step down from power I will 
remember from these difficult months the good relationship with 
the Armed Forces, in whom I have always found understanding for 
the sacrifice that the budget restrictions have imposed on us, 
as well as its limitless contribution to the success of this 
administration, which, despite the bad will of many people, 
cannot be denied. We managed to resume our economic development, 
we are eliminating the public deficit, and effective measures 
against inflation are being taken. Throughout this difficult 
process we have always counted on the Armed Forces' men as part 
of an institution and as high-ranking members of our 
administration. [end recording] 
  President Franco also said that on 20 April he will send 
Congress a provisional measure establishing the rehiring of the 
public employees dismissed during the Collor administration. 
  The president added that he believes there will be a quorum 
in Congress this week to vote on the URV [Real Value Unit] 
Provisional Measure. The president said he relies on the good 
sense of members of Congress. He considers the provisional 
measure a decisive step in the struggle against the inflation.

<F P=106> [Article by Francisco Alves Filho with the collaboration of </F>
Peter Moon -- all names as published] 
  [Text] Scientists do not have a fatherland, and science 
belongs to humanity. These two rules are strictly observed by 
the more than 40 Russian professors and researchers who have 
settled in Brazil in the past two years. Their contracts were 
financed by funds established by the National Research Council 
(CNPQ). It took them a short time to adapt to the daily routine 
of Brazilian universities, and to leave behind the fear that the 
job was more than a short experiment by half a dozen spotted 
cats. They are feeling better, and it seems they have forgotten 
the meaning of the word goska -- the feeling of missing 
something or someone -- when they talk about the possibility of 
returning to Russia. They want to stay in the country as long 
as they can work here. 
  The distance separating Brazil from a country where 
professors are paid with dignity is as big as the distance 
separating Rio de Janeiro from Moscow. In any case, you cannot 
possibly miss the routines you left behind when salaries were 
$80 per month. Physicist Grigoriy Surdutovich, 56, was one of 
the first to come to Brazil. He arrived in January 1992, pushed 
by the political instability and the drastic budget cuts for 
scientific activities in Russia. The decline forced salaries 
down drastically there. Despite the shortcomings, he believes in 
improving Brazilian research efforts. "The climate in Brazilian 
scientific circles today is similar to the one in my country 35 
years ago," Surdutovich says. The scientist is studying the 
pressure of light on atoms at the Sao Paulo University (USP) in 
San Carlos. Artur Elfimov, 50, is the leader of a group of five 
Russian experts in plasma physics at the Rio de Janeiro State 
University (UERJ). He says: "If administrators really support 
the effort, the country could recover the time lost in various 
areas of knowledge." 
  The education of the researchers is varied. Galina 
Pugatcheva and Anatoliy Gusev, of the State University of 
Campinas (Unicamp), are studying the anomalies of the Brazilian 
magnetic field. The phenomenon creates 50 percent more 
lightings in our atmosphere than in any other part of the 
planet. Another five Russian scientists, contracted to work at 
the State University of Northern Fluminense (UENF), which was 
inaugurated on 28 March in Campos, are interested in producing 
synthetic diamonds. According to UENF patron Senator Darcy 
Ribeiro (PDT-RJ) [Democratic Labor Party -- Rio de Janeiro], 15 
researchers from the former Soviet Union will join the team in 
the near future. 
  For many the "import" of Russian scientists means savings in 
time and money. "You need at least eight years of heavy 
investment to form a professional of this level, and the cost is 
never less than $200,000," Carlos Augusto Azevedo, head of the 
UERJ Quantum Electronics Department, says. "Besides, the 
results of their work do not take long to appear," Azevedo adds. 
"This immigration has already yielded optimum results," Oscar 
Hipolito, USP Physics and Chemistry Institute director, says. 
  All this enthusiasm crashes against one obstacle, however: 
The law that forbids contracting foreigners as public 
officials. Rejected by the international community, this 
limitation has forced the Russian scientists to remain as 
visiting professors with salaries of $1,000 to $2,000 per month 
for periods of one to two years. Rectors and professors hide 
behind the constitutional principle of university autonomy to 
attack the ban. Their arguments worked in the recruitment of 
physicist Dmitriy Gitma by the USP in 1992, after he won a 
public competition. 
  Gitma is, however, an exception. All other Russian 
researchers depend on a fund, and many of them accept an 
additional difficulty of teaching in Brazil: inflation. 
Physicist Irina Potapenko, of the UERJ, left Russia two years 
ago. Her salary is adjusted by the dollar exchange rate every 
three months, despite the disagreement of state public servants. 
"I live in a university apartment. Just the same, inflation 
makes salaries barely enough for a condominium and survival." 
Despite the fact that her salary is corroded by price 
increases, she admits to being satisfied with the work, and does 
not contemplate leaving the country. When the legal and 
economic difficulties are pointed out to her, she answers with 
the smile of a person who has already begun to know the 
Brazilian soul: "Take it easy; Brazil is ours," she says.

<F P=106> [Report by Angel Paez] </F>
  [Text] The Shining Path [SL] cells in Europe have also 
become divided over Abimael Guzman Reinoso's decision to reach a 
peace agreement with the government. One group, headed by Luis 
Arce Borja and Adolfo Olaechea Cahuas, is against a dialogue 
with the government, while the other, headed by a close relative 
of Guzman, is in favor of laying down arms. 
  The Sol Peru Committee in Paris, in a bulletin which it 
started publishing recently, confirms its obedience to the 
self-styled "President Gonzalo" with the argument that "the 
great masters of the proletariat (also) carried out negotiations 
and signed peace agreements," and accused a "small black group" 
of questioning the SL leader's decisions. 
  According to the publication -- which unlike EL DIARIO 
INTERNACIONAL, whose editor is Luis Arce Borja, does not 
indicate the name of its editor -- this opposition group is 
"made up of a handful of opportunists who have banded together 
in a crazy and heated attempt to divide and create confusion in 
lashing out against the peace agreement proposed by our 
leadership." 
  Apparently Luis Arce Borja, who lives in Brussels, and 
Adolfo 
Olaechea Cahuas, who heads another "Sol Peru Committee" in 
London, form the "small black group." 
  Arce and Olaechea have both stated through their 
publications 
that the peace agreement being negotiated between Abimael Guzman 
Reinoso and President Alberto Fujimori is a great hoax, as they 
maintain that the letters were not written by the SL leader, nor 
is it he who appears in the videos, but rather an actor who 
looks very much like him. 
  But the basis for Arce and Olaechea's argument is that there 
isn't a single note from Guzman explaining the grounds for the 
proposal for a dialogue with the enemy. Arce even created an 
"interview" with Guzman, fabricated from old interviews and 
documents, in which he is made to say that an agreement with the 
regime is unfeasible. 
  In this regard the Sol Peru Committee in Paris states that 
those who maintain "with great insolence that President 
Gonzalo's letters and his proposal for a peace agreement are 
false and an invention have no arguments left in view of the 
overwhelming truth, (because) they will have to argue against 
2,500 prisoners of war from throughout the country who have 
declared through a communique that `they will not take a single 
step without President Gonzalo's guidance,' also repudiating the 
provocation and black campaign against the proposed peace 
agreement." 
  The Sol Peru Committee in Paris refers to the documents 
issued last December by SL members held under arrest in Miguel 
Castro Castro prison in Canto Grande, which endorse Guzman's 
letters to President Alberto Fujimori and uphold "the new 
decision and definition to strive for a peace agreement, 
(because) the people need it." 
  The document drafted by the SL members in France -- which 
clearly refers to the groups abroad that have sided with Oscar 
Ramirez Durand, "Comrade Feliciano," who is against the peace 
agreement and acknowledges Guzman's leadership only until the 
second SL Congress, which is when "Feliciano" will allegedly 
take the reins of the organization -- asserts that "the 
opportunists and alleged `upholders' of the peoples' war who 
have settled in Europe will not be able to shout (...) that 
2,500 prisoners of war of the Communist Party of Peru are 
"crazy," "stoned," or have been declared under "psychological 
pressure," and less still that they `have sided with Fujimori's 
government.'" 
  The document goes on to state: "They will have to bite their 
dirty tongues and swallow the disgusting things they have said," 
"(because) one (cannot) label fellow comrades with renowned 
devotion as people who have `surrendered' or as `repentants,' 
which is how the black campaign against the peace agreement 
intends to describe them: Maria Pantoja, Martha Huatay, and 
Angelica Salas Osman Morote, who met with President Gonzalo, and 
(Comrade) Miriam (Elena Iparraguirre Revoredo) have passed on 
President Gonzalo's instructions." 
  The bulletin is more precise: "(The members of the `small 
black group') will not be able to direct their disgusting 
charges against clean militants such as Edmundo Cox, Sybila 
Arredondo, (Victor) Zavala Catano, Maritza Garrido Lecca, etc., 
with the purpose of creating division in the work of the 
Communist Party of Peru abroad." 
  Cox Beuzeville ia the author of a letter to Colonel Gabino 
Cajahuanca, director of the Castro Castro prison, in which he 
explains his efforts to convince his comrades to struggle for 
the peace agreement. He writes: "My commitment is full, total, 
unconditional, public, decided, and definite, to achieve what 
everybody needs: the peace agreement." 
  The bulletin of the Sol Peru Committee in Paris published 
the 
letter from Cox Beuzeville and the prisoners of Canto Grande 
advocating obedience to the new guidelines of Guzman Reinoso. 
The letter says: "We strongly and unavoidably adhere to our 
leader, to our dear and respected President Gonzalo, with 
firmness and determination for the new great decision: the 
struggle for the peace agreement!" 
  In these terms the SL cells in Paris show their total 
disagreement with the position taken by Olaechea Cahuas and Arce 
Borja, known for their SL propaganda, who are at large and under 
process of extradition. 
  The two, through DIARIO INTERNACIONAL, contend that 
"agreeing 
with Fujimori's `letters' means disregarding the general 
political guideline of the revolution established by Abimael 
Guzman, and denying the validity of the party's program, the 
strategic objective of which is the seizure of power throughout 
the entire country and the creation of the Popular Republic of 
Peru." 
  The two leaders also said that "the people's war cannot be 
negotiated, and there cannot be any dialogue with this 
reactionary and criminal government. The decision made by the 
revolutionaries is to destroy the old state and finish off the 
Armed Forces and the police" and "these objectives cannot be 
achieved with deals or `peace talks.' The class struggle cannot 
be auctioned off." 
  This position is the same as that held by those who publish 
EL DIARIO in Lima. Last January EL DIARIO published a 
communique from the "Committee of Relatives of Political 
Prisoners, War Prisoners, and Those Missing of Peru" attacking 
the SL leaders who are in favor of the peace agreement. The 
communique says: "We raise our voices and belligerent souls to 
denounce, condemn, and reject with the deep hate of the classes 
the sinister actions of that handful of known and proven 
capitulators, informers, and cowards who would not sacrifice 
their lives, the execrable revisionist bitches (...) who have 
been mobilized through different prisons of the country to 
spread the so-called peace agreement, openly crying out for 
capitulation, reporting everyone, and taking refuge in the 
repentance law." 
  This is the combat line of Oscar Ramirez Durand, Comrade 
Feliciano, which consists in asserting that the entire campaign 
for the peace agreement is a plot to destroy the Communist Party 
of Peru-Shining Path, PCP-SL, to put an end to the "people's 
war" and mainly kill Guzman. "(This sector) persists alone in 
the counterrevolutionary hoax within the premeditated, 
treacherous, and furious plan to murder President Gonzalo, thus 
uselessly attempting to spread capitulation among our heroic 
people, liquidate the party, and destroy the people's war." 
  And in the recent issue of EL DIARIO, February-March, 
justifying the attack against the Metro commercial center and 
the fire at the Callao Naval Base, among other actions, the 
subversives say that the attacks "show in fact that the people's 
war continues unavoidably." 
  But the Shining Path leaders of the Sol Peru Committee in 
Paris say that the sabotage is an action of the PCP-SL with the 
objective of demonstrating its capacity for negotiation, carried 
out based on "the new great decision and definition" which is 
the struggle for the peace agreement. 
  "What would be the purpose of a `peace agreement' in Peru?" 
asks Arce Borja in an article in EL DIARIO INTERNACIONAL. He 
answers: "The only ones who will benefit from a `peace 
agreement' are exclusively the enemies of the Peruvian people, 
mainly the imperialist forces." 
  According to the Sol Peru Committee in Paris, Arce Borja and 
Olaechea Cahuas would be the "opportunists and sellouts who are 
carrying out a dirty campaign with the so-called pretext of 
supporting the people's war and attacking our leadership. They 
are reactionary dark leaders whom the people will know how to 
punish." 
  LA REPUBLICA was able to contact by telephone a spokesman 
for 
the Shining Path cells in France, who only confirmed the 
authenticity of the bulletin. 
  LA REPUBLICA also talked with Adolfo Olaechea Cahuas, SL 
chief in England and head of another Sol Peru Committee in 
London, who acknowledged as real the French bulletin and 
identified its writers. Maximiliano Duran Araujo, brother-in-law 
of Osman Morote Barrionuevo and brother of Teresa [Juana Teresa 
Durand Araujo de Morote, aka Comrade Doris], is an SL leader on 
the Central Committee who has been living in France for years, 
and is currently in hiding. 
  We asked Olaechea if he was the one. 
  He said: No, it is someone else. A relative of Guzman.

<F P=106> [Article by "special correspondent" Carlos Aponte] </F>
  [Text] Subversive activities in Huaraz Province, Ancash 
Department, are about 80 percent under control. Therefore, the 
population that lived in uncertainty and panic for many years 
due to the daily murder of government officials by the Shining 
Path is returning to tranquillity and security. 
  Commander Jorge Fernandez, chief of the Mechanized Infantry 
Battalion, told EXPRESO that the pacification process in this 
part of the country is in progress through the fulfillment of 
all the plans established by the government to dismantle the 
small Shining Path groups that still are operating in different 
parts of the nation. He added that the Armed Forces -- National 
Police and Army -- were successful in dismantling the different 
Shining Path groups that were operating in the area because of 
the participation of the population that, far from feeling fear, 
reported the subversives and gave information that led to their 
capture. 
  Fernandez added that another factor that led to finding out 
the whereabouts of top Shining Path military leaders was the 
delicate intelligence operation carried out for a long time with 
the participation of highly qualified and trained personnel to 
face any situation. 
  During the last two years, the Army has dealt hard blows to 
subversion. According to statistics, the Army broke up 53 
military and logistical commands operating in different areas, 
mainly in Chiquian and Callejon de los Conchucos, areas that 
were under Shining Path control for many years. 
  Fernandez said: "The cooperation of the population and the 
peasant defense patrols was a key element in breaking up the 
important military commands that were operating in the different 
settlements of Huaraz. And now we are seeing the results." 
  He said that in contrast with other departments in the 
country, in Huaraz only a small group of subversives -- seven 
all together -- decided to abide by the Repentance Law, because 
they realized that their so-called "armed struggle" failed after 
the capture of their highest leader, Abimael Guzman Reinoso. 
  He added that the Army is protecting them and is fulfilling 
the orders given by the president through the Repentance Law. 
Many of those who repented have given valuable information that 
contributed to the capture of the main subversive leaders. 
  Regarding the possibility that Shining Path leader Julio 
Cesar Mezzich may be operating in Huaraz, Fernandez said there 
are many reports about his presence in the area but they have 
not been confirmed yet. 
  He did not discard, however, the possibility that Mezzich 
may 
be hiding in the high area of Huaraz under another name, and 
that this is why patrol operations are carried out in all the 
peasant settlements.

<F P=106> [Article by Damian Retamozo] </F>
  [Text] According to different sources, the government goal 
to strengthen the National Intelligence Service (SIN) has 
caused, paradoxically, the weakening, almost the dismantling, of 
the country's best-qualified intelligence organization, the 
Special Intelligence Group (Gein) of Dincote [Counterterrorism 
Directorate]. 
  Gein was created in mid-1989 at the initiative of Major 
Benedicto Jimenez Blaco, a brilliant Dincote officer whose 
obsession was to capture Abimael Guzman. 
  His dedication, almost romantic, to the struggle against 
terrorism was known among his colleagues. Jimenez convinced 
chiefs and those under him that the only way to capture the 
Shining Path founder, the author of the so-called "Gonzalo 
thoughts," was through the systematic use of intelligence 
information. 
  With the support of former Dincote Director General Fernando 
Reyes Roca, Benedicto Jimenez began the training of about 15 
selected policemen. But it was still an improvised and not very 
coherent group. Later, the new Dincote director, General John 
Caro, gave the organization a real push until he made it into an 
efficient intelligence organization. 
  Gein increased its specialized personnel to 53, and without 
any doubt the best thing it did then was to locate the refuge of 
Abimael Guzman on 31 January 1991. It was a house located on 
Bellavista de Chacarilla Street. Police found the famous video 
showing Guzman dancing to "Zorba the Greek" there, a large 
amount of internal documents on the Shining Path and its main 
members, and cassettes with the voice of Abimael Guzman. This 
work was decisive for Guzman's capture in September 1992. 
  Gein reached its peak with Ketin Vidal, who took over as 
Dincote chief in December 1991. The number of its special agents 
went to 83. Dincote personnel talked with humor about "Benedicto 
thoughts" in contrast to the Shining Path's "Gonzalo thoughts." 
  At the same time, Dincote operational units, the Deltas and 
Divicotes, received major logistical support with 
high-technology electronic equipment. Examples: small wireless 
telephones that are very easy to install anywhere, highly 
sensitive electronic "ears" capable of hearing and recording 
conversations from 60 to 80 meters away or through walls to hear 
a conversation, and photographic cameras and film equipment to 
capture images in the dark. 
  Abimael Guzman's capture gave major popularity to Dincote 
and 
especially to its chief, Ketin Vidal. According to some 
analysts, this situation made some prominent government members 
jealous, who decided to transfer Vidal to an administrative 
position in the National Police. 
  Later the SIN swallowed the best-qualified group in Gein. 
Benedicto Jimenez and about 20 of his men joined the SIN on 
orders from the authorities. Jimenez is now an instructor in 
this national intelligence organization. 
  In this regard, a top police officer whose identity we 
obviously must keep confidential said: "What happens is that 
the SIN is now the organization that wants to score the points. 
The SIN, which for years was not able to form a qualified 
countersubversion team, now wants to improve its image, and to 
do that it brought the best Dincote scorers into its ranks. The 
idea is that from now on the success will be by SIN and not 
Dincote. 
  According to the National Defense System, Dincote is 
regarded as merely an operations unit. It is not in charge of 
any intelligence work, but was forced to do so in view of the 
fact that they needed precise intelligence information on the 
Shining Path. The SIN, which was supposed to provide this 
information, was unable to do so. Gein made up for this 
deficiency. 
  The government now has ordered strengthening and giving more 
importance to the SIN, headed by Division General Julio Salazar 
Monroe, although many believe that the "de facto" SIN chief is 
retired Captain Vladimiro Montesinos Torres. 
  The SIN is the main organization that collects the work 
produced by its subunits: The Army Intelligence Service (SIE), 
the Navy Intelligence Directorate (Dina), and the Air Force 
Intelligence Directorate (Difap). 
  According to the established scheme, the SIN chief has the 
status of a minister of state. He presides over a small cabinet 
that submits a daily report containing strategic information at 
a nationwide level on the military, non-military, and sectorial 
areas to the president of the Republic's office. This report 
includes updated socio-economic, political, and psycho-social 
information. 
  The intelligences services subject to the Interior Ministry 
(among them is the Dincote intelligence group) fall under the 
Interior Ministry Intelligence General Directorate [Direccion 
General de Inteligencia del Ministerio del Interior] (Digimint). 
  Will the strengthening of SIN harm the country? 
  We asked former Dincote chief Gen. John Caro, who now has 
become an analyst of the terrorism phenomenon, this question. 
  "It might affect Dincote but not the country. Let us wait 
and see. I hope that with well-trained personnel and the 
modernization of its technology, SIN will do a good job. We 
know that the Shining Path remains in Ene Valley, Huallaga, and 
other areas of the country. In the struggle against terrorism, 
precise intelligence information will always be welcome wherever 
it comes from. Now we probably will have a real national 
intelligence service that will be better than that provided by 
Dincote in metropolitan Lima." 
  After consulting various sources, it can be said that 
Dincote 
will not be broken up or dissolved as some extremist versions 
have stated. 
  Dincote has experienced a moderate reduction of personnel 
but 
at a level that does not affect its operational capacity. 
Moreover, its logistical equipment has not been transferred to 
other units as some have stated. 
  The recent arrest in Chiclayo of an important MRTA [Tupac 
Amaru Revolutionary Movement] cell, including an Italian 
terrorist who belongs to the terrorist group, was the result of 
intelligence work by Bredet [Special Brigade of Detectives 
Specialized in Terrorism]-Dincote, headed by Colonel Juan 
Gonzales Sandoval. 
  However, aside from this operation, the number of 
significant 
arrests has dropped. Dincote's actions seem to have shrunk. 
  Gen. John Caro tries to explain: "The catch tends to drop 
when many fish in the same pond have been fished. We already 
have arrested between 80 and 85 percent of the leadership. 
There are some 15 to 20 percent that remain to be arrested. 
This does not mean that Dincote has lowered its guard. But it 
is a fact that it will more difficult to arrest them now because 
they are alert. The cost of each arrest, logically, will 
increase because a lot more fuel, a lot more personnel are 
necessary..."

  [Excerpt] Msgr. Augusto Vargas Alzamora, the Lima 
archbishop and Peruvian primate, yesterday harshly criticized 
the lack of independence enjoyed by the judicial branch and 
urged magistrates to act according to their conscience and not 
yield to any form of alien pressure and not rule according to 
the circumstances. He also urged them to step up their 
investigations to determine whether those brought before the 
court are guilty or not. 
  Vargas Alzamora gave a news conference after the Easter 
Sunday mass in the Lima Cathedral. He indirectly referred to 
the Goldman report disclosed last Thursday, 31 March, in 
Washington which criticizes the reform of the judicial branch 
following the self-styled coup staged by President Alberto 
Fujimori on 5 April 1992. 
  Vargas Alzamora told LA REPUBLICA: "It would be fatal for 
the 
country if the judicial branch did not enjoy independence." He 
recalled that the commission of international jurists headed by 
U.S. law professor Robert Goldman referred to serious 
deficiencies in the administration of justice in Peru and 
recalled that it recommended the elimination of the faceless 
judges and a substantial amendment of the antiterrorist laws 
that had allowed the sentencing of innocent people. 
  During his usual meeting with the media in the main hall of 
the Lima archbishopric, Vargas Alzamora said: "The only thing I 
can tell the judges is to be loyal to their conscience, do not 
yield to any pressure, and do not condemn those being tried for 
circumstantial reasons. I urge them, from the bottom of my 
heart, to exhaustively investigate cases and prove that the 
charges are legitimate. The contrary would be fatal to the 
country." [passage omitted]

  [Text] The government policy in the struggle against 
illegal drug trafficking has allowed the Armed Forces and the 
National Police, which are operating under a single command, to 
seize 28,782 kg of drugs such as cocaine base, cocaine 
hydrochloride, and marijuana in a little more than three years. 
During that period these forces captured 12,975 drug traffickers 
and confiscated 415,000 kg of precursors used by the mafia 
"firms" to make drugs. 
  According to Executive Agency for Drug Control (Ofecod) 
statistics, 3,108 drug addicts were arrested nationwide in 1993. 
  Ofecod also reported that in 1991, drug seizures reached 
5,859 kg. In 1992 the amount was 8,800 kg, which included 8,341 
kg of cocaine base, 231.402 kg of cocaine hydrochloride, and 
227.038 kg of marijuana. 
  In 1993, antidrug operations seized 9,461.511 kg of drugs, 
including 8,586.757 kg of cocaine base, 436.727 kg of cocaine 
hydrochloride, and 437.762 kg of marijuana. 
  From January to 24 March 1994, drug seizures reached 
4,532.675 kg of cocaine base, 18.832 kg of cocaine 
hydrochloride, and 110.051 kg of marijuana. 
  The number of drug traffickers arrested in 1991 was 3,664, 
4,195 in 1992, and 5,022 in 1993. In the first three months of 
this year, 94 drug traffickers were arrested. 
  The police operations also allowed the seizure of 105,527 kg 
of precursors in 1991, 185,895 kg in 1992, and 90,288 kg in 
1993, and 33,323 kg in the first three months of this year. 
  According to estimates by the Interior Ministry and the 
Dinandro [National Antidrug Division], the antidrug forces 
confiscated properties, furniture, equipment, and money worth 
about $51.65 million from the "firms" in 1993. 
  The goods include 41 properties in Lima and the provinces 
and 
115 vehicles including cars, trucks, small airplanes, 
speedboats, and motorcycles. 
  Dinandro also reported that 1993 operations against drug 
traffickers in the Upper Huallaga led to the destruction of 41 
labs for processing drugs and 28 maceration pits. 
  From 1 January to 10 March 1994, the police destroyed 12 
labs 
and 11 maceration pits for making cocaine base. It should be 
pointed out that the largest amount of maceration pits, 315, 
were destroyed in 1992.

  [Text] EL PERUANO was able to establish that the struggle 
against drug trafficking in the Upper Huallaga could be more 
effective if the helicopters the Air Police use in the thick 
jungle areas were equipped to fly at night. 
  This is because of the new tactic used by Colombian drug 
traffickers who land their modern aircraft at night, taking 
advantage of the fact that police aircraft do not have night 
vision devices to detect them and react immediately. 
  An Air Police member commented: "When we started our 
antinarcotic operations in the Upper Huallaga we struck hard 
blows against drug trafficking but all these operations were 
carried out in the daytime. Now the Colombian traffickers carry 
out their operations at night, which complicates matters for us." 
  In addition to limited operational capacity are the 
helicopters' years of service. In the 60's, the UH-1 
helicopters played an important role in the Vietnam war due to 
their great maneuverability and their capacity to escape unhurt 
from the most incredible war situations. 
  However, 30 years later, it can be said that the UH-1 
helicopters have completed their operational cycle. Therefore, 
those operating in the Upper Huallaga must be replaced. 
Accidents have occurred, but the Peruvian police pilots' skill 
has prevented greater disgraces. 
  Another member of the force said: "We need training to 
operate at night with night vision devices, because this would 
make our work more effective. If we had this our actions would 
certainly seriously wound this illegal trade." 
  This policeman has every right to say what he said because 
the information supplied by the silent DEA aircraft, which 
operates with its turbines off in the middle of the night in the 
jungle, cannot be used by the Peruvian pilots because their 
aircraft only fly during the day. 
  Although this has by no means affected police pilots' 
morale, 
neither can it be said that their effectiveness is minimal. 
Facts prove it: The results would be much more significant if 
only they were to operate under other conditions.

Alvarez] 
  [Text] Puerto Maldonado -- Since mid-1993, Peruvian and 
foreign drug traffickers have chosen Puerto Maldonado as the 
shipping center and exit point for drugs produced in Peru in 
their attempt to dodge the cordon established by the security 
forces in the traditional cocaine production areas. 
  This was proved by three operations carried out by the armed 
and police forces during the past five weeks, during which the 
largest amounts of drugs were seized. 
  A total of 3.5 metric tons of washed cocaine base paste were 
seized on 26 February at Boca Manu airport and more than 1 
metric ton of cocaine base paste on 24 and 26 March at an 
airstrip in Inapari, capital of Tahuamani Province. 
  In every case the cocaine was ready to be loaded on an 
aircraft bound for Colombia, where it was going to be made into 
cocaine hydrochloride that would then be sold in the United 
States and Europe. 
  It was disclosed that the drugs seized in Boca Manu belonged 
to the "Cachique Rivera firm" and that Colombians were involved. 
  It also was disclosed that the drugs seized during the two 
latest operations at Inapari airstrip and the Santa Rosa de 
Fatima farm (15 km from the Shirimayoc checkpoint on the 
Brazilian border) allowed the breaking up of another "firm" that 
supplied drugs to an organization of Colombian drug traffickers 
headed by an individual identified as "Guido Correa." 
  PNP [Peruvian National Police] General Sixto Gutierrez, head 
of the PNP 10th Region, told an EL COMERCIO correspondent that 
"Guido Correa" lives in Cauca Valley (Colombia), from where he 
directs his organization. 
  In view of the harassment by security forces in Upper 
Huallaga, Ucayali, and Ayacucho (where his aircraft used to land 
to load drugs), he decided to find another place for his 
shipments. 
  For this reason he sent to Peru six members of his 
organization identified as "Andres," "Dario," "Tarzan," 
"Bebito," "Lazo," and "Cucaracha," who clandestinely entered the 
country between 14 and 15 March through the "Palestina Peru" 
area on the border of La Convencion (Cuzco) and Ayacucho. They 
were received there by Peruvian citizen "Caliche," with whom 
they made their first contacts. 
  From there they decided to send to Inapari Colombians Miguel 
Manosalva Contreras, 26, Ruben Dario Arango Santa, 35, and 
Andres Ramirez Piedraita, 32, as well as Brazilian Alsimar 
Marquez Da Silva, to buy drugs. 
  Once in Inapari they contacted "Fernando," who is the 
organization's coordinator and, with "Piston," the main drug 
supplier. 
  Thus they managed to gather an initial amount of 400 kg of 
cocaine base paste, which they shipped to Colombia on 20 March. 
Since they saw that there seemed to be no problems they decided 
to continue operating in Inapari and, what is more, built an 
airstrip on the Santa Rosa de Fatima farm. 
  The Army and the PNP, however, thanks to intelligence work, 
found out about this new organization and carried out an 
operation that allowed them to seize more than 1 metric ton of 
cocaine base paste and arrest 23 drug traffickers. Two 
policemen also are being investigated.

  [Excerpt] One of the front men for the Peruvian Cachique 
Rivera family, engaged in drug trafficking, was arrested on 2 
April in the capital after the Antidrug Division (Dinandro) 
exhaustively investigated an accounting office involved in 
"laundering" money obtained from drug trafficking, according to 
Peruvian National Police [PNP] sources. 
  As is known, the Cachique Rivera brothers belong to one of 
the most important "firms" that supplies drugs to the Colombian 
Cali cartel. According to information obtained by Dinandro, 
they have become the drug trafficking leaders in Peru after the 
arrest of Demetrio Limonier Chavez Penaherrera, aka Vaticano. 
  The alleged owner of the "enterprise," whose identity was 
not 
disclosed, was arrested when he was driving a luxurious metal 
blue Toyota Tercel vehicle, license number DO-3801, in a capital 
neighborhood. According to the source, Dinandro uncovered the 
front man after exhaustively and patiently investigating an 
accounting office in Lima. 
  Despite the secrecy in the case, it was leaked that 
Dinandro's Finance Division, with the technical support of 
auditors, established that the financial movements did not match 
the activities carried out by this "front" enterprise. 
  The source added that after checking the relationship 
between 
the arrested individual and the Cachique Rivera drug trafficking 
family, personnel from that "enterprise" were exhaustively 
investigated. 
  Dinandro thus carried out the successful operation on 2 
April 
when it was proved that the Cachique Rivera's front man was 
involved in "laundering: drug money. 
  It is known that Dinandro Chief General Walter Taboada Milla 
has ordered that investigations into the case continue. 
  Taboada said the Cachique Rivera gang is formed by four 
brothers from Tingo Maria -- Abelardo, aka Teniente; Adolfo, aka 
Alferez; Segundo, aka Capitan; and Nicolas, aka Mayor. 
  According to the source, the Cachique Rivera family is 
headed 
by Abelardo, aka Teniente, the cruelest of the brothers, who -- 
according to the police -- heads the operations of the "firm" 
from Colombia. Segundo, aka Capitan, is in charge of running 
the "business" in the jungle. The other two, according to the 
source, are in charge of collecting the money from drug 
trafficking. 
  Taboada said the arrest of these criminals is a matter of 
days. Peruvian and Colombian authorities are continuously 
exchanging information to find the "narcos." 
  He ended by stating: "We are following them closely. They 
are constantly going to Colombia. We hope to arrest them in a 
few days." 
  The sister in the Cachique Rivera family, Margarita, 30, was 
arrested on 20 March in Lima on an arrest warrant issued by the 
Lima court on charges of drug trafficking. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Peruvian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Efrain 
Goldenberg, who is in Morocco, today expressed optimism about 
the decision to create the World Trade Organization. 
  Goldenberg is heading the Peruvian delegation that is 
participating in the GATT conference. Goldenberg said that the 
World Trade Organization, which will be created after the 
conclusion of the GATT conference and will supervise world 
trade, is the outcome of the liberalization policy advocated by 
Peru. 
  Regarding the so-called social clause advocated by the 
United 
States and several European countries, Goldenberg was against 
mixing the labor jurisdiction of the International Labor 
Organization with the trade jurisdiction of the future World 
Trade Organization.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu will sign a memorandum 
of commercial understanding with Egypt and a document formally 
closing the Uruguay Round of the GATT talks during a tour of 
African Mediterranean countries that he will begin this weekend. 
  The commercial agreement with Egypt will permit a broadening 
of Uruguay's export market, particularly in the area of 
agriculture. 
  Abreu said that a protocol is being finished to permit the 
export of Uruguayan meat to Egypt. Abreu added that he will take 
advantage of the opportunity to prepare President Luis Alberto 
Lacalle's trip to Egypt, which is scheduled for June. 
  The foreign minister will then travel to Marrakech, 
Morocco's 
capital, to participate in the formal closing of the Uruguay 
Round of GATT talks. 
  Abreu said that the GATT talks will formally conclude on 15 
April, and that he will attend the closing ceremony as the 
Uruguay Round president. 
  The foreign minister also said that he held a meeting with 
representatives of the country's entrepreneurial chambers. Abreu 
said those meetings are routinely held in order to inform 
entrepreneurs of the international situation and the country's 
relations with other countries. 
  "Representatives of entrepreneurial chambers come to the 
Foreign Ministry once a month, and here they receive information 
about Mercosur [Common Market of the South] and GATT, the 
country's bilateral negotiations, and the call to Montevideo of 
Uruguayan trade attaches for the exchange of information," Abreu 
said. 
  The minister said his ministry has established this 
mechanism 
in order to coordinate the operation of the private and public 
sectors. 
  "We want the Foreign Ministry to become an instrument 
promoting the country's presence in the world. We want this 
ministry to become what we call Uruguay's grand multinational," 
Abreu concluded.

<F P=106> [Article by Jose Otero and Jose Quintero] </F>
  [Text] President Guillermo Endara has suggested that 
Ernesto Perez Balladares, presidential candidate on the "United 
People's" ticket, withdraw his challenge to President Endara to 
show all the videos of the military dictatorship, because if 
Perez Balladares does not, the PRD [Democratic Revolutionary 
Party] will be the main party affected. 
  PRD presidential candidate Perez Balladares on Friday 
publicly challenged President Endara to broadcast on television 
all the videos the president has on how the people were mocked 
during the cabinet council meetings during the past military 
regime. 
  Endara phoned Circuito RPC Television station during the 
"Let 
Us Find Solutions" program hosted by Julio Miller to make a 
statement. Endara recommended that the PRD presidential 
candidate withdraw his challenge or face the consequences. 
  The president told Perez Balladares several times to 
"withdraw your challenge, because those videos will affect you." 
  Endara explained that he had not officially decided whether 
he would broadcast the unedited videos, but he warned that he 
had already set aside the time slot between 2000 and 2100 on 
Channel 11 [Panama City Sistema de Television Educativa] to air 
the videos on the abuses of the past military regime. 
  "Perhaps the scenes you will see on Channel 11 will not be 
as 
dramatic as those you saw on Thursday, but they will confirm the 
cynicism and disregard for the people upon which the PRD prided 
itself in the past," Endara stressed. 
  Endara denied that the videos he broadcast on a national 
network were part of the 15,000 boxes that the U.S. Government 
has had since the 1989 military invasion. 
  "With God as my witness, that video was given to me on 5 
April and I went through a real calvary before making my 
decision," the president added. 
  Endara said he knew about these videos filmed at the 
Presidential Palace but that until he was shown the contents he 
had never been interested in watching them, because he was too 
busy with the huge task of rebuilding the country. 
  "In addition to those videos, I know there are rooms full of 
documents that belonged to the previous regime. I have never 
looked at them because I am not interested in the problems of 
the presidents who were in office before me," Endara said. 
  The president added that before deciding to show the video 
on 
television he consulted with Mireya Moscoso de Gruber, 
presidential candidate for the Arnulfist Party. 
  Endara said that Mireya advised him to think hard before 
making a decision because it could hurt him. Endara added that 
at no time did the Arnulfist Party candidate try to benefit from 
the videos. 
  Likewise, President Endara said that his decision to 
publicly 
air the videos did not violate the Santa Maria Pact because he 
never used his office to support political interests. 
  "At no place in the Santa Maria Pact did I commit myself to 
being impartial. I promised to abide by the Constitution and 
the laws, and that is what I have done throughout my term in 
office," Endara said. 
  Meanwhile, at 1900 on Monday, the Peace and Justice 
Commission will meet with all the political parties to analyze 
the president's speech during the radio and television network. 
The meeting will be held at Santa Maria La Antigua University 
auditorium. 
  A bulletin issued by the commission advised that its members 
met on 15 April to discuss the president's actions and decided 
to inform the delegates of the political parties that signed the 
Santa Maria Pact of their views on Monday.

<F P=106> [Statement by Stanley Muschett, president of the Panamanian </F>
Commission for Justice, Peace, and National Reconciliation, at 
the Santa Maria La Antigua University in Panama City -- live] 
  [Text] Good evening to all television viewers and radio 
listeners. Just as we announced, the Justice and Peace 
Commission prepared a preliminary statement in which it stated 
its position regarding the president's actions on Thursday, 14 
April. This position was a preliminary one in compliance with 
the regulations of the permanent consultative body. The 
permanent consultative body, created under the auspices of the 
electoral ethical agreement, is made up of the representatives 
of the political parties that signed the agreement under the 
presidency of the Justice and Peace Commission. 
  We brought this position, this preliminary statement, before 
the consultative body with the intention of reaching a 
collective position. After the meeting, where I must recognize 
that the efforts were to enrich the document, I must also point 
out that the statement we are making now is an exclusive 
statement by the Justice and Peace Commission, because a 
collective statement was not reached among all the members of 
the permanent consultative body according to the regulation. I 
am going to read the statement and once I finish, I will make 
some observations. 
  Statement by the Justice and Peace Commission: As for the 
appearance of the president of the Republic in a national 
network on 14 April, the Justice and Peace Commission states its 
position given the commitment it has made for the promotion of a 
participatory and respectful election process that is free of 
violence. 
  No one can disregard the past, which must be completely 
analyzed. Reflections of the past must serve to illuminate the 
present, create possibilities for the future, and contribute to 
the governing of the country; therefore: 
  1. The pictures that were shown reminded us of a painful 
part of our history, aggravated by the offensive actions of some 
of the participants. History cannot be forgotten and only 
through a true reconciliation based on the strict application of 
justice and repentance can we be in peace with it. 
  2. The unnecessary expectation created by the words and the 
actions of the president presented as a genuine concern for 
democracy and the normal development of the state can also be 
interpreted as an effort to change the preferences in the 
present electoral process, which could contradict his call not 
to, and I quote, use his authority and influence to serve the 
interests of the participants in the election process, unquote. 
  3. A few days before the elections are held, we reiterate a 
call to debate the different platforms and evaluate candidates 
based on their values, capabilities, and past achievements. 
  4. Panama is our common house. After the elections, we have 
the great task of reaching agreements on the great challenges 
that lie ahead. That is why the Justice and Peace Commission 
makes a call to the president and to all participants in the 
election process to -- inspired in the multiple initiatives made 
since the ethical electoral agreement and the women's forum on 
political parties, including the electoral agreement of the 
Executive Branch -- conclude this process with tolerance, 
respect, and responsibility. 
  I want to publicly ask the various media that may pick up 
this statement to please reproduce it in its entirety, and we 
hope they refrain from editing out parts that may detract from 
the primary intention that led us to make this statement. Thank 
you very much.

<F P=106> [From the "RPC Television News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] According to a Supreme Court of Justice ruling, 
there will be no run-off election. The decision does not allow 
any kind of appeal or reconsideration recourse. A class action 
suit was filed with the Supreme Court several weeks ago, against 
Article 255 of the Electoral Code. The provision states that 
the winner of the election is the candidate who receives a 
majority of the votes. The court has just handed down its 
decision on this unconstitutionality claim. 
  [Begin Chief Justice Arturo Hoyos recording] The court has 
decided, in a plenary session, that Article 255 of the Electoral 
Code is not unconstitutional. Therefore, there will be no 
run-off election for the 1994 presidential election. For 
several decades now, the word majority in the text of Article 
172 of the Constitution has been interpreted to mean that only a 
simple majority is required. [end recording] 
  Chief Justice Hoyos explained that the Constitution must be 
reformed in order for there to be a run-off election. He added 
that there will be no appeal or reconsideration of the court's 
ruling, which was reached unanimously and is deemed definitive.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on developments related to the Panamanian elections 
scheduled for 8 May. 
  Presidential Candidate Ernesto Perez Balladares, of the 
Democratic Revolutionary Party, PRD, met with workers of the 
diplomatic corps and students on 13 April. He said: "The 
Foreign Ministry must start recovering our authority, our true 
dignity, our image of a free, independent, and sovereign country 
in the eyes of all the world's nations, beginning 1 September." 
He added the ministry will have the important task of upholding 
the Panama Canal Treaty and "promoting our geographic position 
and our potential as a nation." In doing so, "we will attract 
the foreign investment we need to create jobs." (Panama City 
Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 13 Apr 94) 
  Presidential Candidate Ruben Dario Carles, of the 
Nationalist 
Liberal Republican Movement (Molirena)-Change '94 Alliance, 
attended the Cade (Annual Conference of Business Executives) 94 
conference hosted by Apede (Panamaian Association of Business 
Executives) on 9 April. He strongly criticized the Endara 
administration for "being incapable of solving the country's 
social problems." He said as comptroller general he contributed 
to development "through strict fiscal control." Early 
polarization among ruling parties has resulted in "paralyzation 
of the government's development plans." (Panama City LA ESTRELLA 
DE PANAMA in Spanish 10 Apr 94 p 48) 
  Carles toured the public market, accompanied by his running 
mates and Panama City mayoral candidate Omayra Correa on 13 
April. Carles chatted with vendors and told them he, as 
president, will improve conditions at the market. (Panama City 
Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 13 Apr 94) 
  Ruben Blades, Papa Egoro Movement, MPE, presidential 
candidate, spoke to the Jewish charity association B'Nai B'Rith 
on 7 April. He said hunger and poverty and not ideological 
positions are the real enemies of personal wealth. He said "the 
comfort we enjoy today does not free us from responsibility, 
because that comfort could suddenly disappear if the current 
precepts and poor examples of private and government corruption 
continue to prevail." (Panama City LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA in 
Spanish 8 Apr 94 p 2A) 
  Blades took his campaign to Chepo, a rural area east of 
Panama City, on 11 April. He walked with the people and went 
for a bicycle ride. Citing recent poll results and his campaign 
expenditures, Blades said: "That is an example of what good 
administration can do. We have spent only $50,000, and we are 
in second place." (Panama City Circuito RPC Television in 
Spanish 2300 GMT 11 Apr 94) 
  The National Popular Party, PNP, announced on 12 April it 
will endorse the MPE and the Blades ticket for the 8 May 
presidential elections. Party President Jorge Flores said 
Blades "is responsible and honest and will do a good job." 
(Panama City Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 12 Apr 
94) 
  Presidential candidate Mireya Moscoso de Gruber, of the 
ruling Arnulfist Party, PA, while campaigning in Arraijan 
District on 9 April, affirmed the PRD and the PA will polarize 
the final race for the presidency. She said "there will be two 
options -- a government for all Panamanians or a return to the 
past." (Panama City LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA in Spanish 10 Apr 94 
p 1A) 
  In Colon, Gruber outlined her plans for the recovery of the 
province's economy. "There is much work to be done in Colon, 
but, as I have said before, I have more than enough energy and 
courage," Gruber said during a rally in downtown Colon. (Panama 
City Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 11 Apr 94) 
  Presidential Candidate Eduardo Vallarino, of the Christian 
Democratic Party, PDC, told reporters on 7 April Panama's image 
abroad is poor, but the U.S. State Department report on drug 
trafficking and money laundering has worsened it. He called on 
all candidates "to file a detailed declaration of our assets" 
and, what he considered more important, "an explanation of from 
where the millions of dollars being spent on advertising 
campaigns" is coming. (Panama City LA PRENSA in Spanish 8 Apr 94 
p 1) 
  Presidential candidates Perez and Carles have addressed a 
meeting of the Panama Canal chapter of the AFL-CIO. Perez 
suggested creation of a "full time presidential commission to 
reinforce the efforts of canal operations." He said he will 
"prevent expertise from leaving the country, exclude U.S. laws 
from the Panama Canal, and fulfill the Torrijos Carter Treaty." 
Meanwhile, Carles said that finally, "after 17 years, the canal 
will be ours, and the future belongs to all Panamanians." 
(Panama City LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA in Spanish 8 Apr 94 p 2A) 
  Presidential candidates Perez, Carles, Vallarino, and Munoz 
were present for a special forum hosted by the Single National 
Union of Construction and Related Workers on 7 April. They 
agreed on the need for reforms to the labor code. Vallarino 
said he "would not change anything which the unions did not 
propose." Perez said "there is no way we can ask the workers to 
sacrifice what they have earned." Carles said, however, any 
changes "will depend on what would work and how it would work. 
We must speak to the workers first." (Panama City LA ESTRELLA 
DE PANAMA in Spanish 8 Apr 94 p 4A) 
  Vice presidential candidates Guillermo Quijano and Tomas 
Herrera of the Molirena-Change '94 Alliance; Tomas Altamirano 
Duque of the PRD; Raul Ossa of the PDC; Raul Bernal of the PPD; 
and Fernando Manfredo and Ricardo Bermudez of the MPE 
participated in the Apede and Cade annual conference on 8 April. 
All candidates agreed there is a "moral crisis" in Panama. 
Quijano said the solution lies in giving the people "real 
alternatives, instead of false promises." Altamirano blamed the 
crisis on the "unemployment rate, extreme poverty, and unequal 
distribution of wealth." Ossa called for a "national concerted" 
effort to face the problem. Manfredo and Bermudez outlined 
their party's government plan for facing the issue, stating the 
MPE is the "only party to have presented a serious plan." 
(Panama City LA PRENSA in Spanish 9 Apr 94 p 1A) 
  On April 6 the Federico Guerra Corporation released the 
results of its latest poll, taken between 29 March and 3 April. 
Perez still leads with 33.2 percent. The new figures show 
Blades and the MPE taking second place with 15 percent over 
Carles, who totaled 14.5 percent. Gruber follows with a close 
14.4 percent behind Carles; Vallarino, with 2.8 percent; Lewis, 
with 2.4 percent, and Munoz, with 0.5 percent follow. The 
report states "Blades gained 3.8 percent, Carles lost 2.3 
points, and Gruber increased her support by 2.2 percent" over 
the previous poll taken from 12 to 15 March. (Panama City LA 
ESTRELLA DE PANAMA in Spanish 7 Apr 94 p 4A) 
  A special Dichter and Neira poll on the 11 April television 
presidential debate indicates Blades won by 36.8 percent, 
followed by Perez, with 30.1 percent, Carles, with 15 percent, 
and Vallarino, with 9.4 percent. When asked if the debate had 
made them change their mind about their favorite candidate, 75.9 
percent said no, 11 percent gave no answer, and 15 percent said 
yes. (Panama City LA PRENSA in Spanish 12 Apr 94 p 1A) 
  On 12 April Dichter and Neira also released the results of a 
poll taken from 8 to 10 April. The results show Perez still 
leads with 34.5 percent, while Carles is second, with 18.6 
percent. Blades follows with 17.3 points. Gruber is next, with 
11.3 points, and Vallarino, who lost some support, totaled 2.7 
percent. Perez slipped five percentage points; Carles gained 
1.9 percentage points; Blades won 2.9 percent, and Gruber inched 
up .8 percent. (Panama City LA PRENSA in Spanish 13 Apr 94 p 1A)

  [Text] Panama City, 18 Apr (ACAN) -- Civil Aeronautics 
Director Zosimo Guardia revealed today that Panamanian 
authorities have penalized the U.S. company United Airlines by 
suspending its operations for violating Panamanian regulations 
on airfares. 
  Guardia said during a news conference that the conflict 
arose 
when United Airlines began offering a special promotion which 
was valid until 30 June. According to the advertisement, 
travelers would get a free ticket if they purchased their ticket 
through American Express. 
  Guardia clarified that this promotion violates the stability 
of airfares. After the airline failed to cancel the promotion 
following numerous complaints, it was decided on 29 March to 
impose a $2,000 fine. 
  According to Guardia, the U.S. company failed to make a down 
payment on the $2,000 fine, so its operating permit was 
suspended on 15 April. 
  Since that time, a United Airlines plane has been parked at 
Tocumen International Airport unable to take off. 
  Travel agencies told ACAN that United Airlines canceled the 
travel promotion on 18 April, but the company has not made an 
official announcement on the matter.

  [Text] Osorno -- Investigative Police have put under the 
jurisdiction of a court four members of a Movement of the 
Revolutionary Left (MIR) faction called the National Liberation 
Army who are reportedly responsible for, among other crimes, the 
murder of retired General Renato Varela Correa. 
  The police report indicates that one year ago the arrested 
people created a criminal terrorist group based on the 
military-political concepts sustained by the old MIR. They are 
currently in the formative stage, seeking resources for their 
infrastructure and recruiting militants, mainly in area 
universities. 
  The arrested, who have been identified as university 
students, are Pedro Enrique Rozas Aravena, 29, alias "Comandante 
Puren or Sebastian" who is in charge of the group's political 
leadership in the southern zone; Marcelo Alejandro Gaete 
Mancilla, 22; Eric Ulises Maichin Naipan, 27; and Agustin 
Ricardo Pena Aguilera, 28. Subversive literature and hand 
weapons were found in their possession. 
  The crimes committed by the group include: On 30 July 1993, 
the group held up the Inglesa foundry plant in Santiago's Maipu 
districts, stealing 8 million pesos and shooting the security 
manager, retired General Renato Varela, who was director of the 
Famae [Army Ordnance] and minister vice president of Corfo 
[Production Development Corporation], and died on 7 August. The 
group also held up the Condell finance company in Osorno and set 
a bomb in the Christian Democratic Party's headquarters in 
Osorno. 
  The arrested were put under the jurisdiction of the First 
Criminal Court of Osorno.

  [Excerpt] Television Nacional and Channel 13 have signed an 
agreement to jointly transmit programs produced by both channels 
through the international station, by means of our signal, which 
we have been transmitting since 1988. 
  Over the past six years the signal of Television Nacional de 
Chile has gained a significant audience in Argentina, besides 
having an important presence in Bolivia, Ecuador, Paraguay, 
Peru, Uruguay, and even the south of Brazil. Making the country 
known through the television screen is an important 
responsibility. This company thinks it has succeeded. 
  But in a world where communications play an essential role, 
Television Nacional has wanted to take a new step forward. Its 
highest authorities, headed by Executive Director Jorge 
Navarrete, signed an agreement with the Television Corporation 
of the Catholic University of Chile directed by Heliodoro 
Rodriguez. With this agreement the two most important channels 
of the country will put together their most important programs 
for the generation, transmission, and sale of a single and 
common international signal, which will be transmitted through 
satellite and will be distributed essentially by cable 
television, directed to the Spanish-speaking people of the 
entire continent. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Adela Leal] </F>
  [Text] Interior Minister Ramon Escovar Salom told the 
Permanent Secretariat of the National Council for Defense and 
Security [Seconasede] on 12 April the flow of illegal aliens, 
drug trafficking, and transculturation constitute the greatest 
threats to national security. Regarding the flow of illegal 
aliens, Escovar said the "first problem" that must be tackled to 
solve the illegal aliens problem is the Sectorial General 
Directorate of Identification and Control of Foreigners [Diex], 
which must be revamped. 
  Escovar made this statement at the opening of the First 
Round 
of Conferences on Security and Defense, organized by Seconasede, 
which is being held on 12, 13, and 14 April. Escovar and other 
prominent individuals are scheduled to participate at this 
meeting. 
  During his speech, Escovar mentioned the subject of 
Venezuela: its political situation and effects on security and 
defense. Escovar said, among other things, national security and 
defense have several serious and complex problems. The first 
problem is the need to control the undetermined number of 
illegal aliens in the country, a situation that creates several 
problems. 
  He conceded there are irregularities regarding the 
identification of foreigners. Many of these irregularities have 
long existed and have done the country much harm. He said 
emphatically Diex constitutes the first problem that must be 
tackled. "That is what I am doing," he said categorically. 
<H5>  Transculturation </H5>
  In countries, such as Venezuela, weakened and troubled by 
foreign debt, corruption, and disorganization, it is not enough 
to invoke patriotic emblems and sing the national anthem when 
referring to national sovereignty, but it is also necessary to 
understand more profound aspects that affect sovereignty. 
  In this respect, Escovar said in addition to the 
above-mentioned problems the country is threatened by the drug 
problem, an unusual and highly dangerous one. Drugs and its 
geopolitical ramifications have brought a new element to the 
situation which, according to Escovar, has a nullifying effect 
on society, its health and morals. Escovar warned that is the 
scenario and those are the new actors. 
  Regarding transculturation, which seriously harms our 
sovereignty, he said it reaches Venezuelans via satellite dishes 
and the media. 
<H5>  Political Reforms </H5>
  Concerning reforms, he said the inclusion of the referendum 
on impeachment must be one of the fundamental aspects to be 
discussed during the discussion on constitutional reform, 
scheduled to take place at Congress within the next few days. 
  "I do not think it is the only reform the country is 
demanding, but in political matters the referendum on 
impeachment is fundamental in making in-depth changes in 
Venezuelan society," he said. 
  In this regard he said the country is anxious to 
relegitimize 
the system, which is "evidently losing legitimacy." At this 
moment, he said, the discussion of constitutional reforms left 
pending by the previous Congress is being accelerated. There is 
a fundamental element, however, if we want to make a true 
change, which is to incorporate citizens into the decisionmaking 
process. This can only be achieved via a referendum.

<F P=106> [From the "Midday Television Newscast"] </F>
  [Text] The Colombian Government has reacted angrily to an 
Amnesty International document that asks the United States to 
suspend military aid to Colombia because of an alleged increase 
in human rights violations. 
  The government today vigorously denied the Amnesty 
International report, which asks the U.S. Government to suspend 
or freeze military aid to Colombia because this aid is being 
diverted to help repress and violate human rights. According to 
Government Minister Fabio Villegas Ramirez, the international 
organization is not only misinformed, but it has been acting in 
an ill-intentioned and biased manner. 
  [Begin Villegas recording] There is true ill-will in 
statements Amnesty International frequently issues on Colombia. 
To ignore the efforts that Colombia has made in the area of 
human rights, the strengthening of our institutions to face 
these problems, and the fact that the 1991 reform of the 
Constitution is based on this nation's desire to overcome its 
human rights problems -- all of this goes beyond simple 
misinformation on behalf of Amnesty International. It shows 
bias in the organization's assessment of Colombia. [end 
recording] 
  Although there is no legal recourse by which the government 
can report these irregularities by Amnesty International to 
another international organization, Colombia will continue its 
policy of using evidence to prove that it is taking steps to 
halt human rights violations.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin </F>
Posada in Madrid by Dario Arizmendi in Santa Fe de Bogota; from 
"Caracol's 0600 to 0900" newscast -- live] 
  [Text] [Arizmendi] What is the outcome of your trip, during 
which you even met with Russian President Boris Yeltsin? 
  [Sanin] After a complete collapse of the Berlin Wall, we do 
not have the proper political or legal instruments for a 
bilateral and multilateral relationship between Latin America 
and these countries of eastern Europe. 
  [Arizmendi] What can you tell us about President Boris 
Yeltsin's visit to Colombia? 
  [Sanin] He was interested in visiting Latin America, 
especially Colombia, but obviously every visit by a head of 
state has to be a productive step forward in relations. It 
cannot be just a visit to make a speech or a visit for protocol 
reasons. A visit of this type has to result in significant 
opportunities for improved cooperation. He asked me to prepare 
15 agreements, and once they are prepared, he would be delighted 
to visit Colombia. 
  [Arizmendi] What about the rest of the countries you 
visited, 
Romania and Hungary? 
  [Sanin] Important processes are being conducted in the Czech 
Republic, for example. There is a great consensus on the 
political and economic reforms. The transformations being 
carried out in that country in a few years since the 1989 velvet 
revolution are impressive. It is impressive to see how the 
parliament, the president, the prime minister, the foreign trade 
minister, the foreign minister, and the people have united to 
transform their society. Shops are opening up every day. The 
arts are developing today more than ever. There is a different 
political education here. Freedom is in vogue and it is leading 
to the flowering of each one of man's expressions. It is 
marvelous to see this awakening. 
  In Romania the situation is different. There is a little 
more controversy, but it is marvelous to see what President Ion 
Iliescu and his government are doing. The parliament is also 
working to achieve political and economic transformations as 
soon as possible. They are awakening to this new economic 
reality. Their privatization process is slower, but it is 
evident that their economy, political opportunities, and 
freedoms are opening up. In Romania, I stayed at the house 
where Nicolae Ceausescu used to live. It was quite impressive. 
  [Arizmendi] Did spirits show up around you? Perhaps Dracula? 
  [Sanin, laughing] Ceausescu's spirit may have been around 
us. 
We were scared. 
  [Arizmendi] You are not easy to scare. Not even Dracula can 
frighten you. 
  [Sanin] The spirit of Ceausescu can scare anyone. 
  [Arizmendi] During your visit to Moscow, you made a historic 
achievement. You were able to get the Russians to condemn the 
armed struggle in Colombia. How important is the Russian 
position for the Colombian Government? 
  [Sanin] It is very significant politically because, as we 
discussed it there, for many years Russia and the former USSR 
promoted the armed struggle in Colombia. It was a way of 
intervening in the internal affairs of other countries. Today, 
they recognize our democracy and they recognize opportunities 
for freedom. They have also changed to believe it is best to 
work through proselytism, regardless of what their ideology may 
be, than to resort to the use of arms. We all want revolutions 
and more just societies to meet the needs of the people. 
  [Arizmendi] The Ibero-American Summit will be held in 
Cartagena on 14 and 15 June of the present year. Mrs. Maria 
Emma Mejia, the Colombian ambassador to Spain, had the 
opportunity to talk about the extent of this meeting the day 
before yesterday. What heads of state have already confirmed 
their attendance? 
  [Sanin] All of them. All heads of state and presidents will 
attend the summit. Spanish King Juan Carlos I will also attend 
the Fourth Ibero-American Summit. I want to praise the efforts 
of the Colombian ambassador to Spain and the efforts of all 
embassy officials who worked hard for two and one-half months to 
show our works of art, science, and literature during a 
Colombian exhibit in Madrid. I also want to congratulate 
Caracol journalist Carlos Penaloza, who has made a great effort 
to demonstrate Colombia's real image in Spain and Europe. They 
are portraying an image that is not one of violence as is 
sometimes depicted by the media. They are demonstrating our 
country's values abroad.

    [Editorial Report] Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 
on 10 April carried a 1,200-word interview on page 8a with 
Andres Pastrana, presidential candidate for the Colombian 
Conservative Party, by El TIEMPO editor Jorge Gonzalez, 
conducted on the slopes of Sierra Nevada, in the area between 
Santa Marta and Cienega. Commenting on the results of a poll 
taken by EL TIEMPO in which Liberal Party, PL, presidential 
candidate Ernesto Samper is leading, Pastrana feels that was to 
be expected right after the PL convention and notes the 
situation will change in the days to come because the 
presidential campaign has gotten under way. 
  When Gonzalez notes that the selection of his running mate 
may have hurt his campaign, Pastrana begins by saying he had 
asked current Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin to accept the 
nomination, but she declined. "People are beginning to 
realize," he adds, that Luis Fernando Ramirez is a good choice 
"because he embodies the results of the struggle of the people 
from rural areas." 
  Gonzalez mentions the possibility of Samper reaching an 
understanding with Antonio Navarro Wolff of the April 19 
Movement, but in Pastrana's opinion the M-19 has clear 
ideological differences with Samper. Pastrana then adds he has 
received the endorsement of Gustavo Rojas, son of Gustavo Rojas 
Pinilla and "true representative of the Anepo [National Popular 
Alliance] interests." "What we have sought from the PL is the 
everyday citizens, the civic and business leaders, the new man. 
That also applies to independent conservatives. The specific 
strength of a candidacy can hardly be gauged by the number of 
endorsements," he remarks. 
  When asked if there was no coincidence that he set himself 
apart from the conservative congressional candidates, Pastrana 
replies: "What I wanted was to maintain total independence with 
regard to past elections. I want to act in line with my 
supraparty candidacy. I did not endorse those liberals who were 
elected to the Congress and are now supporting my candidacy." 
He adds the situation changed after the elections. "That is 
why I created a multiparty political committee, representing the 
PL, Conservative Party, and National Salvation Movement, which 
will be tasked with a large part of the political organization, 
together with the National Conservative Directorate." 
  In answering a question as to whether he has gone from a 
multiparty candidate to the candidate of one party, Pastrana 
states that those who have tried to label him a conservative 
have failed "because my actions are those of an open-minded, 
democratic, multiparty man." "There is room for liberals, 
conservatives, and independents in a national government," he 
adds.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on developments related to the elections scheduled for 
29 May 1994. 
  On 9 April several politicians expressed their support to 
Liberal Party presidential candidate Ernesto Samper, among them 
conservative leaders Jaime Arias Ramirez, Gustavo Rodriguez 
Vargas, and Alvaro Paba. Senators Bernardo Gutierrez and Anibal 
Palacios, of the Hope, Peace, and Liberty Party, and Pastor 
Dario Silva Silva also announced they will support Samper. 
(Santa Fe de Bogota Inravision Television Cadena 1 in Spanish 
1800 9 Apr 94) 
  During his tour of the Atlantic Coast, Conservative Party 
presidential candidate Andres Pastrana visited the municipality 
of Arjona, Bolivar Department. In Santa Marta, more than 15,000 
persons gathered at the Cathedral Plaza to participate in a 
rally. A large crowd welcomed him in Soledad, Atlantico. On 9 
April, Pastrana visited several towns in Sucre and Bolivar 
Departments, including Tolu, Since, Maria la Baja, and 
Cincelejo. Pastrana was accompanied by several Liberal Party, 
PL, leaders, who explained their reasons for supporting him. 
(Santa Fe de Bogota Inravision Television Cadena 1 in Spanish 
0130 GMT 10 Apr 94) 
  Radio station RCN on 11 April reported the results of a poll 
conducted by Infomaster Colombia, which showed that PL candidate 
Ernesto Samper would be the chosen candidate to replace 
President Cesar Gaviria, but would have to go to runoff 
elections with Conservative candidate Andres Pastrana. 
According to the survey, Samper would receive 47 percent of the 
votes in the first round of elections scheduled for 29 May, 
while Conservative Party candidate would garner 38 percent. 
Samper would win the runoff elections with 48 percent of the 
votes, while Pastrana would obtain 41 percent. The survey 
reflects the opinion of some 1,550 voters polled in 17 cities 
from 28 march to 1 April. (Hamburg DPA in Spanish 1855 GMT 11 
Apr 94) 
  Presidential candidate Ernesto Samper referred to the 
unemployment problem, saying that "we hope to create 350,000 
jobs through microenterprises, 120,000 through infrastructure, 
100,000 in social investments, and 200,000 by doubling our 
exports." (Santa Fe de Bogota Inravision Television Cadena 1 in

<F P=106> [Interview with Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina; </F>
place and date not given] 
  [Text] [NOTICIAS] What is your opinion as to why the 
Paraguayan Government did not receive you officially? 
  [Robaina] I am not here on an official visit; I am visiting 
Paraguay within the framework of a work schedule that I have for 
several Latin American countries. Especially those countries 
that are currently related to the activities of the Common 
Market of the South (Mercosur). For me, the visit's nature is 
not important, but the visit in itself is. 
  [NOTICIAS] What does the fact that Paraguay does not 
maintain diplomatic relations with Cuba mean to you? 
  [Robaina] I did not come here to discuss whether there will 
be diplomatic relations between Paraguay and Cuba. I did not 
come here to discuss the Paraguayan Government's frame of mind 
regarding relations with Cuba. That is not the purpose of my 
visit. 
  [NOTICIAS] In which spheres can Cuba and Paraguay advance 
jointly? 
  [Robaina] We want Paraguayan businessmen to learn about the 
possibilities of investment that Cuba is opening up for all 
countries. As brother peoples, the two countries need 
integration. 
  [NOTICIAS] How do you manage in your country, taking into 
account the fact that the economic blockade is still being 
imposed? 
  [Robaina] We are suffering from the effects of an escalated 
blockade. Cuba needs an economic model that includes opening 
the country up to the world, thus occupying a privileged place 
in the group of nations. 
  [NOTICIAS] What mechanisms is Cuba using to counter the 
blockade? 
  [Robaina] To try and exist through resistance, and this can 
be done because the people are technically and scientifically 
prepared. We are enduring the blockade with what we have done in 
the social sector, and we have the resources. Despite the 
blockade, some countries have economic relations with us. 
  [NOTICIAS] Paraguay has voted in favor of the blockade 
against your country. 
  [Robaina] I did not come here to discuss that. The people 
have nothing to do with the vote of their representatives. The 
blockade is harsh and one must think of the consequences of it. 
  [NOTICIAS] What are those consequences? 
  [Robaina] Despite the blockade that has been imposed by the 
powers, we are convinced that in Cuba we are implementing a 
model unique in the world, and that I believe is giving us 
results because there is sufficient stability in the country and 
good management of the entire system. 
  [NOTICIAS] Will you invite other groups to visit your 
country? 
  [Robaina] We currently have exchanges between Cuban and 
Paraguayan parliamentarians. Not so very long ago my country 
received parliamentarians who were able to observe our reality. 
  We are looking into the real possibility of inviting other 
Paraguayan delegations to Cuba so they can truly learn about its 
social comportment in all its manifestations. 
  [NOTICIAS] What were the results of your dialogue with the 
representatives of our Foreign Ministry? 
  [Robaina] The dialogue was extremely fruitful and very 
useful because we walked the path that motivated our visit here. 
I believe that the path that will lead us to really get to know 
each other is a very important aspect for us. 
  [NOTICIAS] Are you happy with the treatment you received 
from our diplomatic representatives? 
  [Robaina] There is nothing to make me feel unhappy, and 
besides this is not the first country that I have visited that 
does not have officially established diplomatic relations with 
us.

  [Text] Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina on 16 April 
warned that Paraguayan businessmen who "want to invest in the 
Caribbean island will have to endure a lot of pressure. There 
must be no doubt about this. But if he overcomes this stage of 
foreign pressure he can be quite sure he will be successful." 
  He explained that the lack of raw materials or qualified 
labor is not the investment problem in Cuba; it is the pressure 
that will be applied by U.S. businessmen. "For every 10 people 
who want to invest in Cuba, only two stay because he who 
believes he is the owner of the hemisphere and the world 
threatens the businessmen with ruining their businesses in other 
places," he said. 
  Notwithstanding, he invited, as he has done in other South 
American countries, a group of Paraguayans to visit Cuba and 
learn about its reality, and where they will have the 
opportunity of talking with specialists in various sectors and 
thus observe what is occurring in Cuba. He also indicated that 
they will be able to speak with foreign businessmen who already 
have risked investing in the island so they can learn the truth. 
  When he was asked whether trade would be difficult because 
Paraguay does not maintain diplomatic relations with Cuba, he 
said no. "Diplomatic relations are not justified when the 
benefits do not reach the people. In that case it is much more 
convenient to have trade relations so we Cubans do not keep our 
products and so Latin America can sell us what we need," he 
said. As an example, he indicated that diplomatic relations 
with Colombia began through trade relations. 
  Robaina concluded his unofficial visit to our country during 
the afternoon of 16 April. At 1530 he went to Silvio Pettirossi 
Airport to board a private plane, in which he arrived on 15 
April, to fly to Posadas (Argentina)

  [Text] Former President General Andres Rodriguez, retired, 
stated on 16 April that he had spoken with Fidel Castro four 
times when, together with other Latin American countries, they 
asked him to put his country on the road to democracy, something 
the Cuban leader refused to do. "Moreover, we can now happily 
observe that there is the beginning of an opening on the 
Caribbean island," Rodriguez said after a meeting with Cuban 
Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina at his home in the Asuncion 
neighborhood of Las Carmelitas. 
  "The systems that are in force in friendly countries must be 
respected, but at least we must indicate the interest that 
exists in wanting them to follow the same (democratic) path and 
the same course to improve relations between one country and 
another," [Juan Carlos] Wasmosy's predecessor said. 
  He stated that it has not been possible until now to reach a 
stage of transition in Cuba like the stage occurring in our 
country, but he expressed his hope that this democratic opening 
will open up new horizons and thus involve the political sector. 
  When asked if the Wasmosy government's position of not 
maintaining diplomatic relations with Cuba is the best one, 
Rodriguez said: "Diplomatic relations cannot be discussed 
before Cuba has a democratic system or opening. The foreign 
minister (Luis Maria Ramirez Boettner) is trying out the 
possibility of maintaining trade relations. But at this time I 
cannot give an opinion; only the government and president can 
give an opinion." 
  Rodriguez stated that he would vote in favor of the U.S. 
blockade of Cuba if the possibility arose in an international 
forum, such as the occasion on 3 November 1993 when our country 
voted against Cuba. Paraguay was the only Latin American country 
to do so with the exception of Argentina, which abstained.

  [Text] Mexico City, 13 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- Daniel Dultzin, 
Mexican Foreign Relations Secretariat economic director, said 
that Mexico made "minimal" commitments and agreed to pay an 
annual membership fee of $2.6 million to join the OECD. 
  The official added that the commitments were assumed with 
[word indistinct] in the legislation and the Mexican economic 
situation and that equitable treatment was also considered, as 
well as advancements in economic deregulation insofar as 
economic, political, and legal conditions allow. 
  He said that among the most difficult requirements Mexico 
must meet is to achieve strong, sustained growth [words 
indistinct] to ensure that foreign businessmen will have greater 
freedom to conduct all types of business in Mexico. 
  Dultzin also said that Mexico will receive the same 
treatment 
as other members [words indistinct] of the activities [words 
indistinct] Mexicans in those nations. 
  As for the membership fee, Dultzin, who has also served as 
technical coordinator for Mexico's integration process with the 
OECD since 1993, emphasized that the members' annual 
contributions, determined by GDP, population, and exchange rate, 
finance the organization. 
  He also pointed out that joining the international 
organization could mean that the Mexican public debt will go 
from a 100-percent risk factor [ponderacion] to being risk free, 
as is the case with the U.S., German, French, and British debts. 
  Loans extended to Mexican banks, instead of being subject to 
a 100-percent risk factor, as is currently the case, would only 
be subject to 20 percent. Dultzin explained, however, that the 
country will not receive the benefit automatically. 
  Mexico had to take several measures to be accepted into the 
OECD, such as adjusting [words indistinct] and satisfying 
minimum maritime transportation safety requirements. 
  Dultzin indicated that Mexico's deep sea fishing fleet meets 
current safety requirements, while the country's freighters will 
be given a stipulated period of time to fulfill the requirements. 
  He added that consultations were made with the United States 
and Canada to solve issues related to the automobile industry 
included in the free trade agreement negotiations. 
  The Mexican official indicated that Mexico's OECD admittance 
date, 24 March, had been anticipated from the beginning of the 
year, which encouraged more long-term confidence and 
self-confidence among Mexicans. 
  Mexico established relations with the OECD in 1982 after 
joining the organization's Steel Committee, where it gradually 
increased its participation until it was finally accepted in 
1990 as a full member. 
  In 1991, arrangements were made for an OECD mission [words 
indistinct] after which Mexico was accepted as an observer in 
several of the organization's committees.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina by German </F>
Sopena in Buenos Aires; date not given] 
  [Text] [Sopena] Some days ago, you were the first one to 
confirm that Fidel Castro had a telephone conversation with 
Carlos Menem. How many telephone contacts did they have and 
what did they discuss? 
  [Robaina] As far as I know, there was only one telephone 
conversation arranged by a common friend. With regard to the 
topic of their conversation, I think that President Menem's 
account of this talk corresponded better with the truth. In 
other words, they discussed subjects that do not necessarily 
have anything to do with politics. 
  [Sopena] With regard to the different approaches adopted by 
Menem and Castro, why does it bother Cuba that a democratically 
elected Latin American president, whether Menem or any other, 
should say that Cuban citizens also ought to have the 
opportunity to choose their rulers in freely contested elections? 
  [Robaina] It does not bother us at all, but I think that 
both 
countries face different realities. I believe that we should 
not be questioned as if we lived in a normal country because my 
country continues to be a country whose living conditions are 
those of a besieged stronghold. And a besieged stronghold 
cannot afford the luxuries it would aspire to if it lived under 
normal conditions. 
  [Sopena] Has the accession of Bill Clinton to the U.S. 
presidency somehow changed things? 
  [Robaina] No. Perhaps the only substantial public change is 
that Clinton is not as aggressive as Bush. But leaving this 
consideration aside, perhaps there is an even more repressive 
stance on the trade embargo. Hence, there is no reason 
whatsoever for being overly enthusiastic. 
  [Sopena] Let us imagine a possible scenario in which, in a 
move comparable to Nixon when he recognized the PRC, President 
Clinton decided to lift the embargo and Cuba became a country 
just like the others. What would change in Cuba? Would there 
be an economic and political opening? 
  [Robaina] Well, seeing is believing. However, I would say 
that, under normal living conditions, Cuba will develop a work 
system in which everything may be analyzed. 
  [Sopena] The embargo seems to be the main argument put 
forward to explain Cuba's dire financial straits. But is it not 
a way to hide the domestic economic system's inherent 
inefficiencies, which have nothing to do with the embargo? 
  [Robaina] There is no denying the fact that there are 
inefficiencies but, comparatively, the embargo continues to be 
the main cause of our problems. 
  [Sopena] How far will the current economic opening drive go? 
  [Robaina] As far as it can adapt to our circumstances. We 
will widen those possibilities as we become more acquainted with 
the system once the foreign capital we need comes to our country 
and is channeled into investments. 
  [Sopena] Would Cuba privatize some sectors of its economy? 
  [Robaina] We believe the state has proved that it is 
efficient in many areas. There are others, however, in which we 
have started to work together with the private sector. 
Nevertheless, I think that a long road lies ahead of us so it 
is still too early to evaluate what we will do afterward. 
  [Sopena] Does Castro wholly mistrust private activity? 
  [Robaina] Both Castro and all of us have seen that in some 
places where the economy is administered by the private sector 
it has proved to be efficient whereas in other places it has 
not. Moreover, I believe that the neoliberal model has yielded 
good results in some places and is teaching us things that we 
have to study in-depth. This includes the partnership with the 
private sector, and even the privatization of what has to be 
privatized in some areas. However, one should not run away with 
the idea that these changes will come overnight. 
  [Sopena] The world is changing rapidly nowadays. Does Cuba 
not run the risk of staying behind? 
  [Robaina] We cannot afford to make mistakes because what 
others do without being subject to pressure, we must accomplish 
under pressure.

<F P=106> [Interview with Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo by Paz </F>
Tejerina in Buenos Aires on 10 April] 
  [Text] [Tejerina] Will there be changes in the economic 
plan after the elections? 
  [Cavallo] No. The election results, in this case, do not 
have much bearing on the economic policy. We are going to 
maintain the same course foreseen in the Argentina is Growing 
program. I do not understand those who contend that there is a 
clash between Cavallo and the president. The success of the 
president's economic policy worked to our advantage in the 
elections. Now the economic policy will be maintained and will 
continue to have the same favorable repercussions as it has had 
so far. 
  [Tejerina] Should we expect consumption to be more heavily 
taxed now that we are to start a new stage geared to increasing 
domestic savings? 
  [Cavallo] There may be a tariff improvement, but domestic 
taxes will not be increased. Consumption already is 
sufficiently taxed so as to discourage it. Now we must try to 
control it, which does not mean it will go down. 
  [Tejerina] Will you resort to an increase in interest rates? 
  [Cavallo] That will come as a matter of course; interest on 
housing anyway, because the average 16 percent currently in 
effect is enough to provide enough protection to banks. 
  We are working on a reorientation of the domestic economic 
scheme based on decisions made by companies and entrepreneurs. 
We have already provided them with concrete elements to 
understand this process. 
  [Tejerina] Do you feel reassured by the PJ's [Justicialist 
Party] victory in Santiago del Estero Province? 
  [Cavallo] Victory is important. Federal trustee [Juan] 
Schiaretti accomplished a remarkable task. He reorganized 
Santiago del Estero and this was reflected in the election 
results. 
  In other provinces, however, spending has increased. It is 
important to change this. The privatization of the National 
Savings and Insurance Fund, for example, will prevent the state 
from running into further debt. Furthermore, we will generate 
benefits by cutting back on expenditures.

  [Text] A group of 136 Brazilian gold miners have been 
besieged by Venezuelan soldiers 1 km from the Brazilian border, 
in the jungle area bordering western Roraima. 
  The miners hid in the jungle last week, escaping a military 
operation set in motion by Venezuela to repress gold mining in 
its territory. 
  One miner died and seven others -- who are still being 
treated by their fellow miners -- were seriously wounded. 
  Itamaraty has tried to convince Caracas to permit a joint 
operation for rescuing the besieged miners, who do not want to 
surrender to Venezuelan soldiers, fearing retaliation. 
  In Brasilia, diplomats who are following the developments 
have said that if no negotiated solution is found the Amazonas 
Military Command will be ordered to unilaterally perform the 
action. 
  The report was not officially confirmed, but it prompted 
consultations between Itamaraty and the Army leadership. 
  Brazil and Venezuela are playing with fire. 
  The demarcation of their borders is imprecise and dangerous, 
as in situations of tension when the two countries' forces come 
too close to one another. 
  Jose Altino, president of the Trade Union Gold Miners of the 
Legal Amazonas, yesterday tried to confirm that a new, identical 
incident occurred north of Roraima.

  [Text] Lima, 18 Apr (EFE) -- The peace proposal made by the 
Shining Path [SL] on 16 April over a Lima television channel has 
created some confusion and led to some speculation regarding 
President Alberto Fujimori's relationship with the SL 
leadership, which may end in amnesty for all terrorists. 
  The proposal made by one of the hooded terrorists who 
appears 
on the video sent to several television channels points out the 
need for a peace agreement, under the condition that the 
terrorists suspend their attacks and the government its 
antiterrorist struggle. 
  During the political program "En Directo" 
[Straightforwardly], broadcast on 17 April in the evening, 
journalist Fernando Rospigliosi disclosed that President 
Fujimori on 15 April visited the Yanamayo prison where several 
terrorists, among them Osman Morote, who is the second or third 
highest SL leader, are held under arrest. 
  According to Rospigliosi, Morote, with a smile on his face, 
delivered a gift to the president, but as he could not get it 
through the bars, the cell door was opened and Fujimori entered 
it, where he exchanged brief comments with Morote. 
  This year Fujimori also shook hands with SL leader Edmundo 
Cox in the prison where he is being held, and it is said that 
Fujimori sent [Abimael] Guzman a letter on his birthday in 
December, although that information was denied at the time. 
  According to Rospigliosi, these facts "are worrisome" and 
may 
end up with Fujimori, if he runs for reelection in 1995 and 
wins, pardoning the terrorists. 
  However, recently Fujimori asserted that no sentence against 
terrorists, whether they belong to the SL or the Tupac Amaru 
Revolutionary Movement (MRTA), will be reviewed. 
  The fact is that the SL leaders under arrest, since Abimael 
Guzman sent his first two letters to Fujimori in September and 
October 1993 proposing peace, smile and treat the chief of state 
respectfully. 
  There are also versions stating that the terrorists' 
attitude 
is merely a SL maneuver, because in truth they continue their 
attacks, headed by Oscar Ramirez (aka Feliciano) and a group of 
women that have not paid heed to Guzman's order to halt acts of 
violence. 
  In the opinion of terrorism expert Carlos Chipoco, the SL 
wants peace because "it is very weak and virtually defeated from 
the military viewpoint." 
  According to the monthly PERU-PAZ, since Guzman was arrested 
on 12 September 1992, the SL "has been incapable of recovering 
its guerrilla action power" it had before the leader was 
arrested. 
  The latest data reveals that during the first quarter of 
1994, 111 people died as a result of political violence compared 
to 573 for the same period in 1993.

  [Text] Montevideo, 18 Apr (EFE) -- Uruguayan Interior 
Minister Raul Iturria today stressed that there is no evidence 
that this country is being used by international drug 
traffickers for the "laundering" of money, thus denying a recent 
UN report. 
  "There is no evidence that supports that report. This 
already 
has been denied by the Uruguayan Foreign Ministry and our 
intelligence services," the minister emphasized. 
  "There may be people who invest money that has come from not 
very ethical sources, but this does not allow for such a 
vehement assertion that Uruguay is a market where money is 
`laundered,'" Iturria stressed. 
  "Ours is a country that was open to the entry of persons and 
capital long before drug trafficking with its current dimensions 
existed," the interior minister said in remarks to the 
Montevideo media. 
  Iturria indicated that during the past few months it has 
been 
the concern of Uruguayan authorities to equip the National 
Directorate for Drug Fighting with modern technical equipment, 
including materials and technicians from abroad. 
  The minister also indicated that the deputy secretary of the 
presidency himself, Pablo Garcia Pintos, is the coordinator of 
the National Antidrug Fight Board, which is charged with 
drafting policies to confront the trafficking and consumption of 
narcotics. 
  Bank secrecy is one of the fundamental values of Uruguay's 
financial center, but last year the Uruguayan Central Bank 
ordered that the industry's institutions must request and 
identify complementary information on those persons who deposit 
more than $10,000 in order to prevent eventual attempts at money 
"laundering." 
  Three years ago the Uruguayan courts granted the extradition 
to the United States of an Argentine citizen allegedly linked to 
Colombian drug traffickers who had ordered him to invest in real 
estate in Uruguay.

    [Editorial report] Panama City TVN Television Network in 
Spanish at 0109 GMT on 19 April, during its "Dialogue" program, 
broadcasts a live or recorded interview with Panamanian 
President Guillermo Endara by host Luz Maria Noli from its 
studio in Panama City. 
  Endara begins by responding to why he released a video 
montage of footage taken during the Noriega regime. He says: 
"Past government actions are one of the first things open for 
discussion in every political campaign." 
  At 0114 GMT, when asked whether more videos will be 
presented, Endara says: "At this time, I see no reason for 
airing any more videos. I would gladly air more, however, if it 
is regarded as advisable." 
  At 0120 GMT Endara, commenting on the controversy following 
the airing of his video montage, says: "I was unaware this 
announcement would create such repercussions. I confess that I 
am often spontaneous in my actions." He goes on to say: "I did 
not want to create an expectation. I think these videos have a 
great historical importance, at least that is how I felt when I 
received the videotapes on 5 April, only a few days ago." He 
adds: "I am convinced I made the right decision, and I believe 
the people should know about this. I could not hide this from 
the people. I believe it was my patriotic duty to do it; it was 
a president's duty. I did not do it for political reasons but, 
rather, because I wanted the truth to be known just as I saw it 
on 5 April." 
  At 0128 GMT Noli asks Endara if the videos are the property 
of the state or were received from a friendly government. 
Endara replies: "No. These have nothing to with the famous 
boxes in the hands of the U.S. Army." He goes on to say: "No, 
they have nothing to do with those 15,000 boxes. These video 
cassettes were in the Presidential Palace the day I assumed 
office; they were there. I knew about them, but did not pay 
much attention to them. I completely forgot they were there. 
Truly, it was not until recently that I realized they were 
there. I just recently became aware I had known they were there 
for a long time, but I never took them into consideration." 
  At 0134 GMT Endara remarks on from where those videos came, 
saying: "A few months ago, three or four months ago--I really 
cannot remember how long ago--a Presidency official asked me for 
permission to review the videos. I told him: You have much 
work to do. Just stick to your work and forget those video 
cassettes. The official addressed me again a few days later, 
saying: Mr. President, I have a group of very serious people 
who would like to review the cassettes. We will review them in 
our spare time. Will you allow us to do so? I really wanted to 
tell him no, as I had done previously, but I said to myself: 
Well, let them see the videos if they are going to do so in 
their off-duty hours. Thus, I authorized them to do so. They 
reviewed the videos. They reviewed some of the videos, because 
I do not think they could have reviewed them all. As a result, 
on 5 April, they brought me an edited cassette containing most 
of the scenes seen by everybody today. This was when, for the 
first time in all my administration, I realized the importance 
of those video cassettes. I thought it was truly 
inconsequential to review those cassettes, but I was very wrong." 
  At 0138 GMT Noli asks Endara what the objective of his 
airing 
the video montage was. Endara responds: "My fundamental goal, 
and which I hope to have fulfilled, was to report to the people 
facts I could not keep concealed. I could not be an accomplice 
or an accessory to those facts. I had to make them known, 
because I think the theory that the past is not a subject of 
political debate is completely wrong." 
  At 0146 GMT Endara says: "I did not do this to benefit one 
candidate or to harm another. I did it because I had to. The 
political effect has nothing to do with my decision. I did 
consider it because I knew it would have a political effect. I 
considered it but did not do so due to the political effect it 
would have. I did it because I had to and for the reasons I 
just explained. If it benefits young candidate Ruben Blades, 
well, so be it. What can we do? I did not do it for that 
reason. It does not bother me to know it might have benefited 
someone. It does bother me to know it hurt someone, but then, 
someone had to get hurt." 
  At 0153 GMT the network breaks away from the interview to a 
live last-minute report on the Justice and Peace commission 
issuing a statement on the video montage. The network then 
returns to the Endara interview at 0159 GMT. 
  At 0208 GMT Endara comments on his partiality toward the 
presidential candidates, saying: "I never pledged to be 
impartial. I have with me a copy of the speech I delivered at 
the time, and nowhere does it say I must be impartial. Allow me 
to read just a few lines: I must point out and accept that all, 
or at least the majority of those of us who are here--and they 
were the government-- are politicians, belong to political 
parties, have our preferences and sympathies, and profess 
political creeds and doctrines." 
  At 0212 GMT, when asked if he would give up power if the 
Democratic Revolutionary Party, PRD, wins the 8 May elections, 
Endara says: "If on 8 May--I state it now clearly and 
emphatically, as I have told all the members of my cabinet and 
friends and, in particular, the Public Force--Perez Balladares 
and the PRD win the elections, I will not only rightfully turn 
over power to him on 1 September but will even try to do 
something that has never occurred in Panama: I will establish a 
transition period. I pledge that the day after the elections, I 
will invite the winning candidate, either male or female, to the 
Presidency to begin a transition period. I want the incoming 
president who assumes office on 1 September to enjoy what I did 
not have. I did not have a transition period." 
  At 0218 GMT Endara concludes his remarks, at which time the 
network concludes its broadcast.

  [Text] President Rafael Caldera has emphasized that 
constitutional amendments must include provisions for an 
impeachment referendum, that is, the possibility that people 
could impeach any government official, including the president, 
who fails to perform his duties. He made these statements at the 
opening of a play called "Venezuela, Political Crisis, and 
Constitutional Reforms." He also said that participative 
democracy must be the main aspect of the amendments to ensure 
that people will have a say in the nation's important 
sociopolitical issues. He also rejected all doubts that the 
community will not be able to understand the amendments due to 
the large number of articles. 
  [Begin Caldera recording] People will not discuss the 
amendments article by article; they will merely reply yes or no, 
as is done in every democratic country. They will ratify or 
reject the amendments drafted by the National Congress. [end 
recording] 
  He also said that it is necessary to give the Venezuelan 
people a greater opportunity to participate and more power in 
view of the situation the country is currently experiencing.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Miami correspondent Marcos </F>
Castello by Maria Helena Alonso and Roberto Cavada on the "Doing 
Radio" program -- live] 
  [Text] [Alonso] Good morning, Marcos. 
  [Castello] Good morning to all the workers of the "Doing 
Radio" program in Havana, particularly Cavada. 
  [Cavada] Good morning. 
  [Alonso] Today, Marcos is in high spirits because in a few 
hours he will be here in Havana. He has been invited to the 
conference "The Nation and the Emigre Community" scheduled to 
begin Friday at the Convention Center. What do you have to tell 
us? 
  [Castello] I will tell you about the forthcoming conference 
in Havana. Here, the media coverage continues to spiral faster 
and faster. Every television newscast and radio program is 
highlighting the conference "The Nation and the Emigre 
Community." As a matter of fact, there is an increasing number 
of features carrying the opinions of certain people adamantly 
opposed to the conference, people who get to delirious excesses, 
and describe the conference participants as a small group of 
unconditional, resentful, greedy, and privileged people who are 
trying, all of a sudden, to boost their standing to top class. 
  In order words, they are trying by every means to mar the 
legitimacy and importance to the process beginning this weekend 
in Havana. 
  Another interesting bit of news on the media today -- also 
an 
evident symptom of the situation: The front page of THE NUEVO 
HERALD trumpets that this dialogue is creating discord in Havana 
and attributes to an unidentified source reports that there are 
even conflicts between the Cuban Foreign Ministry and the 
Ideological Department of the Communist Party of Cuba regarding 
the purpose of the conference, what ought to be goals, and how 
it ought to be carried out. 
  The climate reached an apex last night. There was a report 
-- 
to call it something, perhaps more than it deserves -- that 
there was an alleged problem with Cuban President Fidel Castro. 
It is being said that a hospital has been taken over. In other 
words, there is all manner of this sort of development common to 
any important event. 
  This situation is typical. There are many people here 
invited 
to the conference, and since Monday they have been departing for 
Havana in accordance with their means. The bulk of the 
delegation will travel tomorrow, at least those who reside in 
the United States, including me. Therefore, I will have a chance 
to greet you. 
  [Alonso] What can I say; we are accustomed to these issues 
being manipulated by the media abroad every time there is a 
meeting of this kind or any new event. We are very used to this. 
However, we are also aware that there are different opinions in 
this regard within the United States, and particularly Florida. 
It is very typical that this comes from the powerful people who 
have the means to manipulate the media and close to politicians. 
However, there are many others who want a rapprochement, family 
reunification, and all those issues to be discussed at the 
conference, and are very happy this event is taking place. 
  [Castello] I could add that the people committed to this 
type 
of attack -- because there is a difference between expressing an 
opinion freely, everyone has the right to oppose or support the 
Havana conference, that is undebatable. However, the manner and 
attitude of this type of attack is precisely one of the things 
that moved the members of the Rio Group -- Brazil, Venezuela, 
Colombia, Mexico, and Argentina -- to express to U.S. Vice 
President Al Gore, the fear of holding in Miami, later this 
year, the hemispheric summit called for by President Bill 
Clinton. Precisely, in fear of the Cuban exiles and the way in 
which they express themselves, they are worried that that 
meeting which is to focus on continental economic and 
environmental problems, economic cooperation, etc., will be 
taken off track by the Cuban issue, once again, due to the 
actions of these Miami far right sectors.

<F P=106> ["Text" of speech by Army General Raul Castro Ruz, minister </F>
of the Revolutionary Armed Forces, commemorating Militiamen's 
Day and the 33d anniversary of the proclamation of the socialist 
nature of the Revolution; in Guantanamo on 16 April -- recorded] 
  [Text] For many years we have observed in La Cabana 
Fortress in Havana the 16 April ceremony commemorating the 
proclamation -- on the eve of the victorious Bay of Pigs 
struggle -- of the socialist nature of our Revolution and 
Militiamen's Day. 
  Today, we want to observe this occasion at Mariana Grajales 
Revolution Square in Guantanamo, at the foot of the monument to 
the mother of the fatherland, an exemplary woman who wrote a 
unique epic for her people with her life and that of her sons, 
whom she fed with the milk of heroism. 
  What better square than this one, where Mariana calls on us 
to kneel and swear to defend the liberty of the fatherland or to 
die in the process, and where she orders us to stand and head 
for the rebel encampment, as she did with all her sons, even the 
youngest? 
  What better region than this, the heroic east, birthplace of 
our revolutions: Guantanamo Province, where there is no beach, 
path, valley, or mountain that does not deserve glorious mention 
in our national history? 
  For the glorious deed of the Mambi rebels in last century's 
three wars against the colonial yoke; 
  For the most tenacious and successful struggle by peasants 
for land at Realengo 18 [20 degrees 18 minutes north 75 degrees 
27 minutes west]; 
  For the solid support it gave to our guerrilla columns to 
found and expand the 2d Frank Pais Eastern Front by giving us 
their better sons, giving us ammunition and all sorts of 
supplies, surrounding us for nine months with their 
uncompromising support until the 1 January triumph; 
  For its contribution to the Bay of Pigs victory. Perhaps not 
enough has been said about the fact that the mercenaries sent to 
land on the coast of Baracoa to open a front to divert us from 
the main thust of the attack did not dare to set foot on 
Guantanamo soil where a people, in arms, alert, and committed to 
annihilate them, waited. 
  Faithful to their tradition of rising to the occasion in the 
face of danger and adversity, the people of Guantanamo, under 
government and party leadership headed by Comrade Juan Carlos 
Robinson, faced with courage, energy, and efficiency the 
devastating effects of the November floods. With the solidarity 
of the entire nation and the support of the state, they quietly 
made their repairs. Here, nature's catastrophe has served as an 
incentive to work rather than as an excuse for failing to meet 
production plans or defense tasks. 
  We are gathered here to promote 33 outstanding militiamen 
and 
reservists from this province who represent the 33 years that 
separate us from the heroic Bay of Pigs and who represent all 
those throughout the nation who are today receiving this well 
deserved reward. 
  We are also gathered here to hand over replicas of Maximo 
Gomez's glorious machete -- as in previous years -- to a group 
of writers, journalists, artists, and cultural institutions on 
behalf of the Revolutionary Armed Forces [FAR] in recognition of 
their significant contributions to strengthening the nation's 
combat capabilities and our people's patriotic and 
internationalist awareness. 
  It is a great satisfaction, in keeping with the Council of 
State decree, to reward the heroic fighters and civilian workers 
of the border guard brigade who, in fulfilling their duties, 
many times have risked their lives or been mutilated in the mine 
fields bordering the territory illegally occupied by the United 
States. On those who have fallen while carrying out this 
dangerous mission -- First Lieutenant Arturo Ruiz Martinez and 
soldiers Raul Milanes Labrada, Roberto Navarro Hernandez, and 
Wilbert Vasquez Gamboa -- today we posthumously confer the 
Antonio Maceo order. 
  They offered up their budding lives, these brave youths, 
worthy followers of soldiers Ramon Lopez Pena and Luis Ramirez 
Lopez, who decades ago lost their lives to treacherous bullets 
fired from the other side of the fence. The sacrifice of those 
who have been wounded or forever mutilated; the hard test of 
thousands of soldiers and officers who, throughout the 30 years 
of the existence of the border guard unit, have repeatedly 
guarded the fatherland, risking danger and suffering the 
pressures of the front line -- all this is part of the high 
price we are forced to pay by the existence of that foreign 
military base on a portion of our soil. 
  We have said and reiterated, from the very triumph of the 
Revolution, that this base was imposed on the Cuban people by 
force, and we demand that it be dismantled and returned to Cuba. 
Its presence, in disregard of our people's manifest will and the 
requests of their legitimate government, violates every norm of 
international law. It is a brutal act of arrogance by the empire. 
  Today, from a military point of view, this base is obsolete 
and constitutes an unnecessary expense that must be borne by the 
U.S. taxpayer. 
  To reduce its uncontrollable military budget, the United 
States has closed dozens of military bases in the United States 
and abroad. Nevertheless, it maintains this one as a source of 
constant provocation against and for the humiliation of Cuba. 
  We will never relinquish our sovereign right to that part of 
our island, of our national territory. 
  We reiterate today what we said a little over a year ago in 
this same square: There is not one day on which we are not 
reminded that we have a dagger in our country's side, just a few 
kilometers south of where we are now standing. We have never 
lost the hope of someday removing this dagger in a peaceful and 
civilized manner in accordance with the principles of 
international law. 
  As everyone knows, our state's social system, as well as our 
military doctrine, dictates that we will never become the 
aggressor who fires the first shot. 
  Everything we do to strengthen our defense is precisely 
directed toward making any aggression against Cuba so costly as 
to make it a deterrent by making war prohibitively expensive and 
illogical and, at the same time, toward securing our people's 
peaceful and creative endeavors. For Cuba, avoiding war is 
equivalent to achieving victory. 
  As long as we fail to achieve the legitimate and unwavering 
aspiration of recovering the territory now occupied by this 
base, our position is to avoid incidents along the line of 
demarcation between this area and the rest of the island. 
  As we stated several weeks ago, last year and this: A 
climate 
of tranquillity has prevailed on both sides of the fence, and 
our goal is to continue doing everything we can to maintain this 
atmosphere. 
  This is the reason we have taken and will continue to take 
every measure required to prevent any foolish endeavor on the 
part of those who try to leave Cuba by this route. 
  To try to cross the densely mined field on both sides of the 
fence, attempting to evade our checkpoints and patrols, is 
madness and, at the same time, an act of provocation against 
Cuba's security. 
  Two armies are deployed face to face on either side of the 
fence. Given the United States' permanent hostility toward our 
nation and its illegal occupation of this part of Cuba, these 
two armies are not precisely friendly armies. 
  It is evident that such illegal departure attempts, the 
crossing of the demarcation line, could result in incidents of 
war of unpredictable consequences. 
  If it were the will of the U.S. Government, it would prevent 
those attempts, once and for all, by declaring that the illegal 
entry of Cubans wishing to emigrate to the United States will 
not be tolerated. It could also prevent the tragic deaths of 
those who drown in the Florida Straits in their attempts to 
reach U.S. shores on frail rafts or vessels by not welcoming as 
heroes the so- called raft people [balseros] or automatically 
giving them the residence status not extended to any other 
foreigner in the United States. However, we know U.S. 
immigration policy with regard to the Cuban people is to deny 
the majority of the visa requests presented to the U.S. 
Interests Section in Havana, in order to encourage those illegal 
and dangerous departures and thereby deliberately boost the 
smear campaign against Cuba. This policy is very contradictory 
when contrasted to that for Haitians in Caribbean waters, or 
Mexicans, or Central Americans at the Mexican border. It is so 
cynical as to be indefensible. Sooner or later, it will have to 
be changed. 
  We are opening our doors wider every day so that anyone who 
wants to try his luck in a capitalist regime can do so through 
normal and legal means. We have always believed, and the 
commander in chief has said many times in the last 30 years, 
that socialism is a social system that can be built only through 
voluntary efforts, with awareness. 
  Ours is, precisely, a system radically different and 
opposed to capitalism. Our creed is to eliminate the 
exploitation of men by men and to give men true liberty and 
human status. Therefore, for those who dislike socialism and 
prefer capitalism -- in the belief that in that system, where 
men prey on men, they can gnash their way up and fulfill their 
personal ambitions -- we are not blocking the departure of 
selfish persons, who think in that way, to any capitalist 
country of their choosing. 
  I have said that we will do everything in our power to 
maintain a situation of normalcy and calm at the line of 
demarcation. We will therefore prevent, by every possible means, 
attempts to leave Cuba through that dangerous military area. 
  In order to make this policy viable, the courts have begun 
strict implementation of our laws against those arrested for 
trying illegally to reach the naval base and who are therefore 
committing an extremely grave crime by endangering national 
security. 
  It is fitting to remember the nonpenal treatment issued by 
the authorities in most of these cases where the persons had no 
previous record, and the generous release that made it possible 
for some of them to try again. 
  We warn those who may try to emigrate by this means not to 
run the fatal mistake of choosing to do so. This carries not 
only the risk of a court trial, but also the more ominous risk 
of death or mutilation from a mine exploding on either side of 
the demarcation line. 
  With the same passion that with we request the return of 
that 
part of our territory occupied by the naval base, we are aware 
that the officers, noncommissioned officers, and soldiers who 
guard the border in rotation are not directly responsible for 
this usurpation of our sovereignty. We are not moved by any 
feelings of personal hate against those soldiers who have been 
sent by their government to fulfill such a disgraceful mission. 
Even less could we harbor any animosity against their families, 
spouses and children, who are part of the American population 
living on base. 
  If the United States were to unleash a war against Cuba, no 
matter under what pretext, we would wage a no-holds-barred fight 
against the enemy in whatever corner of Cuba they may be. The 
Guantanamo Naval Base would, of course, be no exception. In this 
territory, we have, as we said here last year, everything needed 
to neutralize this enemy enclave. [applause] 
  In this case, as long as the aggression does not originate 
in 
this region of Guantanamo and the lapsed time is not used to 
reinforce the naval base, we are willing to allow the necessary 
time to evacuate civilians -- the spouses and children of the 
personnel stationed there -- from the base. 
  The Mambi army and their worthy heirs, the rebel army, have 
never tainted their weapons by attacking women, children, the 
defenseless elderly. The FAR will not do this either, for it 
cherishes the military honor and humane traditions of its 
predecessors. 
  Our historic legacy is to fight fiercely for the 
independence 
of the fatherland, under highly disadvantageous conditions, 
against the enemy; to take their weapons; to respect prisoners 
of war; and to help injured prisoners. 
  As Marti said of Mariana Grajales: Was she not steadfast 
during the entire war, surrounded by her children? Did she not 
encourage her compatriots to fight? And later treat the injured, 
Cuban or Spanish? 
  This is how Cuban revolutionaries from every period act. 
  We are proud that never, in Cuba, has a prisoner been 
tortured or mistreated; nor is there a single missing person, 
thousands of whom are still being sought by Latin American women 
and grandmothers. 
  Comrades, our people feel gratitude and admiration toward 
their brave sons, the members of the border guard unit. The FAR 
are proud of the valor, dedication, and discipline of this unit 
deployed on the front line. 
  By presenting the Antonio Maceo order today to Brigadier 
General Jose Solar Hernandez, who for over a decade led this 
region with exemplary dedication and efficiency, we render 
homage to his personal performance and work, the high level of 
readiness, and the high morale attained by the force of which 
the border guard is part. 
  This order is also granted to Major Jose Alvarez Beliz, 
chief 
of the engineer battalion, who on more that 20 occasions has 
entered the mine fields and whose most recent act of courage was 
the rescue of [soldier Elmis] Brooks [Chivas], where he was also 
injured. 
  Luckily, his injuries were not serious, and he was able to 
retrieve his injured comrade from the mine field. 
  By bestowing this order on Lieutenant Elmis Brooks Chivas, 
we 
are acknowledging not only his personal courage, demonstrated in 
many highly dangerous acts, but also the deep human sensitivity 
that moved him to risk his life, a plethora of virtues, to 
rescue the vacuous lives of a group of dumbbells, as generously 
described by comrade Elmis. With this award we are also exalting 
his decision to rejoin his beloved unit and the risky job of 
combat engineer. Young men like Brooks, who come from the most 
humble sectors of our people and are forged by the Revolution, 
strengthen our belief that the next generation is ready. 
[applause] 
  In addition to the Antonio Maceo order to which I have 
referred, the Calixto Garcia medal for valor is presented to 13 
other comrades: several officers, noncommissioned officers, 
soldiers, and one FAR civilian worker. Most of them have been 
mutilated or injured. All of them have on numerous occasions 
performed heroic acts. Two-thirds of them are still in active 
military service in this brigade or other units. 
  To all the comrades awarded today: We reiterate our 
gratitude 
and most heartfelt congratulations on behalf of the FAR and 
relay to you a warm embrace and salute from the commander in 
chief. [applause] 
  To those who gave their lives for the fatherland and 
nurtured 
with their noble blood the undefeatable land defended by the 
Guantanamo forces, we dip our combat flags and swear before 
Mariana that we will be ever deserving followers of her example; 
and before her we shout, louder than ever: Viva Free Cuba! 
[Crowd: Viva!] [applause]

  [Text] In the 35 years that have elapsed since the triumph 
of the Cuban revolution, the perimeter of the U.S. Naval Base on 
the Cuban bay of Guantanamo has been as a high tension cordon of 
fire. On numerous occasions, the U.S. troops deployed inside the 
base have staged serious acts of provocations aimed at creating 
a conflict that could justify a large-scale military attack 
against Cuba. On some of those incidents, U.S. soldiers, in an 
evident state of drunkenness or perhaps under the influence of 
hallucinogenic drugs, have hurled objects at Cuban soldiers 
deployed along that dangerous border, uttered vulgar insults, or 
staged pornographic scenes with prostitutes from the base 
brothels. 
  On other occasions, during times of crisis, they have fired 
at the Cuban side, once killing two young border soldiers, whom 
General Raul Castro remembered in his speech on 16 April. More 
recently, other incidents have been reported, with people trying 
to leave the country by crossing the mine fields located along 
both sides of the dividing line or by swimming across Guantanamo 
Bay in shark-infested waters mined by both sides. 
  During those incidents, some of those escaping have 
perished, 
giving the opportunity to news media which are enemies of Cuba 
to weave dark yarns that sparked irresponsible protests from the 
U.S. State Department, something which Cuba rejected, as it 
convincingly denied those false accusations. 
  In his 16 April speech, Raul Castro admitted that since 
President Bill Clinton has been in office there have not been 
the serious provocations that took place during the years of 
greatest tension. He affirmed that should there be at any time a 
military clash with the United States which did not begin at the 
Guantanamo base, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Cuba would 
expedite evacuation of the families of the soldiers of that 
enclave. 
  He also assured that Cuba will do everything within its 
power 
to preserve the climate of calm on both sides of the dividing 
line, which has prevailed in recent years. Raul Castro warned 
the Cuban security corps will try at all cost to keep citizens 
who want to migrate to the United States from using that venue. 
  The U.S. Government has been asked to take measures to 
discourage these actions. If the U.S. Government is truly 
interested in maintaining peace at Guantanamo Naval Base, which 
it is occupying against the Cuban people's will, it has the 
power to do so. Despite having suffered painful casualties due 
to the acts of provocation along the border, Cuban troops have 
never given any cause for concern to U.S. authorities or 
dishonored their discipline, which under such circumstances 
requires an extremely courageous and calm conduct. The 
responsibility to guarantee peace around the Guantanamo base 
falls, therefore, on the U.S. side, until that base is returned 
to the sovereign authority of the Republic of Cuba.

  [Text] On 18 April, Candido Palmero, member of the 
Politburo and first secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba in 
Havana, said that the province will harvest 2 million quintals 
of potatoes. During a farewell ceremony for the Giron de 
Victoria unit, Palmero praised the organization, discipline, and 
productivity of the unit which, in only 45 days of work, 
harvested approximately 700,000 quintals of potatoes and over 
34,000 quintals of miscellaneous crops. The unit has some 2,000 
military and civilian members. The Giron de Victoria unit 
planted approximately 30 caballerias of tubers and vegetables in 
addition to tending another 32 caballerias. 
  The Giron de Victoria unit also conducted outstanding social 
work in schools and small towns in the municipalities of Guines, 
Batabano, Melena del Sur, Guira de Melena, San Antonio de los 
Banos, Alquizar, and Quivican. At the farewell ceremony, several 
workers received the production and defense combatant medal and 
the status of outstanding in defense.

  [Text] The National Council of Science and Technology of 
Mexico and the State Committee for Economic Cooperation [CECE] 
of Cuba signed an agreement today in Havana which includes 20 
cooperation projects in the scientific-technical spheres. The 
projects cover the agricultural-livestock, industrial, fishing, 
and food sectors and were signed by Dr. Fausto Alzati Araiza 
chief representative of the National Council of Science and 
Technology in Mexico, and by Ernesto Melendez, minister 
president of the CECE. 
  [Begin Alzati recording] We are seeking to establish 
specific 
research and development projects that are as close as possible 
to application. In other words, we are talking not about basic 
research but about projects that could soon materialize into 
economic benefits. [end recording] 
  Both sides said that this agreement is an initial phase that 
opens the door for scientific-technical cooperation between the 
two countries.

  [Excerpts] A number of partisans from three people's 
organizations began a sit-in on 18 April in front of the U.S. 
Embassy in the Biscentenaire area. According to the authors of 
this action, the sit-in will continue until the embargo is 
lifted. The demonstrators, who intend to continue to the end, 
assert that they will be received on 19 April by Ambassador 
William Lacy Swing. They intend to obtain from the Clinton 
administration, through the U.S. diplomat, an end to the 
sanctions against Haiti. Jean-Max Blanc filed a report: 
  [Begin Blanc recording, in Creole] The Convergence of Mass 
Organizations, COM; the Haitian People's Alliance [Alliance 
Populaire Haitienne], APH; and the Haitian Front for Democratic 
and Nationalist Organizations [Front Haitien des Organisations 
Democratiques et Nationalistes], FODNH, began a demonstration on 
18 April in front of the U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince to 
protest the embargo on the country. 
  Samuel Mirtil, APH leader; Roosevelt Frage, FODNH president; 
and Mondestin, Jr. for COM assert that their movement will 
continue until a solution is found to the embargo. According to 
them, this problem is ruining the Haitian people and Haiti. They 
assert that they are to meet with U.S. Ambassador William Lacy 
Swing regarding this issue. [passage omitted] 
  Embassy officials have not reacted to the demonstration, 
which the demonstration's leaders say is to avoid an explosion 
in the country. These same leaders have criticized those among 
the population who are taking advantage of the sanctions to get 
rich or richer. [passage omitted] 
  This is the first time Haitian citizens held a sit-in in 
front of the U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince to protest the 
embargo since the crisis began in Haiti when the sanctions were 
imposed. [end recording]

  [Text] On 18 April, within the scope of the parliamentary 
plan that has already received the support of the United States 
and the United Nations, Frantz Robert Monde, president of the 
Chamber of Deputies, began his consultations with employers in 
order to resolve the crisis. Both Monde and Max Villard, vice 
president of the Haitian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, 
deemed those talks very positive. 
  According to the president of the chamber, the two officials 
tackled the core of the problem: the executive vacuum and how to 
fill it. Villard renewed the employers' support for the 
parliamentary plan for the resolution of the crisis. This plan, 
which provides for the installation of a new prime minister 
after the retirement of General Raoul Cedras, but does not set a 
date for the return of Jean-Bertrand Aristide, has been rejected 
by the president-in-exile. 
  On 13 April, Monde criticized President Aristide for his 
stubborn refusal to appoint a new prime minister and announced 
that he wanted to initiate consultations on fill the executive 
vacuum. Deputy Monde labeled this meeting as fruitful, but 
refused to reveal the points discussed.

  [Excerpts] Within a week, the fares for public 
transportation between Port-au-Prince and the outlying 
neighborhoods have gone sky-high. This increase in the cost of 
transport is the direct consequence of the increasing price of 
fuel. Jean-Max Blanc filed a report: 
  [Begin Blanc recording, in Creole] In the last week, the 
cost 
of public transportation has increased in the Haitian capital. A 
gallon of gasoline, which was $20 last week, cost $26 on 18 
April on Boulevard La Saline. The retailers are asking $28 for 
this same gallon of gasoline. A gallon of gas oil costs slightly 
less, $24 in La Saline. Public drivers report that they pay $26 
to $27 for it. 
  Therefore, two gourdes was suddenly added to the regular 
taxi 
fare. There are two kinds of drivers assuring transportation 
between Bourdon and Petionville, Petionville and Delmas, 
Port-au-Prince Cite Soleil and Port-au-Prince-Airport; 
Port-au-Prince and Carrefour. To go from Port-au-Prince to 
Carrefour is seven gourdes; the same with Petionville to Delmas; 
and Petionville to Christ-Roi. 
  The first category of drivers are those who do not demand 
seven gourdes from the passengers. According to them, the price 
still remains at five gourdes. The second category demands seven 
gourdes from the passengers. Those drivers explain that the high 
cost of gasoline causes them to increase the fares. [passage 
omitted] 
  For the other routes, such as for the buses to the airport, 
the cost is five gourdes instead of the 3.5 gourdes it was last 
week. The small buses going from Delmas to downtown cost the 
same as those going to Cite Soleil or other neighborhoods. 
However, the sector that seems to be most affected by the 
increase in the cost of public transportation is the students. 
Not only are buses scarce, but the fares are too high, according 
to a student who worries for the future of students in Haiti. 
[passage omitted] 
  Within a few months, the fare for public transportation has 
tripled. It is not impossible that in two months a parent will 
have to give 30 gourdes [$6] to his child for public 
transportation. 
  Meanwhile, factory workers are also facing misfortune. The 
fare they pay for transport is almost equal to the money they 
earn in a day. [end recording]

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Mexican economic developments monitored through 19 
April. 
  In the past three years, revenues earned by the 
privatization 
of nonstrategic public organizations totaled $21.8 billion 
pesos, the equivalent of 8.88 percent of international reserves. 
Foreign investment for the past four years totaled 77.7 percent 
of the international resources the country obtained. (Mexico 
City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 12 Apr 94 p 3A) 
  The Chiapas government spent approximately 30 million pesos 
in the first quarter of 1994 to buy 10,000 hectares of arable 
land from ranchers and small landholders in an attempt to 
alleviate the conflicts prompted by the excessive demand for 
land. (Mexico City LA JORNADA in Spanish 12 Apr 94 p 3) 
  The flow of foreign investment in Mexico in March was 50 
percent less than the investment levels obtained in January and 
February, months during which investment totaled approximately 
$1 billion. According to officials of the Commerce and 
Industrial Development Secretariat, this decline resulted from 
recent political events. (Mexico City UNOMASUNO in Spanish 13 
Apr 94 p 17) 
  Mexico signed two credit agreements with the international 
financial community on 11 April. The first agreement, totaling 
$30 million, was signed with the Spanish Government; the second 
one, for $169 million, was signed with the Inter-American 
Development Bank. The loans will be assigned to infrastructure 
and education projects. (Mexico City UNOMASUNO in Spanish 13 Apr 
94 p 18) 
  According to Alberto Marin, Northern Chiapas Cattle Union 
president, the livestock sector has suffered a loss of 
approximately 300 million pesos, particularly in such areas as 
the highlands, the jungle, and the north, as a result of 
multiple peasant invasions. Marin has said the government's 
buying of lands has prompted the invasions to continue. (Mexico 
City UNOMASUNO in Spanish 13 Apr 94 p 9) 
  The Foreign Trade Secretariat has revealed that $5 billion 
were reportedly invested in Mexico during the first quarter of 
1994. This amount is a 150-percent increase over foreign 
investment earned during the same period in 1993. (Mexico City 
NOTIMEX in Spanish 1453 GMT 13 Apr 94) 
  The National Bank of Mexico-Accival Financial Group has said 
in order to achieve the expected level of economic growth and 
employ the available labor force, Mexico will need at least $25 
billion in foreign aid in 1994 due to an insufficient rate of 
savings, which ranks below 10 percent. The bank's experts have 
said in the past two years more than 70 percent of foreign 
investment was in stocks. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 
14 Apr 94 p 7) 
  Mexican and Taiwanese businessmen have earmarked $7.5 
million 
to start a pioneering industrial project in Fresnillo, 
Zacatecas, where shoes will be made for export to the United 
States and Canada. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 2043 GMT 15 
Apr 94) 
  The National Foreign Trade Bank has placed on the 
international markets the lowest-priced issue of bonds in the 
past 12 years for the amount of $250 million. Foreign 
investors' purchase of these bonds will inject security and 
stability into the Mexican economy. (Mexico City UNOMASUNO in 
Spanish 15 Apr 94 p 16) 
  Mexico and New Zealand have signed an agreement to 
strengthen 
ties in trade and investment and to grant the agricultural 
sector easier access to both countries' markets. (Mexico City 
EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 15 Apr 94 p 21) 
  An EL FINANCIERO study indicates interest payments on the 
foreign debt in the private sector will increase by $100 million 
in addition to the estimated $2.1-billion debt pending for 1994. 
This increase results from a rise in international interest 
rates and an 8.5-percent devaluation of the peso vis-a-vis the 
U.S. dollar in recent weeks. Data provided by the Bank of 
Mexico, the Mexican Stock Market, and local and foreign experts 
show the leading Mexican companies, total of 36, incurred 
substantial foreign debts. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in 
Spanish 15 Apr 94 pp 1, 4, 5) 
  The Finance Secretariat has said Mexican exports during 
February reached $4.4 billion, a 17.4-percent increase compared 
with February 1993. According to a Finance Secretariat 
communique, nonpetroleum exports increased by 23.7 percent. 
(Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 1516 GMT 16 Apr 94) 
  High-ranking government officials have confirmed that thus 
far, $980.7 million from the Contingency Fund have been 
allocated to support the Mexican peso in the exchange market. 
The Finance Secretariat has said the $6 billion granted by the 
United States to counter any pressure to devalue the peso are 
still available. (Mexico City UNOMASUNO in Spanish 18 Apr 94 p 
16) 
  According to the Bank of Mexico, its foreign indebtedness 
increased by 115 percent from 1989 to this date and currently 
totals approximately $21 billion. In addition, banks' foreign 
indebtedness represents 51.2 percent of the total debt 
contracted by the public sector abroad and equals 17.6 percent 
of Mexico's total foreign indebtedness. (Mexico City LA JORNADA 
in Spanish 18 Apr pp 64, 54) 
  Mexican Petroleum has earned $482 million in revenues for 
Mexico by selling an average of 1.3 million barrels of crude per 
day to its clients in America, Europe, and Asia. The United 
States, 72.3 percent, Spain, 14.1 percent, and Asia, 14.4 
percent, were Mexico's leading clients during January. (Mexico 
City NOTIMEX in Spanish 0119 GMT 19 Apr 94)

  [Text] San Jose, 19 Apr (DPA) -- Costa Rica will insist the 
U.S. Government accept the extradition of John Hull, a fugitive 
from local justice. Hull was charged with involvement in 
"hostile actions," allegedly drug trafficking, and a bloody 
attack in which several journalists were killed in 1984. 
  President Rafael Angel Calderon made these statements after 
learning of a news report from Managua stating the U.S. citizen 
has been in Nicaragua for two months. 
  The U.S. citizen is also facing charges of alleged homicide 
[homicidio calificado] and attempted homicide. 
  According to Costa Rican political sectors, Hull, who owns a 
farm in northern Costa Rica, near Nicaragua, was reportedly 
involved in the La Penca attack 10 years ago, in which several 
journalists and guerrillas of the anti-Sandinist group, then led 
by Eden Pastora, were killed. 
  Hull has denied the charges, saying he is a victim of 
"communists." 
  Hull fled Costa Rica five years ago after police arrested 
him.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Costa Rican economic developments monitored through 
19 April. 
  According to figures of the Central Bank and the General 
Directorate of Statistics and Census, the country registered a 
$173.5 million trade deficit in the first three months of 1994. 
Although this was nearly $100 million less than in the same 
period in 1993 when the trade deficit reached $273.1 million, 
some economists view this as a bad sign because of the need to 
finance the growing rate of imports. Nevertheless, Central Bank 
President Jorge Corrals said net international reserves amounted 
to $435.7 million on 24 March 1994, adding that they are enough 
to finance five months of imports. (San Jose LA NACION in 
Spanish 5 Apr 94 p 29A) 
  The Foreign Trade Ministry reported on 18 April that banana 
exports dropped 13 percent in the first quarter of 1994, 
although they continue to be the country's second source of 
foreign exchange after tourism. The country sold $109 million 
worth of bananas, while $162 million was earned from tourism. 
Tourism revenue increased 29 percent compared to the same 
period in 1993. Total exports increased to $684 million in the 
first quarter. (Panama City ACAN in Spanish 2325 GMT 18 Apr 94)

  [Text] The U.S. Government announced last week that 
Salvadorans were excluded from the list of preferences to obtain 
U.S. resident visas. The Foreign Ministry has explained what 
this measure means: 
  [Begin Deputy Foreign Minister Rafael Alfaro recording] El 
Salvador was not excluded due to a lack of preference or as a 
political measure against the country. This was a measure to 
provide an opportunity to countries that have a lower number of 
immigrants in the United States. [end recording] 
  This decision does not in any way affect the treatment 
Salvadorans receive in the United States. 
  [Begin Alfaro recording] This does not mean any delay, 
because there is the [word indistinct] program, which grants 
Salvadorans the possibility of working while it is in effect. 
It was previously known as the [word indistinct]. In this 
case, I think this is directed more toward citizens of countries 
of Eastern Europe, Africa, or other continents. [end recording] 
  The deputy foreign minister also announced the creation of a 
tourist card for U.S. citizens who want to visit the country. 
  [Begin Alfaro recording] This will benefit the country not 
only concerning immigration, but it will also help tourism. 
This will enable anyone to buy a tourist card with dollars. 
[end recording] 
  The card might cost $10 and will be sold at travel agencies 
and U.S. airports. It is hoped it will become effective before 
the end of President Cristiani's term.

<F P=106> [Commentary by UCA (Central American University): "The </F>
Fiasco of the Century"] 
  [Text] The 20 March elections, which naive optimists 
considered of such great importance that they called them the 
elections of the century, turned into a great fiasco. The number 
and gravity of the election irregularities make it difficult to 
speak of free and clean elections. The dignity of the Salvadoran 
people has once again been disregarded by the officials in 
charge of the process. 
  While the political parties, the magistrates of the Supreme 
Electoral Tribunal, and President Cristiani himself insistently 
yet pleasantly urged the people to vote in these elections, many 
citizens lost patience after having to wait for over two hours 
to enter their polling place. A still unknown number, despite 
having a voter registration card, were unable to vote either 
because they were not listed in the registry or because the 
information on their registration card did not agree with the 
registry data, or even worse, because someone else had voted in 
their place earlier. In large cities, where there were few 
voting centers and they were organized alphabetically, forcing 
people to travel for considerable distances, the citizens' 
efforts to vote were impeded by lack of transportation; a 
similar situation prevailed in rural areas for the same reason. 
Polling places opened late because of the inefficiency and 
disorganization of the boards of election officials that were to 
receive votes; at 1700, people still waiting in line to vote 
were turned away from some polling places, disregarding the 
instructions that had been given. Throughout the course of the 
day, the election boards demonstrated a lack of preparation and 
experience in controlling voting procedures, and the vote 
counting and preparation of the official election returns were 
slow and complicated. After 2200, the Supreme Electoral 
Tribunal, despite having preliminary results from almost the 
entire country in its possession, began to read these return 
documents in a very unprofessional manner, amidst accusations 
from the opposition about impeding the presence of its 
representatives in the vote computation center. 
  In the end, the blind were able to vote, but it is clear 
that 
all this expensive and inefficient election machinery is 
designed for a citizenry whose literacy level by far outstrips 
El Salvador's. In fact, with an officially acknowledged 
illiteracy rate of 45 percent, not including functional 
illiterates, it is practically impossible for an average 
Salvadoran to find his name in the registry and identify the 
right table, or one who can clearly identify the destination of 
each part of the ballot and his party choice, as well as sign 
the electoral registry. 
  In a word, the Supreme Electoral Tribunal prevented a good 
number of citizens from voting. But in the end, it was the 
political parties themselves that were responsible for this 
fiasco, as this tribunal is in their hands. So the Supreme 
Electoral Tribunal demonstrated the inefficiency and lack of 
responsibility of the political parties. It is a good thing that 
they conducted voting tests; what might have happened if the 
system had not been tested! 
  The first results revealed a high rate of abstentions: 47 
percent of the citizens did not vote. That was due in part to 
obstacles the citizens encountered when trying to vote; it was 
also partly due to the fact that 400,000 citizens were listed in 
the registry whose names should not have been there, and that 
150,000 did not remove their voter identification card, but it 
was also caused by the citizens' lack of interest, apathy, and 
lack of confidence in the electoral process. Many did not want 
to be deceived once again and decided to stay home. In 1989, 
Cristiani won with an abstention rate of a little over 50 
percent. This time the abstention rate might be a little lower, 
but in any case the massive voter turnout that the politicians 
had hoped for still did not materialize. It should not be hard 
to determine how many citizens were not allowed to vote, and how 
many did not want to vote. So the civic festival the politicians 
were expecting was tarnished by the low turnout of the invited 
guests. 
  The fiasco of the FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation 
Front] is also evident. It trusted that what were called the 
rules of the game were going to be respected, without paying 
proper attention to the context in which the electoral process 
was taking place. It is interesting to compare its optimistic 
statements on Sunday morning with its critical attacks issued 
that night, when it was faced with the harsh reality. In the 
morning it had allowed itself to be deluded by the number and 
appearance of the crowds who were going to the polls, 
disregarding the warnings that we in PROCESO and ECA had been 
making on the limited historic scope of these elections as well 
as on their restricted freedom and their dubious transparency. 
The FMLN had been forewarned, but the illusion of political 
power counted for more. What appeared impossible actually 
happened. That is how the hard lessons of history are learned, 
lessons that are never forgotten. 
  The preliminary election results indicate that the citizens 
did not give the party now in office the votes it needed to win 
the presidency in the first round or a comfortable majority in 
the legislative assembly. So the official party has been dealt 
an unpleasant surprise; the triumph it had expected slipped out 
of its hands. Its performance in office does not enjoy absolute 
support from the citizens, nor are its facile promises extremely 
credible. Cristiani was also hoping for a massive approval of 
his record in office, to the point of thinking that even the 
impunity which human rights violators have enjoyed during his 
presidency was going to be approved at the ballot boxes. 
  ARENA [Nationalist Republican Alliance] undoubtedly does 
have 
considerable support, but this support is not sufficient to win 
the presidency in the first round and obtain a majority of the 
deputies. ARENA's dominant position has now been abolished. This 
is good for EL Salvador since, despite its short time in office, 
this party's officials and members already consider themselves 
the lords and masters of the government. 
  The coalition of the left won an honorable second place, but 
not enough to challenge the ruling party on an equal footing. Of 
course, it has become the country's second political force, but 
it still has much to learn and improve if it is to maintain that 
second place and move toward the presidency. One clear 
consequence shown by the election results is the need to 
strengthen the coalition internally. Even as the opposition, it 
is essential that it be strong and coherent. 
  Christian Democracy continues to lose votes in relation to 
its performance in past elections, and now occupies a rather 
uncomfortable third place, as the IUDOP [University Public 
Opinion Institute of the Jose Simeon Canas Central American 
University] polls had already predicted. The polarization of the 
elections and its internal leadership crisis led to Christian 
Democracy's collapse. If this party wants to remain in the 
national political scene, it has to renew its leadership, as it 
is doing very poorly when its candidate for mayor of San 
Salvador wins a higher proportion of votes than its candidate 
for the presidency of the entire nation. 
  There seemed to be no surprises in the smaller parties, 
despite the religious pressures of some ministers who had urged 
their congregations to vote for one of them. Therefore, the 20 
March elections confirmed the objectivity and professionalism of 
the IUDOP polls. The politicians who so frequently challenged 
them during the campaign should now, in a spirit of ethics and 
honesty in relation to reality, publicly admit that these polls 
were on the right track. 
  The results of the elections should not be allowed to 
overshadow the existence of grave irregularities, many of them 
caused by the scandalous shortcomings of the Supreme Electoral 
Tribunal and of the state apparatus as a whole. Independently of 
whether or not the election results are favorable or unfavorable 
to a specific party, the electoral system needs to be totally 
revised and its failings corrected. It does a severe disservice 
to the democratization of the nation when it is simply said that 
the elections took place normally and the results are 
acceptable, for those statements tend to cover up the electoral 
system's antidemocratic defects. 
  The 20 March elections exposed with crystal clarity, for 
anyone willing to see the facts, just how far the 
democratization process in El Salvador is from its goal. What 
happened should be analyzed in relation to the situation of 
noncompliance with the peace accords. It is appropriate to 
demand a cleaner second round, but it is not very realistic to 
think that in two weeks the political parties are going to 
correct what they did not do in two years. So it will be hard 
for the second round to be any different from the first. Still, 
not everything is negative; at least there is now awareness of 
the electoral system's structural defects. 
  We sincerely hope that the illusion of power does not again 
blind the political parties, particularly those who only protest 
when the results are unfavorable to them. The 1994 elections 
could become a first step toward strengthening the 
democratization process if measures needed to begin to reform 
the electoral system are adopted.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on El Salvadoran economic developments monitored through 
19 April. 
  In 1993, the Inter-American Development Bank, IDB, approved 
$109 million in loans to El Salvador. According to an official 
spokesperson, this money was used for social projects and 
infrastructure plans coordinated by various government offices. 
(San Salvador Radio Cadena YSU in Spanish 1800 GMT 14 Apr 94) 
  The Central Bank has reported that in the first three months 
of 1994 Salvadoran families received $223.2 million from family 
members living abroad. According to the bank, the Salvadoran 
economy was kept afloat throughout the civil war years by money 
Salvadorans living abroad sent their family members. (Paris AFP 
in Spanish 1903 GMT 18 Apr 94) 
  The local press has reported that Japan has approved a $99 
million loan to El Salvador to rebuild bridges destroyed during 
the 12 years of civil war. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 2020

  [Text] Guatemalan President Ramiro de Leon Carpio has sent 
a letter to U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher to 
promote the visit of U.S. tourists to Guatemala, saying the 
recent acts of violence against two U.S. citizens were "isolated 
incidents." 
  Due to those acts of violence, the U.S. Government has 
issued 
a travel warning [previous two words in English] advising 
travelers not to visit Guatemala or to postpone their trips to 
that country, except for emergency purposes. 
  Consequently, the important flow of U.S. tourists has 
dropped 
considerably, and hotels, travel agencies, and other 
tourist-related services have reported losses and have demanded 
stronger actions by the police. 
  In his letter to Christopher, de Leon expressed regret over 
and condemned the events and ensured the courts will "act 
strongly against the culprits who have already been arrested."

  [Text] Workers of the Urban and Rural Development Ministry 
occupied ministry installations yesterday and held hostage the 
deputy minister, who is the current acting minister. The action 
followed the dismissal of 888 workers as ordered by Government 
Agreement 152-94, which reorganizes the portfolio, reducing it 
to three directorates. 
  Acting Minister Gustavo Cheng Becker advised the ministry's 
union leaders of the cutbacks yesterday morning. Union 
representatives rejected the order and initiated a protest by 
occupying the ministry buildings, taking hostage the acting 
minister and two Finance Ministry representatives. The two 
ministry officials left the building later that evening. 
  Mefi Rodriguez and Maritza Palencia, on behalf of the 
Finance 
Ministry, agreed the government would pay compensation and other 
such benefits provided by the law. 
  Acting Minister Cheng Becker explained President Ramiro de 
Leon Carpio reached the decision based on the Government Agenda 
he made public on 15 August. It was then when he decided on the 
urgent need for administrative reorganization. 
  Cheng said this government agency will now function as a 
Superior Directorate, a General Services and Internal 
Administration Directorate, and a Rural and Urban Development 
Directorate. The payroll will now have 22 people. 
  The restructuring led to the deletion of certain positions 
which, according to technical assessments, were not needed to 
carry out the work described by its law and regulations. The 
affected positions were listed in Government Agreement 152-94, 
he said.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 19 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- Guatemalan 
Defense Minister General Mario Rene Enriquez today denied 
reports two military bases had attempted to overthrow President 
Ramiro de Leon Carpio. 
  The military chief told NOTIMEX via telephone the country is 
calm, although he admitted there are sectors, which he did not 
identify, interested in destabilizing Guatemala, as part of a 
strategy to affect de Leon' government. 
  Various sources reported this afternoon a group of officers 
discontent with the country's political situation had tried to 
overthrow the former human rights ombudsman, who took power on 6 
June 1993. 
  De Leon, who replaced deposed President Jorge Serrano Elias, 
has faced over the past months a severe political and economic 
crisis, heightened by the violence which claimed the life of 
Constitutionality Court President Epaminondas Gonzalez. 
  Gonzalez, who declared as "unconstitutional" Serrano Elias's 
decision to assume extraordinary powers last 25 May, was gunned 
down on 1 April, dying the following day in a local hospital. 
  The defense minister termed as false rumors of an armed 
uprising within the military ranks, because "Guatemala is on its 
last leg toward peace." 
  "I have contacted some of the 22 military zones in Guatemala 
and have confirmed there is no attempted coup d'etat," he added. 
  "We have confidence and faith in the president, because he 
is 
doing things well, and, although his government is temporary, he 
will set down irreversible bases for lasting peace in this 
country," Enriquez added.

  [Text] Gabriel Larios Ochaita took office as 
Constitutionality Court (CC) president in a ceremony at the 
court's hearing room at 1900 last night. 
  The ceremony began with the singing of the national anthem 
followed by a minute of silence in memory of Epaminondas 
Gonzalez Dubon who was CC president until Good Friday [1 April), 
when he was assassinated. 
  In his speech, President Ramiro de Leon Carpio said his mind 
and heart were filled with two conflicting feelings regarding 
memories of Gonzalez: The first memory is his participation as 
president of the Commission of 30, which drafted the 
Constitution, and his role as alternate president of the 
National Constituent Assembly, which issued the current 
Constitution; and the second memory is his regrettable and 
painful death.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Guatemalan economic developments monitored through 19 
April. 
  The Guatemalan Government acknowledged today the difficulty 
in meeting its commitment with the IMF to increase taxes from 8 
to 10 percent, in relation to the gross domestic product (GDP). 
The finance minister admitted that in the first quarter tax 
revenues reached only 7.3 percent in relation to the GDP due to 
tax evasion. In addition, the finance minister reported the 
president had outlined a draft bill on tax reform, which could 
be approved shortly. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 0036 GMT 14 
April 94) 
  Tourism, the second largest grosser of foreign exchange, 
following coffee, will not reap $100 million this year due to 
the wave of violence unleashed in the country. Sources in the 
tourism sector have reported more than 45 percent of the trips 
by U.S. and European tourists have been canceled. The same 
source has said Guatemala cannot compete with Mexico and Costa 
Rica if they buttress their promotions with political stability 
while the state here persists in a permanent dispute and while 
there is no end to the war. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 1939 
GMT 14 April 94) 
  Guatemalan inflation reached 3.7 percent in the first 
quarter 
of 1994 after a rise in the consumer price index in January of 
2.14- percent, .95 percent in February, and .58 percent in 
March. The National Institute of Statistics has reported an 
increase in food and beverages prices of 3.53 percent; housing 
costs, 3.15 percent, health services, 3.9 percent; and home 
furnishings, 3.24 percent. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 0001

  [Text] Tegucigalpa, 19 Apr (DPA) -- General Luis Alonso 
Discua, commander-in-chief of the Honduran Armed Forces, 
confirmed today that the Armed Forces want to break the military 
assistance treaty with the United States because they consider 
it obsolete and, according to military leaders, it does not 
benefit the country. 
  Gen. Discua said the Armed Forces will attempt to submit the 
treaty for review by the Honduran Congress Defense Committee. 
  The United States signed a military assistance treaty with 
Honduras in 1954 and, according to Discua, it currently benefits 
the United States. 
  Discua referred specifically to the U.S. military base at 
Palmerola in the central department (province) of Comayagua, 
noting that it is important to examine whether it is appropriate 
to keep the base open in Honduras. 
  U.S. assistance to Honduras has been reduced drastically in 
the past year, and according to Discua, U.S. assistance is 
conditional upon various situations and even includes sanctions.

  [Excerpt] Tegucigalpa, 19 Mar [date as published] 
(ACAN-EFE) -- The Armed Forces are considering replacing the 
military agreement Honduras signed with the United States in 
1954. This would be the end of the long "honeymoon" that reached 
its peak during the war waged by the "contras" against the 
Sandinist regime in Nicaragua. 
  It was also reported in Tegucigalpa that Armed Forces Chief 
General Luis Alonso Discua said on a U.S. television network 
that the current agreement "includes certain rules that are out 
of date because the treaty was signed in 1954." 
  Official Honduran sources and the U.S. Embassy in this 
capital declined to make any statements to ACAN-EFE but promised 
to do so "in the next few hours." Meanwhile, the Presidency 
announced an upcoming meeting of the Security Council. 
  The Legislative Assembly already knows about the Armed 
Forces 
position. Vice President Rafael Pineda Ponce said today that it 
includes "professional, analytical, and thoughtful" proposals. 
  Honduran military personnel have initiated efforts to modify 
the Military Assistance Treaty because it is obsolete and 
currently benefits only Washington in allowing it to exert 
pressure on the Central American nation, local commentators said. 
  These sources did not rule out the possibility that the 
military will try to capitalize on the fact that the United 
States will leave the Panama Canal in the year 2000, thus making 
Honduras the sole military base in Central America. 
  Political and humanitarian group leaders, however, 
criticized 
the military initiative today, saying that Honduras's foreign 
policy should be set by civilian rather than military powers.

  [Text] Tegucigalpa, 19 Apr (DPA) -- Honduran Foreign 
Minister Ernesto Paz Aguilar today said that Palmerola, the U.S. 
base in central Honduras, makes no sense. The Honduran foreign 
minister also expressed his support for a review of the military 
treaty that Honduras and the United States signed in 1954. 
  Paz Aguilar said it is necessary to review this treaty, 
adding that in the specific case of the U.S. Palmerola Air Force 
Base, it makes no sense for it to be used as a military platform 
when it should be used as a center to fight drug trafficking. 
  "Central America and the Caribbean will continue to be areas 
of interest to the United States, and we must take as much 
advantage as we can of this fact," the foreign minister said. 
Paz Aguilar said many agree that conditions are appropriate for 
Honduras to begin a new relationship with the United States. The 
foreign minister added that U.S. aid to Honduras can be used to 
combat drug trafficking and the smuggling of illegal aliens. 
  Foreign Minister Paz Aguilar said Honduras, through its 
authorities, will ask the Honduran Congress to review the 
treaty. The Honduran Armed Forces today said Honduras should 
break the military treaty with the United States because the 
treaty is obsolete and yields no benefits to Honduras.

  [Text] President Carlos Roberto Reina has invited the 
National Security Council to a meeting to review the Military 
Assistance Treaty with the United States, Congress Vice 
President Jorge Arturo Reina reported today. He commented on 
today's news reporting the Honduran Armed Forces are seeking to 
denounce the Military Assistance Treaty signed in 1954 with the 
U.S. Government. 
  Treaties must be viewed in light of current circumstances to 
assess whether they favor the country's best interests, Reina 
explained. The congressman also said the idea that Palmerola be 
turned into a base against drug trafficking instead of a 
military base has been proposed, adding the U.S. has maintained 
the symbolic presence of troops, something which was only 
significant during the Cold War. 
  According to Reina, [words indistinct] totally the symbolic 
presence of the United States and would allow these 
installations to be used to fight drug trafficking in the 
country.

<F P=106> [Report by Lourdes Bonilla and Roberto Reyes at the </F>
Government House in Tegucigalpa -- live relay] 
  [Text] [Bonilla] Dr. Jorge Arturo Reina, who is the vice 
president of the Congress and brother of President Carlos 
Roberto Reina, has confirmed the report this station released a 
few minutes ago from the Government House. That report noted 
that within the next few hours the National Security Council 
will discuss the Honduran Armed Forces' plan to break the 
Military Assistance Treaty with the United States--a treaty that 
dates back to 1954. Reporter Roberto Reyes has more details on 
this. 
  [Reyes] Dr. Jorge Arturo Reina specifically noted that the 
legislative and executive branches today intend to review the 
Military Assistance Treaty between the United States and 
Honduras. Here is what he said when asked about this topic: 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter, in progress]...on 
what is a review of the Military Assistance Treaty with the 
United States? 
  [Reina] No, the meeting we attended did not deal with that 
issue. At this time, we are coming from a meeting the president 
held with the deputies from Francisco Morazan Department, but we 
did not touch on this topic. 
  [Reporter] Will there be a National Security Council meeting 
to review this topic? 
  [Reina] I think the president has proposed the advisability 
of a National Security Council meeting, but not only for that 
purpose, but also to address the problem of violence in an 
effort to get an overall view of this problem and a joint 
decision from all sectors of society [words indistinct]. 
  [Reporter] When will this meeting be held? 
  [Reina] I do not know. That will be announced by the 
president. 
  [Reporter] Do you agree with the [words indistinct] of the 
Armed Forces about the U.S.-Honduran military agreement? 
  [Second unidentified reporter] Will [words indistinct] to 
citizens of the country? 
  [Reina] Well, I have seen how the world has changed. A few 
years ago, we proposed the advisability of (?reviewing) 
treaties. At that time, that was a taboo subject. Now it is 
prudent for Honduras to review any and all treaties to determine 
whether they are providing benefits and whether they are 
consistent with the nation's sovereignty. Nevertheless, I do not 
think we should portray this as a serious problem, because 
conditions exist for reviewing every international relationship, 
and, if the countries agree, they can discuss such topics. 
  [Reporter] What about the situation that arose today in 
Congress because of the questioning of the ENEE [National 
Enterprise for Electric Power] manager? What is the goal of 
Congress in this? 
  [Reina] I think that in all of these cases--in both the 
invitation Congress extended to the ENEE, as well as to Cohdefor 
[Honduran Corporation for Forest Development]--there is no other 
goal but to have them explain to the Honduran people how 
difficult it is to resolve the country's extremely serious 
problems. 
  [Reporter] Now that you are in government, can you guarantee 
to the Honduran people that you are going to review the treaties 
and do what you always said you would do--things you said you 
would do even before you were a university leader and [words 
indistinct]? 
  [Reina] Well, we continue to maintain the same unwavering 
position. That has never changed. World conditions have changed, 
however. In terms of the U.S. Palmerola base, to which I assume 
you are referring, it has been proposed that it be turned into a 
base for combating drug trafficking instead of a military base 
in the old sense of the word--the kind of base that has 
traditionally existed in Latin American countries. 
  [Reporter] Congress has had a commission discussing this. At 
least Mr. Rafael Pineda Ponce spoke about this in a report we 
aired. 
  [Reina] That is correct. We think treaties must be reviewed 
in terms of today's climate and based on the [words indistinct] 
most advisable for Honduras' national interests. In this sense, 
I think that there will be unity among the Honduran people and 
that, in the end, the best thing will be done. 
  [Reporter] [words indistinct] the North Americans? 
  [Reina] I think that recently the North Americans have been 
maintaining a symbolic troop presence. However, I also think 
there is something more important. The presence of U.S. forces 
during the Cold War had a significance that was very different 
from what it now has that the Cold War no longer exists. In 
addition, the idea that has been proposed to turn Palmerola into 
a base from which to wage a war against international drug 
trafficking, which is a transnational crime, completely changes 
the nature of the symbolic U.S. presence and would give Honduras 
greater control of the installations, which would be used 
precisely to fight drug trafficking. 
  [Reporter] But these are foreign troops in the country, 
regardless of their objective. 
  [Reina] The presence of a large number would make no sense. 
Any assistance needed to operate equipment and needed to train 
Hondurans to operate equipment would be highly beneficial for 
Honduras and the region. 
  [Reporter] In short, would Congress be supporting the review 
of that military treaty with the United States? 
  [Reina] Well, the discussion of that topic has not been 
concluded. It has to be discussed more carefully, but you can be 
sure that the executive branch and the Congress are defending 
Honduras's national interests above anything else. 
  [Reporter] What is the (?position) of the executive branch 
in 
this case? What has the president told you in this regard? 
  [Reina] About what? 
  [Reporter] About [words indistinct]. 
  [Reina] We have not discussed this topic. We have only 
commented on how conditions have changed and on how it is now 
possible to discuss any topic without this being seen as an 
unfriendly act against another country. 
  [Reporter] [words indistinct] 
  [Reina] He will be the one [words indistinct]. [end 
recording] 
  [Reyes] This is what Congress Vice President Jorge Arturo 
Reina has said. He confirmed that the National Security Council 
will be meeting specifically to discuss this topic and that the 
executive and the legislative branches are willing to review the 
issue of U.S. military assistance to Honduras.

<F P=106> [From Herman Allan Padgett's "Radio Column" segment] </F>
  [Text] Since yesterday there have been commentaries on the 
news that the military sector of the executive branch plans to 
denounce the reciprocal military assistance agreement that our 
country signed with the United States several years ago. Two 
protocols were added to it, but as far as we know, the National 
Congress of Honduras never ratified them. 
  Before we say anything else, we must point out that this is 
not the Armed Forces' prerogative. The president of the Republic 
is the leader of our foreign policy; he should establish the 
country's policy, which should then be implemented by the 
foreign relations minister. The sovereign National Congress has 
the power to approve or reject international treaties and 
agreements. 
  We do not know if President Reina is interested in seeing 
the 
end of military aid to our country and the departure of U.S. 
troops and U.S. advisers and military observers in our Armed 
Forces and the police. 
  President Reina was interviewed on the presence of U.S. 
troops at Palmerola, but he did not give any direct answers. You 
might even say he purposefully evaded that question, which leads 
us to think that--at least at the time that he was asked the 
question--he had neither considered the issue nor established 
any criteria for it. 
  Hondurans grows less interested in military matters every 
day, so they would not miss U.S. military aid. One could 
predict, however, that the Washington administration would have 
a negative reaction toward other issues in which Honduras is 
certainly interested. 
  Although U.S. aid to Honduras, the rest of Latin America, 
and 
the world has decreased in the past few years, it is still 
significant in relative terms. We must say that all U.S. aid to 
our countries is given under very strict conditions. In our 
particular case, we would dare say that we have never felt more 
dependent or more colonized by the United States than in the 
past 15 days. 
  This peaceful colonization of Honduras by the United States 
has been felt more strongly since the collapse of the Berlin 
Wall and the unexpected fall of Soviet imperialism. There is 
virtually no aspect of national life for which the United States 
has not established guidelines for us; in fact, it even demands 
specific behavior from us. 
  Following the military assistance treaty that brought the 
Nicaraguan contras here and forced the Honduran Government to 
lease our territory--with all the ominous consequences that we 
are still suffering--the agents of Washington have infiltrated 
every institution in order to direct their policies, programs, 
and objectives. 
  The pretext has been to supervise the correct use of funds 
granted by Washington to those institutions and programs. Thus 
the report drafted by two aides of Senator Helms is untrue and 
humiliating. There has been an attempt to pass this report off 
as coming from the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The 
report reflects the U.S. complaint that Honduras denies justice 
to U.S. citizens, who are supposedly the subject of unlawful 
expropriations. 
  In the next few days we will talk a little more about the 
report drafted by two of Sen. Helms's employees, who came here 
and also visited Nicaragua, although they did not do any on-site 
investigations. They went back with data, gossip, and 
speculation that interested parties in Honduras reportedly 
provided them during their visit to our territory. 
  It was nothing serious or concrete, but it was indeed 
harmful 
and slanderous to Honduras' international image. Based on those 
alleged expropriations, none of which has been specifically 
brought before our country's judicial branch or based on legal 
grounds, the threat of cutting all aid to Honduras is being made 
again. In fact, authorities and citizens of Islas de la Bahia 
have already had their U.S. visas revoked as punishment for 
defending our country's island possessions from the illegal 
ambitions of U.S. citizens. 
  In short, if it were not for the military agreement, other 
kinds of aid would be used to subject Honduras and its 
government to the constant humiliation that constitutes an open 
assault on our national sovereignty. We cannot defend ourselves 
adequately because we are a small, poor, and weak country. 
  On top of this report drafted by Sen. Helms's staff, there 
are a number of complaints about alleged acts of corruption 
committed with the aid granted by Washington. If such acts of 
corruption have indeed been committed, this corruption would 
have necessarily involved the complicity of U.S. agents who are 
present in every government office and program to supervise 
expenditures and the management of the money. 
  By virtue of the operational funds granted by U.S. AID, AID 
personnel are in the judicial branch, the Public Health 
Ministry, the police, the Comptroller General's Office, and the 
Council of Private Enterprise, and it even has its hands in the 
labor movement under the pretext of conducting training. 
  We do not yet know the basic reasons behind the Honduran 
military's plan to reject the military agreement, given that 
U.S. officials have served as some sort of demigods to our men 
in uniform. They were constantly present and worshipped by all 
units at countless ceremonies and parties. 
  We do know, however, that Pentagon and CIA relations with 
Honduran servicemen have not fared well during the tenure of 
Ambassador Crescencio Arcos. Arcos had frequent and notorious 
confrontations with our military hierarchy. Arcos planted the 
seed here for a systematic campaign against the Honduran Armed 
Forces. 
  Crescencio Arcos coined the phrase--or, perhaps, he 
plagiarized--that in Honduras justice only bites those who are 
barefoot. His open meddling in Honduran domestic affairs clearly 
proved that the United States has assumed worldwide leadership 
and a hegemonical role to control not only the economies and 
armies but also the day-to-day life in our countries. 
  There is imperial Caesarism in Washington following the 
death 
of ideological bipolarism--a death that was rung in by the 
collapse of the Soviet Empire. Since then, clocks in Washington 
have been used to set time for everyone else in the world, and 
the peoples of the world, especially those in the Third World, 
remain helpless because they can do nothing but lower their 
heads in resignation or expose themselves to being beleaguered 
by extreme economic reprisals, diplomatic isolation, and blatant 
international ostracism. 
  We are poor because we are poor, and hunger--as our 
grandparents used to say--is a poor adviser.

  [Text] Managua, 16 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- The Nicaraguan 
Government and an IMF mission today signed a letter of intent 
and concluded the negotiation process of the second phase of the 
structural adjustment program. 
  Central Bank President Jose Evenor Taboada, who, together 
with Finance Minister Emilio Pereira, was one of the signers of 
the document, confirmed the signing of the document to NOTIMEX. 
According to Taboada, the next step is the internal approval 
procedure at the IMF Directorate in Washington. 
  With the signing of the letter of intent, which includes the 
terms of the economic program and a request for credit from the 
financial organization, the government concluded its difficult 
negotiations on the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility 
(ESAF) program, which is scheduled to be signed in June, Taboada 
confirmed. The IMF technical delegation, which had been in 
Nicaragua for one week, returned to Washington on Saturday, he 
added. 
  The Central Bank president predicted that the accord's 
ratification will not encounter problems within the IMF 
Directorate because it is backed by a prior agreement with the 
administration of the international organization. Taboada told 
NOTIMEX: Having reached an agreement with the administration -- 
of the IMF -- we do not believe there will be a problem in 
approving the adjustment program which guarantees $140 million 
in credits to Nicaragua over the next three years. The signing 
of the ESAF is linked to foreign aid, which will total $600 
million in 1994. This aid will come from the international 
banking community and donor countries on the condition that the 
adjustment measures continue to be implemented. 
  Criticism from political and labor sectors opposed to the 
conditions imposed by the ESAF was called manipulative by 
Taboada, who explained that the cost will be greater if the 
measures are not implemented. The official said he was 
confident that the implementation of the economic program would 
not prompt violence, strikes, or social protests that have led 
to economic losses in previous years. He said: I trust people 
"will not be swayed by the agitation of some sectors which, 
because of a lack of information or special interests," oppose 
this agreement. 
  The program includes a reduction of 13,000 government jobs 
over the next three years. It also calls for the privatization 
of the telephone company and water works, the liberalization of 
fuel distribution, and the reorganization of education and 
health budgets. 
  The government has announced the creation of 84,000 jobs, 
including both primary and secondary jobs, and it promised to 
give greater support to agriculture production in order to 
attain the official GDP growth target of 4 percent by the end of 
1994.

    [Editorial Report] Managua BARRICADA in Spanish of 5 April 
1994 on page 5 reports that Jose Espinoza Navas, leader of the 
Permanent Congress of Workers, and Lucio Jimenez, National 
Workers Front leader, expressed their reluctance to support the 
IMF agreement which provides for the Enhanced Structural 
Adjustment Facility. They stated: "We are not going to back with 
our signature something which will harm the already precarious 
situation of the workers." Espinoza said that union leaders were 
"extremely concerned" because the agreement threatens the jobs 
of 15,000 workers. Espinoza and Jimenez explained that the 
threat of huge layoffs will determine whether the union leaders 
participate further in talks with the High Level Commission 
studying the agreement.

<F P=106> [Interview with FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation Front] </F>
Deputy Sergio Ramirez by Noel Irias; place and date not given; 
first three paragraphs BARRICADA introduction] 
  [Text] Deputy Sergio Ramirez, member of the Sandinist Front 
National Directorate (DN), heads the long list of signatories of 
the document titled "For a Sandinism That Goes Back to the 
Majorities," a document which sums up the proposals of a large 
faction of that party. 
  However, the public admission of his wish to seek the 
Sandinist candidacy in the 1996 presidential elections has 
caused confusion over the nature of the document. 
  Ramirez says he does not want to appear to be binding the 
signers to back a candidacy, "but rather, a position," and 
insists that the FSLN must renew itself in order to win the 
coming elections. Otherwise it will have to wait until the year 
2002. 
  [Irias] What is the relationship between the special 
congress 
in May and the 1996 election process? 
  [Ramirez] The special congress in May is not specifically 
designed to open up election prospects for the FSLN. 
  However, the congress does become a political platform for 
the 1996 elections by virtue of the fact that the platform 
definitions that we make will necessarily be a reference point 
for society in terms of the election because they cannot be 
abruptly changed. 
  These platform definitions of democracy, the Armed Forces, 
the government, relations with the United States, violence, and 
methods of struggle will be a mirror in which society will view 
us as an election option. 
  The effects of the FSLN's democratization process will serve 
as a parameter indicating whether or not we have a party that 
has evolved. 
  It will show whether we have a party with procedures for 
open 
admission and greater proselytizing activity because, starting 
in May, we shall have to step up our proselytizing profile in 
organizational terms and strive to become a winning party. 
  This will all depend upon party structure and our political 
readiness to go into operation rapidly in an election situation. 
  [Irias] What would happen if the special congress were to 
decide that a renewal of this type is not necessary? 
  [Ramirez] I think we must fight such a tendency with great 
imagination, creativity, and determination. 
  A congress that merely marks time and that devotes itself to 
mulling over ideological concepts in order to prove that we are 
a party that is ideologically pure would not put us in a 
politically advantageous position. 
  I think the FSLN has to articulate a very clear message for 
society, what it wants and does not want, what it has to offer 
in terms of an alternative solution to the major economic 
problems facing us. 
  It must also state what the FSLN believes the role of the 
individual in society must be, its views on the safety of the 
individual, his property and beliefs, war and violence. All of 
which must be elucidated in political terms in order to make the 
Sandinist election goals viable. 
  I must think in preeminently political and therefore 
election 
terms if, indeed, we are to go into major elections because the 
FSLN's victory in 1996 is vital. 
  I would be enormously concerned if the Sandinist Front were 
defeated again in 1996 and forced to rebuild its election base 
in 2002, out of power for 12 years. 
  [Irias] You have expressed presidential aspirations. What 
conditions must exist for this to occur? 
  [Ramirez] I am proposing to the FSLN and Nicaraguan society 
a 
party that is transformed, renewed, and resting on truly 
democratic foundations, internally speaking. 
  The last thing I would ever do would be to propose a bossist 
take-it-or-leave-it option to Sandinists, stating that my 
person, my figure, is indispensable to the FSLN's election 
interests. 
  I have merely spoken of the legitimacy of my aspiration to 
hold an elective post rather than of the aspiration in itself. 
  I have tried to put back into the closet the old skeleton 
which says that aspiring to elective office in the FSLN is a 
cardinal sin. On the contrary, I believe that in a revolutionary 
party, individuals have the right to their own aspirations and I 
want to legitimize that fact. 
  I want a renewed FSLN. Then and only then shall we decide on 
presidential candidates. If the Sandinist Front does not become 
a force in terms of empowerment as a force capable of winning, 
then choosing preliminary candidates will serve no purpose 
whatsoever. 
  I decided to place my name on the document "For a Sandinism 
That Goes Back to the Majorities" in order to force yet another 
skeleton back into the closet: casting the stone while hiding 
one's hand. I was indeed a decisive factor in the formation of 
that faction and in the drafting of that faction's views. 
  I agreed to place my name on it out of loyalty to its 1,000 
signers, but I do not want to appear to be forcing the signers 
to back a candidacy, but rather, a position. I have not tried to 
gather signatures backing me personally. 
  When I decide to announce as a precandidate in the elections 
representing the FSLN, I will begin to speak with complete 
legitimacy, and the party will have a means to determine who the 
candidate will be, because there will certainly be several. 
  What I refuse to accept is for the leadership to decide on a 
single candidate who will then be imposed on the party's rank 
and file. 
  [Irias] Did the National Directorate decide that its members 
would not sign any document or participate in the activities of 
the factions? 
  [Ramirez] Opinions were expressed that it was not advisable 
for members of the National Directorate to head factions within 
the FSLN or sign documents, but none became an actual decision. 
  This happened after a number of members of the DN attended 
the founding meeting of the Beijing Guerrilla faction, who 
obviously did not sign the document. They did attend, however, 
and I consider them part of that core of founders and recognize 
their right to do so, just as I reserve the same right to 
discuss related positions with other comrades. 
  After the document "For a Sandinism That Goes Back to the 
Majorities" came out and the matter was discussed once again, we 
agreed that members of the DN should have freedom of opinion and 
the interplay of factions, while respecting the rules of a 
high-minded debate. 
  I do not think the DN could make a decision to prevent its 
members from participating in the factions because it is almost 
of a provisional nature. We will report when the congress elects 
a new leadership in May. 
  Within the DN itself, we should accept the possibility of 
the 
competence of candidates and how to resolve it in the most 
appropriate fashion. There could be several candidates for the 
post of secretary general of the FSLN. We would be speaking of 
immediate proselytizing action rather than action relating to an 
assumed presidential candidacy in the distant future. 
  No one has decided that there will be only one candidate for 
every post and we no longer have elections by lists. We must 
expect several candidates for every elective post; that is 
inevitable. 
  [Irias] What is your view of the election results in the 
Atlantic Coast area? 
  [Ramirez] I believe that what happened resulted from the 
Sandinists' inability to engage in election proselytizing. The 
FSLN is still unprepared to be a party that will win the 
majorities, as those elections show. 
  Our comrades on the Coast made an enormous effort, but the 
central party machinery did not lend them sufficient support. 
  We are not acting like a national party called upon to win 
in 
regional elections. The duty of a party is to win, not compete 
for second place! 
  [Irias] Should the FSLN form alliances for election 
purposes? 
  [Ramirez] As a general rule, I think the FSLN should be open 
to alliances--particularly in a civil struggle in which it is 
votes that define victory--while always bearing the national 
purpose in mind. 
  I do not think the Sandinists are the sole proprietors of 
the 
solutions to the country's crisis. I wish there were a union of 
forces in which the FSLN would play the central role and set the 
course for emerging from the country's crisis in 1996. 
  [Irias] Will you run for the National Directorate at the 
next 
congress? 
  [Ramirez] I have not yet decided. I would like to be a part 
of the leadership elected by the congress and I would not refuse 
an elective post. Nor am I blackmailing anyone, as has been 
written and stated on the radio, saying that if the congress 
does not do what I want, I will withdraw from it or even switch 
to another party. 
  I do not believe in political bossism consisting in having 
men be more important than things: the party, our institutions. 
Bosses are capable of sacrificing anything: the unity of a 
party, the coherence of a plan, the viability of a country, in 
order to reign personally. I am not like that. 
  However, I do reserve the option of not running for an 
elective post if the ratio that emerges from the congress 
indicates that there is no possibility of transformations like 
those I believe the FSLN needs in order to face the election 
challenge politically speaking. 
  Here we have yet another skeleton to put back into the 
closet: that it is a cardinal sin to run for elective office and 
a cardinal sin if you do not run because you are threatening our 
unity. 
  As a member of the FSLN, I shall always defend the fact that 
failing to appear on a list of candidates at any given moment 
should not alarm anyone or lead people to believe I am attacking 
unity. 
  [Irias] Does the National Directorate function as the real 
leadership of the party? 
  [Ramirez] The DN does not function as the real leadership of 
the party, as proved by the fact that if a special congress was 
indeed called ahead of the scheduled date of June 1995, it is 
because of recognition of a crisis of leadership in the party. 
  The feeling of collegial leadership has been lost and the 
Sandinist Assembly is not functioning as such. Most of the 
resolutions passed by the Sandinist Assembly exist only on paper 
and have not been carried out within the party. The departmental 
organs are also in crisis. 
  Not only is the FSLN engulfed in an identity crisis, but it 
is facing an organic crisis as well. It was because of it that 
we were unable to contribute effectively to an election victory 
in the Atlantic Coast region. 
  For all of these reasons, the FSLN's renewal as a party is 
essential.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Miguel D'Escoto Brockmann, dated 9 March] </F>
  [Text] It is both tragic and comic to read what Sergio 
Ramirez says in an interview published in EL PAIS and now 
circulating concerning the armed struggle in Nicaragua today. 
  Sergio threatens to withdraw from the Front if, among other 
unlikely happenings, the FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation 
Front] announces at its next special congress "that it is going 
to take up arms to overthrow the government." 
  I had always thought that I knew Sergio well and, in 
addition 
to having great affection for him, have always respected his 
ideas and proposals. Now I sincerely no longer know what is 
happening. I cannot understand him. I wish someone would 
convince me that I have misunderstood his proposals, that they 
are not as opportunistic or "vote-seeking" as they appear. 
  Shortly after Sergio said in the aforementioned interview 
that he would withdraw from the Front if the congress should 
announce that we are going to take up arms to defeat Violeta 
Chamorro, Helena Ramos, who was conducting the interview, 
correctly reminded him that no one here is proposing a guerrilla 
war, that the issue is the struggle in the streets, the strikes, 
and so on. That reminder from the reporter to the statesman is 
what is tragic-comic for me. 
  The journalist was very politely urging Sergio to come back 
to earth, to reality. Ramos asked Sergio to give his opinion 
about the civil struggle. I think that is the best part of the 
excellent interview and the six ensuing paragraphs deserve to be 
read very carefully so that we realize once and for all that the 
basic problem is ideological, even if Sergio continues to deny 
it. In addition to the ideological aspect, Sergio's comments 
also naturally contain a healthy dose of manipulation and 
demagogy. If they do not, let someone else give me a better 
label for Sergio's attempt to make people realize that there is 
a very real danger of a decision being made at the FSLN's 
special congress to take up arms to overthrow the government. 
  It was served to him on a silver platter, as they say, but 
Sergio was unable to take advantage of the opportunity to 
express the Sandinist thought on the civil, trade union, 
nonviolent struggle that is possible today in Nicaragua for the 
precise reason that we had 10 years of revolution. This, among 
other things, enabled us to create a police force and army that 
are unquestionably the most respectful of citizens' rights of 
any on the American Continent. I do not deny that they have 
occasionally been guilty of excesses which we must not minimize 
or let pass without taking appropriate measures, but it is a 
fact that, with respect to repression, our people are in a 
position of clear privilege compared with other nations in Latin 
America and the United States itself. 
  We cannot forget that Martin Luther King was assassinated 
and 
that J. Edgar Hoover's FBI acted in a criminal fashion to 
neutralize him, that history is repeated every day against 
Father Roy Burgois, Brian Wilson, and many other distinguished 
followers of Dr. King in the civil struggle for peace and 
justice. 
  However, it is also true that here in Nicaragua, the 
revolution gave us areas in which we may resort to a civil, 
nonviolent struggle in order to achieve justice without having 
to face tanks. When a Sandinist leader is asked about this--and 
even if he is not asked--the most appropriate response is to 
explain how we must make use of such opportunities for the civil 
struggle. 
  Sergio's responses are totally unsatisfactory because Sergio 
actually clearly opposes the people's struggle, any 
struggle of the people, not just the armed struggle. His recent 
statements on the subject lead one to conclude that Sergio 
believes that members of Parliament and high-ranking party 
leaders are the only persons qualified to fight for justice in 
Nicaragua. 
  It therefore follows that if the people's organizations 
become involved in the fight, instead of making a contribution, 
they would only hinder the great achievements that the "elite" 
groups always say they are "on the verge of obtaining." 
  Why such contempt for the rank and file? Why must we think 
that only those at the top may control the reins of our nation's 
fate instead of recognizing that the fight to improve and 
develop our country must be waged from all three trenches: the 
party, Legislature, and the people's organizations? Every one of 
these three trenches has its own methods, rhetoric, and way of 
articulating things. They are different but complementary and it 
is a serious error to try to exclude any one of them from the 
struggle. 
  All three of these trenches are important, but the most 
important one of all--because it is the only one that is 
indispensable--is none of the ones at the top! The most 
important trench from which the war must be waged has to be the 
people's organizations, whose main actions of persuasion do not 
take place in air-conditioned halls, but in the streets, the 
sun, often causing disturbances and sometimes unfortunate and 
even condemnable incidents. And yet, this is no reason to 
abandon the civil struggle. We must perfect our methods to make 
them more effective. 
  On 22 May 1991, when we in the Communal Movement summoned a 
demonstration in front of the National Assembly in order to put 
pressure on the government of President Violeta Chamorro to turn 
over titles to the beneficiaries of Laws 85 and 86, and when, 
instead of the 3,000 persons that we expected, nearly 40,000 
thronged to the square, I recall Sergio's great concern when he 
learned that we were approaching the National Assembly building. 
It was then that I began to notice Sergio's great distrust of 
the people. I do not know whether he also distrusts Tono Lacayo 
and the Alfredo Cesars. 
  Sergio admitted in the EL PAIS interview that in countries 
such as France, transportation strikes manage to close the 
highways and even isolate Paris. He does not oppose such strikes 
because, he says, they are trade union rather than political 
strikes. However, what distinguishes a strictly trade union 
strike from a political strike is the goal it pursues rather 
than those who support it. 
  Transportation strikes in developed countries could bring 
down governments, which would not necessarily be antidemocratic. 
In the case of Nicaragua, I do not think that anyone doubts that 
the FSLN has done more than any other opposition force would 
have done to prevent the government from growing any weaker and 
falling. I believe this was the right thing to do. 
  However, while it is true that we would not like to see the 
government fail, we should be even less happy to see a "renewed" 
Sandinist Front, a "Feeble Front" with more of an interest, at 
this point, in keeping the government from falling than in 
helping the people channel their civil struggle toward a 
positive path in order to achieve the fulfillment of their more 
than legitimate demands. Such a civil struggle would not be less 
democratic if, because of it, the government were to become 
unstable and even fall. 
  In a real confrontation between official policy and the 
interests or rights of the people, we must decide whether we are 
on the side of the people or the government. The Sandinist Front 
is and will always be on the side of the people. Even if some 
would like to change that identity, the vast majority of the 
FSLN, now aware of the danger, would never permit it.

    [Editorial Report] Managua LA PRENSA in Spanish of 26 March 
1994 on page 9 reports that Sandinist National Liberation Front 
[FSLN] leader Bayardo Arce denied reports that Daniel Ortega 
removed deputies William Ramirez and Herty Lewites from the Bank 
of Nicaragua (Banic) Board of Directors. According to Arce, 
Ortega had asked Antonio Lacayo not to ratify their positions 
until the FSLN National Directorate made a decision. According 
to the article, Ramirez and Lewites accused Ortega of conducting 
a "witch-hunt" against those who signed the document "For the 
Sandinism of the Majorities." Sergio Ramirez's heads the list of 
those signing the document. [For related information on this 
topic see FBIS-LAT-94-O59 pp 42-45.] 
  Supporters of Sergio Ramirez said that Ortega plans to place 
Luis Enrique Figueroa and former National Police Chief Rene 
Vivas on the Banic board in lieu of William Ramirez and Lewites. 
The article reports that Ortega is making "unilateral" decisions 
against the sympathizers of Dr. Sergio Ramirez. As a further 
example of this the article explains that Ortega removed Larry 
Astorga and Violeta Delgado from the leadership of the 19 July 
Sandinist Youth.

1994 on page 20 reports that the movement of 40 mestizo families 
into Miskito communities in the Wina and Amak territories is the 
source of potential conflict between the two groups. According 
to Nelson Lopez, coordinator of the Bosawas project, the lack of 
clearly defined agrarian policies and the pressure by landless 
peasants for land are complicating the issue. Levalth Matute, 
supreme leader of the Miskitos, stated: "We are the historic 
owners of these territories which are now being deforested by 
the mestizos to such an extent that the land is being turned 
into cattle ranches. We are extremely concerned about this." 
Miskito leaders pointed out that the Bosawas preserve should be 
maintained and that penetration by peasant families be halted. 
The article reports that to prevent conflicts the Bosawas 
project, which is sponsored by the Ministry of Environment and 
Natural Resources, is urging that deeds be issued to the owners 
of indigenous lands.

  [Text] The Foreign Ministry is waiting for the U.S. reply 
to the protest note it has sent in connection with the charges 
money is being laundered in Panama. 
  Foreign Minister Jose Raul Mulino has said a protest note 
was 
sent due to the U.S. charges the Panamanian Government has links 
with drug traffickers. He has said although the note was sent 
last week, there has still been no reply, but he excused the 
United States by saying it is possible the letter is being 
studied. 
  [Begin Mulino recording] As I have said many times, I have 
not said no crimes are committed. An economy such as ours, due 
to the openness with which the service and banking sectors are 
handled, could well be used for criminal acts. What I cannot 
accept is to say the authorities are behind this. 
  In the cases where crimes have been detected, we have taken 
action according to the law. If there are other cases about 
which someone knows or if some government has information a 
certain bank might be involved, it is their duty to report this 
at the highest level--like, check this out; this is what is 
happening; correct it. Briefly, this is what the note I have 
sent the United States says. [end recording] 
  Mulino expressed his desire to hold a meeting in Panama, 
which he requested in the note, to speak broadly about the topic 
and at the highest level.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 19 Apr (NA) -- Argentine Foreign 
Minister Guido Di Tella today stated that "efforts will be made" 
to have U.S. engineers clear the Malvinas Islands of mines 
because "their participation would be suitable from a technical 
standpoint so as to have an absolute guarantee." 
  Di Tella, speaking on the radio here in Buenos Aires, denied 
having scheduled an official meeting with the Foreign Office 
[preceding words in English] to discuss a program to clear the 
Malvinas Islands of the 33,000 mines laid during the 1982 war. 
He made it clear that "the issue involving mine clearing has, 
in effect, been a proposal we put forward last year." 
  The Argentine foreign minister stated that he and his 
British 
counterpart had agreed "to make every endeavor" to have this 
task "performed by U.S. engineers, since the objective is to 
have 100 percent success in the area that will be cleared of 
mines."

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 19 Apr (NA) -- An Argentine Navy task 
force captured four vessels flying the Korean flag that were 
fishing illegally in the exclusive economic zone within 
Argentine jurisdictional waters in the area of Port Deseado. 
  The capture was made on 18 April by the corvettes Espora, 
Rosales, Spiro, and Parker, which were patrolling when they 
discovered the foreign vessels fishing in Argentina's exclusive 
economic zone, some 190 miles east of Port Deseado. 
  The Argentine units captured the fishing vessels "Petero 
301," "Petero 303," and the "Jaiwgon," and later the "Dongwon 
311," all of them flying the Korean flag. 
  When ordered to heave to, the "Dongwon 311" did not obey the 
Espora's order to stop, and continued to flee despite the firing 
of warning shots until it decided to heave to. 
  The vessels' crews were taken to port and placed at the 
disposal of authorities, who will take the appropriate measures 
in accordance with the law.

general on Thursday. He got his job thanks to Carlos Menem,

in great esteem. And he confesses that he wears a suit and tie 
instead of the traditional windbreaker of the trade unions, out 
of "respect" for his interlocutors. 
  [Rios] Why does everyone ask if Carlos Menem got you your 
job 
as head of the CGT? 
  [Cassia] I know that people are saying that, but my 
conscience is clear. I was elected by the workers. It is true 
that I am a friend of Menem, and it is also true that the 
president may prefer one leader over another. But my friendship 
with Menem has nothing to do with the roles that everyone must 
play. 
  [Rios] But you cannot deny that Menem's nod toward your 
candidacy gave you a certain edge over other candidates for the 
leadership of the CGT. 
  [Cassia] Maybe the president likes this style of leadership 
that is coming to the CGT. But I am not servile. The CGT will 
operate completely independently of whatever maneuvering the 
government does. 
  [Rios] What role did Diego Ibanez play to help you achieve 
the highest rank in the CGT? 
  [Cassia] He is happy, because he devoted all of his good 
will 
to bringing this about. I am sitting here thanks to Diego's 
magnanimity, since he stepped aside from the union leadership. 
But to go from there to say that my comrade Ibanez interceded 
with the president to make me secretary general of the CGT is a 
lie. 
  [Rios] Nonetheless, it is not difficult to imagine that 
Diego 
Ibanez's presence on the presidential staff makes Menem's office 
more accessible.... 
  [Cassia] Of course, on the occasions when we need him to 
help 
us with something, Diego is always willing. But we also have 
direct mechanisms at our disposal for talking to the president. 
  [Rios] Some sources say that Eduardo Bauza did not want you 
to be leader of the CGT because at one point you were one of the 
driving forces behind Jose Octavio Bordon's political 
aspirations. Is that true? 
  [Cassia] I have great affection for Bauza, so that story 
strikes me as mindless speculation. We started working with 
Bordon before 1983 on a new internal line, and we were elected 
national deputies. But today, Bordon knows that we want Menem to 
be reelected and that he must choose his advisers more carefully 
to avoid political blunders. 
  [Rios] Apparently you have friends only in politics or in 
the 
labor movement.... 
  [Cassia] Well, I want to be everyone's friend. Even among 
the 
Radicals, I hold Cesar Jaroslavsky and Jesus Rodriguez, among 
others, in great esteem. But I also have many enemies in the 
field of ideas, and I always invite them to debate with me. That 
is why I am proposing a CGT with open doors. 
  [Rios] Are you a businessman-unionist? 
  [Cassia] No, I am a unionist who began working when 
Government Oil Deposits (YPF) was first founded. I have no 
businesses. Of course, if you consider that the leader of a 
union that set up businesses for the workers to take charge of 
is a businessman, then I am a businessman. But I feel that the 
word has a different meaning. 
  [Rios] But there is no doubt that you, always impeccably 
dressed in a suit and tie, have the "look" of a businessman. Do 
you not like windbreakers? 
  [Cassia] Everyone is free to dress the way he likes 
(laughs). 
I tend to wear a suit and tie out of respect for my 
interlocutors. I do not do so for the sake of elegance or 
attractiveness. 
  [Rios] As far as the CGT is concerned, is it good or bad for 
you that many people do not really know who you are? 
  [Cassia] I do not know, I have always liked to keep a low 
profile. I do not like to be a publicity hound. One thing I am 
certain of is that the best way to help the CGT will be for us 
leaders to get in step with the times and bring the labor 
movement back into the leading role it should have in society. 
  [Rios] Cassia, you talk about supporting the model, but it 
does not appear to give the trade unions a starring role. 
  [Cassia] The government knows full well that the changes 
were 
made possible by the workers' efforts. Now it is time for 
business to pay its fair share. Business cannot expect to just 
earn profits and live like kings. 
  [Rios] In fact, some trade unionists are accused of living 
like kings.... 
  [Cassia] I am not aware of that. That is a defamation 
campaign against the union leadership. 
<H5>  [Box, p 10] </H5>
<H5>  "It Is Not My Style To Threaten Strikes" </H5>
  A member of the "friendship club" of unionists who support 
the government, and now the incoming secretary general of the 
CGT, Antonio "Coco" Cassia has held the reins of the United 
Trade Union of State Petroleum Workers (SUPE) since 1982 [as 
published], when the veteran Diego Ibanez delegated authority 
over the organization to become a full-time adviser to Carlos 
Menem. 
  Back then, Cassia was already a natural member of the oil 
workers union hierarchy, fully involved in the transformation of 
YPF that resulted in the firing of some 30,000 workers. 
  In view of that situation, Cassia and company engineered the 
creation of approximately 200 cooperatives and small businesses 
that were built on the money obtained from severance packages. 

  -  YPF Adjustment: "Of the $10 billion paid on the foreign 
debt, nearly $8 billion came from the petroleum sector. We 
contributed to the country, not to a government. Today, YPF has 
8,000 actual employees and another 9,000 who were laid off but 
are in these business ventures." 
  -  Labor Flexibility: "I did not 
assume the leadership of the CGT to remain silent on labor 
reform. The proposal, as it stands now, favors only business. 
Any labor legislation will have to provide guarantees of 
investment, and we will not allow the workers' demands to be 
relegated to supplementary documents." 
  -  Social Programs: "We have 
commissioned a very serious survey that reveals that 70 percent 
of the system's beneficiaries want the unions to continue 
managing social programs, and they reject 
deregulation." 
  -  Unemployment: "The day we announce a drastic 
measure is the day we will carry it out. People are sick of 
hearing that there will be a strike, and then it is canceled. It 
is not my style to threaten strikes and not carry them 
out."

  [Text] Cochabamba -- Vice President Victor Hugo Cardenas 
assured FIDES NEW AGENCY that the struggle against drug 
trafficking will be more aggressive than in past governments; 
therefore, the United States and other international 
organizations must step up their cooperation for alternative 
development. 
  Regretting the fact that the reduction of coca leaf 
plantations did not take place at the pace established in 
bilateral agreements with the United States, which undoubtedly 
prompted some comments on the reduction of international 
cooperation, Cardenas said the reduction process was slow, not 
because the new government did not have the will but rather due 
to the electoral process that had its natural impact on state 
activities. 
  He added that the structural changes proposed by the 
government have hindered the fulfillment of those contracts, 
"but the executive branch's determination to fight drug 
trafficking is greater than that of past governments." 
  He said the Bolivian and U.S. Governments must negotiate 
with 
that criteria to establish the goals of the new anti-drug 
cooperation agreements and for alternative development. 
  Regarding U.S. cooperation in these fields, he said that no 
cooperation will be enough to solve the drug trafficking problem 
the country is enduring. 
  Cardenas said it is necessary that instead of reducing 
cooperation in the reduction of coca plantations, the efforts 
for alternative development must be increased. "The people get 
involved in coca production or drug trafficking, not out of 
habit but due to the poverty affecting large sectors of the 
nation." 
  He added that although international cooperation is 
important 
for alternative development, the existence of foreign markets 
for Bolivian products is no less important. 
  He added that if Bolivia finds markets it also will find 
important partners abroad that will make coca production 
unnecessary to sustain a more stable economy. 
  Regarding the controversy surrounding the subject of 
reducing 
coca plantations, which in the opinion of the industry's 
authorities increase in a sustained manner, Cardenas said that 
only those plantations classified as legal by Law No. 1008 
should be maintained, "but that surplus plantations must be 
reduced through agreements between coca growers and the 
government in a voluntary rather than a compulsory manner."

  [Text] The DEA "will have problems" with the Chamber of 
Deputies Constitution Committee if it is established that it 
exceeded its diplomatic duties and its role in the 
investigations into the alleged link between the MIR [Movement 
of the Revolutionary Left] and drug trafficking. 
  This was stated by an MBL [Free Bolivia Movement] deputy and 
member of the Constitution Committee, Juan del Granado, who said 
there are rules between Bolivia and the United States regarding 
the DEA's duties in Bolivia. 
  According to bilateral agreements between the U.S. Embassy 
and the Bolivian Foreign Ministry, DEA agents are banned from 
carrying weapons, participating in antinarcotic operations, and 
arresting and interrogating individuals on Bolivian territory. 
  Investigations into the alleged links of some MIR leaders to 
drug trafficking reveal that some DEA agents exceeded their 
duties by institutionally conducting the investigations and 
influencing the report on FELCN [Special Antinarcotics Force]'s 
conclusions. 
  Del Granado stated that there is strong evidence the DEA was 
directly involved in the subject by carrying out duties and 
roles not mentioned in the bilateral agreements between the two 
countries. 
  He added that an attempt will be made to establish the 
obvious deceitful, abusive, and prepotent behavior of DEA agents 
in our country.

  [Text] La Paz -- The Bolivian Armed Forces commander, 
General Fernando Sanjines Yanez, energetically condemned reports 
on the virtual "submission" of the Bolivian institutional system 
to the DEA and the violation, according to several reports, of 
national sovereignty. 
  Shortly after the end of a ceremony to celebrate the Army 
Engineering Command's 33d anniversary, Gen. Sanjines Yanez 
categorically stated: "It is our duty to see that the Bolivian 
institutions or foreign organizations established in our country 
respect our Constitution and demand that they all, with no 
exceptions, respect the country's physical integrity and 
national sovereignty." 
  Sanjines added: "The Armed Forces will never tolerate the 
violation of our country's integrity or sovereignty; this cannot 
be and less still will the Armed Forces allow it." 
  The Armed Forces' commander made this statement shortly 
after 
the DEA created a big scandal in Bolivia and Costa Rica due to 
its anti-drug operation procedures involving Edgar Fernandez 
Lazcano, right-hand man of alleged drug trafficker Isaac 
Chavarria, aka Oso, who is regarded as the key witness to 
clarify charges that the Movement of the Revolutionary Left has 
"links to drug traffickers." 
  So far, Government Ministry authorities have not come up 
with 
an explanation on the flight or abduction of Fernandez, in which 
the DEA appears directly involved together with Bolivian 
security forces and, particularly, the Special Antinarcotics 
Force [FELCN]. 
  Government Minister German Quiroga and Foreign Minister 
Antonio Aranibar Quiroga both asserted that the DEA did not 
abduct Fernandez, that he "escaped" on his own. Information 
from abroad, especially Costa Rica, however, state the opposite 
-- that is, that Fernandez arrived in and left Costa Rica 
accompanied by DEA agents. 
  This complex situation prompted opposition legislators in 
the 
last few hours to summon the government minister to Congress to 
give an official and detailed report on the developments in 
order to definitely determine the DEA's participation in the 
investigations into "narcolinks" that, without much evidence, 
FELCN reported involved top-ranking MIR leaders. 
  In the meantime, several institutions, such as the Armed 
Forces and others, condemned the charges of DEA intervention and 
demanded that President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada call for 
"greater respect for Bolivian dignity" in view of "U.S. 
interventionism."

  [Text] On 8 April, President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada 
admitted the country's "major dependency" on foreign power 
factors that have an impact on various Bolivian fields that 
cannot change from one day to the next without placing financial 
stability at risk. 
  In his speech during the main ceremony to mark the 42d 
anniversary of the national revolution, Sanchez de Lozada said: 
"Our dependency is on the IMF, the IDB [Inter-American 
Development Bank], and the U.S. Embassy, which tell us what we 
can and cannot do. And this is due to our weakness, but I want 
to tell you that what this government is doing is to go beyond 
what we are told to do." 
  Before an auditorium full of supporters, the chief of state 
asked the country for patience by pointing out that the major 
reforms will take some time to yield results because the 
government is determined to carry out a third revolution in 
democracy, "free of violence and shots... but with measures as 
important as those of the 1952 National Revolution and those 
that allowed the stabilization of our economy in 1985." 
  Addressing his political allies in the government, he asked 
them to get rid of susceptibilities and, above all, the idea 
that the MNR [Nationalist Revolutionary Movement] might 
disappear some day. He stated: "I am a businessman and my 
businesses and partners do well and each one has their separate 
share; the people are our common business now." 
  But he also warned the MNR that it would be disastrous to 
try 
to be a hegemonic party again because when this happens "one 
loses touch with reality and infighting starts, which is 
something the party already has experienced in the past. 
Competition is better than hegemony." 
  Regarding the opposition, he said that many parties 
disappeared because they believed in dogmas and myths and others 
because they let pragmatism prevail over their principles. 
  He also devoted several minutes of his speech to the reforms 
his government upholds. He said he intends to consolidate what 
the MNR started during the six times it came to power since 1952 
and project this work into the future. 
  Sanchez de Lozada said: "Capitalization, the peoples' 
participation, the education system's reform, and sustained 
development fall within the MNR's much-desired objective to 
consolidate the national state with social justice." 
  The capitalization project seeks to rescue the public 
enterprises to prevent them from the same fate as COMIBOL 
[Mining Corporation of Bolivia]. He added that it is not only 
an economic measure but also a social one because it is designed 
to redistribute wealth. 
  He said the peoples' participation project is a 500-year-old 
debt that is being honored because it will give the people 
economic and political power. It will allow a fair distribution 
of wealth according to the population, which means that a person 
from La Paz will have the same status as a person from Pando and 
a person from Potosi will be the same as a person from Santa 
Cruz. Let's hope it will work because the future of new 
generations is tied to the project's success.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Government Minister German Quiroga </F>
by radio director Father Eduardo Perez Iribarne in La Paz -- 
live] 
  [Excerpts] [Perez] Good morning, Minister German Quiroga. 
Would you like to clarify whether the telephones [of 
ex-President Jaime Paz Zamora] were tapped and also discuss the 
Entel [National Telecommunications Enterprise] telephone bills. 
The entire country is listening. Go ahead. 
  [Quiroga] Thank you. Good evening, Father. What I showed on 
national television last night was a request made by the 
narcotics prosecutor to Entel and Entel's answer on the 
telephone bills. What we have are the Entel bills, both of the 
telephones of [drug trafficker] [Isaac] Chavarria at his 
property in Las Maras, Santa Cruz Department, and his house in 
Irpavi. Therefore, there was no violation of any constitutional 
regulation. We had no access to any kind of conversation and 
this was clarified last night. All we did was to get the Entel 
bills on the calls made, and this was made through a request by 
the prosecutor. All the information including the telephone 
bills will be submitted today to the Controlled Substances Court 
and a legalized copy to the Constitutional and Chamber of 
Deputies Judicial Police Committee, where the investigation is 
being carried out. 
  [Perez] I have a cable from the ERBOL [Bolivian radio 
schools] news agency on your interview by reporter Carlos Mesa 
Guisbert last night on state television. Were the telephone 
calls made only from 1990 to 1991; were there any calls after 
1991, in 1992 or 1993? 
  [Quiroga] The telephone calls were from 1989 to 1993. There 
are also two telephone bills after the presidential term, in 
September 1993. 
  [Perez] In other words, the telephone contacts between Isaac 
Chavarria and ex-President Jaime Paz Zamora were before, during, 
and after his presidential term. 
  [Quiroga] What can really be proven through the prosecutor's 
request is that El Picacho's [Paz Zamora's house] telephone was 
called from Chavarria's telephone 10 times from 1989 to 1993. 
  [Perez] You clearly said there was communication between the 
two telephones and obviously due to Article 20 of the 
Constitution it was not possible to know who talked on the 
phones. 
  [Quiroga] It cannot be established who talked from on each 
end of the telephones. The only thing that can be established is 
that the two telephones were in contact. It also can be 
established through the telephone bills how long the calls were 
because the bills show the time and the amount. But it will be 
impossible to establish who spoke on the phone. [passage omitted] 
  [Perez] As government minister you are the top political 
authority in the country and must enforce the Constitution on 
behalf of the president. Can you guarantee the entire country 
that in Bolivia no telephones are tapped by anyone and under no 
circumstances? 
  [Quiroga] By anyone and under no circumstances from the 
ethical and legal point of view. And also from the technical 
point of view, we cannot do it because we do not have the 
equipment in the ministry to do it. I invite you and the media 
to visit the intelligence services to see that technically we 
cannot do it. But we would not do it either because of legal and 
ethical principles. [passage omitted]

  [Text] President Itamar Franco today stated in Brasilia 
that the government is determined to conclude the constitutional 
revision process. In brief remarks to reporters at Planalto 
Palace, Franco also commented on the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic 
Movement Party] in his government and the implementation of the 
real: 
  [Begin Franco recording] There is nothing to fear about the 
implementation of the real because the government will announce 
the date for its implementation 35 days in advance. 
  The government has never stopped supporting the 
constitutional revision process, but I have stressed that the 
revision is an issue that falls within the specific jurisdiction 
of Congress. The government is, however, determined to 
successfully complete the constitutional revision process. 
  It is not important at this time to discuss who is to blame 
for the impasse. If the members of Congress are willing to sit 
and discuss with us segments of the constitutional revision, we 
are ready to do that. 
  I am a founding member of the PMDB; I was the eighth member 
to sign the national PMDB list. But the problem rests with the 
party. If the PMDB decides to withdraw its support for the 
government, it will do it. The PMDB should keep in mind, 
however, that PMDB members served for several months in 
important ministerial posts. Thus, if the government has not 
succeeded in meeting the PMDB's desires, then the PMDB should 
certainly assume its share of responsibility for this failure.

  [Text] Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero today said he will 
further lower import taxes to make internal prices drop. He said 
that whomever commits price abuses will have to compete with 
cheaper and perhaps better-quality products. Ricupero favors 
putting the real into circulation as soon as possible but did 
not specify a date. He also supports the conversion of foreign 
debt titles to finance education projects. Such a conversion 
already is being applied to social and environmental projects. 
  Minister Ricupero also said that he trusts in the economic 
program's success, even though some economic sectors still are 
not operating in URV's [Real Value Unit]. This week he will 
announce the form of conversion for postal fees. 
  Minister Ricupero today met Deputy Tarcisio Delgado, leader 
of the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] in the Chamber 
of Deputies, and told him that Congress should establish in the 
Constitution only the general principles of the tax and social 
security reform. The rules for these reforms, the minister said, 
should be defined through complementary laws.

  [Text] The strike by the metalworkers of the Sao Paulo 
industrial belt could spread, as of tomorrow, to the factories 
for machines and electrical and electronic equipment. After 
failing to reach an agreement at a conciliation meeting at the 
Regional Labor Court (TRT) yesterday, the sector held a meeting 
and decided to continue with the stoppage and expand it. The 
measure is already affecting 12,500 workers of the sector. 
  According to the Diadema Metalworkers' Union, five more 
enterprises will be paralyzed as of tomorrow, among them Kepler 
Weber, which produces heaters. The TRT will make a decision on 
the strike on Tuesday. Representatives of the enterprises 
producing capital goods and electric and electronic equipment 
claim that sales in the sector have not yet improved, as they 
have in the automobile sector, and that enterprises cannot pay 
the 19 percent salary increase paid by car manufacturers. The 
workers, however, rejected the 4 percent readjustment offered by 
the enterprises. 
  The strike began to lose strength in other sectors. Among 
car 
manufacturers, only Scania and Mercedes remain paralyzed. To 
return to their jobs the employees of the two enterprises want 
to agree on new contract terms in their collective bargaining 
negotiations. "We want a clause establishing at least the 
gradual reduction of the labor day," Jeferson Gaule Sampaio, of 
the Mercedes factory commission, said.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" report by Jayme Brener in Fort Lauderdale, </F>
Helio Contreiras in Rio de Janeiro, and Sonia Figueiras in 
Brasilia; date not given] 
  [Text] If a dictionary on neoliberalism were to be 
compiled, the term privatization should be defined as: "The act 
of selling a public company to private investors, seeking to 
reduce the public debt." So, should investors believe the term 
private sector means that the pertaining public company will 
change owners and orientation? Not always. The auction of 
Embraer [Brazilian Aeronautics Company]--which is scheduled for 
20 May in Sao Paulo--may be a kind of self-privatization. 
Managers of the most profitable Embraer subsidiary, the Embraer 
Aircraft Corporation (EAC), its U.S. subsidiary, are preparing 
themselves--under EAC President Newton Berwig from Rio Grande do 
Sul--to purchase this filet mignon from Embraer. It is really a 
filet mignon because there is evidence that the EAC--which is 
totally controlled by Embraer--has for years been fattened with 
juicy commissions and exclusive rights to sell Embraer planes 
while the mother company increasingly suffered the losses. "Of 
course we would like our independence," Berwig told ISTOE 
reporter Osmar Freitas Junior at the EAC headquarters in Fort 
Lauderdale, Florida. 
  "I am very surprised over this self-purchase attempt, which 
has never been mentioned during the high command meetings," said 
Brigadier Mauro Gandra, chief of the Civil Aviation Department. 
The conditions of the auction, which were published on 5 April, 
do not foresee this possibility. The Air Force, which generated 
and protected Embraer, never discussed the possibility of 
dismembering the company. "I favor the independency of the EAC 
but I do not know if the company can purchase itself," Embraer 
President Ozires Silva told ISTOE in Sao Jose dos Campos. For 
this reason Newton Berwig has summoned, at the request of Ozires 
Silva, a group of brokers. They are offering Embraer to U.S. 
investors, especially those in the financial field. If they form 
a consortium and buy it, the next step will be to divide it into 
three. The military part of Embraer will remain under the 
control of the Air Force in light of its reluctance to sell. The 
EAC would then remain light and free, metamorphosed into an 
independent company with exclusive rights to sell 
Embraer-produced Brasilias, CBA-123's, and Bandeirantes 
worldwide, except for Latin America. The civilian part of 
Embraer would be managed by the consortium. Given that the 
investors know planes only as passengers, they will have to hire 
experts for the new Embraer. The strongest candidates for these 
positions are members of the team headed by Ozires Silva, who 
founded Embraer in 1969 and who has shown a remarkable example 
of political survival. Except for a few months during the Collor 
administration, Ozires has always managed Embraer. And he may 
not step down. "I believe that if the new company chief comes 
from the financial field he may maintain the current company 
management," Brigadier Gandra said. "I do not know if Ozires 
will remain in his post, but I believe that he should remain 
because he is the father of Embraer and he knows the company," 
echoed Newton Berwig. 
  But this is not what most consultants are telling their 
clients who are interested in Embraer's privatization. Brigadier 
Lauro Ney Menezes, retired, a former director of the Sao Jose 
dos Campos Technical Aerospace Center said: "There has been a 
managerial perpetuation that has steadily followed questionable 
guidelines." Menezes is today an independent consultant. 
Multiplic Bank director Manuel Cintra added: "Following the 
auction, Embraer must have a new board of directors because, 
although it has a team of qualified managers, they are used to a 
subsidized system." Multiplic was asked by Newton Berwig to take 
part in Embraer's self-privatization, but declined. 
  The domestic solution proposed by Berwig/Ozires does have 
one 
point in its favor: There has been little interest, at least 
thus far, by foreign investors in Embraer's auction. It should 
be noted that the terms of the proposal will affect this and the 
next generation. The government has committed itself to 
liquidating a $640 million debt of Embraer. This loss will, of 
course, be paid by taxpayers. The established value is $295 
million plus $30 million, which will have to be fueled to 
Embraer. The package could turn out to be a bad deal because it 
also includes $205 million in debts accrued since 1993, which 
the 31 December 1992 auction notice astutely overlooked. The 
notice envisages the sale of 60 percent of Embraer shares, of 
which up to 40 percent will be available for foreign investors. 
The state, through the Air Force, will keep 20 percent of the 
shares plus the Golden Shares; that is, those with a veto right 
concerning strategic decisions, especially those dealing with 
military initiatives. The 5,600 Embraer employees will be able 
to buy 10 percent of the shares at a 70 percent discount, and 
the remaining 10 percent will be offered to small investors. 
  Foreign companies are not being deterred either by the 
limits 
imposed on the amount of shares they may buy, or by the Golden 
Shares. Joao Antonio Lopes, president of the Trevisan consulting 
company, said: "The problem stems from the lack of governmental 
decision to support the aerospace industry." He added: "The 
presidents of the United States and France have taken the 
initiative personally and have engaged in diplomatic efforts to 
advertise their industrial products." No major aerospace, space, 
or military company has ever prospered without the help of its 
own government. The privatization proposal includes the purchase 
by the government of the CBA-123 project. The problem is that 
state support for military and aerospace industry has declined 
in recent years. 
  Despite the doubts existing in Brasilia about Embraer, there 
are at least three consortia--in addition to those supporting 
Newton Berwig's "self-privatization" proposal--that are planning 
to participate in the auction. Another former president of 
Embraer, Ozilio Silva, (no relative of Ozires), who is being 
advised by Trevisan, is backed by the French Bank and the 
Brazilian Bank. He hopes to win the auction through the 
participation of Martin Marietta, one of the giants of the U.S. 
aerospace industry. Silva does not favor the division of 
Embraer. He is also dealing with Raytheon, a company that has 
already got a foot--or, rather, a toe--in Brazil. Raytheon is 
bidding for a project to set up the Amazon Region Surveillance 
System (Sivam). As its Brazilian partner, Ozilio is negotiating 
with the Constran construction company. He hopes foreign 
investors will consider Embraer as a first step toward larger 
investments in the aerospace program and in the privatization of 
the Brazilian communications system. It is also expected that 
consortia organized by the Monteiro Aranha group and by the 
Multiplic Bank will also participate in the auction. 
  Some people oppose the privatization. The metal workers 
union 
and the Sao Jose dos Campos engineers union have called for a 
recovery project for Embraer by a group of consultants headed by 
Amir Khair, former finance secretary of the PT [Workers Party] 
Sao Paulo Municipal administration. The document concludes that 
Embraer could recover with a $70 million injection without being 
privatized. "No matter the future of the public company, the 
main issue is that there should be a committee of civilian 
institutions to control its activities and to prevent financial 
disasters," Khair said. 
  Embraer executives believe the group that is best prepared 
for the auction is Newton Berwig, mainly because it started 
organizing earlier than the rest. "The self-purchase of the EAC 
has been talked about for a long time," said a company manager 
who did not want to be identified. An Embraer document dated 
1991--when the public company was trying to reorganize itself to 
overcome the national economic crisis--lists different ways to 
fatten the EAC. The document states: "Profit opportunity: The 
EAC creates a subsidiary to finance Embraer planes. In a fiscal 
paradise, the EAC Finance Corporation could also facilitate the 
international financial operations of Embraer." These points 
interest those who want to extend their field of operations. 
From this restructuring the EAC became much stronger. Since 
Embraer owed it $40 million, the EAC purchased--at $15 million 
off the debt--the exclusive right to sell Embraer planes 
worldwide, except for Latin America. Fantastic business. One 
Embraer executive said: "We were naive and did not see that the 
EAC was getting stronger at the expense of Embraer." 
  This naivete is due to the EAC's unblemished record. The 
company has sold nine out of every 10 Brasilias, the most 
successful Embraer plane. The EAC placed 270 airplanes in the 
demanding U.S. market which gave it in 1990 a 38-percent share 
of the international 21-40 seat airplane market. The EAC, which 
has 125 employees, operates from a two-building complex, the 
kind which Americans call clean cut high-tech [preceding three 
words in English]. The modern parts control and management 
software of the EAC has been adopted by large U.S. companies 
like Northrop. 
  Since its foundation in 1989, the EAC has placed more than 
300 Bandeirantes planes in Uncle Sam's skies. It is true that 
the EAC received a lot of aid from the mother company. To 
guarantee a place in the U.S. market, many Brasilias were sold 
at very low prices. For example, a contract with the large U.S. 
company Continental to supply it with 100 airplanes was closed 
at a loss. This means it lost money on the deal. The expectation 
was to make money later, when the Brasilia would be a known 
airplane in U.S. skies. It is just that "later" came the U.S. 
recession which made the EAC sales drop considerably. 
  In times of economic depression, everyone must tighten their 
belts. One would think that the commission of Embraer salesmen 
should have also been reduced. Wrong. Sales commission 
represents EAC's black box or double accounting. When the 
company was created, enormous commission was paid: 18 or 19 
percent for each Bandeirantes that was sold. It was really a 
concealed way to inject capital into the EAC, seeking to 
stabilize it and avoid problems with the Brazilian Government. 
Commission dropped to 14.2 percent in 1986, to 10 percent in 
1887, and stabilized at 12 percent in 1989. Commission never 
varied from this fantastic percentage which is greater than the 
international average. For each Brasilia sold for, let us say, 
$7.5 million, the EAC received $900,000. On a sliding scale, 2 
percent of the commission was divided among all the EAC 
employees, from the president to the janitor. The management 
kept $5,000--nearly the price of a cheap car--for every Brasilia 
delivered. In 1989 the EAC sold nearly 60 planes in the United 
States and each EAC executive received $300,000, apart from his 
salary. 
  During the following years the number of planes sold and 
delivered abroad dropped considerably. Only 15 planes were sold 
in 1992. A restructuring proposal in 1991 foresaw a cut in the 
sales commissions. Berwig said he accepted this proposal. The 
EAC president then froze the salaries of the executives and main 
salesmen at their highest average rate. That is, salaries plus 
commission. From that figure he cut 20 percent. "If sales had 
increased, the measure would have represented a real saving, but 
sales continued to drop and the incorporation of commission into 
the salaries represented an increased cost for the EAC," said a 
former EAC director. This means the big EAC bosses earn an 
annual salary of at least $300,000. Some Embraer people believe 
they even reach $500,000--which not even a Ford or IBM executive 
would scorn. "In some cases the commission exceeded the labor 
cost of the plane," a former Embraer director said. 
  Meanwhile, in the world of the Brasilia, Embraer faces 
serious turbulence. The U.S. recession was slowly overcome but 
sales continued low, perhaps partly due to the lack of 
stimulation that the commission represented to EAC salesmen. 
Their salaries, however, continue very nicely thank you. In 
practice, Embraer continues to inject capital into its 
subsidiary and we should not be surprised if the well-nourished 
prodigal son wants his independence. 
  Newton Berwig blames the company's salary situation on the 
U.S. Internal Revenue Service which forbids cutting commission 
under the pretext of combating tax evasion. Some years ago the 
EAC spent nearly $1 million on lawyers to explain to the U.S. 
Internal Revenue Service that sales commission had been 
stabilized at 12 percent. No changes have been made since then; 
salaries continue high and the main Sao Jose dos Campos company, 
which is totally indebted, has not done anything about it. The 
EAC maintains the Embraer planes sold in the United States by 
buying spare parts at a 30 percent discount. In 1992 the EAC 
received two free Brasilia planes, to increase its capital, and 
an enormous stock of Brasilia spare parts to pay for Embraer 
debts. But Embraer still owes $20 million to EAC. "We were 
unable to stop this drainage of funds," one Embraer executive 
regrets. Berwig's enemies--and there are many inside 
Embraer--have another version. They say that Berwig, a U.S. 
naturalized citizen and former U.S. Air Force pilot, has a 
"secret" contract with Embraer. 
  A secret clause requires that approximately $4 million would 
be paid immediately to Berwig as severance pay--in addition to 
other benefits over the next few years--should he be dismissed. 
The self-purchase of the EAC would also certainly be 
advantageous to Embraer because it would preclude an audit that 
new owners would certainly order. 
  The privatization/EAC self-purchase imbroglio is just 
another 
mishap in the history of Embraer. The company started out with 
the blessings of the Air Force in the form of an initial order 
of dozens of Bandeirante planes. It had all kinds of incentives: 
between 1970 and 1988, any corporation could deposit 1 percent 
of its income tax in Embraer. To promote the acceptance of 
Brazilian planes in the United States, the Brazilian Government 
removed all duties on the import of planes. The only problem is 
that Brasilias, Tucanos, and the like today face an altogether 
different market constraint: a 19.2-percent fiscal burden. 
  Embraer, which combines aeronautical production, advanced 
technology, and military industry, has become an easy target for 
political maneuvers. Salo Roth, former director of the EAC and 
an Embraer official for 18 years, said: "In the 1980's, Ozires 
Silva unwillingly embarked on the creation of Orbita, a company 
to manufacture missiles but which failed." There were 
international operations like the bold triangular operation 
through Great Britain of four Brasilias to Bophutatswana, a 
black territory that was only recognized by South Africa. Brazil 
officially opposed the racist South African regime and endorsed 
all UN resolutions against it. 
  During the government of Jose Sarney, who in 1987 signed a 
cooperation agreement with Argentina, Embraer began the CBA-123 
binational aircraft project. Yet, the Argentine money never 
came. The Brazilian money did not come either. Nevertheless, 
Embraer president Ozilio Silva decided to develop the aircraft 
anyway. The CBA-123 model has the novel feature of having its 
engines set backwards. The money was obtained from the financial 
market at soaring interest rates. The CBA-123 is almost ready. 
There are three prototypes, but they are not selling. The 
project represents a $300 million loss. The loss is even higher 
in the case of the AMX subsonic fighter project, which was 
implemented jointly with Italian companies. The Air Force fell 
behind in paying because of its critical financial situation and 
even considered backtracking completely. It will purchase only 
22 aircraft. That is all. 
  Although it is on the brink of collapsing, Embraer has 
savored some victories. The main ones are the Tucano and the 
EMB-145. The Tucano, a training plane, is considered to be one 
of the best of its kind in the world. The Tucano accounts for 45 
percent of this type of aircraft on the market. In association 
with Northrop, Embraer is participating in a bid worth millions 
of dollars to supply 675 aircraft to the U.S. Air Force and 
Navy. The EMB-145, which is still on the drawing board, will be 
a beautiful 50-passenger jet plane and there are already 136 
orders for it. Whether these orders will be fulfilled depends on 
what the future holds for Embraer. 
  Based on these possibilities and under the labor union 
proposal, the Committee Against the Privatization of 
Embraer--which comprises dozens of institutions--will try to get 
the 20 May auction suspended. The auction represents another 
bird being sucked into the Embraer turbines. The enemies of 
privatization maintain that the auction conditions must be 
approved by Congress, which has not happened. Decree-Law No. 
770/69--which created Embraer--states: "In the ordinary issuance 
of shares to increase capital, the Federal Government must 
underwrite enough shares to guarantee a minimum 51 percent of 
the voting stocks." If privatization takes place without the 
annulment of the decree, the auction process may be blocked by 
lawsuits. 
  The contenders have got the ball rolling, and the result 
will 
be known on 20 May, the date of the auction. Self-purchase or 
pure and simple privatization, a great duel will take place 
between the Silvas. On one hand, Ozires Silva, colonel and 
eternal Embraer commander, on the other hand, former Embraer 
president Ozilio Silva. They have known each other for 40 years, 
they were great allies, but know they treat each other 
contemptuously. Curiously enough, the two Silvas live in the 
same condominium, the luxurious Bosque do Engenho, in Sao Jose 
dos Campos, with its magnificent view of the marshlands. Will 
passengers please fasten their seat belts. 
<H5>  The AMX </H5>
  This is an ambitious subsonic fighter plane for ground 
attack, developed by Embraer, Alenia, and Aermacchi (Italy). The 
project has been superseded and its cost is approximately that 
of a modern American F-16. It has accumulated enormous losses. 
<H5>  The CBA-123 </H5>
  This is the result of a political agreement between Brazil 
and Argentina. It never received the funds promised by the two 
governments. Embraer developed the plane by contracting loans 
from the financial market. It represents a $300 million loss. 
<H5>  The Bandeirante </H5>
  Created in the 1970's, it represented Embraer's business 
card 
in the international market. More than 300 units were sold in 
the United States alone. The Bandeirante consolidated Embraer's 
position in its regional aviation niche. 
<H5>  The Brasilia </H5>
  The successor to the Bandeirante with a pressurized cabin, 
it 
has allowed Embraer to control more than one third of its 
regional aviation market in the world. Nearly 320 units were 
sold, 83 percent of which were sold in the United States. 
<H5>  The Tucano </H5>
  A military training airplane, considered one of the best 
planes in use in the world, it controls 45 percent of its market 
and is manufactured under license in the United Kingdom. It can 
be used in the antiguerrilla struggle.

  [Text] Medellin, Colombia, 19 Apr (AFP) -- Jorge Eliecer 
Avendano, alias "El Loco," an alleged member of the Medellin 
Cartel, surrendered voluntarily to justice in this northeastern 
Colombian city on Tuesday, it has been officially reported. 
  The alleged criminal is the brother of Jorge Eduardo "Tato" 
Avendano, a lieutenant of late Pablo Escobar, who after escaping 
with the "capo" and eight other collaborators in July 1992 from 
Envigado Prison surrendered to justice two months later. 
  According to Fernando Mancilla, Antioquia Department 
regional 
prosecutor, "Loco" Avendano's surrender "was carried out 
normally," and after giving his first deposition to authorities, 
he was confined to the prison of the neighboring locality of 
Itagui, where there are other Escobar henchmen. 
  The judicial official has refrained from commenting on 
whether this surrender means the resumption of cartel members 
surrendering to justice to take advantage of the legislation 
contemplating reduced jail sentences and other benefits for drug 
traffickers who turn themselves in and confess at least one of 
their offenses.

  [Text] The selection of an Indian leader as Antonio 
Navarro's running mate, the emergence of a parliamentary bloc 
made up of the independent sectors that won Sunday's contest, 
and the desertion of at least one of the visible leaders of M-19 
are three of the immediate consequences of AD/M-19's 
catastrophic electoral defeat. 
  Yesterday, Navarro decided to officially register his 
presidential candidacy and to bet on the electoral potential of 
ethnic minorities by choosing Jesus Enrique Pinacue as his 
political "buddy." 
  Several days ago, crushed by the organization's election 
results (the M-19 delegation was reduced to a single seat in the 
Chamber of Representatives), Navarro himself sent a letter to 
the independent aspirants who were assured of seats in the 
Senate for the next four years. He did not win their support, 
while on the other hand, the winners (among them Senator Samuel 
Moreno, who this time decided to run for reelection outside the 
Democratic Alliance; Jaime Dussan, Jorge Santos, Jairo 
Clopatofsky, and Manuel Cepeda) met to forge a bloc for 
legislative work. 
  It was a debacle for the organization. Representative 
Gustavo 
Petro resigned from the group; Senator Anibal Palacio, 
representing the Hope, Peace, and Liberty sector, is not sure 
whether he will support Navarro; and Angelino Garzon is in the 
same boat. 
  AD/M-19 has coldly examined its recent electoral failure and 
attributed it to four factors: the lack of solid regional and 
social bases, the institutional difficulties it faced, the very 
leadership of the movement, and its campaign tactics. 
  First, because it says the movement was built in just the 
opposite way as the Revolutionary Workers Party (PRT) of Mexico 
or the Farabundo Marti Front of El Salvador, that is, "from the 
top rather than from the bottom." Second, because it says it is 
at a disadvantage compared to the electoral machinery that uses 
key government posts to garner votes (offering jobs and spoils); 
because it has no money to wage a costly campaign against 
opponents who spend billions of pesos; because the Law on 
Parties that helped it came too late; and because the national 
Constitution is still developing in a timid way, and "in real 
life" no turn-around has been seen. 
  Third, because it gave star treatment to certain 
individuals, 
since the people who were commanders of the demobilized 
organizations at the time were automatically made political 
leaders, and some of them had no abilities in that direction. 
Other leaders were shut out; everyone wanted to be a colonel, 
and no one would obey either Navarro or the collective 
presidency. The AD delegation did not behave like a collegiate 
body, and took only sporadic, individual actions; work done 
outside of parliament was squandered; its power was centralized; 
and when it withdrew from the government, it did not know how to 
act like an opposition party. 
  Fourth, because people were allowed to run for office and 
then did not meet expectations; because of the number of lists; 
and because of the abysmal organization on election day. 
  This newspaper interviewed four parliamentarians, Senators 
Anibal Palacio and Everth Bustamante and Representatives Gustavo 
Petro and Gloria Quiceno, to learn what they thought of the 
mistakes that were made in the elections and of M-19's future 
prospects. 
<H5>  Senator Anibal Palacio </H5>

  -  We have deputies, council members, and leadership 
positions in some regions of the country, and based on those 
calculations, we thought we would have enough votes to come out 
ahead. Since politics is unpredictable, we were wrong. We were 
competing on unequal terms; the campaign cost a lot of money. It 
is more difficult to be in the opposition in democratic life 
because you have to win people's support and compete on unequal 
terms. The worst thing that can happen to the country is for the 
peace talks between the government and the insurgent groups to 
go up in smoke. They must be turned around. 
  -  We have not made a 
decision on the presidential candidacies. By October we will be 
working on the council and assembly seats that are feasible. We 
have laid some groundwork, and we are willing to enter into 
agreements. 

<H5>    Representative Gustavo Petro </H5>

  -  There was a false premise in the entire AD/M-19 for the 
last two years: failing to recognize that we were wrong in 
adopting all the traditional forms of engaging in politics in 
Colombia. 
  -  The dissolution of AD can be a way to build a movement 
that will emerge from the citizens themselves, to confront 
Congress regarding its attempt to destroy the Constitution, and 
to confront the friends of war as well. 
  -  AD/M-19 has to go 
through a process of self-criticism and radical revision, and it 
must understand that the electoral defeat dealt us by the 
Colombian people is our punishment for being confused with the 
traditional parties. We must show the country a new way of doing 
politics from the bottom, from the people. 

<H5>    Representative Gloria Quiceno </H5>

  -  Internally, the political differences that have plagued us 
for the last two and a half years took their toll. Another 
problem was the electoral strategy of "Operation Wasp," which 
was not the best thing for a new, young organization without 
much experience in politics. Furthermore, we do not have 
clients, or posts, or markets, or machinery to offer, and that 
was what won the election in the vast majority of cases. My 
personal mistake, I think, was that I went along with that 
strategy. 
  -  The first thing we have to do is accept the blame for 
the electoral failure, make corrections, explore the depth of 
feelings, and begin building from the plaza, the barrio, the 
municipality. We have to roll up our sleeves and get involved in 
community projects. And we must support the candidates in 
council and mayoral elections, and Navarro as well. 

<H5>    Senator Everth Bustamante </H5>

  -  We were all wrong. We projected an image of division, and 
we paid the price for not yielding to that situation. We gave an 
impression of weakness, of scatteredness, and now the electoral 
defeat is forcing us to rethink our ideas. 
  -  For now, AD/M-19 is 
backing the candidacy of Antonio Navarro, and later on, it will 
strive to establish a presence in the municipalities and 
departments in October. It will have to be an organized and 
systematic effort to field the largest number of candidates. In 
this way, the movement will begin to put down roots at the local 
level, abandoning that great activism in national debates that 
isolated us from the people.

<F P=106> [Interview with AD/M-19 presidential candidate Antonio </F>
Navarro by Bibiana Mercado; place and date not given] 
  [Text] Is Navarro in check, now that the M-19 Democratic 
Alliance (AD/M-19) has been defeated in parliamentary elections? 
Is there a threat to the reintegrated guerrilla groups' 
participation in democracy? Why choose an Indian as a running 
mate? Antonio Navarro answered these and other questions for EL 
TIEMPO. 
  Despite the recent electoral defeat, the AD/M-19 
presidential 
candidate, who registered his candidacy under the name of 
Commitment Colombia after including Paez Indian Jesus Pinacue on 
his ticket as the vice presidential candidate, is confident that 
the results of 29 May will favor him. 
  "The presidential vote involves more freedom, more opinion, 
and less coercion and patronage than the parliamentary 
elections," he explains. 
  In addition, he announced that the campaign will enter a new 
phase. He will switch from the whistle stops at small towns, 
where he signed nearly 160 commitments to the community, to 
appearances in the plazas of major cities, always accompanied by 
Pinacue. He will launch a publicity campaign that he says will 
be very original. 
  [Mercado] Is AD/M-19 still the decisive political force 
destined to disrupt the pattern of liberal-conservative voting? 
  [Navarro] Let us put things in the proper terms. There are a 
number of candidacies: Samper's, Pastrana's, Navarro's...I am 
certain that on 29 May we will come in third in the voting, and 
we will be decisive in the presidential election. 
  [Mercado] Why are prominent members of your organization 
deserting? 
  [Navarro] We must speak in the singular. The only member of 
parliament who has said he is leaving AD/M-19 is Gustavo Petro, 
and I hope to keep him with us. The others are in AD, and so far 
they have not said they are leaving. 
  [Mercado] Is it not true that the inclusion in your program 
of Pedro Bonnet, Mario Laserna, and Samuel Moreno, who were 
elected with "M" votes and then left the organization, deprived 
AD of votes? 
  [Navarro] It is possible, but the fact that it did not 
present a clear and coherent option to the electorate deprived 
it of even more votes. The excessive number of lists, without 
any that managed to make an impact on public opinion, took away 
more votes. 
  [Mercado] Name four points in your platform that distinguish 
you from Ernesto Samper and Andres Pastrana. 
  [Navarro] First, our genuine interest and proven experience 
in the area of peace. No one has the experience or the vocation 
for peace that we have. Second, it appears that the 
anticorruption theme has gone out of style in Samper's and 
Pastrana's candidacies. This is a central issue, and we are 
going to launch an "Operation Clean Hands" to put corrupt 
people, no matter who they are, in jail. Third, social justice. 
We have felt the impact of social inequality directly and 
personally. 
  The fact that Jesus Pinacue is on our team represents the 
need for a social rule of law that is practicable, with a major 
investment in social programs and changes in the structure of 
society. Fourth, we are adamantly opposed to the economic 
liberalization as it has been implemented in the neoliberal 
style. 
  [Mercado] Some say you have brought Jesus Pinacue on board 
as 
the last vestige of hope for salvaging M-19 from the crisis.... 
  [Navarro] As Pinacue has said, "Do you think we Indians are 
still children who allow ourselves to be manipulated?" That is 
the best possible response. Pinacue is responding to an 
organization that is mature and makes the right decisions. 
  On the other hand, we are honoring the Constitution of 1991, 
which said that this Colombia was for everyone. Pinacue 
represents the human face of this country, the silent voice of 
millions of Colombians, and the values that have been outlined. 
  [Mercado] What do you think of Samper's and Pastrana's vice 
presidential candidates? 
  [Navarro] That they add absolutely nothing to the ticket, 
because they are nothing new. It is like saying, "I am running 
with myself." 
  [Mercado] What did the defeat of 13 March teach you? 
  [Navarro] That we must listen to the voice of the citizens, 
who are telling us we are not doing things right. We must make a 
course change, and we are doing that, among other things, 
accepting the need for a clear profile and a definite message of 
change. 
  [Mercado] Will the message of change involve urging people 
to 
cast blank ballots in case there is a second round of voting and 
you do not make the cut? 
  [Navarro] If I agreed with the idea of casting blank 
ballots, 
I would not have entered the race for the presidency of the 
Republic. 
  Casting blank ballots is faceless, ownerless; if it had an 
owner, it would not be a blank ballot. I think it is simply a 
passive position. 
  [Mercado] Are you willing to negotiate with Samper or 
Pastrana in the second round, if you are defeated in the first? 
Are your votes endorsable? 
  [Navarro] We have free and secret balloting, and people 
decide how they are going to vote. The decision regarding a 
possible agreement will have to be made by the people 
accompanying me in that process, not by me. 
  What I can state categorically is that the commitments we 
have signed with more than 200 municipalities will be honored. 
  If anyone can fulfill them, they will be fulfilled. After 
that, the decision we make will be absolutely clear. 
  [Mercado] What is the message that came through to you the 
loudest after the recent electoral defeat? 
  [Navarro] That of Orlando Fals Borda. He called me and told 
me, "Antonio, you have a duty to show some balls. Stick to your 
guns." 
  [Mercado] Are you not afraid that AD/M-19 will cease to 
exist? 
  [Navarro] I think no one ceases to exist here. The Popular 
National Alliance (ANAPO) revived after 20 years; the 
Revolutionary Independent Worker Movement (MOIR) won a 
senatorial seat; the Communist Party is still alive, in spite of 
thousands of deaths. 
  I am certain that AD will remain alive. What we must 
understand, in my view, is that we have to go into the local 
elections with a lot of strength. 
  [Mercado] But you said that AD had gotten confused engaging 
in traditional politics. Are you a traditional politician? 
  [Navarro] I am not even a politician in the sense that most 
people understand the term; much less traditional. I shun that. 
I prefer any other barbarity. 
  [Mercado] What room do you think is left for the guerrillas 
and the peace processes, now that a demobilized group has been 
defeated so thoroughly? 
  [Navarro] I think that peace is still good, beneficial, 
necessary, and that whether or not we have a seat in the Senate, 
we in the AD are still at peace. I think we cannot turn our 
backs on peace just because we suffered a defeat.

<F P=106> [Interview with Conservative Party vice presidential </F>
candidate Luis Fernando Ramirez by Carlos Murcia; place and date 
not given; first paragraph is EL ESPECTADOR introduction] 
  [Text] The fight between the Samper-De la Calle and the 
Pastrana-Ramirez Acuna tickets is now set. As a good 
Santanderean, former minister Luis Fernando Ramirez does not 
avoid confrontation. It was said of him that he was fine as a 
government official, but as a politician he brought nothing to 
candidate Andres Pastrana. In just a few hours he managed to 
disprove that. One thing he said in this interview will 
certainly draw fire: "Samper was disloyal to President Gaviria 
when he was in the government...." 
  [Murcia] The Samper people are still saying that you are 
ineligible. What is your response? 
  [Ramirez] Concerning my supposed political ineligibility, I 
repeat that they are mistaken. The Council of State settled that 
in response to a query from the minister of government on 10 
June 1993, when it categorically stated that having been a 
member of a ministerial cabinet or a government official creates 
no legal bar to being vice president. There is no such 
ineligibility for the vice president or the president. 
  [Murcia] Horacio Serpa says that you could not become 
president as you were a government official until last Saturday. 
  [Ramirez] That contradicts the position of the Council of 
State. In terms of ineligibility, analogies can not be applied. 
The Constitution lists a single cause of ineligibility for the 
vice presidency: he must not have served as vice president 
during the preceding term. 
  [Murcia] Why do you think your ticket is better than the 
liberal ticket of Samper and De la Calle? 
  [Ramirez] We represent the future, they the past. In our 
case, there is unity of views, identity of platforms. We did not 
have to give up our principles or our platforms for electoral 
purposes. Our program has great credibility and viability, 
especially for voters who, in past elections, when they looked 
at the ballot and saw Samper and De la Calle, decided to stay 
home. 
  [Murcia] Why did you agree so quickly when they called you 
early Saturday morning and offered you the candidacy? 
  [Ramirez] Despite my state of mind because of my father's 
kidnapping, I made the decision after talking it over with 
Andres Pastrana and the campaign team, for we have a strong 
commitment to Colombia. We represent a young but experienced 
ticket. I have worked on the economic and social reforms of the 
recent governments with both President Gaviria and President 
Barco. I know the program that best suits Colombia in this 
second phase, and that is the platform of Andres Pastrana. It 
seems a good opportunity for me to continue to serve the nation. 
  [Murcia] It is said that you are not a politician in this 
campaign. 
  [Ramirez] I believe that explains the very high abstention 
rates. People are tired of the traditional politician who is in 
a state of constant contradiction and in search of political 
compromises, so that he has to sacrifice a government program. 
People wonder if in the future those who acted like that will 
not again place their personal interests ahead of the nation's 
interests. In our case, the ticket does not reflect a political 
compromise but rather an identity of views and a cohesion of 
ideas and a shared commitment to the nation. It was not put 
together for purely electoral purposes. 
  [Murcia] Why a conservative and not a liberal for the 
Pastrana ticket? 
  [Ramirez] The Andres Pastrana and Luis Fernando Ramirez 
ticket is for all Colombians, not just for conservatives. With 
this ticket, we call upon liberals, conservatives, independents, 
and especially those who did not take part in the liberal 
primary because they found no program there that was viable for 
Colombia in the 21st century. I believe a liberal could have 
been chosen for the vice presidency, but the politicians' 
mistake is believing that people still vote in response to party 
labels. The people can see that ours is a platform aimed toward 
the future. 
  [Murcia] Why do Samper and De la Calle not offer 
credibility? 
  [Ramirez] The people are very concerned about the 
differences 
between Samper and De la Calle. Dr. De la Calle had been saying 
that Samper had placed a car bomb on the social security 
program, and then overnight he joined forces with the 
"carbomber." The Colombian people fear that in the government 
the same differences that arose between Samper and Gaviria might 
recur between Samper and De la Calle. 
  [Murcia] Are you suggesting that Samper was a "fifth 
columnist" inside the government? 
  [Ramirez] There is no doubt that he was a "fifth columnist." 
All of Gaviria's reforms were made against Samper's opposition. 
Economic liberalization, social security, even the foreign trade 
reform. He certainly was not very loyal when he was in the 
government. That is what people fear might happen with a Samper 
government, that De la Calle might apply the same medicine, 
because their platforms are not the same. They have already 
showed their true colors, and it does not bother them to alter 
their platforms in order to work out a political deal. You 
wonder if, when they have to choose between what is best for the 
nation and what is best for them, they might not choose the 
second alternative. 
  [Murcia] You were a key player during the debates in 
Congress 
on the social security and pension system reform. Will that help 
you or hurt you in the campaign--with the workers, for example? 
  [Ramirez] I think President Gaviria himself answered that 
question when he said it is the most important social reform 
Colombia has had in the last 50 years. That is a guarantee that 
in the Pastrana government program, social policy will occupy a 
leading place. 
  [Murcia] Do you think this is the right time to hold public 
debates, with frankness, on the platforms of one ticket or 
another? 
  [Ramirez] I believe it is best for the country if we present 
our platforms so we can see which campaign has internal 
differences and which is consistent, with united views. We are 
ready for those debates.

<F P=106> [Article by Angel Paez of the Research Unit] </F>
  [Text] In publications signed by the Sol Peru Committee in 
Paris, Esparza Marquez or "Comrade Enrique" issues a merciless 
attack on the Shining Path [SL] cells headed by Adolfo Olaechea 
Cahuas and Luis Arce Borja which, from abroad, refuse to accept 
the negotiations between SL leader Abimael Guzman and the 
government. 
  In his book, SL: The World's Most Lethal Subversive 
Movement, British reporter Simon Strong interviews "Comrade 
Enrique" several times. He says: "Guzman believes he is the most 
reliable militant in Europe." It was he who in 1986 received 
Guzman's order to organize cells in 26 European cities. 
  Adolfo Olaechea, chief of the Sol Peru Committee in London, 
who is in direct contact with LA REPUBLICA, said: "Esparza 
Marquez has been against the people's war since 1980, he even 
asked for pardon from the party and President Gonzalo for his 
opposition to the war." 
  Olaechea's comments contrasts with what Simon Strong saw and 
verified. 
  Strong says in his book that "Comrade Enrique" belongs "to 
the cream (of the SL community in Stockholm, Sweden). He belongs 
to the family of Augusta de la Torre whose best brain is 
`Enrique.' He is a soft-spoken handsome man who receives the 
respect a mature school director should get." 
  Strong states that Esparza Marquez (who only identifies 
himself as "Enrique" for security reasons) arrived in Sweden in 
November 1982 "after an apparent rupture with Abimael Guzman." 
After "writing a repentance letter" to his sister-in-law's 
husband, he received instructions to start SL cells in Europe. 
  Later "Comrade Enrique" obtained Guzman's attention and was 
appointed PCP-SL [Peruvian Communist Party-SL] representative to 
the managing committee of the International Revolutionary 
Movement, MRI, which groups Maoists communists worldwide. 
  Adolfo Olaechea maintains that Esparza Marquez is more like 
the leader of a movement that negotiates with representatives of 
the Alberto Fujimori administration in exchange for personal 
benefits. 
  Olaechea notes: "Opportunistic individuals infiltrated in 
the 
Peruvian revolutionary support movement (...), and seek 
arrangements with Fujimori against the interests of the Peruvian 
people in exchange for personal favors, (this) does not weaken 
but rather strengthens the revolution (...)." He adds: "The fact 
that Mr. Esparza and an insignifcant group have become 
Fujimori's mouthpiece abroad and have published a bulletin 
entitled `SOL PERU,' can only cause temporary confusion." 
  But the most serious accusation by Adolfo Olaechea Cahuas, 
who in 1991 organized the Sol Peru Committee in London precisely 
at Comrade Enrique's request, is that Esparza Marquez phones 
Abimael Guzman Reinoso with the approval of the Alberto Fujimori 
adminsitration to expedite the negotiations. 
  According to Olaechea this has been admitted by Esparza 
Marquez himself: "By his own admission, Mr. Esparza has been in 
direct telephone contact for several months with `President 
Gonzalo' with the approval, support, and facilities provided by 
courtesy of Mr. Fujimori and his advisor (Vladimiro) Montesinos 
(Torres)." 
  In his contact with "LA REPUBLICA," Olaechea adds that "Mr. 
Esparza is obviously illegally representing Dr. Guzman. He is 
negotiating but he is also disregarding and overlooking the PCP 
central committee." 
  In a "Sol Peru Committee" bulletin issued in Paris, Esparza 
refers to Luis Arce Borja and Adolfo Olaechia Cahuas. He states 
that those who oppose the Peace Agreement are "opportunists and 
alleged `supporters' of the people's war that is entrenched in 
Europe.'" 
  According to "Comrade Enrique" and his followers, the 
letters 
issued by Guzman and the Canto Grande inmates are proof enough 
of the PCP-SL's willingness to achieve a Peace Agreement: "They 
are now unable to shout out that 2,500 PCP war criminals are 
`crazy,' `drugged,' that they have made statements `under 
pressure,' or less still that they have `joined the Fujimori 
administration.' They will have to bite their dirty tongues and 
swallow the filthy abominations they have said." 
  Esparza Marquez is undoubtedly referring to the cells led by 
Olaechia and Arce, the director of EL DIARIO INTERNACIONAL that 
is published in Brussels. 
  But Olaechea--who notes that he and Arce Borja think 
alike--says: "It does not matter if certain individuals, 
including certain prisoners described by the regime as `SL 
members,' have signed letters supporting the negotiations. This 
has little relevance because the war continues to be conducted 
by the PCP central committee." 
  Olaechea says: "Under the leadership of the PCP central 
committee" not "of President Gonzalo," thus implying that he is 
questioning Guzman's "leadership." 
  Olaechea states: "It is wrong to allege that Olaechea and 
Arce Borja say that `the dialogue does not exist.'" He adds: 
"What is out of the question is a pointless dialogue with the 
turncoat dictatorship that is oppressing and massacring the 
people." 
  The London Sol Peru Committee leader said: "It is necessary 
to unmask the false negotiations between the regime and the gang 
of traitors [felipillos] headed by Esparza" which will fail 
"despite the millions of lies they tell President Gonzalo in an 
endless litany." 
  Luis Arce Borja and Adolfo Olaechea--the spokesmen in Europe 
of the SL sector that does not believe in dialogue with the 
government and even less in a Peace Agreement--have stated that 
"the victory of the people's war is irreversible," and that no 
"plot" or "fabrications" will weaken it. 
  Olaechea does not believe his differences of opinion with 
Esparza Marquez--who controls cells in Sweden, France, Spain, 
the United States, the Netherlands, Denmark, and other 
countries--constitute a division of the PCP-SL abroad. 
  Olaechea Cahuas believes the SL "is developing the Sixth 
Great Military Plan which seeks to prepare for a strategic 
offensive that will culminate in the seizing of power 
nationwide." He asserts: "Javier Esparza's adventures, the 
letters of this prisoner and the others who either cannot or 
simply will not continue to fight, and the speculations about 
Fujimori's farce, are of little importance, and their only 
objective is to confuse and deceive the credulous." 
  Incredibly, Olaechea minimizes the obvious and overwhelming 
differences between the two groups. 
  Olaechea states: "Fujimori's fabrication died a natural 
death 
a long time ago." He adds: "His efforts to revive it by trying 
to agitate the destitute, with Esparza's complicity, is 
temporary. This will be demonstrated shortly." 
  Javier Esparza Marquez, "Comrade Enrique," is married to 
Abimael Guzman's late wife's sister. He is persistently 
described as the Peruvian Government's puppet to divide SL. 
  Esparza Marquez lives in Sweden. He is one of "the 
ambassadors of terror" who faces extradition along with his 
wife, Gisella La Torre Carrasco, and her brothers, Boris and 
Carlos--Abimael Guzman's brothers in law. 
  Olaechea states: "Fujimori and his adviser Montesinos are 
involved in trafficking in lies and bribing the submissive in an 
effort to divide Peruvian revolutionaries." He adds: "He thus 
resorted to Javier Esparza Marquez, the husband of Doctor 
Guzman's late wife's sister." 
  In his communique, Olaechea explains that the Sol Peru 
Committee in Paris is not led by Maximiliano Duran Araujo, 
brother of the outlawed Teresa, the Central Committee leader and 
wife of Osman Morote Barrionuevo. 
  Duran Araujo has been living in Paris for the last decade. 
He 
was constantly attacked by EL DIARIO INTERNACIONAL for 
"trafficking with the people's war and usurping the name of the 
party." 
  A nuclear energy expert, Duran Araujo spreads SL propaganda, 
but in his own style. Olaechea said: "In spite of other 
disagreements, it must be stated that Maximiliano Duran is not 
part of this fabrication." 
  In a sort of show of force, Esparza Marquez includes in the 
Sol Peru Committee bulletin statements by other Maoist 
organizations in favor of the Peace Agreement, including that of 
the political bureau of Mexico's Revolutionary Communist Union, 
UCR. 
  Esparza Marquez charges Olaechea, Arce, and their followers 
with disavowing Abimael Guzman as the "PCP chief" (please note 
that they refer to the "Central Committee directorate," which is 
currently commanded by Oscar Ramirez Durand), and with 
distributing false party documents. He makes the following 
threat: 
  "They are spreading despicable concoctions, which have 
unveiled their atrocious ambitions as counterrevolutionary 
gangs, and have devised plans to destroy the PCP's work abroad." 
"Comrade Enrique" states in his publication: "By imitating 
perverse assassins, they are making accusations. The blood debts 
caused by these despicable actions will never be forgotten. No 
matter where they may try to hide, the party's iron hand will 
fall on them." 
  Blood is not precisely a game among Shining Path members. 
  Those who are against the Peace Agreement have showered 
threats on their comrades who support an understanding with the 
regime: They have promised to reduce them "to a few black ashes."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Why Weaken DINCOTE?"] </F>
  [Text] On 3 February, the National Police Headquarters 
ordered the transfer of 200 policemen from the National 
Counterterrorism Directorate (DINCOTE) to other police units. 
According to a statement made by the PNP's [Peruvian National 
Police] general director, Victor Alva Plasencia, this measure is 
being applied in a general context of police reorganization, and 
is not limited to the DINCOTE. 
  Nevertheless, there are indications that the changes in the 
DINCOTE are attributable to a higher political realm, in which 
not even President Alberto Fujimori himself holds all the 
decision-making power. 
  According to unofficial information, the DINCOTE has five 
police units called Deltas, each of which has approximately 35 
members and is under orders from a commander. Their task is to 
support the intelligence work and the operations planned on the 
directorate levels. 
  Concurrently, there is the Special Intelligence Group 
(GEIN), 
engaged in intelligence work per se, and constructing and 
refining its own data base in order to track the leading 
suspects. On a certain occasion, the GEIN was divided into one 
group devoted to SL [Shining Path] and another devoted to the 
MRTA [Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement]. 
  There are also the BREDET, initials designating the brigades 
that follow up reports frequently provided by the public on 
suspected houses or persons. 
  The work of a DINCOTE member is quite arduous. Officers and 
some of the subordinate personnel often work for consecutive 
periods lasting 12 or 16 hours a day. Moreover, on many 
occasions their stint lasts 24 hours, because of the proximity 
of an operation. 
  Despite the intense work and the constant danger to which 
each member of the operative groups is exposed, he is not 
compensated monetarily. 
  For example, a captain's pay is from 400 to 450 soles 
($215), 
not counting the amount deducted. A junior officer, on the other 
hand, earns approximately 300 soles ($140). 
  A DINCOTE operative member, among those stationed for hours 
to spy on a suspect, receives 5 soles of per diem for his entire 
long work assignment. 
  Recently, the DINCOTE personnel had a pay cut. At the end of 
January, their annual bonus for hazardous work was reduced. 
According to one official, this occurred despite the fact that 
the budget allocated to the DINCOTE for 1993 had included this 
extra income. 
  Two days before they were to receive the bonus, the agents 
were informed of a 70 percent reduction in the incentive bonus. 
Hence, if an officer was supposed to receive 225 soles, he was 
given only 65 new soles; whereas a junior officer, who would 
have received 160 more than his salary, earned only 40 soles. 
  According to members of this institution, until General 
Ketin 
Vidal's administration, "the DINCOTE was far more compact, and 
the entire group's motivation was sustained. There were no 
objections when it was necessary to engage in any operation." 
Furthermore, the operative members had a certain amount of 
autonomy for carrying out their missions, without lapsing into a 
mechanical job. Now, the situation in the DINCOTE reportedly has 
deteriorated in all these respects. There are fewer resources 
for operations, and there is more inflexibility in the 
instructions. 
  The National Intelligence Service's [SIN] excessive 
interference in the management of operations and personnel has 
become another debatable feature of the present-day DINCOTE. 
  Two copies of every case file or record prepared in the 
DINCOTE must be submitted to the SIN, without any reciprocity 
implied. Some officers criticize what they claim to be the 
unwillingness shown by the chiefs, including their present 
general director, to defend their own decision-making power, 
unlike what was typical of them until December 1992. 
  Some of the SIN's intervention in the DINCOTE is backed by 
legal regulations stipulating that the SIN shall receive the 
support of qualified forces so long as it lacks the necessary 
personnel. 
  However, that support to the SIN is now becoming a virtual 
decapitation of the DINCOTE. Recently, the "Sunday Review" news 
program on television Channel 4 announced the transfer of 14 
DINCOTE officers, including lieutenants, captains, majors, and 
colonels, to the SIN. Nevertheless, the number of officers 
transferred is said to be even higher. 
  Among those transferred to the SIN is a colonel who, 
according to very well-informed sources, was the real director 
of the investigations making it possible to capture Abimael 
Guzman and scores of other Shining Path leaders. Another 
colonel, the principal expert in the investigations of the MRTA, 
was transferred to a province in late 1993. 
  Moreover, nearly 90 percent of the total personnel 
transferred to the SIN were members of the Delta and Special 
Intelligence (GEIN) groups. The other 10 percent are assimilated 
or administrative personnel. 
  The objective no longer seems to be merely to obtain 
support, 
but rather to expropriate intelligence from the DINCOTE, so as 
to put its best investigators under the direct control of 
military intelligence. The particular goal would be to put them 
under the command of Vladimiro Montesinos, President Fujimori's 
principal adviser on the subject of subversion, and one of the 
SIN's preeminent spokesmen. 
  Now then, the following question is fitting: Why reinforce 
military intelligence so much, at the cost of debilitating the 
DINCOTE, which has been the state's real mainstay for repressing 
subversion? Furthermore, why do so in a situation wherein 
subversion is plummeting? 
  The most plausible, and perhaps also the most suspicious 
response is that such personnel will be assigned to other 
investigations dissociated from the countersubversive types. 
With the SL decline, other adversaries are taking priority: 
others to be located, checked, and neutralized. 
  The drug traffic? If that were the target aimed at, the 
DINANDRO [National Police Counternarcotics Directorate] should 
have been the unit reinforced with ex-DINCOTE personnel. Or, in 
any event, the SIN would have requested DINANDRO rather than 
DINCOTE officers to reinforce it in this mission. 
  The military and civilian opposition? Therein lies the 
explanation. There is no doubt that the La Cantuta case, the 
leaks to the press of classified information provided by the 
Comaca or Leon Dormido groups, and the charges by certain 
officials of generals' being implicated in the drug traffic are 
becoming the main factor in the erosion of the current military 
commanders and of the government itself. 
  Hence, one of the adversaries, possibly the principal one, 
that should be targeted, is the military opposition. The other 
is the civilian opposition which, as the electoral period 
approaches, will be as dangerous as the dissidents in uniform, 
or more so. 
  The problem is that three processes detrimental to the 
country's democratic order are implicit in all this: the 
subordination of the armed institutions to the government's 
particular political interest; the military control of the major 
police units; and the weakening of the DINCOTE when the Shining 
Path terrorist adventure has not yet been totally stifled. 
  On the other hand, what the country's general interest 
requires is the same as what befits forces of order with a 
democratic inclination and professional excellence: submission 
to the law, clear demarcation of military and police 
jurisdictions, and genuine recognition for the merit of the 
police units performing their duty.

  [Text] Official sources told EL OBSERVADOR that the 
government will soon undertake a "deep reorganization of the 
foreign service," promote the merger of the Foreign Ministry 
with the Foreign Trade Directorate, and emphasize the position 
of itinerant ambassador. 
  President Lacalle said in Rome that Mercosur [Common Market 
of the South] countries need to contact a public relations firm 
in Europe and the United States to make the region known abroad. 
  Regarding the foreign service's reform, the sources said 
changes are needed in order to gain "efficiency and more 
dynamism," adding that the present structures do not help create 
an effective presence for the country abroad. 
  The sources said the presence of a permanent ambassador is 
necessary in countries like Italy, Spain, or France, adding that 
the diplomatic coverage of countries like Poland could be made 
through an area ambassador who might even reside in Uruguay. 
That ambassador could be informed by agents in the respective 
countries and then schedule regular and efficient visits. 
  The sources said the new system will permit an important 
reduction of costs in residences, and the money could be used to 
raise the salaries of diplomats living in Montevideo, whose 
incomes are usually lower than when they are abroad. 
  President Lacalle, as well as Foreign Minister Abreu, have 
spoken in the past about the need to reform the foreign service. 
The minister even insisted that the service's economic and 
commercial character should be emphasized.

<F P=106> [Article by Enrique Etchevarren in Europe] </F>
  [Text] Rome -- "Within 48 hours I will have had the 
opportunity of meeting the two most famous Poles, you and the 
pope." This was said by Uruguayan President Luis Alberto Lacalle 
when he met Polish President Lech Walesa. 
  During the morning of his last day in Warsaw and a few hours 
before departing for Rome, Lacalle met Walesa in Belvedere 
Palace, seat of the Polish Government, and told Walesa that 
Uruguay is the gateway to the potentially rich Common Market of 
the South (Mercosur). 
  The meeting between the two chiefs of state included such 
topics as the current European equilibrium and the possible 
development of events in the former Soviet Union's republics and 
the EC, in which Poland wishes to become a member. 
  Lacalle told the media after the meeting that he had had the 
opportunity to exchange ideas with Walesa, whom he termed "a 
fighter against communism who to a large measure allowed the 
political, social, and economic opening of East Europe." 
  Lacalle told Walesa that Uruguay is the natural gateway for 
entering Mercosur, and he added that although the bloc will 
compete in attracting capital, he was very impressed with the 
position of the Polish president, who considers Latin America to 
be the continent of the future. 
  The Uruguayan president invited Walesa to visit our country 
during the course of a scheduled Latin American trip, which 
still does not have a fixed date. 
  Asked by the media accompanying him about Poland's internal 
situation, Lacalle said: "It is very difficult to change a 
country in one day after 50 years of communism and socialism, 
which are the type of regimes that can do less for the happiness 
of the people, the promotion of investment, and the distribution 
of wealth." 
  He added that Walesa and his advisers told him that they 
have 
started to form a new class of business leaders who can make the 
country competitive. 
  Diplomatic sources told EL PAIS that even within the midst 
of 
a difficult political crisis, Poland has been pointed out as the 
country that has had the best recovery in East Europe. 
  With an economic growth of 4 percent in 1993 and an internal 
market of 40 million people, the Poles are receiving heavy 
investment from basically West European enterprises. 
  Moreover, the economic reform's slowness has led to an 
unstable political situation in which Walesa has lost his 
majority in Parliament and has to live with a cabinet dominated 
by post-communists. 
  The electoral support of Marx's inheritors is interpreted by 
Warsaw as a natural reaction by the middle class Pole in the 
face of the new conditions of an open economy. Basically, 
unemployment, which is now at 15 percent and was unknown in a 
planned economy, has hit the Poles hard. Moreover, no one doubts 
that returning to the past is impossible and that the freedom 
reconquered after 50 years of dependence on the former USSR is 
not in danger. 
  Anyway, the confrontation between Walesa and the 
post-communist government, which found an ally in the Peasants 
Party that has always traditionally favored Marxism, has had its 
first effect: to stop the rapid process of privatizations.

  [Text] President Rafael Caldera has emphasized that 
constitutional amendments must include provisions for an 
impeachment referendum, that is, the possibility that people 
could impeach any government official, including the president, 
who fails to perform his duties. He made these statements at the 
opening of a play called "Venezuela, Political Crisis, and 
Constitutional Reforms." He also said that participative 
democracy must be the main aspect of the amendments to ensure 
that people will have a say in the nation's important 
sociopolitical issues. He also rejected all doubts that the 
community will not be able to understand the amendments due to 
the large number of articles. 
  [Begin Caldera recording] People will not discuss the 
amendments article by article; they will merely reply yes or no, 
as is done in every democratic country. They will ratify or 
reject the amendments drafted by the National Congress. [end 
recording] 
  He also said that it is necessary to give the Venezuelan 
people a greater opportunity to participate and more power in 
view of the situation the country is currently experiencing.
