<F P=106> [Article by Adela Leal] </F>
  [Text] Interior Minister Ramon Escovar Salom told the 
Permanent Secretariat of the National Council for Defense and 
Security [Seconasede] on 12 April the flow of illegal aliens, 
drug trafficking, and transculturation constitute the greatest 
threats to national security. Regarding the flow of illegal 
aliens, Escovar said the "first problem" that must be tackled to 
solve the illegal aliens problem is the Sectorial General 
Directorate of Identification and Control of Foreigners [Diex], 
which must be revamped. 
  Escovar made this statement at the opening of the First 
Round 
of Conferences on Security and Defense, organized by Seconasede, 
which is being held on 12, 13, and 14 April. Escovar and other 
prominent individuals are scheduled to participate at this 
meeting. 
  During his speech, Escovar mentioned the subject of 
Venezuela: its political situation and effects on security and 
defense. Escovar said, among other things, national security and 
defense have several serious and complex problems. The first 
problem is the need to control the undetermined number of 
illegal aliens in the country, a situation that creates several 
problems. 
  He conceded there are irregularities regarding the 
identification of foreigners. Many of these irregularities have 
long existed and have done the country much harm. He said 
emphatically Diex constitutes the first problem that must be 
tackled. "That is what I am doing," he said categorically. 
<H5>  Transculturation </H5>
  In countries, such as Venezuela, weakened and troubled by 
foreign debt, corruption, and disorganization, it is not enough 
to invoke patriotic emblems and sing the national anthem when 
referring to national sovereignty, but it is also necessary to 
understand more profound aspects that affect sovereignty. 
  In this respect, Escovar said in addition to the 
above-mentioned problems the country is threatened by the drug 
problem, an unusual and highly dangerous one. Drugs and its 
geopolitical ramifications have brought a new element to the 
situation which, according to Escovar, has a nullifying effect 
on society, its health and morals. Escovar warned that is the 
scenario and those are the new actors. 
  Regarding transculturation, which seriously harms our 
sovereignty, he said it reaches Venezuelans via satellite dishes 
and the media. 
<H5>  Political Reforms </H5>
  Concerning reforms, he said the inclusion of the referendum 
on impeachment must be one of the fundamental aspects to be 
discussed during the discussion on constitutional reform, 
scheduled to take place at Congress within the next few days. 
  "I do not think it is the only reform the country is 
demanding, but in political matters the referendum on 
impeachment is fundamental in making in-depth changes in 
Venezuelan society," he said. 
  In this regard he said the country is anxious to 
relegitimize 
the system, which is "evidently losing legitimacy." At this 
moment, he said, the discussion of constitutional reforms left 
pending by the previous Congress is being accelerated. There is 
a fundamental element, however, if we want to make a true 
change, which is to incorporate citizens into the decisionmaking 
process. This can only be achieved via a referendum.

<F P=106> [Article by Armando J. Pernia] </F>
  [Text] Ministry of Finance adviser Jose Igancio Moreno Leon 
said yesterday that 3 percent of the revenues from the new taxes 
will be devoted to financing a new autonomous tax collection 
agency, with the aim of curbing the serious tax evasion problem, 
since with current taxes the treasury could obtain double the 
resources if a "new tax consciousness" is created. 
  Moreno Leon participated in a conversation, organized by the 
Central Information Office, with the economic editors of the 
different media outlets in order to explain the basic lines of 
the economic policy of President Caldera's administration. 
  The official pointed out that the center of the growth 
strategy is achieving a voluntary consensus agreement in which 
all sectors would agree on establishing voluntary controls on 
prices, the exchange rate, and business profit margins. 
  This agreement includes changing the system of workers' 
benefits to adopt the Chilean model; that is, creating pension 
funds administered by their own financial system. This will 
permit the state to pay the 350-billion-bolivar debt it owes the 
Pension and Retirement Fund. 
  "The idea is that the workers should have savings with good 
earnings, but without generating cash-flow problems for the 
companies due to the retroactive nature of the benefits," Moreno 
Leon explained. 
  According to the government's financial adviser, the 
administration's major effort is focused on trying to reduce the 
400-billion-bolivar deficit which is expected for this year as a 
result of overestimating oil income by 105 billion bolivars; oil 
prices were calculated at $15.50 per barrel and are now very 
unlikely to reach $12. 
  This is the justification for the tax on bank transactions 
and the reform of the Income Tax Law. "We really are not 
creating new taxes, except in the case of the bank transactions, 
because the sales tax replaces the VAT [value-added tax]. 
However, by modernizing the management of spending, we will 
achieve that goal." 
  According to what Moreno Leon said, tax administration is 
really in a bad way, since Venezuela is among the 10 countries 
with the lowest collection of taxes in the world, at the level 
of Uganda, due to the evasion associated with corruption. Thus, 
he stressed that the salaries of finance officials should be 
increased, the laws should be "ironclad" so that there would be 
no room for evasion, and those who do not pay taxes should be 
harshly punished with prison terms, "since that attitude is 
comparable to a crime against the public patrimony." 
  He announced the creation of an Institute of Advanced 
Studies 
that will make it possible to train professional officials in 
tax management with a true awareness of the role they fulfill. 
  The proposed modification of the Tax Code states, for 
example, that if a taxpayer is challenged and his guilt is 
shown, he should serve a prison term and pay the tax, a fine, 
and additional interest for the delay. On this point, Moreno 
denounced as unheard of the decision of the National Racetrack 
Institute executives not to turn over to the treasury more than 
3 billion bolivars resulting from a tax on bettors' winnings, 
"in order to continue to finance their administration which has 
been inefficient and possibly corrupt." 
  With respect to the position of COPEI [Social Christian 
Party] on the Special Powers Law proposed by AD [Democratic 
Action], on not authorizing the approval by the executive branch 
of the income tax reform due to the elimination of exemptions, 
Moreno Leon replied that meetings have been held to explain the 
matter to the COPEI technical experts. 
  "I have arguments to show that the elimination of the 
exemptions is just, because those who benefitted from that 
indiscriminate system were the large taxpayers and not the small 
ones. That is why we have set a minimum exoneration limit of up 
to 750,000 bolivars in income," Moreno Leon explained. 
  In sum, the government's aim is to lower inflation to 30 
percent, and this would bring a reduction in the interest rates 
and stabilization of the exchange rate, based on a general 
agreement that would not be like the Mexican one, imposed by one 
party, but would come from the necessary consensus of everyone 
in the face of the crisis, one would hope.

  [Excerpts] The Honduran Armed Forces want to break the 
Military Assistance Treaty signed in 1954 with the U.S. 
Government because they believe the treaty is obsolete and is no 
longer of any benefit to the nation. 
  The above was reported by CNN international, which also said 
that the presence of U.S. troops in Latin America continues to 
cause problems for some nations of the region. [passage omitted] 
  When questioned about the issue, President Carlos Roberto 
Reina commented: "We should study the issue and see if this 
installation can benefit Honduras and our new agenda." 
  To end the treaty, the CNN report concluded, is the 
prerogative of the president. Meanwhile, the Armed Forces are 
trying to obtain the support of civilians to achieve their goal.

  [Text] Quilali -- The demobilization of the last 3-80 
Northern Front [FN 3-80] contingent in Quilali yesterday marked 
the beginning of the most difficult phase of the northern 
region's peace process. All sectors agreed, however, that this 
phase is part of the fulfillment of the peace agreement. 
  Sergio Caramagna, director of the OAS International 
Commission of Support and Verification [CIAV-OAS], spoke to LA 
PRENSA about specific points of the agreement and said that 
"this is where the hard part begins." 
  The Catholic Church, leaders of the FN 3-80, and even the 
government agree with that assessment. Government Minister 
Alfredo Mendieta addressed the FN 3-80 troops and said that "if 
it was hard to achieve peace, it will be even harder to maintain 
it." 
  Some 300 FN 3-80 fighters surrendered their weapons to the 
government at 1700 at the city's baseball stadium, located about 
287 km northeast of Managua, in an effort to end the conflict 
that has killed no less than 600 people. 
  The main points of the agreement between the government and 
the FN 3-80, which is now entering politics, call for security, 
land, and financial aid to begin production. They also call for 
the creation of a development region where the government has 
agreed to make specific investments. 
  According to Byron Alegria, deputy chief of the Nicaraguan 
Agrarian Reform Institute, the government has kept its part of 
the land bargain. 
  "We have granted all kinds of facilities for the demobilized 
rebels to acquire lands that were mortgaged to government 
banks," Byron explained. He added that "there are about 4,000 
manzanas that can be used for cattle ranching or for growing 
coffee and grain." 
  Land has already been selected for coffee production, and 
according to Alegria, some 300 people will begin work tomorrow. 
The farm will have its own electricity plant and three 
separator machines. Another 100 people will join the work in 
May, and there will be work for about 800 people during the 
harvest. 
  Next Monday the Education Ministry will appoint 22 teachers 
to work at the new schools in Quilali and nearby towns, a 
measure that is also part of the peace agreements. 
  About 600 demobilized FN 3-80 fighters are expected. Some 
100 rebels surrendered their weapons during the first phase of 
the disarmament process on 2 March. 
  Another 150 rebels surrendered their weapons on 8 April 
during the second disarmament phase, and on 15 April, El Chacal 
and another 300 militants finally ended the FN 3-80 
demobilization process. Only 50 militants remain armed to 
provide security for the demobilized rebels. 
  The government has concluded the police instruction program 
offered to 74 FN 3-80 members at the Police Academy. These 
future policemen eventually will be responsible for providing 
security for the demobilized rebels. 
  The Sandinist People's Army reportedly will withdraw its 
soldiers from Quilali. Several trucks reportedly arrived in 
Quilali to remove the soldiers of the First Northern Military 
Command, which operated in that area. 
  El Chacal surrendered two Redeye missiles and a Sam-7 
missile 
to the government at the demobilization ceremony. 
  Two U.S. Embassy officials who attended the disarmament 
ceremony asked for the immediate destruction of the missiles, 
but the Special Disarmament Brigade was not prepared to blow 
them up. 
  The FN 3-80 weapons were destroyed in a hole dug for that 
purpose.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with President Carlos Menem by </F>
journalists Roberto Guareschi, Ricardo Kirschbaum, Alcadio Ona, 
and Julio Blanck at his office in Government House on 14 April] 
  [Excerpts] [CLARIN] How do you assess the results of the 
[10 April Constituent Assembly members] elections? 
  [Menem] What was the goal? We must start by asking ourselves 
what was our goal concerning the 10 April elections: The 
constitutional reform. This goal is underway. An overwhelming 
victory, virtually in the entire Republic, has been achieved, 
even though an attempt was made to downgrade this victory by 
emphasizing a defeat in the federal capital. Look at Buenos 
Aires Province: Even though the percentage who voted for 
Justicialism dropped a bit, it is the first time in history that 
Justicialism has won 121 of the 127 districts. In Santa Fe 
Province, for example, it is the first time Justicialism won all 
19 districts. The same happened in La Rioja Province and other 
provinces.... Granted, the number of votes dropped. This may 
have been caused by this sort of dispersion in which two other 
parties, the Grand Front [FG] and MODIN [Movement for Dignity 
and Independence], appeared with a certain strength. 
Nevertheless, Justicialism obviously achieved excellent results. 
We achieved victory. Add up the UCR [Radical Civic Union], FG, 
and MODIN Constituent Assembly members, and you will see they do 
not reach the number of Justicialism Constituent Assembly 
members, namely 138. 
  [CLARIN] Mr. President, this fourth consecutive electoral 
victory for you and Justicialism represents an unprecedented 
record. Nevertheless, you will agree that the federal capital 
represents a sort of political showcase in our country and 
events in the federal capital have strong repercussions. 
  [Menem] The capital is represented by 27 out of 305 
Constituent Assembly members. 
  [CLARIN] What is your explanation for the defeat of Peronism 
in the capital? 
  [Menem] Voters in the capital are wayward and demanding. I 
don't know why, but this waywardness has occurred since the 
federal capital was founded. Socialism, headed by Alfredo 
Palacios, won here once. I could attribute the electoral result 
in the federal capital to a very good performance by the FG 
leaders, but also to the waywardness of the federal capital 
voters. [passage omitted] 
  [CLARIN] Do you agree with the polls that say that the main 
reason for voting for the FG was that the people believed there 
had to be an opposition? 
  [Menem] There are many factors. This may be one. The 
floods, caused by the heavy rain in the capital, was another 
reason. This soured the people's mood. The people tend to 
blame the incumbent president rather than what has been going on 
for many years.... The scandals, prompted by reports on 
corruption within the PAMI [Comprehensive Medical Assistance 
Plan], may, also have had an impact; no doubt. There are many 
factors. 
  [CLARIN] This may be an explanation for the growth of the 
FG, 
but why did the votes for Peronism drop? 
  [Menem] Maybe Justicialist Party [PJ] members or those who 
sympathize with Justicialism decided to cast blank votes or 
support the FG. 
  [CLARIN] Could this happen again next year during the 
presidential elections? 
  [Menem] They are a different type of election. It is one 
thing to vote for presidential, gubernatorial, or mayoral 
candidates, and quite another thing to vote in this type of 
election in which it was known beforehand that the candidates' 
prestige was not involved. [passage omitted] 
  [CLARIN] At the national level the PJ does not have a 
majority in the Constituent Assembly and there is speculation 
that someone may attempt to open up the "package" that you and 
[UCR President Raul] Alfonsin agreed upon. 
  [Menem] We have a strategy to confront this maneuver. This 
is part of politics. And in this field I am no newcomer.... 
  [CLARIN] At the national level, even after a clear victory, 
the PJ has lost 900,000 votes since October.... 
  [Menem] For the reasons I have just mentioned. 
  [CLARIN] There will be a presidential election within a 
year. 
  [Menem] We will recover these votes and achieve a better 
result than the one we achieved in October. A presidential 
election is different. In a presidential election, we are all 
mobilized. This time I went to just two places. I went to 
Cordoba Province, where I knew that we were not going to fare 
well, and I went to Santiago del Estero Province where there was 
a chance of overcoming a given situation. Just 100 days after 
the December disturbances, we carried out a number of rallies, 
approached the community, and won by 12 percent. No one 
expected this to happen -- except those who always have faith 
and hope. [passage omitted] 
  [CLARIN] Do you believe the 10 April election results spell 
the beginning of the end of a bipartisan system? 
  [Menem] Following these elections, the bipartisan system has 
become a four-party system. There are four strongly emerging 
parties. Of the two traditional parties, Justicialism is 
holding on while the UCR is visibly shrinking. Nevertheless, I 
believe the UCR will regain its strength and its votes. [passage 
omitted] 
  [CLARIN] The latest foreign trade figures indicate that 
exports are growing at a much slower pace than imports.... 
  [Menem] Every country that is overcoming serious crises and 
entering a process of significant transformations will have 
unbalanced trade figures. Argentina cannot be an exception. 
What are the goods that cause this imbalance? Imported capital 
goods. How can we compete at an international level with totally 
obsolete equipment in our factories? We must not forget that as 
we progress in technology, incorporating science into 
production, we will overcome a large number of stumbling blocks 
in our efforts to compete internationally. We are implementing 
an export-oriented policy, and a series of incentives are under 
study. We will be somewhat careful concerning imports because 
virtually all the components required by factories and producers 
have already entered our country. 
  [CLARIN] Please define "be careful concerning imports." 
  [Menem] I do not want to pass absolute judgment, but a 
number 
of measures, to favor our country's production, may be taken. 
These measures will foster our export-oriented policy. 
Nevertheless, this issue must be handled very carefully because 
we may also be subjected to trade reprisals, involving increased 
tariffs, by the countries receiving our exports and the problem 
will be more complicated for us. An agreement must be reached 
on this issue. 
  [CLARIN] [Economy Minister Domingo] Cavallo has recently 
said 
it will be necessary to reduce the consumption growth rate.... 
  [Menem] This depends on the people. When [former President 
Juan Domingo] Peron was president, he said what Minister Cavallo 
is saying now: Save because this situation will not last a 
lifetime. Be careful. It is necessary to be far-sighted.... 
  [CLARIN] Is Cavallo announcing that the party is over? 
  [Menem] No, no... Cavallo is not saying this. He is simply 
telling the people that they have to control their spending. 
Even if we have a very small amount, we Argentines like to 
spend this very small amount. This is why we have ruined over 
the past four or five decades one of the most progressive 
countries on Earth. 
  [CLARIN] How do you view the pharmaceutical patents law 
issue? 
  [Menem] We are making an effort to at least have a Senate 
commission approve it and leave it ready for discussion by the 
Senate plenary. The commission's approval represents an 
important step. 
  [CLARIN] If even this small legislative step is not 
achieved, 
will Argentina be placed by the United States on a list of 
countries whose entry into NAFTA is not recommended? 
  [Menem] I don't know because our imports from this country 
represent a huge benefit for it. More than 50,000 jobs in the 
United States depend on Argentine imports. 
  [CLARIN] It has been said that if no progress is made on 
this 
law, the United States could implement some reprisals, like 
placing us on this list.... 
  [Menem] These are mere sanction announcements. 
Nevertheless, we must not forget that the patents law issue 
goes back to the Bush administration. We discussed this issue 
with Carla Hills who was the U.S. trade secretary during the 
Bush administration. We shall see.... 
  [CLARIN] The GATT agreement establishes a more benign 
patents 
legislation system. Does the bill presented in Congress follow 
the GATT or the U.S. standards? 
  [Menem] It conforms to the U.S. proposal. This is very 
important because like this we have the possibility of joining 
NAFTA and immediately gaining access to a market of more than 
600 million consumers. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by correspondent Celso Pinto from Marrakech] </F>
  [Text] U.S. Vice President Al Gore yesterday strongly 
advocated the inclusion of social working conditions on the 
agenda of the future World Trade Organization (WTO). Brazilian 
Foreign Minister Celso Amorim, however, was the one who most 
strongly opposed this idea. 
  The issue is sensitive, especially for developing countries, 
but the three days of debate among the countries of the General 
Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT), which ended yesterday in 
Marrakech, suggest that the issue will not be discarded. It 
ended up becoming a compulsory point of reference in the 
speeches of the ministers, and also a factor that neatly marked 
a division for the future. 
  Gore's closing speech, and the speech delivered by Amorim a 
short time before, were the most clear examples of the final 
session. "Economic growth cannot be maintained if it ends up 
producing social convulsion," Gore said to representatives of 
more than 120 countries. "A global system of commerce that does 
not eliminate exploitation will collapse in the end, because 
people around the world will not support it," he noted. 
  Gore did not clarify what precisely the United States is 
expecting in this regard, but noted that there is concern about 
extreme situations of manpower exploitation. The implication is 
that this might produce unfair competition. He said, however, 
that "the United States will resist any attempt to turn the 
issue of improved working conditions into a form of 
protectionism." 
  Amorim not only considered "inappropriate" the debate on the 
subject, but believes that it raises the fear of the appearance 
of "global protectionism, which opens the way to the exportation 
of technologically sophisticated goods produced by developed 
countries, and closes the door to our competitive exports." The 
social conditions issue, he suggested, might result "in the 
exportation of unemployment from rich to poor countries, 
transferring a social burden that poor countries cannot bear." 
  The idea of "global protectionism," which Amorim later 
explained to this newspaper, entails the fear that developing 
countries will end up paying twice: by opening several markets, 
through the Uruguay Round of talks, and by having their exports 
hindered in the sector in which they are most competitive. The 
fear is that by using the concept of "social dumping," 
economically developed countries can find a way to ban 
importations from industrial areas where low manpower cost is a 
comparative advantage of developing countries. 
  Even though there are substantial differences with the U.S. 
position, Amorim praised Gore's public commitment to avoid using 
the "social issue" as a veiled form of protectionism. Even rich 
countries are far from having reached an agreement on the 
subject. For example, British representative Timothy Sainsbury 
said that Great Britain "is not convinced that the WTO and the 
international trade system provide the best context for 
addressing the subject." German Minister Gunther Rexrodt 
advocated a "multilateral discussion," provided the matter "does 
not become an instrument for commercial restrictions or for a 
new source of protectionism." 
  Gore also put strong emphasis on the environment, in this 
case with Brazilian support. There is consensus on the subject 
within GATT, and a subcommittee will make a comprehensive 
analysis of relations between the protection of the environment 
and trade during the installation phase of the WTO (which should 
come into operation at the beginning of 1995). After its 
creation, the WTO will have a special committee for the issue, 
which will function until 1996. 
  Gore was the highest-ranking official attending the signing 
of the Uruguay Round agreement in Marrakech. His presence was 
aimed at giving a high profile to President Bill Clinton's 
commitment to free trade, which became confusing immediately 
after the conclusion of the Uruguay Round in December with the 
threat of using unilateral legislation (Super 301) in the 
commercial area. Both Gore and U.S. negotiator Mickey Kantor 
reiterated Clinton's commitment to the commercial opening. 
  Japan, which was the main potential victim of Super 301, 
adopted a hard stance on the issue. Japanese Foreign Minister 
Tsutomu Hata said in his speech that his country is "deeply 
concerned about the protection of domestic industries by the 
abuse of antidumping measures, which will lead to the adoption 
of unilateral measures and to the promotion of regionalism." 
This was a veiled message for the United States. 
  In a meeting with Gore after the GATT session, Hata--who is 
considered a likely candidate for the post of new Japanese prime 
minister--assured that the new government in Japan would not 
change its commercial opening policy, and would continue along 
the course of the liberalization reform. The United States 
expects more concessions in this area, in order to avoid 
imposing commercial sanctions on the Japanese. 
  Japan, like the United States and the other main GATT 
members, reaffirmed its willingness to ratify the Uruguay Round 
in 1994, in order to make feasible the target of beginning WTO 
operations on 1 January 1995. Ambassador Paulo Nogueira Batista 
has told this newspaper that there has been a change in the 
strategy for negotiations over the Uruguay Round. Instead of 
submitting it to Congress, the U.S. executive branch decided to 
submit it separately to the Senate. This will call for approval 
by a two-thirds vote, and not by a simple majority, but will 
give the Round the status of an international treaty, and this 
is very important. Precisely because GATT does not have this 
status (because of U.S. resistance at the time it was created), 
the U.S. Congress does not refrain from applying commercial laws 
that oppose multilateral regulations. If the U.S. Congress 
approves the WTO, it will be more difficult, for example, to use 
instruments like the Super 301, Nogueira Batista has said. 
  Minister Celso Amorim believes that this aspect of the 
Uruguay Round, as an instrument for reinforcing multilateral 
mechanisms and multilateral discipline in world trade, is 
perhaps its main benefit. Obviously, there were gains with the 
reduction of tariffs on industrial products and reductions of 
agricultural subsidies. 
<H5>  Pressure From Brazil </H5>
  However, not all Brazilian expectations were met. For 
example, Brazil ended up obtaining a tariff reduction--beyond 
the average tariff--for orange juice of only 15 percent in the 
United States, and 20 percent in Europe. The Europeans made a 
much more generous offer, but backed down on their word at the 
last minute, under pressure from Spain and Italy. 
  At a bilateral meeting yesterday with Sir Leon Brittan, the 
European official for commerce, Amorim reiterated his hope that 
"it will not be necessary for us to wait for a new round for 
Europeans to give us fairer treatment." 
  Amorim yesterday met with representatives of the Czech 
Republic, China, Uruguay, and Morocco. He and other ministers 
also had lunch with Kantor. To Chinese Minister Gu Yongjian, 
Amorim reiterated his expectation that the Chinese will refrain 
from buying agricultural products on the international market 
from countries that subsidize their agriculture.

<F P=106> [Interview with Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina by </F>
unidentified Channel 13 and NOTICIAS EL DIARIO reporters, in 
Asuncion on 16 April] 
  [Text] [Reporter] You must be aware, Mr. Robaina, that the 
flow of information from Cuba to Latin America, and especially 
to our country, has always been unilateral. We almost always 
receive information from just one source. The ability to talk 
directly to somebody from Cuba, to somebody who holds an 
important post there, is like a breath of fresh air. We would 
like you to formally introduce Cuba to society. This may be 
quite a wide-ranging question, but what is Cuba like in 1994? 
  [Robaina] Well, I am very pleased by what you have just 
said, 
because the fundamental objective of my trip to Paraguay, and 
indeed of my tour of several countries, is to present our point 
of view concerning Cuba's reality. 
  It is very difficult to discuss Cuba's situation today 
because today implies, above all, yesterday. Cuba is an island 
that is facing many pressures that stem from different 
situations. It is experiencing an extremely difficult and 
complex period, but it is armed with cultural, technical, and 
scientific qualifications. This has enabled it to confront the 
harsh situation, the terrible ordeal to which it has been 
subjected. 
  When I say a terrible ordeal, I mean a worsening blockade 
that was compounded by our loss, in 1989, when the long-standing 
privileged relationship between the island and the Communist 
bloc was brought to an end. Having endured the former and 
confronted the latter amid many constraints and a quasi-silence 
campaign, we have struggled to come to grips with a model that 
would enable us to find a place in the sun and, above all, to 
achieve a level of economic results that will enable us to 
maintain a handful of conquests that we deem sacred. 
  My country does not want to go backward in education, health 
care, science, sports -- the few areas in which Cuba has proven 
to be efficient and has accomplished results. It simply wishes 
to embark upon the path of economic transformation as we already 
have at our disposal raw materials, capital, and technology. 
  It should also be pointed out that the population profile 
has 
also changed on the island -- there are 5.7 million Cubans under 
30 years of age. Half the population was born after the Cuban 
project proved to be successful. On the one hand, this has its 
advantages, but on the other hand, it also has its drawbacks. 
  [Reporter] One former Cuban education minister once told us: 
"We may change everything, but we will not give up the present 
levels of education and health care." Is this correct? 
  [Robaina] That remark could even be much more to the point 
now because the country is in even more serious jeopardy. 
Everything is negotiable, anything may be discussed, except our 
sovereignty, our independence, our ability to speak with our own 
voice, which today are indeed at stake. 
  We can discuss anything except what may entail going 
backwards in our achievements in education -- as the former 
minister said -- in health care, science, and sports, because 
these are the areas where we have made conquests and can show to 
the world. 
  [Reporter] You have said that many things, indeed nearly 
everything is negotiable. Is Fidel Castro's leadership 
negotiable? 
  [Robaina] The Cuban people have never questioned Fidel 
Castro's leadership or considered the need to negotiate it. The 
Cuban people are not willing to take this issue to the 
negotiating table. I believe Fidel's presence and work are more 
important than his mere physical presence among us. I believe 
it was Fidel himself who brought up this issue for public 
discussion because he has no interest in staying in power 
forever. He remains in power, and with Cubans it is not because 
he decided to do so, but rather because Cubans wanted it. I 
believe Fidel is a testimony to the extent to which we guarantee 
the continuity of the project. To us Fidel embodies dignity to 
a superlative degree. He personifies a historic role in his 
time and now. He has such an important role to play today in 
the country's economic transformation process that he cannot be 
left aside on any account. To us, Fidel is too important to 
negotiate over or to allow anybody to demand that we include him 
in a series of alternatives in order to reach a certain 
agreement. 
  [Reporter] With regard to Fidel Castro's possible 
succession, is there any alternative political scheme under 
consideration or will his successor come from the same party, 
the same revolution? 
  [Robaina] I believe succession must come first, the 
succession of Fidel himself, who has taught us Cubans not to 
worry about change because changes should not be traumatic for 
Cubans. I believe succession affects both he who assumes 
office, no matter who that may be; but above all it affects the 
project in which many participate collectively. In my view, 
that is a phenomenon. Now, concerning the possibility of a 
political system different from the one we now have, that does 
not even depend on whether Fidel is in office. It is my 
considered opinion that any modification to the chosen system 
depends on the deep causes that led us to this system. 
  My country opted for an ideology and embarked upon a certain 
path due to an ongoing threat that has not disappeared. I am 
not referring to a military threat, as I am aware that some may 
wonder if we believe we are in danger of being attacked. My 
country is enduring an aggression that is much more difficult 
than an act of military aggression. My country contends it has 
been strangled through economic means and therefore, as long as 
these conditions prevail, my country cannot afford to make 
changes right now, as many countries living under normal 
conditions think we should. My country has to think about 
surviving first in order to be able to change later. While 
conditions continue unchanged it is impossible for my country to 
accomplish what other countries accomplish under normal 
conditions. 
  [Reporter] Is it possible to consider a capitalist Cuba in 
terms of a market economy? How is Cuba facing this reality? 
  [Robaina] No. Cuba is facing a reality in a world that up to 
now has had a bipolar structure and that at present is unipolar. 
For us, a Cuba that follows an economic model that renounces our 
conquests is out of the question. Notwithstanding this, we 
Cubans want -- and we are striving for it -- a Cuba that, in a 
changing world where options are so difficult and complex, is 
able to maintain some ties and economic relations without 
renouncing its very essence. To do this we must embark on a 
process of mixed partnerships in those areas where we are 
seeking markets and capital. We continue more than ever 
committed to a model that will enable us to make headway in our 
conquests and in social justice. We are aware that we have 
drafted and are implementing this model under a lot of pressure 
and at a time when working conditions have changed tremendously. 
This is why we say that the most important thing for us now is 
to defend the essence. We will defend ideals that for us are 
really sacred, given the conditions found along that path. My 
country is not, and does not intend to be included among those 
countries that, to overcome a crisis, state that the only way 
out is to adopt a model which, in my view, continues to make the 
rich richer and the poor poorer. 
  [Reporter] Will Cuba give up a centralized economic system 
or 
will it negotiate quotas, as you said concerning education and 
health care, despite the fact that these are not negotiable 
either. What is Cuba not willing to forego, to leave behind? 
  [Robaina] No, Cuba already has a new economic model. Cuba is 
no longer talking about a totally centralized and state-run 
economic model as we had up to now. Cuba wants to maintain its 
achievements and under the government's participation, has 
already embarked upon a process of mixed partnership. Moreover, 
Cuba is not the only country doing this. We are assessing other 
countries' experiences. We have opened the country to foreign 
capital, liberalized the labor market, and allowed the use of 
the land by farmers whether or not they work on sugar cane 
plantations. The decentralization of many duties, until now 
performed by the central government, speaks of an economic model 
that is being sought in order to adapt it to the Cuban reality. 
  [Reporter] We expected the ceremonies to welcome a guest of 
your stature by our authorities would be more grandiose, but the 
important thing is that you are here, as you have said, and have 
brought this new approach to relations, this new air that is 
beginning to be breathed between our countries. 
  [Robaina] For me, the most important thing, as you said, is 
that a new channel of communication is being opened. 
  Much has been said about this being a private visit, but I 
can assure you that I could not have made a more public visit. 
Anyhow, I am really pleased to have been able to know the 
Paraguayan people and with the many representatives I have the 
honor of meeting.

  [Text] The search for private risk capital for the nuclear 
sector is one the biggest challenges of the process that began 
with the transformation of the power sector. 
  Energy Secretary Carlos Bastos has said that the leading 
guidelines for the transformation are basically the following 
principles: 
  -- The state, as such, has decided to no longer engage in 
the 
production of power, on the grounds that it is not a strategic 
activity. 
  -- Within this context, the privatization of the sector as a 
whole (electric, gas, and oil areas) has basically sought to 
reorient the entrepreneurial role. This topic has been the 
focus of the reorganization that has been implemented over the 
past four years. 
  The first attempts to privatize the nuclear area caused 
distrust in the National Commission for Atomic Energy (CNEA), 
which, according to what Bastos told LA NACION, has now 
disappeared, giving rise to a stage of mutual cooperation. 
<H5>  The Rules of the Game </H5>
  The CNEA, Bastos said, must adapt itself to the new rules of 
the game. 
  One of the main obstacles that specialists mention in 
referring to the search for risk capital for the nuclear sector 
has to do with the appropriate insurance and policies for 
operations, and the economic provisions for the future 
dismantling of those power centrals. 
  Specialized technicians note that a plant like Embalse might 
produce 8,000 tons of highly contaminated residue that should be 
dumped in a grave or appropriate deposit. The total cost of the 
deactivation operation may not be less than $200 million. 
  In the opinion of Bastos, this might not be a serious 
problem. The state has never accumulated reserve funds for this 
purpose, for example by increasing part of the cost of that 
power, simply because it has always been expected that, whenever 
necessary, the Treasury would provide the funds. 
  The CNEA, Bastos went on, should reorganize itself into an 
enterprise ruled by private commercial regulations, which does 
not mean that in the future the Treasury will not provide funds 
for pure and applied research in the nuclear area, or for the 
completion of the third plant (Atucha-2), construction of which 
should have ended in 1987 according to the original project 
timetable. 
<H5>  The Next Steps </H5>
  Concerning the reformulation of the CNEA role, Bastos 
mentioned that work is being done to restructure the laws that 
will regulate the participation and role of private capital. To 
this end it will be necessary to create a new organization with 
the same CNEA people, who will be in charge of regulating the 
sector. This is to some extent what is happening to Calin 
(Advisory Council for Licensing Nuclear Facilities) with respect 
to CNEA, although in this case there will be more autonomy. 
  In sum, there will be a power generation enterprise with 
security legislation for its operation. 
  Furthermore, attached entrepreneurial activities, like the 
extraction of uranium, will be reorganized into one or more 
enterprises whose shares will be, in principle, owned by the 
state.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, April 19 (CTK) -- Czech Premier 
Vaclav Klaus arrived for an official visit to Argentina last 
night. 
  His Argentinian visit is the first on his ten-day trip 
around 
South America, which is to lead him also to Chile and Brazil. 
  At a briefing held after his arrival, Klaus told journalists 
that his trip was aimed to establish the best possible mutual 
contacts and find methods of the extension of mutual trade. The 
Czech Republic is open to the world and, like Argentina, 
fighting against all kinds of protectionism, Klaus said. 
  Argentinian Economic Minister Domingo Cavallo, at present 
also in charge of foreign affairs, who met Klaus at the airport, 
showed interest in the privatization process in the Czech 
Republic. 
  Later in the night, Klaus was to visit the prestigious 
Argentinian Committee for Foreign Relations, where he was to 
acquaint leading Argentinian politicians with the transformation 
process now underway in the Czech Republic, and with his 
country's integration into European political, security and 
economic structures. 
  During his three-day stay in Buenos Aires, Klaus is to hold 
talks with Cavallo and meet with Argentinian President Carlos 
Menem. He is to lecture at Buenos Aires' Belgrano University 
and meet with representatives of Argentinian financial, business 
and industrial circles.

  [Text] Brasilia -- Army Minister General Zenildo Lucena and 
the military chiefs who surround him believe the involvement of 
Rio de Janeiro's political-administrative structure in organized 
crime has reached such a serious level that it justifies federal 
intervention. According to an officer stationed in Brasilia, 
despite the risks and complexity of this sort of action, 
intervention is appropriate, but it will probably be implemented 
too late. 
  For less serious reasons, the Army intervened in Alagoas 
State. It did so, however, at the request of the Alagoas 
governor and under the orders of the president of the Republic. 
In the case of Rio de Janeiro, neither Minister Lucena nor 
General Benedito Leonel, the Army chief of staff, believe 
Governor Nilo Batista will call for military support. First, he 
would be announcing his inability to solve the problem, and 
second because Batista is involved in the numbers game scandal. 
  The Army minister has been receiving visits from 
congressmen, 
most of them from Rio de Janeiro, at the Army Headquarters in 
Brasilia. To each of them, Gen. Lucena regrets the insecurity 
that reigns in Rio de Janeiro. He also comments on the legal 
impossibility of intervention in the absence of a request from 
the governor and an order from the president of the Republic. 
  The Army minister believes intervention is necessary, but 
can 
only act if it complies with the constitutional norms, as he and 
Gen. Leonel said in Brasilia on 18 April. The two generals 
added that they are ready. If President Itamar Franco gives the 
order, the Army is ready to act. Their remarks do not seek to 
praise their military organization and are more than just a 
message: They are almost encouraging the president of the 
Republic to give the order. 
  The Army has the intervention planned. For a long time, the 
military information and intelligence services have been 
following the actions of organized crime in Rio de Janeiro. 
They have reasonably assessed the arrival of weapons in the 
city and have precious information on the organization of 
criminals. 
  The involvement of the Rio de Janeiro security apparatus in 
organized crime has convinced the military that intervention 
would consist of three stages: 
  1. To moralize the Military, Civil, and Federal Police, as 
well as at the Fire Department because, together with the Army, 
they will participate in the war against crime. 
  2. To effectively fight crime by occupying the hill slums. 
  3. To end the intervention period, when the Army will 
return responsibility for the security structures to the state 
government. 
  In Rio de Janeiro, as well as in the federal administration, 
there are many restrictions on such a complex action. Last 
year, the Military Command of the East clashed with Leonel 
Brizola's opposition to an Army participation in a fight against 
crime. At the time, Brasilia also opposed military 
participation.

  [Text] Documents found at the house of Detective Inspector 
Nestor Silvio Soares Maganinho, who was assigned to the Robbery 
and Cargo Theft Division in Bangu and served as a bodyguard for 
numbers game kingpin Castor de Andrade, are proof of the link 
existing between the numbers game and the smuggling of arms, 
possibly those used by drug traffickers and by robbers of 
armored bank vehicles. The documents were picked up by the PM-2 
(Military Police Secret Service) squad five days before the raid 
of Andrade's main accounting office in Bangu on 30 March. The 
documents will be submitted today by the 34th Precinct to the 
Civilian Police Internal Affairs Department. 
  All of the 183 ammunition requisition forms found at the 
bodyguard's house are in the name of Castor de Andrade, his 
bodyguards, numbers game kingpin Ailton Guimaraes -- who is also 
known as Captain Guimaraes -- and even in the name of police 
officer Idovan Ferreira, who is the head of the 4th Civilian 
Police Regional Division in Araruama. Through the documents 
seized, the police reached the conclusion that the arms smuggled 
by Andrade's gang were coming by ship through Sepetiba, 
Itacuruca, and Angra dos Reis. 
  Ironically, Captain Guimaraes' name has in the past already 
been linked to arms smuggling. Early in the 1970's, Guimaraes 
had to answer charges at a military police inquest on charges of 
withholding smuggled goods. As a result of the inquest, 
Guimaraes had to retire, and thus his life of crime began. 
  The chief of the 34th Police Precinct (Bangu), Carlos 
Alberto 
Campagnac, said the smuggled goods are not entering the city 
through the international airport or through the port of Rio de 
Janeiro. Castor de Andrade may be using remote beaches outside 
the area of influence of the Federal Police. Campagnac, who is 
also listed as having received bribes from Andrade, said: 
"Andrade's ships can navigate on the ocean. We are thus 
looking into his fleet of ships." 
  According to police, because the bribes demanded by federal 
agents for the release of the arms "are high," Andrade has been 
using his own ships to transport ammunition and arms imported 
from the United States and Israel. According to a Federal 
Revenue Secretariat [SRF] source, "there is no way to stop 
smuggling in the port of Sepetiba and the surrounding area." 
The SRF source added that there is not even enough manpower to 
discharge its 60 tasks. The Federal Police reported that its 
function at the port of Sepetiba is just to check passengers. 
  In addition to the documents found at Maganinho's house, 
which is located at 771 of Doze de Fevereiro St., the police 
also seized a sizable amount of ammunition and imported weapons 
-- such as a Smith and Wesson revolver -- plates for 
identification cards, licenses and CPF's [Individual Tax Payers 
Registers], and even Point Blank bulletproof vests manufactured 
in the United States. 
  Judge Marcos Antonio Bakker of the Second Bangu District has 
already issued an arrest warrant against Maganinho, who remains 
at large. Campagnac reported that the items seized at 
Maganinho's house will be examined by experts, along with the 
weapons confiscated at Andrade's headquarters -- where his 
bodyguards used to stay -- 18 days ago, which included an Uzi 
submachine gun. The writing on the requisition forms will be 
compared with that of the accounting books seized at the 
Andrade's accounting office.

requested that the implementation of the real be expedited. 
Cardoso's advisers denied he made such a request, but they 
admitted he had conferred with the team on the status of the 
economic stabilization plan and the various alternatives for the 
new currency's implementation. Dismissing the possibility that 
the meeting could convey the idea of a parallel government, the 
advisers said the economists called on Cardoso to convey to him 
their condolences over the death of his younger brother and 
ended up engaging in a long discussion on political and economic 
issues. 
  The meeting, which was held at Cardoso's home from 1630 -- 
when he arrived in Brasilia -- to 1800, was attended by Central 
Bank [BC] President Pedro Malan, who gave a briefing on the debt 
agreement signed on 15 April; Gustavo Franco, director of the BC 
International Department; Winston Fritsch, secretary for 
economic policy; Persio Arida, president of the National Bank 
for Economic and Social Development; special adviser Edmar 
Bacha; Finance Ministry executive secretary Clovis Carvalho; and 
diplomat Sergio Amaral, chief of Finance Minister Ricupero's 
staff. 
  After the meeting, Cardoso went to Planalto Palace to meet 
President Itamar Franco. He was scheduled to meet at night with 
Ricupero. According to his advisers, in his talks with Franco 
and Ricupero, Cardoso was to discuss a definition of a minimum 
agenda for the constitutional revision. 
  One economist described their meeting with Cardoso as a 
meeting among friends at which they discussed the formation of a 
comprehensive front to back the presidential candidacy of the 
former finance minister. 
  PSDB campaign coordinator Euclides Scalco confirmed 
Cardoso's 
interest in reducing the transition period toward creating the 
real. In remarks by telephone from Curitiba, he said: "With the 
implementation of the real, we will bring inflation down 
faster." Despite the arguments that it would be better to wait 
until August or even September to implement the new currency, 
Scalco deems it more important to obtain economic results as 
soon as possible.

  [Text] By asking his former economic team to expedite the 
implementation of the real, Senator Fernando Henrique Cardoso 
has dangerously mixed his role as presidential candidate with 
that of finance minister, a post from which he stepped down more 
than three weeks ago. In just one move, Cardoso may have played 
into the hands of those contending that the plan is 
election-oriented. Besides, in so doing, Cardoso has put his 
successor at the Finance Ministry, Rubens Ricupero, in an 
awkward position. 
  Ricupero's authority has been eroded by Cardoso. Ricupero 
sustained this blow at a time when he is trying to strengthen 
his position as manager of the economic plan and to free himself 
from the persistent shadow of his predecessor. Proof of this is 
Ricupero's assertion that the plan is acquiring a new identity. 
For his part, Cardoso -- whose aim is focused on the election 
-- has made it clear that he does not want his trademark removed 
from the plan. 
  Cardoso also is leaving himself open to an uproar of 
criticism by his adversaries, who are interested in weakening 
his candidacy by way of his economic plan. If Cardoso wants to 
influence the stabilization program's future, it would be best 
for him to use his Senate seat to help revive the constitutional 
revision process.

  [Text] Brasilia -- Diplomat Rubens Ricupero's first two 
weeks at the Finance Ministry reveal the internal contradictions 
and disagreements in the economic team, which was in apparent 
harmony until Senator Fernando Henrique Cardoso stepped down to 
run for president. Since 5 April when Ricupero was installed, 
there have been two crises -- and they have not been resolved 
yet -- between the members of the first team of advisers and 
secretaries, on whom the new minister counts for waging the war 
against inflation. 
  No solution has been found to the public confrontation 
between Finance Ministry executive secretary Clovis Carvalho and 
Federal Revenue Secretary Osires Lopes Filho. The latter wants 
the approval of a project to restructure the Revenue 
Secretariat, which Clovis Carvalho has opposed. Lopes has 
threatened to resign if the minister does not support at least 
some of the proposed measures. Carvalho is not calm either. The 
only member of Fernando Henrique Cardoso's team who was unknown 
to Ricupero, Carvalho will remain in his post but will lose 
coordination power to diplomat Sergio Amaral, the cabinet chief 
and adviser to the minister. 
  Another problem for Ricupero is special adviser Edmar 
Bacha's 
unwillingness to remain in the government. The information on 
Bacha's resignation reached the minister's cabinet in the middle 
of the difficulties caused by the congressional debate on the 
provisional measure for implementation of the economic plan. 
Bacha's resignation might have been caused by his willingness to 
resume academic commitments in Rio de Janeiro, where he is a 
UFRJ [Federal University of Rio de Janeiro] professor. 
  Difficulties -- The conflict between Osires and Carvalho 
also 
seems far from being settled. Ricupero has known Lopes since the 
beginning of the 1980's as his fellow professor at Brasilia 
University. As for Carvalho, the minister only has some good 
references of him, which he received from some common friends. 
It is believed that if the minister does not approve at least 
the creation of three coordinating boards for improving the tax 
control system -- as is provided for in the new Internal Revenue 
Department regulations -- Osires Lopes will actually resign. 
  Some government members consider that the minister's style 
in 
dealing with this type of problem consists of encouraging 
internal problems in the hope that they will reach a natural, 
spontaneous solution. For Ricupero's direct advisers, however, 
things are not quite like that. They explain that he is a deeply 
thoughtful man who, rather than taking a hasty step, prefers to 
delay a decision. In order to avoid losing Bacha, they said, 
Ricupero might name him to the new Central Bank executive board, 
which will take care of circulation of the real, independently 
of the fact that the minister will guarantee immunity against 
political pressure to spend more than what is permitted by the 
government's fiscal situation. 
  The economic team now is mostly concerned about the 
possibility of a new fiscal crisis after approval of the Social 
Emergency Fund and on the eve of the new currency's circulation. 
During the first quarter, the Treasury registered a deficit of 
$250 million, despite the fact that the Revenue Department's 
monthly income has surpassed last year's average value by $1 
billion. The increase in interest rates since December, which 
aimed at fighting price speculation, forced the Treasury to 
disburse $1.1 billion, compared with $540 million spent in the 
same period in 1993. 
  Relations -- With such high interest rates, the economic 
team 
fears a reaction by President Itamar Franco, who might again 
talk about the economy at any time. Without the shield of 
Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who kept Franco's explosive 
personality under control, Central Bank technicians are 
preparing for just about any presidential offensive. The finance 
minister, despite his "good chemistry with Franco," as an 
adviser put it, addresses the president with the reverence due a 
superior, which is the typical attitude of a career diplomat.

  [Text] Brasilia -- The signing of a foreign debt agreement 
with the private banks means the resumption of foreign 
investments in the country to Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero, 
and the possibility of creating jobs domestically. Ricupero 
believes the agreement will be indirectly instrumental in 
reaching an agreement with the IMF, which will in turn put an 
end to a crisis that has afflicted Brazil for 12 years. 
  Ricupero said on 17 April that "the crisis that has erupted 
in the country since 1982 provoked uncertainties in the 
Brazilian economy and discouraged new investments." 
  To demonstrate that the agreement signed in Washington on 15 
April will have a positive impact on the lives of all 
Brazilians, Ricupero said the country now will be able to resume 
major short- and medium-term investments that will increase the 
number of jobs. He said: "To create more jobs is the main issue 
in Brazil." 
  Ricupero said the agreement with the creditor banks 
represents a reduction of nearly 25 percent of the overall 
Brazilian foreign debt to private banks, which amounts to $51 
billion. William Rhodes, Steering Committee chairman and 
Citibank vice president, said in the United States that the 
agreement is "historic for Brazil" and will open new fronts for 
the country. 
  Ricupero noted that in the 1970's Brazil used to invest 25 
percent of its GDP in the productive sector and today this 
percentage only totals 16 percent of the GDP. He said this 
situation could change as soon as economic growth is resumed 
thanks to the inflow of foreign resources into our economy. 
  The minister said the country will get a new boost through 
the approval of Provisional Measure [MP] No. 457, which creates 
the Real Value Unit (URV). The MP already has been approved by 
a special congressional committee and probably will be voted on 
by the plenum on 20 April. 
  Speaking to reporters outside his home, Ricupero said: "The 
MP's approval represents a guarantee for us that we are going to 
resolve the inflation problem, and the agreement's signing 
enables us to expect that the inflow of financial resources into 
the country will soon return to normal."

  [Text] Brasilia -- Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero 
yesterday stated that the constitutional revision process is not 
over yet, and announced that the government will make a major 
effort this week with congressional leaders to effect a 
turnaround before 31 May, the established deadline for the 
conclusion of the Constituent Congress. Drawing a comparison 
between the revision process and a soccer game, he said: "We 
are perhaps already 20 minutes into the second half of the 
soccer game, but we can still turn the game around." Speaking 
during a news conference he called yesterday afternoon to 
discuss the subject, he added: "I believe one is only truly 
defeated when one considers oneself to have been defeated." 
  Ricupero urges a greater effort by those running for office 
in the upcoming elections with a view to influencing the 
constitutional revision process. He said: "Those candidates 
who believe they are likely to win are the ones who should 
undertake this effort." He voiced his belief that Itamar 
Franco's government has already discharged its duty in this 
regard. He added that the lack of structural reforms will 
render the future government inoperative. 
  To make this turnaround possible, Ricupero announced that he 
and four other ministers -- Planning Minister Beni Varas, 
Industry and Commerce Minister Elcio Alvares, Justice Minister 
Alexandre Dupeyrant, and Social Security Minister Sergio Cutolo 
-- will have lunch on 19 April with all congressional bloc 
leaders to establish those topics the government considers to be 
essential for its economic reform. 
  Upon urging the virtual presidential candidates to support 
the revision process, Ricupero mentioned the drafting of the 
1996 budget, which he believes will be the first task the new 
government will have to undertake. He said: "How will the new 
government finance public accounts with all those restrictions 
if it can no longer count on the Social Emergency Fund [FSE]?" 
He noted that the FSE stemmed from an amendment approved by the 
Constituent Congress, and that it will be valid for financing 
social spending only in 1994 and 1995. 
  Ricupero stated that the government will not overlook 
congressional authority in outlining the points of a possible 
negotiated minimum agenda. He made it clear, however, that he 
is going to fight to prioritize issues such as tax, fiscal, and 
social security reform, as well as related restrictions. He 
described issues such as the definition of national enterprise 
and the opening up to foreign capital as important for Brazil's 
future development.

<F P=106> [Article by Foreign Minister Celso Amorim] </F>
  [Text] The most ambitious initiative for regulating world 
commerce in our century, the so-called Uruguay Round of 
Multilateral Commercial Negotiations -- which was set in motion 
in 1986 in Punta del Este, within the context of GATT -- ended 
in December 1993. The Final Act of the Uruguay Round, which I 
and representatives of 120 countries will sign today at a 
historical meeting in Marrakech, includes -- in addition to the 
matters regarding tariff reduction -- trade in agricultural 
products and the so-called new issues (services, intellectual 
property, and investment). The Final Act also provides for the 
creation of the World Commerce Organization (WCO), which is due 
to gradually replace GATT. 
  Brazil was one of the original GATT signatories in 1947, and 
has actively engaged in all the multilateral commercial 
initiatives that have been launched since then. The relatively 
homogeneous distribution of Brazilian foreign trade among our 
main partners justifies the priority that we have attached to 
strengthening the multilateral system of commerce, with open 
structures and with stable rules, and to the improvement of the 
conditions for having access to export markets. According to 
figures that were recently released by the GATT Secretariat, the 
set of agreements to be signed in Marrakech will promote an 
increase in world income by at least $230 billion until the year 
2005. For Brazil, the conclusion of the Uruguay Round should 
entail an increase of at least $2 billion annually in our 
foreign trade figures, in addition to the indirect earnings 
stemming from the growth of the world economy. 
  The importance of the Uruguay Round for Brazil is also 
directly related to the implementation of a domestic commercial 
liberalization and deregulation program, and to the broad 
objective of promoting the competitive integration of our 
country into the world economy. In light of the current 
atmosphere of non- conflictive coexistence of the globalization 
and regionalization trends of the world economy, Brazil -- in 
its capacity as global trader -- is naturally interested in the 
consolidation of stable, balanced world trade rules. Within 
this context, the priority that we have attached to the 
implementation of Mercosur [Common Market of the South], and to 
a recent initiative to create a South American Free Trade Area, 
will supplement, yet not with an exclusionary approach, the 
efforts that we have made for the sake of strengthening 
multilateral policies in commercial relations. 
  Despite the fact that the results of negotiation do not 
always fully match prior objectives, the positions that finally 
prevailed, particularly as concerns the regulatory side of the 
Uruguay Round, are convergent with our essential interests. The 
improvement introduced into the GATT mechanisms for the 
settlement of controversies, and the creation of the World 
Commerce Organization, will certainly contribute to 
consolidating a set of stable rules that will be able to 
substantially reduce the possibility of protectionist outbreaks 
and unilateral measures. The reincorporation of agricultural 
trade into GATT, the reversal of what has so far been an 
increasingly strong trend to subsidize agricultural products, 
the reincorporation of textile trade into GATT rules, and the 
gains obtained in the access to markets for some Brazilian 
priority products open promising prospects. In addition, 
despite the fact that the reduction of tariffs on important 
Brazilian export products, like orange juice and shoes, has not 
been as thorough as expected, the average reduction by 
approximately 40 percent of the import tariffs levied by 
developed countries will certainly open new prospects for the 
competitive sectors of our economy. 
  Over the past few weeks, we witnessed with increasing 
apprehension the attempt by some countries to overcharge the 
agenda of the ministerial meeting in Marrakech with matters that 
were not included in the deliberations during the closing 
session of the Uruguay Round. Strong pressure was exerted to 
condition trade on, among other factors, the social patterns of 
work. Thanks to coordinated reaction by several developing 
countries, among them Brazil, those attempts, which in the final 
analysis would have exported unemployment from rich to poor 
countries, did not move forward. 
  We hope the results of the intense negotiations made during 
the seven years of the Uruguay Round will wipe out, once and for 
all, the phantom, announced by so many, of the fragmentation of 
world commercial trends into isolated blocs, and of the untimely 
return to the commercial wars that marked the 1930's and which 
would certainly jeopardize the foundations of the new 
international order that we have to build in the post-Cold War 
world. The standing commitment of the ministerial meeting of 
Marrakech, that no measures that can harm or negatively affect 
the implementation of the results of the Round will be adopted, 
will be particularly relevant during the transition period from 
GATT to the World Commerce Organization, which will begin on 1 
January 1995. 
  During the next few months we will engage in intense 
information clarification work, with a view toward obtaining as 
soon as possible the ratification of the Final Act of the 
Uruguay Round. In the contacts I intend to have with Congress 
and with the productive sectors I will try to convey my firm 
idea that the World Commerce Organization will decisively 
promote commercial liberalization and the strengthening of the 
multilateral system of commerce, which are essential objectives 
of Brazilian foreign policy.

  [Text] Brasilia -- In a plenary session held on 12 April, 
the Superior Electoral Court [TSE] confirmed that the number of 
federal deputies to be elected for Sao Paulo State will increase 
from 60 to 70. The TSE did not change, however, the number of 
federal deputies to be elected for other states. Thus, Sao 
Paulo State voters will elect 10 more federal deputies in 
October. 
  If the proportional system established in Supplementary Law 
No. 78 of 30 December 1993 was to be fully applied, states like 
Rio de Janeiro, Parana, and Espirito Santo should lose a deputy 
each, while Bahia State should win three deputies and Minas 
Gerais two deputies. But the TSE decided to change only the 
number of deputies for Sao Paulo State, based on that law, which 
provides that "the largest state will be represented by 70 
federal deputies." 
  The TSE made this decision unanimously after ruling that 
Article 4 of the temporary provisions (which referred to the 
1990 elections) is valid and thus endorsed the position that the 
blocs of federal deputies will not be changed during the first 
legislature following the issuance of the supplementary law. 
  The aforementioned law, which implements the constitutional 
rule that the number of federal deputies will be proportional to 
the population of each state, was not approved until late last 
year and was not published until 5 January. The law thus will 
be applicable only to the 1998 elections. 
  In addition to increasing the number of federal deputies in 
the state, Sao Paulo voters also will be able to elect more 
state deputies in October, that is, 90 deputies.

<F P=106> [Ian Rodger report: "$150m Held in UBS Account by Wife of </F>
Suspected Drug Dealer"] 
  [Text] The pride of leading Swiss bankers in the care they 
take to avoid handling dirty money has been bruised by 
revelations that Union Bank of Switzerland [UBS] has been 
holding $150m (102.7m pounds) in Zurich for an alleged Colombian 
drug dealer for several years. 
  Although it is by far the largest amount of drug money 
uncovered in a Swiss bank, the account is not the first of its 
kind. In 1989 a parliamentary commission accused the public 
prosecutor of laxity in pursuing narcotics investigations, and a 
book with the cheeky title, La Suisse Lave Plus Blac 
(Switzerland Washes Whiter), became a best-seller. 
  But this latest case is a surprise in the light of the 
efforts made by Swiss authorities in the last few years to 
outlaw money-laundering and force banks to stop dealing with 
criminals. 
  The controversy began when Mrs Sheila Miriam Arana de 
Nasser, 
who held the account, applied in January for permission to buy 
her house near Geneva. 
  As with every foreigner, Swiss authorities insisted on 
checking her background and bank references. With the help of 
U.S. Drug Enforcement [Agency] officials, they identified her as 
the wife of Mr Julio Nasser David, sought as a leading drug 
trafficker in Colombia. 
  On February 23, Mrs Arana was arrested by Swiss police and 
the account frozen. On Friday, charges were filed in Miami 
against the couple for smuggling more than 55,000 1bs of cocaine 
and 3 million lbs of marijuana into the United States from 1976. 
Mr Nasser David is still at large, and the United States is 
seeking Mrs Arana's extradition from Switzerland. 
  The UBS vice-president who opened and handled Mrs Arana's 
account has been suspended and is being questioned by Zurich 
police. The Swiss Bankers' Association due diligence committee 
has launched an inquiry. 
  The big question among Zurich's banking community is how 
UBS, 
renowned as the most cautious and meticulous of banks, could 
have failed for so long to have spotted trouble in the Arana 
account. According to the authorities, she opened it in 1979 
with a $50m cash deposit. UBS claims it carried out its normal 
identity checks which showed the family had extensive shipping 
and hotel interests in Colombia, so there was no reason to 
suspect anything untoward. 
  "Not every Colombian is a potential money-launderer," says 
Mr 
Stephan Haeringer, a UBS director. However UBS admits that the 
account manager must have been very naive. 
  Swiss laws and regulations on money-laundering were 
tightened 
in the late 1980's. Analists were asking why UBS, which has a 
100-strong internal audit team, did not pay special attention to 
accounts from places such as Colombia and Sicily with known 
links to drug smuggling. 
  Apparently not much effort was required. A Zurich prosecutor 
says that even the children in the Nasser Davids' home town of 
Barranquilla were aware of the alleged drug links. The bank 
says the account has been virtually inactive for many years, so 
there was no reason for suspicion. 
  "The manager's superiors asked questions and got appropriate 
answers," UBS said. "We are now checking to see if we have to 
change our procedures."

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "$150 Million Confiscated at SBG"] </F>
  [Excerpts] In the so far biggest Swiss case of 
money-laundering, about $150 million were seized at the Swiss 
Banking Society (SBG). Criminal proceedings have been initiated 
against a long-standing deputy director of the biggest Swiss 
bank in Zurich, the responsible authorities have announced. 
  According to information released by Jacques Antenen, deputy 
investigating judge of Waadt Canton, the seizure of $150 million 
at the SBG took place in connection with investigations against 
suspected money-launderers of the Colombian Medellin drug 
cartel. The Zurich District Prosecutor's Office is convinced 
that the approximately $150 million is dirty money, as District 
Prosecutor Dieter Jann-Corrodi said upon inquiry. "I have not 
heard of any bigger case anywhere in the world so far," he said. 
<H5>  Investigations Since June 1993 </H5>
  Since June 1993 the Waadt judiciary has been investigating 
Colombian citizens who belong to a criminal organization located 
in the Colombian town of Barranquilla and are linked with the 
Medellin cartel. They are suspected of having violated the 
regulations concerning money-laundering in the cantons of Waadt, 
Neuenburg, and Geneva. According to Antenen, they invested 
money in, among other things, a restaurant and other real estate 
properties, but that was less than 1 million Swiss francs. 
According to the Waadt investigating judge, investigations are 
being carried out together with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency 
and the authorities in Zurich and are also spread to the cantons 
of Neuenburg and Geneva. On 23 February a Colombian woman was 
arrested; she is still in detention pending trial. Within the 
framework of the investigations, the Waadt judicial authorities 
applied to the authorities in Zurich for legal aid to seize more 
than $150 million at the SBG. 
<H5>  SBG Deputy Director Claims He Knows Nothing </H5>
  Criminal investigations have been initiated in Zurich 
against 
the SBG deputy director, who acted as a trustee. The Zurich 
District Prosecutor's Office accused the deputy director of 
having long known about the dirty origin of the money but not 
having reacted when the penal law on money-laundering came into 
force in August 1990. His temporary arrest was announced on 27 
February. [passage omitted] The deputy director claims not to 
have known anything about the dirty origin of the money, 
District Prosecutor Jann-Corrode said. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Havana, 20 Apr (PL) -- The most important thing is 
the path that is opening up, Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina 
told Cuban television today, referring to the Conference on the 
Nation and Emigration aimed at normalizing relations with 
residents abroad. 
  The conference also intends to seek the way in which we all, 
in a responsible and civilized manner, with respect and mutual 
understanding, can discuss common issues henceforth, the 
minister told the evening television newscast, upon arriving 
from a successful tour of several South American countries. 
  According to the foreign relations minister, for a long time 
the emigre community has been used as an instrument against Cuba. 
  As the reality of Cuban residents abroad is expressed 
differently and as the reality of the country changes, steps are 
taken as a result of a new situation, demonstrating the audacity 
of our project and the country convoking it, Robaina added. 
  The foreign minister said conditions continue to be as 
abnormal as before; therefore, it cannot be asked that ties with 
emigrants be normal. 
  Once more Cuba, rising above these circumstances, is capable 
of finding a solution and its own subject in these times, 
Robaina asserted. 
  Some 200 guests from over 40 countries will participate, on 
their own behalf, in the meeting that will run from next Friday 
to Sunday in this capital.

  [Text] Havana, 13 Apr (PL) -- Today's issue of GRANMA said 
that the coming "Nation and Emigration" conference will be a 
historic starting point for the good of all and a homeland's 
gesture toward those Cubans who neither became citizens nor were 
assimilated into other countries. 
  In a lengthy full-page article under the heading "Migration, 
Exile, and Political Manipulation: A Unique Case in History," 
the newspaper says it is logical for those sectors to want to be 
under the country's protection when it comes to constructing a 
better society and creating an integrated citizen. The author 
of the commentary, Felix Pita Astudillo, added: These Cubans 
living abroad concern themselves with improving their relations 
with their island roots because they "are proud of their Cuban 
citizenship or feel the nostalgia of those who live faraway and 
wish the best for their dear ones, here or there. 
  "If they consider anything necessary, it is the need to 
tighten the relationship between the nation and the exiles, 
struggle for the free flow of citizens, improve postal and 
telecommunications services, regulate remittances to families, 
clean up migration statutes, abolish those laws that are still 
in force, but that date back to times of tension and Cold War, 
and revoke other proposals that surely will be made." 
  Pita Astudillo makes a necessary distinction between Cubans 
who work and live abroad and those who "became U.S. nationals 
and today are U.S. citizens on the payrolls of foundations, 
platforms, and other such monsters, in order to live off their 
fellow men." He underlines as one of the differences between 
these emigres and other communities the fact that the so-called 
Cuban lobby lacks a strategic rearguard or a nation to support 
it, except U.S. offices and agencies. "They demand the right to 
represent Cuba, but, by their own choice, Jorge Mas Canosa 
became a U.S. citizen, Jorge Montaner became a Spanish citizen, 
and Diaz Balart, Ros, and Menendez took up other citizenships, 
because that is an essential requirement for being a member of 
the U.S. legislative body," the GRANMA article adds. 
  Among the mirages that this group attempts to portray as 
real 
fact is the Cuban vote in Florida, which does not exist, Pita 
Astudillo says, because in that state it is necessary to be a 
U.S. citizen to vote. In addition, they have exaggerated 
support from authorities, a support that other communities, such 
as the Mexican community (which outnumbers the Cuban community 
five to one, according to official figures) have not obtained. 
All of this translates into overrepresentation through more 
mayors, municipal councilmen, state legislators, and Federal 
congressmen than any other group, the newspaper adds. 
  "Despite such a controversial position, they demand the 
right 
to be part of a national reconciliation in Cuba as Cubans, but 
neither lobbyists, professional politicians, nor voters are in a 
position to demand that they be identified with those of us who 
once were their countrymen," Pita Astudillo says. 
  The commentator says that the presence in Havana of more 
than 
200 representatives of the exiles on 22, 23, and 24 April will 
destroy the myth that nation and emigration are centrifugal 
forces by definition. Any possible analysis "must face the 
basic cause of the conflict between the two sides: the age-old 
disagreement between the United States and Cuba." Later, the 
article points out that this disagreement started when 
Washington started to covet the then Spanish colony, continued 
down to our time, was aggravated in the past 35 years and became 
particularly bitter with the end of the bipolar world and the 
renewal of the United States' hegemonic aspirations. 
  Regarding the phenomenon of emigration, the newspaper points 
out that in the past this was a basically economic occurrence, 
linked to the independence movement, and was ideologized and 
turned into a political activity contrary to the revolution. It 
is for all these reasons, Pita Astudillo adds, that emigration, 
which became political exile to accommodate different U.S. 
administrations, has now become a unique, unrepeatable 
occurrence in the world's history.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" report for PRENSA LATINA by Tomas A. Granados </F>
-- "Hemispheric Summit: Now it is Clinton's Turn"] 
  [Text] [no dateline as received] U.S. President Bill 
Clinton hopes to meet with hemispheric leaders in Miami at the 
end of the year to discuss profiles of what the White House 
defines as "a new era in Inter-American Relations." 
  In the 1960's, President John F. Kennedy implemented his 
Alliance for Progress. George Bush tried to do something 
similar with his Enterprise for the Americas Initiative. Now it 
is Clinton's turn. 
  "We want to consider two broad issues: The first is how to 
strengthen our democracies, defend them collectively, and 
improve our administration. The second is how to promote 
economic growth while maintaining a sustained development 
strategy that protects the environment and reduces poverty," 
Clinton said during the formal announcement of the summit during 
a brief ceremony on 11 March at the White House. 
  From his offices in Boston, Henry Raymont, a U.S. expert on 
Latin American affairs, said that the scheduled Miami summit 
could help bury old doctrines of open intervention and 
interference applied by Washington to defend its interests in 
the region. 
  Times have changed and now President Clinton is preparing to 
defend those same interests with new political practices that 
will secure Latin American and Caribbean cooperation within the 
framework of a hemispheric initiative based on strengthening 
democracy, hemispheric security, good government, and economic 
development. 
  Nevertheless, Cold War prejudices linger on. In distributing 
invitations to governments approved by Washington as democratic, 
the Clinton administration left Cuba out because of its old 
ideological differences with Havana authorities. 
  "If Cuba is ignored, the meeting's meaning could be 
questioned," said Representative Jose Serrano, a Democrat from 
New York and a leader of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. 
  "The U.S. Government talks about holding a summit with the 
leaders of all the democracies in the Americas. I ask myself: 
What is true democracy... I think that the best way to have a 
dialogue in this part of the world is to include everyone, 
regardless of their philosophy of government," he added. 
  According to the Clinton administration, Miami was chosen to 
host this summit because of the city's dynamic interaction with 
Latin America and the Caribbean. But there could be another 
reason. 
  One reason is that many of the governments invited to this 
meeting have normal relations with Havana and do not agree with 
the U.S. policy of maintaining the economic blockade on Cuba. 
  Washington knows this, and maybe that is why the meeting 
will 
be in Miami, the stronghold of radical Cuban immigrant groups. 
These are the same groups that insulted the famous Mexican 
actress Veronica Castro for traveling to Havana, impeded the 
election of Mario Baeza as under secretary of state for 
Hemispheric affairs, and, more recently, threatened to boycott 
Colombian products if Bogota dares sell petroleum to Cuba. 
  It appears that Washington chose Miami as the ideal place so 
that anyone interested in avoiding a conflict with that 
influential radical sector will not even think of mentioning a 
lifting of the Cuban blockade, much less suggesting the need for 
a negotiated solution of differences between Washington and 
Havana. 
  Contrary to previous meetings of U.S. presidents with their 
colleagues in the hemisphere, such as the one in Panama in 1956 
and in Punta del Este, Uruguay in 1967, Clinton has preferred to 
hold this summit outside OAS auspices as if he were trying to 
avoid similarities. 
  The idea of a hemispheric summit received a definite boost 
at 
the end of January when Alexander Watson, assistant secretary of 
state for inter-American affairs, returned to Washington after a 
visit to Peru with the opinion that "everything is going very 
well in Latin America and the Caribbean. 
  Governments in the region had responded not just "well" but 
"very well" to the three basic objectives of U.S. foreign 
policy; that is; national security, economic growth, and the 
expansion of democracy throughout the world. 
  This positive response has promoted the so-called theory on 
"Hemispheric Convergence," explained by Michael Skol, Watson's 
assistant at the State Department, on 23 February during a 
conference in Miami. 
  In his speech, Skol did not supply enough data to indicate 
whether the national interests of Latin American and Caribbean 
countries were included in this convergence. To avoid mistrust 
in the region, he assured that Washington now intends to 
establish "a relationship in which consultations and reciprocity 
are stressed rather than unilateral action." 
  Watson, in one of his recent appearances before the House of 
Representatives subcommittee on Western Hemisphere Affairs, 
explained the idea even further when referring to the White 
House's intention to create "a new hemispheric association." 
Watson said that the Clinton administration intends to outline 
at the Miami summit the future course of what he labelled a 
"Convergence of Interests." 
  In Washington's opinion, one of the characteristics that 
should be included in that convergence refers to "the collective 
defense of democracy" in the region. A State Department 
official in Washington explained that this does not mean the 
creation of blocs against a foreign enemy. 
  "What the (Clinton) administration proposes is a society for 
peace that will contribute to the solution of border problems, 
cooperation during catastrophes, and, above all, cooperation in 
the fight against drugs," the official said under the condition 
that he remain anonymous. 
  These issues were discussed at the OAS conference on 
hemispheric security in March in Buenos Aires. A consensus on 
the issue is expected when the summit is held. 
  For the time being, there are proposals for the OAS to have 
its own version of the UN "blue helmets" in a new world where 
worrisome theories of "humanitarian intervention" and "limited 
sovereignty" circulate. 
  According to Assistant Secretary Watson, "the waters are not 
completely calm" in Latin America and the Caribbean. He said, 
however, that the fault lies in poverty and in the inefficiency 
of some governments. 
  According to SELA [Latin American Economic System] and ECLAC 
[Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean], by 
the year 2000, 200-270 million people in Latin America will be 
poverty stricken, and at least $200 billion will be needed to 
fight poverty. That is almost half of the foreign debt still 
being paid. 
  One of the great expectations opened by the proclaimed 
hemispheric summit is the possibility of gradual incorporation 
into NAFTA, formed by Canada, the United States, and Mexico. 
  It remains to be seen how the majority of the region's 
countries, with their vulnerable economies, lack of advanced 
technology, and incompetent productive organization can maintain 
fraternal coexistence with the U.S. industrial power. 
  Maybe he is not being cynical at all, but Skol has invited 
the Latin America and Caribbean nations -- the majority of which 
are adversely affected by social despair, the effect of 
neoliberal policies -- to take advantage of the opportunity to 
"become, together with the United States, First World nations." 
  For the time being, the foreign ministers of the 13 member 
nations of the Rio Group have already begun consultations with 
other regional associations, which Washington labels of a 
protectionist character, to voice a conceptual consensus on 
America's role in the new international system being outlined. 
  Among Washington's Latin American diplomatic circles, there 
is the feeling that Clinton's summit could be an opportunity to 
achieve better understanding between their countries and the 
United States. 
  Vice President Gore announced at the end of 1993 the 
intention to hold a hemispheric summit, and some believe he 
insinuated that Latin America will have to leave some of its 
aspirations behind. Gore made the announcement during a visit 
to Mexico, the site of the first Ibero-American summit that 
brought the nations of the region together without a U.S. 
presence.

  [Text] Havana, 16 Apr (PL) -- GRANMA today reports that 
reactionary and right-wing groups in Miami have made threats 
against the Cuban people, its leaders, and those Cuban 
immigrants seeking to normalize ties with the island. 
  Saturday's edition of the official paper of the Communist 
Party of Cuba mentions the use of several Spanish-language radio 
stations to broadcast lies and insults against the population 
and members of the Cuban community abroad who do not support 
their campaign, and instead respect the accomplishments of the 
country's social system. 
  As an example, GRANMA cites the radio commentaries of 
journalist Agustin Camargo who recently asked for "a three-day 
license to kill in Cuba when the Revolution falls." 
  Commenting on what it calls savagery, the GRANMA article 
signed by Juan Marrero, compares that segment of immigrants to 
the most well-known fascists in the world. 
  "Neither hatred nor thirst for vengeance against Cuba have 
been laid to rest by these people," the article states, while it 
describes as just the Cuban Government's decision to exclude 
elements with these characteristics from the upcoming meeting of 
the emigre community. 
  Regarding this, GRANMA emphasizes that on the eve of "The 
Nation and the Emigre Community" conference to be held next week 
in Havana, "messages of deep-rooted hatred toward the 
revolution" have intensified in Miami. 
  In this sense, the article mentions the threats issued by 
the 
Alpha 66 terrorist group, which has declared among its "military 
objectives" all persons who visit Cuba, speak with its 
authorities, or give the country direct or indirect support, 
regardless of their nationality or the kind of support, warning 
that they "will suffer the consequences, inside or outside of 
Cuba." 
  In conclusion, GRANMA condemns those groups who "only want 
to 
maintain the privileges they obtained at the expense of U.S. 
Government funds, or to increase those privileges if they can 
convert Cuba into a territory free for looting and pillaging." 
  Other sources also have indicated that these rightist groups 
are making threats against members of the Cuban community abroad 
who have been invited to speak with the Cuban authorities.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" article by Division General Jesus Bermudez </F>
Cutino, military chief of the Intelligence Directorate of the 
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Cuba: "Numbers Don't Lie"] 
  [Text] In this article published by PRENSA LATINA, the 
chief of military intelligence of the Revolutionary Armed Forces 
(FAR) of Cuba analyzes U.S. military cuts and notes that they 
are not commensurate with the dismantling of its Cold War 
opponents. 
  The fall of the socialist bloc and the disintegration of the 
USSR and the Warsaw Pact have enabled the United States and its 
allies to act with impunity against their real adversaries and 
those who have never been their adversaries but whom they "do 
not like." 
  In order to do that, they have widely used international 
organizations, particularly the UN Security Council. Within the 
framework of that organization they are trying to materialize 
their doctrines and strategies. There are no better means, as 
actions are sanctified by making them legal. 
  We must listen to silly arguments, such as the 
interpretation 
given to "preventive diplomacy," a term they find attractive 
(and which sometimes is a real "excuse") to prevent a conflict 
the CIA previewed or simply to prevent one from worsening. 
  This can result in the use of force, especially by those who 
are stronger. 
  Washington's "preventive diplomacy" is not new. It has its 
roots in gunboat policy, in U.S. multiple military interventions 
throughout the world, especially in Latin America. In Cuba we 
were victims of that diplomacy on many occasions. In 1898 they 
had to intervene to prevent "chaos and anarchy," after which 
they imposed the Platt Amendment on us, which enabled them to 
continue to intervene. 
  Under the excuse of preventing worse evils, they also 
intervened in the Dominican Republic, Grenada, Panama, etc. 
  For many years, through our ancestors, we learned of the 
peoples' struggle for sovereignty, for which men gave their 
lives in many countries. For any dignified man, defending his 
country's sovereignty was reason enough to make any sacrifice, 
even offering their lives. With regard to our country, 
Lieutenant General Antonio Maceo said that "whomever tries to 
take over Cuba" will pick up its soil covered by blood, if he 
does not die in the attempt." That was the concept of 
sovereignty for the Titan of bronze: it was a matter of pride. 
We could make an endless list of men who have maintained 
similar positions with regard to the sovereignty of their native 
land and others who as internationalists have fallen under other 
skies defending the sovereignty of other countries. 
  During the 48th period of sessions of the UN General 
Assembly 
in 1993, however, a document was approved which states that 
absolute and exclusive sovereignty is no longer valid and that 
it has never had any legal basis. Following that logic, the UN 
Security Council can decide to intervene in any country under 
the pretext of maintaining peace, or simply to restore it, as 
the case may be. Actions can also be preventive, in other words 
to prevent a problem: covering the pimple with a bandage before 
it bursts. 
  Although the road to hell is paved with good intentions, 
there could be good intentions behind this, depending on how we 
look at it. Applying "preventive diplomacy" could mean that the 
UN Security Council could demand that the United States 
unconditionally lift its blockade on Cuba to normalize the 
situation in the Caribbean and put an end to the policy of 
hostility toward Havana. That however, would be asking for the 
impossible. 
  Although the document is not of a compulsory nature, its 
application is considered legitimate. 
  Also making an appearance was the so-called "humanitarian 
intervention," the one that links four bags of beans to 
thousands of tons of bombs, and while a person is eating, 
thousands others are dying. With this trend, phrases such as 
"humanitarian bombings," "humanitarian artillery preparation," 
humanitarian surgical strikes," and "humanitarian raids" 
[previous word in English], among others, will soon make an 
appearance as well. For example: 
  It is a fact that worldwide strategic changes have forced 
the 
U.S. Department of Defense to cut its budget, and this is why a 
quantitative reduction of the armed forces has been proposed, 
but it is also true that the United States will not renounce its 
international leadership, which allows it to stick its nose 
wherever and whenever it pleases. 
  This is why quantitative reductions should not affect these 
at all. The new strategy establishes four basic points: 
strategic dissuasion, advanced presence, reaction to crisis, 
and reorganization. 
  -- Strategic dissuasion: They maintain their defensive and 
offensive strategic forces at levels above those of current 
international reality. Moreover, they continue to prepare and 
train the use of force despite changes that have taken place in 
the world and agreements signed on this matter. 
  -- Advanced Presence: In areas near Cuba, to mention only 
that which affects us most, they maintain about 10 vessels of 
all kinds and a similar number of planes day after day under the 
pretext of fighting against drug trafficking. 
  As part of their blockade against Haiti, the Navy and the 
Coast Guard maintain no fewer than 10 vessels and several planes 
only a few km off our coastline. They are joined by naval and 
aerial units currently participating in the Fleetex Exercises 
off the U.S. eastern coast and in the Caribbean, involving 
thousands of soldiers, and with this, and Agile Provider '94, 
they will keep us under the tension created by the "villains" 
throughout April and May, and "God knows" what they are up to. 
  -- Reaction to Crisis: 79 percent of their ground forces are 
kept in their territory and they are ready as the "firefighters" 
of McNamara, and given that there is no longer an enemy in 
Europe, it seems that the Pact of Varsovia died...? Who is this 
package of forces in the West aimed at? 
  -- Reorganization: It is very easy to announce cuts and 
maintain 89 divisions, 4,600 tactical fighters, and an 
industrial plant [potential] that allows it to start producing 
at full force in a relatively short period of time. For 
example: In little more than 60 months, between July 1940 and 
August 1945, they produced 86,000 tanks, 120,000 pieces of 
artillery, 1,200 combat vessels, 82,000 landing craft, 96,000 
bombers, 88,000 fighters, 23,000 transportation planes, among 
others. 
  All basic elements of the U.S. military strategy are 
intrinsically linked to a number of principles that foresee the 
maintenance of a number of units with high-combat readiness, 
represented by the contingency forces, which allow them on the 
basis of technological superiority, to maintain the principle of 
"decisive force," which means accumulating as much force as 
needed to crush the adversary in a short time, even if this 
involves killing a goat with a B-52 bomber loaded with 27 tons 
of bombs. 
  Thus, as others in the world are truly disarming, the 
"supermen" maintain the principle of force and are ready to 
fight, are trying to avoid substantial cuts to not affect the 
quality of personnel training and the superior technology of 
their armament and equipment, and their industrial potential is 
also ready. They will not get rid of this regardless of the 
cost involved. 
  These figures, in the end, reflect no real cuts. They 
rationalized intermediary, noncombative positions, closed 
obsolete bases, and cut certain costs that had always been 
superfluous and unnecessary, but these measures are not 
commensurate with the true dismantling being carried out by the 
alleged enemies they maintained throughout the "Cold War," whose 
end is only theoretical. 
  In sum, "preventive diplomacy" needs these forces.

  [Text] Havana, 19 Apr (PL) -- Victor Manuel Melendez, of 
the Mexican Entrepreneurial Council for International Affairs 
[Consejo Empresarial Mexicano Para Asuntos Internacionales -- 
CEMAI] and who is taking part in a bilateral meeting here today, 
said that in the future Cuba could sign a free trade agreement 
with Mexico or Central America. 
  The 11th plenary session of the Cuba-Mexico Entrepreneurial 
Committee [Comite Empresarial Cuba-Mexico], which began meeting 
on Monday in the El Nacional Hotel in Havana, presented in its 
opening session a conference on NAFTA (Mexico-United 
States-Canada) and similar agreements signed by Mexico with 
Chile and Costa Rica, as well as similar future agreements to be 
signed by Mexico with four other Central American countries. 
  Melendez said the process of openness that has begun in Cuba 
could expedite its participation in free trade agreements. He 
warned that because of current trends toward a global economy, 
no country can survive in isolation. 
  In reply to a question by Julio Garcia Olivera, 
representative of the Gaviota Tourist Corporation, on how NAFTA 
will affect bilateral trade, Melendez explained his country's 
commitments to the United States and Canada do not affect trade 
with Cuba. 
  He warned, however, that competition could be a factor, 
because Cuban products would compete in terms of prices and 
tariffs with similar Canadian or U.S. products, which have the 
advantage of not paying import duties to enter the Mexican 
market. 
  On the other hand, Cuban merchandise would be barred from 
being reexported to the United States, especially merchandise 
blacklisted by the U.S. blockade, due to the certificate of 
origin required for all merchandise involved in the trilateral 
trade pact. 
  The entrepreneurial committee continues its sessions today 
and will end the sessions on Thursday. Forty Cuban businessmen 
and 37 Mexican businessmen will attend this meeting.

<F P=106> [Article by Jose Dos Santos, PRENSA LATINA collaborator and </F>
vice president of the Union of Cuban Journalists: "Tourism in 
Cuba: New Era Industry"] 
  [Text] Havana [dateline as received] -- Tourism is a 
popular activity in Cuba and it has increasingly become a 
leading factor in the transformation that Cuban society strives 
to achieve. 
  Different perspectives characterize it in history within the 
social transformation launched 35 years ago. Today it strives 
to achieve a re-evaluation in volume and scope that will turn it 
into the country's foremost industry. 
  This cannot be achieved simply with sun, beaches, and 
verdant 
scenery, which is common in many places throughout the 
Caribbean. These elements only represent the natural 
surroundings of an ongoing explosion. 
  The people, their sympathy and hospitality, their social 
saga, and our current epic multiply the attractiveness that is 
now a potential for tourism given the authorities' decision to 
open it as a first class market... but that is not enough either. 
  An economic organization must outline a much more productive 
combination of the geographical layout and human atmosphere. 
New and not so paternalistic models will strengthen the 
required vigor. 
  Under more realistic considerations, starting at this stage, 
bankruptcy appears in Cuba as an economic category that will 
bolster spirits, encourage ideas, and guarantee efficiency. 
<H5>  Different View </H5>
  Until recently, the massive socialization of production 
means 
and basic services involved a "responsibility delegated to 
high-ranking officials" in many Cuban economic structures, 
meaning a form of blaming others -- particularly the state -- 
for the deficiencies and problems resulting from the actions 
carried out by the people, themselves. 
  The issue is too complex to explain here, but in tourism, as 
in many other sectors, it entailed shortages, deficiencies, 
limitations, even losses which directly affected the guarantee 
of a salary, job, and social benefits for all those who 
participate in the process. 
  Until now it was normal for the state to finance, subsidize, 
support, become indebted, and assume all the risks and 
non-reimbursed expenses, seeking an overall financial balance 
based on the income from more profitable areas and entities. 
The crisis provoked by external reasons further emphasized the 
lack of balance by making profitable activities more and more 
scarce. 
  It is as a result of this reality that staunch socializing 
views begin to change quite drastically. Agriculture production 
groups working as cooperatives are the most recent example, but 
not the only one. 
  Assuming business roles that have been carried out by the 
Armed Forces for several years -- a type of pilot plan for high 
production efficiency and feasibility -- tourism now faces new 
challenges with the economic good sense demanded by the current 
situation. 
  Osmany Cienfuegos, vice president of the Council of Minister 
in charge of the sector, explained in detail the concept 
currently under way during a closed-door meeting with a group of 
journalists, which included this correspondent. 
  The principle that will guide the country's tourism system, 
as it is being done by autonomous enterprises such as Cubanacan 
and Gaviota, will be the principle of competition and 
efficiency. That is why the "burdensome and obsolete" central 
structure called the National Institute of Tourism was 
dismantled and "multiplied" to become three independent hotel 
chains, plus another one destined for maritime facilities and a 
company that is comprised of territorial sections under the 
acronym RT (recreation and tourism). 
  This network will incorporate transportation, catering, and 
advertising enterprises, shops, equipment, and other services 
under the supervision and control of a single ministry. 
  He said the hotel chains Isla Azul, Horizontes, and Gran 
Caribe, will have between 6,000 and 7,000 rooms each. The first 
one will be a domestic chain, the second one will have up to 
three-star hotels, and the third chain will be one of greater 
hierarchy. 
  Jose Fernandez Cossio, former Cuban ambassador to Mexico, 
has 
been appointed general director of the Horizontes chain. 
  As part of the different outlook on tourism here, Cienfuegos 
said this will be a job in which the entire country will 
participate. For example, Cuban ambassadors abroad will be 
mainly responsible for carrying out this activity with optimum 
quality, something unthinkable for representatives of other 
countries. 
  Without mentioning operational details, the way the 
activities and mechanisms will be implemented in the new 
ministry will give us a glimpse of the future course of the 
economy. For example, to avoid bureaucracy, the services of 
specialized institutions will be hired when necessary, as in the 
case of audits. That is why there will only be 50 officials 
working there. 
  In addition, decentralization is aimed at getting the hotel 
manager or other type of entrepreneur to be held accountable for 
what is done at his installation or activity. It means each 
person will respond for what happens in his immediate 
surroundings, something Cuban society greatly needs. 
  Likewise, closed preserves, the land plot mentality, and 
other subjective limitations that have become a burden for 
tourism -- as for many other activities -- will be eliminated so 
that, for example, in the sale of facilities and options, the 
RT's will not only be working for the ones they run. They will 
be forced to give the same treatment to other facilities in 
their territory under the risk that they could be stripped of 
properties under their custody if they act differently. 
  Another new feature is that the management cadres of the new 
state tourism structure will be subject to contracts, renewable 
or not, depending on the specific results of their work, which 
in practice means that whoever is not earning a profit will go 
bankrupt along with his entity. 
<H5>  Results and Expectations </H5>
  Without going into many details, Cienfuegos said that in 
1993 
Cuba reported a 30-percent increase in tourism revenue, with 
560,000 visitors, and it is believed that tourism revenue could 
be 25 percent higher this year than last. 
  He said that if the trend continues, tourism revenues could 
surpass revenues from the export of sugar cane, the principal 
export product in the country. This could become a reality in a 
few years. 
  In addition to obtaining financial results, with the 
transformation of Cuba's tourism industry, the country is 
publicly starting a transformation of concepts and operational 
methods in the Cuban economy that can be used as a guideline for 
its progressive but massive introduction into the rest of the 
nation's activities and fields, a necessary mechanism to 
increase efficiency and productivity. It will help the country 
leave behind the present critical period. 
  According to a survey conducted by a specialized company, 
Mexico was the third place country from where the most tourists 
visited Cuba in the winter of 1993, with 29,964 tourists, only 
surpassed by Canada and Argentina.

  [Excerpt] Quito, 16 Apr (EFE) -- One million Amazonian 
Indians from Peru, Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Guyana, Brazil, 
Bolivia, French Guiana, and Suriname have rejected the Brazilian 
Government's plan for radar surveillance of that jungle region 
because they believe that it is a plan to militarize and 
colonize the region. 
  In a communique issued in Quito this week, the Coordinating 
Board of Indian Organizations of the Amazon Basin (COICA) 
requests that the Brazilian Government spend the $1 billion 
budgeted for that project on the construction of hospitals, 
schools, and health centers. 
  Last week, Admiral Mario Cesar Flores, Brazilian secretary 
for strategic affairs, presented the plan for "the protection 
and exploitation of natural resources, the protection of Indian 
areas, and the control of illegal actions," with the help of 
radar surveillance of the Amazon region. Flores invited other 
Amazonian countries to join in this project. He said that 
Colombia and Venezuela had shown interest in it and specified 
that "it was a system for protection, not military defense," but 
the Indians do not believe this. 
  "We do not need the military to protect us. Thanks, anyway. 
What we need is to be left alone, recognition our territories, 
and the right to a large share of what is produced in them," the 
COICA communique states. "We know you intend to militarize an 
approximately 20-mile wide strip throughout thousands of 
kilometers of the jungle, much of which is Indian territory," 
the communique adds. "If you divide the $1 billion you will 
spend to `protect us' among the million Indians who live here, 
that will give us $1,000 per person," the communique points out.

  [Text] Havana, 20 Apr (AFP) -- President Fidel Castro Ruz 
is "in perfect health," a Cuban Foreign Ministry representative 
stated Wednesday, denying rumors spread abroad of an attack on 
the Cuban leader or his hospitalization. 
  According to the source questioned by AFP, the head of state 
participated as scheduled in an "official function" on Tuesday 
[19 April] night. Nevertheless, rumors apparently started by a 
Florida radio station spread in several Latin American 
countries, claiming Fidel Castro had been the victim of an 
attack or had been hospitalized in the CIMEQ [expansion unknown] 
-- one of the best hospitals in Havana. 
  In Washington, a U.S. State Department spokesman announced 
the United States had no information that enabled it to confirm 
or deny any version of the story, and he noted there was no 
"indication" of a change in the situation in Cuba. 
  In fact, the situation was completely normal on Wednesday in 
Havana, where most Foreign Ministry officials were preparing for 
a conference which, from Friday to Sunday, will bring together 
representatives of the Cuban Government and some 200 members of 
the Cuban community living abroad.

  [Text] Havana, 20 Apr (EFE) -- Official Cuban Foreign 
Ministry sources today denied to EFE that President Fidel Castro 
had suffered a stroke and said "he is in perfect health." 
  The sources also denied Castro had been admitted to "Cimex" 
Hospital in Havana for a checkup. 
  The sources said Castro is not scheduled to attend the 
meeting between the Cuban Government and Cubans living abroad 
that begins on Friday, but they added that he will attend the 
next National Assembly of the People's Government meeting 
scheduled for 1 May. 
  Although Fidel Castro has not been seen in public since 2 
April, when he met with Chinese Deputy Planning Minister Hao 
Jianxiu, other sources said the Cuban president presided, as 
usual, at Monday's Council of Ministers meeting.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with (Isidro Zardales), Havana Radio </F>
Havana Cuba editor in chief, in Havana by an unidentified 
reporter at the Circuito RPC Radio studios in Panama City -- 
live] 
  [Text] [Reporter] Good morning, Mr. (Zardales). Right now 
in Panama City we are hearing rumors that there has been an 
attack on Cuban President Fidel Castro. What is being said in 
Cuba at this very moment? 
  [(Zardales)] We are surprised by this information. We have 
no knowledge of such an attack. We have not even heard that 
President Castro is sick, which is another rumor I hear is going 
around. 
  The president of Cuba has not appeared in public in these 
past few days because there has been no need for it. No 
activity has been held in which he has had to participate. His 
brother has been seen in public at events to mark the 
anniversary of the Bay of Pigs victory. That is why rumors 
started that he was victim of an attack or a stroke. The truth 
is that we have no official or unofficial information on this. 
To be honest with you, we have not even heard street rumors 
about this. 
  [Reporter] In other words, Mr. (Zardales), nothing is being 
said about this in Cuba. 
  [(Zardales)] No, not really. I have just come in from the 
street. I was reporting from the city, and I have no 
information on this. Before receiving your call, I talked with 
comrades here at the radio station and no one has information on 
this. 
  [Reporter] Mr. (Zardales), what do you think prompted the 
international version on what might be happening to Fidel Castro? 
  [(Zardales)] I think it is wishful thinking on the part of 
some people. Many people would like to see something happen to 
him. I believe these people are trying to create a bizarre 
perception of our country in advance of the upcoming emigre 
meeting in Havana. The meeting will be attended by Cubans who 
live in several countries -- in the United States, Europe, Latin 
America, and even Australia. 
  [Reporter] Mr. (Zardales), you have said Fidel Castro has 
not 
been seen in public for the past few days. When was the last 
time he was seen in public? 
  [(Zardales)] The truth is that I cannot remember. I cannot 
remember. I know it was a few days ago, however; there are no 
indications that he is sick. Similar rumors were spread in the 
past when he was not seen in public. I imagine he has a lot of 
work to do. I believe he is involved with the upcoming meeting 
in Havana, and this must be keeping him pretty busy. We are 
hoping it will be a successful meeting -- a meeting of 
rapprochement with the Cuban community living abroad. We are 
all Cubans and have the right to discuss the political and 
social future of our country. 
  [Reporter] Mr. (Zardales), you are a reporter. Are there any 
rumors that Castro is sick? Has an official announcement been 
made about some kind of illness he may have, perhaps heart 
disease? 
  [(Zardales)] All he is suffering from is having excellent 
health. If we are going to talk of illness, we can talk about 
old age. Old age is something natural for all of us. However, 
I do not think he is ill. He enjoys good health. 
  We saw him recently. He is a man who keeps himself 
physically strong. He enjoys sports. He will jump into the 
water and take a swim at any time of the day, even in the early 
morning hours. He also plays basketball. He keeps himself 
physically strong. We honestly have not heard that he is ill. 
  [Reporter] In conclusion Mr. (Zardales), has an official 
announcement been released regarding the international rumors 
that Castro is ill? Do you know of this? 
  [(Zardales)] No, no, no. I have heard nothing of this. I am 
just arriving. I have not read today's news releases, but I 
have seen nothing about this. As I said earlier, I believe such 
rumors begin every time he is not seen in public for two or 
three days. I also believe that these rumors are being spread 
in light of the upcoming meeting with Cubans living abroad, or 
with representatives of the Cubans living abroad. 
  [Reporter] Thank you, Mr. (Isidro Zardales), Radio Havana 
Cuba editor in chief.

  [Text] Washington, 20 Apr (AFP) -- Reports that President 
Fidel Castro has been hospitalized after suffering an attack or 
a heart attack were reported frequently in several American 
capitals on Wednesday, prompting an official denial from Havana 
and a cautious nonconfirmation in Washington. 
  Robert L. Fretz, the official responsible for Cuban affairs 
in the U.S. State Department, said that his office had also 
heard the rumors but did not have official reports from Havana 
on Castro's health, "nor any indication there was a change in 
the situation in Cuba." "The regime seems to continue in firm 
control of the police and the security forces," Fretz added, 
saying that the United States "continues to monitor the 
situation closely." 
  Gladys Gonzalez Noy, a Cuban dissident living in Havana, 
told 
the National Cuban-American Foundation (CANF), the largest 
anti-Castroist organization, by telephone on Wednesday that 
Castro was hospitalized last week after suffering a heart attack 
following an attempt on his life. Acccording to Gonzalez Noy, 
Castro was hospitalized at the Surgical Medical Research Center 
(CIMEQ) in Havana last week but was transferred to another place 
on Tuesday, according to a recording of a conversation supplied 
to AFP and other media sources at CANF headquarters in Miami 
(Florida). 
  Gonzalez Noy, president of the Pro-Free Art Association, 
said 
Castro was caught in the middle of a shooting, a rumor that 
circulated last week. Although he was not injured, according to 
her, the incident affected him greatly. "First, before the 
heart attack, Castro suffered a respiratory arrest as a result 
of the whole situation," she affirmed. 
  Gonzalez Noy asserted that state security has just forbidden 
her to leave her house and that there is an unusual police 
presence in Cuba. 
  Other well-placed sources in Washington said, however, that 
regarding Havana there were only reports of an increase in the 
security presence around the CIMEQ hospital, one of the most 
prestigious in the capital. 
  In Havana, a Cuban Foreign Relations Ministry official 
questioned by AFP said on Wednesday that Castro is "in perfect 
health" and conducted as usual an "official activity" on Tuesday 
evening. 
  In fact, the situation seemed normal on Wednesday in the 
Cuban capital, according to an AFP reporter. 
  Most officials at the Cuban Foreign Ministry have been busy 
with preparations for the conference that, from Friday to next 
Sunday, will gather representatives of the Cuban Government with 
some 200 members of the Cuban exile community.

    [Editorial Report] Cuba Vision Network in Spanish at 0030 
GMT on 20 April features its regularly scheduled 30-minute Open 
Agenda program with host Antonio Resillez and guest Rene Mujica, 
adviser to the foreign minister, on "The Nation and the Emigre 
Community" conference. 
  The program begins with a video of Antonio Aja Diaz, deputy 
director of the Political Alternatives Study Center of Havana 
University, who points out that the United States is the main 
destination of Cuban emigration, approximately 1.0439 million 
Cuban immigrants; followed by 15,000 in Spain; 13,000 in 
Venezuela; 4,000 in Mexico; and much smaller numbers in other 
countries worldwide. Aja points out that Cuban immigration 
experienced a significant increase in 1959, and that the main 
destination for two centuries has been the United States. 
  Mujica begins by stating that a little more than 200 people 
are expected to attend the Havana conference. The agenda 
includes several subjects to familiarize participants with the 
current Cuban circumstances and to discuss issues of interest to 
emigres. He adds that Ricardo Alarcon, president of the National 
Assembly of the People's Government, will discuss the Cuban 
People's Government system; Abel Prieto, president of the 
National Union of Cuban Writers and Artists, will discuss Cuban 
culture and national identity; Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina 
will discuss current ties and prospects of ties between Cuba and 
the emigre community; and finally, Carlos Lage, secretary of the 
Executive Committee of the Council of Ministers, will discuss 
Cuba's current economic situation and prospects. 
  Mujica adds that the number of participants "is not 
significant, many people have asked to participate." He adds 
that it is important to stress that the participants come from 
approximately 40 countries, are from diverse fields and social 
conditions, and will pay their way. 
  Mujica goes on to say that the goal of the conference is: 
"to 
identify a common ground to work toward the establishment of 
normal ties with the emigre community. The meeting will become a 
forum to exchange opinions, and to discuss possible solutions, 
and difficulties. It will not be a negotiation from which 
accords could result." Mujica adds the meeting will be austere 
but that several dozen comrades -- the minimum necessary -- from 
diverse Cuban institutions and sectors directly related to 
immigration will also attend the conference. 
  Prompted by Resillez, Mujica stresses that the participants 
are not sympathizers with the Cuban Revolution -- a false claim 
by the foreign media. 
  Regarding foreign media claims that the conference's 
ulterior 
motive is economic, Mujica adds: "That is another false claim 
made to distort the true goals of this initiative by the Cuban 
Government. There is no hidden agenda. This initiative is being 
handled in a clear, open manner. There are no ulterior motives. 
  "The foreign media purposely exaggerate certain opinions on 
the significance, or economic impact which might result from 
ties with the emigres. Every human relation or endeavor has, of 
course, an economic aspect but this is in no way the motive of 
our initiative, nor is this economic aspect a significant 
prospect for Cuba's future." 
  A video segment with Ingrid Estevez, from Havana's 
Socio-Political Studies Center, stresses that polls conducted in 
1993 and 1994 reveal that the current Cuban opinion on the 
emigres is "more mature"; for example: 40 percent of the people 
polled believed the emigres condemned the blockade; 79 percent 
agree that emigres could use and pay for Cuban medical services; 
83 percent agree with normalizing ties; 52 percent wish to visit 
relatives in the United States. Another poll conducted earlier 
this year shows that 84 percent supports "The Nation and the 
Emigre Community" conference. 
  Mujica points out that the conference ought to show the way 
to normalize ties with the emigres and adds: "We hope contacts 
will increase and there will be a program of contacts with the 
emigres, and our institutions, relatives, etc., through diverse 
channels of communication". 
  Resillez asks if there are signs that the U.S. Government is 
somehow participating in the effort to improve the emigre's ties 
with Cuba, since the majority of emigres reside in the United 
States. 
  Mujica answers: "No, really none. This is absolutely a Cuban 
initiative. There is no participation from any government or 
foreign element in its development. The answer is definitively 
no." He adds: "I do not know of any statement or official 
position from U.S. authorities regarding this conference. 
Governments do not have to have a position on everything 
happening in this world, particularly, if their interests are 
not affected as we hope is the case." 
  Mujica points out that reporters are not invited to the 
conference in order to facilitate the frankness and openness of 
the discussions and that the media will be able to report on the 
opening and closing ceremonies, and will receive daily reports 
via an official spokesman. 
  In closing Mujica stresses: "We know this is a highly 
interesting and sensitive subject for our people. We have made 
every effort to keep the people informed about it and we will 
continue to do so to see that our people are fully informed."

<F P=106> [Commentary by Miguel de la Guardia Hernandez from the </F>
"Evening Information Review" newscast] 
  [Text] On 16 April, Basic Industry Minister Marcos Portal 
thoroughly discussed the current Cuban energy crisis before a 
panel of journalists from television and other media. Great 
expectations surrounded Portal's public appearance, considering 
the population is suffering daily power outages that last 
several hours. In addition, transportation service has been 
reduced to a minimum. Strict fuel shortages, frequent 
breakdowns in power plants, and the limitations resulting from 
the serious economic situation known as the special period have 
seriously limited the supply of gas. 
  This situation, which has caused severe and constant 
hardships among a population that works and strives courageously 
to preserve its social victories, would have triggered the 
collapse of any government or social system that did not have 
the firm support of the majority of its people, as is the case 
with Cuba and its revolution. In turn, the authorities feel 
obligated to inform Cubans fully and to give them all of the 
necessary information to inform them of the situation and the 
efforts being undertaken to overcome the crisis. 
  Minister Portal referred to the poor condition of Cuban 
power 
plants, which lack required regular maintenance because of a 
shortage of spare parts and accessories. The supply of these 
parts was interrupted by the sudden collapse of the Soviet Union 
and other socialist countries in Europe, which had provided Cuba 
with power plant equipment and the fuel required to operate the 
plants. 
  Minister Portal spoke of Cuban efforts to develop its oil 
industry with the assistance of foreign companies that have 
entered into joint investments with the Cuban Government. 
Portal pointed out that 1994 production in regions that have 
already been explored will greatly exceed 1 million tons of 
petroleum, and Cuba will be able to increase the ceiling on 
petroleum used to generate electricity. 
  Along this line, Minister Portal had to refute false rumors 
rival radio stations air to Cuba. These rumors claimed that the 
heavy crude being extracted from some of the country's fields 
had damaged the power plants. The information provided by 
Minister Portal has been properly conveyed to Radio Havana 
listeners worldwide -- especially on this continent -- and has 
been welcomed by a population confident its revolutionary 
government is doing all it can to resolve the problems. The 
Cuban Government has the committed support of its people to 
confront the current critical situation. 
  One aspect of Minister Portal's speech deserves special 
attention because it reflects the sensible path authorities are 
following -- namely, the policy to avoid depending on a single 
country, a single economic and commercial source to ensure the 
functioning and development of Cuban society. Cuba currently 
has trade and economic development relations with a wide range 
of countries, including Spain, Canada, France, the Netherlands, 
Great Britain, and Latin American countries, with which it can 
conduct exchanges for mutual benefit. Therefore, the Cuban 
economy will experience flourishing and stable growth, and no 
power will ever be able to enforce a blockade or cut supply 
lines to Cuba in an attempt to impose its political interests 
and views. 
  We, the Cuban people, are facing a critical situation, but 
we 
are reaping very useful lessons from the struggle, and we will 
become increasingly harder to defeat.

  [Text] Today, the extraordinary military council of the 
Eastern Army opened with Army General Raul Castro; Commander of 
the Revolution Juan Almeida Bosque; Division Gen. Ulises Rosales 
del Toro, chief of the General Staff; and Division Gen. Ramon 
Espinosa Martin, head of the Eastern Army, in attendance. 
Council members and first secretaries of the party from the six 
provinces that form part of the Eastern Army were also in 
attendance. Party officials from Ciego de Avila and Sancti 
Spiritus were present as special guests. 
  During the first part of the event, participants heard a 
detailed report, presented by Brigadier Gen. Urbelino 
Betancourt, head of the General Staff of the Eastern Army, on 
the energy potential of the Eastern Army. The report disclosed 
its capacity and considerable potential, based on its reduction 
in consumption of conventional fuel, which reached 77 percent in 
comparison to 1989; while with electricity, it used 50 percent 
less, without affecting fulfillment of combat preparation 
programs, equipment conservation, ammunition savings, and a 
considerable increase in food production. 
  The increased use of fuel-saving devices and methods, such 
as 
windmills, biogas processors [digestores], solar energy, 
bagasse, sugarcane straw, and firewood as alternate sources; and 
the use of animal power in various activities; the use of 
magnetizers, direct fuel emulsifiers for service and combat 
vehicles, and the use of efficient stoves are realities that 
were verified by those who attended this extraordinary military 
council of the Eastern Army, which focuses on the organizational 
measures being carried out, with the goal of securing the 
instruction process of the troops under conditions very close to 
option zero. 
  The meeting held with combatants of a great tank unit 
selected as one of the best in the whole FAR, allowed them to 
see the operation of a classroom complex specializing in tanks, 
infantry, and communications. It was here, where Raul and those 
who are accompanying him received many demonstrations on the 
overall state of the troops, target practice with tanks using 
lever mechanisms and stabilizers, in which variations in terrain 
and moveable targets create a sensation of a real offensive 
movement by these machines. 
  The overcoming of obstacles, activity on the practice range, 
and mastery in camouflage are objectives of the combat 
preparation that can be seen, along with solutions to substitute 
or adapt means and equipment for conservation in view of the 
lack of some essential elements in defensive preparations. 
Combatants pedal to make the communication stations work. 
Workshops that repair and manufacture parts continue operating 
without fuel. Industrial electric energy continues operating 
through the initiatives of workers, which makes them worthy of 
an outstanding position in the country. Transparent shingles are 
used on warehouses, variants for nonmotorized transportation are 
elements that contribute to the savings in this great unit. 
  The final stop on the tour was at the medical facility, 
which 
is the pride of the Eastern Army because it is the best of its 
type in the FAR, and where more than 135 formulations of herbal 
remedies are manufactured. There is a high use of acupuncture 
and a great quantity of medical equipment that operates without 
conventional energy. 
  This great tank unit, which has maintained its vanguard 
performance for four years in a row, has not neglected the 
production of alternative materials based on Roman cement for 
the construction of housing and fortifications, the production 
of feed and phytopharmaceuticals [fitofarmacos] that were 
previously imported and are used in the poultry and pork farming 
they have developed, or increased possibilities of producing 
freshwater fish in recently built small tanks and dams. 
  An impromptu meeting set the tone for congratulating the 
members of the tank unit on the occasion of their day, and the 
day honoring the Bay of Pigs. Division Gen. Ulises Rosales del 
Toro spoke to those present. 
  [Begin Rosales recording] On behalf of the minister, the 
generals, and the leaders who accompany us, all of whom will be 
with you for two days participating in the military council of 
the Eastern Army, we wish to congratulate you on this day. [end 
recording] 
  Division General Nestor Lopez Cuba, head of the political 
directorate of the FAR, a tank driver during the Bay of Pigs, 
also spoke to the soldiers. 
  [Begin Lopez recording] On this day, we salute all members 
of 
tank units and ask that they outshine the tank units from the 
Bay of Pigs. [end recording] 
  Afterwards, an accurate demonstration was held by a group of 
combatants of the unit, who confidently battled enemy targets as 
any other of the 100,000 experts and marksmen of the FAR would 
do, and who are ready to act under the concept of the people's 
war. 
  This extraordinary military council of the Eastern Army with 
its activities continues to demonstrate with specific facts how 
our combatants, dressed in their olive green uniforms, do not 
fold their arms and are not intimidated by the current material 
obstacles. To the contrary, they arm themselves with new 
initiatives, elevating themselves to the level that this moment 
demands. Above all, each day they perfect their fighting 
capabilities.

  [Text] In the spirit of winning the electricity-generation 
battle, workers from the Antonio Maceo plant, formerly the Rente 
plant in Santiago de Cuba, are working hard to reduce the period 
required for maintenance. 
  The workers are curently working on repairing the boiler of 
the 100-megawatt Unit No. 4. The Rente plant [as heard] has six 
units capable of generating 500 megawatts an hour, but has this 
year been working at 40 percent of its capacity due to the delay 
in maintenance resulting from the national network situation and 
the lack of resources, which are now being received. 
  For this reason, Unit No. 4 is expected to be finished by 
June, and will continue operating with the other units to 
provide an acceptable response to the generation needs this year.

  [Text] Over 25,000 tractors, diverse implements, and 
vehicles from the Agriculture Ministry [Minag] will be subjected 
to a preservation process. The Minag has approximately 150,000 
such resources nationwide; approximately a sixth of which will 
be mothballed. 
  [Begin unidentified speaker recording] In regard to 
tractors, 
for example, we must prepare approximately 8,000 for long-term 
storage, as well as a similar number of diverse transportation 
vehicles. There are also approximately 10,000 implements. [end 
recording] 
  The decision to put away and preserve these resources, in 
addition to material limitations, was made based on the 
existence of more efficient forms of organization in Cuban 
agriculture such as the Basic Cooperative Production Units and 
the Youth Labor Army integrated farms. In this manner, the 
Minag's productive plans for 1994 are not compromised. 
  The process of preservation and storage will be conducted by 
the enterprises which will result in a rational use of available 
resources and the reorganization and betterment of their 
technical assistance network. It was announced at the 
demonstration class on preservation held in Guantanamo that the 
Minag provincial office recommended stopping 40 percent of its 
machinery, half its transportation vehicles, and 30 percent of 
its implements. 
  It is a matter of preservation now to conserve for the 
future.

Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina said our country cannot 
wait for the normalization of relations with the United States 
to take into account citizens who live abroad. The merit of 
this meeting with emigres lies in the fact that even in abnormal 
conditions, Cubans from inside and outside the country have 
decided to hold a dialogue to resolve their common concerns, 
Robaina said. 
  Robaina said that during his Latin American tour, he 
confirmed there is concern among Cuban emigres and residents of 
the countries he visited over the critical situation of the 
Cuban economy and interest in helping the country resolve it.

  [Text] Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina has returned 
to the country. He considered the visit to four South American 
countries positive; he had a chance to explain the Cuban 
situation and to learn something of the situation on the 
continent. 
  Upon returning to Havana, Robaina told PRENSA LATINA that 
this tour has permitted the opening of new channels in Cuban 
communications with Latin America, which he defined as the first 
Cuban priority in the world. Latin America is important to us, 
not only to the extent that we politically agree to a dialogue 
or trade, but also to the extent that we may find a way to 
develop our economic relations with the world, Robaina said. 
  Answering a question on the debt of the American continent, 
Robaina said that most countries are today trying to renegotiate 
their debts, but that Cuba has neither the necessary money nor 
the possibilities of paying it, he said. 
  Returning to the country last night after his successful 
tour 
of South America, Robaina said that among Cuba's possibilities, 
there is nothing more important than promoting the country's 
economic reactivation and increasing exports to help the country 
recover from its current situation. 
  He added that although some government structures of the 
countries he visited wanted to discuss the debt issue, the 
businessmen decided to discuss other matters they considered 
more important. 
  The Cuban foreign minister met with hundreds of businessmen 
who expressed interest in investment possibilities, legal and 
financial guarantees, and areas that could be negotiated with 
our country. 
  Concerning his visit to Argentina, Robaina said that 
relations between Cuba and Argentina have not changed, 
especially because Cuba has remained unaffected by any public 
statement by Buenos Aires officials.

  [Text] Brazilian Health Minister Henrique Santillo has 
announced in Rio de Janeiro that he is holding talks with Cuba 
in order to import the meningococcal meningitis vaccine, the 
only of its kind in the world. The objective of his ministry is 
to conduct a vaccination campaign in Rio de Janeiro, where, even 
though there is no epidemic, meningitis has already taken the 
lives of 10 infants this year alone. Santillo also stated that 
the vaccination will be conducted in Brazil as soon as possible. 
  Santillo went on to say that there are cases of 
meningococcal 
meningitis in many nations. He also acknowledged the 
effectiveness of the Cuban-made medicine to counter this illness.

<F P=106> [Article by Homero Campa] </F>
  [Excerpt] Havana--[passage omitted] 
<H5>  Love in Times of the Special Period </H5>
  The studies titled "Preliminary Analysis of Consensual 
Unions 
in Cuba" and "Characterization of Some Trends in the Formation 
of Couples and Families in the Young Population," written by the 
Family Task Force of the Center for Psychological and 
Sociological Research (CIPS) of the Cuban Academy of Sciences, 
and statistics from the United Nations Population Fund (UNPF) 
reveal some facts on love and couple relations among young 
people on the island. 
  Here are some of them: 
  In 1992 (by which time the crisis was already full blown), 
191,800 couples got married, all in civil ceremonies. Church 
marriages are so rare that they do not appear in any statistics. 
(The Family Department of the Archbishopric of Havana estimates 
that there are about 2,000 in the entire country, which amounts 
to one percent of civil marriages.) The marriage rate is 18.2 
per 1,000 inhabitants, a significant increase over the 7.1 per 
1,000 reported in 1980. 
  The government gives each newlywed couple a package of goods 
and services that are difficult to obtain by other means these 
days: a wedding cake, three cases of beer, an order of "hors 
d'oeuvres," and a chance to go to a special store and buy 
products such as sheets, towels, irons, pressure cookers, 
underwear, etc. That is, if they are in stock. 
  In addition, for their honeymoon it gives them a reservation 
for two nights and three days at a hotel or house located on the 
beach. 
  On weekends, couples flock to Marriage Palaces--old mansions 
adapted for the purpose--and upon emerging, are greeted with 
hugs and kisses from small family groups. "We do not throw rice 
because there is none, but we do give out applause and 
congratulations," says Antonia Vazquez, mother of the 
18-year-old bride Odalis Lugo, who is already on her second 
marriage. 
  The bride and groom usually wear wedding attire rented from 
the state. Recently, it also became possible for "private 
parties" to rent such clothing to make a living, at 350 pesos 
for a bridal gown (the monthly wage of a medical specialist) and 
200 pesos for the groom's suit. Some couples also rent 
cars--1950's-era convertible Fairlanes and Cadillacs decorated 
with balloons--that lead noisy caravans through the streets of 
Havana. 
  Although the increase in the number of weddings is 
considerable, it is not disturbing. According to the CIPS study, 
it is within worldwide norms. The significant thing is that for 
every 100 marriages, there are more than 80 couples living in 
common-law relationships; for every five married women, there 
are four living in common-law relationships. These "consensual 
unions" are particularly frequent among young people under the 
age of 20, and it is disturbing when they occur between 
teenagers under the age of 15; in the last decade there has been 
an increase of 100 percent in these. In other words, many young 
people in Cuba do not believe in marriage. 
  In Cuba, according to the study, common-law relationships 
are 
concentrated in the eastern part of the island (Las Tunas, 
Holguin, Santiago de Cuba and Guantanamo), especially among 
mulattoes and mestizos and, in general, among low-income and 
unemployed persons. 
<H5>  Love and Affection </H5>
  But if marriage is easy in Cuba, divorce is even easier. All 
that is required is 100 pesos, the papers, and the presence of 
one of the spouses. Between 1955 (prior to the revolution) and 
1988, the marriage rate multiplied 2.8 times. During that same 
period, the divorce rate increased 12.5-fold. According to data 
from the UNPF, there is one divorce for every four marriages. 
"Nowadays," says the CIPS study, "Cuba has one of the highest 
divorce rates in the world. It is 3.4 per 1,000 inhabitants, 
exceeded only by the United States (4.8) and Puerto Rico (4.2)." 
  Fifty percent of divorces occur within the first two years 
of 
the marriage, and in general, among young people under 30. 
Recently, youths between the ages of 15 and 20 have begun 
divorcing much more frequently, as much as five times more. 
  According to a CIPS study, young people who start families 
do 
not have enough information about contraceptives. The pregnancy 
rate among teenage girls is growing by the day. For every 1,000 
women under the age of 20, there were 57.1 pregnancies. These 
women dropped out of school, became isolated from their 
contemporaries or were unable to spend free time with them, and 
"became detached from the political-social activities aimed at 
that age group." 
  Abortion is not prohibited in Cuba. Health authorities try 
to 
discourage women from using it as a birth-control method, and 
provide guidance to prevent pregnancy. Nevertheless, every day 
dozens of "regulations of the menstrual cycle" and 
"interruptions of pregnancies" are performed in maternity 
hospitals. Most of the women receiving them are under the age of 
20. They go to these hospitals accompanied by their partners or 
their mothers. 
  The CIPS study states: "Abortion is a woman's right, but 
tolerance of its use as a contraceptive method poses an ethical 
problem that should be confronted by society, by the family, and 
by the couple themselves." 
  And it offers these statistics: "Forty-five percent of 
pregnancies are interrupted, and 81.8 abortions occur for every 
100 deliveries." 
  Normally, marital conflicts between Cubans are due to the 
couple's lack of information, the lack of understanding of what 
marriage is all about, the young age of the spouses, and their 
limited education. Many weddings are "forced by the parents," 
and another factor is the poor conditions in which the couples 
live: the shortage of funds, unemployment, the lack of a home of 
their own, and other conditions. 
  Indeed, the housing shortage is a decisive factor. In view 
of 
the lack of housing in Cuba, especially in Havana, newlyweds 
have to live as "add-ons"--that is the way Cubans say what we in 
Mexico call "keeping company"--with the parents of one of them. 
It is not rare for a small house to hold the parents, their 
single children, the married children and their spouses, and the 
grandchildren. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Movement of Young Patriots [MOJEP] calls on the 
healthy forces of the country to stand in the way of the 
stateless persons. Those who staged the coup wanted to create a 
situation favorable to drug trafficking, according to statements 
by a MOJEP official. 
  [Begin unidentified MOJEP official recording, in Creole] 
Press declaration by MOJEP: We in the coordinating body of 
MOJEP call on the Haitian people to (?understand) why the 
Haitian Army and parliament staged the coup d'etat. (?The reason 
why) all phony political leaders, senators, and deputies of the 
State Department have plotted against democracy in order to 
crush the people is to maintain thieves, drug dealers, and 
zenglendos [pejorative for those who carry out tasks for the 
Macoutes] within the Army and crooked dealers in the parliament. 
This is due to the fact that the State Department knows that if 
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide returns to power, it will not 
be able to lead properly the drug trafficking in the country. 
In that sense, MOJEP calls on all militants, people's 
organizations, and staunch political parties that side with the 
people to throw their support behind President Aristide's battle 
so democracy can be established in the country. [end recording]

carried out within the military institution. Thus, Lieutenant 
Colonel Erwin Mehu has been transferred from the General 
Headquarters to occupy the post of commander of the Croix-des-

Officer Lamour following possible physical abuse, saying that 
the warrant officer is just fine.

  [Text] The office of the Chamber of Deputies continued its 
consultations on 19 April. For the second consecutive day, the 
office of the Chamber, including Chamber President Frantz Robert 
Monde, met on 19 April, first with media directors, and later 
with Army authorities. The consultations were begun on 18 April 
by the Chamber of Deputies in an effort to find a solution and 
fill the political vacuum at the head of the executive. Edner 
Jean filed a report: 
  [Begin recording] [Jean] All the major media in the capital 
were present at this meeting. In their tete-a-tete with the 
office of the Chamber of Deputies, the representatives of the 
fourth power stressed their concerns, first as citizens, and 
further as journalists. They expressed their apprehension with 
respect to the future, whether the press would even exist, given 
the difficulties of functioning in such an environment. One of 
them pointed out that recent predictions regarding the complete 
disappearance of the press are being realized. Accustomed to 
reporting on the divergent positions of politicians, the media 
are well placed to understand that the solution to the crisis 
will not occur tomorrow. 
  President Frantz Robert Monde clearly expressed this on 
Tuesday, 19 April, while insisting on the increasingly urgent 
need to fill the vacuum in the post of prime minister. 
  From this consultation, the representatives of radio, print, 
and television emerged with the clear impression that the 
political decisionmakers are feeling hot and cold, while 
expecting the worst. Despite this pessimistic vision, the 
meeting was reportedly very fruitful. Let us listen successively 
to Max Chauvet from LE NOUVELLISTE, and Mario Viau Signal FM: 
  [Chauvet] Without being pessimistic, I would say there is 
still no opening for a solution. 
  [Jean] Did you make proposals to the president? 
  [Chauvet] No, we did not really make proposals to the 
president. We spoke more as Haitian citizens. We expressed our 
feelings. It is a very complicated problem. We tried to consider 
the problem from various points of view -- from the political, 
economic, humanitarian, and other points of view. Frankly, I 
believe that the president of the Chamber wanted the feedback of 
what we thought. He received feedback from us, but I cannot 
say... [pauses] We did not discuss a particular plan. We would 
like the political sectors involved in the crisis to meet in 
order to defend the children of this country who are dying. It 
is necessary to do something, so we are asking that the 
antagonists, to save this country, hold a meeting about lifting 
the embargo on Haiti. 
  [Jean] Beyond these wishes, the media representatives 
refrained from giving their opinion on the current political 
debate in the country, a debate stuck between the parliamentary 
plan -- application of Article 149 of the Constitution, as 
recommended by the office of Senator Bernard Sansaricq; or 
Article 148 of the Constitution. 
  The media have other questions to ask: 
  [Viau] The question is not which is the best solution, but 
which project will be accepted by the concerned parties. If it 
is not accepted by the concerned parties, it is difficult to 
implement. First of all, it is necessary to find a project that 
could get the approval of the concerned parties. That was our 
viewpoint. It is not a matter of finding that solution A is 
better than solution B, but which one will be accepted by all 
the parties, because finally, we had some proposals for a 
solution. They were all rejected. [end recording] 
  There are the directors of conscience, speaking after 
listening for too long to politicians.

<F P=106> [Article by Juan Manuel Venegas] </F>
  [Text] The Agrarian Reform Secretariat [SRA] and the 
Chiapas State government have agreed that as long as the legal 
situation remains unsettled, peasant organizations in that 
entity will retain the lands they recovered in the past three 
months that, according to peasant leaders, represent 
approximately 100,000 hectares. 
  Meanwhile, the State Council of the Indian and Peasant 
Organizations (CEOIC) has promised to refrain from promoting 
further occupation of land and, as established in the document, 
"to abide by the law should an occupation occur on or after 15 
April 1994." 
  This agreement will be valid for two months. During that 
time, an executive commission will be formed. The commission 
will be comprised of representatives of the agrarian reform, 
agriculture, social development, government secretariats; the 
Chiapas State government; the CEOIC; small landowners; and 
interested peasant groups. Together, the representatives will 
study the situation of each of the properties occupied by CEOIC 
groups. 
  After the study has been completed, the commission will 
establish the legal status of the lands and decide on its 
ownership in a manner "that will be fair and satisfactory for 
all parties involved." 
  In addition, the Agrarian Plural Commission [Comision Plural 
Agraria] will handle "all pending matters regarding the rural 
backwardness of each of the CEOIC organizations. A strict 
schedule will be set and respected by all parties involved, and 
the mechanisms for human, technical, and social requirements 
that will speed up the solution will be established." 
  Likewise, Chiapas Governor Javier Lopez Moreno said that his 
office will advise the district attorney's office to "suspend 
all arrest warrants against those involved in the agrarian 
struggles." Lopez Moreno said that they will "examine" the 
current situation of human rights activist Enrique Perez Lopez 
who was arrested on Sunday. 
  The agreement was signed last night by SAR Secretary Victor 
Cervera Pacheco, Chiapas Governor Javier Lopez Moreno, 
Government Deputy Secretary Jose Narro Robles, and 
representatives of 22 CEOIC organizations following an over 
six-hour meeting -- from 1700 until after 2300 -- at the SAR 
offices. 
  In conclusion, it was established that to avoid further 
occupations of land and to attend to new requests for land, the 
governor, a CEOIC representative, and a small landowners 
representative will meet in Tuxtla Gutierrez soon to "examine 
the agrarian situation and jointly suggest new alternatives for 
the solution of the problems." A bank official, as well as 
federal and state officials involved in agrarian matters, will 
also be invited to the meeting. 
  Meanwhile, it was learned that CEOIC and the Zapata Lives 
National Liberation Coordinating Board will march from the 
Zocalo to the Chamber of Deputies headquarters to demand changes 
to Article 27 of the Constitution.

<F P=106> [Report by Jesus Sanchez] </F>
  [Text] A risky step backward. It is barely discernible, 
but the internal confrontation within the PRI [Institutional 
Revolutionary Party] is devastating. 
  The changes following Luis Donaldo Colosio's assassination 
have not been easy. Representatives of the political class, 
including the dinosaurs and the technocrats, have been 
conducting tough negotiations surrounding the presidential 
candidacy of Ernesto Zedillo to ensure the survival of the 
Colosio and the PRI political program. 
  Just hours after the Lomas Taurinas crime, confusion was the 
recurring factor in the process to choose Zedillo. 
  Low blows and unorganized promotion campaigns. 
Unintentionally, according to his helpers and political 
companions, Amador Rodriguez Lozano [head of the PRI Secretariat 
for Electoral Action] was brought face to face with President 
Salinas and Zedillo: the intention was none other than to make 
it appear as if Fernando Ortiz Arana was trying to slip 
everybody a fast one. 
  But days before his death, Colosio had decided to make 
changes in the PRI leadership. During Holy Week, Cesar Augusto 
Santiago, a friend of Colosio and Ortiz Arana, was expected to 
replace Jose Luis Lamadrid Sauza as PRI secretary general. 
  During those days Ortiz Arana had been the target of a 
campaign to remove him from the PRI national leadership; the 
campaign was ordered by the Xola government offices. This 
campaign announced the nomination of Emilio Gamboa Patron or 
Carlos Hank Gonzalez, or the natural transition to Francisco 
Ruiz Massieu. 
  With Colosio's death, his followers became the weakest group 
within the PRI and the non-Colosio groups started to settle 
accounts, given their previous status as underdogs. 
<H5>  The Groups </H5>
  The Zedillo team was quick to open its way among the Colosio 
followers. 
  The stamp of the new team is Hankism [referring to Carlos 
Hank Gonzalez], the powerful group with roots in Atlacomulco. 
Former Governors Ignacio Pichardo Pagaza and Alfredo Baranda 
(who only had a brief dream of becoming Santiago Onate's 
successor; instead, Jose Angel Gurria won by a nose) in addition 
to former government secretary general Humberto Lira Mora, were 
to take up key positions to give the campaign a different style 
from that of Colosio. 
  Jose Luis Lamadrid Sauza -- a member of the compact group 
created by Jose Cordoba Montoya -- to which Zedillo also 
belongs, was removed from the maelstrom and placed out of the 
reach of criticism: into the presidency of the Consultative 
Committee of the Change 21 Foundation, now called the Luis 
Donaldo Colosio Foundation, a job that was specially created for 
the Jalisco State senator. 
  Amador Rodriguez Lozano, tasked with the PRI's electoral 
program -- created by Cesar Augusto Santiago five years ago -- 
was appointed Zedillo's adviser. In turn, Rodriguez was replaced 
by Humberto Lira Mora, from Mexico State. 
  Liebano Saenz -- a native of Chihuahua State who wants to 
become a senator or governor -- was removed from Information and 
Propaganda and became Zedillo's private secretary, which will 
help him achieve his objectives. 
  Santiago Onate Laborde, a well-known jurist who worked in 
the 
Secretariat for International Affairs, was neutralized by 
placing him in charge of the Office of the Presidency, a post 
that he took over without the power of Cordoba Montoya. Onate 
is a key member of the Colosio group. 
<H5>  The Internal Crisis </H5>
  Information provided to EL FINANCIERO by several key actors 
allows one to ascertain that the recomposition of the Zedillo 
team has generated a severe internal crisis within the PRI. 
  In the offices of the Secretariat for Electoral Action the 
afternoon of Thursday 24 March, Hector Landeros -- a mechanical 
engineer who admires Manuel Camacho, is loyal to Javier Garcia 
Paniagua, and is tasked with legitimizing the topics and 
coordinating the debates of the PRI electoral program -- issued 
an order to the personnel who were working at the time in the 
operations center of what is known nowadays as electoral 
engineering. 
  The order was: Call everyone you know and tell them that we 
must support Ortiz Arana. 
  Jesus Perez Pinon -- an electoral design specialist who 
friends say has good intentions -- eagerly began the task of 
promoting Ortiz Arana as the presidential candidate, even though 
this had not been ordered by Amador Rodriguez. Hipolito Garnica 
followed suit. 
  Faxes and photocopies of a document were also issued by 
that office [Electoral Action Secretariat] giving six reasons 
why Ortiz Arana should be nominated presidential candidate. 
  "Because he is our symbol 
  "Because Ortiz Arana is and represents change 
  "Because he, and only he, is our presidential candidate." 
  The document was prepared on a computer. It carried the PRI 
logo crossed with the date 21 August [date of Mexican elections] 
and the words "Colosio yes" on the upper right side. It was 
sent via fax to some state leadership committees. 
  One of [Amador] Rodriguez Lozano's aides, who refused to 
support the campaign "because there were no instructions from 
our boss, Amador," said that from the CEN presidency, Ortiz 
Arana stopped "the strange" campaign. 
  Sources that were consulted assure us that Amador Rodriguez 
did not contrive this campaign; "it was handled clumsily," the 
informants say. First of all because the Colosist team knew the 
decision would fall on Ernesto Zedillo, who is from the same 
region as Rodriguez Lozano. The PRI electoral program had been 
drawn up throughout nearly five years, led by Colosio and 
designed by the team at that time of Cesar Augusto Santiago 
Ramirez, from Chiapas. 
  Rodriguez Lozano was left heading the PRI electoral program, 
which had been tested in the 1991 federal elections and the 
elections in Mexico, Yucatan, and Morelos States. 
  The Baja California deputy aspired to a Senate seat from his 
state. With Zedillo's appointment, Rodriguez Lozano would not 
only have implemented the designed and tested electoral program 
but his aspirations would have been fulfilled without difficulty. 
  Nevertheless, the "inexplicable" promotion campaign not only 
brought Rodriguez Lozano face to face with Zedillo and President 
Salinas, but also exposed Ortiz Arana. 
  The truth is that the appeals to the state leadership 
committees created a climate of confusion among the PRI members. 
<H5>  Ortiz Arana, Securing Support </H5>
  Hours after Colosio's assassination, reporters spoke with 
Ortiz Arana. It was clear that the only possible formulas for 
the presidential candidacy were Zedillo and Ortiz Arana. In 
Dolores pantheon, Ortiz Arana commented: 
  Believe me, boys, the only thing I aspire to in my political 
career is the Senate of the republic and to govern my state. I 
do not want to be a presidential candidate. As PRI president, I 
would not want to have an advantage over anyone. The country 
and their stability are above anything else. 
  Ortiz ruled himself out on the morning of 29 March. Hours 
earlier he had secured the support of 69 members of the National 
Political Council to oppose a possible reform of constitutional 
Article 82, which paradoxically was ready in Los Pinos. 
  A high-ranking PRI member said that if Article 82 had been 
reformed, the array of possible candidates to replace Colosio 
would have been so broad that the PRI would have crumpled until 
it fell apart. 
  Other negotiations were held as events developed. Ortiz 
Arana owes his political career to his ability, but also to the 
loyalty and trust of the president of the republic. He was 
leader of the Assembly for Salinas, chief of the PRI legislative 
faction with the approval of the president, and PRI national 
leader also because of the president. 
  The opinion of the governors was controlled by the president 
of the Republic. The consensus of the old political class still 
had to be secured. 
  The governors helped secure an agreement suggested by 
Salinas 
to obtain public support for Zedillo's candidacy from former 
government secretaries, including Javier Garcia Paniagua, 
Francisco Merino Rabago, Antonio Ortiz Mena, and Carlos Tello 
Macias. 
  It was up to Ortiz Arana to obtain public support from some 
80 former governors, who had already committed themselves to 
publicly supporting Colosio. They now did so for Zedillo. 
  The campaigns against Ortiz Arana continue, and now the 
rumors talk of Pichardo Pagaza's quick ascent to the PRI 
national presidency and Esteban Moctezuma's ascent to the 
secretary general's post. Such advances would show that the 
Colosists had been displaced.

  [Text] Mexico City, 18 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- Ernesto Zedillo, 
presidential candidate for the ruling Institutional 
Revolutionary Party (PRI), is ahead of his opponents with 45.4 
percent of voter preference, according to a study released today. 
  A poll conducted by the S.C. Opinion Study Cabinet [Gabinete 
de Estudios de Opinion S.C.] reported that Zedillo was followed 
by Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, candidate for the Democratic 
Revolutionary Party, and Diego Fernandez de Cevallos of the 
National Action Party with 11.4 and 8.9 percent, respectively. 
The other six candidates obtained 6.7 percent support, while 
27.6 percent of the voters have not reached a final decision. 
  Elections will be held on 21 August in Mexico to choose the 
next president of the republic and to renew the Chambers of 
Deputies and Senators. 
  The third preelection poll published this Monday by EL 
NACIONAL newspaper revealed that there is confidence in the 
electoral register and that people feel voting will be respected 
in the upcoming elections. 
  As part of the 63-question survey, some 1,100 people were 
polled in 17 states throughout the country between 7 and 10 
April, in accordance with a multi-period [polietapico] survey 
through which it was inferred that 75 percent of those polled 
considered the new electoral register reliable. 
  Zedillo, who replaced former PRI presidential candidate Luis 
Donaldo Colosio -- murdered on 23 March in the border town of 
Tijuana -- "enjoys the support of a clear majority of the 
supporters of the ruling party," the newspaper reported. 
"Despite the magnitude of the tragic events leading to the 
assassination of Colosio, the voting intentions of citizens were 
hardly affected," EL NACIONAL added. 
  Marcela Lombardo of the Popular Socialist Party, Rafael 
Aguila for the Cardenist Front for National Reconstruction 
Party, and Jorge Gonzalez for Mexican Green Ecologist Party are 
also participating in the elections, as are Alvaro Peraza for 
the Authentic Party of the Mexican Revolution, Cecilia Soto for 
the Labor Party, and Pablo Emilio Madero for the National 
Opposition Union. 
  The survey also found that 53 percent of those polled termed 
President Salinas' administration positive, while 7 percent 
described it as unfavorable.

<F P=106> [Report by Carlos Vigueras] </F>
  [Text] Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua, 12 Apr -- In the new era 
of NAFTA, contraband continues to be a burden to the detriment 
of the national economy and to the benefit of informal trade, 
which grows uncontrollably under the protection of organized 
contraband mafias, the customs authorities themselves, and 
politicians in top government positions who protect smugglers. 
  At the culmination of this six-year period is a country 
overrun by uncertainty, in an infrastructure of customs 
corruption, interwoven in a vicious circle that includes 
merchants, businessmen, and authorities who protect it -- a 
system that has remained untouched, surviving the ups and downs 
of international trade as confirmed by the fact that in only one 
of the sections of corruption rampant in Ciudad Juarez, 
approximately $800 million a year in illegal goods are imported 
from duty-free stores in EL Paso. 
  Customs corruption is so extensive that it is possible to 
illegally import whole containers loaded with beans, poultry, 
lard, lubricating oil, new or old tires, potatoes, used clothes, 
furniture, used vehicles, tools, toys, textiles, household 
appliances, computer equipment, spare parts, or any other item 
that can result in profits, which in turn extends from the 
lowest to the highest officials within the Finance and Public 
Credit Secretariat. 
  It has been pointed out that the uncontrolled import of 
illegal goods originating from the United States is a blatant 
example of covert impunity. It is also been said that this 
impunity is being encouraged by Finance Secretariat officials 
despite numerous complaints to this effect filed by private 
sources. 
  However, this is only a sample of the lucrative business 
that 
extends from Reynosa all the way up to Tijuana and includes the 
18 Mexican border customs posts which, far from defending the 
extensive border, merely proceed to get rich during the "year of 
Hidalgo." According to a study entitled "Mexico-USA, the Border 
of Poverty," this activity paves the way for scandalous tax 
evasion involving millions, thus blocking the country's 
development. 
  The study reveals that during 1993, according to preliminary 
estimates, the illegal importation of U.S., European, and 
Asian-made goods originating from the United States, all on the 
fringe of legal import activities between both countries, could 
have totaled nearly $20 billion. This amount fosters the large 
market dominated by an underground economy controlled by a 
contraband mafia headed by well-known businessmen and corrupt 
politicians who have leased the border to the detriment of the 
country's tax revenues and even its development. 
  It has been possible to establish that outside the El Paso 
duty-free stores, near Ciudad Juarez's international Reforma 
Bridge, vans bearing Chihuahua, Texas, and New Mexico license 
plates transport an alarming quantity of goods to Mexico on a 
daily basis. These vehicles are loaded to capacity, and the 
Ciudad Juarez customs authorities normally accept bribes ranging 
between $3,000 and $5,000 per vehicle. Approximately 50 vans 
pass through this international bridge daily. 
  It is a well-known fact that Mexican citizens returning from 
the United States through this point are allowed by the Finance 
and Public Credit Secretariat to import $50 per person 
duty-free. Nonetheless, vehicles transporting contraband tend to 
smuggle amounts sometimes totaling up to $100,000 per vehicle. 
Considering the cost of some goods imported legally such as 
Rolex watches, costing somewhere between $2,000 and $10,000, or 
other expensive products independent of the large volume of 
jewelry, perfumes, wines, and liquors, this adds up to enormous 
sums of money." [quotation mark as published] 
  This does not even take into account that the Reforma 
Bridge lacks import facilities, and therefore, they have no 
reason to cross this bridge. The analysis by the Mexican-U.S. 
Center for Border Studies reveals that several mafias control 
contraband of various types with profit margins of up to 70 
percent as is the case with liquor, expensive watches like 
Rolexes, and other products purchased at duty-free shops brought 
from the United States under preferential tariffs. The former 
is the case of the English whiskey Johnny Walker, Spanish 
brandies, and sophisticated French liquors. It adds that border 
transactions of this type make their profits mainly from 
catering to a select Mexican clientele that buys the goods 
wholesale to resell them to a special group. 
  The study emphasizes that luxury watches from England, 
Switzerland, and other European countries, like the famous 
Rolex, are purchased according to the taste of select Mexican 
buyers, who obtain the merchandise through the contraband kings 
with the respective profits. The same process applies to 
expensive French perfumes, which can only be found in Mexican 
shops at exorbitant prices, and to a huge amount of jewels. 
However, the study reveals that computers and electric 
appliances represent a larger volume compared to the over $42 
million a year earned from the consumption of cigarettes from 
the United States and other European countries. 
  Regarding the expensive liquors that yield profit margins of 
over 70 percent, it is estimated that some $150 million worth of 
wines and liquors of the most prestigious worldwide brands -- 
bought at the so-called duty free shops in El Paso, Texas -- 
cross this border. This is a common occurrence, to a smaller 
or a greater extent, at other points along the U.S.-Mexican 
border that also cater to the finest demands of Mexican 
consumers in a specialized manner. 
  Some 200 or 300 vans known as "venaditas" pay customs 
officials some $60,000 daily, and each vehicle pays between $200 
and $300 to introduce merchandise illegally into Mexico. 
  Sources for this information are public complaints, in 
addition to thorough journalistic investigation that graphically 
shows vans filled with food products, motor oil, and other 
products that are being taken to a warehouse in Ciudad Juarez. 
These products are mainly picked up by the Economy Cash and 
Carry company, which belongs to Mike Dipp, a wealthy 
businessman, and his associates. Current investigations reveal 
that the customs office in Ciudad Juarez is one of the leading 
ones nationwide in allowing the entry of condoned contraband, 
and that customs official Carlos Aguilar is certainly aware that 
the goods ["pollas"] are picked up daily from the three 
international bridges on the border between Ciudad Juarez and 
Texas. Of the three bridges, the San Geronimo Bridge -- which 
borders New Mexico -- is the most widely used because it has 
little surveillance and customs officials are not at risk of 
being seen by occasional local tourists. 
  Finally, the study points to customs administrators in 
Ciudad 
Juarez, Carlos Aguilar and Luis Manuel Terrazas -- who is 
currently the customs administrator in Nuevo Laredo -- as 
officials who have established a chain from Ciudad Juarez to the 
border to ensure their absolute control of the contraband 
stemming from Texas, the leading exporting state in the United 
States. Texas exported $23 million in 1993. 
  This situation has created a network of nepotism within 
customs personnel on both sides of the border and resulted in 
the blatant enrichment of their families since they assumed 
their posts since Carlos Aguilar and Luis Manuel Terrazas have 
formed a monopoly [un enroque de puestos].

  [Text] Mexico City, April 20 KYODO -- Mexico's Trade 
Ministry said Wednesday [20 April] it has begun an investigation 
into alleged dumping of sulfuric acid, used in fertilizer 
production, by seven foreign companies, including five Japanese 
concerns. 
  The five Japanese companies include Dowa Mining Co., 
Mitsubishi Materials Corp., and Japan Energy Corp. The names of 
the two other Japanese concerns were not known immediately. 
  The ministry said the five Japanese firms are alleged to 
have 
shipped sulfuric acid for fertilizer use at prices below fair 
value between January and June in 1993. 
  During the period, the value of sulfuric acid imported from 
Japan fell by 13 percent, the ministry said. 
  The ministry did not disclose other details.

<F P=106> [By Cristina Hasbun de Merino] </F>
  [Text] San Salvador, 16 Apr (ACAN-EFE) -- Armando Calderon 
Sol, the government's candidate for the presidency of El 
Salvador, asserts that violence must be fought with "prompt and 
efficient" justice. That is why he supports the constitutional 
reforms currently being debated in the Legislative Assembly. In 
an interview with ACAN-EFE, the candidate for the rightist 
Nationalist Republican Alliance (ARENA), said he knew an 
"independent justice" was needed to convince Salvadorans not to 
"take justice into their own hands." 
  A special Salvadoran parliamentary commission is currently 
studying several bills to reform the Constitution, including 
several reforms to the Judicial Branch, recommended by the Truth 
Commission that investigated human rights violations that 
occurred from 1980 until the signing of the peace agreements in 
1992. 
  Calderon and Ruben Zamora, the candidate for the leftist 
coalition that includes the former guerrilla, will hold a runoff 
election on 24 April to determine who will occupy the presidency 
of the country for the next five years. A second electoral 
round is a constitutional requirement when none of the parties 
obtains an absolute majority of votes in the first round. This 
runoff must be disputed between the two parties that obtained 
the most votes. 
  "We approve of anything that will help us improve the 
administration of justice to consolidate the division of power 
in El Salvador as this is the linchpin of a democratic state," 
Calderon Sol stated. But he has also been one of the harshest 
critics of the Truth Commission's report. This organization, 
whose members were appointed by the United Nations with the 
support of the signers of the peace pacts, maintains that the 
Salvadoran judicial system is "extremely lacking" and, in 
addition to constitutional reforms at issue, recommended that 
all Supreme Court of Justice magistrates resign. But the 
magistrates continue in their posts, and if the reforms of the 
judicial system are not approved by the current Legislative 
Assembly, whose term ends on 30 April, they will be delayed at 
least four years because the reforms have to be approved by one 
parliament and ratified by the next. 
  Calderon Sol also said he was willing to back the 
postponement of the mandate of the "Joint Group," a special 
commission that investigates the existence of the "death 
squads," if it is requested, to ensure the group's 
effectiveness. At the suggestion of the United Nations, 
President Alfredo Cristiani installed the Joint Group on 8 
December, after three main leaders of the former guerrilla, 
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front [FMLN], were murdered. 
This group investigates the political murders committed since 
the peace agreement was signed in January 1992 and must submit a 
report to UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali and Cristiani 
by the end of May. 
  "If they (the members of the Joint Group) ask for a 
postponement, it will have to be granted. They also have to be 
given support to increase their chances for positive results," 
Calderon, a 45-year-old lawyer and former San Salvador mayor, 
stated. He added: "We expect positive results to put an end to 
this situation, assign punishments, and clarify things. Only in 
this way will we be able to advance to freedom and democracy in 
our country. We have to ensure that the groups that engage in 
selective violence are forever eradicated in El Salvador." 
  According to the Truth Commission's report, the "death 
squads" are ultra-rightist, clandestine groups formed by or 
having links to the military and financed by powerful 
businessmen, politicians, and landowners. Leaders of leftist 
political parties and organizations have asserted those violent 
groups are linked to ARENA members, and that is why the 
government has not acted firmly in the investigations. 
Cristiani and other officials have rejected such charges. 
  Calderon Sol exhorted people to "reject violence from every 
quarter," saying that he was sure to win the new elections 
which, he said, will ensure political stability in the country. 
Likewise, he manifested his confidence that the FMLN, which has 
become into the second-ranking parliamentary force since the 20 
March elections, will mount "a loyal opposition and be able to 
show the world that it has effectively entered democratic life." 
  Calderon admitted the elections have given the former 
guerrillas "an important quota of power, as has been expressed 
in the ballot boxes, in parliamentary seats. Nobody denies the 
fact that it is strongly represented in the Legislative 
Assembly."

  [Text] San Salvador, 19 Apr (AFP) -- Armando Calderon Sol, 
the right-wing presidential candidate for the ruling Nationalist 
Republican Alliance, could garner as much as 70 percent of the 
votes cast in next Sunday's runoff election in which he will vie 
for the presidency against Ruben Zamora, who was nominated by a 
leftist coalition, an Argentine polling firm announced on 19 
April. 
  According to Mora y Araujo Noguera y Asociados, this figure 
is based on voter surveys conducted since August 1993. Some 
1,200 people were surveyed in each poll with a margin of error 
of 3 percent. 
  The latest poll shows 52 percent of those polled expect to 
vote for Calderon Sol and 22 percent for Zamora. Over the past 
three weeks, support for the government of President Alfredo 
Cristiani, which has a positive support rating of 68 percent, 
has risen. 
  In the first round of the elections held on 20 March, 
Calderon received 49 percent of the vote, while Zamora garnered 
25 percent. Zamora lost a great deal of support from December to 
January and has not been able to regain it, the report added. 
It also estimated voter participation will drop 10 percent 
compared to the first round in which 68 percent of eligible 
voters did not go to the polls, and another 6 percent were 
unable to vote, even though they tried to.

<F P=106> [From the "YSU Radio News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] A few minutes ago COPAZ [National Commission for the 
Consolidation of Peace] representatives presented proposals, 
already delivered to the Legislative Assembly, for the 
constitutional reforms recommended in the peace agreements. 
Marcos Balladares, National Conciliation Party representative 
to COPAZ, disclosed the result of the consensus COPAZ had 
reached to send this proposal to the Legislative Assembly within 
the framework of the implementation of constitutional reforms in 
our country. 
  [Begin recording] [Balladares] There are three areas. The 
first is in the Judicial Branch. A consensus has been reached 
to deliver to the honorable Legislative Assembly that which 
concerns judicial issues. That is: the Supreme Court of Justice 
should not appoint and dismiss the magistrates and the judges in 
the diverse institutions of the Judicial Branch. 
  Second, the National Council of the Judiciary should be in 
charge of making these appointments and these dismissals. 
  The third point is to review in a bit more detail the 
mechanisms of the National Council of the Judiciary's 
integration and its duties. This should be done in view of the 
new duties that the very National Council of the Judiciary may 
be awarded within these constitutional reforms. This is in 
relation to the the Judicial Branch, specifically concerning 
judges and magistrates. These are the agreements reached by 
consensus in COPAZ that have already been delivered to the 
Legislative Assembly. 
  There has also been consensus with regard to the attorneys. 
In this regard COPAZ agreed that it should definitely not be 
the Supreme Court of Justice that authorizes or suspends 
attorneys. This is an issue broadly debated in the diverse 
forums of our nation, and COPAZ has basically resolved that it 
should not be the Supreme Court of Justice that authorizes or 
suspends the attorneys. 
  On this point, however, COPAZ's proposal goes even further 
and is much more practical [words indistinct] indicating that 
this is a function equal to the medical profession's oversight 
board. This is another issue that has even been analyzed in 
other forums and by other institutions, given that the National 
Council of the Judiciary's, through its seven oversight boards, 
has been very effective in its operation and in its oversight of 
the associations. COPAZ considers this should be something 
similar to an oversight board that exists in the medical 
profession that should have those specific duties with regard to 
the attorneys. 
  As far as due process is concerned, there are some 
resolutions that COPAZ had taken that basically consist in 
reducing administrative detention provided for in [word 
indistinct] second, Article 13, from 62 to 48 hours. As you 
know when someone is detained by the administrative authorities, 
they have a maximum of 62 hours to be remanded over to the 
court. This is what is provided for in the Constitution. That 
is, administrative authorities have a maximum of 62 hours for 
this. Well, COPAZ's proposal is aimed at reducing this maximum 
of 62 hours to a maximum of 48 hours before being handed over to 
the court. This is also a resolution made by consensus that we 
think will help speed up the administration of justice in our 
country. 
  In another point related to due process in Article 14, 
administrative authorities no longer will have the power to 
impose sanctions, or [word indistinct] detentions against 
individuals. Currently... [pauses] here is a little background. 
In the previous Constitution the administrative authority could 
impose sanctions -- of course after due process, before a 
procedure, and the handing down of a sentence. The 
administrative authority previously could order up to 30 days' 
detention. The 1983 Constitution reduced this period to 15 
days. Therefore, the current Constitution provides that the 
administrative authority can impose detentions of up to 15 days. 
Well, COPAZ's proposal, through consensus, is that the 
administrative authorities can no longer issue any detention 
orders. 
  On this point, COPAZ has been specific and clear that there 
is an exception in this regard. This has also been communicated 
to the Legislative Assembly. That is, it is proposed that 
administrative authorities should not be able to issue detention 
orders except in the case of military jurisdiction and in the 
case of the National Civilian Police, when internal regulations 
are violated in those two institutions. [end recording]

  [Text] Foreign Minister Ernesto Paz Aguilar said yesterday 
that in light of the new global situation it is necessary to 
review the cooperation treaty Honduras and the United States 
signed in 1954 in order to redirect relations between the two 
allies. 
  He said: "We are in the post-Cold War period and priorities 
have changed. For this reason Honduras, through its legitimate 
authorities, must point out to the United States the new areas 
on which we must work." 
  These new areas, he said, are basically the struggle against 
drug trafficking and the control of illegal immigrants -- 
something that can be checked under the circumstances of free 
economies, employment opportunities, and democracies capable of 
guaranteeing the human rights of the Central American people. 
  He noted that, personally he has always struggled to keep 
Honduras from becoming the backyard of a superpower. "We said 
this in the 1980's, and we say it now in the 1990's," he 
explained. 
  For the first time, he affirmed, the interests of the United 
States and those of Honduras and the rest of Central America 
coincide because there is a new government in the North American 
country and it has a new foreign policy. 
  The minister added that Honduras is now a mature nation 
ready 
to engage in a new relationship with the United States, adding 
that it is also ready to decide whether there is any sense in 
today's world for Palmerola Air Base to remain a platform for 
military operations at the regional level. 
  "On the contrary," he said, "it is necessary to turn 
Palmerola into a regional center for fighting drug trafficking, 
something that would benefit the United States as well as our 
countries." 
  The civilian utilization of the airstrip, which was designed 
for military purposes, cannot be ruled out. Minister Paz 
Aguilar said, "The only thing we would have to do to turn 
Palmerola into an airport in the country's central region is to 
invest in construction of a terminal." 
  The minister said such changes must be based on new 
attitudes. "We have to discuss the problem of immigration, 
because the Honduran people have quotas restricting their entry 
into the United States, and Eastern European citizens are 
finding it easier than the Latin Americans to enter the United 
States." 
  In conclusion, Minister Paz said no specific date has been 
set yet for reviewing the treaties, because the new phase of 
relations with the United States is just beginning.

<F P=106> [Report by Francisco Valeriano Giron on interview with </F>
Honduran Foreign Minister Ernesto Paz Aguilar by unidentified 
reporters at the Presidential Palace in Tegucigalpa; date not 
given] 
  [Excerpts] Voz de Honduras listeners, we approached Foreign 
Minister Ernesto Paz Aguilar to ask him about changes in the 
foreign service. He said that no decision has been made and 
that the government will allow those ambassadors whose children 
are studying in the country where they are accredited to remain 
in office until the school year is over. At that time, changes 
will be made. Let us hear what the foreign minister has to say 
about changes in the foreign service. 
  [Begin recording] [Paz Aguilar] No changes yet. The 
president will announce these changes at the appropriate time. 
On several occasions I have said the changes suggested have 
been on the president's desk for the past several weeks. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Reporter] Mr. Minister, Ambassador William Pryce has said 
that [words indistinct] analyze the 1954 treaty [word 
indistinct] military protocol [words indistinct]. 
  [Paz Aguilar] We have said the 1954 treaty was signed as a 
result of the Cold War. The treaty was signed 40 years ago and 
it is necessary to revise it according to our current situation. 
  [Reporter] [words indistinct] 
  [Paz Aguilar] It will take a long time to discuss a 
revision. 
These talks would start when the president decides. 
  [Reporter] The Congress and the Armed Forces have already 
started talking about revising the treaty. Is a congressional 
ruling enough to revise the treaty or is a presidential decision 
necessary? 
  [Paz Aguilar] International law sets the procedures for 
revising a treaty. First, we must negotiate the revision. The 
negotiations are conducted by the executive branch. Then the 
Congress must ratify the treaty. After that [words indistinct]. 
  [Reporter] [words indistinct] 
  [Paz Aguilar] I do not think all is bad. They have said that 
they hope the talks between Honduras and the United States 
[words indistinct]. 
  [Reporter] [words indistinct] 
  [Paz Aguilar] We do not know. The president must decide. 
[end recording] 
  Those were statements made by Foreign Minister Ernesto Paz 
Aguilar on the revision of the 1954 Military Assistance Treaty 
with the United States. The minister explained the procedures 
for a situation of this nature. He was emphatic in stating the 
government has not made changes in the foreign service.

  [Text] General Luis Alonso Discua, commander of the Armed 
Forces, yesterday admitted that the military has advised 
Congress to update the 1954 Military Assistance Treaty with the 
United States "to be consistent with the current situation." 
  The military chief indicated that every day U.S. economic 
aid 
is minimized and conditioned on various situations. 
  "It is assistance conditioned on many situations, even on 
sanctions by the U.S. Government, because of U.S. preoccupation 
with domestic policy. Nevertheless, I think the 1954 agreement 
is necessary," he said. 
  According to Gen. Discua, the state should review both the 
agreement and the two protocols signed by the two governments in 
subsequent years. 
  "The Armed Forces are proposing the review because we are no 
longer in the Cold War or an ideological war. In other words, 
the world situation has changed completely. Therefore, the 
agreements must be reviewed to update them according to the 
current situation," he commented. 
  Discua indicated that certain rules are established in these 
types of agreements. "We can see that in the treaty and in the 
protocols there are many things that no longer agree with 
current times," he added. 
  He explained that the military wants to update the documents 
to see what commitments Honduras has as a state as a result of 
the military aid. 
  "We are not asking for benefits. I think the rules of the 
game have already been established. The U.S. Government has 
been very clear by reducing defense expenditures," he indicated. 
  "Treaties are no longer bilateral agreements but 
multilateral 
agreements on integration and globalization. In other words, it 
is a new foreign policy," he added. 
  For the military chief, the treaties signed in the 1950's 
reflect a clear anticommunist position to strengthen democracy 
and to cope with the Cold War and the ideological war. The U.S. 
Government has set the rules of the game by promoting the 
changes, he said. 
  Asked whether the Armed Forces favor a military presence in 
Palmerola, he indicated that "they state that it is the will and 
they are at the disposal of the Honduran Government and policy." 
[sentence as published] 
  "We are now advising Congress to analyze this agreement, 
without violating international regulations and laws, and 
without seeking confrontation," he said. 
  "We want the agreement to be updated in accordance with the 
new U.S. political agenda for the region and for Honduras. I 
think that is fair," he stressed. 
  He recalled that the Armed Forces have presented to the 
legislative branch a suggestion. "We clearly understand that it 
is up to the civilian power to decide what it wants or what 
should be done," he added.

  [Text] Although National Congress President Carlos Roberto 
Flores has explained that any action involving the military 
treaty signed with the United States in 1954 concerns the 
president of the Republic, he stated on 19 April that it is 
important for the treaty to be discussed, because it may no 
longer reflect the current situation. 
  Flores revealed that so far he has only received unofficial 
information regarding the intention of General Discua, commander 
in chief of the Armed Forces and head of the Supreme Council of 
the Armed Forces, to seek a rejection of the treaty. 
  Flores said, "The president is the one who has jurisdiction 
and responsibility for negotiating international agreements and 
treaties, and any action in this regard concerns him." 
  Flores explained that the matter is being discussed by the 
executive branch and will not be taken up by the legislative 
branch until the executive reaches a decision and informs 
Congress officially. He also said the correct term in this case 
is to reject [denunciar] the treaty -- an action that includes 
discussing possible disagreements and conveying any criticisms 
to the other nation. 
  Flores added: "The Armed Forces are part of the executive 
branch, and any idea must be discussed with the constitutional 
president and other branches such as the legislative branch." 
Asked whether the treaty is truly obsolete, as argued by Gen. 
Luis Alonso Discua, Flores replied that circumstances that 
prevailed years ago no longer exist. 
  Flores noted: "In the past decade, Central America was 
subject to different pressures, conflicts, and domestic 
problems. Governments outside the realm of de jure states, 
political disputes, and related situations no longer exist at 
this time, because all of the governments have been elected by 
popular vote." 
  He concluded: "The situation has changed radically."

<F P=106> [Report by Susy Castillo; from the "Extravision" newscast; </F>
passages within quotation marks recorded] 
  [Text] [Castillo] For the first time, and before a battery 
of journalists, former President Daniel Ortega, FSLN [Sandinist 
National Liberation Front] secretary general, has commented on 
the so-called currents of opinion that have emerged within 
Sandinism in anticipation of the upcoming FSLN congress in May: 
  [Ortega] "Sandinism is the most democratic expression among 
this country's political forces, as clearly reflected by the 
many compatriots voicing views that are even contradictory. It 
is democracy at work." 
  [Castillo] The media have termed the differences among the 
various groups as currents within Sandinism, but Ortega has 
called them opinions [estados de opinion]. 
  [Ortega] "We do not call them currents. I call them 
established opinions. There are no currents established in the 
FSLN. There are established opinions, established groups. I 
think these positions are part of the democratic game that has 
emerged with great force within Sandinism. I think nobody 
should feel ashamed for his position. 
  "I would be ashamed if I stopped fighting along with the 
people and the poor, if I became an instrument of Capitalists, 
of the rich, and the bourgeoisie, and if I surrendered and knelt 
before imperialism. I would be ashamed by those things." 
  [Castillo] Why is there talk of establishing a new FSLN, a 
more democratic FSLN? Is the FSLN undemocratic? 
  [Ortega] "This is a new kind of democratic process that 
started with the previous FSLN congress. We held an election; 
it was a normal election, normal for political parties, 
revolutionary as well as Social Democratic ones; it was an 
election based on tickets [eleccion por plancha]. 
  "Thus, we established democratic mechanisms. For the first 
time, in 1991, the FSLN discussed a program and statutes; it 
approved programs and statutes. That had never happened in FSLN 
history. This was done democratically; that is, democracy made 
its appearance within Sandinism in a new form in 1991. We must 
now continue to strengthen democracy. 
  "In closing the 1991 congress, speaking on behalf of the 
FSLN 
directorate, I told participants that at the next congress we 
would have to become more democratic. I added that this would 
entail incorporating women in all groups of leadership, 
including the National Directorate, that the elections for all 
posts should be done by secret ballots, and that there should be 
individual candidates, not tickets. 
  "Thus, this is nothing new. These are issues we already 
discussed and announced. We called a congress precisely because 
we want to renew and increase democracy within Sandinism. This 
was my initiative. I consulted it with my fellow directorate 
members on 19 July and announced it in the square, and the 
Sandinist Assembly approved it later." 
  [Castillo] For the first time, Ortega admitted differences 
within Sandinism that stem from a confusing position toward the 
government. 
  [Unidentified reporter] "What is the main difference? 
  [Ortega] "I think the main difference concerns the fact that 
in 1990, with the change of government, we defined a policy 
toward this government that was not very clear, a policy that 
bred confusion. This position prompted a sector of Sandinism to 
follow one line and another sector to follow another; in other 
words, our position toward the government has, in fact, divided 
Sandinists. 
  "This is why when we say that during the congress we must 
reach a consensus regarding our position toward the government, 
we must do so with the conviction that it will reunify and 
strengthen us. 
  Concerning the United States, Sandinists must reach a single 
position toward this country regarding our methods of struggle. 
I am talking about very specific aspects that lead to the 
emergence of different positions, even contradictions, as the 
ones we have seen. 
  "Thus, we must not overlook contradictions. The way to 
confront contradictions is through organized and orderly 
discussions through a (?special) congress, which we already 
summoned."

  [Text] Daniel Ortega, FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation 
Front] secretary general, last night said the ESAF [Enhanced 
Structural Adjustment Facility] poses a "very serious threat to 
Nicaragua." He believes the economic measures agreed upon with 
international financial organizations "will not achieve their 
intended goals." 
  "The government proposal is wrong," Ortega insisted during a 
debate televised by Canal Cuatro. 
  Hours earlier, during a news conference, Presidency Minister 
Antonio Lacayo said the ESAF is not a new "harsh experience" for 
the country but, instead, an opportunity to pay on a lower debt 
to the Paris Club, grant more financing to agricultural 
production, and have more schools and health centers. 
  While issuing a warning about possible social unrest in the 
country, the Sandinist leader described the government as "blind 
or ill-intentioned" for imposing its policy at all costs as part 
of "a position that has become reckless." 
  Ortega added, "We would be the first to support the measures 
if we were certain that production and employment would rise 
after a certain period of time." 
  He questioned the decisionmaking process that led to these 
economic decisions, and he noted, "the government is responsible 
for taking into account the various social, economic, and 
political segments of the population before making a decision on 
such an important issue. The government failed to do this and 
has been applying these measures since May 1993." 
  "These measures were decided [comprometidas] and issued from 
above, and this undermines government trust and credibility. 
They pointed a pistol at those sectors consulted," he said. 
  The FSLN secretary general said some viable alternatives to 
ESAF include making more flexible the granting of loans, 
adjusting bank interest rates, avoiding attacks on properties 
through debts with the financial system [as published], 
protecting national production, and seeking a renegotiation of 
our foreign debt. 
  The feasibility of these measures proposed by the FSLN could 
be accepted by international financial organizations if the 
government had "the political resolve to confront the 
international financial organizations," Ortega said. 
  He added, "If the government had the support of political 
and 
economic forces, it would be in a favorable position to reach 
agreements of this sort." 
  Ortega replied to charges leveled hours earlier by Minister 
Lacayo on the foreign debt acquired by Nicaragua during his 
tenure. 
  The former president said one must understand the reason 
behind that debt, and he added that the financing terms were 
favorable to the country. 
  Ortega pointed out that a good part of that financing served 
to supply Nicaraguan producers with inexpensive raw materials, 
spare parts, and machinery. 
<H5>  Popular Support </H5>
  Throughout his presentation, Ortega stressed that his party 
is only warning about the consequences of ESAF. 
  "The FSLN is not seeking support for its positions. It is 
issuing a warning about the risk of these economic policies. 
When a conservative segment, such as the producers, takes to 
the streets to protest, it is because we have a profound 
crisis," Ortega added. When asked about a possible wave of 
popular protests or violence because of these economic 
decisions, Ortega said: "Only a rectification on the part of the 
government will prevent riots and protests such as those that 
occurred in the past. Neither the FSLN nor I will provoke the 
riots; the government's policies will." 
  The Sandinist leader said his party must support the demands 
of segments of the population who are hurt by the ESAF. 
  As for limits to the popular protests, Ortega said, "This is 
a very complex situation, and the FSLN cannot produce some sort 
of catechism." [sentence as published] 
<H5>  Defending Constitutional Order </H5>
  "We are defending constitutional order. Should the 
government break that order, there are 39 Sandinist deputies and 
other deputies from other forces in the National Assembly who 
would certainly join to defend constitutional order," Ortega 
pointed out. 
  He commented, however, on violent acts such as the burning 
of 
journalist Pablo Emilio Barreto's house and the murder of 219 
Sandinists in Jinotega Department, saying that such explosive 
incidents could result from self-defense groups. 
  In face of this, "we must wonder whether the organization of 
citizens in self-defense brigades would be tolerated, whether 
state authorities are limited in their ability to guarantee 
public safety," Ortega added. 
  The FSLN secretary general said he was not advocating the 
establishment of self-defense groups, but he pointed out that 
situations like this "leave no other option other than the 
creation of self-defense organizations." 
  Ortega said the FSLN would not be at the helm of any 
possible 
social unrest. "We must take into account that social upheavals 
are not planned. We are issuing a warning about a situation 
that could be beyond our control," he added.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Constitutional Reform is a Sham"] </F>
  [Text] What the Sandinist National Liberation Front (FSLN) 
and its allies in the National Assembly are carrying out is not 
a partial reform of the Constitution. Spokesmen for the 
pro-Sandinist parliamentary alliance have said that the draft of 
the constitutional reform consists of approximately 150 
articles, and that in fact amounts to a new constitution, even 
though they shamelessly call it a partial reform. 
  The FSLN and its allies do not want the people to exercise 
their fundamental right to express their true opinion of the 
change in the constitutional order, or to elect delegates to a 
constitutional convention to draft the new basic law of the 
Republic. What we have here, without a doubt, is a pact between 
leaders who pay a lot of lip service to the people and 
democracy, but who ostensibly serve only their personal and 
group interests. 
  Moreover, by drafting a new constitution disguised as a 
partial reform, carried out without consulting the electorate 
and without constituent authority, the FSLN and its associates 
will make formal changes to ensure that little or no real change 
occurs. In other words, they will take away power from an 
executive branch that is subject to influence, and give it to a 
legislative branch that is controlled by the Sandinists. And 
they will expand the government coalition, now called a 
"governability compact," simply putting old wine in new bottles. 
  It is clear that neither partial constitutional reform nor 
the drafting of a new constitution would automatically resolve 
the deep, pervasive crisis that has gripped Nicaragua. There is 
a profound and substantial difference between the two, however: 
Partial reform crafted by a National Assembly controlled by the 
FSLN will inevitably be oriented toward protecting the 
Sandinists' substantial interests, which means leaving the 
principal causes of the crisis untouched. 
  In contrast, a Constitutional Convention elected by the 
people would give us a new constitution that would be the ideal 
legal and political instrument to eradicate totalitarianism, 
restructure the branches of government, and create a true system 
of law, justice, and liberty, which is what the country needs to 
rise up from the prostration in which the pro-Sandinists have 
placed it and where they intend to keep it with their 
constitutional reform.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Emilio Alvarez Montalvan] </F>
  [Text] The visit to Nicaragua by the U.S. undersecretary 
for Latin American affairs cannot be explained away as a 
ceremonial gesture for the American Chamber of Commerce. The 
arrival of this important official should be viewed in a much 
more important context. 
  It is clear that Mr. Watson came not only to give his 
blessing to Mr. Maisto's mission, but also to explain directly 
to the local protagonists how his country's foreign policy is to 
be applied in Nicaragua, which is perceived to be going through 
a transition that is difficult to understand and is also stalled. 
  But what are the parameters of the United States' overall 
strategy, as far as this tiny country is concerned? In this 
regard, Clinton's foreign policy has three objectives: 1) 
maintaining the United States's current status as sole 
superpower, 2) defending democracy and the free market, and 3) 
preventing secondary conflicts in sensitive areas that would not 
be of any benefit to the United States. 
  Nicaragua's case would fall into the latter two premises. It 
is reasonable for Mr. Watson to think that the Nicaraguan 
Government is in a precarious balance. From that point of view, 
Mrs. Chamorro appears to be an isolated hostage who is sending 
an ambiguous message, in contrast to the powerful 
military-social apparatus of the Sandinists who are surrounding 
her. Lacking her own political force, the president is sometimes 
seen to be too timid to make reforms, fearful of losing power, 
while at other times she appears to be a clever collaborator in 
the government coalition recommended by her prime minister and 
relative. 
  In this regard, Mr. Watson must have been tempted to resolve 
this uncomfortable dilemma and, incidentally, to warn his 
interlocutors that time is running short for Nicaragua. Her 
other sisters are already organized, and foreign aid funding is 
shrinking irretrievably. 
  But how could he give advice without appearing to intervene, 
without contradicting the notion that we should solve our 
problems internally? And how could he remain silent, allowing 
the ungovernability and inefficiency to continue in Nicaragua 
and to threaten to spread throughout the region? 
  What he did not do was combine two recipes: assuring Dona 
Violeta that she will remain in place while pointing out to her 
that there are three objectives of the United States' overall 
strategy that have particularly critical ramifications in 
Nicaragua: respect for private property, returning or purchasing 
it as soon as possible; punishment for human rights violators; 
and subjecting the military apparatus to civilian control. 
  Nonetheless, the visitor must have realized that as long as 
there are radical and influential Sandinist leaders who refuse 
to cooperate in stabilizing the country out of fear that they 
will be seen as pawns of the regional power, the problem will 
remain unsolved.... Nor will it be solved if officials continue 
to delay passage of the Organic Law of the Armed Forces, which 
would provide for the reform of a military hierarchy that is 
excessively politicized. 
  To remove these obstacles, the democratic reforms of the 
Sandinist movement, proposed by Dr. Sergio Ramirez Mercado, are 
naturally viewed favorably. It is also logical to insist that 
the Organic Law of the Armed Forces be put in place as soon as 
possible so that the military can come under civilian control. 
  In light of the vested interests, however, there is not much 
likelihood that the desire to blast Nicaragua out of its 
stagnation will be realized. The vicious circle can be broken 
only if the president implements a national political program 
that includes the democratic forces that brought her to power. 
That would allow her to effect the reforms the country is 
demanding and to jump start the economy. Watson's visit, not 
being subliminal, was meaningless.

  [Text] Presidential spokesman Felix Loarca Guzman has said 
that the president of the Republic has the military corps' 
support, and he added that reports disseminated yesterday in the 
capital and in certain military zones are merely rumors. He 
also said the president spent yesterday conducting business as 
usual, as any president would, including attending some 
meetings. One of the meetings was with the boy who will be the 
poster child for this year's telethon. The president later met 
with the finance minister and then worked on a message he will 
address to the nation, possibly today, because he could not do 
it yesterday, given several priority commitments, Loarca Guzman 
emphasized.

  [Text] President Ramiro De Leon Carpio has downplayed 
rumors that five military bases had risen up in the interior of 
the country to topple him. "They are just rumors. I am calm," 
de Leon Carpio said during a long telephone conversation after 
the conclusion of a meeting with the economic cabinet to study 
the tax reforms package that may be submitted to the Congress on 
Thursday. 
  "I paid no attention to the rumors because they are just 
rumors," de Leon Carpio stressed, adding that the army is today 
more united than ever and helping provide security to the 
people, as was seen last night in the streets of this city. 
"Tonight, I reviewed the budget laws with several ministers of 
the economic cabinet, so I did not concern myself with those 
rumors since the people no longer believe them," the presidend 
indicated. 
  De Leon Carpio told LA REPUBLICA: "I do not care about those 
rumors," noting that the military institution has assumed with 
responsibility the job it must perform within the democratic 
process. "We have constitutional order here in Guatemala," he 
affirmed. "Today more than ever, the specter of a coup is far 
away because the army officers are behaving professionally 
within the process the country is going through," the president 
also said. 
  He indicated that this morning he will continue studying the 
package of economic measures, which he could announce tonight to 
the people of Guatemala. To conclude, de Leon Carpio said that 
on Thursday he will leave "with half the cabinet to resume the 
working visits to the interior of the country to see up close 
the problems of the people. This shows nothing is happening, 
that these are just ill-intended rumors that nobody believes."

  [Text] Guatemala City, 20 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- Guatemala's 
National Police reported today that the explosion of two bombs, 
one in the capital and the other in the northern department of 
Quiche, disrupted electricity services. 
  According to the police, one of the bombs exploded Tuesday 
evening in a generator of the National Institute of 
Electrification in Quiche. Apparently, this bomb was placed by 
alleged members of the Guatemalan guerrilla forces operating in 
that region. A military patrol force has been sent to the area 
to search for them, but so far no one has been arrested, the 
source said. 
  The source reported that the other bomb exploded at a 
utility 
pole in the capital's southern Zone 13, briefly interrupting 
electricity services. The explosion destroyed the windows of a 
nearby residence. 
  Some residents of Pamplona, a Zone 13 neighborhood, reported 
that a few minutes before the explosion, a group of unidentified 
people were seen in a car near the area acting suspiciously. 
The police report they have initiated investigations to find 
the people responsible for the two attacks. 
  Last February, the guerrillas claimed responsiblity for the 
destruction of six utility poles in Quiche Department and two 
more in the Guatemalan capital.

<F P=106> [Text of communique issued by Electoral Tribunal in Panama </F>
City on 15 April] 
  [Text] Yesterday, 14 April, the president of the Republic 
addressed citizens via a national radio and television network 
where edited film material, obtained from the archives of the 
Presidency, revealed actions of government officials in the past 
administration. 
  Although the Electoral Tribunal is the leading organization 
in the electoral process, it is not the Electoral Tribunal's 
responsibility to assess this action because, according to the 
Constitution, the Legislative Branch is the only branch 
empowered to judge the public actions of the president of the 
Republic. 
  The Electoral Tribunal magistrates reiterate our 
constitutional independence from the Executive Branch and other 
government organizations. We ratify our commitment to guarantee 
that Panamanian voters will be able to vote freely on 8 May, and 
that their votes will be counted with absolute honesty so that 
those who obtain the majority of the votes will be proclaimed 
the legitimate winners. 
  Issued in Panama City on 15 April 1994 
  Eduardo Valdes Escoffery, President Magistrate 
  Dennis Allen Frias, Vice President Magistrate

<F P=106> [Statement issued by "Panamanians for Democracy, Honesty, </F>
and Civilian Rule" in Panama City, date not given: "Videos. 
National Mission To Vote Against the PRD" -- capitalization as 
published] 
  [Text] The videos aired by the Presidency showed in a 
straightforward fashion how the PRD [Democratic Revolutionary 
Party] used the money of the Panamanian people. THEY TOOK IT AS 
IF IT BELONGED TO THEM while lying and deceiving the people. 
They played with a matter as important as NATIONALISM for their 
personal gain. For 22 years, they made a mockery of the 
nationalist struggle of more than six generations just to remain 
in power and carve out the PIE. How many dead, how many 
students who gave their lives for this nationalist struggle were 
sacrificed by these men for the sake of stealing the people's 
money! They paid off union leaders and then poked fun at them 
during their Cabinet Councils! That is why the national mission 
of all Panamanians without regard for political parties MUST BE 
TO VOTE AGAINST THE PRD. THE PRD IS THE COMMON ENEMY. This is 
no new PRD. It is the same thieving, criminal, embezzling PRD 
that made a mockery of the people, with a false spirit of 
nationalism and which is corrupt to the bone. They are the same 
ones: ERNESTO PEREZ BALLADARES, RIGOBERTO PAREDES, ALFREDO 
ORANGES, CARLOS DUQUE, MARIO ROGNONI, RODOLFO CHIARI, THE 
DIGNITY BATTALION MEMBERS, AND THE CODEPADI [Committee for the 
Defense of the Fatherland and Dignity]. It shamed the people 
that presidential candidate Perez Balladares admitted going to 
the military's meetings at the TINAJITAS garrison to behead 
presidents. As Targidio Bernal [former justice and government 
minister] brazenly stated in the video: "We changed two 
presidents with one crushing blow to the balls." 
  The theft at the Fortuna Dam, one of the hundreds that they 
carried out, raised the project's cost from 250 million balboas 
to 500 million balboas. ALL THAT FILTH AND IMMORALITY regarding 
sinecures, mistresses, and sinecure jobs for $3,000 and $3,500, 
as that creature called MANUEL SOLIS PALMA AND OTHER PRD MEMBERS 
admitted. The people of Panama must respond to that. VOTING 
AGAINST THE PRD IS THE NATIONAL MISSION. WE WILL VOTE AGAINST 
CORRUPTION, THEFT, AND CRIME. 
  [Signed] Panamanians for Democracy, Honesty, and Civilian 
Rule.

<F P=106> [Report by Manuel Alvarez Cedeno] </F>
  [Text] Legislative sources have reported that several 
deputies who opposed the military dictatorship yesterday offered 
their services as "mediators" in the creation of a grand front 
of "democratic forces." The objective is to form a united front 
to defeat the Democratic Revolutionary Party [PRD] in the coming 
elections. 
  Legislator Gloria Moreno, spokesperson for the group, read a 
statement titled "For the Unity of Democratic Forces," in which 
they made their summons. The document was presented at the seat 
of the Assembly Credential Commission. 
  According to election polls, the PRD is the people's 
favorite, with a 35 percent lead. Opponents are trying to unite 
in order to defeat the front runner in the upcoming election. 
  The document reads: "We hereby offer our services as 
mediators to facilitate a broad-based understanding among 
democratic forces. We also call upon the candidates and the 
people to support this statement." 
  The statement is signed by Marco Ameglio, for the National 
Renewal Movement; Gisela Chung, for the Nationalist Liberal 
Republican Movement [MOLIRENA]; Raquel Lanuza, for the Christian 
Democratic Party; Rodrigo Molina for Solidarity Party; Jose 
Paredes mayoral candidate for the National Unity Mission; Jilmer 
Gonzalez of the Arnulfist Party; Mario Lasso for MOLIRENA, and 
Gloria Moreno. 
  They have also called a meeting among all sectors opposed to 
the PRD in the next few days "to discuss the contents of an 
agreement to defend democracy." 
  The politicians highlighted the historic relevance of 
President Guillermo Endara's "brave decision" to disclose 
several videotaped recordings of corruption within the military 
government. 
  The note adds that "the president's action constitutes a 
vital measure that made the people realize what the PRD really 
represents. It also made the democratic leaders reflect on the 
unity needed to prevent the allies of the military from rising 
to power." 
  Opponents of the PRD condemned the disgraceful past of 
"demagoguery and violence against those who struggled under a 
single flag, a past that the PRD now wishes to hide with 
unrestrained cynicism." 
  The PRD is the former political wing of the dismembered 
military regime. Many of the party's activists have been 
accused of corruption and other illegal activities, although the 
party maintains that the accusations are part of a persecution 
campaign launched by the present government. 
  Following the meeting of the legislators, PRD Legislator 
Elias Castillo affirmed that "this is the expression of those 
who want to rise to power and those who want to remain." 
  He questioned the possibility of unity among the forces that 
oppose the PRD and said that his party has "the force of the 
organized population." 
  Castillo added that the PRD also has "a personality of its 
own; it is not divided. The PRD is united," while its opponents 
are divided. 
  "The people are intelligent and have a keen eye. They will 
not be fooled by the false prophesies of its opponents. They 
only demonstrate their division. The only thing that unites 
them is their ambition for power," he argued. 
  Castillo said that the videotapes Endara showed "will not 
affect the party's image at all," which has received the full 
support of its activists and followers.

stance? 
  [Carles] I do not want to talk about what others think. I am 
saying the country knows our ticket is the best, from an 
individual and collective standpoint. We have programs that are 
not novels, works of fiction, songs, or poems, but facts -- the 
result of our experience, knowledge, and capability. We have 
the best team. You will not find any of them on any video. [end

<F P=106> [Report by Jose Otero] </F>
  [Text] Ernesto Perez Balladares, presidential candidate for 
the "United People" presidential slate, has termed as a "useless 
effort" the call for unity made by the so-called civic forces to 
create a common front against the PRD [Democratic Revolutionary 
Party] for the upcoming 8 May elections. 
  This week, different political groups, among them some 
legislators, offered to act as "mediators" to create a great 
front of the democratic and civic forces, so as to achieve unity 
to defeat the PRD in the upcoming elections. 
  "I think what these people who call themselves 
antimilitarists [civilistas] are trying to do at this point is a 
useless effort, because the only thing they will accomplish is 
to stir up passions. This could result in situations we may all 
regret," Perez Balladares said, without specifying what he was 
referring to. 
  The PRD presidential candidate said there are politicians 
who 
have claimed the right to call themselves antimilitarists and to 
speak for an entire people, while he remarked that there are 
people who fought against Noriega and who now support his 
presidential candidacy. 
  "They are trying to create in this electoral period 
conditions similar to those in 1989, and this is a mistake," the 
opposition politician noted. 
  Perez Balladares added that the current political moment 
must 
not be taken as a struggle against anyone in particular, but as 
a struggle against the problems in 1994. 
  Meanwhile, Perez Balladares described the communique issued 
by the Justice and Peace Commission regarding the videos about 
the past military regime presented by President Endara last week 
as rickety. 
  "We accept the decision of the Justice and Peace Commission, 
but we think they could have been a bit stronger," the PRD 
leader pointed out. 
  Meanwhile, Perez Balladares accepted the existence of a 
large 
number of corporations with which his name is associated, but 
explained that this situation is not illegal but a part of his 
job as a businessman. 
  "They have accused me of not working since 1984. This 
situation shows that I am neither retired nor unemployed, as 
they have tried to portray, but that this is how I made my 
living," Perez Balladares concluded.

  [Text] Planning and Economic Policy Minister Delia Cardenas 
said yesterday that obscure interests want to harm our 
international banking center and the Colon Free Zone and that 
some sectors of the U.S. Senate are attacking our country out of 
ignorance. 
  The minister also said that a survey of the participants was 
disclosed during the meeting [not further identified]. The 
survey revealed that Panama and Nicaragua are the countries with 
the worst economic growth forecasts. 
  The survey also showed that those surveyed pointed out that 
the political stability of a country is the main factor to take 
into account when investing abroad. 
  Cardenas underscored that during an Inter-American 
Development Bank (IDB) assembly, U.S. officials attacked 
Panamanian regulations for fighting money laundering and drug 
trafficking. She added that this is because of the lack of 
information on the country's measures against these two scourges. 
  The official pointed out that she defended herself from the 
constant attacks that some U.S. senators made during the 
meeting, because Panama's image abroad is not very clear.

  [Text] International media reports coming from Spain have 
linked Panamanian Deputy Foreign Minister Carlos Cordero to 
several ghost companies being investigated by the Spanish 
Government as part of the properties owned by the wealthy 
businessman Mariano Rubio. According to this information, 
Cordero has ties with several private firms allegedly used to 
launder money. 
  However, Panamanian Foreign Minister Jose Raul Mulino 
pointed 
out that those reports are all intended to tarnish the 
Panamanian Government's image. Mulino made those statements at 
a posthumous ceremony honoring former Foreign Minister Julio 
Linares. 
  [Begin Mulino recording] I am sure the report is politically 
motivated and is attempting to damage the government's image 
internally. What they are doing with utter irresponsibility, 
however, is harming our country. The Spanish magazine [not 
further identified] does not highlight anything specific on the 
deputy foreign minister. It only mentions his firm 
superficially. The problem is a different one in Spain. [end 
recording] 
  Foreign Minister Mulino said Deputy Foreign Minister Carlos 
Cordero will clarify this information in due time.

  [Excerpt] Buenos Aires, 19 Apr (NA) -- Central Bank 
President Roque Fernandez today said the interest rate increase 
in the United States is going to cause an increase in the local 
interest rates on deposits, and he believes that during the rest 
of the year there will be "ups and downs in the markets as a 
result of the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy." 
  The banker indicated that the increase in the U.S. interest 
rate is going to cause an increase in the interest rates on 
deposits, and "this is an incentive to save, something that is 
not bad." 
  "It is bad when the active rates on loans increase," he 
said, 
and explained that monetary authorities are studying "how this 
incentive on the passive rate will favor savings." 
  The measure the Central Bank has under study is a decrease 
in 
the spread [preceding word in English], in other words, banking 
costs, "so the active interest rate will remain where it is."

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 19 Apr (NA) -- The Chilean national 
defense chief of staff, Vice Admiral Jorge Patricio Arancibia 
Reyes, stated today in this capital that Chile will continue to 
purchase armaments because "the technological level that has 
been acquired, which is related to the level of a country's 
development, cannot be neglected." 
  "A country must have the armed forces it is capable of 
maintaining, both technologically and financially, in a close 
relationship between security and development," Arancibia Reyes 
said. 
  Notwithstanding, the admiral denied that Chile is embarked 
on 
an arms race, and said "materiel only has been renewed" in 
recent times. 
  Asked about the appearance of insurgent groups in several 
parts of the continent, such as the group that revolted in 
Chiapas, Mexico, he maintained that today "they have an 
international structure behind them that keeps their concern 
about these movements on the alert." [quote as received] 
  The Chilean Army chief [title as received], who is visiting 
the country on an official visit, today met Argentine Defense 
Minister Oscar Camilion. 
  During the meeting, in which the Argentine joint chief of 
staff, Lieutenant General Mario Candido Diaz, participated, the 
Chilean officer handed a letter to Camilion from Chilean Defense 
Minister Edmundo Perez Yoma, who proposed a meeting between the 
two ministers some time this year. 
  Regarding the Mapuche conflict that has emerged in his 
country, Arancibia Reyes stressed that "a solution is in the 
works," and that "the concerns expressed by the Mapuches are 
being well channeled." 
  Finally, Arancibia Reyes highlighted "the greatness of the 
Argentine Armed Forces" within the Latin American context.

<F P=106> [Interview with Chilean Economy Minister Alvaro Garcia by </F>
Nestor Restivo: place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Restivo] The Chilean economy showed some signs of 
slowing down in 1993 and, for the first time in many years, the 
trade balance was negative. How will you face this new 
situation? 
  [Garcia] We will pursue the successful path that the 
national 
economy has been following during the past few years. Problems 
experienced by our export customers are partly responsible for 
this slowdown. These problems had an impact on the income and 
volume of Chilean exports. For example, copper prices dropped 
by 16 percent, fish meal prices by 21 percent, and cellulose 
prices by 26 percent. These products together represent 55 
percent of our exports. Considering all this, we expect the GDP 
to grow less in 1994 than in recent years (when the average GDP 
was more than 6 percent). It will grow by between 4 and 5 
percent. The Central Bank increased interest rates and 
moderated the fiscal policy, which caused public savings to 
grow, in order to compensate for the exports situation. But we 
are satisfied with the general situation. The Chilean rating 
abroad, established by leading risk rating companies, has 
improved. 
  [Restivo] It has been said that the Chilean domestic market 
has reached its ceiling and that, for this reason, a 
considerable amount of capital is being invested abroad. How do 
you view this market? 
  [Garcia] Income has been growing at a rate of 5 to 6 percent 
per year: In other words, the domestic market will continue to 
grow. Nevertheless, the foreign market is our driving force. 
Over the past decade, exports have grown 10 percent per year 
(this rate slowed down in 1993) and capital investments have 
grown 9.5 percent per year, totalling more than 27 percent of 
the GDP in 1993. 
  [Restivo] Nevertheless, the internationalization achieved by 
Chile prompted a degree of dependence. You mentioned last 
year's trade deficit that was prompted by a decline in the 
income and volume of Chilean exports... 
  [Garcia] Certainly, we had a $980-million deficit after many 
years of surpluses. Nevertheless, the main problem involved 
basic products. Foreign sales by manufacturers increased by 17 
percent. This is our challenge: To increase sales of 
manufactured products. 
  [Restivo] What proportion of Chilean services are exported? 
For example, Chile's tourism is growing notably. 
  [Garcia] Correct. Services and exported services produced an 
income of $2.6 million in 1993. Of this, $825 million came from 
tourism which has a huge potential. In 1993, tourism grew 18 
percent, the highest growth rate in Latin America. Argentina 
contributes a substantial 36 percent of this as some 800,000 
Argentines come here every year. 
  [Restivo] When [former President Patricio] Aylwin was 
inaugurated, he pledged to pay special attention to the social 
debt bequeathed by the military regime. Not very much was 
achieved. What are you proposing now? 
  [Garcia] One of the quantitative goals of [Chilean President 
Eduardo] Frei's administration involves removing extreme poverty 
by the end of its term -- that is, by the year 2000. During 
Aylwin's administration, progress was made by reducing the 
extreme poverty rate from 13 to 9 percent of the population. 
Economic growth helped to achieve this goal because more job 
opportunities were created for the poorest sectors of the 
population and minimum wages were increased 33 percent in real 
terms over the four-year period. Subsidies increased 55 percent 
and were better used. Nevertheless, democracy actually has a 
debt. Under this administration, efforts will be made to pass 
from an assistance oriented policy to an integral policy 
involving investments in human resources and labor training. 
For example, labor training will involve specific programs for 
small- and medium-size enterprises where the poorest segments of 
population are employed. 
  [Restivo] What about education, health, and housing? 
  [Garcia] We wants a more balanced education system. During 
the Aylwin administration, basic education was emphasized. We 
will now concentrate on kindergarten and secondary education. 
Concerning health, we will promote increased efficiency in the 
public sector and cut subsidies that favor higher-income 
sectors. Concerning housing, we will continue to raise housing 
solutions. The coalition alliance government built 90,000 
houses in 1993, compared with 33,000 houses built by the 
military government. 
  [Restivo] What will be your government's next steps 
concerning Mercosur [Common Market of the South] and NAFTA? 
  [Garcia] Chile believes in a multilateral policy followed by 
bilateral agreements. Our foreign trade is divided into three 
equal parts: Asia, America, and Europe. Mercosur is of 
paramount importance. Argentina receives 6.3 percent of our 
exports; Brazil receives 4.3 percent; and Uruguay and Paraguay 
receive more than 1 percent each. In other words, these four 
countries represent 12 percent of our sales. We are satisfied 
with the growth of our industrial goods exports. Many of these 
industrial goods exports have reached levels that we would like 
echoed by our other customers. In 1994, we will begin to 
negotiate with Mercosur on tariff exemptions for third countries 
within the framework of ALADI [Latin American Integration 
Association]. We will seek greater trade deregulations, but we 
cannot fully join Mercosur due to tariff differences. 
Concerning NAFTA, or at least a bilateral agreement with the 
United States (we already have one with Mexico), we hope to 
begin concrete negotiations during the second half of this year 
and sign an agreement in 1995.

  [Text] Presidential Secretary General Eduardo Bauza today 
received a Chinese Government delegation in the South Hall of 
Government House. The secretary general and the Chinese leaders 
discussed the possibility of increasing our exports to China and 
the decision to encourage new and constructive bilateral 
relations. 
  Eduardo Bauza later admitted the possibility of increasing 
our exports to the PRC, which is a very favorable market for 
Argentina. 
  [Begin Bauza recording] They are in the middle of an 
important opening and modernization process. This is a very 
important delegation because it is headed by one of the most 
outstanding members of the Chinese Communist Party. Their visit 
is within the framework of this new Chinese opening to the 
world. Our current trade exchange with China is not very large. 
It involves about $270 million in imports from China and 
approximately $250 million in exports to China per year. Their 
market has great unexplored potential. China has more than 1.1 
billion inhabitants compared with 30 million here, so their 
market may be entirely favorable for us. [end recording] 
  Asked about other markets for our products, Bauza said other 
countries are members of the southeastern Asian region because 
of their development and their purchasing power. [sentence as 
heard] Bauza said he believes Argentina is growing up and going 
out into the world to offer its products. 
  The Chinese delegation is headed by Hu Jintao, a member of 
the Standing Committee of the party's Politburo and a deputy of 
the Chinese National People's Congress. The delegation includes 
(Li Semin), (Tan Iongui), and (Liu Pein) who are the directors 
of the Latin American International Liaison Department of the 
Chinese Communist Party.

  [Text] Jerusalem, 20 Apr (EFE) -- Antonio Erman Gonzalez -- 
Justicialist Party deputy and former Argentine defense minister 
-- said on 20 April that Argentina and Israel may cooperate in 
the reconversion of modern military technology, including car 
manufacturing. 
  Asked about the visit he made to Israeli military industries 
this week, Gonzalez said in a news conference: "We will 
undertake feasibility studies to apply military technology to 
civilian life." 
  Gonzalez, who is making a seven-day official visit to 
Israel, 
arrived here on 17 April accompanied by Justicialist Party 
Deputy Ana Raquel de Kessler, who was the No. 2 person in the 
defense portfolio. Gonzalez categorically denied they were 
interested in the purchase of weapons from Israel. 
  He stated that the longstanding border disputes between 
Argentina and its neighbors are on the verge of being settled, 
"and from a hypothesis of conflict we have now come to a 
hypothesis of cooperation." 
  The Argentine deputies invited General Dan Shomron [name as 
received], the director of Israeli Military Industry (IMI), to 
visit Argentina, where the government has not yet privatized 
small-scale military hardware manufacturing companies, which may 
be recycled with Israeli technology into mixed corporations. 
  Commenting on the possibility of manufacturing car 
components, Gonzalez stated: "The proposal to establish mixed 
corporations has been well received." 
  He added that Argentine car manufacturing companies 
currently 
turn out 350,000 cars annually and this requires a comparable 
expansion of accessory industries. 
  Israeli military industries have been forced to lay off 
thousands of engineers and workers on account of the world 
crisis. It has had experience in adapting military technology 
to civilian uses in East Europe. 
  After visits to Aeronautic Industries and the IMI, "we 
agreed 
to exchange information on an ongoing basis about operational 
manufacturing companies in both countries. Personal knowledge 
will come in a third stage," he said. 
  Gonzalez noted: "Israel is neither an underdeveloped country 
nor is it counted as a highly industrial one; therefore, it can 
understand better than others our need for investments and 
technology transfer." 
  In response to a question of whether richer countries will 
transfer their leading-edge technology to less-developed 
countries, Kessler asserted that "major countries will have to 
do so and will charge for that, but it is what they will be able 
to sell in the next century." 
  Kessler, who sits on the Defense Committee with Gonzalez, 
noted that "Israel is in an excellent condition to do so and 
forestall other countries in this area." 
  She added that Argentina also may benefit from its economic 
relations with Israel since through these mixed corporations it 
will have access to the EU, of which Israel is an associate 
member, and the United States, with which Israel enjoys free 
trade. 
  Gonzalez reported that today, he and Bank of Israel Governor 
Ya'aqov Frenkel analyzed the influence of major economic blocs 
and the danger of their adopting a protectionist policy to the 
detriment of others. 
  The Argentine deputies also learned about Israeli labor 
legislation and the working of Parliament. Tomorrow, they will 
sign a cooperation agreement with Ben Gurion University -- 
located in Be'er Sheva,' capital of the Negev desert -- on 
research and exploitation of arid areas in Argentina's central 
and northwestern regions.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 19 Apr (NA) -- Czech Prime Minister 
Vaclav Klaus, who is making a state visit to our country, and 
[Economy Minister] Domingo Cavallo -- in his capacity as acting 
foreign minister -- today signed two memoranda of understanding. 
  The first memorandum pertains to political consultations, 
while the second provides for the initiation of talks leading up 
to the signature of a free trade agreement between both nations. 
  The memoranda were signed during a ceremony at the Economy 
Ministry attended by Czech Ambassador Ianko Peki, Vice Foreign 
Minister Fernando Petrella, Energy Secretary Carlos Bastos, 
Horacio Liendo, the legal, technical, and administrative 
coordination secretary, and Transport Secretary Edmundo Soria. 
  In the absence of Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella, Cavallo 
remarked that the political and economic transformation of the 
former socialist state has been "very successful." He envisaged 
that this would open up greater possibilities for cooperation 
between the two countries. 
  He pointed out that upon Klaus' own initiative, both 
countries will start negotiations on the liberalization of 
bilateral trade and the possibility of channeling trade through 
Mercosur [Common Market of the South] and the bloc made up of 
the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, and Poland, which have 
already signed a free trade agreement. 
  Negotiations are also under way between the Argentine and 
Czech Governments to reach an agreement on the elimination of 
visa requirements, investment guarantees, and doing away with 
double taxation.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 19 Apr (NA) -- It was officially 
reported in Buenos Aires today that an Argentine Coast Guard 
[PNA] patrol boat that was patrolling the Uruguay River was the 
target of shots fired from the Brazilian coast, after it had 
seized fishing nets unlawfully set in the river. 
  The incident occurred yesterday 763 km downstream on the 
Uruguay River, 12 km from the city of Santo Tome in Corrientes 
Province, when the PNA "BA-3608" patrol boat became the target 
of many shots fired from a suburban district in the city of Sao 
Borja in Brazil. 
  In a communique the PNA reported today that the shots hit 
the 
water a few meters from the patrol boat's hull, and that in view 
of the attack the PNA personnel carried out "zigzagging" 
maneuvers to escape the shots, without repelling the attack 
because it came from foreign territory. 
  The incident occurred a few minutes after the PNA personnel 
had seized fishing nets unlawfully set on the Argentine side of 
the river, and while they were investigating the suspicious 
movements of a boat that was crossing from the Argentine coast 
to the Brazilian coast. 
  During the routine PNA river operations and patrols, 28 
1,228-meter long fishing lines and 27 1,197-meter long fishing 
nets unlawfully set were seized, and four Brazilian citizens 
detained. 
  Court proceedings, labeled "Attack Against River Patrol," 
were filed on the incident. The federal judge of the city of 
Paso de los Libres will handle the case.

  [Excerpt] Buenos Aires, 19 Apr (NA) -- Local Interpol 
agents this morning detained a Bolivian citizen. His capture 
was requested by the Bolivian Interpol on charges of 
participating in eight murders in the Bolivian city of Sucre. 
  The individual was identified as Juan Carlos Garcia Guaman 
or 
Guzman. He was a member of a paramilitary group during the 
governments of Generals Luis Garcia Meza and Luis Arce Gomez. 
He allegedly participated in the killing of eight Movement of 
the Revolutionary Left [MIR] leaders. 
  Garcia was placed at the disposal of Federal Judge Adolfo 
Bagnasco and will testify tomorrow. 
  The incident that prompted Garcia's capture occurred on 17 
July 1980 when the group in which Garcia participated entered 
the MIR party offices on Harrington Street, in Sucre, and 
machine gunned the eight persons in the room. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Salta, 20 Apr (NA) -- Demonstrators and police 
clashed again today in the main plaza of the city of Salta when 
a provincial teachers demonstration degenerated into serious 
disturbances. 
  The disturbances took place in the plaza, where police 
chased 
and beat demonstrators, including an elderly lady who fell on 
her back. 
  As a consequence, four university students were arrested in 
the Casino de las Nubes, where they had sought refuge. 
  The Human Rights Commission was able to get the arrested 
students taken to the Medical Culture House and not to a police 
precinct. 
  This is yet another chapter of the very long struggle by the 
provincial teachers to obtain payment of money they are owed 
within the framework of a conflictive situation. 
  Some 2,000 provincial teachers participated in today's 
demonstration. They marched along demanding salary improvements. 
  Teachers from the provinces of Buenos Aires, Formosa, 
Cordoba, and Santa Fe participated in today's demonstration to 
show solidarity with their Salta colleagues.

  [Excerpt] San Salvador de Jujuy, 20 Apr (NA) -- Some 2,000 
state workers participated today in a peaceful demonstration in 
front of the provincial Government House demanding better 
salaries. 
  The protest, the first one in the tenure of new Governor 
Oscar Perassi, was organized by the State Unions Front, whose 
main leader is Carlos "Perro" Santillan, the municipal workers' 
leader. 
  The workers, who are demanding that the 80-peso increase 
granted by the government be incorporated into their fringe 
benefits package and not be considered just a pay increase, were 
policed by a Border Guard unit because no policeman put in an 
appearance. 
  The labor leaders who put themselves at the head of the 
protesters indicated today that on 27 April they will carry out 
a general strike in the province if the government does not give 
a concrete answer to their demands. 
  Despite the fact that there were no incidents, the 
demonstration was held in an atmosphere of tension because the 
recent serious incidents in the beginning of the month still are 
on people's minds. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo by "special </F>
correspondent" Jorge Luis Velazquez on 15 April in Boston, 
Massachusetts] 
  [Text] [Velazquez] Is the party over now? 
  [Cavallo] The point is that the current consumption boom 
[preceding word in English] will not be permanent. Later it 
will return to more moderate levels. A 4 percent consumption 
growth rate in a country with a 1.3 percent population growth 
rate represents a 2.6 percent consumption growth rate per capita 
per year. This trend remains unchanged, even though it is more 
moderate. I have never talked about reducing consumption. 
  [Velazquez] In this case, what brackets of the population 
will have to begin moderating their consumption rate? 
  [Cavallo] The middle income bracket, and especially the high 
income bracket, was the one that has benefited greatly from this 
wealth effect. Those who earn 500 or 600 pesos are not included 
in this bracket. These people consume all they earn. The 
middle and high income brackets of the population went overboard 
in recent years. Therefore, these brackets will have to become 
more austere. 
  [Velazquez] Isn't there a risk of this formula being 
recessive? 
  [Cavallo] Not at all. Those who say it is necessary to 
devalue are the ones who cause a recession. Nevertheless, they 
are mistaken from one end to the other. It would never occur to 
us to cause this type of consumption reduction. This formula is 
neither necessary nor appropriate. It is a Pyrrhic solution to 
increase exports by causing a recession. 
  [Velazquez] Are you planning to levy new taxes on 
consumption goods? 
  [Cavallo] No. We are duly collecting the existing 
consumption taxes like IVA [value added tax], income taxes, and 
the independent employers' and employees' contributions. These 
revenues are more than enough to finance public spending. 
  [Velazquez] I wanted to know if you actually are planning to 
levy new taxes on consumption goods in order to discourage 
consumption... 
  [Cavallo] Well now, these taxes already are acting as an 
encouragement for savings. For example, if you are securing a 
loan for consumption [goods] you will be paying IVA on the 
interest rate. Nevertheless, if the loan is for investment in a 
company, you can include this tax in the IVA on sales. There is 
already a number of elements in the tax structure, taxing 
consumption and not taxing investments and savings. These 
fiscal incentives are becoming increasingly significant in 
taxpayers' decisions. They did not have a real impact when 
taxes were not paid. 
  [Velazquez] What other measures are you planning to take to 
increase savings and discourage consumption? 
  [Cavallo] We are not thinking in terms of new packages, but 
in improving the implementation of measures we already have 
announced. 
  [Velazquez] What measures? 
  [Cavallo] Everything concerning the fiscal pact's 
implementation. For example, the deregulation of professional 
fees; the privatization of the electric system, the fresh water 
system, and the sewers; the privatization of provincial banks; 
the transfer of pension funds to the federal government; the 
final removal of gross income and keeping a single tax for 
retailers; and the deregulation of construction standards, among 
other measures. 
  [Velazquez] How will you convince the banks to direct their 
loans toward investments? 
  [Cavallo] We have to make sure there will not be any 
instrumental bottlenecks for intermediary services in short- and 
long-term loans. Short-term loans actually are very costly for 
banks because they have to be assessed and implemented many 
times. Mid- and long-term loans are assessed once, have good 
guarantees, are collected automatically, and do not have to be 
constantly rewritten. The operational costs for long-term loans 
are lower than loans for consumption [goods]. 
  [Velazquez] And why are the banks not warning about this 
point? 
  [Cavallo] I believe the "economics" of mid- and long-term 
loans still are not duly taken into account by the banks because 
they attach great importance to the risk of unbacked loans. 
Stability by itself is reducing this risk for the banks. And we 
will see if we can do something to further reduce this risk and 
facilitate the extension of deadlines for the repayment of loans. 
  [Velazquez] What are you thinking of to achieve this goal? 
  [Cavallo] Well now (Cavallo ponders), I cannot name a given 
mechanism now, but my people are studying experiences from other 
countries to find ways of reducing the risk of unbacked mid- and 
long-term loans, especially mortgage loans and similar loans.

<F P=106> [Report by Jorge Luis Velazquez from Boston] </F>
  [Text] Domingo Cavallo has said he is convinced that the 
dynamism of the stability plan will end up encouraging an 
increase in internal savings and slowing down the growth of 
consumption. The minister added, however, that the Economy 
Ministry will "help" speed up the process. Tax controls will be 
reinforced, exporters will receive incentives, and measures will 
be adopted to get banks more interested in the business of long 
term loans. 
  The minister described the scenario during a conversation 
with CLARIN at Harvard University, a few minutes after talking 
with a group of Argentine students on Argentina's current 
economic situation. The minister answered questions on 
corruption reports, the removal of Martin Redrado, and the small 
budget allocated to education. 
  "The savings rate increased by nearly 2 percent last year. 
It currently stands at 16 percent of the gross domestic 
product. The trend will consolidate after we implement the 
private pensions system. Savings will be encouraged by a nearly 
zero inflation rate and a more effective application of tax 
policies," Cavallo added. 
  The minister said he had his eyes on wealth tax 
contributors. 
"We eliminated many tax exemptions, and will now redouble our 
efforts to make sure regulations are strictly fulfilled, just as 
we are doing with the item profits." 
  The minister said at every chance that his recipe only 
contains more of the same medicine. He cited as an example the 
recent decree establishing guidelines on public spending. The 
minister said the decree made official an "unwritten" norm that 
the ministry enforced through regulations on budget programming. 
But the government decided to add legal weight to the 
instrument because of the need to establish stricter controls, 
and in order to reduce the administration's spending rate. 
  Cavallo said the government will soon present a bill 
establishing a new fiscal mechanism to encourage the export of 
capital goods. Entrepreneurs will be able to postpone the 
payment of the value added tax [VAT] on their operations until 
they receive their tax return on the VAT applied on sales. 
  "Another source of internal savings will be in the form of 
long term mortgage loans, which we still do not have enough in 
the market," Cavallo said. 
  "Why do you think banks will stop preferring loans on 
consumption which are short term and have higher spreads?" 
CLARIN asked. 
  "The demand will no longer be oriented toward those loans, 
and banks will have to compete and offer longer term lines and 
lower interest rates. It will also be advantageous for banks, 
because long term loans have minimum administrative costs which 
are applied just once, when the loans are granted. 
  Will the government implement specific measures to speed up 
the process? 
  "We are thinking of measures that will contribute to 
creating 
better conditions for banks to see more quickly where the 
business is. The law regulating the creation of mortgage 
securities [securitizacion de hipotecas] for trading in the 
capitals market points in that direction, the minister said, 
while walking through areas he remembered from his years as a 
Harvard student. 
  The minister denied that current policies carry the risk of 
recession. He defended his position with an example: "The 
Austral Plan provoked an increase in internal demands in 1985. 
But it also provoked a 20 percent drop in the volume of 
exports, which lasted two years. With the convertibility plan 
we were able to maintain our export rate stable during the first 
two years. Exports started to pick up in the third year, and 
they continue to grow today." 
  Cavallo's speech is strictly in accordance with what he has 
been saying since the Guadalajara meeting. In the IDB 
[Inter-American Development Bank] meeting in that city three 
days ago, the minister minimized the possible influence of the 
U.S. interest rate hike on his decision to promote an increase 
in internal savings. 
  "This year we might receive a little less capital 
investment. 
But that is not a determining factor. Everything will depend on 
us. Just as in the past we used external savings to finance 
investments, we must now take advantage of the fact that a 
reactivation in the United States might provoke greater demand 
for our products," the minister reiterated in Boston, the oldest 
city in the United States.

<F P=106> [Interview with Grand Front leader Fernando Solanas; place </F>
and date not given] 
  [Text] [CLARIN] Solanas, give us your opinion of Sunday's 
[10 April Constituent Assembly] elections. 
  [Solanas] I believe we had a great election throughout the 
country. We obtained nearly four times more votes than in 
October 1993, and we have the support of more than 2 million 
citizens. And watch it; this alliance is not yet one year old. 
  [CLARIN] Are you satisfied with your results in Buenos 
Aires? 
  [Solanas] What do you think? We went from 260,000 votes to 
approximately 1 million, and in addition the Front beat Raul 
Alfonsin practically without any resources. And, [Carlos] 
Chacho Alvarez was spectacular in the federal capital, in 
addition to Monsignor Jaime de Nevares' victory in Neuquen 
Province and all the districts where we fielded candidates. The 
seed has been planted; now we have to water it. 
  [CLARIN] But one must know how to water the seed; otherwise 
it could rot. 
  [Solanas] At this time we must continue our opposition of 
this model and continue to be consistent with our ideas and 
conduct. In addition to that fact, we must continue to expand 
the Front so it becomes the banner for all social forces in the 
cities and the interior, the production and cultural sectors. 
  [CLARIN] Will there be a merging of the Front with parties 
in "disuse" as forecast by Chacho Alvarez? 
  [Solanas] I am a staunch Grand Front supporter and logically 
I will support any initiative that will serve to unify the 
forces that are part of the Front. But we will be very careful 
not to shut the gate: Ours is a very large house, and he who 
agrees with our proposal can enter it. 
  [CLARIN] Regarding the criticism that is emerging from the 
official sector in that you do not have a proposal? 
  [Solanas] What has happened is that the more than 2 million 
votes were like a punch in the middle of the chest and they are 
out of breath. The [Eduardo] Duhalde faction [of the 
Justicialist Party] dropped from 48 to 42 percent, and Carlos 
Menem does not have his re-election guaranteed. 
  [CLARIN] And what is the proposal? 
  [Solanas] We want a different country than the one we are 
living in, a more just country with an equitable distribution of 
wealth. We are an alternative to that neo-conservative model 
and are going to clearly define a program for the 1995 elections 
together with the Congress of Argentine Workers, the Agrarian 
Federation, and the small- and medium-sized business sectors. 
  [CLARIN] Will you compete with Chacho Alvarez for the 
presidential candidacy? 
  [Solanas] Please, do not let us start creating problems 
where there are none. 
  [CLARIN] The fact is that Sunday's elections chose both of 
you as candidates. 
  [Solanas] We have agreed with the Front's leadership that 
the space we have gained and all the candidacies, even those for 
town council members, will be respected. We will debate this at 
the end. 
  [CLARIN] You are not going to be a presidential candidate? 
  [Solanas] I can be, and I may not be. This will be resolved 
between all of us at the appropriate time.

  [Text] Cordoba, 19 Apr (NA) -- A low-intensity explosive 
device exploded at the home of an Army official who, according 
to neighbors, had been commissioned to Artillery Group No. 161 
in Zapala, Neuquen Province. 
  Even though the reports that First Lieutenant Daniel Vega, a 
physician, had been commissioned to that garrison were not 
officially confirmed, they were not denied by military 
authorities either. 
  According to what was made public by Cordoba Province 
Police, 
the explosive device went off at around 0200 local time and 
caused only minor damage and no injuries. 
  The explosion only caused some damage to the door of the 
house located at 112 Jacinto Rios Street in the General Paz 
district, where Vega and his wife live.

  [Text] Vienna, 20 Apr (EFE) -- A high-ranking Bolivian 
government official stated that Bolivia needs at least $25 
million per year to be able to implement a sustainable 
development program, "which is the only way to defeat drug 
trafficking and extreme poverty." 
  This week Mario Soliz Valenzuela, national social defense 
secretary of the Bolivian Government Ministry, said: "As the 
world community knows, the Bolivian Government does not have 
those resources; this is why we appeal to the international 
community for cooperation if there is a true desire to do 
something concrete." 
  He added: "The Bolivian Government alone cannot wage, under 
such unfair circumstances" a war "against foreign drug 
traffickers, their technology to produce and export, their 
safety measures, and their flow of money and power, which is 
what makes international cooperation a must." 
  In his address to the 37th session of the UN Commission on 
Narcotic Drugs, headquartered in Vienna, that will end on 22 
April, Soliz said the drug problem will still be "long and 
bloody." 
  Bolivia is the world's second-largest producer of coca 
leaves, after Peru, and the second-largest cocaine exporter, 
after Colombia. 
  Soliz called upon "friendly governments, international 
organizations, and financial enterprises such as the World Bank 
and the IDB [Inter-American Development Bank] to help the 
Bolivian Government use its potential to eradicate surplus coca 
plantations by 1997." 
  The Bolivian Government plans to open a land register for 
the 
Chapare region, which will help obtain foreign financial aid "to 
start alternative development programs in the coca production 
region and, for the first time, give peasants there access to a 
market economy, free of any suspicion." 
  The mere possibility of obtaining a legal deed as a result 
of 
the census "increases the property value nine-fold with the 
advantage of being able to obtain direct financial aid," 
asserted the Bolivian Government representative. 
  Soliz added: "Many things are changing in Bolivia lately, 
such as the broader approach to the longstanding problems we 
have endured." 
  One of the goals established by President Gonzalo Sanchez de 
Lozada's government is to give priority treatment to the problem 
of illegal drug trafficking and consumption, "which we combat in 
a resolute, frank, and decided manner." 
  Currently, the fight against drug trafficking in Bolivia is 
centered on alternative development and police and legal 
interdiction of drug organizations, as well as prevention, 
stated Soliz. 
  The UN International Drug Control Board, in its 1993 report 
disclosed in February, urges Bolivia to modify its law regarding 
consumption of coca tea and the chewing of coca leaves "unless 
it believes that the reasons for including this product on the 
list of the 1961 Convention are no longer valid," and, if so, it 
would have to propose that it be eliminated from the list. 
  In this regard, Soliz said that in Bolivia the Law of 
Special 
Regulations on Coca and Controlled Substances, Law No. 1008, 
"allows the legal use of this product, such as in the coca tea 
industry, the chewing of coca leaves, and its use for rituals, 
and establishes that Yungas is the traditional coca production 
zone," where the replacement of coca plantations must be 
"voluntary and compensated, and bans coca plantations throughout 
the rest of the country." 
  Soliz explained that Bolivia has reached an agreement with 
the United States to eradicate 5,000 of the 8,000 hectares of 
coca planted per year in exchange for financial aid for the 
Bolivian balance of payments. 
  Soliz admitted, however, that although a plan for an 
alternative development has been implemented, "it still has not 
reached a degree that will allow a reduction of the production 
of coca and cocaine that reaches the consumer countries." 
  Therefore, if productive activities that might absorb labor 
and generate political and social stability are not promoted, 
"one cannot dream of a voluntary reduction of surplus coca 
plantations," that is, those prohibited by Law No. 1008. 
  Substitution "must entail products that will have a foreign 
market; if not, alternative development is unfeasible," asserted 
the Bolivia social defense secretary.

<F P=106> [Minister of Government German Quiroga interviewed by Carlos </F>
Mesa in the "Up Close" television program in Associated 
Journalists Television, PAT, studios in La Paz -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Mesa] Good evening. Bolivia is currently 
experiencing difficult times. It has to prove the strength of 
its democratic system and show its ability to resolve a problem 
which until very recently no one would have suspected would ever 
happen: unproven charges that a political party, and even a 
former president, maintained close ties with drug traffickers 
and drug trafficking. 
  This has led to other secondary issues: Bolivian ties with 
the United States, our degree of dependency, and our limited 
independence. 
  We will be discussing this and other issues with German 
Quiroga, minister of government of President Sanchez de Lozada's 
administration. Mr. Quiroga is here with us to discuss, as 
already announced, if Bolivia has a strong degree of dependency, 
if Bolivia is as submissive as it seems in its bilateral ties, 
and how are we to combat drug trafficking in Bolivia. 
  Good evening sir, and thank you for accepting our 
invitation. 
  [Quiroga] Good evening, and thank you, Carlos. I believe it 
is important to discuss the trafficking issue, which is an 
increasingly growing phenomenon. 
  Trafficking is probably the largest multinational company 
that has ever existed in the history of humanity. Its networks 
have spread worldwide. It has huge fleets of planes and 
sophisticated communications systems. They are excellent and 
powerful financial experts. 
  Unfortunately, because of difficult conditions, Bolivia has 
become the second largest producer of cocaine in the world. 
This has compelled us to think beyond our daily limitations, 
beyond political parties, beyond government administrations that 
change every four years, and even beyond our borders. The 
trafficking issue compels all Bolivians, men and women, to make 
a joint effort to halt this harmful problem. 
  Once we agree on the elemental principle of what trafficking 
consists of and its huge dimension, we have to revise many of 
the issues linked to the antidrug struggle. 
  [Mesa] Allow me to ask you an odd question. In practice, is 
Bolivia a truly independent and sovereign country? 
  [Quiroga] Yes, absolutely. It is an independent and 
sovereign country, at least in spirit. If we view the issue of 
dependency, it is closely tied to economic problems, to 
resources. From this point of view, Bolivia is a strongly 
interrelated country. Above a true political willingness to 
define specific issues -- specifically referring to resources -- 
there are certain prerequisites which do not allow us to put 
them in practice. Today we live in an incredibly interrelated 
world. As you might recall, there was a serious scandal a 
couple of years ago in the United States because some Japanese 
businessmen bought almost a fourth of Manhattan. One of the 
most prominent buildings in Manhattan, the Rockefeller Center, 
was purchased by the Japanese. Americans took to the streets 
with their placards to stage their characteristic protest 
demonstrations and say what was wrong with the officials who 
allowed the Japanese in. 
  I mention this just to show that all countries are strongly 
interrelated. Bolivia is an independent country because it is 
capable of making its own decisions. 
  [Mesa] But you surely agree that we should not compare 
Japanese-U.S. ties with Bolivian-U.S. ties. 
  [Quiroga] Definitely. 
  [Mesa] President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada views the 
situation differently. In his 9 April speech he said Bolivia is 
very dependent, although his words were softened when the text 
of his speech was published. 
  [Quiroga] But it is not a permanent dependency, am I right? 
Despite the interrelation I mentioned previously, Bolivia is a 
very independent country because it enjoys the absolute freedom 
to elect its officials and to enforce its own rules and 
regulations. So, in spite of what you have said and the great 
interdependency among countries, Bolivia enjoys an acceptable 
level of sovereignty. 
  [Mesa] You have just mentioned a key issue regarding 
dependency. You have just said that we are absolutely free to 
choose our national officials. 
  Let us view the issue in context. It is obvious that the 
U.S. Government -- to which we refer -- does not care who is 
appointed social communications minister, or customs director, 
or director of the regional sports institute. But obviously it 
is interested in who is appointed to the cabinet post that is 
directly involved in fighting drug trafficking. 
  This is the first issue: the difficulty of appointing 
officials directly involved in the fight against drugs. 
  Moreover, there is specific evidence that the U.S. 
ambassador 
has exerted direct pressure on one president, Gonzalo Sanchez de 
Lozada [as heard]. With or without justification, U.S. 
Ambassador Robert Gelbard specifically forced [former President 
Jaime] Paz Zamora to request the resignation of [FELCN, Special 
Antinarcotics Force, chief] Faustino Rico Toro, General Carvajal 
[not further identified], and Interior Minister Guillermo 
Capobianco. 
  Paz Zamora said in an interview that if the U.S. ambassador 
disagreed with the appointment of some officials -- who, we 
could add, were involved in the fight against drugs -- the 
ambassador just had to accept them. 
  Would you say the U.S. Embassy is today completely 
indifferent in this regard, are you saying it accepts and does 
not question these appointments with the minister of government, 
or is it that the minister of government and other government 
officials do not discuss with the ambassador the appointments of 
the FELCN chief or other key police officials involved in the 
antidrug fight? 
  [Quiroga] I believe these are completely separate issues. 
The sovereignty issue, the freedom of governments and officials 
to appoint their government team, is based on confidence. 
  The fact that Bolivia lost this confidence -- for whatever 
reason -- the process of allowing officials to lead the antidrug 
struggle with the absolute certainty that it was being properly 
handled resulted in different levels of intervention which do 
not exist at this time. 
  Today we are facing a credibility problem in Bolivia. This 
is not just the result of what in the last few days has been 
described as narcopolitics, it is the result of many things 
which have even caused international organizations to lose 
confidence in Bolivian authorities. One thing leads to another, 
it grows and grows until it is up to the United States to decide 
whether the interior minister stays or goes. 
  Under normal conditions, under conditions of mutual 
confidence -- because I am aware that President Clinton is 
absolutely certain Sanchez de Lozada will not permit these kinds 
of defects -- I reassert that we enjoy complete freedom to 
choose our officials. 
  Probably if we make a first mistake, if we nominate an 
official who had ties with drug trafficking, or if we overlook 
some ties with drug trafficking, this confidence will be lost 
and we will return to this vicious circle. But this is not the 
case now. 
  [Mesa] You mentioned some incidents that caused U.S. 
Government officials and international organizations to mistrust 
Bolivian officials. Would you say this has just changed 
following Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada's election? Would you say 
the Americans fully trust him, was this an automatic process... 
  [Quiroga interrupting] No, not at all. This entails a 
process. The situation did not change abruptly overnight. 
Things do not work like that. This entails a process. It is a 
slow and joint effort, based on honesty, which has restored 
confidence in Bolivia. 
  This lack of confidence probably halted what I choose to 
call 
the nationalization of the drug struggle. Had Bolivia, as a 
nation and under the previous administration, not experienced 
profound faults in its handling of drug trafficking and not been 
associated with drug trafficking, today Bolivia would probably 
be playing a more important role in the drug struggle. Although 
this was not the case in our bilateral ties with the United 
States or in our multilateral ties with international 
organizations, we are reacquiring this confidence. Thanks to 
the work of a team of men and women at the national level, not 
just at the Ministry of Government, we have been able to restore 
this confidence. 
  [Mesa] Theoretically speaking, what would happen if the 
government, for any reason, decided to replace the current FELCN 
chief and appoint someone else. Would you say the government 
would appoint this new authority without consulting -- without 
discussing it, if you will -- with the U.S. Embassy? 
  [Quiroga] I would consult the FELCN and the intelligence 
organizations and ask them to give me a report on the background 
of the person to be appointed to that post. 
  [Mesa] Not the U.S. Embassy? 
  [Quiroga] No, not the embassy because there is an 
information 
system. Perhaps it would be interesting at this time to define 
the FELCN and how it operates... 
  [Mesa interrupting] ...yes, allow me to... 
  [Quiroga interrupting] ...to explain... 
  [Mesa interrupting] .... yes of course... 
  [Quiroga interrupting] ...then, yes... 
  [Mesa interrupting] Allow me to pose a few more introductory 
questions so that we may later discuss this issue which is of 
course very important. 
  Another important question is whether the Ministry of 
Government, which you head, has any U.S. Embassy officials 
working inside it? 
  [Quiroga] No, no. 
  [Mesa] Did any U.S. Embassy officials work there in the 
past? 
  [Quiroga] I do not know. But there are none at this time. 
  [Mesa] Are there any policemen, or high-ranking personnel in 
charge of coordinating any tasks with the United States -- a 
liaison officer? Someone like "Our Man in Havana," as the novel 
goes...? 
  [Quiroga interrupting] ...Well, there are coordinating 
activities. There are joint undertakings but at this time no 
one can say there is a U.S. Embassy official within the 
structure of the Ministry of Government. Absolutely not. 
  [Mesa] You told me you would like people to know about the 
FELCN. First I would like you to explain, how is the Ministry 
of Government organized? What does it do? What does it 
encompass? What are the responsibilities of the ministry under 
you charge? 
  [Quiroga] Well, the Ministry of Government is divided in two 
sections: The domestic control system, under the police force. 
This is headed by the Domestic Order and Police National 
Secretariat. The other section is the Social Defense Secretariat 
which deals with coca, cocaine, and drug prevention. These are 
the two main ministry branches from the operational viewpoint. 
  [Mesa] It is important to explain that the justice system is 
no longer under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Government. 
This is very important because based on the new organization of 
the justice system, the Ministry of Government has ceased to be 
in charge of the prosecutors office, etc., is this true? 
  [Quiroga] Yes, that is correct. [passage omitted] 
  [Mesa] You have mentioned that many people believe the DEA 
is involved in FELCN operations. What is more, Bolivians 
believe the DEA is really in charge of conducting intelligence 
work and even indirect antidrug operations. Some even say the 
Americans arrested Faustino Rico Toro, but this is not the issue 
in question. 
  The BBC has produced a documentary, which we have already 
aired on PAT and on which journalist Amalia Pando did some 
research. This documentary showed DEA agents kicking down doors 
in Chapare. I believe this is not part of the DEA's work. 
  This is not our invention. It is documented in a film which 
shows the operations were planned in Washington in conjunction 
with the Southern Command, which is based in Panama, and that 
the FELCN chief was merely informed about the operation once it 
was complete. 
  This documentary also shows DEA officials directing 
operations aboard a flight to Santa Ana, giving instructions to 
the pilots, the Red Devils, and carrying guns. 
  This is not just theory. It is documented -- not by 
ill-intentioned Bolivians but by reputed and objective BBC 
journalists who are free of all suspicion. 
  There is evidence that the DEA is not limiting its 
activities 
just to advisory or intelligence work. 
  [Quiroga] As I told you a few minutes ago, the DEA works in 
conjunction with two FELCN units, one of them being UMOPAR 
[Mobile Police Unit for Rural Areas]. 
  We are currently implementing a program to gradually 
decrease 
the number of DEA agents in the country. Those who are working 
are personnel contracted by the DEA. They are U.S. police 
agents, contracted by the DEA, who have had military training. 
The number of those advising and training our police personnel 
is gradually decreasing. For example, in 1992 there were 35 
Snow Cap agents. In 1993, there were 21. This administration 
has agreed with the U.S. Embassy that there will be 11 DEA 
agents in Bolivia. 
  [Mesa] This means then that there are 11 DEA agents in 
Bolivia. 
  [Quiroga] Eleven Snow Cap agents. We are speaking about 
UMOPAR and the DEA, not the entire set up because they comprise 
completely different and independent units. 
  There are 11 U.S. officers who were brought in by the DEA 
and 
who are directly working with Bolivian troops. 
  In 1991, the year the BBC report was aired -- Operation San 
Ramon took place in 1990 -- there were probably about 100 Snow 
Cap agents. This number has decreased. At the time Bolivia did 
not have trained personnel or the means to conduct antidrug 
operations. Let me remind you that at the time we were 
conducting antidrug operations using hired gunmen, highly 
trained killers -- that is what those Colombians were. 
  But this is not the case today. Not because Government 
Minister Quiroga has more leeway to make independent decisions 
than previous government ministers. Not at all. This is 
because of current prevailing conditions in UMOPAR and because 
of its increasing effectiveness. We now have just 11 U.S. 
citizens working closely with our troops. 
  Beyond the fact that we can make more sovereign decisions, 
Bolivian police officers are now in charge of conducting 
antidrug operations. They are the ones who conduct the raids 
and seize.... 
  [Mesa, interrupting] How many DEA agents are there in 
Bolivia? 
  [Quiroga] Right now there are 33. The number of DEA 
officials vary from 25 to 40 or 45. It depends on the season of 
the year. Sometimes the Bolivian Government requests the 
presence of an expert in a specific field. Sometimes they send 
us one or two. They train people in their field and then leave. 
At no time are there more than 40 or 45 DEA agents in the 
country. 
  [Mesa] Is there a specific U.S.-Bolivian agreement defining 
the limitations, prerogatives, and restrictions on DEA agents? 
  [Quiroga] There is no specific agreement establishing these 
terms. Our ties in this area are mainly based on three 
documents signed by the Bolivian and the U.S. Governments. 
  One is a general document -- the Vienna Convention -- which 
defines the prerogatives of representatives of foreign 
countries. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> ["Text" of speech by President Eduardo Frei upon launching </F>
the National Commission on Public Morals on 6 April in Santiago] 
  [Text] Ladies and gentlemen. We are today starting a basic 
task to ensure the future of the country. I refer to the 
proposal for improving the regulations, procedures, and 
institutions that watch over public morals. I have invited 
well-known authorities and personalities of our society to 
become members of the National Commission on Public Morals that 
is established today. The members of this national commission 
guarantee to seriously study and achieve good results in the 
areas in which the commission will work. I thank them all for 
agreeing to carry out this task. 
  From the beginning of my administration, I stated my 
commitment and that of my government to an honest public 
administration and an impersonal use of power. 
  I recently instructed and encouraged public administration 
employees to carry their duties with creativity and efficiency. 
I reminded them of ethical obligations and precepts that guide 
public functions. I am sure we can count on them to honor the 
exemplary tradition of service of which we are proud. 
  We hereby establish this national commission today to 
streamline the legal mechanisms established and to ward off and 
suppress corruption and the trafficking of influence. 
  The factor that prompted me to establish this national 
commission was to underscore that corruption and its attendant 
problems are things that concern the whole country, as the 
effort of a particular government are not enough to prevent and 
overcome it. All the democratic forces of the country should be 
united in this endeavor. 
  The sense of initiative that gathers us here today is to 
serve Chile and to anticipate any isolated case of corruption 
that may lead to a situation having a harmful effect on the 
country. We seek to quickly prevent the dissemination of an 
evil which seriously affects societies nowadays. 
  The crisis of values affecting the modern world tends to 
weaken the moral roots that sustain political virtues. 
Societies with different traditions, large and small countries 
of the first and third world have been hit hard by this scourge. 
In many parts of the world, bribes, fraud, embezzlement of 
public funds, and sale of political influence have become a 
practice that enslaves the lives of people, destroys their 
institutions, weakens the state, and makes the nation vulnerable. 
  Chile is part of the modern world and does not escape from 
this problem. Although our country is far from the described 
situation and corruption is not yet a generalized vice, we must 
be alert and act quickly to stop this evil at its roots. Our 
responsibility is to act now and quickly. 
  To do that we have a tradition in our favor which must be 
strengthened. If Chileans are surprised by actions that violate 
ethical and legal principles, it is precisely because such 
actions are alien to our institutions and traditions. 
Historically, Chile has had honest officials and a dignified 
political class. Both in the past and now, the slogan of our 
democracy has been integrity. Acts of corruption draw attention 
because historically Chilean democracy has been honored by 
politicians and governments with a dedication to public service, 
and honest presidents. This tradition must emerge with greater 
strength in this new stage of our development. 
  It is the duty of the entire Chilean society, not just of 
the government, to encourage public morals. The strengthening 
and preservation of moral values related to common well-being 
requires a great effort by all sectors of society, the family, 
the education system, the media, and enterprises. Extreme 
individualism that seeks material gain or power by any means 
should be considered morally unacceptable in order to unmask 
selfish interests disguised as higher interests and to question 
actions that seek to make illegal actions and corruption appear 
respectable. We must revive among Chilean people a natural 
reaction of indignation regarding different forms of power abuse. 
  In particular, we need a joint reaction by the public and 
private sector. We want to make areas of contact between the 
two sectors sufficiently clear so that the legitimate and 
necessary cooperation does not become a false relationship. 
Irresponsible criticism of the state many times forgets that 
two parties are usually involved in acts of corruption: the 
public servant and the private enterprise or private individual 
who illegally tries to obtain an objective. 
  The struggle against corruption mainly concerns the state, 
but also the private sector. Upholding a corrupt system that 
increases costs and distorts competition rules, in the medium 
and long term, affects private interests. The state and private 
sector's common task in this field is to find the best solutions 
to maximize the incentives provided by a modern society and also 
to protect Chile from the vices and threats of a modern society. 
  All democratic forces of the country must become united in 
the common task of fighting corruption. 
  It must be well known that corruption is democracy's enemy. 
It discredits the institutions before society, it discourages 
youths from choosing to serve in the public sector, it 
jeopardizes the inspiration and the innovative capacity of 
public servants, and it sows distrust in the international 
community regarding the integrity of procedures and laws. 
  Undoubtedly, democracy alone does not guarantee morality in 
the public sector, but it makes it possible to report, it allows 
the establishment of supervision organizations, and it 
establishes impersonal judgment and appellation procedures and 
fair punishments. In sum: Our political system is not free of 
deficiencies, but it has the tools to correct these deficiencies. 
  Our actions to fight corruption must always be inspired by 
the desire to safeguard democracy and its institutions. 
  From the executive branch that is in charge of 
administrating 
the country, from the opposition exercising the necessary role 
of criticizing, from Congress fulfilling the role of legislating 
and supervising, and from any public and private level, our 
actions in this regard must contribute to safeguarding 
democracy. With this clear objective we can jointly and with 
determination progress, quietly and in an unselfish manner. 
  As we undertake the task of assessing and improving the 
legal 
and moral duties of the public activity through this commission, 
we want the existing debate to result in concrete proposals so 
that the many suggestions may be used productively for the 
country. 
  The great danger is that the fight against corruption may be 
nothing but rhetoric: Chilean's rightly want deeds. 
  I want to address a special message to the public servants. 
  Every upright and efficient government official ought not to 
be worried. Our final goal is to turn public service into a 
dignified work environment where initiative, the spirit of work, 
and the disinterested effort to achieve the common good are 
rewarded. We are not seeking to create a paralyzing and 
stifling control system. We are interested, rather, in clearly 
distinguishing illegitimate intentions from mere mistakes. We 
are pursuing the betterment of the state so as to be able to 
give citizens competent service rather than the construction of 
an ineffective and bureaucratic state. We do not want to 
duplicate the existing supervision institutions and mechanisms, 
but rather want to permanently activate them, improve them, and 
adjust them to a phenomenon that has aspects already known in 
the Chile of the past. 
  On this occasion, in my capacity as president of Chile, I 
want to reiterate my determination to exercise my authority 
assuming my inalienable duty to govern the country and make 
decisions, ultimately, respecting my commitment to do so 
strictly observing the moral principles of our republican system. 
  Endorsed by tradition, by the modernization of the system 
that guards legal and ethical duties in the public activity, and 
by our will to exercise authority and prevent acts of 
corruption, we will keep our Fatherland free and transparent and 
will guarantee a government at the service of society and not of 
itself.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Colombian Petroleum Enterprise </F>
President Juan Maria Rendon by Dario Arizmendi -- live] 
  [Text] [Arizmendi] Today, just as Carlos Rodado Noriega 
announced, Colombian Petroleum Enterprise [ECOPETROL] will open 
up for bidding by Colombian and foreign companies the 
exploration of 3.7 million hectares. Previously, much of this 
land could be explored only by ECOPETROL and was not open to 
third parties. 
  An interesting process begins today. It will continue in 
Houston, United States; Calgary, Canada; and, in approximately 
two weeks, London. Three packages with information from three 
regions will be presented. The regions are El Pie de Monte, in 
Los Llanos; Magdalena's Valle Superior region, in Tolima and 
Huila; and the Putumayo region. Each information package is 
worth $20,000. 
  Colombia, as the newspaper EL ESPECTADOR reports in today's 
Salmon Section, is going to go all the way to attract new 
investors by means of more attractive contracts to build a sound 
future as far as exploration and exploitation of oil goes. 
  We have ECOPETROL President Juan Maria Rendon on the line. 
Good morning, Dr. Rendon. 
  [Rendon] Hello, Dario, how are you? 
  [Arizmendi] What do you and ECOPETROL expect from this probe 
being initiated today? 
  [Rendon] The main objective is to attract new investors to 
the country so that they can help Colombia get into this oil 
business, which is characterized by high risks and heavy 
investments. Colombia suitably decided 20 years ago to work on 
this in conjunction with the private sector. Unfortunately, low 
oil prices and the fact that China, Russia, and many others have 
opened up to foreign investments like Colombia did appropriately 
a long time ago makes it more difficult to find companies that 
want to come here for exploration. The main objective is to 
engage in a very aggressive campaign in the cities you mentioned 
to visit the headquarters of the companies with our information 
to secure oil production levels Cusiana will make possible. 
  [Arizmendi] How many foreign companies are expected to join 
the exploration process? 
  [Rendon] We do not have any fixed estimate, but we hope that 
10 or 15 new companies come to the country. 
  [Arizmendi] Dr. Rendon, After this initial process that 
covers the three big regions we just mentioned -- the Pie de 
Monte of Los Llanos, Magdalena's Valle Superior, and Tupumayo -- 
will information be prepared on other regions of the country for 
similar exploration activities? 
  [Rendon] This year we will work on this process only, 
basically. We are going to wait for results. Possibly next 
year we will work on a new bid. 
  [Arizmendi] Current contract conditions are attractive 
enough 
to compete with nations like China and Russia? 
  [Rendon] These countries we have mentioned, plus Argentina, 
Peru, and others, are working on this under very special 
conditions because previously they had not considered foreign 
investment to develop the oil industry. The state was doing 
that. Now they have come to the foreign investment arena in a 
very hearty way. Their conditions are special, and it will be 
difficult for Colombia to match them. We have produced 
conditions we think are attractive. They are based on the 
country's economic stability and on the respect we always show 
to companies, plus the fact that this country is attractive 
because of the Cusiana oil breakthrough which we think will be 
successful. 
  [Arizmendi] Much has been said about Cusiana and (Cucuagua). 
The country has to start thinking about what will happen after 
the year 2000. Exploration activities have dropped, probably 
because of high exploration and exploitation costs and because 
we are not being sufficiently competitive with other countries 
such as China and Russia, as you have noted. What other factors 
could exist with regard to Colombia's loss of competitive clout 
with foreign investors? 
  [Rendon] Companies go to countries that offer revenue 
possibilities and respect for the rules of the game. These are 
two factors on which we want to make emphasis. We have also 
changed our attitude, from one that consisted of passively 
waiting for the companies to come here, to a more businesslike 
attitude of preparing reports on Colombia's potential to present 
them at formal bidding sessions, like the ones we have prepared. 
We will elect the winner after a public bidding that will 
consider investment factors [words indistinct] in the country. 
  [Arizmendi] Will this international bidding include the 
potential oil zones of Medina and Cundinamarca? 
  [Rendon] No. Those are reserve areas that have a high 
potential and that ECOPETROL maintains for itself to develop in 
the future. This is an area near Cusiana. We are looking for 
ways of working on those fields by somehow forming an 
association with a company willing to share risks and manage 
investments. Oil wells there will cost $30 million each. That 
is a very complex area. The budget for that operation could be 
a bit difficult. 
  [Arizmendi] If foreign investment is necessary, why have we 
renounced the support of Shell in Huila Department, as it has 
just happened? 
  [Rendon] This is a legal matter more than anything else. 
What happens with this company is that there is this contract, 
signed over 30 years ago. It is based on outdated 
circumstances, when the state [words indistinct] intervention. 
Later Colombia went modern, and now foreigners and ECOPETROL 
are partners and manage things jointly. After 30 years the 
contract is over, and there has been a legal ruling. Shell 
believes it can extend the contract. The State Council has said 
no. In view of this, the government has decided that it cannot 
extend the contract. It is not that we want them to leave. 
Shell is one of the most important companies in the world. We 
would like them to be in Colombia, with an even larger presence. 
I hope we can understand each other. This is not a matter of 
attitudes or of lack of compliance, but a legal matter.

<F P=106> [From the "National Newscast"] </F>
  [Text] The Colombian Government today admitted punishment 
for drug traffickers is very lax and suggested that sentences be 
doubled through changes in the law. The recommendation is not 
designed to make changes to the frequently discussed Procedural 
Code but to the Penal Code. 
  [Begin Justice Minister Andres Gonzalez recording] What is 
obvious is that the sentences need to be significantly harsher, 
and there are several reasons for this. I believe that current 
sentences should be at least doubled. [end recording] 
  Justice Minister Gonzalez said that for the government's 
policy to be successful, stronger sentences for drug traffickers 
must be accompanied by appropriate interpretations of the system 
used to reduce sentences. 
  [Begin Gonzalez recording] I believe there are many 
loopholes 
certain lawyers use to get sentences reduced. These loopholes 
are not included in the law. [end recording] 
  It is very clear to the government that some of the 
guidelines established in light of the internal unrest and 
former state of siege gave the drug traffickers too many 
advantages, and, in turn, these advantages resulted in absurd 
sentences.

    [Editorial Report] 
<H5>  Samper Leading in Two Polls </H5>
  In a poll conducted 23-24 March by Statistics Ltd. for CMI 
News and EL ESPECTADOR newspaper, 45 percent of respondents said 
they would vote for Liberal Party presidential candidate Ernesto 
Samper in the 29 May elections compared with 40 percent who 
would vote for Conservative Party candidate Andres Pastrana. All 
other candidates received 4 percent or less of the vote. The 
results are based on a random telephone survey of 1,200 people 
in the five largest cities who said they intended to vote. 
Respondents were equally divided between men and women. A 3 
percent margin of error was reported. (EL ESPECTADOR, 29 Mar) 
  When viewed according to city, results were as follows: in 
Bogota the two candidates were in a virtual tie, with Samper at 
42 percent and Pastrana at 41; in Medellin, the two were tied at 
44 percent; while in Cali, Samper had a substantial lead of 54 
to 27 percent, in Barranquilla he led 44 to 29 percent, and in 
Bucaramanga, he had only a marginal advantage, 44 to 41 percent. 
  Samper led Pastrana among male respondents obtaining 47 
percent of the vote compared with 36 percent for Pastrana; 
Pastrana showed a slight lead over Samper among female voters 
obtaining 44 percent of the vote compared with 43 percent for 
Samper. 
  When asked who they felt would be better prepared to take 
over in the event of the president's absence--Samper's running 
mate Humberto de la Calle or Pastrana's running mate Luis 
Fernando Ramirez--respondents gave De la Calle 67-80 percent of 
the vote depending upon the city, compared with 10-15 percent 
for Ramirez. There was no appreciable difference between 
preferences of male and female voters. 
  Pastrana said he was "not worried" by the poll results. (EL 
ESPECTAD0R, 30 Mar) Ramirez viewed De la Calle's lead in that 
poll as "normal" given that De la Calle had been campaigning for 
months, while Ramirez had just begun. Samper expressed his 
satisfaction with the results, noting that it showed that his 
decision to select De la Calle as his running mate was 
"correct." Samper also declared that the candidates' "commitment 
to social issues" was emerging as the central factor in the 
elections. (EL ESPECTAD0R, 30 March) 
  A second poll conducted on 25-27 March by the National 
Consulting Center and commissioned by the Bavaria firm, showed 
Samper leading in the first round with 49 percent of the vote 
compared with 41 percent for Pastrana. (EL TIEMPO, 30 Mar) All 
other candidates received 4 percent or less of the vote. In a 
runoff election, Samper was said to receive 54 percent of the 
vote, compared with 43 percent for Pastrana. 
  When asked whether they intended to vote in the elections, 
57 
percent said they would, 20 percent said they probably would, 6 
percent said they probably would not, and 17 percent indicated 
they would definitely not vote. 
  These results are based on reported face-to-face interviews 
with 3,102 persons, selected at random, in urban areas of 40 
municipalities. 
<H5>  Maza Decries Illicit Campaign Funding </H5>
  When asked during an interview with EL ESPECTADOR newspaper 
whether he believed reports that money from illicit sources was 
being used to help finance the campaigns, independent 
presidential candidate Miguel Maza responded that "there is not 
the slightest doubt." Maza described the use of such funds as 
"an insult to a country submerged in poverty and lacking in 
basic services." Maza added that illicit funds originated 
either from drug trafficking and other types of criminal 
actitivity, or as a result of corruption involving state 
contractors. According to Maza, such money is "circulating in 
abundance." (EL ESPECTADOR, 2 April) 
<H5>  Pastrana Campaigns in Miami </H5>
  Andres Pastrana traveled to Miami during Holy Week to bring 
his campaign message to Colombian citizens there. He reiterated 
his criticism of the renewal late last year of diplomatic 
relations with Cuba, declaring that now was not the "proper 
time" for such a move. He recalled that during his visit to 
Colombia last year, Cuban President Fidel Castro refused to 
condemn the activities of Colombian guerrillas. (EL TIEMPO, 2 
April) Pastrana also warned that it was important for Colombia 
to "act quickly" to gain entrance to NAFTA and said the country 
must continue to press ahead with economic integration efforts 
in Latin America. (EL TIEMPO, 2 April) 
  While in Miami, Pastrana attended a Colombian-American 
Chamber of Congress luncheon, which drew a capacity crowd. The 
candidate also granted interviews to several radio and 
television stations, toured Colombian-owned businesses in the 
city, and hosted a fund-raising dinner. 
  Ernesto Samper had originally planned to travel to Miami 
that 
same week, but reportedly canceled his trip for security 
reasons. (EL ESPECTADOR, 31 March) 
<H5>  Samper Responds to Bishop, Calls For Hostages' Release </H5>
  Before taking a few days off from campaigning during Holy 
Week, Ernesto Samper responded to Bucaramanga Archbishop Dario 
Castrillon's charge that Samper's appointment of Senator Claudia 
Rodriguez de Castellanos, a member of the evangelical Christian 
Movement party, to the Commission for the Renewal of the Liberal 
Party was politically motivated. Castrillon reportedly made the 
comments during a recent homily in which he said that Samper's 
action could create conflict with other sectors of the 
population who hold different religious beliefs. Samper denied 
any political motive, claiming he would not permit 
discrimination of any kind in his campaign and adding that he 
does not recognize "any differences among Colombians based on 
creed, ideology, sex, or race." (EL ESPECTADOR, 31 March) 
  Samper also called on the country's guerrillas to free all 
their hostages, including the father of Luis Fernando Ramirez, 
vice-presidential candidate of the rival Conservative Party. (EL 
ESPECTADOR, 30 March) 
<H5>  Candidates Revise Campaign Itineraries </H5>
  As a result of the decision to postpone the presidential 
elections until 29 May, candidates are reportedly revising their 
campaign intineraries, scheduling visits to additional 
municipalities and making plans to revisit certain key areas, 
according to EL TIEMPO (2 April). 
  Although Ernesto Samper is said to be the strongest 
candidate 
in the Atlantic Coast region, his campaign advisers have decided 
he should visit several of the departments in that region as 
often as possible during the remaining weeks of the campaign. 
They recall that in 1982 former president Lopez lost in that 
region of the country, even though it was considered a bastion 
of support for both the Liberal Party and Lopez himself, an 
outcome they attribute to the feeling of complacency that set in 
following the Liberal Party's good showing in the legislative 
elections. 
  Andres Pastrana will also be targeting this region during 
the 
remainder of the campaign, according to EL TIEMPO. Pastrana is 
currently strong in Medellin and Bogota, which, the paper says, 
explains Samper's recent decision to name three 
"heavyweights"--Carlos Lemos, Carlos Lleras de Ia Fuente, and 
former Bogota mayor Sonia Duran--to help direct his campaign in 
Bogota. 
  Antonio Navarro has been trying to garner support among 
residents of the poorest municipalities, continuing to promote 
his list of "promises" which he signs in the presence of a 
notary at each location he visits, according to EL TIEMPO.

<F P=106> [Article: "With Life Hanging by a Thread"] </F>
  [Text] The only sector that suffered net losses in 1993 was 
textiles. While not on its deathbed as some analysts believe it 
is, its problems are far from being solved. 
  The economic liberalization has not been a good thing for 
Colombian textiles and the future of the industry looks rather 
grim. "In 1992, Colombia exported $840 million worth of textiles 
and ready-to-wear garments, one-third of all industrial exports. 
However, how much longer can it stay in the market?" asks the 
latest edition of THE ECONOMIST after analyzing the problems 
facing the country's textile mills. "Last year," the prestigious 
publication continues, "nearly 5,000 textile jobs were lost in 
Medellin alone, profits collapsed, and several dozen small firms 
had to close their doors." 
  The situation is truly dramatic. According to an analysis 
done for the Superintendency of Securities based on the 1993 
financial results of 86 companies in the manufacturing sector 
whose securities are registered with the National Registry of 
Securities and Middlemen, the only economic sector that suffered 
net losses last year was textiles. Of the 14 companies included 
in the sampling, six--including Tejicondor and COLTEJER 
[Colombian Textile Company]--suffered losses and only three of 
the other eight improved their financial situation (see box). 
  What is more serious is the fact that despite the 
government's efforts to plug some of the holes that caused the 
crisis, such as the elimination of minimum import prices and the 
free entry of fabrics into the country, the sector's prospects 
are not at all bright. The world market is glutted and 
incentives to smuggle remain great. Dumping is far from 
disappearing, Customs has not caught up with the requirements of 
liberalization, and revaluation has hurt the ability of 
Colombian textiles to compete on the world market. It is 
therefore not surprising that shareholders in the country's 
largest companies meeting in recent days demanded better 
treatment for the industry from the government. 
<H5>  Domestic Scene </H5>
  Not all the sector's ills are the fault of the international 
environment or government policy, however, says one prestigious 
American consulting firm. For over a year, Monitor has been 
completing a diagnosis of the ability of Colombian 
industry--including textiles--to compete and last week submitted 
its conclusions in Bogota and Medellin. According to analyst 
Michael Fairbanks, the sector's biggest companies, such as 
COLTEJER, Fabricato, and Tejicondor, are facing an unprecedented 
fall if they do not want to be pushed out by China, Pakistan, 
and India, whose low-cost production is flooding the world 
market. Furthermore, in Fairbanks' opinion, it would almost be 
better to close the existing companies and replace them with new 
ones that are more vigorous and aggressive. 
  The textile companies feared the result of the Monitor 
studies, but emphatically reject such a radical solution, i.e., 
pulling the plug on the big companies and precipitating their 
death throes. "If dying and being born were so easy, we would 
have heaven in our hands," COLTEJER President Rene Gomez told 
SEMANA. 
  In terms of its ability to compete, Monitor gives the 
national industry low grades in four key areas. Looking at the 
so-called advanced factors, it fails in terms of basic 
infrastructure (highways and ports), telecommunications, 
technological experience, and professional training. It has 
little or nothing to offer in terms of competitive strategies. 
Effort is poor in the area of common trade guild objectives. The 
lag in the makeup of the domestic market is worrisome. Only one 
of its two traditional comparative advantages, geography, still 
ranks above average. The other, wages, has also begun to sag. 
  The truth is that labor liabilities have the three Colombian 
giants: COLTEJER, Fabricato, and Tejicondor, on their knees. 
COLTEJER has one retired worker for every two on the job, and 
the ratio at Fabricato is practically the same. Even Tejicondor, 
which has had no union since the 1982 crisis and has thus been 
able to negotiate with its employees directly, has only four 
active workers for every one retired. "When the economy was 
closed, the private sector managed some of the retired workers 
and handled certain benefits," Gomez says, "but under the 
economic liberalization, that social burden has been transferred 
to the government." As a result, led by COLTEJER, Antioquia's 
textile companies intend to present new alternatives so that the 
government will shoulder the responsibility for retired workers. 
"That social function belongs to it," Gomez adds. 
  Nevertheless, the companies recognize that some progress has 
been made in terms of benefits, in particular, passage of Law 
50, the system of work providing no benefits. In the case of 
Tejicondor, for example, the company has managed to place 90 
percent of its personnel roster (1,835 persons) under the new 
regime. In addition, most of the company's new contracts are for 
a set term. "Our average seniority no longer exceeds four 
years," SEMANA was told by Tejicondor President Abel Perez Gil. 
At COLTEJER, half of the 7,200 workers opted for the new system, 
while at Fabricato, 60 percent of the 5,330 employees did so. 
  However, progress made in this field has been lost in the 
area of wages, which rise daily in relative terms. When compared 
with other Latin American countries, Colombia's minimum wage has 
surpassed that of Mexico, Venezuela, and Chile. When one adds 
the accelerated rate of the revaluation, the labor advantage 
shrinks even further. For this reason, textiles now being 
produced in Colombia include finished (and sometimes complex) 
components because making rough fabrics is no longer profitable. 
<H5>  A Little Bit of Everything </H5>
  Concerning the Colombian supply, Monitor criticizes the 
practice of making a little bit of everything for an 
underdeveloped national market that consumes five kg of fabric a 
year compared with a world average of 25. COLTEJER, Fabricato, 
and Tejicondor recognize that the multiplicity of lines is a 
drawback and have begun to make significant cuts. "Monitor is 
right about this business of trying to produce everything," 
Perez admits. As head of Tejicondor, he has cut his factory's 
lines from 100 to 33. The immediate effects include a 
substantial improvement in quality and a tangible reduction in 
costs. 
  Monitor recognizes that changes introduced by the textile 
companies in this direction have been positive because they have 
given Colombia a new competitive outlook it did not have before. 
"Most of the competitive innovations in Colombian industry can 
be seen in the textile sector," Fairbanks says, while suggesting 
even deeper scrutiny: "The bottom line is that the lines 
produced by Colombian textile companies are so elementary that 
they are easily copied, which explains the takeoff of Asian 
producers." 
  The fact is that Colombia is still far from creating a 
movement of style and ready-to-wear clothing enabling it to 
impose trends and brand names as the garment industry 
multinationals have done. "In this area, there are international 
trade barriers that hurt us," says Fabricato President Jorge 
Restrepo. "Turning Colombian brands into stylish name brands 
will take previously unheard-of levels of time, investments, 
marketing, and advertising which we are not prepared to make." 
  Monitor points to what it considers a serious flaw in the 
primitive articulation of the Colombian textile chain, a fact 
which the presidents of the main national companies accept, but 
which they largely blame on the government. The price of cotton 
is one example. Manufacturers are forced to buy and pay for 
Colombia's total production at the international price, plus an 
additional duty of 10 percent. In Asia, Colombia's main 
competitor, the price paid by manufacturers for raw materials is 
25 percent under the world price. By trying to protect cotton 
producers, the textile companies say, the government hurts 
manufacturers. 
  Monitor also criticizes the Colombian manufacturers' custom 
of operating as sealed units, preventing anyone else from 
discovering their secrets. There is no true guild spirit that 
serves to stimulate every link in the chain. While this is 
true--and the entrepreneurs admit they have all been very 
accustomed to going their own separate ways--they have recently 
begun to obtain state-of-the-art information, share data on 
world style trends, buy raw materials as a bloc, and respect 
each other's markets. 
  Nor do their efforts end there. Another effort to remedy 
shortcomings pointed out by Monitor involves industrial 
conversion. The textile firms say they have invested over $400 
million in state-of-the-art technology in order to catch up with 
the latest market developments, a step that has already gained 
recognition. For example, the ECONOMIST article points to the 
plans of COLTEJER, which "has cut its labor force from 8,900 to 
7,200 in a matter of just a few months, invested $32 million in 
manufacturing systems, and cut back on its range of 
production"--previously amounting to some 4,000 lines--"by more 
than half." 
  In short, Monitor's diagnosis is not far removed from 
reality, but some of its conclusions are nothing new to the 
entrepreneurs. Many of them were already in the works. 
  Consequently, while relying on more active government 
intervention in terms of Customs supervision and control of the 
exchange rate, they look to the future with more optimism than 
does Monitor. "We shall make the necessary efforts, but we 
cannot change overnight without causing serious social 
problems," Gomez says. "If we were to accept all the 
recommendations, we might make our business more profitable, but 
we would be leaving the government with a serious social crisis, 
which we cannot do. We shall view it as our social mission."

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic developments monitored through 19 April. 
  Exports grew by only 2.9 percent in 1993, but imports grew 
at 
an accelerated rate. The government believes this is normal in 
view of the ongoing process to eliminate tariffs. It trusts 
exports will perform well beginning in 1995. The National 
Customs and Tax Directorate has reported Colombians imported 
$9.8 billion in 1993, compared to $6.5 billion in 1992; that is, 
51.1 percent more. 
  There was an increase from $958.3 million in 1992 to $1.7 
billion in 1993; that is, an 82.27-percent increase. The 
highest increase was in raw materials; the highest increase was 
registered in durable consumer goods, including private 
automobiles, weapons, military equipment, and home appliances; 
there was a 126-percent increase in this area. The highest 
increase was in raw materials, intermediate products, and fuels, 
with a total of $4.2 billion. 
  The purchase of capital goods also registered a considerable 
increase, with a total of $3.8 billion; that is, a 75.73-percent 
increase in 1993 compared with 1992. The United States was 
again Colombia's main purveyor. Colombia imported $3.4 billion 
from this country in 1993; that is, 42 percent more than in 
1992. Venezuela was the second purveyor, with $968.1 million in 
1993 compared to $424 million in 1992. 
  Concerning exports, they increased by only 2.9 percent, for 
a 
total of $7.1 billion. Nontraditional exports increased by 
11.95 percent; that is, $3.9 billion; this was caused by an 
expansion of bananas and emerald sales abroad. Banana sales 
totaled $393.8 million and emerald sales totaled $308.6 million, 
exports of which increased by 77.2 percent in 1993 compared to 
1992. 
  Traditional exports dropped due to lower sales of coffee, 
ferronickel, and petroleum. Coffee exports dropped 9.45 
percent, ferronickel exports by 18.58 percent, and petroleum 
sales by 6.3 percent in 1993 compared to 1992. (Santa Fe de 
Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 9 April 94 p 11a) 
  The National Administrative Department of Statistics, Dane, 
reported yesterday unemployment in the country's seven most 
important cities increased from 9.6 percent in March 1993 to 
10.3 percent in March 1994. That nearly 1-percent increase is 
equivalent to 46,000 more unemployed. The growth in 
unemployment was due to a slight decrease in economic growth. 
Dane reported the largest departmental capitals registered 
considerable increases in unemployment, but three smaller 
capitals, Bucaramanga, manizales, and Pasto, registered 
decreases. Medellin fared the worst, with 13.3 percent. Santa 
Fe de Bogota registered the lowest rate, with 8.2 percent.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on guerrilla activities monitored through 20 April. 
  Army major Luis Demetrio Yepes and Sergeant David Bawy 
Guerrero are still missing after being kidnapped by National 
Liberation Army (ELN) guerrillas in La Milagrosa, between El 
Santuario and Cocorna, Antioquia, on 10 April. (Santa Fe de 
Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 12 April 94 p 8a) 
  Cattleman Ricardo Blanco, kidnapped by FARC (Revolutionary 
Armed Forces of Colombia) in La Trinidad Hacienda, Oiba 
Municipality, Santander Department, was released by his captors 
on 11 April. A man known as Luis, reportedly FARC's chief of 
intelligence, and seven guerrillas were captured in Salamina, 
Caldas department. In addition, four police were wounded when 
reported FARC members attacked a patrol in Apartado, Antioquia. 
(Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 13 April 94 p 8a) 
  In Flor del Monte, Sucre Department, an infantry patrol was 
apparently ambushed by a FARC group. Five men, soldiers and 
guerrillas, were killed. (Santa Fe de Bogota Inravision 
Television Canal A in Spanish 1730 GMT 18 April 94) 
  The authorities have dealt a heavy blow to the ELN, as 
military forces seized a large amount of equipment held by the 
clandestine radio station, Radio Patria Libre, which the 
guerrillas used to instigate its members to commit crimes. 
During the operation, three guerrillas were killed and two were 
captured. The 2d Mobile Brigade dismantled three camps that 
served as refuge for at least 240 guerrillas and seized 
communications equipment, booby trap mines, weapons, and 
ammunition. (Santa Fe de Bogota Inravision Television Canal A

  [Text] Special Prosecutor for Terrorist Crimes Daniel 
Espichan Tumay today categorically rejected any interference 
from foreign organizations in judging Peruvian laws for fighting 
against terrorism. In reference to the comments made by 
President Alberto Fujimori, he said the demands of Amnesty 
International will not be met. 
  [Begin recording] [Espichan] Why do we have to accept orders 
from foreigners, from people who are not aware of our problems 
or of what we have to do? I believe that here in Peru we have 
very intelligent people, well educated people, who know the 
problem of terrorism. We therefore do not have to accept any 
indications from anyone. We are handling the situation 
ourselves, and are winning this war. I therefore believe that 
the instructions given by the president are correct. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Does the fact that they were not 
allowed to meet with some officials mean abroad that something 
was being hidden? 
  [Espichan] No, because the International Red Cross, which is 
a very important world organization, is authorized by law to 
visit the inmates held on charges of terrorism in Peru, and they 
can give the necessary information to any international 
organization that wants to verify the situation of the 
terrorists. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] Today President Alberto Fujimori confirmed the 
murder of indigenous Ashaninkas in Quilla and Masamari by a 
Shining Path [SL] column. 
  He also denied that the Army had bombed SL strongholds in 
the 
Huanuco jungle, or that his government had reached an agreement 
with the SL leadership sentenced to life imprisonment. 
  The chief of state also disclosed that he has reached a 
preliminary agreement with the IMF to earmark $875 million 
obtained from the privatization process for social expenditures. 
  Fujimori made this announcement during a working visit to 
Huancayo. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] President Fujimori 
dedicated another two schools in Huancayo, built by Concode 
[expansion unknown]. [passage omitted] 
  During a meeting with the media Fujimori announced that $875 
million obtained from the privatization process will be 
earmarked for social expenditures, as part of a preliminary 
agreement with the IMF within the framework of the letter of 
intent. 
  [Fujimori] According to this agreement reached with the IMF, 
we will be able to use the resources obtained from the 
privatization process as an advance on the financial aid we may 
obtain in the coming months, the coming year, from the World 
Bank and the IDB. 
  [Reporter] Fujimori also confirmed the murder by SL members 
of indigenous Ashaninkas in the towns of Quilla and Masamari. 
  [Fujimori] The number of dead seems to have increased, and 
this is very regrettable. The Army has surrounded the SL 
members near the Ene River near the town of Quiteni. I also 
want to categorically deny a press report that the Army used 
helicopters to bomb the terrorists. This is not true, nor is it 
true that I have held a dialogue with [SL leader Osman] Morote. 
What the president has done is to show that Morote and his 
supporters are being held in highly secure prisons. [end

  [Text] Praising the Peruvian Government's achievements 
during the past two years, which he said he learned about in 
detail during his official visit to Peru, Argentine Foreign 
Minister Guido Di Tella said that hopes for Peru's future have 
been revived at a continental level. 
  The Argentine minister arrived in Peru on the evening of 4 
April. Yesterday he had a busy agenda. He said: "Peru's 
prospects today are not the same as they were a while ago; they 
are now much better, and we want to participate in this process." 
  He commented that the changes implemented by President 
Alberto Fujimori during the past two years are similar to those 
carried out by Argentina and other countries. 
  Di Tella said: "This is why I believe there are new chances 
of cooperation and greater collaboration because instead of 
rhetoric we now see concrete deeds." 
  Establishing the Joint Peruvian-Argentine Commission with 
his 
Peruvian counterpart Efrain Goldenberg, Di Tella said the 
commission will assess the integration policies contained in 
bilateral projects. 
  He and Minister Goldenberg reviewed the economic and 
political issues of the agenda which, he said, were then passed 
for assessment by the commission which disclosed its conclusions 
yesterday afternoon. 
  The Argentine foreign minister then disclosed that on 17 and 
18 July, Argentine President Carlos Menem will pay an official 
visit to Lima. 
  He did not announce an agenda because the chiefs of state 
will draft it. 
  Early this morning Di Tella placed a wreath at the monument 
of Argentine forefather Jose de San Martin in the square of the 
same name. 
  Referring to Menem's visit, he said it will be a sign of 
support for the changes currently taking place in Peru. 
  Regarding the constitutional reform to allow presidential 
reelection in his country, he said it has the support of the 
great majority of the people.

  [Text] Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina proposed that 
Cuba and Peru eliminate import taxes on some 200 products, which 
would substantially increase trade between the two countries. 
  He also invited Peruvian businessmen to invest in Cuba 
through mixed enterprises or joint ventures. 
  The proposal was made to Industry, Commerce, and Integration 
Minister Liliana Canale during a working meeting in her office. 
  Robaina, who carried a list, proposed that some 200 products 
be placed on the list of products that benefit from the partial 
agreement that allows the importation of products with a zero 
import tax. 
  Currently only about a dozen products do not pay import 
taxes. This greatly restricts trade between Peru and Cuba. 
  Cuba thus would export medicine, rum, citrus fruit, and 
sugar 
cane, while Peru would export fish meal and minerals, among 
other goods. 
  Robaina also proposed that a commercial mission visit Cuba 
in 
June. Peru has yet to answer the invitation. 
  The commercial mission would be headed by Minister Canale, 
who would be accompanied by private businessmen who have 
expressed interest in investing in Cuba, in the tourism field 
especially. 
  After the meeting, Minister Canale said she is carefully 
assessing the Cuban proposals in order to give an answer as soon 
as possible. 
  She said contact will be made with the business sector to 
reach a consensus regarding the products that could be imported. 
  She explained that the mechanism is similar to the one 
upheld 
by ALADI [Latin American Integration Association], through which 
the continent's countries have reached similar agreements in the 
region. 
  Canale said the purpose of the commercial mission's trip 
would be to identify trade prospects between the two countries, 
although she added that the trip's date has not been established 
yet. 
  She then added that the Cuban foreign minister's visit has 
awakened interest in investing in that country and that there 
are businessmen who want to step up the exchange of experiences. 
  Canale said her ministry is willing to support every effort 
designed to step up commercial relations with that Caribbean 
island and added that the Cuban authorities' proposal is being 
studied. 
  Regarding her possible trip, Minister Canale said she is 
reviewing her agenda to determine whether or not she will be 
able to travel to Cuba in the near future because she is very 
willing to visit Fidel Castro's country. 
  Contact between the two countries will be maintained through 
the respective foreign ministries, which will be kept informed 
of the decisions made in the coming months. 
  When asked about the Cuban proposal, Confiep [National 
Confederation of Private Business] President Arturo Woodman 
answered immediately, saying he is in favor of tax exemptions. 
  He said it is up to the government to make a decision in 
this 
regard, but said he was in favor of the immediate implementation 
of tax exemptions in order to step up trade between the two 
countries. 
  He said it would be a good thing to increase trade between 
the two countries because it would allow Peru to export fish 
meal, proteins, and other products to that island. 
  Woodman said the issue is now in the government's hands, 
which has to see about the legal aspects of eliminating import 
taxes for some 200 products. 
  Foreign Minister Robaina voiced his satisfaction with the 
results of his meeting with Minister Canale and said the results 
will be noticed soon. 
  He said the upcoming visit of a Peruvian commercial 
delegation to his country will help strengthen commercial ties 
between the two countries. 
  After the meeting, the Cuban foreign minister held a series 
of meetings with Peruvian political and social figures. 
  In the evening he attended a cultural event at the National 
Museum, during which beautiful Cuban music was played. The 
event also was attended by political and cultural 
representatives. 
  After the event Robaina left the country to continue his 
tour 
of the continent in an attempt to tighten cooperation ties.

<F P=106> [Interview with General Walter Taboada Milla, head of the </F>
National Counternarcotics Division, by David Montoya; place and 
date not given] 
  [Text]The political violence has more than one link 
with the drug traffic. In this edition, we begin publishing a 
bimonthly supplement on this topic. David Montoya, of the 
Special Report team, was able to interview the chief of the 
DINANDRO [National Counternarcotics Division], General Walter 
Taboada Milla. The National Police's DINANDRO has been operating 
since 1 January 1992, the date of the merger of the two 
divisions of the PIP [Peruvian Investigative Police] and Civil 
Guard that had been responsible for that task. The merger into a 
single division made it possible to reinforce the police work on 
what is known as interdiction. Now, there is more national 
information on the problem, available more rapidly. The 
DINANDRO's mission combines intelligence and interdiction 
activities, and simultaneous coordination with the Armed Forces 
throughout the country. 
  [Montoya] Starting with the topic of the "Vaticano" case, is 
it true that some artists had to be arrested to create a 
smokescreen in the country? Did they really have to be arrested 
based on "orders from above," without evidence? 
  [Taboada] It was called an order from above, referring to 
their superiors in the chain of command. So, there was no agency 
apart from the police that ordered the detention of those 
persons. 
  [Montoya] But there was no apparent evidence for detaining 
them, was there? 
  [Taboada] Then why didn't they complain; why didn't they 
file 
a suit for habeas corpus? We detained them to investigate the 
specific case involving the financial aspect, because there was 
a series of contradictions. (Later, one of those detained sued 
the interior minister.) 
  [Montoya] And in the case of Demetrio Chavez Penaherrera, 
did 
you succeed in proving the drug trafficking charges? 
  [Taboada] Within 12 days, we collected sufficient evidence 
to 
sentence him for a great many years. By his own admission, he 
was a drug trafficker from 1979 until 1991. 
  [Montoya] But "Vaticano" apparently is going to be sentenced 
to life imprisonment for his connection with subversion, rather 
than for drug trafficking. 
  [Taboada] That is a complementary charge. 
  [Montoya] Many people wonder how the Campanilla Army Base 
could have failed to discover "Vaticano's" illicit activities, 
and how he managed to create his empire almost before their 
eyes. What is your opinion of this? 
  [Taboada] We have been totally dedicated to seeking evidence 
against this individual, and we couldn't go any further in two 
weeks. The trial judge has paved the way for continuing the 
investigation and for going as far as necessary. 
  But "Vaticano" didn't start out in Campanilla; he began much 
sooner, selling by the kilo at first. Later, by 1989 in Uchiza, 
he was already owner of the "firm," which he called "Loco 
Limonier." Then he moved to Campanilla. He's a clever man, 
despite the fact that he has only primary schooling. There, with 
the entire population's support and the local authorities' 
approval, he managed to renovate the marginal highway, spending 
$300,000, and even installing electrical utilities. As this drug 
trafficker has mentioned, there were no Army personnel there at 
that time; they arrived later. 
  [Montoya] How much was "Vaticano" moving as regular 
shipments? 
  [Taboada] "Vaticano" claimed that it was more profitable for 
him to lease the landing strip than to engage in collecting and 
shipping drugs. He was leasing his landing strip for $15,000 per 
flight, and it is his claim that there were about 20 to 25 
flights per month. 
  [Montoya] Drug dealing is a financial activity that can 
corrupt people. Have there been any cases of this kind in the 
directorate that you head? 
  [Taboada] As human beings, we sometimes make mistakes, and 
it 
is due to such a mistake that I am there (in the DINANDRO). You 
may recall the case of the son of the drug trafficker, "Mosco 
Loca," who was released. Those responsible were a colonel, a 
commander, and a captain. For that reason, there was a series of 
transfers of officials who had been working together for over 
two years. During my administration no cases have appeared, and 
I have been there for six months. 
  [Montoya] We are witnessing a drop in the price of PBC, and 
there is much talk about the international drug traffic's 
potential opportunity with poppies. How has the DINANDRO been 
monitoring this product, the base for heroin? 
  [Taboada] There has been considerable talk of poppies. A 
television channel showed poppies in the San Martin zone 
bordering Moyobamba and Rodriguez de Mendoza Provinces. We 
reached the site that had been identified as a growing zone and, 
according to the video that we have, it is a poppy variety that 
is useless for extracting gum or latex (components for heroin). 
To give an idea, the capsule, or bud, must be pear-shaped, and 
the one that they showed was small, resembling a peanut with a 
shell, on which incisions could not be made to extract the gum. 
  We have checked other areas, in northern Moyobamba, north of 
Rioja, where the same type exists; and we reached Jaen, with the 
same results. 
  [Montoya] What is the drug traffic's future? 
  [Taboada] We are progressing well. We have been outfitting a 
coordinating office to monitor the components of basic paste. 
The Ministry of Industry, the DINANDRO, the Public Prosecutor's 
Office, and the Sunat [National Tax Administration 
Superintendency] have been integrated into this office. We are 
also connected to terminals that have sufficient range for 
monitoring producers, importers, exporters, warehouses, 
carriers, sellers, and resellers. In other words, the monitoring 
reaches 80 percent and, when this outfitting is completed, we'll 
achieve 100 percent. 
  [Montoya] Is the drug traffic currently a priority for the 
National Police of Peru? 
  [Taboada] In fact, since last year, since September if I'm 
not mistaken, we have begun attaching greater importance to the 
interdiction of the drug traffic. You must have heard through 
the news media that the DINCOTE's [National Counterterrorism 
Directorate] personnel are going to be reduced. What will be 
reinforced is the DINANDRO's activity, in order to achieve 
greater success. 
  [Montoya] Minister Briones has stated that, in 1994, he 
expects the DINANDRO to become an office with success similar to 
that of the DINCOTE. Do you all feel identified with this kind 
of expectation on the part of your superior chiefs? 
  [Taboada] It is not merely an expectation or desire that is 
involved, but also logistical support. They are backing us so as 
to convert us, this year, into the police unit that will accrue 
outstanding success. 
  [Montoya] Does this apply to your personnel's income and 
bonuses, as well? 
  [Taboada] A system is being introduced whereby we give 
bonuses to the personnel, but according to the number of 
seizures, and not daily or monthly. 
<H5>  PBC Prices Falling: Drug Traffic Reorganizing in Peru? </H5>
  In the case of Peru, the price of washed PBC, the principal 
illegal export product, has virtually plummeted thus far in the 
1990's. At first glance, this would appear to affect the 
influence of cash flow from this activity on the Peruvian 
economy. Nevertheless, at the same time, the drop in basic paste 
prices could be one of the leading economic factors in the 
expansion of coca crops on nearly all of the Peruvian jungle 
border. However, it is also an incentive for growing other 
crops, such as poppies, which are still incipient in Peru. 
  One possibility is that a period of reorganizing this 
illegal 
activity is beginning, wherein coca derivatives will continue to 
be the main product, but with an outcome not yet possible to 
predict. It is likely that this downward price trend will 
continue. However, it is also important that an impetus be given 
to the alternative development projects, as a centerpiece of the 
antidrug plans.

  [Text] Montevideo, 19 Apr (EFE) -- The Army Command has 
officially reported in Montevideo that nine Uruguayan officers 
from the UN peacekeeping forces in Rwanda, who had been 
surrounded in Kigali, were evacuated to Kenya today. 
  The "blue helmets" are now in Nairobi in UN service, and are 
awaiting orders before returning to their country. 
  The Uruguayan Army public relations office noted that the 
United Nations was reducing its personnel in Rwanda, and that a 
small mission alone would remain. 
  Another four Uruguayan officers, among the 25 Uruguayan 
officers who were acting as observers in Rwanda, are in the 
interior of the country and in border areas, ready to leave for 
Uganda. 
  Two Uruguayan officers were injured in Rwanda two weeks ago 
by a machine-gun burst shortly after the tribal fighting began. 
  The two injured officers, who are out of danger, have also 
been evacuated by the United Nations. 
  The Army reported that another five officers had left for 
Uganda before, and that a similar number was in Montevideo on 
vacation when the conflict broke out, and received orders to not 
return to Rwanda.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu by </F>
unidentified reporter; place and date not given] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [EL PAIS] When will you leave 
the Foreign Ministry? 
  [Abreu] I have not decided yet. I am working as if I were 
staying until the end of this administration. There are a lot of 
things I still want to do and promote. I am not contemplating 
retiring from the service, unless there are political reasons. 
For the time being we have not made any decision. There is no 
job incompatibility. 
  We have to be careful about the negative influence of 
partisan activities on the Foreign Ministry because this 
portfolio is an instrument of the country's foreign policies. 
  [EL PAIS] Many people mention June.... 
  [Abreu] We have no date. That is just speculation which 
sometimes spreads in the very special climate of the Foreign 
Ministry. We do not have any dates or definitions. They will 
appear at the right time. We are working as if we were staying 
until 1 March 1995. However, a political decision or internal 
definitions by the president of the Republic might interrupt the 
mandate any time. He said very clearly: Ministers are the fuses 
in the fusebox of the executive branch. 
  [EL PAIS] Will the issue of the common external tariff 
system 
be defined in June? 
  [Abreu] Yes, 30 June is the deadline for a definition. 
Technical studies have already defined 80 to 85 percent of the 
issue. Some issues like petrochemistry, informatics, and capital 
goods are still pending. 
  We have still to decide the degree of protection Argentina, 
Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay will have with respect to third 
countries, not based on a model of imports substitution or the 
idea of creating a fortress, but to achieve a dynamic insertion 
into other integration schemes. 
  [EL PAIS] This means that the level of common external 
tariffs will be low. 
  [Abreu] Exactly. This is why Uruguay established 20 percent 
as the maximum tariff. Who would have thought four, five, or six 
years ago that we would be considering such a low tariff level, 
particularly when our countries installed an important 
protectionist system for their industries and other activities, 
that sometimes went over 100 percent. 
  The process shows that the concepts of economic opening and 
integration have become compatible and have replaced previous 
integration concepts which promoted the model of import 
substitution and contemplated very high tariffs to protect 
internal industries. 
  [EL PAIS] But there has been a move to impose other 
obstacles 
to integration, even within Mercosur [Common Market of the 
South]. For instance the consumer defense code approved in 
Brazil or the quality controls or technical norms established by 
Argentina. Has this problem been insufficiently resolved, that 
is, if we want to prevent the lifting of new shields behind old 
economic borders? 
  [Abreu] That is a good question because it shows that beyond 
the political willingness there are interests and situations 
oriented to hinder this process of trade liberalization. 
  Each country and each economy has interest groups defending 
its own situation by pressuring to maintain privileges and 
protect its interests. They want to maintain their markets and 
avoid being exposed to competition where quality and price might 
displace them from consumers' preference. 
  All obstacles are used. Obstacles can be administrative, on 
quality, and now--for instance through GATT--on issues like the 
environment. "Social dumping," which in some ways is justified, 
can also hide protectionist intentions. That is what we 
permanently do. We not only denounce these obstacles, we work on 
them because the main enemy of integration and the forces used 
to liberalize trade is the failure to fulfill deadlines. This 
failure is sometimes caused by interests, or political or 
circumstantial decisions which sometimes have more power than 
obligations. The importation of subsidized products, or dumping, 
will hurt those involved in these processes. 
  [EL PAIS] How did Uruguay take [Brazilian President] 
"Itamar's [Franco] Initiative" to create a Latin American free 
trade zone by 2010? 
  [Abreu] Uruguay's integration strategy is clearly defined. 
We 
understand that all integration mechanisms in Latin America, 
including NAFTA, are modular and complementary. 
  We support the idea of discussing all these integration 
processes to prevent them from becoming islands or broadened 
import substitution models. We conceive them as complementary 
efforts leading to a hemispheric free trade zone. 
  We do not see the Andean Pact, the Group of Three, NAFTA, or 
even the Brazilian proposal as being against or incompatible 
with our regional integration scheme, Mercosur. 
  [EL PAIS] But they are all different.... 
  [Abreu] Yes, they are all different and have different 
priorities. We believe--and we have said this more than 
once--that Uruguay bets on two things: Political realism and 
legal security. Realism tells us that Uruguay must recognize 
that there are processes in the world that will not wait for us 
to change before becoming effective. 
  Therefore, we must adapt to those changes, as in the case of 
NAFTA, or the new forms of commercial relations currently 
materializing in the developed world. 
  But that realism must be made compatible with legal 
security, 
which means credibility in the different integration processes 
in which we participate. 
  We should not let ourselves be guided by anxiety or wonder. 
We should not join new integration models, leaving aside what we 
are creating--projects that are already at an advanced stage. 
  We will take note of all proposals as long as the other 
Mercosur member countries recognize that the priority is to 
consolidate this process. 
  We should finish building our Mercosur free trade zone, with 
its known exceptions, and then, in due time, attack the 
exceptions. 
  We must approve a common external tariff system in order to 
fulfill our treaty requirements. We must also approve norms on 
institutional structures, certificates of origin, and regulation 
on the different exceptional regimes that are today listed in 
the subregion, such as the free trade zones and the "draw back" 
[preceding two words in English] temporary admission mechanisms. 
All these should be put together in a package supposing strength 
and clarity to fulfill the obligations among the four partners. 
  We are willing to take note of all other integration 
processes, but not to deactivate one process to activate another. 
  [EL PAIS] But Uruguay--President Lacalle said this 
recently--will present a proposal at the next Mercosur 
presidential summit to broaden the "4+1" concept [George Bush's 
proposal involving the four Mercosur member countries plus the 
United States] to "4+3" [Mercosur plus the United States, 
Mexico, and Canada]. Here is something new. Is this not a change 
in the integrating strategy? 
  [Abreu] Nothing will change because Uruguay has clearly and 
sharply supported NAFTA and has said that the agreement between 
Canada, the United States, and Mexico is positive from the point 
of view of international trade. It is a module to complement 
existing integration schemes. 
  Within this framework, Uruguay is proposing the famous 
reform 
of Article 44 of the Latin American Integration Association 
(ALADI) to grant legal security to these schemes, so that events 
might not replace the law, and the norms regulating our trade 
relations might be adapted to this reality. This is the reason 
behind the expression realism with legal security. 
  When we encourage and take note of this integration process 
we also say that we are encouraging other complementary 
articulations with the United States within the framework of the 
"4+1" Treaty, but also within the framework of a "4+3" Treaty so 
that NAFTA and Mercosur can negotiate bilaterally within the 
"4+1" scheme, which is a negotiating and consultation agenda. 
  [EL PAIS] Will Uruguay's proposal eliminate the permanent 
problem created by Argentina "flirting" with NAFTA? 
  [Abreu] All that is part of the anticipation, I would say a 
political anticipation which does not have an exact legal 
foundation or anything concrete from the political viewpoint. 
These expressions have a certain projection but no basis. The 
important thing here is that the Asuncion Treaty establishes 
that relations between Mercosur member countries and other 
countries must be jointly undertaken. That is a legal obligation. 
  [EL PAIS] In other words, that is the only way in.... 
  [Abreu] Of course, there are no other possibilities, except 
for natural country to country talks. At the time of definition, 
however, our idea is to respect the Asuncion Treaty so that the 
four countries can relate to other integration systems through 
Mercosur--that is, as a block, as it was done with the United 
States through the "4+1." 
  The definition of a common external tariff system will 
follow 
this principle of negotiating as a block, which will be our 
point of reference and will characterize our relations with 
other states. 
  [EL PAIS] How will you resolve the problem of "social 
dumping" within Mercosur? Uruguay is one of the hardest hit by 
the problem. 
  [Abreu] First we must define how to handle the "social 
dumping" problem. There is a proposal that will be discussed 
within the framework of the GATT talks in Morocco. The proposal 
was presented by developed countries which are only now 
analyzing the fact that low salary levels will influence costs 
and product prices, which will give underdeveloped countries an 
advantage over countries with higher salary levels. 
  We cannot understand this as a protectionist measure. We 
must 
seek to level different salary levels so that salaries and 
competitiveness increase at the same time. 
  We cannot increase our competitiveness by depressing 
salaries, because that will affect workers' well-being. 
  [EL PAIS] The trend of every process of regional integration 
has never been to bet on a reduction .... 
  [Abreu] Precisely. This situation stems from the fact that 
there are heavily populated countries with abundant labor and 
relatively low wages. Obviously, this has a bearing on prices. 
  We have to take extreme care, however, to defend our wage 
levels so that once we enter into competition with others, wages 
will go up rather than down. 
  Uruguay plays a very important role on account of its 
location and social structure. We have partners like Brazil, 
where labor is cheaper and less qualified. It is also true that 
each country has to put its comparative advantages to good use 
in order to achieve a dynamic insertion in foreign markets. As 
we have better qualified labor, we must try to specialize in 
things that will take advantage of market niches, in which 
quality will be our main advantage. 
  These issues have to do with countries' strategies, but they 
should be considered from the viewpoint of social awareness in 
the true sense of the word, instead of using them for commercial 
purposes disguised as protection mechanisms.

<F P=106> ["Part" of interview with Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu by </F>
Heraclio Labandera; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Labandera] There are documents revealing that the 
United States is investing millions of dollars in birth control 
campaigns in developing countries through private and 
nongovernmental organizations. In the 1987-1992 period, $27 
million was allocated for nine Latin American countries, among 
them Uruguay. This fund grew to $75 million for the 1993-1998 
period. What are Uruguay's criteria for its population policies? 
  [Abreu] First, the Uruguayan definitions of its population 
structure, growth rate, and age structure make us aware that a 
country of approximately 186,000 sq km has a population of 3.5 
million, which is inappropriate for our territory. Consequently, 
the executive branch has a policy to foment immigration with 
concrete measures that seek to facilitate the settlement of 
foreigners in our country. 
  This means that Uruguay needs more people, more manpower, 
and 
more population, not only to increase the market but also to 
balance the population/territory ratio. 
  On the other hand, there is a migratory trend in Uruguay 
linked to a series of factors with repercussions in a particular 
population sector. The most worrisome migratory trend is that 
affecting young people, who go to seek new opportunities beyond 
our borders or better horizons thanks to labor qualifications 
with which they can obtain a comparative advantage. 
  This obviously influences a population policy that is also 
conditioned by "family planning," which has its own parameters 
and which the country has not set at the controversial levels 
existing in other countries, particularly on issues that are so 
sensitive like abortion. 
  Abortion in Uruguay is clearly addressed in the Penal Code. 
  But "family planning" is not linked to official or state 
definitions. It is oriented by advice obtained privately by 
citizens. 
  [Labandera] An International Conference on Population and 
Development, which might cause considerable controversy, is 
scheduled for September in Cairo. On the one hand, there is a 
group of countries that want to control population growth at the 
world level applying "neo-Malthusian" criteria, while on the 
other, there are countries that do not agree with birth control 
conditions. We can mention Brazil and Argentina, for example, 
countries for which credit has been conditioned on 
implementation of restrictive population policies, something the 
two countries have systematically opposed. Has this type of 
pressure been exerted on Uruguay? In such a case, is the country 
willing to pay the political cost of such pressure? 
  [Abreu] Look, Uruguay is studying the subject. Uruguay has a 
delegate to the International Conference on Population and 
Development, and a commission that is preparing for the Cairo 
meeting. 
  What I can tell you in advance is that Uruguay will not 
yield 
to any type of pressure on population policies seeking the 
reduction of the population by methods that are basically 
applied in societies that have a very high population growth 
rate. 
  If this has happened with Argentina and Brazil, just imagine 
what will happen with Uruguay, where we need more instead of 
fewer people. We obviously will not permit meddling in this 
area, if nothing else because of other reasons that should not 
be mentioned here. 
  We have defined a very clear policy for orienting the 
"family 
planning" system, but without the controls or restrictions that 
supposedly might be applied in other countries. 
  Especially because Uruguay is not accustomed to this type of 
pressure, because--among other things--of the principle of the 
sovereign equality of nations. 
  Consequently, unless self-control measures are adopted for 
political or legal reasons of an international nature, Uruguay 
will not accept impositions from abroad. 
  [Labandera] Will Uruguay and its Mercosur [Common Market of 
the South] partners seek a common position in this area, with a 
view toward the International Conference on Population and 
Development? 
  [Abreu] We are considering the issue. We have not yet 
established a clear definition, but it is part of our common 
strategy. The matter has not been directly raised within 
Mercosur, but we will debate it as positions on the subject 
become clearer.

<F P=106> [Interview with Economy Minister Ignacio de Posadas by </F>
correspondent Oscar Vilas in Guadalajara, Mexico; date not given] 
  [Text] [Vilas] What are the government projections for this 
year's trade balance? 
  [De Posadas] Last year we forecast a decline in our trade 
balance deficit. We assumed imports would level off because our 
country cannot continue this rampant buying spree abroad. 
Capital goods and durable goods are not imported forever. We 
calculated that the trade balance deficit would level off 
through a reduction of imports. We are now seeing an increase in 
exports, especially to the Brazilian market. We are seeing price 
increases in some products like rice, wool, and meat. Rice 
prices have increased substantially, wool prices have increased 
slightly, and there is a good market for meat. Exports to Brazil 
increased about 30 percent last year and it is believed that the 
current stabilization program will cause price adjustments in 
Brazil and increased trade. 
  [Vilas] The latest published government management results 
show an exponential increase in government spending, which has 
gone up by 25 percent. How does the government view this? 
  [De Posadas] Last year's investments have been carried over 
to this year. Current expenditures have not increased; 
investments account for most of government's expenditures and we 
have already set a ceiling on them. Moreover, tax collections 
exceeded original estimates by nearly $11 million. 
  [Vilas] How can the government fix investment levels? 
  [De Posadas] We are working on a decree to fix government 
investments. We have again spoken with executive board members 
from public enterprises urging them to adjust their investments 
to what has been budgeted. The total amount that the central 
government and public companies will save totals some $150 
million. And yet, this year's investment levels will be higher 
than last year's, which in turn exceeded benchmark levels. We 
have to undertake this to ease the pressure off accrued 
expenditures, which have a bearing on the entire economy. 
  [Vilas] The United States has increased its interest rates 
to 
stave off inflation. Argentina has followed suit to prevent the 
loss of international reserves. Is Uruguay contemplating 
increasing interest rates to help its fight against inflation? 
  [De Posadas] It is unfeasible to set interest rates in a 
country the size of Uruguay. Besides, we have a very open market 
with a considerable inflow of capital to date. What do we stand 
to gain by increasing interest rates? Nothing. What is the use 
of increasing interest rates for transactions in pesos? It will 
only make investors turn to the peso in droves. They will sell 
dollars; thus exerting more pressure on the exchange rate and 
triggering an increase in reserves. It is not worth it. 
  [Vilas] Is there a project to place Uruguayan debt bonds on 
other markets, like Japan for example? 
  [De Posadas] We are studying that possibility. We must 
follow 
a similar line of reasoning as before. Given Japanese interest 
rates, we must assess if it is really worthwhile. We pay very 
low interest rates. The degree of acceptance or trust in 
Uruguayan securities is very high. It would be attractive, 
though, to gain a foothold in another market. 
  [Vilas] Industry Minister Eduardo Ache proposed a 
debt-for-investment swap in order to attract capital. How does 
the Economy Ministry view this initiative? 
  [De Posadas] He had that idea. I have not seen any concrete 
project on it. The subject should be carefully considered 
because it has a very high cost for our country and we must 
analyze if it is cost-effective.

  [Text] Montevideo, 20 Apr (AFP-NA) -- Eleuterio Fernandez 
Huidobro, the top leader of the former Tupamaros guerrilla 
movement, today announced his resignation from the leadership of 
the group because of internal disagreements that currently 
divide the Uruguayan left into "moderates" and "radicals." 
  "I am leaving because I do not want to participate in 
internal debates; I do not want to participate in fratricidal 
struggles," Fernandez Huidobro said in a brief explanation to 
the press on the reasons that led him to resign. 
  The former leader of the Tupamaros--a movement that in the 
1960's tried to impose socialism in Uruguay through force and 
then in 1980 chose the democratic way of life after its military 
defeat--is a member of the "radical" sector of the Broad Front 
coalition, which includes the communists and the socialists. 
  Fernandez Huidobro's resignation comes seven months before 
the presidential and legislative elections in which the Broad 
Front is placed by the polls as the country's second biggest 
political force. 
  The former guerrilla chief warned: "I do not want to harm 
the 
left, and for that reason I will not comment any further; but 
when they want me to fight against the common enemy, then I am 
at the service of the Uruguayan people and the Tupamaros."

<F P=106> [Report by Gregorio Salazar] </F>
  [Text] The Miraflores Presidential Palace was engulfed in a 
foul and irritating cloud yesterday morning, as police used tear 
gas at the nearby Fermin Toro High School. The sound of gas 
canisters going off and bird shot rifles being fired at the 
demonstrators served as a backdrop to a news conference by 
General Barry McCaffrey, commander of the U.S. Southern Command. 
Gen. McCaffrey is here to discuss regional security and drug 
trafficking matters. 
  Interior Minister Ramon Escovar Salom made a midmorning 
statement: "We are living in an atmosphere of tranquility, 
stability, and trust in the government. The polls and what the 
people on the street are saying demonstrates this." 
  Reporters focused their attention on the pipe bombs placed 
at 
the doors of the of Banco Latino. This forced the minister to 
say that "these events do not have the significance or the 
weight that some people would like to give them..., and they are 
not big enough to pose any kind of threat to the nation." 
  When addressing a question about the identity of those 
responsible for what he called "these scattered uprisings," he 
answered with a question: "Who do these attacks against the 
Banco Latino benefit or who could they benefit at this moment in 
time? Ask yourselves those same questions. I am not going to 
answer it. Let public opinion make up its own mind." 
  "None of those responsible for yesterday's events has any 
real political significance." The minister was not clear; the 
reporters presumed that he meant the government employees' 
strike and the farmers' demonstration at the Central Bank of 
Venezuela last Wednesday. 
  Another ongoing investigation is one looking into alleged 
terrorist plans, based on a report by Zulia State Governor 
Lolita Aniyar against ranchers in the Perija region. Escovar 
said that the commission he sent there has interviewed many 
people and that even the director of the weapons and explosives 
department was in Zulia. 
  The minister also said that he did not know if Commander 
Hugo 
Chavez was planning any sort of uprising or conspiracy. Finally, 
the minister gave a flat "no comment" to a question about the 
"switch" on the Board of Directors of Aeropostal, allegedly 
carried out by Gustavo Velazquez and Mrs. Tarazona. 
  Some reporters rewound their audio cassettes to listen to 
the 
minister's opening statements: "We are living in an atmosphere 
of tranquility, stability, and trust...."

<F P=106> [Report by Raima Rondon from "The News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Finance Minister Julio Sosa Rodriguez disagrees with 
the tax exemption for house rentals, slated to go up to 5 
million bolivares [Bs], as specified by the Special Powers Act. 
  The executive branch has requested that tax exemptions be 
established on the basis of Bs750,000. However, the Special 
Powers Act cites exemptions for school, medical, and dental 
expenses, as well as for mortgage interest on principal 
residences, also to the tune of Bs5 million. 
  Both Congress and the finance minister agree with the latter 
exemptions. 
  [Begin Sosa recording] They have established tax exemptions 
of up to 5,000 tax units, which means Bs5 million on interest 
for principal residences. I agree with this. They have also 
established a tax exemption for house rentals that I believe is 
exaggerated as it amounts to Bs5 million. This will eventually 
have to be included in a law. But we will have to obey the terms 
of the Special Powers Act. I do believe that Congress could 
modify this in the future, preferably before the year ends, 
because a Bs5 million per annum tax exemption for house rentals 
seems exaggerated to me. [end recording] 
  Minister Sosa added that he was at Miraflores to attend a 
meeting of the economic cabinet with President Rafael Caldera 
that would establish a schedule for implementing the Special 
Powers Act.

<F P=106> [Report by Cecilia Pachano from "The News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The Council of Ministers approved in its session 
this afternoon the three first decrees contemplated in the 
Special Powers Act. These decrees allowed the Council of 
Ministers to promulgate the Law on Bank Debits, Law on 
Concessions for Construction and Maintenance of Public Works, 
and Law on Reforms of the Public Budget Law. 
  Regarding the Law on Bank Debits, the only modification made 
to the original draft bill was that stock market operations will 
only be taxed for first operations and will maintain the 0.75 
percent profitability rate. This law will go into effect on 2 
May. The government hopes to collect 100 billion bolivares with 
its implementation. 
  Regarding the Law on Concessions for Construction and 
Maintenance of Public Works, it is estimated its passage will 
promote the construction of public works, benefiting the 
community which will receive these new works and the state, 
which will not disburse any money for their construction. 
  [Begin Guillermo Alvarez, Central Information Office 
minister, recording] The profit margins offered by the past law 
ranged from 40 to 45 percent of the investment, which was 
evidently not attractive for investors. Now we have placed the 
profit margin at 75 percent. It may even reach 90 percent 
eventually with the authorization of Congress. 
  This is very important because it permits us to undertake 
works the government would have otherwise been unable to take 
on. [end recording] 
  As was known previously, the Law on Reforms of the Public 
Budget Law only contemplates the modification in the 
presentation date, which for the first quarter of the year was 
moved to the first 15 days of the month of June.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Venezuelan economic developments monitored through 19 
April. 
  A study by oil specialist Leonardo Montiel Ortega indicates 
Venezuelan refineries overseas, far from being profit makers, 
produce net losses of more than $96.3 million. These losses are 
due to the $.86 price differential at which Venezuela sells its 
crude to the refinery Citgo in the United States. Venezuela 
dispatched to that refinery 305,000 barrels during 1993, at an 
average price of $13.01 a barrel, while the average price for 
Venezuelan crude was $13.87. In addition, this refinery does not 
process heavy oils, resulting in diminished Venezuelan sale 
possibilities. Montiel recommends these loss makers be sold. 
(Caracas EL UNIVERSAL in Spanish 11 April 1994 p 1-21] 
  Mexico is backing Venezuela' efforts to get the 
Brussels-based Customs Affairs Council to accept its Oremulsion 
as a bituminous oil and thus avoid tariff difficulties in world 
markets. Venezuela has no vote or veto power in the council and 
has enlisted Mexico's assistance. Venezuelan Petroleum President 
Luis Giusti estimates Venezuelan oil will fetch $10.50 a barrel, 
but he did not rule out the possibility of reaching $11.50, the 
budgeted amount for 1994. A recent decision by the European 
Union Nomenclature Committee classified Oremulsion as a bitumen 
(Code 2714), which increases the possibility of placing greater 
volumes of oil on the world market. (Caracas EL NACIONAL in 
Spanish 14 April 94 E-8) 
  The Council of Ministers approved an initiative on 13 April 
to raise urban minimum wages to 15,000 bolivares, 12,500 
bolivares in rural areas. Observers believe, considering the 
state of the Venezuelan economy and the constant protests by the 
public and private sector, this increase in the minimum wage 
will be well received. An important aspect of this decree, which 
was not disclosed to the media because certain adjustments were 
still pending at the time of approval, is that only 30 percent 
of the increase will be used as a base rate to estimate 
contributions to social security, a possibility already 
anticipated in Articles 138 and 171 of the Labor Code. (Caracas 
ECONOMIA HOY in Spanish 14 April 94 p. 3)

<F P=106> [Interview with International Economic Relations Under </F>
Secretary Jorge Campbell by Claudia Boragni; place and date not 
given] 
  [Text] [Boragni] Was the previous Radical administration 
also concerned about exports? 
  [Campbell] There has always been a need to boost exports. 
Argentina has a closed economy. 
  [Boragni] How can this trend be turned around? 
  [Campbell] We need a cultural change. There are very 
concrete cases that point to the ongoing reversal of this trend. 
I am referring to relations between Argentina and Brazil, in 
which bilateral trade rose from $1 billion yearly to $6 billion. 
  [Boragni] Does the trade deficit constitute a source of 
concern for the government? 
  [Campbell] It depends on how we analyze it. From the 
viewpoint of imports, they are composed to a great extent of 
capital goods. This means that investments are being made in the 
country. But it is also true that we have to boost exports. 
  [Boragni] Are you thinking about instruments for export 
promotion? 
  [Campbell] Those of us who work at the Foreign Ministry do 
not design instruments. That is incumbent upon the Economy 
Ministry. We work at trade promotion through the Argentine 
Export Foundation. 
  [Boragni] Are you not concerned about the 26 percent drop in 
commodity exports in January? 
  [Campbell] Under no circumstances would I draw conclusions 
based on the results of only one month. Concerning January's 
exports in particular, the largest importer of Argentine 
commodities was Brazil. Exports to Brazil have grown 
considerably. 
  [Boragni] Is not January's $585.6 million trade deficit a 
cause for concern when we compare it with January 1993's deficit 
of $136.6 million? 
  [Campbell] The trade deficit is, undoubtedly, weighty, but I 
reiterate that it is not worrisome from the standpoint of 
imports. As long as the exchange rate remains stable, there will 
be an inflow of capital. 
  [Boragni] Is it not incompatible to contemplate joining 
NAFTA 
when the United States and Canada are Argentina's competitors 
with regard to agricultural products? 
  [Campbell] One must bear in mind that when countries sit at 
the negotiating table, they discuss all these questions. 
Compromise always comes later. 
  [Boragni] While at the beginning it was said that Argentina 
would try to join NAFTA through Mercosur [Common Market of the 
South], now everybody talks about unilateral negotiations with 
the United States. 
  [Campbell] At the beginning, we devised the so-called "Four 
Plus One" strategy, which led to the beginning of talks between 
Mercosur and the United States. Nevertheless, this does not 
prevent any country from negotiating on an individual basis. 
  [Boragni] NAFTA offers a huge market but also entails keen 
competition. 
  [Campbell] Argentina has been making headway in its trade 
standards. When a country wants to compete, it can do so.

<F P=106> [Report by Patricia Hernandez G.] </F>
  [Text] President Carlos Salinas de Gortari said during the 
75th anniversary of the International Labor Organization (ILO) 
that Mexico's entry into international economic arenas will take 
place with respect for traditional social politics, which 
constitutionally guarantee workers' rights. 
  "It is not a question of competing just for the sake of 
competing, but in order to boost the country's productive 
capability, with tangible benefit for Mexican workers," Salinas 
added. 
  The president said that in our country we have the force of 
law, the basis that guarantees compliance with social and labor 
rights. Much has been accomplished, but we know there is still 
much to do because there are still social needs and the 
requirements of isolated communities. 
  Salinas told labor representatives that training the work 
force is a strategic necessity. In Mexico, the worker comes 
first and is the subject of the change and purpose of the new 
arrangements to bolster quality of life and productivity. 
  In our country, Salinas said, workers are the basic element 
at the forefront of change. We inherited a sociopolitical 
tradition that cares especially for the rights of workers, and 
our Constitution clearly states that respect for their rights is 
an overriding and substantive aspect of development. 
  In a ceremony in the Manuel Avila Camacho room in Los Pinos 
Presidential Palace, Salinas de Gortari explained that Mexican 
social institutions are meant to guarantee the quality of life 
of their workers through access to medical services, dignified 
housing, adequate work conditions, participation in business 
utilities, and insured retirement savings. 
  Mexicans, he added, understand productivity as an essential 
element to make more effective our labor legislation guarantees. 
If our businesses are more competitive, there are more jobs, 
better wages, and job stability and viability are guaranteed. 
  Boosting productivity is fully compatible with the strictest 
respect for workers' rights. That is why we want to efficiently 
compete in the international market for goods and services, he 
said. 
  In addition, we have contributed to setting a worldwide 
precedent with NAFTA. We negotiated a special package of labor 
standards, respectful of the environment, always in agreement 
with our laws, and taking into account our labor laws, Salinas 
said. 
  Mexico -- Salinas told the union representatives, 
businessmen, and workers -- is a country that builds for the 
21st century, to come out ahead in democracy and freedom, and 
compete efficiently in international markets. 
  We reaffirm the traditional links of cooperation between 
Mexico and the ILO by signing the Inter-Institutional Agreement 
for Agreed Actions [Acuerdo Interinstitucional para la 
Concertacion de Acciones] between the Labor and Social Welfare 
Secretariat and the ILO. The agreement is part of the new 
policies of cooperation with the ILO with the creation of more 
effective agreement mechanisms to raise the workers' quality of 
life and labor. 
  Labor Secretary Arsenio Farell Cubillas said that the ILO, 
which has its own legal basis, is part of the state of law that 
keeps tabs on all political organizations in society. 
  Also present were Emilio Morgado, acting director of the 
regional ILO office for Latin America; Fidel Velazquez, 
secretary general of the Confederation of Mexican Workers; and 
Genaro Borrego, director IMSS [Mexican Social Security 
Institute].

  [Text] San Jose, 20 Apr (ACAN-EFE) -- Costa Rican 
Presidency Minister Rolando Lacle today denied that relations 
between his country and the United States suffered a serious 
setback during the current administration, as various sectors 
claim. 
  Lacle said that "we have enjoyed good relations" with the 
United States, despite "certain discrepancies" following the 
expropiation of a farm in northern Costa Rica from a U.S. 
citizen who asked that the United States apply sanctions against 
Costa Rica. This sanction aimed freezing a $250 million IDB 
loan at the beginning of 1993, an idea that was finally vetoed 
in Costa Rica's favor following intense diplomatic efforts by 
San Jose. 
  The Santa Elena Hacienda, comprised of 15,000 hectares, is 
now part of a national park bordering Nicaragua. The property 
is claimed by John Hamilton. By mutual consent the case has 
been submitted to international arbitration in order to 
establish its true value 15 years after its confiscation. 
  Another incident that created tension between Costa Rica and 
the United States was a claim by U.S. trade unions about alleged 
labor right violations by Costa Rican authorities. Following 
negotiations, Costa Rica managed to have the charges dropped, 
which had been filed with the U.S. commerce secretary. In 
exchange, Costa Rica promised to support a series of labor 
reforms, some of which are still being discussed by the 
Legislative Assembly, where they face strong opposition from 
certain deputies and chambers of commerce. 
  The Costa Rican Government, headed by Social Christian 
Rafael 
Angel Calderon, ends its tenure on 8 May when Social Democrat 
Jose Maria Figueres takes office. Today, Figueres ends a visit 
to the United States where he has met with authorities.

<F P=106> [Report by Roberto Reyes on interview with Honduran </F>
President Carlos Roberto Reina by unidentified reporters at the 
Government House in Tegucigalpa on 20 April -- recorded] 
  [Text] We have remarks by President Carlos Roberto Reina 
referring to the Honduran Government's and Army's plan to modify 
the 40-year-old treaty dealing with U.S. military aid for 
Honduras. The president spoke about this initiative, which he 
said is not official. Asked why the Armed Forces rather than 
the executive branch took the initiative on this, he said the 
source of the initiative does not matter. Here is President 
Carlos Roberto Reina: 
  [Begin recording] [Reporter, in progress] ...the Honduran 
Government's initiative to modify the Military Assistance Treaty 
with the United States. 
  [Reina] Statements have been made. They are not official. 
The issue is going to be discussed by Honduran Government 
officials and also by the various government branches. These 
agreements were implemented at a time when there was a different 
situation in the world. It was the time of the Cold War and the 
polarization of states and minds. It is a phase that has been 
completely overcome. The new agenda is one of coming together in 
favor of mankind. At the right time, in agreement with U.S. 
Government representatives, we will sit down to review these 
agreements and treaties, some of which are very old, dating back 
40 years. In this way, we will be able to update the forms of 
cooperation in all fields with the great democracy represented 
by the United States of America and its excellent president, Mr. 
Bill Clinton. 
  [Reporter] When would this take place? We spoke with the 
U.S. ambassador just a few moments ago, and he said they are 
ready to begin reviewing these agreements. 
  [Reina] If U.S. Government representatives, who are very 
honorably represented by Mr. Pryce, are ready, at any time you 
might hear news that we are sitting down to review the 
agreements to which some protocols were added at times of great 
tension in Central America and the world. 
  [Reporter] What would [words indistinct]. 
  [Reina] The subject is military. These are military 
agreements. Cooperation is now more directed toward human 
development. That is one way of beginning to address the 
problem of the military presence. 
  [Reporter] The question the people are most interested in is 
the issue of the Palmerola military base. Will this base 
continue to operate in Honduras or will the U.S. troops leave? 
  [Reina] We return to the same topic: the presence of that 
base, which is legally Honduran. Its name is the Soto Cano 
base. It is under the sponsorship of the Honduran Government. 
It was established at a time of great tension for Honduras and 
Central America. It is logical that we review and update the 
structure of cooperation. At that time, it was believed 
cooperation should be military, because tensions were so great. 
  We think that at present cooperation should involve other 
areas, such as environment, health, education, human rights, and 
drug trafficking. For example, we must not allow this scourge 
known as drug trafficking to continue to hurt Honduras. In this 
regard, I will say this to the ambassador and to you: We are 
your ally in waging a frontal assault against scourges that 
cause so much damage to humanity. 
  [Reporter] Mr. President, this has been interpreted as an 
initiative of the military institution and not of the executive 
branch, as it should be. 
  [Reina] A military issue is involved. They are also part of 
Honduras. They are an institution, constitutionally speaking. 
They took an initiative. Now is the time to resume discussions 
without innuendoes and without pulling out cards from under the 
table. 
  [Reporter] [question indistinct] 
  [Reina] They proposed a review. The ambassador said he 
agrees, and I also fully agree. The Congress must review this. 
I wonder if you recall -- if you have a good memory -- that 
there was much discussion when the protocols came up. In my 
opinion, those protocols should have been brought before the 
National Congress, because constitutionally speaking, military 
issues should be (?discussed) at the National Congress. 
  [Reporter] When will such a discussion take place? 
  [Reina] They will take place in more calm times, in times of 
less confrontation and very sincere cooperation. 
  [Reporter] [words indistinct] U.S. ambassador that there is 
a possibility that, once the Southern Command closes down, some 
soldiers from that base might be transferred to the Palmerola 
Base? 
  [Reina] I think you are moving ahead of the negotiations and 
discussions. This is theoretical. This issue should be 
discussed and its approval should be in keeping with the 
interests of our power [nuestro poder]. 
  [Reporter]) I would like to change the topic, Mr. President. 
How does the people's constant criticisms, justified or not, 
about the energy crisis facing the country harm or suffocate 
your government? 
  [Reina] It is unfair to criticize the government for this 
crisis. The government, which is only three months old, did not 
create this crisis. We are trying to resolve it quickly. This 
crisis is the result of mistakes made by serveral past 
administrations. We will not take revenge by claiming only the 
previous government made mistakes. Any lack of foresight and 
problems linked to the Francisco Morazan Dam must be resolved by 
this government. It is completely unfair to criticize the 
government for trying to resolve these problems. 
  [Reporter] [words indistinct] declare an emergency over this 
energy crisis, because the [words indistinct]. 
  [Reina] I am not trying to lay blame. I am trying to say 
that it is unfair to criticize us, because we are trying to find 
a solution. I spoke to the minister of [word indistinct] today. 
The chief of the ENEE [National Enterprise for Electric Power] 
is abroad looking for aid from friendly countries. Everyone 
must help resolve this crisis. 
  Using this as a political tool against the government is 
totally unfair and absurd. We are the ones who will resolve 
this problem. We did not decree an emergency. There is an 
emergency because blackouts are seriously damaging the country's 
economy. We want to resolve this problem as soon as possible. 
This morning, I made some decisions to ensure [words 
indistinct] before 10 May. 
  [Reporter] [words indistinct] privileged areas. 
  [Reina] I have fought for justice all my life. I am not 
going to shy away from the problems of the Honduran people. [end 
recording]

  [Text] "I will never believe that one Sandinist is capable 
of killing another, because I have faith in the loyalty and 
honesty of my comrades. Nevertheless, I also believe that 
reckless statements should not be made at Sandinist departmental 
meetings, not even jokingly, because they are in bad taste," 
Sergio Ramirez said yesterday. 
  Last week, LA PRENSA reported that supporters of Daniel 
Ortega recommended during a departmental meeting in Leon that 
the leaders who did not agree with the current orthodox 
leadership of the party be killed [eliminar fisicamente]. 
  "I heard these rumors, and Monica Baltodano (of the 
so-called 
Pikin Guerrero trend) informed me this was a joke. We discussed 
this matter in the Sandinist Assembly, and I expressed my 
opposition to this kind of thing," stressed Ramirez, who has 
been the target of attacks by sectors close to Ortega. 
  Ramirez said it is dangerous to enter into confrontation 
within the FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation Front] because, 
according to him, this could create "difficult" situations for 
those people who are the targets of the attacks. 
  "If they insist on insults and accusations -- such as 
selling 
out to imperialism, or selling out to the right -- this indeed 
creates a tense atmosphere that is somehow dangerous," asserted 
Ramirez, who is a member of the FSLN National Directorate. He 
added that he condemns this kind of behavior "in both currents." 
  "I recently heard on a radio program (Radio Ya) that I was a 
cancerous member in a healthy body (FSLN), and that I should 
therefore be cut out of the body. I do not know what they were 
implying by saying that I be cut out," Ramirez complained, 
reiterating his belief that ideas should be discussed with 
respect and not with insults. 
  Sergio Ramirez and Daniel Ortega are the individuals who 
currently lead two currents of opinion struggling to control the 
FSLN. 
  Political observers have termed Ramirez's supporters 
"moderates," while the followers of the FSLN secretary general 
have been labeled "hardliners and orthodox." 
  Also, Ramirez, former vice president of the Republic, 
reiterated his presidential aspirations for the 1996 elections, 
in response to a reporter's question. 
  "My categorical answer is yes, because it is a right 
bequeathed by the Nicaraguan Constitution. I have legitimate 
aspirations like everyone else," Ramirez stressed. 
  Later, Ramirez, leader of the Sandinist legislative wing, 
suggested that the FSLN presidential candidate come from the 
party's rank-and-file and be chosen in primary elections "not by 
a small group." His statement came in open defiance of the 
election system that has traditionally existed within his party. 
  Months ago, Ramirez stated his presidential aspirations to 
the FSLN National Directorate. This resulted in pro-Ortega 
media, in particular Radio Ya and Radio La Primerisima, 
launching a severe campaign to discredit and insult him. 
  "I do not aspire to run for vice president, because I have 
already outgrown such a position," Ramirez asserted 
categorically. 
  "I want all Sandinists to understand that I will not leave 
the FSLN, even if the current I support turns out to be the 
minority. I will continue to be a Sandinist, either within the 
leadership or the rank-and-file," Ramirez remarked. 
  At this point, with a little more than a month before the 
party's Congress (20 May), Ramirez indicated he has reserved the 
right to run for leadership positions within the FSLN. Sergio 
Ramirez believes the rights of individuals should be respected. 
"No one is authorized to tell others what they must do," he 
continued. 
  Ramirez made the aforementioned statements within the 
context 
of a struggle for control of the party -- a struggle in which 
people close to Ortega leaked a list of candidates to join the 
expanded National Directorate. Sergio Ramirez and Luis Carrion, 
promoters of the renewal of the FSLN, have been "purged" from 
this list. 
  Yesterday, Daniel Ortega declared that differences between 
Sandinist currents stem from the fact that one sector of the 
FSLN supports government policies, while the other sector 
opposes them and would be willing to resort to violent means. 
  "I do not agree with Ortega's opinion, because all of the 
activity Sandinism conducts with the government has the National 
Directorate's approval," Ramirez stressed. 
  He explained that relations with the government began with 
the signing of the transition protocol in 1990. "I did not even 
sign this agreement between the government and the National 
Directorate, because I was not then a member of that leadership 
organ," Ramirez said. 
  Ramirez ended by saying: "Every political party that loses 
an 
election enters into serious contradictions, and there are 
Sandinists who have not yet accepted this situation -- a 
situation of which I am very proud, because the FSLN showed its 
democratic calling by relinquishing power in the first free 
elections ever held in this country."

  [Text] The conclusion of the Uruguay round of GATT talks 
and the creation of the World Trade Organization, which took 
place in Marrakech, will have important consequences for 
Argentina. Tariffs applied on international agriculture and 
industrial trade will drop, and world agriculture protectionism 
will also start to decrease. Both aspects are very important for 
the Argentine economy. 
  A document disseminated by the Foreign Ministry contains a 
paragraph that has been annulled, but can still be read -- a 
suggestive fact -- which says: "This negotiation will require 
the introduction of important changes in current norms, and the 
adjustment of diverse economic activities." 
  Developed countries will reduce their average tariffs on 
industrial products by 40 percent and their mean tariff on 
agriculture products by 36 percent. There will be a drop in 
internal subsidies and a reduction of subsidized exports. 
Access to markets will be facilitated through the conversion of 
all non-tariff obstacles (quotas, variable rates, etc.) into 
tariffs and the progressive reduction of all tariffs. 
  The signing of the Sanitary and Plant Sanitation Agreement 
is 
important for Argentina because the country will now have a 
forum in which to complain when sanitary measures imposed on its 
exports are, in fact, non-tariff obstacles (a very frequent 
case). 
  It is being forecast that as a consequence of these 
agreements, world incomes will increase by $230 billion and 
world trade by about $745 billion by 2005. According to the 
Foreign Ministry analysis, however, more important than the 
figures is the fact that the climate of trade war and unilateral 
measures that threatened the economy in the past few years has 
been overcome. 
  In the area of tariffs, Argentina committed itself not to 
exceed certain protectionist ceilings. The situation does not 
change a thing, however, because the tariff system adopted by 
GATT is 35 percent, a full 10 percentage points above present 
tariff levels in Argentina and the common external tariff system 
that is being negotiated in the Mercosur [Common Market of the 
South]. 
  The document offers some details on the issue of 
agriculture. 
It says that the United States offered the country quotas for 
peanuts, peanut butter, and cheese in exchange for an increase 
in tariffs on peanuts and by-products. Europe also compensated 
Argentina for damages caused by European subsidies on oil 
producing crops. Besides, the country will receive an additional 
quota of 11,000 tonnes of high quality beef and participation in 
the quota of 500,000 tonnes of corn for Portugal. 
  Argentina also received substantial tariff concessions from 
the United States, Japan, and the European Union on grape must, 
leather, apples, pears, orange juice, and essential and 
vegetable oils. 
  Argentina will receive another important benefit with the 
world commitment to reduce budget spending on export subsidies 
by 36 percent and the actual volume of subsidized exports by 21 
percent. These benefits will come after a transitional period. 
  But the greatest benefits will come through the Sanitary and 
Plant Sanitation Agreement, as it will permit negotiations for 
the export of products that are today banned from markets such 
as those of the United States, Japan, and Korea. A condition is 
the creation of a local information service that will answer all 
requests for information made by other countries regarding 
sanitary procedures in effect in our country. 
  The agreement on customs valuation includes a clause that 
will favor Argentina, as it will allow it to request more 
information from importers when there are reasons to doubt the 
declared values are accurate.

  [Text] The Chilean Foreign Ministry reported that the 
French and Chilean Governments have signed a joint agreement on 
the protection of investments, which the Chilean Congress 
approved on 22 December 1992. 
  Roger Romani, minister delegate of relations with the 
Senate, 
noted the agreement's significance. He said that it represents 
an important change for Chilean international economic relations 
and an unusual agreement for France compared with those signed 
by any other Latin American countries. 
  Romani also commented on the new Chilean economic policy's 
guidelines during the Senate session in which the agreement was 
analyzed. He said: This economic policy "had significant 
results," such as controlled inflation, strong growth, and the 
renewed confidence of international financial organizations. 
  The Chilean Foreign Ministry also reported that (Andre 
Guaier), French defense and Armed Forces Foreign Affairs 
Committee coordinator, also pointed out the Chilean economy's 
success. Commenting on Chilean-French relations, (Guaier) said 
they are based on an active cooperation and development policy, 
a very open policy on credit guarantees, and the programming of 
investments through privileged financial cooperation.

  [Text] Cartagena de Indias (Colombia), 18 Apr (EFE) -- 
Colombian President Cesar Gaviria described today as "lacking in 
objectivity" a report issued by Amnesty International (AI) 
requesting the United States suspension of military aid to the 
Colombian Armed Forces, which AI accused of violating human 
rights. 
  "I have never denied there are human rights problems, but 
international organizations are not properly assessing things 
taking place in Colombia to protect fundamental principles," 
Gaviria stated to reporters in the Caribbean city of Cartagena 
de Indias. 
  AI, a human rights organization headquartered in London, 
asked the United States to suspend economic aid to the Colombian 
military because "the Colombian Armed Forces are a bridge for 
the violation of the rights of individuals." 
  According to the Colombian president, AI "lacks objectivity" 
in reporting how Colombia has managed the situation and how 
Colombia has protected human rights in past years, especially 
after the new National Constitution was promulgated in 1991. 
  The Colombian president underscored that the Armed Forces, 
when they combat insurgents, "cannot ever fall into the trap of 
imitating the guerrillas' behavior of intimidation, extortion, 
torture, kidnapping, and slaying and injuring soldiers and 
policemen, or putting them out of action." 
  Gaviria added: "Colombia has confronted persistent attacks 
against its democratic institutions for many years. The attacks 
come from organizations that receive economic resources from 
kidnapping and extortion activities." 
  He added, "To confront these groups, there is an 
overwhelming 
majority of members of the military and police forces who 
respect the law."

  [Text] President Rafael Caldera said yesterday that 
summoning a constituent assembly is not the solution to the 
country's problems. He also urged the Congress to include the 
impeachment referendum in the constitutional amendments to 
create a "truly participative" democracy. 
  The president noted Colombia's positive experience in this 
area, adding that it is possible to reform the system "without 
breaking the constitutional thread." 
  Speaking during the presentation of the book Venezuela, 
Crisis and Constitutional Reform at the Avila Hotel, he 
said he was among those who think the congressional debate on 
the reform should begin where the past legislature left off. In 
any case, a bicameral commission should be named to promptly 
update the study and to include new proposals. Caldera indicated 
four kinds of referenda must be included in the reforms: a 
referendum to impeach, a referendum to consult, a referendum to 
approve, and a referendum to confirm. As an example, he said a 
matter as important as the delimitation of marine and underwater 
areas with Colombia must be submitted to a popular consultation, 
"because a mere ratification by Congress would not be 
sufficient." 
  Regarding federalism, Caldera explained he views it as the 
adequate strengthening of administrative decentralization that 
avoids "the destructive abuses" of centralism but does not 
restore the vices of the old system of cronyism. 
  "I have been asked, not without malice, if now as president 
I 
continue supporting the possibility of revoking the mandate of 
the head of state and any top official, and I have said I would 
feel bad if it were not approved," he warned. The president said 
he is confident that the congressional debates will have a 
favorable outcome and that the stumbling blocks to a favorable 
outcome will be removed.

  [Text] Havana, 21 Apr (EFE) -- The official GRANMA 
newspaper today responded to rumors of a Fidel Castro illness in 
a brief note stating that the Cuban leader on Tuesday met with 
Mexican Fausto Alzati, director general of the National Council 
for Science and Technology (Conacyt). 
  A diplomat of the Mexican Embassy in Cuba who attended the 
meeting told EFE that he saw Castro "in perfect condition, as 
always. He even cracked jokes." 
  Sergio Tobar, scientific attache of the Mexican diplomatic 
mission, added that the meeting took place at the office of the 
Cuban leader and lasted about one hour. 
  The source said Castro and Alzati later went to the Mexican 
ambassador's residence in Havana to attend a reception, at which 
Castro stayed for 30 minutes. 
  This is the first time, since 2 April, that GRANMA has 
reported on an activity involving Castro, while the Cuban 
Foreign Relations Ministry yesterday denied he suffered a heart 
attack or a stroke. 
  A spokesman for the Foreign Relations Ministry said that 
Castro "is not scheduled" to attend the Conference on the Nation 
and Emigration, which will start tomorrow, but Castro will 
attend a special session of the National Assembly on 1 May. 
  [Paris AFP in Spanish at 1518 GMT carries a related 250-word 
Havana-datelined report quoting Sergio Tobar as stating Cuban 
President Fidel Castro is "in a perfect state of health," adding 
that "we saw him and he looked as usual, very spirited; he may 
have the flu [gripe]." The report adds that Castro later 
attended a cocktail party at the Mexican ambassador's residence, 
where he chatted with guests for 20 minutes.]

  [Text] With warm congratulations to Eastern Army troops, 
Army General Raul Castro, minister of the Revolutionary Armed 
Forces [FAR], said farewell to the participants in the Eastern 
Army Special Military Council. 
  Raul presented an enlarged picture of Eastern Army Chief 
Ramon Espinosa Martin, in which both men are standing in front 
of a billboard reading: This command is top notch. Raul affirmed 
that this gift marks the 33rd anniversary of the creation of the 
Eastern Army, and described as masterful the demonstrations he 
attended. 
  The closing address by Division General Ulises Rosales del 
Toro, member of the Politburo and chief of the FAR General 
Staff, stressed that the council's accomplishments are part of a 
program which foresaw the current situation much earlier than 
other institutions. He pointed out that the key has been the 
implementation of a complete concept were every FAR Ministry 
member has specific responsibilities, from the minister to the 
soldier. 
  In its final phase, the council listened to addresses by the 
first secretaries of the Communist Party of Cuba [PCC] in 
Guantanamo, Santiago de Cuba, and Holguin Provinces, regarding 
the energy potential of these regions. The PCC officials 
stressed efforts and results of the work to increase, among 
other things, the use of bagasse and shaft, the construction of 
minidams and windmills, and conservation of traditional fuels. 
  Central Committee member Eugenio Mainegra gave a special 
address to the council on the status of the nationwide efforts 
to solve difficulties in alternative energy sources efforts. 
Earlier, the FAR minister's work group and the members of the 
military council visited the Limoncito hydraulic complex 
designed to irrigate plantain plantations by gravity. The 
project, with a capacity of 7.14 million cubic meters, supplies 
water to 33 plantain caballerias planted on planters in order to 
enrich the organic layers of the soil and improve drainage. 
Limoncito is a landmark for Holguin construction workers who in 
10 months in 1992 completed the main reservoir, a flow 
regulating facility, and over four kilometers of the channel. 
  The military visitors also inaugurated an experimental 
facility for processing agricultural residues such as sugarcane 
shaft which is shaped into compact briquettes. Once the facility 
reaches its top production capacity it will produce over 4,000 
metric tons of briquettes a year, which will replace 1,440 tons 
of oil or prevent having to cut down 174 hectares of forest. At 
his site, coal and phenolic acids are obtained simultaneously. 
These are used to produce heavy oils such as creosol, guaiacum, 
emollients, and solvents. 
  During a visit to a repair workshop, the two work groups 
observed procedures to make tires for light vehicles with 
methods developed in that workshop -- a vanguard unit of the FAR 
Civilian Workers Union. According to technical tests the final 
product's quality is superior to imports and lays a basis for 
the budding production of tires for heavy vehicles. 
  Great prowess has been demonstrated by the mini-industries 
of 
the General Staff of the Eastern Army, which have produced so 
far this year, 21 tons of food including candied preserves, 
tomato and other vegetables pastes, candy, and cassava. In the 
other 51 facilities of this type in the Eastern Army the 
production extends to detergents, lotions made from citrus 
extracts, liquid and bar soap, and shoe polish and dye. 
  Before the closing of the council, there was a praiseworthy 
cooking demonstration including 160 recipes for cooking fresh 
water fish grown in dozens of army units. The things seen in the 
extensive tour evidence how much is being done by the Eastern 
Army to overcome the effects of the special period and 
contribute to the FAR and to Cuba's development. 
  Raul was right when he affirmed in his farewell that it will 
be difficult to take away from the Eastern Army the title of 
best in the FAR.

  [Text] Ricardo Alarcon, president of the National Assembly 
of the People's Government [ANPP], has met with deputies from 
Cienfuegos to discuss aspects of the 1 May special session of 
the ANPP. In addition to the deputies, the members of the 
Administrative Councils, and the presidents of the municipal 
assemblies, permanent committees, and urban People's Councils, 
were also in attendance. The discussion was based on the 
document debated at the last plenum of the Cuban Workers 
Federation, which conduted a preliminary assessment of the 
workers assemblies process. The participants in the meeting 
expressed opinions based on experiences attained during this 
same process. 
  [Begin Alarcon recording] It has been a very broad debate 
nationwide. The deputies have participated in many meetings. 
Each one of us attended thousands of hours to discuss these same 
issues, specifically based on the reality of each region. [end 
recording] 
  These experiences are included in the proposals the ANPP 
will 
discuss in order to adopt measures aimed at streamlining the 
national finances. At the meeting, it was stressed how the 
workers assemblies, as a first effort to tackle economic 
efficiency at every workplace, have opened a path to face the 
current situation. 
  It is now our deputies' duty to focus on the second phase of 
this process having to do with the deteriorated Cuban financial 
situation. The 1 May special session of the ANPP ought to 
contribute to define opinions and lay down norms and guidelines 
to steer the economic policy of the Cuban state.

<F P=106> [Report by Marianela Samper from the "Evening Information </F>
Review" newscast] 
  [Text] The Havana City People's Provincial Court sentenced 
Rodolfo Gonzalez Gonzalez to seven years in prison for the 
offense of spreading enemy propaganda. Gonzalez, age 34, a 
member of the outlawed Cuban Human Rights Committee, admitted he 
cooperated with counterrevolutionary radio stations based in the 
United States. (Edelmira Pedriz) was the prosecutor of case No. 
49 of 1993 and now gives us details on the legal substantiation 
of the case. 
  [Begin recording] [Pedriz] The paragraphs of Article 103 of 
the Penal Code, through Paragraph 3, describe the offense of 
enemy propaganda. To be specific, the charge against Rodolfo 
Gonzalez is contained in Paragraph 2 of Article 103. It notes 
that a person who spreads false news or ill-intended predictions 
for the purpose of causing alarm or public unrest is liable to 
receive one to four years in prison. Paragraph 3 mentions a 
specific aggravating factor for this offense. It notes that if 
the mass media are used in carrying out the actions mentioned in 
the above paragraphs the prison term ranges from seven to 15 
years. What happened in this case? Everything that was said 
-- even the defendant said it during the hearing and the defense 
lawyer, who was tasked with representing the interests of 
Gonzalez in accordance with what our Constitution and law 
dictate, corroborated it.... [pauses] During the trial, the 
argument against the charge was that Rodolfo Gonzalez committed 
no offense because he did nothing but make use of his sacred 
right to express his ideas freely, the right of freedom of 
opinion, the freedom to express ideas and beliefs. The 
constitutionality of the charge was questioned during the trial 
to buttress this argument, although it is totally without legal 
or material justification. The argument was that in this case 
there was no dissemination of news but of ideas and that the 
Cuban state is violating not just what our Constitution but what 
the Universal Human Rights Declaration says. 
  [Samper] I [word indistinct] mention the case and that it 
was 
proved during the trial that Gonzalez used to contact U.S.-based 
radio stations to give false reports on disturbances and human 
rights violations in Cuba, things that never happened. In 
addition, it was also proved that everything was distorted. 
Would you like to explain briefly to us this aspect? 
  [Pedriz] This case involves a dissemination of neither ideas 
nor opinions because, according to the file, on a nearly daily 
basis between March and May 1992, Rodolfo Gonzalez had contacts, 
with the frequency I just noted, with Mr. (Alvaro de Insua), a 
journalist residing in Miami, through calls from the United 
States to a specific location in Cuba that could never be 
determined. [end recording] 
  According to the charges, citizen Rodolfo Gonzalez spread 
false information [accusaciones] on the country's situation and 
on actions by domestic law-and-order groups [cuerpos del orden 
interior] that violate citizens' rights to create unrest and to 
incite the population to carry out acts of civil disobedience 
against island authorities. 
  Other charges refuted by the Public Prosecutor's Office 
pertain to the health status of counterrevolutionaries Sebastian 
Arcos, who is currently in prison, and Maria Elena Cruz Varela, 
who is currently free. Pedriz commented on the international 
repercussions of the dissemination of this false information: 
  [Begin Pedriz recording] If you recall the trial, which 
received ample coverage, the accused insisted that all the news 
and all the information on alleged human rights violations in 
Cuba make their way to the headquarters of the Human Rights 
Commission in Geneva, and, of course, given the effect of this 
on our country's security abroad, the Socialist state is under 
attack. The integrity and the stability of the entire Cuban 
social order is being attacked with this activity that is 
adorned with a peaceful and humanitarian touch. This is not so, 
because it does not have a trace of humanitarianism. Actually, 
it was antipatriotic, and this was demonstrated at the trial. 
[end recording] 
  The trial, which was held on 29 March, complied with all 
guarantees specified in procedural rules that are currently in 
force in the country. In keeping with Article 59 of the 
Constitution of the Republic of Cuba, this trial involved a 
competent court by virtue of laws that were in force prior to 
the perpetration of the crime and conformed to the formalties it 
established. Lawyer (Juan Escandel Ramirez) defended the 
accused, Rodolfo Gonzalez Gonzalez. The defense may appeal, in 
keeping with Article 67, Paragraph 1, of the Penal Procedure 
Law, before the Havana City People's Provincial Court within 
five days of the ruling.

  [Text] Recently issued construction regulations for 
Havana's Malecon designate this area as a special restriction 
zone. According to the measures, from now on, no additions, new 
construction, offices on ground floors, or other businesses with 
complex equipment are to be built. The new codes will allow new 
projects in the zone, as well as construction, restoration, 
maintenance, and other activities in existing buildings, 
however, taking risk factors into consideration. The new codes 
are to be strictly adhered to by state and residential sectors, 
and are meant to lessen the effects of weather in the area. 
  During this first phase, the areas included run from the 
Almendares River to the bay tunnel; and from Malecon Avenue to 
Linea Street. 
  Regarding new construction in that area, projects must be 
approved and must meet urban planning and control requirements. 
In other words, the bottom levels of buildings must not have 
elements obstructing the free flow of water, in addition of 
preserving the environment and character of the Malecon. 
  With reference to the regulations affecting Playa and Habana 
del Este, work continues to determine what regulations are to be 
applied in those coastal municipalities.

  [Text] The deputies to the National Assembly of the 
People's Government [ANPP] from Ciego de Avila Province are 
ready for the special session of the ANPP to be held on 1 May. 
This was announced at the meeting chaired by ANPP Vice President 
Jaime Crombet at the seat of the provincial government. During 
the meeting, also attended by the presidents of the People's 
Councils, and the provincial Administration Council, it was 
reported that over 40 percent of the suggestions made at the 
workers assemblies have been implemented. The importance of this 
new democratic practice to solve countless problems with 
production and services as well as to help rejuvenate the 
national economy was also stressed. 
  Crombet pointed out that the idea is not for the ANPP to 
take 
specific measures during the forthcoming meeting, but to set the 
policies and guidelines to guide the government efforts to save 
the Revolution and accomplishments of socialism.

  [Text] During a recent visit to Granma Province, Carlos 
Lage Davila, member of the Politburo and secretary of the 
Council of Ministers, made important statements regarding the 
Nation and the Emigre Community conference, which begins on 22 
April in Havana. 
  [Begin Lage recording] It is important. We have always 
maintained a dialogue with sectors of the Cuban community abroad 
that maintain a position of respect toward the Revolution, 
acknowledge the Revolution, and condemn the blockade policy. I 
would say that this is what shapes our relations with certain 
sectors of the emigre community. 
  With those sectors of that community who support the goals 
of 
U.S. policy -- blockade and hostility toward the Revolution, 
there is not, nor can there be any type of ties. 
  In this context, this conference is important. There is the 
precedent of the previous meeting in 1978, if I remember well. 
That conference did not have a proper follow-up because the U.S. 
policy was progressively hardened and affected, and is still 
affecting normal ties between Cuba and the emigre community. 
Those ties are damaged because they are hampered by U.S. policy. 
We believe that this meeting will make progress in this regard 
and could represent an important step to strengthen 
communication and ties, and above all, policies and the struggle 
against the blockade. [end recording]

  [Text] Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina described his 
recent tour of South American countries as very positive. Upon 
his arrival he made exclusive statements for this newscast. His 
tour through Uruguay, Peru, Argentina, and Paraguay allowed him 
to make the reality of our country known to those countries and 
opened new channels of communication in Cuba's relations with 
other Latin American countries. 
  [Begin Robaina recording] I believe that being able to talk 
about Cuba's truth and being able to learn of the continent's 
reality represents a lot. For me there is no greater 
satisfaction than having been able to transmit, and sometimes I 
fear not having been able to do so with enough intent, the 
respect, authority, and love that is generated by the way that 
the Cuban people not only resist, but by the way they resist, 
live, work, walk, and triumph. [end recording] 
  Besides meeting with high-ranking officials, party leaders, 
and friends of Cuba, Robaina's visit awakened great interest 
among the business community of those countries. 
  [Begin Robaina recording, in progress] ...the large number 
of 
businessmen with whom I met, and the doubts that may arise from 
the debt were not the main issue in these business meetings. 
These doubts would arise from within determined structures of 
the government that wanted to make the issue of the debts the 
center of their negotiations, but the great majority of 
businessmen asked about the possibility of investments. They 
asked about judicial guarantees. They asked about 
constitutional, and financial guarantees and about the different 
line of goods. To all this, Cuba has much more than answers. I 
believe that this... [pauses] First of all, they know that Cuba 
is a market, that there are possibilities, and they know that it 
is a country that, like very few in the world, has an 
established infrastructure with an unprecedented level in 
education, science, and technology. [end recording] 
  Regarding "The Nation and the Emigre Community" conference 
which will begin on 22 April, in Havana city, Robaina stated: 
  [Begin Robaina recording] In the extent that the reality of 
that community abroad begins to express itself in a different 
way, and the reality of the nation begins to change, we take 
steps which are derived from a new situation. A new situation 
which I insist demonstrates the audacity of our project and of 
the country that summons the meeting because we continue having 
abnormal conditions as in the past. I believe that under 
abnormal conditions one cannot ask that relations with the 
emigre community be normal. 
  Once again Cuba is putting itself above all those abnormal 
situations and is capable of finding a solution and a topic for 
these times. I believe this is what brings us to this conference. 
  For me the most important thing remains the path that is 
being opened and the way in which in a responsible and civilized 
manner, and, above all, with much comprehension and mutual 
respect, we will be able to discuss common issues from this 
point on. [end recording]

  [Text] President Aristide is once again criticizing U.S. 
policy toward Haiti. The president-in-exile accused the United 
States of lacking political willingness to see the return of 
democracy to Haiti, and called their policy racist and a cynical 
joke. 
  Washington's policy of returning the Haitian refugees is a 
way of saying they could care less about them; they can die. So 
far, President Bill Clinton has shown no proof that he cares 
about them, asserted Father Aristide during a news conference on 
Thursday. 
  Aristide came to support the hunger strike of the director 
of 
the association, Transafrica, Rindall Robinson. Mr. Robinson has 
decided to pursue his hunger strike, begun on 12 April to 
protest the summary repatriations of Haitian refugees and the 
American policy in Haiti that he calls cruel, discriminatory, 
and deeply racist. 
  The United States, said Aristide, set up a sort of 
artificial 
embargo, but that is not what we are asking for. He reiterated 
the need for a total embargo. It should be recalled that 
President Clinton asserted on 20 April the willingness of the 
United States to pursue the trade embargo against Haiti in order 
to achieve the return of democracy to Haiti.

  [Text] Haitian President-in-exile Jean-Bertrand Aristide 
has warned the United States that he cannot prevent a flood of 
Haitian refugees from landing on U.S. coasts if democracy is not 
restored in his country. Furthermore, Father Aristide, who was 
speaking in front of the World Affairs Council [previous three 
words in English] in San Francisco on 18 April, reproached the 
Clinton government for giving the impression of withdrawing in 
the face of armed bands supported by the Haitian military. In 
the face of some hooligans, the most powerful country in the 
world cannot pretend that they are stronger than they, he 
asserted, pointing up until now he had urged his partisans to 
remain in Haiti to work for democracy instead of trying to reach 
the coasts of Florida. 
  Aristide pointed out that henceforth it would be cynical to 
maintain this recommendation in light of U.S. inaction. The 
Clinton administration said last week that it would continue to 
follow the democratic path while seeking a solution, but that it 
did not exclude other options. The day before, the president of 
the Appropriations Committee of the House of Representatives 
requested U.S. military intervention to put an end to the 
military regime in Haiti.

  [Excerpts] Senator [Bernard] Sansaricq has decided to 
implement -- with or without the support of the Chamber of 
Deputies -- the resolution voted on 10 April by the Alliance 
[for Parliamentary Cohesion] senators and the 18 January 
senators, demanding the implementation of Article 149 of the 
Constitution. The duty of a senator is to help his endangered 
homeland, says Sen. Sansaricq, who has set a deadline for the 
implementation of this resolution. 
  [Begin recording] [Sansaricq] "With or without the Chamber 
of 
Deputies, either we implement it or there will be a clean sweep 
[table rase]." Something must be done. The nation is in danger. 
The state is threatened to its very foundations. So, I cannot 
play with such a situation. I can allow a certain amount of 
time, set a deadline, but I think that after this deadline, all 
political leaders in the country -- I received many calls 
yesterday and today -- I think all truly lucid leaders in the 
country will support the Senate in what it wants to do because 
something must be done, regardless. [passage omitted] I have 
given myself a deadline. This means that if this deadline passes 
with nothing having been done, the Senate will provoke a crisis 
one way or another, come what may. 
  [Unidentified reporter] By the way, this resolution is quite 
constitutional, according to Bernard Sansaricq, who demands the 
support of the Armed Forces. Otherwise, threatens the president 
of the Senate's unofficial office, the Armed Forces have only to 
get ready to assume power because the military authorities will 
have no other choice, given the clean sweep policy. 
  [Sansaricq] We adopted a constitutional resolution. There is 
the principle of requisitioning the Army. "It is up to the Army 
to move along a constitutional path, or the Senate will withdraw 
after a certain time. We will collectively resign. Then, the 
Army will have to assume its responsibilities toward the nation. 
  [Reporter] "To hold new elections? 
  [Sansaricq] "Whatever they want to do." [end recording]

  [Excerpts] The news today, as it has been all week, is 
about a series of meetings held by the office of the Chamber of 
Deputies in an effort to solve the political deadlock. A second 
meeting is planned for today between the office of the Chamber 
of Deputies and the General Staff of the Haitian Armed Forces. 
The meeting will relate to the political crisis and current 
deadlock. On Tuesday, 19 April, the military authorities 
received a delegation of deputies to hear the various scenarios 
for a solution to the crisis. Within the scope of this 
initiative, the deputies met on 20 April with representatives of 
the Episcopal Conference and with the Vatican's ambassador to 
Port-au-Prince. Edner Jean filed a report: 
  [Begin Jean recording] As the consultations move forward, 
the 
solution to the crisis is moving farther and farther away from 
Article 149 of the Constitution, at least so far as the Chamber 
of Deputies is concerned. The last meeting with the Army only 
reinforced the position held by the majority of deputies and 
expressed a thousand times -- the inapplicability of Article 149 
of the Constitution at the current juncture. 
  If the military did not totally disregard that option, 
neither are they willing to support the legislators favoring 
such an approach. The Army would rather seek a concerted 
solution, confessed Deputy Pierre Simon Georges, president of 
the Alliance [for Parliamentary Cohesion], who participated in 
this meeting at Army Headquarters. The deputy from Camp-Perin 
who was the first, on 8 October 1991, to vote for Article 149, 
today believes that this constitutional provision has seen its 
day and that the Clean Sweep solution would be a breach of 
democracy. 
  Deputy Pierre Simon Georges, who never hid his affinity with 
the Army, invites the military to analyze the grave 
socioeconomic consequences that could lead to a total blockade 
of the country. [passage omitted] 
  From a generally reliable source, we have learned that the 
deputies are due to meet with the Army General Staff again on 
Thursday. Meanwhile, the president of the lower chamber is 
tirelessly pursuing his consultations. Objective: to collect the 
maximum amount of data before taking any new action to fill the 
governmental vacuum. 
  Frantz Robert Monde has the moral support of the Chamber of 
Deputies. However, some legislators regret the fact that the 
preliminary results of those meetings were covered in camera. 
[passage omitted]. It should be pointed out that this series of 
meetings is due to close with a phone conference with President 
Aristide in Washington. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] The former president of the lower chamber, 
Deputy Antoine Joseph, called on the Army and the private sector 
on 20 April to take a stand against the clean sweep policy and 
the implementation of Article 149. Deputy Joseph deems the 
demands of some political sectors that demand the return of 
President Aristide 10 days after the appointment of a new prime 
minister unrealistic. 
  [Begin Joseph recording, in Creole] Certain solutions that 
have been proposed are supported by some sectors. I can put 
myself in the shoes of the private sector. I very much doubt 
that the private sector would have an interest in supporting the 
implementation of Art. 149. This is also my private position. 
Personally, I think the country is not ready to face the 
political and financial consequences of the implementation of 
Art. 149. [passage omitted] [end recording] 
  Furthermore, Deputy Joseph reaffirmed his support for the 
initiative of the president of the Chamber of Deputies to begin 
consultations with the various sectors involved in the crisis.

  [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas, 21 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- 
Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for peace and reconciliation 
in Chiapas, said here today that in the coming days the Zapatist 
National Liberation Army [EZLN] will provide "a clear answer in 
favor of resuming the dialogue" for peace. "Something new will 
emerge very soon in favor of resuming the talks," with the armed 
group, given the responsibility of the EZLN leadership, the 
commissioner said at a news conference in this colonial city, 
located 1,200 km southeast of the Mexican capital. 
  Camacho said there is confidence that there will be a 
negotiated solution to the conflict that began on 1 January when 
the self-styled Zapatist army occupied four towns of Los Altos 
de Chiapas in the southeastern part of Mexico. He based his 
opinion on the fact that the EZLN has honored the cease-fire in 
the certainty that channels for dialogue are open and that the 
leadership of the armed group is aware that the Mexican 
Government has issued statements promoting the talks. 
  On 3 March, Camacho Solis and EZLN delegates concluded the 
first phase of negotiations aimed at achieving a negotiated 
solution to the Chiapas conflict. 
  The peace commissioner recalled the agreement signed in the 
past few days with the State Council of Indian and Peasant 
Organizations (CEOIC), giving space and time to the peace 
process. 
  He stressed the importance of the Tuesday meeting between 
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari at the official Los Pinos 
residence with leaders of southern Chiapas cattlemen's 
organizations and small landowners. They discussed the problem 
of land invasions. 
  Camacho said the Mexican Army's decision to maintain the 
cease-fire is in recognition and support of the peace process, 
as is the commitment of the Mexican Episcopal Conference in 
favor of resuming the talks. 
  He said statements by all the presidential candidates in 
favor of peace will help to establish greater guarantees for 
short-term fulfillment of the government's commitments 
established at the negotiating table in San Cristobal de las 
Casas. 
  Ernesto Zedillo, presidential candidate for the ruling 
Institutional Revolutionary Party, toured this colonial city 
today. 
  Camacho said it is important that the presidential hopefuls 
commit themselves publicly to strengthening the peace process in 
Chiapas.

<F P=106> [Report by special correspondent Juan Carlos Santoyo from </F>
San Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas] 
  [Text] [Announcer Jose Cardenas] We will soon contact Juan 
Carlos Santoyo, our special envoy in San Cristobal de las Casas, 
Chiapas State, where Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis 
arrived today after attending a meeting yesterday at Los Pinos 
Presidential Residence, where President Carlos Salinas de 
Gortari met with cattle ranchers and small Chiapas landowners to 
discuss land seizures. 
  Yesterday, the president was very clear when he called on 
all 
participants in the conflict to sit down and negotiate by Monday 
at the latest and agree on a solution to all problems and 
conflicts that could worsen the already tense situation in 
Chiapas State. 
  Nevertheless, aside from the negotiations which will take 
place on Monday and which have caught the attention of the 
entire country, something else occurred today that has caused a 
great stir. Francisco Martin Moreno, a journalist and the author 
of "Mexico Negro" and "La Disculpa," today published on 
EXCELSIOR's frontpage an article entitled: "The Reason I 
Resigned: The Rules of the Political Game." In this article in 
today's edition of EXCELSIOR, Francisco Martin Moreno, without 
mentioning any names -- this must be made clear -- and always 
writing in the first person, as if it were a letter, says: It 
has been said that the commissioner for peace and reconciliation 
in Chiapas State has decided to resign from his post for the 
following reasons: 
  1. His peace efforts have been considered a factor of 
political distortion, which affected the candidacy of Luis 
Donaldo Colosio and could do the same to the candidacy of 
Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon. 
  2. It also has been said, according to Francisco Martin 
Moreno's article, that he garnered more headlines than the PRI's 
[Institutional Revolutionary Party] very own presidential 
campaign, thereby hurting his party and Mexico. The author 
continues by explaining that if this was indeed the case, it was 
because events in Chiapas State monopolized the attention of all 
Mexicans. 
  3. Nearly a month after he was considered a political 
cadaver, he is still said to harbor ulterior motives in his 
dialogue with the EZLN [Zapatist National Liberation Army]. In 
this connection, Martin Moreno explains in his article, which is 
fiction [de ficcion], that it has been perversely said that the 
peace commissioner resisted resigning in the hope that an 
electoral triumph by the PRD [Party of the Democratic 
Revolution] on 21 August would create the possibility of a 
provisional presidency that would require special elections in 
which the winner could be the peace commissioner. Martin Moreno 
says that for this reason, the resignation was needed to 
demonstrate that the peace commissioner in Chiapas was not 
attempting to take advantage of a post-elections conflict. 
  The peace commissioner supposedly said, according to 
Francisco Martin Moreno in this fictitous article, that on two 
occasions he lost his candidacy for presidency by playing by the 
rules of the game of Mexican politics, even though he cannot 
stop asking himself why it was not him instead of Colosio in the 
first place, and later, instead of Zedillo. For all of the 
above reasons, says Francisco Martin Moreno's article in 
EXCELSIOR, the peace commissioner reflected and arrived at the 
conclusion of presenting his alleged resignation to avoid that 
his name destabilize and encourage uncertainty within the PRI. 
  This is the end of a brief summary of the article that 
appears today on EXCELSIOR's frontpage, which, as we said at the 
beginning, Manuel Camacho Solis' name is never mentioned, even 
though it is perfectly clear that it is a hypothetical 
resignation, which Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for peace 
and reconciliation in Chiapas State, should present. 
  This article is by Franciso Martin Moreno, who, you will 
recall was among other things our consul in Barcelona. 
Francisco Martin Moreno was a Finance and Public Credit 
Secretariat official, until one day he decided to leave 
everything for peace and do what he likes best -- to write and 
investigate. He became a full-time investigator. This yielded, 
among other important works, his book called "Mexico Negro," 
where he tells all about the black history of Mexico's oil, and 
everything that Lazaro Cardenas' had to do with oil 
expropriations and the oppressive actions of the so-called Seven 
Sisters -- those companies that exerted pressure on the Mexican 
Government from all sides -- both politically and economically. 
"Mexico Negro" is a splendid book and a splendid bit of 
investigative work carried out by Francisco Martin Moreno -- a 
man who was a bureaucrat and became an intellectual. 
  Now, Francisco, a man I hold in high esteeem and respect 
because he is my friend, published in the EXCELSIOR newspaper 
this alleged resignation by Manuel Camacho, and all hell has 
broken loose. 
  Juan Carlos, how are you? 
  [Santoyo] Good afternoon. You are right, an uproar has 
been created, and naturally there is reaction. Of course, 
Camacho Solis has reacted. He is here in San Cristobal de las 
Casas, and today he met privately with San Cristobal Bishop 
Samuel Ruiz. Since the start, the question was: What about the 
letter? Was it his? In the beginning, he did not want to say 
anything. Later, he said he did indeed have something to say, 
and this is what he said: 
  [Begin Camacho recording] Someone told me about an article 
that outlined my reasons for resigning. This person then asked 
me: Are you resigning from the commission? The article, 
however, was not signed by me, but by Francisco Martin Moreno, a 
friend of mine. We are dealing with an editorial written by 
someone else -- someone who, by the way, writes very well and is 
an intelligent man. 
  I will comment on the article, because it may represent the 
opinion of not only Francisco, but also of someone else. It is 
very worrisome to me that at this stage there are still people 
who are unaware of what is going on in the state of Chiapas. 
The negotiation process in the state of Chiapas is being taken 
lightly. [end recording] 
  [Santoyo] Camacho also said: The situation in Chiapas has 
not 
yet been settled. The deep-rooted causes of the problem are 
still there. We are still not in a position to determine terms 
for resuming the talks. Camacho, smiling and at ease, also 
said: Casting doubts on the dialogue process would be 
politically irresponsible. 
  [Begin Camacho recording] The problem has not been resolved. 
The deep-rooted causes of the problem are still there. We 
cannot even determine terms for resuming the talks. Casting 
doubts on the dialogue process would constitute political 
irresponsibility, which, fortunately, is not shared by any of 
the country's political forces -- all of which have backed the 
negotiations. This position also is not shared by Dr. Zedillo, 
who summed up this subject and offered full support for the 
negotiations process. Neither is this position shared by the 
Catholic Church, which supports the efforts to resume the talks, 
or intellectuals, or members of civilian society. Francisco's 
opinion must be respected, as must every writer's opinion, but I 
am concerned about such a cursory analysis of what is going in 
Chiapas. [end recording] 
  [Santoyo] Camacho continued: First of all, let us see how 
the 
talks will be resumed. If we succeed in resuming the talks, 
that would be good news for the entire country. Moreover, I 
think this is the time to figure out what is truly important in 
Mexico. Camacho said there are two basic concepts in Mexico: 
first, to promote peace and uphold public opinion; and second, 
to continue to nurture democracy. These two things go hand in 
hand. I will continue to work on these things from my humble 
home in San Cristobal de las Casas, Camacho concluded.

<F P=106> [Report by special correspondent Juan Carlos Santoyo from </F>
San Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas] 
  [Text] [Announcer Jose Cardenas] Special correspondent 
Santoyo will now report on the reactions in Chiapas to a 
bulletin released this morning by the National Defense 
Secretariat [Sedena] asserting that no member of the Mexican 
Army is guilty of violating human rights in the Chiapas 
conflict. Sedena says none of the 127 human rights violations 
reports is valid. Come in, Juan Carlos. 
  [Santoyo] Although this bulletin is being treated with a 
certain amount of reservation here in Chiapas, some communities 
have reacted by saying these reports should be looked at more 
closely. Some people are not happy about the bulletin, 
particularly those who are being held at the Cerro Hueco Prison 
who seriously question this statement by the Sedena. They say 
it is the authorities who have the final word. 
  The problems in Chiapas are increasing. Six days ago, on 21 
April, to be exact, 380 people from the group known as the Three 
Knots returned to Ochuc. These people, who have been described 
as rural teachers disguised as peasants, were expelled from 
Ochuc because they were considered dangerous and destabilizing. 
  A very serious incident occurred today. Two minors, one an 
eight year old and the other a 14 year old, were burned alive 
when their wooden shack was drenched with gasoline and set on 
fire. This is thought to be a revenge attack by some of those 
who had been expelled from Ochuc. The incident, which occurred 
in the village of Tobija some 14 km from Ochuc, is being 
investigated. Four people have been detained. Ochuc municipal 
President Emilio Gomez Santis traveled to Tuxtla Gutierrez to 
meet with the governor, Javier Lopez Moreno, so the proper 
actions could be taken. 
  We in the media are concerned because arriving at Ochuc is 
very difficult. One man, who declined to identify himself and 
just said he was a local authority, gave us a very serious 
warning. After giving us some information, he said: The people 
are very upset. You might as well leave. You are still alive. 
If you came in a car, drive away because it could be destroyed. 
We cannot be held responsible for your lives. 
  Of course, after this warning, we put some distance between 
ourselves and this town. These people are very upset, 
particularly because they are being forced to accept people they 
had expelled for political reasons. Some of the teachers, 
identified as members of the Democratic Revolution Party, have 
caused some problems in the municipality because most of the 
people here belong to or are followers of PRI [Institutional 
Revolutionary Party]. The number of dead will increase if what 
is happening there is not stopped. 
  The last that I will tell you is that Jorge Gonzalez Torres, 
candidate for the Ecologist Party, is scheduled to arrive in San 
Cristobal de las Casas tonight. He will make a working tour in 
some local communities, and on Friday he will take water trucks 
to local Indian communities. In addition, National Action Party 
candidate Diego Fernandez Cevallos will make a tour from Friday 
to Monday. His public relations committee has gotten in touch 
with us in the media. It has been reported that we can use the 
press room set up by the federal government.

<F P=106> [From the "Early Morning" newscast] </F>
  [Text] President Carlos Salinas de Gortari held a meeting 
late Tuesday night with representatives of the three Chiapas 
cattlemen's organizations. The ranchers said the president 
pledged to restore order in the state and to prevent more land 
invasions. They will see solutions within a week, the president 
said. The cattlemen said they would not take up weapons as a 
group but added that they are willing to defend their lands. 
  [Begin recording] [Jorge Constantino Kanter, president of 
the 
Regional Cattlemen's Union of Chiapas] The cattlemen of the 
state of Chiapas support dialogue and negotiation in favor of a 
worthy peace in Chiapas. Peace, along with a state of law, will 
be our best guarantee. That is what we basically told the 
president. We are willing to hold a dialogue with the governor, 
the peasant organizations, and the EZLN [Zapatist National 
Liberation Army] itself in an effort to find practical solutions 
to the current conflicts. A worthy peace will provide us the 
necessary tranquillity to contribute to coexistence among the 
people of Chiapas, to resume our productive activities, and 
promote the region's economy. That will be the basis of the new 
relations among the people of Chiapas. 
  President Salinas' commitment is to find solutions through 
the agrarian reform secretary within a week. He will hold talks 
with the governor to provide realistic solutions for the 
problems we are experiencing in Chiapas. 
  We have been very clear. We are not prepared to take up 
weapons, but there are people in the area who are willing to 
defend their land -- no matter what -- because of the difficult 
situation. This does not mean we are taking up weapons as a 
group. It would be too complicated for the state and for the 
country. If we are going to sit down and talk to peasant 
organizations is because we are going to reach an agreement. If 
it is a negotiation both sides have to give things up. It is 
that simple. We have said that we want to be treated fairly as 
Mexicans. 
  [Unidentified reporter] What did the president ask of you? 
Did he urge you to be prudent? 
  [Constantino] He did not do that because we have been 
prudent. He recognized the tranquillity and peacefulness of the 
cattlemen. I repeat, the situation of the cattlemen is Chiapas 
is very different from any other land invasion in the republic. 
On Monday at 1930 we are going to sit down in the government 
palace for a meeting between small landowners, the state 
governor, and peasant organizations. 
  [Reporter] When can a meeting be held with the EZLN? 
  [Constantino] We do not know. It would be through the peace 
commissioner. 
  [Reporter] Was he there? 
  [Constantino] Yes, he was there. 
  [Reporter] [words indistinct] 
  [Constantino] The state governor has done everything 
possible 
to solve things, but it is a very difficult, critical situation. 
We cannot ask for a quick solution to such a serious problem. 
We believe that if we are going to sit down to talk, we have to 
negotiate as intelligent people. If we do that I believe there 
is no need to take up weapons. We do not want to create 
problems, let alone create more problems for the country. 
  [Reporter] Are you willing to wait? 
  [Constantino] If we came here it is because we are 
desperate. 
We are supposedly going to sit down to talk and hold a dialogue. 
We have said that we believe in the country's institutions. We 
trust the president. If we did not trust the president, we 
would not be here. 
  [Reporter] [words indistinct] 
  [Constantino] There is an agreement. The governor was clear. 
Starting on 14 April there would be no more invasions, otherwise 
the authorities are going to start evicting people. I believe 
the government will help us out. We believe they will take 
action. [end recording]

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on developments related to El Salvador presidential 
run-off elections scheduled for 24 April 1994. 
  Armando Calderon Sol, Nationalist Republican Alliance, 
ARENA, 
candidate for president, said on 16 April that, if he comes out 
the winner in the elections, he will combat government 
corruption even more strongly than Alfredo Cristiani's 
administration. (San Salvador Canal Doce Television in Spanish 
0300 GMT 16 Apr 94) 
  Reacting to Ruben Zamora, candidate for president for a 
coalition of three leftist parties who said Calderon Sol's 
eventual election victory would be "very dangerous," the ARENA 
candidate on 19 April asserted that he will comply with the 
pending peace agreements because they "are a national commitment 
and must be complied with to consolidate a true state of law."

<F P=106> ["Emergency Decree" issued by President Carlos Roberto Reina </F>
during a Council of Ministers meeting in Tegucigalpa on 21 
April; read by reporter Lourdes Bonilla at the Presidential 
House -- live relay] 
  [Text] Whereas, the expansion of electrification programs 
carried out in the last few years throughout the country has 
resulted in a substantial increase in demands for energy by 
users in the productive sector and by individuals, 
  Whereas, the power-generating capacity of hydroelectric 
plants and complexes, as well as that of state-owned thermal 
centers, has been seriously reduced by today's energy demands, 
  Whereas, the power-generating capacity has been affected by 
rainy seasons characterized by little rain, as a result of which 
water levels required by dams to secure the energy supply have 
not been maintained, 
  Whereas, the Valle de Sula region in particular has 
witnessed 
accelerated growth in the use of energy because of the demand 
required for the installation of assembly processing plants and 
industrial plants, 
  Whereas, it is evident that during the previous 
administration no timely measures were adopted to try to resolve 
the looming energy crisis, 
  Whereas, the deficit in energy production in the face of 
high 
demand forces the state to consider the need to incorporate the 
private sector into the sector for power generation and 
distribution of energy, thus allowing the National Enterprise 
for Electric Power [ENEE] to devote greater efforts and 
resources to the search for other sources for generating 
electric power, 
  Whereas, the state, through ENEE, is forced to guarantee the 
energy supply in an efficient and timely manner, so as to 
preserve the nation's energy security to guarantee the 
development of the national economy and national social 
interests, 
  Whereas, until Congress approves the Energy Sector Draft 
Bill, which is now before the Congress awaiting discussion, 
debate, and passage, it is necessary to adopt urgent measures to 
meet energy demands in a way that will provide maximum benefit 
to users and the country in general, 
  Whereas, since 28 March of this year the president of the 
Republic, in light of the emergency confronting energy supplies, 
created an executive branch commission to study the causes and 
effects of said crisis in order to adopt the most appropriate 
measures for resolving the same, 
  Whereas, according to Article 245 of the Constitution, it is 
the responsibility of the president of the Republic to 
administer the state and as he has the specific power to decree 
special measures regarding economic and financial matters, as 
required by the national interests and provided he notifies the 
national Congress, 
  The Presidency of the Republic -- in exercising the powers 
granted it by Articles 24, Paragraph 1 and Points 11, 20, 35,

160, Paragraph 1 of the Law of Contracting by the State -- 
resolves: 
  Article 1: To authorize ENEE to proceed, considering the 
existing critical circumstances, through simultaneous bidding or 
direct contracting, to obtain the required energy from national 
and/or international sources. This will permit the country to 
secure the appropriate continuity and effectiveness of the 
energy sector to the benefit of different national sectors. 
  Article 2: To create the Energy Sector Emergency Commission 
to advise, support, and aid ENEE in examining and handling the 
crisis, as well as in making whatever decisions are necessary to 
deal with the crisis in an effective, concrete, and appropriate 
manner. This commission will be formed by an Executive 
Committee and a group of advisers, as follows: 
  The Executive Committee will consist of the following: 
  1. The secretary of Communications, Public Works, and 
Transportation (SECOPT) or a person appointed by him to preside

  [Text] Tegucigalpa, 20 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- The United States 
will support Honduras in its aspirations to join the UN Security 
Council, the Foreign Relations Ministry reported today. 
  In a communique, the Honduran Foreign Ministry announced 
U.S. 
Ambassador to Tegucigalpa William Pryce expressed Washington's 
support for Honduras. The United States "has the pleasure to 
support Honduras' candidacy and hopes to work with its 
representative at the Security Council that will be installed in 
1995," the U.S. envoy said, according to the text of the 
communique. Pryce remarked it will be "a pleasure and honor to 
give them our support," while Honduran Foreign Minister Ernesto 
Paz Aguilar explained that the White House decision is valued 
"highly," according to the document. 
  U.S. support of this nation's hopes to become a nonpermanent 
member of the Security Council "represents a good piece of news, 
a specific demonstration of the excellent relations between 
Honduras and the United States," Paz Aguilar emphasized. 
  Honduras has become the sole candidate of the group of 
nations from Latin America and the Caribbean for the election 
that will take place during the 49th session of the UN General 
Assembly, scheduled for next autumn. 
  The UN Security Council has five permanent members -- China, 
the United States, France, Great Britain, and Russia -- and 10 
nonpermanent members, whose membership changes every two years.

<F P=106> [By Alfonso Malespin Jiron] </F>
  [Text] In a news conference to announce that the government 
has already signed the letter of intent for the ESAF [Enhanced 
Structural Adjustment Facility] with the IMF, Presidency 
Minister Antonio Lacayo explained that fuel prices and 
electricity and water rates will increase continuously as the 
cordoba slides against the dollar. 
  Diesel will increase 46 centavos between April and December, 
at the rate of seven centavos a month; gasoline will increase 14 
centavos each month; the minimum rate for electricity 
consumption will increase from 51 to 55 cordobas; and the 
minimum water consumption rate will increase from 16 to 17.07 
cordobas. 
  In addition, the ESAF -- which will guarantee $660 million 
in 
funds and the renegotiation of the $11.638 billion foreign debt 
-- will not help the current agricultural season, because the 
funds will not begin arriving in the country until July. 
  The coffee and cattle sectors and the FISE [Emergency Fund 
For Social Investments] and PAMIC [National Program to Support 
Microenterprises] projects will benefit from funds from the 
Inter-American Development Bank, IDB, and the BCIE [Central 
American Bank of Economic Integration]. 
  According to Lacayo, with the ESAF, the government is 
"righting the wrongs" it inherited from former President Ortega 
and recovering "the sovereignty lost" by contracting a debt 
which he estimated at $12 billion. 
  The members of the economic cabinet were especially harsh in 
their references to the Sandinist Front, which they accused of 
"mortgaging" and "harming the sovereignty" of the country during 
the past decade. According to them, it is not until now that 
the economic policy is being handled responsibly. It was 
announced that "the government is not going to pay the military 
debt [deuda belica]" left by the past administration. According 
to Foreign Minister Erwin Kruger, Nicaragua owes $3 billion to 
the former Soviet Union. Russia demands the payment of at least 
$500 million, but the Violeta Chamorro government is willing to 
renegotiate only $150 million. 
  According to Finance Minister Emilio Pereira, the ESAF "will 
open opportunities for everyone, specially the poorest people," 
because it will reduce public expenses by 250 million cordobas 
and strengthen the social protection umbrella. Minister Lacayo 
stressed the ESAF does not represent new "rough times" for the 
country, but an opportunity to pay less to the Paris Club; 
greater financing for agricultural production; and more schools 
and health centers. "This is a fundamental phase to place the 
house in order; it is directed at resolving debt problems," 
Finance Minister Emilio Pereira said. "The new phase is one of 
opportunities and of an economy for progress." Minister Lacayo 
said that even though the ESAF will mean that the country will 
have "the opportunity to grow in a sustained and equitable 
manner," the government is ready to face any protest by the 
people. 
  In a positive tone, Minister Lacayo said that through the 
ESAF, three jobs will be created for each one of the 13,500 jobs 
that will be eliminated in the state sector in the next three 
years, adding 84,675 jobs. [figures as published]

<F P=106> [Report by Henry Vargas and Irma Franco] </F>
  [Text] Ocotal, Nueva Segovia -- In an attempt at rebellion, 
150 former members of the 3-80 Northern Front blocked the 
entrances to the city of Quilali for one hour. They said it was 
a peaceful seizure to protest the government's noncompliance 
with an agreement to distribute land before the beginning of the 
current agricultural season. The seizure occurred at 1100 on 20 
April, and they decided to withdraw from the city when they 
found no support from the local population. 
  The former fighters said their main demand is the 
distribution of land, as stipulated in the demobilization 
agreement recently signed by the government of Violeta Barrios 
de Chamorro and El Chacal [Jose Angel Talavera], their leader. 
During the brief seizure of the city, they also demanded bank 
financing for the planting of basic grains, as the government 
had promised. 
  According to a military report, this seizure had no 
significance because it did not have the people's support. The 
townspeople say they have faith in the agreements signed with 
the government, indicating that peace and harmony with the 
former fighters and good harvests in the coming agricultural 
season depend on the fulfillment of the agreements. 
<H5>  "Esteban" Explains Situation </H5>
  Salvador Talavera, alias "Esteban," confirmed that a group 
of 
sympathizers and members of the 3-80 Northern Front, who had 
demobilized in 1990, gathered at midday yesterday near Quilali's 
park to demand that the government fulfill the agreements signed 
four years ago. "Esteban" added that this group of demobilized 
individuals wanted to take advantage of the dialogue that is 
currently taking place between the government and the 3-80 
Northern Front General Command to publicize their demands. 
However, at their first attempt at gathering, the police and 
former 3-80 Northern Front Commanders "Pajarillo" [not further 
identified] and "Cascabel" [Jose Santos Sanchez] arrived. The 
two former commanders are currently in charge of the 
demobilization in Quilali. 
  "Esteban" reiterated that the group gathered spontaneously 
and on their own, without any authorization. He said that the 
CIAV [International Commission of Support and Verification]-OAS 
was the first organization to learn about the action and that it 
immediately reported it to the Government Ministry. 
  Salvador Talavera, El Chacal's brother, said "the alleged 
seizure only exists in the complete disinformation irresponsibly 
released by certain media."

<F P=106> [Letter from Daniel Ortega, secretary general of the </F>
Sandinist National Liberation Front, to militants, members, and 
supporters of the FSLN, and the people of Nicaragua, issued in 
Managua on 15 April] 
  [Text] Brothers: 
  I am addressing you five weeks before the start of the 
"Augusto C. Sandino, for the Sake of Sandinist Unity" special 
Congress of the Sandinist National Liberation Front [FSLN]. 
  On 19 July 1993, at a ceremony to mark the 14th anniversary 
of the triumph of the revolution, I made public an initiative to 
hold this special congress to consolidate and strengthen 
Sandinist unity, to ensure we are better prepared to support 
popular struggles, and to prepare ourselves to win the 1996 
nationwide elections. Those who were at Revolution Square 
supported it and the Sandinist Assembly approved it later. 
  These days there are discussions on the basic documents 
dealing with crucial issues of our program and our statutes that 
have in turn enriched them, with proposals and resolutions 
presented at territorial and sectorial assemblies. 
  The debate is deepening and opening itself up to others to 
the extent that we fully welcome the FSLN and FSLN members, 
those who committed themselves to fight -- once and a thousand 
times -- against the Somozist dictatorship and to defend the 
revolution, and those who -- at one time or another -- have felt 
isolated, relegated, neglected, and even attacked. We want them 
to join the process of discussions at the Congress to turn the 
FSLN into a more participative political organization with a 
renewed commitment to the ideals of Augusto Sandino, Rigoberto 
Lopez, and Carlos Fonseca, by participating in the struggle to 
defend a national, democratic, and popular program for all 
Nicaraguans. 
  Sandinist brothers, Nicaraguan brothers: 
  These lines were written amid a debate that has at times 
turned vehement and passionate. The debate is there, it is in 
full force and is charged by politics and ideology. It should 
produce ideas that will enrich and strengthen Sandinist thought, 
actions, and unity. 
  Some of us Sandinists have had the privilege of experiencing 
three great periods of Nicaraguan history. In the 1960's and 
1970's we were part of a guerrilla movement whose strength was 
based on our zeal and devotion, and our willingness to sacrifice 
even our lives. We were in the government beginning on 19 July 
1979, that is, in power and facing another assault by Yankee 
expansionism and imperialism, which financed and organized the 
war against Nicaragua. 
<H5>  Renew and Modernize the FSLN </H5>
  On 25 February 1990, before Nicaragua and the world, we gave 
the best example of personal selflessness and democratic 
exercise when we admitted defeat in the elections and handed 
over the government. We reaffirmed our respect for the popular 
vote. Today we are a political revolutionary front that must 
adapt to new conditions. We must promote change in favor of the 
people in order to successfully wage popular struggles -- and in 
due time -- win the nationwide elections of November 1996. 
  Amid these circumstances, we must renew and modernize the 
FSLN and deepen democracy within Sandinism by promoting changes 
that will allow us to make contributions -- amid the new 
situation -- to the freedom struggles of the people who are 
rebelling against sustained growth policies, sustained 
consumption, and sustained exploitation that industrialized 
capitalism or "wild capitalism" is imposing on the world today 
through its neo-liberal philosophy. 
  As we cling to our roots, culture, history, and principles, 
we have the obligation to promote an alternative program that 
will meet the hopes of the Nicaraguan people who are poorer and 
more debased than ever today. We must find a project for all 
Nicaraguans who realize that in order to guarantee stability we 
must ensure the well-being of a great majority of citizens who 
are roaming the countryside and cities, because they are 
unemployed, hungry, and desperate. 
  All this will demand clear definitions of our stand toward 
the policies of the current Nicaraguan Government. We want to 
consolidate positions and overcome contradictions and confusions 
that a lack of definition has provoked among the ranks of the 
FSLN and the Nicaraguan people. 
  Article 4 of the Constitution's chapter on fundamental 
principles states: "The Nicaraguan people have created a new 
state to advance their interests and guarantee their social and 
political accomplishments. The state is the people's most 
effective instrument for eliminating all forms of human 
domination and exploitation, giving impetus to the nation's 
material and spiritual progress, and making sure that the 
interests and rights of the majority will prevail." 
  Four years into the present government, this principle has 
systematically and grievously been negated. The social and 
financial adjustments have become the government's main 
instrument for denying the people this constitutional principle. 
The defective judicial system accompanies the policy of 
dispossessing thousands of Nicaraguan families. Unemployment, 
poverty, and crime rates get higher and higher in an upward 
spiral that gradually negates the people's most fundamental 
rights. 
  For this reason, the Sandinist Front must wage a firm and 
active opposition struggle against those governmental policies 
that undermine the people and negate the Nicaraguan 
Constitution's fundamental principles. 
  In this struggle of the Sandinist Front with the people, we 
must respect the methods of struggle adopted by the unemployed, 
those who suffer hunger, those who feel grieved by government 
policies. This civic and popular struggle, which is determined 
by the affected sectors, must be backed by the Sandinists, in 
the street, the National Assembly, and in a dialogue with the 
government. 
  It is clear that it is necessary to access the government to 
gain a better position in the defense of the people's interests. 
It is also true, however, that the vote of the Nicaraguan 
people is the only way that we Sandinists can gain access to the 
government. For this reason, we also have to strengthen the 
people's awareness and win the 1996 elections with the citizens' 
conscientious vote for a broad democratic, popular, and national 
program, which guarantees the right for property in all its 
forms for all Nicaraguans, a program that proposes alternative 
economic policies vis a vis neo-liberalism. 
  Sandinist brothers, Nicaraguan brothers: To fight with the 
people and win the elections, we need a revolutionary party 
renovated in its members' commitment, with the power of Carlos 
Fonseca and the heroes and martyrs who gave their lives in and 
for the Sandinist Front, whose duty it is to stand firm and 
raise aloft the banners of the people and the national dignity 
against the onslaughts of neo-liberalism and neo-imperialism. 
  Sandinist brothers, Nicaraguan brothers: In this process of 
Special Congress debates, we must protect Sandinism's unity, 
which reaches beyond legitimate personal interests, views, and 
opinions. Just as we maturely experienced the baptism of fire of 
a institutional democratic system four years ago, at present we 
have the moral duty of participating in the democratic exercise 
as members of the great Sandinist family. 
  The debate is open. Ideas flow powerfully. To the extent 
that we can listen to one another, refrain from taking positions 
of force, and take a consensus essential to reinforcing unity, 
the Sandinists will become stronger and the people will attain 
more victories. 
  Sandinist brothers: It is your decision. You are the 
Congress. 
  For the Sandinist unity, everyone to the Augusto C. Sandino 
congress. 
  [Issued] Managua, 15 April 1994. 
  [Signed] The FSLN secretary general.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on developments related to the Panamanian elections 
scheduled for 8 May 1994. 
  Ruben Blades, presidential candidate of the Papa Egoro 
Movement, has said Panamanian President Guillermo Endara muddied 
his hands in partisan politics by presenting a documentary video 
on previous regimes in a national television network. (Panama 
City LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA in Spanish 17 Apr 94 p A1) 
  Mireya Moscoso de Gruber, presidential candidate for the 
Arnulfist Party (PA), warned on 17 April that she will not give 
up her candidacy and support Ruben Dario Carles, "who is falling 
behind in the polls." Meanwhile, Alfredo Ramirez, president of 
the Nationalist Liberal Republican Movement (Molirena), insists 
that Carles is the only candidate who can defeat the Democratic 
Revolutionary Party (PRD). (Panama City EL PANAMA AMERICA in 
Spanish 18 Apr 94 p 1) 
  The various presidential candidates toured rural areas over 
the weekend of 16 April. 
  Ruben Blades visited various towns in Veraguas Province, 
where he met with supporters, discussed their problems, and 
offered solutions. "We have not sought an alliance with any 
political party, because we know we have an alliance with all of 
Panamanian society, with the Panamanian people," Blades 
emphasized in his visit. 
  Meanwhile, Ernesto Perez Balladares, presidential candidate 
for the PRD and the United People alliance, said he was "looking 
to the future and not to the past." Perez Balladares toured 
various towns in Chiriqui Province and met fellow party members 
and supporters, to whom he stressed that people in rural areas 
have been forgotten by the current administration. 
  Samuel Lewis Galindo, presidential candidate for the 
Solidarity Party and the Alliance for National Consensus, 
visited Los Santos Province, where he called for the unity among 
all Panamanians. Lewis Galindo urged the Panamanian people to 
avoid all forms of social confrontation. 
  Ruben Dario Carles, presidential candidate for the Change 
'94 
ticket, visited Puerto Armuelles, Chiriqui Province, where he 
"promised to respect the rights of the Indians and workers." 
Carles charged that the PRD has tried to eliminate the workers' 
13th month bonus, and he added that the PRD leadership should be 
imprisoned on various charges of corruption. 
  The PA presidential ticket toured Chiriqui and Bocas del 
Toro 
Provinces, where thousands of supporters greeted Mireya Moscoso 
de Gruber. She reiterated the PA will defeat the PRD on 8 May. 
  When PRD candidate Perez Balladares was asked about other 
groups forming an alliance against him, he answered: "They are 
trying to repeat what happened in 1989, as if they were trying 
to work against Noriega. I reiterate that we will not return to 
the past. We will not return to militarism." (Panama City 
Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 18 Apr 94) 
  Perez Balladares has visited the industrial area of Betania 
corregimiento, Panama City, where he promised "private 
enterprise will generate most of the jobs" during his 
administration. He emphasized, "The government cannot generate 
the number of jobs needed by the economy." 
  On 18 April, Moscoso de Gruber said it is necessary to set 
aside all special interests to achieve a broad alliance. She 
reaffirmed her plans to form such an alliance to confront the 
PRD. (Panama City Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 
19 Apr 94)

  [Excerpts] Buenos Aires, 20 Apr (NA) -- Despite strong 
opposition, the fishing treaty with the EEC was ratified this 
evening in the Chamber of Deputies. According to the ruling 
party, the fishing agreement will be instrumental in boosting 
our country's export revenues by $121 million. 
  This and other arguments brandished from the floor by Deputy 
Florencio Acenolaza (PJ) [Justicialist deputy for Tucuman 
Province] were vigorously refuted by speakers representing the 
other blocs, during a heated debate that went beyond the 
framework of the said agreement. 
  The blocs opposing the ratification of the agreement 
insisted 
that it be returned to the committee for further study, but the 
ruling majority managed to defeat this motion. 
  The treaty, which was signed in 1992, was ratified with the 
opposition of the Radical Civic Union, the Socialist Party, the 
Grand Front, the Movement for Independence and Dignity, and the 
Democratic Progressive Party. Justicialist Deputy Rafael Flores 
said that "this agreement is not a panacea for the fishing 
industry, and its benefits will depend on the controls we manage 
to implement." [passage omitted] 
  The ratification was carried by 119 votes in favor, 65 
against, and two abstentions. The ruling party welcomed the 
result with applause.

  [Excerpts] Buenos Aires, 21 Apr (NA) -- Foreign Minister 
Guido Di Tella has announced that the Malvinas Islands 
inhabitants have accepted an Argentine Government proposal to 
finance the elimination of minefields on the islands. The task 
will be carried out by U.S. Army Engineering Corps personnel. 
  Di Tella said this is "the first Argentine proposal the 
Kelpers have accepted" since the 1982 war. The foreign minister 
added that the Kelpers' main conditions are that the work "will 
not be carried out by Argentine experts" and that the work must 
be guaranteed to be "100 percent." 
  The Argentine Armed Forces planted some 30,000 mines on the 
islands during the conflict. It is estimated that the task of 
withdrawing them will cost between $5 and $6 million. 
  The foreign minister expressed a desire to travel to the 
islands once all mines are removed and "to walk over" the fields 
that have been surrounded by barbed wire since the end of the 
war. Argentines are forbidden entry to the islands. 
  During a news conference yesterday, Di Tella mentioned the 
possibility of financing the cleanup through a World Bank loan 
or a UN fund. The United Nations has approved a resolution 
creating a reserve to finance the removal of millions of mines 
planted around the globe. [passage omitted] 
  The foreign minister admitted that NAFTA is becoming 
"increasingly remote" for Argentina. He said this following a 
trip to Morocco where he met with representatives of various 
countries. 
  Di Tella spoke before representatives of 127 nations who 
were 
convened to sign the final act of the Uruguay round of GATT 
talks. 
  NAFTA, which comprises the United States, Mexico, and 
Canada, 
became a slim possibility when Canadian diplomats said there 
were doubts about any invitation to participate in the trade 
agreement. 
  The list of countries that are eligible to join NAFTA will 
be 
announced on 1 May. A report on who has ended up empty handed 
will be announced on 1 July.

<F P=106> [Interview with Argentine Ambassador to Great Britain Mario </F>
Campora by Ana Gerschenson at his home in Buenos Aires; date not 
given] 
  [Text] [Gerschenson] Is President Menem going to travel to 
London this year? 
  [Campora] I believe the date is closer and closer. The 
president has received invitations from all the countries that 
are partners of the United Kingdom. He was the first Latin 
American president to be invited by the Clinton administration. 
If matters continue as they have, Great Britain will be 
excluding itself from a relationship with a chief of state that 
has such a level of consideration. It is a situation that lacks 
common sense because common sense has always been one of the 
virtues that Anglo-Saxons postulate. The president's trip will 
be soon, very soon. 
  [Gerschenson] You publicly warned that with this "soft" 
policy toward the people of the Malvinas islands we could wake 
up one morning with a photograph of oil platforms sailing from 
London to the South Atlantic. Do you still believe this to be 
true? 
  [Campora] I said the topic had to be considered firmly in 
order not to receive any surprises... (silence) 
  [Gerschenson] And if we receive that surprise? 
  [Campora] ...Well... in that case... in sum... it will 
become part of the earlier evaluations. The minister himself is 
in charge of the topic and has the evaluation of the process. 
  [Gerschenson] But the minister does not tell his ambassador 
in London what he is doing with London? 
  [Campora] Yes... well. He personally is handling this 
matter and he decides. He has decided to give this matter a 
high priority and his personal effort. 
  [Gerschenson] President Menem said we are going to recover 
the islands in the year 2000. When do you see the Argentine 
flag flying over the Malvinas? 
  [Campora] That is futurism. The South Atlantic is an area 
in which Argentina's presence is progressive. When one looks at 
the map, one comes to the conclusion that the islands have an 
undisputable geographical link. There is no other alternative 
than that of integrating with the continent, and the continent 
is Argentina, and in addition it has the rights. 
  [Gerschenson] But Menem says that in the year 2000... 
  [Campora] That is a political objective. The Argentine 
projection foresees the final step of integration with the 
islands in the year 2000. In sum, in politics anything is 
possible. 
  [Gerschenson] Did they send the Christmas presents for the 
Kelpers [preceding word in English] from your embassy? 
  [Campora] No, he [Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella] sent 
them. 
  [Gerschenson] What was the repercussion on British public 
opinion regarding the assassinations during the 1982 war? 
  [Campora] This matter is currently in the hands of the 
Crown's Attorney, and within the next few days we are going to 
know what is going to be done with Scotland Yard's [preceding 
two words in English] investigation. 
  [Gerschenson] Then do you agree with the policy being 
implemented regarding the Malvinas Islands? 
  [Campora] Policy is an instrument that emerges from a higher 
level than mine, and it is executed by the president and the 
minister. I am just a subordinate.

  [Excerpt] Buenos Aires, 21 Apr (NA) -- During today's 
cabinet meeting in which he reviewed the measures to be 
implemented to foster production nationwide, Economy Minister 
Domingo Cavallo pointed out the need to "expedite" the credits 
granted by the Argentine National Bank, especially those for 
regional producers. 
  Cavallo's idea is to buttress regional economies so they 
will 
be able to compete with good-quality products both domestically 
and on the international market. 
  The package of measures will be announced by President 
Carlos 
Menem on 1 May during the opening of a new session of Congress. 
  According to what official spokesmen reported after the 
cabinet meeting, the trade balance deficit also was discussed at 
the meeting. In order to reduce it, Cavallo reportedly 
confirmed the decision to promote import restrictions and an 
export drive. 
  In light of the fact that agroindustries and agricultural 
production primary will play a central role in boosting trade, 
new measures to aid regional economies will reportedly be 
implemented and others already under way will be enhanced. 
  The economy minister reportedly explained to the president 
and his colleagues that one should bear in mind that of the 
$13,040 [figure as received] exported last year, more than 
$8,200 [figure as received] -- approximately 60 percent -- 
corresponded to primary commodities and manufactured products 
from the agriculture and livestock sector. 
  The plan for industry, which is fundamentally geared to 
providing aid to small- and medium-scale enterprises (PyMEs), 
will include financial aid through soft loans granted by the 
BICE [Bank of Investment and Foreign Trade] and the Argentine 
National Bank, a program for the development of suppliers -- the 
so-called productive areas, and the support program for the 
reorganization of the PyMEs. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Brussels, 20 Apr (EFE) -- Bolivian Foreign Minister 
Antonio Aranibar Quiroga said here today that international 
tours "enables the government to open possibilities but it is up 
to the private sector to follow them up." 
  Aranibar Quiroga today ends his three-day visit to the 
Belgian capital. Aranibar met with high-ranking European 
Commission [EC] officials and held bilateral talks with Belgian 
ministers and public and private sector representatives. 
  Aranibar held a news conference. He said that during his 
meetings with EC Vice President Manuel Marin and Juan Prat, the 
North-South relations general director, they reviewed the 
three-year EU program with Bolivia. 
  The program will be signed in May during Juan Prat's visit 
to 
La Paz. Aranibar said the program "represents an effort to 
achieve an encompassing vision" to "optimize our cooperation." 
  The basic guidelines of future EC cooperation with Bolivia 
include the struggle against poverty, state modernization, 
environmental problems, sustainable development, and regional 
integration. 
  The minister insisted on the importance of renewing and 
extending the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) with the 
Andean Pact. "There is a commitment to extend and broaden it. 
That is a reason for our presence here," Aranibar said. 
  The Bolivian minister said Bolivia has taken little 
advantage 
of the GSP. He said he wants "to make our agroindustrial trade 
to be more dynamic." 
  During his meetings with Belgian authorities he talked about 
"our basic government plans to maintain democratic and economic 
stability" and "the search for economic growth with social 
democracy." 
  "We want peaceful solutions for all Bolivian society's 
problems," said Aranibar after receiving Belgium's guarantee "to 
continue its cooperation effort, despite the economic 
difficulties facing European countries." 
  Aranibar said that in the next few months a small evaluating 
team will travel to Bolivia to review the work of the Mixed 
Commission which controls cooperation. 
  The minister said his meeting with his Belgian counterpart 
Willy Claes included "a very important exchange of information 
on our government's basic plans" and on the Bolivian offer to 
become "the point of contact and integration bridge with 
everyone in Latin America." 
  Aranibar said: "We support American hemispheric integration" 
and NAFTA (signed between Mexico, the United States, and Canada). 
  Aranibar travelled to Belgium with a small entrepreneurial 
mission. During meetings with Belgian entrepreneurs he insisted 
that the areas of oil, energy, telecommunications, airlines, and 
steel mills "offer opportunities to foreign investors. The idea 
has been received with a lot of interest here." 
  "We seek trade more than cooperation," Aranibar said. The 
Bolivian minister handed Willy Claes an official invitation for 
Belgian King Albert II, asking him to visit Bolivia "whenever he 
deems it convenient." 
  Aranibar Quiroga will travel to Sao Paulo on 21 April to 
participate in the Rio Group meeting with the European Unity 
(EU). He will then visit Germany and Spain.

  [Excerpt] Former Social Defense Under Secretary Gonzalo 
Torrico, Colonel Enrique Fernandez [former commander of the 
Special Antinarcotics Force, FELCN, in La Paz], and General Luis 
Anez [former FELCN commander] testified today before the 
Constitutional Committee of the Chamber of Deputies. We have a 
report from Amalia Pando on the testimony of Gonzalo Torrico. 
  [Begin recording] [Torrico, in progress] ...as far as I can 
remember about Isaac Chavarria, I did not get any information. 
I don't exactly remember how many prosecutors I had. 
  [Pando] Gonzalo Torrico, who headed the struggle against 
drug 
trafficking during the four years of [former President] Jaime 
Paz Zamora's administration, has showed his memory is not as 
good as that of former dictator Luis Garcia Meza. Torrico, who 
was an ADN [National Democratic Action] senator in 1988 when 
another ADN senator published the narcophoto showing Paz Zamora 
with alleged drug trafficker Isaac Chavarria. He said he never 
told President Paz Zamora or Interior Minister Guillermo 
Capobianco that Isaac Chavarria, who was shown in the picture 
with Paz Zamora, was the most wanted drug trafficker in Bolivia 
at that time. 
  [Torrico] Mr. President, I have clearly stated that the 
reception of the drug reports was not an exclusive privilege of 
the Social Defense Under Secretariat or the Interior Ministry: 
The reports went to both organizations. My relationship with 
the president was via the interior minister. When I met with 
the minister we did not talk about specific issues, we talked 
about overall policies. 
  [Deputy Juan del Granado] Did you not consider it necessary 
to tell the interior minister about this case in particular? 
Did you ever think of doing that? This is what I want to know. 
  [Torrico] No, because that kind of relationship did not 
exist. 
  [del Granado] Thank you. 
  [Pando] Between 1989 and 1991 Chavarria rose in the ranking 
of the most wanted drug traffickers. He first appeared on a 
list of the 28 most wanted traffickers, which was the first list 
Gonzalo Torrico saw. Some months later Chavarria rose to ninth 
place. 
  [Unidentified deputy] Then a list of the nine most wanted 
drug traffickers was publicly released. Not only was the list 
released, it is explained how it was established. The report 
says: As a result of thorough intelligence analysis and a 
comparison study of the people suspected by the FELCN, the 
Social Defense Under Secretariat -- which was your organization 
Mr. Torrico -- and the DEA, a list of nine drug traffickers 
considered the national kingpins was compiled. This list shows 
Isaac Chavarria in first place. 
  [Pando] In November 1991, the list was reduced to just the 
three most wanted drug traffickers. The deadline for repented 
drug traffickers to surrender had passed and the FELCN commander 
in Santa Cruz said that just three kingpins did not take 
advantage of the repentance law. The most important of the 
three was Isaac Chavarria. Despite all this evidence, Gonzalo 
Torrico never concerned himself with Chavarria's arrest. 
  [Torrico] I remember, let me reiterate, I remember 
Chavarria's name just as I remember the name Techo de Paja from 
the reports. But when I saw a list, I had no interest in any 
particular name because that was not my job. I already clearly 
pointed out that there was a specialized organization to do that. 
  [Pando] It was also established that in 1990 an ex-member of 
the FELCN, Retamozo, was murdered after formally accusing Isaac 
Chavarria. 
  [Unidentified deputy] The prosecutor was the official who 
interrogated Eduardo Adolfo Retamozo Rosas on 26 September 1990. 
Retamozo, a former FELCN official, was then released, then he 
was arrested, and then murdered. The case of Eduardo Adolfo 
Retamozo was well-known. The interrogation was handled by a 
prosecutor who worked for you, or who was assigned to the Social 
Defense Under Secretariat. Did this prosecutor -- who worked 
for you -- not inform you in detail, at least after Retamozo was 
shot dead, about his testimony. 
  [Torrico] Mr. President, prosecutors were not obliged to 
report to me directly or through their coordinators of these 
events. 
  [Pando] According to Torrico, he knew Isaac Chavarria was a 
wanted drug trafficker. He did not order his arrest because 
that is the task of the FELCN intelligence. He did not warn the 
president because it was not his duty and because the reports 
from the FELCN with the list of the most wanted drug traffickers 
were also sent to Minister Capobianco. Let us recall that, 
before this committee, Capobianco has denied being informed 
about links between Chavarria and drug trafficking. In the last 
part of his testimony, Torrico clarified that he did not work 
for the DEA or receive money from the U.S. Embassy. He also 
reiterated that no one ever asked him to protect Chavarria, 
neither Jaime Paz Zamora or Guillermo Capobianco. [end

  [Excerpts] [Begin relay] [Mario Espinoza, identified by 
screen caption] President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada on 20 April 
promulgated the Popular Participation Law, one of the bases of 
his administration as he himself has repeatedly explained to 
Bolivian citizens. 
  When promulgating the law, President Sanchez de Lozada said: 
With the promulgation of the Capitalization [as heard] Law we 
are closing a chapter in the government reorganization process. 
  The Chamber of Deputies approved the law on 20 April, 
including the amendments introduced by the Senate. The Chamber 
of Deputies also is planning to discuss the national budget 
during the congressional term that is about to expire. [end 
relay] [passage omitted] 
  As we reported a few minutes ago, labor unions are indignant 
over the approval and promulgation of the Popular Participation 
Law. 
  [Begin relay] [Cathia Rodriguez, identified by screen 
caption] Union leaders allege that the Bolivian Labor 
Federation [COB] cannot be happy with a Popular Participation 
Law that was drafted and approved without popular participation. 
According to union leaders, the law's main objective is to 
abolish traditional union organizations. 
  [First unidentified union leader] Until today, COB, labor 
unions, federations, and confederations of different sectors 
have been the mediators between civilian society and the 
government. Today, the government wants to take this role away 
from the COB. This is why the Popular Participation Law does not 
discuss the concept (?of grass-roots) organizations [words 
indistinct]. They are being virtually disavowed. 
  [Second unidentified union leader] Although laws are being 
approved, we have to see whether they will be enforced in 
Bolivia. 
  [Rodriguez] Does COB believe it can prevent their 
enforcement? 
  [Union leader] We believe we represent those who have been 
marginalized from the drafting of these laws. Therefore, those 
who have been marginalized will be following this issue very 
closely. 
  [Rodriguez] The Popular Participation Law was approved on 20 
April and the national budget will be approved soon. The union 
leaders are aware that once the budget is approved, salary 
negotiations will end then and there with the imposition of an 8 
percent salary increase offered by the government. However, 
they assert they will continue fasting until the government's 
will is broken. 
  Nationwide, there are already 90 union groups that are 
fasting and 738 people on strike. The group that has been 
fasting the longest is in La Paz. The group has been fasting 
for 18 days. At the national level, 40 people on a fast are in 
serious health. 
  Meanwhile, the demonstrations continue. This week retail 
shop workers staged two protest demonstrations. COB has 
announced that tomorrow there will be a demonstration staged by 
all labor unions. In La Paz, the demonstration is scheduled for 
1500 in San Francisco Plaza. [end relay]

  [Text] Santiago, 20 Apr (EFE) -- Chilean President Eduardo 
Frei today compared the return to democracy in Chile and the 
Czech Republic -- which took place simultaneously and in a 
civilized manner, free of any bloodshed. 
  Frei said this during a dinner party to fete Czech Prime 
Minister Vaclav Klaus who arrived from Buenos Aires today for a 
three-day official visit to Chile. 
  Frei said that the Chilean and Czech Governments "uphold 
broad respect for human rights and fully enforce the multiparty 
system." 
  The Chilean chief of state pointed out that "both countries 
enjoy a similar degree of development and uphold the 
effectiveness of an open international trade which is not 
discriminatory. They are against restrictions that prevent it 
from being clear." 
  Frei added: "In the four years since March 1990, Chile and 
the Czech Republic have come closer on several issues and have 
made efforts to build solid and fruitful relations." 
  Chile and the former Czechoslovakia resumed diplomatic 
relations at the ambassadorial level on 11 March 1990, when 
Patricio Aylwin's civilian administration assumed power, ending 
almost 17 years of General Augusto Pinochet's military regime. 
  Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus will meet with Chilean public 
and 
private sector officials and will end his visit to Santiago on

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities monitored through 21 April. 
  Bilateral trade between Chile and South Korea rose from $100 
million in 1985 to more than $750 million in 1993. This is 
equivalent to 4 percent of Chilean foreign trade. The trade 
balance with this country registered a $70 million surplus with 
exports at $413 million and imports at $343 million. (Santiago 
ESTRATEGIA in Spanish 31 Mar 94 p 25) 
  Industrial Development Association President Pedro Lizana on 
30 March reported that industry grew 4.8 percent in the year's 
first two months compared with the same period in 1993, when it

an increase of 4.5 percent compared with the same period last 
year. Employed people totalled 5,012,470, an increase of 3.5

(Santiago ESTRATEGIA in Spanish 8 Apr 94 p 10) 
  Economy Minister Alvaro Garcia reported that foreign

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto </F>
Robaina Gonzalez in Lima on 10 April] 
  [Text] [LA REPUBLICA] What results do you expect from this 
official visit you are paying to Peru? 
  [Robaina] Our visit to Peru is part of a tour of other Latin 
American countries where we will explain to our American 
brothers and the entire international community to what extent 
Cuba is determined to carry out its project, without straying 
from the historic path it has chosen, in this time of crisis. 
  The idea is to tell everyone what aspects of our revolution 
are not negotiable and what aspects of our socio-economic 
program are. Our presence here is also our response to an 
international campaign against Cuba. It is our duty to break up 
this negative campaign. 
  [LA REPUBLICA] What are the aspects of socialist Cuba that 
can be negotiated? How do you think Cuba should adapt to the new 
international context that surrounds it? 
  [Robaina] This process will, precisely, allow a new type of 
relationship with the world. We haven't asked anybody for a 
correlation of political ideologies in order to establish an 
economic relationship, and this is where we will have to adapt 
to a completely new situation. In this regard there are national 
interests that match the interests of foreign investors. What is 
a need for Cuba might be an investment opportunity for many and, 
modestly speaking, we also believe Cuba has a lot to offer the 
world. 
  [LA REPUBLICA] What guarantees and incentives does Cuba 
currently offer foreign capital? 
  [Robaina] Much is said about what Cuba can offer foreign 
investors and facts have proven that Cuba, definitely, has a lot 
to attract foreign investors. This is why we seek meetings, to 
negotiate and get more acquainted, because only thus will we be 
able to establish stable new rules. This is why we must point 
out that Cuba has opened its doors to foreign capital with legal 
and constitutional backing. This backing is clear and flexible 
enough to avoid any suspicion. 
  [LA REPUBLICA] What Cuban sectors are more attractive to 
foreign capital? What products does your country offer the 
international markets aside from sugar, of course? 
  [Robaina] We are taking very positive steps in the tourism 
field. There is also great potential in the iron and steel 
industry, in the construction sector. We also have a wide range 
of products in which the international market is interested such 
as nickel, oil, and the production and processing of citrus 
fruit. 
  [LA REPUBLICA] Is this new open door policy particularly 
directed to a certain market? 
  [Robaina] The opening to the international market is a 
priority issue for Cuba, but within this framework, we want to 
give even greater preference to Latin American investors. 
  [LA REPUBLICA] How can potential foreign investors be 
certain 
they will enjoy full guarantees in Cuba? 
  [Robaina] Those investors from various parts of the world 
who 
already are investing in Cuba can say that better than us 
because it is a fact. We have investors from Spain, Canada, 
Italy, France, and also from Latin American countries such as 
Colombia, Argentina, Brazil. They are not only looking into the 
possibilities of investing but already have invested in our 
country, and our relationship with them is excellent. 
  [LA REPUBLICA] This means that the future of foreign 
investments in Cuba is quite promising. 
  [Robaina] It should be pointed out that Cuba's relationship 
with foreign investors is not as smooth and easy as in other 
countries. It must be taken into account that we are promoting 
this opening with great opposition. In order to attract foreign 
investors we have not only had to grant them a legal framework 
that would give them guarantees, but we also have had to be 
quite bold and brave. It is no secret that whoever tries to make 
deals with Cuba is subject to great pressure. If the new 
investors want legal guarantees, they already have them. 
Moreover, there is the guarantee of the facts, there is the 
testimony of those already investing in Cuba. 
  [LA REPUBLICA] What are the expectations regarding Cuba's 
relationship with Peru in this new phase? 
  [Robaina] In all our commercial relationships, Cuba does not 
go around the world only saying what it needs. We, modestly, 
also offer what could be of help to friendly countries. In sum, 
I believe that in Peru's case we have a lot to offer in the 
sugar industry; we have a tourism market that may interest many 
investors; we have significant technological development in the 
medical and paramedical fields, in the production of medical 
equipment, important developments in the biotechnology field; we 
also have important experience in the sports field. We hope to 
increase our relationship with Peru in the commercial and 
investments fields, which will, in turn, strengthen our 
traditional historic and cultural ties. 
  [LA REPUBLICA] Is the U.S. commercial blockade imposed more 
than 30 years ago the only obstacle to Cuba's new political 
opening being fully successful in the near future? 
  [Robaina] We have never said that the blockade is the only 
cause of our problems. The problems Cuba has experienced lately 
are the combination of a series of factors but, definitely, the 
blockade is the greatest obstacle. Now, more than ever in this 
crucial phase, we have to bear a tremendous pressure exerted not 
only directly against Cuba but also against whoever deals with 
or invests in Cuba. 
  [LA REPUBLICA] Is tourism the field in which Cuba has 
attracted the most foreign investment? 
  [Robaina] Let us talk about priorities. Tourism is a market 
with lots of possibilities for Cuba and important steps in this 
area have been taken. Cuba's climate is very attractive to any 
tourist in the world. This is why we have given tourism the same 
level of development as other very promising fields for foreign 
investors. However, we should bear in mind that we have resorted 
to tourism out of need, due to the difficulties Cuba is facing. 
But it is no secret to anybody that, aside from the capital, 
tourism in countries such as ours have a very high political and 
social cost. 
  [LA REPUBLICA] Does this mean that tourism for Cuba 
represents more problems than solutions? 
  [Robaina] No. That is not so. If we have promoted tourism in 
Cuba it is because we have no alternatives at this very 
difficult moment. But, fortunately, tourism has developed at a 
time when the Cuban people have reached a cultural, 
technological, scientific, and political level that has allowed 
us to face the opening to the tourism industry in a suitable 
way. There is no doubt that tourism today is as important as any 
of our harvests. 
  [LA REPUBLICA] On the domestic front, how does the Cuban 
Government intend to face the black market's socio-economic 
problem? 
  [Robaina] The so-called black market exists; we do not deny 
nor try to conceal our problems. Everyone is aware that in times 
of crisis and in the midst of such adverse circumstances as the 
ones we are enduring, the surfacing of the black market is 
something "natural" from the economic viewpoint. The black 
market speculates with the peoples' needs. What we have to do 
about this and other social problems is to normalize life in 
Cuba, produce more to meet the peoples' needs. This challenge 
requires the implementation of very special measures that adjust 
to the new circumstances under which we live. This is the reason 
for the great nationwide debate to get everyone to participate 
in the decisionmaking on these new measures. These measures 
will be assessed and adopted by the National Assembly of the 
People's Government convened for 1 May.

  [Text] Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina Gonzalez 
yesterday signed two agreements with Efrain Goldenberg 
Schreiber, the prime and foreign minister. One relates to 
customs cooperation between the National Customs Administration 
Superintendency (Sunad) and the Cuban General Customs 
Directorate. The other is a cooperation agreement on the 
struggle against drug trafficking. 
  Robaina said his country has signed similar documents with 
other countries. 
  Robaina met yesterday in private with his Peruvian 
counterpart. He said his country offers necessary legal 
guarantees for Peruvian businessmen to invest in Cuba. 
  He said: "There is communication and room for exchange. We 
want to talk about Cuba's real situation and we want to know the 
real situation in Peru." 
  Before meeting with Goldenberg, Robaina lectured to 
businessmen on what his country has to offer. 
  He said he will also explain what Cuba has to offer to the 
Peruvian foreign minister because he wants to strengthen 
bilateral commercial relations. 
  He added: "The most important issues are related to sugar, 
tourism, and medical, paramedical, scientific, biotechnological, 
and sports cooperation."

  [Text] Lima, 20 Apr (EFE) -- In a new chapter in the 
political clash between Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori and 
Lima Mayor Ricardo Belmont, the municipality of Lima today 
declared the Peruvian president a "persona non grata." 
  The municipal council approved the declaration by a 30-5 
vote, with five abstentions. 
  In its whereas clauses, the declaration points out that 
"citizen Alberto Fujimori" has damaged Lima by approving a law 
reducing municipal income by 40 percent, and claims that the 
president has refused to talk with the Lima mayor, instead 
meeting with imprisoned terrorist leaders. 
  The declaration thus hints at Fujimori's meeting with 
terrorist leader Osman Morote last week while inspecting the 
Yanamayo top security prison in Puno Department, on the Bolivian 
border. 
  The document declares "citizen Alberto Fujimori" to be a 
"persona non grata" in order to distinguish his position as 
president of the Republic, which according to the Peruvian 
Constitution "represents a symbol of the nation." 
  The hassle between Belmont and Fujimori began three months 
ago, when the government decided to redistribute the national 
municipal promotion tax in a more equitable manner in order to 
allocate more funds to the poorest municipalities. 
  This measure, however, involved a reduction in the funds 
allocated to the Lima municipality, which was also interpreted 
as a political maneuver aimed at preventing Belmont from 
becoming a possible presidential candidate in the 1995 general 
elections. 
  From the moment the measure was implemented, the Lima mayor 
has been openly and totally opposing the government, while 
Fujimori has been refusing to meet him as he feels the mayor 
must reorganize his tax administration to secure more funds.

  [Text] Lima, 21 Apr (EFE) -- According to opposition 
legislator Roger Caceres [National Front of Workers and 
Peasants, FNTC, secretary general], at least 60 people have been 
killed in the offensive launched at the beginning of April by 
the Peruvian Army against Shining Path [SL] terrorists in the 
Huanuco Department jungle area. 
  Refusing to specify whether the dead were SL members or 
civilians, Caceres said he had recently visited the region, and 
charged that military forces are "harming the civilian 
population" with helicopter attacks. 
  Caceres said he had toured several areas in Huanuco's 
Leoncio 
Prado Province, where security forces are conducting the 
military operations. 
  The legislator, who is a member of the Democratic 
Constituent 
Congress (CCD) Human Rights Committee, said he has asked the CCD 
to summon Defense Minister Victor Malca and Interior Minister 
Juan Briones to explain the situation in the region. 
  Caceres has also asked the CCD to summon Attorney General 
Blanca Nelida Colan. 
  In a communique issued 20 April the Defense Ministry denies 
that civilians are either being bombarded or attacked, and 
reports that the antiterrorist military operations were launched 
on 5 April. 
  Moreover, a communique issued by the National Coordinating 
Board of Human Rights reports "massive crimes against a 
defenseless civilian population" in districts on the left bank 
of the Huallaga River. 
  Citing settlers who have fled the region, the Coordinating 
Board reports that "armored helicopters are firing upon the 
civilian population, while military columns on land are 
torturing survivors, raping women, and burning down the 
peasants' huts." 
  Peruvian media reports state that bombardments have been 
carried out during the 15 days the operation has lasted. 
  The Lima newspaper "ONDA" reports that the Army "has 
launched 
an attack by air and by land" and that it is estimated that SL 
forces in the area total 500 men. 
  According to newspaper "ONDA," 70 SL members were killed, 
but 
the killing of civilians has been ruled out. 
  The Defense Ministry communique states that from 5 to 18 
April, 14 terrorists were killed and 12 others arrested in 
clashes between military patrols and SL columns. The communique 
adds that three soldiers were injured. 
  It also states that the military operations "are being 
conducted without affecting local settlers." 
  President Alberto Fujimori has "categorically" denied any 
helicopter bombings. 
  Moreover, Coordinating Board Executive Secretary Rosa Mujica 
insists that civilians have been killed, and has requested that 
the Red Cross be allowed to visit the area.

<F P=106> [Report by special correspondents Ana Patricia Candiani and </F>
Rosi Ahuaxi Vazquez for the "ACIR Radio News" newscast] 
  [Excerpts] Today the country focuses its attention on 
Chiapas State, where Dr. Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon paid a 
surprise visit. He met in San Cristobal de las Casas with 
Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for peace and reconciliation 
in Chiapas State, as well as with mediator Bishop Samuel Ruiz. 
[passage omitted] 
  In a surprise and brief visit, the agenda of which was a 
secret right up until the last minute, Ernesto Zedillo visited 
Chiapas, in the first stages of his political campaign, a 
campaign begun by Luis Donaldo Colosio. He arrived at 1000 in 
San Cristobal de las Casas, where he was interviewed by local 
radio station XEWM Radio 640. There he reiterated his statement 
made in Tuxtla Gutierrez as he deplaned: Peace, harmony, and 
unity are essential to reaching agreements that fully satisfy 
those with fair demands. Ernesto Zedillo was clear when he was 
asked whether he would be willing to talk to the EZLN. He 
replied: The federal government is responsible first; only if 
the government asks me would I participate in that dialogue. 
  [Begin Zedillo recording] The negotiations are without a 
doubt the government's responsibility, specifically through the 
president's peace commissioner. I have said that I am willing 
to talk in good faith with any Mexican citizen. If at any time 
the peace commissioner, the government, considers it important 
that I attest or guarantee that I will honor the government's 
commitments when I take office, I will do so with pleasure. [end 
recording] 
  Ernesto Zedillo admitted that the country's future is at 
risk 
and that our future will depend on what we do today. Poverty, 
dropouts, and exclusions should anger us and serve as incentive 
to decisively fight these issues. 
  After Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon's interview with this 
local radio station, he met privately with Bishop Samuel Ruiz of 
San Cristobal de las Casas. This private conversation lasted 
about 40 minutes. He spoke about this conversation at a news 
conference in the main park. 
  [Begin Zedillo recording] It was a conversation where I 
basically reiterated to him what I already said publicly this 
morning on the radio regarding my wish that permanent peace and 
reconciliation be achieved soon here in Chiapas. [end recording] 
  Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon walked through the main park 
in 
San Cristobal de las Casas, where people declared their demands 
for peace because they have lived through war. 
  Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon also answered some reporters' 
questions. One question was on whether a campaign against 
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari exists. He simply replied 
the president deserves esteem, respect, and consideration. 
Regarding economic pressures, he said that conditions look 
promising. Luis Donaldo Colosio's death led to a climate of 
uncertainty, but as the days pass we will regain confidence. 
  Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon arrived in San Cristobal de 
las 
Casas with a reinforced personal escort. At the end of his 
interview in the main park in San Cristobal de las Casas, he 
returned to Tuxtla Gutierrez, where he will board a private 
flight to Mexico City.

  [Text] Tegucigalpa, 21 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- Honduran President 
Carlos Roberto Reina announced today that in the next few hours 
he will decree a state of national emergency in light of the 
serious energy crisis affecting the country. In statements at 
the Government House, the president said the decree will be made 
public this Thursday as part of a search for solutions to the 
serious problem of the electricity shortage, a situation which 
forced authorities to regulate the service three months ago. 
  Reina declared that he has spoken to the presidents of 
Panama 
and Nicaragua, Guillermo Endara and Violeta Chamorro, as well as 
to advisers of Costa Rican President Rafael Angel Calderon to 
ask for their help in solving the problem. The president said 
that Honduras will ask these countries to sell their energy 
surplus to Honduras so as to try to cover the daily deficit of 
over 80 megawatts that now exists in local electricity supply. 
  Three months ago, the National Enterprise for Electric Power 
(ENEE) implemented an energy rationing plan that has caused 
losses estimated in the millions for the private sector, in 
addition to interfering with the government's activities, as 
well of those of citizens in general. 
  The crisis was brought on by a lack of water at the 
"Francisco Morazan" hydroelectric plant, which supplies 63 
percent of the national demand, as well as by a lack of planning 
by previous administrations, according to official sources. 
  Operations at the hydroelectric plant could come to a 
standstill in the next three months if the rainy season is not 
good, ENEE experts concluded.

<F P=106> [Report by Orlando Mendieta C.] </F>
  [Text] Ernesto Perez Balladares, presidential candidate for 
the Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD), has fallen 3.5 percent 
in voter preference for election as president of Panama, while 
Ruben Blades of the Papa Egoro Movement [MPE] moved up to second 
place, increasing his popularity among voters by 3.1 percent, 
according to a poll conducted by the Center for Latin American 
Studies (CELA). 
  Marco Gandasegui, director of the CELA survey, reported that 
the fifth CELA poll was conducted in early April among 2,600 
people, excluding the Provinces of Darien, Bocas del Toro, and 
the San Blas Intendancy. 
  According to Gandasegui, in light of the call to unite civic 
forces against the PRD, a virtual union between Carles, Mireya 
Moscoso de Gruber, and Eduardo Vallarino could garner a high 
enough percentage of votes to challenge the candidacy of Perez 
Balladares. 
  The poll revealed that Perez Balladares continues to lead 
voters' preferences with 29.7 percent. However, he descended in 
popularity in comparison with the previous CELA poll, in which 
he obtained 33.2 percent support. 
  Meanwhile, Blades, who in the previous poll got 13.4 
percent, 
which placed him third in voter preference, won 16.5 percent of 
popular support in this poll, boosting him into second place. 
  Although he registered a 0.4-percent increase in popular 
support over the previous poll, Ruben Dario Carles of MOLIRENA 
[Nationalist Liberal Republican Movement] has fallen back to 
third place on the chart with 14.8 percent support. 
  Meanwhile, Mireya Moscoso de Gruber of the Arnulfist Party 
came in fourth in voter preference with 14.3 percent, reflecting 
a 6.3-percent hike over the previous poll in which she won 8.5 
percent support. 
  The CELA poll revealed the following order for other 
candidates: Eduardo Vallarino of the Christian Democratic Party 
(PDC) with 2.6 percent, Samuel Lewis Galindo of Solidarity with 
1.3 percent, and Jose Salvador Munoz of the Doctrinaire 
Panamenist Party with 0.3 percent. 
  Gandasegui said that this was the last CELA poll before the 
8 
May elections. He announced that the organization plans to 
conduct another survey once the elections are over. 
  He added that this poll was conducted before President 
Endara 
aired the videos showing compromising footage against the PRD, 
as well as before the latest ILDEA-sponsored [Latin American 
Institute of Advanced Studies] presidential debate. Gandasegui 
noted that it is possible that these events have changed the 
level of preference for specific candidates.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities monitored through 21 April. 
  The Inter-American Development Bank, IDB, has granted 
Uruguay 
a $30 million loan to finance investments in social policies, 
health services, education, employment, and justice system 
modernization. The loan agreement was signed in Guadalajara, 
Mexico, by Economy and Finance Minister Ignacio de Posadas and 
IDB President Enrique Iglesias. (Montevideo EL PAIS in Spanish 9 
Apr 94 p 1) 
  The General Taxation Directorate, DGI, has reported that tax 
collections during 1993 did not increase, despite all government 
and DGI efforts in that direction. The report says that between 
January and November 1993, Uruguayans paid $1.95 billion in 
taxes, while foreign trade contributed $157 million. (Montevideo 
EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO in Spanish 11 Apr 94 p 9) 
  The Central Bank reported on 11 April that the trade balance 
deficit continued to grow during January 1994. Total exports 
during this month were close to $113 million, while imports 
amounted to nearly $189 million. During this month exports grew 
by 6.9 percent, while imports increased by almost 14 percent as 
compared to the figures for January 1993. The report notes, 
however, that the deficit is almost entirely covered by income 
from tourism and the entry of new capital. (Montevideo EL 
OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO in Spanish 12 Apr 94 p 7)

  [Text] Santiago, 20 Apr (EFE) -- Chilean President Eduardo 
Frei today compared the return to democracy in Chile and the 
Czech Republic -- which took place simultaneously and in a 
civilized manner, free of any bloodshed. 
  Frei said this during a dinner party to fete Czech Prime 
Minister Vaclav Klaus who arrived from Buenos Aires today for a 
three-day official visit to Chile. 
  Frei said that the Chilean and Czech Governments "uphold 
broad respect for human rights and fully enforce the multiparty 
system." 
  The Chilean chief of state pointed out that "both countries 
enjoy a similar degree of development and uphold the 
effectiveness of an open international trade which is not 
discriminatory. They are against restrictions that prevent it 
from being clear." 
  Frei added: "In the four years since March 1990, Chile and 
the Czech Republic have come closer on several issues and have 
made efforts to build solid and fruitful relations." 
  Chile and the former Czechoslovakia resumed diplomatic 
relations at the ambassadorial level on 11 March 1990, when 
Patricio Aylwin's civilian administration assumed power, ending 
almost 17 years of General Augusto Pinochet's military regime. 
  Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus will meet with Chilean public 
and 
private sector officials and will end his visit to Santiago on 
22 April with the signing of a broad cooperation agreement in 
the areas of culture, education, and science.

  [Excerpt] Fernando Henrique Cardoso has chosen Deputy Jose 
Serra (PSDB-SP) [Brazilian Social Democracy Party-Sao Paulo 
State] to coordinate the drafting of his government program. 
  Cardoso has also chosen former Deputy Euclides Scalco 
(Parana 
State) as the national coordinator of his electoral campaign. 
Scalco will in turn designate the respective regional 
coordinators. 
  The program will be completed by 21 May when the PSDB 
national convention will officially nominate Cardoso as its 
presidential candidate. Serra will be assisted by a team of 
aides. 
  Serra, who is expected to seek a Senate seat for Sao Paulo 
State, is considered to be one of Cardoso's closest and most 
influential friends. If Cardoso is elected president, Serra is 
likely to become his finance minister. 
  Serra understands Cardoso's political thinking better than 
anyone else. Their relations are often marked by disagreement 
and tension. In addition to drafting the government program, 
Serra will serve as a type of permanent adviser to Cardoso. 
  Scalco's appointment seeks to assuage the wrath of the 
leftist wing of the PSDB over the alliance that has been almost 
concluded with the PFL [Liberal Front Party] and over the 
virtual choice of Deputy Luiz Eduardo Magalhaes -- son a former 
Bahia Governor Antonio Carlos Magalhaes -- as Cardoso's running 
mate. 
  Scalco has always been identified with the left wing of the 
PSDB. His first task will be to confer with the PSDB blocs that 
oppose a coalition with the PFL. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Emanuel Neri] </F>
  [Text] In addition to facing internal opposition to the 
alliance with the Liberal Front Party [PFL] for Fernando 
Henrique Cardoso's presidential candidacy, the Brazilian Social 
Democracy Party [PSDB] is having problems forming coalitions to 
back candidates at the state government level. 
  In many states local PSDB members support the agreement with 
the PFL at the national level, but they reject regional 
coalitions with the same party. 
  Ceara, the state run by the only PSDB governor, is the best 
example of this conflict. 
  PSDB members in Ceara State do not want to hear about any 
alliance with local PFL members, whom they regard as their 
longtime adversaries. 
  In Ceara State, PSDB members would rather form an alliance 
with the PT [Workers Party] and the PDT [Democratic Labor 
Party]. The PT could nominate the running mate for Tasso 
Jereissati, the PSDB candidate for governor of Ceara State. 
  Deputy Jackson Pereira (PSDB-Ceara State) said: "There is a 
no-win situation here." If Cardoso comes to Fortaleza to attend 
a rally, the local PSDB leaders will not allow their PFL 
counterparts to share the same stage with them. "Either the 
presidential candidate decides not to come here, or we will have 
to hold separate rallies," Pereira added. In Pernambuco, the 
PSDB has two federal deputies who may have to go separate ways. 
  Deputy Wilson Campos (PSDB-Pernambuco State) supports the 
gubernatorial candidacy of Miguel Arraes, who is running for the 
PSB [Brazilian Socialist Party]-PT coalition. The other PSDB 
deputy for Pernambuco is Maurilio Ferreira Lima, who favors an 
alliance with the PFL and the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic 
Movement Party]. 
  Campos has suggested that the PSDB give freedom of action to 
its members to vote for the candidate of their choice in the 
Pernambuco gubernatorial election. He said that, otherwise, he 
would still vote for Arraes and admitted the possibility of 
voting for [PT candidate Luis Inacio] Lula [da Silva] for 
president. 
  In his efforts to widen his support base, Cardoso has 
compounded these conflicts. In Mato Grosso do Sul State, the 
local PSDB branch reached an agreement with the PMDB to support 
PMDB gubernatorial candidate Wilson Martins. The incumbent 
governor, Pedro Pedrossian (Brazilian Labor Party), has 
torpedoed the agreement. 
  Pedrossian persuaded Cardoso that in order for the 
presidential candidate to obtain his support the local PSDB must 
endorse the gubernatorial candidate nominated by Pedrossian. 
This provoked a division among PSDB members in the state. 
  There is a similar problem in Parana State. The local PSDB 
branch already has agreed to form a coalition with Jaime Lerner, 
the Democratic Labor Party candidate for Parana governor, but 
Cardoso has promised Popular Party leader Alvaro Dias that the 
PSDB would support him. 
  Deputy Deni Schwartz (PSDB-Parana State) said: "They are 
going to destroy the party if they insist on that agreement." 
He said Lerner has always been "loyal" to the PSDB and does not 
deserve to be abandoned. 
  In Rio de Janeiro, Cardoso will face the predicament of 
having to support one of these two candidates for governor: 
Marcello Alencar (PSDB) and General Newton Cruz (Democratic 
Social Party), who could obtain the PFL endorsement.

  [Excerpts] The parties that have presidential candidates 
have prepared government platforms based on amendments to the 
Constitution despite the fact that the constitutional revision 
process is paralyzed. 
  All the government platforms so far prepared foresee 
amendments to the Constitution. FOLHA has done a study of the 
proposals of the parties that intend to launch their own 
candidates for president of the Republic. [passage omitted] 
  PDT [Democratic Labor Party] -- Proposal Reduces Federal 
Taxes 
  The proposals to amend the Constitution included in the 
preliminary PDT platform are: 
  -- Tax reform, by reducing the number of federal taxes from 
eight to four (Article 153). 
  -- Increase national budget allocations for social programs 
-- such as health, basic education, and housing -- for states 
and municipalities (Articles 20 and 32). 
  -- Modify the number of deputies per state in the Chamber of 
Deputies so that the number of deputies is proportional to the 
number of inhabitants per state (Article 45). 
  -- Cancel special retirement pensions for professionals not 
subject to stressful activities such as, for example, 
congressmen (Article 201). 
  PSDB/PFL [Brazilian Social Democracy Party/Liberal Front 
Party] -- Parties Disagree Over Income Tax Rule 
  The PSDB and the PFL are still discussing proposals for 
constitutional amendments. The main points are: 
  -- Tax reform, by reducing the number of taxes (Article 
153). 
The two parties disagree over income tax rules. 
  -- Reform the social security system so as to increase 
minimum wage retirement pensions (Article 201). 
  -- Redistribute federal budget allocations for states and 
municipalities (Articles 20 and 32). 
  -- Make the state monopoly in the fields of oil and 
telecommunications (Articles 176 and 177) more flexible. The 
PFL wants monopolies abolished. 
  PT [Workers Party] -- Reform Affects Labor Union Structure 
  The amendments included in the PT preliminary government 
platform are: 
  -- Tax reform, by including a program to guarantee a minimum 
income (Article 153). 
  -- Redistribute federal budget allocations among the federal 
government, states, and municipalities (Articles 20 and 32). 
  -- Eliminate single labor union membership by allowing a 
labor category to be represented by more than one labor union 
(Article 8). 
  -- Make changes in Labor Court powers (Article 114). 
  -- Establish external control over judicial branch decisions 
(Article 99). 
  -- Ensure party fidelity (Article 17). 
  PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] -- Government 
Platforms Seeks To Modify Federal Budget Allocations 
  The main amendments proposed by the PMDB range from creating 
new taxes to changes in Chamber of Deputies representation. 
  -- Tax reform: The PMDB government platform does not explain 
what amendments it considers necessary (Article 153). 
  -- Reform the social security system (Articles 201 and 202). 
  -- Redefine federal budget allocations among the federal 
government, states, and municipalities (Articles 20 and 202). 
  -- Make public monopolies more flexible (Article 17). 
  -- Ensure party fidelity (Article 17). 
  -- Make changes in the representation of the states in the 
Chamber of Deputies (Article 45).

<F P=106> [Report by Salete Sodreira from Brasilia] </F>
  [Text] The Federal Supreme Court, STF, upheld the Bahia 
State law allowing the local legislative assembly to indirectly 
elect former Governor Antonio Carlos Magalhaes' successor. 
  The former governor resigned his position to run in the 3 
October general elections. The Bahia legislative assembly had 
approved a law allowing the election of a successor to finish 
the gubernatorial mandate. A group of parties resorted to the 
STF, stating that the law was unconstitutional because 
gubernatorial elections must be handled by Congress. They also 
alleged that voting for the successor could not be open as 
established in Bahia State law. By a seven-four vote, the STF 
justices ruled the state law was based on the Constitution and 
that Gov. Antonio Carlos Magalhaes' successor must be elected in 
30 days. Vice Governor Paulo Souto also resigned his position to 
run in the October elections.

  [Text] Sao Paulo -- Comments on the October elections have 
divided the Catholic Church. Criticized by his fellow bishops 
at the 32d General Assembly of the National Conference of 
Brazilian Bishops (CNBB) for having made political remarks, CNBB 
President Dom Luciano Mendes de Almeida yesterday stated that he 
will no longer reveal his ideas about the October elections. 
Dom Serafim Fernandes, archbishop of Belo Horizonte and vice 
president of the CNBB, has said that Mendes de Almeida's 
opinions reflect "only his personal views," and are not in 
keeping with CNBB ideas about the current political situation. 
  Fernandes said: He has every right to express his personal 
views on the electoral process, but they do not necessarily 
reflect the CNBB's position. 
  In informal comments made at the Itaici convent on 17 April, 
Mendes de Almeida described the PSDB-PFL [Brazilian Social 
Democracy Party-Liberal Front Party] alliance as "a rather 
coercive marriage." In recent days, the bishops have exchanged 
caustic remarks over the release of an electoral leaflet 
sponsored by the CNBB. The wording of the leaflet was 
considered to be favorable to the PT [Workers Party]. 
  Catholic priests and laymen have criticized Mendes de 
Almeida's remark about the PSDB-PFL coalition. One of his main 
critics was Dom Jose Carlos de Lima Vaz, auxiliary bishop of Rio 
de Janeiro. Lima Vaz said Mendes de Almeida's remarks may lead 
to misunderstandings, and may give the impression that the CNBB 
has reservations about the PFL. Dom Boaventura Kloppenburg, 
bishop of Novo Hamburgo, also criticized Mendes de Almeida by 
noting that no one may state that the market economy proposal -- 
which is upheld by several parties, the PFL included -- is 
unfeasible. 
  Mendes de Almeida had been criticized earlier for having met 
last week with PT leader Luis Inacio Lula da Silva. The meeting 
was seen as a move to bring the Church and the PT closer 
together. According to Mendes de Almeida, the meeting was held 
at Lula's request and was focused on specific issues, such as 
the removal of the proposal to decriminalize abortion from the 
PT program. He assured his CNBB colleagues that the Church will 
not support any one candidate. 
  Mendes de Almeida said at the CNBB assembly: We ought to 
meet with all the other presidential candidates, too.

  [Text] Following orders from Rio de Janeiro Governor Nilo 
Batista, Military Police [PM] Commander Carlos Nazareth 
Cerqueira yesterday dismissed Lieutenant Colonel Valmir Brum 
from his post as chief of the PM Judicial Department. Brum is 
an officer who was engaged in the operation against the numbers 
game operators. Brum's dismissal was decided at a meeting 
between former Rio de Janeiro Governor Leonel Brizola and 
leaders of the Democratic Labor Party [PDT]. Lieutenant Colonel 
Francisco Sergio Rangel, who has also taken action against the 
numbers game kingpins, will also be dismissed. Lieutenant 
Colonel Marcos Antonio Paes, chief of the PM Secret Service, who 
also actively participated in the operation, will be given a 
leave of absence on 28 April to take a course, and is not likely 
to resume his post. The three officers have always been praised 
by their PM superiors and by the Rio de Janeiro State 
Government, but they were criticized when they disclosed that 
politicians linked to the PDT were on the list of whose who 
received bribes from the numbers game kingpins. They have been 
charged with "planting" the names of Governor Batista and PDT 
congressmen. The dismissals have provoked indignation among the 
prosecutors who are handling the case, who once again contended 
that the list is genuine.

  [Text] The most probable date for the implementation of the 
real is not 1 June. The proposals are now centered on 1 July, 
but a lot of people inside and outside the government consider 
it possible that the new currency will be put into circulation 
on 1 August. 
  As the government imposed upon itself the regulation that 
the 
public be informed of the launching of the new currency with 35 
days' notice, the first decisive date is 27 April. The 
government thus has 10 days to evaluate whether the conditions 
exist for putting the real into circulation on 1 June. That is 
very little time for resolving the many problems the economic 
plan is facing. 
  There are at least two basic conditions to be met before the 
real can be implemented. The first condition is that the 
economy should be operating in URV's (real value units). The 
second is that inflation in real cruzeiros remain stable, that 
is, the same inflation rate should be repeated for a reasonable 
period of time, such as, for example, three months. 
  The first condition is far from being accomplished. The 
(energy, fuel, and telephone, etc.) utility rates will not be 
converted into URV's until the end of May, according to Finance 
Minister Rubens Ricupero. 
  These utility rates are important factors in the production 
costs of any merchandise. It will thus not be possible to 
conduct internal economic activity in URV's until after the end 
of May, when the utility rate values are known. 
  Aside from this, industry and commerce do not yet conduct 
their business in URV's. Commerce, which paid industries in 
installments and collected cash from consumers, obtained 
financial profits by putting the money received on the financial 
market. This profit will disappear with the URV. 
  In turn the industries, knowing they would receive their 
money in 30 or 60 days, added to their prices the financial cost 
of the expected inflation. In sales in URV's this financial 
cost will have to be eliminated -- that is, industries should 
give discounts. 
  It is just that commerce wants a discount that is large 
enough to compensate for the losses it will suffer with the end 
of the market gains. And the industries, of course, want to 
give the smallest discount possible. As long as this is not 
defined, the economy will not be stabilized. 
  The other condition for the implementation of the real -- 
the 
stabilization of inflation -- can only be evaluated in June. 
During the first month of the URV, that is, in March, inflation 
in real cruzeiros varied between 41.9 percent and 45.7 percent. 
This means that inflation in URV's was 43.5 percent. It is 
possible that this index will be repeated this month, indicating 
there is no new inflation. 
  In May, however, the prices of winter clothes may make the 
inflation rate surpass 43.5 percent, and then it will be 
necessary to wait for the inflation of June to verify whether 
other factors are fueling inflation. 
  The government is not in a hurry. The rules for issuing the 
real are not even defined, according to statements by Central 
Bank President Pedro Malan. He denies that the government is 
being delayed. "We are not lost," he said, "we are benefiting 
from the time the debate is taking."

  [Text] After meeting with Planning Minister Beni Veras and 
Mines and Energy Minister Alexis Stepanenko on 18 April, 
National Privatization Program Director Andre Franco Montoro 
Filho reported that the privatization of electricity industry 
companies will not be made during President Itamar Franco's 
administration. 
  According to Montoro Filho, the process' complexity made the 
privatization commission and Ministers Veras and Stepanenko 
decide to divide the sector into three areas -- electricity 
generation, transmission, and distribution -- under the 
coordination of one self-financed public company. The government 
concluded that by simply selling the electricity industry 
companies, it could leave regions that have no commercial appeal 
without electricity.

  [Text] The prices of the products manufactured by the 
Brazilian Ammunition Company (CBC) -- Brazil's largest arms and 
ammunition manufacturer -- have since 1990 dropped very 
noticeably in real terms. Today, its Brazilian clients pay 
about 50 percent of the price they paid four years ago. On some 
products, the cut has been 70 percent. 
  This is the concrete and most tangible result, for 
consumers, 
of the broad managerial restructuring process the enterprise has 
undergone since 1990, and which is now entering its second phase. 
  The CBC was founded in 1926 by the Matarazzo family and is 
today controlled by the Arbi group of Rio de Janeiro (with 30 
percent of the shares in the hands of the War Materiel Industry, 
Imbel). During 1994 it will invest $8 million in Belgian and 
Italian equipment and machines that will allow the enterprise to 
double the production of some types of ammunition. 
  The enterprise has also begun a process in which part of the 
work will be contracted out to third parties. CBC suppliers 
will produce the parts and components that are not specifically 
built by CBC. For example, negotiations have already begun with 
suppliers of wood (imbuia and ivantiji [types of Brazilian 
wood]). The wood is used for gun stocks. Considering the 
production of ammunition and arms involves productive processes 
of metallurgical and chemical nature, it is wiser to order 
wooden pieces from specialists. 
  The plan to order parts from third parties is, however, more 
comprehensive, as CBC president Antonio Marcos Moraes Barros put 
it. CBC intends to buy from third parties most of the 105 items 
that it uses to manufacture rifles. At its factory in Ribeirao 
Pires, in the Sao Paulo industrial belt, CBC will continue to 
master essential technology for arms production, like rifle 
chambers and barrels, and the assembly and testing phases, for 
which the company has special equipment and laboratories. 
  A third major point in this plan is an advertising campaign 
that the enterprise has set in motion, at an estimated cost of 
$2.8 million, through the Enio Minardi agency. 
  Some six months ago, the enterprise ordered a survey to 
identify who buys arms and ammunition in Brazil. The main 
conclusion is that buyers are generally frightened people, who 
are upset and who make the decision to buy arms as a reaction to 
violence. They frequently buy a gun that is not suitable for 
their objective, or the incorrect ammunition. 
  Based on that information, ads were published in magazines 
-- 
beginning with EXAME VIP -- describing the arms that can be 
bought in Brazil and how they can be bought. This first ad 
specifically referred to the 12-caliber pump-action shotgun. 
The ad emphasized security for the consumer's home or business. 
The decision to publish the adds was delayed, Barros said, 
because the enterprise knows this is a sensitive matter that can 
hurt people's feelings. 
  With this advertising campaign, CBC is trying to diversify 
its consumer market. The enterprise is looking for consumers 
because it decided that increasing its production capacity and 
its production itself are the basic goals of its restructuring 
plan -- the first stage of which is based on a quality program 
that introduced radical changes into the productive processes. 
  The company's production capacity is increasing very much: 
In 1991, the company manufactured 12 million rounds of 
ammunition and 1.6 million guns (shotguns and rifles); this 
year, it will produce 22 million rounds of ammunition and 7 
million guns. This represents an increase of 83 percent and 337 
percent, respectively. But is there market for all the CBC 
production? Is the demand for weapons increasing in the same 
proportion? 
  Barros promptly says no. He adds that, at best, 
international demand for arms and ammunitions is stagnant. The 
fundamental difference for the company, however, is that it has 
noticeably increased its exports. Over four years, the CBC 
sales abroad increased from $11.5 million to $24.5 million. 
Currently, 60 percent of the ammunition and 80 percent of the 
guns produced by CBC are exported. Basically, what made the 
company gain a bigger market share in the United States, all 
European countries except Italy, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, 
and Australia was its prices, which are nearly 5 percent lower 
than those of its main international rivals. 
  Exports Director Gilberto Salm said the company is also 
selling, although indirectly, to some East Europe countries. 
Companies headquartered in West European countries purchase CBC 
arms and ammunition and reexport them to other countries, 
including countries of the former Communist bloc. The Brazilian 
Government supervises these sorts of exports. 
  As a result of the recent emphasis given to exports, the 
Armed Forces are no longer the CBC main customer. Some years 
ago, as much as 35 percent of the CBC production was purchased 
by the Brazilian Armed Forces. This has dropped to 10 percent. 
The CBC reorganization process began in 1990 when the Arbi 
group bought the company in 1979 [date as published] from the 
two partners who had been controlling the company since 1936 
(the U.S. Remington Arms Co. and the British ICI complex). 
Barros was appointed president of the company by the Arbi group 
after having worked at the Eluma company for 18 years. During 
the time Roberto Gusmao headed the Industry and Commerce 
Ministry, he was the ministry's secretary general. 
  The reorganization began by the adoption of new production 
procedures. Without funds to invest in large projects or 
expensive machinery, the best alternative to modernize the 
company was to adopt quality control measures and redesign its 
assembly line. 
  A good example of the changes implemented has been given by 
CBC Operations Director Marco Aurelio Salvany: Previously, as a 
result of the location of the assembly lines, the product 
sometimes had to "cover" nearly 1.5 km from one section of the 
plant to another. The new assembly line design places all the 
machinery required for the manufacture of a certain product in a 
much smaller area, so there is less loss of time and materials. 
The company also implemented a system that allows workers to 
suspend manufacture of a specific product when its stock reaches 
preestablished levels. 
  Barros explained: "Before the reorganization started, the 
company had as much as $12 million worth of completed products 
in stock. Currently, it only has $4 million worth in stock. 
Reduced financial costs resulting from the drop in the value of 
products in stock has, so far, paid for the reorganization 
process." To pay for the equipment that the company plans to 
purchase this year, the CBC consulted the National Bank for 
Economic and Social Development about the possibility of 
obtaining financing. 
  So far, the CBC reorganization program has not increased the 
company's profits. On the contrary, the company has been 
registering losses since 1991 and last year made a "symbolic" 
profit of a little more than $200,000. This was contemplated in 
the initial project but, as a result of the expected exports 
hike, prospects for this year are more favorable. Barros 
preferred not to reveal the profit expected for 1994. He said 
the results depend very much on factors that are very difficult 
to forecast, such as exchange rate behavior. 
  The company's reorganization program has significantly 
affected the routine of its employees. First because the number 
of employees was cut from 1,584 employees in November 1991 to 
the current 1,334. This number, however, is not expected to 
change dramatically in the next few months, not even after more 
modern equipment is purchased and parts are ordered from third 
parties. The projected increase in production will require the 
company to retrain employees that would have to be dismissed and 
to keep them on the payroll. 
  As frequently occurs in programs that seek to improve the 
quality of a company's products, the workers have become much 
more involved in the productive process. Often, the workers 
themselves suggest ways to improve the products. 
  Naturally, the implementation of quality control measures is 
not new to the company. As it produces arms and ammunition, the 
company has always been forced to adopt special precautions. 
The CBC must be particularly careful about these precautions 
because it not only manufactures arms and ammunition, it 
produces practically all the necessary components too. 
  The CBC is one of only two companies in the world that 
produces powder and ammunition at the same time. Normally, 
ammunition manufacturers purchase powder from other companies. 
To keep the powder and the starting mixture (a chemical mixture 
that makes powder explode when the trigger is pulled) production 
process safe and under control, the CBC has built the units that 
manufacture these two products far from the other buildings. 
The products are manufactured with a minimum number of 
employees. Most of the process is controlled from a distance 
through automated systems.

<F P=106> [Article by Ernesto Bernardes and Kaike Nanne: "Organized </F>
Brazil Works"; introductory paragraph in italics as published] 
  [Text] In a lesson on efficiency and citizenship, 
5,000 nongovernmental organizations [NGO's] show how to make the 
country come out right. 
  If President Itamar Franco had a ministry called NGO, it 
would be by far the most active one in his administration. Last 
week its representatives could be found, for example, in the 
forests of Mato Grosso teaching Indians how to identify the 
boundaries of their lands in the jungle using satellites. Or in 
Baixada Fluminense taking care of street children. Or in the 
Pernambuco countryside teaching lessons in anatomy to midwives 
and poor pregnant women. Or in the Pelourinho district of 
Salvador negotiating for the participation of blacks in the next 
film by American moviemaker Spike Lee. They would also be at 
FIESP [Sao Paulo State Federation of Industries] headquarters in 
Sao Paulo helping to improve the quality of industrial products. 
  It would be impossible for a ministry such as that to exist 
because NGO'S (nongovernmental organizations) are a type of 
organization that wants to keep its distance from the 
government. Scattered all over the country, organizations of 
that type are multiplying in crisis-ridden Brazil, where they 
devote themselves chiefly to ecological and humanitarian causes. 
According to the most recent survey, which was conducted two 
months ago, there are over 5,000 NGO's in the country, or twice 
as many as two years ago. Together they administer approximately 
$700 million per year, or more than the gross domestic product 
of four states: Acre, Roraima, Amapa, and Tocantins. 
  There are thousands of successful examples all over the 
country: 
  1. Wagner dos Santos, the key witness in the Candelaria 
massacre, in which seven street children were murdered by 
police, is still alive because he is under the protection of two 
of those organizations in Bahia. Santos believes that he would 
have been killed already without that paralegal protection. 
  2. The government spends an average of $550 per month to 
support each child in official agencies sheltering abandoned 
minors (FEBEM [State Child Welfare Foundation], for example). In 
Salvador, the Axe Project established by Italian attorney and 
educator Cesare de La Rocca, 55, spends a maximum of $50 per 
month to feed and educate each of the 2,747 children it has 
rescued from the streets in recent years. 
  3. In Santarem, Para, the Health and Happiness Foundation is 
succeeding in eliminating cholera and other diseases, such as 
schistosomiasis, that are caused by contaminated water. 
  4. While public education is falling apart, the Federation 
for the Organization of Social and Educational Assistance (FASE) 
in Rio de Janeiro operates literacy centers and rural schools in 
15 states, with total enrollment in the thousands.

  Crisis in utopia: Among Brazilian nongovernmental 
organizations, there is one that people would not be able to 
identify by its name: the Brazilian Institute of Social and 
Economic Analysis (IBASE). The name of that NGO says nothing, 
but its founder is more popular today than television's soap 
opera stars. In just a few months of preaching, sociologist 
Herbert de Souza, or "Betinho," has grabbed Brazil's attention 
with his national campaign against hunger, which is being 
directed from IBASE headquarters in Rio de Janeiro. "Betinho's" 
most impressive achievement has been to dramatize a problem to 
which Brazilians were no longer paying any attention. He has 
done so by arousing the impulses to solidarity that lie dormant 
in every citizen. 
  NGO's do a lot of their work following that pattern. In this 
end-of-the-century crisis in utopia, in which the major 
ideological currents have lost their power to grip people, the 
impulses for justice, equity, transformation, and progress have 
been channeled into thousands of very different tasks. No longer 
is there the aspiration to save the oppressed all over the 
world. The aim now, and the one preferred by NGO's, is to win 
victories that are small but capable of changing the life of the 
community in which they occur. "It is the segmentation of 
political participation," says scientist Bolivar Lamounier. In 
Rio de Janeiro, an NGO called the Brazilian Center for the 
Rights of Children and Adolescents provides sexual guidance for 
street kids, the object being to prevent the spread of sexually 
transmitted diseases. In Sao Paulo, the Black Woman's Institute 
supports musical rap groups. In Pernambuco, the Luiz Freire 
Center educates rural workers. Those are only a few examples of 
a network of organizations varying in size and complexity and 
involving the labor of 80,000 Brazilians. 
  "NGO's occupy the vacuum left by the crisis in ideologies 
and 
by the collapse of communism," says Deputy Carlos Minc (PT 
[Workers Party], Rio de Janeiro), who took up arms against the 
military regime in the 1970's and now devotes himself to the 
cause of ecology. A survey of representatives of 132 NGO's was 
conducted by the Higher Institute of Religious Studies (ISER) in 
Rio de Janeiro two years ago. It revealed that the great 
majority of the volunteers working in those organizations were 
former left-wing militants, like "Betinho" and Carlos Minc. One 
out of every six of those volunteers had been arrested for 
political activity under the military regime (see the table 
below). There is one area in which Brazilian NGO's are like 
those in the developed countries: they keep watch on the 
government and supplement government services. But they have one 
typically Brazilian feature. 
  Social maturity: Under the military regime, agencies such as 
the Brazilian Attorneys Association (OAB), the Brazilian Press 
Association (ABI), and the Brazilian Society for Scientific 
Development (SBPC) reflected the element of opinion opposed to 
the dictatorship. It was commonly said at the time that the OAB, 
the ABI, and the SBPC, along with other similar organizations, 
were "civil society." Today, attorney Jose Roberto Batochio's 
OAB is in the conservative trenches opposing constitutional 
revision, as is the venerable Barbosa Lima Sobrinho, president 
of the ABI, who is defending the petroleum monopoly. At best, 
the OAB, ABI, and SBPC represent only their professional 
members. At worst, they do not even represent that. Ask any 
group of lawyers what they think of constitutional revision. It 
is probable that most of them oppose the OAB's position.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  For decades in Brazil, and especially on the left, there 
prevailed the idea that the state was a powerful entity capable 
of doing everything. To solve the problems, according to that 
line of reasoning, it was necessary first to conquer the 
government. "The proliferation of civic bodies such as NGO's is 
proof that a healthy distrust of the state's powers exists in a 
society that is becoming increasingly willing to take on tasks 
once regarded as being the exclusive responsibility of the 
government," says sociologist Leoncio Martins Rodrigues, a 
professor at Campinas University. 
  Obviously, it is not being suggested that things would go 
better in Brazil if the state were removed from its basic 
functions and replaced in those tasks by unofficial units like 
the NGO's. What is being noted is the growth of the idea of 
citizenship. People are participating increasingly in the 
solution of collective problems not only in the area of 
environment but also in that of social welfare or the promotion 
of some idea considered worthy. That is the main significance of 
the growing network of NGO's now spreading throughout Brazil. 
"It is a genuine product of democracy," says political scientist 
Francisco Weffort. "It confirms the growing maturity of 
Brazilian society." 
  Domestic accident: Former members of left-wing groups make 
up 
the majority of the leaders of Brazilian NGO's, but many people 
have decided to join without having a Red past. Rio de Janeiro 
attorney Cristina Leonardo, 35, became interested as the result 
of a domestic accident. Cristina, who is married to an engineer, 
was a bank employee and an ordinary middle-class woman until 
four years ago. Things changed on the day when the manager of 
her building reported to police that Cristina's son and some 
other children had stolen a pizza delivered to the front office. 
The 11-year-old boy was taken to a police station, where his 
mother had to go pick him up. "When I got there, I was 
appalled," she says. "There were dozens of children who had been 
arrested for minor offenses and who were still in jail because 
there was no one to come get them out." Cristina then decided to 
help the children and is still doing so today. She has worked 
for three NGO's in the past and currently coordinates an 
organization that helps more than 700 street children. She works 
at it full-time. "Today I am a different person," she says. "I 
have discovered that it is possible to change things when you 
get involved." 
  Another interesting example of someone getting involved is a 
physician and professor named Camillo Vianna, pro-rector of the 
Federal University of Para. Now 67 years old, Vianna coordinates 
the Society for the Preservation of Amazon Region Natural and 
Cultural Resources (Sopren), whose list of achievements is as 
long as its name. In Abaetetuba, 50 km from Belem, that NGO 
teaches children to read and write. It provides vocational 
training in dressmaking for groups of women. It teaches 
backwoodsmen to plant species for use instead of mahogany in 
furniture-making and to grow other fast-growing trees for the 
production of charcoal. It maintains a botanical bank with over 
100,000 seedlings for reforestation and fruit growing. Vianna 
works miracles with an annual budget of $2,000. His projects 
have already benefited 200 families and have become such a 
well-known success that they have been visited by 49 foreign 
experts. An enthusiastic promoter of community movements, the 
doctor uses his own money to register small NGO's with the 
authorities. So far he has established 30. 
  Forest reserve: The growth of NGO's is a worldwide 
phenomenon. There are currently 785,000 such organizations in 
the United States. They handle $20 billion annually and involve 
from 10 to 20 percent of the population. There are 400,000 
organizations in Europe with an estimated annual budget of $10 
billion. Easy to establish, having a flexible chain of command, 
and free of all bureaucratic control, NGO's have a number of 
advantages over traditional institutions. "NGO's are a 
laboratory for ideas in society," says Jorge Eduardo Durao, 
president of the Brazilian Association of Nongovernmental 
Organizations. "They offer alternatives for development that 
neither the government nor traditional institutions can produce." 
  In the world of NGO's, there are individuals with 
fascinating 
histories. One example is businessman Roberto Klabin, commander 
of SOS Mata Atlantica, Brazil's largest environmental 
organization (3,000 members), and president of Dexie-Lalekla, 
which manufactures paper and plastic articles and bills $41 
million per year. When he was 15 years old, Klabin went hunting 
with his cousins on the family ranch in the Mato Grosso 
Lowlands. After many hours of walking, near a lagoon, the guide 
ordered them all to fire their rifles. "There are peccaries in 
there," he said. The gunshots brought down only one peccary: a 
pregnant female. "After that, there were no more hunting trips," 
says Klabin, 35. 
  The promise was taken seriously. The ranch on which Klabin 
took part in that hunting trip is now a private forest reserve 
covering 7,000 hectares. In that area, he has invested $2 
million to build the Caiman Ecological Refuge, the best-equipped 
hotel of its kind in Brazil, where foreign tourists, who make up 
most of its customers, are fascinated by the parade of wolves, 
coatis, deer, armadillos, anteaters, jaguars, and caimans and an 
infinite variety of bird species. Klabin devotes himself to 
ecological causes full-time. He is in the habit of going through 
the offices of friends and requesting money for SOS Mata 
Atlantica. He is almost always successful. Last year he raised 
$105,000 for the Conservationist Businessman project and $80,000 
for Lagamar (the restocking of oyster beds in Cananeia on the 
Sao Paulo coast). His family's business, Klabin Paper and 
Cellulose Industries--the industry's largest in Brazil--shared 
with Bradesco and Light Metal the $300,000 cost of satellite 
mapping the devastation of the Mata Atlantica. 
  Turtles: The growth of nongovernmental organizations on a 
worldwide scale is also the result of the planet's 
transformation into a global village. The collapse of 
ideological barriers and economic protectionism and the 
explosion in satellite communications have created a world 
without borders, the most visible result of which is public 
opinion that is international in character and interested in 
such topics as ecology, defense of the consumer, and minority 
rights. Nowadays, Brazilian blacks are in contact with the black 
movement in the United States and are directly influenced by it, 
while NGO's engaged in the most varied tasks receive financial 
help from their counterparts in the First World. 
  One proof that the world of NGO's has no borders is 
Englishwoman Cindy Morelli, a computer programmer in London. At 
the end of last year, she decided to pack her bags and head for 
Brazil after reading an advertisement in an ecology magazine. It 
was an appeal from the Tamar Project in Bahia, asking for 
volunteers to care for turtles on Forte Beach a few kilometers 
north of Salvador. "Every time I heard about some species of 
animal threatened with extinction, I would feel pain in my heart 
and want to help," the Englishwoman explained when she landed in 
Salvador on Christmas Eve. "This time I took courage and decided 
to act." 
  What followed was two weeks of hard work. During the day, 
she 
and five other foreigners tended the hundreds of baby turtles 
that were hatching and marked the females with metal tags. At 
night, they would return to the beach to guard the spots where 
turtles were laying eggs and protect the eggs from animals. Each 
of the volunteers, all recruited in different countries, paid 
$1,595 to spend that time with the turtles. Established by the 
Brazilian Institute for the Environment (Ibama), the Pro-Tamar 
Foundation became autonomous when it became an NGO, and it now 
administers an annual budget of $400,000. It is regarded as the 
world's largest project for the preservation of sea turtles, and 
it has already saved 1 million baby turtles along a 1,000-km 
strip of the Brazilian coast. 
  Richard Gere: Another sign of the internationalization of 
membership can be seen in the multinational networks of NGO's. 
The British organization Friends of the Earth, with offices in 
47 countries, has become a veritable United Nations of the 
environment. Greenpeace, which was established in Canada in the 
1970's, has 5 million members in 29 countries. The tentacles of 
those networks have a constant impact on worldwide public 
opinion. A good example is the cutting of mahogany trees in 
Brazil. For years, Brazilian ecologists had been protesting 
against exports of that kind of wood, such exports being 
responsible for the devastation of the tropical forest. No one 
ever paid the slightest attention to their protests until the 
Friends of the Earth organization put on a demonstration in 
front of Harrod's, the famous London department store where 
furniture made of mahogany extracted from the forests in 
southern Para was being sold. The British importers suspended 
their purchases of Brazilian wood. Concerned about its image, 
Harrod's hired actor Richard Gere to promote a campaign to 
gather funds for the Brazilian tropical forests during its 
annual pre-Christmas sale. 
  Richard Gere is the most recent in a gallery of famous 
patrons of Brazilian NGO's. As far as a great many artists, rock 
stars, aristocrats, and government authorities are concerned, 
there is no better marketing ploy than to have their image 
associated with defense of the capuchin monkey or the children 
starving on the streets of Brazil's big cities. Last week, model 
Bianca Jagger, the former wife of rock star Mick Jagger, was 
visiting Indian villages in Mato Grosso do Sul. She is the 
founder of the Amanaka organization, which defends Indian rights 
in South America. Part of the income from Paul McCartney's shows 
in Sao Paulo two months ago was donated to the Brazilian branch 
of Greenpeace. In November, two street children from Salvador 
had lunch with British Prime Minister John Major in London. 
Their trip to Great Britain was sponsored by the Ecumenical 
Service Coordinating Office (Cese), which represents six 
churches. 
  That explains something else about NGO's. They are one of 
the 
few pipelines for foreign money to have remained unobstructed in 
Brazil during the recession. It is estimated that $8 out of 
every $10 received by those organizations is a foreign donation. 
In a calculation made five years ago, the United Nations 
estimated that NGO's in the Southern Hemisphere received $6.5 
billion annually from international financial organizations, 
including government financial institutions. One-third of that 
money is donated by large NGO's headquartered in the rich 
countries to their affiliates or branches in the Southern 
Hemisphere. 
  "Corrupt": "In the rich countries, many people would rather 
give money to those organizations than to government 
organizations. It is known that funds turned over to governments 
may be embezzled by the corrupt or wasted by the incompetent," 
says Eduardo Martins, former president of Ibama and now 
president of the WWF [World Wildlife Fund] in Brazil. There is 
another reason for the financial success of those organizations. 
In almost every case they are faster and more effective than the 
government when it comes to getting things done. 
  An example of that in Brazil is the National Environment 
Plan 
(PNMA). Under that plan, the government was to have received 
loans totaling $133 million from the World Bank and Germany in 
1990. It, in turn, was to put up $33 million, making a total 
$166 million. The money was to be used to set up the structure 
for Ibama, establish nature reserves, and improve those already 
in existence. But there was a condition: the funds had to be 
used by July 1993. But because of a succession of administrative 
foul-ups and complications accompanying the changes of 
administration, they were not used. The end result was that 
instead of receiving money, our country had to pay a fine of 
$800,000 for violating its contract. If the money had been used 
efficiently, Brazil could have had 32 new national parks 
demarcated and equipped with all the necessary infrastructure by 
now. 
  Tired of losing money in the transfers of government funds 
intended for them, the two largest research centers in the 
Amazon Region, the INPA [National Institute for Amazon Region 
Research] in Manaus and the Goeldi Museum in Belem--both of them 
government institutions--decided to establish foundations to 
raise money abroad. The foundations are in fact NGO's and 
therefore not subject to control by the Union's bureaucracy. It 
is embarrassing for the Brazilian Government to have two 
official organizations forced to improvise a nongovernmental arm 
within their own structures in order to manage their funds 
better. "Before, the funds that arrived for us got held up in 
the Ministry of Finance," Jose Guilherme Maia, director of the 
Goeldi Museum, complains. "With the NGO, the money will be 
deposited directly in our account without passing through the 
government." 
  The size of some of those organizations in Brazil and the 
structures they have set up are surprising. The Brazilian 
Foundation for Nature Conservation (FBCN)--the oldest 
environmental NGO in Brazil, having been founded in 1958--has 
100 employees and an annual budget of $6 million. The Pro-Nature 
Foundation (Funatura), with headquarters in Brasilia, has an 
annual budget of $4 million. Gigantism sometimes leads NGO's to 
get involved in embarrassing situations. It was discovered in 
1991 that David McTaggart, president of Greenpeace, the most 
obstreperous ecologial organization on the planet, had done his 
own mother-in-law out of $3 million. It was also proven that he 
had staged scenes of cruelty to kangaroos for a documentary 
filmed in Australia to attract the attention of green militants. 
McTaggart ended up being fired. There are also complaints in 
Brazil about NGO's being involved in shady deals (see below). 
But those cases are the exception in a world where stories of 
solidarity predominate. It is precisely for that reason--the 
image of seriousness that NGO's convey---that they are winning 
more supporters every day. Unfortunately, it cannot be said that 
government organizations--Congress, for example--inspire the 
same confidence. 
<H5>  Global `Bee' </H5>
  Defining an NGO is as complicated as defining 
jazz--concerning which, as trumpet player Louis Armstrong said, 
"if you don't know what it is, explaining won't do any good." 
The name says that they are nongovernmental organizations, but 
does this mean that Volkswagen and Coca-Cola are also NGO's? No. 
NGO's are nonprofit organizations, a characteristic that 
excludes private firms. Also excluded from their number are 
union organizations such as the Sole Workers Union, corporative 
bodies such as the Brazilian Attorneys Association, and 
religious organizations such as the Catholic Church. So are 
political parties, since an NGO does not exist to contend for 
power. 
  The expression "NGO" was invented by the United Nations in 
the 1940's to designate unofficial organizations receiving 
financial help in carrying out projects of interest to groups or 
communities. Today it refers to groups as different as the 
International Association of Consumer Unions (IOCU), Amnesty 
International, and the Friends of the Earth, which is one of the 
biggest ecological organizations in the world with branches in 
47 countries. 
  Legionnaire for childhood: One of the most successful 
instances in Brazil is the Axe Project in Salvador. With an 
annual budget of $800,000, that NGO provides for 2,747 street 
children in the Bahia capital and is singled out by UNICEF as an 
example to the Third World. Its founder, Italian attorney and 
educator Cesare de La Rocca, 56, is a legionnaire when it comes 
to humanitarian causes. He was born in Florence and has lived in 
Brazil for 26 years. He has worked with children in Milan, 
Amazonas, and Rio de Janeiro. A bachelor, he is courting a 
UNICEF official who lives in New York and cares for children 
wounded in the war between Serbs and Croats. They manage to see 
each other twice a year at most. "It is a hard life, but I like 
what I'm doing," La Rocca says. The Axe Project, established in 
1989, is the result of an agreement between the Brazilian NGO 
known as the National Movement for Street Boys and Girls and the 
Italian International Cooperation Association New Land, with 
which La Rocca has had ties since the days when he lived in 
Italy. Among its big contributors are the United Nations, the 
International Labor Organization (ILO), and the European 
Economic Community. "We find it easy to obtain money abroad 
because our performance is exemplary," La Rocca says proudly. 
  Tourism for Gays: Starting an NGO is very simple. All you 
need to do is round up a certain number of partners, take the 
minutes of the first meeting, and register them with the 
authorities. Besides the environmental organizations, there are 
also so-called developmental NGO's, a category that includes La 
Rocca's Axe Project and thousands of tenants associations, 
community day nurseries and schools, and organizations for the 
defense of consumers, women, and minorities. The Nativity Native 
Foundation in Sao Paulo provides political training courses for 
workers. The Calabar Group in Salvador fights for the rights of 
a community descended from runaway slaves. There is also the 
Bahia Gay Group, which receives money from Canada with which to 
publish tourist guides for the homosexual public. NGO's are like 
capillary vessels. In the social fabric, there is no place where 
they do not appear. 
<H5>  Tale of the Adopted Trees </H5>
  Rio de Janeiro's tradition of scams includes as one of its 
oldest tricks that of selling Sugarloaf Mountain to people from 
Minas Gerais. Rascals later made a living selling the 
Rio-Niteroi Bridge. The deal now is to sell trees in the Amazon 
Region to foreigners. Anyone who knows the region knows that a 
safer investment is to buy a plot of land on the moon. Several 
NGO's are involved in that strange real estate venture. One of 
them is the International Ecological Club of the Amazon Region 
(CEIA) in Brussels, an NGO established by an Italian woman named 
Livia Gasbarra. The former owner of restaurants in Sao Paulo, 
Gasbarra now sells trees in the Capim River Valley in Para for 
$50 each. The buyer receives a certificate and pays another $50 
every year to maintain his or her pet tree. The trouble is that 
the CEIA is selling what it does not own. In the place indicated 
on the map sent to prospective buyers, there are no forests 
whatever belonging to the CEIA. "We are still going to plant the 
trees," the Italian woman claims. "That is why we are collecting 
funds." Gasbarra swears that she has sold 240 trees since 
October, 20 of them to members of the European Parliament. If 
she manages to sell 10,000 as planned, she will be billing over 
half a million dollars. 
  Mountain climbing in a palm tree: "I would never give money 
to one of those organizations," says Roberto Esmeraldi, 
Brazilian president of the NGO called Friends of the Earth. Such 
cases occur because there is no supervision of NGO activities. 
Being nonprofit organizations, they are exempt from taxes and 
any kind of supervision. That creates a problem. Stealing 
donations is as easy as collecting them. Actually, no one knows 
exactly how much enters and leaves the coffers of those 
organizations. "Here in Brazil, a citizen needs two dozen 
documents to open a tavern. To set up an NGO, he needs 
absolutely nothing, and no one is going to check up on him," 
says Denise Paiva, President Itamar Franco's adviser on the 
campaign against hunger. 
  Besides selling trees, Livia Gasbarra provides ecological 
tourist packages for foreigners at her NGO office in Para. The 
visitor pays $140 a week to stay in a thatched hut at a spot 15 
kilometers from the nearest settlement. All the food is canned. 
The guests this summer included mechanical engineer Benat 
Larronde, a 26-year-old Frenchman whose activities at the NGO 
included lessons in climbing a palm tree. Larronde loved the 
experience. "The Amazon Region should be made an international 
territory governed by the United Nations," he suggested before 
returning to France. 
  There are more serious complaints about NGO's. One of them 
involves the Xapuri Socio-Ecological and Cultural Foundation of 
Rio de Janeiro, whose honorary president is Prince Eudes de 
Orleans e Braganca. Although unheard of among environmentalists, 
it has taken in over $40 million since its establishment in 
1991. For more than a year, it was the Banorte Bank's biggest 
account in terms of average balances. An investigation by the 
Central Bank revealed that the organization, together with some 
pension funds operated by government-owned firms, had taken part 
in a ring-around-the-rosy involving deals with public bonds and 
made a profit of over $10 million. Nobody knows where that money 
ended up.

<F P=106> [Speech by Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina Gonzalez at </F>
opening ceremony of the Nation and Emigre Community Conference 
held at the Convention Center in Havana City on 22 April -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Moderator Sergio Corrieri] Good morning to all. The 
long-awaited time to begin this conference has arrived. On 
behalf of the committee in charge of preparing this conference, 
I wish to extend the warmest welcome to all. 
  First of all, I would like to introduce the people who are 
here with us: Comrade Carlos Lage [applause], secretary of the 
Council of Ministers Executive Committee; Comrade Roberto 
Robaina, minister of Foreign Relations [applause]; Ricardo 
Alarcon, president of the National Assembly of the People's 
Government [applause]; Abel Prieto, president of the National 
Union of Cuban Writers and Artists [applause]; Miguel Alfonso, 
who will be the spokesman for this conference; Jose Cabanas, the 
secretary [applause]; and myself, Sergio Corrieri, president of 
the Cuban Institute of Friendship with Peoples [applause], who 
will be the moderator of this conference. I would like to add 
that a group of personalities from various sectors of Cuban 
society are here as guests of the conference. We feel that these 
personalities, because of their work, their experience, or the 
nature of the posts they are holding, can be useful and suitable 
for the work we are doing. They will participate in this 
conference, and if they wish, will also be able to express their 
opinions on the subjects discussed here. 
  For the official opening of this meeting, we give the floor 
to Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina [applause]. 
  [Robaina] Guests of this conference, on behalf of the 
government, I wish to extend a warm welcome to all. 
  For those of us who for more than three decades have 
experienced pressures, threats, and aggressions, it is easy to 
understand the personal effort made by many and the merit of 
their decision not to allow themselves to be defeated by those 
who have threatened and applied pressure to prevent this meeting 
from taking place, nor by economic difficulties, the family, or 
other problems that have thwarted the attendance of many. 
  We interpret your presence here today as a demonstration of 
attachment to and identification with the Cuban nation. We must 
also stress the courage of our government in calling for this 
conference immersed as it is in the country's unavoidable 
mandatory tasks. We are facing difficult circumstances for 
guaranteeing our future, when the actions seeking to destroy the 
projects undertaken by our people for more than 30 years not 
only prevail, but are intensifying and multiplying. This 
conference is taking place under the same abnormal conditions 
that stemmed from the hostile U.S. policy against Cuba since the 
revolutionary victory, conditions that have marked Cuban 
relations with the emigre community. 
  The fact that we are here today in this room is not even 
remotely the result of a miracle or accident. It is above all 
the result of our maturity, strength, and independence, and also 
the result of a growing attitude of respect and understanding of 
a significant portion of the emigre community who identifies 
more each day with the vital interests of Cuba. 
  You have arrived in Cuba in the midst of an exceptional 
period, when our people are making extraordinary efforts to 
heroically preserve the fatherland's independence and, and the 
gigantic accomplishments of the Revolution. If we commit to this 
conference, it is because the subject deserves to see the 
beginning of a joint discussion aimed at making progress along 
the road to normalize ties between the nation and its emigre 
community. 
  As expected, the call for this conference has prompted mixed 
reactions. The name, and the seriousness of our intentions have 
been criticized. There were even those who expressed doubts that 
this conference would take place, without mentioning those who 
by all means tried to prevent it, thwart it, or frustrate it. Of 
course, there were also those who, knowing us better, realized 
from the very beginning that this endeavor was feasible, and 
supported it. Many people of goodwill have joined them in this 
task and they jointly managed to clean up the stains to 
appreciate the light. 
  This conference has also become a reality because of the 
resoluteness and persistence of many who are present here, and 
of others who for different reasons are not present here today. 
Many have participated in this effort to achieve rapprochement, 
some silently, others openly. There are those who have been 
dedicated to this task for many difficult years, while others 
joined only recently. In spite of everything, various 
initiatives and contacts have been promoted, and several actions 
have been carried out. 
  We are finally here to begin the meeting in accordance with 
the call made on 14 February 1994. The objectives have been 
established, but it would not hurt to repeat them here today. 
They are: to study possible measures to normalize relations 
between emigres and the nation, between institutions and the 
family; to promote stable exchange in the cultural, family, and 
social areas; to foment constructive actions of residents 
abroad, taking into account the current historical situation in 
which the country's destiny, the preservation of its sovereignty 
and independence, as well as the achievements of the people, 
represent a common platform for all Cubans of good will. 
  We must therefore jointly identify those areas in which, 
through the participation of all, we can progress toward the 
establishment of normal relations to which we all have the right. 
  Some have questioned the use of the word emigration in our 
call. You may interpret this, as some of you have already done 
publicly, and as is our intention, as referring strictly to 
those who live outside the fatherland. 
  The participation in and representation at this meeting has 
also been questioned. The data can speak for itself. Here we 
have with us 204 emigres, residents of 27 countries. This number 
is increasing as the hours pass. Among them we can find 
professionals in various areas -- journalists, artists, writers, 
housewives, retired people, workers, employees, businessmen, 
teachers, social workers, religious people, and students. 
Moreover, we all know that the various political and ideological 
trends are represented at this conference, which does not 
prevent our willingness to work for the objective that has 
brought us together here today. 
  This conference is the continuation of difficult, complex 
work that has been carried out over a long period. The first 
important result is the conference itself and the possibilities 
it offers to go on. The respect and intelligence with which we 
are to discuss each of the subjects that are worrying us within 
the nation-emigres conference, must characterize our current 
dialogue, and must represent essential premises for the future. 
  It would be too ambitious to pretend that in only three days 
we will be able to resolve all existing problems, when some of 
the essential ones do not depend exclusively on us. The 
important thing is to keep up this common effort. 
  With that spirit, let us begin then the work of our 
conference. Thank you very much. [applause]

  [Text] Cuban Foreign Relations Minister Roberto Robaina 
gave a detailed explanation of the Cuban Government's criteria 
regarding Cuban emigres during the second day of The Nation and 
the Emigrants Conference, at which this topic, considered the 
meeting's main subject, was analyzed. 
  The minister explained that the overall perception of the 
Cuban community abroad has changed. He stressed that current 
migration laws respond to the need to protect Cuba, thus the 
political rights of Cubans living in Cuba cannot be the same as 
those who live abroad. 
  Conference spokesman Miguel Alfonso told the press that 
talks 
between the official Cuban representatives and the 215 guests 
are proceeding in an atmosphere of respect and are characterized 
by an absence of confrontation. 
  Cuban visitors, most of whom are U.S. residents, requested 
certain changes to the visa system, the creation of an official 
organization to handle their affairs, and the opening of several 
consulates in the United States. They also asked that their 
children be allowed to study in Cuba. 
  The Nation and the Emigrants Conference was convened by the 
Cuban Government and is being held at the Havana Convention 
Center with the participation of Cubans who reside in 27 
different countries.

<F P=106> [Report by journalist Roberto Cavada at the Convention </F>
Center in Havana on 22 April -- live or recorded] 
  [Text] The deliberations at the conference, "The Nation and 
the Emigre Community," which began this morning at the 
Convention Center, are still under way. During a recess just a 
few moments ago, conference spokesman Miguel Alfonso held a 
briefing [preceding word in English] on the first day's work. 
  During this first day, the conference heard a speech by 
Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada, president of Cuba's parliament, on 
Cuba's current political institutions. Later, Abel Prieto, 
president of the National Union of Cuban Writers and Artists, 
made a speech. Prieto commented on the culture, on being Cuban, 
and on things Cuban [la cultura, cubanidad, y cubania], a topic 
that is at this very moment being discussed behind closed doors. 
  About the discussions that took place following the 
lecturers' speeches, spokesman Alfonso stressed to the press: 
  [Begin Alfonso recording] I would like to point out here 
something I think is important for you to know about: the tone 
of respect and high-mindedness of that discussion. I think that 
discussion was really -- and I have a certain amount of 
parliamentary experience on which to base what I am going to say 
-- exemplary as to civility and depth of ideas. It could best be 
described as a discussion characterized by mutual respect, with 
everyone who spoke there expressing his opinion freely. A number 
of questions that are for the first time -- at least as far as I 
know -- being discussed, were spoken about in a totally open and 
frank manner. The climate was extremely relaxed, respectful, and 
of high quality regarding both the level of ideas and the 
nobility of aims. 
  As far as I am concerned, in my opinion, it is an excellent 
beginning to this conference. [end recording] 
  Miguel Alfonso confirmed that nine Cubans spoke during the 
morning -- Cubans who, among other topics, brought up the 
possibility of maintaining a Cuban identity despite the fact 
that one lives outside Cuba and who expressed concern over 
certain problems of corruption that might be brought about by 
the economic changes being made in Cuba. 
  According to Alfonso, the speakers said that the U.S. 
blockade is the key element for understanding the current 
situation on the island and the need to eradicate that blockade. 
Lastly, they urged the Cubans inside Cuba to understand the 
emigres; and the emigres, in turn, advocated not forgetting the 
Cubans on the island. 
  Last, Miguel Alfonso brought the list of participants up to 
date. There are already 210 emigres on that list, among them 156 
who live in the United States, who approved drawing up an 
official directory of the conference, but with a private 
character, to be circulated only among the participants and the 
secretariat [not further identified]. 
  That is all we have right now, Cesar. In just a few moments, 
journalist Maria Elena Alonso will make a collage of the 
participants' impressions during this first day of work, and 
Zenaida Costales will present an exclusive interview with one of 
those exiled in the United States. 
  Roberto Cavada wishes you a good evening, Cubans.

  [Excerpt] The conference entitled the Nation and the Emigre 
Community continues today with an analysis of the matter of 
current relations and prospects between the nation and the Cuban 
community abroad. This topic was addressed by Cuban Foreign 
Minister Roberto Robaina. Here is a report on this morning's 
session by journalists Zenaida Costales, Maria Elena Alonso, and 
Orlando Contreras [as heard]: 
  [Begin Contreras recording] Upon talking this morning about 
emigration problems, their origin, the nature of this 
conference, and the desire to pursue work jointly with the 
emigre community in order to normalize relations, Foreign 
Minister Roberto Robaina said that Cuba realizes the time has 
come for consular facilities to exist not only in Washington, 
and that the U.S. authorities are aware of this opinion. 
  Robaina said he felt it was necessary to give this 
conference 
some continuity, and also said he feels that the diversity of 
ideas within the emigre community should not constitute an 
obstacle to continuing this work. 
  The foreign minister said: Cuba is not giving up on the 
emigres, and the emigres are not giving up on the fatherland. 
Robaina explained: The society summoning them is not a bankrupt 
society, and added that all the proposals being presented at 
this meeting will be studied. 
  The foreign minister summed up the history of Cuban 
emigration, the historical circumstances surrounding it, and its 
nuances -- from Heredia to Wilfredo Lam -- and the 
(?fundamental) differences that exist between the emigre 
community in favor of annexation, and that part of the community 
that demands that the nation's sovereignty, history, and culture 
remain intact and linked to its projected future, both inside 
the United States and in other countries. 
  Robaina's words led to a discussion that, like the first 
day's, unfolded within a framework of respect and a willingness 
to seek feasible solutions, the culmination of which obviously 
overflows the framework of this conference of only three working 
days. 
  However, to judge by the statements of emigres, problem 
areas 
and possible solutions are being identified; and areas for 
concrete proposals by the emigre community to the nation -- 
topics such as the emigres' entry into and exit from Cuba; the 
positive tone of the change in perceptions of an important part 
of the emigre community, also linked to the nation's 
understanding toward those Cubans; and other specific matters. 
Just a few moments ago, conference spokesman Miguel Alfonso gave 
a briefing [preceding word in English] on this morning's work.

  [Text] Various news media throughout the world are closely 
following the development of the The Nation and Emigre Community 
Conference. One of these media is the NBC television network, 
which released the following report: 
  [Begin recording] [unidentified reporter] In an interview 
with the NBC network yesterday afternoon, [Politburo member] 
Abel Prieto referred to the conference: 
  [Prieto, in progress] ...and I do not think any emigre has 
come with that intention. I think they have come with great 
respect, and this morning they were listening and discussing the 
Cuban political system; in the afternoon we discussed culture. I 
believe there are many paths and bridges that can be opened 
through cultural activities. 
  [Reporter] Prieto also explained the administrative 
reorganization that is being carried out on the island. 
  [Prieto] For a long time now we have been making 
adjustments. 
We are working on some reforms to streamline the country's 
finances. 
  [Reporter] Some people abroad are asking when democratic 
elections will be held in the country, but according to Prieto, 
this main discussion should focus more on the definition of 
democracy. 
  [Prieto] According to our Constitution, the president is 
elected indirectly. He is elected by the parliament, the members 
of which are directly elected by the people. I think we must 
review the ideas on democracy that have been so often repeated 
concerning Cuba. I think the people who have freedom of thought 
must study the Cuban experience. It is an interesting 
experience, and I think we should go a little more deeply into 
it. The problem is that there are many stereotypes on this 
matter and democracy is taken as synonymous with a specific 
model, which we need to review to see just how democratic it 
really is. I think democracy is a dream that is still far 
removed from men. This is my personal opinion on this matter. 
  [Reporter] Prieto also referred to the U.S. blockade against 
Cuba meant to force Fidel Castro's departure from the 
presidency. Referring to this situation, Prieto used a baseball 
analogy. 
  [Prieto] The pitcher is removed only when the team decides 
he 
is no longer suitable. In this case there was a Cuban poet, who 
has unfortunately already passed away, but when we were asked 
from abroad to replace Fidel, this poet used to say that this is 
the first time that the opposite team has asked us to remove our 
pitcher. 
  [Reporter] According to Prieto, the embargo against Cuba 
violates the human rights of millions of Cubans. [end recording]

  [Text] Havana, 24 Apr (AFP) -- The Cuban Government will 
create a special department within the Foreign Ministry for 
emigrants. This was announced on Saturday by Foreign Minister 
Roberto Robaina to the 215 Cuban emigrants who are participating 
in "The Nation and the Emigrants" conference. Robaina also 
mentioned five additional decisions made by the government in an 
attempt to make more flexible the relations with a large number 
of emigrants, excluding the sector described as "aggressive." 
  However, participants at the conference who were asked to 
comment on this today said that the six measures announced by 
Robaina are not enough. 
  The decisions announced by Robaina are: 
  -- The creation of a special department for emigrants 
within the Foreign Ministry. 
  -- The lowering, from five to one year, the time between 
visits of emigrants who left the country "legally" and who wish 
to return to visit their family. 
  -- The elimination of the order that during the emigrants 
visit to the country they must stay in a hotel for Cubans 
residing abroad. 
  -- Allowing a "small" group of Cuban youths who reside 
abroad to attend the university in Cuba. 
  -- To put out a magazine for emigrants. 
  -- To give continuity to the contact the government 
resumed with the emigrants through this conference. 
  It was not clear whether among the Cubans who left the 
country "legally" the government is including those who left the 
country for a short visit abroad and once there decided to stay. 
Meanwhile, even though the required five-year term between 
visits for those who left the country "legally" has been lowered 
to one year, the request for a visa continues to be obligatory. 
  In the hallways of the Comodoro Hotel where those attending 
the conference are staying, the comments on the decisions 
announced was less than enthusiastic. "It is all right...for 
starters," a businessman with commercial ties to Cuba said. 
Another participant, who is visiting the island for the first 
time since 1989, described the decisions as "a little less than 
nothing." A third participant described the decisions as "candy 
in the middle of a party that should have better prizes at the 
end." 
  Attending the conference are well-known Cuban emigrants most 
of whom reside in the United States and who peacefully and 
"constructively" oppose the Castro government, and others who 
openly support the system. 
  In private, several of the opposers expressed their concern 
regarding an eventual "return with empty hands" to Miami and 
other U.S. cities where groups of active anti-Castro emigrants 
have accused them of being "traitors" because they went to Cuba.

  [Excerpts] Havana, 23 Apr (AFP) -- A meeting between the 
Cuban Government and 215 moderate Cuban opposition 
representatives living abroad -- mostly in the United States -- 
will conclude tomorrow in Havana with modest results. 
  The government organized the "The Nation and the Emigrants 
Conference" and limited its goals to the following: To begin 
changing ideas in order to reach an eventual normalization of 
relations between Cuba and Cubans living abroad. 
  Cubans who call for the armed overthrow of Castro and who 
support the U.S. trade, economic, and financial embargo against 
Cuba that has been in effect since 1962 were excluded from the 
meeting. 
  Participants include prominent Cuban emigrants who in some 
cases have expressed subtle sympathy for the Castro Government, 
and others who in the past have raised weapons against the 
regime but now call for a peaceful dialogue. 
  This afternoon participants agreed that the conference will 
yield modest results, which they consider the initial gambit in 
a long game. 
  As of this afternoon, President Fidel Castro had not 
attended 
the conference, which opened on 22 April with a speech by 
Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina. [passage omitted] 
  Carlos Lage, secretary of the Council of Ministers and 
member 
of the Communist Party Politburo, will address the conference on 
Sunday, the last day of the meeting. 
  According to the agenda, a "comment period" is scheduled 
following each speech, but according to several participants, 
the time set aside for dialogue has thus far been, with few 
exceptions, rather sedate. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Carlos Lage, secretary of the Executive Committee of 
the Council of Ministers, presented to participants of the 
Nation and the Emigre Community Conference an analysis on the 
current situation of the economy, and its prospects. Lage's 
presentation brought about an exchange of ideas by Cuban 
authorities and the more than 200 residents from abroad who are 
attending the forum. 
  The Nation and the Emigre Community Conference will conclude 
today at 2030 GMT and according to Miguel Alfonso, spokesman for 
the conference, the debate has retained an elevated tone of 
respect. Especially notable was the positive attitude toward the 
fatherland. 
  The meeting was inaugurated on Friday with speeches by 
Ricardo Alarcon and Abel Prieto, presidents of the National 
Assembly of the People's Government and the National Union of 
Cuban Writers and Artists, respectively, and by Cuban Foreign 
Minister Roberto Robaina. 
  Among the decisions adopted during the conference with the 
emigre community were: continuation of contacts and exchanges to 
promote the normalization of relations, creation of an office to 
take care of emigration issues, and creation of a specialized 
magazine for that sector. The elimination of the five-year 
waiting period for those who abandoned the country to legally 
return, and abolition of the requirement for them to obtain 
reservations in hotels, were other measures discussed. 
  Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina also informed 
participants at the conference of the government's willingness 
to facilitate cultural links reaffirming their Cuban nature. 
  The meeting was devised by our country in an attempt to 
identify common problems between the nation and the emigre 
community and to promote solutions to those problems.

  [Excerpt] The Nation and the Emigre Community Conference 
concluded today at the Convention Center in Havana. The 
conference closed its doors, but opened doors to ties between 
Cuba and its children abroad. The closing remarks were by 
Politburo member Jose Ramon Balaguer: 
  [Begin Balaguer recording] We conclude the Nation and the 
Emigre Community Conference with great satisfaction and the 
natural uncertainty of those who begin a new path. Beginning our 
journey down a new road is precisely what we have been doing 
here these past three days. [end recording] 
  The meeting that was called by the Cuban Government 
continues 
a process which began in 1978 and that did not conclude with 
just words. Regarding this conference, Politburo member Carlos 
Lage said: 
  [Begin Lage recording] These meetings were held in an 
atmosphere of respect. I believe these meetings have been useful 
and positive and that they will not end here, but will continue. 
  I believe we can expect many things. Just yesterday we 
announced some measures we had been analyzing. There may be many 
openings, but the reality of our relations with the emigre 
community is facing a difficult obstacle, an obstacle that 
cannot be ignored: the U.S. blockade against Cuba. [end 
recording] 
  The hosts announced several measures that will contribute to 
advancing this identification between the two sides of the Cuban 
culture. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Commentary by PRENSA LATINA reporter Nicanor Leon Cotayo </F>
from the "Evening Information Review" newscast] 
  [Text] The effects of the U.S. blockade on Cuba reared 
their heads in a particularly harsh fashion in the first months 
of 1994. Contrary to what happened over the previous three 
years, several effects of the siege have landed simultaneous 
blows on the Cuban people, particularly hurting their food 
supply and some areas of the public health system. It is 
important to recall that since 6 July 1960, almost 34 years ago, 
the U.S. Government has stopped buying sugar from the island. 
One of the main objectives of the blockade was to try to curb 
as much as possible the inflow of foreign financial resources 
essential to Havana in its efforts to keep its economy afloat 
and meet the basic needs of Cubans. 
  Last year, because of limited exchange opportunities; 
because 
of the lack of imports required by the sugar harvest -- oil, for 
instance; and because of bad whether, Cuban sugar production, 
still a key component in the national economy, fell to just more 
than 4 million tons, which is much lower than the 7 million tons 
produced during the previous harvest. This drastic drop in 
production not only caused the country to stop receiving more 
than $400 million a year amid an already difficult situation, 
but it also created difficulties in distributing sugar among the 
people, who were already facing many other difficulties in the 
January-March period in terms of delivery dates, although, 
ultimately, distribution was achieved as planned. 
  The lack of raw materials affected not only the sugar 
industry, but also the agriculture sector in which tuber and 
vegetable production declined. The shortage of agricultural 
produce was highly visible in terms of the supply of these 
products in this period. If these examples, among others, are 
combined with the trade transactions with other countries which 
Washington's embassies and special services have tried to wreck 
-- for example, the purchase of Asian cooking oil to meet 
first-quarter needs -- then we get a sad idea of what is going 
on in this Caribbean country. Should we want to expand on this a 
bit more, we would have to remember the painful path travelled 
by Cuba in Latin America to buy powdered milk for newborn 
babies, because suppliers feared White House retaliation or 
because some ships dropped their loads in ports of other 
Caribbean nations. If those ships had docked in Cuban ports 
with the powdered milk on board, they could be severely 
penalized upon their arrival in U.S. ports because of provisions 
in the Torricelli Law. 
  Some day, when details of how Cuban life was affected by the 
U.S. blockade, and when the information blockade and distortions 
no longer cloud the island's achievements, reality will easily 
win out over fantasy. Meanwhile, Cuba shows no signs of 
surrendering; although life goes on very much affected by 
difficulties primarily caused by the blockade, we are 
maintaining the ironhanded notion of not sacrificing our 
national freedom.

  [Text] Colonel Kim Hwi-paek, military attache of the DPRK 
Embassy in Cuba, held a news conference on the occasion of the 
upcoming commemoration, on 25 April, of the 62d anniversary of 
the creation of the DPRK Army. The diplomat stressed the efforts 
conducted in the last 62 years to develop and strengthen the 
Armed Forces of the DPRK, which resulted in victorious outcomes 
in two wars. The official affirmed that today the army, with a 
high degree of technology, defends the cause of revolution and 
socialism. 
  [Begin Kim recording] Our People's Army has experienced 
guerrilla and conventional warfare since its creation. These 
arduous and long struggles resulted in valuable combat 
experience. Our People's Army is also contributing significantly 
to building a socialist economy. Many commemorative projects 
have been erected by our army in the DPRK. [end recording] 
  Colonel Kim Hwi-paek pointed out that the People's Army is 
currently engaged in increasing its combat readiness in the face 
of threatening actions by the United States and South Korea, 
which have used the issue of the alleged production of nuclear 
weapons to deploy missiles and conduct military exercises. 
  [Begin Kim recording] We have no need to produce nuclear 
weapons in the DPRK. Our nuclear efforts are only aimed at 
developing the socialist economy and nuclear energy is being 
used only for peaceful purposes. [end recording] 
  The Korean official spoke of the tense situation in the 
Korean peninsula arising from the U.S. attitude and pointed out 
that his government is as ready for talks as for war.

  [Text] At the instigation of the Cuban Workers Federation, 
CTC, the Council of State presented the Order of Lazaro Pena, 
First Degree, to Louis Vianet, secretary general of the General 
Confederation of Labor, CGT, and a member of the Politburo of 
the French Communist Party. As an expression of the 
acknowledgement by Cuba's workers and people of his 
contributions within the CGT toward friendship and solidarity 
with the Cuban Revolution, said Pedro Ross Leal, member of the 
Politburo of the Communist Party of Cuba and secretary general 
of the CTC, may this order be proof of our friendship and our 
respect. 
  This morning, Vianet and the delegation of French labor 
leaders accompanying him toured economic centers in Guines 
Municipality, Havana Province. At the Blas Roca Calderio UBPC 
[Basic Cooperative Production Unit], they donated 120,000 francs 
to the needs of Cuba's workers. With the check, they presented 
the CGT emblem, explaining that its two hands represent unity, 
also, in the French and Cuban workers' struggle against the 
Yankee blockade. 
  The delegation attended the ceremony on Lenin Hill in Regla 
Municipality, Havana City Province, on the occasion of the 
anniversary of Lenin's birth -- the first ceremony to be held in 
the city of Havana in commemoration of 1 May. 
  Vianet is at this moment holding a news conference on the 
situation of workers in France and on the international workers 
movement.

<F P=106> ["Our Opinion" commentary by Orlando Contreras] </F>
  [Text] The Council of State decree published in GRANMA 
responds to Cuba's current and future needs. It is basically a 
matter of having the necessary ministries and organizations and 
eliminating superfluity from the administrative apparatus. What 
was adopted, following an analysis of our realities, is what is 
needed today in a sovereign decision that reflects the people's 
political and technical will. What is sought with this measure, 
in short, is to begin to shape a more agile, operational, 
expedient, and skilled central state administration. 
  This measure has nothing to do with prevailing neoliberal 
guidelines that ask Third World countries to cannibalize the 
state to benefit an idyllically conceived and managed free 
enterprise supposedly beyond class interests, multinationals, 
and global hegemonic hubs of power. 
  The goal of the reorganization of our central administrative 
bodies is to improve the operation of a state which responds to 
the interests of the majority with a clear and specific 
understanding of the interests it serves, which are none other 
than those of the working people. It is obvious that if one of 
the basic priorities of the specific reality we face is to 
stimulate the economy and boost efficiency, the Ministries of 
Economy and Planning and of Finances and Prices have to absorb 
certain organizations and institutions linked to those priority 
activities. 
  The same is happening with another priority activity of our 
economy, tourism. If, because of current circumstances and in an 
irreversible manner, we have to rely on foreign investment under 
the conditions established by the Cuban state, including 
economic cooperation, this endeavor has to have a dynamic and 
efficient ministry to steer this effort. 
  In essence, the reorganization of the bodies of the state's 
central administration is a measure which responds to the 
demands of today's reality, the needs we have to face in the 
special period in a world we cannot change and into which we 
have to incorporate ourselves in terms of trade, finance, and 
certain economic relations, without relinquishing our cardinal 
principles and the altruistic goals of our sociopolitical 
project.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Unidentified announcer] After 
hearing a detailed report by Colonel Jose Ramon Jimenez, head of 
the General Staff of the Defense Council in Las Tunas, on the 
characteristics of the project, Army General Raul Castro, 
minister of the Revolutionary Armed Forces, toured areas of the 
new installation. He was accompanied by Commander of the 
Revolution Juan Almeida Bosque and Division General Ramon 
Espinosa Martin, head of the Eastern Army. 
  After completing his tour of the facilities, the second 
secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of 
Cuba highlighted the significance of the development of fish 
farming in our country and its contribution to the nutrition of 
the people. 
  [Castro] On a water tank not far from here, there is a sign 
that reads: Under our conditions of the special period, beans 
are as valuable as cannon. This is a statement I once made and 
later rectified by saying: At this moment, beans are more 
valuable than cannon. Today, as many of you saw, I used a marker 
to add to the sign: and fish farming, which is the most 
inexpensive way of obtaining a magnificent source of protein for 
our people and our Armed Forces. I hope the Eastern Army, as in 
other activities, will be the vanguard in fish farming and in 
fraternal emulation among Army units. 
  [Unidentified announcer] Gen. Raul Castro once again took 
advantage of the opportunity to congratulate the Eastern Army on 
the occasion of its 33d anniversary. 
  [Castro] Here in Las Tunas, in this very regiment, and with 
the inauguration of this important fish farming center, on my 
behalf and on behalf of my companions Commander of the 
Revolution Juan Almeida Bosque, Ramon Espinosa, head of the 
Eastern Army, and of the commander in chief, once again I 
congratulate the Eastern Army. [passage omitted]

    [Editorial Report] Havana Radio Rebelde Network in Spanish 
at 1155 GMT on 22 April carries an eight-minute interview with 
Agustin Lopez Gomez, secretary general of the Communications 
Workers Union, by Radio Rebelde General Manager Bienvenido Rojas. 
  Lopez points out that as a result of the workers' assemblies 
process, there is an increased awareness among workers of the 
importance of maintenance, given the age and origin of the 
equipment. Maintenance is necesesary to minimize technical 
difficulties and improve service. 
  Lopez adds that the work is extensive and improvement is not 
readily seen. With regard to ties with foreign companies, Lopez 
states: "We understand that the government is making some type 
of effort on this. However, we are working to reshape the 
managerial organization of the communications systems. We have 
begun by reorganizing the National Telephone Service: in other 
words, the creation of a national enterprise, which is to be 
followed by the same with the postal, telegraph, radio, and 
television systems." 
  Lopez adds: "The telephone system was fragmented into about 
15 enterprises, and now there is only one, at the national 
level."

<F P=106> [Commentary by Miguel Angel de la Guardia; from the "Evening </F>
Information Review" newscast] 
  [Text] The first report on the achievements of oil 
production has already been issued with the end of the first 
quarter of 1994, a quarter that marked the beginning of a 
special period. The report indicated that oil production 
exceeded forecasts by 12 percent; that is, crude oil production 
reached more than 300,000 tons. Now, eyes are turning toward 
the country's main industry, namely the sugar industry, which 
was surrounded by a high-pitched campaign to exceed last year's 
output, which is comparable to the output of 1944, when sugar 
was sold at two and one-half cents per pound. 
  Last year, the revolutionary government set out to 
significantly increase sugar production, which was already set 
at more than 6 million tons annually. Sugar production amounted 
to 4.2 million tons in 1993. The country expects to produce at 
least 100,000 to 200,000 tons more this year, which is a very 
difficult task because of the very adverse condition of the 
industry, which has been affected by an acute lack of 
fertilizers, transportation, fuels, and herbicides -- usually 
sprayed in a short period of time thanks to agricultural 
aviation. 
  The tasks so far accomplished in the industry, due to the 
overwhelming support of its workers and reserves, were truly 
heroic, especially when we take into consideration that 
mechanical sugar harvesters were affected by the aforementioned 
situation. The legendary brigades of sugarcane cutters 
[macheteros], who filled Cuban fields with routine deeds as 
though they were a true fighting army, are currently fused to 
the ground, fighting, machete in hand, with the same patriotic 
fervor displayed by our founding fathers last century. 
  The Cuban people and government are relying on these men, 
because they inspired admiration in many previous harvest 
seasons. We are also relying on the men of the sugar industry, 
those who operate and maintain sugar mill equipment and those 
who work in the laboratories and offices, who are also doing the 
best they can. This harvest battle has the connotation of a 
memorable campaign within the great epic that the Cuban people 
are staging at the most decisive time of their beautiful 
history. In its determination to accomplish production goals 
and to surpass them as much as possible, the Cuban Sugar 
Industry Ministry announced that the harvest season will last a 
little bit longer this year; it will be extended until late May. 
  In addition, some sugar mills will continue to operate until 
June at the latest. After that date, sugarcane production 
plummets so much that it is a mistake to sacrifice sugar fields 
that can continue to yield crops to ensure that they will yield 
more next year. The preparatory tasks for the next sugarcane 
harvest started earlier this year. We can guarantee that in 
1995 production in this vital Cuban industry will continue to 
increase.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
fileworthy reports on economic developments carried on Havana 
radio and television in Spanish between 14 and 22 April. 
  Radio Reloj at 1930 GMT on 14 April reports that the El 
Cobre 
quarry has produced over 670 tons of product for export, out of 
a planned 500 tons for the first quarter of 1993. El Cobre is 
expected to meet its annual goal of 1,800 tons since the 
copper-processing plant underwent extensive maintenance. 
  Reloj adds at 1940 GMT that Villa Clara Province has taken 
in 
500,000 pesos in self-employment license fees. 
  Radio Rebelde at 0900 GMT on 15 April reports that this year 
approximately 2,000 rooms in 15 installations dedicated to 
international tourism will receive furniture worth more than $7 
million produced by the light industry union. This contribution 
will be supplemented by mattresses and lamps, which used to be 
purchased abroad. The furniture factory commitment this year is 
aimed at refurbishing the (Cohiba), Habana Libre, Guitart, and 
El Viejo y el Mar hotels in Havana. The Cayo Guillermo Cabin in 
Ciego de Avila and the Cuatro Vientos in Camaguey will also 
receive furniture. Despite material limitations, this Ministry 
of Light Industry factory produced 42,000 units last year to 
furnish other important centers; the plant is also operating 
jointly with Dominican capital to produce wicker furniture for 
Cubanacan. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1700 GMT on 15 April reports that in order 
to conduct a vaccination campaign, the city of Buenos Aires, 
Argentina, has purchased 500,000 doses of the meningitis vaccine 
made by the Finlay Institute. 
  Tele Rebelde and Cuba Vision at 0000 GMT on 16 April report 
that members of the Lazaro Pena contingent in Havana salute 
workers day. In the past harvest, this contingent was able to do 
only 25 percent of its task, because of damages caused by the 
storm of the century. One year later they were able to harvest 
56 caballerias of tobacco. According to specialists, this has 
been a good year for crops and the workers have responded with 
discipline and dedication. 
  Radio Rebelde at 2300 GMT on 15 April reports that 
Venezuelan 
travel groups will bring more than 9,000 people to Cuba this 
year. According to company officials, this is a 20-percent 
increase over 1993. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1155 GMT on 18 April reports that national 
egg production in the first quarter of 1994 was 130 million. 
  Radio Rebelde at 0900 GMT on 18 April reports that in 
Matanzas Province 500 tons of jute fiber have been processed 
during the first quarter of 1994 -- 100 tons more than in the 
first quarter of 1993. Jute planting at the Eladio Hernandez 
Leon Complex is behind schedule because of a work force deficit. 
  Radio Reloj at 1930 GMT on 18 April reports that volunteer 
cane cutters from the Cuban Workers Federation have fulfilled 
their objectives during the current harvest and that they will 
remain in the fields until the conclusion of operations in 
Camaguey. The Jesus Suarez Gallol column, which groups these 
volunteers, has cut 57 million arrobas of cane since the 
beginning of the harvest. This column, with a brigade of 
approximately 3,000 volunteers, is organized in 92 groups. After 
Havana, Camaguey is the second province in the country declared 
to have a millionaire status in manual cutting of sugarcane. 
  Radio Rebelde at 2300 GMT on 20 April reports that Santiago 
de Cuba has received directly from Malaga, Spain, a donation 
from the Jose Marti solidarity group consisting of more than two 
tons of diverse medical supplies and equipment, as well as a 
donation of industrial oil sent by a Spanish coordinating group 
for solidarity with Latin America. 
  Tele Rebelde Network at 0000 GMT on 21 April reports that in 
Moa, Holguin, a 3.5-km-long oil pipeline built at a cost of $4 
million is near completion. The 24-inch pipeline will make it 
possible to off- load 55 tons of oil in 30 hours, thus 
significantly reducing the nickel industry's oil freight costs. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1700 GMT on 19 April reports that Matanzas 
Province's spring planting goal is 507 caballerias in the first 
half of the year. Currently, only 150 caballerias have been 
planted. 
  Radio Rebelde at 0900 GMT on 22 April reports that this 
year's tobacco harvest in Pinar del Rio is already better than 
last year -- 23 million poles have already been gathered. The 
province is about to reach its 1994 goal of harvesting 300,000 
quintals -- 25,000 quintals more than in 1993. The tobacco 
industry provides $100 million to Cuba; 70 percent of the 
tobacco comes from this province. 
  Radio Reloj at 1434 GMT on 22 April reports that in Granma 
Province, at a quarry in Jiguani Municipality, a new type of 
marble called "Rosado del Rio" with great sales potential is 
being quarried and will be ready for marketing this month. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1155 GMT on 22 April reports that the 
Guanabo Industrial Complex in Havana produced 60 train-buses in 
1993; this year's goal is to produce 200 of these 300-passenger 
buses.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Aruba Opposition Wants to </F>
Participate in Crisis Cabinet"] 
  [Excerpts] Rotterdam, 19 Apr -- A so-called "crisis 
cabinet" may be formed in Aruba to adopt a number of emergency 
measures in the financial and economic domain and organize new 
elections. Yesterday [18 April], opposition leader H. Eman said 
that he was prepared to look into the possibility of working 
together with the MEP [People's Electoral Movement] of Prime 
Minister N. Oduber. 
  On Sunday evening [17 April], Oduber let it be known that 
his 
second cabinet has fallen and that he now intended to lose no 
time in exploring the possibility of forming a broad coalition 
with AVP [Aruban People's Party] leader Eman. Oduber said that 
he no longer had any confidence in his two small coalition 
partners, the PPA [Aruban Patriotic Party] and ADN [National 
Democratic Union], each of which had one seat in the parliament. 
The second Oduber cabinet, which only had the support of 11 out 
of 21 seats in parliament, lasted for approximately one year. 
Together, the MEP and AVP have 18 seats. 
  In a telephone conversation with NRC HANDELSBLAD, Eman said 
he was demanding early elections as a precondition for any 
possible cooperation with Oduber. A broad coalition between the 
two major parties that rode out the entire parliamentary session 
until the elections in 1997 was, he considered, a "station we 
have already passed." [passage omitted] 
  On Sunday, however, the cabinet crumbled. Differences of 
opinion regarding financial and economic policy and especially a 
severe round of cuts for the government were the cause. 
Political observers in Oranjestad believe that the reason for 
the cabinet crisis was a row about the dismissal of the director 
of a housing association, aggravated by the subsequent 
nomination to that position of a future son-in-law of ADN 
Parliamentarian Charo Kelly. 
  If the social plan of his AVP is implemented for the main 
part, then after early elections opposition leader Eman could 
bear the responsibility of government together with the MEP. 
The main thrust of the social plan involves the more honest 
distribution of income in Aruba, "the richest country in the 
Caribbean region." According to the plan, the payments made to 
pensioners and the recipients of benefits had to be increased. 
[passage omitted] 
  "If a provisional crisis cabinet is formed, then the AVP 
will 
prove flexible," said Eman, who is not demanding the premiership 
although his party is slightly larger in terms of the number of 
votes than that led by Oduber. "That will only become an issue 
when the Aruban electorate has once again voted and we know how 
the division of power looks," he said. 
  On Sunday evening [17 April], Oduber regretted that his 
second cabinet had made such little progress with financial and 
administrative reorganization. "The present coalition has never 
known peace and stability; there has always been a lack of 
cooperation." Previously, he had criticized the "patronage 
policy" of the small parties, i.e., the appointment of friends 
to governmental or semi-governmental posts. "We have made 
mistakes and they must be rectified," he said in November, in an 
interview with NRC HANDELSBLAD. "Too many officials have been 
appointed and too much tax liability has been imposed in too 
short a time."

  [Text] Santo Domingo, 24 Apr (AFP) -- UNHCR representative 
Juan Manuel Castro, a Peruvian national, has said talks with the 
group of 102 Haitians who are occupying the offices of the UN 
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in the Dominican Republic 
have been unsuccessful up to now. 
  The Haitians, 50 men, 20 women, and 32 children, occupied 
the 
UNHCR offices in downtown Santo Domingo on Friday to demand that 
they be granted refugee status. 
  Castro told the media that the talks "have been 
unsuccessful, 
and we do not know what their intentions are. F. Castro visited 
the Haitians who are occupying the UNHCR offices today and 
ordered they be given more food and medicine. 
  The Dominican police have had the block where the UNHCR 
offices are located surrounded since Friday, but there has been 
no official statement from the government of President Joaquin 
Balaguer.

  [Excerpts] On 21 April in Port-au-Prince, Haitian Senate 
President Firmin Jean-Louis presented a bill granting amnesty to 
the authors and accomplices of the coup d'etat that overthrew 
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide on 30 September 1991. 
Jean-Louis' presentation, accompanied by about 10 other 
senators, took place in a hotel of the capital in the presence 
of representatives of the UN secretary general's Friendly Four 
countries. The following is a report by Pierre Jerome Richard: 
  [Begin recording] [Richard] "The senators who are part of 
the 
normal Senate met the morning of 21 April at the Christopher 
Hotel to propose an amnesty law for the benefit of those who 
participated in the 30 September [1991] coup d'etat, according 
to the senators' report to the press. Several foreign diplomats, 
including Eric Falt, UN spokesman for Haiti; (Mrs. Elza Ocho 
Campe), Venezuelan charge d'affaires; (Francis Fillol), Canadian 
ambassador; and [U.S. Ambassador] William Lacy Swing were 
present at the ceremony, which began at about 1130. Senate 
President Firmin Jean-Louis opened the ceremony. He thanked all 
the diplomats and members of the press who were present. In the 
opinion of Senator Jean-Louis, this proposal is the key to 
unblocking the country's crisis. Sen. Martinez describes the 
contents of this proposal:" 
  [Martinez] Considering that the 30 September 1991 coup 
d'etat, which involved the forced departure of the president of 
the Republic, is an act provided for and punishable by law, and 
this event gave rise to many violations that necessarily took on 
a political character. 
  Considering that the legislative power lays down laws on all 
subjects of public interest, the Senate has voted the following 
law: 
  Article 1. The authors and accomplices of the 29-30 
September 
1991 coup, which entailed the departure of the president of the 
Republic, are granted amnesty. 
  Article. 2. This amnesty law applies to all violations 
ensuing from the coup d'etat, ranging from 29-30 September 1991 
to the date of promulgation of this amnesty law. 
  Article. 3. Regarding the rights of third parties, the 
victims of the acts excused by this law will have recourse to a 
special compensation fund that will be created for that purpose. 
  Article. 4. This law will be published and executed at the 
behest of the ministers of justice and the interior in the areas 
that respectively concern them. 
  [Richard] "Sen. Jean-Louis hopes the international community 
will continue helping the Haitian people in their struggle for 
democracy." [passage omitted] 
  "This proposal, which was supported by 13 out of 17 
senators, 
was adopted by senators from many blocs within the Senate. Among 
those who voted for this law are Julio Larosiliere, Herard 
Pauyo, Turneb Delpe, and Clark Parent. At the conclusion of the 
meeting, we noted the presence of [former] Sen. Reynold Georges 
and Sen. Jacques Rony Mondestin, who were going to bring their 
support to the plan. 
  ``During the ceremony, Sen. Jean-Louis asked everyone 
present 
to sing the country's national anthemn. This is how the ceremony 
ended, with Sen. Jean-Louis, as master of ceremonies, inviting 
the guests to partake of refreshments. Many of the participants 
took advantage of the refreshments to give their opinions. Among 
them was foreign diplomat Eric Falt:'' 
  [Falt] We have been in a deadlock for several months. It is 
a 
proposal aimed at getting out of the current crisis. We can 
congratulate ourselves on that. It is a step in the right 
direction. Regarding the rest, it is first and foremost a 
Haitian issue. [words indistinct] but as a general rule, we 
think it is a step in the right direction that could unblock the 
crisis. 
  [Richard] "The host, Sen. Firmin Jean-Louis, asked the press 
to help him popularize the bill. The senator also said he would 
take steps within the Chamber of Deputies to see if it would 
subscribe to this proposal in the future. Pierre Jerome Richard 
for Signal FM." [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Evans Beaubrun by correspondent </F>
Clarence Renois; place not given -- live] 
  [Text] [Renois] Let us reconsider the amnesty bill which 
was presented on 21 April by approximately 12 or 13 senators of 
the Republic in a hotel in Port-au-Prince in the presence of 
members of the diplomatic corps. Our guest, Deputy Evans 
Beaubrun, himself an author of an amnesty bill that has been 
submitted to the lower chamber, will comment on and respond to 
the Senate initiative. 
  Deputy Beaubrun, good morning! You are the author of an 
amnesty bill. How does your bill differ from the senators' bill; 
how does it resemble theirs? 
  [Beaubrun] The two proposals differ on the point that the 
one 
from the senators is a special law, which in principle imposes 
certain norms on the law, as we perceive law; while mine is an 
amendment to the law already in effect, which provides for a 
solution. 
  [Renois] Another question, Deputy Beaubrun, what are the 
chances the senators will accept this bill? What are the 
possibilities that the Chamber of Deputies will vote on it in 
the event the situation normalizes in the Senate? 
  [Beaubrun] I must tell you, Clarence, that this bill is not 
from the Senate of the Republic. A group of deputies presented 
this bill, which was submitted to the Chamber of Deputies on 8 
October 1993, two weeks after I submitted my first bill. I must 
tell you that that bill was signed by Pierre Simon Georges, 
Frantz Robert Monde, Walto Augustin, Beauge Yves Pericles, 
Joseph Benoit Laguerre, Olipcial Regis, Lonnes Joseph, Rita 
Frederic Moncoeur, and Lionel Bouzi. 
  The senators simply modified the bill by withdrawing certain 
considerations and added two new considerations. Therefore, it 
is not a draft of law belonging to the Senate of the Republic. 
They are only exhuming a draft that was the subject of many 
discussions... 
  [Renois] Do you mean that this draft, since it has already 
been prepared by the deputies, has a greater chance of passing 
because Frantz Robert Monde is the current president of the 
Chamber of Deputies? 
  [Beaubrun] That is not what I mean. I mean this draft has 
some serious, very big problems. The law must be general, and 
this law concerns a group of citizens. It is far from being 
general. Furthermore, the law must look to the future. The law 
is for the future. This law does not look to the future at all. 
  [Renois] Have you reproached the senators for not mentioning 
the financial aspects -- because you have asked for financial 
amnesty, I believe, in your draft? 
  [Beaubrun] I am saying that this time, the senators have 
gone 
beyond the scope of this amnesty. That is one of the major 
problems with this draft. This draft, all things considered, 
presents some imbroglios. Although those senators say they are 
opposed to a large amnesty, those same senators say in Article 
2: This amnesty extends to all offenses following the coup 
d'etat. When they say all offenses, stealing is also included in 
the offenses after the coup d'etat; the nonpayment of taxes 
could be considered an offense of the coup-d'etat, just to name 
two. It is a very extended text. Whatever offenses could be 
linked to the coup d'etat are covered by this amnesty. 
  [Renois] ....are forgiven by this amnesty. Last question, 
Deputy Beaubrun. Regarding the steps taken by the Chamber of 
Deputies -- I am referring to the consultations begun with the 
military and other institutions, even the parliamentary plan 
voted by yourself, as well as the political demands that are 
being made today for the application of Article 149 -- is this 
draft still appropriate or even up to date? 
  [Beaubrun] Personally, I still believe this draft is 
appropriate and up to date. The procedure, however, is faulty 
because the Senate has used it as a political weapon. I 
understand that the Senate is a political institution. The 
parliament has two institutions: the political institution, 
which is the Senate; and the working institution, which is the 
Chamber of Deputies. But I believe the Senate went a little too 
far. The Senate made it a completely political matter. Eleven 
senators were to vote and present this draft to the 
international community and to the press. Why did they not vote 
on this law? This procedure prevents us deputies from 
rationally, legally examining this text. Why did they not vote? 
Because this is a petition. We cannot receive a petition from 
the Senate. We can receive a petition from a citizen or from any 
segment of the city or the nation. But from the Senate, we can 
receive a resolution.... 
  [Renois] What makes you say this initiative is a petition, 
not a resolution? 
  [Beaubrun] It is a petition. A resolution is voted on 
article 
by article. A draft is voted on article by article. When it is a 
petition, it is presented with the signatures of so-and-so. For 
instance, I understand 11 senators signed this text, and that 
they are going to ask other senators to countersign. Then they 
will ask the deputies to sign this text. I am saying it is a 
political approach, not a parliamentary approach. 
  [Renois] Deputy Beaubrun, thank you for answering our 
questions.

  [Text] Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis confirmed 
that the Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN] will continue 
its consultation process with the Indian communities before 
returning to the reconciliation dialogue. 
  Camacho Solis said that with the return of a portion of the 
EZLN troops to their communities, the tension in Chiapas will 
decrease and a clear course in favor of the resumption of the 
talks is marked. Thursday night, the EZLN Command reported that 
a portion of its members would return to their places of origin. 
Moreover, the EZLN will continue with its consultation process 
to return to the reconciliation dialogue. Camacho Solis said the 
EZLN is responding to the messages for peace made by the 
government and the civilian society. 
  [Begin Camacho Solis recording] I believe it is good news 
for 
the country to know the EZLN is responding to these actions with 
actions that set a very clear course in favor of the resumption 
of the talks. [end recording] 
  The peace commissioner met with President Carlos Salinas and 
with Chiapas Governor Javier Lopez at noon. Today, members of 
the State Committee of Indian and Peasant Organizations of 
Chiapas, who invaded lands in the state, agreed to contribute to 
the peace process in Chiapas.

  [Excerpts] San Cristobal de las Casas, Mexico, 22 Apr (EFE) 
-- The Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN] has ordered 
hundreds of Indian guerrillas to return to their communities 
tomorrow as a peace gesture. The EZLN's decision to "call off 
the red alert" among its troops starting tomorrow and to resume 
consultations within the rank-and-file was announced in a 
communique released today in San Cristobal de las Casas. 
  The communique says that "if the favorable climate for a 
dialogue continues," the EZLN will resume consultations with its 
rank-and-file on the agreements negotiated with the Mexican 
Government in late February -- agreements outlining pacification 
plans for Chiapas. "The EZLN affirms its desire for a political 
response to the just demands that keep the fire of its struggle 
alive. The EZLN continues to demand liberty, justice, and 
democracy for all Mexicans." [passage omitted] 
  In the communique, the EZLN acknowledges the "honest and 
determined" efforts of Manuel Camacho Solis, mediator Bishop 
Samuel Ruiz, and the civilian society to "make reason prevail 
over the use of force" and to meet the demands of the Indians. 
The EZLN is also pleased with the release of the 16 people who 
had been held since January under false charges that they were 
Zapatists. The EZLN "interprets this as a good sign that talks 
for a fair and respectable peace should be resumed." 
  In addition, "Subcommander Marcos," the Zapatists' 
mysterious 
ideological leader, issued a communique severely criticizing 
those who have slandered his armed movement and who have scorned 
the rebels' poverty. The subcommander berated and described as 
"stupid" the opinions of several analysts who said the EZLN had 
delayed the consultations to have the peace talks postponed and 
to expand the armed conflict. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [From the "Early Morning" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis is in 
Chiapas. He says he will not meet with PRI candidate Ernesto 
Zedillo, that the dialogue with the Zapatist National Liberation 
Army [EZLN] is still open, and that significant agreements could 
be reached soon. 
  Messages of concurrence between the EZLN and the government 
continue to be released. This will enable an announcement of 
progress in the Chiapas peace accords very soon, Camacho Solis 
said. 
  [Begin Camacho recording] Through the mediator, I have 
received an EZLN communique from from which I am able to report 
the following: 
  1) the EZLN's clear determination to maintain a cease-fire; 
  2) the certainty that channels of dialogue with the EZLN 
are fully open; and 
  3) the EZLN's awareness that the government has issued 
messages of harmony backed by evidence in the past few days. 
  This prompts us to reactivate this form of communication, 
which has proved so effective. [end recording] 
  Asked on whether he would meet with PRI [Institutional 
Revolutionary Party] presidential candidate Ernesto Zedillo, who 
initiated his political campaign in this state, Camacho said 
this: 
  [Begin Camacho recording] It is also important for the 
commissioner to remain politically impartial, so the 
negotiations can reflect a national consensus rather than the 
position of one, two, or three political forces. [end recording] 
  Camacho said that he will continue to seek the consensus of 
all political forces in the country regarding the Chiapas 
conflict and that the solution to the problem must come from a 
true national agreement.

<F P=106> [From the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Today, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari announced 
the creation of a commission of citizens, including some who are 
critical of or opposed to the government, to help investigate 
the murder of Luis Donaldo Colosio, presidential candidate of 
the Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI]. In a brief 
statement made at the Vicente Guerrero Hall of the Los Pinos 
residence, the president noted that Mexico wants to know the 
truth. 
  [Begin Salinas recording] At the same time, it is necessary 
to avoid a climate of mutual suspicion. Any inquiry is 
difficult; it takes time. We cannot, however, accept the 
fostering of a climate of doubt. We are determined to open the 
investigation so that citizens of the highest professional 
quality can participate. [end recording] 
  The commission will comprise the following people: Carlos 
Payan, newsman and LA JORNADA daily editor; (Fernando Gomez 
Montt), National Action Party federal deputy and chairman of the 
Chamber of Deputies Justice Committee; Leonel Godoy, former 
Michoacan State attorney general, former deputy of the Party of 
the Democratic Revolution, and special prosecutor in the Obando 
and Hill case; lawyer (Agustin Santamarina); and Agustin Basabe, 
PRI deputy for Nuevo Leon State and former Colosio adviser. The 
president thanked these citizens for their willingness to 
participate in the task, which he described as delicate. He 
added that the Colosio Riojas family welcomes their 
participation.

<F P=106> [First of three-part article by "the people's lawyer" from </F>
the "Fricasse" column: "Zedillo's Men"] 
  [Text] Before beginning, my dear readers, I would like to 
make a suggestion. I want you to clip and save the three 
articles that will appear in this space because they could serve 
as reference material in the future. 
  Well, if pity and votes favor him (as they most probably 
will), Dr. Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon will become president 
of Mexico. Those who ponder this possibility also wonder: What 
team of men will Zedillo choose to govern this country? 
  The team selected by the candidate will be very important 
because the profile, personality, and level that the government 
will attain depends on its members and their characteristics and 
will determine the solutions they will seek for the numerous 
problems afflicting our country. 
  It is for the purpose of satisfying this curiosity that this 
country lawyer of yours will reveal in the following three 
articles the names of those who will make up the government team. 
  They are divided into three groups. We also divided our work 
into three installments in keeping with the belief that there 
are -- or will be -- three types of collaborators in the Zedillo 
administration: 
  1. Salinists who are fond of (and friends with) Zedillo. 
  2. Colosists who are close to Zedillo. 
  3. Zedillists by origin, from the north [los zedillistas 
de origen, de hueso colorado]. 
  Let us begin our work with the chapter on the Salinists who 
are fond of Zedillo. But before we do that, to help you get the 
picture, let us have a little history on Dr. Zedillo's 
background and the people with whom he has worked. 
  The former secretary of public education graduated as an 
economist from the Instituto Politecnico Nacional, IPN, and 
earned master's and doctoral degrees in economics from Yale 
University. He taught at IPN and the Colegio de Mexico 
(1978-80), as did Jaime Serra Puche, Manuel Camacho Solis, and 
Jose Cordoba Montayo. 
  In terms of work experience, Zedillo played a prominent role 
at Banco de Mexico as head of Ficorca [expansion unknown], where 
he established strong ties with Miguel Mancera. Carlos Mancera 
Corcuera, who serves as coordinator of Zedillo's advisers, is 
Miguel Mancera's son. From there, Zedillo moved to the 
Secretariat of Programming and Budget as deputy secretary under 
Pedro Aspe, and in 1988 he move up to secretary when Salinas 
assumed the presidency. 
  In all these posts Zedillo developed important 
relationships, 
but perhaps the most important was with "Kingmaker" [previous 
word in English] Jose Maria Cordoba Montoya, adviser to 
President Salinas, who had Colosio nominated first, then his 
favorite, Ernesto Zedillo. 
  Zedillo is also a close friend of Emilio Antonio Gamboa 
Patron, current secretary of communications and transport, (to 
give you an idea of their relationship) with whom he spent the 
end of the year in Acapulco along with Governor (and friend) 
Ruben Figueroa Alcocer. 
  Commerce Secretary Jaime Jose Serra Puche is also close to 
Dr. Zedillo. The two share economic outlooks and international 
links created by NAFTA. The recent appointment of Ignacio 
Pichardo Pagaza as secretary general of the PRI [Institutional 
Revolutionary Party] and campaign coordinator shows that Dr. 
Zedillo trusts this man. 
  Another group of Salinists fond of Zedillo has its origins 
at 
Banco de Mexico. You should know that Zedillo owes everything to 
Governor Miguel Mancera for granting him a scholarship and for 
employing him. Zedillo belongs to the Grupo Banco de Mexico, the 
cradle of a number of important friendships. 
  The other group of Zedillo friends is at IPN and branches 
out 
into the Secretariat of Communications, because the links 
between the IPN and this secretariat are no secret. 
  Most prominent among Zedillo's friends at Grupo Banco de 
Mexico (to which Miguel de la Madrid and his pupil, Carlos 
Salinas, also belong) is Guillermo "Memo" Ortiz Martinez, our 
companero at the military school and current deputy secretary of 
finance. 
  Francisco Gil Diaz, the implacable right hand of Dr. Pedro 
Aspe at the Finance Secretariat, is also a friend of Zedillo. 
Two governors are among this group of Zedillo friends: Patricio 
Chirinos of Veracruz and Otto Granados of Aguascalientes. It is 
obvious that Salinists who are now in office have a good chance 
of keeping their jobs or moving to other offices at the same 
level. 
  Tomorrow we will give you a list of the Colosists who 
support 
Zedillo, as well as an idea of their possible destination. As 
Hitchcock would say: "Do not miss it!"

<F P=106> [Second of three-part article by "the people's lawyer" from </F>
the "Fricasse" column: "Zedillo's Men"] 
  [Text] A promise is a promise, so we will continue to talk 
about the men who will make up Zedillo's team. Yesterday we 
commented on the members of his team who are associates of 
Salinas and Zedillo. At this time we will discuss the 
associates of Zedillo and Colosio, the so-called "Orphans of the 
Tijuana Tragedy." 
  First, however, we must make a clarification. The existence 
of such a group should surprise no one because Colosio and 
Zedillo worked together. They were not rivals. If the new 
candidate had been Camacho (who was assassinated with Colosio, 
only politically), the story would have been different. In 
addition, let us keep in mind that Zedillo, in his 29 March 
speech accepting the candidacy, mentioned Colosio some 30 times. 
Throughout, his speech carried a message of continuity. 
  Enter Sonora-born Manlio Fabio Beltrones, another of 
Zedillo's men. By reason of his birthplace and political 
inclination, Beltrones hitched his carriage to that of his 
countryman, Colosio, to the extent that he, Beltrones, appointed 
Colosio's father in his state cabinet. Perhaps for his 
relationship with Colosio, Cordoba selected Beltrones to present 
Zedillo as the new candidate. It was said at a dinner that 
Zedillo and Beltrones presented a united front against the 
followers of Colosio who had proposed Lievano Saenz to be the 
coordinator of Zedillo's campaign. 
  Zedillo's list includes Mario Luis Fuentes, the strongest 
link between Colosio and Zedillo, and Victor Manuel Palma Cesar, 
Zedillo's deputy coordinator for Colosio's campaign and who is 
believed to be appointed senator for the State of Morelos. 
  Guillermo Hopkins Gamez was born in Magdalena de Kino, 
Sonora. Politically speaking, he was very, very close to 
Colosio. Hopkins holds a degree in political science from the 
Ibero-American University and a master's degree in public 
administration from the University of Colorado. He held the 
position of adviser to the Chief Clerk from 1987 to 1988 and 
worked in the planning and budget areas in the Sonora State 
Government. He was deputy logistics coordinator for the PRI 
campaign under coordinator Zedillo. It has been said he stands a 
good chance of becoming senator for Sonora and even governor of 
the state. 
  Another of Zedillo's men and Colosio's associates is Andres 
Marco Antonio Bernal Gutierrez, also Tamaulipas-born, who was 
president of the SEDESOL [Social Development Secretariat] 
National Solidarity Institute during 1992 and 1993 under Colosio 
and deputy planning coordinator for the PRI campaign under 
Zedillo. 
  As for Lievano Saenz, we know that prior to the campaign, he 
held the post of chief clerk at SEDESOL and that he was social 
communications spokesman for the PRI presidential campaign. He 
could become senator for Chihuahua in the future. 
  Nevertheless, it has been said that, among Colosio's 
friends, 
Esteban Moctezuma Barragan is one of the men closest to Zedillo. 
He holds a degree in law and economics from National Autonomous 
University of Mexico, a master's degree in political economy 
from Cambridge University, and a degree in regional development, 
which he obtained in Japan. In addition, Moctezuma Barragan 
started out at the Planning and Budget Secretariat [SPP], in the 
area managed by Colosio, held the post of chief clerk at SPP 
under Zedillo, and was Colosio's private secretary when Colosio 
was head of the PRI National Executive Council. He was also 
Deputy Secretary for Educational Planning at the Public 
Education Secretariat. Of all the men mentioned, he is closest 
to Zedillo. For this reason, it is believed that he will be 
appointed for a very important position. 
  We can say that Colosio's associates and Zedillo's 
associates 
can well be taken for one another because their political 
inclinations and ideologies, not only are compatible, but nearly 
parallel. All of them are birds of a feather. All of them are 
young, educated, hold master's and doctor's degrees obtained 
abroad, and have been following a steady political course. 
  By reason of mutual friendship, this group also includes 
Carlos Rojas, former SPP deputy secretary under Zedillo and in 
charge of the National Solidarity Program, as well as Francisco 
Labastida Ochoa, former governor of Sinaloa. Let us keep in mind 
that all of these people will appear in the country's political 
horizon for the next six-year term if Zedillo is elected 
president.

<F P=106> [Third of three-part article by "the people's lawyer" from </F>
the Fricasse" column: "Zedillo's Men"] 
  [Text] We have now reached the third part in this trilogy 
of articles on Zedillo's team. We began with Salinas' 
associates, continued with Colosio's associates, and now we will 
introduce the most loyal Zedillo associates. This is the group 
that has created the most expectations because it is the closest 
to the candidate and the least known. Once again, these people 
share an impeccable university education and steady progress in 
the government apparatus. 
  For starters, there is Fausto Alzati Araiza, currently 
director of National Council for Science and Technology. He 
studied law at UNAM [National Autonomous University of Mexico] 
and received a master's degree and a doctorate in political 
economics and government from Harvard University. He has worked 
in the energy sector, including Secretariat of Energy, Mines, 
and Parastate Industry and Mexican Petroleum, and has served as 
economic adviser at National Finance, Inc., the Planning and 
Budget Secretariat, and Institute for Political, Economic, and 
Social Studies. 
  Another of Zedillo's cronies is Antonio Arguelles Diaz 
Gonzalez, who studied arts and economics at Stanford University 
at the same time that Cordoba Montoya was working toward his 
master's degree. Arguelles Diaz is now deputy coordinator for 
administration and finance of the PRI [Institutional 
Revolutionary Party] presidential campaign. 
  Hector Morales Corrales, the federal government's spokesman 
in Chiapas, was Zedillo's classmate at the Instituto Politecnico 
Nacional. He has worked in the field of press and public 
relations at System for Complete Family Development, National 
Consumer's Institute, Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit, 
SPP [Secretariat for Planning and Budget], and SEP [Secretariat 
for Public Education] with Zedillo. 
  Miguel Antonio Estrada Meza, Zedillo's former private 
secretary while at SEP, has held administrative positions at 
this secretariat and at Baja California's Autonomous University. 
He graduated as a teacher from the Mexicali Teacher's School 
and received a degree in political science from the Baja 
California Autonomous University. In addition, he holds a 
master's degree on pedagogical discipline from California 
University and a doctorate in sociology from UNAM. 
  Another of Zedillo's cronies is Pascual Garcia Alba 
Idunatec. 
Garcia Alba, born in Hidalgo, currently holds the post of deputy 
secretary for educational coordination at SEP. He has a 
master's degree in economics from the College of Mexico and a 
doctorate in economics and a master's degree in arts and 
philosophy from Yale University. 
  There is also a woman, Aurora Pierdant Grunstein, who now 
holds the post at CONAFE [not further identified], an agency 
that supports SEP. She has a degree in economics from ITAM 
[Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico], a master's 
degree in planning from the Social Studies Institute in the 
Netherlands, and a doctorate in economic policies which she 
received in the United Kingdom. She distinguished herself by 
founding the Institute for Peasant Studies. German Andres 
Fernandez Aguirre is a lawyer and has held juridical positions. 
He is linked to Zedillo through SPP, SEP, and, particularly 
through the Banco de Mexico. 
  Fernando Solis Camara y Jimenez Camet played a significant 
role in Zedillo's academic development. Solis Camara has even 
been mentioned in connection with Zedillo's doctoral thesis. 
Solis Camara is an economist who graduated from Anahuac 
University, holds a master's degree in public policy and a 
doctorate in public policy from Harvard University and a 
master's degree in economics from Boston University. 
  Sonora-born Eduardo Guadalupe Almeyda Armenta, the current 
director of professions at SEP, graduated from UNAM's Law 
School. He worked as private secretary and technical secretary 
at SEP, the Foreign Relations Secretariat, the Chamber of 
Deputies, and SPP. 
  A very important young politician and Zedillo's crony is 
Carlos Mancera Corcuera, only 31 years old. He is an economist 
who graduated from ITAM, and he is the son of Miguel Mancera 
Aguayo, the first governor of Banco de Mexico. Zedillo 
appointed him associate director for scientific and 
technological policy at SEP thanks to the man's direct 
relationship with Mancera Aguayo. Zedillo is grateful because 
Mancera Aguayo helped him secure the position of economic 
technical adviser and a scholarship to study in the United 
States. 
  There are other Zedillo associates. Pascual Garcia Alba, a 
classmate at Yale; Raul Talan Ramirez, deputy secretary for 
education, who graduated from the Instituto Politecnico Nacional 
just as Zedillo did; Jose Angel Pescador, Jose Cordoba's 
classmate at Stanford and related to Zedillo through Cordoba; 
Gilberto Guevara Niebla; Olac Fuentes; Antonio Gago Huget, an 
education technician who joined Zedillo's group through SEP; 
German Fernandez Aguirre, lawyer at UNAM and Banco de Mexico; 
Elias Calles, Perez Correa, Juan Rebolledo, Dionisio Perez 
Jacome, and Fernando Gutierrez Barrios, Zedillo's liaisons with 
the Army, old PRI members, and certain political factions 
outside the PRI. 
  From the profile of these men, probable assistants to the 
probable president of the republic, we can see that the economic 
aspect is adequately covered by experts in the field. The good 
news is that we can predict that the team will be particularly 
sensitive toward social and educational aspects. If the vote 
count favors Zedillo, we will see the presidential ribbon on his 
chest, and in his cabinet we will see many of these names which, 
for the good fortune of Mexico, are not at all improvised or 
inexperienced.

<F P=106> [Text of "resolution by the Sixth Plenary Session of the </F>
Second National Council of the Party of the Democratic 
Revolution," issued on 17 April 1994; place not given] 
  [Text] The National Council of the Party of the Democratic 
Revolution, [PRD] taking into consideration the grave situation 
the country is enduring and the need for coherent proposals 
capable of unifying the party and contributing to a peaceful 
transition toward democracy in the country and taking into 
consideration that in spite of the efforts made by the 
negotiating commission and our congressmen, there has not been 
enough progress to guarantee that there will be a clean, 
authentic, and reliable electoral process in August 1994, has 
decided to summon the government, the political forces, and 
society to a serious dialogue to find ways of responsibly facing 
the current crisis and to offer citizens guarantees so they can 
freely elect the government that best suits their aspirations 
and interests, 
  PAN believes the country wants to see clear evidence that 
the 
government has the political will to guarantee a democratic 
transition and to endorse with deeds the commitments acquired 
through the Agreement for Peace, Democracy, and Justice. 
  It resolves: 
  1. To demand that the assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio 
be cleared up as well as the creation of a special commission 
composed of independent attorneys of acknowledged honorability. 
The commission must be given all the necessary support and 
facilities to carry out its activities. Only this will give the 
investigations credibility. 
  2. To demand a continuation of the peace dialogue in 
Chiapas, a stop to the hostile climate against the Zapatist 
National Liberation Army [EZLN], and satisfying the demands from 
the EZLN and from the State Council of Indian and Peasant 
Organizations. 
  The government has the obligation of guaranteeing a halt to 
the provocations and aggressions against the Indian-peasant 
movement that are blocking the dialogue. 
  3. The immediate opening of the media, especially the XEW 
Television Network, under impartial and equitable conditions for 
all candidates and parties so the citizens may have truthful 
information and facts to draw electoral preference opinions. 
  4. To resolutely back the social and economic aspirations 
and demands that the various sectors of the population have 
presented in view of the ruin generated by the neo-liberal and 
excluding policies of this administration. 
  5. To promote the formation of the alternate social bloc 
and the recomposition of forces initiated by the National 
Democratic Alliance to forward, with citizen mobilizations and 
votes, the transition to democracy. 
  6. To review our elections campaign strategy to prepare a 
national plan with candidates to Senate and Chamber of Deputies 
seats; to harmonize and improve the propaganda effort as well as 
the organization of electoral structures to provide a convincing 
and distinctive message to the most important social sectors, to 
satisfy their demands through a viable government. 
  7. To enhance the unity of the people and to responsibly 
maintain links with society and the productive forces to 
strengthen the image that we represent the alternative that will 
make changes to make stability, peace, and development in the 
country possible. 
  8. To back the current process of political negotiations 
in the framework established by the National Council and to 
uphold the political initiative aimed at full compliance with 
the 27 January Agreement for Democracy, Justice, and Peace. 
  9. To establish the minimum legislative changes the party 
believes must take place so that the electoral organizations may 
enjoy full autonomy and independence and may engage in 
procedures and actions that will effectively permit free, 
authentic, and reliable elections. 
  It will be necessary: 
  a. To continue and to promptly conclude the review process, 
with the approval of political forces, electoral officials at 
all levels, including the members of the electoral tribunals as 
well as the people responsible for the Federal Electoral 
Registry, and to make the necessary replacements to insure the 
full independence of the government's Professional Electoral 
Service. 
  b. To satisfy the demand that credibility on the voting 
lists be enhanced by means of efficient correction-making 
procedures and the delivery to the parties of a definite list of 
names 60 days before election day. Among other measures, lists 
must also be exhibited at electoral districts and not just in 
the municipalities, to facilitate citizen inspections. 
  The National Council calls on the citizens to continue 
verifying the voting lists after 30 April to compare them with 
the Federal Electoral Registry. 
  To establish the obligation the electoral authorities have 
to 
deliver voting credentials to the citizens and to make 
corrections through the citizen committees for electoral 
guarantees that resulted from the first selection made, by 
census, of voting table directors. 
  c. To insure equitable access by the candidates to the 
media, by extending the free time periods, reducing party 
publicity, and establishing verification mechanisms to evaluate 
the impartiality norms of newscasts. 
  To condition radio and television concessions to the 
impartiality and equity demonstrated by these media while 
covering election campaigns, as well as to the respect shown for 
constitutional guarantees and freedom of expression. 
  d. To efficiently put limits on and supervise campaign 
expenditures and to prevent any undue utilization of government 
resources and programs in favor of the governing party and its 
candidates. 
  To adjust deputy and senator campaigns to the limits set for 
the presidential campaign and to limit private financing to 
contributions of no more than 9,000 new pesos per person. 
  To treat contributions above this amount as bribe crimes. 
  e. To satisfy the demands for respect for the fundamental 
rights of parties and citizens such as the right to have common 
candidates [candidaturas comunes], the immediate election of 
Federal District government officials, and the voting by 
Mexicans abroad. 
  f. The functioning of the Special Prosecutor's Office for 
Electoral Crimes [Fiscalia Especial para Delitos Electorales], 
which must be backed by a supervisory committee composed of 
representatives from the political parties as well as by 
independent citizens and national observers; and foreign 
visitors who satisfy regulations must be invited with the 
support of multilateral international organizations. 
  g. The suspension of all events that may establish links 
between the work of public offices and officials and the 
political decisions, campaigns, and propaganda of the governing 
party. A formal declaration by the president regarding his 
determination to submit to the mandate of the people and to 
peacefully transfer power to whatever candidate is freely 
elected by them. 
  10. If these demands are not met, the next plenary 
session of the National Council will decide what action the 
party will take. Meanwhile, the National Executive Committee 
will continue coordinating actions to promote these resolutions 
and, together with a group of congressmen, will decide on the 
position to be adopted with regard to the various legislative 
reforms proposals, especially those that deal with the Federal 
Code of Electoral Institutions and Processes. 
  11. The National Council has decided that the Executive 
Committee confer with the presidential candidate to form a 
plural and representative commission responsible for the 
negotiations. 
  Democracy now. A fatherland for everybody! 
  Resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the PRD Second 
National Council.

<F P=106> [From the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, National Action Party 
[PAN] candidate for president, has ruled out the possibility 
that an alliance of all the opposition forces in Mexico can 
defeat the Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI] in the coming 
August elections. Nevertheless, he said alliances could work 
under certain circumstances to advance democracy and defend the 
vote. 
  [Begin Fernandez recording] We can and should work with any 
political party to advance democracy. [end recording] 
  During a news conference held at the foreign correspondents 
section, Fernandez said there are two basic requirements for 
holding pure, credible elections. First, the PRI should lower 
its publicity expenses to keep them within legal limitations. 
Second, the media should allocate time to candidates equitably 
and serve the truth honestly.

<F P=106> [Report by Nestor Martinez] </F>
  [Text] On 19 April, Carlos Sales Guerrero, president of the 
Senate's Commerce Committee, said money is leaving the country 
because of an "instability which I hope will be temporary." 
During an interview, Sales expressed his confidence that 
political and economic stability will soon "improve the 
situation in the country." Nevertheless, he said he neither 
rules out nor disregards Mexico's serious problems. 
  He denied this movement is a "flight of capital." The 
phrase, he said, is currently being used to describe an 
uncontrolled departure of people afraid of losing their assets, 
which they try to protect at all costs. "We are dealing with a 
movement of capital; this is to say, a financial market 
instability caused by internal and external factors." 
  Sales is in charge of negotiating NAFTA as the legislative 
branch delegate. He said it is evident there are very marked 
"financial fluctuations" everywhere and higher federal fund 
interest rates in the United States, all of which have 
repercussions on the yield of all stock exchanges in the world. 
"We have additional problems, and this brings about 
adjustments. I cannot predict the extent and duration of those 
adjustments. I can only say that, fortunately, those stock 
market fluctuations never last long." 
  Asked whether there is any connection between a recurring 
drop in the stock exchange indexes and the country's 
pre-electoral situation, Sales replied that many factors are 
involved in this situation. "To deny the influence of any one 
of them would be like trying to shield the sun with one finger. 
To regard the effect of one of them, however, would be an 
oversimplification." 
  He summed up the situation by saying: "There is indeed 
instability, which I hope will be temporary. In the world's 
history, however, there has not been one single permanent 
downward trend. An upward movement always follows. This is why 
I think the degree of political and economic stability in the 
country will soon reassure us. I neither rule out nor disregard 
the problems affecting us."

<F P=106> [Report by Isabel Becerril] </F>
  [Text] Fernando Sanchez Ugarte, deputy secretary of the 
Commerce and Industrial Development Secretariat [SECOFI], 
estimated that the amount to be invested in the manufacturing 
sector during the 1993-94 period will total 60 billion new 
pesos. He also indicated that despite events that have occurred 
throughout the country since 1 January, the federal government 
does not foresee any changes as these relate to [economic] 
expectations. 
  Likewise, Sanchez stated that manufacturing growth during 
the 
first quarter will be practically "stable" or very small since 
it should be kept in mind that the October-November 1993 period 
there was a fall in activity. Despite the fact that growth in 
manufacturing activity has been minor during the first three 
months of the year, there are no plans to prepare any emergency 
programs to stimulate this productive sector of the country. 
  The SECOFI official indicated that what the federal 
government is doing is working with competitive programs 
designed within the framework of PECE [Stability, Employment and 
Competitiveness Pact], of which there are currently 33 such 
programs. Through these mechanisms, the federal government is 
working with each manufacturing company to solve their most 
urgent problems. The most common, pressing problems that have 
been identified among these companies include inadequate 
financing, tariffs, red tape and public bids, among others. 
  Interviewed within the framework of the inauguration of the 
Expo-Electronic 94, the official denied that investment plans in 
the assembly plant industry are being delayed. He stressed that 
it is even appropriate to say that this is one of the most 
dynamic investment items of the national economy. 
  In reinvigorating the issue of investments in the national 
manufacturing industry, Sanchez pointed out that many companies 
are now investing their capital in the sector. The Commerce 
Secretariat, he indicated, has detected a significant number of 
investments in every manufacturing field which are either 
concluding this year or are at a very advanced stage. These 
capital investments, he added, include those in the automobile 
sector, cement, textiles, electronics, and assembly plants. 
Sanchez stressed that there are a significant number of 
projects that are in an advanced stage. 
  On the other hand, in reference to the problems of the 
electrical manufacturing industries which consist of purchases 
in the public sector -- Federal Electricity Commission -- he 
pointed out that they are at a standstill because of problems 
caused by Chapter 10 of the free trade agreement, but that it 
was already being resolved. 
  Yesterday during a meeting with several manufacturers, an 
agreement was made with respect to what the rules of the game 
would be as they relate to national public bids authorized 
within the Free Trade Agreement. 
  During his speech, Sanchez Ugarte said the electronic 
manufacturing industry represents a key element in the country's 
economic, modernization strategy because the search for greater 
levels of productivity has encouraged a more significant use of 
electronic products in most sectors.

  [Text] Mexico City, 20 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- According to an 
Energy, Mines, and Parastate Industry Secretariat (SEMIP) 
report, Mexico will maintain its oil extraction and export rate 
at 1.3 million barrels a day. In London, Mauricio Toussaint 
Ribot, director of SEMIP hydrocarbon policies, said Mexico's 
production of liquid hydrocarbons, which was 3.131 million 
barrels a day in 1993, surpassed the all-time high reached in 
1982 for the third consecutive year. 
  A SEMIP communique stated that the Mexican official 
explained 
in London, before international experts, that of that amount, 
1.794 million was for domestic consumption and 1.337 million for 
export. Toussaint Ribot said the increase in hydrocarbon 
reserves over the past three years allowed the country to 
replenish three quarters of its production, thus reversing a 
trend of several years. 
  In the meeting where experts present their countries' 
hydrocarbon policies, he said 38 oil fields have been discovered 
in the past three years -- the same number discovered throughout 
the preceding six years. For this reason, he gave assurances 
that Mexican Petroleum [Pemex] will invest over $20 billion 
until the year 2000 to recover the cash flow that had diminished 
in the 1980's. Pemex currently invests $3 billion a year. 
  He added that Mexico's policy allows it to become integrated 
into markets worldwide with its competitive oil industry, which 
can face the uncertainties of international markets and remain a 
dynamic factor in the national economy.

  [Text] Mexico City, 23 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- In a message of 
condolence addressed to Richard Nixon's family, Mexican 
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari today lamented the former 
U.S. President's death. Salinas expressed his condolences to 
Nixon's daughters Patricia Cox and Julie Eisenhower, the 
president's office reported in a press communique. 
  Nixon, 81, died in a New York hospital on Friday night. On 
Monday, he suffered a cerebral hemorrhage, which kept him in a 
coma until his death. He had to step down in 1974 as the result 
of the Watergate scandal. Nixon's funeral will take place at 
Yorba Linda, his birthplace in California, next Wednesday.

<F P=106> [Article by Victor Cardoso] </F>
  [Text] Jon Imanol Azua Mendia, government vice president of 
the autonomous Basque country, confirmed that no known member of 
the separatist organization ETA [Basque Fatherland and Liberty] 
is in Mexico; that there is no known link with local subversive 
groups; and that the Mexican Government has never asked for 
special advisers to combat terrorist activities. 
  In a news conference at the conclusion of his eight-day 
official visit to Mexico, the representative of the Basque 
Government stated there is no information, proof, or indication 
that the ETA had anything to do with the events that shook 
Mexico this year. "If any known member of the ETA were in 
Mexico, he would have been identified and completely controlled. 
We have to admit, however, that clandestine organizations also 
have unidentified leaders, but they are always tracked down," he 
said. 
  He explained that the Mexican authorities and police 
exchange 
data with their counterparts in Spain and the Basque country, 
which he considered normal and based on signed agreements. He 
added that no specific action had been requested by the Mexican 
Government. 
  Azua Mendia condemned violence and said dialogue is the best 
path for finding solutions to any kind of problem. "There is no 
place in any country for violence or the use of violent methods 
because such things are insane and distort the main goals of any 
struggle," he expressed. 
  Well versed in Mexican affairs as he has lived here for 
several years, Azua Mendia made light of newspaper reports 
implicating former Government Secretary Fernando Gutierrez 
Barrios in illegal activities. He denied that Spanish media are 
waging a campaign to discredit either Mexico or its politicians. 
"I do not agree with the opinions expressed by much of the 
media, although one could surmise that they are looking for the 
reasons behind the events in the country. Nevertheless, they are 
still nothing more than newspaper articles," he said. 
  "In general, there is confidence and a positive impression 
of 
Mexico abroad. Events throughout the year could have initially 
shaken the confidence of the international community, but the 
country's opening process, the signing of the free trade 
agreement, and Mexico's recent inclusion in the OECD are proof 
that this process is irreversible. All of these factors 
increase confidence that Mexico is a sure bet for the future," 
Azua added. 
  Remarking on his visit, Azua Mendia said an agreement was 
reached with Finance Secretary Pedro Aspe to operate a Basque 
financial institution once the secretariat establishes the norms 
for foreign bank operations in Mexico. Azua also spoke with 
Foreign Secretary Manuel Tello, with whom he discussed relations 
between Spain and Mexico, particularly trade and the 
possibilities for foreign investment raised by NAFTA.

  [Excerpt] Chetumal, Mexico, 22 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- The Mexican 
Navy rescued 94 Cubans after the Cubans' boat, which had drifted 
for several days, ran aground on the Banco Chinchorro reef area 
in southern Quintana Roo State. 
  Roberto Erales Jimenez, under secretary of the state 
government, said the group, composed of 47 men, 27 women, and 20 
children, sailed from Puerto Tuna, Cuba, on 15 April aboard the 
30-foot boat "Casilda 27." 
  Governor Mario Villanueva Madrid reported that the Cubans 
were rescued by Navy members, who helped them get to the village 
of Mahahual, some 45 km east of Chetumal, where they were given 
medical assistance and food. The governor said the Mexican 
immigration authorities issued them a permit to stay on Mexican 
territory until next Sunday. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Mexico City, 23 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- The Cuban Embassy 
in Mexico has reported that Alfredo Alfonso Guillin Zelaya, an 
official of the Cuban Education Ministry, died of a heart attack 
during a working visit to Chihuahua State in northern Mexico. 
  Guillin, who was of Mexican origin, died at the age of 57 on 
Friday and his remains will be transferred to Cuba, the embassy 
reported in a communique in which they stated they had sent 
their condolences to relatives in Cuba and Mexico. 
  Guillin had come to Mexico two weeks ago at the head of a 
three-member delegation from the Cuban Education Ministry. "The 
official was due to return to Cuba today (Saturday) at the end 
of his mission," an embassy spokesman said. 
  Guillin was 19 years old in December 1956 when he embarked 
on 
an expedition aboard a yacht that departed from the Mexican port 
of Tuxpan, Veracruz State, bound for Cuba to begin an armed 
struggle that ended in January 1959 with the rebel triumph. The 
expedition was led by Cuban President Fidel Castro.

<F P=106> [Statement by Armando Calderon Sol, presidential candidate </F>
for the Nationalist Republic Alliance, in San Salvador -- live] 
  [Text] Thank you very much for this great opportunity to 
address the Salvadoran people through Radio Cadena YSKL to tell 
them that today is a historic day for El Salvador. It is a day 
when the Salvadoran people, with their vote, support -- 
necessary support -- marking the path that El Salvador must 
follow. In this sense, the democratic process is being 
consolidated. Peace is also being consolidated. We are 
attaining that blessed stability El Salvador needs for 
development and progress and to provide the help we need, the 
help thousands upon thousands of Salvadoran brothers need. 
  I wish to invite the Salvadoran people to cast their vote. 
Let us express and consolidate our strongest wishes for the 
consolidation of democracy and peace. This process will be part 
of our history. It is a historical process in which, for the 
first time, Salvadorans who had never believed or participated 
in the democratic process are now participating. This 
participation has made these elections historical and the 
process has become historical. 
  El Salvador is setting new standards. El Salvador is setting 
new standards for plural participation. We are establishing 
pluralism, which is possible with this democracy we are 
building, to which each of us are contributing. 
  I wish to ask the people to vote. Only by voting can we 
ensure the future of our children. Only with our vote can we 
ensure progress, welfare, development, and improved standards of 
living so greatly needed in El Salvador. Only in this manner 
can we ensure better and clearer institutions for the good of 
all Salvadorans. 
  I can see that all is going well. The guidelines established 
by the Supreme Electoral Tribunal are working. The people are 
finding that voting is much easier today. The voting tables 
have been set up in alphabetical order. Getting information is 
much easier today. No one should refrain from casting his vote. 
We must all express our sovereign will. It is not possible to 
refrain from participating; it is not possible to remain 
isolated; it is not possible to refrain from voting when it is 
our marvelous duty to express our wishes. Let the countries and 
peoples see the democracy the Salvadorans are proudly building. 
  Onward, fellow countrymen. Onward, Salvadoran people. Let 
us all vote and express our sovereign will. 
  Thank you for this opportunity you have given me to call on 
the people and to tell them that all is going nicely, and we 
hope it will remain so. We hope there will be nothing for us to 
regret. This is a civic feast. This is a feast for all 
Salvadorans to celebrate with the joy, with that flavor the 
Salvadoran people give to all these great events.

  [Text] San Salvador, 24 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- Ruben Zamora, 
presidential candidate for the leftist coalition, here today 
said that he is worried by the poor turnout of voters this 
morning when the voting sites opened. 
  "Very early this morning I toured the city and saw that the 
turnout of voters was poor and this worries me," Zamora said. 
Zamora is the presidential candidate for the leftist coalition 
headed by the former rebel Farabundo Marti National Liberation 
Front (FMLN). "I ask the Salvadorans to think of what is 
happening and to go and vote," Zamora said when calling on the 
2.7 million registered voters to consider the importance this 
election has on the future of the country and to go out and cast 
their vote. 
  The presidential candidate admitted that the electoral 
authorities corrected the mistakes reported during the first 
election held on 20 March. At that time, none of the parties 
that participated in the election attained the necessary 
majority -- half plus one of the votes cast -- to become 
president of the Republic. For this reason, the Supreme 
Electoral Tribunal [TSE] called for a run-off election between 
the two leading candidates. 
  Thus, Zamora and Nationalist Republican Alliance [ARENA] 
candidate Armando Calderon Sol confronted each other today to 
decide which of the two will be president for the 1994-1999 term. 
  Zamora has said that the experience gained in the first 
round 
made it possible for the coalition to be more alert at voting 
sites and prevent irregularities and fraud attempts. 
  The TSE called the 2.7 million citizens with voting rights 
to 
go to the 381 voting sites, spread throughout the country's 262 
municipalities. The election started at 0700 local (1300 GMT) 
and will close at 1700 (2300 GMT). The TSE expects to release 
the results of at least 30 percent of the vote four hours after 
closing time.

<F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister General Humberto Corado </F>
Figueroa by unidentified reporter at a polling station at the 
International Fair Grounds in San Salvador on 24 April -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Reporter] General Corado, what can you tell us 
about the election? 
  [Corado] I came here to cast my vote and try to assess the 
Salvadoran people's participation in this run-off election, 
where I think there will be a clear winner. 
  [Reporter] What about the number of people participating? 
  [Corado] The number of voters is considerable. There are 
some differences between this and the 20 March election. There 
are fewer voting stations here at the Fair, but their 
distribution is better. The election is taking place more 
quickly, which will result in the process concluding sooner. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] 
  [Corado] No irregularities have been reported to us so far, 
either at the voting sites or the electoral process in general. 
  [Reporter] Did you cast your vote already? 
  [Corado] I am going to so at this very moment. [words 
indistinct]

<F P=106> [Report by Fausto Guzman] </F>
  [Text] We are now in Pasaquina, La Union Department, where 
disturbances have been reported. At 1245 a ballot box was 
invalidated. We now have a statement by alternate deputy for 
the department of [three-second break in reception] for Radio 
Cadena YSKL. 
  [Begin unidentified alternate deputy recording] Thank you. 
First I would like to thank YSKL for the opportunity to address 
the Salvadoran people to state my [four-second break in 
reception] of the city of Pasaquina at 1245 today. The members 
of the Democratic Convergence-Farabundo Marti National 
Liberation Front [CD-FMLN] coalition withdrew from all 23 
polling stations without any explanation. 
  Their only pretext was that they had discovered that a man 
-- 
who they claim was Honduran -- had already voted and was 
carrying an electoral card. They said they were going to 
withdraw from all the polling stations for that reason. The 
president of the Municipal Electoral Board, who is also the 
coalition's representative, also withdrew. However, because of 
pressure from the Supreme Electoral Tribunal, from Onusal [UN 
Observer Mission for El Salvador], and from the secretary of the 
Municipal Electoral Board, a dialogue was held two hours after 
these gentlemen withdrew. The gentlemen from the Municipal 
Electoral Board were unable to reach an agreement because they 
claim that there had been fraud. 
  They have criticized the installation of the orientation 
center of the Nationalist Republic Alliance, ARENA, in front of 
the central park in this city. They claim that votes were being 
bought and sold at this orientation center and that fraud was 
being committed, which is not true. When we saw that they were 
trying to accuse our party, ARENA, we invited Onusal and other 
observers from the United States and other countries to see for 
themselves that the orientation center was being used to help 
illiterate people vote. We all know that the percentage of 
illiterate people in our country is high. All we were doing at 
the orientation center was asking people for their 
identification cards, looking for their names on the electoral 
lists, and then telling them where they were supposed to vote 
and where their voting table was. The people of Pasaquina came 
out to vote. They showed that they wanted to participate. Only 
they know which candidate they are electing for the presidency 
and the vice presidency. [end recording]

  [Text] [Beltran] Attention, National Civilian Police. Your 
presence is urgently required at the Cuscatanzingo Municipal 
Electoral Board. We have reports that riots have just broken 
out. Go ahead, Cuscatanzingo. 
  [Iraheta] We have had some problems here following the 
conclusion of the final vote count for this municipality. The 
Nationalist Republican Alliance [ARENA] won 46 of the 49 ballot 
boxes. 
  [Beltran] Do you have a total vote count? 
  [Iraheta] No, we do not have a total vote count. The problem 
occurred as we left the voting station. We were attacked by the 
hordes of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front [FMLN]. 
  [Beltran] What happened? 
  [Iraheta] A girl received a serious blow to the head. 
  [Beltran] Do you need an ambulance to move her? 
  [Iraheta] She has already been taken to the hospital. Her 
name is Maria Victoria Santos Garcia. 
  [Beltran] Maria Victoria Santos Garcia. How old is she? 
  [Iraheta] I do not know. Three other party members were 
attacked after that. Somebody shot at them with some kind of 
short weapon. Fortunately they were not hit, but it was still a 
precarious moment for them. We would like to call on the 
Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE] and the FMLN to remember that 
democracy prevails now. Acts of violence and repression are 
things of the past. We wish to call on these people to truly 
join the democratic process by accepting ARENA's nationwide 
victory. Thank you. 
  [Beltran] Thank you for your report.

  [Text] San Salvador, 24 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- The Salvadoran 
presidential elections ended at 1700 local (2300 GMT) today, the 
Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE] reported. 
  The elections, which began at 0700 (1300 GMT), were 
characterized by voter apathy and low turnout, the extent of 
which has not yet been estimated. 
  The TSE called upon all 2.7 million citizens eligible to 
vote 
to do so and installed 381 voting centers in 262 municipalities 
throughout the entire country. 
  Once the polling stations closed, the TSE immediately began 
receiving the vote count certificates at the official vote 
counting center located in a luxury hotel in San Salvador. 
  The TSE authorities announced this afternoon that the first 
preliminary report will be announced after 30 percent of the 
votes cast are counted.

<F P=106> [Statement by members of the Salvadoran Supreme Electoral </F>
Tribunal, TSE, from the TSE Headquarters at the Hotel Presidente 
in San Salvador -- live] 
  [Text] [TSE President Luis Arturo Zaldivar] We [word 
indistinct] announce within the legal framework; that is, 
today's elections have been a total success. We Salvadorans 
have expressed our absolute respect for the law, and those who 
have not done so are now suffering the consequences of their 
negative attitude. In that respect, we can tell you that on my 
instructions and by virtue of the legal authority I possess as 
TSE president, the National Civilian Police arrested Jose 
Antonio Ramirez in Jucuapa Municipality, Usulutan Department. 
Ramirez was arrested when members of voting table boards No. 
4,205 and 4,214 in Jucuapa confirmed that he committed fraud by 
voting twice. 
  The elections have taken place in an orderly fashion. The 
other TSE magistrates will now give you further details. 
  [TSE Magistrate Jaime Romero Ventura] The logistical 
measures 
taken by the TSE to ensure the success of this electoral event 
are as follows: There was free movement of individuals and 
vehicles. There were selective checks of individuals entering 
polling stations. Thus there was security but voters were able 
to move about unimpeded. We increased the number of polling 
stations at a national level, especially in the capital. The 
number of voting table boards per polling station was reduced, 
thus allowing the elections to be held in an easy, rapid manner. 
The voters were able to move about with greater flexibility. 
In conclusion, we had an effective sign system that helped 
voters find their voting tables quickly. 
  [Unidentified magistrate] In addition to the measures to 
which Magistrate Romero Ventura has referred, the TSE worked to 
assist voters by issuing the necessary publications to locate 
and identify polling centers by number and letter to help voters 
find them more quickly. We published a list for each polling 
station with the first and last names of all voters to help them 
find their voting table. We set up a telephone information line 
so citizen could call and ask questions about the voting 
process. We arranged free urban and rural transportation. We 
also obtained the cooperation of the transportation 
organizations, which allowed the normal flow of traffic on 
election day. We also tried to create an information system 
through information centers at principal polling stations and 
with the cooperation of the participating political parties to 
help voters find their tables so they could exercise their 
sacred right to vote. 
  These are some of the measures that contributed to the 
success of today's elections. 
  [Zaldivar] As we begin this initial report issued by the 
TSE, we must first recognize the efforts of all our personnel, 
who have unselfishly gone out to complete the many tasks this 
election day has required. It is an honor to state that TSE 
personnel did their work enthusiastically both during the first 
election and now during this run-off election. The TSE would 
also like to recognize the National Civilian Police, which, in 
conjunction with the TSE, provided security for the election 
process. They also provided security in those places where the 
National Police had no personnel for the elections. We must 
also recognize the cooperation of other government agencies, 
such as the Education Ministry. Without their help we would not 
have been able to improve the distribution of the polling 
stations across the country. In this same vein, we received 
assistance from the Agricultural Development Bank and the 
Association of Architects of El Salvador, who helped us with the 
signs and distribution at the voting stations as well as with 
posters, shelves, and so on. 
  We must also recognize that we have had the assistance of 
the 
Salvadoran Air Force, which will make it easier to bring you the 
results. We also give special recognition to the assistance we 
have had from international organizations such as USAID, the 
Electoral Advice and Promotion Center [CAPEL], several UN 
organizations, and the group of friends of El Salvador, who have 
all made enormous contributions to the success of this process. 
  [Romero] People of El Salvador, I will now address that 
pertaining to the preliminary and final tallying process. 
Regarding the preliminary results, we would like to state that 
the TSE is ready to gather and process the information and 
announce the results quite quickly. We have set up an entire 
logistical structure for that purpose. Just as in the 20 March 
elections, we have TSE representatives in each of the 262 
municipalities throughout the country who will gather the 
tallying sheets immediately. We will gather the information via 
fax from 220 of the 262 municipalities that have less than 36 
voting stations. This information must be sent to us by the 
municipal electoral board, which groups all the voting stations 
in the municipality. We will receive the information 
immediately. The information can be here in a minute. 
  We will collect each of the other 42 municipalities' voting 
station tally sheets and bring them to the Hotel Presidente by 
land or by air, thanks to the assistance of the Air Force 
helicopter. The Agricultural Promotion Bank's fleet of vehicles 
has been very useful in this task. 
  We have the computer equipment to tally and immediately 
process all the vote count certificates we receive. It is up to 
the voting table boards and the Municipal Election Boards made 
up of the representatives of the participating political party 
and coalition to provide us with that information. Once we 
receive that information, we will be able to immediately report 
the results. I must inform you that at this hour, at 1900, we 
are already receiving some vote count certificates via fax. The 
time to begin transmitting news briefs as well as the amount of 
information we may provide will depend on the Municipal Election 
Board and the voting table boards. We are prepared and trained 
to provide such information immediately. Moreover, we have 
drafted the instructions for the final vote count, which 
basically state the following: 
  The TSE, in agreement with ARENA [Nationalist Republican 
Alliance] and the CD-FMLN [Democratic Convergence-Farabundo 
Marti National Liberation Front] coalition, has decided that the 
TSE will be responsible for conducting the final vote count as 
stated in the electoral code. The final vote count will be 
based on vote count certificates from the voting table boards 
and the Municipal Election Boards. The figures we receive 
during the preliminary vote count will serve as a guide. The 
objective we have for the final vote count is to inform the 
people of the results of the presidential and vice presidential 
elections in an accurate and timely manner. 
  To achieve this, we have a procedure for how the final vote 
count will take place. Three members of the Departmental 
Election Board, two ARENA representatives, two CD-FMLN coalition 
representatives, a delegate from the Attorney General's Office, 
an Onusal [UN Observers for El Salvador] observer, a table 
executive appointed by the TSE, a visiting technician appointed 
by the TSE, and, in San Salvador Department, two technicians and 
a secretary appointed by the TSE will participate in the final 
vote count. 
  The table executive will be a member of the TSE and will be 
appointed from among our personnel. They will be in charge of 
managing and coordinating the working tables. These working 
tables will begin work on Tuesday, 26 April, from 0800 to 1200, 
from 1400 to 1800, and from 2000 to 2400 every day. The 
procedure will be to make an inventory, municipality by 
municipality, of the original vote count certificates from the 
voting table boards and the Departmental Election Board as well 
as from those in the hands of ARENA, the CD-FMLN coalition, and 
the Attorney General's Office. This will allow us to have an 
accurate knowledge of all the information. We are going to 
initiate the vote count, municipality by municipality, in order. 
We are going to draft a form for the data received from the 
voting table boards. This form must be signed by the table 
members and the representatives of the Attorney General's 
Office. Once this form is signed, we will conduct the 
appropriate [word indistinct] and if the table members want a 
partial copy of the results, they can have it. Once the data 
received from the voting table boards is processed, we will 
release the information received from each voting table board 
and the total for each municipality. A copy in diskette of the 
municipal figures will be entered into a computer that will give 
us the national total. Once the vote count per department is 
completed, we are going to release the departmental total. The 
TSE will learn about the totals of the various municipalities 
and of the departments once the results are approved by the 
Departmental Election Board. The results will be turned over to 
the table executive, a member of the TSE. 
  Requests for recounts of ballot boxes as approved by the 
Departmental Election Board will be turned over to the TSE, 
which will initiate the steps to review the situation and 
determine if the review is valid or not. That is how we will do 
the final vote count. 
  [Zaldivar] The TSE wishes to express its recognition of the 
civic spirit and democratic calling demonstrated by our dear 
Salvadoran people. We also want to recognize the work done by 
participating political parties, both in the first round and in 
these run-off elections. We also call on the media to respect 
the law and refrain from giving election results before the TSE 
gives its results [three-second break in reception]. Finally, 
we want to make an urgent call to members of the Municipal 
Election Boards and members of the voting table boards to allow 
our TSE delegates to pick up copies of the vote count 
certificates and send them to us through the previously 
established channels. When this is done we will be able to 
inform the national and international community of the results 
of this historic event in our dear country. 
  Salvadoran people, good evening.

  [Cristiani] We must not necessarily view it as the people 
either liking or disliking the FMLN. The people simply 
preferred another political force. We must realize that there 
are always some people who receive more votes than others and

  [Cristiani] We have had reports of some irregularities. 
Generally speaking, everything went very well. There was one

have to check that out, but I do not think it will affect the 
elections.

<F P=106> [News conference by Armando Calderon Sol, ARENA, Nationalist </F>
Republican Alliance, presidential candidate, and Enrique Borgo 
Bustamante, vice presidential candidate, with unidentified 
reporters at the Hotel Presidente in San Salvador -- live] 
  [Text] [Calderon] Thanks very much, gentlemen of the media. 
First I want to thank [words indistinct] the huge challenge that 
is the [word indistinct] challenge of my life. I want to thank 
Salvadorans and tell them that we will not let them down in the 
historic challenge of bringing the nation closer every day to 
achieve the social peace that will help consolidate peace, 
democracy, freedom, and justice in El Salvador. We [words 
indistinct] of this clear and [word indistinct] Salvadorans have 
bestowed upon us in these historic elections. We commit 
ourselves to serve all Salvadorans. We want to thank ARENA's 
rank and file, our supporters, all our collaborators, and the 
thousands and thousands of volunteers nationwide who worked hard 
for this civic event and made possible this great and 
extraordinary victory, this victory for Salvadorans, this 
victory for all. 
  I want to thank and congratulate our opponent, Dr. Ruben 
Zamora, who has already publicly acknowledged our victory, thus 
showing political stature and refinement. I want to thank him 
for his acknowledgement and also to assure our political 
adversaries that we will govern for all Salvadorans. I want our 
adversaries to be confident from now on that we the 
president-elect and vice president-elect will govern for all 
Salvadorans. We believe our great task, our great mission is to 
consolidate peace, ensure political stability, and make El 
Salvador a better country for all Salvadorans. We will seek 
better standards of living for thousands and thousands of 
Salvadorans who need human progress and development. We must 
face the problems of underdevelopment and poverty together. I 
would like to thank you all for this news coverage and the way 
you have followed the Salvadoran democratic process. I 
reiterate: Long live El Salvador! This victory belongs to El 
Salvador and its democratic system, which is growing stronger 
every day. I would like to tell all Salvadorans that we are 
going to work hand in hand with you for the next five years. I 
thank you all very much. 
  [Borgo] First we would like to express our gratitude to all 
those Salvadoran brothers who trusted us and placed an enormous 
responsibility in our hands. Among those people, I would like 
to give special thanks to the ARENA members [words indistinct] 
and all those Salvadorans who voted for us. We must now ask God 
for help to attain the goals we have set and for strength to 
work for the Salvadoran people. I would like to thank the media 
[words indistinct], which has given us coverage throughout the 
presidential campaign. We hope you can project the true image 
of what we Salvadorans are all about: A nation which loves 
democracy and freedom and is convinced that the only road to 
progress is through social peace. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] 
  [Calderon] As you know, we do not have any official results 
from the Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE]. Our computer center 
shows a significant trend. We would rather not give any figures 
at this time because the TSE has not approved them. We do know 
that this is a stunning and undeniable victory with a difference 
of more than two to one. I believe, however, that the TSE must 
report the numbers, because ours are not official. It would be 
better to wait for the TSE's official information. Our 
democracy guarantees participation for Ruben Zamora and the 
opposition forces. A specific and significant portion of the 
Salvadoran population has trusted them and given them an 
unquestionable political place in the Legislative Assembly 
[words indistinct]. In our democratic life, we seek 
participation for everyone. We seek the right degree of 
consensus and acceptance. We seek agreement. Parliamentary 
debate is precisely that. The government will respect and 
encourage participation. It will listen to whatever proposals a 
constructive opposition can offer. We are sure that this is the 
way it will work, and we are sure all Salvadorans will have a 
say in the country's future. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] 
  [Calderon] We will deal with poverty as it has been dealt 
with so far, with a series of social programs that we have 
already defined in our government plan. I think it would take 
too long to get into that matter during this news conference. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] 
  [Borgo] Our government will be made up of Salvadorans who 
love El Salvador and who have the capability and honesty to 
occupy a public post efficiently to bring the country forward. 
When we start putting our government team together, I am sure 
we will seek out the most capable people so we can face the 
country's problems together as a real team. There will be a 
truly effective combination of specialists and politicians. I 
believe we have the enormous responsibility to find the most 
capable individuals in our society. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] 
  [Calderon] We have a commitment and a mandate to form an 
ARENA administration. That does not mean the administration 
wants to exclude the opposition. They have a specific role in 
the democratic system. [words indistinct] 
  My first step will be to ensure [words indistinct] of the 
peace agreements, which constitute a national commitment, a 
commitment by all organizations that guarantee peace and 
security in the country. That is why as president-elect I will 
go to New York to meet with the UN secretary general to ensure 
that the future of the peace agreements and the country's 
political stability [words indistinct]. I want to dedicate our 
victory to Salvadorans, because it is a victory for El Salvador. 
This victory commits us to God, and we ask him to give us 
humility; humility in our triumph, strength, sovereignty, and 
wisdom in this difficult struggle that awaits us in the coming 
five years. Our mission will be to improve the standard of 
living for Salvadorans. I offer this victory to Salvadorans 
because it belongs to them. It is a victory for all 
Salvadorans. We believe this election will serve as an historic 
example in the life of a nation that perseveres. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] 
  [Calderon] Political, labor, and social forces and 
productive 
small and intermediate business sectors joined in these run-off 
elections. I would say that, on the contrary, these run-off 
elections strengthened our party. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] 
  [Calderon] Our commitment to the nation will be to keep 
[word 
indistinct] and to comply with the peace agreements. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] 
  [Calderon] I believe [words indistinct] the acceptance of 
governability. I am confident that with my untiring effort -- 
because I will not stop -- we will achieve better levels of 
development, progress, and social stability for Salvadorans. We 
will achieve the objectives you mentioned. That will be the 
greatest satisfaction of my life; to have accomplished the 
mission with which Salvadorans have entrusted me. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] 
  [Calderon] [Words indistinct] won a political place in El 
Salvador. This has been confirmed by the peace agreements 
[words indistinct]. We Salvadorans have achieved peace [words 
indistinct]. Now we must achieve social peace, the 
reorganization and development of our motherland. This is a 
huge and profound challenge that involves not just me but all 
Salvadorans. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct]. 
  [Calderon] It is a commitment, especially for all Central 
Americans, to work and strive for regional integration. We 
will use our work and willingness to seek greater levels of 
integration, not only in economic aspects but also in political 
and social aspects. Central America is one, and we will 
translate our will as Salvadorans -- a unified people -- into 
doing all we can to work toward true integration, especially in 
Central America. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] 
  [Calderon] We are willing to negotiate. We are willing to 
seek the truth, regardless of who is affected. We will strictly 
apply the law and seek to strengthen [words indistinct], whoever 
it might be -- the joint commission or any other group -- in 
search of any solution to implement the law. We will be there 
because only then will we achieve justice and have the nation we 
all want. This is the only way we can gradually consolidate the 
state of law we all want in El Salvador. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] 
  [Calderon] Look, there is no reason for anyone to point 
fingers at me. I am sure of all of my actions and I know my 
political career is a true example, which is why the Salvadoran 
people have given me their support and their trust on this 
wonderful day. Today the entire Salvadoran nation has seen, 
spoken to, and trusted this humble servant of yours. I think 
this is a reward for my continuing efforts on the political 
scene. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] 
  [Calderon] There is only one ARENA project. I also believe 
there are valuable people in the government already, and I will 
surely take some of the present government's people into 
account. They will be the most capable people; those who can 
contribute the most to the country and the project. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] 
  [Calderon] I believe the political campaign is over now. We 
must enforce the law and consolidate the state of law in El 
Salvador. Separating the powers of state will help guarantee 
that. We will have a judicial branch, which we already have. We 
have a legislative branch, the first authority, and an executive 
branch. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] 
  [Calderon] We have an appointment in New York on 15 May 
before the inauguration ceremonies, when we will meet with 
[words indistinct]. 
  [Announcer] President-elect Armando Calderon Sol and Vice 
President-elect Enrique Borgo Bustamante have concluded their 
news conference.

  [Text] San Salvador, 24 Apr (DPA) -- Salvadoran President 
Alfredo Cristiani said today that the peace agreements will be 
virtually fulfilled in their entirety before 1 June -- the day 
the winner of today's run-off presidential elections will take 
office. 
  Armando Calderon Sol, presidential candidate for the 
official 
Nationalist Republican Alliance [ARENA], or Ruben Zamora, 
candidate for the leftist coalition Farabundo Marti National 
Liberation Front, Democratic Convergence, and National 
Revolutionary Movement [FMLN-CD-MNR], will assume the Presidency 
of the Republic in 37 days. 
  President Cristiani noted that by the end of his term, only 
a 
portion of the total list of commitments regarding the National 
Police demobilization and land transfers for the demobilized 
military and former guerrillas will be pending. 
  President Cristiani made this statement following a visit 
this afternoon to the El Salvador's International Fair Grounds, 
his assigned voting site. 
  President Cristiani reiterated his government's willingness 
to comply fully with the peace agreements since the signing of 
the Chapultepec Agreements in Mexico on 16 January 1992. 
  He also stated that despite the difficulties the main 
objective remains full compliance with the commitments that 
ended the 12-year war. 
  The government is confident that the new president will 
continue to comply with those parts of the peace agreements that 
are pending as well as with the efforts to consolidate peace, 
reconciliation, and democratization in El Salvador. 
  The low voter turnout became obvious today during the 
mid-afternoon. These run-off elections have been characterized 
by low turnout alone because, according to the Supreme Electoral 
Tribunal magistrates, 85 percent of the deficiencies observed 
during the 20 March general elections were overcome. 
  A heavy rain exacerbated the low voter turnout because 
although most voting tables are sheltered, voters were dispersed 
even more than in the previous elections. 
  There were reports of several clashes between ARENA and 
FMLN-CD-MNR coalition supporters at the polls but no mention of 
any serious incidents. 
  Political analysts and the wives of the leftist coalition 
candidates emphasized that the issue is not who wins the 
elections but that "everyone accepts the results maturely." 
  Magdalena Granadino de Lima, wife of Francisco Lima -- vice 
presidential candidate for the leftist coalition -- emphasized 
that unity and national consensus must prevail among the 
political forces to guarantee the consolidation of peace, 
national reconciliation, and democratization.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 23 Apr (ACAN-EFE) -- The legislative 
elections scheduled for 4 August [date as received] in Guatemala 
were temporarily suspended after the Supreme Court of Justice 
(CSJ) approved an amparo filed by Deputy Carlos Humberto 
Arroyave. 
  The Solidarity Action Movement (MAS) legislator, who held a 
seat during deposed coupist President Jorge Serrano's 
(1991-1993) administration, claimed that the call for elections 
violated his political rights. 
  In confirming the temporary suspension of the electoral 
process, a Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE) magistrate said 
today that his organization accepts but does not share the CSJ 
ruling.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 23 Apr (ACAN-EFE) -- Today 
Guatemalan President Ramiro De Leon Carpio reiterated his 
confidence that legislative elections scheduled for 14 August 
will be held accordingly. De Leon told the media that the 
temporary suspension of the elections by a Supreme Court of 
Justice resolution is "temporary," and that the Constitutional 
Court will be the one to resolve the case definitively once it 
is submitted. 
  De Leon did not make any comments on whether or not the 
Supreme Court of Justice decision to protect Solidarity Action 
Movement deputy Carlos Humberto Arroyave was a political one. "I 
respect the autonomy of government branches," De Leon replied. 
  De Leon added that from an electoral viewpoint, the amparo 
Arroyave filed charging that the Supreme Electoral Tribunal 
violated his rights by convening legislative elections on 14 
August has political overtones since he is a congressional 
deputy. De Leon indicated that those actions are allowed within 
a system of legality and a de jure regime and that the Court 
resolution shows that legal and democratic systems are at work 
in Guatemala. De Leon expressed his confidence in the integrity 
of Court magistrates, who convened elections based on legal 
considerations and in accordance with constitutional reforms. 
  Political leaders, including retired General Efrain Rios 
Montt, former head of the de facto government, and Francisco 
Reyes, both of whom are members of the Guatemalan Republican 
Front, maintain that the Court resolution was political because 
the magistrates do not want to leave their posts either. 
  Following the election of a new legislative assembly, new 
Court magistrates will be appointed.

  [Text] The Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity [URNG] 
organization yesterday accused Defense Minister General Mario 
Enriquez of threatening the organization and violating the 
recently signed agreements between the government and the 
insurgents. 
  According to a CERIGUA report, Francisco Villagran, member 
of 
the URNG's political-diplomatic commission, said: Gen. 
Enriquez is failing to comply with the signed agreements by 
warning that any guerrilla leader who comes into the country 
will be immediately arrested and prosecuted. 
  Enriquez made this statement on 18 April as he commented on 
the possibility that guerrilla leaders may come to Guatemala to 
participate in the second peace and democracy meeting, to be 
held in late April. 
  Villagran said that the minister's statements are also a 
threat, because the URNG is interested in working with the 
civilian sectors, especially because its proposals will be taken 
into account when reaching an agreement at the negotiating table. 
  The guerrillas believe that the government and the Army, 
instead of implementing the recently signed agreements, are 
conducting an active campaign of disinformation on the 
agreements' contents. In addition, the guerrillas reported that 
there is a destabilization plan aimed at hindering the 
negotiation process. 
  The guerrillas also demanded the government comply with the 
Human Rights General Agreement strictly and without any delays 
and harshly punish those who try to destabilize the situation.

  [Text] Tegucigalpa, 22 Apr (AFP) -- Hundreds of 
demonstrators protested this Friday against President Carlos 
Roberto Reina, whom they accuse of continuing during his first 
three months in office the neoliberal economic policies of the 
former administration of Rafael Callejas. 
  In this first demonstration against the administration that 
took office on 27 January, the marchers demanded measures to 
counter the high cost of living and an end to mandatory military 
service, one of the promises Reina made during his election 
campaign. 
  Upon taking office, Reina asked Hondurans for 100 days to 
organize measures that would give a "human face" to the economic 
adjustment program and which would diminish the protagonistic 
role of the military in state affairs. 
  The demonstrators accused Reina of not keeping his promises 
and demanded a price freeze to halt inflation, which increased 7 
percent in three months; reactivation of the agrarian reform; 
and land grants to peasants. 
  Rafael Alegria of the National Federation of Rural Workers 
gave a speech saying that Reina must change the economic 
policies inherited from the former administration. 
  Juan Almendarez, a pacifist leader, demanded a dialogue with 
the government and popular sectors to unify support against 
"pressure from international organizations" of credit which 
demand the economic adjustment measures. He warned that "if 
urgent measures are not taken, there may be social instability" 
in Honduras.

  [Text] Tegucigalpa, 22 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- After issuing an 
emergency decree on Thursday, President Carlos Roberto Reina 
said today that he hopes to overcome the three-month energy 
crisis affecting his country in 60 days. He said he hopes the 
measures taken to resolve the energy crisis throughout the 
nation will be effective and will end the constant power 
rationing to which people have been subjected. The measures 
include purchasing electricity from countries such as Panama, 
which began sending 13 megawatts through the Central American 
interconnection system this Friday for an initial period of 
three months at a cost of $3.8 million. A power-generating barge 
will be leased and will arrive in the coming days in the 
northern port of Puerto Cortes. Private plants will also be used 
to generate electricity. 
  According to official reports from the National Enterprise 
for Electric Power (ENEE), the country's daily deficit is over 
80 megawatts, which has prompted the creation of a rationing 
schedule. Reina appealed to the people to conserve energy while 
the crisis is overcome. "I am working as hard as I can so the 
Honduran people will not suffer so much with these problems," he 
added. 
  Also, he said the state will collect $26 million in arrears 
maintained by "wealthy" businessmen for several years with the 
ENEE, which might help to solve the current problem. "To achieve 
this, we must cut down on our energy use. It is time for people 
to help solve the crisis," the president stated. The current 
energy crisis is the result of a lack of water at the Francisco 
Morazan hydroelectric plant, the country's largest such plant, 
which supplies 63 percent of national demand. According to the 
same sources, a lack of foresight by previous governments and 
neglected maintenance of the thermoelectric plants that also 
generate power are also to blame for the problem. 
  The government trusts that Central American countries, like 
Nicaragua and Costa Rica, will supply electricity to Honduras, 
but these nations have reported that they also face problems 
because of the drought.

  [Text] Managua, 22 Apr (ACAN-EFE) -- Today, Friday, the 
Nicaraguan Government Ministry confirmed it has ordered the 
arrest of U.S. citizen John Hull, a naturalized Costa Rican 
citizen. Hull has several criminal charges pending in Costa 
Rica and is believed to be in Nicaragua, although his 
whereabouts are unknown. 
  Today, an official spokesman said the police began an 
investigation to locate the 74-year old Hull, who is charged 
with attacking anti-Sandinist guerrilla leader Eden Pastora in a 
place called La Penca on the Nicaraguan border 10 years ago. 
Hull, who is also accused of drug trafficking and supplying arms 
to the former Nicaraguan contras, fled Costa Rica to the United 
States several years ago, according to Costa Rican newspaper 
sources. 
  Today, BARRICADA published a report that Hull arrived in 
Nicaragua on 17 February through El Espino customs checkpoint on 
the Honduran border and that he is currently living on a cattle 
ranch near Juigalpa in the central Department of Chontales. 
  Even though police authorities have confirmed Hull's arrest 
warrant, a Nicaraguan Foreign Ministry spokesman told ACAN-EFE 
that the Costa Rican Government still has not requested 
extradition of the American, who is now a naturalized Costa 
Rican citizen. On Monday, Costa Rican President Rafael Angel 
Calderon Fournier reported that his government sent a note to 
the U.S. authorities requesting Hull's extradition.

  [Text] Sources at the Nicaragua Foreign Ministry have said 
it is expected U.S. aid to Nicaragua will decline over time 
because, beginning in 1995, the United States will channel its 
foreign aid to our country through multilateral financial 
organizations, such as the IMF and the World Bank. It should be 
noted the United States has a lot of influence in the 
aforementioned multilateral institutions. 
  The Foreign Ministry sources, however, explained the 
$57-million aid package for the 1995 fiscal year is not 
definitive, but responds to tentative programs. The Nicaraguan 
Government has reiterated the country will not live eternally on 
international aid, adding that is why it is necessary to 
increase production in Nicaragua.

<F P=106> [Report by Jose Otero and Vilma Figueroa] </F>
  [Text] Foreign Minister Jose Raul Mulino has described as 
"unfortunate" U.S. Senator John Kerry's recent statements 
harshly criticizing the Panamanian Government's lack of 
cooperation with the United States in curbing drug trafficking. 
  Kerry, a Democratic senator from the state of Massachusetts 
and chairman of the U.S. Senate's hearings on terrorism, 
narcotics, and international crime, stated last Saturday that 
although "organized" crime prevailed in Panama during the regime 
of former General Manuel Antonio Noriega, "disorganized" crime 
now persists under the Guillermo Endara administration. 
  Mulino, who recently traveled to the Vatican and Russia on 
diplomatic visits, pointed out to Radio KW Continente that he 
believes Kerry's statements are `unfortunate' that they should 
not be interpreted as originating from the U.S. Government. The 
foreign minister also stressed that the U.S. senator's 
statements "have not been very prudent." 
  Mulino explained: "The entire world is aware of the efforts 
we have made, despite our government's economic and human 
resource limitations, to straighten out what Noriega left us in 
1989 after being deposed by the U.S. invasion." 
  On the other hand, the foreign minister also referred to 
statements by Robert Gelbart, deputy assistant secretary of 
state for inter-American affairs, who acknowledged Panama's 
efforts against drug trafficking and the importance of a 
high-level meeting between the two nations to discuss the issue, 
as proposed by Panama. 
  Meanwhile, legislator Leo Gonzalez admitted Panama has not 
done enough about the problem of money laundering via 
corporations, and this is where the focus of all U.S. Government 
complaints lies. According to Gonzalez, the struggle against 
drug trafficking has been tremendous, but the government has 
fallen short in combating money laundering, which is the one 
activity that ensures the drug traffickers' survival.

  According to the latest membership report, Perez Balladares, 
who is running for the "United People" alliance, has the most 
members. The alliance comprises the Democratic Revolutionary 
Party (PRD), the Labor Party (PALA) and the Liberal Republican 
Party (Libre). Mireya Moscoso de Gruber follows with her 
Democratic Alliance, which comprises the Arnulfist Party (PA), 
Liberal Party, Authentic Liberal Party (PLA), and Independent 
Democratic Union (UDI). 
  The document states that the alliance supporting Perez 
Balladares has 292,000 registered members: 180,000 in the PRD,

  The coalition backing Gruber has 229,000 supporters; 130,00 
from the PA, 47,000 from the Liberal Party, 26,000 from the PLA, 
and 31,000 from the UDI. 
  The alliance that is nipping at the heels of the front 
runners is "Change 94," which is backing the ticket of Ruben 
Dario Carles. The members are the Nationalist Liberal 
Republican Movement, National Unity Party (MOLIRENA), Civic 
Renewal Party, and National Renewal Movement (MORENA). 
According to the report, this alliance has a total of 122,000 
registered members, 47,000 from the MOLIRENA, 44,000 from the 
MORENA, and 31,000 from the Civic Renewal Party.

Lewis Galindo, has 89,000 supporters. The member parties are 
Solidarity, contributing 60,000 members, and the National Unity 
Mission with 29,000 members. 
  The other candidates have no alliance behind them. They have 
only the support of their own parties. Eduardo Vallarino of the 
Christian Democratic Party has 45,000 members, Ruben Blades and 
Papa Egoro have 29,000 members, and Jose Salvador Munoz of the 
Doctrinaire Panamenist Party has 27,000 registered party members.

newscast] 
  [Text] Ruben Dario Carles, presidential candidate for the 
Change '94 alliance, stated today that without preconditions or 
impositions an agreement can be reached for the reunification of 
the civic alliance parties to face the PRD [Democratic 
Revolutionary Party] in the 8 May elections. Professor Ruben 
Dario Carles made the statement in Veracruz during a political 
tour. 
  Sympathizers and supporters of the Morena [National Renewal 
Movement], Civic Renewal Party, and Molirena [Nationalist 
Liberal Republican Movement] parties, which comprise the Change 
'94 alliance, received presidential candidate Ruben Dario 
Carles, who toured the community of Veracruz. Carles was 
accompanied by people seeking electoral posts in Veracruz 
corregimiento, the western sector of the capital. 
  During his tour, supporters assured Professor Carles of 
their 
vote on 8 May. They also expressed concerns regarding community 
problems. The presidential candidate for Change '94, during an 
impromptu meeting, promised his government will work with the 
community to improve and clean Veracruz beach, to improve the 
roads, and to protect children from the corruption of drugs. 
Professor Carles said that without preconditions or impositions 
an agreement can be reached to form a broad civic alliance to 
confront the PRD on 8 May. 
  [Carles] We politicians must sound out the people, to seek a 
ticket to guarantee victory and to ensure Panamanians a better 
way of life. 
  [Reporter] Professor, but among the civic alliance 
candidates 
there seems to be a lack of willingness to set aside their 
political interests to form this ticket. 
  [Carles] Look, everybody cannot win. We have to use logic 
and consider what is most advisable for the country. I agree it 
must be without preconditions, without impositions, to reach an 
agreement for the good of the country. [end recording] 
  The political leaders of Veracruz, who back the Change '94 
slate expressed appreciation for the support they have received 
from the Change '94 ticket.

  [Text] Ernesto Perez Balladares, presidential candidate for 
the PRD [Democratic Revolutionary Party], said today that the 
people will vote en masse for his party, with or without an 
alliance against the PRD. Our correspondent Fernando Fernandez 
has the report: 
  [Begin recording] [Fernandez] Ernesto Perez Balladares, 
candidate of the United People alliance, toured several 
communities in the western part of Panama. He was greeted by a 
large group of supporters and persons vying for electoral posts 
in Capira District. Addressing the crowd, the presidential 
candidate said the country will return to a people-oriented 
government, with the support of all the country's productive 
forces, and based on the dynamic of private enterprise to find 
the solutions demanded by the people. 
  [Perez Balladares] We will do so united, without hate, 
without revenge, without returning to the past, with a vision of 
the future, with a commitment to future generations; a free, 
independent, sovereign country, a country where all Panamanians, 
regardless of race, color, place of birth, or place of residence 
can have, as we say, an opportunity to progress with the support 
of a friendly government. 
  [Fernandez] In his speech, Perez sent a message to all the 
presidential candidates. 
  [Perez Balladares] I want to tell all those hatemongers, 
that 
they can still climb on the winning bandwagon, because with or 
without a cassette [reference to the 14 April video shown by 
President Endara on a national television network], with or 
without Mireya [Mireya Moscosa de Gruber, Arnulfist Party 
presidential candidate], with or without unity, with or without 
Eddy [Eduardo Vallarino Arjona, Christian Democratic Party 
presidential candidate], with or without Chinchorro [Ruben Dario 
Carles, MOLIRENA presidential candidate], the people will have 
their say. [applause] 
  [Fernandez] The caravan then headed for Bejuco, where Perez 
Balladares was greeted by supporters of that community. The PRD 
presidential candidate said he will make every effort, if 
elected, to direct his government's attention to the 
agricultural sector and to the most pressing social problems of 
Panamanians. The tour, which was under tight security, included 
the towns of Chame, Cabuya, and San Carlos District. [end

<F P=106> [Article by Raul Kollmann] </F>
  [Text] "The Communist Party will not live forever." With 
this sentence one of the main PC [Communist Party] leaders 
suggested there is an ongoing process to dissolve the party in 
order to be reborn as a new leftist faction within the Grand 
Front. The basic objectives are three: rejuvenate the Communist 
identity, which has always been associated with the former 
Soviet Union's model; reduce the target for the government's 
strong McCarthyism, which had an impact inside the front; and 
concentrate on the development of the Grand Front -- not as a 
party -- taking into account the notable result of the 10 April 
election. This new force would present a battle on programs 
within the Grand Front "to defend leftist positions." PAGINA 12 
spoke with PC national and federal district leaders. In both 
cases the leaders consulted spoke about the same schedule for 
reconversion: "six months at the most." 
  According to the party's jargon, the PC's transformation is 
defined as "the establishment of a political movement within the 
Grand Front." The partners in the PC's refounding would be some 
former leaders of other factions within the Grand Front -- 
People's Encounter members and trade unionists affiliated with 
the Grand Front -- who would propound a congress for launching 
the party's refounding. 
  A leader close to PC General Secretary Patricio Echegaray 
said: "We are not disguising ourselves under false colors. The 
progressive space has become wider with the 10 April elections, 
and this would not only entail a change of name but also 
constitute a way of strengthening a left-wing trend within the 
Grand Front." 
  [Kollmann] Has the offensive against the Grand Front for 
having included the PC had a bearing on this refounding? 
  [Echegaray] It is true that some leaders were ill at ease 
because, as they contended, there were no Communists among the 
front ranks of the FG [Grand Front] ticket. Anyhow, it was 
precisely during the McCarthyist campaign when voters massively 
turned to the FG. Therefore, it is possible to state that 
nobody opted to vote for other parties instead of the FG on 
account of our presence. There are those who argue that the FG 
wants to expel us, but not a word has ever been said to that 
effect. The process that is about to start has nothing to do 
with McCarthyist pressure. 
  [Kollmann] Buenos Aires City Communists -- who are the most 
enthusiastic about dissolving the PC to establish a new movement 
-- recall two recent events that strained relations within the 
Grand Front: Echegaray was to have stood as a FG candidate in 
the Constituent Assembly elections, but FG leaders vetoed his 
candidacy. Following a tense meeting at the Communist Central 
Committee, the party acquiesced to the FG's demand and Echegaray 
was replaced by Eduardo Barcesat, who was then elected to the 
Constituent Assembly. The other conflict arose from the calling 
of a PC rally to close the election campaign last 5 April. 
Buenos Aires Communist leaders opposed the rally and some of 
them did not even go to the Swiss House, where the meeting took 
place. From the viewpoint of Buenos Aires PC leaders, 
refounding the party would constitute a way of putting an end to 
those comings and goings and putting one's shirt on the Grand 
Front. 
  The other thorny issue still pending is the FG platform. 
Echegaray's entourage gave vent to their annoyance with the 
economic and methodological statements made by Carlos "Chacho" 
Alvarez during two interviews published by PAGINA/12. One 
Central Committee members explained: "We do not agree with that 
but, precisely, the establishment of a left wing within the FG 
will enable us to wage the platform battle." Buenos Aires 
Communists interpret things differently: "Echegaray should not 
tolerate Chacho's speaking about repaying [as published] the 
external debt or accepting privatizations. We believe the party 
should be dissolved to establish a new movement, and that 
positions should be changed. It is no longer possible to speak 
about defaulting on external debt payments." 
  Both Central Committee and Buenos Aires Committee members 
are 
of one mind about the fact that the process they are about to 
undertake may cause a rift within the party. They foresee that 
"there are some stick-in-the-muds who will cling to their old 
views, and there is no way they can see the political reality 
any other way. In any case, they are a minority." Other PC 
leaders have a different diagnosis: "The party's transformation 
will by no means be easy. It will meet fierce opposition, but 
this is the only way out."

  [Text] Cordoba, 22 April (NA) -- Defense Ministry officials 
and Military Airplane Factory authorities in this city have 
confirmed the theft of computer material on the Pampa 2000 plane 
project. They stressed, however, that the stolen material "does 
not include confidential information" on the plane. 
  Aeronautics Engineer Francisco Luciano, chairman of the 
Cordoba Materiel Area Administration Council, said that the 
stolen hard disks contained information on "the cost of 
different plane components, information that was being prepared 
for the bidding that the U.S. Air Force is organizing for 12 
May." 
  The United States will decide, through this bidding, on the 
purchase of 700 training planes. The total cost of the deal is 
estimated to be worth between $5 billion and $7 billion. 
  Luciano stressed that the stolen material "does not have any 
other value than the possibility of determining how many hours 
you can invest in manufacturing different plane components" and 
other similar data. 
  He estimated that the materials stolen are only worth around 
$10,000, and included a Hewlett Packard laser printer, software 
material, a mouse, a CD-ROM, a scanner, diskettes, and office 
paper. 
  Despite the explanation, however, officials here suspect 
that 
we are confronted with a case of industrial espionage. The 
stolen material is not strategic, but could have had no other 
destination than that of some company specifically interested in 
the plane bidding. 
  The case is being investigated by Judge Gustavo Becerra 
Ferrer, of the Second Federal Court, who took the precaution of 
informing President Carlos Menem about the incident. 
  So far there is no information on court-ordered legal steps, 
but it is understood that he has heard the testimony of various 
Military Factory officials and employees working in the area of 
computers. 
  It is presumed that the theft occurred on the night between 
31 January and 1 February, when factory personnel were on 
vacation. The materials were stolen from the office of the 
department called Joint Primary Aircraft Training System 
(JPATS), which was working on a U.S. Air Force and Navy joint 
training program.

  [Text] Buenos Aires 21 Apr (NA) -- Economy Vice Minister 
Carlos Sanchez today stated that the enactment of a patents law 
to protect pharmaceutical products "will neither entail an 
increase in the price of medicines nor necessarily foster the 
establishment of monopolies" on the Argentine market. 
  He said: "We must assess the effect that the new law on 
patents may have on prices, bearing in mind the market 
regulation mechanisms we have at our disposal." 
  Health and Social Action Minister Alberto Mazza, by 
contrast, 
conceded that the price of patents "may affect overall health 
costs." He nonetheless made it clear that this "may also depend 
on technology." 
  Mazza emphasized that a patents law "will encourage 
scientific development, and will permit Argentina's efficient 
incorporation into the world community." 
  Sanchez and Mazza made these remarks during a public 
appearance in the Senate's lecture room. The meeting was 
sponsored by Industry Committee Chairman Jose Genoud of the 
Radical Civic Union. 
  The executive branch submitted a pharmaceutical patents bill 
to the Senate in May of last year. Five different committees 
have been studying it since then. 
  The officials' public appearance is part of a series of 
talks 
that are being organized by the Senate. In the next few weeks 
Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo and Foreign Minister Guido Di 
Tella will also participate in it. 
  Provisional Senate President Eduardo Menem introduced the 
speakers, and then said that the issue of patents "was not 
shelved, as many people say. On the contrary, legislators are 
seriously analyzing it." 
  Mazza denied that the new patents law will negatively affect 
the quality of medicines, adding that "in any case, quality will 
be guaranteed by the National Medicines, Food, and Technology 
Administration." 
  Mazza stressed the organization's efficiency, and said that 
it "was created with the participation and technical advice of 
the World Health Organization and the Pan-American Health 
Organization." 
  The health minister said: "This administration filled the 
vacuum left by state control organs, which did not operate 
properly because their work was not properly coordinated." 
  The economy vice minister in turn said that Argentina's 
acceptance of the international law on patents "will not 
necessarily affect prices, and if it does, the state has 
instruments to regulate the operation of markets." 
  "When we talk about patents we mean respect for intellectual 
property, not its effect on prices," the economy vice minister 
said. 
  Asked if the patents law will imply the installation of 
monopolies in the medicines market, Sanchez said: "There is a 
national law on defense of competition and a National Commission 
for the Defense of Competition. This commission is responsible 
for strict control of the performance of various companies with 
monopolistic powers, and for determining whether they abuse 
their dominant position in the market." 
  Sanchez said that the assumption that monopolies and high 
prices go hand in hand "is not necessarily correct, because we 
have the instruments to control that relation." 
  "The patents law will not create monopolies. It will protect 
property rights on scientific development. In any case, the 
existence of monopolies depends on the characteristics of each 
market," Sanchez added. 
  The vice minister said: "Some markets are necessarily 
monopolistic, as they cannot operate in any other way. But that 
does not mean that prices must increase. The computer business 
started with two monopolistic companies, and it is well known 
that prices did not increase. Instead, they dropped and are 
still dropping," Sanchez concluded.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Intolerable `Drug Enforcement Agency'"] </F>
  [Text] If there is -- as there is in reality -- an 
agreement between our government and the United States 
authorizing the presence and activities in Bolivia of an 
organization whose mission is the struggle against illegal 
drugs, the least that should be demanded from it is legality and 
transparency in its operations. The country has the right to 
know the name of the DEA director, where his office is, who his 
immediate aides are, and, above all, demand that his 
investigative methods abide by the country's current juridical 
order. 
  But nothing like that happens. In the eyes of the Bolivian 
people, the DEA is a mysterious and clandestine organization. 
Not even the chief of its national counterpart -- the FELCN 
[Special Antinarcotics Force] -- gave the name of the individual 
responsible for that organization. It has been learned that the 
DEA uses methods of intimidation and control over telephone 
lines, and through them control over private conversations. It 
has "safe houses" where, according to reiterated denunciations, 
physical and psychological torture are used to get the testimony 
of those under arrest, and where it can arrest any citizen going 
over judicial formalities. 
  We know the DEA has the delicate mission of fighting drug 
trafficking, and because drug trafficking is a clandestine and 
illegal activity, its operations and personnel must be protected 
with some degree of confidentiality. The National Police and the 
FELCN also have that mission but their chiefs show their faces 
because their task is legal, and any action they commit is 
subject to the judgment of the people and the verdict of 
judicial officials. 
  The methods used by the DEA in its operations are very 
different. To start with, as more than one Bolivian jurist said, 
that foreign organization uses methods that, if legal in its 
country, are not in our country. Kidnapping, for example, which 
according to the U.S. Supreme Court is admissible in some cases, 
continues to be prohibited in our legislation and is considered 
a crime even if the reason is to fight another crime. The same 
situation is valid for the presumption of innocence, which is 
the basic principle sustained in our entire juridical structure 
in contrast to the presumption of guilt used by that 
organization. 
  Another aspect that needs rectification is the one used by 
the DEA that consists of offering all types of rewards -- 
including reduction of sentence or acquittal -- if a witness 
offers testimony or evidence against another. Our juridical 
system rejects this method, and it is against our tradition and 
convictions. If this method is used in more developed countries 
than ours it is their responsibility, but we don't have to 
accept it. 
  What exists in essence is what the president of the Republic 
dramatically stated in his latest public speech, when he said 
our dependency is "terrible." And it is precisely that adjective 
that makes it intolerable because dependency in the broad sense 
exists in any country in the world, including the United States, 
which in some way "depends" commercially on Japan. But we cannot 
continue widening that gap; we should reduce it, and any effort 
in this regard deserves the support of all the people. 
  Therefore, it would be good for a branch like the 
legislative 
to thoroughly investigate the activities of that foreign agency, 
and to put it under strict legality with the possibility of 
annulling the agreement that authorized its presence in the 
country. If political organizations and the media provide full 
support, this will no longer be a utopian situation.

<F P=106> [Interview with unidentified high-ranking Bolivian Army </F>
officer by FIDES NEWS AGENCY, ANF; place and date not given, 
first part is introduction] 
  [Text] Military chiefs of the different forces have 
recommended that the Bolivian Government should "gradually 
eliminate the use of foreign advisers in antinarcotics 
enforcement" and thus "guarantee national security and 
sovereignty." 
  "Experts from other countries -- not necessarily from the 
United States -- may come here. There is no problem as long as 
they abide by national laws and are appropriately authorized. 
But it would be good if they could be gradually eliminated in 
the short term," said a source close to the Military High 
Command. The officer explained, however, that their idea is not 
the institutional position. 
  A high-ranking Army officer close to the Military High 
Command agreed to be interviewed by ANF on condition he was not 
identified because of "specific regulations, disciplinary 
practices, and precepts of the Armed Forces organic law." 
  [ANF] Are the Bolivian Armed Forces fully capable of 
controlling the actions of foreign groups like the DEA in 
Bolivia? 
  [Officer] The Armed Forces are present all over the country 
but we are unable to fully cover the entire territory. Military 
organizations can temporarily come to Bolivia as long as they 
are under the supervision of the Bolivian Armed Forces. 
  We (the military) are preserving Bolivian national 
sovereignty and security in compliance with our constitutional 
role. It would worry us if elements (foreign military) were 
allowed to move freely (throughout Bolivia). 
  [ANF] Are the foreign armed elements operating in the 
country 
subordinated to the Bolivian Armed Forces? 
  [Officer] We want them to abide by national laws, we do not 
want their subordination. 
  [ANF] How would you label relations between the Armed Forces 
and the U.S. military mission? 
  [Officer] Military relations between U.S. and Bolivian 
forces 
are absolutely normal. 
  [ANF] Why are U.S. military advisers -- rather than those 
from other countries -- always involved in antinarcotics 
enforcement, humanitarian aid, and civic action? 
  [Officer] We must get all countries involved in the struggle 
against trafficking and thus get them to do their share. The 
best course of action would be if we used our own means and 
capabilities in a national and decisive action against 
trafficking with foreign technical advice in some cases, and 
with the provision of means we do not have in other cases. 
  [ANF] Do you believe national sovereignty is likely to be 
violated by foreign interests? 
  [Officer] The presence of U.S. troops in particular is no 
threat to national sovereignty because the Armed Forces 
follow-up the actions of U.S. personnel that enter the country 
to ensure they behave legally and return to their country within 
the time established by Congress in some cases and by the 
executive branch in others. DEA agents are here on rotational 
assignments. 
  [ANF] The arrival of U.S. military personnel has increased 
since last year. Has anything abnormal been detected? 
  [Officer] All foreign personnel arriving here do so legally 
based on bilateral and multilateral agreements. They cannot 
just parachute in. Everything is under control, if there were 
anything abnormal, the Armed Forces would detect it and report 
it to a higher level. 
  [ANF] When armed foreign personnel arrive under a binational 
agreement, to whom do they report during their stay? 
  [Officer] They obey the agreement. They are not under the 
orders of the Armed Forces but we supervise and have liaison 
officers in the areas where they work.

  [Text] La Paz -- Sources linked to the national Defense 
Ministry and the military high command on 14 April announced 
that "a national strategy document" for the defense of national 
"sovereignty and security" will be delivered next week to the 
president of the Republic and captain general of the Armed 
Forces, Gonzalez Sanchez de Lozada, for its "immediate 
implementation" in the attempt to safeguard the Bolivian state's 
physical integrity. 
  The sources explained that for this purpose a meeting of the 
Defense Ministry, the National Security Supreme Council [Consejo 
Supreme de Seguridad Nacional, COSDENA], and the Armed Forces 
command was called during the past few hours. The meeting's 
purpose is to start drafting the document that will be submitted 
to the chief of state. 
  The sources commented: We are going to adopt a definite 
stance -- in our capacity as the government -- regarding reports 
that revealed the "internal and external weakness" shown by the 
country in view of the "interference and imposition" of the 
foreign forces acting in the national territory. 
  They also said: "Our rule will be to propose basic 
guidelines for its defense." 
  This information was disclosed a few hours after former 
President Jaime Paz Zamora accused the United States of 
interfering in domestic affairs through the financial 
cooperation it offers for the fight against drug trafficking. 
  To prove the pressure exerted by the United States in "many 
fields" of cooperation it grants Bolivia, Paz Zamora said: "I 
took our flag and went out to defend national dignity." 
  The proposals the national organizations directly charged 
with security will make will include precise suggestions on 
subjects related to the presence of foreign troops in Bolivia, 
the existence of technical cooperation commissions for the 
struggle against drug trafficking, and the Armed Forces' actions 
to guarantee external and internal security. 
  The sources pointed out that "the president of the Republic, 
Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, now has to call COSDENA to assess, as 
a whole, the discoveries disclosed these past weeks as a result 
of the investigations into the government authorities' links to 
drug trafficking." 
  In the meantime, National Defense Ministry sources today 
asserted that the drug trafficking scourge during the past 10 
years has become a "destabilizing factor" for the Bolivian 
state's institutional system. 
  They also pointed out that the illegal business of drug 
trafficking had infiltrated "the state's most sensitive security 
structure" and, consequently, there is a risk -- if this scourge 
is not eradicated -- of "irreversibly enslaving" the Bolivian 
state with consequences that, so far, "have not been truly 
determined." 
  They also said they would make proposals designed to review 
agreements Bolivia has signed with the United States that 
"endorse a constant presence of foreign troops" in the national 
territory because -- they said -- it violates Bolivian 
sovereignty and the country's laws. 
  They pointed out that the national government will have to 
do 
something similar about the "technical cooperation commissions" 
such as the DEA that act "with complete freedom and autonomy" in 
Bolivia. 
  The sources added: "We must establish an explicit difference 
between the functions of the U.S. missions that give 
humanitarian aid to given regions of the country and the U.S. 
logistical support in the war against drug trafficking. Rules 
for this sort of aid must be established."

  [Text] La Paz, 22 Apr (EFE) -- The Bolivian Government 
today approved the National Budget Law, which provides for an 
8-percent salary increase for public servants. This is not 
considered enough by the labor unions that have reacted with 
massive hunger strikes. 
  The Bolivian Labor Federation (COB), the only labor union in 
the country, has organized another voluntary hunger strike to 
protest the aborted attempt by members of the Attorney General's 
Office to dislodge three teachers who have been fasting for the 
past 19 days at the COB headquarters to demand better salaries. 
  La Paz District Attorney Javier Dips tried to dislodge the 
strikers and transfer them to medical centers because, according 
to medical reports, they are about to go into comma due to lack 
of food. 
  The aborted attempt was criticized by COB leaders and 
workers, as well as by Labor Minister Reynaldo Peters who denied 
any government involvement in the case, and by Interior Minister 
German Quiroga who asserted that those on hunger strike at the 
labor union headquarters will be respected. 
  COB Executive Secretary Oscar Salas, today stated that more 
workers have joined the 768 people fasting throughout the 
country "to make the government aware of their salary demands." 
  A group of 180 teachers who began a march to La Paz on 18 
April from Tiquina, on Lake Titicaca, will arrive in La Paz 
today and immediately join the hunger strike, according to their 
leaders. 
  The teachers have been marching along the highway to La Paz 
for the past three days. One of them said: "We want to make the 
government aware that we cannot live in misery for ever. We 
demand a fair salary that will be in keeping with the cost of 
the family basket." 
  The government-COB dialogue was suspended after President 
Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada at dawn today promulgated the National 
Budget Law, which provides for an 8-percent salary increase. 
  The COB has summoned a nationwide meeting of leaders to 
decide on future actions following the imminent rupture with the 
government, as well as the possibility of requesting the 
intervention of the church.

<F P=106> [Article by Virginia Silveira] </F>
  [Text] Sao Jose dos Campos -- By the next decade Brazil 
should be joining the restricted club of countries that have 
mastered the most advanced technology to obtain the enriched 
uranium (235) that is used as fuel for nuclear reactors. The 
Institute of Advanced Studies (IEAv) at the Aerospace Technical 
Center [Centro Tecnico Aeroespacial -- CTA] in Sao Jose dos 
Campos is already producing uranium 235 through the method of 
separating isotopes with laser beams via atomic vapor. 
  The separation of uranium isotopes is an activity that 
currently demands heavy investment. Colonel Hugo Pereira 
Chaves, director of IEAv, says that among all the methods 
currently known (gaseous diffusion, ultra centrifuge, molecular) 
for uranium enrichment, the atomic process is best from the 
economic point of view. This method, he adds, is also best from 
the ecological point of view, given that the radioactive waste 
may be recycled and treated. 
  The most widely used fuel element for nuclear reactors is 
uranium, whose natural composition is as follows: 99.3 percent 
is made up of an isotope with an atomic weight of 238, and 0.7 
percent of an isotope with an atomic weight of 235. Most of the 
existing nuclear reactors need "enriched" uranium. This means 
increasing the 235 isotope content, which is radioactive, to a 
concentration of greater than 3 percent. 
  The physical principle of the atomic separation method is 
based on the different abilities of the 235 and 238 isotopes to 
absorb light from well- defined frequencies, that is, light of 
specific colors. The atomic process works with uranium in its 
metallic form. The separation of 235 and 238 isotopes undergoes 
three stages. 
  The metallic uranium is placed in a container heated to 
3,000 
degrees [scale not specified]. The uranium vapor generated by 
the high temperature is absorbed by laser irradiation at a 
frequency that attracts the 235 atoms to a metallic plaque, from 
which they are extracted. 
  According to Col. Pereira Chaves, the IEAv has attained a 
level of 50 percent uranium enrichment during the process of 
exciting the 235 molecules. Extraction of uranium, however, has 
yet not been possible at such a level, he said. He did not 
reveal the level of enrichment already attained by the IEAv, as 
it is an industrial secret. 
<H5>  The United States </H5>
  Col. Pereira Chaves reported that the United States has 
already managed a 30 percent enrichment in its tests -- of which 
very little is known. The industrial development of this 
process is still not known in any other country of the world. 
The Americans have already decided that the atomic separation 
process with laser beams must be adopted by the United States on 
a commercial scale in the next century. 
  Atomic separation, Pereira Chaves said, will replace the 
current gaseous diffusion process that is underway. "Between 
1972 and 1988 the United States invested $700 million in the 
atomic process. An industrial scale demonstration will require 
an additional $946 million," he added, according to IEAv 
estimates. 
  The IEAv, according to Pereira Chaves, has allotted only 
$71 million to its uranium enrichment program with laser beams 
since 1981. Part of these resources, nearly $41 million, were 
financed by the Aeronautics Ministry, and the rest came from the 
National Nuclear Energy Commission (CNEN), the Funding Authority 
for Studies and Projects (Finep), and the Strategic Affairs 
Secretariat. 
  For the project to develop satisfactorily, Pereira Chaves 
said, the institute would need something between $1.5 and $2 
million per year. In the past three years, however, the 
institute has been receiving less than $1 million per year for 
the maintenance of its entire project structure, Chaves said. 
<H5>  Molecular Process </H5>
  In addition to the atomic process, the IEAv has concentrated 
its research on uranium enrichment by laser beam through the 
molecular method. The molecular method, according to Chaves, 
uses uranium hexaflouride gas (UF6) mixed with a lighter gas 
(carrier gas). The mixture is accelerated in a supersonic (high 
speed) pipe, and is then cooled to a temperature of minus 190 
degrees Celsius. 
  "Under those conditions UF6 molecules that have the uranium 
235 isotope absorb laser radiation of a different frequency than 
that absorbed by the molecules of uranium 238," Chaves said. 
  The molecular process, according to the director, is also 
being studied as one of the alternatives that could be adopted 
by Brazil for the industrial-scale production of uranium 235. 
"The advantage of the molecular separation method is that there 
is a facility in Resende (Rio de Janeiro), which was built under 
an agreement signed with Germany in 1979," he said. 
  Another advantage is that researchers are already familiar 
with the entire corrosion process caused by UF6, which they have 
learned to control. The metallic uranium corrosion process 
(used for atomic separation) is still unknown to them. 
<H5>  Lower Cost </H5>
  Research with the atomic separation method, however, is at a 
more advanced stage, as it has succeeded in separating uranium 
235, though at a laboratory level. Production costs, according 
to the IEAv, are 23 percent lower than those for traditional 
enrichment processes. "Until 1985, a total investment of $9.7 
million was considered necessary for the operation, maintenance, 
research, and development of the atomic separation method," 
Chaves said. 
  The figures, according to Chaves, are included in a study 
made in the United States and published by the NUCLEONICS WEEK 
newspaper. Based on the study, the United States invested in the 
expansion of its uranium enrichment capacity through the laser 
separation process. 
  In Brazil, uranium 235 is produced at an industrial scale by 
the ultracentrifuge method, which is based on the mass 
difference between isotopes. The Navy Ministry has a research 
center that specializes in producing uranium through this method.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities monitored through 21 April. 
  The Sao Paulo industrial sector dismissed 1,481 workers 
during the first week of April. Unemployment in greater Sao 
Paulo rose from 14.1 percent in February to 14.9 percent. (Sao 
Paulo GAZETA MERCANTIL in Portuguese 19 Apr 94 p 1) 
  The National Bank for Economic and Social Development, 
BNDES, 
will offer for sale preferential shares of the Minas Gerais Iron 
and Steel Company, Usiminas, worth $400 million. The shares 
account for 17 percent of the enterprise's total capital. They 
were unsold at the privatization auction held in November 1991. 
BNDES expects to sell 80 percent of the shares abroad. (Sao 
Paulo GAZETA MERCANTIL in Portuguese 19 Apr 94 p 1) 
  Ailton Fernandes, the acting industry and commerce minister, 
said on 15 April that during the first two months of 1994 the 
importation of machines and industrial equipment increased by 
29.7 percent to $3.818 billion compared to the same period in 
1993. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 2156 GMT 15 Apr 94) 
  Jose Ferreira Lopes, Brazilian ambassador to the Arab 
Emirates, on 15 April reported that the balance of trade between 
Brazil and the Arab Emirates, which in 1989 registered a deficit 
of $120,000 for Brazil, in 1993 registered a surplus of $33 
million. (Sao Paulo GAZETA MERCANTIL in Portuguese 16 Apr 94 p 5) 
  Canada has doubled its coal sales to Brazil so far in 1994. 
Canadian coal sales to Brazil in 1993 totaled 900,000 tons. So 
far this year, contracts for the supply of 1.8 million tons of 
Canadian coal have already been signed. The reason for the 
increase is a discount of $3.85 per ton, which surpassed the 
$0.60 discount offered by Australian suppliers. (Sao Paulo 
GAZETA MERCANTIL in Portuguese 16 Apr 94 p 1) 
  The Swift Armour meat packing plant, which is owned by the 
Bordon family, yesterday went bankrupt because of a debt of 
$143.5 million, which is almost twice the value of its net 
assets. The crisis in the meat packing plant sector has also 
affected Sadia, another big enterprise that last year began to 
reduce its activities. The Anglo meat packing plant was sold 
last year, and Floresta Industria de Alimentos discontinued its 
activities last week. (Sao Paulo GAZETA MERCANTIL in Portuguese 
16 Apr 94 p 1) 
  According to broker W.I. Carr of the Indosuez Banque group, 
the electric power sector will be the main beneficiary of a 
phase of the Brady Plan that Brazil arranged last week. The 
Light and Eletrobras -- Brazilian Electric Power Company, Inc. 
-- companies will receive the main benefits from the plan. Carr 
estimates the principal of the sector's debt was reduced by 13 
percent as a result of the agreement reached with creditor 
banks. (Sao Paulo GAZETA MERCANTIL in Portuguese 19 Apr 94 p 1) 
  Official sources on 15 April reported that between May and 
August 1994, the Brazilian Government will sell 2.4 billion bags 
of its coffee stockpile, seeking to reduce domestic market 
prices which currently stand at $0.05 above international market 
prices. The government may auction some 600,000 bags per month. 
(Madrid EFE in Spanish 2112 GMT 15 Apr 94) 
  During an auction held on 15 April, 484,039 Arafertil Inc. 
shares were sold at the unit price of 24.53 cruzeiros for a 
total of 11,873,476 cruzeiros. The price of the shares was 
0.012 percent higher than the minimum price, which had been set 
at 24.52713 cruzeiros. (Rio de Janeiro O GLOBO in Portuguese 16 
Apr 94 p 27) 
  National Treasury Secretary Murilo Portugal Filho has 
reported that in the first quarter of 1994 the Treasury 
registered a cash deficit of 186 billion cruzeiros. This 
virtually balances the public accounts. During this period, the 
Treasury income stood at 10,420 trillion cruzeiros while 
expenses stood at 10,607 trillion cruzeiros. The deficit 
registered in February was compensated by the surplus in January 
and March. (Sao Paulo O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO in Portuguese 14 Apr 
94 p 1) 
  According to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and 
Statistics on 18 April, Brazilian industrial production dropped 
by 2.8 percent in February after registering an accumulated 
growth rate of 14.2 percent between September 1993 and January 
1994. Of the 17 areas checked in January and February, only the 
capital goods sector registered positive performance; it grew by 
0.8 percent. The mechanical sector dropped by 8.2 percent, the 
electrical material sector by 7.2 percent, the chemical sector 
by 1.5 percent, the metallurgical sector by 1.7 percent, and the 
transport material sector by 2.6 percent. These industries 
account for more than 70 percent of the activities in the 
sector. (Sao Paulo O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO in Portuguese 19 Apr 94

  [Excerpts] Chilean Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa said 
yesterday in Marrakech that despite the success obtained in the 
Uruguay Round of talks within the General Agreement on Trade and 
Tariffs (GATT), it is necessary to continue to fight at a world 
level against protectionism and commercial discrimination. 
  He emphasized the contribution that will be made in this 
regard by the World Trade Organization (WTO), which will replace 
GATT on 1 January 1995. Figueroa strongly warned that emphasis 
should be placed on some subjects, like the liberalization of 
agricultural product trade, the improvement of the rules against 
dumping, and the banning of unilateral sanctions and 
extraterritorial enforcement of domestic environmental standards. 
  The minister thus advocated the lifting of measures that may 
entail covert protectionism or the possibility of hindering free 
commerce through social or environmental criteria, or through 
the appearance of a kind of neo-protectionism that will be 
particularly harmful to developing nations. 
  "More liberal commerce, without discrimination, remains our 
best choice and our first priority," Figueroa said, in a speech 
he addressed to the representatives of 118 countries that today 
will sign the Final Act of the Uruguay Round of GATT talks and 
the agreement for creation of the WTO. 
  Addressing ministers of countries from all over the world, 
Figueroa conveyed our country's strong determination to actively 
and responsibly engage in the WTO. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  The Chilean Position </H5>
  Figueroa went to Marrakech to sign the Uruguay Round 
agreements on behalf of the Chilean Government. 
  In the speech before his peers yesterday, Figueroa noted 
Chile's satisfaction over the fact that the Final Act will 
include the attainment of several objectives that were outlined 
in the Declaration of Punta del Este, such as the liberalization 
of commerce through the reduction of custom tariffs and the 
lifting of several non-tariff restrictions, particularly those 
affecting agriculture. 
  He also emphasized as a major achievement the fact that the 
textile and clothing sectors will also be ruled by GATT 
regulations, although the terms and deadlines will preserve 
restrictions that favor some countries for "too long." 
  As a second major achievement, Figueroa mentioned the 
strengthening of the multilateral system of commerce through 
effective rules. He said such rules strengthen the principle of 
nondiscrimination as the essential foundation of international 
trade. 
  Figueroa expressed Chile's satisfaction over the fact that 
the final documents will uphold -- from a legal and political 
viewpoint -- a new dimension of commerce that goes beyond the 
exchange of goods. He remarked that the agreement that 
regulates the supply and demand of services, and that creates -- 
among other things -- a forum and the mechanisms for 
strengthening liberalization, is a major step forward. 
  He explained that the improvement of the system for the 
settlement of disagreements is beneficial for mid-sized or small 
countries like Chile, as their interests will be preserved 
especially by the certainty and stability of international law. 
  Figueroa said that the creation of the WTO has strengthened 
the legal framework that is necessary for assuring these 
achievements, and that it is also a forum for multilateral 
negotiations in search for freer, nondiscriminatory trade. 
[passage omitted] 
<H5>  Pending Tasks </H5>
  Even though he expressed Chile's general satisfaction over 
the agreements, Figueroa said that in the future it will be 
necessary to place emphasis on six different subjects in the 
quest for freer world trade. 
  First, he obviously mentioned the implementation of the 
decisions as of 1 January 1995. 
  Second, he advocated continuation and acceleration of the 
liberalization of the agricultural products trade. Third, he 
said it is necessary to improve antidumping rules, so that they 
do not become instruments for unjustified, discriminatory 
protection. 
  Figueroa said it is also necessary to consider the 
relationship between trade and the environment, reaffirming the 
principle that each nation should independently address the 
subject, impeding the extraterritorial enforcement of domestic 
standards, and avoiding unilateral sanctions. 
  Figueroa said that countries should be encouraged to join 
the 
multilateral system of commerce, in order to give it an 
effectively global nature. [passage omitted] 
  Concerning some existing concerns, Figueroa emphasized that 
Chile has maintained and promoted an open, clear commercial 
policy, both for goods and services, especially in the area of 
investment. He warned that Chile will preserve its national 
interests if the tariffs that some countries have adopted for 
the agricultural sector impair or neutralize the benefits that 
were negotiated.

  [Text] Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus has promised to 
eliminate visas for Chileans who want to visit Czechoslovakia. 
The prime minister reported that Chile and the Czech Republic 
have completed an agreement to eliminate entrance visas. 
  The Czech prime minister made this comment at the end of a 
lecture he gave to international affairs experts at the Andres 
Bello Diplomatic Institute in the Foreign Ministry building. 
  In his lecture the Czech prime minister said he is in Chile 
because he believes that his nation must not restrict its ties 
to European countries only. 
  Klaus expressed skepticism about the idea of a great 
European 
union, but he said he favors an integration process that admits 
diversity. He also said that the Czech Government is interested 
in safeguarding its own identity without, he said, dissolving in 
coffee like a lump of sugar. In addition, he warned that the 
Czech Republic does not intend to become a bridge between 
eastern and western Europe.

  [Text] Finance Minister Eduardo Aninat said yesterday that 
"Chile is against protectionism and the formation of closed 
trade blocs, as we want to avoid having the world fall into 
trade wars that are harmful to trade and investment." Aninat 
made this comment in a speech before the Inter-American 
Development Bank (IDB) Assembly in Guadalajara, Mexico. 
  He added that Chile will use every international meeting to 
denounce this practice. He noted that "after long efforts to 
increase the quantity and variety of its goods and services, 
Chile is operating with an export capability of 33 percent to 
the Latin American countries, 31.8 percent to Europe, and 31 
percent to Asia. [no closing quotation marks as published] 
  Aninat also proposed the formation of open and sophisticated 
regional groups for investment and international trade. 
  He added that the Chilean Government was pleased to hear the 
reaffirmation made by U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor 
that Chile continues to be the primary candidate for joining 
NAFTA [North American Free Trade Agreement], made up of the 
United States, Mexico, and Canada, or for negotiating a 
bilateral agreement "because we are not against either of the 
two formulas," said Aninat. 
  Aninat also recognized the contribution made by the IDB for 
regional integration. He expressed optimism that this 
organization would support the hemispheric summit called by 
President Bill Clinton in Miami next December.

<F P=106> [Article by Lucia Zamora] </F>
  [Excerpts] The Chilean Commission for Nuclear Energy 
(CCHEN] is undergoing a dynamic modernization process, which 
will facilitate support for the productive sector by improving 
its international competitiveness. The CCHEN will this Friday 
enthusiastically celebrate its 30th birthday under such positive 
circumstances. 
  Engineer German Piderit, the dynamic CCHEN president, told 
LA 
TERCERA that "we are optimizing the system, and our immediate 
goals aim at improving public service, a task that we will 
efficiently perform." 
  Summarizing the three decades during which Chile has been 
using nuclear energy, Piderit emphasized the development of a 
series of complex techniques related to the manipulation of 
nuclear fuel and the fuel cycle. "The fact that we can have and 
use this technology at a national level has allowed us to 
develop areas that are important for the rest of the country's 
productive system," he explained. 
  He was also pleased to refer to an agreement that CCHEN 
signed with authorities of the Second Region last week, "based 
on our policy of support for the sector that produces services 
and for socioeconomic development." This type of agreement will 
undoubtedly be signed with other regions, too. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  Reactors </H5>
  Chile has no nuclear power plants, but research reactors, 
Piderit explained. "It is worth noting the size of those 
reactors, as there is no comparison whatsoever -- as far as 
power, size, and the possibility of accidents are concerned -- 
between research reactors and a nuclear power plant." (There 
are two nuclear reactors in our country: one in La Reina, and 
the other in Lo Aguirre, near the Lo Prado tunnel). 
  Piderit added: "One of them has reached its critical point 
with 5 megawatts, while the other operates at 2 megawatts. The 
smallest nuclear power plant in existence operates at more than 
300 megawatts." 
  He noted that "as far as their operation or the possibility 
of any accidents are concerned, our reactors are practically 
harmless." The research reactors benefit the industrial, food, 
and medicine sectors. 
<H5>  Medicine and Food </H5>
  Surgical and medical equipment, hypodermic syringes, gloves, 
and other elements have for several years been sterilized 
through gamma radiation at the Lo Aguirre plant. 
  In the specific nuclear medicine area, the CCHEN is now 
supplying "around 90 percent of the radioisotopes and 
radioactive medicines that are needed in Chile." [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] Colombia is not a corrupt country and its 
presidential candidates do not have links to the mafia, the 
Colombian Government and political circles said when they 
rejected charges in this regard by the U.S. Congress. 
  In general terms we are a clean country and that is why we 
reject such slander, Colombian Ambassador in Washington Gabriel 
Silva said. We will not remain indifferent nor will we allow 
these charges to prosper. Many innocent persons have died, and 
we are not going to trample on their memories, he said. 
  The government expressed its concern and disagreement with 
the accusation that the entire country is corrupt and that the 
presidential candidates receive support from the mafia. 
According to the U.S. Congress, this accusation is based on 
confessions by former Medellin Cartel member Gabriel Taboada. 
  The ambassador described those hearings and the statements 
by 
the drug trafficker -- who is a witness for Senator Kerry -- as 
inadmissible. He also lamented that all of this has weakened 
the war on drugs. Ambassador Silva said the accusations by this 
convict are an affront to the families of thousands of brave 
Colombians who have lost their lives in this war on the mafias. 
He said the mere use of Taboada is a clear sign of how 
Congress' watchdog function has been sidetracked, something that 
will affect our capacity to learn about the reality of the war 
on drugs. Apparently the only firsthand information this drug 
trafficker has goes back to the mid-1980's, but he was 
nevertheless allowed to question the integrity of an entire 
country, which is known in the whole world as a leader in the 
struggle against drugs, Ambassador Gabriel Silva said.

  [Text] Indignation is growing in our country in the face of 
statements by drug trafficker Gabriel Taboada to a U.S. 
congressional commission meeting summoned by Democratic 
politician John Kerry. Taboada said every area of Colombian life 
has been infiltrated by drug trafficking. Let us hear some 
reactions: 
  [Begin recording] [General Hernan Guzman, Army commander, in 
progress] ...our country, and thus, completely loses the 
outlook of his country. Therefore, to think that this has.... 
[pauses] it is inappropriate to give a certain credence to the 
statements of this individual. 
  [Gen. Octavio Vargas, National Police director] It is unfair 
to attack the dignity of people who are working courageously, 
honestly, and morally. 
  [Gen. Miguel Maza Marquez, presidential candidate] It is 
urgent to clarify this to stop the stigmatization of Colombia 
and avert unpredictable consequences. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Is this an affront to the country, 
Mr. President? 
  [President Cesar Gaviria] Yes, we have publicly stated, and 
in a very detailed manner, Colombia's position on this issue. 
We have demanded a sensible stand from the U.S. Government and 
the American people toward the efforts that our nation has made. 
  [Presidential candidate Andres Pastrana, in progress] ...and 
know about money used in political campaigns in Colombia, must 
denounce it. 
  [Vice Presidential candidate Humberto de la Calle] This is 
not a narco-democracy; Rodrigo Lara, Luis Carlos Galan, Carlos 
Mauro Hoyos, Guillermo Cano, journalists, and magistrates died 
here. We are fighting drug trafficking here; we must reject 
such claims that are unfair and constitute an insult to Colombia. 
  [Presidential candidate Enrique Parejo] The government must 
demand the evidence from the United States that serves as the 
basis for the offensive that you talked about, or the testimony 
of Senator Kerry, or the testimony of this drug trafficker. 
  [Presidential candidate Ernesto Samper] He must demonstrate 
that. I think that one cannot toss accusations into the air. 
There must be proof and certainty. The world must understand 
that we are not the drug traffickers but the main victims of 
trafficking. I was one of them. [end recording]

  [Text] Reaction from the country's political circles to the 
outrageous hearing held by the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on 
Terrorism, Narcotics, and International Operations were not long 
in coming. Several presidential candidates, who according to 
Gabriel Taboada are in the pay of drug traffickers, had this to 
say today. 
  [Begin recording] [Andres Pastrana, Conservative Party 
presidential candidate] I am concerned to see that the attempt 
to besmirch Colombia's name continues. When a person makes 
accusations, he should name names. That is what the country 
needs. If he has names, let him say so. It is important that 
the country know if there is drug money in the political 
campaigns. The information must come out. As far as I am 
concerned, I am absolutely certain there is no drug money. I 
have just given my records to the overseer of the National 
Treasury, the National Electoral Council, and the Colombian 
people. People cannot continue making these accusations. 
  [Antonio Navarro Wolff, presidential candidate for 19 April 
Movement Democratic Alliance] I say categorically that Antonio 
Navarro and Jesus Pinacue have not received a penny from drug 
traffickers for their campaign. I am not familiar with the rest 
of Mr. Taboada's statement, and it is hard to comment on 
something with which I am unfamiliar. 
  [Enrique Parejo, presidential candidate of the National 
Democratic Alternative] Some of what was said reflects what many 
Colombians have been saying. There is drug money in the 
political campaigns and there has been in the past. Drug money 
has infiltrated institutions. That is a fact, and I have 
denounced it. [end recording] 
  The government and the Prosecutor General's Office commented 
on the matter. 
  [Being recording] [Deputy Prosecutor General Francisco 
Sintura] Senator Kerry, respect Colombian justice and do not get 
too close to rogues. 
  [Defense Minister Rafael Pardo] Those remarks cannot be 
taken 
seriously. They reflect an ill-intended distortion to harm a 
country that has suffered a great deal from drug trafficking. 
It is not justified to give credence to someone who has no 
information and no way to get any and whose charges are not 
serious. [end recording]

  [Text] The government has decided not to grant seats in the 
Congress by decree to former guerrillas because of differences 
among the political currents in how they are divided. The 
executive branch believes such an important decision, from a 
political and legal standpoint, can only be made if there is a 
certain degree of consensus among the possible beneficiaries: 
M-19 [19 April Movement], EPL [Popular Liberation Army], PRT 
[Revolutionary Workers Party], and Quintin Lame Commando Unit. 
  Government Minister Fabio Villegas explained that because of 
this situation, the government cannot accept a Senate proposal 
to give back the seats to the movements, which struck an 
alliance with the M-19 Movement Democratic Alliance [AD/M-19], 
which they lost in the 13 March elections. "We do not wish to 
create more differences and political confrontations," the 
minister pointed out. 
  The government position was adopted for several reasons. 
First, Presidential Candidate Antonio Navarro opposed the Senate 
proposal, although he clarified that he did so on a personal 
basis. Second, militants of former guerrilla groups, such as 
Bernardo Gutierrez and Gerardo Ardila, criticized the proposal 
and described it as "shameful for democracy." Although Navarro 
criticized the media for having consulted people who are no 
longer AD/M-19 members, they are former guerrillas however. 
  AD/M-19 President Carlos Franco said he personally opposes 
political favoritism, which is the name commonly given to the 
concession of seats by decree, because the Senate is not the 
only political forum that exists and because he is convinced 
that his movement suffered an electoral defeat on 13 March due 
to its own mistakes. He, nevertheless, thanked the government 
and Congress for "their gesture of admitting that the peace 
process, which has not yet concluded, and although it produced a 
Constitution, had a high cost of about 400 dead." 
  He, however, pointed out that the Congress, with the same 
disposition with which it proposed the application of 
provisional Article 12 of the Constitution, should consider the 
possibility of giving to the opposition some watchdog 
organizations (Office of the Attorney General or Office of the 
Comptroller General)," because it is not logical for the 
traditional parties, which are the ones that govern, to 
supervise themselves. 
  The government minister said the position assumed toward the 
Senate proposal in no way affects a political agreement that was 
just signed with the Socialist Renewal Movement [CRS]. The CRS 
secured two seats in the Chamber of Representatives and the 
government will soon make them available.

  [Text] Medellin (Colombia), 23 Apr (EFE) -- Captain 
Humberto Coral Caballero, one of the Colombian Armed Forces 
officers who was part of the Search Bloc that killed drug 
trafficker Pablo Escobar in December, was murdered on Friday in 
Medellin, police sources reported today. 
  Coral Caballero was shot by two persons in a vehicle while 
he 
was on leave in La America neighborhood, the same area in 
western Medellin where the Medellin Cartel chief was killed on 2 
December 1993. Escobar was gunned down in one of his hideouts 
following a search that lasted for more than a year and involved 
more than 1,500 policemen. The murder of Capt. Coral Caballero, 
who was from Barranquilla, is among the first crimes in Medellin 
involving officers following Escobar's death.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ernesto Samper by Carlos Murcia; date, place </F>
not given] 
  [Text] After the 13 March election and his 
selection as the presidential candidate at the Liberal 
Convention, Ernesto Samper Pizano now leads all the polls. This 
is due in large part to his proposal for a social coalition 
known as the Alliance for Colombia, which has made been well 
received by a variety of sectors. The candidate expects that his 
campaign will continue to proceed well, as his platform has more 
credibility than that of the conservative Andres Pastrana. 
  [Murcia] How is the Alliance for Colombia doing? What 
support 
have you picked up from people who have joined the coalition, 
and what further support do you hope to get? 
  [Samper] The response to that appeal has exceeded our 
expectations. All over the country there are large numbers of 
Colombians who want to join this Social Alliance for the people. 
We are appealing to all the people, without distinction of 
party, race, creed, or ethnic background, so that together we 
can bring about positive changes for the people of Colombia. The 
commitment I have made to those who have supported me and the 
people have made to Samper is to support the platform I 
presented to the Colombian people, which I ratified at the 
convention: to generate more or better jobs; to invest in social 
areas so that the benefits of economic liberalization will reach 
all Colombians; to increase decentralization; and a new peace 
policy that will enable us to achieve our dream of living 
together in harmony. This is a long-term proposal that arises 
from the liberal majorities, not a strategy to win the elections. 
  [Murcia] Do you think you can renew liberalism so that it 
will once again represent broad sectors of society that today 
feel they have been abandoned? 
  [Samper] Liberalism cannot simply sit back with its election 
majorities; it needs to reach out to the masses who have been 
isolated because they do not feel they are represented in the 
community. I have said that in Colombia there is much more 
liberalism than the Liberal Party, and with the task of 
modernization, institutionalization, improvement of ethical 
standards, modernization, and participation that the recently 
appointed commission will promote, which will be chaired by vice 
presidential candidate Humberto de la Calle, with the 
participation of young people and women, we will work so that 
this feeling will be converted into support for the party. 
  [Murcia] Peace was a fundamental theme in your speech at the 
Liberal Convention. Will there be peace in your government? Do 
you not feel that the approval of Protocol II in Geneva, as 
proposed in your speech, means making concessions to the 
guerrillas? 
  [Samper] At this time, there is no issue of more importance 
to the nation than achieving peace. If we take away from the 
nation the brake of violence, growth and opportunities for the 
Colombian people will take off. That is why I said that I will 
always listen to anyone in Colombia who wants to talk about 
reconciliation. We will bring about peace by returning to the 
state its legitimate monopoly over force, but also by increasing 
its social presence in areas in conflict with more and better 
health care, more and better education, more and better housing, 
and most of all, more and better jobs. Jobs are the new name of 
peace in Colombia. 
  [Murcia] Pastrana says he receives support in public rallies 
and you in private meetings behind closed doors. What do you 
think of that statement? 
  [Samper] That support which they scornfully say comes from 
"private meetings" is the same support that Andres Pastrana was 
seeking a few days ago. We cannot ignore the fact that politics 
is also conducted by presenting ideas to business groups, in 
forums, and in universities; these proposals are the very ones 
that have received majority support from major conservative, 
progressive, independent, and leftist sectors. 
  [Murcia] Some critics oppose your ticket with De la Calle, 
saying that both of you have abandoned your principles in order 
to win votes.... 
  [Samper] All the liberal candidates in the recent primary 
agreed on the need to promote the second phase of economic 
liberalization, the social phase, the phase of the people, based 
on this social capitalism program which rejects the option of 
savage capitalism. Those statements are made by people who are 
concerned because the Samper-De la Calle ticket has received 
impressive support not only from liberalism that is more 
enthusiastic and united than ever, but also from broad-based 
sectors of society. 
  [Murcia] What will your relations be with the new secretary 
general of the OAS, and how will this position benefit Colombia? 
  [Samper] President Gaviria's election is a recognition of 
his 
status as a continental leader and of the fight Colombia has 
waged against the drug traffic and narcoterrorism. I am sure 
that President Gaviria will provide extraordinary leadership for 
the OAS with his well-known ability and dynamism. Obviously, in 
the next government we will make use of his presence in this 
organization to promote issues of great importance to Colombia, 
like the creation of an Interamerican trade bloc. 
  [Murcia] Will you alter your campaign strategy because of 
the 
change in the election date? Are you not afraid there may be 
more abstentions in the second round because of the soccer world 
championship? 
  [Samper] We will continue the same campaign pace, presenting 
our ideas on creating jobs, paying the social debt to women in 
Colombia, and investing in people. For the second round, I have 
promised all the Colombian people to keep from spoiling the 
world championships. With their support, we will win the first 
round by a "knockout," so we will be able to enjoy the games 
without being concerned about the elections. I also have to keep 
the promise I made to accompany the team, as president-elect, to 
the United States. 
  [Murcia] As president, what will your position be on 
economic 
groups? 
  [Samper] The same that it was when I was minister of 
development: to establish strict controls to avoid monopolistic 
practices so that no company can abuse its dominant market 
position. Obviously, with economic liberalization and foreign 
competition the possibilities of monopolies will be limited, but 
we need to pass strict legislation to restrict practices which 
hurt the consumer. But we cannot forget that Colombia needs to 
strengthen businesses and groups that can compete in the world 
market. And finally, when public assets are privatized, that 
must help to democratize ownership of property, not concentrate 
it in a few hands. 
  [Murcia] Do you think Luis Fernando Ramirez is ineligible to 
be a vice presidential candidate? 
  [Samper] Humberto De la Calle Lombana has been studying the 
issue of ineligibility. I believe the Colombian people must have 
absolute legal certainty when they go to the ballot boxes to 
elect the next president and vice president. Still, the most 
important thing is for the Colombian people to meditate calmly 
and responsibly about whether they would feel more comfortable 
with De la Calle or with Ramirez if the president were no longer 
there. And what has been perceived so far in the polls is the 
confidence and support that Humberto De la Calle generates as a 
possible successor for the president. 
  Today the candidate Samper is ending his "spiritual retreat" 
at a ranch near Bogota.

  [Text] The government might again declare a state of 
internal disturbance before 2 May. Special measures would have 
to be taken to prevent -- for the third time -- the possible 
mass release of terrorists and drug traffickers from the 
country's prisons. 
  In a letter, the attorney general [Carlos Gustavo Arrieta] 
warned the prosecutor general [Gustavo de Greiff] that if the 
legal situation is not defined for narcoterrorists and 
guerrillas, who have been held for 180 days as of 2 May, they 
will have to be released from jail, according to the new law. 
That mass release of suspected criminals has again alarmed the 
government, which does not rule out a declaration of a state of 
internal disturbance to prevent the release of drug traffickers 
and terrorists. 
  [Begin recording] [Government Minister Fabio Villegas] The 
government would evaluate the situation with the Prosecutor 
General's Office and would jointly make relevant decisions with 
that office. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Has the declaration of a state of 
internal disturbance been ruled out? 
  [Villegas] We are not ruling it out nor are we stating that 
it is going to be decreed. [end recording] 
  On another topic, the government minister described the 
assertions of confessed drug trafficker Gabriel Taboada in 
Washington as absurd and he criticized the position of U.S. 
Senator John Kerry. 
  [Begin Villegas recording] It is absurd and incomprehensible 
that a U.S. senator values the opinion of a criminal, a 
confessed criminal, more than this country's record in the 
struggle against drug trafficking. [end recording] 
  For the government, it is clear the struggle against drug 
trafficking will continue without rest, and not just to please 
someone in particular.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on developments related to the elections scheduled for 
29 May 1994. 
  Presidential candidates Andres Pastrana, of the Conservative 
Party, and Ernesto Samper, of the Liberal Party, both addressed 
issues related to Colombia's economic situation and outlook 
during the National Exporters Association annual congress. 
(Santa Fe de Bogota Inravision Cadena 1 in Spanish 0000 GMT 14 
Apr 94) 
  A recent National Consulting Center public opinion poll 
commissioned by EL TIEMPO reveals that with only 50 days 
remaining until election day, voters preference would seem to 
lean in favor of Liberal Party candidate Ernesto Samper over 
Conservative Party hopeful Andres Pastrana by a 10-percent 
margin. According to the poll, if the elections where held 
today, Samper would receive 49 percent of all eligible votes, 
while Pastrana would receive 39 percent; 4 percent would go to 
Antonio Navarro, while Miguel Maza and Enrique Parejo would 
receive 2 percent each; Regina Betancur would receive 1 percent, 
and the other candidates would receive less than 1 percent. One 
thing the polls evidence is that these latest results are 
clearly influenced by the selection of running mates, decisions 
which in the case of both the Liberal and Conservative Parties, 
took place during March. Samper was benefited with the 
selection of Humberto de La Calle as his vice presidential 
candidate. In this respect, 33 percent of those polled 
indicated that they were more inclined to vote for him after 
choosing de la Calle, and 16 percent said they were less 
inclined. At the same time, Pastrana's decision to select Luis 
Fernando Ramirez as his running mate clearly affected him. 
Approximately 22 percent pointed out that they were less 
inclined to vote for him after the selection of Ramirez, and 17 
percent said they would still vote for him. Pastrana still seems 
to be more popular among female voters than Samper, but not by a 
very wide margin. In this respect, the difference in favor of 
Pastrana is only of three or four points, very small if one 
takes into account that the margin of error is only 2.9 percent. 
The results also indicate that the higher the income group, the 
greater the support for Samper. However, his support begins to 
fall as one proceeds from higher, to middle, and to lower income 
groups. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 14 Apr 94 p. 8A)

<F P=106> [Article by Hector Sandoval: "Wasmosy Might Get Burned in </F>
the Blazing Fire"] 
  [Text] The peasants' quasi-revolt enabled nearly all 
independent pundits and some qualified government experts to 
warn that unless there is an turnabout in economic policy soon, 
the fire could spread to the rest of the country. It goes 
without saying that the government cannot publicly acknowledge 
that its economic policy would unavoidably lead to social 
upheaval. Therefore, it inverted the terms of the progressive 
theory asserting that only an "adjustment" would eliminate the 
risk of a debacle. 
  If there is a virtue that is said to characterize every 
statesman, it is constant self-criticism, a periodic assessment 
of his actions. [President Juan Carlos] Wasmosy does not excel 
in this quality. 
  Whether it was scared or not, by the change of the social 
sectors' tune in the face of the negligence shown by those who 
wield power, the government had recourse to an old scheme that 
is as threadbare as it is hardly believable -- it claimed that 
demonstrations were fostered by professional agitators. For 
lack of socialist governments that support subversion in the 
interior of the country (communist regimes barely survive amidst 
their misfortunes), it began to point accusingly at the press. 
It assured time and again that there are no social problems. 
  A well-known face looms up in this climate pregnant with 
pressures -- violence from above. The signs are clear. [Public 
Works and Communications] Minister Carlos Facceti himself took 
the liberty of adopting, to everybody's dismay, the "guerrilla" 
fashion when stating that tire busters and all sorts of barriers 
were going to be used because there were indications of 
impending dangers in the peasants' march. 
  It is obvious that the intelligence service's game is 
fanning 
the flames of this whole affair. Otherwise, it would be 
impossible to account for the similar remarks uttered by nearly 
all the men close to the president. They cannot or do not want 
to believe that starving peasants can actually get organized. 
The same underestimation of peasants was and is a good 
justification for the government to postpone the solution of 
social problems. The same prejudgment leads the government to 
lend more credit to the existence of professional incognito 
agitators behind the disturbance. 
  We should then reflect that here, as well as in many other 
countries, there are individuals who would hail the replacement 
of democracy with other systems that are more "thrilling." 
There is no reason to believe they will be able to do so if the 
rest refuse to collaborate. For the time being, the danger is 
in the possibility that key sectors of the ruling class will let 
themselves be persuaded that violent conflicts are unavoidable 
and that appropriate repressive "precautions" against this 
should be taken. The murder of a peasant leader is a clear 
symptom of this.

<F P=106> [Report by Fernando Granda] </F>
  [Text] Tingo Maria, 22 Apr (EFE) -- The Peruvian Army 
continues its counterterrorist offensive that it began on 5 
April in the Northern Peruvian jungle and is closing in on three 
Shining Path [SL] columns. 
  General Alfredo Rodriguez, the counterterrorist front 
commander of the zone, disclosed that the latest clash between 
terrorists and two Army units took place near the town of San 
Isidro. 
  Sources have stated that soldiers clashed with the SL "Red 
Sea" column, which retreated to what the military call "Spring 
Valley." 
  After the terrorists withdrew, Army troops occupied a SL 
base 
and are pursuing "Red Sea" fugitives who, according to military 
sources, are headed by two SL leaders known as "Rayo" and 
"Pescadito." 
  The military forces involve 380 men, of which 200 are combat 
troops and 180 support troops. They are closing in on the 
terrorists' retreat. 
  Gen. Rodriguez explained that the Peruvian troops are using 
a 
"pincer" move against the terrorists. He added that during 17 
days of clashes, 14 terrorists have been killed and another 15 
have been captured. 
  The military commander explained that these operations, on 
the banks of the Huallaga River in Leoncio Prado Province, 
Huanuco Department in the Northern jungle, have not affected 
civilians living in the combat zones. 
  Gen. Rodriguez said the Army has seized from the SL members 
220 hand grenades, grenade-launcher rifles, 14 FAL rifles, 
bombs, shotguns, percussion caps, and a great quantity of 
ammunition. 
  The terrorist columns are believed to comprise about 250 
men. 
  Military sources have stated that during the past few days 
hundreds of children, women, and elderly people who were forced 
to support the SL in the Peruvian Northern jungle, have 
surrendered to the Army. 
  The source did not disclose the number, site, nor exact date 
when these people surrendered. These people "were slaves" of the 
SL and were divided into "grass-roots forces" and "peoples' 
committees." 
  The SL seems to have used the same system as in the central 
region, where they enslaved thousands of indigenous Ashaninkas 
who are now being gradually rescued. 
  In the next few hours members of the Congressional Human 
Rights Commission and Attorney General Blanca Nelida Colan, will 
travel to the site of operations to try to verify reports on 
alleged attacks against civilians by helicopter gunships. 
  The National Coordinating Board of Human Rights has witness 
reports of helicopter-fired rocket attacks against towns along 
the Huallaga River and a video in which bodies of the alleged 
victims are shown. 
  Legal Defense Institute Director Ernesto de la Jara has said 
that some 40 to 50 civilians died in these attacks and the 
National Coordinating Board of Human Rights has requested the 
intervention of the Red Cross, which has not been allowed to 
visit the zone. 
  Army Commander General Nicolas de Bari Hermoza, travelled to 
Tingo Maria with 30 journalists. Today they will be taken to the 
combat zone. 
  Gen. Hermoza said the SL is dismantled, the Army is 
obstructing its retreat, and the military chiefs are urging the 
terrorists to surrender.

  [Text] Lima, 21 Apr (AFP-NA) -- Analysts today said the 
approval by the great majority in Congress of a draft bill 
submitted by the Lima Bar Association proposing that the 
original National Elections Board (JNE) run the general 
elections scheduled for April 1995, follows a recommendation by 
President Alberto Fujimori to avoid any suspicion of fraud. 
  After three months of unsuccessful debates, the government 
bloc suddenly on the evening of 20 April sided with the minority 
to approve the proposal for the JNE to organize the elections, 
thus freezing the implementation of a new elections system 
provided for in the new Constitution (1993). 
  One political analyst said: "This drastic change was 
prompted 
by a recommendation by President Fujimori." 
  The chief of state allegedly said: "There can be no 
suspicion 
of fraud if the adversary's rules are used." 
  The draft bill was approved by 55 votes to four, with three 
abstentions. It is divided into 11 articles. The first article 
states: The JNE, fully renewed, will organize the national 
electoral process for the election of president, vice president, 
and legislators. 
  The JNE will comprise five members: One chosen by the 
Supreme 
Court, one by the Board of Supreme Court Prosecutors, one by the 
Lima Bar Association, one by the deans of the law schools of the 
public universities, and one by the deans of the law schools of 
private universities. 
  It also states that by next July, at the latest, the JNE 
should have a comprehensive single text of the election rules to 
be used in April 1995. 
  Moreover, it must draft the regulations for the operation of 
the voters' registry and come up with a vote return system to 
expedite the vote tally. 
  Constitution Commission President Carlos Torres y Torres 
justified the "sudden change of mind," stating that it sought to 
prevent people from "talking about fraud." 
  Henry Pease of the Democratic Left Movement (MDI), among 
others, praised the decision. 
  "The opposition was being pressed by public opinion and had 
no other alternative than to back down."

  [Text] Doctor Gustavo Roosen has assumed the task of 
revitalizing the Venezuelan banking system, after being sworn in 
today at Miraflores Palace as presidential commissioner for the 
reform of the financial system. 
  Roosen will exercise the office simultaneously with his 
current position as chairman of the Board of Trustees of Banco 
Latino. In a lengthy news conference held after being sworn in, 
Roosen presented his six-point plan to rescue the national 
banking system: reaching a solidarity accord with private banks, 
strengthening the Superintendency of Banks, reorganizing Fogade 
[Deposit Guarantee and Banking Protection Fund], reducing 
nominal interest rates and the differential between nominal and 
real interest rates, defining new financial instruments to 
replace the zero-coupon bonds, and establishing a plan of 
rehabilitation or major surgery for banks assisted by Fogade. 
  [Begin Roosen recording] If we are able to strike a pact of 
solidarity regarding what I mentioned in my initial explanation, 
the country will see a change and will see a restoration in 
confidence, which was key in the case of Banco Latino. 
  I am convinced by the conversations I held yesterday morning 
and last night, which prompted me to accept this difficult task, 
that the government is ready, the Central Bank is ready, and, as 
a result of my contacts with fellow bankers as chairman of the 
Board of Trustees, I am convinced the banks are also ready for 
this solidarity pact. This is key to eliminating the uncertainty 
that affects the financial system at this time. [end recording] 
  Dr. Gustavo Roosen said that meetings with the private banks 
will begin this weekend in an attempt to sign the solidarity 
accord. A 72-hour deadline was set for its signing.

<F P=106> [Report by Vicente Briceno from Miraflores Presidential </F>
Palace in Caracas from the "Union Radio News" newscast] 
  [Text] Dr. Gustavo Roosen, who has been appointed special 
commissioner for reforming the financial system, said a few 
minutes ago that within the next 72 hours he intends to 
establish a solidarity pact between commercial banks and the 
Central Bank of Venezuela to preserve the country's financial 
network. 
  Speaking at Miraflores Palace, Dr. Roosen broadly outlined 
the complex situation for reporters. He said this pact is 
intended to clarify the issuance of financial instruments, which 
can help ease the situation by decreasing the issuance of 
zero-coupon bonds and, in place of these bonds, issuing Treasury 
bills of exchange that would be purchased by domestic banks. 
  [Begin Roosen recording] In accepting this important duty, 
we 
intend to coordinate between the Finance Ministry, the 
superintendency of banks, FOGADE [Deposit Guarantee and Banking 
Protection Fund], and the Central Bank of Venezuela in every way 
possible in an effort to establish a solidarity pact to restore 
confidence in the financial system. 
  We will do this by implementing programs that lead to the 
recovery of subsidized banks, gradually reducing the current gap 
between passive and active interest rates in the national 
market, and seeking ways to use the system's financial surpluses 
in the placement of Treasury bills of exchange or financial 
instruments other than zero-coupon bonds, which has been the 
only available mechanism to remove surplus liquidity from 
circulation. [end recording]

  [Text] Gustavo Roosen, the chairman of the Banco Latino 
Board of Trustees, has hinted that the government is preparing a 
program to rescue the Venezuelan financial sector, which is 
currently experiencing a crisis, to prevent the situation from 
deteriorating. Roosen outlined what he thinks should be done to 
extricate the financial sector from its current difficulties. 
  [Begin recording] [Roosen] I believe that a current of 
opinion is forming on the crisis and that people are very 
willing to generate ideas and solutions to confront the 
emergency. Such efforts should result in a program that can be 
announced to the country in the near future. 
  [Unidentified reporter] [words indistinct] 
  [Roosen] I presume the economy minister will have that 
responsibility. 
  [Reporter] But there has to be a way to get the financial 
sector out of its current crisis based on [words indistinct]? 
  [Roosen] Based precisely on that, of course. 
  [Reporter] Based on what? 
  [Roosen] Based on the fact that the banks' account 
portfolios 
will suffer progressive deterioration with the current high 
interest rates. I believe that 1) the financial sector totally 
agrees that this is the situation; 2) the intermediate margins 
between the active and passive rates are too high and have to be 
reduced so that an appropriate remuneration for the activity can 
be obtained; 3) the banks, which have been financially aided, 
require major surgery and a reorganization program that will 
allow their privatization as soon as possible; and 4) the 
financial aid mechanism that is [word indistinct] directly to 
the banks and is managed more efficiently must be reformed 
because those banks end up putting their money in zero coupons 
because they cannot find clients. A solution for survival has to 
be found to reverse the cycle that has been established. Those 
are the four points on which we have to reach a consensus in the 
coming days to effectively stop the financial crisis, return the 
country to financial order, and restore its payment system. We 
must see economic growth more clearly. Thus, government policies 
regarding economic growth also have to be established. [end

  [Text] Just as we reported earlier, FOGADE [Deposit 
Guarantee and Banking Protection Fund] President Esperanza 
Martino tendered her resignation before Congress President 
Eduardo Gomez Tamayo. In a communique, the FOGADE president said 
she does not want to become a negative factor within the 
Venezuelan financial and political systems. She adds she has a 
clear conscience because she fulfilled her duties. 
  [Begin Martino recording] Quite frankly, I feel very 
disappointed that having succeeded in obtaining financial aid 
that had practically reached 1 billion bolivares, last night it 
topped 8 billion bolivares. [sentence as heard] Does this help 
at all? This proves that this week's events have been a 
determining factor in once again creating a climate of upheaval 
among depositors. 
  I am not blaming the Venezuelan Central Bank [BCV]. During 
my 
interpellation yesterday, at no time did I say the BCV was 
responsible. In this case, all of the authorities are 
responsible, and I assume full responsibility in my capacity as 
FOGADE president and as president of the FOGADE Board of 
Directors. 
  All of this financial assistance was granted with the 
approval of both boards. Were we wrong? No! At this stage I 
cannot say that I was wrong; on the contrary, I believe it has 
been done very well and I believe a financial crash has been 
prevented, and this is important for the country. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Article by Carlos Subero] </F>
  [Text] The results of the December 1993 elections placed 
nearly every state government in a situation of instability. The 
initial consequences have already been seen in the States of 
Amazonas and Anzoategui, where the recently installed 
legislatures have rejected the governor's annual report by a 
two-thirds majority. 
  There are two reasons why this trend is being seen right 
now. 
The first is the multiparty coalitions that emerged in most 
states, where the voters switched from the two-party balance 
that had prevailed until recently. As a result, in several 
states the governors ended up without enough executive political 
clout to block the rejection of the annual report they are 
supposed to submit to the representative body of their state for 
consideration. 
  But the other reason is that the regional legislators 
elected 
in 1988 were in office for five years, until 1993, while the 
governors were elected in 1992, a year earlier, when a different 
balance of power prevailed. The mistake, which the State Public 
Office Term Act failed to correct, occurred in 1988, when 
Congress approved the popular election of governors but did not 
change the law so that the regional legislatures that would 
control these leaders could be elected at the same time. The 
instability created by this factor will end in 1995, however, 
when elections for both levels will be held on the same day. 
  In 12 states, it is the balance of power that has caused the 
instability of the popularly elected government, because it is a 
minority government. These states are Amazonas, Anzoategui, 
Aragua, Carabobo, Falcon, Guarico, Lara, Merida, Miranda, 
Portuguesa, Sucre, and Zulia. 
  There are four other cases in which the instability is a 
result of the governor's inability to marshal the support of all 
the legislators who would normally be allied with him. It is 
common for a few ruling-party deputies to jump ship, which 
undermines the governor's political base in the legislature. 
  Right now the governors elected in 1992 are submitting their 
first annual reports. If a two-thirds majority votes to reject 
the report, the governor is automatically removed from office, 
and new elections are called. Although the same thing may happen 
next year with their second report of the three-year term, 
however, a rejection by a two-thirds majority will not result in 
new elections being called, but the legislature will appoint 
someone to finish out the term. 
  The minority governors can negotiate to remain in office, 
and 
in other cases, the opposition itself could be ejected because 
the governor is extremely popular and might run again in the new 
elections. 
  Here is the current situation in each state: 
<H5>  Amazonas </H5>
  The assembly has just voted Governor Edgar Sayago out of 
office with seven out of 11 votes, the four deputies of 
Democratic Action (AD) having joined together with the three 
deputies of the Movement Toward Socialism (MAS). Sayago had the 
support of the three deputies of the Social Christian Party 
(Copei) and Convergence's one deputy. It was decided that seven 
votes constituted two-thirds of the legislature. 
  A lot of political shifting has taken place in this state. 
Sayago used to be a member of AD until 1992, when he was 
expelled. He ran as a MAS candidate, and won the governorship in 
a coalition with Unity for Advancement (UPA) and ORA [expansion 
not given]. But then he lost MAS's support and won over Copei, 
and more recently Convergence. 
  The elections to decide who will be governor are set for 24 
April. 
<H5>  Anzoategui </H5>
  This is another state where the annual report has been 
rejected by a two-thirds majority. Governor Ovidio Gonzalez was 
reelected in December 1992 with 51.70 percent of the valid votes 
in a self-described "ethical alliance" of 17 political groups, 
headed by Copei, MAS, the People's Electoral Movement (MEP), and 
ORA. 
  The balance of power in the legislative assembly was changed 
by the 1993 elections, resulting in the instability that has 
brought down Gonzalez's government. There are 19 deputies 
altogether, with six for AD, six for Cause R, four for Copei, 
two for Convergence, and one for MAS, the latter being the only 
one who voted in favor of the annual report. 
<H5>  Apure </H5>
  The governor is Marcelo Oquendo (AD), elected with 53.24 
percent of the vote in December 1992. AD has seven of the 13 
members of the assembly, which would allow it to block the 
formation of a two-thirds majority of nine regional legislators. 
Copei has five, Convergence one. 
  Nevertheless, problems could arise here because Governor 
Oquendo has disagreements with the party's local chapter, which 
took him to the disciplinary tribunal recently. The instability 
has resulted from these problems. 
<H5>  Aragua </H5>
  Carlos Tablante has been governor since 1989, having been 
reelected in 1992 with 62.73 percent of the vote. There are 
instability problems because the new balance of political power 
in the legislature means that the governor has to depend on the 
support of the MAS-Convergence axis. 
  There are 21 deputies, of which six represent MAS and three 
Convergence. These nine deputies can block a two-thirds majority 
vote to reject the annual report, which requires 14 votes. Cause 
R has six deputies, AD three, and Copei three, adding up to 12 
opposition votes, not enough to muster the majority vote needed 
to bring about the immediate removal of the governor. 
  It should be noted that Tablante was a minority governor 
when 
he took office in 1989. But by entering into personal agreements 
with deputies who had deserted AD and Copei, he managed to forge 
a solid base of support that enabled him to govern without 
legislative hindrance. 
<H5>  Barinas </H5>
  Problems arose here in the 1989 election, causing repeat 
elections to be held in May 1993. Gehard Cartay is governor, 
having won 52 percent of the vote in an alliance headed by Copei 
and MAS. The new balance of power, in which Copei has five of 
the 13 legislative votes, gives him a certain margin of safety. 
His government has encountered a variety of problems, but Cartay 
has very good relations with President Caldera. AD has five 
deputies in the legislature, and the other three belong to 
Convergence, MAS, and Cause R, with one each. 
<H5>  Bolivar </H5>
  Andres Velasquez (Cause R) was elected in December 1992 to 
serve his last term as governor of this state with 63 percent of 
the valid votes for his party. Cause R has 12 of the 19 deputies 
in the legislature, which assures it of approval of the annual 
report. During his last term he was a minority governor, but 
although AD and Copei voted against his annual report, they did 
not have enough votes for the two-thirds majority necessary to 
force new elections. Now Velasquez enjoys strong support in the 
legislature. AD has four of the 19 seats, Copei two, and MAS one. 
<H5>  Carabobo </H5>
  Henrique Salas Romer was reelected in December 1992 with 73 
percent of the vote in an alliance headed by Copei and MAS. Last 
December's elections, however, changed the balance of power in 
the legislature compared to the 1988 elections. 
  In this state, as in almost all the others in the central 
part of the country, AD and Copei lost power to Cause R, MAS and 
Convergence. AD and Copei now have only three deputies each, 
accounting for six of the 22. The other deputies belong to Cause 
R (eight), Convergence (four), and MAS (four). A two-thirds 
majority requires 15 votes, and can be blocked with eight votes. 
  Governor Salas Romer, a politician whom President Caldera 
regards very highly, has good relations with Convergence. He did 
not take a stand in favor of the Copei candidate during the 
election campaign, in contrast to Ovidio Gonzalez, who not only 
favored the Copei candidate but also attacked Caldera's 
candidacy. Despite Copei's fall in Carabobo, one good sign for 
Governor Salas is the fact that in the only district where Copei 
won, the candidate was his son. 
  There were problems with the installation of the legislature 
in this state, and ultimately the executive board of the 
legislature ended up in the hands of Cause R and AD. The 
governor's stability will depend on his skill in negotiating 
with Convergence and neutralizing AD. In this state, most of the 
party votes went to Cause R. 
<H5>  Cojedes </H5>
  Governor Jose Felipe Machado won in 1992 with 44 percent of 
the vote, basically the vote garnered by his party, Copei. This 
government is somewhat stable, since Copei won the state 
elections in December. Six of the 12 seats in the legislature 
are held by Copei, four by AD, and one each by Convergence and 
Cause R. It takes eight votes to get a two-thirds majority, 
which can be blocked with five votes. 
<H5>  Delta Amacuro </H5>
  Partial elections have already been called in this state for 
10 April to decide who was elected governor on 6 December 1992, 
given that the Supreme Court of Justice has annulled a group of 
official vote tallies. 
  In this case, the new legislative assembly elected on 5 
December 1993 has nothing to do with the instability; it was 
caused by irregularities in the 1992 elections. 
  The balance of power in the legislature of this new state 
involves minority factions of AD, Copei, MAS, and Convergence. 
The Supreme Electoral Council (CSE) decided to call elections, 
but it left in power Governor Emery Mata Millan, whose election 
has been called into question. Mr. Mata Millan was elected with 
the support of Copei, which has only three deputies in the 
11-member legislature; but he has another group, MERI [expansion 
not given], with two deputies. MAS, whose leader, Armando 
Salazar, has gubernatorial aspirations, also has only three 
deputies. AD, Cause R, and Convergence have one deputy each. 
<H5>  Falcon </H5>
  Another state whose government was left in a difficult 
position, without sufficient support in the legislature, is 
Falcon, where Aldo Cermeno has been governor since 1989. He was 
reelected in 1992 with 51 percent of the vote in an alliance 
involving Copei, MAS, and other groups. MAS has already 
abandoned him, and with the results of last December's 
elections, the balance of power in the legislature has left him 
in a precarious position. 
  Copei ended up with five of the 15 deputy seats. But the 
other 10, which constitute a two-thirds majority, are against 
it: Convergence with five, AD with four, and Cause R with one. 
Aldo Cermeno is on notice that he may be the next governor whose 
annual report is challenged. 
<H5>  Guarico </H5>
  Governor Jose Malave Risso, Copei's 1992 candidate, won with 
45.25 percent of the vote. Copei, however, won only three of the 
15 seats in the legislature elected last December, leaving its 
governor without sufficient backing in the state's legislative 
body. He is another governor who may soon be ousted by a 
two-thirds majority vote rejecting his report. 
  AD controls the assembly with eight votes, Cause R has two, 
and MAS and Convergence have one each. Malave Risso became 
Guarico's governor with Caldera's backing in 1992, but later he 
publicly supported Alvarez Paz. Even if he could win MAS's and 
Convergence's support in the legislature, the 10 votes belonging 
to AD and Cause R would be enough to unseat him. 
  AD is the majority party in this state. 
<H5>  Lara </H5>
  This is another state that is having problems, although not 
exactly caused by the new balance of power. The CSE called 
partial elections for governor under an order from the Supreme 
Court, which annulled vote tallies. Mariano Navarro (AD) is 
still governor, but the MAS-Convergence axis swept the December 
elections and is now predominant with 12 of the 23 seats in the 
assembly. AD has five, Copei four, and Cause R two. 
  Even if Mariano Navarro is retained as governor in the 10 
April elections, his annual report could be rejected by a 
two-thirds majority if Copei decided to vote with Convergence, 
Cause R, and MAS. This state government is unstable as long as 
AD is in power. 
<H5>  Merida </H5>
  Governor Jesus Rondon Nucete (Copei) was reelected in 1992 
with 49 percent of the vote. The balance of power resulting from 
the December elections left him in a difficult position, 
however, as his party won only four of the 15 seats. The other 
11, which constitute a two-thirds majority, are held by 
Convergence (six), AD (four), and Cause R (one). 
<H5>  Miranda </H5>
  Copei Governor Arnaldo Arocha Vargas was reelected in 
December 1992, running basically as a Copei-MAS candidate in an 
alliance of 17 groups. He won with 62.3 percent of the vote. The 
balance of power in the assembly is now even, with Cause R 
holding eight as the primary party, Copei holding six, AD and 
Convergence each holding four, and MAS holding one. Fifteen 
votes are needed to remove the governor by rejecting his annual 
report. Arocha Vargas was a Caldera governor during his first 
term, and he is thought to have good relations with the 
president. During the campaign, he gave tepid support to Alvarez 
Paz. 
<H5>  Monagas </H5>
  Guillermo Call (AD) is governor. His party took first place 
in the recent 1993 elections and now has seven of the 15 deputy 
seats, giving it a wide margin of stability. It does not have a 
majority in the legislature, so the governor's report may be 
voted down, but his stay in office would not be threatened. Call 
was reelected in 1992 with 52.4 percent of the vote. 
  Cause R has three deputies in the legislature, Copei three, 
and Convergence two, constituting a simple majority. 
<H5>  Nueva Esparta </H5>
  Morel Rodriguez (AD) has been governor of this island state 
since 1989. He was reelected in 1992 with 48.81 percent of the 
vote, giving him a slight lead over Rafael Tovar (Copei). The 
elections are being challenged in court. 
  AD controls six of the 13 seats in the legislature. Copei 
has 
four, and Cause R, Convergence, and MAS have one each. The 
opposition to this governor now has a simple majority to vote 
against his report, but it does not have the nine votes required 
for a two-thirds majority. 
<H5>  Portuguesa </H5>
  Governor Elias D'Ongia has been in office since 1989. He was 
reelected in 1992 with just 36.8 percent of the vote, and the 
results are being challenged in the Supreme Court. 
  The new balance of power left him in a precarious position, 
although his party still has the largest minority share. There 
are five groups: AD has five of the 15 legislators, and the 
other 10, who make up a two-thirds majority, are divided among 
Copei (four), Convergence (three), MAS (two), and Cause R (one). 
The balance of power is unstable. 
<H5>  Sucre </H5>
  The elections in this state were repeated in May 1993. The 
governor is Ramon Martinez (MAS). The balance of power in the 
legislature is unstable. AD has six of the 17 deputies, MAS 
five, Copei three, Cause R two, and Convergence one. 
  With 11 votes against his annual report, the governor will 
be 
out of office. The government can block the removal with seven 
votes. 
<H5>  Tachira </H5>
  Governor Ron Sandoval (AD) was reelected in 1992 with 45 
percent of the vote. The new balance of power in the Tachira 
legislature gives AD six of the 19 votes. Thirteen votes are 
needed to oust the governor by rejecting the report. The 
opposition has exactly 13 votes, divided as follows: Copei six, 
Convergence three, Cause R and MAS two each. 
<H5>  Trujillo </H5>
  Governor Jose Mendez Quijada (AD) was reelected in 1992 with 
48.4 percent of the vote. AD kept enough power in the regional 
legislature after last year's elections to block rejection of 
the annual report by two-thirds majority. 
  AD won six of the 15 legislative seats, leaving nine for the 
opposition. Ten votes are necessary to remove Governor Trujillo: 
Copei has five, Convergence three, and Cause R one. 
<H5>  Yaracuy </H5>
  Nelson Suarez Montiel (Copei) is governor of this state, 
having been reelected in 1992 in an alliance of 24 parties, led 
by Copei. At that time he won 66 percent of the vote. After the 
December elections, however, his government became unstable. 
Nine votes are needed to remove him, and eight of them are held 
by the opposition: Convergence four, AD two, and MAS and Cause R 
one each. Copei has five deputies who, if they all continue to 
support the governor, can block a two-thirds majority vote to 
reject the report. 
<H5>  Zulia </H5>
  Lolita Aniyar de Castro (MAS-Convergence) is governor. This 
is the only one of the 22 states where the governor was elected 
at the same time as the legislative assembly. The balance of 
power ended up unfavorable to the elected leader, however: MAS, 
Convergence, and Cause R, which supported Governor Aniyar, have 
eight of the 24 votes in the legislature; Copei has 10 and AD 
six. AD and Copei between them constitute a two-thirds majority. 
  The report to be submitted this year is not about the work 
of 
the current governor, however, since Aniyar just started her 
term.
