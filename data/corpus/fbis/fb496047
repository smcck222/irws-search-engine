  [Excerpts] An offensive by Golboddin-Dostam's militia was 
aborted this morning by Islamic Army forces. A source from the 
General Command of Kabul Garrison told a BIA military 
correspondent that the infamous militia of Golboddin-Dostam 
launched a failed offensive at about 0500 this morning from an 
easterly direction. It was aborted in the first few hours as a 
result of the resistance and defense of mojahedin and the 
Islamic Army forces. The rebellious militia suffered 40 
casualties and dozens of injuries and a number of their light 
and heavy weapons were destroyed. According to another report, 
following their defeat, the failed militia subjected residential 
areas and public utility to blind rocket attacks. As a result 
of those savage attacks five compatriots were injured. 
Similarly, as a result of a rocket landing in the contagious 
diseases hospital two of our compatriots were slightly injured 
and the hospital building was damaged. [passage omitted] 
  After a failed attack in Samangan Province, the infamous 
militia faced a counteroffensive by forces of the Islamic Army 
of Afghanistan, and three enemy positions were conquered. A 
DShK machine-gun, 10 Kalashnikovs, a PK machine-gun, along with 
a quantity of the militia's ammunitions have been captured by 
the Islamic Army Mojahedin in the operation. The enemy's 
offensive started from the east and west of (Shorotyar) in 
Dehkoh where it was heavily dislodged as a result of joint 
operations of the Islamic Army forces under the command of the 
great jehadi commanders esteemed Mawlawi Din Mohammad and 
esteemed Khoshbakht. The enemy suffered heavy losses.

  [Text] Tunis, April 10 (AFP)--PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat 
pressed the United States Sunday to step up efforts to ensure 
the successful launch of Palestinian self-rule as Israel and the 
PLO resumed talks in Cairo, the official Palestinian news agency 
WAFA reported. 
  'Arafat urged US Secretary of State Warren Christopher to 
make "the maximum effort" to ensure the success of the 
negotiations, during a telephone conversation. 
  The PLO leader stressed the importance of meeting the April 
13 deadline set for Israel to withdraw from the occupied Gaza 
Strip and West Bank town of Jericho. 
  Under the Israeli-PLO Declaration of Principles signed in 
September Israel was due to complete its troop withdrawal by 
April 13, but implementation of the deal was delayed by 
disagreements over security arrangements and the February 25 
Hebron massacre. 
  'Arafat said any Israeli failure to respect the timetable 
set 
out in the autonomy deal "will have negative repercussions on 
the whole peace process and threaten its credibility," WAFA 
reported. 
  The PLO leader also called for the rapid deployment of an 
international presence in the occupied territories, in line with 
UN Security Council Resolution 904 of March 18, which condemned 
the Hebron massacre and allowed for international protection for 
the Palestinians. 
  Israel and the PLO agreed last month that 160 lightly-armed 
observers from Norway, Denmark and Italy would be deployed in 
Hebron, where a Jewish settler shot dead 30 Arab worshipers in a 
mosque. 
  The two sides began a new round of talks in Cairo on Sunday 
in a bid to resolve remaining differences, including a timetable 
for Israeli withdrawal and the deployment of a Palestinian 
police force. 
  'Arafat and Christopher also discussed the escalating 
violence in the occupied territories, and the harm it could 
inflict on "the entire Middle East peace process and the 
(Israeli-PLO) negotiations," WAFA reported. 
  'Arafat discussed the same issues by telephone with US civil 
rights leader Jesse Jackson, currently visiting Israel, the 
agency said. 
  The PLO leader thanked Jackson for his "worthy efforts to 
support the just cause of the Palestinian people and the peace 
process." 
  Jackson, who arrived in Israel Thursday, has held talks with 
Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and Palestinian leaders 
in East Jerusalem.

  [Text] The Palestinian-Israeli talks on the implementation 
of the Gaza-Jericho agreement will resume in Cairo today. The 
Palestinian side will be chaired by Dr. Nabil Sha'th, 
Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat's political adviser. The 
Israeli side will be chaired by General Amnon Shahaq, Israeli 
deputy chief of staff. 
  Shim'on Peres stated that there is a great possibility of 
completing the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho at the 
end of the current month. Peres said in an interview with the 
Qatari newspaper AL-SHARQ that the forces of the Israeli army 
have started withdrawing from the autonomy area. 
  Last night, Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa held a meeting with 
PLO Executive Committee member Mahmud 'Abbas. 
  The foreign minister stated after the meeting that the 
meeting is part of the framework of the continuing 
Palestinian-Egyptian coordination in the peace process. He said 
that they discussed the current stage of the peace talks, which 
will resume this morning. He said this new round of talks will 
continue for two or three days, after which the two sides will 
be able to set the date for starting implementation of the 
Declaration of Principles. 
  PLO Executive Committee member Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh stated 
yesterday that the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles 
is in its death throes. 'Abd-Rabbuh demanded that immediate 
talks should be started on the final position of all the 
occupied territories. He said that autonomy talks with Israel 
cannot continue because it wants total hegemony over the 
Palestinian police force in the occupied territories.

  [Text] The U.S. deputy secretary of state, Mr. Strobe 
Talbott, said that his visit to Pakistan was most productive and 
useful. The United States shares with Pakistan the objective of 
nuclear nonproliferation in South Asian region. Talking to 
newsmen at Chaklala base before his departure for Europe, Mr. 
Talbott said Pakistan and the United States would pursue their 
approach toward nonproliferation in South Asian region and on a 
variety of subjects. He made it clear that the U.S. approach to 
nonproliferation was multidimensional. He said he has a great 
degree of optimism for achieving concrete results in the future 
that will serve the security and political interests of Pakistan. 
  The foreign secretary, Mr. Najmuddin Sheikh, said there was 
no question of an agreement on nuclear nonproliferation, but 
discussions will continue in order to arrive at a mutually 
agreed approach. He said the two sides agreed that there should 
be capping, reduction, and elimination of nuclear weapons from 
South Asia as well as weapons of mass destruction. The foreign 
secretary said Pakistan explained its stand and position on the 
nuclear issue and Mr. Talbott certainly has a much clearer 
understanding of Pakistan's position.

  [Text] In a swift and urgent retaliation to the brutal 
operations carried out by the forces of tyrant Saddam in the 
marshes of southern Iraq, the Islamic resistance forces launched 
a series of heroic attacks against the regime's forces and 
oppressive establishments in al-Nasiriyah Governorate late last 
month. The resistance operations followed a brutal attack 
launched by the regime. 
  Our sources in the governorate said an Islamic resistance 
group directed a destructive blow to the al-Nasiriyah Security 
Directorate. Mortar shells were used in the attack, which 
damaged [words indistinct] near the governorate office. Four 
members of the governorate office, including two officers, were 
killed. At the same time, the Islamic resistance directed a 
painful blow to one of the offices of the ruling party in 
al-Nasiriyah, known as the al- Muthanna branch. Three criminals 
were killed and a number of others were injured. Another 
Islamic resistance group delivered a devastating blow to a 
security center in the city of al-Bakr, north of al-Nasiriyah. 
Six regime members were injured and massive material damage was 
inflicted on the center. 
  Our sources noted panic among the regime agents. The 
authorities almost completely closed off the entrances to 
al-Nasiriyah, isolating the governorate from the other southern 
and central governorates. Searches, raids, and arrests of 
citizens were launched and the regime forces were put on maximum 
alert.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin by </F>
Karmit Gay and political correspondent Shlomo Raz -- live] 
  [Text] [Gay] It will be 13 April in two days. Target 
date or not, it seems to be farther away than before. A closure 
has been imposed on the territories after a wave of terror 
attacks, and we do not seem to be making any progress. 
  [Rabin] I disagree. The government has decided to opt for a 
political solution on the basis of the Declaration of 
Principles, signed in Washington, and the Cairo agreement, which 
settled the main security points regarding Gaza and Jericho. It 
states precisely that the Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip 
will remain there in blocs and details the travel procedures for 
the Israelis there. We should remember that there are 5,000 
Israelis and 750,000 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. The 
agreement also settled the problem of the border crossings, as 
well as responsibility for external security on land, at sea, 
and in the air. Naturally, at the same time we are dealing with 
those Palestinians who fight the agreement through terrorism, 
primarily against Israelis. We suffered a severe blow in the 
ruthless murder in 'Afula by a suicide terrorist who activated a 
car bomb near a bus stop there. We suffered many fatalities in 
that instance. This war, conducted primarily against the Hamas 
[Islamic Resistance Movement] and Islamic Jihad terror 
organizations, continues. One of their men attacked passengers 
at the Ashdod Junction. We are aware of this, and we will fight 
them with all our might. I believe we will defeat them, 
although we have witnessed terror attacks in the past, and I 
fear that there is no hermetic solution to the problem of 
terrorism. We have not achieved this in the 46 years of the 
existence of the State of Israel. 
  Our effort today is directed at attaining a compound 
solution, one aspect of which is political -- that is, getting 
rid of Gaza. I would be very glad to see the moment when 
Israeli soldiers, in the framework of an agreement -- not a 
withdrawal without agreement -- will no longer have to move 
around Greater Gaza, with its 750,000 residents, and suffer 
casualties as we did during the seven years of intifadah. 
  [Raz] Mr. Rabin, you speak of a political effort. Will the 
indefinite closure that is part of the war on terrorism, as you 
announced at the cabinet session yesterday, not harm the effort 
to attain an agreement with the PLO? Cabinet ministers warned 
yesterday that it might make 'Arafat refuse to assume 
responsibility for the territory. 
  [Rabin] I do not think so. I believe 'Arafat and his 
followers will opt for the political solution and take charge of 
the Gaza Strip -- with the exclusion of those matters we agreed 
on in the Cairo agreement and the accompanying map, of course. 
I believe we have the right to protect ourselves, especially 
when there is a political opening and the option of reaching an 
agreement. We did not suspend the discussions following a 
Palestinian terror act against us; he did, after the Hebron 
massacre. Therefore, we are not to blame for lost time. 
  The government must provide for maximum security, and this 
is 
not easy. For example, the car bomb that resulted in the 
deplorable crime in 'Afula was stolen in Tel Aviv and bore an 
Israeli license plate. Some 10,000 cars with Israeli license 
plates cross from Judaea and Samaria into the territory of 
Israel daily. The soldiers and policemen make every effort to 
check them. Let us not forget that there are dirt roads they 
can take. A suicide terrorist who is willing to die may succeed 
here and there. We will do everything possible to prevent this, 
but there have been five car-bomb attacks by terrorists. We are 
dealing with terror organizations the likes of which we did not 
know three years ago. The method of operation of Hamas and the 
Islamic Jihad and their readiness to commit suicide is 
reminiscent of Hizballah in Lebanon, which caused us serious 
damage and many fatalities in the past. Yet we will deal with 
and overcome this problem in a compound move consisting of a 
political solution and military activity. 
  [Raz] Perhaps the best way to deal with those 
organizations is not by imposing a closure but by stopping the 
political process because it is causing more Israeli fatalities? 
  [Rabin] I believe you cannot compare the situation today 
with that in the past. Stopping the negotiations would be a 
victory for the enemies of peace, on the Palestinian side 
primarily, as well as the opposition to peace in Israel. A 
loathsome murderer who committed the crime in 'Afula should not 
be rewarded by our stopping the political process. 
  [Gay] Are we not rewarding those who refuse to condemn it or 
at least openly stand up to those who are trying to kill the 
process? 
  [Rabin] I believe 'Arafat made a grave mistake when he did 
not condemn the attack; however, his conduct is no yardstick for 
the Israeli Government. Therefore, I do not believe that 
stopping the negotiations is the right thing to do. It would be 
giving a prize to those who kill Israelis and want to kill the 
peace. 
  [Gay] We have heard a lot about the need to consider 
'Arafat's domestic difficulties, but it seems that support for 
the agreement among the Israeli people is waning. 
Demonstrations against it are staged every evening at main 
crossroads. Does this not worry you? 
  [Rabin] Allow me first to address the Palestinian side of 
the issue. The fact is that I suggested imposing a closure 
because, first of all, we must take every step to provide more 
security for the 97 percent of Israelis who reside within the 
boundaries of sovereign Israel, including united Jerusalem. 
Naturally, we have an obligation to protect the 3 percent of 
Israeli citizens who live in the territories of Judaea, Samaria, 
and Gaza. 
  As for the opposition here, as long it is within the 
boundaries of the law and is reasonable, it is legitimate in a 
democratic state. I believe the extreme right has crossed red 
lines. I do not recall that when the terror attack in which we 
suffered the most fatalities since the State of Israel was 
established took place -- I am referring to the 1978 attack on 
the bus on the Coastal Road, between Herzliyya and Tel Aviv -- 
any of us called the government bloody or turned the blood shed 
there into a tool for political gains. The time has come for 
the extreme right to stop rejoicing over spilled blood. 
  [Raz] Let us turn to the other negotiating track: Syria. 
Has there been any development there? The negotiations are to 
resume at the end of this month. 
  [Rabin] The negotiations with Syria will resume, and I 
believe that, following the new framework we discussed during my 
meeting with President Clinton in the United States, we may find 
a way to get the negotiations onto more reasonable tracks than 
those along which they have been conducted so far in Washington. 
  [Raz] Is any preparatory work being done? Are there any new 
tracks? 
  [Rabin] The problem is that there are no additional tracks 
at this time. I feel, however, that the shape of the 
negotiations as we knew them in Washington is no longer 
appropriate. There, the Syrians demanded that Israel pledge a 
full withdrawal in return for full peace, which the Syrians have 
not defined. I will not accept a demand for total withdrawal as 
a precondition for negotiations. Negotiations should deal with 
every aspect: the nature of peace; the extent of withdrawal, 
since Israel had agreed in principle to a withdrawal on the 
Golan Heights; the linkage between peace and withdrawal; 
security arrangements; timetables; the normalization steps to be 
taken at every stage and the duration of the examination of the 
normalization before we withdraw to the agreed upon line -- as 
is well known, we oppose total withdrawal; and, naturally, the 
U.S. contribution to fortifying Israel and to supervising the 
arrangements that will be made with the Syrians in the framework 
of a peace agreement. These issues will have to be examined in 
a comprehensive framework and not as the Syrians have been 
trying to do by saying: First say total withdrawal, and then we 
will talk. This will not serve as the basis for negotiations 
with Syria. 
  [Gay] Another issue on our agenda today: Will you make one 
last move to prevent Knesset Member Hayim Ramon and his friends 
from announcing that they will run on a separate list in the 
Histadrut labor union elections? 
  [Rabin] I held quite a few discussions with Ramon in which I 
did my best to convince him not to run on a separate list. I 
have a lot of regard for Hayim Ramon. He was a very good 
minister and a loyal partner in the last Knesset elections 
campaign. I believe he will be making a grave mistake in terms 
of his cause and his personal career. At the same time, he is a 
big boy now and can make his own decisions. Naturally, as party 
leader I believe it is a mistake to quit the party. All past 
examples show this does not work: Ben-Gurion, Moshe Dayan, 
Shim'on Peres, and many others quit MAPAI [Israel Workers Party] 
in 1965, certain they could score an impressive achievement. 
They won 10 Knesset seats and returned home four years later. 
It would be a shame to try this again. 
  [Gay] Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister. 
  [Rabin] Thank you.

  [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin says getting out of 
the Gaza Strip will bring only good things to Israel. 
Addressing a dinner of the Israel Bonds in Tel Aviv last night, 
the prime minister added that the Gaza settlement of Netzarim, 
despite the fact that only 27 families live there, will remain 
in place, as will all other settlements in the territories. 
This government, declared the prime minister, will continue the 
peace process even if it only has a majority of one. 
  [Begin Rabin recording] We achieved in the agreement with 
the PLO what we could not achieve with anyone: that the unity 
of Jerusalem will not be under question for the interim period; 
that all the settlements will remain in place. Believe me, in 
Greater Gaza, in the Gaza Strip, there are three-quarters of a 
million Palestinians and less than 5,000 Israelis. Netzarim -- 
27 families in the outskirts of Greater Gaza of a quarter of a 
million people. 
  We'll continue. The present Government of Israel, regardless 
to domestic opposition, we are a democracy, and as long as we 
have got a majority in our elected legislative body, we will 
continue. Even if I have got a majority of one, I am determined 
to go on. [end recording]

  [Text] Today the Jerusalem District Court sentenced Barukh 
Marzel to three months in prison, after convicting him of 
rioting near the Prime Minister's Office three years ago. The 
judge determined that Marzel will serve his term immediately 
after he completes his current term in detention. The judge 
pointed out that over the past 14 years, Marzel was convicted 10 
times on similar charges. Ever since he became an adult, this 
person has been violating the law, and his acts indicate that he 
has no regard for the authority of the law and the 
establishments of the state. His criminal record, the judge 
said, calls for severe punishment. 
  Our correspondent Aviv Bushinsky reports that upon coming 
out 
of the courthouse, Marzel claimed that he is being discriminated 
against.

  [Text] London, Al-Tayr [April] 9, JAMAHIRIYAH NEWS AGENCY 
-- The American assistant secretary of state for international 
security said in a press statement on Thursday that Iraq, Iran, 
Libya and North Korea must be prevented from obtaining some 
types of sensitive technology. 
  America suffers from power-mania, practices a strange racial 
discrimination, deals with world resources and peoples' rights 
in a tragic manner and mankind are being threatened as a result 
of American behaviour.

<F P=106> [Statement by Prime Minister Mokdad Sifi, issued in Algiers </F>
on 11 April] 
  [Text] How can I, as a responsible Algerian who has spent 
all his life at the service of the homeland, run away from this 
responsibility, with the certainty that my country can, with the 
help of God Almighty, get rid of its crisis by mobilizing 
everybody and achieving concord and understanding between all 
its loyal sons, Algeria's sons who love Algeria. 
  Thus I have accepted this heavy and difficult responsibility 
represented by taking in charge the burdens of the prime 
minister while I have in my mind the following basic 
preoccupations: 
  -Consolidating the state's institutions, 
  -Reviving the national economy, 
  -Promoting national solidarity. 
  I hope to find among Algerians--I believe this is 
possible--men and women who have the necessary competence to 
achieve the break up which the head of state called for. This 
is the break up with the negative practices of the past. This 
break up will enable to give to this people again confidence in 
itself and in its government, state, and future. 
  The new government headed by Mokdad Sifi will work for the 
respect of all the commitments which Algeria took at the 
national and international levels.

  [Excerpts] The devaluation of the dinar came into effect 
yesterday in implementation of the conditional agreement signed 
by Algerian financial authorities and the International Monetary 
Fund. This measure, which was adopted by the Algerian 
Government, as the economy minister said, on the basis of an 
objective analysis of our economic, financial and monetary 
realities, raised several questions among the public and 
citizens with regard to its direct repercussions on prices, 
salaries and other things. Mourad Benachenhou, the economy 
minister tried to answer these questions in an interview granted 
to today's AL KHABAR. [passage omitted]. 
  The economy minister said that the official devaluation of 
the dinar would have an influence on internal prices only in one 
case, which is an increase in distributed income without an 
equivalent at the level of production. Benachenchou said that 
even if citizens notice an increase in prices they have to know 
that this increase has no link with the economic reality, but 
stems from maneuvers of profiteers who exploit the lack of 
information of citizens about the mechanisms of the economy for 
personal interests. 
  The economy minister said that the devaluation of the dinar 
constitutes an element in any policy aiming at returning to 
sound management of the economy. 
  The value of the dinar is linked to the economic, financial, 
and monetary policy which we will follow. Benachenhou added: If 
we control this policy properly, the value of the dinar will not 
decrease, but if we do not reach a budget in which the income of 
the country and our expenditures are at the same level, we will 
return once more to the devaluation of the dinar. 
  With regard to possible amendments at the level of salaries 
this year, Benachenhou stressed that that matter was linked to a 
change in the revenues of the country. If there is a growth in 
the gross domestic product, there will naturally be a wage 
increase but, as Mourad Benachenhou added, if the opposite takes 
place, any wage increase will lead to inflation and a 
deterioration of the purchasing power of wage earners.

  [Text] Beirut, April 12 (AFP)--A senior leader of Algeria's 
outlawed Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) has blasted a government 
decision to devaluate the dinar and ruled out plans to abide by 
Algeria's future financial accords. 
  The decision to devaluate the dinar by 40 percent which went 
into effect Saturday was "not in Algeria's interest," the 
London-based AL-HAYAH newspaper quoted Rabah Kebir, FIS leader 
outside Algeria, as saying in an interview published Tuesday. 
  Under a deal struck with the International Monetary Fund 
(IMF), Algeria is to receive a 1-billion dollar loan. The 
measure also opened the door for other financial aid to the 
country. 
  "The move does not solve the financial crisis facing 
Algeria. 
It is worsening it," Kebir told AL-HAYAH in the telephone 
interview, according to the daily which is published in several 
Arab capitals. 
  "The front has said in the past its respect for loans 
contracted by the former Algerian Governments but it announced 
after the coup (scrapping of 1992 elections) that it would not 
respect any new loans," Kebir said. 
  The FIS "considers any loan or any financial assistance from 
any country as not beneficial for the Algerian people. 
  "These loans contribute to criminals who kill innocents in 
the streets," he added. 
  The devaluation has triggered criticism in Algeria. 
  Islamic groups have said the government crackdown on 
militants claimed more than 500 lives and was part of a plan to 
"help the country swallow the IMF plan's impoverishing of the 
masses." 
  Algeria's main trade union, the UGTA [General Union of 
Algerian Workers], said it was unhappy that it was not included 
in the IMF negotiations and will call for strikes if the effects 
of the devaluation become unbearable for workers. 
  Other associations said the plan was not well-adapted to 
social conditions in the country and have pledged to form an 
"anti-IMF front." 
  After the devaluation, the dollar stands at 36 dollars.

<F P=106> [Report by Qasiyy Salih al-Darwish: "Madani and Belhadj </F>
Refuse To Meet With Independent Delegation"] 
  [Excerpt] Paris -- Contrary to rumors circulating on the 
Algerian scene in recent days, reliable sources have confirmed 
to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that Abassi Madani and Ali Belhadj, leaders 
of the Islamic Salvation Front, refused to meet with a 
delegation of national figures who are independent of the regime 
and have for two weeks been engaged in a political initiative to 
create a dialogue mechanism to secure a solution to the serious 
political crisis, on the basis that resolving the Algerian 
crisis concerns not only the regime, but all influential 
political forces. 
  According to the sources, Madani and Belhadj voiced a number 
of reservations about this meeting, including the presence of 
former President Ahmed Ben Bella, who made strong criticisms of 
the Salvation Front at different times, even though he is now 
strongly urging the regime to pursue a real and serious dialogue 
policy with all political parties, including the Salvation Front 
leadership. 
  The independent national figures delegation comprised six 
members: Mohamed Saleh Yahiawi and Taher Zobiri (they represent 
the Algeria eastern region; they are two former military 
officials), Ahmed Ben Bella and Ben Ella (they represent the 
western region; the latter was chairman of the council at the 
beginning of independence and governor of one of the states 
during the revolution); and Ahmed Mehsas and Mohamed Said 
Mazouzi (they represent the center; they were both ministers in 
the days of Boumediene, but Mehsas, who is a well-known and 
respected national figure, later resigned from the government 
and lived in exile, joining opposition ranks, while Mazouzi 
remained minister after Boumediene's death, and was considered 
representative of the left wing in the regime. He is from the 
tribes region). 
  Instead of the delegation's meeting with Madani and Belhadj, 
it met with Shaykhs Ali Djeddi and Abdel Kader Boukhamkham, 
members of the Salvation leadership who were released from 
prison recently. The meeting atmosphere was positive, even 
though it did not produce any tangible results. Further 
meetings between the two sides are not ruled out. [passage

  [Text] Cairo, 11 Apr (MENA) -- Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif 
Sidqi has stated that the emergency law will be applied within a 
strictly regulated legal framework and will be subject in all 
cases to judicial supervision. He explained that the powers 
that this law confers on the executive branch will be used 
within the narrowest limits, in accordance with public security 
requirements, and will not infringe on the lawful expression of 
opinion. 
  In a statement to the People's Assembly today, the prime 
minister said that the government will promptly terminate the 
state of emergency as soon as the causes that made it necessary 
disappear. 
  Dr. Sidqi recalled that the government had formerly 
submitted 
to the People's Assembly several reports about the dangers 
threatening the country as a result of extremist, corrupt 
ideologies, and the terrorism organized by lowly, dishonorable 
terrorist groups whose only objective is to sabotage the 
country, spread confusion, and kill innocent people. 
  Sidqi emphasized that the determined battle against 
terrorism 
and extremism will continue unabated until terrorism is 
completely eradicated so that the country's political, economic, 
and social progress can be safeguarded. 
  He explained that this suspect terrorist faction has taken 
the liberty of plundering people's possessions, honor, and lives 
and made free with matters made taboo by God, perpetrating vile 
and ignorant acts, spreading corruption in the world, calling 
society infidel, and separating husband from wife under the 
guise of religion. He declared that true Islam eschews such 
acts. 
  Sidqi said: We must distinguish between piety and terrorist 
extremism. Piety must be encouraged and purified of all 
erroneous and misleading ideologies because religious piety is a 
basic component of the Egyptian citizen's character. A sound 
society capable of development and progress is a society that 
adheres to religious values and codes of conduct that renounce 
violence and terrorism. 
  He pointed out that extremists and terrorists seek to impose 
their custodianship on society through a hardline ideology that 
is contrary to religious teachings or through armed violence and 
bloodshed. He asserted that these acts must be confronted and 
exposed as totally unconnected with religion. 
  Sidqi told the People's Assembly that the government has 
made 
great strides in its campaign to encircle the terrorists, 
extremist rings, and their leaders. He said the security 
services' successful preemptive strikes against them have 
reduced their influence, penetrated their ranks, exposed their 
conspiracies, and destroyed many of their organizational 
structures. 
  He announced that the terrorists and extremists will not 
succeed through their criminal acts in achieving their 
objectives because Egypt is a strong country with a democratic 
system, founded on constitutional provisions and the sovereignty 
of the law. He said Egypt is the home of the venerable 
institution of al-Azhar and its people are committed to their 
values and moderate religion, renounce fanaticism and extremism, 
and are willing to make sacrifices to purge their country from 
the terrorists' vileness and corruption. 
  He explained that the government's policy in combating 
terrorism is firm, courageous, and clear and that it adheres, 
despite the terrorists' excesses, to legality and the 
sovereignty of the law. He added that the government is seeking 
to promote stability and to strengthen and develop the security 
services to enable them to maintain the initiative against 
extremist activity. He explained that the authorities are 
continuing their timely surveillance of the extremists' plans 
and are arresting their leaders and fugitive members, both at 
home and abroad. Sidqi explained that this is being done via 
coordination and cooperation with the concerned departments in 
friendly countries, in line with international and bilateral 
agreements. 
  The prime minister said that emergency laws are primarily 
concerned with enabling the state, in extraordinary 
circumstances, to adopt quick and necessary measures to defend 
security, stability, human life, utilities, and vital 
installations. 
  He continued: There is a need to maintain the state of 
emergency in view of the regrettable terrorist acts in the 
country, including attacks on tourists, assassination of 
officials, bombing of banks, and the treacherous killing of 
innocent citizens, police officers and police commanders. 
  Dr. Sidqi asserted that enforcing the emergency law is not 
an 
aim in itself but an option made necessary by events in order to 
protect our installations, utilities, public order, and homeland 
from those who would wreak destruction on them. 
  He pointed out that Egypt is not alone in applying an 
emergency law and that most other countries have constitutional 
provisions that organize states of emergency and set regulations 
for combating terrorism and extremism. He referred to the UK's 
annual extension of the emergency antiterrorism law in Northern 
Ireland since 1974 by an act of Parliament. He said other 
countries, including France, Italy, and Germany apply such laws 
to fight terrorism when necessary. 
  The prime minister explained to the People's Assembly that 
the state of emergency in Egypt has been in force since 1981 to 
defend important installations and to deter terrorists and 
hostile foreign conspiracies that seek to undermine Egypt's 
stability in concert with local terrorists. He added that it is 
difficult to handle such matters with normal laws whereas 
emergency regulations are designed for such contingencies in 
order to defend the homeland. 
  He reiterated that the extraordinary powers provided by the 
emergency law have not been used in Egypt except within the 
narrowest boundaries, in line with a strictly regulated legal 
framework, and under judicial supervision. He said they have 
never been used to infringe on people expressing lawful views 
and there has not been a single violation of this policy. He 
pointed out that, on the contrary, the government has sometimes 
refrained from using these powers out of confidence in the 
loyalty of the Egyptian public, who will not remain silent about 
any violation of our values, traditions, and morals. 
  Sidqi said this became evident recently when the citizens 
started helping the security forces pursue terrorists and 
extremists. He noted that there is an increasing popular anger 
with the terrorists. 
  In his statement Prime Minister Sidqi affirmed that the 
government has made a pledge to itself and to the People's 
Assembly that it will place the homeland's interest above any 
other consideration and that Egypt's stability and security is 
the first and foremost aim behind the extension of the state of 
emergency. He added that in light of the government's reports to 
the People's Assembly on the security situation, which highlight 
that this problem will remain as long these abnormal ideas exist 
in the minds of some people with limited knowledge and 
experience, presidential Decision No. 116 for 1994 extending the 
state of emergency for another period effective 1 June must be 
approved. 
  Prime Minister Sidqi explained that there are three 
principles that the government has affirmed each time it has 
asked the People's Assembly to extend the emergency law. These 
principles are that the state of emergency will be applied 
strictly in accordance with the law, that the law will be used 
in the narrowest limits, and that the government will not 
hesitate to end the state of emergency once the reasons for it 
no longer exist. 
  Interior Minister Hasan al-Alfi then delivered a statement 
before the People's Assembly on the extension of the emergency 
law. He expressed the opinion that although the emergency law 
is directly linked to the issue of freedoms, it is at the same 
time also linked to grave events, dangers, and threats which are 
fully clear to the whole nation. He said the succession of 
events in the last few months has underlined the size and extent 
of the terrorist threat. In seeking the application of the 
emergency law, the government is fully committed to implementing 
it within the narrowest limits and according the requirements of 
the security situation. He added that facts have imposed 
themselves on the whole nation. It is not only the homeland's 
stability that is being threatened; the homeland's very 
existence and foundations are also being threatened. He 
explained that terrorism is no longer a phenomenon that can be 
dealt with on various integrated levels. Terrorism has become a 
serious challenge to the people's rights and aspirations and an 
overt conspiracy against their destiny. 
  In his statement before the People's Assembly, al-Alfi said 
that the powers entailed in the emergency law have given the 
security authorities an important area for quick and early 
action to confront terrorist schemes. These powers, to which 
there are no alternatives, have boosted the security efforts. 
  Al-Alfi stressed that the terrorist conspiracy aims to push 
the country toward complete chaos by striking at its economic 
interests, assassinating its executive and legislative leaders, 
and attempting to cause sectarian sedition. He explained that 
the terrorist plan in the past few years has resulted in 14 
bombings in densely populated areas, indiscriminate terrorist 
operations that resulted in the death of 97 citizens and the 
wounding of 292 others, and terrorist operations against 35 
tourism targets that led to the death of 12 tourists and the 
wounding of 50 others. This has paralyzed tourism, considerably 
hurt the national income, and deprived thousands of citizens of 
legitimate means of livelihood. He added that matters have 
developed into attempts to target the banking sector. Eight 
bombings have occurred in front of some banks. This plan has 
been contained and most of its elements have been apprehended. 
  Al-Alfi noted that 37 police officers have been killed so 
far, the last of whom was Maj. Gen. Ra'uf Khayrat the day before 
yesterday. A total of 98 policemen have also been killed and 
129 others wounded. 
  Al-Alfi explained that the statistics that he gave affirm 
the 
need to continue with the emergency law. He noted that the 
People's Assembly's approval of the extension of the emergency 
law in the past few years is considered an expression of the 
people's will, a full realization of the dimensions and gravity 
of the situation, and an awareness that some persons' betrayal 
of their homeland has opened the door for foreign designs 
against the country's supreme national interests. 
  Al-Alfi said the current phase of all-out national 
confrontation of this threat is an interim one between the phase 
of seizing the initiative and the phase of full control over the 
dimensions of the terrorist design. He warned that any 
weakening of the powers available for the confrontation elements 
might lead to negative and unfavorable results. He added that 
the security services' confrontation of terrorism is based on a 
conviction that they are authorized by the people to defend 
their ideals and aspirations and to uphold the law. He 
explained that the apprehension of the terrorist groups and the 
discovery of their hideouts are the best testimony that the 
security authorities are determined to confront terrorism to the 
end and without hesitation. He said that whoever believes that 
terrorism can intimidate the people is imagining things. 
  Addressing those opposed to extending the emergency law, 
al-Alfi affirmed that exceptional powers to face exceptional 
circumstances cannot justify the violation of legitimacy and law 
or violating the guarantees and rights of the freedom of 
expression. He also affirmed that not one single measure was or 
will be taken against any view or any political action. 
  The interior minister explained that, despite all the 
guarantees stipulated in the law concerning the extraordinary 
measures granted by the emergency law, the law has not been used 
as a substitute for any judicial measure or for a fair trial of 
any suspect. He said all Egyptian citizens are responsible for 
the nation's stability and defense. He added that the 
government's programs and policy do not discount any serious 
work at political, economic, and social levels in confronting 
terrorism. 
  In his address to the People's Assembly today, al-Alfi said 
the security action with its effectiveness and normal legal 
measures represents a cornerstone in achieving goals and that 
the emergency law is applied only in necessary cases. He 
emphasized that an effective, continuous security action is one 
of the guarantees of adhering to the emergency law in the 
narrowest sense to avert haphazard or unplanned measures. 
  He referred to the guarantees stipulated in Law No. 162 of 
1958, amended by Law No. 50 of 1982 on the regulation of the 
emergency situation. He said the amendments provided in Law No. 
97 of 1992 aimed to criminalize some acts and introduce stricter 
punishment for other punishable crimes. All these amendments, 
he added, did not make any changes to preventive measures and 
arrangements that should be adopted when necessary. He noted 
that the emergency law is the only alternative available in the 
exceptional circumstances we are facing. 
  Al-Alfi affirmed in his address to the People's Assembly 
that 
the powers granted by the emergency law still represent 
significant support in confronting the growing drug trafficking 
activity and illegal trade in weapons and explosives, and in 
criminal activities. 
  He noted that 428 people who were on record as drug 
traffickers have been arrested in the last three years and that 
3,183 others were arrested in the same period in cases involving 
robberies, hooliganism, morals, public property, and vendetta 
rivalries. He said that tightening the grip on criminal 
activities is not separate from stepping up measures to face 
terrorists acts. 
  He stressed that the extension of the emergency law for 
three 
more years is necessary and said that submitting this request to 
the People's Assembly is a necessity required by duty not to 
give up our efforts in the face of a momentous challenge. 
  People's Assembly Speaker Dr. Fathi Surur referred the 
statements of the prime minister and the minister of interior to 
the assembly's General Committee for discussion. 
  President Muhammad Husni Mubarak had referred the 
presidential decree No. 116 of 1994 on extending the emergency 
law to the People's Assembly. The decree stipulates that the 
emergency law be extended from 1 June (?1994) till 31 May 1997. 
  Dr. Surur passed the decree on to the assembly's General 
Committee, which is to discuss it and compile a report to be 
forwarded to the assembly in its next session. 
  Dr. Surur decided to hold an urgent meeting of the General 
Committee at the end of today's session to discuss the 
presidential decree.

<F P=106> [Report by Mahmud Bakri] </F>
  [Text] Available information has confirmed that the United 
States and Israel are currently planning to set up the most 
sophisticated military base in the Middle East region. A joint 
military committee has been formed to set up the base 23 
kilometers east of the occupied city of Jerusalem. 
  According to information, a senior Zionist official recently 
presented U.S. military officials with two separate maps for 
that purpose. The new base will serve the joint 
American-Israeli interests in the region. It will be equipped 
with the most sophisticated U.S. long-range and medium-range 
missile systems, in addition to multisystem rocket launchers. 
The base will be automatically connected to Sixth Fleet 
operations in the Mediterranean and will act as one of its 
tributaries. American and Israeli military experts will 
supervise the base. 
  Information indicates that the new military base will help 
the Israeli plan of planting nuclear warheads in the holy places.

  [Text] Cairo, 12 Apr (MENA)--In its commentary today, the 
newspaper AL-AKHBAR says the raid waged by two NATO planes 
against Serbian forces positioned around Gorazde will not deter 
Serbian commanders from pressing ahead with their criminal 
attacks on various towns and villages in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The newspaper asks if a mission by two NATO planes conducted 
once every few months is sufficient to end two years of bestial 
aggression against the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The paper recalls the "limited" air strike that NATO planes 
directed against Serbian forces besieging Sarajevo a few months 
ago to force them to pull back their heavy weapons from 
Sarajevo's immediate vicinity. Despite that strike, the paper 
writes, Serbian forces continued to return the weapons that they 
pulled back earlier so as to use them to kill as many of 
Sarajevo's inhabitants as possible. 
  The world must be puzzled by the inability of the United 
Nations and the UN Security Council to discipline a state as 
small as Serbia, the paper says. AL-AKHBAR asks: What if the 
aggressor were a stronger nation and one with more clout than 
Serbia? 
  The paper points out that the Bosnian tragedy, coming after 
the Cold War, was a test of the so-called new world order. The 
results have been disappointing, AL-AKHBAR concludes.

  [Text] Cairo, 11 Apr (MENA)--The Journalists Association 
Council has held an emergency session chaired by the 
Association's deputy chairman Jalal 'Isa. At the request of 
seven members of the council, the Association discussed the 
repeated arrests of journalists and their interrogation by the 
state security prosecution and military prosecution branches in 
cases related to publication and opinion. 
  The Association said that these arrests run counter to the 
criminal procedures law, the Journalists Association Law, and 
all other laws that safeguard the security of the journalist. 
The arrests threaten all the immunities enjoyed by journalists, 
the Association added. 
  The Council's statement notes that some of these procedures 
are arbitrary and that journalists are being mistreated by the 
interrogation body, which is entrusted with defending 
journalists and obeying the law. The interrogation body has 
failed to notify the Journalists Association to attend the 
interrogation sessions dealing with publication crimes. This is 
a basic and important issue guaranteed by the law, the Council 
added. 
  The Council said the Association refuses to permit 
journalists to be treated like criminals or ex-convicts [words 
indistinct]. 
  The Council called on all the state's [words indistinct] to 
respect the immunities guaranteed the press and journalists by 
the laws and constitution. The Council reiterates the 
Association's great desire to maintain healthy and frank 
relations with all state bodies. The Association also stressed 
that it will not cede any of its rights to defend journalists 
with all legitimate methods against any infringement or attack. 
  The Council said that the current circumstances through 
which 
the country is passing make it incumbent upon us all to combine 
our efforts and unify our ranks against the forces of 
treacherous terrorism. Those entrusted with respecting the law 
and legitimacy must not violate them, the Council said.

  [Text] Cairo, 11 Apr (MENA)--Dr. Nabil Sha'th, President 
'Arafat's political adviser and head of the Palestinian side at 
the Palestinian-Israeli talks currently held in Cairo, said 
discussion of the release of the Palestinian detainees held in 
Israeli jails will be completed today. He added that the two 
sides are close to reaching agreement on a timetable for their 
release. 
  According to the International Red Cross, the number of the 
Palestinian detainees is 10,400. 
  Sha'th dismissed reports that the PLO excluded Hamas members 
from its request for the release of the detainees. He said a 
timetable will be devised for freeing all the detainees one way 
or another because the Palestinian negotiators represent the 
entire Palestinian people. 
  Sha'th spoke about the obstacles impeding progress of the 
negotiations with Israel, those being fixing a date for 
withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho and signing an agreement in 
this respect. 
  He emphasized that the timetable of withdrawal is a very 
complex issue, particularly the starting date, which will 
coincide with the signing of the accord. He said: We have not 
yet reached agreement on such a date although we are approaching 
13 April. He added that it is difficult to predict a date for 
signing an agreement this week. 
  In his remarks, Dr. Sha'th said that the Israeli side 
yesterday submitted a proposal concerning the timetable for the 
Israeli forces' withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho. Dr. Sha'th 
noted that the present proposal is better than the unacceptable 
earlier proposal they made. However, we must discuss this issue 
more seriously today, he added. 
  Dr. Sha'th urged the United States, in its capacity as a 
cosponsor of the peace conference, to do all it can to ensure 
that the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles is 
implemented. 
  The Palestinian official affirmed that no specific problems 
currently face the Palestinian-Israeli Legal Affairs Committee. 
But there are still certain issues to be discussed. Dr. Sha'th 
maintained that the principal problem of the negotiations is the 
time factor, because any delay in the signing of the agreement 
would create further clashes and incidents that could be harmful 
to the peace process. We want to spare our nations bloodshed as 
a result of any delay in signing the agreement pertaining to the 
implementation of the Declaration of Principles, Dr. Sha'th 
added. 
  Meanwhile, Brigadier General 'Abd-al-Razzaq al-Yahya, head 
of 
the Palestinian side at the Security Committee, has stated that 
the current negotiations are dealing with a number of basic 
topics that are necessary to reach an agreement during this 
round of negotiations. He stressed that no agreement has so far 
been reached in drawing up a timetable for the release of the 
Palestinian detainees. 
  In his statement, al-Yahya said: I cannot specify a date for 
the entry of the police corps vanguards into Gaza and Jericho. 
He pointed out, however, that serious efforts are currently 
being made to ovebcome the differences affecting the two sides' 
views. The Palestinian official expects that Israel will soon 
lift the security blockade imposed on the occupied territories. 
  Knowledgeable Palestinian sources have told MENA that the 
ongoing Palestinian-Israeli negotiations in Cairo are facing 
basic and serious obstacles and that the negotiations are moving 
in a vicious circle in view of the Israeli side's adherence to 
its previous stances. 
  The same sources pointed out that the meetings of the 
committees stemming from the Gaza-Jericho Committee have not 
made any tangible progress. They said that under the 
circumstances, the meetings would be a waste of time unless the 
Israelis change their intransigent attitude. 
  The Palestinian sources added that the Israeli side has so 
far refused to specify a timetable for the withdrawal from Gaza 
and Jericho. The Israeli side also has not submitted an 
acceptable proposal for the entry of the Palestinian police 
force into Gaza and Jericho. This is in addition to the 
continuing differences over the of type of arms to be carried by 
the Palestinian police force, the sources said. 
  The sources maintained that Israel is trying to waste time 
and is betting on this factor to create divisions within the 
Palestinian ranks. Israel is also seeking to achieve gains in 
the negotiations, but this attempt is doomed to failure, the 
Palestinian sources said. 
  The Palestinian sources affirmed that there is now a dire 
need to hold a high-level meeting between the Palestinian and 
Israeli sides to resolve the outstanding issues. If this is not 
possible, then those concerned with the peace process, 
particularly the United States and Egypt, should intercede to 
resolve the problems, the sources concluded.

  [Text] Cairo, 12 Apr (MENA)--The Palestinian-Israeli 
negotiations relating to the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho 
agreement resumed in Cairo this morning. The Palestinian side 
was headed by Dr. Nabil Sha'th, political adviser to Palestinian 
President Yasir 'Arafat, and the Israeli side by General Amnon 
Shahaq, Israeli deputy chief of staff. 
  In a statement today ahead of the talks, Dr. Sha'th said 
that 
any agreement that might be reached during today's meetings will 
be announced after the talks. Three committees--the Security 
Committee, the Civilian Affairs Committee, and the Legal Affairs 
Committee--will stem from the Gaza-Jericho meetings.

  [Text] Israel and the PLO have reached an understanding on 
the agricultural section of the economic talks being held in 
Paris. Our correspondent Ya'aqov Balsenboim reports that the 
understanding provides for open borders between Israel and the 
autonomy subject to tight control by Israeli security, customs, 
and veterinary officials. The Palestinians will be allowed to 
export poultry, eggs, and produce to Israel. 
  Industry and Trade Minister Mikha Harish conferred last 
night 
with Abu-al-'Ala' [Ahmad Quray'], the PLO representative to the 
Paris talks, and explained to him the circumstances which led to 
the closure imposed on the territories in the wake of the murder 
in 'Afula and other terror attacks.

  [Text] Cairo, 11 Apr (MENA)--'Adnan 'Imran, Arab League 
assistant secretary general, has called for assigning a 
permanent UN Security Council seat to the Arab group. He said 
that apart from its significant geopolitical location, the Arab 
world possesses sufficient human, technical, financial, and 
cultural resources to justify such a demand. 
  'Imran told MENA that a permanent Arab seat at the Security 
Council is necessary to defend Arab rights, particularly after 
the erosion of the Security Council's credibility as a result of 
its double-standard policies on more than one occasion. 
  Citing the recent Security Council resolution extending 
sanctions against Libya, 'Imran voiced regret at the method in 
which the Council has been handling the Libyan-Western dispute. 
  He added that the Security Council has double standards and 
allows itself the right to punish whom it wants but it does 
nothing about Israel's defiance of it and its resolutions. 
  'Imran said that maintaining the anti-Libyan sanctions 
clearly contradicts the provisions of the UN Charter which 
assert that a country has sovereignty over its territories and 
citizens. 
  He pointed out that the Arab League will continue trying to 
explain the Libyan position. He stressed adherence to the 
recent Arab League resolution that called for putting the two 
Libyan suspects on trial before a Scottish tribunal meeting at 
the International Court of Justice in The Hague.

    [Editorial Report] The following review of the 5 April 
issue of Cairo AL-SHA'B summarizes articles that are Islamic in 
nature. 
<H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>
  1. Chief Editor Lashes Out at Security Guards' Conduct 
  2. Labor Party Leader, Journalists' Trial Begins 
  3. Cleric Assails Artists' Antiterrorism Role 
  4. Ruler's Glorification Criticized 
  5. Cleric on "The End of Israel" 
  6. Writer Affirms Muslim Brothers Will Survive 
<H5>  CHIEF EDITOR LASHES OUT AT SECURITY GUARDS' CONDUCT </H5>
  In a 1,200-word editorial entitled "The Sultan's Guards" on 
pages 1 and 2, Chief Editor Majdi Ahmad Husayn lashes out at the 
chief of the State Security Detectives Department, guards from 
which prevent cars from using the roads surrounding his home, 
arrest children for using fireworks, harass the inhabitants, and 
grant themselves the right to take goods from any shop without 
paying for them. He adds that three of these guards entered a 
refreshment shop for a "free" soft drink a few days ago. When 
the salesman asked them to pay, he was not only insulted, but 
one fired a bullet at his head and killed him instantly to 
punish him for his insolence, Husayn writes. 
  Husayn asks: If the chief of the State Security Detectives 
does not know how to select his guards--who should be the elite 
of the police--how can we be reassured about security in the 
country? 
  Claiming that the police are no longer bound by the law, 
Husayn says that this horrific incident should be punished on 
the political level and then on the legal level. He explains 
that police involvement in a battle against armed terrorism does 
not mean the police can turn into an armed division that acts 
without any controls. 
  Husayn maintains that the "arbitrary security approach" 
pursued against violent groups in Upper Egypt enhances public 
hostility toward the security forces. This provides fertile 
soil for more counter violence, he says. He criticizes 
officials for failing to realize that armed terrorism is a 
result of the crisis in the regime, which, failing to develop 
the democratic practice, tries to stifle that small amount of 
democracy achieved in the press and refuses to listen to the 
Islamic pulse of the nation. He notes that television shows the 
American soap opera The Bold and the Beautiful, yet someone like 
Shaykh al-Ghazali and cleric 'Abd-al-Sabur Shahim are banned 
from appearing on television screens. "This nation has returned 
to Islam. If the authorities do not let it express itself 
peacefully within the limits of the law and the Constitution, 
how can it expect stability to prevail?," he asks. 
  He maintains that the authorities rig elections to prevent 
Islamists from ruling because they know that "the ruling party 
will not survive semiclean elections." He stresses that the 
battle to secure clean elections must start now because 
"rectifying the electoral process is crucial for rescuing the 
nation from its crisis." 
<H5>  LABOR PARTY LEADER, JOURNALISTS' TRIAL BEGINS </H5>
  An 800-word report on page 1 by 'Amir 'Abd-al-Munim and 
Khalid Yunis says that the first hearing in the trial of the 
leaderships of the Labor Party and AL-SHA'B newspaper opened on 
Saturday "amid a crowd of Egyptian patriotic forces" and "strict 
security measures." The report gives an account of the hearing, 
at which the trial was postponed until 8 May. 
<H5>  CLERIC ASSAILS ARTISTS' ANTITERRORISM ROLE </H5>
  In his 500-word column "This Is Our Religion" on page 12, 
Shaykh Muhammad al-Ghazali finds it ridiculous that actors and 
actresses who have no knowledge of Islam should be recruited in 
a campaign to fight terrorism and teach Islam to the public. 

<H5>    RULER'S GLORIFICATION CRITICIZED </H5>
  A 500-word column by Muhammad 'Abd-al-Quddus called "The 
Natives" on page 12 criticizes the underdeveloped world that is 
ruled by "tyrant regimes" for shouting the slogan: "We sacrifice 
blood and soul for you, Mr. President." He says the slogan is 
welcome when the sacrifice is made for martyrs who fall as they 
sincerely fight the Israeli occupier but it is a "living example 
of backwardness" if it is shouted in a country full of 
"political scandals." 
  Citing examples of these "scandals," 'Abd-al-Quddus suggests 
that the ruler in a backward country achieves an overwhelming 
victory by rigging elections, restricting opposition, exercising 
absolute authority, and controlling the press, which always 
glorifies him. He concludes: "My country cannot take one step 
forward under such conditions." 
<H5>  CLERIC ON "THE END OF ISRAEL" </H5>
  In a 500-word article entitled "The End of Israel" on page 
11, al-Azhar cleric and Consultative Council member Ibrahim 
Ahmad al-Waqfi cites verses 4-5 of Sura 17 of the Koran, 
al-Isra', in which God judged that the sons of Israel would do 
mischief twice on earth and be defeated twice. The writer 
suggests the first time might have been when Babylonian 
Nebuchadnezzar's army fought the Jews, killed thousands of them, 
and drove them out of Palestine or when the Muslims conquered 
Jerusalem during the time of Caliph 'Umar Ibn-al-Khattab. 
  He contends that we are now going through the second 
episode. 
"The Jews set up a state in Palestine and expelled its people 
with the help of the enemies of Islam," he says, adding that 
their major ally, America, supplied them with weapons and funds 
and made them stronger than the collective Arab nation, just 
like the sixth verse of the Sura promised. 
  Citing the same Koranic Sura, verse 7, the writer contends: 
The second time, the Jews would be fought and defeated by 
people who undo all the mischief that the Jews did in the holy 
lands and enter the mosque just as they did the first time. 
  He concludes by citing Prophet Muhammad's assertion to 
Muslims that they would fight Jews and triumph over them and 
that a rock would tell a Muslim if a Jew hid behind it and the 
Muslim would say: Kill him. 
<H5>  WRITER AFFIRMS MUSLIM BROTHERS WILL SURVIVE </H5>
  Ahmad al-Malat's 2,500-word article "What are you planning? 
You are playing with fire" on page 5 discusses the "oppression 
the current regime in Egypt plots by night against the Islamic 
current." 
  He writes: The poor Egyptian people have been afflicted for 
40 years with the military coup that "begot rulers who imposed 
themselves on the people." 
  He criticizes those who repeat that there is nothing called 
the Muslim Brothers and who deny the Muslim Brotherhood the 
right to take part in national dialogue. 
  Referring to a statement published in the 24 March edition 
of 
AL-WAFD, al-Malat criticizes former Interior Minister Hasan 
Abu-Basha for warning against the Muslim Brothers' pursuit of 
power under the pretext of upholding religious principles and 
for accusing them of holding an unholy alliance with terrorism. 
  Giving an account of what he calls the oppressive measures 
the authorities adopt against Muslim Brothers countrywide, he 
advises the authorities not to exhaust themselves by chasing the 
Muslim Brothers, because "they are the rock on which the heads 
of those before you were crushed." 
  He assails those who claim to adopt Islam in spite of the 
hatred he sees them harboring for it. He also suggests that 
there is restriction of al-Azhar's role and that preaching has 
been made exclusive to their "hired hands." 
  He notes the triumph of the Islamic Welfare Party in 
municipal elections in Turkey and accuses the media of playing 
down that triumph. He also praises the Islamic current in 
Algeria and Sudan and wishes Sudan's al-Bashir success in 
pursuing the Islamic course. He notes the "good steps toward 
enforcing God's law in Yemen" and wishes the Yemenis success. 
  He concludes: Attempts to "cut the wings of the Islamic call 
will not succeed, because our feathers grow rapidly."

  [Text] The radio of the Israeli enemy army has reported 
that rebel John Garang paid a secret visit to Israel and met the 
prime minister of the Israeli enemy, Yitzhaq Rabin, and 
discussed with him the possibility of providing assistance to 
the forces of the rebel movement. The Israeli radio said rebel 
Garang had also met Mordechai Gur, the Israeli enemy's minister 
of war [name and title as heard], and heads of security organs 
in Israel. 
  AL-SHARQ of Qatar quotes its correspondent in the occupied 
territories that rebel John Garang ended his four-day secret 
visit to Israel yesterday. There are indications that rebel 
John Garang has in the past made several secret visits to Tel 
Aviv with the aim of getting assistance for his forces.

  [Text] Cairo, April 11 (AFP) -- Delegates of Sudan's 
southern rebel movement fighting the Khartoum government held 
their first conference since the group's creation in 1983, rebel 
sources said here Monday. 
  More than 500 delegates of the Sudan People's Liberation 
Army 
(SPLA) and its political wing, the Sudan People's Liberation 
Movement (SPLM), participated in the convention, which was held 
in southern Sudan and ended Friday, the sources said. 
  SPLA leader Colonel John Garang attended. 
  The conference was called in a bid to reinforce Garang's 
authority in the face of an internal power struggle with 
SPLA-United, a breakaway faction formed in 1991 and led by one 
of his former aides, Riek Machar. 
  The sources said the conference's resolutions would be 
published in the next few days. 
  They added that one of the meeting's objectives was to 
modify 
the SPLA charter, which stipulates that the rebels are fighting 
for a share of power within a united Sudan. 
  The movement has in recent years shifted towards a 
separatist 
stance favouring a division of Sudan into two independent states 
-- a Moslem north and a Christian south. 
  The SPLA and the Sudanese Government held brief and 
inconclusive talks last month in Nairobi within the framework of 
wider peace negotiations brokered by the regional 
Inter-Governmental Authority and Drought and Development, which 
comprises representatives from Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, and 
Uganda. 
  The negotiations are scheduled to resume mid-May.

  [Text] Negotiations involving Sudan's warring factions 
today hit a snag when one of the groups refused to be signatory 
to a treaty they were scheduled to endorse. 
  The treaty involves passing a decree to a free passage of 
relief food supplies and humanitarian assistance to the war 
affected areas in southern Sudan. Reliable sources at the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs where negotiations are still going 
on, told KTN that two groups, the SPLA [Sudan People's 
Liberation Army] mainstream and Sudanese Government had agreed 
to sign the document but the other faction, SPLM [Sudan People's 
Liberation Movement] declined to be part of it. 
  SPLM alleged that there had been alterations in the treaty, 
thereby demanding that unless the alterations were removed they 
would not be signatories. The negotiations, which were chaired 
by the minister of research, science and applied technology, 
Zachary Onyonka, were also attended by United Nations Operation 
Lifeline Sudan representative and IGADD [Intergovernmental 
Authority on Drought and Development] representatives. By the 
time we went on air negotiations were still going on.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Palestinian president Yasir </F>
'Arafat by Sawsan Abu-Husayn in Cairo "yesterday"] 
  [Text] [Abu-Husayn] Dr. Usamah al-Baz, director of the 
Egyptian president's office for political affairs, said that you 
and Rabin will sign an agreement before 13 October [as 
published]. Does that mean that there are U.S. assurances that 
such a step will be completed on this date? 
  ['Arafat] Dr. al-Baz made that statement before the recent 
hectic and unbalanced maneuvers. While the economic talks 
between us and them were continuing in Paris, they decided to 
suspend the talks in Cairo on the pretext of celebrations in 
Israel. This raises the question that there are two governments 
in Israel: one sanctioning negotiation and another suspending 
it. It is one of the continued Israeli maneuvers designed to 
obstruct the main aspect of the negotiations, that is the 
withdrawal. It has become known that Israel is procrastinating 
to obstruct the peace agreement. Regrettably, there are -- for 
the first time in Israeli history -- tendencies inside the 
Israeli Army controlling the Israeli Government's policy. Rabin 
is a prisoner of these tendencies inside the Army. 
  [Abu-Husayn] But a month ago Israel was urging a speedy 
resumption of the negotiations to implement the agreement, so 
what is the secret behind this contradiction? 
  ['Arafat] There are secret organizations inside the Israeli 
Army, like the French organizations that confronted the brothers 
in Algeria after they had signed the first and second Evian 
agreements. It is the same thing. There are secret 
organizations inside the Israeli Army seeking to obstruct the 
implementation of the agreement. 
  [Abu-Husayn] Obstructing the implementation of the agreement 
would lead to further violence and counterviolence. In your 
view, what is the solution? 
  ['Arafat] That is true. I hold Rabin responsible, 
especially as any obstruction of the agreement's implementation 
will have serious adverse effects on the overall situation 
inside our occupied land, because there is a serious Israeli 
escalation against the Palestinians, especially from Army units, 
extremist elements, armed settlers, and secret organizations. 
There are four secret organizations in the Army: "Sha'ol's 
Sword," "David's Sling," "Revenge," and "Custodians of the 
Temple." 
  This is known to the cosponsors of the peace process, the 
United States and Russia, who have been informed of details of 
the actions carried out by the secret organizations operating 
inside the Israeli Army. 
  [Abu-Husayn] Hamas and Islamic Jihad today urged 
preparedness for war. What is your opinion? 
  ['Arafat] That is part of escalating the incident and a 
reaction to the escalation of Israeli violence. 
  [Abu-Husayn] After the PLO's regret for the Israelis' 
murder, the United States is demanding that you take a stronger 
position. What is your position? 
  ['Arafat] We should not forget that victims of the bus 
incident include some Palestinians, as it was a public bus used 
by the Palestinians of 1948. 
  [Abu-Husayn] Do you invite Rabin to come to Cairo tomorrow 
to sign the agreement? 
  ['Arafat] I agreed with the brothers in Egypt to return to 
Cairo on 12 April so that after this date the implementation of 
the withdrawal operations would begin and Israeli Army troops 
would be replaced by Palestinian security forces in both the 
Gaza and Jericho strips. So I am not going to invite Rabin. It 
is the cosponsors' responsibility to maintain the thrust of the 
peace process and force the Israelis to implement what was 
agreed. It is also the international community's responsibility. 
  [Abu-Husayn] So do you expect the signing to take place 
this month, at the end of it, as Israeli Foreign Minister 
Shim'on Peres said? 
  ['Arafat] I am not in a position to offer expectations. But 
let Rabin and the Israeli Government understand that obstruction 
is harming not only the Palestinians, but the Israelis as well. 
  [Abu-Husayn] Why do you not invite Rabin to sign? 
  ['Arafat] I am not inviting Rabin to sign, because yesterday 
he refused to sign on 12 April -- which is a defiance of the 
Israeli proposal. The U.S. Administration should contact Rabin, 
especially as it proposed this date! 
  [Abu-Husayn] In view of the repeated talk about the U.S. 
secretary of state's participation in the agreement signing, 
does that mean that a breakthrough concerning the date will 
emerge within days? 
  ['Arafat] I do not think so. 
  [Abu-Husayn] When will you go to Jericho? 
  ['Arafat] That matter is delayed for a while, because I am 
dealing with the events, and Israel is maneuvering for the sake 
of obstructing the agreement. This should be known to the 
Palestinians, Arabs, and the whole world. Rabin is under 
pressure from a force in Israel exercising obstruction. Rabin 
is controlled by this situation, and he has to prove otherwise! 
  [Abu-Husayn] How do you view the importance of the Arab 
position's support for the implementation of the agreement? 
  ['Arafat] The importance of peace in confronting the 
warmongers for the sake of posperity has been proved today. 
There have been incidents which stress the importance of 
bolstering peace and assuming this responsibility fully. The 
current situation is much more serious than it appears on the 
surface, and I always warn of it. 
  [Abu-Husayn] What would you tell those opposed to the 
Gaza-Jericho agreement, especially in view of the hitch in the 
negotiations? 
  ['Arafat] The severity of the opposition gives you the 
answer...tell me who your enemies are, and I will tell you who 
you are! ('Arafat did not elaborate) 
  [Abu-Husayn] What are the results of your visit to Cairo? 
  ['Arafat] President Mubarak and Egyptian officials have made 
huge efforts, but regrettably, Israel is not listening to any 
appeals and has abandoned all the promises it made. While the 
Cairo negotiations have been suspended, the economic 
negotiations are continuing in Paris. 
  [Abu-Husayn] When will the negotiations resume? 
  ['Arafat] There is talk that they should be resumed Sunday 
(tomorrow) [10 April]. We see Israeli attempts to avoid 
implementing the agreement and get around it with a view to 
abolishing or obstructing it.

<F P=106> [Interview with PLO Executive Committee Chairman Yasir </F>
'Arafat by Arielle Thedrel in Tunis; date not given: "'Arafat: 
`Israelis are Destroying Peace Process'"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Thedrel] According to the 
Washington agreements, the Israeli Army should be out of Gaza 
and Jericho by 13 April. Is it still possible to keep to this 
schedule? 
  ['Arafat] We, the Palestinians, are ready. As always, the 
obstacles are coming from the Israeli side. Let me give you an 
example. On 31 March we signed an agreement according to the 
terms of which Israel undertook to accelerate negotiations on 
the autonomy of Gaza and Jericho. Article 6 of this agreement 
stated that the Palestinian police force was to be deployed one 
week later. A few days ago we were about to send in the first 
wave of this force when the Israelis objected on a number of 
pretexts. They also suspended the Cairo negotiations to attend 
the Holocaust commemoration ceremonies. Why then, did they not 
also suspend the economic committee negotiations under way in 
Paris? 
  I regret to say that the Israelis are maneuvering to avoid 
having to precisely and honestly apply what we decided on. In 
this same agreement signed last week, Israel accepted to 
accelerate the process of withdrawing its troops. However, last 
Thursday, Israeli Foreign Minister Mr. Peres announced that the 
negotiations -- not the withdrawal -- could be completed by the 
end of the month. Clearly, this is maneuvering. 
  [Thedrel] Would you go as far as to break off negotiations 
if 
the deadlines are not met? 
  ['Arafat] That will up to the PLO bureau to decide. Remember 
Israeli Prime Minister Mr. Rabin's slogan: "No fixed deadlines." 
In December, at our meeting in Cairo, Rabin promised me the 
Israeli withdrawal would begin in 10 days. Several months have 
gone by and we are still at the same point. Mr. Rabin did not 
keep his promise, but nonetheless I agreed to continue with the 
negotiations in Oslo, Davos, Cairo, etc. Each time, we reached 
agreements which were then not respected. Now we have reached 
an impasse situation. The deadline of 13 April is almost upon 
us and I can still not see any concrete results on the ground. 
When 13 April has passed, we will have to take a very close 
look at the situation and face up to our responsibilities. We 
will have to tell our people the truth. The Israelis are 
currently destroying the peace process and its credibility. 
These delays and hesitations are playing into the hands of the 
extremists. 
  [Thedrel] But by issuing an ultimatum to the Israelis, are 
you not also playing into the hands of the extremists? The 
Hamas Islamic fundamentalists have enjoined you to call off the 
peace negotiations for the past year. 
  ['Arafat] I do not take orders from Hamas. I was elected by 
the Palestinian National Council, not Hamas. It is my duty to 
ask the international community and the Security Council to 
shoulder their responsibilities and not to leave me standing 
alone against the Israeli government's maneuvering . 
  [Thedrel] How do you plan to defeat Palestinian extremism? 
  ['Arafat] I will be able to reply to that question when I am 
in Jericho. For the time being, that is Israel's responsibility. 
  [Thedrel] Why did you not personally condemn the Afula 
attack 
last week? 
  ['Arafat] The PLO condemned it. What distinction do you make 
between me and PLO? I am the one who gives the orders. Do not 
forget, either, that Palestinians were killed at Afula also. 
  [Thedrel] Can the current obstacles be overcome rapidly? 
  ['Arafat] Yes, if there is the will to do so. If this 
region, which is very important strategically, does not find 
peace , it will be thrown into confusion. However, if we do 
manage to find peace, it will signal the start of a whole new 
era.

  [Text] Brother leader Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] has held a 
telephone contact with U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher during which he called on the United States to 
effecitvely intervene to render the Palestinian-Israeli 
negotiations a success. He explained that we are at the 
threshold of being committed to the implementation of total 
Israeli withdrawal from the Jericho area and the Gaza Strip on 
13 April. 
  The Palestinian News Agency, WAFA, mentioned that brother 
leader Abu-'Ammar has also called for expediting the 
implementation of international resolution No. 904 on the 
protection of our Palestinian people. WAFA said brother leader 
Abu-'Ammar said he believes any delay in the implementation of 
the pledges and the timetable will negatively affect the entire 
peace process, harm it, and cause it to lose its credibility. 
  WAFA also pointed out that during the telephone contact, the 
two sides discussed the deteriorating situation in the occupied 
Palestinian territories and the developments that have been 
taking place since the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in Hebron and 
how these developments have harmed the entire peace process and 
the negotiations.

<F P=106> [Statement by Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh, member of PLO Executive </F>
Committee -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] Rabin's government bears the responsibility for 
destroying the foundations on which the peace process had 
embarked, particularly that the head of the Israeli Government 
was the first one to declare that the dates of the agreement 
were not sacred. 
  Since the Oslo agreement, Israel has been submitting 
proposals which contradicted the core and the articles of the 
agreements in all areas of security, administration and economy; 
a matter that might result in an organized form of occupation 
instead of ending it. 
  The Israeli side to the negotiations proposes limited and 
restricted prerogatives for the Palestinian police force. It 
also proposes a map of the withdrawal from Gaza Strip that will 
in fact lead to the enlargement of the settlements, as this map 
stretches to 13 kms along the Palestinian coast and other area 
in parallel to the Green Line. This is done to weaken and 
marginalize the role of the Palestinian authority; and to 
maintain the control of the occupation in a camouflaged way. 
  These Israeli stances and proposals are responsible for a 
lack of a real progress in the negotiations, and for reaching 
the date of 13 April without achieving any results; contrary to 
the claims of the government of Rabin that is trying to blame 
this delay on the PLO. 
  The Palestinian position, expressed following the Hebron 
massacre and the suspension of negotiations, is not the reason 
behind the lack of progress. On the contrary, the facts confirm 
that Israel's measures, taken in the aftermath of the massacre 
by imposing wide-ranging sanctions against the Palestinian 
people represented in the imposition of a curfew, an economic 
embargo, acts of killings committed by forces of occupation in 
Hebron and Gaza, and especially the assassination of six cadres 
from the PLO's militants are responsible for such a delay of 
progress. 
  All this represents the real reason behind a delay in the 
negotiations; and behind stripping them from any seriousness and 
credibility. The Israeli proposals, currently submitted on the 
negotiating table in Cairo, continue to revolve around the same 
framework, i.e., they aim to strip the agreement of the 
transitional phase from its content; and a replace the 
withdrawal with new forms of occupation and hegemony. 
  The government of Israel bears responsibility for the 
quasi-impasse that the peace negotiations have reached. There 
are no indications that point to the serious desire of the 
Israeli Government to reach a fundamental progress during the 
coming weeks. The PLO will deal with this situation from the 
point of view of our experience in the negotiations of the past 
months and the negative results that we have reached, to protect 
the interests and rights to our people; and to establish the 
peace process on serious and effective foundations.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh, head of the PLO </F>
Information Department, by Mufidah al-Hashani in Tunis; date not 
given -- recorded] 
  [Text] PLO Information Department Head Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh 
has said the negotiations with Israel are being obstructed. He 
critized the U.S. position toward the faltering Middle East 
peace process. Mufidah al-Hashani interviewed 'Abd-Rabbuh in 
Tunis: 
  ['Abd-Rabbuh] The situation has actually resulted from the 
Israeli position, which offers proposals that try to regulate 
the occupation more than end the occupation of the Palestinian 
territories. The Israelis propose some ideas that aim to slice 
off parts of Gaza, especially in the coastal area and along the 
green line between the Gaza Strip and Israel. They also propose 
other ideas, greatly restricting and narrowing the powers of the 
Palestinian authorities and police. 
  [Al-Hashani] What is the new Palestinian proposal? 
  ['Abd-Rabbuh] What is now required is that the peace process 
be salvaged on a new basis and through a new approach; that is 
by the immediate transition to negotiations on the final stage. 
  [Al-Hashani] What is the current U.S. stand on the 
negotiations? 
  ['Abd-Rabbuh] So far we have not sensed a serious U.S. stand 
to affect the course of negotiations. The U.S. side merely 
presents proposals of a procedural and administrative nature.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by official PLO spokesman -- read by </F>
announcer] 
  [Text] The city of Jerusalem, the capital of the 
Palestinian people, has been isolated and besieged for several 
days where roads leading to it have been closed, its national 
institutions have been prohibited from carrying out their 
activities and a siege of terror has been imposed around worship 
sites. These measures were taken to make changes on the ground 
and to force its people to flee after the Israeli authorities 
closed doors of meting out their means of living in their faces 
and preventing them from reaching their workplaces, using the 
Afula incident as an excuse while ignoring their incompetence in 
dealing with the Hebron massacre and its aftermath when settlers 
committed more killings against Palestinians in the West Bank 
and Gaza strip, an act in which the Israeli army participated. 
  This serious incident falls within a known framework of 
policy practiced by the Israeli government entailing mass 
punishment of the Palestinian people following the acts of 
violence -- which cannot be avoided or controlled as long as 
this government gives settlers a free reign to kill and carry 
out acts of violence and terrorism, and as long as it does not 
cooperate in eradicating explosive hotbeds through the peaceful 
process, starting with moving settlers from Hebron. Such a 
measure would calm sentiments and prove its rejection of the 
horrific massacre and killings by settlers and the army while 
hundreds of worshipers prayed in al-Ibrahimi mosque and which 
spilled over into the West Bank and Gaza strip. 
  The PLO sees in that Israeli policy, which escalated the 
collective punishment measures to the extent of resorting to 
importing tens of thousands of Asian laborers, as being a source 
of danger and threat to the whole peace process. Accordingly, 
the PLO, while rejecting the Israeli policy, is concerned to 
make the international community and Security Council states 
stand up to these dangerous Israeli practices. It urges the 
cosponsors -- the U.S. and Russia -- to intervene to relieve the 
suffering, oppression, and killing of the Palestinian people, 
and to save the peace process. 
  Events and incidents have proved that security precautions, 
however big and severe, will not succeed in stopping violence 
and crime. In the end, every party would be able to make bloody 
penetrations which would complicate matters. 
  Accordingly, the PLO sees that the latest Israeli measures 
are pushing matters into a path which run in the opposite 
direction to the peace process. The inflexible parties in the 
Israeli government have found their chance to destroy this 
process, a matter which will drag the region into conflicts, 
bloody and violent events, thwarting all dreams of security, 
stability and peace. 
  We call on the international community, particularly the 
American and Russian cosponsors, to intervene and put a stop to 
the total massacre of our Palestinian people in the occupied 
territories -- which affects the core of their daily lives 
ranging from the attack on their sanctities and institutions, to 
starve them, confiscating their means of living and preventing 
them from moving around. These measures are harming all 
Palestinian sectors, especially the health sector.

  [Text] Gaza City, Occupied Gaza Strip, April 11 (AFP) -- 
Another 10 Palestinians deported by Israel are set to return to 
the occupied territories next week, a PLO official told AFP on 
Monday [11 April]. 
  "Our delegation in Cairo told me Israel was going to allow 
10 
deportees to come back next week," said Rashid Abu-Shibak. 
  Israel, which has expelled about 1,700 Palestinians since 
1967, allowed 49 Palestinians to return to the territories last 
week. 
  Abu-Shibak was sent back to Gaza by the PLO last week to 
oversee the handover of official buildings as the Israelis 
pull-back. 
  Israeli military officials said they were unaware of any 
decision to allow another group of deportees to return.

  [Text] Gaza City, Occupied Gaza City, April 11 (AFP)--The 
Palestine Liberation Organization and the Islamic Resistance 
Movement Hamas have opened talks in the Gaza strip to try to 
halt conflict between themselves, a PLO official said. 
  "A meeting of senior PLO and Hamas leaders took place last 
week to sort out daily problems and the two groups decided to 
carry on the dialogue," the official told AFP. 
  "The discussions are serious and positive and we hope to 
reach an agreement. We respect the position of Hamas on 
autonomy in Gaza and Jericho," he added. 
  The fundamentalist organization has sworn to fight on 
against 
Israel despite the September 19 autonomy deal, which it 
considers a sell-out. 
  A Hamas official confirmed that a meeting had taken place 
after an armed clash between rival militants left 18 wounded in 
the Rafah refugee camp at the end of March. But he refused to 
say more until an accord was struck. 
  The fight erupted over a piece of wasteland on which PLO 
supporters played football and Hamas wanted to build a doctor's 
clinic. 
  Then on April 2, Fatah and Hamas each kidnapped one of the 
other's supporters in Gaza City. Both hostages were freed 
unharmed after lengthy negotiations. 
  A Palestinian research centre last month found that 40 
percent of the Gaza Strip would vote in elections for PLO 
chairman Yasir 'Arafat's Fatah movement and nearly 20 percent 
for Hamas.

<F P=106> [Report by Netan'el Semrik] </F>
  [Excerpt] Fatah and Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] 
have reached an agreement in Hebron. This is reportedly a 
gentlemen's agreement, without any written documentation to 
attest it. According to the understanding reached, Hamas will 
not act against Fatah or against the potential benefits of the 
peace process. Both sides prefer the wording here to be 
intentionally vague. This is how Husayn al-Shaykh, one of the 
prominent Fatah leaders in the West Bank and an adviser to the 
Palestinian peace delegation, defines the situation: 
  [Begin al-Shaykh recording] There is no war between us and 
Hamas; therefore, no agreement is required. I am sure that 
Hamas knows its limits and our red line very well and that in 
the future, it will share power with us. [end recording] 
  The understandings were reached recently, following a series 
of secret meetings between some seven to 10 people from both 
organizations. The gist of the Hebron agreement is that Hamas 
accepts Fatah as the leader in the political process, even if it 
does not agree with it. It should be emphasized that 
'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam, Hamas' military arm, does not recognize 
and is not bound by these understandings. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [By 'Ulayyan 'Ulayyan] </F>
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] NIDA' AL-WATAN has met with 
the most two prominent leaders of the democratic Palestinian 
current, comrade Dr. George Habash, secretary general of the 
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP], and 
comrade Nayif Hawatimah, secretary general of the Democratic 
Front for the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP]. They discussed 
the Hebron massacre and its dimensions in light of the 
[Israeli-PLO] Cairo agreement, analyzed the agreement, and 
defined the tasks needed to confront the challenges of the 
current phase. 
  While holding both the Zionist enemy leaders and the United 
States directly responsible for the Hebron massacre, comrade Dr. 
Habash did not exempt Oslo's Palestinian team from 
responsibility. He said: We do not exempt 'Arafat and the 
Palestinian Oslo-Cairo team from their clear responsibility for 
the terrorism, killings, and repression being committed against 
our people because they signed humiliating agreements in 
Washington and Cairo. In essence, these agreements entrench and 
protect both the occupation and the settlements and keep our 
masses and territories subject to attacks by the occupation and 
its settlers. 
  Dr. Habash linked the submissive agreements to the massacre, 
and drew specific conclusions. He said: The Hebron mosque 
massacre was the peak of the tragedy and a reply to the 
defeatists. It also confirmed that there would be no 
coexistence or security as long as both the occupation and its 
settlements exist on our territory. The only solution is to end 
the occupation, remove all settlements from our territory, and 
implement the resolutions of international legitimacy. These 
resolutions recognize our people's inalienable national rights; 
namely, the rights to repatriation, self-determination, and an 
independent state with holy Jerusalem as its capital. [passage 
omitted] 
  Comrade Nayif Hawatimah discussed the most prominent 
dimensions and implications of this massacre in light of the 
Oslo agreement and in view of the insistence by the collapsing 
bureaucratic leadership on continuing this humiliating course. 
He said: This hideous massacre and the subsequent killings and 
repression against our people have highlighted the vast distance 
between 'Arafat and his team on the one hand and our people's 
interests, rights, and daily concerns on the other. They have 
also highlighted the vast distance between the bitter and hard 
situation our people are experiencing under occupation and the 
so-called Cairo agreement signed by 'Arafat and his team with 
the Israeli side. The al-Ibrahimi Mosque's massacre and the 
subsequent repression are simply the bitter and poisonous fruit 
of both this agreement and the Oslo accord. A direct threat is 
posed to our people by the daily attacks carried out by the 
settlers and the occupation troops through a chain of bloody 
massacres. The al-Ibrahimi Mosque's massacre will not be the 
last link in this chain. [passage omitted] 
  Regarding the Cairo agreement and its dimensions and 
implications, Dr. Habash said: A scrutiny of the Cairo 
agreement and its details reveals the extent of the Oslo team's 
collapse. The largest implication of this agreement is that it 
exposed and foiled all the delusions and demagogy the collapsing 
leadership tried to instill in our people's minds. This team 
also suggested that the Oslo agreement addresses basic issues 
and contains prospects for proceeding toward a Palestinian state 
and laying the foundation stone for Palestinian national 
sovereignty. Consequently, 'Arafat and his team have made many 
statements stressing that this agreement is a phased one and 
that we will ultimately obtain self-determination, a Palestinian 
state, Jerusalem, the removal of settlements, the crossing 
points, security, Jericho, and other issues. 
  Dr. Habash added: The Cairo agreement's value lies in the 
fact that it verified the viewpoint rejecting the Oslo agreement 
and it told the advocates of the Madrid approach that the final 
phase would be determined in light of the final balance of 
powers. The crossing points and the Jericho issue cannot be 
relinquished. The recent agreement signed in Cairo was even 
uglier and more humiliating than the Oslo agreement. [passage 
omitted] 
  Comrade Nayif Hawatimah pointed out that the mosque massacre 
highlighted the Palestinian national consensus on the fact that 
the Cairo agreement signed by 'Arafat and Peres does not provide 
the minimum of security and protection for our people under 
occupation and that the Oslo-Cairo track has reached a deadlock. 
It is a national imperative to halt negotiations until the 
settlements are dismantled and the settlers are evacuated from 
the occupied Palestinian territories, including Arab Jerusalem, 
as well as to provide protection through UN troops, and to 
reformulate the overall negotiations process based on the 
resolutions of international legitimacy. These resolutions 
provide for Israeli withdrawal from all occupied Arab 
territories, including Jerusalem, and for the right to 
self-determination, independence, and repatriation. 
  Comrade Hawatimah urged 'Arafat's leadership to resign in 
order to allow our people to elect a reliable national 
leadership that would be a symbol of national consensus. He 
said: The past weeks have shown that the pro-'Arafat wing cares 
more for the Oslo-Cairo agreement and for holding negotiations 
according to the humiliating Madrid-Oslo terms than for our 
people's interests and national rights. [passage omitted]

  [Text] H.E. [His Excellency] Mr. Muhammad Salim Basindwah, 
minister for foreign affairs of the Republic of Yemen, visited 
[as received] India (April 10-13, 1994) at the invitation of 
Shri Dinesh Singh, minister for external affairs. This was the 
first ever visit by a cabinet minister to India from unified 
Yemen. 
  At their meeting today, the two ministers recalled age-old, 
friendly relations between Yemen and India and expressed their 
keen desire to further strengthen them in the coming years. 
They exchanged views of regional and international issues. 
  The visiting minister expressed the desire of the Government 
of Yemen for an intensive interaction in the economic area, 
especially to increase trade and technical cooperation. During 
the discussions it emerged that there is a great scope for 
strengthening mutually beneficial relations in the field of 
irrigation, telecommunications, health sector, agriculture, 
trade, training of Yemeni students in professional institutions 
in India in the areas of engineering, management, electronics 
etc. 
  The Yemeni foreign minister invited investments from India 
in 
the development projects being carried out there. Our external 
affairs minister welcomed the suggestion. It was agreed that 
India and Yemen would jointly explore the possibilities of 
establishing joint ventures in the field of oil exploration, 
extraction, refining, distribution and marketing, development of 
Aden free port, civil construction etc. 
  India extended its best wishes for the success of 
multi-party 
democracy introduced in April 1993 in the Republic of Yemen and 
hoped that the long-felt, cherished dream of the Yemeni people 
to see their unified country proceed further on the path to 
peace and development, would be realised soon. 
  Yemen expressed its concern at the menace of growing 
fundamentalism and terrorism in the world. Yemen supported 
India's concern on cross-border terrorism and the rejection of 
interference in the internal affairs of any country by external 
forces. Yemen supports India's stand on Kashmir issue and hoped 
that it would be resolved through dialogue between India and 
Pakistan and not by resorting to polemics and violence.

  [Text] The prime minister said acquisition of F-16 fighter 
aircraft by Pakistan will disturb the security environment and 
escalate tension in the region. Addressing the Air Force 
commanders conference in New Delhi today, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao 
expressed concern over Pakistan's relentless efforts to 
modernize its armed forces and air power far beyond its 
legitimate requirements. He said that while the cold war has 
ended at the super power level, the security scenario in 
different regions continues to be remain dogged by conflicts and 
disputes. Calling upon the Indian Air Force [IAF] to maintain 
constant vigil, the prime minister emphasized that the IAF has 
to maintain the highest level of operational preparedness. 
  Speaking on the occasion, the minister of state for defense, 
Mr. Mallikarjun, said that India never seeks confrontation and 
her quest for peace should not be misunderstood as weakness. 
Earlier, the chief of air staff, Air Chief Marshal S.K. Kaul, 
reviewed the air power prevailing in the region and its impact 
on the security environment.

  [Text] The U.S. deputy secretary of state, Mr. Strobe 
Talbott, has emphasized the need for strengthening the 
multidimensional relationship between Pakistan and his country. 
Addressing a news conference in Islamabad today, Mr. Strobe 
Talbott, gave detail of his talks with Pakistani leaders. 
  [Begin Talbott recording] Together United States and 
Pakistan finally have a chance to realize the huge human and 
economic potential of our partnership, and that was the essence 
of my message to the Pakistani Government today and it also 
served as the background for everything that we discussed. Now, 
let me say a word or two about the agenda. I suspect that quite 
a few of you are interested in the issue of F-16's and the 
American proposal to cap the Pakistani nuclear program. There 
was obviously a lot of discussion of those (?mostly) 
inter-related subjects in several of the conversations that I 
had today. But our talks was far more wide-ranging than just on 
that subject. In fact, the wide-range of our discussions is 
significant in itself. It is a testament to the number of 
issues on which our governments and our people are committed to 
work together. Ours is a multidimensional relationship and mine 
was a multidimensional agenda. [end recording] 
  The American deputy secretary of state called on the 
president. The president gave a resume of U.S.-Pakistan 
relations over the past few years and of Pakistan's perceptions 
of America and its aspirations. He said the governments of 
Pakistan and the United States have coincidence of interests in 
several areas. He hoped Mr. Talbott's visit will bring the two 
friendly countries nearer and narrow their differences. He 
especially welcomed the friendly vibrations from the United 
States. Mr. Talbott assured the president that the United 
States attach the same importance to Pakistan as it did in the 
pre-Cold War era. He hoped to discuss Pakistan-U.S. relations 
in depth and said he envisaged discussions across a fairly wide 
spectrum which would lead to greater between the two countries. 
Mr. Talbott said the United States noted with satisfaction the 
diligent way in which Pakistan had put its economic matters in 
order and hoped for greater cooperation between the two 
countries. 
  Mr. Strobe Talbott called on the prime minister, Ms. Benazir 
Bhutto, in Islamabad today. Matters relating to mutual 
interests were discussed during the meeting. The prime minister 
also hosted lunch for the visiting U.S. delegation. 
  Mr. Strobe Talbott also met the foreign minister, Sardar 
Asif 
Ahmad Ali, in Islamabad. They discussed bilateral matters, 
including Kashmir, and nuclear nonproliferation in South Asia. 
The foreign minister apprised Mr. Talbott of Pakistan's 
perception of the regional situation. Earlier, Mr. Talbott had 
a meeting with the senior officials of the Foreign office. The 
Kashmir issue, handing over of F-16 fighter planes to Pakistan, 
nuclear nonproliferation and other important matters were 
discussed in the meeting. The Pakistani side was by led by the 
secretary of foreign affairs, Mr. Najmuddin Sheikh, while Mr. 
Talbott was assisted by the assistant secretary of state, Miss 
Robin Raphel.

  [Text] The U.S. Deputy secretary of state, Mr. Strobe 
talbott, had a meeting in Islamabad with Prime Minister Ms. 
Benazir Bhutto during which they discussed matters of mutual 
interest to both the countries. Earlier, Mr. Talbott discussed 
bilateral matters, including Kashmir and nuclear 
nonproliferation, with Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali. 
He also held talks with officials in Islamabad during which 
they reviewed entire spectrum of bilateral relations. 
  Briefing newsmen about the talks, a Foreign Office spokesman 
said the two countries have agreed to the concept of 
multilateral talks on South Asian security and to hold 
consultations with each other in order to develop an appropriate 
framework. The spokesman said that the president and the prime 
minister reiterated Pakistan's desire for continued close and 
cooperative relations with the United States in the post-cold 
war period. 
  The spokesman said during the talks consideration was given 
to the two nonpapers presented by the United States to Pakistan. 
These dealt with the proposal for multilateral talks on South 
Asian security, proposing a verifiable capping of the production 
of fissile material by Pakistan in the context of removing the 
impediments in the supply of defense materials. Consistent with 
its well-known position, Pakistan expressed support for the 
objectives of promoting nonproliferation regionally and 
globally. The two sides agreed to proceed with further 
consideration of this initiative with a view to evolving an 
agreed and equitable approach. 
  Replying to a question, the spokesman said Pakistan made it 
clear that it would not accept any unequal and inequitable 
obligation as far as nonproliferation is concerned. Pakistan 
would not accept anything which places it at an disadvantageous 
position politically, militarily, and security-wise. It was 
ready to accept any nondiscriminatory and equitable proposal for 
this purpose vis-a-vis India, but not unilateral capping of its 
nuclear program and it remained our position even today. 
  To another question, the spokesman emphatically stated that 
Pakistan is opposed to the deployment of ballistic missiles in 
South Asia. 
  He said Mr. Talbott reiterated the desire of the United 
States to maintain the long-standing friendly and cooperative 
relationship with Pakistan. He informed the president and the 
prime minister that Pakistan was today as important as it was 
during the cold war era, both regionally and globally and it had 
a crucial role in the region. The spokesman in reply to another 
question said Pakistan's stand on Kashmir remains the same that 
the dispute should be resolved in accordance with the United 
Nations resolution that calls for plebiscite in Jammu and 
Kashmir. The United States, the spokesman said, has expressed 
its willingness to assist in the solution of the dispute if this 
was agreeable to both the parties. 
  Addressing a news conference in Islamabad this afternoon, 
the 
U.S. deputy secretary of state underscored strong commitment of 
his country of maintaining good friendly relations with 
Pakistan. He said the two sides also agreed on the elimination 
of nuclear weapons from the entire South Asian region, 
especially through talks in a multinational forum. He 
emphasized that the American proposal for nuclear 
nonproliferation in South Asia qualifies to be even-handed and 
has a regional and trans-regional approach. Mr. Talbott said 
President Clinton and Secretary of State Warren Christopher had 
asked him to convey this commitment to Pakistani leaders that 
the United States was determined to champion and broaden this 
relationship further. He said his talks with the president, the 
prime minister, and the foreign minister covered supply of 
F-16's aircraft, capping of nuclear program, and other regional 
and global issues. He said his dialogue with Pakistan will 
continue to advance the goals of nonproliferation and to end 
arms race in the region. Mr. Talbott said they are aware that 
Pakistan Government is not going to accept any initiative unless 
the government and the people are convinced that the American 
initiatives serve the security interests of Pakistan. He said 
the United States is not asking for a roll back of the nuclear 
program, but is suggesting a verifiable capping. About the 
supply of F-16 aircraft to Pakistan, he said further discussion 
on this will take place.

<F P=106> [Commentary by A.B.S. Jafri] </F>
  [Text] Pakistan and the United States have expressed their 
full support for global and regional efforts to prevent 
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the missiles 
capable of delivering them. In a joint statement issued in 
Islamabad today at the end of the visit of U.S. Deputy Secretary 
of State Mr. Strobe Talbott, the two countries supported the 
early convening of multilateral talks on arms control, 
nonproliferation, and security in South Asia. The joint 
statement says Pakistan supported the objectives underlying the 
proposal, especially regional and global nonproliferation. 
However, the two sides agreed to continue discussions so as to 
develop an approach acceptable for both sides. Meanwhile, the 
foreign secretary, Mr. Najmuddin Sheikh, said there was no 
question of an agreement on nuclear nonproliferation, but 
discussions will continue in order to arrive at a mutually 
agreed approach. He said Pakistan explained its stand and 
position on the nuclear issue and Mr. Talbott had [word 
indistinct] a much clearer understanding about Pakistan's 
position. 
  The most notable outcome of the talks between Mr. Talbott 
and 
Pakistani leaders in Islamabad during the last two days is that 
both sides appeared to be satisfied. What the U.S. official 
described as the cluster of issues discussed included the 
suspended sale of F-16 aircraft and a capping, reducing, and 
eventual elimination of weapons of mass destruction in South 
Asian subcontinent. The wide-ranging discussions were 
attributed by Mr. Talbott to what he called the multidimensional 
relationship between the United States and Pakistan. Mr. 
Talbott has emphasized that the United States wants the best of 
relations with Pakistan on the issue of nonproliferation of 
nuclear weapons in South Asia, which is a major concern of the 
United States. Mr. Tabott told to Pakistan side the United 
States fully realized that Pakistan was not going to accept any 
initiative unless it served the security interests of the 
country. The United States, he assured, respected this concern 
and its initiative will be aimed at promoting security. 
  Knowledgeable sources in the Pakistan capital are describing 
the talks as positive and productive. The Government of 
Pakistan agrees that further consideration of the U.S. 
initiative should be carried on through normal diplomatic 
channels. Mr. Talbott has (?taken some pains) to dispel the 
apprehension that the United States might apply pressure on 
Pakistan to obtain its acceptance of the Washington line on 
nuclear nonproliferation in South Asia. He clearly told newsmen 
here that there was no question of any pressurization of any 
kind. Official circles in Islamabad have noted that the United 
States remains interested in promoting a regional approach to 
the security concern of the South Asian nations. Pakistan, for 
its part, welcomes any move which is essentially fair, 
even-handed, and equitable. This principle would apply to all 
issues, including nuclear nonproliferation, sale of defense 
equipment, Kashmir, and other issues which call for settlement. 
A regional approach to contentious issues holds better promise 
of success. 
  It is now apparent that the United States understands 
Pakistan's stance better as a result of Mr. Talbott's talks with 
the leaders in Islamabad. The issues under discussion have not 
been finally settled or resolved. What these exchanges have 
contributed is a much clearer appreciation of each other's 
position. For instance, the United States now says it is not 
insisting on any rolling back of Pakistan's nuclear program. 
This clear statement is seen in Islamabad as acceptance of 
Pakistan's point of view. There is good reason to see this as 
progress in the right direction. Two days of talks on matters 
of profound complexity are not expected to produce instant 
results, and no instant results were either sought nor have 
concrete results been achieved. What he has said and (?will be) 
accomplished is clearing of the atmosphere of some doubt; some 
feeling that the United States was unable to sympathize with 
Pakistan's sensitivities. Mr. Talbott's exposition of the 
United States policies in South Asia has produced the positive 
conditions needed for progress in the right direction.

  [Text] Tehran, April 11, IRNA -- The Foreign Minstry here 
Monday condemned the savage Serbian attacks on the defenceless 
people of Gorazde as "the explicit breach of the United Nations 
Charter." 
  The ministry in a statement said the indiscriminate 
aggressions of the Serbs against the city, declared as a safe 
haven in the Security Council Resolutions 824 and 836, revealed 
the indifference of the international community towards 
"distortion of human dignity." 
  The statement called on all countries, particularly the 
Muslim nations, to adopt serious and rapid measures against the 
Serbian crimes. 
  Latest reports say that serbian occupiers, encouraged by the 
indifference of the international circles, have intensified the 
massacre and ethnic cleansing operatons in the city in voilation 
of all security council's resolutions. 
  Meanwhile, the Bosnian presidency announced Saturday that 
Serbs had used chemical gases to kill many people in Gorazde.

  [Text] During today's open session of the Islamic Majles 
the deputies approved a bill on establishing public and 
revolution courts. The justice minister [Mohammad Esma'il 
Shushtari] explained how this bill would affect the judicial 
branch. We draw your attention to his remarks: 
  [Begin Shushtari recording] Under our existing legal 
apparatus, penal and criminal cases are in fact investigated in 
two stages; that is, in the prosecutor's office or tribunals 
[dadsara] as the first stage, and in the law court [mahkameh] as 
the second stage. The process is lengthy and each case lasts a 
long time. Whereas the latest bill combines the two stages into 
one. In other words, the prosecutor's office and the law court 
will investigate each case simultaneously to close the file 
quicker. 
  The second point is that at present we have many courts of 
various categories investigating each case. Shortage of 
manpower or other necessary resources in the towns with judicial 
units has prevented the establishment of all such courts. As a 
result the people have faced difficulties and have had to travel 
to other judicial zones. Fortunately thanks to the latest bill, 
every branch of different courts is qualified to investigate all 
cases. 
  The third point here is in fact the abolition of the penal 
and revolution tribunals. This does not mean such tribunals 
will no longer exist; rather their existing system is to be 
abolished and they will work with the courts as investigative 
judges. From this date, the main judicial bodies are the public 
courts and the revolution courts. The tribunals and 
prosecutor's offices will be dissolved. They will be working as 
investigative judges with and under the supervision of the 
courts and court judges. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "A Fresh Start..."] </F>
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] "Time" is the only asset 
which, when correctly used, can regenerate other assets and can 
help mankind and society to grow and achieve material and 
spiritual well- being. But if man or society neglects to use 
this asset and does not give it the importance it deserves, not 
only will they waste "time" but all other assets too! 
  What most clearly characterizes the rapid and awesome 
developments of the past two centuries is the best and correct 
use of "time," so much so that in the last years of the 
twentieth century, fates are decided "in seconds" and it is by 
taking advantage of such seconds that rival countries try to 
defeat their enemies. Each second sees awesome progress in 
science and technology in the world today; and any country that 
is unable to adjust to this march of the seconds will fall 
behind in the process of historical evolution. Naturally if a 
country or a nation has been "backward" for the past two 
centuries, then it should accelerate its progress 100 fold in 
order to make up for lost time. [passage omitted] 
  Here it should be noted that some people regard the West and 
the speed of its developments with contempt and they condemn the 
Westerners for not being encumbered by ethics and consider them 
to be doomed. In this same context, they do not value as much 
as they should the "science and technology" that come from the 
West, even though in practice they enjoy the very fruits that 
this science and technology stemming from the West have yielded. 
And they even react negatively to science emanating from the 
West. As a result, they do not attach the necessary 
significance to society's scientific progress and they neglect 
the fundamental role that science plays in the material and 
moral progress of a society. Leaning on the fact that ideology 
and its moral and spiritual attractions are more correct, they 
try to justify the scientific and technical backwardness of a 
society and they consider the great extent to which our society 
depends on ethics as the reason for our society's superiority 
over the Western societies. But an equitable judgment is that 
if a society which leans on ethics and morals is unable to move 
side by side with the rest of the world and to use the science, 
technology, and experiences offered by this world, then it will 
not be long before all its moral and spiritual grounds too will 
be seriously harmed and it will surrender to the cultural 
onslaught of those who are more advanced in science and 
technology. 
  A righteous ideology is necessary in order to achieve 
happiness. But it is not sufficient. Mankind must strive to 
fulfill his ideology in all aspects by bearing in mind the 
present time and place. There is no doubt that science and 
technology are among the factors needed for success in today's 
world, and we can succeed only if we are good at these things. 
And this can be done only by multiplying our efforts to learn 
as much as we can. 
  Today we have a great responsibility, as time passes and the 
future approaches. The years that we are now living through are 
the most sensitive years in the history of our country. We 
should make up for lost opportunities and understand what time 
is worth. We should eschew striving for instant profits. We 
should forego mental idleness and the comforts of life. We 
should rise in gratitude for the blood that the best children of 
our country have shed so that Islam and our country can continue 
to exist, and show firm determination in our efforts for 
reconstruction. Let us not forget that in the first hours of 
the new year we went to pay homage to our martyrs and to vow to 
them that we will continue on their path. We should be faithful 
to this vow. Therefore, let us make "New Year's Day" a new day 
for the country and seize the opportunity for a "fresh start" in 
the history and life of our country. And as stated by the 
esteemed leader in his New Year message, let us make it our duty 
to become work-conscious and to display social discipline. So, 
let us advance toward the learning of science, work, 
production...[ellipsis as published] ethics and spirituality.

<F P=106> [Unattributed station commentary] </F>
  [Text] Today, 9th April, coincides with the anniversary of 
severance of Iran's ties with America. Severance of Iran-U.S. 
ties 15 years ago on this day is one of those events which took 
place after the lapse of just a few months following the victory 
of the Islamic revolution in Iran. 
  Hence the events which occurred in that juncture and also 
with the years following the severance of Tehran-Washington ties 
are indicative of an open opposition in the two countries 
relations. This opposition which clearly emerged following the 
victory of the Islamic revolution in Iran due to the 
anti-arrogant character of the Islamic Republic of Iran and 
termination of US intervention in Iran's internal affairs, in 
fact is viewed as the main reason for the severance of ties 
between Tehran and Washington. 
  At present too when these severance of ties have entered the 
16th year, it seems that the statesmen in Washington are still 
faced with doubt in accepting the reality of the Islamic 
revolution and improperly [word indistinct] the present status 
of Iran on the international and regional scenes. 
  A glance at the record of the statesmen in Washington 
vis-a-vis Iran, during more than a decade, specially in the 
recent years show that the U.S. statesmen have constantly tried 
to force their demands on Iran. 
  Hence it must be said that it is the mode of thinking of 
U.S. 
statesmen and also their unrealistic approach towards bilateral 
relations which has taken the Iran-U.S. ties out of a rational 
and principled course. 
  It is however indisputable that Washington's insistence on 
continuing this trend has entailed the removal of favourable 
grounds for establishment of ties between the two countries. 
  It is clear that as long as the US insists on continuing 
such 
a policy no positive change in the two countries' ties can be 
expected. 
  On the other hand the hostile performance of the U.S. 
leaders 
during the recent months also showed that the U.S. continues to 
pursue its desire for isolating the Islamic Republic of Iran on 
the international scene and that the US officials have made 
great efforts in this connection in order to prevent Iran from 
expanding its ties with the European governments including those 
of Germany, France as well as Japan. 
  The U.S. has put its European allies under pressure to 
achieve its goal. 
  But these efforts which were primarily aimed at putting 
economic pressure did not reach anywhere and as political 
analysts say the U.S. policy in this connection has failed. 
  At any rate according to political analysts the Islamic 
republic of Iran is considered as a powerful country which is 
playing a vital role in the trend of the regional developments. 
  This role is being assessed as significant by the U.S. 
leaders in so far as the central Asia and the security of the 
Persian Gulf are concerned. 
  And this is the reality which the U.S. leaders are forced to 
accept. 
  Any how during the past fifteen years the Islamic Iran has 
proved that it wants peaceful coexistence in the international 
community and will never compromise the principles of the 
revolution with any country including the U.S.

  [Text] Tehran, April 9, IRNA -- A Persian daily in an 
article on the anniversary of the severance of ties with the 
United States said that the U.S. performance so far has proven 
that it is still the 'great satan'. 
  'JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI' wrote that the severance of ties has 
been 
to the interest of the Iranian nation since it has served as a 
turning point for cutting off all dependencies. 
  The ever-increasing U.S. intereference in the Persian Gulf 
region, Washington's unconditional suppport for the Zionist 
regime and U.S. plots against the Islamic revolution all prove 
that the U.S. still is the 'great satan', it said. 
  Stressing that the U.S. claims over its new world order was 
another indication to its satanic nature, the editorial called 
for the reinforcement of revolutionary movements to help them 
stand against the U.S. aggressive and hegemonic policies. 
  The daily said that the roots of the Islamic revolution have 
become stronger and revolutionary thoughts of the father of the 
Islamic revolution of Iran, the late Imam Khomeyni, have spread 
in various parts of the world from north of Africa to the Middle 
East and Central Asia. 
  Threfore, said the article, apparently the U.S. 
Administration has been unable to check further spread of the 
divine thoughts of this Islamic movement. 
  It warned against rumours on the possibility of 
reconciliation with the U.S. and called on the Iranian nation to 
remain vigilant and continue their anti-U.S. move.

<F P=106> [Commentary by the News Research and Commentaries Group] </F>
  [Text] On 9 April 1980 the complete severance of 
Iranian-U.S. diplomatic relations was announced. At first 
glance, some people who had lost face vis-a-vis the power of the 
United States as a superpower said that this would weaken and 
defeat Iran and called for the removal of the elements that had 
led to the deterioration of Iranian-U.S. relations. However, 
the founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran adopted a decisive 
stance and removed the negative impacts of this incorrect 
interpretation which was weakening the revolution. By 
describing U.S. relations with Iran as relations between a wolf 
and a lamb, Imam Khomeyni, may his soul be sanctified, rejected 
such unjust relations and explicitly stated that not only are 
these relations not to the benefit of Iran but they are also to 
the detriment of the revolution and its sacred objectives. 
  With the passage of 14 years since the complete severance of 
Iranian-U.S. relations and with the developments and changes of 
conditions in the various fields that have come about, the issue 
of Iranian-U.S. relations is again in the limelight, and some 
people are optimistically advising the resumption of relations. 
The reasoning of this group is that, given our country's 
economic problems, we can solve these problems if we establish 
relations with the United States. This group claims that by 
improving our relations with the United States, we can enjoy 
U.S. assistance and that the obstacles that the United States 
creates on the international scene will be removed, thus 
allowing us to enjoy assistance and support by other countries 
too, which will make us stronger in dealing with problems. 
  There may be a similarity between this group's argument and 
the argument of those who intended to oust the Sandinists from 
the Nicaraguan power scene. When the duel between the 
Sandinists and the opposition coalition started in Nicaragua, 
the anti-Sandinists' reasoning was that once they came to power 
and relations with the United States improved, all of 
Nicaragua's problems would be solved. With this promise, this 
group succeeded in gaining power with a very small majority of 
votes. But contrary to what the propaganda had said, neither 
was there the flood of U.S. assistance to Nicaragua nor did 
Nicaragua's economic problems end. The assistance that the 
United States allocated to Chamorro's government was not an 
amount that could solve Nicaragua's problems. It was only a 
tool to control that country. 
  Under the current conditions, even as some people speak 
about 
a change in U.S. behavior toward Iran and consider the desire of 
U.S. officials for improved relations with Iran reason to 
establish relations with the United States, a look at White 
House politics makes us realize that no change has taken place 
in that country's behavior. Use of instruments such as human 
rights and nuclear arms to defame Iran in international forums; 
efforts to prevent assistance to and support for Iran by 
international organizations; and efforts to upset the relations 
of European countries and Japan with Iran to inflict as much 
pressure as possible on Iran all show that the United States' 
hostile position regarding Iran has not changed. Moreover, 
Iranian assets continue to be frozen in the United States even 
though, on several occasions, Iranian officials have called on 
the United States to halt its policy of blocking Iranian assets. 
  The enmity of the United States toward Iran is actually the 
result of the independent policies of the Islamic Republic of 
Iran. What the United States wants is that Iran give up its 
independent path and follow U.S. policies. As long as the 
Islamic Republic of Iran continues on its independent path, the 
United States will not make peace or establish friendship with 
the Iranian nation. This is why, when commenting on the unjust 
and hostile U.S. stance on Iran, the esteemed leader of the 
Islamic Republic compared the current conditions for the 
establishment of relations with the United States with the 
conditions that prevailed in 1980 and said that nothing has 
changed. This is why, in answer to whispers about the 
commencement of talks with the United States, he stated that 
beginning talks with the United States is a prologue to 
impositions and defeats.

  [Text] Although Redha Malek's stepping down as Algerian 
prime minister and Mokdad Sifi's replacing him is considered a 
sign of the volatile political situation there, the change could 
find a solution to the prevailing crisis. 
  Political analysts believe a dichotomy of views exists 
within 
the Algerian ruling party. The first, which is headed by former 
Prime Minister Redha Malek, believes in the ruthless suppression 
of Islamists, that their elimination from the country's 
political scene can end the Algerian political crisis, and that 
with financial assistance from the West, the unbridled economic 
crisis can be reined in. 
  The second group--and it is not yet clear whether Mokdad 
Sifi 
belongs to this group--contends that Islamism is a 
sociopolitical reality in Algeria with an extensive popular 
base. The acceptance of this reality can be a preamble to every 
measure to solve the Algerian political crisis. 
  Protagonists of the second view consider a security 
crackdown 
on the trend of Islamism as futile and advocate that 
negotiations with the Islamic Salvation Front [FIS], delegation 
of power to the FIS, and FIS involvement would give the 
government a better popular base. This would also guarantee a 
solution to the multifaceted crisis in the country. 
  This group has a similar stance to the first group regarding 
Western financial assistance to solve the country's economic 
crisis. The domination of the former coupist council by the 
first group and the current government appointed by it has 
generated the impression that every Algerian prime minister 
belongs to the first group, that is, those who contribute to the 
concept of suppressing Islamic movements. But the performance 
of the subsequent government, which merely worsened the social, 
political, and economic crisis in Algeria, eroded this 
impression and confirmed its ineptitude. 
  The resulting situation paved the way for the second group 
to 
come to power, that is, those who believe in a political 
solution, not force, to resolve the multifaceted Algerian 
crisis. New Algerian Prime Minister Mokdad Sifi's stressing the 
need for extensive efforts to foster national solidarity is 
perhaps a sign that the new prime minister has different views 
from those of his predecessors. 
  What is certain is that raising the level of national 
solidarity in Algeria--a prerequisite for resolving the 
country's crisis--can only be achieved by displaying goodwill 
and adopting an amicable path before the Islamists, not by 
denying political realities.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Tehran Fails To Prompt Damascus To </F>
Boycott Peace Negotiations"] 
  [Text] Tehran, London, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- High-ranking 
Iranian sources admitted yesterday that Iran and Syria "have 
agreed to differ" over the peace process in the Middle East. 
  Last week Iran made its last attempt to persuade Syria to 
abandon the U.S.-sponsored peace talks, when a senior mullah 
visited Damascus. 
  The mullah in question, Hassan Rohani, met with Syrian 
President Hafiz al-Asad and delivered to him two messages from 
"Supreme Guide" 'Ali Khamene'i and President Hashemi Rafsanjani. 
He said that the two men asked al-Asad in their messages to 
"reconsider" the Madrid process before visiting Tehran. But 
contrary to what was rumored at the beginning, no agreement has 
been reached on a date for al-Asad's visit. The Syrian 
leadership is still determined to pursue the line discussed in 
detail at the al-Asad-Clinton summit in Geneva in January. 
  On his return to Tehran, Rohani, who holds the posts of 
deputy speaker of the Iranian Majles and secretary general of 
the Supreme National Security Council, described the peace 
process as a "conspiracy." But Syrian authorities said later 
that Rohani's statement describes "just the PLO-Israeli 
agreement," not the peace process as a whole. 
  Over the past two years Iran has tried to establish a 
"rejectionist front" under its leadership. Iranian leaders say 
that they understand that Syria does not want to impose 
isolation on itself by pulling out of the talks. However, they 
believe that Damascus is capable of adopting "courageous stands" 
on the establishment of a new "rejectionist front." 
  Five high-ranking Iranian delegations have sought to stress 
this point to the Syrians during visits to Damascus over the 
past six months. One of these delegations was headed by Foreign 
Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati. One was headed by Hassan Habibi, 
first assistant to Rafsanjani. But these visits did not produce 
joint statements on their conclusion -- which indicates the 
existence of differences over vital topics. 
  There are two disagreements between Damascus and Tehran over 
two other issues in addition to the peace process question. 
  The first is to do with Lebanon's future in general and 
Hizballah's role in particular. It seems that Syria is 
determined to disarm the party in question in all Lebanese 
areas, except the south, where it is confronting the 
Israeli-occupied "security belt." But Iran wants Hizballah to 
remain free in all Lebanese areas. 
  Tehran is alarmed at the failure of Lebanese President Ilyas 
al-Hirawi and Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri to visit Iran 
despite their agreement "in principle" to do so. 
  The cause of the second disagreement between Tehran and 
Damascus is Syria's support for the United Arab Emirates' 
position on the dispute over the three islands [Tunb al-Kubra, 
Tunb al-Sughra, and Abu Musa] situated near the Strait of Hormuz.

  [Text] President Yasir 'Arafat's plane landed in Amman, 
without any prearrangements, and was received by Prime Minister 
Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali. Meanwhile, a senior Jordanian 
official asked: Why has this man come and what does he want? 
  Foreign Minister Talal al-Hasan, King Husayn's political 
adviser Marwan al-Qasim, and Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali arrived 
one after the other at the al-Hashimiyah Palace, where President 
Yasir 'Arafat was staying. At 2130, his majesty the king and 
his royal highness the crown prince arrived at the al-Hashimiyah 
Palace. The two sides talked for approximately one hour and 
then went to dine with the king. 
  Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] reviewed part of the talks with 
Israel and complained about the Rabin government's 
procrastination, prevarication, and oscillating policies. He 
added that the Rabin government, which shows enthusiasm for 
achieving progress in the settlement process, keeps retreating 
from this enthusiasm as a result of pressure from the Army. 
  Abu-'Ammar said that Israel is divided and that the views of 
the politicians in the Rabin government regarding the peace 
process are different from the views of the Army, which is 
becoming influential on the political level. Abu-'Ammar said 
that it has been decided that the settlements in Gaza will be 
dismantled, but Israel wants a high price in return. Regarding 
the Hebron settlements, the Government of Israel promised to 
tighten their grip on them and to place harsh conditions on the 
settlers there to force them to leave. 
  Abu-'Ammar expressed his belief that all of the settlements 
in the West Bank will not be that difficult of a problem in the 
long run, however, he added, the major complication lies in the 
issue of Jerusalem and the settlements around it, which are 
growing every day. 
  Following his review of the Palestinian stand, King Husayn 
asked 'Arafat: What do you want from Jordan? And how do you 
view Jordanian-Palestinian coordination and cooperation at the 
present time? 
  His majesty said: We, in Jordan, call on you to form a 
permanent bilateral coordination committee so that our acts will 
not conflict with yours, so that the dialogue with Israel will 
not be at both our and your expense, so that the results of your 
talks with Israel will not undermine Jordanian interests, and so 
that the solutions will not be at the expense of Jordan and its 
role. 
  When President 'Arafat failed to respond and attempted to 
change the course of the discussions, Prince Hasan repeated the 
demand to launch a permanent coordination committee, as his 
majesty the king had just proposed. Prince Hasan added: What 
we want is to create a permanent framework for cooperation, one 
that brings together politicians and specialized experts. This 
framework must have a permanent headquarters and meet regularly. 
This is important if our coordination is not to be accomplished 
in pieces. 
  Abu-'Ammar approved this proposal. He insisted, however, 
that both sides start with a joint committee on Jerusalem, with 
the understanding that the powers of this committee will expand 
in the future to include all aspects of cooperation and 
coordination between Jordan and the PLO. This is because the 
Palestinian president, who is planning to return to Gaza on 15 
May 1994, believes that his bargaining position will be enhanced 
once he sets foot on Palestinian territory. He believes that 
once he does so, his dealings with Jordan will be on an equal 
footing. 
  His majesty the king reiterated the need for continuous and 
clear coordination between Jordan and the PLO in the face of 
Israeli ambitions and U.S. pressure. He also urged President 
'Arafat to hold consultations with Syria and Lebanon, and to 
cooperate with them. He insinuated that true cooperation is 
currently taking place among Amman, Damascus, and Beirut, noting 
that the PLO's involvement in this cooperation would consummate 
inter-Arab cooperation. 
  President 'Arafat halfheartedly agreed to the king's 
proposals. But, he changed the subject addressing King Husayn 
jokingly, saying: Your Majesty the King, please protect me from 
the PLO Executive Committee members. They disagree with me on 
most issues. Then, Abu-'Ammar plunged into a lengthy talk on 
the U.S. penetration of Islamic movements. He cited many things 
that he said he learned when he attempted to mediate between 
[former president of Afghanistan] Najibullah and the Afghan 
mujahidin. He said that he then discovered the great influence 
the United States wielded within the ranks of the Afghan 
mujahidin, an eventuality made possible by the arms provided to 
them by the CIA. He said that U.S. planes landed in 
Afghanistan, carrying the most sophisticated weapons to the 
mujahidin, and returned with planeloads of heroine and various 
other drugs. 
  It was midnight, and the royal banquet was over when his 
majesty the king and other Jordanian officials left the 
al-Hashimiyah Palace with hopes of effecting a transition from a 
phase of piecemeal coordination to a phase of regular and 
continuous coordination between Jordan and the PLO.

<F P=106> [News conference by King Husayn and Austrian President </F>
Thomas Klestil with unidentified correspondents at the Royal 
Hashemite Court in Amman on 11 April --recorded, in English with 
Arabic subtitles] 
  [Text] [Husayn] Your Excellency, and our dear friends: 
Sir, we once again, on behalf of all Jordanians, extend to you 
a very hearty welcome to Jordan, together with the group of 
friends from Austria who are accompanying you on this visit. We 
are more than happy to have this opportunity to speak as 
brethren do, and as friends do, interested in the same causes, 
interested in the same problems that confront us in our 
respective regions, and in this large global village, which is 
our world. We are proud of the very special relations, and 
relationship that has grown over the years, in terms of its 
roots and history between Austria and Jordan, Austria and the 
Arab world. We are very happy to have seen us coming closer 
together over the years, and to see our relations based on 
mutual respect and cooperation, and a desire to help and 
influence events around us for a better future for mankind. 
  Mr. President: Once again, on behalf of the Government of 
Jordan, and the people of Jordan, and for myself, a very hearty 
welcome. Thank you, sir. 
  [Klestil] Well, Your Majesty: It was with great pleasure 
that I have accepted the invitation, this state visit to Jordan, 
particularly at a time where the peace process has reached a 
point, where the hopes of people who, which were, maybe, too 
high, are endangered by many expectations, where frustration is 
coming up here and there. So, I came to his majesty as a close 
friend of Austria, of the Austrian people, as a key figure in 
the peace process, as an anchor of stability in the region, 
without whom there can be no solution of the Palestinian 
problem. And I was very happy to get an assessment of his 
majesty of the situation. We talked about the region, the 
possibilities if peace were to be achieved here, what kind of 
economic opportunities this would mean for the people of the 
region, and what role Europe and Austria could play. We also 
talked about developments in Europe. We talked about the crisis 
in Bosnia, where his majesty is personally also very interested 
in, and about the dialogue of the different religions. And I 
was able to inform his majesty about a conference we will 
organize in Vienna at the end of this year, a trialogue between 
leading representatives of Islam, Judaism, and Christianity. 
So, thank you very much, Your Majesty, for your kind 
hospitality. You make us all as Austrians feel like home. And 
I thank you for your friendship, and your confidence. 
  [Husayn] Thank you, sir. And I really hope that you will 
feel half as much at home as we feel whenever we are in Austria, 
which we love, not only for myself, but I am sure for all who 
know Austria from this country, sir. Thank you so much. You 
are most welcome, sir. 
  How can we handle this, the question is [words indistinct] 
myself. 
  [Correspondent, in progress] ...on Jordan's response to 
changing the inspection measures at al-'Aqabah? 
  [Husayn] You know of our position as far as this intolerable 
situation that has lasted far too long in regard to al-'Aqabah, 
and this treatment that has been directed at Jordan in 
particular out of all the countries of this region. We have -- 
regardless of our feelings -- done our utmost to implement 
Security Council resolutions as they affect our brethren in 
Iraq. Yet, this has been another unique and unusual treatment 
that Jordan has been selected for over many, many years. This 
situation is totally intolerable, and I had the opportunity a 
while ago to make a point of raising the problem with the 
ambassadors of the five permanent representatives at the 
Security Council, and, to explain at the same time that we are 
forced to suggest that our continuing efforts that have come 
from our hearts for the cause of a just, durable peace in this 
region from the outset -- our continuation in terms of these 
efforts is contingent on resolving this problem because we 
cannot be mistrusted on the one hand and humiliated as a people 
and yet continue to play this role that we have played sincerely 
and honestly. And we will not bow to any unwarranted pressure 
from any quarter. So, we have an indication that the problem is 
being addressed and we hope that we will have a positive 
response soon. 
  [Correspondent] Your Majesty: Jordan agreed to join the 
peace process based on the implementation of UN Resolution 242. 
Now after the Oslo agreement, do you still see that this 
process is heading in the direction of the implementation of 242 
as was conceived, or do you see that the Madrid formula for the 
implementation of the resolution has taken a different shape 
after the PLO-Israeli agreement? 
  [Husayn] As you know, we went to Madrid, and we provided the 
umbrella for our Palestinian brethren to go there. In terms of 
history, the Arab summit at Rabat in 1974 adopted a resolution. 
Let me be absolutely clear that the PLO was the sole legitimate 
representatives of the people of Palestine. We had historically 
been involved with 242 and its formulation. And then we had the 
Oslo agreement, which is an expression of a Palestinian will to 
address their problems by themselves, having accepted Security 
Council Resolutions 242 and 338. So, it is not up to me to say 
whether we are implementing 242 or not or seeing its 
implementation. But as far as I am concerned I believe that it 
has to be the foundation for the resolution of the problem and 
the tragedy of this area and this people. And I believe, as we 
have said, sir, that we are at a very critical moment where many 
of the hopes and aspirations of so many on either side of the 
divide were raised at a certain point but are now passing 
through a critical phase of wondering where it's leading to. 
  So, I hope and pray that we will see renewed efforts -- 
serious and determined and clear in the intent on establishing a 
just, durable peace that the future generations can live with 
and protect to the benefit of all concerned. And in finally 
addressing the root cause of instability in this entire region; 
the Palestinian-Israeli dimension of the problem and the 
Arab-Israeli dimension of it together. We are searching for a 
comprehensive peace. I think that this is a critical moment for 
things either progressing and soon, or the loss of hope and the 
slide into the abyss of despair and disaster as far as everybody 
is concerned. 
  [Correspondent] French News Agency. You talked of a 
conference, a trialogue in Vienna in December was representative 
of Christianity, Islam, and Judaism. Will you tackle the 
problem of Jerusalem in that conference as Jerusalem represents 
the three religions? 
  [Klestil] Well, I'm not the organizer of the conference. 
So, I cannot tell you about the details. I think it's the 
principles of a religious dialogue that is the main agenda of 
that conference. 
  [Correspondent] Austrian TV. Your Majesty, Austria has a 
major political crisis about 500 km far from its borders. I 
mean the crisis in Bosnia. What is your personal point of view 
on behalf of the crisis? I mean the strong reaction of the 
Atlantic Treaty forces, I mean the continuing resistance of the 
Serbs, and I mean the angry reaction of Russia. 
  [Husayn] Sir, I haven't been able to follow all the details 
of the latest developments. But, the crisis is very worrisome 
as far as we are concerned and it's a crisis we have felt 
ourselves all along. And it is a crisis that is awaiting a 
resolution which we haven't seen so far. It is a test to the 
international community's will and to the United Nations. And 
maybe it is the first major crisis that this world has seen 
following many changes that have occurred in this world in the 
recent past. 
  For our part, sir, we are a part of the United Nation's 
presence in the former Yugoslavia. And this country within its 
limited means has done everything that it could and will 
continue to do everything that it could in the future to help 
the cause of peace and tranquility and the end of suffering of 
people there. 
  As you know, we are proud to have been able to provide the 
second largest force of any in terms of the United Nations' 
efforts there. Now, we have to watch and see what happens in the 
coming period. But, failure there by all of us is going to open 
the way for all sorts of dangers beyond the limits of the areas 
affected immediately now. And it will be a problem for all of 
us, I believe, in Europe, here, and in the world as a whole in 
terms of this particular problem. But, it will also be a very 
dangerous precedent that could mean the spread of chaos in our 
world instead of the so called world order that people thought 
was coming into being. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. President, did Europe have any 
economics plan to help the Middle East countries after peace 
treaty? 
  [Klestil] I didn't understand. 
  [Correspondent] Did Europe have any economics plan to help 
the Middle East countries after achieving peace in our region? 
  [Klestil] There was recently at the meeting of foreign 
ministers of the European Union -- and this was a meeting for 
the first time also the Austrian foreign minister was invited to 
participate together with the other three countries that are 
about to negotiate their becoming a member -- and at that 
conference there was a decision that more attention of the 
European Union should be given and attached to the Middle East. 
And I am absolutely sure, as his majesty said and agreed with 
me in our talks, once there is peace and security in the region 
then all kinds of investment and economic cooperation and 
infrastructure for tourism will come in. And Europe, I am 
absolutely sure, will take over its share, because peace and 
security in the Middle East means peace and security for Europe, 
and danger in the Middle East means danger for Europe. So, 
there's absolutely the same principle interest. 
  [Correspondent] Your Majesty, I want to ask if Jordan is 
going to send a team to the multilateral talks in Oman on water 
in April? 
  [Husayn] If conditions remain the way they are, at best we 
will probably send an observer. 
  [Klestil] Well, you asked about what Europe is doing. I may 
add, from Austria's point of view, we are active and I think we 
are in the chair of the committees within the multilateral peace 
efforts with regard to water, which is an absolute principle and 
main problem in the region, and energy. Those are two areas 
where we are active from the bilateral point of view within the 
multilateral peace efforts. 
  [Correspondent] I'd like to ask a question about the 
blockade 
on al-'Aqabah again. Jordanian officials have been talking 
about pressures on Jordan from mainly the United States and that 
it is linking Jordan signing a peace agreement with Israel to 
lifting the blockade. Can you confirm this? 
  [Husayn] I beg your pardon. 
  [Correspondent] That they are linking Jordan's signing of a 
peace agreement with Israel to the lifting of the blockade on 
al-'Aqabah. is that true? 
  [Husayn] We've made that clear that our continuing in the 
same way that we did is contingent on resolving this problem, on 
lifting this unwarranted embargo on al-'Aqabah. 
  [Correspondent] You've warned about the dangers which the 
region is passing through. Are you satisfied with the U.S. role 
in the peace process, and do you think that the peace process is 
being sidetracked since it was launched in Madrid over two years 
ago? 
  [Husayn] I hope that there will be a growing realization of 
the fact that we are now, in this region, and in regard to the 
peace process, are facing a crisis, or on the verge of it, and I 
hope that all will react to save the peace process from what may 
be a disaster that is looming ahead. And I hope that the United 
States of America and our friends in the world, and certainly 
those who are immediately involved, will realize that we are 
passing through a very difficult moment right now and that it's 
worth looking either at the alternatives, because if this fails, 
then what is left, except disaster for all. 
  [Correspondent] I am [words indistinct] from the Austrian 
Press Agency. From various sides, important [words indistinct] 
in the Middle East, it has been said that Austria should 
continue to contribute to the Middle East peace process. What 
could Austria do for the Middle East peace process in concrete 
terms? 
  [Husayn] I believe that Austria has, and Austria will, 
contribute continuously to the efforts for the establishment of 
peace in this region, hopefully beyond when it is a reality and 
a fact. I think that the opportunity I've had today, not for 
the first time, of discussing the problems of this region, and 
particularly the issue of the peace process with the president, 
is an indication of Austria's concern and determination to do 
whatever our friends can, and now, hopefully within the context 
of Europe in a more meaningful way. I am sure that Austria's 
voice will always be heard for peace, for a just peace, for a 
lasting peace, for a peace that future generations can live 
with. And Austria's contributions would be great in creating 
the understanding of what is happening in the minds of those who 
are not as aware of what is there in the world: Opportunity and 
threat to the peace process and the future of this region. And 
I hope also that Austria will be able to help once we have 
achieved what we have sought for so long: a just, and honorable 
and lasting peace. 
  [Correspondent] Sir, (?You're) speaking very strongly, but a 
bit vaguely about the possibility of a coming disaster. And 
now, I was hoping you might spell out in more concrete terms, 
Your Majesty, what the threats are now, and what you would you 
like to see the United States in particular, and also Israel do 
to move forward, in specific terms? 
  [Husayn] Well, sir: There is no doubt that there is a crisis 
that has developed out of the expectations of people that have 
not been met as yet, not even in the smallest possible degree so 
far. And therefore, the sense of alarm, and the sense of despair 
that is growing, and that is causing a great deal of distress to 
the peace camp, as such, and those who believe in it, wherever 
they are. I hope that the United States will realize how 
dangerous and difficult it is. I realize it is difficult for 
all concerned. But we've got to have the vision, we've got to 
have the determination, we've got to have the help to move 
beyond this point, and on clearly defined lines towards a 
comprehensive settlement, and towards resolving this problem 
once and for all, not on one track alone, but on all tracks, as 
soon as possible. And I hope we will see actions that will help 
us regain the sense of hope that was there, and encourage 
progress as soon as possible. 
  [Correspondent] [Words indistinct] this question to the 
president. Mr. President: You were accompanied by a large 
delegation. And I understand that there had been a talk of 
trade relations and economic cooperation. Are you hopeful, or 
are you sure, that these talks will lead into definite joint 
ventures and projects which will help benefit everybody here? 
Thank you. 
  [Klestil] Well, again, I think the precondition is that the 
business community feels that there will be security and peace 
in the future. As long as there is uncertainty about the future 
developments, there is hesitation for the business community to 
come in and to invest. So, we have a number of projects, and 
ideas brought with us we will discuss with our friends in the 
Jordanian Government. And I had the opportunity to discuss some 
of the more important ones with his majesty. But, as I said, I 
think first there has to be peace and security for the future, 
and then Jordan and the whole region, indeed, will see a 
tremendous positive development in which Europe will play its 
share, and Austria, with its traditional close ties with the 
Arab world in general, with Jordan in particular. And now, 
after our normalization, we have to also say this, after our 
normalization of relations with Israel. If you want to have a 
voice to be heard by all parties concerned, this is now the 
case. And as a future partner in the European Union, we will 
strengthen those voices who promote a strong involvement and 
engagement in the Middle East also as far as business and 
tourism is concerned. So, I am hopeful. But, they have first 
to give the business community the security that there is a good 
and secure future. 
  [Husayn] Thank you very, very much indeed, sir. 
  [Klestil] Thank you, Your Majesty. 
  [Husayn] Thank you so much.

<F P=106> [Speech by King Husayn in Amman on 11 April -- recorded] </F>
  [Text] Your Excellency Mr. President, friends: Peace be 
upon you and God's mercy and his blessings. It is with much 
pleasure that I extend to you and to your accompanying 
delegation a warm word of welcome as valued guests and as 
friends whom we hold in deep affection and high regard. I also 
wish to welcome you on behalf of the people and government of 
the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. Let me assure you that we in 
Jordan take much pride in the ties that happily exist between 
our two countries, founded on trust and cooperation for the 
benefit of our two peoples and based on our common faith in the 
principles of freedom, justice, democracy, and respect for human 
rights. We share with you a sincere desire to contribute in 
building a better future in which subsequent generations can 
live in peace, security, and prosperity. 
  Mr. President, we in Jordan have always stood by the 
striving 
of people for freedom and an independent will. The stand we 
take on this issue is deeply rooted in our history. Our 
democratic drive, inspired by the Constitution and the National 
Charter, which was ratified by a national conference, opting for 
pluralism of opinion, belief, and cultural and ideological 
reference, is a true embodiment of our firm adherence to the 
values of freedom, equality, and regard for human rights. It 
stems from our nation's history, from its message of tolerance, 
and from its great civilizing role. Not only do we cherish our 
democratic march, but we always endeavor with every possible 
means to strengthen its foundations and enrich its fabric to 
serve as a model emulated and sought by others. 
  Mr. President, in the last few decades Jordan has played a 
pivotal role in maintaining the security and stability of our 
region despite the many causes and manifestations of conflict 
and despite Jordan's limited capacity and resources. To this 
end, we have endured much hardship. When circumstances became 
conducive to a convening of the Madrid peace conference, we were 
among the first to respond to the call of peace. We took part 
in the conference itself as well as in meetings that followed 
it. We were diligent in asserting the constant elements of our 
unequivocal stand on the whole question of peace. The elements 
called for the application of resolutions based on international 
legitimacy and for total support for our Palestinian brethren so 
as to enable them to participate in the peace process as a 
prelude to regaining their rights on their national soil. We 
have always been careful to uphold the independence of the 
Palestinian decision and to respect the options made by the 
Palestinian Liberation Organization, the sole legitimate 
representative of the Palestinian people. Our recourse in all 
of this has been an abiding faith in the need to achieve a 
comprehensive, durable, and just peace in a region torn by 
tension and conflict. It is the right of future generations to 
enjoy stability and the state of wellbeing enabling them to make 
their own contribution to the civilization of the modern age. 
  We in Jordan recognize and understand the intricate 
relationship between a realization of peace on the one hand, and 
the achievement of growth and prosperity on the other. Real 
peace can neither stand nor flourish in the absence of 
development and a decent standard of living. Therefore, the 
people of our region look to the international community, and 
specially the countries of Europe, to play a role in the 
promoting of economic development as a major cornerstone for a 
real and lasting peace. 
  Mr. President, in expressing to Your Excellency our pride in 
the distinctive ties between our two countries, based on 
confidence and mutual cooperation for the good of our two 
peoples, I wish to assure you of our keen desire to foster and 
strengthen those bonds in all walks of life and in the various 
fields of endeavor. 
  My friend, I reiterate our pleasure at having you and your 
accompanying delegation here as guests of the Hashemite Kingdom 
of Jordan and as valued friends. I wish you health and 
happiness and a very pleasant stay among us. Ahlan wa sahlan. 
[preceding words in Arabic: "you are welcome"] Once again peace 
be with you and God's mercy and His blessings. [applause]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Husayn Sounds the Alarm of Regional Disaster"] </F>
  [Text] The Austrian president's visit to Jordan and his 
successful talks with His Majesty King Husayn and his pursuit of 
increased bilateral cooperation and a more dynamic Middle East 
peace process all amount to a positive step on the part of 
Austria -- a friend of Jordan. The Austrian president called 
for a more pronounced European role to propel the peace process 
forward on the basis of UN resolutions. 
  At yesterday's news conference, the Austrian leader 
applauded 
Jordan's leading role in the effort to bring a just and 
comprehensive peace to the Middle East, thereby confirming the 
respect in which Jordan, led by His Majesty King Husayn, is held 
in Europe and internationally. 
  Appearing at the same news conference, his majesty called 
for 
reactivating the peace process, which he warned is now in a 
critical condition that threatens to plunge the region into a 
disaster, should the peace process unravel. His majesty 
reiterated that Middle East security impinges on European 
security and vice versa. 
  His majesty openly called for lifting the unjustifiable 
blockade of the Port of al-'Aqabah, and reiterated that Jordan's 
continued participation in the bilateral multilateral talks, 
slated to reconvene this month, is contingent on removal of the 
blockade, which is taking a heavy toll on the country's economy. 
  His majesty's warning about a regional disaster if the peace 
process is not put gack on track was made against the backdrop 
of disappointment over the lack of progress on all fronts. His 
majesty also indicated that the pressures and harassments 
directed at the Arab parties involved in the peace process, 
including Jordan, can hardly advance the peace process or 
promote a just, lasting, and comprehensive peace in the region. 
  It does not stand to reason that the blockade should be kept 
in place and thus hurt Jordan's economy, trade, and well-being, 
and, in the meantime, to expect it to exert itself on behalf of 
the peace process. It is all the more absurd that Jordan should 
be treated thus, when it has fully complied with UN Security 
Council resolutions on Iraq. 
  The peoples of the region want to see peace established 
along 
the lines of Resolutions 242, 338, and 425 and the 
land-for-peace formula. 
  It is hoped the European Union and the United States, as 
well 
as Russia and the other permanent members of the Security 
Council, will grasp the significance of his majesty's remark 
about the need to reactivate the peace process and put it back 
on track on all fronts, before a disaster strikes, when 
contrition will be unavailing.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by </F>
unidentified reporters; place and date not given: "Israel: 
`Fanatics Will Not Stop Peace'"] 
  [Text] [BILD AM SONNTAG] Following the Hebron massacre, 
the Palestinians have been carrying out bloody acts of revenge 
the past few days. The Islamic Hamas resistance group has 
threatened to start a war in the occupied territories. Can 
there be peace at all and an agreement between the PLO and 
Israel under these conditions? 
  [Peres] The Israeli Government will continue to fight 
against terror with all its available means. Yet, we will not 
interrupt the peace negotiations for a single moment and we will 
continue with great determination to put the Gaza-Jericho 
agreement into practice. These murderers not only want to kill 
innocent people, but they want to stop the peace process. Any 
interruption of the negotiations would be a reward for these 
murderous terrorists. 
  [BILD AM SONNTAG] Do you fear retaliatory acts by radical 
Jewish settlers? 
  [Peres] Fanatics on both sides are trying to sabotage the 
peace process. Yet, our desire for peace is stronger than these 
fanatics. After the Hebron massacre, we arrested radical 
settlers and disarmed others. 
  [BILD AM SONNTAG] Will the group of international observers 
be able to stop the violence? 
  [Peres] A total of 160 observers from Italy, Denmark, and 
Norway will be arriving here before too long. As soon as this 
group arrives in Hebron, we hope the atmosphere will calm down. 
However, I would like to repeat and emphasize: There can be no 
substitute for cooperation between Israel and the Palestinians; 
together we must create the basis for coexistence in peace. 
  [BILD AM SONNTAG] What assistance for a peaceful solution do 
you expect from the international community of states and from 
Germany, in particular? 
  [Peres] The international community of states and Germany 
have already committed themselves very strongly. They support 
the economic development of the countries in the Middle East. 
Of particular importance is the improvement in the 
Palestinians' standard of living. If we manage to improve their 
lives, then we will also be able to convince other Arabs who are 
our neighbors that peace is an advantage for everyone.

  [Text] The mission of the international observers in Hebron 
is now under way. This is the first operation of its type in 
the territories occupied by Israel. Giovanni Bocco reports: 
  [Bocco] It was a lightning visit by the delegation of 
international observers in Hebron. Two officers from the 
Italian carabinieri force were also present. They spoke with 
the Palestinian mayor of the city and with the Israelis about 
the organizational aspects of the mandate. 
  There will be 35 Italian observers, but only 15 will be 
permanently stationed in Hebron. After leaving the private 
room, the negotiators entered the council chamber, which was 
full of people. There was a handshake between the mayor, a UN 
delegate, and Yitzhaq Rabin's representative. However, the 
smiles did not hide the fact that there were still many things 
to be decided. The two Italian delegates are Colonel Pietro 
Pistolese and Major Giovanni Trullio. They come from the 
Tuscagna carabinieri parachute regiment, which has already seen 
action in Somalia as part of the Ibis mission. Here is the head 
of the Italian delegation, Colonel Pistolese: 
  [Pistolese] This is the first contact... 
  [Bocco, interrupting] Have you overcome the obstacle of 
security? 
  [Pistolese] No. For the moment there are no security 
problems. We are welcomed and we hope to be good guests. 
  [Bocco] Will you be completely disarmed. I have heard that 
this will be so? 
  [Pistolese] We are working on this. We are just at the 
beginning of our mandate. It is premature... 
  [Bocco, interrupting] How do you think that this meeting has 
gone? 
  [Pistolese] Well. 
  [Bocco] The 160 UN observers: 90 Norwegians, 35 Danes, and 
35 
Italians will have to operate in a difficult situation. Hebron 
is a fortress of the Islamic fundamentalists, but four 
kilometers away there is a colony of some 5,000 Jewish settlers. 
Friction is the order of the day.

  [Text] Jerusalem, April 10 (AFP) -- The occupied 
territories are to remain closed at least for another week and 
18,250 foreign workers will be imported to replace Arab labour, 
the Israeli government announced Sunday [10 April]. 
  The closure, which was enforced last Thursday after Islamic 
militants killed eight Israelis and wounded about 50, will be 
reviewed at next Sunday's weekly cabinet meeting, Environment 
Minister Yosi Sarid told journalists. 
  "We cannot allow terrorism to influence the peace process 
and 
put it in jeopardy," he said as Israel and the PLO resumed 
negotiations in Cairo to try to launch Palestinian autonomy in 
the Gaza Strip and West Bank town of Jericho. 
  Israel would recruit 15,000 east European workers for the 
construction industry and 3,250 farm labourers, mainly from 
Thailand and Turkey, to take over from Palestinians, Labour 
Minister Ora Namir said after the cabinet session. 
  It would take three to five weeks to organize the imported 
labour, she said. 
  The government would also grant 13-dollar daily subsidies to 
each of 4,000 Israeli workers, who are paid more than 
Palestinians. 
  Communications Minister Shulamit Aloni warned earlier Sunday 
that the ban could spark "the start of a famine" and should be 
lifted this week. 
  "We cannot cause the start of a famine by a imposing a total 
indefinite ban on two million Palestinians," Aloni told Israel 
radio. 
  "We are responsible for the economic backwardness of the 
territories and we have exploited them during 27 years of 
occupation." 
  "The ban should be lifted straight after the Independence 
Day 
holidays (on Thursday) [14 April]," Aloni said. 
  The West Bank and Gaza Strip have been officially sealed 
since the end of March 1993 following a wave of killings, but 
the restrictions were greatly relaxed in the months before the 
Hebron mosque massacre. 
  Authorities tightened the ban after the February 25 
slaughter 
of 30 Moslems by a Jewish settler, in a bid to prevent revenge 
attacks. But in recent weeks more than 25,000 Palestinians 
received new work permits for Israel. 
  Before the 1993 ban, some 100,000 Palestinians worked in 
Israel. 
  Palestinian earnings in Israel represent about one-third of 
the Gross National Product of the territories.

  [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin this evening said the 
government will regularly examine the closure policy. Our 
correspondent Yaron Deqel spoke with the prime minister this 
evening: 
  [Begin recording] [Rabin] We want to calm the situation and 
create conditions amenable to the continuation of the 
negotiations. The government, and myself as prime minister, are 
determined not to allow the enemies and murderers of peace -- 
mainly from the Palestinian side; but following the Hebron 
massacre I can say from our side too -- to stop the peace 
process. This applies both to Palestinian extremists and to a 
handful of Jews who carry out such acts, as already happened.

  [Text] Several of the Meretz ministers have expressed 
reservations with the idea of imposing a total closure on the 
territories for an indefinite period. Minister Shulamit Aloni 
favors imposing a closure until after Independence Day [15 
April] while granting permits to work inside israel to as many 
laborers from the territories as possible. Aloni told our 
political correspondent Shlomo Raz that the opposition's 
incitement should not dictate the government's moves. 
  Minister Yosi Sarid believes that imposing a closure on the 
territories was necessary; however, Sarid said, the duration and 
scope of the closure would have to be discussed further. 
  Minister Ya'ir Tzaban supports imposing a closure that would 
be limited in its duration and scope. At the same time, Tzaban 
called for vigorous action to reduce the damages the closure 
will cause.

  [Text] Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu has rejected the 
prime minister's accusations that the opposition members rejoice 
at the sight of the spilled blood of terror victims. Speaking 
to our correspondent this morning, he said Labor had promised 
that through the peace process, it would remove terror from 
within the boundaries of the Green Line. According to him, 
since the State of Israel was founded, the state of security has 
not been as unstable as it is now. He added that he supports 
the closure but, according to him, the government has been 
pulling Israel Army soldiers out of certain places in the 
territories and replacing them with the terrorists' army. Such 
acts are stupid and dangerous to the citizens of Israel, 
Netanyahu said.

to stab policemen at the Western Wall plaza in Jerusalem, but 
the policemen overcame them. Our correspondent Aviv Bushinsky 
reports that the two apparently managed to enter the plaza armed 
with knives despite the metal detector placed at the entrance. 
  Earlier, a knife-wielding youngster was arrested in East 
Jerusalem as he approached a Border Police unit. Our 
correspondent Aviv Bushinsky reports that when interrogated the 
youngster he said he sought arrest because of a family feud. 
  A girl bearing a knife was arrested near the Cave of the 
Patriarchs when she tried to stab a border policeman. 
  A large demonstration was staged this afternoon in Hebron to 
protest the ongoing closure of the mosque at the Cave of the 
Patriarchs. The security forces were forced to use tear gas, 
and four demonstrators were injured when they inhaled it.

  [Text] An Arab woman was fatally shot by an Israeli truck 
driver in the territories today. The incident occurred near the 
village of al-Jib, south of Ramallah. 
  Our correspondent in the territories Golan Yokhpaz reports 
that the man was driving a Coca-Cola truck along the Pisgat 
Ze'ev road in the direction of al-Ram junction when local 
residents apparently threw stones at the truck. The driver 
fired several shots from his handgun, killing a local woman on 
the spot. The commander of the Judaea Region police reported 
that searches to find the driver are currently under way.

    [Editorial Report] Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in English at 
1030 GMT on 10 April reports that "Waqf official Muhammad 
Abu-Salah testified this morning before the Hebron massacre 
commission of inquiry that Barukh Goldstein struck him to the 
floor when he tried to stop him from entering the Muslim prayer 
hall. Three Waqf officials are testifying today after being 
ordered to do so after they initially refused." 
  Later in the report, Qol Yisra'el notes that "Muhammad 
Abu-Salah said Goldstein had caused some problems in the past, 
but not as much as other settlers. He had refused to leave the 
Muslim section when asked to by Waqf officials but no specific 
complaint had been made against him." Abu-Salah said that "he 
had tried to stop Goldstein entering the Muslim hall on the 
morning of the massacre. Goldstein said: `I am an officer,' 
pointing to his officer's insignia. Abu-Salah said he was still 
not allowed in and Goldstein hit him with his rifle. Abu-Salah 
fell to the ground and Goldstein walked past him and opened fire 
on the worshipers." 
  The first Waqf official to testify, 'Isma'il al-Shilmun, 
said 
he had seen Goldstein a few times in the past, although he was 
not one of the regular Jewish worshipers. He said Goldstein was 
the only person to fire shots at the Muslim worshipers. 
Al-Shilmun admitted that there were only six Waqf guards on 
duty at the time of the massacre instead of eight. He described 
a history of tension and acts of provocation by Jewish 
worshipers and claimed that on numerous occasions he had 
informed the military governor and Civil Administration 
officials but nothing was done to change the situation. 
According to al-Shilmun, in the past Jews poured acid or placed 
sharp objects on the Muslim prayer mats, offered the Muslims 
alcohol, and repeatedly shouted insults and opened the door 
dividing the Jewish and Muslim sections before the allotted 
time. On the night before the massacre, the settlers 
celebrating Purim told the Muslims to drink wine, threw a toy 
grenade, and shouted out such things as `this is our land and 
you are our dogs.' Muslims responded with shouts of al-Qassam, 
al-Qassam -- after the Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] 'Izz 
al-Din al-Qassam terrorists -- and God is Great. The Waqf 
officials denied that there were chants of Kill the Jews. 
Al-Shilmun said that some of the Jewish worshipers came to pray 
without provocation and respected the sanctity of the place. He 
also said that some of the officers in charge of the site were 
strict with the settlers and clamped down on any provocations, 
but others were less strict and failed to act against the 
settlers. 
  Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1200 GMT on 10 April, in 
a similar report on the commission hearings, adds: "the three 
Waqf officials testified that they did not see another man with 
Barukh Goldstein. One of the guards leveled sharp complaints 
against Dov Stelman, the Army commander at the Cave of the 
Patriarchs, and said that tensions between Muslims and Jews had 
risen sharply after Stelman's assignment to the post. 
Contradictions were found between one guard's testimony today 
and his original statement to the police. The guard, Muhammad 
Sulayman Abu-Salah, told the police that he had seen four 
soldiers and an officer outside the prayer hall, but told the 
Shamgar Commission that he had not seen any soldiers."

<F P=106> [Report by Dalya Shehori] </F>
  [Excerpts] Mystery surrounds the presence of a second 
person who entered the Cave of the Patriarchs after Barukh 
Goldstein and who, according to testimonies by soldiers who 
guarded the eastern gate, was carrying a Galil rifle. When 
Major Dov Stelman, the cave commander, arrived at the cave and 
ordered all those present to remain on the premises, this person 
had already left and was not questioned by the police. Colonel 
Yo'av Galant, who testified before the Shamgar Commission on 31 
March behind closed doors, said "some degree of cooperation may 
be involved here." 
  Col. Galant believes Goldstein's operation was planned. 
Galant outlined the conclusions and recommendations he drafted 
in a report he prepared at the request of Major General Sha'ul 
Mufaz, commander of the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] troops in 
the West Bank. The report recommends that the prevailing status 
quo at the cave be changed and that a full "territorial" 
division be made between Jews and Muslims by banning the Jews 
from praying at Isaac Hall; that new security arrangements be 
prepared and that the cave be reopened to the public only after 
they are completed, "even if it takes a very long time;" and 
that the security arrangements include stationing a significant 
police force, an antiterror team, and a permanent and 
well-trained military unit. The report also recommends that, 
after all of the steps are taken, worshipers not be allowed to 
enter the cave armed. [passage omitted] 
  Col. Galant presented his report to Gen. Mufaz and to Maj. 
Gen. Dani Yatom, commander of the Central Command, on 7 March, 
10 days after the massacre. Upon his request, Galant testified 
behind closed doors but, following a HA'ARETZ appeal, the 
privileged status of the testimony was lifted. [passage omitted] 
  Answering a question by Commission Chairman Shamgar, Col. 
Galant confirmed that "the other person was only seen coming in; 
no one saw him leave." Shamgar speculated, therefore, that the 
man could have left the cave along with the Arabs who were 
fleeing after the shooting, and Galant agreed. [passage omitted] 
  Galant further said that it is assumed that Goldstein 
entered 
Isaac Hall from Abraham Hall and that the Jewish worshipers 
there did not know what his purpose was -- that is, they were 
not certain he was about to commit an act of violence. Perhaps 
they thought that "in the framework of the constant provocations 
that take place in the cave, they would let him in to tease the 
Arabs a little; after all, it was Purim. No big deal. Then 
Goldstein went in, and they closed the doors behind him." 
Galant stressed, however, that he had no evidence to support 
this assumption and that he only brought it up to illustrate the 
dilemmas he encountered while preparing his report, but he 
formed no opinion on this issue. [passage omitted] 
  Col. Galant believes "Goldstein's act was premeditated." 
This assumption is based on the fact that he was carrying a 
large number of magazines and that he left notes indicating that 
he feared he might not return from his operation. "He went 
there to shoot; otherwise, it is hard to explain why he took 
earplugs with him. I believe everything he did was perfectly 
timed to the moment the Muslims kneel to pray to attain the 
maximum effect during his attack," he noted. 
  Galant added that Goldstein was killed by blows to the head 
from heavy objects and did not shoot himself, as was initially 
believed. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The administrative detention of Kakh activist 
Shmu'el Ben-Yishay will be shortened by a month for personal 
reasons. He will be released within two weeks, the Supreme 
Court decided today. Our correspondent Mira Amsalem reports that 
Ben-Yishay was issued an order confining him to the boundaries 
of Qiryat Arba' and compelling him to report to the police every 
day for two months. He also undertook not to give interviews to 
the media, address public rallies, or engage in incitement. 
  The Jerusalem District Court gave Mendes Qeysar, an 
inhabitant of Qiryat Arba', a 21-month suspended sentence 
because he took part in a disturbance in the course of which he 
attacked a policeman under aggravated circumstances. Qeysar was 
fined 12,000 shekels for the attack on the policeman. 
  Our police affairs correspondent Aviv Bushinsky reports that 
an Arab inhabitant of East Jerusalem was shot dead in a 
disturbance near Hebron five months ago, but the shooter was not 
caught.

  [Text] In a statement to the magazine AL-AMN [Security] on 
security in Lebanon and Israel's role in the recent crimes 
committed because of its failure to make the peace talks 
succeed, Interior Minister Bisharah Mirhij has blamed Israel for 
the stumbling of the Middle East peace talks. He noted that 
given Israel's social and political structure and the aggressive 
and expansionist theory dominating its institutions, Israel 
finds it difficult to continue the peace process and ensure the 
conditions and concessions necessary for its success. He said 
that Israel's failure to instigate a civil war among the 
Palestinians prompted it to commit the crime of the al-Ibrahimi 
Mosque and then to attempt to disturb security and foment 
sedition in Lebanon, particularly with the horrific crime in the 
Sayyidat al-Najat Church in Zuq Mikha'il. He pointed out that 
there is a clear link between the two crimes at the al-Ibrahimi 
Mosque and Sayyidat al-Najat Church, with the aim of avoiding 
peace. 
  On the goal behind the recent security incidents, Mirhij 
said 
the perpetrators sought to harm the economic and social 
situation in Lebanon and to play on sensitivities to aggravate 
the situation and foil the formula that the Lebanese people 
agreed upon in al-Ta'if. 
  Asked about explosives being placed in Ghidras and the 
Lebanese Army surrounding the area, Mirhij attributed the 
security and political focus on the Kasrawan area to the bombing 
of the Sayyidat al-Najat Church and the French cultural center, 
which took place in that area.

  [Text] Lebanon's Hezbollah has praised the 
martyrdom-seeking operations carried out on Wednesday [6 April] 
by a Palestinian in the town of 'Afula in northern Palestine, 
and expresses its full support for the continuation of such 
operations. 
  Issuing a statement in Beirut today, Lebanon's Hezbollah 
announced: The anti-Zionist struggle is the legitimate right of 
the Palestinian people toward the liberation of the holy lands 
of Palestine from the clutches of the Zionist regime. By 
carrying out their martyrdom-seeking operations, the Mojahedin 
are, in reality, defending the honor and dignity of the Islamic 
ummah. 
  The statement stresses the futility of the path of 
compromise 
with the Zionist regime and states: The people of Palestine will 
never succumb to the bullying of occupiers and compromisers.

  [Text] Beirut, April 8, IRNA -- Muslim alim, Allameh Seyyed 
Mohammad Husayn Fadlallah here today lambasted Clinton for 
having called on Yasir 'Arafat to condemn the recent operations 
of the Palestinian strugglers in 'Afula in northern Palestine. 
  Fadlallah who was delivering his sermons at Imam Reza Mosque 
in southern Beirut Friday said no one Zionist is innocent in the 
occupied Palestine since the mere fact of their presence on the 
occupied land is a criminal act. 
  He said the innocent side in the conflict are the Lebanese 
and the Palestinians who are targets of regular attacks of the 
Zionist soldiers. 
  Allameh Fadlallah also criticized the pope for describing 
the 
operations of the Palestinian strugglers as some sort of 
antagonism with non-Arabs, and called on him to support the 
Palestinians that are being killed daily by the Zionists and 
demand the Zionist regime to allow Palestinian refugees on their 
homeland. 
  He said Vatican's recognition of the Zionist regime is in 
fact an endorsement of the occupation of Palestinians lands by 
the Zionist regime.

<F P=106> [Statement by Information Minister Michel Samahah in Beirut </F>
-- live] 
  [Text] The cabinet held an extraordinary meeting chaired 
by the prime minister this evening. It discussed various media 
issues and approved the amendments to Legislative Decree 104 
dated 30 June 1977. I will read the basic amendments to this 
decree: 
  1. Concerning publications, the amendments cancel the 
administrative suspension of a publication on a basis of a 
decision by the information minister. They cancel the 
suspension of a publication by the attorney general or by a 
court decision before a final verdict is issued. They cancel 
the penalty of withdrawing the license or terminating the 
franchise regardless of the repetition of the crime and 
regardless of its nature. 
  2. Concerning the press, the amendments cancel the 
precautionary detention of journalists in all press crimes. 
They cancel the penalty of imprisonment for crimes not 
specified in the penal code. 
  Concerning the procedures of trials, the amendments cancel 
the judiciary's power to order precautionary detention 
regardless of the kind of crime. No measures will be taken to 
suspend a publication or a newspaper before a final court 
verdict is issued. The trial period will be shortened. The 
publication court must start a trial within three days and issue 
a judgment within a week from the date a case is referred to it. 
The appeals court must begin a trial within five days and issue 
a judgment within 10 days from the date an appeal is submitted 
to it. 
  Concerning penalties, the amendments adopt the same fines 
adopted by operating laws. They reduce those fines which exceed 
these limits. The amendments cancel the penalty of imprisonment 
for crimes unspecified in the penal code. 
  This concerns Legislative Decree 104. The National News 
Agency will release the verbatim text of the amended decree this 
evening. 
  The cabinet then discussed the news transmitted to Lebanon 
by 
satellite and picked up by satellite dishes. On the proposal of 
the information minister, the cabinet decided to make an 
exception: Until the issuance and application of the clauses of 
the law organizing radio and television media, it will allow 
local radio and television media services to re-transmit the 
newscasts and political programs of the following world media 
services: CNN, Super Channel, BBC, NBC, Sky News, Antenne 2, 
ITN, MBC, TFR, Euro News, Telefunken, and Dubai Television 
picked up by satellite dishes after the approval of the 
information minister within the framework of safeguarding the 
copyrights of the material transmitted. 
  The cabinet then discussed in depth the subject of radio and 
television media in accordance with all the proposals submitted 
to the ministerial committee and the cabinet. It gave the main 
directions for the options in this subject so that the committee 
can discuss all the options and possibilities within the 
framework of diversification and within the framework of 
constitutional principles, operating laws, and the nature of the 
Lebanese people. The cabinet took into consideration that the 
television and radio media law resembles in no way the 
publication law, either from a technical point of view, or in 
its options, or in its penalties. Consequently, the committee 
that will meet tomorrow will start on a new draft inspired by 
the diversification options that the cabinet instructed it to 
use this evening.

  [Text] Muhammad al-Ba'labakki, chairman of the Press 
Syndicate, and Milhim Karam, chairman of the Editors Syndicate, 
held an emergency meeting in the Editors Syndicate offices this 
morning. Afterward they issued a statement saying a battle has 
been imposed on the press, which they must fight to the end. 
They added that everything they had been told--assurances given 
to people working in the media and citizens everywhere that 
freedoms were secure--has been proven false. 
  The two media officials said that every Lebanese journalist 
and all those who want to maintain simple freedom of expression 
should mass on a broad front that includes Lebanese, Arab, and 
international organizations and individuals in a confrontation 
that might last for some time but that will inevitably end with 
victory for freedom of expression and the protection of 
democracy and public freedoms. 
  Chairmen al-Ba'labakki and Karam invited members of the 
boards of the two syndicates to a joint meeting to be held at 
1200 on 11 April at the Press Syndicate offices.

  [Text] Tehran, April 12, IRNA -- Iran's ambassador to 
Beirut Homayun 'Alizadeh and speaker of Lebanon's Supreme Shiite 
Council Shaykh Muhammad Mahdi Shams al-Din Monday discussed 
latest developments in the region, especially in Lebanon. The 
ambassador also submitted a message from Iran's Foreign Minister 
'Ali Akbar Velayati to the Lebanese parliamentarian. 
  In his message Velayati congratulated Shams al-Din on his 
appointment as the speaker of the Council. 
  After the meeting, the ambassador told the Lebanese 
television that Iran's stance on Arab-Israeli talks was 
inalterable and would not change. He added that the trend of 
regional developments had further proved the righteousness of 
Iran's stance towards the Middle East peace process.

  [Text] Islamabad, April 8 -- Foreign Minister Sardar Asif 
Ahmad Ali on Friday ruled out any compromise on Pakistan's 
supreme national interests and assured that all the decisions on 
the foreign front will be made in the light of national 
aspirations. 
  In a TV panel discussion Sardar Asif dealt at length with 
the 
entire spectrum of the foreign policy. 
  He said the American non-papers are not the official stand 
of 
the US administration. But during the on-going visit of US 
Assistant Secretary of State Strobe Talbott both sides will 
exchange their official stands on the irritants in Pakistan-US 
relations. 
  He said the US administration desires to bring its relations 
with Pakistan on the level witnessed by the past. However, 
there are some difficulties to achieve this objective and these 
impediments are due to the stand by the US Congress. But the US 
administration is trying hard to find some way out. 
  "We have got some proposals in this regard which will be 
discussed with Talbott and both sides will try to shorten their 
distance on their respective positions." 
  Foreign Minister clarified that the issue of F-16s is in no 
way linked with Pakistan's nuclear programme. 
  "We had signed a contract with USA for the delivery of 71 
F-16s fighter planes." 
  Reiterating Pakistan's stand on nuclear non-proliferation he 
said we are absolutely against the proliferation of nuclear arms 
in the region. Pakistan has offered many proposals like 
five-nations talks on the nuclear issue. 
  "But until and unless India comes out with same spirit 
nothing will happen unilaterally from Pakistan." 
  Sardar Asif said it is wrong to say that Pakistan failed to 
achieve its objectives at the UN Commission for Human Rights 
meeting in Geneva. 
  "The real objectives of the resolution were to reduce Indian 
repression in held Kashmir, to internationalise the Kashmir 
issue, focus world attention on the current Kashmir situation 
and to remove the iron curtain weaved by India around Kashmir." 
he explained. 
  He said sound ties with Islamic countries are still the 
major 
plank of Pakistan's foreign policy. Trade relations with them 
need further consolidation. 
  He rejected the impression that the present government has 
ignored the Central Asian Region for further diplomatic 
initiatives. 
  "Pakistan enjoys sound relations with these republics on all 
levels. The trouble in Afghanistan is the main hurdle to make 
further improvement but we we are not disappointed". 
  He hoped peace would return to Afghanistan this year. 
  He said Karakoram highway will be used for trade and railway 
track will also be laid down on the same route. 
  In Afghanistan, be said the main problem was to end the 
blockade of food supply to Kabul which was achieved by his two 
visits to Afghan capital.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Who Is the Minister Addressing?"] </F>
  [Text] "The major problems that our industries now face 
are, in order: the constant changes in policies, especially 
foreign exchange policies; delays in the approval of customs 
tariffs; shortages of foreign exchange and the bureaucracy in 
the field of foreign exchange; shortages of cash flow; a drop in 
the people's purchasing power; technological problems; 
profitability; and personnel." 
  You might think that the above remarks were made by a critic 
of the government's economic policies of the past five years or 
by one of the critical newspapers. But no! These remarks were 
made by a person who himself was involved from the very start in 
the implementation of the government's policies and continues to 
be in charge of one of the country's important industries 
ministries. But as you can see, he remarks as though he was not 
at all involved in affairs such as constant changes in policies, 
especially on foreign exchange, and so on. Of course, he stated 
other things in his remarks that we will study at a later date. 
  The important question that arises is: "Who is the minister 
addressing?" Is he addressing the people? Is he talking to the 
people who did not play any part in these affairs and were only 
witnesses of the results? Is he addressing the Majles? 
Obviously, the Majles approved the First Plan and approves the 
annual budgets. But it thus assigns the government to carry out 
its duties and places the responsibility for the implementation 
of such affairs on the shoulders of the statesmen. Is he 
addressing the cabinet and the statesmen? If so, is he not a 
member of this cabinet and has he not been involved in all these 
affairs? Why is he addressing anyone? What objective does he 
have by making such remarks? Is the president as the head of 
the government also one of his addressees and should he too be 
included among the people who have created problems by adopting 
and implementing such policies? 
  We think that in criticizing the government, nothing can be 
more effective than these remarks because had they been uttered 
by the newspapers or anyone who comments on the government's 
policies, first of all, they would be looking at matters from 
the outside. Secondly, they would easily be branded as 
"opponents of the government" and efforts would be made to 
discredit their criticisms. And thirdly, under the current 
sociopolitical conditions, criticisms by the press and other 
critics fall on deaf ears. But if they are uttered by someone 
who is inside the government, no one can doubt that his remarks 
are true, and the impact that his remarks will have will be 
greater than that of the newspapers and other individuals. 
  Does the esteemed president who accuses newspapers because 
of 
their criticisms of being "demagogic" or of trying to 
"disenchant" the people, cast a glance at his partners and 
listen to their remarks? Does he categorize these people too in 
the same way? It seems that some of the ministers who have been 
involved in these policies from the very outset and have been 
together with Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani from the very start are 
trying to portray that what they say has nothing to do with the 
president. Otherwise, there is no logical reason why a person 
who himself is involved in these affairs would speak as he does. 
  In conclusion, it should also be noted that the esteemed 
minister complained about a "reduction in the people's 
purchasing power." However, some time ago he strongly defended 
the increase in the prices of vehicles that are manufactured by 
a plant that falls under his ministry's jurisdiction, justifying 
this increase in prices by saying that the difference between 
the finished price and the market price would go to the 
country's treasury. Possibly this was aimed at increasing the 
cash flow of the government(!) or of the plant. Anyway, it is 
very difficult to make heads or tails out of his remarks!

  [Text] AL-MAJD has learned that Iraqi Deputy Prime 
Minister Tariq 'Aziz last week extended his visit to Jordan by 
24 hours so to meet with King Husayn at the latter's initiative. 
The unpublicized session lasted two hours. 
  According to well-informed sources, speaking to AL-MAJD, 
Tariq 'Aziz said at a private meeting with friends in the 
Jordanian capital that Baghdad had access to documents showing 
that Gulf Arab leaders lavish gifts and bribes on Western 
dilomats posted in their countries so that they write back to 
their capitals warning about Iraqi potential threats to and 
designs on the Gulf states and demanding that the sanctions be 
maintained. 
  Representations of Kurds in northern Iraq, according to 
'Aziz, have been visiting Baghdad recently to appeal to the 
Iraqi Government to move to rid them of practices by Kurdish 
militia chiefs, such as Mas'ud Barzani and Jalal Talabani. 
  The delegations stressed the Kurdish people's adherence to 
and support for the Iraqi leadership, according to 'Aziz. 
  Baghdad recently received numerous signals from Moscow that 
the Russian Government was willing to cooperate with Iraq and 
reinstate relations on solid foundations, 'Aziz said. 
  Moscow sent the message that it was anxious to see itself 
gradually break free from the grip of the United States and 
resume its status on the world stage as a superpower.

<F P=106> [Studio interview with Environment Minister Yosi Sarid by </F>
Shlomo Ganor on 8 April -- videorecorded in Hebrew with Arabic 
subtitles; processed from Hebrew] 
  [Text] [Ganor] Mr. Sarid, what kind of steps are called 
for in order to stop the wave of terrorist attacks and stabilize 
internal security? 
  [Sarid] First of all, it should be clear to all Israeli 
citizens that we do not need terrorist attacks to remind us to 
take all necessary steps. The Army, police, and Shin Bet 
constantly do everything in their power to prevent terrorist 
attacks. We have the best army, police, and security services. 
Even the best security forces, however, cannot prevent every 
terrorist attack from taking place. That is simply impossible. 
That is the case in Israel as well as all around the world. 
Nevertheless, the government is now taking additional steps. A 
total closure was imposed on the territories yesterday. If this 
closure requires bringing foreign workers to Israel then there 
will be no recourse but to adopt this idea. We do not like this 
option but we like terrorist attacks even less. 
  [Ganor] Despite all the efforts to persuade him, PLO 
Chairman Yasir 'Arafat has refused to condemn these terrorist 
attacks. What is your reaction to this? 
  [Sarid] I vehemently condemn his lack of condemnation. 
First, I think that 'Arafat is making a grievous mistake with 
regard to his own position. He will not be doing us any favors 
by issuing a condemnation. His condemnation will not bring the 
dead back to life. I think that he is making a mistake on his 
own part because any civilized person must condemn such a 
terrible and monstrous deed. I am very surprised that Yasir 
'Arafat does not understand this. The second reason is the fact 
that we are in the midst of a political process which is based, 
among other things, on trust. It is totally clear that if the 
level of trust drops, the political process will eventually 
suffer. 'Arafat should be more interested in the progress of 
the political process than any other party -- certainly more 
than us. 
  [Ganor] Do you join those, including several cabinet 
ministers, who are calling for a suspension of the talks with 
the Palestinians? 
  [Sarid] God forbid. I think that would be the worst 
possible mistake. That would be giving the most extreme people 
-- Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] in this case -- exactly 
what they want. If we were to do that, it would not be the 
government, the Knesset, or even the Israeli people themselves 
who would decide our fate but rather the last, accursed 
terrorist who would be ready to carry out a suicide mission. By 
granting this terrorist the power to stop the negotiations we 
would be entrusting our fate to him. That is a totally 
unacceptable prospect. 
  [Ganor] What were your impressions regarding the seriousness 
of the Palestinian negotiators from the last week of talks? 
  [Sarid] The past week was very disappointing. We received 
the impression that the negotiations were stuck and not making 
any progress. I can solemnly promise you that this impasse was 
not Israel's fault. Several things happened here: first of 
all, not all the Palestinian negotiating teams showed up. 
Second, we again received the impression that there were 
internal differences within the Palestinian camp and within the 
delegation itself that did not permit satisfactory progress. 
Even our attempts to transfer the beginnings of control on the 
ground were not implemented. Israel was prepared to permit the 
entry of an advance force of policemen in order to begin 
assuming responsibility and control. Even this was not 
implemented and I very much hope this will be possible next 
week. This was a disappointing week. I hope that the 
Palestinian negotiators will get their act together and that 
next week will prove better. 
  [Ganor] And if this does not prove to be the case, will you 
support a unilateral Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip? 
  [Sarid] Such a thing does not exist anywhere in the world. 
If there were such a possibility I would already have expressed 
my support for a unilateral withdrawal from the Gaza Strip a 
long time ago. There is no such thing as a unilateral 
arrangement. A unilateral arrangement would mean total anarchy 
and chaos in the Gaza Strip. If it were possible I would 
support it; however, there is no such option and we must 
continue the negotiations and pull out of the Gaza Strip over 
the next few days while continuing the protracted and difficult 
dialogue in order to eventually reach and sign an agreement. 
Once an agreement is signed we will be able to finally withdraw 
from the Gaza Strip, although, as you know, we are already in 
the midst of the withdrawal process. 
  [Ganor] This will not happen by 13 April? 
  [Sarid] This can no longer take place by 13 April. Once 
again, through no fault of Israel's. We are not to blame for 
the excessive delay. The delay stems from the inertia of the 
Palestinian side, whatever its reasons. I reiterate my hope 
that they will make renewed efforts next week and the 
negotiations will get back on track. Everything can be wrapped 
up by the end of this month. We can conclude the negotiations, 
wrap everything up, sign the agreement, and even implement it by 
the end of April.

  [Text] Beirut, April 11 (AFP)--Prime Minister Rafiq 
al-Hariri said Monday [11 April] he was unhappy that Pope John 
Paul II had decided to postpone his visit to Lebanon. 
  "I had hoped he would come on time," by the end of May, 
al-Hariri told AFP. 
  "I am not happy by the delay and I hope he will set a date 
as 
soon as possible for his visit to Lebanon," al-Hariri said. 
  The pontiff's visit to Lebanon would be "a very good thing 
for the Lebanese and the Christians in particular," al-Hariri 
added. 
  The papal nuncio in Lebanon Monsignor Pablo Puente told a 
news conference earlier Monday that the pope had decided to 
postpone a long-promised visit to Lebanon, which has been hit by 
recent bombings. 
  Puente did not say when the visit would take place. 
  A source close to the government said the visit was delayed 
because of a lack of progress in Arab-Israeli peace talks, a 
senior source close to the Lebanese government said on Monday. 
  The source, declining to be named told AFP that the pope, 
whose visit would have been the first by a pontiff to a Middle 
East country since 1964, hoped his Lebanon tour would "crown 
positive achievements in the peace process." 
  Faruq Abu-al-Lam', a former ambassador to France and 
supporter of renegade Christian General Michel 'Awn, said the 
postponement "clearly marked a disavowal of the (Lebanese) 
regime." 
  "He is not coming because of security reasons. They should 
stop telling us stories about the government's positive 
achievements to date," Abu-al-lam' told AFP. 
  The secretary general of the right-wing Christian Phalange 
Party Karim Paqraduni told AFP the pope's decision to postpone 
his visit to Lebanon was "regretable." 
  "It's a big disappointment for all Lebanese and a blow to 
Lebanon's image abroad."

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Dispute Between 'Udayy and Iraqi </F>
Transport Minister Over Agreement To Establish Company With 
Sudan"] 
  [Text] Amman, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- The establishment of a 
joint transport company between Iraq and Sudan is expected to 
lead to the removal of Iraqi Transport Minister Ahmad Murtada 
because of a dispute between the Minister and 'Udayy Saddam 
Husayn, son of the Iraqi president, over who should run land 
transport operations in this company. 
  Iraqi sources have said that 'Udayy attacked the transport 
minister for agreeing to sign a contract with an Iraqi merchant 
whom he described in the BABIL newspaper as "an opposition 
figure living abroad." He also attacked Transport Ministry 
Undersecretary Jamil Ibrahim, who was following up the 
contract's implementation in Amman last week. 
  The sources pointed out that 'Udayy had been hoping to win a 
contract to carry out the company's operations and use the land 
fleet he owns in carrying out all transport operations between 
Iraq and al-'Aqabah and vice versa. 
  Ahmad Murtada was appointed transport minister in the latest 
cabinet reshuffle some nine months ago. He belongs to the group 
loyal to Lieutenant General Husayn Kamil al-Majid, the Iraqi 
president's son-in-law. He also held in the past the post of 
director general of the Military Industrialization Organization. 
  As for Transport Ministry Undersecretary Jamil Ibrahim, he 
comes from the town of Tikrit. But he belongs to the Mukhlis 
family, a number of whose members were executed last year on 
charges of hatching a plot to topple the regime.

<F P=106> ["Standpoint" column: "Al Sa'ud Treason and Insolence!"] </F>
  [Text] Frankly, we were not surprised by the vindictiveness 
of the Saudi regime's foreign minister at the opening of the 
Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] foreign ministers meeting when he 
referred to Iraqi attempts to split the council. We were also 
not astonished by his insolence when he called on the council to 
bar these Iraqi attempts, which only exist in his sick mind! 
  Indeed, we were not surprised or astonished by this clear 
persistence in pursuing the course of treason and subservience 
to the foreigner, or by this rabid desire to harm the Iraqi 
people and maintain the unjust blockade on them. How could we be 
surprised or astonished when we know more than anyone else the 
immensity of the crimes and treasons the Al Sa'ud regime has 
committed against Iraq and the entire Arab nation, and when we 
know how anxious and frightened this regime is about the future. 
It fears the return of a powerful, unified Iraq to resume its 
responsible pan-Arab role in the Gulf area and the entire Arab 
arena. 
  It seems the Saudi regime, which has been exposed on the 
political, economic, financial, local, Arab, and international 
levels and whose non-patriotic and anti-Arab practices have 
become known, is not ashamed to persuade other Gulf states to 
follow its example by pursuing the same policies and stands, 
that is, to disavow all values and principles of common cause 
and destiny and to oppose the good efforts and endeavors to lift 
the blockade on Iraq! 
  This little Qaynuqa'i [reference to early Arabian Jewish 
tribe of Qaynuqa'], this grandson of Mordechai, forgets that if 
not for Iraq and the Iraqi people's brave stand on the eastern 
flank of the Arab homeland for eight continuous years to stem 
the yellow Khomeynite wind, and if not for their generous 
sacrifices, there would not be a Saudi regime today, nor the 
GCC, palaces, flags, or rulers. But what can one say to those 
who have lost every characteristic of manhood, honor, and 
loyalty? 
  Once again, we say we were not surprised or astonished 
because we know that a small agent and a servile slave can only 
be his master's voice, repeating the words of his overlords in 
Washington and Tel Aviv, expressing their wishes and interests 
first and foremost. 
  Besides, an agent cannot be the master of others. He cannot 
impose his wish and trusteeship on others. The Saudi regime is a 
servile follower of the United States and the West, so how can 
he impose its authority and hegemony on other Gulf states? How 
can it ask them to obey its orders when they do not trust it and 
feel uneasy about its acts and behavior? Has the Saudi regime 
forgotten that it has occupied the Qatari al-Khufus border post, 
and that it is still threatening the security and stability of 
some of the Gulf states? 
  If the Saudi regime has the right to establish all types of 
relations with the Zionist entity, receive the representatives 
of Jewish councils in the United States and elsewhere, and 
violate the laws of the Arab boycott of Israel, why shouldn't 
the Gulf states have the right to establish relations with Arab 
Iraq and lift the blockade on it, when they know Iraq and its 
honorable pan-Arab stands in defense of the security, dignity, 
and stability of the Arab Gulf states. 
  Indeed, we were not, and will not be, surprised by the 
behavior of the Saudi regime and the statements of its 
officials, who have burned their Arab bridges and persisted in 
humiliation and disgrace. They can only breath the air of 
treason and servile subservience. True, the lowly are easy to 
humiliate; in fact, they enjoy being humiliated!

  [Excerpts] Salim Salih Muhammad, member of the Yemeni 
Presidential Council and assistant secretary general of the 
Yemeni Socialist Party, has praised the distinguished Jordanian 
role aimed at reaching an appropriate formula to implement the 
Yemeni accord document which was signed in Amman last February. 
[passage omitted] 
  In an exclusive statement to AL-DUSTUR before leaving Amman 
yesterday, Salim Salih Muhammad said: We were informed that a 
high-level Jordanian political delegation has been formed and 
will be led by al-Sharif Zayd Bin-Shakir, chief of the Royal 
Court. The delegation is expected to leave for Yemen within the 
next few days to meet with the Yemeni leadership within the 
framework of the Jordanian role aimed at upgrading political 
dialogue. [passage omitted] 
  Commenting on recent reports that Saudi forces had entered 
Yemeni territories in the Sa'dah Governorate, Muhammad said that 
this did occur and that joint committees were formed to discuss 
bilateral border issues. This is in addition to a message which 
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih sent to King Fahd. He noted that 
all efforts are focused on solving these border problems as soon 
as possible. 
  On the Iranian role to solve the crisis, Muhammad said: The 
Iranian president last week received Yemeni Foreign Minister 
Muhammad Basindwah. We consider Iran a fraternal Islamic 
country and our relations with it are based on equality, mutual 
respect, and joint interests. According to Iranian 
confirmations, Iran is not biased toward any party in the Yemeni 
crisis. [passage omitted] 
  The member of the Yemeni Presidential Council explained: 
Yemen has a huge amount of weapons. This negates reports that 
some Yemeni parties are receiving weapons from outside. In this 
regard, he referred to the Yemeni interior minister's statement 
the day before yesterday that there are 50 million weapon pieces 
in Yemen; that is, four for every person. The member of the 
Presidential Council considered this a modest figure compared 
with the actual number of weapons in the hands of the Yemeni 
people. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by David Hirst: "The Father of Battles"] </F>
  [Text] Turkish Kurdistan -- Something seems to be happening 
to President Saddam Husayn. It was during his last speech for 
'Id al- Fitr, the feast which marks the end of Ramadan, that 
people really noticed it. "I have never seen him like this 
before", said a high ranking adviser of his, who recently 
defected to "liberated" Kurdistan and the Iraqi National 
Congress, the opposition alliance which has established itself 
there. 
  Saddam spoke, and looked, like a man near the end of his 
tether. The coarse features were bloated and haggard, his speech 
slurred and his gestures, always uncouth, now weary and slovenly 
too. His only topic was the UN sanctions, and the certainty 
that they would be renewed. Five times he slapped his thigh in 
unbecoming exasperation at the prospect. His ministers, as 
usual, sat reverently through this grim performance; but Iraqis 
watching it on television found it deeply revealing, and no one 
more than his former adviser. "I do believe", he said, "that 
before long he will do something crazy." 
  It is almost axiomatic among Iraqis that Saddam, the 
inveterate gambler, will eventually do something truly crazy; 
they cite his invasions of Iran in 1980 and Kuwait in 1991 as 
precedents for the climactic gamble to come, the one he will 
embark on when he feels that his end is nigh. 
  That feeling could come upon him any time. It has already 
come upon many Iraqis. For them, the fate which has befallen 
one of his hench men, Kamal Husayn al-Majid, is a metaphor for 
the whole system, for the retribution surely closing in on it. 
Kamal was the architect of Saddam's unconventional weapons 
programme. He is also a monstrous blasphemer. During the great 
Shiite Uprising of 1991, he led the army's assault on the holy 
city of Karbala. Addressing the shrine of Husayn, he said: 
"your name is Husayn, and so is mine. Let us see who is 
stronger now." He commanded his troops to open fire on this 
most sacred of Shiite sites. He visited Karbala again this 
month -- but in an ambulance and to beg the saint's forgiveness. 
He has a tumour on the brain. 
  The feeling that Saddam's whole system is doomed is rooted 
in 
more than signs or superstition. No one -- thanks to its 
awesome apparatus of repression -- has been able to destroy it 
from without, but, like its former minister of military 
industry, it is sickening, rotting, dying from within. 
  Indeed, if Saddam himself has yet to commit the final act of 
madness his people expect of him, a Kafkaesque insanity already 
fatally infects his system, which simply cannot cope with the 
sheer, accumulating weight of problems that beset it; it is 
going haywire under the strain. 
  At last the UN sanctions are biting. Nothing Saddam can do 
will stop the rot. This really set in last summer. Its chief 
yardstick is the value of the Iraqi dinar which in turn is the 
chief yardstick of Saddam's plummeting prestige. Officially, 
one dinar is still worth $3. But so weird are the workings of 
Saddam's economy that the only place where real banknotes remain 
in circulation is the place where his writ no longer runs, here 
in "liberated" Kurdistan. Last summer $1 fetched 20 dinars 
here; now it is 80 dinars. But in Saddam-controlled territory 
itself the rate is 350 "Saddam dinars" to the dollar, and 
falling fast. 
  He repeatedly slips into the despot's delusion that terror 
can control market forces. In 1992, long before the rot set in, 
he had already executed 42 merchants as a warning to others. It 
only made matters worse. The dead men even enjoyed a sort of 
posthumous rehabilitation; they were called "martyrs of an angry 
hour". Saddam's son Udayy, kingpin of the ruling family's 
immense business interests, tried other tactics. In January he 
put on what was supposed to be a confidence-raising show. He 
emptied all the coffers of one of his companies in front of its 
employees; they counted $50 million. It failed to impress the 
market. Two days later, the secret police tried their way; they 
shot two dealers and wounded 29. Then, with Saddam's latest 
speech, the dinar took its latest, greatest tumble. An order 
has gone out to the banks: nobody can with draw more than 2,500 
dinars -- $7 -- at a time. The situation is virtually out of 
control. Even Udayy's newspaper, Babel -- for he is an editor 
too -- admits it; within a few days, it said this week, the 
dinar would be down to 500 to the dollar. 
  Those who suffer most from the dinar's collapse are the 
great 
majority who do not in some way benefit from the system. They 
are kept from starvation by the basic rations on which Saddam 
manages to spend some $750 million a year -- most of the rest of 
his meagre export earnings, perhaps $1,250 million, going on 
illegally imported, hiqh-quality weaponry. The middle classes 
are being wiped out; garbage collectors are now deemed to fulfil 
a more important basic function than teachers, and are paid 
more. Some get by on dollars from relatives abroad. But others 
sell off furniture, carpets, fridges, even doors and window 
frames. 
  Impoverishment fuels a moral and social breakdown directly 
attributable to Saddam's misrule. Ten, 20 people now die every 
day in robberies with violence in what used to be a law-abiding 
society. Typically, the criminals come from the ranks of young 
men who were drafted into the army first to fight a murderous, 
but wholly pointless, eight-year war with Iran, then, two years 
later, the even more pointless Mother of Battles. They have 
lost their youth; demobilised without compensation, often 
without education or training, without jobs or the prospect of 
them, inured to the cruelty and harsh, survivalist lessons of 
war, they turn to violence of another kind. The law encourages 
them: in a bid to stem the contagion, Saddam has decreed that 
theft is a capital offence, so thieves kill, the better to 
ensure they are not caught. 
  The people openly grumble and curse him as they never did 
before. But more worrying for Saddam is the fact that the 
sanctions are now having a political and bureaucratic, not just 
an economic and social, impact. An extraordinary proportion of 
the population -- in the army, the police, the mukhabaraat 
(intelligence services), the Ba'th party -- are employed in the 
apparatus of control and repression. They are so numerous that 
the regime can no longer afford to raise them through better pay 
and perks, above the mass of the people. 
  So for most, economic gain now takes clear precedence over 
political loyalty. This is a cancer in the body politic, whose 
atrophied limbs are less and less responsive to commands from 
the centre. It is a great help to the opposition. "A year 
ago", said a visitor from Saddam territory "it could be 
dangerous to cross the lines. But now even wanted men, whose 
pictures have appeared in the newspapers, do not hesitate. With 
a few thousand Saddam dinars you can buy anyone. It is 
guaranteed." That is hardly surprising when one considers that 
the general who used to earn $10,000 a year is now on a hundred, 
and the wretched conscript on less than 10. A loaf of bread, 
never mind money, will buy him; his thrice-daily crust looks -- 
and tastes -- like sawdust. 
  Within this vast apparatus, Saddam has alway relied on three 
concentric circles of regional and sectarian solidarity: the 
country's traditionally dominant Sunni Muslim minority as a 
whole, people from his hometown of Takrit, and, at the top, the 
members of his own immediate family. But disaffection is 
manifest in all three spheres. 
  Of the four Sunni provinces of central Iraq -- Mosul, 
Takrit, 
Baghdad (now overwhelmingly Shiite) and Ramadi -- the last is 
pivotal. Extending from near Baghdad to the Syrian and 
Jordanian border, it has always been a stronghold of the type of 
pan-Arabist doctrines that spawned Baath, a principal provider 
of officers and bureaucrats. In the 1991 Uprising, Saddam, 
already dubious of its loyalty, made sure of it. "The 
mukhabaraat", said a Ramadi defector from that fearsome 
organisation, "themselves murdered Ramadis and brought their 
bodies to Ramadi city. The people were told that the Shiite 
rebels had killed them simply because they were Ramadis. They 
believed it. But now they know the truth." 
  Two weeks ago there was a football match between the local 
team and al-Zawraq from Baghdad, patronised by Arshad Yasin, a 
Saddam bodyguard and big businessman. After Ramadi scored two 
goals in the first half, Yassin ordered a change of referees. 
Al-Zawraq scored three goals in the second. The crowd 
protested. Yassin's men opened fire on it. Some were shot in 
the feet and legs. The riot spread to the town; they cursed 
Saddam. 
  The fact is that Saddam has incurred the secret enmity of 
virtually every clan and tribe in the central Sunni "triangle". 
One by one his his purges have afflicted them all, even those of 
Takrit itself. In the old days he used to treat the Takritis, 
mindful of his dependence on them, with greater restraint than 
the rest. No more. After the latest attempted coup, real or 
imagined, he executed 11 Takriti officers, as well as the son of 
the most revered figure in the town's modern history. One can 
imagine, when such things happen, what conflicts of emotions 
torment such high Takriti commanders as remain, particularly the 
one whose cousin, Omar Haza'a, the former mayor of Baghdad, had 
his tongue cut out for insulting Saddam's mother before being 
hacked to death with an axe. 
  Then there is the ruling family itself. In the end it may 
well be here, in the obscure, incestuous, microscopic universe 
of the Saddam ruling house, rather than in the more easily 
observable macrocosm of social, political and economic forces at 
work in the country at large, that Iraq's destiny will be 
decided. They must all hate him as much as they fear him, and 
the only thing that stays their hand is the knowledge that if he 
goes, they go with him. 
  Saddam has traditionally held himself aloof from family 
conflicts, playing one party against another. Yet there are 
indications that he now deeply distrusts the most infamous of 
the Majids, defence minister Ali Hassan al-Majid -- Chemical Ali 
to the Kurds -- and possibly even suspects that he was behind a 
recent assassination attempt. It looks as though the versatile 
young Udayy is now being groomed for the defence ministry in his 
place. 
  Saddam still clings to the hope that the sanctions will be 
lifted. At first he thought that might come about through the 
Clinton administration, which, initially at least, seemed less 
hostile than George Bush. He now seems to have despaired of 
Clinton -- but found new encouragement in signs of Russian, 
Chinese and French eagerness to do business with a rehabilitated 
Iraq. He has been unusually quiescent for 15 months, but, unless 
his slender hopes take more substantial form. he cannot remain 
quiescent for ever. 
  "He is not", said his former adviser, "the man to wait until 
the knife is on his very neck." Confronted with a growing 
peril, he believes in the pre-emptive strike, especially one 
that he can turn to strategic advantage; that was the impulse, 
heavily rooted in his paranoid view of the world, that drove him 
to invade both Iran and Kuwait. He thinks the western 
"conspiracy" is still going on, that he is still fighting the 
Mother of Battles in other forms. But this slow and wearisome 
"war of attrition" is one in which his whole position, his grip 
on his apparatus, is steadily eroding. On paper he may have 
rebuilt much of his army to as much as 80 per cent of its 
pre-Kuwait capability. But there must already be a serious risk 
that if he orders it to attack, its commanders -- known to be 
appalled at the prospect of yet another great debacle -- simply 
will not obey, or, if they do, that the demoralised troops will 
simply refuse to fight. So the impulse to act sooner rather 
than later, and with maximum surprise, must be growing very 
strong. 
  The question on everyone's mind is not whether but when 
Saddam, sensing the end, will "do something crazy". He is 
certainly in his terminal phase, but how long that will actually 
last depends mainly on one key factor. Will the West -- which 
so blatantly, and, it is now clear, so disastrously betrayed the 
great Uprising -- make amends by helping the Iraqi opposition, 
in a truly serious way, to bring the despot down? Will it do 
more than merely preserve the sanctions, which, however 
effective in the long run, cause the Iraqi people increasingly 
unjustifiable suffering in the meantime? 
  If, for example, the West declared al-Basrah a "safe haven" 
like the Kurdish north, the end would not only come more quickly 
but there would be less danger of this most strategic of Middle 
Eastern countries being plunged into the chaos and civil war 
which regional and international powers so greatly fear -- but 
which their current inertia and indifference is making more 
likely. 
  The question is also how. Saddam has two basic choices. The 
people of "liberated" Kurdistan fear they will be the primary 
target of the despot at bay. Both official rhetoric and new 
troop concentrations point strongly in that direction. In 
January Saddam all but announced he would be spending the 'Id 
al-Fitr in Kurdistan. Then, in addition to the three army corps 
permanently stationed on the front line, three divisions of the 
elite Republican Guards reinforced two others in the sensitive 
Kirkuk and Mosul areas. But despite this -- and other signs, 
like the arming of ostensibly loyalist Arab and Kurdish tribes, 
of preparation for battle -- nothing happened perhaps 
developments at the Security Council persuaded Saddam to call it 
off. 
  Yet the intent remains clear. Any attack on Kurdistan could 
take various forms -- terror bombardments the occupation of 
Suleimaniyah Province, the Kurds' only access, through Turkey or 
Syria, to the outside world -- but a purpose common to them all 
would be to tell the West committed to the Kurds' protection 
"Look, I am still here, I can still make plenty of trouble for 
you, and unless you accommodate me, I shall." 
  Saddam has also moved Republican Guards to the south. Why, 
no one quite knows. But it is certaunly southwards that his 
other option lies. "When the knife gets close" said the former 
adviser, "that is where he will strike. Occupying a piece of 
Kurdistan risks western reprisals, but offers no great strategic 
prize in return. Kuwait does offer it. The Gulf, with its 
oilfields and shipping, is where he has always felt his 
opportunities lie. He now hates the Saudis, champions of the 
continued sanctions. Vengeance is part of his Bedouin 
psychology. I think that, next time, he will do what he didn't 
do last time, both take Kuwait and send his tanks down to the 
Saudi oilfields." 
  That would surely be his end. For with western and Saudi 
aircraft in Dhahran, the tanks would never make it across the 
open desert. It would mean that the logic of Samson had finally 
taken possession of him. For he has never made much secret of 
it: if and when he goes down, he will take the world with him, 
or as much of it as he can.

<F P=106> [By Chief Editor Walid Abu-Zahr: "Secrets of Salzburg </F>
Meeting Between Qusayy Saddam Husayn and the Russian Mafia"] 
  [Text] As I sat waiting for an "important source" I had 
known for many years, my memory was hard pressed, recalling the 
latest events in Iraq. A telephone call from a mutual friend 
had me rushing to this Western capital. My friend said that Mr. 
X, the highly placed Western diplomat whom I had known as an 
expert on Iraq, and who had many connections in pre-Gulf war 
Baghdad and is still responsible for Iraqi affairs in his 
country, was on his way to this capital before returning home 
after attending both secret and open UN discussions on lifting 
the sanctions against Baghdad. 
  Now I am waiting for this "source" and whiling away the time 
by recalling the latest developments. Baghdad now seems to have 
lost hope that the international stand against it will be 
reevaluated. Two days ago, 'Udayy Saddam Husayn criticized Iraqi 
diplomacy, accusing it of failure in effecting a diplomatic 
breakthrough in the international embargo, and threatening to 
resort to other methods that had nothing to do with diplomacy. 
Saddam Husayn himself threatened and vowed to take revenge. 
Information is almost certain that Iraq is preparing to launch 
a comprehensive offensive in the north to reopen its strategic 
artery with Turkey. All these events, coming simultaneously, 
indicate that something different is being prepared. Therefore, 
the questions in my mind concentrated on Saddam's new 
calculations and the new plan behind his threats. I am certain 
that the satisfactory answer will come from this "friendly 
source," who I am waiting for in this Western capital after a 
previous appointment. As usual, I now record the verbatim 
dialogue that was conducted between us. 
  There was no time for many courtesies and greetings. So when 
the "friend" took his seat, the question of Iraq sprang to the 
lips and I began by asking him: Where has Iraq obtained such 
sudden strength to be brave enough and issue such threats? 
  And with the air of one who has a sensational story to 
relate, the "friend" began his answer: 
  "Snow was falling on this mountainous village near Salzburg, 
one of the most beautiful towns in Austria, famous for its 
annual music festival to commemorate its son, Mozart, when four 
elegant cars pulled up at the entrance to a chalet. Men of 
Middle Eastern features alighted. They drew the attention of 
the European tourists who did not give them much consideration 
since they are used to seeing tourists from all over the world. 
However, the Middle Eastern tourists were not tourists or 
ordinary visitors but Iraqi officials who came on a special and 
secret mission to hold an important meeting with other 
'tourists' who had arrived at the chalet from the former Soviet 
Union only minutes before the Iraqis." 
  The man went on and I did not interrupt: 
  "The meeting was not kept secret for long, however, because 
elements of the Austrian security forces, in addition to one 
representative of a West European and one representative of an 
East European security service concerned with the Middle East 
and with Iraq, were tasked with monitoring the movements of the 
Iraqi officials. These elements reached the meeting after 
monitoring the officials movements for two days, starting in 
Vienna. They were operating in accordance with information 
received in advance from Moscow and an Arab capital stating that 
a secret high-level Iraqi delegation would arrive, led by Qusayy 
Saddam Husayn, head of Saddam's special security apparatus and 
executor of special tasks, such as this Austrian one. 
  "Qusayy was the first official to enter the meeting place, 
preceded by his bodyguard. He was followed by Abu-Ahmad, one of 
the men in charge of external operations in the Iraqi 
intelligence service, and three high-ranking Iraqi Army officers 
who were participating in such political-military talks for the 
first time. They were graduates of Soviet military academies and 
had important connections in Moscow. Those recognized among the 
Russian team were certain veteran Russian politicians, former 
generals in the Soviet army, and leaders of the Russian mafia 
connected with certain military and political wings in the 
Kremlin. The Iraqi side was not eager to maintain secrecy 
because Baghdad wanted to exploit the appearance of its 
delegation in front of the intelligence services as message to 
scare the Western world." 
  My diplomat friend appeared confident that Iraq will 
witness serious developments in the coming weeks or months as a 
consequence of Saddam Husayn's threats. When I reminded him 
that the recent threat is not the first of its kind, that the 
Iraqi president has threatened the world with dire consequences 
several times in the past, only to retrack his threats and 
submit, the diplomat said: 
  "This time it is different. I believe you know Saddam Husayn 
better than I do. You no doubt recall that in the past, he used 
to ask one of his close associate to issue threats and to avoid 
committing himself to carrying them out, thus paving the way for 
a retreat. This time he initiated the threat. You will be 
convinced of the true dimensions of Saddam's threat if you allow 
me to reveal the secrets of the Salzburg meeting that took place 
two months ago, and the information acquired by prominent world 
security and political agencies on Iraq's secret movements." 
  I said that I would ask my questions later and he continued: 
  "Reliable security reports, some of which were submitted by 
participants in that meeting, emphasize that Qusayy Saddam 
Husayn was eager to go a long way in promoting Iraqi relations 
with the pro-Iraq Russian parties that have maintained relations 
with the Iraqi regime since the Soviet days of close military, 
security, and political cooperation. Those attending the 
meeting from the Russians generally represented the Iraqi lobby, 
which now has a great deal of weight in the Russian political 
and military arenas. These not only represent the Zhirinovskiy 
group, but a large spectrum of Russian military and political 
figures who yearn for the days of the Soviet empire and would 
like to restore their superpower status and influence, 
especially in the Third World and in the Arab world in 
particular. They are calling for a return to the region in a 
big way and for an end to submission to the United States, the 
only world superpower." 
  The diplomat paused for a while and added: 
  "Reports say that in his speech, Qusayy concentrated on this 
chord, which is so sensitive to his interlocutors, pointing out 
that the road to the return of Soviet influence to the world 
must pass through the Middle East. He said that the Arab 
region, which has suffered because of the absence of this 
superpower and its great ally, and the state of confusion among 
the Arabs now in view of the tottering peace process and U.S. 
arbitrariness and its extremist support for Israel, paves the 
way for Russia's return to the arena with the support of the 
Arab people who are seeking a means to avenge their wounded 
self-esteem. Qusayy said that Iraq continues to regard itself 
as an ally on which Russia could depend in its political 
comeback and in ending the U.S. hegemony, through Iraq's 
contribution toward solving Russia's economic crisis. If you 
help us lift the blockade, he said, we will be able to repay 
billions of dollars in debts and sign military contracts that 
will be the beginning of a powerful Russian breakthrough in the 
Arab world." 
  The diplomat added: 
  "The principle of restoring Iraqi-Russian cooperation did 
not 
take a long because the two sides were in agreement on this 
point and because it was not the main subject of discussion." 
  And what was the main subject? 
  "This meeting was preceded by several preparatory meetings. 
It had been agreed to hold the meeting to draw up a joint plan 
for action that would the focal point in the 'new course' 
[al-sabil al- jadid] Saddam Husayn talked about when he issued 
his threat to the world." 
  And what is the Russian mafia's role in the meeting? 
  "A big one. According to available security reports, the 
plan is very serious and has world-wide dimensions that require 
cooperation with the Russian mafia, which has wide-scale 
connections in the fields of terrorism, gun smuggling and drug 
running, and which is now connected with a world network 
specialized in terrorist operations in most world countries." 
  I said, obviously aghast, what is this serious plan then? 
  The diplomat answered, fully confident of himself and his 
information: 
  "Saddam Husayn has recently reconsidered all his 
calculations 
and made a serious decision based on the principle that the 
attack is the best means of defense. The man is now convinced 
that the efforts to corner him and keep him in isolation by 
continuing the embargo will ultimately lead to his political and 
popular suicide and that he will not be able to withstand this 
for many years. The world, and the United States in particular, 
treat him as if he does not exist and have established formulas 
for the region without taking him into account, except to weaken 
him further and further. While not working seriously to topple 
him, the United States is refusing to make any move to give him 
any future role. This has begun to tell on his future political 
and popular assets inside Iraq and in the Arab world, even among 
those who admired his challenge to the United States, Israel, 
and the West. Even these admirers have completely forsaken and 
forgotten Saddam Husayn. The man feels that he has truly been 
quarantined from the world for a long period of time and that he 
cannot take any more." 
  I said: But, what has changed for him to be able to 
confront this isolation while the internal popular indignation 
against him is increasing, and the political, economic, and 
military blockade gives him no room for maneuvering? 
  He said: "In his new calculations, Saddam Husayn believes 
that the regional and international stand toward him has 
changed, and that facts are no longer the same as those that 
existed during the invasion of Kuwait or directly after its 
liberation. He also believes that the international alliance, 
in its current form, is no longer as cohesive as it used to be. 
In his view, it is impossible to obtain an international 
consensus to deal military blows to him if he violates the UN 
Security Council resolutions, especially since this council has 
begun to suffer seriously from the policy of double standards 
and impotence, which becomes clear when dealing with Israel, and 
which became clear toward the Muslims in former Yugoslavia and 
in Somalia. We cannot deny that through economic and other 
temptations, Iraq succeeded in creating a rift among the UN 
Security Council's permanent member states. These member states 
were divided into two teams -- the United States and Britain on 
the one hand, and France, Russia, and China on the other. He 
wagered on the second team's support for lifting the blockade. 
However, the renewal of sanctions has forced him to resort to 
his plan to return to the arena strongly. This time, he aims at 
reshuffling the cards in this sensitive region at this sensitive 
stage, at disrupting stability, and fomenting disturbances and 
riots through a hellish internal, regional, and international 
plan." 
  Finally, we have arrived at the plan. 
  "Yes, and I am not revealing a secret if I say that several 
big powers are taking this plan very seriously, and fear that 
the implementation of this scenario has already begun on the 
internal level." 
  What will Saddam do this time? 
  "Information indicates that the Iraqi president's plan 
includes several parts, all aimed at creating an explosion in 
the current situation and creating new facts to force world 
states to give him some kind of a role. The first part is 
internal; Saddam will seek to once again raise the issue of the 
dangers of fragmenting and partitioning Iraq in order to make 
others recognize his role in safeguarding the country's unity, 
and to threaten the region's states with the dangers and 
repercussions of partitioning Iraq on them. Actually, Saddam 
has begun to mass his troops in the north to exacerbate the 
security situation with the Kurds. At the same time, he is 
preparing for similar operations in the south to defy the 
Western alliance and to put it face to face with a serious 
attempt to fragment it and to create difference among its 
members. In this regard, you can see the policy of flirtation 
which now exists between Turkey and Iraq. Turkey is counting on 
this to help it find a way out of the impasse of war with the 
Kurds. In return, Iraq relies on this to reinforce its 
penetration of the blockade and to pave the way for trade on a 
larger scale than what is currently taking place. In the 
Iraqis' opinion, Turkey and the Western states cannot ignore the 
Iraqi markets and their economic resources during this world 
crisis. Consequently, they should have a thousand apprehensions 
before adopting a new international stand toward Iraq." 
  What about the second part? 
  "The second part is aimed at the Gulf and the region. In 
addition to threatening the region with the dangers of 
partitioning Iraq, the regime in Baghdad will seek to foment 
disturbances on the border with Kuwait and in some Arab states. 
It seems that Saddam Husayn is aware of the sensitivity of the 
international stand toward him regarding the Kuwait issue. So, 
he will try to implement his plan with a new method in which the 
regime and its forces will have no role, and without any direct 
military threat. Information shows that the Iraqis intend to 
escalate the situation with Kuwait, one time by creating 
problems on the border with ordinary people, and another under 
the cover of smuggling drugs and alcohol, which will lead to 
armed clashes, or by carrying out bombing inside Kuwait, which 
will contribute to spreading horror, anxiety, and disturbances." 
  The diplomat continued to say: "You know very well that 
Iraq's interference in the serious conflict in Yemen is part of 
a scheme to cause tension in the region. However, Iraq will not 
stop at this point. Perhaps the more important card Saddam 
Husayn is trying to play, proceeding from his new international 
calculations, is that of foiling the peace process in the Middle 
East, which is going on without him. Information confirms that, 
after the failure of his secret contacts with the Americans and 
following progress he achieved in his contacts with the 
Russians, Saddam Husayn will try to use the foundering peace 
negotiations and the Arabs' increasing feeling that they are 
being deceived and humiliated by a hostile Israeli-American 
alliance that forces them to make concessions and remain silent 
over Israeli intransigence and repression to deliver the coup de 
grace to the peace process. 
  "Security sources indicate that Saddam Husayn recently 
reestablished contacts with Palestinian groups opposed to the 
peace accord and known for their support for the Iraqi regime 
and for their distinguished relations with it during their long 
stay in Iraq. He also opened up to Islamic fundamentalist 
groups that recently visited Baghdad, especially the Palestinian 
opposition groups. 
  "Furthermore, it has been learned that Palestinian leaders 
well known for their Iraqi links recently received the green 
light to visit certain Arab countries to hold contacts with 
Palestinian opposition factions and to coordinate stands with 
them to broaden the scope of pressure on the negotiations. 
These Palestinian leaders also formed plans to carry out armed 
operations inside and outside the occupied territories in order 
to destroy the peace process." 
  The diplomat went on to say: "What is more serious is that 
big security sources collected confirmed information indicating 
that Saddam Husayn decided to bring his confrontation to the 
point of threatening the world with terrorist operations and of 
delegating terrorist, extremist, fundamentalist, Palestinian, 
and international groups to plant bombs and explosives in Europe. 
  "Information confirms that plans were formulated to carry 
out 
operations against Israeli and non-Israeli targets in countries 
that still adopt stands hostile to Iraq and are waging a 
campaign of continuing sanctions against it." 
  I interjected by asking: Does Saddam Husayn have an 
international terrorist network to implement these operations? 
  He said: "All the information indicates that the Russian 
mafia attended a meeting in Salzburg to study capabilities for 
carrying out these operations. These capabilities are very big 
due to the current link between mafia smuggling and terrorist 
networks and also due to the relations among mafia leaders, 
intelligence elements, and security bodies from many East 
European countries, which had broad relations with international 
terrorism during the days of the communist bloc. 
  "I forgot to tell you that one day after the Salzburg 
meeting, Qusayy Saddam Husayn and an accompanying delegation 
went to Bulgaria and held secret meetings with Palestinian 
opposition leaders who chose asylum in that country. They had 
previously received military training there along with elements 
from (former) liberation and extreme left movements from all 
over the world under Russian experts. All of them maintained 
their old relations. Indeed, contacts resumed about a year ago 
and coordination was reestablished under former KGB officials." 
  He added: "We must not forget that Saddam Husayn previously 
won over Palestinian and international leaders known for 
terrorism. Many of them gathered in Baghdad during the Gulf 
crisis and were joined by numerous Islamic fundamentalists. 
You are well aware that the CIA accused Baghdad of the blast 
at the World Trade Center in New York and that one of the 
suspects escaped to Iraq and is still residing there." 
  I interrupted him once again and said: We can easily 
understand the Russian Mafia's role, but what exactly is the 
Russian role, and why did generals and politicians attend the 
Salzburg meeting? 
  He replied with a brief smile, and continued: 
  "Saddam Husayn does not want to repeat the experience of the 
Mother of Battles in his new plan, and he is concerned to avoid 
involvement in a suicidal project. He built his calculations on 
protecting his back by the important regional and international 
changes that, to him, seem to be in his favor and can be 
exploited. 
  "The most prominent of these changes, which in fact are mere 
ambiguous signs, is that Russia is looking for a way to return 
to the international arena and restore some of its past 
influence. What Qusayy offered the Russians who are enthusiastic 
about this theory was a deal with, and a service to Russia. In 
other words, the more the crisis worsens and the situation in 
the Arab world deteriorates to reach the point of explosion, the 
more the road becomes open for the Russians to emphasize the 
importance of their return as a balancing and stabilizing factor 
and mediator, if not a full partner that is able to play a role 
in safeguarding regional and international stability as the 
situation used to be during the days of the Soviet Union. There 
is nothing better than confusion and conflicts for Russia's 
return to the arena, especially when Yeltsin is surrounded by 
strong political and military opposition that pushes him in that 
direction." 
  I said: From what you say, it is understood that Saddam 
Husayn is now prepared to sabotage the region and the world to 
prove that he is still able to disrupt things and pose a threat 
to the stability of the region and the world order counting only 
on dividing the Western alliance and Russian support. However, 
nothing indicates that Russia, which is economically and 
politically ruined, and Yeltsin, who is threatened with being 
removed from office, and who is unable to feed his people, is 
able to carry the heritage of the Soviet Union. Don't you think 
that Saddam Husayn's new adventure is destined to failure and 
is, once again, based on miscalculations? 
  The diplomat quickly answered: "There should be a 
distinction between security information and political analysis. 
The Iraqi movements, activities, and plans I revealed to you 
are based on information from very reliable sources, and the 
evidence is that we have begun to see the beginning of 
implementing this plan on the ground. On the other hand, you 
have the right to ask about the seriousness of depending on 
Russia in its current situation and Saddam Husayn's 
miscalculations. In my view, the Iraqi president is still 
unable to grasp the utmost strategic importance the United 
States attaches to the region, and it is impossible for 
Washington to allow Russia to share it. The most that 
Washington can accept is Russia's restoration of its influence 
in the independent republics that formed the Soviet Union, and 
assuming the role of policeman in these republics. At present, 
Russia's utmost ambition is to impose its hegemony on that area 
in order to prevent the conflicts, confusion, and civil wars in 
these republics from spreading to Moscow, unless Yeltsin finds 
himself in Saddam Husayn's shoes and becomes in need of avoiding 
the problem through venting the pressure of his opponents. This 
can be done through exploiting distant crises. Nevertheless, I 
do not think that he has the capabilities to do so, and, in the 
first place, I do not think that Washington is prepared to 
relinquish the title of the world's sole superpower. 
  "As for the possibility of splitting the Western alliance, I 
fear that the Iraqi plan may contribute to the restoration of 
the alliance's integration because Iraq and the region are not 
Bosnia- Herzegovina and Somalia. The question is how far Saddam 
Husayn will go in his game of 'I am drowning, so why fear 
getting wet?' This is what the next weeks will reveal."

<F P=106> [Report by Hemi Shalev] </F>
  [Text] There is tension between Israel and the United 
States as a result of the United States' having supported Egypt 
yesterday in its demand that the handling of nuclear waste be 
put on the agenda of the multinational talks on environment 
issues being held in The Hague. 
  As a result of diplomatic contacts between Washington and 
Jerusalem and following a telephone conversation between Foreign 
Minister Shim'on Peres and U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher, the secretary agreed to modify the Egyptian demand 
and support a multinational discussion of issues relating only 
to regional legislation on handling nuclear waste. 
  Christopher accepted Israel's position that Egypt's charges 
that Israel is mishandling nuclear waste should be broached by 
the two countries on a bilateral level and not at the 
multinational talks. 
  The Egyptian demand is part of the very energetic campaign 
regarding Israel's nuclear ability which Egypt is waging at the 
multinational talks on armament issues as well. Two days ago, 
before The Hague talks started, the Egyptians warned they would 
boycott the talks if their demand to discuss nuclear waste is 
not accepted. They changed their mind only after the United 
States intervened. 
  Last night, Israeli sources expressed concern over the U.S. 
support -- partial though it may be -- for the Egyptian stand. 
  The sources said that ever since the new U.S. Administration 
came into power, there has been a constant threat of conflict 
between it and Israel in view of Washington's determined policy 
on nuclear nonproliferation. Because of the close U.S.-Israeli 
contacts, the issue has not come up yet.

<F P=106> [Report by Alon Pinkas and Bill Hutman] </F>
  [Excerpt] A total closure of the territories was imposed 
yesterday and is to last at least until after Independence Day. 
  At the same time, police launched an operation to locate any 
Arabs from the territories within the Green Line and escort them 
back to their homes. 
  Leaves have already been canceled for all police officers, 
and training courses closed, with participants being sent back 
into the field to beef up manpower. 
  The decision to impose the closure was made by Defense 
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin following recommendations from the IDF 
[Israel Defense Forces], the General Security Service, and the 
police. 
  The closure went into effect yesterday at 5 p.m. and 
included, without exception, the Gaza Strip, Judaea, and 
Samaria. Palestinians from the territories will be barred from 
entering Israel, including eastern Jerusalem. 
  Police Inspector-General Rafi Peled said the closure would 
remain in effect until the present wave of terror subsides, and 
then would only be lifted gradually. 
  "We are going to constantly check ourselves. If the 
situation deteriorates, we will continue (the closure). If 
things cool off, we will consider a gradual and controlled 
lifting of it," Peled said. 
  Last night, police conducted a nationwide search for 
Palestinians illegally residing in Israel, finding them, and 
then returning them to the territories. 
  "The country will be empty of Arabs from the territories," 
Peled said. 
  The IDF also imposed a "regional closure" on Janin, Tulkarm, 
and Qalqilyah, prohibiting residents from traveling beyond city 
limits. In addition, Hebron is still considered a closed 
military area. 
  Security sources have confirmed that a large Hamas [Islamic 
Resistance Movement] cell is active in Janin. They stressed 
that Hamas cells in Ramallah and Hebron were liquidated in the 
last two months, but that the Janin cell, to which the 'Afula 
terrorist apparently belonged, is still at large. "We are 
talking about no more than 12 activists who enjoy the 
population's support in some areas," they said. 
  Security sources said that the closure is, at this point, 
"indefinite," but Chief of General Staff Lt.-Gen. Ehud Baraq 
said it would last several days. Defense Ministry sources said 
the closure would continue at least until Independence Day.

<F P=106> [Article by Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu: "The </F>
Alternative Is Autonomy"] 
  [Text] Only fools and liars would now deny that the Rabin 
government's policy is leading to the establishment of a PLO 
state in Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza. 
  In Oslo, the government consented to set up Palestinian 
executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government. It 
agreed to withdraw the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] from all 
Arab-populated areas in the territories (and not just from Gaza 
and Jericho). It handed over to the PLO responsibility for 
security in all areas of withdrawal. 
  It is bringing the "Palestinian Liberation Army" (the 
so-called "police") into the territories, equipped with armored 
cars, helicopters, and machine guns, and introducing a 
multinational force to give this PLO army international cover. 
And it is letting the PLO fly its flag on the border with 
Jordan and in the heart of Jerusalem. 
  The real aim of all this is, clearly, not to create 
autonomy, 
but to establish a full-fledged state. What will be the results 
of this policy? 
  We have witnessed an unparalleled deterioration in security 
since the signing of the Oslo accords and the government's 
subsequent capitulation to PLO demands. Hardly a day passes 
without Jews being murdered, wounded or maimed on both sides of 
the "Green Line." On Wednesday, there was the horror of the 
massacre in 'Afula, and yesterday the shooting in Ashdod. 
Accompanying this renewed terrorism is a violent resurgence of 
the old-style intifadah, with rocks and fire-bombs being hurled 
in record numbers. 
  But heightened terror and violence does not cover the full 
extent of the threat to Israel posed by the government's 
policies. 
  For a PLO state in Judaea and Samaria will not be limited to 
the West Bank alone. It will be only a matter of time before 
such a state topples the Hashemite regime in Jordan and 
incorporates the East Bank into its realm as well. 
  Israel will then be confronting a Palestinian-Islamic state 
four times its size, one which will have assimilated the 
Jordanian army into its forces, and which will be forging 
military pacts with the PLO's allied regimes in Iran and Iraq. 
As rulers of this state, the PLO will open its gates to 
millions of Arabs who will claim the "right of return" not only 
to Judaea and Samaria, but to 'Akko, Yafo and Haifa. 
  The creation of a PLO state will inexorably lead to the 
formation of an emboldened Arab Eastern Front, stretching from 
Tehran to Israel's coastal plain. 
  Who can seriously argue that such a neighboring state 
portends peace for Israel? Indeed, 'Arafat isn't negotiating 
with Rabin over peace, but over the creation of a Palestinian 
state, which he says will constitute the first stage in the 
notorious "phased plan" to destroy Israel. 
  The alternative to the government's policy aims to save 
Israel from this kind of "peace." It consists of four main 
elements: 
  -- Israeli sovereign control of the area west of the Jordan 
River; 
  -- autonomy for the Arabs of Judaea, Samaria and Gaza; 
  -- exclusive IDF responsibility for security in the 
territories; 
  -- association with Jordan in the final settlement. 
  The gist of the difference between the Likud and the 
government is that we seek autonomy and not a state, while the 
government seeks statehood and not autonomy. 
  Autonomy, by definition, isn't sovereignty. It is an 
arrangement by which a national or religious minority can run 
its affairs with minimal interference from a central government, 
which retains such sovereign responsibilities as control of the 
borders, external and internal security, and foreign relations. 
Israel would thus continue to be the sovereign power, but it 
would enable the Arab population to conduct most areas of its 
communal life. 
  In a final settlement of Arab autonomy under Israeli 
sovereignty, the overwhelming majority of the West Bank's Arab 
residents who are currently Jordanian citizens should be able to 
retain that citizenship. A suitable but necessarily different 
arrangement would have to be negotiated for the Arabs of Gaza, 
since, unlike the West Bank Arabs, they possess no citizenship. 
  The idea of the Israeli left, that any minority unsatisfied 
with mere civic equality and demanding sovereignty should be 
given an independent state, is patently absurd. Were it widely 
accepted, Lithuania would have to grant an independent state to 
its Russian minority, Slovakia to its Hungarian minority, and so 
on, down the long list of countries which have unhappy 
minorities embedded within national majorities. 
  Further, if Israel applies this principle to the Arabs of 
the 
territories, why stop there? Why not apply it to the Arab 
minority living inside pre-1967 Israel, the Arabs of Galilee, 
for example? 
  Such an approach necessarily leads to the resurfacing of the 
1947 "Partition Plan," which the PLO says it will press from its 
West Bank state. Enshrining the idea that the demands of 
minorities for independence should be met is a surefire path to 
the dismantling of the Jewish state, and of many other states. 
  Not surprisingly, autonomous arrangements are increasingly 
being seen as the way to satisfy minorities' aspirations for 
greater freedom without smashing entire countries into tribal 
mini-states. 
  I am often asked: Would the Palestinian Arabs accept 
autonomy? My answer is that they would accept it if they knew 
Israel wouldn't give them an independent state. 
  This was precisely their understanding when they went to 
Madrid to negotiate peace with a Likud government. But today, 
they know there is no limit to what they can get from the supine 
government in Jerusalem. Thus they have no reason to demand 
anything less than independence. 
  When the Palestinians know there is a government in Israel 
that steadfastly refuses to establish a Palestinian state, they 
will agree to a compromise on autonomy. In such circumstances, 
important Arab parties preferring autonomy to statehood will 
undoubtedly emerge. 
  The present government in Jordan would certainly not want to 
see a PLO state that endangers its future. Equally, Syria and 
Saudi Arabia are likely to prefer the continuation of King 
Husayn's nonthreatening regime to a Palestinian state aligned 
with Baghdad or Tehran. 
  The Rabin government's mad rush to create a Palestinian 
state 
in Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza is reminiscent of the Carter 
administration's peculiar cooperation in the rise of the 
Khomeyni regime in Iran in 1979. Now as then, the results of 
such a precipitous policy would be devastating not only for 
Israel, but for the entire Middle East, and ultimately the 
entire world. 
  Autonomy under Israeli sovereignty is the only political 
alternative that can ward off the dangers inherent in the 
government's bogus "peace" plan. It offers hope for a genuine 
and durable peace between Israel and its neighbors.

  [Excerpt] "The war against terrorism will continue 
relentlessly, despite high hopes for change in Gaza, but it is 
important to stress that the total and indefinite closure of the 
territories could facilitate more incidents, said OC [Officer 
Commanding] Southern Command Maj.-Gen. Matan Vilna'i yesterday. 
  Vilna'i, speaking to reporters in Gaza, stressed the IDF 
[Israel Defense Forces] had successfully dealt with total 
closures of the Gaza Strip in the past, and is ready to do so 
now. 
  "The burden of a total closure on the Palestinian population 
is heavy, because they are economically dependent on employment 
in Israel, and they are closely tied to Israel," said Vilna'i. 
  Military sources in the Southern Command said there had been 
sharp increase in shooting attacks on the IDF in the Gaza Strip 
during the past three months. There were 78 shootings in the 
last three months, compared to a total of 40 for the whole of 
1992, they said, adding that 48 incidents occurred in March 
alone. 
  The sources estimated that with the establishment of 
Palestinian self-rule, local feuds and power struggles between 
Fatah and Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] are to be 
expected. [passage omitted] 
  [Writing on page A5 of Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ in Hebrew on 11 
April, political correspondent Aluf Ben says that in a briefing 
delivered at the 10 April cabinet meeting, "a senior Shin Bet 
figure reported that 58 Israelis have been killed and 270 
wounded since March 1993. The fatalities were made up of 43 
civilians and 15 security personnel. Twenty-four were killed 
inside the Green Line. In the previous closure months -- March 
through September 1993 -- three Israelis were killed inside the 
Green Line. Over 90 percent of the perpetrators of attacks were 
under the age of 24, and all the perpetrators of attacks inside 
Israel were single men."]

<F P=106> [Report by Alex Fishman] </F>
  [Text] Any forcible evacuation of Hebron Jews will involve 
bloodshed. This is a basic given the Army has been 
contemplating ever since conditions for implementing the Gaza 
and Jericho First agreement began maturing. After that 
agreement, the Jewish Hebron turning point is bound to arrive. 
  No one is preparing any military plans for such a move. 
Whenever the matter of security in Hebron is raised at the 
meetings of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee 
and at cabinet meetings, the chief of staff focuses on the 
astronomical numbers of troops deployed to protect a few hundred 
Jews living in the heart of Arab Hebron, but he says nothing 
else. 
  Political sensitivity is at its peak. The voices which 
emanated from the cabinet concerning the possible evacuation of 
Hebron after the Cave of the Patriarchs massacre were received 
in the Army with perfect clarity. The only two questions left 
are how and when. The second given is that when the Army 
receives the orders, it will carry them out. 
  When the Army is asked for its opinion on how to evacuate 
the 
Hebron Jews, it will present two options. The first: a 
one-swoop evacuation of all the 400 Jewish inhabitants, which 
may take several days. Such a move is liable to provoke 
bloodshed and leave deep social scars for generations to come. 
Nevertheless, such a one-stage evacuation is supposed to 
eliminate the undisputable center of friction, which is liable 
to deteriorate when the Palestinian police enter Hebron, 
enabling the political process to continue undisturbed. 
  The second way is a prolonged, gradual evacuation, which 
limits the possibilities of bloodshed. This option offers 
greater flexibility to select the politically appropriate time, 
permits greater elbowroom for a dialogue on a quiet, voluntary 
evacuation of most Jews, and may reduce the risk of trauma among 
the public and Army personnel. 
  This option has another advantage in that it conveys a 
message to the Palestinians concerning the evacuation of Jewish 
settlers during the interim period: Settlement evacuation is 
not a sweeping action; it is done case by case on merit, and 
Israel does not intend to renounce sites held sacred to Judaism. 
The disadvantage lies in the continued existence of this center 
of friction, albeit a reduced one. The Army can be expected to 
recommend the second option. In any event, any evacuation 
decision should be kept secret, thereby preventing the settlers 
from anticipating the event. 
  The Jewish quarters in the heart of Hebron are composed of 
four areas centered around the Old City market and casbah. Bet 
Hadassah and Bet Shneorson are one residential block. The 
central bus station and the Avraham Avinu installation form the 
second block. The central bus station building is inhabited by 
yeshiva students. 
  The third block is the Cave of the Patriarchs area, which 
abuts on a yeshiva and a settlers' restaurant. The restaurant, 
as well as the yeshiva, are slated to move to Bet Romano, which 
is being renovated. The fourth block, Tall al-Rumaythah, is 500 
meters away from the Jewish compound as the crow flies. It 
consists of a few campers in an Arab neighborhood situated on a 
site perceived as the ancient, historic Hebron. 
  The evacuation of two of the four blocks -- the yeshiva and 
Tall al-Rumaythah -- seems easier. The yeshiva is composed of 
students, youths who are not Hebron inhabitants. Next year, 
their parents can be expected to refuse to send them to a school 
situated in a permanently life-endangering district. The 
students live in the central bus station, daily commuting to and 
from the yeshiva -- a several-hundred-meter distance -- which 
requires an Army escort at all times. If the yeshiva is not 
artificially filled with students from Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza 
next year, it will probably either stop operating altogether or 
radically cut down its operations. 
  Tall al-Rumaythah is a different block requiring separate 
protection. Protecting settlers walking inside the city to the 
Cave of the Patriarchs and the Jewish zone is particularly 
problematic. Tall al-Rumaythah was the last site to be settled, 
and is the first one that should be evacuated. From all 
viewpoints -- both in terms of security and tradition -- there 
is justification to evacuate this block to the central Jewish 
location at the central bus station, in place of the yeshiva 
students currently housed there. The evacuation of the Tall 
al-Rumaythah settlers might satisfy the world and the 
Palestinians as a first step. 
  The problematic blocks are those located at Bet Hadassah, 
Bet 
Shneorson, and Bet Avraham Avinu. The Jewish population there 
utterly believes it has been chosen by God to live in Hebron. 
Some of them are willing to die for this belief. An immediate 
and forceful evacuation could lead to horrible sights such as a 
settler torching himself on a rooftop, or a settler opening fire 
on soldiers. Some of them actually believe that a confrontation 
with the Army is a necessary prelude to the messianic age. The 
IDF [Israel Defense Forces] is construed by them as an army of a 
secular entity, a sort of mercenary force which has a certain 
role to fulfill in the messianic saga. It is not an essential 
part of the local scene, and the fanatics among the settlers 
have no qualms about opening fire on such a mercenary force. 
  The halakic rulings of rabbis such as Goren, Shapira, and 
Li'or -- calling for a forceful opposition to evacuation -- 
strengthen the support for the not-so-large nucleus of fanatics. 
At the same time, the Hebron settlers have supporters in France 
and the United States. It is not inconceivable that such a group 
of supporters barricade itself in a Brooklyn house and threaten 
suicide. Such a situation would greatly embarrass the Israeli 
Government vis-a-vis other governments. 
  If the government opts for a one-swoop evacuation, it is 
preferable that the police and border police directly deal with 
the settlers. In such a case the Army will clamp a curfew on 
Hebron and a closure on Qiryat Arba', and will declare the 
entire Hebron district and the roads leading to it a closed 
military zone. The burden of enforcing these measures will fall 
on the regular infantry brigades, which will have to deal with 
the outer circle of settler supporters who will try to reach 
Hebron. Problems in the Army regarding willingness to implement 
the evacuation are expected only in the low ranks, and this can 
be dealt with beforehand by appropriate treatment at the company 
level. 
  Soldiers who will declare beforehand they do not intend to 
participate in the evacuation can be quietly left in base. 
There are not likely to be too many of them in any case. This 
is how the Army currently deals with the handful of soldiers -- 
mainly reservists -- who refuse to serve in the territories. 
  A prolonged, gradual evacuation -- which will start out with 
the evacuation of Tall al-Rumaythah and the yeshiva, to be 
followed approximately two years later by the evacuation of the 
other Jewish quarters -- offers the influential rabbis an 
opportunity to come to their senses and issue appropriate 
halakic rulings. The sane Jewish population will also 
understand that the historical period of Jewish settlement in 
Hebron is over. A period of two years will also provide ample 
opportunity for removing the dangerous and fanatical elements 
from the area. If the government therefore decides to evacuate 
the Jews of Hebron, it will probably opt for this second option.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Lessons of the Attack"] </F>
  [Text] The murderous attack in 'Afula will be remembered, 
first, and foremost, as an act of revenge for the Hebron 
massacre. The people killed in 'Afula are as much the victims of 
Dr. Baruch Goldstein as the Muslims praying at the Cave of the 
Patriarchs. 
  The attack is also a signal from Hamas [Islamic Resistance 
Movement] and the Islamic Jihad that the Oslo agreement has not 
solved the problem of terror. Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres 
was right in saying that this was a deed committed by people who 
want to murder the peace. 
  It is a pity that at such sad times, Likud leaders cannot 
rise above narrow political considerations. Bibi Netanyahu, who 
called for terminating the peace talks with the PLO in the wake 
of the attack in 'Afula, would probably be at a loss to explain 
why an attack designed to remonstrate against the talks with the 
PLO is a reason to stop the talks. 
  Yitzhaq Shamir said it has once again been proven that 
security exists only where the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] is. 
Should one infer from this statement that along with Jericho 
and Gaza, the IDF is also pulling out of 'Afula? 
  Moreover, were there no terror attacks during the Likud's 
term in office? And if the peace process were to stop, would 
the attacks also cease? That is utter nonsense. We mourn the 
death of innocent Jews, we share the pain of the wounded, and we 
are committed to tread the path we set out for ourselves and not 
the one that loathsome terrorists are trying to dictate to us.

<F P=106> [Report by Yosi Walter] </F>
  [Text] The fear sneaks in at the border crossing near 
Misgav 'Am. A kind of a chill that creeps to the chest and 
settles in the lower part of the stomach. The feeling has many 
names, which change shape in one's inflamed imagination: 
Hizballah, Sagger missiles, road-side charges, and car bombs. 
  A look at the faces of IDF [Israel Defense Forces] soldiers 
preparing to enter the security zone in southern Lebanon reveals 
that I am not alone in this. They, too, are nervous, they too 
are tense. The troops have been long waiting for an axis to 
open; their entry is made impossible by the heavy fog in the 
area. And the fog and dark are the best friends of the enemy, 
of Hizballah. 
  This name will accompany us during the long hours we will 
spend with IDF troops. Everyone knows what this fanatic 
organization is capable of. Moreover, it has been dictating new 
rules of the game in recent months, and a new term has entered 
the terror vocabulary of south Lebanon. They call it 
"counterfire." They attack IDF targets, mainly convoys, from a 
distance. This time they use Sagger missiles. That way the 
terrorists avoid direct contact with our troops while reaching 
the same, or even better, results. The counterfire has already 
claimed victims. And Hizballah's precision firing is improving 
as time goes on. 
  The force is preparing to enter. The objective is an IDF 
outpost near a Shiite village, and the question whether its 
residents are sympathetic to Israel sounds very irrelevant in 
this context. In the background, we listen to a transistor 
radio where Qol Yisra'el reports at length on yesterday's 
incident in which two IDF soldiers were killed a few kilometers 
east of the outpost as the crow flies. We enter the danger zone, 
and in the danger zone, everything changes: behavior, thinking, 
and talk. 
  An interim balance of terrorist activities in south Lebanon 
since the beginning of March: five instances of gunfire at IDF 
and SLA [South Lebanese Army] outposts; the discovery of six 
powerful explosive devices; an attack on an SLA unit, in which 
two terrorists were killed, one was wounded, and one was taken 
captive; an attack on civilian vehicles, in which four Lebanese 
civilians were killed, an SLA soldiers was killed, and another 
soldier was kidnaped; gunfire at an IDF convoy, no casualties; 
the killing of three terrorists on their way to an attack and 
hostage taking in Israel; and the last two incidents -- a 
powerful explosive device which killed two IDF soldiers and 
katyushas at western Galilee. 
  Brigadier General G., the sector commander, has lived with 
this data for many years. As an officer and a fighter who has 
accumulated thousands of Lebanon hours in various capacities in 
the area, he dismisses the matter as "that's life." And if 
there was no security zone, all this fire would have descended 
on the Galilee. The security zone is not the objective, it is a 
means for protecting the home front. For him, this means one 
thing: The Lebanon War is not over, it simply goes on in 
different ways everyday, every hour. And even though the events 
have diverted the limelights to Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza, to 
the Cave of the Patriarchs and Qiryat Arba', Lebanon has 
remained the same Lebanon, and a war is under way in the 
security zone in which IDF troops confront a determined, 
ruthless, fanatical, and uncompromising enemy whose methods are 
becoming increasingly more sophisticated, and as much as we 
dislike the thought, whose performance has been improving as 
well. 
  The fog disperses, and the soldiers are still there, 
bundled in their flak jackets, their helmets pushed low on their 
heads, their guns loaded, and their senses keen. After 
receiving brief instructions, they start moving. A finger on 
the trigger, eyes scanning each crevice, each wadi, each 
roadside stone. 
  G., the sector intelligence officer, is familiar with each 
curve and stone. Each place has its own story. Here, he says, 
is where an Islamic Jihad squad fired at a unit which was moving 
on the axis. Five soldiers were wounded. The Beaufort looms in 
the background. As in the past, it is still the source of 
serious trouble. Not long ago, terrorists fired Sagger missiles 
at an IDF convoy. Fortunately, they missed. And there have been 
infiltration attempts. This sector abuts on Misgav 'Am and 
Margaliyyot, both of which had been marked by terrorists as 
favorite targets. Since Operation Accountability, however, the 
terrorists moved their operations into the security zone. 
  The operation generated an odd understanding between Israel 
and Hizballah, namely that they can play with fire only inside 
the security zone. And that zone is Hizballah's home field. 
Hizballah personnel are intimately acquainted with the terrain, 
they enjoy the support of large sectors of the Lebanese 
population. They get their weapons and money from Iran, and 
they have learned how to work, too: They gather intelligence, 
keep observation posts, acquire experience in routine tasks, and 
hit where it hurts. The peace process and the new reality of 
the recent months have created a convenient ground for 
Hizballah's operations in that south Lebanon residents have 
become uncertain whether Israel would withdraw in the wake of 
the peace agreement. 
  The resident's confusion grew in the wake of the 
understanding between Israel and Syria and Hizballah at the 
conclusion of Operation Accountability. They felt that by 
tolerating terrorist activities in the security zone -- provided 
Hizballah refrain from attacking Israel's north -- Israel was 
disowning them. Because of this, cracks opened in Israel's hold 
on the local population. 
  The cracks have been filled by Hizballah. It has commands in 
villages, its fighters blend in with the population, and it uses 
these villages as launching pads for its operations. The 
availability of Saggers permits them long-distance operations. 
They concentrate in villages beyond the security zone, in an 
area which has been termed "the gray zone." From there, they 
fire and launch attacks on SLA outposts. 
  They direct their activities mainly against the SLA, 
attacking and trying to take outposts, firing at convoys, 
killing, and kidnapping. Population centers -- mainly Christian 
-- are another target for the terrorists' katyushas, mortars, 
and Saggers. 
  Hizballah makes an effort to abide by its understandings 
with 
Israel. Brig. Gen. G. says that when katyushas landed in the 
Galilee Panhandle about a month ago, the organization took the 
trouble to convey a message to the IDF that it had had no part 
in the event. 
  Yet their activity against Israel has been replaced by 
attacks in south Lebanon, which are dealt with a vengeance. 
  Brig. Gen. G. arrives at an IDF outpost to speak to 
soldiers and officers of a Golani Brigade company. In fact, he 
is here to check whether the soldiers are prepared for the 
activities awaiting them, are aware of their importance, and 
have adopted all the measures to protect themselves. "As you 
march forward," Brig. Gen. G. tells them, "look back at Misgav 
'Am and Margaliyot, and you will understand what you are 
defending." 
  These guys, however, need no instigation. They truly believe 
they are doing an important job. They have been in Lebanon 
before and have paid a heavy price. Seven of their colleagues 
were killed in a clash with terrorists a few months ago. The 
image of their dead friends haunt all of them whenever they go 
out on an operation. They know Hizballah well. Sergeant Menashe 
Rajwan, a veteran fighter, knows that they attack at dawn. To 
avoid surprises he wakens his soldiers early in the morning and 
urges them to take positions "so they are not caught with their 
pants down." 
  Activities in the outpost include patrols, lookouts, and 
other initiated operations that cannot be detailed. The young 
soldiers proudly bear this heavy load. According to them, their 
activities are not meant to totally prevent terrorist attacks, 
since absolute success does not exist, but their presence is 
definitely a deterrent. 
  "Every time we go out on patrol," says Menashe, "we look for 
mines, explosive charges, and terrorists about to attack us. 
Many dangers loom here. The bombs they plant can blow you to 
pieces." 
  Menashe, just like the rest of his colleagues, treats 
Hizballah with respect. As far as he is concerned, Hizballah is 
not just a gang of terrorists but a real army, well-trained and 
organized. "I fight soldiers, although it is easier to define 
them as terrorists. My mother thinks I fight kaffiyeh-clad men 
who shout Allahu Akbar [Allah Is Great]. That is not correct, 
they are soldiers. And it is my duty as a soldier to kill any 
soldier or terrorist who is my enemy," Menashe asserts. 
  A sign hangs in the room of the company commander, 
Lieutenant 
Ofeq Bukharis: "The Goal -- Security to the Northern 
Settlements." So that these settlements may enjoy security, says 
G., we must live here with insecurity and cope with a long 
series of threats. Ofeq has such a list, a list of terror. 
However, he trusts his soldiers and the IDF's firepower. As 
far as he is concerned, the terrorists are a threat that must be 
tackled but they do not threaten Israel's physical existence 
and, consequently, there is no sense in getting all worked up 
about them. "The sacrifice we made, seven of our 
soldiers-friends killed, is a pain we carry in our hearts. It 
follows us everywhere. However, it does not discourage the guys 
who do their work well and professionally." 
  We asked Ofeq whether he agrees with the chief of staff, who 
described the situation in south Lebanon as a war. Ofeq is used 
to being asked this question, and he promptly shoots back an 
answer: "In Lebanon, everything is quiet until something 
happens. It is a miniature war, a local war. When something 
happens there is a big to-do, but when it is all over calm 
prevails again." Nevertheless, Ofeq also knows that this calm 
is illusionary and that events in the field get the soldiers' 
adrenaline racing. 
  The talk stops abruptly when Ofeq is urgently summoned to 
the war room. Katyushas have just landed in the western 
Galilee. The company goes into high alert, and everybody takes 
positions. Radios click away. The sound of rifles being bolted 
can be heard in the lookout positions. Small talk and joking 
stop at once. Everybody tenses up. Menashe Rajwan tells us: "We 
are Israel's feet. Without the IDF in the security zone, Israel 
could not walk. The northern settlements would not live in peace 
and everybody's life would be disrupted. Although soldiers get 
killed, the bottom line is there have been no infiltrations into 
our territory for a long time and I know that I am doing an 
important job." 
  [Walter] "Did the loss of seven colleagues not affect the 
performance of the soldiers?" 
  [Rajwan] "We have all changed our perception since then. 
Guys who once itched to encounter terrorists no longer want it. 
They say they are afraid of losing friends. They do not fear 
what will happen to them. After all, everybody feel immortal. 
What they fear is what will happen to their friends, that they 
might lose them." 
  Activity in the outpost returns to normal after it turns out 
that the katyushas caused no damage. The guys persistently 
continue to ask when the supply convoy is due to arrive. All 
staples were removed from the kitchen in anticipation of 
Passover, and they are now waiting for kosher food. Meanwhile, 
G. gathers the soldiers and asks them to offer suggestions on 
what needs improvement. Reservists join the meeting. Most of 
them are married and have children and, as a result, fear plays 
a bigger role with them. They are afraid of mortar shells and 
katyushas falling on their living quarters and ask for 
additional protection. 
  The greatest fear is posed by the Sagger missiles. "We heard 
on the radio that two soldiers were killed, and that is 
frightening," Norberto Gruenstadt, a mechanical engineer from 
Karmi'el tells me. "It is scarier here at night. We are scared 
to go out, we are scared of Saggers and katyushas. The 
terrorists have learned to use Saggers, and they are extremely 
accurate. They see a light, aim, and shoot. What can we do? 
We dim the lights. We are careful and watch our step. Beyond 
that, we can only hope they will miss. To me, this is a new 
feeling. I have served in the territories so far, and the 
feeling there is different. However tough it may get, you are 
in control. Here, you just sit and wait." 
  Roni Merom from Haifa describes days of fear, as he puts it. 
He is mainly talking about rainy days, when everything is dark 
and the clouds seem to hang over one's head. "Vision is 
limited, you sit with a magazine in the barrel of your rifle and 
feel scared. On the other hand, I know that if there is an 
attack people will act properly. Although there is that 
certainty, you do not forget for a moment that you are in 
Lebanon, and Lebanon is not Gaza." 
  Meanwhile, the supply convoy arrives. At long last they 
will be able to get a hot meal. More than satisfying the 
immediate need to quash their hunger, the convoy brings the 
soldiers smells from home. They will most probably spend the 
Passover dinner in this outpost, and the sweet wine somehow 
brings their homes here. Amir Nisan from Petah Tiqva constantly 
thinks about home and about ways to calm his worried parents. 
Whenever an incident is reported on the radio, he rushes to 
phone home to assure his parents that he is all right. The 
families, he says, pay the highest price. They are consumed by 
worry. Many soldiers here cannot phone home, which kills their 
parents. I know guys who do not tell their parents where they 
are stationed. They say they are somewhere in Israel, and on 
their way home on leave they hide their flak jackets and steel 
helmets so that mom and dad will not find out their secret. 
  Things look different from there. When you are part of it, 
the business somehow looks less awful. The danger exists, but 
it is not all that tangible. The surrounding quiet gives you an 
artificial sense of security, and the knots you felt in your 
stomach on the way here gradually disappear. Something in this 
outpost and in the SLA outposts along the front lines gives you 
the feeling that the terrorists will not fail to penetrate this 
defense line. 
  However, the reality is that the SLA soldiers are the first 
to be hit by the fire. The guys call them the IDF's flak 
jacket. Indeed, the SLA is nothing more than a flak jacket. It 
can curb, but it cannot prevent attacks. Moreover, the guys 
know that the SLA was conceived as a necessary evil. Lebanese 
men join its ranks because it is clear to them that if they do 
not keep the terrorists away their lives will become 
intolerable. IDF commanders praise them, say that they do a 
good job. Nevertheless, they are just a flak jacket, not the 
chief weapon. The main factor is the IDF, which shoulders most 
of the responsibility. Without the IDF's backing, the SLA would 
not survive. 
  First Lieutenant Sha'ul, commander of a tank company, tells 
us the story of how he rushed to help SLA troops in the 
Shomriyot [placename as published] area when they were attacked 
by waves of Hizballah men. The SLA soldiers stood up to them 
like men, but they still needed the IDF's help. Sha'ul arrived 
and opened fire. Many terrorists were killed, and those who 
were not hit escaped. "Only here you feel that you are 
defending your country. When you see the lights of Misgav 'Am 
at night, you sense how important it is." 
  Brig. Gen. G. again gathers the soldiers for a final talk. 
He tells them about thousands of hikers who will be swarming 
the north during the Passover holiday, as if they did not know. 
"You are an excellent response to the threats," the senior 
officer praises them and wishes them a happy holiday. Here and 
now, in an outpost crisscrossed by communications canals, 
overlooking the horizon beyond which the terrorists are hiding, 
with the Beaufort Castle in the north and Misgav 'Am in the 
back, his blessing sounds very significant. 
  Commander of the Northern Command: 
<H5>  It Is A Fight, Not A War </H5>
  Major General Yitzhaq Mordekhay, commander of the Northern 
Command, rushed back and forth that day between the landing site 
of the katyushas and the funeral of a soldier who was killed in 
an incident in south Lebanon the previous day. The complexity 
of the activities and the intensity of the events take up almost 
his entire day. He works around the clock. Ever since he took 
the job, about three years ago, he has only taken four days 
leave. And even then he had no choice, he had to move to a new 
house. 
  He describes the situation in Lebanon as a "fight," not a 
war. A continuous fight that may never end. The IDF, he says, 
operates in a harsh terrain opposite terrorist organizations 
that will stop at nothing. This state of affairs gives the 
terrorists an edge over a regular army. The IDF -- and this is 
no secret -- has a hard time obtaining intelligence information 
about these organizations, but nevertheless it manages to impair 
and thwart a large part of their activities. This exacts its 
toll in blood. The price is painful and steep, but this is a 
reality that has been forced on us, Mordekhay says. 
  [Walter] "Do you hold Syria responsible for these 
activities?" 
  [Mordekhay] "There is no doubt that if the Syrians so 
wanted, they could significantly decrease the activities of 
Hizballah and the rejectionist organizations. The fact is that 
ever since the understandings attained in the wake of Operation 
Accountability there have hardly been any katyusha attacks on 
the Galilee." 
  Later in the evening, the general receives a report about an 
incident in which two IDF soldiers were wounded, presumably by 
our own soldiers. Units drill safety regulations every day but 
accidents happen, which are apparently part of the price such 
complex activities exact. 
  The general found some solace in a bar mitzvah party in 
Qiryat Shemona. A boy whose father was killed by a katyusha 
during Operation Accountability turned 13, and Gen. Mordekhay 
organized a party for him. The boy's family is poor, and the 
general took it under his wing. Although keeping in contact 
with the northern settlements is part of his duties, Gen. 
Mordekhay does not conceal the fact that this is one duty he 
loves very much.

<F P=106> [Report by Jose Rosenfeld] </F>
  [Excerpt] In a surprise decision yesterday, Jerusalem 
District Court Judge Miryam Na'or imposed prison sentences on 
three former senior banking officials convicted in the bank 
shares manipulation case. 
  Although State Prosecutor Moshe Lador had asked for prison 
sentences to be commuted to community service, Na'or imposed 
prison terms of eight months each on IDB Bankholding chairman 
Refa'el Recanati and Mordekhay Einhorn, former chief operations 
officer of Bank Le'umi. Eliyahu Kohen, then Discount's deputy 
chairman, received a six-month prison sentence. 
  Only Giyora Gazit, former managing director of Bank 
Hapo'alim, received a three-month prison sentence commuted to 
community service. 
  Aharon Me'ir, former managing director of Bank Mizrahi, and 
Udi Recanati, who headed Bank Discount's stock market operations 
at the time, were not given prison sentences. 
  Na'or imposed fines of NIS [new Israeli shekels] 600,000 
each 
on Refa'el Recanati, Einhorn and Me'ir. Gazit and Kohen each 
received a NIS 500,000 fine, while Udi Recanati was fined NIS 
400,000. 
  Hayim Buksbaum, the former head of Le'umi financial division 
and Dan Bavli, who audited Le'umi's books were each fined NIS 
109,000. Mizrahi's accountant, Dov Nave, was fined NIS 90,000. 
  Banks Hapo'alim, Le'umi, Discount, Mizrahi and IDB 
Bankholding were each fined NIS 1 million. Bank Discount has 
already set aside the NIS 1m. to pay the fine, according to last 
year's balance sheet. 
  Na'or noted in her 26-page decision that despite all of the 
mitigating circumstances that might have justified lighter 
sentences, the scope of the fraud and the economic damage it 
brought upon the banks, their shareholders and the state is so 
large that even after 10 years it is impossible to let the 
affair go by. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Cairo correspondent Shefi Gabay, Avino'am Bar- </F>
Yosef, Hemi Shalev, Gad Shimron, Yo'av Limor, Amir Gilat, and 
ITIM] 
  [Excerpt] Last night, we (a few Israeli journalists) asked 
PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat: "What is your reaction to the 
murderous attack perpetrated in Israel today?" 'Arafat bowed his 
head for a second. Suddenly he turned his back and walked out 
of the room without saying a word. 
  Senior sources in Jerusalem last night expressed serious 
disappointment with the PLO's feeble reactions to the terrorist 
attack in 'Afula and the fact that 'Arafat has not yet condemned 
it. 
  Arab sources close to Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] 
claim that 'Arafat relayed a positive message to Hamas in the 
wake of the attack. According to these sources, in a talk with 
various activists, the PLO leader voiced a certain measure of 
support for the attack but noted that due to the negotiations 
and the political situation, he could not say as much in public. 
The message was relayed to Ibrahim Ghawshah, the Hamas 
spokesman in Jordan, but was leaked in the process. 
  Nabil Sha'th, head of the Palestinian delegation to the 
peace 
talks with Israel, said that the lethal attack in 'Afula proves 
the need to sign the agreement soon. "This is one of the 
reasons we are pushing for the agreement to be signed: to put 
an end to the killings." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [By Yoshinori Fukushima] </F>
  [Text] Tunis, 9 April -- In a meeting with the United 
Nations' news gathering team for Middle Eastern affairs, PLO 
Chairman 'Arafat criticized the Rabin administration by saying 
that Israel is causing the delay in negotiations on the Israeli 
military withdrawal from the occupied territories (Gaza district 
and Jericho in the West Bank of the Jordan River). However, it 
seems he is trying to attract the attention of international 
society, including the United States, by complaining that 
postponement of the military withdrawal is linked to worsening 
of the situation in the occupied territories. The remark is 
also a sign of Chairman 'Arafat's irritation, as he wants to 
regain the occupied territories and establish his authority in a 
hurry through election of a tentative government because the 
Palestinians in the territories are increasingly becoming 
dissatisfied. 
  Following the invalidation of a deadline for starting the 
withdrawal, which was 13 December last year, it is becoming 
difficult for Israel to complete the military withdrawal even by 
13 April. 
  In the meeting, Chairman 'Arafat stressed: "The Palestinians 
in the occupied territories have not seen any concrete outcome 
(of the peace accord). Slaughters and violence are increasing. 
Not only that but also the people in Gaza district, where the 
living environment is very bad, are on the verge of starvation." 
However, the Palestinians in Jericho, where the support rate 
for the peace accord was high, are also feeling powerless and 
are beginning to doubt the possibility of realizing peace. 
Because of this, it seems the chairman made his remark while 
keeping in mind the Palestinians' dissatisfaction. 
  Palestinian leaders in the occupied territories are calling 
on the PLO leadership for administration of a democratic 
organization. 'Arafat, who was forced to make concessions to 
Israel during the previous negotiations on the military 
withdrawal, knows he is a target of the Palestinians' 
dissatisfaction. Therefore, he is pressed by the need to show a 
firm stance to Israel and the United States. The United States 
is critical of the fact that the PLO's statement failed to 
criticize the suicide bombing by "Hamas," the Islamic extremist 
organization, in Afula. 'Arafat clearly stated: "I gave 
instructions on how to write the statement." In this way, he 
showed his intention not to act the way the United States wants 
him to. 
  Noting the relationship between worsening public security 
and 
the delay in negotiations after the random shooting in Hebron, 
'Arafat said "a failure to realize peace will create confusion 
in the most important strategic area in the world." He then 
stressed the "responsibility of international society." 
However, it seems the chairman's intention is to break the 
deadlock by calling for intervention by the United States.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat by </F>
Annika Savill in Tunis; date not given] 
  [Text] Yasir 'Arafat returned from talks in Cairo this 
weekend threatening to withdraw from the peace process 
altogether if the Israelis did not stop what he called their 
manoeuvring". 
  The chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation said 
he 
was prepared to recommend a deadline for a Palestinian 
withdrawal from negotiations after Wednesday, the target date 
for Israel's withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho. "After 13 April, 
I have the right to call upon the Palestinian leadership to make 
the decision," he said at a meeting with journalists organised 
by the UN in his Tunis home. 
  Asked if he was really ready to pull out of the best 
prospect 
yet for his own return to Palestine, he said: "We are not 
puppets. They have to respect what had been agreed upon and 
signed." He said he had sent messages to the co-sponsors of the 
peace process -- the United States and Russia -- as well as to 
other permanent members of the UN Security Council and the 
European Union asking them to "start all their efforts for an 
accurate and honest implementation" of the Declaration of 
Principles signed at the White House last September. 
  Mr. 'Arafat appeared tired but confident in immaculate green 
battle fatigues as he received journalists at the, for him, 
exceptionally early hour of 8.30pm on Friday. He did not rage; 
in a display of relaxed showmanship, he insisted that he was not 
optimistic. "I am sorry to say, no. It's very difficult to say 
it, but I arrive with my back against the wall now," he 
declared, raising his hand against the backdrop of a huge 
photograph of Jerusalem's Dome of the Rock hanging behind his 
desk. 
  "I offered all the flexibility and effort but the other side 
is not responding. I left my team in Cairo under orders to 
continue but I do not know if the Israelis will come back to 
finalise or to manoeuvre," he said of the talks that reopen 
today. 
  Mr 'Arafat was particularly indignant about two things: The 
first, that a week after an agreement signed with Shimon Peres, 
Israel's Foreign Minister on 31 March, whereby Israel had agreed 
to be "guided by the target dates" in the declaration, Israel 
had issued a statement saying merely that the negotiations of 
Gaza and Jericho may be finalised by the end of this month. 
"May," said Mr 'Arafat. "We were preparing to send an advanced 
group of policemen two days ago but the Israelis refused, 
putting many excuses. 
  "But not only that," he added, getting to the bigger bone of 
contention. "They suspended our talks in Cairo because there 
was a commemoration of the Holocaust in Israel. Why did they 
not suspend the negotiation in the economic committee which is 
still continuing in Paris? What does this mean? 
  "I have the right to ask, is there one Israeli government or 
two? One government which accepts continuing in Paris, and 
another which accepts suspending in Cairo? 
  "They are not listening to me. They are not listening to 
anybody. This is the peace of the braves. We have to be 
courageous." 
  Time and again, Mr 'Arafat recalled the words of the Israeli 
Prime Minister, Yitzhak Rabin, last December -- "There are no 
sacred dates" -- implicitly contrasting that with the Israeli 
decision to leave the talks to attend a Holocaust memorial at 
home. "It is unbelievable, believe me, unbelievable." Even 
more so because Mr Peres had "accepted to return back the next 
day and to send a delegation, and then he gave me these 
statements of the delay. 
  "If it was the first manoeuvring, OK, we could let it pass. 
But there has been manoeuvring, manoeuvring, manoeuvring, 
manoeuvring. For how long? Not to forget: I was in Washington 
in September and nothing has been achieved on the ground. They 
are destroying the peace process by this manoeuvring. The whole 
credibility of the peace process has been lost." 
  Asked about calls within his ranks for a less autocratic 
style of leadership, Mr 'Arafat declared: "The PLO is one of 
the democratic oases in the Middle East." He could not resist a 
jibe at criticisms from salon Palestinians such as Edward Said 
the academic based in New York: "More democracy, yes, when we 
are in our own state. Not when we live in the United States, 
away from our people's daily needs." 
  Mr 'Arafat cautioned that further delays would lead to an 
escalation of extremist acts on both sides. On fundamentalism 
in general, he issued a covert warning to the US to learn from 
past mistakes: "This is part of what happened in Afghanistan. 
Do not forget how these fanatic groups were trained, armed and 
financed -- and here we are. It is not me who has done it. It 
is the American administration. They gave all kinds of support. 
Remember? So here we are-the shadow of what was done in 
Afghanistan." 
  This was also an oblique reference to allegations that the 
United States' ally, Saudi Arabia, is financing fundamentalist 
groups across the Middle East. "If there will be no peace, 
there will be complete confusion in this area, in thc most 
strategic area in the world -- confusion and Balkanisation." 
Asked when he thought he might be able to take up the reins in 
Jericho, he said: "I can't give you an answer because, as you 
see, I was supposed to be there since last December. But the 
Israelis have delayed the peace accord." 
  Both the West and extremists such as Hamas should take heed, 
however: "I am the leader of the Palestinian people, not of 
Fatah or Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement], or the Popular 
Front, or the Arab Front, or any other organisation. I am the 
leader of the Palestinian people according to three elections in 
the Palestine National Council." 
  At their Cairo meeting in December, Mr Rabin had promised to 
return within 10 days and had still not done so. Mr 'Arafat 
recalled the words of Egypt's President, Husni Mubarak: "Next 
time I will close one of these villas till the white smoke 
appears." Mr 'Afarat concluded: "It seems the Israelis do not 
want the white smoke to appear." 
  "It is my duty now to call upon the co-sponsors, the 
international community and the Security Council... to bear 
their responsibility and not to leave me alone."

<F P=106> [Article by Francois Soudan and Nabila Berrada Gouzi: </F>
"Morocco-Tunisia: the Contest"; fist six paragraphs are JEUNE 
AFRIQUE introduction] 
  [Text]Both countries are doing well. Comparing their 
respective economic and social performances is not easy, 
however. Too many analyses are still tinged with subjectivity or 
even passion. Here are the figures enabling one to decide the 
matter. 
  Probably because of the existence on both sides not 
only of a civil society that is self-assured and open to the 
outside world but also of a middle class whose cultural 
references are quite often identical, a traveler arriving from 
Sirius would presumably find more similarities than differences 
between Morocco and Tunisia. The political observer or 
"Maghrebologist," on the other hand, would see only dissonance 
between an age-old monarchy and a young republic: between a king 
rooted in tradition, land, and loyalty and a president born of 
the people and favoring the use of forceps to introduce 
modernity. 
  The truth of the comparison, which is neither that of 
the hurried tourist nor that of the gossip columnist in palace 
newspapers, lies halfway between Tunis and Rabat. Situated 
between them is Algiers, and the high-risk civil war being 
experienced by Algeria is forcing the two countries to act more 
and more like each other. In the rallying speeches heard both 
here and there, the Islamic danger and decay of the state have 
to some extent replaced the conflict in Western Sahara and the 
myth of the supreme fighter. 
  The responses to the threat are also similar: on both 
sides, a great deal more attention is being paid to traditional 
and religious values, and also on both sides, defense of the 
government rests with the Ministry of Interior and the 
police--not with the Army, as is the case in Algeria. And last, 
it can be seen that both sides are accelerating the process of 
social reconstruction and economic development in order to 
deprive the fundamentalist fish of waters in which to swim. 
  The comparative study whose results we are presenting 
here shows that in that latter respect, Tunisia is ahead of 
Morocco and, consequently, essentially less exposed than the 
kingdom to the risk of radical Islamism. That is no doubt a 
paradoxical result, considering that Morocco has not experienced 
an organized Islamist movement like that headed by Rached 
Ghannouchi. It is true that because of the secular tradition of 
the Tunisian political apparatus, Tunisian police were not 
prepared to understand the fundamentalist phenomenon and reduce 
its importance--although they have made up for lost ground since 
then--whereas the Moroccan Ministry of Interior has always 
recruited some of its staff from the schools of theology. But 
after five years of tension--from 1987 to 1992--Ben Ali's 
Tunisia is in the process of returning to its basic 
equilibriums. And the truth as revealed by figures argues in its 
favor. 
  Of course, comparisons are not always accurate. And it 
could be objected in Rabat that in areas as diverse as 
information and decentralization, Morocco is more open and more 
"modern" than Tunisia at the moment. All the same, the 
statistics speak. And only rarely do they correspond to 
generally accepted ideas. 
<H5>  Comparative Results in Two Countries Undergoing Change </H5>
<H5>  1. Strategy and Growth </H5>
  In the race for development, Morocco and Tunisia have been 
forced to adopt the same strategy: structural adjustment under 
the aegis of the IMF. The standard formula was applied in 
Morocco beginning in 1983 and in Tunisia beginning in 1986. It 
called for a smaller government deficit, less state involvement, 
the gradual deregulation of prices and credit, an opening up to 
world trade, the lifting of import restrictions, a "competitive" 
devaluation, current convertibility of the currency, and so on. 
Both countries are now acknowledged to be "good pupils" by the 
IMF and the World Bank. 
  The two Maghreb countries differ not only in area and 
population but also in wealth. Tunisia is one-fourth the size 
and has one-third the population of Morocco, but is 
proportionately richer, because its per capita income is some 70 
percent higher. 
  Morocco has always been more heavily in debt. Its foreign 
debt increased massively until the early 1980's, first because 
of the low level of domestic savings and later because of the 
increase in the cost of international credit. Its debt amounted 
to some 140 percent of gross national product (GNP) in 1985. For 
its part, Tunisia is generally thought of as a relatively 
well-behaved country: its foreign debt has never exceeded 75 
percent of GNP. Both countries are currently less indebted than 
they were five years ago. Morocco's debt of $21.5 billion at the 
end of 1992 amounts to nearly 78 percent of GNP, compared to 
$8.5 billion (55 percent of GNP) in Tunisia's case. 
  Stimulated by a wonderful agricultural harvest (even though 
two-thirds of its olive oil production has been put in storage 
for lack of markets), Tunisia experienced record growth of 8.6 
percent in 1992, but 1993 was a rather mediocre year--the latest 
estimates predict 3-percent growth. 
  Morocco's economic situation is clearly not that good. A 
recession made worse by drought hit the kingdom in 1992, and 
activity slowed by 3 percent. Despite the 21-percent drop in 
phosphate prices, the country resumed its growth in 1993 (an 
estimated 2 percent). As can be seen, Morocco's rapid expansion 
(and also that of Tunisia, although to a lesser degree) depends 
on agriculture. North-South Export, the French consulting firm 
specializing in risk assessment, emphasizes "the extraordinary 
vulnerability (worse than in India) to the whims of the 
barometer" and rainfall. Abundant rainfall in the autumn of 1993 
gives reason to hope, after two years of drought, that there 
will be a return to prosperity. The U.S. business bank J.P. 
Morgan is predicting 5-percent growth for Morocco and 6-percent 
growth for Tunisia in 1994.

<H5>  2. Industrialization and Exports </H5>
  Over the past decade, Morocco and Tunisia have made a good 
start on industrialization. But it has been mainly a matter of 
assembly operations--in the fields of textiles, automobiles, and 
electronics--producing little added value (the imported content 
remains high). Hence the persistence of trade deficits, 
estimated at 12.8 percent of GDP in Tunisia and 9.5 percent in 
Morocco in 1992. 
  In both countries, small domestic markets and low purchasing 
power are forcing industry to look abroad. Exports in 1992 
totaled $3.8 billion (Morocco) and $4.1 billion (Tunisia). This 
means that on a per capita basis, the Tunisians export three 
times as much. The European Union (EU)--mainly 
France--constitutes most of their market. It absorbs 63 percent 
of Moroccan sales and 68 percent of Tunisian sales. Between 1986 
and 1990, the increase in sales to the EU was due mainly to 
rising European demand, but also to a larger market share. "That 
obvious dependence is a handicap when things are not going well 
in Europe," says Agnes Chevallier, a Maghreb specialist at the 
Center for Prospective Studies and International Information 
(CEPII). The worldwide crisis, establishment of the single 
market, and the new competition from the East European countries 
and Asia have led to a marked slowdown in Maghreb exports this 
year. 
  And the problems are not over: the preferential treatment 
granted thus far by the EU is likely to be eroded after the 
signing of the GATT agreements, especially in the textile 
sector. Tunisia, in particular, is threatened because its wage 
costs are still higher than those of its competitors, especially 
Morocco. With its restricting social policy, which is not offset 
by high productivity, it can no longer claim to be a country 
with low labor costs. At the end of 1991, hourly wage costs in 
the textile industry totaled $2.80 in Tunisia, compared to $1.40 
in Morocco, $1.30 in Hungary, and $0.30 in China. 
  To overcome their dependence on Europe, the two Maghreb 
countries have tried to diversify their markets. At the end of 
1991, the UMA [Arab Maghreb Union] was absorbing less than 8 
percent of their exports. Morocco has been more successful in 
penetrating large markets such as the United States, which 
require large quantities. 
  The diversification of export products started earlier in 
Tunisia and is more advanced there than in Morocco. Partially 
processed raw materials are coming to constitute less and less 
of total exports. Over half of Tunisia's exports now consist of 
finished products (notably textiles and clothing), compared to 
less than one-third of Morocco's. 
  On top of slower European demand and fierce competition from 
Asia and East Europe, Morocco, and Tunisia are also having to 
face international competition in their own markets. With the 
opening of their borders to imports, trade balances have 
suffered in recent years. Under the combined effect of slower 
exports and soaring imports, the deficit in the Tunisian trade 
balance rose from $1.35 billion in 1991 to $2.4 billion in 1992. 
The rate at which imports are covered by exports (62 percent in 
1992) is at its lowest level since 1986. 
  Although Moroccan imports have been reduced, the rate of 
cover has grown worse, falling to 56 percent in 1992. The trade 
balance deficit grew from $2.4 billion to nearly $3 billion 
between 1991 and 1992. But a 40-percent increase in tourism 
earnings and an 8-percent increase in transfers from Moroccans 
residing abroad (totaling $2 billion) made it possible to 
contain the deficit in current operations. 
  Tunisia, which relies on mass tourism, receives more 
visitors, but when it comes to revenues, Morocco still holds 
first place. Tunisia recorded 24 million overnight stays in 1993 
and $1 billion in earnings, while Morocco earned nearly $1.2 
billion from 11 million overnight stays. The explanation for 
that difference is simple: not only has Morocco invested in more 
profitable up-market tourism, but international tour operators 
sell the "Tunisian product" more cheaply. The French firm New 
Frontiers is offering a week in April at a three-star hotel in 
Hammamet with full board for less than 3,000 French francs [Fr], 
compared to the same thing in Agadir for about Fr4,000. 
<H5>  3. Confidence and Foreign Investment </H5>
  Smaller budget deficits, a rise in the rate of savings, a 
lessening of the burden of foreign debt, an opening up to trade, 
and deregulation have led foreign investors to regain confidence 
in the two countries. Morocco's foreign exchange reserves in 
1992 totaled $3.7 billion, the equivalent of six months of 
imports compared to only five weeks of imports four years ago, 
while those in Tunisia totaled $927 million, the equivalent of 
less than two months of imports. 
  And that is not all: since the Gulf War, foreign direct 
investments have been returning. They amounted to close to $200 
million in Tunisia in 1992 (compared to $80 million in 1990). 
Morocco, thanks especially to its diplomacy and the appeal of 
its domestic market, does much better in terms of volume. in 
1992, foreign manna passed the $500 million mark (compared to 
$165 million in 1990). But in terms of population, Morocco's 
performance ($20 per capita) is below that of Tunisia ($23.50). 
  "The profitability of an industrial investment is comparable 
in the two Maghreb countries," says Jean-Pierre Prouteau, 
president of the CEPIA (Center for Industrial Promotion in 
Africa), "but Tunisia is still the champion when it comes to 
attracting foreign PME [small- and medium-size businesses] to 
its territory." Between 1990 and 1992, no fewer than 60 
medium-sized factories were established there every year. And 
while the flow of capital weakened in 1993, the reason was that 
investors were awaiting the new investment code, which was 
promulgated last December. The Tunisian Investment Promotion 
Agency (API) is represented in all the Western capitals and 
welcomes foreign investment on the spot. French-Moroccan 
partnership programs, on the other hand, have been suspended 
since 1990. There are several reasons for this: tensions between 
Moroccan authorities and the former French Socialist government, 
the reorganization of the Industrial Development Office (ODI), 
which has been under way for three years, and a lack of interest 
by the CGEM [Moroccan General Economic Federation]--the Moroccan 
employers association--in PME and small business. The result, as 
Jean-Pierre Prouteau goes on to say, is that "if a manufacturer 
wants to set up a business in the Maghreb, the French employers 
association directs him to Tunisia, where the reception 
facilities are operational. If an investor chooses Morocco, he 
can rely only on his own personal contacts." 
  Are foreign investors interested only in export activities? 
No, says one of the Maghreb representatives of the Swedish food 
packaging firm Tetra Pak, which operates in partnership with 
local manufacturers in both countries. "The main objective of 
our investments in Morocco is to satisfy domestic demand, 
whereas in Tunisia, most of our production is for export." The 
main concerns, then, are these: "In the case of Morocco, to be 
sure of getting paid within a reasonable amount of time, and in 
the case of Tunisia, to find foreign markets." 
<H5>  4. Progress and Standard of Living </H5>
  In Morocco, structural progress is not really being 
reflected 
in a higher standard of living. Growth is still inadequate: 
population growth of 2.7 percent per year cancels out growth in 
the GDP by just that much. Social inequalities, which cause 
unrest and are therefore feared by foreign investors, are 
obvious. According to the UNDP [UN Development Program], 7.9 
million Moroccans--some 30 percent of the population--still live 
below the poverty line. The rise in consumer prices has been 
halted, but the minimum wage totals barely 1,400 dirhams (about 
850 French francs), whereas the rent on a modest three-room 
apartment in Casablanca easily exceeds 2,500 dirhams (about 
Fr1,500). 
  The population problem is less serious in Tunisia, where 
birth control has been effective and where population growth has 
been reduced to 2 percent per year. This means that at the same 
rate of economic growth, per capita income in Tunisia rises more 
quickly than in Morocco. In addition, social inequalities are 
much less pronounced in Tunisia, although they are tending to 
reappear. According to the UNDP, 1.4 million Tunisians--16 
percent of the population--now live below the poverty line, 
compared to 73 percent just after independence. A genuine middle 
class has appeared. Although the minimum wage is equivalent, 
"the average income level and purchasing power are markedly 
higher than in Morocco," says Agnes Chevallier. 
  According to a survey by the UNDP and the World Bank, the 
average standard of living in both countries has continued to 
rise during the years of adjustment, and progress in education, 
health, and housing has continued. Between 1975 and 1985, 
Morocco invested 6 percent of its GNP in education annually, and 
the figure since 1988 has been 7.4 percent. Much remains to be 
done, however: less than half of all Moroccans are literate, 
whereas over 40 percent of the population is under 15 years of 
age. Only two-thirds of the children are in school, and in the 
rural areas--which account for 51 percent of the total 
population--the rate of primary school attendance is even lower. 
Between 1975 and 1985, Tunisia devoted as much as 7.5 percent of 
its GNP to education annually. Since 1988 the figure has been 6 
percent. The results reflect the effort made: the rate of 
illiteracy has been reduced to 35 percent. All children attend 
primary school, whether they live in towns or in the rural areas 
(46 percent of the population). In both countries, far more than 
half the adolescents drop out of school before obtaining their 
baccalaureat, and 10 percent at most obtain a university degree. 
  In the field of health as well, Tunisia boasts results much 
better than those in Morocco: life expectancy of 69 years, an 
infant mortality rate of 44 per 1,000, and one physician for 
every 2,160 inhabitants. In Morocco, life expectancy is about 63 
years, infant mortality stands at about 57 per 1,000, and there 
is only one physician for every 4,760 inhabitants. Government 
spending on health as a percentage of GNP is higher in Morocco, 
but the kingdom is so far behind that access to health services 
is still unavailable to the majority of the population. 
  In the case of equipment, Moroccans are no worse off than 
Tunisians: one automobile for every 40 inhabitants in Morocco 
and for every 44 in Tunisia and one television set for every 15 
in Morocco (14 in Tunisia). Even better, and still according to 
the UNDP, is the fact that 73 percent of Moroccans have a supply 
of drinking water, compared to only 65 percent of Tunisians. On 
the other hand, telephones are still a luxury in Morocco, where 
there is one for every 65 inhabitants, compared to one for every 
24 in Tunisia. 
  Overall, Morocco's human development indicator (HDI)--which 
combines statistics on real purchasing power, education, and 
health--is much lower than one would expect from studying its 
economic performance. In the worldwide ranking published by the 
UNDP in 1993, Morocco is classed among the countries with poor 
human development, ranking 119th (out of 179 countries) in terms 
of HDI and 106th in terms of GNP, leaving a "negative" gap of 
13. To put it briefly, the kingdom's economic policy has been 
far more effective than its social policy. Tunisia, on the other 
hand, is classed among the countries with average human 
development, being ranked 93d in terms of HDI and 88th in terms 
of GNP, giving it a "negative" gap of only 5. 
<H5>  5. Outlook </H5>
  It is readily admitted that Morocco's economic potential is 
markedly better than Tunisia's, but that the latter seems much 
better equipped today for the race for development. Baccar 
Touzani, secretary general of the French-Arab Chamber of 
Commerce in Paris, explains the gap between the two countries as 
being due to education. "Illiteracy in Tunisia affects only 
people over 60 years of age, whereas in Morocco it touches all 
age groups. After independence, President Bourguiba assigned 
priority to education and health. That decision to pursue human 
development has paid off and is now being reflected in economic 
development." Is Tunisia being managed better than Morocco? 
"Perhaps. In proportion to population, it has more trained 
men--more cadres." 
  According to one Moroccan diplomat, Tunisia's lead dates 
back 
not to Bourguiba but to the French presence. "Tunisia was made a 
protectorate in 1881--30 years before Morocco. It therefore had 
access to modernity, public education, and health long before 
Morocco did." 
  In Agnes Chevallier's opinion, "it was petroleum that 
enabled 
the Tunisian economy to take off in the 1970's and led to the 
gap in per capita incomes between the two countries. While their 
industrial sectors are comparable today, the difference involves 
the relative importance of their archaic sectors--handicrafts, 
traditional agriculture, and the informal sector--which are much 
more important in Morocco. The kingdom is a country moving at 
several different speeds, while Tunisia is relatively 
homogeneous." 
  Another explanation is that military expenditures by 
Morocco, 
which is faced with the Saharan conflict and tensions with 
Algeria, have become higher than those by Tunisia, which has 
experienced only brief periods of tension with Libya. Military 
spending accounted for 2 percent of Moroccan GDP and 2.2 percent 
of Tunisian GDP in 1960, compared to 4.5 percent and 3.3 
percent, respectively, in 1990. The increase in military 
spending compared to expenditures for health and education 
combined reflects a recent adjustment in Tunisia: 58 percent in 
1990, compared to 35 percent in 1977. When President Ben Ali 
came to power, the human development strategy had borne fruit, 
whereas the military apparatus was still underdeveloped. Since 
1987, social spending has been reduced and attention focused on 
an autonomous defense policy to ensure the country's domestic 
and foreign security. In Morocco, on the other hand, the rate of 
military spending compared to spending on health and education 
fell from 88 percent in 1977 to 52 percent in 1990: military 
expenditures have not been reduced in absolute terms, but the 
social sector has become a priority. 
  A Tunisian economist qualifies the assessment of Tunisia's 
notable lead by saying: "It is better equipped than Morocco only 
in a certain sense. Its industrial fabric is more diversified 
and is locally more integrated. Working conditions are better, 
compliance with legislation is better, the unions are better 
adapted, and the bureaucracy is less burdensome. Morocco has 
advantages that are just as important. It is in a much better 
position in the international market: it projects a good image 
abroad. Moroccan investments abroad are much more sizable than 
Tunisia's. The kingdom's businessmen are freer, more dynamic, 
and less encumbered by domestic political constraints." 
  A study published by Paribas Bank in its magazine 
CONJONCTURE 
in November 1993 shows just how far the two countries have come: 
"The economic future of Tunisia and Morocco is certainly 
promising. Real progress has been made. A certain fragility 
remains. It is still too early to see these countries as the 
dragons of tomorrow." Morocco and Tunisia will have to meet 
several challenges in order to join the 21st century. The first 
is unemployment, which, depending on the source, affects from 15 
to 20 percent of their active populations and is not yet covered 
by unemployment compensation systems. According to North-South 
Export, "growth is creating only one-third the number of jobs 
required by Moroccan demographics." Even more serious, drought 
has accelerated the rural exodus and, therefore, the 
overpopulation of shantytowns. Another challenge is the 
negotiation of agreements on free trade and assistance with the 
EU. Many experts say that the future of the Maghreb is Europe.

  [Text] An official spokesman has stated the following: 
  The Iraqi intelligence services have acquired documented and 
serious information regarding the incident of the explosion at 
the World Trade Center in New York. 
  This information raises many suspicions about the parties 
that took part in or were behind the incident. 
  The competent Iraqi authorities are willing to cooperate 
with 
the United States to learn the facts as they exist. We hope 
that the U.S. side that handles this will be impartial. It is 
preferable that this should be done with the knowledge of the 
U.S. Congress or under its supervision.

  [Text] Baghdad, 12 Apr (INA) -- Tariq 'Aziz, official in 
charge of the Foreign Relations Bureau of the Arab Socialist 
Ba'th Party, today received Naji 'Allush, secretary general of 
the Arab Popular Liberation Movement. 
  Tariq 'Aziz stressed Iraq's adherence to pan-Arab principles 
and convictions. He said the steadfastness of the Iraqis has 
foiled all of the wagers of hostile powers. These powers sought 
to undermine Iraq and harm its people through their aggression, 
plots, and unjust blockade. 'Aziz added: We are confident that 
the next stage will be in the interest of nationalist and 
pan-Arab forces in the region. 
  Naji 'Allush paid tribute to the steadfastness and position 
of the Iraqis in the face of the aggression and the crime of the 
blockade. He asserted that Iraq is the hope of the Arab nation, 
the base of steadfastness, and a symbol of awakening and 
progress. 
  The meeting was attended by comrade Sa'd Qasim Hammudi, 
member of the Foreign Relations Bureau and secretary general of 
the Arab Popular Conference, and Salah Khalil, member of the 
Executive Committee of the Arab Popular Liberation Movement.

  [Text] Baghdad, 13 Apr (INA)--The newspaper AL-THAWRAH 
affirms that the intense momentum in the number of visits to 
Baghdad by Western businessmen and trade firms is highly 
significant, and shows that the embargo clamped on Iraq is 
almost over. 
  In an article today, AL-THAWRAH, which speaks for the Arab 
Socialist Ba'th Party, adds that these Western parties hope to 
conclude business contracts and economic agreements with Iraq 
pending a lifting of the sanctions so as to resume their 
transactions with Iraq. 
  The paper notes the many offers Iraq has received from 
Western companies, including French, Italian, Greek, and Turkish 
corporations. The paper adds that the business community in 
Washington and London has not failed to express hope that it 
will not be denied a share in this competition. It made its 
position in this regard quite clear in its recent meeting with 
an Iraqi delegation in New York, a meeting that was held there 
at its own request. 
  AL-THAWRAH stresses that the strong competition among 
Western 
firms and corporations to curry favor with Iraq, and win 
cooperation contracts with it demonstrates that Iraq has emerged 
from the bottleneck, and efficiently shown its endurance and 
perseverance. This also shows that Iraq is an indispensable, 
important, and key regional player in terms of economy--with 
which cooperation is essential. 
  AL-THAWRAH also notes the impact of the embargo on the 
domestic front, saying that the past few years have underscored 
the excellence and superiority of Iraqi expertise, as manifested 
in its inventive and creative accomplishments within the context 
of the national reconstruction drive to rebuild what was 
destroyed in record time. This has rendered Iraqi expertise a 
strong competitor. 
  The paper also notes the embargo Washington has been 
enforcing to weaken and exhaust the Iraqis. But thanks to the 
wisdom of the leadership and the awareness of our people, the 
embargo has turned into a factor of attrition detrimental to 
others. Instead of becoming a heavy load on our chest, the 
embargo has burdened many European businesses which have not 
hidden their bitterness over U.S. deception and Washington's 
obtaining the lion share. These businesses were also embittered 
by Washington's frenzied efforts to obtain the traditional 
European shares in the Middle East markets. In this regard, the 
paper notes France's loss of an airbus deal with Saudi Arabia, 
the deal Washington has won. 
  AL-THAWRAH sheds light on the serious harm inflicted on 
Western interests in the region as a result of their resignation 
to the U.S. deception and intimidation campaign, saying that the 
most obvious result of this has been the bankruptcy of some 
4,000 Turkish companies over the past two years due to the Iraq 
embargo, not to mention that hundreds of West European and East 
European firms have laid off many of their workers and employees 
and been forced to shut down for the same reason. 
  To corroborate its argument, the paper cites statements 
recently made by a senior official of the Greek Ports 
Corporation that the halt in trade activities with Iraq has 
seriously affected the economy of his country. He added that 
the harm done to Greek ports due to the embargo is 
understandably equal to the financial revenues Greece has lost. 
The embargo is also responsible for increasing unemployment 
rates. The Greek official expressed hope that the anti-Iraq 
embargo will be lifted so that his country may reactivate its 
trade and business links with Iraq. 
  Regarding the impact of the Iraq embargo on the Arab scene, 
the paper cites a report issued by the Arab Labor Organization 
last week. This report stated that the number of unemployed in 
the Arab states has risen to 5 million due to the severance of 
trade ties with Iraq.

  [Text] Nicosia, April 11 (AFP) -- An adviser to President 
Saddam Husayn has held talks in Moscow about Russia resuming 
work on developing a giant oil field in southern Iraq, a 
specialist newsletter reported here Monday. 
  'Adnan al-'Ani, an adviser with ministerial rank, led the 
delegation to Moscow last week to discuss developing the West 
al-Qurnah field when the UN embargo is lifted, the Middle East 
Economic Survey (MEES) said. 
  The field close to the northern tip of the North al-Rumaylah 
field will have an estimated output capacity of 600,000 barrels 
per day after a second phase of work is completed, it added. 
  In an agreement signed in April 1984, the former Soviet 
Union 
was to develop the field under an engineering, supply, and 
construction contract financed by a 2-billion dollar soft credit 
facility. 
  Technoexport, a Soviet firm, was responsible for the first 
phase with a production capacity of 200,000 bpd, according to 
MEES published in Cyprus. 
  Much of the field's surface facilities have been built, but 
Technoexport was behind schedule when Iraq in?nah field was 
discovered by the Iraqi National Oil Company in 1973. 
  A UN embargo was imposed on Iraq when it invaded Kuwait and 
the UN Security Council has set conditions for Iraq to meet in 
order to have the embargo lifted.

  [Text] Iraq has protested to the Arab League that Saudi and 
Kuwaiti rulers continue to make base facilities available for 
American, British, and French aircraft violating the Iraqi 
airspace. A letter from Iraq's permanent delegate to the Arab 
League pointed out the serious threat the violations carry for 
the security, sovereignty, and national unity of Iraq. 
  The American, British, and French aircraft mounted 277 
sorties over Iraq between 1 and 7 April, having taken off from 
bases in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. 
  Attached to the letter was a detailed list of the flights 
for 
the attention of the league members.

  [Text] Cairo, 12 Apr (MENA)--Israeli Deputy Chief of Staff 
General Amnon Shahaq has described the session of talks with the 
Palestinian side that ended in Cairo today as "good." 
  In a news conference today, Shahaq said several topics were 
discussed in this session, including security matters upon which 
an agreement is now very close. He noted that some issues 
within the framework of the Security Committee have not yet been 
resolved, saying: We will resume the negotiations in Cairo next 
week to continue discussing these issues. 
  Shahaq, head of the Israeli delegation to the negotiations 
with the Palestinians, said agreement was reached with the 
Palestinian side to postpone some issues until after signing the 
executive agreement on Gaza and Jericho on the condition that 
negotiations on these points will be resumed after the signing. 
  On issues that are still under discussion between the two 
sides, he said issues concerning the Palestinian legal 
jurisdiction in civil affairs, as well as other matters, have 
not yet been discussed. He affirmed that agreement on security 
corridors and water will be reached before signing the accord 
and that the antiquities question has actually been resolved. 
  As for taxes, he said: We are waiting for an agreement to be 
reached by the economic committee, currently in session in 
Paris. Agreement is expected to be reached on fiscal 
jurisdiction before signing the accord. 
  He explained that there will not be more than five or six 
issues that will be deferred until an accord is signed; most of 
them are civil affairs and some may be related to civil affairs 
that are linked to security aspects. 
  He said that agreement was also reached on the size of the 
Palestinian police force, the total number of which will be 
9,000; 2,000 from inside Gaza and Jericho and 7,000 from abroad. 
  He added that 6,000 of the Palestinian policemen who will 
come from abroad will enter Gaza and Jericho directly after the 
signing of the "executive agreement" and the other 1,000 will 
enter three months after the agreement is signed. 
  As for the security measures inside Gaza and Jericho, he 
said, we are very close to reaching an agreement on them. He 
expressed hope that the negotiations will be completed within a 
few weeks; otherwise, they will encounter difficulties, as has 
been happening since the start of the talks. 
  Commenting on the Palestinian detainees, Shahaq said the 
Israeli side explained to the Palestinians everything about the 
detainees who will be released, to what factions they belong, 
and when the release will take place. He added: We will not 
allow the release of detainees from the Hamas movement, because 
they are against peace and their leaders and representatives in 
Amman had announced their responsibility for the recent 'Afula 
incident in northern Israel. He went on: Also, those who have 
carried out operations after 13 September, the date when the 
Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles was signed, and 
those responsible for operations in which Israelis were killed 
will not be released. He noted that this issue will not be 
discussed further. 
  Concluding his news conference, Shahaq said: The 
negotiations were hindered in the past not because of us but 
because of many other reasons and we have to complete the 
negotiations as quickly as possible.

  [Text] Cairo, 12 Apr (MENA)--Dr. Nabil Sha'th, head of the 
Palestinian delegation to the peace negotiations, declared that 
the Palestinian and Israeli sides have reached agreement on the 
size of the Palestinian police force in the Gaza Strip and 
Jericho area during the round of negotiations that ended in 
Cairo today. 
  Speaking at a news conference today at the conclusion of the 
negotiations, Sha'th said that the police force agreed upon will 
comprise 9,000 personnel; 2,000 from inside [the occupied 
territories] and 7,000 from outside. 
  He added that the agreement stipulates that 6,000 
Palestinian 
policemen will enter immediately after the signing of the 
executive agreement of the Gaza-Jericho First agreement and then 
another 1,000 will enter within three months of the signing of 
the agreement. [passage indistinct] 
  Sha'th went on to say: As to the weapons of the 9,000 
Palestinian policemen, they will be modern automatic rifles for 
policemen, and officers will also be issued pistols. He said 
that the Palestinian police will be supplied with a number of 
machine guns and some armored personnel carriers. 
  Regarding the issues on which no agreement has been reached 
so far, Sha'th said that these are: roads; the crossing points 
between Gaza, Jericho and Israel; joint patrols; the security 
measures on the roads; how to deal with any military operation; 
wrapping up the water issue. He added that these issues will be 
referred to the round that will be held in Cairo on 17 April. 
  On what Amnon Shahaq, head of the Israeli delegation, said 
in 
his news conference today, that Palestinian detainees who are 
members of Hamas will not be released, Sha'th said that the 
Palestinian side in the negotiations represents all the 
Palestinian people and it is its responsibility to negotiate to 
release all the detainees and not only the Fatah ones. 
  He added: I know that there is some sensitivity on the 
Israeli side, especially after the recent 'Afula incident in 
northern Israel. However, agreement was reached today to 
release 5,000 detainees and negotiations will be conducted to 
release the others. He stressed that the negotiations are being 
held in the name of the entire Palestinian people. 
  He went on to say: We are not negotiating for some detainees 
and not others. The peace we want to conclude is a peace between 
the entire Palestinian people and the entire Israeli people and 
not a peace between a Palestinian organization and an Israeli 
one. He said: We must shoulder the responsibility for an 
agreement on a general amnesty that will lead to the release of 
all the detainees. 
  Sha'th underlined the Palestinian side's determination to 
continue the negotiations to release all the detainees so that a 
real peace can be achieved, one which halts the conflict that 
has lasted for a long time and of which the detainees constitute 
a part.

    [Editorial Report] Tel Aviv DAVAR in Hebrew on 12 April, in 
a page 4 report by Moti Bassok on the Cairo talks, reports that 
"significant progress was made yesterday on a series of 
security, civilian, and military issues. Political sources in 
Jerusalem assessed yesterday that the agreement on the Israeli 
withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho will be signed by the end of 
the month. Two days after that, Israel will release 2,500 
Palestinian prisoners." 
  Basok reports that "a timetable for the Israeli withdrawal 
from Gaza and Jericho following the signing of the agreement was 
determined yesterday. Other things decided were a timetable for 
the release of Palestinian prisoners and the deployment dates 
for the Palestinian police force. Progress was also achieved on 
the issues of control of water resources, security in Gaza's 
naval zone, and control over the Gaza Strip and Jericho 
airspace. Most issues pertaining to judicial powers were also 
resolved." 
  Tel Aviv YEDI'OT AHARONOT in Hebrew on 12 April on pages 1 
and 19 carries a report by No'omi Levitzky saying that "the 
substantial entry of Palestinian policemen to the Gaza Strip and 
Jericho will start in early May. The force will number 9,000 
policemen: 2,000 from the territories and 7,000 from abroad. 
The deployment of the policemen in Gaza and Jericho will be 
completed by the end of May. The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] 
withdrawal will proceed at the same time and will be completed 
three weeks after the agreement is signed. 
  "The IDF withdrawal timetable at this stage looks as 
follows: 
During the first week after the agreement is signed, the IDF 
will withdraw from Rafah and Jericho. During the second week, 
it will pull out of Khan Yunus, and in the third week, it will 
leave Gaza and the northern part of the Strip. The body in 
charge of managing the autonomy will settle in Jericho during 
the first week after the agreement is signed."

<F P=106> [Interview with Ahmad Quray,' head of the Palestinian </F>
delegation to the economic talks with Israel, by radio 
correspondent Salim Badawi in Paris on 11 April -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Quray'] During this round of talks, we reached an 
agreement on three issues. The first issue is related to 
agriculture. In addition to organizing the relationship between 
the two parties, the agreement has opened, for the first time, 
the Israeli market for Palestinian agricultural products, such 
as vegetables and fruits. The Israeli market was completely 
closed before to Palestinian products. This is one of the 
papers that was accomplished. 
  The second paper deals with industry. This paper has defined 
the requirements for developing Palestinian industry and the 
relationship between the two parties. The paper even deals with 
the issue of standards and our commitment to these standards. 
Since Israel already has very rigid standards, we will not try 
at first to follow their standards, but we hope that in the 
future we will have our own firm industrial standards. 
  The third paper deals with energy. In this paper, we insist 
on pricing all oil products in accordance with the income of our 
Palestinian people. Although they insisted on one price for 
gasoline, it was agreed to allow a difference of 15 percent 
between the prices of fuel in the West Bank and Gaza and the 
prices of fuel in Israel. 
  Therefore, I believe that all these papers are good because 
-- although they did not meet all the demands -- they met some 
of the most important Palestinian aspirations to lay down the 
bases for an economic system that can survive and develop. 
  [Badawi] Brother Abu-al-'Ala' [Quray' nom de guerre]: The 
self-rule agreement has not yet been implemented although 13 
April is very close. What is the major obstacle in your view, 
and what do you expect to happen in the future? Rabin said the 
agreement on self-rule will not be reached before the first half 
of next month. 
  [Quray'] I do not want to anticipate things or deal with the 
causes. There is no doubt they shoulder the major 
responsibility for not accomplishing the accord on the set date, 
despite the great importance of respecting the dates stipulated 
by the accord -- I am talking in particular about the date 13 
April -- which means real implementation of the accord on the 
ground in terms of withdrawal, the return of Palestinian 
leaders, and the presence of Palestinian security and police on 
the ground. This should have been respected by them as well as 
by us. Regrettably, this date has not been met. However, I can 
say that the current round of talks in Cairo and the economic 
talks being held here will help expedite the implementation of 
this accord. I am optimistic that the Gaza-Jericho accord will 
be accomplished before the end of this month, within two weeks, 
or even less than this.

Gaza Strip via Egypt. 
  According to the same sources, al-Hindi presented the draft 
agreement to Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat last week for

  [Text] Both Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] and Fatah 
speak of a breakthrough achieved in a series of meetings between 
the two organizations' senior officials, and there is now talk 
of mutual respect and of an imminent agreement between the two 
organizations. 
  The most recent meeting was held five days ago. A senior 
Hamas official, who wished to remain anonymous, said his 
organization will seek to participate in all Palestinian 
institutions, such as health and education bodies, provided it 
is granted a fair slice in the future Gaza Strip rule. 
  A Fatah source has also confirmed the meeting, saying that 
his organization intended to permit Hamas to take an active part 
in the process, alongside Fatah, in a bid to solve together the 
Palestinian population's everyday problems. At the meetings, 
Hamas representatives expressed a desire to take part in the 
Palestinian police, when one is established. They are our 
brethren, a Hamas source said, and we will cooperate with them 
in a bid to ensure the Palestinian people's safety, and we are 
certainly not against participating in the Palestinian police 
force. The source added that Hamas welcomes the recently 
returned Gaza Strip deportees. 
  Another important decision made at the last meeting was that 
more meetings should be held to permit a discussion of various 
vital issues. A date for one such meeting was set for the next 
few days. 
  The rumors about the Fatah-Hamas meetings have generated 
great excitement in the Strip. The headline of yesterday's 
AL-QUDS, one of the leading newspapers in the territories, 
pronounced: Numerous Reactions to Fatah-Hamas Dialogue. The 
Strip residents now hope that with the autonomy implementation, 
they will be able to attend to all their affairs as one united 
front.

  [Text] Gaza City, Occupied Gaza Strip, April 12 (AFP) -- 
The Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas, which has opposed the 
peace process, is prepared to cooperate with the PLO in the 
police force and other public services, a source close to the 
group said Tuesday [12 April]. 
  Meanwhile, Israeli troops detained 30 to 40 suspected Hamas 
members in the al-Shati' refugee camp and neighbouring Gaza City 
on Monday night, Palestinian witnesses said. 
  The swoop came after the army announced the arrest of a 
local 
leader of the fundamentalist group in Jabaliya refugee camp. 
  Hamas has so far bitterly opposed the peace accord with 
Israel and criticized the Palestine Liberation Organization for 
accepting it. 
  But, the two groups held talks last week to settle their 
disputes. 
  "Our national and religious duties force us to stand 
united," 
said Ahmad Bahr, who has links with Hamas. 
  Hamas could join in the police force, provided the PLO 
agreed. 
  "In any case, we will consider the Palestinian police as our 
brothers, we will be soldiers to them and protect them. 
  "We do not oppose our brothers in the police force," said 
Bahr, who was deported by Israel in 1992 as a Hamas suspect and 
returned to Gaza three months ago. 
  A 9,000-strong Palestinian police force selected by the PLO 
is due to be deployed in the Gaza Strip and West Bank town of 
Jericho to maintain order during autonomy. 
  "We will unite in all fields with Fatah, except in 
negotiations with Israel," Bahr said, explaining that Hamas 
would cooperate in education, health and public services. 
  Rashid Abu-Shbak, a Fatah official in Gaza, said he welcomed 
the idea of HAMAS cooperation. He did not comment specifically 
on the possibility of Hamas joining the police force. 
  "We want to start a new page based on respect between the 
two 
groups," said Abu-Shbak who is in charge of taking over 
buildings vacated by Israelis under the autonomy deal. 
  A Palestinian research centre last month found that 4O 
percent of the Gaza Strip would vote in elections for PLO 
chairman Yasir 'Arafat's Fatah movement and nearly 20 percent 
for Hamas.

  [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, the 
compassionate. Salute of the armed struggle, the only way to 
liberate Palestine; salute of the blessed intifadah, which 
forged the most splendid feats of struggle; salute from the 
honorable ones to other honorable ones: We in the group of the 
holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque Martyrs [majmu'at shuhada' al-haram 
al-ibrahimi]-the Janin area claim responsibility for the 
following armed intifadah operations against enemy patrols: 
  --Throwing a hand grenade at the entrance of Qabatiyah on 3 
April 1994. 
  --Throwing a hand grenade at the martyrs' triangle 
[muthallath al-shuhada'] on 8 April 1994. Enemy troops opened 
fire in a hysterical way. They also fired flares, closed the 
roads, and began a large-scale search for those who carried out 
the two operations, who returned safely to base. 
  We pledge to our heroic people to be the faithful ones in 
our 
struggle to liberate all Palestine and also to proceed on the 
path of martyrs. It is a continuous intifadah until the land 
and man are liberated.

<F P=106> [Statement by the PFLP-GC on its 29th anniversary -- date </F>
not given] 
  [Excerpts] Masses of our militant Palestinian people, 
today, we celebrate the 29th anniversary of the Popular Front 
for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command's [PFLP-GC]. As 
this takes place, our Palestinian people continue to record, 
with Palestinian blood, their historical struggle against the 
unjust Zionist enemy. Meanwhile, most parties conspire with the 
Zionist enemy against them and sit at the same table with the 
enemy. 
  'Arafat's distant command over past years has been hostile 
to 
the national movement. 'Arafat had even chosen to stand in the 
trench of our people's enemies and to conspire against them. 
[passage omitted] 
  Our militant masses, we in the PFLP-GC, from a position of 
responsibility, call on all the sectors of our people who are 
concerned over their homeland to carry out the following duties: 
  1. Reject all the defeatist plans submitted by Yasir 
'Arafat; 
  2. Ignore differences that could hamper our militant march; 
  3. Escalate the Palestinian intifadah with the intensity 
that we saw during the militant days following the Hebron 
massacre; 
  4. Escalate the national armed struggle as it is the road 
to liberate Palestine from the river to the ocean; 
  5. Be wary of yellow journalism that squirts out venom 
against Palestinians who oppose the defeatist agreements; 
  6. Reject the autonomy conspiracy embodied in the 
Gaza-Jericho agreement, and confront it; 
  7. Enhance the sense of national belonging within 
Palestinian frameworks. 
  Let the 29th anniversary of the PFLP-GC's establishment on 
11 
April be a day when we renew the pledge to our martyrs, wounded, 
and detained, and a day of confrontation against the Zionist 
occupation forces. Let us make of this day a day of sweeping 
wrath against the traitor defeatists in the Palestinian arena. 
  We promise our people and our martyrs that we will continue 
to fight the Zionists and to avenge their pure blood that has 
saturated the soil of Palestine. It is a promise we make to 
Hebron and Gaza to avenge our martyrs who fell while defending 
the soil of Palestine. We promise our front to remain loyal 
soldiers until the land of Palestine is cleansed of occupation 
and the Palestinian state is established on all Palestinian 
national soil, with Arab Jerusalem, the Jerusalem of Muslims and 
Arabs, as its capital. 
  It is revolution until the liberation of land and man. 
  [Signed] The PFLP-GC

  [Excerpts] The Popular Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine-General Command [PFLP-GC] has escorted to their final 
resting place the martyrs of the heroic al-'Ayshiyah battle, 
which the front's fedayeen carried out against the Zionist enemy 
forces and their agents in southern Lebanon. These heroic 
martyrs fell after they killed more than 15 of the U.S.-Zionist 
enemy troops and their agents in a direct battle that came in 
response to the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. Having carried out 
their combat mission, our heroes were targeted by enemy 
artillery and air raids while they were returning to their 
bases. Other members of the group managed to return safely to 
base. 
  Heroic martyr Khalid Muhmmad Hilal, also known as Abu-Sakhr; 
heroic martyr Muhammad Mahmud al-Nu'aymi, also known as 
Abu-Iskandar 'Umar; and heroic martyr Ahmad Nasr Ibrahim, also 
known as Abu-Iskandar Ahmad, were laid to rest at the Martyrs 
Cemetery at the al-Yarmuk Camp [near Damascus] this afternoon. 
The funeral procession was led by Ahmad Jibril, PFLP-GC 
secretary general; Talal Naji, PFLP-GC assistant secretary 
general; Fadl Shururu, secretary of the PFLP-GC Political 
Bureau; and 'Umar al-Shihabi, member of the PFLP-GC Political 
Bureau. Also leading the funeral were a number of 
representatives of the Alliance of Palestinian Forces, the 
martyrs' relatives, a number of the PFLP-GC Central Committee 
members, and a large crowd of the masses of our Palestinian and 
Syrian Arab people. [passage omitted] 
  Meanwhile, in a funeral unprecedented since 1982, the body 
of 
the heroic martyr 'Awni Muhammad Manna', also known as 
Abu-Nasir, the commander of the heroic al-'Ayshiyah operation, 
was laid to rest at the 'Ayn al-Hulwah camp following the noon 
prayers yesterday, Monday. [passage omitted] 
  Our correspondent in southern Lebanon reports that in an 
attempt to disrupt the funeral, members of the 'Arafat clique 
assassinated a member of their own clique. However, this did 
not prevent the masses of our people from continuing 
participation in the funeral of heroic martyr Abu-Nasir.

<F P=106> [By Nasir al-Rimawi] </F>
  [Text] Ramallah -- The Democratic Front for the Liberation 
of Palestine [DFLP] has called for the holding of free and 
democratic municipal council elections. It also called for 
rejecting the principle of appointments. 
  In a statement distributed yesterday in Ramallah, the DFLP 
warned against the municipalities' assumption of political 
tasks, as in Hebron. The statement emphasized the need for 
municipalities to fulfill their role in serving the residents, 
far from the Oslo accord. It said that no one has the right to 
use the municipalities for political purposes. 
  The statement renewed the demand to hold comprehensive 
elections for all municipalities. It considers the lack of 
response to the demand for elections as an indication of the 
dictatorship of the coming authority, which our people will not 
allow. 
  The statement said that the Israeli consent to reinstate the 
Hebron municipal council members, who were elected 18 years ago, 
was a bribe. The Israeli authorities have refused and are 
refusing to collectively reinstate the elected municipal 
councils, which is a popular Palestinian demand. 
  The statement sharply criticized what it called "the new 
concessions," namely; having the settlers remain in the heart of 
Hebron and in all the occupied territories, giving up the demand 
for international protection for our defenseless people, and 
sufficing with a weak multinational observers' presence as a 
substitute to the international protection stipulated by the 
Security Council.

  [Text] SAWT AL-SHA'B has received the following letter

  The Editor: 
  SAWT AL-SHA'B, on Sunday, 10 April, 1994, published a report 
about five of 'Arafat's companions being involved in a dollar 
forging operation, etc. 
  We would like to state that the report has no basis in truth 
and must have been fabricated by a sick mind in the context of a 
wicked effort steered by circles hostile to the PLO and its 
leadership. 
  We would like to make it clear that any actions prejudicial 
to the brotherly ties between the brother Tunisian and 
Palestinian peoples are the responsibility of the PLO's security 
services, in conjunction with brother Tunisians. Any practices 
that may discredit the PLO or abuse brother Tunisia's 
hospitality are handled in the same fashion.

  [Text] Brothers, it is no longer a secret that Israel's 
intransigence has become manifest in blocking the peace process 
in the Middle East. It will not come to the rescue of the 
occupation and its leaders. This intransigence will inevitably 
lead them to perdition. It seems the occupation and its leaders 
do not yet understand that their foolhardy actions will kill the 
peace process in the region and wipe out any future aspirations 
for peace. This will open the doors to war and violence. 
  They are mistaken to believe that by wasting time and 
avoiding commitment to the schedule for the implementation of 
the Declaration of Principles -- which is the only historical 
opportunity for establishing just and comprehensive peace in the 
region -- they can succeed in finding a way to undermine the 
Palestinian national struggle and obstruct the PLO's political 
bodies. If we reach a dead end, our steadfast and lofty people, 
with their nationalist and brave leadership, will submit new 
options. Then, and only then will the occupation and its leaders 
realize that they are the only party that is responsible for 
wasting the historic opportunity for establishing just and 
comprehensive peace in the region. 
  It is true that we are patient, and that we work for a just 
and comprehensive peace. However, our patience has its limits. 
The occupation and its leaders will be the losers. As for our 
people, who continue to sacrifice their sons, they will 
ultimately attain their just and legitimate objectives of 
freedom, independence, and life. The occupation and its leaders 
should always keep in mind the conspicuous fact that victory is 
the lot of our people and that defeat and loss is for the 
occupation and its leaders.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Realization of Peace Is the Response to </F>
Violence"] 
  [Text] The mutual acts of violence in the arena of 
struggle are making the situation worse and more complicated and 
are casting a dark shadow on the stalled negotiating process. 
  These acts will not cease as long as the negotiating process 
does not achieve practical results on the ground. The Oslo 
accord set 13 April as the date for ending the occupation in 
Gaza and Jericho as the first step toward beginning talks over a 
final settlement. Evidence and facts indicate, however, that 
this date will pass without the realization of a practical 
achievement. Consequently, the cycle of violence will remain 
and bloodshed will continue. This is something which we do not 
desire, but condemnation and precautionary measures are 
insufficient and will not stop acts of violence. The only way 
to do that is by advancing in the negotiating process and 
understanding the facts of the struggle. Delay in reaching 
agreements on implementing the accord will leave the door open 
for mutual acts of violence that we have always hoped will stop. 
  Israel is called upon to seriously accelerate the 
negotiating 
process, adhere to what it signed in Washington and Cairo, 
refrain from engaging in procedural matters, and move toward the 
achievement of practical steps leading to peace and stability, 
so that calm will prevail and violence will end forever. 
  We strongly condemn acts of violence regardless of the party 
that perpetrates them and look forward to the moment in which 
the foundations of peace and stability are laid down.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "A Hopeless Israeli Maneuver"] </F>
  [Excerpts] At a time when the Palestinians are doing all 
in their power to conclude the negotiations on implementing the 
Gaza-Jericho First accord and are being subjected to immense 
pressure by various parties to make concessions to Israel, so 
much so that they have nothing more to concede, the Palestinian 
people in the occupied territories are being subjected to a 
different kind of pressure. Israel has arbitrarily imposed 
blockades and an economic siege on them. This situation has 
alienated the people and the leadership from the accord and 
implementation. Clearly, by this policy, Israel wants to create 
a rift between the leadership and the people. If pressure on 
the people in the occupied territories is coupled with 
concessions by the negotiators abroad, the result will be -- or 
so Israel thinks -- that trust between the inside and outside 
will be shaken. If this is the aim of the multipronged 
offensive, Israel and the United States will discover that this 
policy will fail because the Palestinians, who have been burned 
by the fire of repeated offensives, know how to wage these 
battles. This policy will not succeed in paralyzing the 
Palestinians' power of confrontation. [passage omitted] 
  Israel has repeatedly tried to avoid dealing with the PLO to 
no avail. Ultimately, it was forced to conclude the Oslo accord 
with the PLO. Has Israel returned to its old attempts to 
confuse the Palestinians and raise doubts about the Palestinian 
people's real address? As if they can find another address to 
peddle their schemes and avoid commitment to the Oslo accord's 
clauses, or at best to implement the accord in accordance with 
the Israeli interpretation. Israel fails to realize that all 
these attempts are doomed to failure. It would be better for 
Israel to accelerate implementation of the peace process in a 
way that responds to legitimate Palestinian demands. This is 
the only way to prevent the deterioration of the situation and 
stop acts of violence from both sides. 
  The situation cannot endure maneuvering and foot-dragging. 
Israel might be thinking that time is on its side. This may be 
so in the short-term, but over the long-term Israel will realize 
that it has lost a golden opportunity for achieving a settlement 
with the Palestinians. If Israel is betting on fragmenting the 
Palestinian people's national fabric, this is not in its 
interest because it will have to return to square one, namely, 
to the cycles of the conflict from the beginning. If today 
Israel is rejecting the Palestinian address, in the future it 
will find not one but several addresses for negotiations -- one 
more radical than the other.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Peaceful Siege"] </F>
  [Text] The only haste that we, the Palestinians, are 
sensing from Israel is in placing further measures and 
restrictions while remaining oblivious to the damage being 
inflicted on our various sectors, especially the workers, who 
have been deprived of the source of their livelihood. 
  In contrast to the haste in restricting us, we are 
witnessing 
a slow down in the Palestinian-Israeli rounds of talks aimed at 
working out the arrangements for implementing the self-rule plan 
on the basis of the Oslo accord. Because there have been so 
many rounds, we are no longer counting them, nor do we know 
their exact number, or when will they end and for how long will 
they continue, especially after the sanctity of dates has been 
ignored. The Israeli side is keen on engaging in endless 
squabbling over the details and formalities and in Byzantine 
discussions, allowing this land that is thirsting for peace to 
be a fertile ground for tensions and explosions. 
  Irrespective of how long the security siege continues, it 
will not achieve security, safety, and stability for anyone in 
this region, which in fact needs a peaceful siege before which 
the shackles of sieges and military closures break down. The 
Palestinian people, who are being subjected to the most powerful 
pressures and to warfare in obtaining their livelihood, have not 
lost their faith in the inevitable victory of a just peace; the 
realization of their legitimate rights; liberation from 
dependency in the political and economic spheres; and the 
formulation of a sound basis for an infrastructure over their 
land. These people are determined to cling to and persevere on 
this land regardless of the storms raging now and then. 
  The important thing is that we must not allow frustration to 
penetrate into our ranks, and we should always remember that the 
darkest nights are followed by the light of dawn. 
  Finally, if we really want to safeguard our expected 
independence, we must build an integral economy and launch 
investment projects that ensure the absorption of our laborers; 
secure for them a decent life; spare them the need of working 
inside the Green Line; and keep them on our green land.

  [Text] Reacting to the Hadera attack, President 'Ezer 
Weizman calls for national unity, for keeping calm, and 
continuing the peace process. In his opinion, the government 
should consider several additional steps that can ensure 
security. 
  Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin also calls for national unity 
and for finding the unifying factors in anticipation of the hard 
times ahead. He adds that despite the bloodshed, Israel will 
continue extending its hand in peace. 
  Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres says the Hadera attack will 
not halt the peace process or deter Israel in the pursuit of its 
goals. He further said that 'Arafat is not omnipotent, and there 
is no point in continuously demanding that he denounce terrorist 
attacks. 
  Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu blames the government for 
the rising terror and demands that the prime minister either 
discontinue the negotiations with the PLO or announce elections. 
  Tzomet head Refa'el Eytan demands that the government stop 
the peace talks until terror stops. This is also the demand of 
YI'UD [Independent and Democratic Israel] head Gonen Segev. 
  Meretz faction chairman Ran Kohen calls on 'Arafat and the 
Palestinian leadership to immediately condemn the heinous 
murder. He calls on Israeli opposition leaders not to disrupt 
the national unity of Remembrance Day mourning and not to 
exploit the attack for political purposes. 
  The National Religious Party calls on the prime minister to 
resign at once. 
  Minister Yosi Sarid says the government will do all it can 
to 
pursue terrorists, but it will pursue peace at the same time. 
  The Arab Democratic Party and Deputy Minister Walid Sadiq 
condemn the Hadera attack. 
  The Moledet faction calls for an immediate halt of the 
negotiations with the Palestinians and for banning their 
policemen from Gaza and Jericho. 
  Police Minister Moshe Shahal promises to capture the 
perpetrators. He says the government will not rest until it 
brings peace.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by </F>
Ya'el Dan and Mikha Friedman -- live] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Dan] We have just heard of a 
breakthrough, of some contacts and agreements between the PLO 
and Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement], of these two parties 
discussing coexistence for the sake of the Palestinian people. 
Are you encouraged by this development? Do you believe Hamas 
will join the peace process? 
  [Peres] There is a lot of pretense in these matters and in 
the relationship among the Arabs, quite a lot of embellishment 
and not enough substance. All I can say is that if Hamas 
emulates the PLO by abandoning terror and sanctioning peace, it 
will be the surprise of the century. I doubt that. 
  [Dan] Can their coexistence be negative from our point of 
view? 
  [Peres] If the coexistence is negative, there will be no 
agreement. We must not forget that peace is not an agreement on 
reciprocal favors. Peace serves each side, first and foremost. 
  [Friedman] Mr. Peres, this week we read reports emanating 
from the top echelons of your ministry to the effect that the 
outlines of the arrangement with Syria are absolutely clear to 
you: In return for full peace, there will be full Israeli 
withdrawal on the Golan Heights, which will not happen gradually 
over 20 years, but rather within a much shorter period. Is that 
the master plan of peace with Syria? 
  [Peres] No, I do not think so. You can put anything on 
paper, and there can be as many position papers as you like. No 
such stand has been embraced by the Israeli Government, and 
hence, not by the Foreign Ministry either. The Foreign Ministry 
is an integral part of the government. I think what the paper 
intended was mainly to emphasize the positive aspect -- the need 
for a comprehensive agreement with all the Arab countries on all 
the disputed issues. They may have meant to indicate the price 
exacted by al-Asad. In any event, it is not a binding paper, 
and there are lots of papers and lots of archives in the State 
of Israel. 
  [Dan] The truth, Mr. Peres, is that unless you tell us that 
there is truth in the reports about secret agreements with 
Syria, we have been hearing more reports about increased Syrian 
military buildup than of peace negotiations. 
  [Peres] There is nothing secret with the Syrians. It is 
true, the Syrian Army is making buildup attempts, which is 
certainly a problem we cannot discount. In the fundamental, 
profoundly historic sense, however, Syria has no option other 
than peace. Even if it purchases weapons from 
Russia....[pauses] Russia as it was known exists no longer, not 
even in terms of weapon production and terms of supply. 
  [Friedman] When you say there is nothing secret with Syria, 
are you saying it with regret, because in view of the stalemate, 
it would have been better.... 
  [Peres, interrupting] I was definitely speaking regretfully, 
because I think the negotiations should be more open on the one 
hand and more clandestine on the other. They should be more 
open in order to show each nation that the other side desires 
peace explicitly and unwaveringly. 
  [Friedman] Then what holds the Syrians back from promoting 
the peace process with us? 
  [Peres] Old habits, including a regime which is not open, a 
regime which does not openly face its public, a very 
uncommunicative regime in a universe in which television and 
other electronic media, newspapers, and radio networks all 
participate in the negotiations. It should be clear that 
negotiations cannot be conducted by officials or ministers 
alone, they have to be conducted by nations. They should be 
negotiations that look and sound good, and they should be 
plausible. The details can be negotiated at a site not lit up 
by the sun. 
  [Dan] Have we made attempts to hold contacts away from the 
sun, and were these attempts snubbed by the Syrians? Is that 
the reason....? 
  [Peres, interrupting] No. I mean, attempts were made, we 
did suggest that as in any other negotiations, one segment 
should be more exposed, more public, and the other more 
technical and more confidential to enable us to conduct 
negotiations without encountering daily criticism over some 
leaked details. 
  [Dan] Mr. Peres, when do you anticipate peace with Syria? 
  [Peres] It is very difficult to tell, because the Syrians 
are very obstinate, and their march forward is very sluggish. 
They are extremely slow. I hope it will happen this year, but 
I can make no guarantees. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Twenty-three-year-old 'Awwad Hasan Tabbash was 
killed today by soldiers' gunfire in the al-Jalazun refugee camp 
near Ramallah. Local Arabs told our correspondent Moti Amir 
that soldiers opened fire at stonethrowers who attacked Israeli 
cars driving on the Ramallah-Nabulus road. According to them, 
the youngster was hit by the fire and died at the Ramallah 
hospital. The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] is looking into the 
circumstances of the incident. 
  A youngster from the Dayr al-Balah refugee camp in the Gaza 
Strip was arrested near the industrial zone at the Erez 
checkpoint. He was carrying a knife and a Koran. An initial 
check revealed that he had been on his way to stab soldiers 
stationed at the checkpoint. 
  At noon today, IDF troops demolished a building in which 
armed Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] terrorists were 
believed to be barricaded. The house was surrounded early this 
morning, and the IDF imposed a curfew on Ramallah. The security 
forces tried for a long time to make the terrorists surrender. 
In the last few hours, Fatah members phoned Tunis to inform 
Yasir 'Arafat that the IDF had laid siege to the house of Dr. 
al-Wahidi, a Fatah member and a personal acquaintance of 
'Arafat. Our correspondent Moti Amir reports that IDF 
bulldozers demolished the house after all its inhabitants were 
taken out and after the terrorists were urged several times to 
come out and surrender. Our correspondent points out that Dr. 
al-Wahidi is the father of the terrorist Avir al-Wahidi. She 
was arrested about a year ago for taking part in the murder of 
Israelis.

  [Text] Turkish Interior Minister Nahit Mentese and the 
delegation accompanying him arrived in Damascus today on a 
three-day visit to Syria at the invitation of Interior Minister 
Dr. Muhammad Harbah. 
  He was received at Damascus International Airport by 
Interior 
Minister Dr. Muhammad Harbah, senior Interior Ministry 
officials, Turkish Ambassador in Damascus Ugur Ziya, and the 
embassy staff. 
  In a statement to a SANA correspondent, he expressed his 
happiness to visit Syria. He stressed that his visit is an 
extension of the relations between the Syrian and Turkish 
peoples. He added: I am certain that this visit will achieve 
all our people's ambitions and wishes through a discussion of 
the issues of interest to our countries. 
  He said: I greatly hope that the visit will achieve its 
objectives through a convergence of views on current, past, and 
future issues. We will also try to remove all the obstacles

  Concluding his statement, he said: The visit will contribute 
to entrenching trade, cultural, scientific, and political 
relations.

  [Text] Turkish-Syrian official talks on security and 
cooperation have begun in Damascus. Bilateral cooperation to 
prevent drug and arms smuggling and terror is being discussed at 
the talks. Ibrahim Gokhan Sari from the Turkish Radio and 
Television team in Damascus reports the following: 
  [Begin Sari recording] Interior Minister Nahit Mentese, who 
is heading the Turkish delegation at the talks, said that the 
Syrians have responded positively to the problems presented by 
Turkey and its request for cooperation on those issues. Noting 
that, however, this is not sufficient, Mentese said: We have to 
see concrete results. That is what we are waiting for. 
Pointing out that Turkey attaches great importance to these 
talks, Mentese added that if the problems are solved the 
Turkish-Syrian border will become one of peace. 
  Syrian Interior Minister Muhammad Harbah said that his 
country is in favor of Turkey's security, stability and 
territorial integrity. He pointed out that anyone who is 
acquainted with the structure and geography of the region will 
realize that it is in Syria's interests to maintain good 
relations with its neighbors and especially with Turkey. Harbah 
stated that all the necessary steps are being taken in line with 
all the agreements concluded so far with Turkey. He noted that 
the two countries should understand and trust one another, 
adding that only then can one achieve better relations. The 
security director general and representatives from the pertinent 
ministries and organizations are also participating in the 
talks. [end recording]

  [Text] Damascus, Syria April 12 (AA) -- Interior Minister 
Nahit Mentese said today that the Turkish delegations told 
Syrian officials that the separatist terror organization's PKK 
[Workers Party of Kurdistan] leader Abdullah Ocalan and his 
friends were instructing their organization, from Syrian and 
Lebanese soil. 
  `The Syrian officials deny this, while we insist on it,' 
Mentese said. 
  On the second day of his official visit to Syria, Mentese 
had 
a two-hour meeting with 'Abd-al-Halim Khaddam, first assistant 
to the Syrian head of state. 
  In a statement afterward, Mentese said that during their 
meeting with ranking Syrian officials since yesterday, the 
Turkish delegation stressed that Ocalan was living either in 
Syria or Lebanon. 
  `For us, the PKK is the most important problem,' he said. 
'We 
insist on the fact that PKK leaders are based in Syria and 
Lebanon. They claimed that Lebanon was a separate state. Since 
we are aware of Syria's influence in Lebanon, we asked them to 
intervene into the situation. All these talks proceeded in a 
friendly atmosphere.' 
  `They also told us that they condemned the terror actions of 
PKK and it was out of the question for them to cooperate with 
these terrorists,' Mentese said.

<F P=106> [Report by Ilyas Masuh in Damascus] </F>
  [Excerpt] Egyptian President Husni Mubarak and Syrian 
President Hafiz al-Asad have discussed the Middle East peace 
process on the eve of the expected visit to the region by the 
U.S. secretary of state to activate the peace talks which have 
been suspended for two months. President al-Asad arrived in 
Egypt on a visit that was not previously announced. 
  AL-QABAS learned that President Mubarak proposed to his 
Syrian counterpart that his country embarks on efforts to 
activate the Syrian-Israeli track and to achieve rapprochement 
with the PLO. Al-Asad, however, rejected the idea of holding a 
tripartite summit that will also include Yasir 'Arafat who will 
arrive in Cairo today. 
  Egypt expressed reservations about a Syrian offer to open 
channels between Cairo and Tehran. 
  Diplomatic sources in Damascus told AL-QABAS that President 
al-Asad discussed with Mubarak the recent negative developments 
in Syrian-American relations and the attempt by some quarters in 
the U.S. Administration to undermine these relations with the 
aim of striking at the positive achievements attained in the 
Geneva summit. The objective of these quarters also is to 
retaliate for the failure of the attempts to end the Arab 
boycott of Israel and show their annoyance with the resumption 
of the Russian role in the region. 
  The sources also disclosed that President al-Asad will visit 
Moscow and Tehran in the coming stage. The sources added that 
all these developments will not affect Syria's commitment to the 
peace process in light of the bases it previously defined.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] Gentlemen: Israeli officials have continued to make 
statements on the possibility of making progress in the talks 
with Syria following the break. Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq 
Rabin has said that Syria's demand for full Israeli withdrawal 
from the Golan in return for full peace is unacceptable. He 
claims that Israel has agreed, in principle, on a withdrawal in 
the Golan, and that there is some kind of connection between 
peace and withdrawal on the one hand, and between security 
arrangements and the timetable of this withdrawal on the other. 
It is known that the Israelis make these sorts of statements on 
specific occasions, and deliberately make ambiguous statements 
to delude the world public, to deceive it, and to conceal the 
true nature of Israel's hostility to peace. However, these 
statements no longer deceive anyone. More than 27 months after 
the Madrid conference, the Washington peace talks are still at 
square one and there is no sign of any change in the Israeli 
position. In fact, Rabin has rejected the principle of full 
withdrawal from the Golan and went back to singing his old tune 
on withdrawal in the Golan. He is talking about a partial 
withdrawal, which Syria rejected from the very beginning, and 
with which it cannot deal at all, especially since it 
constitutes a violation of Syria's clear rights and sovereignty 
on its territory. It is also a violation of the UN Security 
Council resolutions, the basis of the Madrid conference, and the 
essence of the U.S. initiative based on the land-for-peace 
formula. 
  Syria has said many times that it will accept no compromise 
in the Golan or partial or phased settlements, and that peace 
and occupation cannot go together. However, the Israeli rulers, 
who focus their efforts on devouring the occupied Arab 
territories, adopted the policy of maneuvering and 
procrastination, and of torpedoing the peace efforts from within 
the Washington talks. They sought to split the negotiating Arab 
ranks in an attempt to undermine the principle of a just and 
comprehensive peace on all fronts of the conflict. They believe 
that they can succeed on the other fronts of the conflicts just 
as they have succeeded in dragging the Palestinian side into a 
partial agreement that is completely at odds with the desired 
peace. 
  Subjugating the occupied territories to a full military 
siege, and escalating confrontations, clashes, and acts of 
violence, proves to anyone seeking the truth that the separate 
agreement did not bring peace. In fact, it has further 
complicated the situation and made it even more volatile. The 
Israeli officials have thus far done nothing other than stab the 
international peace efforts in the back. In fact, they will be 
exposing the peace process to grave danger if they insist on 
their intransigent stands and their rejection of a full 
withdrawal from the Golan and the other occupied territories. 
  It is clear that the U.S. Administration's huge financial 
and 
military aid to Israel contributes to Israel's intransigence. 
The U.S. Administration has claimed that this aid will actually 
encourage Israel to join the peace process once it is reassured 
about its alleged security problems. What is happening is just 
the opposite, for Israel has become more intransigent in evading 
the requirements of the peace process. At the same time, its 
security demands have increased. Observers who have followed 
developments in the Middle East believe that the U.S. 
Administration is responsible for a great deal of the stumbling 
in the peace process, for why would Israel, which is essentially 
saturated with a hostile and expansionist spirit, submit to the 
will of peace while it is receiving unlimited financial and 
military aid?

<F P=106> [Report by the political editor] </F>
  [Text] Following the official Jordanian announcement 
linking the continuation of the negotiations with the end of the 
siege on the Port of al-'Aqabah, Jordanian-U.S. relations 
entered a transient state of tension similar to many episodes in 
the past, the most notable of which was the crisis in relations 
during the Gulf war. Such a state of relations is termed 
estrangement for the sake of rapprochement. Even if relations 
seem tense on the surface, they remain controlled in a state of 
harmony despite the fact that disputes sometimes allow for such 
tension!! 
  The question is: What happened and where did the real shake 
up in relations occur? And are there any new facts in the siege 
of al-'Aqabah or the negotiations? 
  In fact, there are new realities concerning those two 
issues. 
However, it is more important to note, however, that relations 
became tense following the Oslo agreement. The United States 
became dissatisfied with the performance of the Arab parties, 
especially Jordan, after the quick and dramatic step taken by 
the PLO, in which it surpassed everything that is normal in 
terms of making concessions. The Arab parties could no longer 
keep up with this step, except by announcing their final 
submission to the Israeli conditions. Moreover, they could no 
longer adopt an opposing stand, like what happened when dealing 
with [former Egyptian President] al-Sadat's signing of the Camp 
David agreement. The Arab parties taking direct part in the 
negotiating process are weak and separated, just like the other 
nonparticipating Arab parties. Any contribution by distant 
countries would be a negative contribution. This is what is 
happening with some Gulf and Arab Maghreb countries, which are 
taking normalization steps and are using the fact that the sole 
and legitimate representative [of the Palestinian people] signed 
the Oslo agreement with Israel as a justification!! 
  On the first day after the Oslo agreement, Jordan adopted a 
reserved stand, regardless of the seriousness of the agreement. 
This is because Jordan considered its role as an umbrella in the 
negotiations as no longer valid. This is especially true since 
the PLO began to hold direct negotiations and thus it no longer 
needed an umbrella. It may not even need the Madrid formula or 
any international formula, especially since the United States 
has achieved what it always called for in terms of the need to 
hold direct negotiations with Israel without U.S. mediation, 
which is exactly what Israel wants. 
  It is also known that the reserved Jordanian stand -- a 
stand 
which even rejected the Oslo agreement in the beginning -- 
turned 180 degrees and became a supportive one. It was clear 
from the beginning that this support for the Oslo agreement was 
compulsory and that Jordan had to take more than one step to 
cope with the course of Israeli-Palestinian contacts. Hence, 
many meetings and talks were held and many statements were made. 
These meetings did not satisfy Israel, which insisted on 
signing a separate peace treaty or agreement and was not 
satisfied with signing an agenda only. 
  Within the framework of exerting pressure on Jordan, Israel 
announced that Jordan would sign an agreement with Israel before 
the end of last year. Moreover, PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat 
announced more than once that the day of signing this agreement 
is approaching. He said on more than one occasion that this 
agreement was going to be signed last January. 
  'Arafat's remarks in this regard were based on Israeli and 
U.S. reports that King Husayn would sign a peace agreement 
during his U.S. visit in January 1994. 
  Jordan had received a U.S. letter in late 1993, stressing in 
the strongest possible terms the need to use the Jordanian 
monarch's Washington visit to sign a peace agreement at a 
meeting between the U.S. president, the Israeli prime minister, 
and the Jordanian monarch. Nonetheless, Jordan rejected the 
U.S. proposal. 
  When King Husayn visited the United States, he came under 
strong pressure from the U.S. Administration to sign a peace 
treaty with Israel. However, King Husayn reiterated his 
rejection of this proposal, and stressed his adherence to 
comprehensive peace, contending that this is the only guarantee 
for the success of the peace process. 
  The Jordanians thought that they had neutralized U.S. anger 
over this issue. Besides, the United States pretended to 
understand the rationale behind the Jordanian position. 
Nonetheless, the signals sent by Washington afterward reflected 
exasperation, and put greater pressure on Jordan to sign a 
unilateral peace treaty or take positions that would help untie 
the stalemated Israeli-PLO negotiations, particularly in the 
aftermath of the Hebron massacre. 
  Then came the visit to Saudi Arabia by King Husayn to 
perform 
the minor pilgrimage in the holy places there, and Saudi 
Arabia's failure to conduct itself properly, in line with even 
the most basic duties acknowledged in international relations. 
This development was a U.S. message addressed to Jordan. At 
any rate, it was the tightening of the siege clamped on the Port 
of al-'Aqabah that further aggravated the strained 
Jordanian-U.S. ties. 
  The incidents of intercepting and turning back 
al-'Aqabah-bound ships have increased dramatically. The most 
obvious position taken in this regard was the public threat made 
by a U.S. congressional delegation that visited Jordan in March. 
This delegation said that the siege clamped on the Port of 
al-'Aqabah will be aggravated if Jordan does not sign a 
unilateral peace treaty with Israel, adding that the signing of 
such a treaty would result in efforts to lift the siege. 
  The congressional delegation asserted that it would 
recommend 
the lifting of the al-'Aqabah siege, as well as aid to Jordan, 
if Jordan meets the U.S. demand of signing a treaty with Israel. 
Moreover, the United States was extremely dissatisfied with 
Jordan's refusal to host an economic conference scheduled to 
have convened in Amman on 10 April. The countries concerned 
with economic activities in the region, including Israel, were 
slated to participate in the meetings of this conference. 
  A carrot offered to Jordan in this regard was talk of a 
possible reconsideration of Jordan's debts by the United States 
and West European states. Nonetheless, there were no firm 
commitments in this regard. Jordan replied by saying that it 
could not host such a meeting in Amman at present. However, 
Jordan said that it would not object to hosting such a 
conference in late 1994 if the parties to the Middle East peace 
process manage to achieve a comprehensive peace agreement on all 
tracks of the negotiations, as expected. 
  In a nutshell, Jordan will remain faced with pressure and 
intimidation to weaken its position and impose unfair conditions 
on it in order to force it to sign a peace treaty with Israel 
and effect a premature normalization of ties. Jordan's recent 
announcement that it is linking its continued engagement in the 
negotiations to the lifting of the siege clamped on the Port of 
al- 'Aqabah may have achieved numerous objectives, the first 
among which is that U.S. efforts are currently focused on a 
return to the course of the negotiations enshrined in the Madrid 
formula. This keeps at bay any talk of a unilateral peace 
agreement. 
  The most important thing that experience has taught us is 
that submission to the United States always produces negative 
results.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Washington Charts Jordanian School </F>
Curricula; the U.S. Ambassador Urges Jordanian Educationists To 
Expedite Change of Curricula] 
  [Excerpt] AL-MAJD has learned that the Ministry of 
Education is currently implementing a U.S. project for Jordanian 
curricula, particularly in the subjects of national education, 
science, and mathematics. 
  Reliable sources told AL-MAJD that the ministry is currently 
changing these curricula in accordance with a U.S. cultural 
project. The ministry's curricula director has visited 
Washington to bring U.S. experts specialized in preparing 
scholastic textbooks. The head of the American Information 
Center prepared secondary school vocational education programs 
as well as training programs for secondary stage teachers. 
  U.S. Ambassador to Jordan Wesley Egan and U.S. Cultural 
Attache Jonathan Rice visited the Ministry of Education. They 
met with educational leaders, who reviewed their accomplishments 
in cooperating with the U.S. cultural project and how they 
brought a U.S. expert to modify the social and national 
education textbooks for the primary stage and hold two workshops 
for English language teachers, supervised by a U.S. expert. 
  The leading educationists thanked the U.S. Administration 
for 
the "facilities" extended by the American Information Center in 
issues of politics and society. The U.S. ambassador, in turn, 
thanked the ministry's educational leaders for their 
coordination and cooperation efforts to implement the U.S. 
cultural program and asked them to continue their implementation 
the "Humphrey" program for studies in the field of education 
planning. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Amman, 12 Apr (INA) -- King Husayn of Jordan this 
afternoon received Hamid Yusuf Hammadi, [Iraqi] minister of 
culture and information and the personal envoy of President 
Saddam Husayn. Hammadi conveyed to King Husayn a personal 
message from President Saddam Husayn that deals with the 
fraternal bilateral relations and the importance of coordinating 
stands with Arab and friendly countries to support Iraq's 
position to have the unjust embargo lifted. 
  King Husayn stressed to President Saddam Husayn's personal 
envoy Jordan's solidarity with Iraq, especially since Iraq has 
proven its compliance with Security Council resolutions, which

  [Text] Amman, 11 Apr (PETRA)--Talal Sat'an al-Hasan, 
minister of state for foreign affairs, today received Ozdem 
Sanberk, under secretary of the Turkish Foreign Ministry, who is 
currently on a visit to Jordan. 
  The minister and the guest discussed bilateral relations, 
the 
means to reinforce and develop these relations, the latest 
regional and international developments, and the peace process. 
Al-Hasan explained Jordan's position toward the peace process 
and the vital role it is playing, as well as His Majesty King 
Husayn's efforts to bring about a just, comprehensive, and 
lasting peace in the region based on the principles of 
international legitimacy and UN Security Council Resolutions 242 
and 338. 
  Al-Hasan stressed the importance of lifting the suffering 
caused by the siege on the Port of al-'Aqabah and the need to 
intensify efforts to stop these measures, which have resulted in 
serious losses for the Jordanian economy. 
  For his part, Sanberk stressed the depth of the traditional 
ties linking the two countries. He praised His Majesty King 
Husayn's wise and enlightened leadership and the sincere efforts 
his majesty is exerting to achieve peace and maintain security 
and stability in the region. 
  In another development, the Jordanian side, led by Nayif 
al-Hadid, secretary general of the Foreign Ministry, and the 
Turkish side, led by Ozdem Sanberk, under secretary of the 
Turkish Foreign Ministry, held talks at the Foreign Ministry 
building today. The talks dealt with bilateral relations and 
the need to upgrade these relations beyond coordination and 
cooperation in all available fields. 
  Al-Hadid briefed the guest on Jordan's policy toward the 
peace process and the pillars of the Jordanian stand. This 
stand is represented by the need to implement the principles of 
international legitimacy and Resolutions 242 and 338; Israel's 
withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories, particularly 
Jerusalem; securing the legitimate rights of the Palestinian 
Arab people on their national soil; restoring the Jordanian 
rights to land, security, and water; and solving the refugees 
problem. 
  Al-Hadid stressed the great importance of ending the siege 
imposed on the Gulf of Aqaba in light of Jordan's commitment to 
UN resolutions and its constructive stands toward the peace 
process and toward the region's stability and security. 
  For his part, Sanberk said that Jordanian and Turkish views 
were identical on the need to adhere to the principles of 
international legitimacy in order to achieve a just and 
comprehensive peace in the Middle East. He praised the 
Jordanian role and His Majesty King Husayn's role in achieving 
security and stability in the region and in pushing peace 
efforts forward. 
  Attending on the Jordanian side were the Jordanian 
ambassador 
in Ankara and a number of Foreign Ministry officials. Attending 
on the Turkish side were the Turkish ambassador in Amman and 
members of the accompanying delegation.

<F P=106> [By JORDAN TIMES staff reporter, P. V. Vivekanand] </F>
  [Text] Amman--A senior Turkish official held high-level 
talks here Monday [11 April] on the Middle East peace process 
and bilateral relations and said later Ankara attaches much 
importance to developing economic cooperation among the 
countries of the Middle East. 
  Ozdem Sanberk, under-secretary of the Turkish Foreign 
Ministry, said his talks here also covered the strife in former 
Yugoslavia as well as the implications for Turkey and Jordan of 
the continuing international sanctions against Iraq. 
  "Since Jordan plays a crucial role in the ongoing Middle 
East 
peace process, the Jordanian side elaborated in detail this 
particular issue," Mr. Sanberk told the Jordan Times after talks 
with Prime Minister 'Abd al-Salam al-Majali and Minister of 
State for Foreign Affairs Talal al-Hasan. 
  Describing the talks as very fruitful, the Turkish official 
said there were "no problems whatsoever between Turkey and 
Jordan on the bilateral level," and that "we noted with 
satisfaction that our visas concerning the international as well 
as regional issues are widely coverging." [sentence as published] 
  The Jordan News Agency, Petra, said Minister al-Hasan and 
Mr. 
Sanberk reviewed progress in the peace process and the 
implementation of U.N. Security council resolutions 242 and 338. 
  Mr. al-Hassan briefed Mr. Sanberk on the continued siege on 
the Port of al-'Aqabah and reaffirmed Jordan's call for an end 
to the damaging inspections of all ships bound for Jordan. 
  In his interview with the JORDAN TIMES, Mr. Sanberk restated 
his country's stand that Iraq should abide by United Nations 
Security Council resolutions. "Iraq must adopt a clear stand to 
give confidence to her neighbour Kuwait," he said. 
  At the same time, he said, the embargo on Iraq continues to 
hurt the people of Iraq. 
  "It has also created a very heavy economic burden for 
Turkey," said the official, whose country has been calling for 
an easing of the sweeping 44-month-old international sanctions 
against its neighbour. 
  "The same problem also exists for Jordan," he said of the 
impact of the sanctions. "We hope that the point for lifting the 
embargo would be reached soon. Cooperation between Iraq and the 
U.N. must be intensified to this end. 
  "The U.N. long-term monitoring programme (of Iraq's weapons) 
must be put fully into practice without delay and be effectively 
implemented in order that the oil embargo is lifted," he said. 
  Answering a question, the Turkish official said the outcome 
of recent municipal elections in Turkey where Islamic activisits 
put up a strong showing had no impact on the secular principles 
that the country was founded on. 
  "in the modern Turkey founded by Ataturk, Turks are devout, 
as always, and the religion is perceived as an individual 
choice, an individual realisation of oneself," he said. 
  "Islam is not reduced in its political dimentions and... the 
results (of the elections) reflect not the religious expression 
of the individuals but their political preferenes within the 
normal functioning of a multiparty democratic system," Mr. 
Sanberk said. 
  He said Turkey, which is waging a war against the separatist 
Kurdish Labour Party (PKK) in the southeast, wanted "her 
partners and neighbours to abide by their commitments not to 
give shelter to those who resort to indiscriminate separatist 
violence." 
  The official conceded that the Kurdish problem has led to 
disputes between Turkey and some of the European countries which 
have accused Ankara of violating human rights in its battle 
agaisnt the PKK. 
  But, he said, several countries have in Europe as well as 
the 
U.S. itself "declared (the PKK) a terrorist organisation," and 
France and Germany had banned PKK activities in their 
territories. 
  "It is obvious that terrorism is a gross violation of human 
rights and is aimed at the same time at the destruction of 
fundamental aspects of freedom and democracy," he said. 
  Mr. Sanberk said Turkey expects the Middle East peace 
process 
to create a better atmosphere for regional economic cooperation. 
  In this a context, he said, a "peace pipeline" 
project--which 
will bring Turkish water to the Gulf states and others in the 
region--"is still on the table." 
  "It can only be materialised should the countries of the 
region see its realisation in their interest and effectively 
participate in their realisation," added Mr. Sanberk, in an 
apparent reference to the financing needed for the project. 
  When it was first proposed several years ago, the project 
was 
estimated to cost about $12 billion. Revised estimates put the 
cost at between $15 million and $20 million [numbers as 
published]. 
  In Ankara on Monday, visiting Israeli Foreign Miniter Shimon 
Peres said Turkish and Israeli experts would look into the 
possibility of various projects for the shipment of water from 
Turkey to Israel. One idea is that water from Manavgat River 
could be carried in plastic containes and floated on the 
Mediterranean to Israel.

affairs, at noon today received Marc Perron, deputy secretary 
general of the Canadian Foreign Ministry, who is the head of the 
working group on refugees, and his delegation. The delegation 
is currently on a fact-finding mission in the region to become 
acquainted with the conditions of the Palestinian refugees in 
their host countries in coordination with the UNRWA. 
  The minister briefed the Canadian official on the latest 
developments in the peace process and the central role of 
Jordan, under the leadership of His Majesty King Husayn, in 
advancing the peace process in accordance with the principles of 
international legitimacy, on which basis the process was 
launched. These principles were represented in Resolutions 242 
and 338. 
  The minister also explained the burden on Jordan as a result 
of the siege imposed on the Port of al-'Aqabah, and stressed 
that this subject should be given special attention and that a 
solution should be found to it in light of Jordan's commitment 
to the relevant international resolutions. 
  The minister also spoke about the additional burden Jordan 
bears in its capacity as the country hosting the largest number 
of Palestinian refugees, and stressed the need to reach a just 
and acceptable solution for their problems in accordance with 
the relevant international resolutions. 
  For his part, Perron praised the Jordanian efforts 
concerning 
the refugees in particular, and the role Jordan plays in the 
peace process in general. He expressed understanding for the 
difficulties and burden Jordan is facing, and emphasized the 
importance of making efforts to help reach a solution to the 
refugees problem in its humanitarian and political dimensions. 
  The meeting was attended by Marwan Dudin, member of the 
Jordanian delegation to the peace talks, and the Canadian 
ambassador in Amman.

  [Text] Beirut, April 12 (AFP) -- Lebanon is to ask for the 
extradition of Christian opposition leader Michel 'Awn living in 
political asylum in France, Labour Minister 'Abdallah al-Amin 
said on Tuesday [13 April]. 
  Al-Amin, a pro-Syrian, warned ties between the two countries 
could worsen if the request was turned down and blamed "certain 
French cabinet ministers for being responsible for the death of 
Lebanese people because of their support for 'Awn." 
  He did not name the ministers but told the London-based 
AL-HAYAH newspaper received in Beirut "they are trying to 
destroy what is left of French-Lebanese relations." 
  Al-Amin, who last year headed the Lebanese branch of the 
Syrian ruling Ba'th Party, said the ministers' stance did not 
reflect official French policy. 
  General 'Awn headed a military government in the late 1980s 
until he was driven out of the presidential palace in 1990 in a 
joint Syrian-Lebanese offensive. 
  He was given refuge at the French embassy in Lebanon and was 
banished the following year to France, where he was given 
political asylum on condition he avoided any political activity, 
including political statements. 
  But in a recent interview with AL-HAYAH, 'Awn blasted the 
Beirut government and voiced support for a federation in Lebanon.

  [Text] Beirut, April 13 (AFP)--Exiled Christian opposition 
leader Michel 'Awn has called for factions opposed to the 
Syrian-backed Lebanon government to set up a congress in Paris, 
in a move which could sour relations with France. 
  The congress would pave the way for a "legitimate 
representative body for the Lebanese people because it is now 
impossible to organise any political activity in Lebanon to 
confront the occupation," General 'Awn told AL-NAHAR newspaper 
on Wednesday [13 April]. 
  "As long as Syria maintains its presence in Lebanon, the 
country's stability will be in jeopardy," 'Awn was quoted as 
saying by AL-NAHAR. 
  Supporters of 'Awn said the renegade Lebanese army general 
announced earlier this month that a committee was to be set up 
to prepare for a "Liberation and Renewal" congress to be held in 
Paris on June 11. 
  A government official told AFP any political activity by 
'Awn 
would be a clear violation of an agreement with France, which 
has granted him political asylum since 1991. 
  Lebanon feels that France is not respecting its engagements 
and the relations between the two countries could suffer, said 
the official who declined to be identified. 
  On Tuesday Lebanese pro-Syrian Labour Minister 'Abdallah 
al-Amin said Lebanon was planning to ask France to extradite 
'Awn, warning ties could worsen if Paris turned down the request. 
  'Awn was granted political asylum in France after he was 
banished from Lebanon in 1991, on condition he avoided any 
political activity. 
  The Lebanese army officer led a military government in the 
late 1980s that had refused to step down after presidential 
elections. He had fought Syrian troops in a "war of liberation." 
  But 'Awn was driven out of the presidential palace in a 
joint 
Syrian-Lebanese offensive, ordered to stay out of Lebanon and 
refrain from political activity until 1996. 
  Syria maintains some 35,000 troops in Lebanon, where Israel 
also occupies a self-declared "security zone" along the 
international border.

  [Text] Beirut, April 13 (AFP)--A Lebanese court has 
sentenced to death two Syrian soldiers and a Lebanese fugitive 
for the 1992 murder of two Lebanese Christian brothers, court 
officials said Wednesday [13 April]. 
  The sentence, which cannot be appealed, was the first to be 
issued by the Court of Justice since the 1970s. 
  It comes after the government decided last month to 
reactivate capital punishment in Lebanon. 
  The soldiers 'Abd-al Karim Jeij and Muhammad Zaatar had been 
handed over by Syria to Lebanese authorities as part of the 
investigation into the murder of jewellers Ghassan and Jalil 
Antonios. 
  The soldiers were not present in court when the verdict was 
announced on Tuesday. 
  Lebanese fugitive Nehme Hamade lives in Belgium, which has 
refused a Lebanese request to extradite him. 
  On March 11 parliament voted in a law bringing in the death 
penalty for political crimes and scrapping an extenuating 
circumstances clause which had exempted politically-motivated 
crimes. 
  The vote was part of a package of measures by the government 
to tighten security and legal procedures following a church 
bombing in February which killed 10 people and wounded 54 others. 
  The death penalty, always by hanging, has only been applied 
three times in the past 35 years in Lebanon. The last execution 
was carried out in 1983.

Ambassador to Lebanon Mark Hambley in his office today. They 
discussed the general political situation in Lebanon and the 
Middle East peace talks. They exchanged views on current media 
issues. Minister Samahah described the meeting as very friendly, 
noting that the ambassador expressed support for the Lebanese 
Government's course. Samahah said: 
  [Begin recording] [Samahah] We exchanged views on current 
media issues, the political situation in the country, and the 
Middle East negotiations cosponsored by the U.S. Government and 
Russia. The negotiations are continuing in various forms in 
Washington. Regarding the media issue, the ambassador asked 
about latest developments. We had a quiet discussion on the 
issue. The ambassador showed complete understanding of the 
Lebanese Government's measures. He encouraged the government's 
efforts to apply the law, respect the principles of the 
Constitution and freedoms, put things in order through the 
measures, bylaws, the amendment of Decree No. 104, the audio and 
visual media law, and the inclination toward plurality through 
the Cabinet's instructions to the committee tasked with 
preparing the draft media law. The ambassador showed full 
understanding in his response to these measures. The atmosphere 
of the meeting was very friendly, almost [as heard] supportive 
of the government approach and measures that emphasize 
maintaining the institutions and homeland and implementing the 
law. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Walid Junblatt, minister of refugee affairs, </F>
by an unidentified correspondent on 12 April; place not given] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] Your Excellency: Yesterday you 
announced the closing down of Voice of the Mountain radio. Why 
did you make this decision? 
  [Junblatt] The decision is in line with the government 
decision to reorganize the audio and visual media. The reasons 
that led to the establishment of Voice of the Mountain in 1983 
or 1984 no longer exist today. They were political, military, 
regional and other reasons that have ceased to exist. 
  [Correspondent] You mean it will be closed down for good? 
  [Junblatt] I believe it will be for good, because Voice of 
the Mountain is not just a radio that broadcasts musical or 
non-musical radio. It is a political radio. Now since all the 
political voices will be represented in the official media, that 
is, the official radio and television, there is no reason to 
keep Voice of the Mountain. I do not believe there are 
political reasons that necessitate the existence of private 
radios that belong to parties or sects. At the extraordinary 
cabinet meeting yesterday, we discussed the issue of 
reorganizing the audio and visual media. I pointed out that it 
is impossible in Lebanon to have a single media service, namely, 
the state media, because this is against the nature of the 
Lebanese and against the age. In the meantime, it is impossible 
to go back to the past media chaos, which posed political and 
security dangers and jeopardized the march of internal peace and 
the return of the refugees. Thus, I suggested that we follow 
the example of a democratic and civilized state such as France. 
In France, there are four or five television stations. I 
believe this is good. After all, we are not better than France. 
  [Correspondent] What do you think are the rules needed to 
tackle the media issue? 
  [Junblatt] There is a committee in charge of this. There are 
technical rules of which I am not expert, as well as political 
bases. In the end, citizens have the right to express their 
views through official channels. As I have already stated, a 
state-controlled media similar to some Arab media would be dull, 
impossible to apply in Lebanon, and would run counter to the 
nature of the political pluralism in Lebanon. We seek media 
pluralism that allows for an effective state control and 
partnership, up to 51 percent or more [of the capital], to 
prevent parties and sects from controlling the media once again. 
In addition, to allow four or five television channels to 
operate in the country, as is the case in France, with the 
participation of the private sector on economic, not political 
or sectarian, foundations. For instance, it would not be 
permitted for a representative of one of the sects to say that 
this is the Druze, Maronite, Shiite, or Sunni television 
station. There are economic rules. It could take the form of a 
joint-stock company. However, I stress the importance of the 
state's partnership as a form of control. 
  [Correspondent] To what extent do you want the state's 
control? 
  [Junblatt] There are specific rules that the information 
minister is working on. This is because media, political, and 
cultural control is a must. Today the country is living with 
the tunes of Maria [name indistinct] and others, an example of 
the moral decay that comes from we don't know where. This is 
disgraceful. Add to this the modern Egyptian films modeled 
after the soap opera Dallas. We must not impose such of 
cultural decay on the people. We must upgrade the standards, 
and I believe that the information minister, backed by a 
committee of his choosing, is qualified to undertake this job. 
  [Correspondent] Do you believe that the amendments 
introduced 
to the Publication Decree 104 yesterday [word indistinct] public 
and private [word indistinct] 
  [Junblatt] I believe so.

<F P=106> [Report by Salim Yassine] </F>
  [Excerpt] Beirut, April 13 (AFP)--The Lebanese government 
has eased restrictions on the country's private media in the 
face of mounting criticism and a threat by parliament to hold a 
debate on freedom of expression. 
  One week after adopting an amendment to a draft bill 
providing for the preventive suspension of publications and 
detention of journalists ahead of any court judgment, the 
government on Monday back-pedalled. 
  It decided to scrap the restrictions and reduced by half 
fines proposed last week against publications which carried 
stories deemed libelous to the head of state and presidents of 
friendly countries. 
  The respected AL-NAHAR daily said in a banner headline on 
Tuesday: "The government retracts: The press triumphs" -- words 
which summed up the satisfaction in newsrooms across Beirut. 
  The restrictions against the press triggered an outcry in 
newspapers, at the press syndicate and in parliament where 
dozens of MPs signed a petition calling on parliament to open a 
debate on freedom of expression. 
  The government also eased a ban imposed two weeks ago on 
private radio and television stations. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Marj'uyun, Lebanon, April 13 (AFP)--Four militiamen 
were wounded on Wednesday [13 April] in a bomb attack on a 
patrol in south Lebanon, a spokesman for Israel's proxy South 
Lebanon Army (SLA) said. 
  Two of the SLA militiamen were in a serious condition and 
were flown by helicopter to Israel, the spokesman said. 
  The roadside bomb exploded as the patrol was driving along 
just outside Marj'uyun, the headquarters of the Israeli army and 
SLA militia in south Lebanon. 
  It was the first such attack in four years in that area of 
Israel's self-declared "security zone", a security source said. 
  The SLA militia has been the target of repeated bomb and 
artillery attacks in recent months, claimed by anti-Israeli 
guerrillas, namely the Iranian-backed Hizballah. 
  In March, 12 SLA militiamen were killed and 25 others 
wounded 
in these attacks, the heaviest toll for several years.

  [Text] The postponement of the pope's visit to Lebanon was 
the focus of a meeting yesterday between President Ilyas 
al-Hirawi and His Eminence Shaykh Muhammad Mahdi Shams-al-Din, 
chairman of the Higher Islamic Shiite Council. Shaykh 
Shams-al-Din said: We expressed our regret over the 
postponement of the pope's visit, which all Lebanese welcomed 
and prepared for to ensure its success. He said: We have 
already expressed our regret and repeat it now. He added: We 
pray to God almighty that the pope's circumstances will allow 
him to visit. He said: From this forum, the home of all 
Lebanese, from the Presidential Palace, I repeat my wish that 
his holiness will visit Lebanon as soon as possible because the 
Lebanese people strongly desire to see this visit take place. 
Also, the Lebanese Government wants the pope to visit. 
President al- Hirawi has just expressed the same desire and 
urges the pope to visit Lebanon as soon as possible. We hope 
the competent departments in the Vatican will continue to 
prepare for the visit and reconsider the decision postponing the 
visit. He called on those who question Lebanon's unity to stop 
putting this unity to the test, stressing that Lebanon's unity 
is safe and has passed every test. He emphasized that Lebanon 
is too secure for any attempt to fragment and divide it.

<F P=106> [Article by Robert Fisk: "Palestine the Deal Revealed"] </F>
  [Text] Yasir 'Arafat's chief negotiator to the PLO-lsraeli 
peace talks, Nabil Sha'th, is used to receiving unusual 
visitors. But the group of blue-suited, middle-aged men who 
walked into the second-floor office of the PLO's grubby 
apartment block in Cairo's Mudiriyat al-Tahrir Street on 
Thursday night was unique. For the first time a joint US 
Defence and State Department delegation was paying an official 
visit to the PLO to assess the amount of military assistance 
Washington could provide for 'Arafat's fledgling "Palestine" 
police force. 
  The talks were as friendly as they were unprecedented. Over 
bananas and sweet tea, the Americans agreed to provide the PLO's 
police commander, General 'Abd-al Razzaq al-Yahya, with almost 
200 military vehicles, from pick-up trucks to 2.5 ton "Blazer" 
jeeps, which the PLO will use on joint patrols with Israeli 
troops in the Gaza Strip. Already, the PLO has arranged to 
purchase several dozen Russian armoured vehicles with which to 
control the slivers of "Palestine" ceded to it under the 
agreement sealed by that nervous handshake of Yasir 'Arafat and 
Yitzhaq Rabin on the White House lawn on 13 September last year. 
  Yet the Americans found the Palestinian negotiators in a 
curious frame of mind -- frustrated and angry rather than 
ecstatic at the prospect of entering their "homeland" for the 
first time in a quarter of a century. Aware that Palestinians 
in the occupied territories are coming to regard them as 
traitors rather than liberators, the PLO officials seemed to be 
tearful of the future, convinced the Israeli Prime Minister, Mr 
Rabin, by postponements and delay, was trying to "crack" 
'Arafat, to break him to acceptance of every Israeli demand in 
the occupied territories. On the face of it, secret agreements 
between the PLO and the Israelis, details of which were given to 
the Independent on Sunday last week, are impressive. 
  1. A Palestinian police force of at least 6,500 men, 
equipped 
with up to 9,000 Kalashnikov rifles and around 100 machine-guns. 
They may bring with them into Gaza and Jericho between 30,000 
and 35,000 family members -- the first substantial "return" of 
Palestinians since the catastrophe that overwhelmed them in 1948. 
  2. A system of new "lateral" east-west roads in Gaza, 
jointly 
patrolled by Israelis and Palestinians, along which settlers may 
travel to and from Israel; the elimination of all Israeli fixed 
military positions outside Jewish settlements in Gaza; and PLO 
control of almost 90 per cent of the Gaza Strip. 
  3. Four "safe-passage" roads between Jericho and Gaza, for 
all Palestinians wishing to travel between the two cities. This 
includes freedom of movement for Palestinians on roads through 
the State of Israel as well as the occupied West Bank. 
  4. Provision for up to 80,000 Palestinians exiled after the 
1967 Arab-lsraeli war to return to Jericho and Gaza, each 
applicant to be vetted by a joint Egyptian-Jordanian 
lsraeli-Palestinian committee. 
  5. Rules of engagement and conduct for PLO and Israeli 
security forces in Gaza and Jericho, governed by written 
instructions on the use of firearms, and agreements to prevent 
PLO and Israeli forces firing at each other. 
  6. An interim one-week "joint deployment" operation, during 
which PLO forces will take over from the Israelis, the two sides 
spending seven days alongside each other to avoid a military 
vacuum. The PLO police advance guard would arrive seven days 
before "Z-Day", as the PLO calls it -- the final 'Arafat-Rabin 
signature on the "interim phase" of the peace process. The full 
deployment of PLO police would be completed within 14 days after 
Z-Day. 
  7. A PLO-lsraeli "Joint Security Committee" with three 
coordination offices in Gaza City, the Khan Younis refugee camp 
in the Gaza Strip, and in Jericho, which will arrange joint 
security force mobile patrols -- usually one PLO and one Israeli 
vehicle on "lateral" roads in Gaza and other places of joint use. 
  Given the complexity of the arrangements, Sha'th's anger at 
Israeli delays last week may have been understandable. But 
there are deeper reasons for the PLO's depression. In the 
corner of Sha'th's Cairo office, for example, there is a 
three-foot stack of documents and maps which show just how far 
the talks still have to go before the PLO can take over Jericho 
and that part of Gaza which the Israelis will allow it to 
administer. 
  By this weekend, for example -- just four days before the 
deadline which both sides regarded as sacred last September -- 
the PLO and Israelis had still not agreed on the exact size of 
the Jericho enclave to be controlled by the PLO, nor the number 
of Palestinian paramilitary police the Israelis will eventually 
permit into Jericho and Gaza. The "safe passage" arrangements 
which Palestinians need to travel along the four agreed roads 
between Jericho and Gaza remain unclear. So does the legal 
jurisdiction of either side over settlers and Palestinians in 
each other's territories. And there is still no agreement on 
the system of courts which each side must administer, along with 
arrangements for the apprehenslon of Palestinians or Israelis 
suspected of criminal activity inside or outside the autonomous 
areas. For the Palestinians as well as for the Israelis, 
however, the greatest bone of contention is the continued 
existence of the Israeli settlements in Jericho and Gaza. 
  "Since we started these talks, we must have spent 80 percent 
of our entire time talking about nothing but the Jewish 
settlements," one PLO negotiator said last week. "They have been 
the single most important peace-breaker." 
  In retrospect, the talks were never going to be easy. The 
imbalance of the two parties -- an economically bankrupt and 
militarily impotent PLO versus an all-powerful Israel backed by 
the most pro-lsraeli US administration in a generation -- have 
been reflected in miniature among the negotiators. 
  Sha'th is a businessman and small-time publisher whose bald 
pate and spectacles make him look more like an impatient 
schoolmaster than a crafty statesman. His Israeli counterpart, 
Maj Gen Amnon Shahaq, is deputy chief of staff of the Israeli 
army. Old General al-Yahya -- the PLO's top military official 
at the talks -- has not seen his home town of Haifa since he 
fled as a 19-year old in 1948. His opposite number is the dapper 
Maj Gen Uzi Dayan, nephew of Israel's most famous soldier. 
  From the start of the talks at Taba on 13 October last year, 
the Israelis bore down on the PLO negotiators, astonishing 
Sha'th with territorial demands that would have left 47 per cent 
of the newly "autonomous" Gaza Strip still under direct Israeli 
military control. The PLO found that the Israelis wanted 
separate written agreements on every settlement in the Gaza 
Strip, some of them so small that only two dozen families lived 
there. "We spent days just negotiating the security of the 
settlement of Nezerim," one of the participants recalled last 
week. "There are only about 30 families in Nezerim but the 
Israelis demanded the right to establish new military positions 
on the Gaza beachfront to protect it, an entirely new road 
system connecting Nezerim to the Israeli border to the east, a 
special Israeli-PLO joint patrol system to protect Nezerim 
residents who wanted to play tennis in the settlement of Gush 
Katif or attend horse-riding classes there or who wanted to 
visit their friends." 
  The Israelis created, in the words of another PLO official 
"a 
monstrosity of systems to protect the settlers". Settlements, 
it was decided, would be regrouped in two main areas in Gaza: 
Gush Katif and another area in the north of the Gaza Strip, 
identified on the negotiators' maps as Erez. The Israelis then 
decided that the settlers should travel to Israel by three 
"lateral" roads (constructed west to east across the Strip) in 
order to avoid the highway that runs the length of Gaza. 
  At one point in these early talks, one of Sha'th's 
colleagues 
exploded in anger at the Israelis, calling their demands 
"utterly ridiculous" and asking why, in an area only 20 miles in 
length, settlers could not travel an extra 10 miles to Israel on 
the north-south highway rather than constructing three new 
roads. To the astonishment of the PLO the Israelis then 
proposed an Israeli- controlled zone lkm wide along the border 
of the Gaza Strip and a zone 1.2km wide along each of the new 
roads, together with five more military bases on these routes 
and along the Gaza beachfront, giving Israel 14 military camps 
in areas "controlled" by Palestinians outside the settlement 
zones. 
  When the Palestinian negotiators realised that under this 
plan, Israel would remain in control of 47 per cent of Gaza, 
they suspended the Taba talks. 'Amr Musa, the Egyptian Foreign 
Minister, flew to see Rabin in Jerusalem to complain. "Why are 
the Palestinians so angry?" Rabin is retorted to have replied. 
"This is only our first negotiating move!" Upon which the 
Israelis reduced their occupation of Gaza to 10 per cent of the 
territory, although the depth of an Israeli cordon sanitaire 
along the Gaza- Egyptian border is still being negotiated. PLO 
officials are also aware of the tenuous nature of their 
authority, something they have been unwilling to emphasise lest 
the true nature of Israel's power over the future Palestinian 
entity becomes apparent. 
  They have conceded, for example, that only Palestinians 
holding Jordanian or Egyptian identity papers may enter Gaza and 
Jericho as PLO policemen. Palestinians resident in Lebanon or 
Syria -- the principal focus of opposition to 'Arafat's 
agreement with Israel -- will be forbidden entry to the police. 
  Israel originally insisted that 'Arafat's "capital" of 
Jericho. should be only nine square kilometres in size. So 
Sha'th and his fellow negotiators slowly added new strips of 
land. They first demanded that two neighbouring refugee camps 
should come under the PLO's control, then the water resources in 
the hills to the west and the agricultural area around them. 
Then Sha'th said he wanted the Palestinian hamlet of 'Auja and 
its agricultural land, along with a right of passage for 
Palestinians to the Dead Sea and to the religious shrine of Nabi 
Musa. 
  The final size of Jericho, between 57 and 58 square 
kilometres, is to be decided at the pre-signing meeting of 
'Arafat and Rabin. But to their shock the Palestinians 
discovered last week that the Israelis have already started 
construction on a large new military base on the main road south 
of Jericho, scarcely a mile from the position that they will 
evacuate when the PLO takes over. 
  Aware that the Israelis are creating new "facts on the 
ground", Sha'th fell back on the argument that the actual size 
of Jericho did not matter because, once the PLO's control is 
extended into the rest of the West Bank, Jericho will "melt" 
into this area. 
  It is not difficult to see how 'Arafat's ever-growing army 
of 
opponents in the occupied territories will find fault with these 
arrangements. Far more delicate are the arrangements by which 
the PLO's police force will "co-ordinate" with the Israeli army. 
HAMAS [Islamic Resistance Movement] and the other radical 
Islamic groups opposed to the PLO accord claim that the PLO will 
become a branch of Israeli intelligence once the interim 
agreement comes into force. And it has indeed been agreed 
between the Israelis and the PLO that an intelligence officer 
from each side will take part in the weekly meetings of the 
Joint Security Committee. 
  Sha'th insists that their role will be purely "functional" - 
intended to keep the security role of the Israelis and PLO 
separate rather than united, with the Israeli Shin Beth officer 
and the PLO mukhabarat (intelligence) agent sitting down 
together, but operating independently of each other. 
  "This will be `non-friction' co-ordination," one of the PLO 
negotiators said. "It is to make sure that the two armies don't 
shoot at each other." But it will be difficult to convince 
Palestinians that this rule will be adhered to, especially if 
the Israelis are searching for wanted Palestinians. Even the 
court systems -- the jurisdiction which each side will have over 
its own citizens and the arrangements for dealing with serious 
acts of violence by either side -- have not yet been agreed upon. 
  The PLO's rules of engagement, set out in documents which 
have been shown to the Independent on Sunday, appear woefully 
inadequate. Armed Palestinian security forces may act, they say, 
in response to "an act or incident constituting a danger to body 
or property", provided the shooting "is aimed at 
preventing/terminating such an act or incident or at 
apprehending its perpetrators". 
  Firearms may not be used except "within the law (sic)" and 
"as a last resort" after "warning the perpetrators or shots in 
the air" have failed to halt wrongdoers. 
  So what if the Palestinians are confronted by thousands of 
Hamas demonstrators? Or by angry Israeli troops shooting at 
Palestinians on the edge of the "autonomous" area? Or if the 
Israelis are ambushed near the settlements and want to stage a 
military sweep through part of the autonomous area? Or if a 
settler is shooting at Palestinians, as Baruch Goldstein did in 
Hebron? What if the Israelis' nightmare -- a Katyusha rocket 
attack from "PLO" Gaza into Tel Ashqelon -- becomes a reality? 
  One of the most senior of Sha'th's negotiators claims there 
is no point in debating this. "None of what we are doing will 
work if it's not an irreversible march towards peace," he says. 
"There is only one guarantee against a Katyusha attack -- 
that's the commitment of the Palestinians themselves that this 
peace process is worthwhile. The only way to stop Katyushas is 
for every Palestinian to regard anyone who fires a Katyusha as 
an enemy of Palestinian independence. What we are doing is 
creating conditions that the Israelis would be stupid to 
reverse." 
  Creating those conditions however, is taking far longer than 
it should. Given the degree of hostility now facing 'Arafat in 
the occupied territories, many of the secret agreements may 
already be hostages to fortune. Over the past seven months, 
'Arafat has announced his imminent arrival in Jericho on four 
separate occasions; but on current progress (or lack thereof) 
the PLO chairman is unlikely to keep even his latest promise to 
turn up next month. As for Gaza, there are those among his 
negotiators who suspect he will need all the military vehicles 
he can lay his hands on -- American or Egyptian -- to protect 
himself from his own people there.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" report by Robert Fisk in Cairo and Annika </F>
Savill in Tunis: "Revealed: Deals at The Heart of Mid East 
Peace Plan"] 
  [Text] After a confidential meeting between United States 
officials and Palestinian negotiators in Cairo last week, the 
Americans have agreed to furnish the PLO's embryonic police 
force with military trucks and heavy Jeep Blazers in an effort 
to speed up the deployment of Palestinian security forces in 
Gaza and Jericho. 
  But details of the secret agreements reached between the PLO 
and the Israelis, disclosed to the INDEPENDENT ON SUNDAY, make 
it plain that the two sides have no hope of meeting Wednesday's 
Israeli withdrawal deadline -- and that a mass of unresolved 
details could still put back the PLO's takeover of Gaza City and 
Jericho by weeks. 
  Israel and the PLO have now agreed that a PLO police force 
comprising at least 6,500 men -- and up to a maximum of 9,000 -- 
will be deployed in the two cities armed with 9,000 Kalashnikov 
rifles 100 machine guns, and equipped with Egyptian-made 
armoured vehicles. 
  Between 30,000 and 35,000 family members will return to 
Palestine along with the police -- the first substantial 
"return" of Palestinians since 1948. A system of three new 
"settlers' roads" is to be built in Gaza to allow joint 
Israeli-Palestinian patrols to escort settlers to and from 
Israel. 
  A "Joint Security Committee" -- perhaps the most 
controversial aspect of the agreements reached so far -- will 
hold weekly meetings attended by representatives of the Israeli 
and the PLO's intelligence services, officially to prevent the 
two sides' security forces shooting at each other. 
  However, the INDEPENDENT ON SUNDAY has learned that, despite 
this progress --which also includes provision for 800,000 
Palestinians exiled in 1967 and their descendants to return to 
Jericho and Gaza -- the Israelis and the PLO have been unable to 
resolve a series of serious problems. 
  In an interview in Tunis this weekend, the PLO leader, Yasir 
'Arafat, threatened to withdraw from the peace process 
altogether if the Israelis did not stop what he called their 
manoeuvring. 
  "I offered all the flexibility and effort but the other side 
is not responding. I left my team in Cairo under orders to 
continue but I do not know if the Israelis will come back to 
finalise or to manoeuvre," he said of the talks that are to 
begin again today. 
  The two sides have still not agreed on the legal 
jurisdiction 
each side will have over Palestinians and settlers in the 
other's territory and the "safe passage" arrangements for 
Palestinians travelling between Jericho and Gaza. 
  They have failed to devise a court system or agreed rules of 
engagement that would allow Palestinian or Israeli security 
forces to defend their own citizens. No Palestinians from Syria 
or Lebanon are permitted to join the PLO's police, at least in 
the first phase of the deployment, and even the exact size of 
the PLO's area of control in Jericho -- at present about 57 
square kilometres -- has not been settled. 
  Nor can the advance party of the PLO's police enter Gaza and 
Jericho until seven days before Mr 'Arafat and the Israeli prime 
minister Yitzhaq Rabin, sign the "interim phase" autonomy 
agreement -- a date still so uncertain that Mr Arafat may have 
to break his promise to enter his "capital", Jericho, in a 
month's time.

<F P=106> [Exclusive interview with Shaykh Muhammad al-Ghazali, leader </F>
of Egypt's Islamic fundamentalists, by Peter Lennon, date and 
place not given] 
  [Text] When you arrive at the great Pyramid of Cheops, just 
a few miles outside Cairo, these days you are not going to be 
bothered by queues of tourists; the Sphinx, squatting alongside, 
is also short of admirers. In their bid for power, Islamic 
fundamentalist terrorists have fired on tourist buses and 
trains, killing four and wounding a score of visitors. Though 
relatively few in number-seven over two years -- these incidents 
have virtually destroyed Egypt's tourist industry. 
  Egypt is now looking fearfully at the experience of Algeria, 
which is being overwhelmed by Islamic terror, and at Turkey, 
where two weeks ago Islamic fundamentalists took over Istanbul 
and Ankara in local elections. 
  A figure, relatively unknown in the West, is now emerging in 
Egypt in the Islamic challenge to President Husni Mubarak. He 
is 77-year old Shaykh Muhammad al-Ghazali, a former mosque 
manager and professional Islamic proselytiser. Over the years 
he has worked in Iran, Kuwait and Algeria spreading the message 
of Islam. He received Saudi Arabia's FaIsal Prize for Services 
to Islam in 1989 and a state award from Pakistan in 1990. 
  Sheykh al-Ghazali achieved international notoriety last June 
when he appeared for the defence in the case of the two alleged 
assassins of the author Dr Faraj Foudah. Dr Foudah had been 
murdered by Islamic extremists after his work had been branded 
apostate. At the trial, al-Ghazali had declared that it was the 
duty of the government to carry out the death penalty on 
apostates; if it failed to do so, he made plain, he understood 
why others should feel entitled to carry out the sentence. 
  In his first interview with the foreign press in many years, 
al-Ghazali raised the stakes an unhealthy notch by declaring it 
might become his duty to "mobilise the people and overthrow the 
government". 
  We met in his spacious, but not ostentatious, apartment in 
Cairo, where the conversation began in the most philosophical 
and serene of tones. "Culture is the ocean in which we all 
live," he declared. "It is the ocean in which humanity lives. It 
has its crosscurrents. But we have no objections to seeing what 
your culture has to offer so long as this is done with a sense 
of truthfulness and honesty." 
  Al-Ghazali was accompanied by two watchful sons who 
monitored 
the translation. He is small of stature, with a rather cross 
expression but very courteous and candid. There is a certain 
heated intensity of manner when defending his faith and 
castigating the corruption of the West. He claimed to have been 
able to muster 300,000 faithful for his last oration. Even a 
third of this figure would be an intimidating congregation to 
make any president think. 
  His Excellency recalled the first flowering of Islamic 
civilisation when works by Plato, Aristotle and a whole range of 
Greek thinkers were translated into Arabic and there was a 
complementary flow of translations of Arab writers into European 
languages. But then we reached a dramatic moment. He had made 
it known through my interpreter that he would answer any 
question, so I brought up his public defence of the alleged 
assassins of Dr Foudah. "We find it very hard to understand," I 
said, "how a scholarly and cultivated person could be seen to be 
inciting ignorant people to take the law into their own hands." 
  Al-Ghazali denied he had incited anyone to kill. Indeed, he 
had declared in court that "if everyone did that there would be 
chaos". But in decribing what had happened in court he made his 
attitude towards apostates very clear. "I was not in court to 
issue fatwas," he said, "but as a witness. Faraj Foudah had 
denied the Rule of Islam to me personally in open debate at the 
Cairo book fair two years ago. Now a man is free to believe 
that if he wants to; he can go and sit at home and say it. But 
this man went out into the streets and worked against the Rule 
of Islam. This is unacceptable because it strengthens Zionism 
and colonialism and I am against anything that strengthens these. 
  "The prophet Muhammad, in his struggle with pagans, said to 
his companions: `Any one of you who wants to can go and join 
them. But do not physically stay amongst us if your heart is 
with those who do not accept the Rule of Islam'." 
  (Presumably so as not to over-tax the credulity of a 
Westerner, al-Ghazali used the term "Rule of Islam", whereas 
normally he would use a phrase which leaves no room for argument 
-- "Rule of God".) 
  What, I asked, would be his attitude to an Egyptian 
government which failed to carry out its duties towards Islam? 
"If it does not do so it is up to me to mobilise people to 
overthrow the government." 
  Was this an eventuality which he felt might arrive in the 
near future? Al-Ghazali laughed and said: "Why overthrow a 
government when you can organise elections and do it through the 
ballot box?" But were there free elections in Egypt? "You 
should be asking that question of the people who rig the ballot 
boxes." 
  Such an open accusation of political corruption would have 
resulted in instant arrest for a more modest citizen and 
subjection to the torture which a UN report for 1993 found has 
now become systematic for "political" suspects in Egypt. 
al-Ghazali is technically an employee of the government in his 
role of member of the influential Islamic Research Council. He 
was speaking, too, in a context in which life is becoming 
increasingly hazardous for President Mubarak and his ministers. 
Over the past two years there have been a number of attempted 
assassinations in Cairo: of the Prime Minister, last November, 
the Minister of the Interior in August and of an army general in 
July. The deputy governor of security in Asyut province was 
assassinated earlier. 
  But the terrorists are not now the most potent threat to 
Mubarak. A vigorous policy of shoot-to-kill and mass arrest has 
kept them in check. It is the "moderate" Muslim Brotherhood 
(tolerated but banned as a political party) which, inspired by 
the leaders of al-Azhar, appears to be nudging Egypt towards an 
Islamic state. 
  The government would have particular reason to be wary of 
al-Ghazali. A few months ago the Algerian Government accused 
him of having been instrumental in setting up the resistance 
movement FIS (Islamic Salvation Front) during the years he spent 
in Algeria. Al-Ghazali had said that in Egypt the state feared 
the label "Islam" because it was afraid of alienating the West. 
Was it simply afraid of losing its economic association with 
the West? "The Muslim world is in a state of military weakness 
and both economic and trading weakness. Therefore the question 
of whether there will be economic assistance or not is a way of 
maintaining that fear of the West." 
  But there were elements of European culture that they could 
accept, he said. "There is the scientific element. We support 
scientific progress and are willing partners in this. But there 
are philosophical standpoints which are unacceptable to us, such 
as atheism and communism. The third element is to do with 
stimulating desires, which we consider to be socially damaging 
and which we wish to contain." 
  I pointed out the fate of the Church in fundamentalist 
countries such as Ireland, where the inflexibility of Catholic 
leaders had resulted in its decline in modern times. "I would 
like to ask a question," he retorted. "If you Europeans have 
abandoned spiritual guidance is it required of me to do the 
same? I will answer No! 
  "I want my religion to be strong, because I want my nation 
to 
be strong, to be able to defend itself. We are militarily 
defeated, we are a defeated nation and the only way we can 
regain our strength and self-respect is through religion." 
  Following the turmoil in Algeria, if Egypt -- a vital 
secular 
ally of the West --were to be taken over by Islamic leaders 
there would be a catastrophic up-ending of Western influence in 
the Middle East. Playing the "moderate" card against the 
excesses of the terrorists, but also offering a contrast to a 
ruthless secular government, Islam appears to be winning over 
the Egyptian business class, traditional allies of the West who 
now see the need to protect their backs in the event of serious 
fundamentalists' gains. 
  However, if Shaykh al-Ghazali reinforces the West's image of 
lethal religious bigotry -- when you go out among the faithful 
at prayer at the al-Azhar Mosque, respond to good humoured 
stall- holders in the bazaars and ask guidance of helpful 
passers-by on the streets of Cairo -- you wonder where are the 
fanatic hordes who are seemingly poised to overwhelm Egypt and 
terrorise foreigners? 
  To persist in carrying the baggage of Western prejudice 
which 
depicts Arabs indiscriminately as bloodthirsty primitives, with 
an unholy will to carve up Westerners, is no help at all in 
understanding what is happening in Egypt. 
  While specifically making tourists targets has had 
spectacular success for the terrorists -- tourist operators 
simply won't risk booking tours to Egypt -- by European 
terrorist standards Egyptian extremists have a very modest 
record: only seven attacks on tourists spread over two years; 
four deaths. 
  There is a casual racism in the media's reporting on the 
Arab 
world (they are much more self-conscious about black nations) 
which attributes to an entire nation the excesses of its 
fanatics. But to brand the Egyptians with the mentality of the 
al-Jamaat al-Islamiyah is as logical as to have branded all 
Germans sympathisers of Baader-Meinhof. 
  The observable truth about Egyptians is that they deserve 
their reputation as the kindliest of the Arab nations. 
"Welcome!" they call out everywhere. "No. problem!" It's only 
occasionally motivated by the hope of selling you some jammy 
perfume. Mugging is simply not part of the mores of Cairo and 
the poor are far less importunate than their London 
counterparts. It was startling to discover that begging is 
rare. I was approached only three times in one week. If the 
kids pester, shyly, it is to have their photograph taken. 
  How soothing to be able to saunter around markets or the 
commercial areas, compared to walking the lugubrious gauntlet of 
the Strand or Leicester Square in London; it gives one's sense 
of guilt a rest. Since this inexplicable resignation of Cairo's 
citizens can have nothing to do with prosperity, it can only be 
attributed to pride. 
  Where then is the religious fanaticism which fuels the 
West's 
fears? Within the cloisters of al-Azhar certainly. 
  But at one point I was a guest of the hospitable clients of 
a 
sunken roadside cafe in a muddy souk in Old Cairo. Talking and, 
out of politeness, fastidiously simulating sucking the hookah, I 
began to suspect that these people might have simple and genuine 
faith but their religious fervour would probably hardly be of a 
quality superior to that of the deserving poor of Victorian 
England. Were they to rise in prosperity this would be 
transformed, by the example of the present ruling class, into 
taking shameless advantage of the more comfortable Western 
values while retaining any interdictions which might suit their 
authoritarian -- and commercial -- tastes. 
  The posture of disbelief and horror that the Christian West 
adopts before Islamic fundamentalism is often disingenuous, 
sometimes politically calculated. It is highly convenient in 
justifying support for a regime such as President Mubarak's, 
willing accomplice of Western business strategies whose benefits 
never reach down to the true faithful. 
  Like the Christian Church with its tradition of papal 
interdictions, puritanical censorship, proselytism, terrifying 
fatwas (whose gross inhumanity reaches"to an eternity in hell) 
and its willingness to bless men as they are sent to kill or die 
for remote sheep-keeping territory (the Falklands), Islamic 
fundamentalists are a body with the habit of power and 
long-nurtured taste for control. 
  If there is a vacuum, in the name of God they will fill it. 
The vacuum here is created by well-documented corruption and 
nepotism which flourished under Sadat and has reached plague 
proportions under Mubarak. It is now tangible in the very look 
of Cairo. With pavements which rarely seem to stretch five 
yards without collapse, the debris of reluctantly started or 
sloppily finished public works littering the city; fly-overs, 
heavily financed by Western aid, but built for cost-cutting, at 
such a low level over even main shopping streets that they are 
darkened and suffocated by a double dose of pollution, Cairo is 
a city which suggests a regime which treats its own cities with 
contempt. 
  The Emergency Laws, bypassing the Constitution, which 
Mubarak 
has maintained for 13 years, are not only used to fight 
terrorism; they have been manipulated by high officials to 
devour the vital 4 per cent of arable land for real estate which 
the Constitution, were it active, expressly protects. 
  Compared with secular interdictions, banning, censoring, and 
Mubarak's arsenal of edicts, backed up by arbitrary arrest, 
torture and, recently, direct pressure on the foreign press, the 
pious prohibitions of al-Azhar, restricted to religious matters, 
can seem rather gentlemanly. 
  Al-Azhar's authority can be defeated in a way impossible 
with 
aggressive secular measures. When, three years ago, a committee 
of shakhys from the university banned five books by an eminent 
judge, Sa'id Ashmawi, at the Cairo Book Fair, the judge 
threatened to sue them for exceeding their religious brief Not 
only were the books immediately returned; the university 
officially retracted its ban. 
  The present situation seems to be that not only the 
deserving 
poor but I much of the cheated middle class need a friend. They 
don't have it in the government. The poor therefore can be 
easily led or driven into turmoil. 
  That they have nothing much to lose in the fall of the 
present government is the people's consolation. That they may 
not achieve much material benefit under the care of religious 
leaders who largely exonerate themselves from such vulgar 
preoccupations is their probable future misfortune.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Hasan Jad-al-Haqq, Egyptian ambassador </F>
to Sudan, by unidentified correspondent in Cairo; date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] After the meeting between 
the Egyptian and Sudanese foreign ministers, do you believe that 
the atmosphere is now favorable for resuming the Hala'ib 
committee's work? And will you work to hold this meeting in 
Khartoum? 
  [Jad-al-Haqq] An invitation has been sent to the Egyptian 
foreign minister from Dr. Abu-Salih to visit Khartoum. The 
visit will take place at the right time. Without doubt contacts 
are being made so that the visit can be made and the committee's 
work resumed. That was among the aims of my meeting with 
Minister 'Amr Musa. 
  [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] Some people say that Musa is refusing to 
visit Khartoum while the present government is in power. What 
is your opinion? 
  [Jad-al-Haqq] That is not true at all. I stress that the 
foreign minister has accepted the invitation to visit Sudan, and 
he will make the visit at the right time, in view of his 
engagements and preoccupation in Cairo with following up the 
peace process and other issues. 
  [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] Did you sense real seriousness from the 
two sides in tackling the problems and transcending the current 
phase of disputes which has occurred in relations in the recent 
period? 
  [Jad-al-Haqq] I am always optimistic about surmounting any 
differences or sudden problems between the two countries. These 
problems are not difficult to solve. No problem is difficult to 
solve as long as there are sincere intentions and as long as the 
efforts are intensified. [passage omitted] 
  [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] Do you believe it is possible for the 
two sides to backtrack on the measures taken before the tension 
arose in relations -- both the measures taken by Sudan against 
the Egyptian education mission or the consulates, and those 
taken by Cairo against Hala'ib? 
  [Jad-al-Haqq] I can confirm that it is not in anyone's 
interests to harm relations between two fraternal peoples. Not 
only that: I also believe in our relationship with Sudan. It is 
a relationship of kinship. The people of Sudan are our kinfolk 
and relatives, and no one can sever the bond of kinship. We the 
present generation must safeguard this relationship. This 
generation in both Egypt and Sudan must safeguard what our 
ancestors achieved and cherished for us. 
  I can say that the unity of the Nile Valley and its people 
is 
the basis and foundation for the establishment, success, or 
continuation of any Arab unity or solidarity. Without doubt 
that is in the interests of the two fraternal peoples in Egypt 
and Sudan in view of the ties by which this region is 
characterized compared with other regions. 
  [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] How would you assess conditions in 
southern Sudan, especially in the light of what has been said 
about foreign endeavors and plans to separate it from the rest 
of the country and to establish a self-rule authority there? 
  [Jad-al-Haqq] I can confirm that there is no doubt about 
Egypt's foreign policy, as it is committed to safeguarding 
Sudan's unity, territorial integrity, and the unity of its 
people. 
  This is not limited to southern Sudan alone. It applies to 
all the Sudanese territory. It is a fixed and known position 
which stems from historic constants, namely commitment to 
safeguarding the territory and people of fraternal Sudan. 
  Not only does Egypt support Sudan, but also defends it 
against any attempts seeking to separate any part of Sudan's 
territory and fraternal people. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Cairo, 13 Apr (MENA) -- The newspaper AL-WAFD writes 
that the nondeterrent NATO strike against the Serbs allowed the 
Serbian reaction to be tyrannical and frightful. Using various 
types of weapons, the Serbian troops poured their wrath on the 
Muslims surrounded in Gorazde, the paper says. 
  In an editorial today, the mouthpiece of the opposition Wafd 
Party blames the UN Security Council for what is happening to 
the Bosnian Muslims, saying the UN resolutions lacked the 
necessary measures to deter the aggressors. 
  The paper expresses surprise at the stance by NATO, the 
owner 
of the biggest military force, which sent one plane once and two 
planes another time to attack Serbian positions. 
  It describes the American stance as insufficient, the 
international stance as feeble, and the Russian stance as odd, 
because it tolerates the slaughter of Muslims in Bosnia and 
threatens a fierce war if the air strikes against Serbs continue. 
  AL-WAFD notes that Russia's stance costs it the sympathy of 
the Third World, sympathy that it has gained over the years, 
because it is turning from a state that defends peace into a 
state that propagates war and the killing of innocent people.

<F P=106> [Report by 'Abd-al-Rahim 'Ali] </F>
  [Text] Forty-five armed units from Tanta, al-Mansurah, and 
Alexandria and 16 armored vehicles have arrived in Asyut and six 
vehicles have arrived in al-Minya to strengthen the security 
measures against the escalation of the Islamic groups' 
activities in the two governorates. 
  In the first armed confrontation between the people and 
terrorism, the inhabitants of Manfalut exchanged fire with three 
terrorists who were on their way to hiding on al-Ma'abidah 
Island. The three terrorists -- Khalid Quraysh, Muhammad 
'Abd-al-'Al, and Sahsah al-Manfaluti -- were killed. 
  In the ongoing struggle between the governor, the security 
organ, and the popular leaderships in the governorate, the 
latter are saying that the security organ has set up vigilante 
[al-matarid] groups and armed them with modern weapons to chase 
and kill the terrorists. They added that the Manfalut operation 
was the first one carried out by these groups. 
  The Islamic Group in al-Minya last Sunday distributed its 
first statement in four years. Masked youngsters carrying 
swords and axes distributed the statement which declared an end 
to the truce agreed on by the Islamic Group and the security 
forces. AL-AHALI had published on 26 December 1993 the 
agreement between the Islamic Group and the security organ in 
al-Minya and Suhaj. Sunday's statement warned that the Islamic 
Group will resume the struggle.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Congress Confirms, Socialist Party </F>
Denies Attempt on Aden Governor Life"] 
  [Excerpt] Sanaa, London, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Sources close 
to Brigadier General Salih Munsir al-Siyayli, governor of Aden, 
yesterday denied recent reports of an attempt on his life during 
which he sustained serious injuries, prompting him to travel 
abroad, where he was admitted to an intensive care unit. 
  Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] sources have said that 
al-Siyayli is carrying out his duties and is available in his 
residence every evening with a number of his advisers in the 
governorate. Informed sources had confirmed the report about 
the injury of the Aden governor, who is the strongest YSP 
opponent to the General People's Congress' policy. 
  AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT contacted al-Siyayli's house, and one of 
his aides said he was in the house holding a meeting with more 
than 30 people. He said that "if he had been subjected to any 
harm, the situation would have been different." 
  Sanaa sources linked these reports with Salih al-Siyayli's 
disappearance and failure to attend the meetings held over the 
past days by Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Beirut, 12 Apr (MENA)--Arab League Secretary 
General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid has criticized Israel's lack of 
commitment to implementing the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration 
of Principles and withdrawing from Gaza and Jericho on the date 
set for doing so, that is, 13 April. 
  In an exclusive statement to MENA in Beirut, he said that 
this Israeli reasoning is unacceptable and Israel has to respect 
the agreement and withdraw on the dates set down in the 
agreement. 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid rejected the Israeli claims that these 
dates are not sacred, adding: Otherwise, why would the 
agreement mention them? No Arab negotiator can accept this. He 
stressed that the dates are sacred and must be respected. 
  The Arab League secretary general said that Israel's 
noncompliance with these agreements will affect the Washington 
negotiations. He expressed fear that Israel would lose its 
credibility in the agreements that it will conclude. He stressed 
the need to continue the peace negotiations despite the 
difficulties, adding that the continuation of the negotiations 
is necessary to restore our legitimate rights. He also stressed 
that peace is not a gift from Israel to the Arab countries and 
that the peace being asked from the Arab countries is also asked 
from Israel, which will benefit more from it; this imposes on it 
commitments that it must implement and respect. 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid called on the Security Council to be fair 
in implementing its resolutions and not to have double standards 
when it comes to implementing the resolutions that represent 
international legitimacy and which include Resolution 425, which 
demands an unconditional Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon. 
  On the future of his own initiative to bring about Arab 
reconciliation, the Arab League secretary general said: The Arab 
countries must get together in solidarity to unite ranks and 
positions. He noted that his initiative aimed at achieving Arab 
solidarity based on a common basis despite the differences among 
some Arab countries. 
  He added: I stressed in my initiative that we should be 
frank 
before we have reconciliation. This does not mean that we 
should forget the past as if nothing had happened but whoever 
did wrong must rectify his error so that we can turn over a new 
leaf that will achieve unity in the Arab destiny. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] Strasbourg, April 13 (AFP) -- PLO Chairman Yasir 
'Arafat Wednesday [13 April] condemned attacks against "innocent 
Israelis" in a speech to the European Parliament here, after six 
people were killed in a bomb attack. 
  He was talking after learning that a bomb had exploded on a 
bus at station north of Tel Aviv, killing six Israelis and 
injuring 21 others. 
  Arafat said: "These attacks are just targeting innocent 
people on both sides, Israelis and Palestinians, and do nothing 
but strike at the heart of the peace process." 
  "All extremist forces on both sides, Israeli and 
Palestinian, 
have thrown themselves into a kind of escalation which cannot be 
halted." 
  The Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas claimed responsibility 
for the attack saying it was the second of five planned to 
avenge February's mosque massacre in Hebron. 
  Police spokesman Arik Ben Chen told AFP the bomb exploded 
near the back door of the Afula to Tel Aviv bus at Hadera, 45 
kilometres (27 miles) north of Tel Aviv. The attack happened on 
Israel's memorial day for its fallen soldiers.

<F P=106> [Report on an "exclusive" interview with PLO Executive </F>
Committee Chairman Yasir 'Arafat by the AL-BILAD political 
editor in Amman; date not given] 
  [Text] Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat], why are you here in 
Amman? I mean what is your agenda here in Jordan? I addressed 
this apparently provocative question to the Palestinian 
president, who came to Amman on a short working visit of less 
than 24 hours. He answered: I am always here. I got used to 
traveling. I am here in Amman based on a mutual desire on my 
part and on the part of His Majesty King Husayn. Hakam Bal'awi 
was told this when he visited Amman last week with a message 
from the Palestinian leadership. 
  I said: The press reported that Bal'awi's visit was a 
failure. 
  He replied: The press is hallucinating. Did you not hear 
brother Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali's reply to the reporters who 
said Bal'awi's visit was unsuccessful? It was a successful 
visit crowned by his majesty's meeting with the Palestinian 
envoy. The envoy explained our view toward insisting on raising 
the question of Jerusalem within the context, and at the heart, 
of Security Council Resolution 904. Jordan has shown 
understanding of our position despite its previous reservations. 
I must note here King Husayn's efforts by contacting several 
Arab kings and presidents and President Clinton regarding this 
question to contain any complications. After all, we are 
working for the same cause. It is true that Jerusalem is the 
capital of Palestine. But it is also of interest to Arabs, 
Muslims, and Christians, since it is the cradle of Jesus Christ, 
the first of the two prayer directions, the third holiest 
shrine, and the destination of Prophet Muhammad's nocturnal 
journey. As King Husayn always says, there can be no peace 
without Jerusalem. It is the gate of peace. We will not and 
cannot abandon it. There is no one on earth who would bargain 
over Jerusalem. 
  [AL-BILAD] What was the result of your visit to Amman? 
  ['Arafat] Success, understanding, and continuation of our 
joint march in order to achieve what we are seeking. I agreed 
with King Husayn and the prime minister to intensify 
consultations and devise a better mechanism for our contacts. 
  [AL-BILAD] But the Jordanians and Palestinians this 
unfruitful formula of coordination, which is apparently 
inefficient. [sentence as published] This is clear in the 
differences in views that emerge. 
  ['Arafat] Our journey is long and we must have endurance, 
only impatient people get bored. I want to say that our cause 
is complex and is affected, more than other issues, by local, 
regional, and international factors. This is why our tactics 
appear to be contradictory. This might be true. However, the 
results we seek to achieve are the same -- removing the 
occupation and the return of security and stability to our 
region. This will happen after the Palestinian people, just 
like their brothers, secure their independence and freedom and 
establish their independent state. This state will have a 
special, equal relationship with Jordan to be defined by the two 
brotherly peoples through their legislative institutions or 
through a public referendum. This is what we are seeking. 
Anything said otherwise is merely conjecture. 
  [AL-BILAD] It is said that you want relations with Egypt 
that are stronger than relations with any other country. 
  ['Arafat] Why not? Egypt is an Arab country that has weight 
and influence, but this should not be at the expense of our 
relations with anyone else. Cairo today is a crossing point and 
mechanism [for implementing the Oslo agreement], and it has 
strong relations with Israel, the U.S. sponsor, and other 
parties, in addition to its role and status, so I have to 
benefit from it and from its role, which it is playing in the 
best manner. 
  I said to President 'Arafat: But there are some flaws in 
coordination with Jordan. 
  He replied by saying: This may be true, but it is not 
deliberate. The quick developments, the interlinking of courses 
and interests, and an important factor that we should not 
overlook -- the interference of third parties that have no 
interest in the Jordanian-Palestinian relations and 
understanding -- all contribute. This is seen in the press in 
Jordan and abroad. For example the visit to Jordan by Hakam 
Bal'awi. Published reports indicated that the visit was a 
failure although this was incorrect. So, in whose interest are 
such inaccurate reports published? I think you published 
reports that are different from what the others did. 
  I interrupted the president and said: Does this mean that 
you are acquainted with what AL-BILAD published? 
  He replied: Of course, I do not miss anything, including 
slander and charges of treason. I reply to those who make such 
charges by saying: O God forgive some of my people because they 
do not know, but some others, as I know, have motives, and a 
third group has motives for which they are paid. 
  Jordan, my brother, is a country that is unfairly treated, 
and I know the size of the pressure employed against it. Even 
wide sectors of Jordanians do not know the size of the pressure 
and temptations. When King Husayn was in Washington, they 
offered him billions to accept a peace treaty with Israel, but 
he refused. He is paying the price -- the price of his faith 
and principled position. 
  [[AL-BILAD] Are you optimistic about the future? 
  ['Arafat] I have no doubts about the future. I am a faithful 
man and I learned politics from history. As you know, history 
has a price, and he who studies the history of our people knows 
that our people have paid a high price represented in the best 
of their sons and leaders. The result of their sacrifices is 
the Israeli acceptance of the principle of withdrawal and 
settlement. Look around you. Everything is in Israel's favor: 
The international and Arab situation, the balance of power, and 
the sieges imposed upon us. All these things serve the 
objective of Grater Israel on all of Palestinian territories, 
but what happened changed that. Today we are restoring what we 
lost yesterday. We are not to blame for what we lost. There 
are several factors that forces these options. We are stubborn 
people and cannot relax until the occupation is over and until 
our people get their full rights to freedom and independence. 
God willing, this will be realized in stages. 
  At this point, the interview, which was interrupted several 
times, came to an end. President 'Arafat promised us of another 
broader and more comprehensive interview in spite of his 
reservations as a result of AL-BILAD's hostile attitude toward 
the Palestinian leadership as he put it. 
  We in AL-BILAD emphasize that there is no hostile attitude 
toward the Palestinian leadership. Our motives are the public 
interest and our respect for the profession, nothing more.

  [Excerpts] Six were killed and about 25 slightly injured 
in an explosion inside a bus during a boarding interval in the 
Hadera central bus station. The No. 820 bus was on its way from 
'Afula to Tel Aviv. 
  It is believed that Arabs, who boarded the bus at one of the 
stops, left the bomb on the bus. Another theory says the 
perpetrator was a suicide terrorist. [passage omitted] 
  Our correspondent Yo'av Aviv adds that there has been a 
second explosion on the bus, this time apparently a planned 
blast activated by bomb disposal experts, who found another 
bomb. The Hadera central bus station has been closed off, and 
local inhabitants are staging a demonstration nearby, calling 
out anti-Arab slogans. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Press review] </F>
  [Text] The newspaper TISHRIN comments on the U.S. 
Administration's announcement of a deal to supply Israel with 
sophisticated F-15 assault planes, as well as Yitzhaq Rabin's 
reiteration of his rejection of complete withdrawal from the 
Golan and his demand that a channel for secret negotiations with 
Syria be created, saying: Syria has repeatedly rejected these 
loaded calls, and announced that the Washington talks are the 
proper framework for negotiations, and that the Syrian 
delegation to the peace talks is authorized and empowered to 
conduct the negotiations. Nonetheless, Israeli officials have 
not thus far given up their hopes in this regard. 
  TISHRIN adds: It is clear that the Israelis want to deal 
with the Arab sides one at a time, just as they have done with 
the Palestinians, who have allowed themselves to negotiate with 
their Israeli interlocutors from a position of weakness. The 
end result is that the Palestinians were dragged to an agreement 
that has only consecrated occupation and settlement activities 
in the occupied territories. 
  TISHRIN asserts that these Israeli calls are falling on deaf 
ears in Syria, which has had a taste of Israeli games and 
deceptive tactics. 
  TISHRIN goes on to say: The Israelis did not engage in the 
peace process to achieve peace, but rather to extract an Arab 
recognition of their entity. Their engagement in this process 
has failed to elicit an Israeli commitment to the principles and 
resolutions of international legitimacy. The Israelis were 
encouraged in this by the United States, which has showered them 
with financial and military aid under the pretext of pacifying 
the Israelis and prompting them to walk the path of peace. 
However, the result was that Israel has not made a single move 
in the direction of peace. As a matter of fact, its security 
concerns, or to be more exact, its attempts to obtain funds and 
weaponry from Washington, have been on the increase. Even the 
U.S. loan guarantees, which Israel pledged will not be used to 
promote settlement activities, have been used to beef up 
existing settlements and build new ones. Meanwhile, the United 
State has failed to lift a finger. 
  TISHRIN concludes by saying: Given all this, the Arabs 
cannot work miracles. For, they have done their utmost to 
advance the peace process and sincerely dealt with the peace 
efforts. However, their sincere intentions in this regard have 
run into the Israeli intransigence. As for the U.S. role, it 
has failed to measure up to the level required by the cause of 
peace. It has failed to distinguish between the aggressor and 
the victim. Indeed, it has most often shown a bias in favor of 
the aggressor. 
  For its part, the newspaper AL-BA'TH says: After two years 
of engagement in the peace process, the Israeli prime minister 
has reiterated his rejection of complete withdrawal from the 
occupied Golan, and again demanded either the creation of 
channels for secret negotiations with Syria, or that the level 
of the bilateral talks negotiators be upgraded. By making such 
statements against the background of the talks currently under 
way with the PLO and the international efforts being made to 
advance the peace process, Rabin is setting impossible 
conditions to beleaguer the peace process in order to promote 
Israel's control of the region's resources. 
  AL-BA'TH adds: Israel's claims regarding the so-called 
Syrian conditions are groundless. This is because the peace 
initiative was grounded in the implementation of international 
legitimacy resolutions in the first place. It goes without 
saying that these resolutions provide for a complete Israeli 
withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories, including the 
Golan. Similarly, the Madrid conference and the Washington 
peace talks were held on the basis of this peace initiative. 
The Washington peace talks have identified the party that is 
evading to obstruct peace efforts. 
  Concluding its commentary, AL-BA'TH says: By reiterating his 
impossible conditions and emphasizing his rejection of complete 
withdrawal from the Golan, Rabin has shown that he could not 
care less about the terms of reference of the peace initiative, 
chief among which is the principle of trading land for peace. 
As for Rabin's determination to conclude separate deals with 
the Arab sides, it will not help achieve peace. For the results 
of the Oslo and Cairo agreements speak for themselves. Worse 
still, the potential harm of these agreements is too serious to 
be underrated, contrary to the views of some people. This is 
because the region will not see stability except when there is a 
comprehensive peace based on the withdrawal of occupation troops 
from all occupied territories. 
  The newspaper AL-THAWRAH says: In the course of its efforts 
to promote human rights and ensure compliance with the relevant 
international resolutions and conventions, the civilized world 
community must heed Israel's oppression, injustice, and 
repression against the Palestinian people. Israel must be held 
responsible for the consequences of its conduct in the occupied 
territories. 
  AL-THAWRAH believes that recent developments, which have 
shown Israel's escalation, maneuvering, and circumvention of the 
peace process to render it void of any meaningful content, 
cannot evoke optimism. In such a climate, one cannot envisage a 
peaceful settlement of the regional conflict. The Tel Aviv 
rulers' deliberate escalation of the situation in the occupied 
territories and southern Lebanon, coupled with Rabin's 
statements on a partial withdrawal from the Golan, are all 
signals and indications showing that peace has never been, and 
will never be Israel's option unless it is imposed by 
international legitimacy; that is, by the implementation of 
international legitimacy resolutions on all fronts. 
  AL-THAWRAH adds: Conquering nations and forcing dictates on 
them cannot produce peace. Peace becomes achievable when Israel 
recognizes the rights of others and accepts the restoration of 
their legitimate rights, which are enshrined in the relevant UN 
resolutions. 
  AL-THAWRAH concludes by saying: The path to just and 
comprehensive peace is not paved with roses. Likewise, peace is 
not achievable when separate deals and partial solutions are 
reached, particularly since such deals have demonstrated their 
futility, and failed thus far to bring security and stability 
even to their authors, let alone the entire region. It is no 
longer acceptable to acquiesce to Israel's aggressiveness and 
noncompliance with the relevant international legitimacy 
resolutions. It follows from this that nobody, including the 
U.S. cosponsor of the peace talks, should be allowed to continue 
to support Israel.

<F P=106> [Report by Salamah Ni'mat in Amman] </F>
  [Text] Jordan denied yesterday that it sought to obtain a 
sophisticated electronic communications system to intercept and 
monitor U.S. military and political contacts during the Gulf 
war. A spokesman for the Royal Court said that the 
communications system Jordan ordered from the Novacom [preceding 
word in English] Company was "designed for other purposes that 
concern Jordan." The Jordanian spokesman added that "the U.S. 
Government was informed" of the purpose of this communications 
system, noting that Jordan sought to obtain the Viper [preceding 
word in English] system before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and 
before the Gulf war. The spokesman noted that "it was not 
strange for Jordan to try to obtain a sophisticated 
communications system at that time." 
  The U.S. weekly NEWSWEEK will publish in its issue dated 
today a report on Jordan's attempt to obtain a communications 
system "to intercept contacts via satellites used by the United 
States, Israel, Russia, and Arab countries." 
  The magazine cites Pentagon sources as saying that the U.S. 
authorities "feared" that the communications system would reach 
Iraq, adding that the U.S. State Department rejected a Pentagon 
request to ban the entry to the United States of a senior 
Jordanian official because he was responsible for "smuggling" a 
communications system from the United States to Jordan. 
  Jordanian sources said that the deal to supply Jordan with 
the communications system was not accomplished because the U.S. 
company was not able to obtain an export license. The same 
sources noted that a U.S. federal court prevented the shipping 
of the communications system because no export license was 
granted and fined the exporting company because it did not abide 
by the exportation conditions stipulated by U.S. law. 
  The Jordanian sources stressed that no accusations were 
leveled against the Jordanian Government or any officials in 
this case. The sources added that "the project was shelved" in 
February 1991 following consultations with the U.S. Government. 
  Official Jordanian sources said that certain official U.S. 
quarters "leaked" anti-Jordanian news "as part of a media 
campaign accompanying the economic and political pressure to 
which we are being exposed within the framework of the peace 
process." Jordanian officials said that the United States' 
continued maritime siege on the Jordanian Port of al-'Aqabah -- 
despite the existence of alternatives to ensure the 
implementation of the economic embargo on Iraq -- is part of the 
economic pressure aimed at forcing Jordan to sign a peace treaty 
with Israel. 
  It is worth noting that Jordan's King Husayn warned two 
weeks 
ago that Jordan's resumption of its role in the peace process is 
now "contingent" on ending the blockade imposed on the Port of 
al-'Aqabah. The blockade, imposed on the port since 1990, has 
cost the Jordanian economy $1.3 billion.

  [Text] The speaker of the Iranian parliament, 'Ali Akbar 
Nateq- Nuri, has said Pakistan can always count on strong 
Iranian support in the wake of complex regional and global 
situations. Addressing a special session of the National 
Assembly in Islamabad this morning, Mr. Nateq-Nuri fully 
supported Pakistan's stand on the Kashmir issue and its stance 
on acquiring nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. The 
Iranian speaker called upon the Muslim ummah [community] to 
beware of the conspiracies being hatched against the Muslim 
world. Unity alone, he emphasized, can pull the Muslim world 
out of the present difficult situation. 
  Mr. Nateq-Nuri called for an immediate end to the atrocities 
in occupied Kashmir and allowing the Kashmiri people to exercise 
their right of self-determination. He warned that if serious 
efforts were not made to resolve the Kashmir issue, it will pave 
the way for those seeking power domination in the region and 
plunge the region into a state of instability and tension. 
  Mr. Nateq-Nuri also endorsed Iran's full support to Pakistan 
for acquiring nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. He said 
the West is against the acquisition of such a technology by any 
Islamic country in the world. These countries, he said, are 
silent over the nuclear program being followed by Israel. There 
should be no double standards, he emphasized. Iran, he said, 
did not advocate the proliferation of nuclear arms and said the 
whole world should be free from such weapons. 
  During the course of his inspired speech, the Iranian 
speaker 
also spoke on the situation in Palestine, Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
and Afghanistan. He asked the ummah to join hands for the 
assistance of these people. He said the demolition of the Babri 
Masjid [mosque] is another conspiracy against the Muslims and 
Islam and strongly condemned these acts. He demanded immediate 
reconstruction and restoration of the Babri Masjid. 
  Earlier, welcoming Mr. Nateq-Nuri, the speaker of the 
National Assembly, Syed Yusuf Raza Gilani, said the 
parliamentarians of the Islamic countries have a special role to 
play in view of the challenges being faced by the Muslim world 
today. During talks with Mr. Nateq-Nuri, he said we have 
resolved to work together for the well-being of the Muslim 
ummah. We want to complement our efforts in establishing an 
association of interparliamentary union of Muslim countries as 
well as an association on interparliamentarians of ECO [Economic 
Cooperation Organization] countries. 
  Speaking on the occasion, Law and Parliamentary Minister 
Syed 
Iqbal Haider, welcomed the speech of the Iranian speaker and 
said it is a great source of inspiration to the Pakistani 
Government and people. He said the visit of the Iranian speaker 
will lead to the strengthening of existing cordial relations 
between the two countries. The sentiments expressed by the 
Iranian speaker for the Muslims of Bosnia, Palestine, and 
particularly for the valiant struggle launched by the people of 
Kashmir are a great source of satisfaction. 
  The deputy leader of the opposition, Mr. Gauhar Ayub Khan, 
in 
his speech said Iran always stood with Pakistan in hour of 
crisis. The relations between the two countries are extremely 
cordial and strong links bind the people of both the countries. 
  Hojjat-ol Eslam 'Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri called on the 
president, Mr. Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari, in Islamabad. They 
discussed matters of mutual interest in the meeting which lasted 
one and a half hours. The president paid rich tributes to the 
late Iranian spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeyni, and 
prayed for the progress and prosperity of the Iranian people. A 
15-member delegation also accompanied the Iranian speaker.

that the Islamic Republic of Iran cannot be indifferent toward 
the events in Afghanistan. He said: Iran is prepared to

decisions were made about the serious participation of Iran and 
Pakistan in resolving the Afghan crisis, which will be acted on 
when conditions are ripe, provided the warring groups are ready. 
  Nateq-Nuri also called for the shedding of factional and 
sectarian prejudices in Afghanistan. He warned: If a foreign 
power gains a foothold in the domestic affairs of Afghanistan 
the 14-year struggles of the Afghan mojahedin will be lost. 
  He called for an end to the conflict under the banner of 
Islam's teachings. He said: The Islamic Republic of Iran will 
not begrudge any assistance in the establishment of security and 
an Islamic government in Afghanistan.

Nateq-Nuri, the Majles speaker, visited the 
Iran-Pakistan-Persian Research Center in Islamabad today and 
took part in a news conference in which he answered reporters' 
questions. Our correspondent reports: 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Nateq-Nuri described the results of his 
trip to this country as positive and said: Our discussions 
revealed that the two countries share the same viewpoints with 
respect to the issues of the world of Islam. In response to a 
question, the Majles speaker, who was speaking to 
correspondents, denied having any discussions with Pakistani 
authorities about cooperation on the manufacture and use of 
nuclear weapons. He said: We support the peaceful use of 
nuclear technology by Pakistan. 
  On the Kashmir issue, he said: The Islamic Republic of Iran 
can be a good mediator toward the resolution of this problem. 
He added: On the initiative of the Islamic Republic of Iran, it 
has been agreed that a delegation consisting of representatives 
of Islamic countries will be sent to study the situation in the 
part of Kashmir under the control of India and the members of 
this delegation have been selected. 
  Mr. Nateq-Nuri described Iran and Pakistan's capabilities 
for 
supplying one another's requirements as plentiful, saying: The 
Islamic Republic of Iran has agreed to increase the volume of 
gas exports to this country from 25,000 tonnes to 50,000 tonnes. 
  Elsewhere in the news conference, the Majles speaker 
explained that, with regard to Iran's three Persian Gulf islands 
[Abu Musa and the Lesser and Greater Tunbs], we are prepared to 
continue the contacts toward the resolution of the difficulties. 
  Mr. Nateq-Nuri also visited the Iran-Pakistan-Persian 
Research Center in Islamabad today. During the visit and in a 
gathering of dozens of Persian language lecturers in Pakistan,

  [Text] Islamabad, April 12, IRNA -- The speaker of Iran's 
parliament told a group of Pakistani Shiite and Sunni ulama here 
Tuesday that what has terrified global arrogance and the U.S. in 
particular today is the spread of Islamism in Muslim countries. 
  The speaker, Hojjat ol-Eslam 'Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri also said 
the enemies of Islam were seriously concerned about the revival 
of Islamic movements in the remotest parts of the world and even 
in Europe. 
  He said the utterance of the word, Allah and the phrase 
Allaho Akbar (There is no god but Allah) is considered an 
offense by the global arrogance and that any body who abides by 
Islamic laws will be the target of U.S. propaganda ad military 
attacks. 
  "It is for this very reason that we now see enemies of Islam 
committing crimes against Muslims including women and children 
in every part of Islamic lands," he said. 
  Nateq-Nuri also warned that the U.S. was trying to prevent 
Muslims from getting united and engage them in internal problems 
in a bid to contain the spread of Islam. 
  "Muslims should seriously avoid discord, settle their 
differences by themselves and not allow foreigners to interfere 
in their internal affairs," he advised. 
  The unity between Shiites and Sunnis has been materialized 
in 
Iran for years, he said, adding "we appeal to world Muslims to 
follow the pattern of unity and sincerity between their Shiite 
and Sunni brothers in Iran." 
  Addressing Pakistani ulama, the Majlis speaker said the 
zealot Islamic groups who sow discord among Muslims are 
certainly against their interests.

  [Text] Iranian Parliament Speaker 'Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri has 
underlined the need for establishment of a common trade market 
of the Economic Cooperation Organization [ECO] member-countries. 
  Speaking at a banquet in his honor hosted by Senate Chairman 
Wasim Sajjad in Islamabad yesterday, he said pooling the 
resources of the ECO member-countries and increasing mutual 
cooperation in all fields are very essential. Nateq-Nuri said 
bilateral fraternal relations have stood every test of time and 
the two countries maintain identical views on several regional 
and international issues. 
  Speaking on the occasion, Senate Chairman Wasim Sajjad 
called 
upon Iran to use its influence to persuade India to fulfill its 
pledge of granting the right of self-determination to the 
Kashmiri people. He said the peaceful settlement of the Kashmir 
problem will pave the way for peace and meaningful cooperation 
among all countries of this region. Sajjad stressed the need 
for regular consultations and cooperation between Iran and 
Pakistan, so that the legitimate rights of the Muslims of 
Kashmir, Palestine, and Bosnia can be protected.

the local Muslim people and ulema. Enthusisastic people

city and spent the night in religious places as well as at the 
culture center to meet Hojjat ol-Eslam Nateq-Nuri.

Islamic revolution Ayatollah Khamene'i and to President 
Rafsanjani.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Our correspondent, Khamene, 
reports from Islamabad on the activities of the speaker of the 
Islamic consultative Majlis on the fourth day of his visit to 
Pakistan: 
  [Khamene] Continuing his visit to Pakistan, Mr. 'Ali Akbar 
Nateq-Nuri, Majlis speaker, arrived in Lahore and attended a 
ceremony in which more than 250 Pakistani scholars and spiritual 
leaders from various Islamic sects, ministers, deputies, and 
personalities from Punjab were present. In the ceremony, Mr. 
Nateq-Nuri referred to the hostile attitude of America towards 
Islam and Muslims and stressed: The Islamic community should set 
aside factionalism and safeguard its vigilance and preparedness 
in order to foil American ploys and conspiracies. 
  The Majlis speaker mentioned that the increasing trend of 
support for Islam and pro-Islamic activity in various parts of 
the world has petrified the enemies of Islam and particularly 
America. He added: The world arrogance and the devourer America 
design a conspiracy against the world of Islam and Muslims each 
day. Under such circumstances, any person who causes discord 
among Muslims, under any pretext, has betrayed God and is an 
American lackey. 
  The Majlis speaker condemned oppressive measures and 
aggressive acts which take place against Muslims in Bosnia, 
Kashmir, and Palestine and said: America and arrogance do not 
care who is a Shiite or a Sunni. It is enough for a person to 
believe in prayers and the Qiblah to be killed or subjected to 
assault. 
  He honored the memory of the Muslim Pakistani martyrs who 
protested against the apostate Salman Rushdie and said: We must 
expand unity among Muslims, shun sectarianism, and hold hands to 
protect Islam and Muslims. 
  During the ceremonies, Mowlana Aslam Salimi, Pir Asef Ali 
Shah Gaylani, Mowlana Abdolqader Azad and Mowlana Abdol Rashid, 
who are among the prominent Sunni scholars of the Pakistani 
Punjab, applauded the high status of Imam Khomeyni and praised 
decisive stances adopted by the late Imam and the Islamic 
Republic of Iran to confront problems faced by Muslims and the 
world of Islam.

  [Text] Lahore, April 14, IRNA -- Iran's Majlis speaker 
Hojjat ol-Eslam Ahmad Nateq-Nuri here Wednesday stressed the 
importance of the role that parliaments play in protecting 
rights of the people, specially in Islamic countries. 
  Addressing the vice-speaker and deputies at Punjab assembly, 
the speaker further added that the main responsibility of Muslim 
deputies is not to let ethnic disputes leave a negative impact 
on the assembly's approvals. 
  In response, vice-speaker of Punjab assembly Manzoor Moohel 
referred to cultural, historical, and religious relations 
between the two countries and stressed further expansion and 
strengthening of mutual ties. "Iran is our best friend and we 
are proud of it," he added. 
  Hojjat ol-Eslam Nateq-Nuri later met governor general of 
Punjab Altaf Hussein who called on the speaker to provide the 
people of the state with more books in Persian language. 
  He said the Iranian speaker's visit to Pakistan would pave 
the way for further friendly ties between the two nations.

interest in the Persian language and said that the government 
was making efforts to restore the real status of the language in 
pakistan.

Shi'ite and Sunni Muslim ulema as well as with the Iranians 
residing in Lahore.

continuation of the movement for the revival of the Islamic 
thoughts and called on the world Muslims to support Islam and 
Holy Quran and struggle against conspiracies of the world 
arrogance in Palestine and Bosnia. 
  Referring to the growing trend of Islamic revivalism in all 
Muslim states, Nateq-Nuri said that it was the same Islamic 
tendency which had scared the U.S. and its lackey agents. 
  Earlier on the day, the speaker met with Iranians residing 
in 
Lahore whom he referred to as the "ambassadors" of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran. 
  During the meeting the speaker noted that Iran as an

  [Text] Lahore, April 14, IRNA -- A senior Majlis deputy 
said here Wednesday that the Islamic Iran would not stand the 
massacre of Muslims and pressures against them in any part of 
the world including Kashmir. Vice-Chairman of Majlis foreign 
policy commission Mohammad Javad Larijani who is currently 
accompanying Majlis Speaker 'Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri in his tour of 
Pakistan, told IRNA that one of the valuable outcomes of 
Tehran-Islamabad talks was the speaker's proposal for the 
formation of ECO [Economic Cooperation Organization] 
inter-parliamentary group. 
  Representatives have been appointed by the two countries to 
follow up agreements reached between the two sides, Larijani 
noted, adding "we hope that the organization would be formed by 
the next year". Voicing Iran's readiness to cooperate in 
bringing an end to Kashmir problem, the Iranian parliamentarian 
called for negotiations between the belligerent parties to 
settle the dispute. The Islamic Republic of Iran believes that 
Kashmiri people should determine their own fate, Larijani 
remarked. 
  Underlining geopolitical and economic importance of the two 
countries, Larijani noted that with a total population of 200 
million and their access to different parts of Asia, specially 
the Indian Ocean, Gulf of Oman and the Persian Gulf, Iran and 
Pakistan, should be regarded as core for any regional 
arrangement, Larijani concluded.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Affirming Pak-Iran relations"] </F>
  [Text] The speaker of the Iranian Majles (parliament) 'Ali 
Akbar Nateq-Nuri, while addressing a special session of the 
National Assembly Monday condemned what he described as the 
'selective morality' of the West, saying it wanted to deprive 
the Muslim world of nuclear technology while closing its eyes to 
the nuclear military capability developed by Israel. Speaker 
Nuri also assured the Pakistani legislators of Iran's unstinted 
support to the Kashmiris right of self-determination. In this 
regard he called for a peaceful and just solution of the problem 
in accordance with the relevant United Nations resolutions. 
'Pakistan can rely on Iran's principled stance on Kashmir,' he 
is reported to have declared, perhaps clarifying Iranian 
position which came under fire after Tehran along with Beijing 
asked Islamabad to withdraw its resolution pertaining to 
Kashmiris' human rights violations, in Geneva. 
  It did come as a shock to an average Pakistani that Tehran 
had played a role in this context and drew a reaction which 
could not be called favourable, to say the least. Speaker 
Nuri's assertion on Monday should set at rest fears in this 
country that Tehran, in an attempt to cosy up to New Delhi 
primarily for economic reasons, might proportionately have 
distanced itself from Islamabad. Iran has been Pakistan's 
friend for long and if certain reports are to be believed, 
during Shah's period, Islamabad's primary source of information 
on Israel. Diplomacy is a dicey game and involves juxtaposing 
conflicting configuration of forces. Amidst everything, 
principles notwithstanding, the national interest reigns 
supreme. The kinds of pressures a country has to put up with in 
fine-tuning a policy often remains hidden from public view. 
Speaker Nuri was evidently voicing his country's policy when he 
castigated human rights violations in Indian-occupied Kashmir. 
Together, there is much that the two countries can achieve. 
Iran could benefit from Pakistan in the field of civil 
engineering and conversely, Pakistan could do with the Iranian 
expertise in setting up oil refineries. As founder members of 
the Regional Cooperation for Development (RCD), renamed ECO 
(Economic Cooperation Organisation), there are many areas in 
which the two countries can tap each other's potential. It is 
perhaps time that we recast our approach to diplomatic 
relations, purging it of the sentimentality one would normally 
attach to personal relations.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Iranian Speaker's Address -- Where Do We </F>
Stand?"] 
  [Text] Iranian Parliament Speaker 'Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri 
addressed the Pakistan National Assembly and has fully and 
strongly supported Pakistan on its nuclear program and the 
Kashmir issue. He warned that attempts by any foreign power to 
influence events in the region will go against the security 
interests of the neighboring Islamic countries. Iran has 
established close friendly relations with Pakistan after the 
Islamic revolution and has always sympathized with Islamabad 
whenever it faced problems. 
  The manner in which Nateq-Nuri, in his National Assembly 
speech, has openly assured Iran's support on the serious 
problems facing Pakistan will further strengthen the spirit of 
Islamic brotherhood in this region. In fact, the nuclear issue 
or the Kashmir dispute does not affect Pakistan alone, but they 
also have a direct impact on the neighboring Islamic states. If 
Pakistan is made weak, God forbid, in the nuclear field, then it 
will lead to the weakening of the entire Muslim community. If, 
under the alleged conspiracies, a third option [preceding two 
words in English] is adopted to settle the Kashmir dispute, then 
it is feared the United States and anti-Islamic forces might 
turn Kashmir into a base for international machination and from 
there orchestrate their conspiracies to weaken the Muslim 
countries of the region. Iran is also facing U.S. pressure on 
the nuclear issue, and, hence, it can fully realize Pakistan's 
difficulties in this regard. Nateq-Nuri's remarks help us to 
assess to what extent Iran desires to see Pakistan militarily 
become strong. 
  Coincidentally, the Iranian speaker arrived in Islamabad the 
same day the U.S. delegation was departing from Pakistan. On 
that occasion, Pakistan and the United States issued a joint 
statement expressing their resolve to continue to strive to 
strengthen bilateral relations. The U.S. delegation was led by 
Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, who had come to 
Pakistan after visiting India. The main purpose of his visit 
was nothing but to help eliminate the nuclear arms race in the 
Indian subcontinent. However, it is ironic that while in India 
nobody listened to what Mr. Talbott had to say, in Pakistan his 
delegation was welcomed and heard very enthusiastically. Even 
though the Government of Pakistan asserts that no national 
interest was compromised, the wording of the joint statement and 
the expression of happiness on the face of Talbott during his 
meetings with the president and the prime minister and at the 
news briefing rightly lead one to suspect what success led the 
U.S. representative to display such a sense of happiness. The 
use of vague language in the joint statement itself reflects the 
success of the U.S. stand. The foreign media is also giving the 
same impression. Even though the supply of F-16's has not been 
tied to the capping of the nuclear program, Pakistan has also 
not openly showed a red signal to the U.S. moves; it is worth 
noting that the two countries will adopt the path of "quiet 
diplomacy" to resolve the nuclear issue. This method is 
definitely useful for the United States, but it is also 
tantamount to openly deceiving the Pakistani people. The 
Government of Pakistan, therefore, must remain cognizant of the 
fact that the people will never accept any compromise -- open or 
secret -- on their independence, security, and sovereignty! The 
government must not commit even the slightest mistake in 
understanding the feelings of the nation. Similar are the 
sentiments of the neighboring Islamic states and further 
progress in the nuclear program is essential for enhancing the 
strength of both Pakistan and the Islamic community.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Ties with Iran"] </F>
  [Text] Addressing a press conference in Islamabad, the 
visiting Speaker of the Iranian Majles, 'Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri 
has talked about a wide range of matters relating to Pak-Iranian 
relations. However, the thrust of his pronouncements was to 
explain away what has been widely seen in Pakistan as a `tilt 
towards India' in Iran's foreign relations. Ever since the 
Iranians changed their mind at the eleventh hour in Geneva and 
expressed inability to vote for Pakistan's resolution on human 
rights abuses in occupied Kashmir, albeit they were said to have 
brokered a face-saving compromise, opinion leaders in Pakistan 
have been trying to comprehend the implications of the odd 
phenomenon. And, notwithstanding Islamabad's endeavour to play 
down the Iranian dissidence, there have been apprehensions that 
a strategic shift in Iran's perception of regional alignments 
may well be on the anvil. The Iranian speaker has been candid 
enough to acknowledge that relations with India have assumed a 
special significance for his country. "We cannot ignore the 
Muslims living in India," he said. Whether or not his alibi for 
a drift towards closer cooperation with India was convincing, 
Hojjat ol-Eslam Nuri did not mince words to put across the 
message that the Iranians did not share Pakistan's perception of 
India's role in the region, and were willing to take initiatives 
which may be deemed as pro India by Pakistanis at large. Though 
he was eager to underscore that Iran's relations with other 
countries, particularly India, will not affect friendship with 
Pakistan, the new-born pragmatism in Iran's outlook on 
friendship and alliances calls for a review of Islamabad's 
foreign policy agenda. 
  Given the fraternal bonds of religion and culture and the 
geopolitical compulsions, Iran is not likely to dump Pakistan 
for the sake of securing a regional arrangement with India, but 
what needs to be accepted as a fait accompli is the signal that 
Iran will not necessarily go along with Pakistan on issues of 
discord in the region. The overriding concern in Tehran appears 
to be to break its international isolation and play a 
significant role in regional politics. The offer to mediate on 
Kashmir is a veritable indication of Tehran's urge to play the 
honest broker in regional disputes and acquire a measure of 
leverage in power politics. Thus, Islamabad will have to reckon 
with Tehran's growing quest for self-assertion and its agenda 
thereof for seeking new power alignments.

<F P=106> [Speech by Ayatollah 'Ali Khamene'i, leader of the Islamic </F>
revolution, on 13 April; place not given -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] In the name of God, the compassionate, the 
merciful. [passage omitted] In this prayer house I wish to talk 
to you about a subject that concerns all the people of Iran. 
Some years ago -- maybe 200 years -- a struggle was forced on 
the Iranian nation. By whom? By power hungry powers who wanted 
to take control of every part of the world where there were 
natural resources, cultural heritage, means of gaining 
knowledge, talents, and take them back place them in the service 
of the civilization and policy which was newly born in Europe, 
that is the industrial civilization and the political set-up 
prevailing over the industrial civilization. [passage omitted] 
  That struggle was forced on the Iranian nation. By whom? By 
what we now call arrogance. In those days when arrogance came 
in, it came in directly and took over countries. Today it uses 
more advanced means of conquering and controlling nations and 
their resources. [passage omitted] 
  That struggle was forced on the Iranian nation. And today, 
too, they are aggressive and offensive. Of course, we grab the 
world's big powers by the scruff of the neck where ever they 
are. Why do we do that? Because they are offensive and 
oppressors. We do not let oppressors go, and say let go and we 
will let go. No, they are aggressors, they are offensive, and 
are constantly oppressing nations. We are not such a government 
or nation as to leave an aggressor and oppressor alone. 
  So, my dear brothers and sisters, that fight was forced on 
the Iranian nation many years ago. It is not a new matter. Of 
course when the Islamic revolution was victorious in this 
country and the previous regime, which was under the total 
control of arrogant powers, was overthrown, they naturally 
became more angry and the fight became harder and rougher. 
[passage omitted] 
  There has been a revolution, it has thrown out that puppet, 
subservient regime, and a government has come into power which 
bows to nothing on earth. It did not yield for one moment to 
the combined powers of America and the Soviet Union. [Crowd 
chants God is Great, Khamene'i is the Leader, Death to America, 
Death to Hypocrites, Death to Counterrevolution, Death to Israel] 
  Well, America and the Soviet Union disagreed on a hundred 
issues and agreed on some. One, and the most important, was 
putting pressure on the Islamic Republic. Obviously it was not 
otherwise. Whoever was on the scene could clearly see this. It 
was not anything anyone would hide. This regime stood up to the 
two of them put together. And now, too, the American rulers 
naively and foolishly think that they are the bosses of the 
world. They talk as if they are the managers of the whole 
earth. And some people, out of fear and weakness, say yes sir 
to them. But the Islamic Republic has stood up in all strength 
and says who are you? You are a power, a strong government, go 
and run your own country. If you are right, go and rid the 
streets of New York, Washington, and Los Angeles of unrest. If 
you are right, go and get rid of racism and the terrible 
violation of human rights, which still exists between blacks and 
whites. What business is it of yours to interfere in the 
world's affairs? 
  When such a government came into power here the struggle 
became more serious and stronger. It is not a joke. It is a 
question of America's interests, America's political, economic, 
and propaganda power, which has been slaughtered here and 
crushed. That has made them angry. 
  It is true that the struggle has been going on for 200 
years, 
but then before the revolution the fight was against the Iranian 
nation from a position of strength on their side, and the 
Iranian Government was completely -- at least in the last 50 
years or more, since the end of the Qajar dynasty -- under the 
control of arrogance. It was Britain one day, Russia the next, 
and then America. During the eight year Iran-Iraq war, both the 
United States and NATO, and the USSR and Warsaw Pact, tried so 
hard to dismember Iran by arming Iraq. We saw they failed; and 
today, therefore, their attempt is more serious and they are 
more angry. This is because they failed and were slapped on the 
mouth. 
  You are the military personnel. You know that in combat, be 
it a political and economic struggle or a military conflict, 
each side must rely on its own strong points and take advantage 
of the opposing side's weaknesses. You should find out what 
your strong points are. [passage omitted] 
  The Iranian people's belief in religion and spritual matters 
created a strong point for them; and that was one of the 
greatest national tests, the biggest courageous uprising of the 
entire history, leading to our great Islamic revolution in a 
sensitive juncture. The nation stood with this revolution and 
formed a government based on the revolution. This is the 
government of the Islamic Republic. We owe this to our 
religious belief. [passage omitted] 
  Today a group of disgraced pen-pushers are seeking to write 
articles to please the U.S. security organization, which rewards 
them with a few dollars. They write: The Iranian nation made a 
mistake by staging a revolution. That is, they belittle the 
Iranian nation's greatest act of courage, which gave them pride, 
by writing such articles that the Iranian nation made a mistake 
and regrets its revolution. May they face the Iranian nation's 
hatred. May such pen-pushers face the Iranian nation's 
abhorrence. [passage omitted] 
  Praise be to God, those in charge of the government today 
are 
not making any claims and are not demanding anything for 
themselves. Even the imam [Khomeyni], with such illustrious 
status, considered himself a servant of the people and was proud 
of it. The state authorities are proud to be the servants of 
the people. They say this explicitly: We are the servants of 
the people and we have come to serve the people. At the same 
time they serve for a period and are replaced by others later. 
This is highly valuable. This is a big strong point and we 
have other points of strength which I do not wish to enumerate 
at the moment. 
  Our enemy has been engaged in a struggle against us for the 
past 200 years. The enemy, thus, is striving to destroy as many 
of our strong points as possible. They think it is possible to 
destroy the people's religious faith. They have opened the 
flood of the western decadent lifestyle, prostitution, lust and 
hedonism to inundate the third world countries. They intend to 
direct this flood into our country too. They have already 
started. Look at the smugglers who import pornographic video 
cassettes, sexually provocative pictures, sexually arousing 
books, and magazines filled with nude and erotic pictures. If 
you pursue the matter, you will find out that some try to make a 
living out of this job, but they will not make their daily 
bread. That is, they will lose their daily bread elsewhere. 
They have been tasked to open the floodgates from the quagmire 
of corruption and lust into Iran and among the Iranian nation, 
particularly among its youths and families. 
  This, of course, is one of our strong points. A strong point 
which they are trying to take away from us. They are, after 
all, our sworn enemies and they are only doing what is expected 
of them. As enemies, they want you dead and destroyed. They 
want to destroy all points of strength, such as our popular 
government. Of course, a few years ago they started to realize 
that they can never achieve this. For this reason, they are now 
merely intent on giving our government a bad image. [passage 
omitted] 
  Everyone, thus, should remain vigilant , as we have before 
us 
an enemy which has been trying unsuccessfully for 15 years to 
hurt and harm us. Despite its failure, however, the enemy has 
not given up yet. Praise be to God, we have many strong points 
which need to be made even stronger -- the strong points which I 
mentioned earlier, plus many others. Of course, we have a 
number of weak points which should be dealt with. We must be 
fully aware that the enemy is intent on taking away our points 
of strength. [passage omitted]

  [Text] London, Apr. 14, IRNA -- The American secretary of 
state, Warren Christopher, will resign by the end of this year 
and barring upsets, is expected to be replaced by his deputy, 
Strobe Talbott, say White House sources quoted by THE 
ECONOMIST's Foreign Report here. 
  U.S. foreign policy under Christopher was said to have been 
undynamic and a disappointment to the White House. The 
perception was that the previous republican administration would 
probably have been tougher and assertive if it remained in 
power. Foreign Report said that President Clinton had been 
unwillingly drawn into foreign policy issues instead of being 
allowed to concentrate on domestic affairs. 
  Some issues had been delegated to Vice President Al Gore 
rather than Christopher and more recently, the secretary of 
defense, Bill Perry, seemed to have been making the running on 
foreign policy. 
  Whether Talbott, the former Washington bureau chief of TIME 
magazine and long-standing friend of Clinton, makes American 
foreign policy, the weekly intelligence publication said, 
remained to be seen. 
  Although the deputy secretary of state knows Washington well 
and is a student of relations with Russia, he has held no 
personal experience of high office before.

  [Text] The president, Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani, today 
addressed a group of staff and managers from the Industries 
Ministry and Iran's Standards and Industrial Research Institute 
[SIRI]. In his address, the president considered positive the 
trend of developments in the industrial sector during the era of 
reconstruction. He added that viewing production as a central 
activity constituted a correct and proper program for making 
society's economic foundation stable and solid. The president 
added: At present the country has become self-sufficient in many 
areas. He stressed: With the operation of the petrochemical 
complex at Bandar-e Imam Khomeyni in the near future, the future 
prospects for the country's industrial sector will be even 
brighter than the present. 
  The president, moreover, referred to the important duty of 
the SIRI in controlling the quality of products, and said: 
Alongside the processes of improving production according to 
desired standards and obliterating the undesirable cultural 
trends of the past in connection with consumption of 
foreign-made commodities, one must also endeavor to pay more 
attention to the need to support the country's indigenous 
industrialists.

  [Text] The new Turkish ambassador was today received by 
President Hashemi-Rafsanjani to present his credentials. 
  At the meeting Ahmed Mitat Balkan, the Turkish ambassador, 
conveyed the desire of the government and people of Turkey to 
expand ties with their great neighbor, Iran. He described the 
existing ties as deep-rooted. He expressed the hope that 
through exchange of high-ranking delegations between Iran and 
Turkey and greater efforts by the two countries' diplomatic 
missions, the existing relations and cooperation -- including at 
the Economic Cooperation Organization and international forums 
-- will be further expanded. 
  According to a Central News Unit correspondent's report Mr. 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani described as positive the grounds for the 
expansion of cooperation between the two neighboring countries, 
Iran and Turkey, especially in regional issues, the joint 
committee, Central Asia and Caucasus. 
  Referring to the mischief-making of Turkish media, aimed at 
marring the spirit of friendship and cooperation between the two 
countries, he stressed the need for the two countries' 
authorities to remain alert to foil those mischiefs.

  [Text] Tehran--The use of satellite dishes is on the agenda 
at cabinet proceedings and a decision will be made within a 
month, said Interior Minister 'Ali Mohammad Besharati. 
  In an exclusive interview with the TEHRAN TIMES, the 
minister 
said, "The use of satellite dishes is not illegal, but will need 
to be authorized." 
  Besharati was commenting on earlier reports by the local 
press which quoted him as saying that satellite dishes are 
'illegal and will all be confiscated within two months.' 
  There were fears after the interior minister's announcement 
that some could take undue advantage of the situation and 
blackmail those who are now using dishes. 
  "The issue is under discussion by the cabinet and a 
comprehensive decision is to be made within a month," said 
Besharati. 
  President Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani's cabinet meets every 
Wednesday. 
  Satellite dishes began mushrooming on rooftops in the last 
two years and the Persian daily SALAM recently reported that 400 
dishes were being installed in Tehran daily. 
  "The cabinet will approve rules and regulations on the use 
of 
dishes and the Interior Ministry will be responsible for their 
enforcement," Besharati said. 
  "Of course the Interior Ministry will give enough time for 
dish users to surrender them to the ministry voluntarily," he 
said. 
  Besharati said a commission comprising representatives from 
the Islamic Propagation Organization and the Ministry of Culture 
and Islamic Guidance will set rules and regulations for issuing 
permission for satellite dish use. 
  He said foreign missions in Iran should apply for permission 
and it will be granted to them. 
  "Before the cabinet's approval and an announcement by the 
Interior Ministry, no one is authorized to confiscate the dishes 
and if approached by someone who wants to, people should inform 
the nearest police station," Besharati emphasized.

  [Text] Tehran April 13, IRNA -- A Majlis (parliament) 
deputy here Wednesday deplored latest decision of the Saudi 
Ministry of Pilgrimage (Hajj) Affairs and Awqaf to ban 
distribution of pictures and written materials during the annual 
Hajj ceremonies. 
  Baratali Samadi-Far, deputy of Sonqor-e-Koliayee in Majlis, 
also criticized Riyadh for cutting down the quota of the Iranian 
pilgrims for this year's Hajj. "This is clearly in contradiction 
with the text of the holy Koran," he added. 
  Also speaking at the open session of the Majlis today deputy 
from Ahwaz, 'Ali Motavvari, said the enemies of Islam led by the 
world devouring U.S. have concentrated their efforts on playing 
down the the presence of the Iranians in the Hajj rituals and 
other international gatherings. 
  Parviz Seiqali, from the Langroud Constituency, Gilan 
Province, in his pre-agenda speech also accused the U.S. of 
attempting to make Iranian people disappointed by exerting 
economic and psychological pressures on them.

Group] 
  [Text] The martyr-seeking attack by Palestinian mujahidin 
on a bus carrying Zionists in the Hadera area of Tel Aviv, the 
capital of the usurping Zionist regime, shows again the firm 
determination of the Palestinian uprising to continue the 
struggle until the occupied territories are liberated. The 
attack, which left over 30 dead and wounded Zionists, is the 
second martyr-seeking operation within a week and comes within 
the framework of a promise of five attacks by the Islamic 
Resistance Movement, Hamas, to avenge the blood shed unjustly by 
the worshippers at the Ibrahimi Mosque in al-Khalil. 
  Political analysts believe that two major processes have 
been 
reigning over the Palestinian crisis. The first is the process 
of compromise between the politically bankrupt organizations 
abroad and the Zionist regime, a process that entered a new 
phase six months ago with the signing of the Gaza-Jericho 
self-rule compromise. This compromise is part of a greater plan 
based on bilateral and collective talks between Arab governments 
and the Zionist regime, which started two years ago in Madrid 
and are continuing in Washington. 
  The second process that reigns over the Palestinian crisis 
is 
the Intifadah, which is based on expanding the collective 
struggle of the Palestinian Muslims inside the occupied 
territories. In this all-aspected jihad, the Muslim 
Palestinians resort to various methods of struggle and retaliate 
against the suppressive and terrorist methods used by the 
aggressive and usurping Zionist regime. 
  The same political analysts add that the process of 
compromise that rules the Palestinian and Middle East crisis has 
faced extensive problems because it is imposed and illogical. 
The Madrid-Washington talks, which, according to their 
engineers, should have yielded results within two years, have 
achieved no perceptible result even though four months have 
passed since the deadline and they are at an impasse. 'Arafat's 
compromise with the Zionist regime is facing a similar fate and 
the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho self-rule plan, which was 
to start with the withdrawal of the aggressive Zionist forces 
from these areas, has thrice been postponed. 
  Because of its roots in the Palestinian territory and 
nation, 
the intifadah has intensified such that the Zionist leaders no 
longer hide their concern. The success scored by the Muslim 
Palestinian combatants in planning and carrying out jihad 
operations shows that contrary to what the Palestinian and Arab 
compromisers think, the equation that rules the Middle East 
crisis is not unilateral and that if a nation insists on its 
rights, the enemy must inevitably surrender.

  [Text] Again the Zionist regime has canceled a date, that 
for the withdrawal of the occupying Zionist forces from the 
autonomous Gaza-Jericho region, which was due to take place on 
13 April. In the seven months since the signing of the 
Gaza-Jericho Autonomy Accord between 'Arafat and Tel Aviv, this 
is the third time that Israel has unilaterally trampled upon the 
deadline agreed for withdrawal and postponed it in utter 
disregard of Palestine and international public opinion. 
  Israel has implied that the pullout could take place in the 
last days of Ordibehesht [21 April-21 May] but the Palestinians, 
even those participating in the compromising talks, do not trust 
these deadlines. In practice, the Palestinian region has 
witnessed more violence, clashes, arrests, and massacres of 
Palestinians since the signing of the Gaza-Jericho Accord. 
  The face of the occupied territories has not changed as 
regards peace and compromise and Zionist units continue in their 
operations of pursuit and killing. Palestinian citizens still 
suffer the throes of hunger, disease, arrests, and annihilation. 
In this period, the usurped territories, especially the Gaza 
Strip, have experienced the most prolonged economic and military 
siege. These areas have been resealed for many consecutive 
weeks. 
  But do not ignore that even if Israel has ostensibly agreed 
to withdraw from the Gaza-Jericho region, in practice, it has 
continued to renege on adhering to these agreements. Basically, 
it has no intention of doing so. What will be implemented, if 
it ever is, will be a mere reshuffling of arrangements and 
deployment of the occupying forces in these regions. All that 
will be achieved is the removal of the Zionist forces from the 
streets in Gaza and Jericho and the deployment of Palestinian 
forces. They will be stationed around the 19 Zionist 
settlements in the region. 
  Although this will remove the Zionist forces from public 
view, the change in the array of forces will fully reveal the 
true military nature of the Zionist settlements. Despite the 
Zionist regime's constant reneging or rearranging of its forces, 
the series of 'Arafat's talks with this regime continues. Every 
round results in a new retreat by the compromising Palestinians 
and new concessions for the Zionist regime. What is interesting 
is that in time, as the privileges given to the Zionist regime 
increase, the hope of its withdrawal decreases. 
  'Arafat has gambled in this dangerous game and has staked 
his 
reputation and his political and military resources and has 
closed every path of return for himself. This has resulted in 
his forfeiting the support of the Palestinian nation and its 
popular base. He is the main loser in this dangerous game, 
which has no prospects.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>
  [Excerpts] During the past few months, the clerical regime 
has again limited border transactions in the Iranian-Iraqi 
border areas and regime officials in the various cities of 
Kordestan are alleging that this directive has been issued by 
the National Security Council and should be seriously [words 
[indistinct]. 
  When the residents in Iranian and Iraqi Kurdistan can meet 
their needs through such local transactions, the closing of 
routes and borders in this way is considered incorrect, a kind 
of hostility by the Islamic Republic against the people of Iraqi 
Kurdistan. 
  The clerical regime has not closed the border routes to 
everyone and every type of transaction. It has encouraged some 
of its own people and profiteering entrepreneurs to disregard 
the closure of the borders and go to Iraqi Kurdistan to continue 
the regime's old policy of plundering and pillaging national 
assets and destroying the economic basis of the region. 
[passage omitted] 
  A glance at this antipopular attitude shows the depth of the 
regime's hostility toward the Kurdish people on both sides of 
the border. It also shows that by plundering and pillaging 
Iraqi Kurdistan it wants to destroy the livelihood of the people 
in this area and that it is determined to resort to violence 
toward the people in Iranian Kordestan to keep them impoverished. 
  The Islamic Republic is doing its best to upset things in 
Iraqi Kurdistan and it stops at no plot or unsuitable act in 
this direction. The clergymen are constantly trying to 
coordinate their policy and acts with Ankara and Damascus 
against the situation in Iraqi Kurdistan. 
  Clearly, the Islamic Republic is not satisfied with this 
and, 
by persistently trying to export narcotics and terrorist 
elements in a bid to spread corruption and insecurity in Iraqi 
Kurdistan, it is daily increasing the hostility it shows toward 
the Kurdish people in Iraqi Kurdistan. Undoubtedly, the people 
in Iraqi Kurdistan have realized the hostile nature of the 
clerical regime and know of its tension seeking policies. They 
know how hostile the Islamic Republic is toward the Kurdish 
people in general and how dissatisfied it is with things in 
Iraqi Kurdistan in particular. The people's hatred and aversion 
toward the Islamic Republic of Iran grow daily and the regime is 
regarded as the sworn enemy of the Kurds.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "New Step To Improve Relations </F>
Between Tel Aviv and Ankara"] 
  [Text] Shim'on Peres, foreign minister of the Zionist 
regime, has arrived in Ankara on a three-day official visit. 
Tel Aviv and Ankara officials will hold talks on the most 
important regional and international issues and the expansion 
and strengthening of relations between the Zionist regime and 
Turkey during his visit. 
  The high-ranking mutual visits between Ankara and Tel Aviv 
have significantly promoted their bilateral political relations. 
They have also promoted their relations on issues relating to 
trade, defense, and security. Turkey and the Zionist regime 
have reached agreements on free trade, improving bilateral trade 
relations, cooperation in the defense industry, improving 
relations in tourism, and supplying water from the Manavgat 
River to occupied Palestine. The main objective of Peres' visit 
to Ankara can be described as reaching a final agreement on the 
two countries' plan to supply water to Israel from the Manavgat 
River, which is on Turkey's Mediterranean coastline. 
  One of the main reasons why Tel Aviv wants to improve its 
relations with Ankara is the Zionist regime's need for the water 
of the Euphrates, Tigris, and Manavgat Rivers in Turkey. 
According to the Zionist regime's leading officials, Tel Aviv 
can solve the water problem, which stops many Jews resettling in 
the occupied land, that is, if that regime can have itself 
accepted as a country that shares the region's water resources 
with Ankara's support. The Zionist regime's officials are 
convinced that Turkey, as a NATO country and a close U.S. ally 
in the region, can make a significant contribution to the effort 
to step up the pace of the talks on the so-called Middle East 
peace plan. That will help the Zionist regime, which still 
occupies Jerusalem, to remain and increase its strength in the 
region. 
  That Islamic movements in Turkey and the region are 
gradually 
gaining strength must not be overlooked. Obviously, it has made 
Turkey and Israel uneasy. The recent victory achieved by the 
Prosperity Party in the local elections in Turkey is a clear 
sign of the strength the Islamic movement has gained in that 
country. The issue of Islamic movements has always been a 
priority in the talks held between Turkey and Israel. 
Undoubtedly, the issue will have priority in the talks that 
Shim'on Peres will have in Ankara. 
  Considering all that, Peres' visit to Turkey can be 
described 
as a new step to promote bilateral relations and draw the 
policies of the two sides closer. The objection of the Islamic 
people in Turkey, which is an Islamic country, to the 
improvement of Ankara's relations with the Zionist regime has 
worried the two sides. Both have identified the psychological 
obstacle. But officials of the two countries continue to 
promote their relations as much as possible. Political 
observers in the region have assessed the demonstrations held by 
thousands of Islamic people in Turkey against the United States 
and the Zionist regime on the eve of Peres' visit to Ankara as a 
warning against Tel Aviv's expansionist and hegemonist policies 
in the region.

  [Text] Tehran, April 14, IRNA -- The English daily `KAYHAN 
INTERNATIONAL' here Thursday commented on Iran-Pakistan ties and 
said that all the official and flowery expressions of 'concrete 
fraternal relations' were rich in rhetoric but poor in action. 
The daily wrote in its editorial that though the two leaderships 
thought alike in almost all areas, regional and international, 
they moved with delay when it came to reinforcing their 
economic, social, scientific and cultural ties. 
  The level of economic and cultural exchanges between 
Pakistan 
and Iran in the two years had been far from satisfactory, it 
added. 
  Referring to Majlis Speaker 'Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri's visit to 
Pakistan and the agreements reached between officials of the two 
countries, the article hoped that the follow-up work would be 
coordinated and implemented professionally as planned and the 
senior officials would not get so pre-occupied with 'priority 
issues' on their return home that they would forget what was 
agreed upon and signed during the visit. 
  The paper concluded by saying that "the existing situation 
is 
disturbing and may damage the excellent political ties Tehran 
and Islamabad enjoy. Our president and the leadership in 
Islamabad should identify and address issues to promote 
relations beneficial to the two Muslim peoples."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Moscow Talks, a New Text"] </F>
  [Text] As the Tajikistan peace talks continue in Moscow, 
the Tajik Labor Minister who heads his government's delegation, 
has expressed hopes that the outcome of the first round of talks 
would pave the way for signing of a final agreement by the 
leaders of two sides. 
  The talks are hosted by Russia and supervised by Iran, 
Pakistan and Afghanistan. 
  The new mediation initiated by Russia and Iran, is in fact a 
new attempt to restore stability to crisis spots in Central Asia 
and the Caucasus by the two influential countries in the region. 
  But in order for this cooperation to continue, mutual trust 
is required. The Russians have once attempted to launch a coup 
d'etat in Tajikistan without taking into account the wishes of 
the Tajik Muslims and today we are watching how the Russians are 
sinking deeper in the quagmire they themselves have created in 
Tajikistan. 
  In this round of the peace talks too, the Russians witnessed 
that Iran used its "spiritual influence" among the combatant 
Tajik groups and urged them to attend the Moscow talks. But as 
influential opposition leaders such as Akbar Tourjanzadeh and 
Sharif Hematzadeh were on their way to Moscow, news from the 
Russian capital indicated the participation of a low-level 
delegation on behalf of the Tajik government. In other words, 
none of the regime ruling over Dushanbe are attending the Moscow 
talks. This move in itself would create a sense of "mistrust" 
in the combatant Tajik groups towards the real intention of the 
Russians and the Dushanbe government. 
  If the Russians are really for restoration of peace and 
tranquility in Tajikistan, they should prepare the ground for 
the people's rule and sovereignty while at the same time 
maintain an impartial stance in the mediation efforts. 
  Regrettably, news from Tajikistan is of continued pressure 
on 
and torture of the people of Badakhshan and Pamir, as well as 
those migrants who are now returning to their villages, by the 
Tajik government. A halt to these crimes is necessary as a sign 
of goodwill by the Tajik government in order to guarantee the 
continuation of the talks and fulfillment of a peaceful solution.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Lebanon Arrests Two Iraqi Diplomats </F>
Following Assassination of Figure Opposed to Baghdad Government"] 
  [Excerpts] London, Beirut, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Lebanese 
security forces yesterday announced that an Iraqi oppositionist 
holding a Jordanian passport was shot dead the night before last 
in the area of 'Ayn al-Tinah in Beirut. 
  Lebanese security forces said that the murdered person is 
Talib Suhayl, an Iraqi oppositionist in exile who had lived in 
Lebanon for several years. [passage omitted] 
  In London, the "Free Iraqi Council" [FIC], an Iraqi 
opposition organization, has confirmed that Talib 'Ali Suhayl 
was a member of the council's Central Committee and leader of 
the Bani Tamim tribe. It added that he was found dead in his 
apartment in Beirut the day before yesterday. FIC sources say 
that early information indicates that Iraqi Government organs 
were behind the assassination operation. In a statement, a copy 
of which AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has received, the council said an 
armed group stormed Talib Suhayl's apartment and shot him. 
  The council pointed out that the dead man had on several 
occasions told his family and FIC Chairman Sa'd Salih Jabr about 
telephone murder threats he had received in recent months from 
elements belonging to the regime of Iraqi President Saddam 
Husayn. 
  The statement, signed by Sa'd Salih Jabr, said that Talib 
Suhayl was forced to leave Amman, his permanent residence, as a 
result of these threats. He moved between a number of capitals, 
the latest was Beirut. [passage omitted] 
  Elsewhere, the support office of the Supreme Assembly of the 
Islamic Revolution in Iraq issued a statement yesterday in which 
it cited strong rumors about President Saddam Husayn's health. 
Dr. Hamid al-Bayyati, FIC representative in London, said that 
circles close to the authorities (in Baghdad) leaked information 
about Saddam's suffering from a serious illness as a result of 
which he is confined to bed, and that a team of doctors are 
supervising his treatment for hysterical nervous fits following 
which he goes into a coma for many hours.

time. "The tyrant might be afflicted with a dangerous disease 
that has forced him to be confined to his bed. A group of 
doctors is attempting to cure him of fits of (?madness). 
Citizens have noticed that Baghdad Television is showing shots 
of old occasions, which has raised doubts about what is 
happening to the tyrant recently."

  [Excerpts] Amman--The Iraqi parliamentarians headed for 
France on Tuesday to attend a session of the European Parliament 
where they are expected to make a strong pitch for the release 
of frozen Iraqi assets and an end to the 45-month old 
international sanctions against their country. 
  Abd-al-Karim 'Abbas and Bashir Qadim, members of the Foreign 
Affairs Committee of the Iraqi Parliament, are expected to 
present a summary of the impact of the sanctions against their 
country and argue that Baghdad has satisfactorily met with all 
demands of the United Nations Security council, diplomats said. 
  One of the immediate Iraqi requests to be made formally and 
informally at the Strasbourg meetings is expected to be for an 
unfreezing of Iraqi assets that remain frozen in some of the 
European countries. [passage omitted]. 
  At the outset of the Gulf crisis, Iraqi assets frozen abroad 
were estimated to be worth around $4 billion. Since then some 
of the governments have publicly released the funds while others 
have clandestinely entered agreements with the Iraqi government. 
Under the agreements, some of the governments agreed that part 
of the frozen assets be used to pay for Iraqi imports from their 
countries and part be used as collateral to guarantee Iraqi 
letters of credit. 
  In the maze of a confusing array of arrangements that the 
Iraqi government has entered into with many sympathetic Western 
and Third World governments, the actual amount that remains in 
the frozen accounts is not known. 
  "I don't think many senior Iraqi officials themselves know 
what is left and what has been appropriated in their inter-bank 
arrangements and agreements," said a source closely familiar 
with Iraqi moves in the international market. 
  The two Iraqi members of Parliament are expected to issue a 
public appeal for the release of frozen Iraqi assets in the 
member countries of the European Union (EU) as well as for EU 
support for Baghdad's call for an end to the international 
sanctions. 
  A diplomat said Iraq "will have a listening audience 
particularly from among French members of the European 
Parliament." The diplomat noted that France has stood out among 
the five permanent members of the Security Council to argue that 
Iraq deserved an easing of the crippling sanctions. (passage 
omitted] 
  Meanwhile, an Italian business delegation is expected here 
Wednesday after a visit to Baghdad. 
  Diplomatic sources said Iraqi officials who met with the 
delegation raised the issue of unfreezing Iraqi assets held in 
Italian banks. Some of the banks have already entered 
unpublicised arrangements with the Iraqi government, but others 
are believed to be holding back. 
  The delegation includes businessmen and officials of the 
Arab-Italian Chamber of Commerce, but the team's trip to Baghdad 
was not arranged or organised by the Italian governments, the 
Italian Embassy in Amman said. 
  During their stay in Amman, the delegation members will hold 
talks with their Jordanian counterparts on issues related to 
Jordanian-Italian trade.

  [Text] A responsible source from the Islamic Resistance 
forces inside the marshlands of southern Iraq has affirmed that 
the authorities of tyrant Saddam have reinforced their troops 
and weapons in the east of al-'Amarah Governorate, especially in 
the (al-Tshakkah) marshland. The source added in a statement to 
the media center of the Supreme Assembly of the Islamic 
Revolution in Iraq that in the past few days the Islamic 
Resistance's monitoring groups have recorded movement and 
changes in the regime's forces on the road between the al-Kahla' 
district and al-Musharrah subdistrict. It also saw large 
numbers of military units taking up positions in strategic areas 
near the [name indistinct] marshland. 
  The source said that the dictator forces deployed a number 
of 
large-caliber artillery and mortar battalions and brought down 
to the shores of (al-Tshakkah) marshland large numbers of 
military boats carrying [words indistinct] and armed with 
large-caliber artillery. 
  The source announced that the resistance forces in the south 
took steps and measures to thwart tyrant Saddam's attempts to 
annihilate the residents and areas of the marshlands. The 
resistance in fact started implementing a number of protective 
operations to hamper the regime's intelligence forces east of 
al-'Amarah Governorate by blowing up bridges and strategic roads 
that the regime's forces use in their maneuvers and movements. 
They also continued their attacks in the above-mentioned areas.

  [Text] The Islamic resistance forces last week carried out 
two brave operations in which they succeeded in blowing up and 
destroying large parts of the road that links the al-Kahla' 
district to the subdistrict of al-Musharrah at various points. 
In addition, they blew up the (al-Ghutayji) bridge across the 
(al-Ghutayji) River, which is a tributary of the al-Musharrah 
River and pours into the al-Qubbah marshland east of the 
al-'Amarah Governorate. 
  He added that the targets were considered two of the most 
important roads of communication used by the regime's forces in 
transporting equipment and troops recently. 
  A source in the Islamic resistance forces clarified that 
resistance groups distributed leaflets in the places where the 
regime's forces were deployed. They warned these forces against 
becoming involved in the regime's bloody schemes. It called on 
them to disobey orders and direct their weapons at tyrant 
Saddam's aides and his collapsing regime, which is on the brink 
of annihilation.

  [Text] Baghdad, 13 Apr (INA)--Oil Minister Dr. Safa' Hadi 
Jawad has said that Iraq is making preparations to sign new oil 
deals with several European firms next month. 
  In a statement to the newspaper AL-JUMHURIYAH published here 
today, Jawad added that the cooperation talks between Iraq and 
European oil corporations have reached an advanced stage, noting 
that preparations are currently under way for signing several 
contracts with these firms after the recent conclusion of 
cooperation agreements with French oil firms. 
  The minister addressed the issue of oil cooperation between 
Iraq and Turkey, saying that the Turkish side has demonstrated 
an urgent desire to reopen the Iraqi oil pipeline across Turkey, 
particularly since the latter is suffering from an unemployment 
that is having political and economic effects. 
  The minister asserted that the oil pipeline that runs across 
Turkish territory is ready for operation once the Iraq sanctions 
are lifted.

  [Text] Baghdad, 13 Apr (INA)--Ahmad Murtada Ahmad, minister 
of transportation and communications, has stressed Iraq's 
readiness to discuss and study the signing and implementation of 
contracts with Italian firms and institutions in the fields of 
transportation and communications. 
  During a meeting today with Italian members of parliament 
Antonio Catika and Joseph Sarta [names as received], the 
minister said that such contracts would include railroads, 
communications, aviation, airlines, maritime transportation, 
trucks, and buses, and could be worth billions of dollars. 
  He said Italian firms had benefited from the extensive 
commercial ties that once existed between Iraq and Italy. He 
said such firms suffered grave losses as a result of the unfair 
embargo imposed on Iraq by the U.S. Administration. 
  The two Italian parliament members stressed that they will 
brief the Italian parliament during its next session on their 
impressions of the situation in Iraq and the suffering of the 
Iraqi people as a result of the blockade. They will also brief 
the Italian parliament on the extensive business prospects 
available for Italian firms in Iraq.

  [Text] Baghdad, 13 Apr (INA) -- The newspaper AL-THAWRAH 
says that any observer of political developments can easily see 
that the countdown for the removal of some aspects of the 
embargo has begun due to several national constants, as well as 
a host of significant Arab and international changes. 
  In an article contributed by Dr. Safa' Salih al-'Umar, 
member 
of the National Assembly and chairman of the Arab and 
International Relations Committee of the Assembly, the paper 
adds that this has been manifested in the political and economic 
positions of several states that are currently attempting to 
clearly reformulate their positions toward several hot issues on 
the international scene. 
  AL-THAWRAH, which speaks for the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party, 
notes that the Iraqi people's harsh daily sufferings under the 
sanctions, as well as the immense sacrifices they have made 
during the 30-state aggression, along with the intense efforts 
made by Iraqis and some Arab and international parties, have all 
contributed toward explaining this suffering and mobilizing 
opposition to the continued enforcement of the sanctions within 
popular and official quarters. 
  The paper argues that the financial losses several states 
and 
peoples have sustained due to the political and economic 
instability in the region, which is directly linked to the 
stability of Iraq and its regional economic, political, and 
security role, were also instrumental in effecting this change 
on the international scene. 
  AL-THAWRAH notes that the Iraqi people's suffering has been 
accompanied by heroic steadfastness in the face of all aspects 
of the aggression, be they political, military, informational, 
or psychological. The Iraqi people have persisted in this 
steadfastness in extremely harsh circumstances, something which 
prompted several Western political policymakers to reconsider 
the usefulness of this unfair position toward the Iraqi people, 
as well as its potential harm for the region and their 
countries' interests. 
  The paper goes on to say: The Western political policymakers 
have continued their efforts to maintain and foster the state of 
imbalance in the Arab region-- as state of insecurity and 
instability. Sometimes, the West uses this tactic to quietly 
create footholds in the region. At other times, it enters the 
region militarily through exaggerated publicity to maintain this 
imbalance by various means, such as the fuelling of local or 
regional wars. 
  AL-THAWRAH concludes by saying that the objective that lies 
before us at present should not be confined to lifting the 
sanctions. We should also be able to define our positions in 
the post-sanctions era toward a host of national and 
humanitarian issues related to our progressive policy in line 
with the factors that we have mentioned, and in the context of 
the network of Arab and international relations created by 
changes on the Arab and international scene, changes that Iraq 
and its people have been experiencing over the past 10 years.

  [Text] It seems the honeymoon between the Paris-based 
AL-MUHARRIR and the Iraqi authorities is over. 
  In a dramatic development, Iraqi authorities decided to stop 
printing the paper in Iraq after it had been printed there for 
more than three years. The authorities decided to ban the entry 
and distribution of AL-MUHARRIR in Iraq after the Iraqi 
Information Ministry decided to seal off the paper's bureau and 
to ban its correspondent Akram Tahir Hassan from sending reports 
to the paper. 
  AL-BILAD's information emphasizes that the latest Iraqi 
measures have been taken against the backdrop of the radical 
changes recently introduced by AL-MUHARRIR. The Iraqi 
authorities stress that AL- MUHARRIR has come under the control 
of the Gulf regimes, except the great shaykhdom of Kuwait. 
  The deviation of AL-MUHARRIR from Baghdad's line has 
deprived 
it from selling thousands of copies in the Iraqi market, which 
are printed at the expense of the Iraqi people who are still 
suffering from the second Gulf war and from famine that the Gulf 
shaykhdoms are imposing in cooperation with the new world order.

  [Text] Cairo, 14 Apr (MENA)--The newspaper AL-AKHBAR has 
voiced astonishment at the U.S. Administration overlooking 
Israel's nuclear capability. It asserts that this oversight is 
not the result of ignorance, because the Israeli nuclear 
enterprise is known to all intelligence services. 
  In an editorial today, AL-AKHBAR refers to remarks made by 
U.S. sources that Israel will acquire 45 F-15E combat aircraft. 
It points out that this is the first time the United States has 
agreed to sell this sophisticated type of aircraft and says that 
these planes will enable the Israeli air force to carry out 
strikes against Libya, Iraq, and Iran. 
  AL-AKHBAR remarks that this raises questions about the U.S. 
position on Israel and causes much astonishment. 
  The paper asserts that the U.S. attitude to nuclear weapon 
proliferation is contradictory; while it pressures North Korea 
to open its nuclear facilities to international inspection, 
going as far as to threaten air strikes against it, it 
disregards any discussion of Israel's nuclear weapons, long 
deployed in the Negev. 
  AL-AKHBAR denounces the Israeli Government's refusal to sign 
the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in clear defiance of the 
international community. The paper says the Israeli 
intelligence services occasionally leak reports about the 
country's nuclear weapons so as to frighten Arab countries near 
and far.

  [Text] Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa has stated that the NATO 
strike against Serbian positions was an appropriate measure, 
although it was late. He added that it is necessary to halt the 
Serbian aggression by all possible means. The foreign minister 
was commenting on the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Regarding the protests against the strike, Foreign Minister 
'Amr Musa said that such protests are incomprehensible. It 
would have been better to protest the aggression, not the 
reaction to the aggression, he added. 
  Commenting on the situation in Rwanda, Foreign Minister 'Amr 
Musa stated that he telephoned OAU Secretary General Salem Ahmad 
Salem today to discuss the matter. He noted that Salem asked to 
inform President Mubarak, the current OAU chairman, of the 
situation prior to the meeting of the mechanism for settling 
African disputes in Addis Ababa at the ambassadors' level 
tomorrow. He added that the OAU secretary general will be 
informed of President Mubarak's position and instructions. 
  Musa pointed out that the Foreign Ministry is in touch with 
the embassy in Rwanda, adding that it will be closed if things 
get worse. He added that for the moment no instructions have 
been given to close the embassy down so that the situation can 
be viewed from there, since Egypt currently chairs the OAU. 
  Turning to Yemen, the foreign minister said that the 
situation there remains the same and that efforts are continuing 
on the matter. He added that he met with some Yemeni brothers 
in Cairo to follow up on the situation, noting that an Egyptian 
envoy is expected to travel to Yemen soon to try to calm things 
down and assure the safety of the Yemeni people.

  [Text] Cairo, 13 Apr (MENA)--Interior Minister Hasan 
al-Alfi has announced that the security agencies recently 
frustrated an extensive terrorist scheme involving 30 criminals 
led by two dangerous leaders. One of the leaders, 'Adil 'Awad 
Siyam, was killed and his brother-in-law, Muhammad 'Abd-al-'Alim 
Khalifah, was arrested. 
  During an international press conference today, al-Alfi 
disclosed the schemes of that organization, which sought to 
terrorize the safe citizens and destabilize the country with the 
ultimate goal of striking at economic development in Egypt. 
  The minister said that the security agencies seized an 
enormous amount of explosives, weapons, and ammunition in the 
hideout of these terrorists. Al-Alfi noted that nine hideouts 
of the terrorist group, which represents the military wing of 
the al-Jihad Organization, were stormed in several governorates 
at the same time and a large quantity of weapons and explosives 
were found. The operations were carried out in the presence of 
representatives from the Higher State Security Prosecution 
Office, experts from the criminal laboratory, and explosive 
experts. The three defendants, whose hiding places were 
stormed, were found in possession of 17,000 dollars, 3,000 
pounds sterling, and 9,000 Egyptian pounds, he added. A number 
of firearms were also seized, including two automatic rifles, an 
Israeli-made Uzi submachine gun, six pistols, 17 magazines of 
automatic weapons, various types of pistols, 582 nine-mm 
bullets, three RPG projectiles, three silencers, and a large 
quantity of firing pins, he added. 
  The interior minister added that searches conducted in the 
nine dens led to the seizure of 335 bombs of various types, 
explosives, quantities off sulphuric and nitric acids, ammonium 
nitrate, mercury, chlorine, and ammonium chloride. 
Approximately 150 kg of gelignite powder and another 150 kg of 
(?nitrate) powder, a highly explosive material, also were found 
in the terrorists' hideouts, in addition to a tricycle used as a 
trap, three wireless devices, a cordless telephone, and magnets 
used to attach explosives under vehicles. 
  The interior minister said that the security services 
seized organizational papers and documents containing 
information about the security of the installations and people 
and the method of producing explosives and preparing deceptive 
traps. The security services also seized a list of names of 
targeted figures, various organizational plans, the code used by 
the organization, and receipts for the transfer of foreign 
currency from abroad. 
  The interior minister explained that the security forces 
discovered in the possession of the captured terrorists a 
quantity of forged official papers, including military 
conscription cards, birth certificates, marriage certificates, 
passports, and identity cards as well as a large quantity of 
police and military uniforms and officers' ranks. 
  The interior minister noted that the security services also 
seized various types of vehicles belonging to the organization, 
including vehicles used in operations that members of the 
organization have admitted they carried out. 
  The interior minister said that the security services found 
a 
Yemeni passport belonging to the first accused, 'Adil 'Awad 
Siyam, commander of the organization's military wing, who was 
killed in the al-Munib area in al-Jizah in the past few days. 
  During the international news conference, which was attended 
by more than 100 correspondents from Egyptian and Arab 
newspapers and Arab and foreign news agencies, the interior 
minister noted that because of the detective work carried out by 
various security services following the assassination of Sayyid 
Ahmad Abu-Yahya, the first witness in the case of Prime Minister 
Dr. 'Atif Sidqi, and the wounding of his friends who were with 
him during the attack, the State Security Investigations 
Department was able to uncover an extremely dangerous terrorist 
group commanded by 'Adil 'Awad Ahmad Mahmud Siyam, commander of 
the military wing of the al-Jihad Organization in Egypt, who is 
considered one of the most dangerous terrorists to be found in 
recent years. 
  The interior minister said that members of the State 
Security 
Investigations Department also monitored the movements of the 
second terrorist commander, Muhammad 'Abd-al-'Alim Muhammad 
Khalifah, brother-in-law of terrorist 'Adil. 
  The interior minister added that the organization was made 
up 
of a large number of terrorists who were given sophisticated 
training, with the knowledge of the two mentioned commanders, in 
the arts of combat, marksmanship, and the manufacture of various 
types of explosives. He noted that the investigation confirmed 
that terrorist 'Adil 'Awad Siyam assumed responsibility for this 
terrorist organization after his return to the country at the 
instructions of the central command of the terrorist al-Jihad 
organization abroad and after receiving advanced military 
training on the use of all types of weapons and the preparation, 
manufacture, and use of bombs and explosives. 
  The interior minister added: In light of the 
investigations made by the State Security Investigations 
Department and after taking all legal measures, the movements of 
the organization were monitored on tape and by sound and 
accurate observations were intensified until the aforementioned 
terrorist was confirmed to be the link between the terrorist 
organization's elements in the country and its leaders abroad. 
  He added that the investigations also confirmed that 
terrorist leader 'Adil 'Awad Siyam was in control and had such 
great influence on his group that he was convinced of the need 
to commit suicide when arrested to maintain the secrecy of the 
organization and its membership. 
  He said that the investigations confirmed that this 
organization's members were experienced in criminal acts, 
high-risk operations, and vehicle theft and were using aliases 
and a secret code in their contacts and movements. He added 
that these terrorists used the slums and remote areas as centers 
for their activities, depots for their weapons and ammunitions, 
and lairs for hiding. Investigations also showed that the 
organization included a large number of cadres that were well 
prepared and that 30 of these terrorist organization's cadres 
were monitored. 
  The interior minister then said: After asking for permission 
from the Higher State Prosecution Office and taking the 
necessary legal measures, antiterrorist units that are highly 
trained to combat terrorism and to undertake this type of 
confrontation were prepared and sent on time to arrest the 
organization's members and raid its lairs, which had been 
accurately monitored beforehand. 
  He added that security action resulted in the death of the 
dangerous terrorist 'Adil 'Awad Siyam immediately after he 
opened fire on the forces that chased him. He was in a Fiat 128 
car with false license plates. The security forces opened fire 
and killed him. 
  Another leading terrorist who was with him, Muhammad 
'Abd-al- 
'Alim Khalifah, was arrested. A quantity of uniforms similar to 
those used by the Armed Forces and the police were found in the 
car together with a pair of field glasses, a forged identity 
card, and 4,260 pounds. 
  The interior minister said that the State Security 
Investigations Department arrested 30 members of the terrorist 
organization. He added that their names have not been made 
public because the investigation and their confessions indicate 
that other members are being chased and arrested. 
  He said that the names of the other members of the terrorist 
organization will be announced in a detailed statement that the 
ministry will issue after the operations are completed. 
  He added that the defendants gave detailed confessions on 
the 
terrorist operations they had carried out in the past, the most 
important of which was the assassination of citizen Ahmad 
Abu-Yahya on 4 February 1994, who was the primary witness in the 
failed attempt to assassinate Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif Sidqi. 
He said that the weapons used in that incident have been seized 
and noted that the results of the criminal laboratory's 
examinations confirmed the defendants' confessions. The 
vehicles used in that incident also were seized. He said that 
this organization also carried out the attempt to assassinate 
Interior Minister Hasan al-Alfi on 18 August 1993, which 
resulted in the death of terrorists Nazih Nushi Rashid and 
Diya'-al-Din Dawud. The defendants also confessed that they 
detonated the explosive device in the Shabab al-Jazirah Club on 
13 July 1993, which targeted some of the state security officers 
who were at the club for physical training. 
  Minister Musa noted that the defendants made detailed 
confessions on the assassination of 'Adil Anwar al-Sayyid, a 
dissident organization member, in front of his home in the Saray 
al-Qubbah area in Cairo on 3 July last year. In their 
confessions, the defendants stated that they had monitored and 
reconnoitered a number of public, political, executive, media, 
judicial, and military figures intending to assassinate them and 
thus create a media uproar meant to tarnish Egypt's reputation 
in the foreign media and shake the people's sense of security 
and stability. 
  The interior minister added that for that purpose the 
organization members took all the necessary steps to blow up 
booby-trapped cars by remote control to cause the maximum degree 
of demolition during the execution of these operations. All 
defendants have been referred to the Higher State Security 
Prosecutor's Office to proceed with the investigations, he added. 
  The minister described the uncovering of this major 
terrorist 
organization as one of the most successful security operations 
conducted by security men in their confrontation with the 
cowardly acts of terrorism carried out by a band of hired hands 
who seek to disrupt security and stability; harm innocent people 
such as the elderly, women, and children; and undermine the 
successful economic reforms. 
  The interior minister stressed that the security men have 
the 
initiative in their confrontation with the forces of evil and 
darkness. He added that these forces have deviated from their 
religion and have pursued ways offensive to the noble Islamic 
religion either to gain false leadership or to earn a few 
dollars by the implementation of a tightly planned scheme that 
primarily seeks to harm Islam and the Muslims. 
  He noted that the security agencies bear the brunt of 
confronting this malicious campaign launched by the modern day 
khawarij [members of a dissident Islamic sect that appeared in 
the 7th century]. He noted that the security strategy depends 
on broadening the circle of confrontation with all terrorist 
elements to frustrate their schemes, uproot them, and eliminate 
all the forces that stand behind them. 
  Reviewing the recent security measures, the interior 
minister 
noted that since the beginning of the year 20 major terrorist 
operations have been aborted. These operations include a series 
of planned explosions and assassinations of public figures that 
would have harmed innocent people, he added. During the same 
period, he added, 43 terrorists were arrested and a number of 
others were killed during exchanges of fire with security men; 
this was out of a total number of 52 terrorists wanted in 
connection with these cases. 
  He emphasized that the security agencies are capable of 
achieving the security and stability we all wish for, adding 
that the security forces are the shield of the people that 
safeguards the country with courage and boldness. He praised 
the close cooperation among the security agencies, the media, 
and the honest and courageous citizens who have supplied the 
security agencies with information out of their sense of 
loyalty. Thanks to this information, he added, this deviant 
band and their hideouts have been attacked. 
  Responding to a question on whether the security services 
have obtained new information on the assassination of Major 
General Ra'uf Khayrat last Saturday night and whether those 
services have been penetrated, the interior minister said that 
the incident is still under investigation and action is being 
taken to identify the culprits. He stressed that when an 
incident takes places it does not mean that the security 
services have been penetrated but, on the contrary, it is the 
security services that have penetrated these fugitive terrorist 
groups and this has helped abort dozens of attempts. 
  Replying to another question about the campaign and whether 
there is coordination between all the services in confronting 
terrorism, Hasan al-Alfi stressed that there is full 
coordination between all the services, especially between the 
security services and the media. 
  Regarding the sources of these weapons and how the 
terrorists 
are getting them, the interior minister said that many of these 
weapons are surplus from former wars and others are being 
brought in across the borders. He stressed that there are 
strict measures to control the borders. 
  In reply to a question on the success achieved by the 
state's 
security services and whether a period of calm is expected, the 
interior minister said that all things are possible. He noted 
that the confrontation of every terrorist group with this 
ferocity and vast financial resources and the security forces' 
vigilance and readiness to make sacrifices for the sake of 
Egypt's security and stability are bound to achieve positive 
results. 
  On whether there is a link between the terrorist al-Jihad 
organization and the terrorist Vanguards of Conquest 
organization or whether the al-Jihad has more than one group, 
the interior minister stressed that the Vanguards of Conquest is 
one of al-Jihad's military groups. He noted that the Vanguards 
of Conquest is a branch of the terrorist al-Jihad organization. 
  Regarding the leaders who have fled abroad, the interior 
minister stressed that there are intensive efforts and constant 
contacts at all levels to apprehend these leaders. But he 
refused to divulge the names of these countries or persons 
because progress has been made in this matter. He said: It is 
in the public interest not to mention any details about them 
until the time is right. 
  In reply to the correspondents' questions, he explained that 
the terrorists began as a small group and then split into other 
groups. He noted that they have a single objective and took 
Islam as a cover, but that they are not Muslims. 
  Responding to a question on whether there is a link between 
the Muslim Brotherhood and these extremist terrorist groups, the 
interior minister stressed that the Muslim Brotherhood is a 
propagator of religion only but that the terrorist groups are 
advocates of violence and assassinations. 
  In response to a question on the possibility of a dialogue 
with these terrorist groups, the interior minister categorically 
denied that there is [words indistinct] and stressed that there 
is no dialogue with these terrorist groups. He asked: Dialogue 
with whom? A dialogue with killers and butchers? Does a state 
conduct a dialogue with killers and criminals? There is not a 
single country in the world that conducts a dialogue with 
killers and criminals who order the killing of innocent people 
with firearms and explosives. 
  On another question about reports that the extremist groups 
are digging a tunnel under Salim Salih Street to be used for 
explosives to ambush and assassinate important figures, the 
interior minister said these reports are "irresponsible." He 
said that the Public Prosecution Office is investigating these 
reports and that everything will be announced when the 
investigation is completed. 
  On the security services' success in eliminating 82 percent 
of the terrorists and whether the rest have a major role in 
terrorist operations, Minister al-Alfi stressed that the 
remaining minority is behind these terrorist actions and the 
sabotage.

<F P=106> [Commentary by 'Atif 'Umar: "Don't Close Every Door to the </F>
Palestinian People"] 
  [Text] Today is 13 April, the date to which Israel 
committed itself, saying it would implement the Declaration of 
Principles Agreement with the Palestinians regarding withdrawal 
from Gaza and Jericho in preparation for the establishment of 
self-rule in this area and as a confirmation of its true desire 
to establish genuine peace with the Palestinians, in particular, 
and the Arab states in general. Despite Israel's commitment to 
this date, Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres stated that 
things had been postponed until the end of this month. Before 
news agencies could confirm the date, Israeli Prime Minister 
Yitzhaq Rabin made a statement in which he declared that the 
agreement on the implementation of the Declaration of Principles 
might be signed in the middle of next month. 
  A sense of despair is increasing among the Palestinian 
people 
inside and outside the occupied territory, especially following 
a new decision by the Israeli Government to import foreign 
workers to replace the Palestinian workers employed by some 
Israeli companies in the occupied Palestinian territory. This 
decision has dangerous implications for the Palestinian people 
as it affects their livelihood and their right to maintain a 
decent life in the land on which they were born and raised. It 
might push the Palestinian people in the occupied territory into 
extreme despair, the result of which no one can calculate. When 
life and death become equal, the resulting reaction could be 
difficult to predict or calculate. Perhaps what happened in 
'Afula and that led to regression in the peace process proves 
the truth of what we say. Credibility in abiding by the 
articles agreed upon and the dates set to implement what is 
concluded between the two negotiating parties is essential-- if 
there are indeed sincere intentions to resolve the Palestinian- 
Israeli differences. 
  The Palestinians in the Cairo negotiations have agreed to 
postpone the implementation until the end of this month, 
according to the Israeli foreign minister's statement. This is 
because the PLO doesn't want to miss any chance for the 
Palestinian people to secure their rights and emphasize the 
Palestinian desire to establish permanent and viable peace with 
Israel and solve the Middle East conflict according to the 
principle of land for peace, which was endorsed by the 
international community in Madrid. 
  Israel's continuing attempts to postpone the implementation 
of the Gaza-Jericho Agreement places Israel in a position that 
we think is not in its favor. The PLO has offered everything 
that could advance the peace negotiations and achieve permanent 
peace in the Middle East and all the Arab capitals have 
expressed their support and backing for every step to achieve an 
agreement that will restore security and peace to the Middle 
East, providing this is done on a just basis.

  [Excerpt] Bonn, 13 Apr (MENA)--Qatari Foreign Minister 
Shaykh Hamad Bin-Jasim Al Thani has stated that his country is 
not trying to undermine the importance of the Suez Canal as a 
vital artery for world trade. In a statement to the MENA 
correspondent in Bonn, he said no agreement has been concluded 
with Israel on transporting gas through al-'Aqabah Port [name of 
port as transmitted], as German media have reported. 
  Shaykh Hamad said the press has inflated this issue, which 
does not exist, indicating that any dealings between Qatar and 
Israel hinge on the termination of its occupation of all Arab 
territories occupied in 1967. He explained that the gas export 
agreement was concluded with an Italian firm, which then delayed 
its implementation. 
  On Qatar's relations with Iraq, Shaykh Hamad said his 
country 
deals with peoples and not with regimes. He indicated that 
contacts between Doha and Baghdad depend on Iraq's 
implementation of the UN resolutions. He spoke about the 
importance of cooperation and resolving differences among the 
Arab states, indicating that the Arab world cannot bear any new 
differences at present. 
  Shaykh Hamad said that in the event a Gulf state is 
threatened, help should come from the friendly Arab states 
before it comes from foreign countries. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Riyadh, April 14 (AFP)--Saudi Arabia plans to buy 
submarines to protect its coastlines both along the Gulf and the 
Red Sea, the official news agency SPA reported Thursday. 
  Deputy Defence Minister 'Abd-al-Rahman Bin-'Abd-al-Aziz, 
quoted by SPA, told naval officers in al-Dammam on Wednesday 
that his country wanted submarines which could adapt to the Red 
Sea and the more shallow waters of the Gulf. 
  Prince 'Abd-al-Rahman did not disclose if negotiations had 
opened for buying the vessels. 
  Iran, across the oil-rich Gulf from the Saudi kingdom, 
bought 
three submarines from Russia in 1992, raising concern among its 
Arab neighbours and their Western allies which have a naval 
presence in the strategic waterway. 
  SPA also reported that the national guard on Wednesday wound 
up a week of exercises on the Gulf coast of eastern Saudi Arabia.

April meetings in the economic and commercial capital, Aden, led 
by brothers Brigadier General Haytham Qasim Tahir, the defense 
minister, and Brigadier General 'Abd-al-Malik al-Sayyani, the 
chief of the general staff. 
  Over the four days, the committee discussed the best ways to 
implement Council of Ministers' decision number 39 on the basis 
of the accord document concerning the military forces. 
  The Yemeni News Agency, SABA', learned that a 
comrade-in-arms 
spirit, sincere Yemeni brotherhood, and a unionist spirit 
prevailed in the committee's meeting. All felt the importance 
of their meetings and their continuation in order to achieve the 
tasks assigned to the committee, which are based on the accord 
document's implementation, as emphasized by the meeting of the 
Council of Ministers. 
  SABA' learned that the committee will continue its meetings 
in the Ta'izz Governorate early next week to complete what is 
left of these tasks, to work out a plan for military movements, 
and to eliminate any military tensions. The committee will 
present the Defense Ministry's plan to the Council of Ministers 
during its next meeting. 
  The Military Committee meetings were attended by a member of 
the Jordanian military committee, and the U.S. and French 
military attaches.

<F P=106> [Interview with Salim Salih Muhammad, member of the Yemeni </F>
Presidential Council and assistant secretary general of the 
Socialist Party, by unidentified reporter in Amman; date not 
given] 
  [Text] [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] What are the results of your 
visits to Syria and Jordan and the meetings you held with 
President Hafiz al-Asad and King Husayn? 
  [Muhammad] The visits are considered successful. We have 
come out with the impression that there is clear Arab interest 
in our conditions in Yemen and in helping us with the support of 
our brothers in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Syria, Egypt, and 
Jordan. We have sensed interest in helping Yemen to overcome the 
problems and difficulties facing unity. And we have learned 
what role fraternal Arab countries can play to help Yemen to 
surmount its predicament and eliminate any contemplation of a 
military action. Because this option is incompatible with 
domestic conditions and the stability of this vital region, 
which is the focus of the world's eyes, not only for political 
considerations, but clear economic and geographical 
considerations as well. 
  [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] Did you request the continuation of Arab 
mediation in general or just the Jordanians' efforts to follow 
up what was agreed in Amman? 
  [Muhammad] Yes, we have asked the Syrian, Jordanian, and 
Egyptian brothers and some Arab brothers to continue their role, 
specifically Jordan, on the grounds that it is represented in 
the military committee. It also has a political role in the 
current dialogue process. And the Pledge Document was signed in 
Amman. Of course, there are developments now, and an Arab 
presence has begun to take shape. 
  [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] It is said that there is a move to hold 
a four-way Arab summit in Damascus to discuss the crisis in 
Yemen. Did you discuss this issue in Syria? 
  [Muhammad] I have not heard about that. However, 
preparations are being made to hold an expanded meeting in Cairo 
in which all Arab parties concerned, including the Arab League 
and Yemeni leaderships, will participate. No date has been set 
yet. This idea emerged during the Egyptian and United Arab 
Emirates envoys' visits to Yemen. The Yemeni leaderships did 
not object. They welcomed the idea of holding the meeting in 
Cairo. 
  [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] Some observers believe that all the 
present Arab and international initiatives are aimed at fighting 
the religious extremism represented in some Yemeni Reform 
Grouping [YRG] elements. What is your position in this 
connection? 
  [Muhammad] Those claims are made by elements linked to the 
YRG. But the real fear is the orientation toward establishing a 
fascist state relying on the arms stockpile totaling at least 1 
million rifles, according to the interior minister's recent 
statement. This orientation is the frightening one. Of course, 
there is a world Islamic movement whose capabilities are known. 
They are supported by several states, and I will not name any 
one state. Many of the states which agree with this idea have 
interests in this connection. They support such orientation in 
Yemen and elsewhere. They are the ones fueling religious 
extremism in the Arab world. 
  [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] It is reported that some parties are 
working to thwart the Amman agreement. Do you believe there are 
any indications of that? 
  [Muhammad] Those are premature conclusions. They are based 
on false information or positions that must be rectified, not 
only to end Yemen's crisis, but also to improve Arab relations 
in general and to eliminate any sensitivity among states. 
Obviously much information, and coordination among Arab states, 
have to be corrected. 
  [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] Why have the Yemenis not referred their 
case to the Arab League, the official Arab establishment 
entrusted with looking into such cases? 
  [Muhammad] We never turned to the Arab League in the past, 
nor do we favor turning to it now. We prefer Arab efforts from 
any Arab country. These efforts have so far been made by the 
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, Oman, and the United 
Arab Emirates. We appreciate these efforts and welcome their 
continuation. We believe they lead us to more success than the 
routine efforts made by official organs in the League or 
elsewhere. 
  [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] Is it true that the Aden leadership 
prefers a federation to Yemeni unity in its present form? 
  [Muhammad] About 75 percent of the document talks about a 
federation, so let us begin there. As to why we do not talk 
about it openly, perhaps the word arouses some sensitivity. 
This is why we avoid announcing that, since the document itself 
talks in practice about points leading to a federation.

<F P=106> [Report by Hamud Munsir: "Danger of Tribal Dispute and </F>
Political Isolation Threaten Yemeni Reform Grouping"] 
  [Text] Sanaa -- The Yemeni Reform Grouping [YRG] -- the 
third partner in the ruling coalition in Sanaa -- is faced with 
two problems: One at the tribal level, namely with the main 
tendency in its formation, and another at the political level. 
The two problems threaten to reduce its role in power in the 
future as a result of the tribal dispute between the Hashid 
tribe, from which the grouping's leadership comes, and the Bakil 
tribe. And also because of the external moves and bilateral 
contacts between its partners in power: The General People's 
Congress [GPC] and the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP]. [passage 
omitted) 
  Corroborated information obtained by AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT says 
that the Nasirite Unionist Party -- an opposition party -- has 
not yet decided to open a dialogue with the YRG, because the 
latter is a partner in government. Meanwhile the YRG feels 
isolated because of its exclusion from many of the consultations 
inside the ruling coalition, especially after the YSP sensed 
some contradictions between the GPC and the Reform Grouping and 
thus began to exploit them. 
  However, observers point to a kind of breakthrough toward a 
solution to the crisis in the light of the mediation efforts 
made by Egypt and the United Arab Emirates. They expect a 
meeting to be held between President Salih and Vice President 
al-Bid in Cairo at the beginning of next month at the latest to 
restore stability to Yemen before the unity anniversary on 22 
May.

  [Text] Lieutenant General 'Umar al-Bashir, the president of 
the Republic, has stressed that rebel John Garang's recent visit 
to Israel was made after the failure of the self-determination 
proposal put forward by the rebel movement and its failure to 
internationalize the problem of the south. This was also 
accompanied by the routing of its forces. 
  Speaking today during his meeting with media leaders at the 
secretariat general of the Council of Ministers building, Lt. 
Gen. al-Bashir said it had been confirmed that Israel and the 
Zionist lobby were promoting an anti-Sudan media campaign in the 
West and that Israel was using Garang as one of its tools with 
which to fight the Sudanese Government. The president of the 
Republic referred to the symposium organized by a number of 
well-known leftist movements in Cairo to be held on 14 May which 
is just two days before the resumption of negotiations between 
the Sudanese Government and the rebel movement in Nairobi. He 
said the organizers of this symposium had invited John Garang 
and Riak Machar to attend. 
  During his meeting, Lt. Gen. al-Bashir stressed that the 
Western world was trying to stir up discord in Africa, referring 
in this context to the Israeli enemy's aim to gain control of 
the sources of the Nile in the African continent with their 
water resources, in order to put pressure on the main forces in 
the region. The president of the Republic stressed the need for 
the Africans to take the initiative to solve disputes within the 
continent so as to preserve its security and stability. 
  Lt. Gen. al-Bashir declared that the rebel movement's 
refusal 
to sign the relief agreement with the government revealed that 
the movement secretly intended to obstruct relief efforts in 
order to prepare the way for foreign intervention in Sudan. His 
excellency reiterated the Sudanese Government's determination to 
ensure that relief operations were successful.

  [Excerpts] Four days following the Council of Ministers' 
approval of the letter of intent which the government had sent 
to the IMF and after the explanations given by Economics 
Minister Benachnou in many press statements about the effects of 
the agreement on the Algerian economy as a whole, Abdelouahab 
Keramane, governor of the Algerian Bank, who accompanied the 
economic minister to the talks with the IMF, assesses the 
results of these talks with this financial institution by saying 
that Algeria reached an agreement which is least difficult for 
the Algerian Bank. 
  IMF support for Algeria is important, Keramane said, and the 
IMF's one billion dollar contribution is considered very 
important in connection with the one-year program which is aimed 
at enabling economic stability for Algeria. Here is Ahmed 
Khider with details. 
  [Khider] Abdelouahab Keramane's answers revolved round the 
financial side and its unfolding. They came following the 
explanations given recently by the economic minister about the 
effects of the agreement on the Algerian national economy as a 
whole. 
  Mr. Abdelouahab Keramane, who addressed public opinion for 
the first time in his capacity as the governor of the Algerian 
Bank through APS, summarized his assessment of the agreement 
with the IMF by saying that Algeria reached an agreement which 
is the least harmful and difficult for the Algerian Bank. 
  The governor of the Algerian Bank consolidated his positive 
assessment of the agreement by putting forward a number of 
points which he presented as advantages in view of the 
conditions under which the talks with the IMF unfolded. These 
points include: 
  -- First: social difficulties impose the search for a 
gradual 
transitional phase and the avoidance of what is commonly called 
the shock treatment. 
  -- The level of the dinar devaluation is reasonable, 
necessary, and sufficient. 
  -- The percentages of indebtedness to banks will be 
continuous proportionally [as heard]. 
  -- It is expected that the level of loans for the economy 
would not increase that much, however, the level of the debt 
rates will [as heard]. 
  -- No other sudden measures are expected and it is 
possible to review the interest rates with a view to reducing 
them should the situation allow it. 
  -- The devaluation of the dinar should not lead to a big 
rise in prices. Controlling inflation is the most important way 
of protecting the families' purchasing power. 
  -- It will be easier for the production sector to import 
means of production. 
  -- Measures will be taken for liberalizing foreign trade. 
  -- The program for economic stability will enable Algeria 
to reach the Dinar convertibility. 
  -- The problem of losses in the change was taken into 
account by the authorities during the talks with IMF. [passage 
omitted] 
  Keramane also stressed that the financial support of the IMF 
is a fundamental support for the Algerian balance of payments, 
and it is a hint from the IMF to the international community and 
also to the world banking and monetary systems.

  [Text] Veteran Algerian opposition figure Hocine Ait Ahmed 
held a news conference in Paris this afternoon. Ait Ahmed is 
president of the Front of Socialist Forces, a very influential 
party in the region of Kabylia. Mr. Ait Ahmed appealed for 
dialogue. Farida Ayari asked him why he is making such an 
appeal: 
  [Begin recording] [Ahmed] Because civil war is the worst 
thing that can happen to our country. I refuse this possibility 
because a civil war is an insult to intelligence and to reason. 
  [Ayari] One is tempted to ask why dialogue, since the only 
two real forces in Algeria today are the army and the Islamists. 
If those two talk, might one not end up with an alliance 
between the army and the Islamists, as has happened in Iran or 
in Sudan? 
  [Ahmed] You speak of dialogue between two protagonists. This 
is the very problem. You still know nothing about Algeria, 
unknown Algeria, with its population which refuses to side 
either with the authorities or with the Islamists, and which 
just suffers. We do not have one section of the Algerian people 
taking up arms against another section. This is why I say that 
there is not a civil war. So dialogue yes, between the 
protagonists, but especially between the representatives of the 
most representative political parties. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Unattributed editorial: "Call To Order in Algiers"] </F>
  [Text] The resignation of the government of Redha Malek, 
who was succeeded on Monday, 11 April, by Mokdad Sifi, former 
minister of equipment, above all served as a warning. When 
thanking Mr. Malek, who had become a little too talkative for 
their liking, President Liamine Zeroual, and through him the 
Army commanders, sent out a very clear message, namely, that it 
is they, and not the civilian leaders, who are responsible for 
managing the crisis. It is they, and not the "politicians," 
even if they are the actual government leaders, who will decide 
what attitude to adopt vis-a-vis Islamist groups. 
  This change does not necessarily imply that an ideological 
turning point has been reached. The departure of Redha Malek is 
totally in keeping with the (khaki-colored) "cleansing" 
precedents at the top. His predecessor, Belaid Abdesalam, who 
was held in contempt by the French-speaking elite, which had 
described him as a "secular assimilationist," was not merely a 
victim of his political opinions. In the eyes of the military, 
his main failing was that he had not managed to succeed in 
regaining the confidence of leaders in Western capitals, whose 
financial support has become crucial for the country. 
  Paradoxically, it is quite for the opposite reasons that 
Redha Malek, a career diplomat who prided himself on being on a 
particularly good footing with the United States, was cruelly 
forced to resign. His resignation came two days after Algiers 
had sent a "letter of intent" to the International Monetary Fund 
(IMF), a prelude to the signature of an agreement opening up the 
way for new loans and the rescheduling of Algeria's foreign debt. 
  In other words, Mr. Malek's mission had virtually been 
fulfilled. The military commanders, who were anxious that their 
"protege" should not become too important in the political 
arena, preferred to retire him early. On Sunday, the press was 
raising the prospect of an imminent ministerial reshuffle. 
Fueled by rumors, political circles had, for several days, 
already imagined that the prime minister might be on his way out. 
  The last week's dispute opposing the former prime minister 
and the secretary general of the Assembly for Culture and 
Democracy (RCD), Said Sadi, was not enough to save Mr. Malek. 
Distancing himself, somewhat belatedly, from the modernist 
camp, he did not succeed in convincing the authorities of his 
neutrality and his loyalty to the army. The fact that he 
recently described the Islamist groups as "barbarians," 
"traitors," and "anti-nationalists" irreversibly classed him 
among the so-called "eradicators" who are hostile to a dialogue 
with the heirs of the former Islamic Salvation Front (FIS). By 
adopting this position, he could not but embarrass the military 
hierarchy, which is more determined than ever to save the 
appearances of unity and cohesion.

on the basis of information, a terrorist network involved in an 
attempt to sabotage El Hadjar [steel] complex has been 
disbanded. The information led to the siege of a bakery in 
Guemar, the province of El Oued, the killing of four terrorists, 
the arrest of another six, and the seizure of a quantity of arms. 
  Investigations led to the arrest of 29 people in (Oued Souf) 
and 14 in Annaba, and the killing of 14 terrorists in a hideout 
in (Oued El Annab) and two terrorists in (Djebel Gamgam) in the 
province of Tebessa, where five gendarmes were killed in an 
exchange of fire. This terrorist network was composed of people 
from Guemar and Oued Souf. Some of them were lying in wait at 
El Hadjar complex and had started to execute a plan to 
assassinate members of the security and sabotagie El Hadjar 
complex. This group was active under the leadership of the

<F P=106> [News Commentary by Harihar Swarup] </F>
  [Text] A major achievement of Mr. Strobe Talbott's visit to 
New Delhi was clearing the misunderstanding between India and 
America. The misunderstanding could be attributed to lopsided 
perception of India's policies in Washington. President Bill 
Clinton had deputed Mr. Strobe Talbott, the deputy secretary of 
state in the U.S. Administration, to visit New Delhi and remove 
the misunderstanding. Mr. Talbott stated in New Delhi: My 
government attaches considerable significance to my visit. 
President Clinton and Secretary of State Christopher had asked 
me to come to India in order to consult Prime Minister Rao and 
other officials of the Indian Government on confidence [words 
indistinct] in which we can put together new impetus and new 
scope to U.S.-India relations. 
  It became clear at the end of Mr. Talbott's two-day visit 
that there was no American tilt toward any country and India and 
the United States was poised to turn a new leaf in bilateral 
relations. The sharp reaction evoked in India on Assistant 
Secretary of State Ms. Robin Raphel's controversial statement on 
Kashmir was more than clarified when Mr. Talbott categorically 
stated that it was for India and Pakistan to resolve the problem 
themselves in accordance with the Simla Agreement. India's 
concern on delivery of more F-16 aircraft was conveyed to Mr. 
Talbott in clear terms. The supply will be also against the goal 
of U.S. Government's declared policy to help in reducing tension 
in South Asia and discourage arms races between India and 
Pakistan. Mr. Talbott acknowledged at the conclusion of his 
visit that the greatest threat to India's security was from 
Pakistan's nuclear program. Then, when the United States is 
trying to make one-time exception to the Pressler Amendment on 
the ground that is further U.S. nonproliferation goals in South 
Asia. [sentence as heard] 
  Pakistan has developed nuclear weapon capability 
clandestinely. This is in clear violation of bilateral 
understanding with Washington. Earlier, the U.S. had given 40 
F-16 aircraft to Pakistan as a reward for their assurance that 
they would not go nuclear. Now, it seems the U.S. would like to 
reward Islamabad with another 38 planes for having gone nuclear. 
Until recently, the U.S. was stating categorically that even if 
the Pressler Amendment was deleted, Pressler standards will 
continue to apply. This position was rather given up suddenly 
and now one-time lifting of the Pressler Amendment is being 
advocated. This will leave Pakistan's nuclear arsenal developed 
secretly intact. No longer can a case be made that these 
aircraft are required by Pakistan to combat communism, or the 
Soviet Union, or the threat to Pakistan's security from Soviet 
invasion of Afghanistan. The sole target of U.S. supplied 
F-16's today can be in India. Mr. Talbott, said to be close to 
President Clinton, was also told that as part of the dialogue 
opened at India's initiative, Pakistan was urged to undertake 
various confidence-building measures both in conventional and 
nuclear fields. Both the countries have an agreement not to 
attack each other's nuclear installations. India has now 
offered Pakistan an agreement not to bomb each other's 
population centers and economic targets as well as an agreement 
not to use nuclear capabilities against each other. Pakistan is 
still reluctant to pursue seriously this dialogue. This 
attitude will undoubtedly get a boost by any U.S. decision to 
strengthen Pakistan's military capability against India. 
  Mr. Talbott appreciated India's economic reforms. The U.S. 
has now become the largest single investor in India. President 
Bill Clinton is also under pressure from powerful business lobby 
to ensure that the big Indian market is not jeopardized because 
of the political considerations. This is one reason for U.S. 
keenness to improve relations with India. The main irritant in 
Indo-U.S. relations is the issue of supply of additional F-16 
planes to Pakistan. The prime minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, 
has said that acquisition of F-16 fighter aircraft by Pakistan 
would disturb the security environment and escalate tension 
which would lead to an arms race in the region. It appears 
almost certain that the prime minister will visit U.S. some time 
next month in response to Bill Clinton's personal invitation to 
him. The only hitch could be supply of F-16 planes to Pakistan.

<F P=106> [Commentary by H.S. Rao of PTI] </F>
  [Text] A great deal of importance was attached to the visit 
of the U.S. deputy secretary of state, Mr. Strobe Talbott, to 
India and Pakistan. In New Delhi, the first (?stop) on his 
first foreign trip as U.S. deputy secretary of state, Strobe 
Talbott has had cordial and frank exchange of views with Indian 
leaders, including the prime minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao. 
During the discussions spreading over two days, Indian leaders 
conveyed India's concern on the proposed U.S. move to transfer 
F-16 aircraft to Pakistan. There were even indications that the 
U.S. persistence with the supply could cast a cloud over the 
prime minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao's visit to Washington. 
  As New Delhi sees it, F-16's would adversely affect the 
strategic balance against it in the region, forcing India to 
take appropriate measures diverting the much-needed resources 
from economic welfare programs and setting back the process of 
economic reforms. The future course of Indo-U.S. relations, it 
was clear, would be shaped by Washington's response to India's 
concern. As expected, Mr. Talbott defended the U.S. proposal in 
his talks at various levels, the ground that it was linked with 
the nuclear nonproliferation obligations on the part of 
Islamabad and that the aircraft would be transferred only if 
Pakistan agreed to verifiable cap on the production of weapon 
grade material. [sentence as heard] However, he told his hosts 
in New Delhi that he had noted India's strong views. 
  During the talks, Mr. Talbott was plainly told of the 
prevailing popular sentiment in India against the U.S. tilt 
toward Pakistan in [word indistinct] of the cold war attitude. 
India as was told did not like third parties to look for 
equality, parity, or balance between India and Pakistan. The 
territorial integrity of the country would not be sacrificed, 
the Indian side said, while emphasizing that Jammu and Kashmir 
was part of India. Mr. Talbott dealt with the tilt perception 
at his press conference. As he put it, the very word tilt 
belongs to the vocabulary of the past and specifically to the 
vocabulary of the cold war. The U.S. has good relations with a 
number of countries in the area -- certainly with India and 
certainly with Pakistan. On Kashmir, the position of Clinton 
administration, he said, is very simple and consistent. The 
United States hopes very much that India and Pakistan will be 
able to resolve this matter themselves as per the Simla 
Agreement. 
  Forty-seven year-old Talbott, a former TIME magazine editor 
and columnist, is a close friend of President Clinton. They 
shared a room as Rhodes scholars at Oxford University a quarter 
century ago. When Clinton visited Washington as governor of 
Arkansas, he often stayed at Talbott's home. One of the 
Talbott's assignments was to remove the sense of frustration in 
Indo-U.S. relations. After his one-hour long discussions with 
the prime minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, Mr. Talbott observed 
that no one person (?is fit) to bring about better understanding 
and cooperation between India and the U.S. than Mr. Rao himself. 
He also announced that Mr. Rao has accepted in principle an 
invitation to visit the United States and Mr. Clinton looks 
forward to receiving Mr. Rao to make the most of what the two 
countries have in common. This itself is an indication of the 
positive aspect. But the same cannot be said about Mr. 
Talbott's diplomatic mission to Islamabad. 
  In Islamabad, Mr. Talbott held intensive talks with the 
Pakistan prime minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, President Farooq 
Leghari, and other leaders. On the whole, the talks were held 
in business-like fashion although cordiality and nostalgic 
memories of an old strategic relationship marked the 
discussions. Three major areas were covered. The issue of 
nuclear disarmament in the South Asian regional context, 
Kashmir, and the U.S.-Pakistan bilateral framework on the 
question of inspections to ensure the capping of Islamabad's 
nuclear armament program. A noticeable degree of convergence of 
objectives came into focus in respect of the U.S. proposal for 
multilateral forum to discuss nonproliferation in South Asia. 
On the other two issues, though Pakistan appeared to have given 
a patient hearing, no appreciation and nod from the U.S. was 
available. On Kashmir, he reiterated the U.S. stand that India 
and Pakistan should resolve it in accordance with the Simla 
agreement. This indicates Pakistan's failure either to secure a 
recognition of the linkage between Kashmir issue and nuclear 
nonproliferation in South Asia or to elicit a view that Kashmir, 
more than nuclear proliferation, is a complicating factor in 
this region. Mr. Talbott also refused to budge on the issue of 
verifiable cap on Pakistan's nuclear program and maintained that 
discussions would continue between the U.S. and Pakistan.

<F P=106> [By Vijay Dutt] </F>
  [Text] New Delhi, March 28 -- Prime Minister P.V. 
Narasimha Rao's visit to the U.S. in early May, expected to make 
a significant breakthrough in the Indo-U.S. relations, is also 
likely to help in the projection of issues and problems of the 
south countries to the Clinton Administration, coming that his 
visit is soon after the G-15 summit in New Delhi. 
  A believer in a conciliatory rather than confrontationist 
attitude over international developmental issues, Mr. Rao, as 
the leading statesman from a major Third World country, will 
convey the conclusions at the G-15 meet to President Clinton, 
who has the primacy in G-7. It is expected that the two leaders 
would confer on the programmes of the developing countries and 
draw attention of the G-7 members for their coordination and 
collaboration on a global scale. Mr. Rao is likely to charter a 
closer working alliance between G-7 and G-15. 
  The date of the visit, tentatively fixed for May 6, will be 
firmed up when Mr. Strobe Talbott, number two in the State 
Department, comes to Delhi for discussions on April 6 and when 
India's Ambassador Siddharta Shankar Ray would also be present. 
  Mr. Talbott is presumed to come with a better understanding 
of India's stand on Kashmir, its views on the proposed supply of 
F-16s to Pakistan, the measures taken in regard to human rights 
and more crucially the depth of resentment in the country at the 
anti-India tilt in the statements of Ms. Robin Raphel in the 
last few months. He is also expected to dispel the impression 
that Ms. Raphel is, for President Clinton the primary 
policy-moderator on South Asia and has prejudiced him against 
India. 
  Ms. Raphel's visit, according to sources, was basically 
treated at official levels, as a prelude to Mr. Talbott's, when 
wide-ranging discussions would be held for firming up the agenda 
for Mr. Rao's visit. 
  Refuting the criticism that too much importance was given to 
a junior Ievel U.S. official and that Mr. S.B. Chavan and other 
senior officials bent backwards to appease Ms. Raphel, a 
spokesperson said that she was just given the opportunity to 
explain the nuances of her recent statements and posture. 
India's uneasiness at them was firmly conveyed to her and its 
impact reflected in her statement at the end of her stay here. 
  Ms. Raphel did attempt to erase the impression that her 
seemingly Pakistan bias determines America's South Asia policy. 
Mr. Talbott is also likely to bolster this further in an 
attempt to prepare positive atmosphere for Mr. Rao's Washington 
trip. 
  There is a guarded optimism on both sides regarding the 
visit. President Clinton, whose passion for domestic affairs 
borders on the frantic, is likely to strike a cordant note with 
Mr. Rao, who has been explicit in stressing that his economic 
policies are aimed at reaching the benefits of development to 
the underprivileged. 
  President Clinton too has been ambitious about his domestic 
agenda and been wary of letting his involvement with foreign 
affairs affect it. He has been, despite controversies arising 
over pursuing them, concentrating on health care programme and 
social security plans in an attempt to bring the poor into their 
ambit. 
  In his several meetings with foreign heads of state, 
President Clinton has shown greater keenness in discussing their 
development policies than international affairs. He and Mr. Rao 
are sure to find themselves on the same wave length when it 
comes to perceptions on social welfare. Their pursuit of 
development for the lowest layer of the social pyramid, hope 
officials, will be the basic meeting ground to build on the 
relations, presently under strain. 
  The Clinton Administration shaken by the Whitewater 
controversy and charged with nonchalance in matters relating to 
foreign relations, would be eager to notch a few positive 
conclusions from the visit. This will send the right signal to 
other Third World countries of Washington's serious approach for 
good ties and cooperation. 
  The Americans are aware that Mr. Rao's acceptance of their 
invitation is based on the sober assessment of the excellent 
economic relations, traditional ties in various fields and the 
fact that both countries share similar democratic values and 
respect each other's adherence to democracy. 
  Looking over all these positive factors, the view of those 
who felt that a certain coolness should be conveyed and the PM's 
visit kept on hold, was prevailed upon by those who firmly 
believed that the Prime Minister, especially after his extremely 
fruitful visit to the UK and India's diplomatic victory in 
Geneva, would surely succeed in projecting the status of Jammu 
and Kashmir and the steps taken for human rights to President 
Clinton, his senior officials and the intellectuals and 
opinion-makers whose views matter in Washington. 
  The extra-sensitive concern whicb the Clinton Administration 
is exhibiting over supposedly human rights violations is again 
based on the premise that it is legitimate for them to interfere 
in domestic human rights situation anywhere in the world. Be it 
Salvador or India, it considers itself perfectly justified in 
playing the role of a guardian of human rights. The U.S. 
Administration is woefully unaware of the steps taken in India 
for preserving human rights. 
  The move for the one time uplifting of the Pressler 
Amendment 
to enable the sale of F-16s to Pakistan is also a serious matter 
of concern to India. Senator Pressler, who is bitterly opposed 
to it, went public but the Administration is reportedly 
confident of persuading the Senate to permit the sale of 38 
(instead of the earlier plan for 71), which would double the 
number of F-16s Pakistan has presently. 
  All these aspects, which have become irritants in the 
bilateral relations and have caused apprehension about 
Washington's attitude towards India are expected to be thrashed 
out, even if they cannot be satisfactorily resolved immediately.

<F P=106> [Report by Antoine Constantine in Beirut] </F>
  [Text] Following the assassination of Talib al-Suhayl, an 
Iraqi Opposition figure residing in Beirut, reports in the 
Lebanese capital speak of a crisis in the Iraqi-Lebanese 
relations. Some went so far as to say that the Lebanese 
Government intends to close down the Iraqi Embassy and deport 
the Iraqi diplomats. 
  Pending the political results of the assassination, we 
review 
the security information connected with the murder. Al-Suhayl 
was killed in his house the day before yesterday. The 
investigation judge in Beirut issued arrest warrants against 
Khalid Khalaf, the commercial counsellor, and Muhammad Kazim, 
the cultural counsellor. Another arrest warrant was also issued 
against a third individual who reportedly participated in 
carrying out the murder and subsequently took refuge in the 
embassy. 
  After learning of the the involvement of two Iraqi diplomats 
in the operation, the security forces laid an invisible siege 
around the embassy and arrested Khalaf and Kazim and found 
weapons, pistols, and silencers in their possession. 
  'Awad Fakhri, the Iraqi charge d'affaires in Lebanon, who 
was 
summoned to the Foreign Ministry, said: The foreign minister 
informed me of the incident. We support the Lebanese 
authorities and we respect the Lebanese judiciary. 
  Fakhri denied that he had known that the dead man was an 
Iraqi national. 
  Talib al-Suhayl was one of the chiefs of the Iraqi shiite 
tribe of Tamim. He left Iraq after the 1958 revolution and 
sought refuge in Jordan and then in Saudi Arabia. This explains 
why he carries Jordanian and Saudi passports. His name was 
mentioned in a number of papers a few weeks ago as having been 
involved in an attempt to assassinate President Saddam Husayn. 
  The Foreign Ministry is considering ways to deal with this 
issue from the diplomatic viewpoint because the arrested 
diplomats enjoy diplomatic immunity. It has been learned that, 
as a precautionary measure, the Lebanese Embassy's charge 
d'affaires in Baghdad has been summoned to Beirut and has 
already left the Iraqi capital.

<F P=106> [Report by Hala Boncompagni] </F>
  [Text] Beirut, April 14 (AFP)--Lebanon has recalled its 
only diplomat in Baghdad and is considering lifting the immunity 
of two Iraqi envoys suspected of killing an Iraqi dissident 
here, a government official told AFP Thursday [14 April]. 
  The official who declined to be named also said Iraq's 
commercial attache Khalid Khalaf and cultural attache Muhammad 
Kazim allegedly told police that they gunned down Talib 
al-Suhayl [al-Tamimi] at his Beirut home on Baghdad's orders. 
  A third suspect in Tuesday's killing, an Iraqi embassy 
guard, 
was reported to be on the run. 
  Lebanon has summoned its acting charge d'affaires in Iraq, 
Sa'd Zakhiyah, to return to Beirut for consultations and he was 
expected to arrive later Thursday. 
  The official told AFP the cabinet approved on Wednesday a 
proposal by Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz to consider depriving 
the diplomats of their immunity from prosecution. 
  Iraqi Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf tried 
telephoning Buwayz on Wednesday but could not speak to him 
because his Lebanese counterpart was attending the weekly 
cabinet meeting, the official added. 
  Iraqi opposition groups denounced al-Suhayl's killing in 
statements to AFP. 
  Al-Suhayl, who was in his 70s, had lived in Beirut for 
several years and held both Jordanian and Saudi passports. 
  The outlawed al-Da'awah al-Islamiyah urged the Lebanese 
authorities to take all the necessary steps to punish the 
killers "particularly because we have information that the Iraqi 
intelligence services have plans to kill (other) dissidents in 
Lebanon and in other countries in the region." 
  The al-Da'awah also urged the Lebanese authorities to 
protect 
Iraqi dissidents living in Lebanon. 
  The London-based Free Iraqi Council opposition group said 
al-Suhayl was a distinguished opposition figure extremely active 
in trying to bring about change in Iraq." 
  He was involved with a group of senior Iraqi officers and 
officials from Tikrit and Mosul in a plot to topple Iraqi 
President Saddam Husayn, the group said. 
  It also charged that the US intelligence service CIA was 
implicated in al-Suhayl's assassination. 
  The CIA has turned down his request for help in plotting 
Saddam's downfall and probably betrayed him, the Free Iraqi 
Council said. 
  "The CIA must have passed on the information to Saddam 
Husayn 
who went on to assassinate hundreds of army officers and other 
figures in July 1993," it said. 
  According to officials al-Suhayl was killed Tuesday night by 
a man who knocked on his door pretending to be a delivery boy. 
When al-Suhayl appeared the killer pulled out a gun with a 
silencer and shot him dead. 
  Security forces staked out the Iraqi embassy in the northern 
suburbs at dawn and arrested two diplomats as they arrived. The 
Iraqis were carrying guns which may have been used in the 
killing. 
  Iraqi charge d'affaires 'Awwad Fakhri was summoned Wednesday 
to the Lebanese foreign ministry but he told reporters he was 
not aware of the facts.

  [Text] Beirut, April 13 (AFP)--A Muslim fundamentalist who 
said he had orders "to kill any Frenchman" was sentenced to a 
life term of hard labor Wednesday [13 April] for the 1986 murder 
of a French diplomat, the state-run news agency NNA [NATIONAL 
NEWS AGENCY] said. 
  The defendant, Hasan Muhammad Tulays, a corporal in the 
Lebanese army and member of Islamic Resistance, a paramilitary 
wing of the pro-Iranian group Hizballah, had confessed to the 
killing. 
  He testified that at the time of the shooting of Christian 
Gouttiere [name as received], the military attache at the French 
embassy, he had "received an order to kill any French person". 
  The military court that sentenced Tulays rejected his 
lawyer's appeal for amnesty, saying that to do so could damage 
relations between France and Lebanon. 
  Under a law passed in 1991, the death penalty in Lebanon was 
replaced by a sentence of life at hard labor. 
  An alleged accomplice of Tulays, Munzir Rammal, tried in 
absentia, got the same sentence. 
  Tulays was 26 at the time of the shooting. 
  Gouttiere, 54, was shot in the head three times in a 
Christian suburb of Beirut, near the French embassy.

  [Excerpts] Defense Minister Muhsin Dallul has denied that 
there are differences within the government, indicating that 
there are only various views, something that is natural and 
always results in a consensus. He said rumors on this are 
attempts to sow discord and undermine the government. He said 
he expected a Lebanese-Syrian summit soon. 
  Answering questions from Editors Association Doyen Milhim 
Karam, Minister Dallul explained that the investigation into the 
bombing of the Sayyidat al-Najat Church is being handled by the 
judiciary and is continuing. An indictment is expected soon. 
[passage omitted] 
  Regarding the issue of Gen. Michel 'Awn, Dallul said French 
officials have expressed their disappointment with his violation 
of the agreement that was sponsored by France. He added that 
the Lebanese Government has not demanded his extradition because 
Lebanon's problems are much more important than Michel 'Awn. 
Dallul said the amnesty law contains certain conditions to 
which Gen. 'Awn must adhere. If 'Awn continues to violate these 
conditions, the amnesty law will no longer apply to him.

  [Text] 'Allamah Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah has affirmed that 
the postponement of the pope's visit to Lebanon is related to 
divergent policies in the region. These policies are linked 
more to international factors than to internal Lebanese factors. 
He added that if the pope had come to this country, we would 
have welcomed him. We welcome all Lebanon's guests, more so the 
pope because he espouses the issue of coexistence. However, 
since he will not come, he knows better the justifications that 
have prompted him to postpone the visit. 
  Fadlallah said the situation in Lebanon requires it to be an 
oasis of freedom so that the region's problems can be aired in 
Lebanon. Freedom will survive but it might receive some 
scratches, depending on the political conditions outside Lebanon.

  [Text] Hizballah Deputy Secretary General Shaykh Na'im 
Qasim has stated that the Cabinet's decision banning radio and 
television networks from broadcasting news is unfair, reckless, 
and irrational. This decision does not respect the citizen's 
rights, Shaykh Qasim added. 
  Shaykh Qasim urged the officials to reverse their decision 
and to find the right path to overcome this crisis. He noted 
that the government must work out the proper legislation. 
  In a statement to AKHBAR AL-YAWM news agency, Shaykh Qasim 
said that Lebanon is a country of rights and it cannot live 
without them. We have cooperated with all parties so that peace 
will prevail and so the logic of one's word and truth will 
replace the language of arms, Shaykh Qasim said. 
  In his statement, the Hizballah official maintained that the 
pretexts used are absolutely invalid, because the country's 
security cannot be jeopardized by a word or a statement. 
Rather, security is threatened by the tools of destruction. He 
added: The officials must curb those who disturb the internal 
situation and do things harmful to the citizens' interests. But 
to stifle all voices under various pretexts is unacceptable and 
runs counter to the freedom of expression, which must be enjoyed 
by all Lebanese citizens. He pointed out that the unanimous 
denunciation by almost all factions is unequivocal evidence that 
the cabinet's step is wrong. 
  Shaykh Qasim continued that if this step is a prelude to 
more stringent steps, the government's monopolization of the 
radio and television media, or a prelude to restricting the 
freedom of the press it will have no positive results nor 
promote freedom and peace in this country. Therefore, no side 
can impose its opinions on others, not even the authorities 
backed by the law. This is because the laws and authority in 
Lebanon are committed to safeguarding the people's freedoms. 
  Shaykh Qasim said that the three-year delay in issuing the 
law on organizing the media is irrational. He noted that there 
are various whimsical attitudes to limiting the freedom of 
expression. 
  Asked whether the officials support freedom of expression in 
the country, Shaykh Qasim said that many people seek to impose 
the law of the jungle in which some people would dominate 
politically, economically, and militarily. These people also 
want to manipulate the freedoms to enable them gain control. 
  Asked whether the Hizballah deputies would heed his opinion 
and defend it in the Chamber of Deputies, Shaykh Qasim said: 
Certainly; because they are committed to defend the party and 
the people. He expressed readiness to coordinate with all the 
media.

  [Excerpt] Phalangist Party leader Dr. George Sa'adah has 
affirmed the need to speed up investigations and reveal the 
perpetrators of the two crimes at the Sayyidat al-Najat Church 
and the Phalangist Party headquarters. He pointed out that the 
battle over freedoms has started and will not end until positive 
results are achieved, which can only take place through the 
restoration of newscasts and political programs to the audio and 
visual media. 
  During the expanded Phalangist Party meeting that was held 
yesterday at party headquarters, Sa'adah said: During the 
al-Ta'if meetings, the issue of these varied and numerous media 
was presented. But the decision was made then to cancel all the 
militias, while there was no mention of canceling the media, but 
of reorganizing it. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary from the "Palestine Broadcast"] </F>
  [Text] After the 'Afula and Ashdod operations almost 10 
days ago, which left dozens of Zionist settlers and troops dead 
and injured, today comes the Hadera operation, in the heart of 
1948-occupied Palestine near Tel Aviv. This reasserts the 
failure of the military siege -- imposed indefinitely by the 
occupation authorities on the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip 
-- to provide security and safety for Israelis. 
  Today, an explosive charge went off in an Israeli bus in 
Hadera near Tel Aviv. An Israeli military spokesman has 
admitted that five Israeli settlers were killed and 25 others 
were injured in the explosion. Israeli enemy radio reported 
that large police and Army forces rushed to the scene and 
started a broad combing operation in a search for the intifadah 
youths. The occupation forces have set up heavy roadblocks in 
the area and tightened suppressive measures. 
  The operation coincides with Israel's celebration of its 
proclamation on the land of Arab Palestine. It also coincides 
with the deadline set to implement the Oslo accord that 
stipulates Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho. 
  This operation, which came in the wake of the 'Afula, Ashdod 
and other operations, reaffirms the determination of our 
Palestinian Arab people to pursue their intifadah and operations 
all over the occupied homeland in the West Bank and Gaza Strip 
in 1948-occupied Palestine. This operation also reaffirms our 
people's determination to deprive the Zionist invaders of 
security and safety, wherever they are, all over occupied 
Palestine. This as long as our Palestinian Arab people are 
being subjected to oppression, terrorism, killing, and 
annihilation at the hands of the Zionist settlers and soldiers, 
and as long as Israel does not recognize the national rights of 
our people and does not withdraw from the occupied Arab 
territories.

  [Excerpts] His Excellency President Hafiz al-Asad yesterday 
received Turkish Interior Minister Nahit Mentese and his 
accompanying delegation. The meeting was attended by Interior 
Minister Dr. Muhammad Harbah and the Turkish ambassador in 
Damascus. [passage omitted] 
  Official talks between the Syrian Arab side headed by 
Interior Minister Dr. Muhammad Harbah and the Turkish side 
headed by Turkish Interior Minister Nahit Mentese were concluded 
at the Ministry of Interior yesterday afternoon in the presence 
of members of both delegations and the Turkish ambassador in 
Damascus. 
  Dr. Harbah delivered a speech, saying that Turkish Interior 
Minister Nahit Mentese asserted during the talks that Turkey 
recognizes that Syria and Iraq have rights to the Euphrates 
waters. He explained to Mentese and the delegation accompanying 
him Syria's views on the issue. He said that it is in nobody's 
interest to delay an agreement on water sharing among Turkey, 
Syria, and Iraq so that future generations may not be left with 
a disconcerting problem, and so that Syria and Turkey may launch 
joint projects in the areas of water, electricity, and other 
economic areas, something which might have a positive effect on 
the two neighborly and friendly countries and states. 
  Then, Turkish Interior Minister Mentese delivered a speech, 
saying: In all frankness, I would like to reiterate that there 
is no cause for concern regarding views that have been expressed 
in this regard. Today, I have been honored by the three-hour 
meeting I held with His Excellency President Hafiz al-Asad. I 
have gained experience from his excellent ideas. I am fully 
confident that bilateral contacts will shortly be held at the 
highest levels to achieve the best possible results in the 
fields of security, economy, and trade. 
  Mentese added: I would like to reiterate again that the 
bilateral economic, cultural, and social ties have begun to show 
signs of success; and this is in the interest of the two 
countries and peoples. We will make adequate efforts to 
implement the projects previously agreed on. 
  Mentese went on to say: Dr. Muhammad Harbah announced that 
Syria is eager to safeguard Turkey's security and stability just 
as it is eager to safeguard its own security and stability. 
Moreover, our views are identical on how the drug combating 
agreement signed by the two countries in 1966 can be promoted to 
render it one that meets the requirements of today's world. 
  At the end of the talks, a press statement was issued, 
explaining that the bilateral talks were permeated by a climate 
of amity and cordiality. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Official talks between the Syrian side led by 
Interior Minister Muhammad Harbah and the Turkish side led by 
Interior Minister Nahit Mentese concluded at the Interior 
Ministry this afternoon in the presence of members of both 
delegations and the Turkish ambassador in Damascus. 
  At the end of talks, the two sides signed joint minutes of 
the meetings. The minutes provide for the exchange of periodic 
visits, cooperation in the security field and in fighting crime 
and drugs. They also provide for enhancing bilateral relations 
and bolstering bilateral cooperation as part of the agreements 
signed between the two countries, as well as maintaining good 
neighborliness. 
  Harbah and Mentese exchanged cordial speeches in which they 
expressed pleasure for the achievements they reached on the path 
of joint action in an atmosphere dominated by a spirit of 
friendship and care for the interest of both neighborly 
countries. This care stems from deep-rooted historic constants, 
and has been enhanced by both the care and directives of the 
political leaderships in Syria and Turkey. 
  Mentese voiced pleasure for having been received by 
President 
Hafiz al-Asad. He said: I gained experience from his 
excellency's brilliant ideas. Mentese expressed confidence that 
bilateral meetings will continue at the highest levels in order 
to promote bilateral relations in various fields. 
  Both ministers expressed satisfaction with the ongoing 
bilateral cooperation in the security and political fields, and 
stressed their eagerness to continue the efforts in order to 
achieve the objective. Harbah presented the Interior Ministry's 
shield to Mentese as a gift in expression of the spirit of amity 
and friendship. 
  At the end of talks, the following press statement was 
issued: 
  At the invitation of Syrian Interior Minister Dr. Muhammad 
Harbah, Turkish Interior Minister Nahit Mentese paid an official 
visit to Syria 11-13 April 1994, leading a senior official 
delegation as part of the security cooperation protocol signed 
between the two countries in 1987. 
  Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad received the guest interior 
minister on the morning of 13 April 1994 in the presence of 
Interior Minister Dr. Muhammad Harbah and the Turkish ambassador 
in Damascus. Vice President 'Abd-al-Halim Khaddam also received 
the Turkish interior minister and the accompanying delegation. 
  During the visit, several meetings were held between the 
Syrian and Turkish sides. An atmosphere of amity and friendship 
dominated the meetings in which all topics on agenda were 
reviewed. The Security Committee continued to discuss recent 
developments which will bolster understanding and promote 
relations in a way that serves the interest of both neighborly 
and friendly countries. 
  The two sides agreed to continue holding periodic meetings, 
and set May as a date to convene the Security Committee in 
Ankara. They stressed their eagerness to promote bilateral 
relations in a way that achieves security and stability and 
serves their common interests. 
  The two sides also agreed to promote bilateral cooperation 
in 
the field of fighting both crime and drugs. The [Turkish] 
delegation visited some ancient sites and touristic landmarks in 
Damascus. The Turkish interior minister invited Syrian Interior 
Minister Dr. Muhammad Harbah to visit Turkey leading an official 
delegation as part of the exchange of visits between the two 
ministers. Minister Harbah thankfully accepted the invitation 
whose date will be set later. 
  Mentese and the accompanying delegation left Damascus this 
evening following a three-day visit to Syria. During the visit, 
he met with President Hafiz al-Asad, and held talks with the 
Syrian interior minister. He was seen off at Damascus 
International Airport by Interior Minister Dr. Muhammad Harbah, 
the minister's assistants, senior Interior Ministry officers, 
the Turkish ambassador in Damascus, and the Turkish Embassy 
staff.

<F P=106> [Report by Sana' al-Imam from Damascus] </F>
  [Text] Well-informed Syrian sources told Radio Monte Carlo 
that the talks by the Turkish delegation ked by Interior 
Minister Nahit Mentese that ended in Damascus yesterday were 
successful. 
  According to the sources, Damascus has emphasized to the 
Turkish minister that Kurdish Workers Party [PKK] activities are 
banned in Syria where it cannot operate in public or in secret. 
Damascus also stressed that they have no training camps in 
Syria. 
  When the Turkish delegation referred to the possibility of 
the PKK's having training camps in Lebanon, the Syrian officials 
replied by saying Syria has exerted great efforts in cooperation 
with the Lebanese authorities to close the camp the Kurds had 
been using in Lebanon, and that the Syrian presence in Lebanon 
is to support and bolster the pillars of Lebanese legitimacy and 
attain security and stability there. 
  The Turkish side proposed coordination among Syria, Lebanon, 
and Turkey in the form of periodic meetings to discuss security 
affairs. The sources cited Syrian Interior Minister Muhammad 
Harbah as saying that Syria or any neighbor country has no 
interest in having sectarian activities in the region. The 
Syrian Government told the Turkish delegation it is worried 
about the infiltration of large numbers of Kurds into Syria as a 
result of Turkish military pressures, pointing out that the 
problem lies in the fact that the Syrian-Turkish borders are 
long and cannot be easily controlled. The sources added that 
Syria had reaffirmed to the Turkish side its categorical 
rejection of any form of terrorism. The two sides proposed 
expediting the study of an agreement on combating drugs. The 
sources said that the Turkish side praised the Syrian efforts in 
this respect.

<F P=106> [Press review] </F>
  [Text] Under the headline "Who Is To Blame For The 
Disappointment?" the newspaper AL-BA'TH says: Any careful 
examination of the peace process since its inception makes it 
clear that the peace process is virtually stalemated. This 
gives rise to questions on who is to blame for this 
disappointment over a process on which great hopes were pinned, 
and for which enormous and matchless international efforts were 
mobilized. The paper replies, saying that the Israeli rulers 
are to blame for the current stalemate in the peace talks. For 
the Israeli rulers have always been opposed to the peace process 
since its inception. They have always sought to render it void 
of any meaningful content during all stages of the negotiations. 
  The paper also holds the United States, the major cosponsor 
of the peace process, responsible for this stalemate in the 
talks, particularly since the United States has undertaken to 
perform the role of full partner. The paper adds that this 
partner has failed to use its influence and means of persuasion 
with the Israeli rulers. Neither has it defended the terms of 
reference agreed upon for the peace process. 
  The paper disapproves of the U.S. position that the solution 
should not be imposed on the negotiators, as if adherence to 
international legitimacy and its resolutions and the terms of 
reference agreed on for the peace process were tantamount to an 
imposition of a solution. The paper notes that the party that 
is not complying with international legitimacy is the one that 
seeks to impose its views, conditions, and wishes on all 
parties, including the international community. 
  The paper asserts that peace cannot be achieved in cellars, 
nor can it be achieved by noncompliance with international 
legitimacy and its resolutions. The peace process cannot make 
headway away from the agreed terms of reference. 
  The paper believes that those who are conspiring against the 
peace process by dragging one another to alleged agreements 
cannot inspire trust and promote confidence in their good 
intentions. These parties cannot respect their undertakings, 
pledges, and deadlines, which they daily describe as not sacred. 
For the only thing that is sacred to them is the perpetuation 
of the occupation and the usurpation of rights. 
  The paper adds: Given all this, Israel is to blame for the 
disappointment over the peace process, the disappointment that 
could destroy and kill the current opportunity for peace. For, 
the Arabs, headed by Syria, have demonstrated an unwavering 
commitment to just and comprehensive peace. 
  The paper concludes by saying: The tactics of maneuvering 
aimed to exhaust adversaries are doomed to failure, for there is 
no room for accepting Israeli dictates once the other sides are 
exhausted; that is, on the basis of consecrating the premise of 
negotiating from a position of superiority and arrogance. This 
game is exposed, and will always remain unacceptable. 
  Under the headline "Who Is To Blame?" the newspaper 
AL-THAWRAH says: Israel has managed to dilute all the momentum 
created during the various phases of the peace process, 
particularly after Syria submitted its well-known working paper 
to the Israeli negotiators, and made it clear, through 
diplomatic channels, in the bilateral talks, and via all 
possible media and political means, that its practical concept 
of peace is based on the principle of trading land for peace. A 
subscription by Israel to this concept must result in complete 
Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories, including 
the occupied Golan Heights and southern Lebanon, and also in a 
recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian Arab 
people. 
  AL-THAWRAH goes on to say: The entire world community has 
welcomed the outcome of the Geneva summit between Presidents 
al-Asad and Clinton, and deemed it a breakthrough toward the 
achievement of just and comprehensive in the region. But, since 
then, Israel has done its utmost, using all possible means of 
pressure, misrepresentation of facts, and blackmail on the U.S. 
scene, to neutralize the outcome of the Geneva summit so as to 
preclude the attainment by the United States of a broad-minded 
and proper understanding of the regional conflict. This 
endeavor on Israel's part was also meant to enable Israel to set 
loose from the United States' commitment to activate its role as 
an honest partner in the peace talks. This is because Israel 
does not want to comply with international legitimacy, and to 
meet the requirements of peace. 
  The paper says: Regrettably, the Israeli efforts on the U.S. 
scene have borne fruit. They have managed to portray the U.S. 
Administration in a way that is different from what it was in 
the immediate aftermath of the Geneva summit. For, truths have 
begun to disappear, leaving room for Israeli deception and 
Israeli propaganda to manage the U.S. foreign policy with regard 
to the Middle East and peace efforts. Perhaps, this is the most 
serious impasse that has faced the peace process. 
  The paper adds: The Arabs, who have demonstrated their good 
faith toward the cause of just and comprehensive peace, counted 
on a vigorous and active U.S. role to ensure compliance with the 
terms of reference agreed on for the peace process and the 
Madrid conference per the U.S. commitments President Clinton 
reiterated in Geneva. But, for now, the Arabs are shocked by the 
U.S. submission to the Israeli argument in contravention of all 
pledges and commitments. 
  AL-THAWRAH concludes by saying: Unless the U.S. position is 
freed of the Israeli attempts at containment, and unless 
Washington acts in line with its international commitments and 
responsibilities, all efforts will end in failure. For current 
indications do not auger well for the future if Israel fails to 
withdraw its troops from the Arab territories, and if just and 
comprehensive peace remains elusive.

  [Text] On the eve of the 20 April visit to the United 
States by His Royal Highness Prince Hasan, AL-BILAD has learned 
from reliable sources in Washington that the U.S. Administration 
is taking Jordanian threats to boycott the talks seriously. 
AL-BILAD has learned that the United States will agree, during 
their meeting with Prince Hasan, to the inspection of 
al-'Aqabah-bound ships inside the port by Lloyds, not the U.S. 
Navy. AL-BILAD has also learned that the resumption of the 
[Arab-Israeli] talks and the expansion of participation in the 
multilateral talks will be raised by the United States during 
the talks. 
  Meanwhile, Jordanian officials say that holding the talks 
the 
way the Israelis want is rejected by the Jordanians, because 
this is intended to bypass the agenda in order to postpone 
priority issues. Furthermore, the Israeli request to sign a 
peace treaty with Jordan before discussing substantial issues, 
such as borders, refugees, and water, is considered impossible 
by the Jordanian leadership. This, consequently, will not make 
Prince Hasan's U.S. visit at all easy.

  [Text] Sources at the Jordanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
have revealed that Jordan is coming under U.S. pressure to take 
part in the multilateral negotiations, two committees of which 
will meet in Muscat on 17 April and Doha later this month. 
  The sources added: The Jordanian position announced by His 
Majesty King Husayn has made Jordan's continued engagement in 
the peace talks contingent upon easing or ending the al-'Aqabah 
blockade. His majesty the king also said that the Jordanian 
participation in the talks will be token pending a resolution of 
this issue. Consequently, Jordan will send observers to the 
talks. 
  AKHBAR AL-USBU' also learned that Jordan has definitely 
decided not to participate in the meetings of the working group 
on water sharing, which will begin in Muscat on 17 April. The 
sources added that the Jordanian participation in the talks will 
be actual, rather than token if the U.S. position improves 
before the convening of the Muscat meetings, and if Jordan 
realizes that measures will actually be taken to end or ease the 
blockade. 
  Moreover, AKHBAR AL-USBU' also learned that Jordan's 
position 
toward participation in the Doha meetings of the working group 
on arms control due to convene on 24 April is the same as its 
position toward participation in the Muscat meetings, and that 
Jordan is making its continued actual participation in the peace 
process meetings contingent upon a solution to the problem of 
the blockade enforced against the Gulf of Aqaba.

  [Text] Amman--AL-RA'Y--Competent security authorities have 
managed to apprehend 10 persons on charges of setting up an 
"Islamic" organization in order to carry out terrorist acts 
inside the Kingdom. 
  Security sources explained that the group, led by a 38-year 
person, met in an Amman neighborhood. It had prepared a phased 
plan to execute its operations. 
  Under the first phase of its plan, the sources indicated, 
the 
group would do anything to collect money. Therefore, it carried 
out armed robberies against a number of shops and taxi drivers 
in the capital. 
  The sources added that the second phase was aimed at 
carrying 
out robberies against some commercial banks in Amman. The group 
kept a special record of banks against which armed robberies had 
been planned. 
  The sources explained that during the third phase they would 
use the stolen money to purchase weapons. The sources explained 
that the robberies were still in their initial stages, during 
which light weapons were used and tear gas was used against taxi 
drivers. 
  The sources said the first phase of the operation was 
successful. Members of the group managed to attack some taxi 
drives and to burglarize some shops. However, having monitored 
their movements, the security authorities arrested the thieves 
and uncovered other members of the organization and their 
objectives. 
  The sources stressed that members of the armed group have 
been placed under intensive interrogation. They will be 
referred to specialized courts. Public trials will be held to 
acquaint the public with the robberies that had been carried out.

<F P=106> ["Political Analysis" column by Mazin Hammad: "Two Out of </F>
Five"] 
  [Text] It is unprecedented for an Israeli official like 
Yitzhaq Rabin to clearly state that there is no future for the 
settlements in the occupied territories. Here he is promising 
to remove the settlements within the framework of a final 
settlement. He would not have said this if it was not for the 
collapse of security Israel has been facing since the 
al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre on 25 February. That massacre 
opened the doors of revenge in Palestine like never before. 
With bloody evidence, the massacre proved the impossibility of 
coexistence between Arabs and Jews on one territory. Rabin is 
fully aware of this result, which was in his mind when he told 
the settlers yesterday that eventually they will have to leave. 
  The martyrdom operation in Hadera shook the faith of the 
settlers in the possibility of staying in the West Bank and Gaza 
and increased their motivation to pack their belongings and 
dismantle their settlements. The timing of this operation was 
well studied just like the timing of the 'Afula operation which 
was carried out by Hamas a week ago, killing 13 Israelis and 
wounding scores more. 
  The first operation marked 40 days since the martyrs of 
Hebron. The second was carried out on Israeli Army day. It is 
noteworthy that Hamas had previously vowed to carry out five 
operations. This means that there are three operations on the 
way. 
  Such operations not only remove the Israelis' sense of 
security, but also reveal the impossibility of controlling a 
decision by a movement such as Hamas to achieve martyrdom. 
Moreover, as Rabin and Peres said yesterday, it is impossible 
to seal the occupied territories when everyday, 10,000 cars come 
from the West bank and Gaza to Palestine of 1948. 
  However, the more important question posed by the 'Afula and 
Hadera operations is whether Israel has learned its lesson and 
is now ready to achieve serious progress in the bilateral 
negotiations with the Palestinians and other Arab parties. It 
is totally clear that the Ibrahami Mosque massacre and the 
aforementioned operations would not have occurred if Israel had 
committed itself to starting withdrawal from "Gaza and Jericho 
First" on 13 December as scheduled and completing this 
withdrawal on 13 April; that is, yesterday. 
  Will 1.7 million Palestinians remain the prisoners of a few 
thousand settlers, or must there be more martyrdom operations 
before Israel sees the road in front of it?!

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" AL-BILAD report] </F>
  [Text] Contrary to all the press reports indicating the 
failure of Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat's visit to Amman 
last week, AL-BILAD sources stress that the opposite took place. 
  These reliable sources asserted that the understanding shown 
at the Jordanian-Palestinian summit reaffirmed that bilateral 
relations are strong and that the option chosen by the Jordanian 
and Palestinian sides is correct. This summit also revived the 
coordination issue in a stronger and wider manner which, at the 
end of the talks, resulted in crystallizing the work of the four 
joint bilateral committees, the Jerusalem, refugee, economic, 
and administrative committees. The work of these committees is 
related to the transfer of authority and powers to the 
Palestinian authority's institutions on the territory from which 
the Israelis will withdraw. 
  King Husayn received Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] with 
fraternal warmth reflecting Jordan's decision to stand firmly 
alongside the PLO and its options for several reasons, according 
to King Husayn. 
  King Husayn also said: We share the same fate, suffering, 
and aspirations. We are looking forward to the success of your 
endeavors, exactly like you are doing. The triumph of the 
Palestinian position and the removal of occupation are a 
strength for Jordan and a protection for its internal security. 
The more stable the region, whose basis is Palestine, the more 
stable our internal situation." 
  Continuing to address his Palestinian guest, King Husayn 
said: We also share looking forward to Jerusalem. This is 
because our loss of Jerusalem is a loss of future visions and a 
pain felt in our heart. Thus, we share with you looking forward 
to achieving a victorious return for you and ourselves for the 
sake of Jerusalem. 
  Therefore, brother Abu-'Ammar, let no information be borne 
in 
your mind that may point to the opposite of what I am saying. 
This is because tendentious parties are trying to infiltrate 
into the sources of our information in order to instill doubts 
and suspicion between us. In view of facts, developments, and 
the current balance of powers, the source of our strength lies 
in mutual understanding between us. 
  The other party still tries to undermine our belief in what 
we feel is just and correct. This is taking place through two 
known ways: Pressures and temptations. Pressures are declared 
and tangible, and God is helping us endure them, while 
temptations have effects which are no less important than those 
of pressures in terms of canceling debts, extending aid, and 
other temptations. The demand is clear, and is represented by 
two headlines, namely, a peace treaty with Israel before Israel 
pays the requisites of peace to the Arab side, particularly the 
Palestinian side; and changing the agenda signed in Washington 
by addressing the easier issues before the more difficult ones. 
They [the Israelis] want to reach an understanding on 
environmental, trade, and other issues before reaching an 
agreement on substantive issues such as the territories, 
borders, water, and refugees. Therefore, we still reject this. 
  In his remarks, which were made in the presence of the 
members of the Jordanian and Palestinian delegations, King 
Husayn continued: You reached the Oslo agreement without our 
knowledge. The same can be said of the Cairo agreement, the 
Security Council resolution [No. 904], and other developments. 
However, despite our reservations, we supported you in the Oslo, 
Washington, and Cairo agreements, as well as Resolution 904. 
Our sole objective in all that is to spare you any problems, 
show that the Arab front is unified, and to support the 
Palestinian interpretation of the agreements. Therefore, it is 
preferable if there is prior understanding, coordination, and 
consultation. 
  He added: We understand that coordination, understanding, 
and consultation should take place before agreements are reached 
with the other side. Our institutions, archives, and expertise 
are at your disposal, so you can attain the best results. We 
seek coordination, understanding, and consultation so you will 
hear our point of view, but not necessarily adopt it. If our 
point of view proves sound and you adopt it, this is good; if 
not, no harm will be done, God willing. 
  King Husayn said: Regarding the media, I have heard that you 
are upset. So are we, but we cannot abandon our democratic 
option. It is part of our domestic security. It protects us. 
Therefore, we should be patient and accept the price. See if 
brother Abu-Samir [Jordanian Prime Minister 'Abd-al-salam 
al-Majali] can do something about the media, with which I 
personally expressed dissatisfaction. 
  I am looking forward to the creation of joint committees or 
the activation of the existing ones in the hope that they 
specify the mechanism for dealing with joint responsibilities 
and daily affairs. 
  With his known frankness, King Husayn told the Palestinian 
president and delegation: We receive worrisome reports about 
you and your fears. But rest assured, we pay no attention to 
such reports. It is in our joint interest not to let doubts 
creep into our souls. I have informed the Syrian and other 
brothers that we have no interest in weakening the PLO. Rather, 
it is in our interest to support and strengthen the PLO. 
Weakening it will impose on us an unbearable responsibility. 
The Palestinian people and their representatives should choose 
the way that will safeguard the Palestinian people's rights, 
interests, and aspirations. 
  Concluding his remarks to President 'Arafat, king Husayn 
said: Brother Abu-'Ammar, we appreciate your efforts and 
sacrifices. May God support you. It is God who grants success. 
  A senior Palestinian official who took part in the meeting 
said the Husayn-'Arafat meeting reflected hope and aspiration 
for a better future for the coming generations. He said: 
Abu-'Ammar emerged from the meeting more confident about what 
should be done. The official stressed that the 
Jordanian-Palestinian summit meeting will be reflected 
positively on the joint committees' performance, and that its 
positive results will appear soon.

<F P=106> [Report by Christian Hoffmann: "Husayn Warns Against Middle </F>
East Disaster"] 
  [Text] Jordanian King Husayn has warned against a disaster 
in the Middle East peace process. On the occasion of a joint 
news conference with Austrian President Thomas Klestil, the 
Jordanian ruler deplored that the peace talks are stagnating. 
  President Klestil, who is paying a three-day official visit 
to Jordan, affirmed again to his hosts that Austria is prepared 
to develop its economic aid to this region, as soon as the 
situation has stabilized. Klestil, who will travel to Israel as 
early as this summer, offered Austria's mediation. Since the 
complete normalization of relations with Jerusalem, Austria's 
opportunities on the diplomatic level have increased. Klestil's 
visit will be the first of an Austrian head of state. 
  Moreover, in his speech at the state banquet in the Basman 
Palace, the president announced that a conference for 
communication between representatives of Christianity, Islam, 
and Judaism will be held in Vienna in December. He pointed out 
that about 250,000 Muslims are currently living in Austria, 
among them are about 70,000 refugees from Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  On Tuesday, the second day of his visit, the president 
traveled to Um Qais in the Jordan Valley. Before that, he had 
laid wreaths at the tombs of King 'Abdallah and King Talal. 
Afterward, a reception for the Austrian colony in Jordan was on 
the agenda. Today, Wednesday, is devoted to a visit to the 
archaeological finds in Petra. Afterward, the president will 
return to Vienna. 
  In the next few days, Austria will present four ambulance 
cars, three water tanks, and two emergency aid vehicles to the 
Jordanian Civil Defense Authority. An additional delivery of 
six fire trucks will conclude a relief program that continued 
the help for the states affected by the Gulf war in 1993 and as 
part of which goods valued at 100 million schillings have been 
supplied. Moreover, Austria will reorganize the school of hotel 
management in Amman. In addition, Austrian companies are active 
in the fields of telecommunications and water economy.

  [Text] Amman (Star)--Dignitaries from across the Muslim 
world are gathering in Amman for a ceremony on Monday [18 April] 
to mark completion of restoration work on one of Islam's holiest 
sites. 
  Jerusalem's Dome of the Rock has received a new veneer of 
gold as part of a two-year renovation project. His Majesty King 
Husayn paid $8.25 million for the restoration. 
  The official opening ceremony is scheduled to take place at 
al-Madinah al-Riyadiyah (Sports City) sport center in Amman at 
11 am [0800 GMT]. 
  After a speech from His Majesty, the covering of the shrine 
will be removed and the Dome of the Rock will be officially 
reopened. Due to the Israeli occupation of the West Bank, none 
of the attendants will actually see the Dome of the Rock first 
hand. Instead, Jordan TV will transmit the unveiling via 
satellite from Jerusalem in the first ever live broadcast from 
the Occupied Territories. Jordan Radio will also cover the 
unveiling.

Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid has revealed the organization's 
readiness to bolster and support Jordan's stance on lifting the 
international boycott on the Port of al-'Aqabah. This boycott 
is threatening the Jordanian economy. However, he added that 
the Arab League has so far not received a request from Jordan on 
this issue. 
  In a statement he made today, 'Abd-al-Majid asked the 
Security Council and the United States to review this stance, 
which is affecting Jordan's economy, to achieve peace and 
stability in the region.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Yamani: Iraq Returns to Oil Market </F>
Next Year"] 
  [Text] London, AL-QUDS AL-'ARABI -- Former Saudi Oil 
Minister Shaykh Ahmad Zaki Yamani told an oil conference in 
London yesterday that there are indications that a number of 
Security Council members have become more agreeable to Iraq's 
returning to the world oil market, and that it can be assumed 
that this will happen in the middle of next year. 
  In his opening speech to the fourth conference of the World 
Energy Studies Center, which he heads, Yamani said that Iraq's 
resumption of oil exports would put OPEC members under great 
pressure unless they work to offer it a suitable quota of the 
organization's output. He added that the oil price would in 
this case fall to $10 a barrel and remain at this level during 
1996. 
  Yamani pointed out that the official U.S. position on Iraq's 
resuming its oil exports continues to make it conditional on 
Iraq's compliance with all UN resolutions concerning Iraq, but 
this position is not now as clear as it used to be.

to change the format of the Syrian-Israeli negotiations. An 
official Syrian spokesman has said that secret talks and 
separate agreements will weaken the Arabs and allow Israel to 
force its terms on them. 
  The Syrian spokesman further said that the agreement Israel 
signed with the PLO did not lead to peace. Rather, it 
complicated the situation and increased the agony of the Arabs 
in the territories.

  [Text] Cairo, 13 Apr (MENA)--Zuhdi al-Qidrah, alternate 
Palestinian ambassador and representative of the Fatah Movement 
in Cairo, has stated that the PLO will not sign a final 
agreement with Israel before an implementable solution regarding 
the geographical jurisdiction is reached. 
  In a statement made today, al-Qidrah said that although an 
agreement was reached during the recent Palestinian-Israeli 
negotiations concerning the establishment of the Palestinian 
police and its number, weapons, and deployment areas, it would 
be difficult to sign a final agreement without resolving certain 
problems. 
  Al-Qidrah expressed the hope that the next round of 
negotiations between the two delegations next week will be 
decisive and achieve the desired positive results. 
  He called on Israel to demonstrate its seriousness and 
credibility by quickly implementing its commitments under the 
Oslo and Cairo agreements, noting that the Palestinian 
delegation is abiding by Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat's 
instructions to work for the establishment of a just peace to 
ensure the life and future of the peoples in the area. 
  Al-Qidrah affirmed the importance of the Egyptian role under 
the leadership of President Husni Mubarak and Foreign Minister 
'Amr Musa in tackling the causes of any possible collapse in the 
talks from time to time. 
  Al-Qidrah called for reviving bilateral Arab coordination 
among the five Arab parties taking part in the negotiations with 
Israel in accordance with the Arab League Council's decision.

<F P=106> [Report by Aluf Ben] </F>
  [Excerpt] Israel promised the PLO about two weeks ago, 
around the time that the agreement on security arrangements for 
Hebron was reached, that implementation of the Gaza and Jericho 
withdrawal "will be cut from four months, as decided in the 
Declaration of Principles [DOP], to three weeks." The 
withdrawal from the Gaza Strip will be carried out from south to 
north because the Palestinian police force will enter the 
territory from Egypt through the Rafah border crossing. Jericho 
will be evacuated almost at the same time as the evacuation of 
the southern part of the strip. 
  Discussion on the security situation in the sea and the air 
began in Cairo this week. The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] 
dispatched Air Force and Navy experts to the talks. As had 
previously occurred in the talks with the PLO, substantive 
differences quickly surfaced. 
  A dispute arose over territorial waters. Israel announced 
that the width of the Gaza Strip's territorial waters is three 
nautical miles, the area which will fall under the 
responsibility of the Palestinian entity. The PLO 
representatives rejected the suggestion and demanded a 20-mile 
zone. They explained that the IDF currently permits Gazan 
fisherman to go out some 20 miles from the coastline and 
demanded full sovereignty over that area. 
  When the Israelis explained that determining territorial 
waters requires international approval and that the Gaza Strip's 
territorial waters have always been fixed at three miles, the 
Palestinians suggested signing a joint document expanding the 
area to 20 miles "and sending it to all the countries of the 
world." 
  The Palestinians agreed to the Israeli demand that all 
flights in the area of the autonomy be coordinated with Israel's 
air control, but they insisted on setting up a Palestinian 
national airline, and even promised that so as not to impinge on 
Israel's overall responsibility for the area, their airline 
would only fly "to countries which maintain relations with 
Israel." 
  The Israelis were surprised by the suggestion. Why a 
national airline, they asked the PLO representatives since Gaza 
and Jericho will have only two small landing strips? Israel is 
opposed to the setting up of an airline, which would require 
signing international accords, which violates the autonomy's 
general ban on maintaining foreign relations. The Israeli offer 
was much less generous: The Palestinians can carry out internal 
flights from landing strips in Gaza and Jericho, and in special 
cases, PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat will be permitted to land 
there by plane or helicopter from his travels around the world. 
  Further progress was achieved this week on the clause which 
imposes restrictions on Palestinian building and activity near 
traffic axes used by the IDF in the Gaza Strip. At the same 
time, the PLO did not withdraw its opposition to Israel's 
regional map on settlements and security in the Gaza Strip, 
appended to the Cairo agreement. 
  The PLO this week dispatched representatives to the judicial 
committee whose task is to work out the appendix discussing 
criminal and civilian judicial powers and cooperation between 
the judicial authorities in Israel and the autonomy. In the 
previous round, the Palestinians failed in their efforts to 
recruit lawyers, and five Israeli lawyers conducted the 
negotiations with Nabil Sha'th, head of the PLO delegation to 
the Cairo talks, who appointed himself to the judicial committee 
although he is not an attorney. 
  This time, a Palestinian law professor from London and 
another attorney from the territories came to the talks. They 
sat with Sha'th for discussions with the Israeli judicial team 
headed by Colonel Ahaz Ben-Ari of the military advocate 
general's office. 
  The Palestinian professor received the Israelis with an 
announcement that he firmly opposes the Oslo agreement and 
called for reopening discussions on issues on which agreement 
had already been reached and signed in the DOP. Why should 
Israel enjoy jurisdiction over Israelis and settlements, the 
professor asked. 
  At a new conference to sum up the talks, Sha'th said that 
"problems remain," and gave as an example the judicial powers. 
  The civilian committee, which discusses the transfer of 
Civil 
Administration powers to the Palestinians, has begun to discuss 
the toughest clause: Transferring water powers in Gaza and 
Jericho to the PLO. Noah Kinarti, the defense minister's 
settlement adviser, who is in charge of negotiations on water 
issues in the bilateral peace talks, attended the Cairo talks. 
Progress was made in the water talks, but no agreement has yet 
been reached. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report on news conference with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin </F>
by political correspondent Udi Segal "held in Jerusalem a short 
while ago" -- live] 
  [Text] The prime minister seemed very disturbed by the 
Hadera terror attack. He spent several hours of interviews with 
the various media summoned on Independence Day, and the report 
on the attack came in the middle of them, in the middle of 
Memorial Day. Prime Minister Rabin said that this was yet 
another attack by fanatics trying to sabotage the peace process. 
We, however, will stay the course and continue implementing the 
peace process, thus foiling their intentions to harm it. 
  Rabin spoke about the announcement by Hamas [Islamic 
Resistance Movement], stating that after the Hebron massacre and 
again today Hamas announced it will carry out five harsh 
retaliatory attacks inside Israel's territory to revenge the 
massacre. According to Hamas, it has carried out two of those 
attacks: the grave attack last week in 'Afula and today's 
serious attack in Hadera. Prime Minister Rabin said Hamas and 
the Islamic Jihad decided to focus on their activity inside the 
Green Line boundaries with a political aim of diverting Israeli 
public opinion against the peace process. 
  [Begin Rabin recording] I am primarily responsible for the 
security of sovereign Israel, including united Jerusalem. There 
are some 4.2 million Jews and over 900,000 Arabs inside 
sovereign Israel. Some 120,000 Jews live in the territories, I 
mean Judaea, Samaria and Gaza. They must be protected too, but 
'Afula, Hadera, Netanya, and everywhere else should take 
precedence over all that is in the Judaea and Samaria. In 1994, 
23 Israelis in uniform and civilians were killed, murdered -- 
some 20 of them were killed inside the boundaries of sovereign 
Israel. 
  The Hamas and Islamic Jihad organizations have reached the 
conclusion that they should attack not only settlers -- although 
they are included -- but primarily they decided to focus on 
attacks inside Israel. They realized that they gain political 
profit from the reactions of the Israeli opposition against the 
peace process -- which is their main political aim. It earns 
them more. Anyone who today calls for an end to the 
negotiations is giving Hamas and Islamic Jihad an additional 
incentive to continue their acts of terror. The true answer we 
-- together with the PLO -- should give them is proof that we 
can reach an agreement, that it can be implemented, and that our 
reality changes as a result of the implementation. If we 
succeed in doing this, it would be the answer to the murderers 
of 'Afula and Hadera, and to most of the terror activity that 
resulted in the deaths of Jews. [end recording] 
  The prime minister also spoke today of operative steps 
which will be taken in view of the Hadera attack. He will soon 
instruct the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] to move forces from 
inside the territories and deploy them between the Green Line 
and the territories thereby reinforcing the closure. This will 
create a thicker barrier between the territories and the area 
inside the Green Line. Forces will be moved out from areas 
densely populated by Arabs, the city centers, and create a 
barrier, for example, between Janin and 'Afula and between 
Tulkarm and Hadera. Rabin admitted that the closure does not 
provide an absolute solution. Anyone who really wants to, can 
get out. 
  [Begin recording] [Rabin] The closure is not hermetic. It 
is effective in preventing laborers from carrying out individual 
attacks. It does place some burden on the terror organizations, 
but does not prevent their activity altogether. Some 10,000 
Israeli cars cross daily from Judaea and Samaria alone into 
Israel. No one can expect soldiers at checkpoints to be able to 
discern whether a car bearing a yellow [Israeli] license plate 
is not driven by an Israeli civilian and is getting across. 
Unless we introduce a more serious separation, there would be 
no certainty that a bomb is not placed in an Israeli car stolen 
in Israel, or that an individual does not cross the lines and 
reach 'Afula or Hadera on foot. All he has to do is cross a 
certain line, catch a ride, or walk. Most of them speak Hebrew 
and are able to do this. We must invest more in this and, as I 
said before, we will move out troops currently engaged in the 
protection of settlements. After all, Elon More [Jewish 
settlement] does not protect 'Afula! It is protected by the 
IDF, the Israel Police, and the Shin Bet. 
  [Segal] Mr. Prime Minister, you spoke of the wave of terror 
striking at us now. Do you believe that after the Gaza and 
Jericho agreement is implemented the situation will improve? 
  [Rabin] The test will be in Gaza and Jericho. I cannot 
demand that an Arab leader in Tunisia be able to have a bigger 
impact on Judaea and Samaria than the IDF has while in control 
of the territory. Can the PLO influence Hamas or the Islamic 
Jihad which carry out most of the terror acts? Here and there 
are some who quit the PLO and take to terror, but we have such 
people everywhere. Therefore, the real test will be when they 
assume responsibility, after we reach an agreement. Then, they 
will have to meet the commitments they made in the agreement. 
That is why we insist on reaching an agreement that would 
provide us with the utmost security. [end recording] 
  Another question posed to Rabin was on the recent decline in 
the public's support for the government's moves. Rabin said in 
response that the opposition does not have an alternative. What 
they are suggesting is a political freeze which will lead to an 
escalation. This, in fact, is exactly the aim of the Palestinian 
factions which carry out the terror attacks. Rabin was asked 
for his view of the public opinion polls showing this decline in 
public support. 
  [Begin Rabin recording] I became prime minister of my own 
free will. I struggled through Labor primaries and the Knesset 
elections. I did not seek this chair just to sit there. I 
believed that I should do things differently from the previous 
governments, also on domestic issues, but let us leave this for 
the moment. Primarily, I wished to give new meaning to 
negotiations on the basis of the Madrid conference. I 
acknowledged that there is only one Palestinian partner, if we 
stop the masquerade -- the PLO. The Palestinians are split: 
Some support the PLO, and there are those who opt for terror, 
but the bulk of the Palestinians support the PLO and opt for 
negotiations. The other half, the other part, are the 
supporters of Hamas and the Islamic Jihad who want to continue 
the war, terror, and violence against us, and reject any 
political arrangement. We must find a partner for the 
agreement. Past hopes that Palestinians from the territories 
could do this were proven absolutely unreal. I know that I am 
facing a decline in the Israeli public support for the move -- 
because of the terrorism, not because of the nature of the 
political solution. I will not change my policies in view of a 
certain public opinion poll held on a certain day, week, or 
month. As long as I have a Knesset majority, I will carry on in 
this way. I wish to exhaust the chance to attain peace. As I 
have said before, the alternative is a freeze and escalation 
with all that entails. Let us not forget, the signing of the 
Declaration of Principles had an impact on the Arab world. 
Otherwise Israeli delegations could not have gone to Oman to 
prepare a meeting of a multilateral committee there, or in 
Qatar. Did anyone believe such things and others which will 
follow could happen? Many in the Arab world and outside it had 
believed that the heart of the conflict is the 
Israeli-Palestinian conflict -- and I am not saying that this is 
correct or incorrect. The fact that we dared to deal with it 
has opened new horizons for us. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin by Karmit Gay, </F>
Sheli Yehimovich, and Shlomo Razon 13 April; place not given -- 
recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Yehimovich] The Jewish 
settlers were once favored by the government, even when your 
party was in power before. Now they have been somehow pushed 
into a corner. Naturally, they are not all made of one skin. 
They are not all Barukh Goldstein. Many of them have a 
different world view. Do you intend at any stage to resume a 
dialogue with them, hold a closer and more frequent dialogue 
with them? 
  [Rabin] In a democratic state, it is legitimate to support 
or oppose the government policies. Staging legal demonstrations 
is legitimate. It is not legitimate to make threats, warn use 
of force. Certainly it is not legitimate to issue halakic 
decrees urging soldiers to disobey orders. To me, this is most 
grave. It is inconceivable to call on soldiers of the IDF 
[Israel Defense Forces] -- which, as the military, is subject to 
the democratically and legally elected government which issues 
legitimate orders -- to disobey an order. Had we accepted the 
principle that anyone may decide for himself what is right and 
what is not -- whether he is a rabbi or a public figure -- 
hundreds and thousands of soldiers would have refused to serve 
in Lebanon, and hundreds, if not thousands, would have refused 
to serve in the territories. 
  I believe the Jewish nation has a right to settle in Eretz 
Yisra'el, but according to a concept. When I was prime minister 
between 1974 and 1977, I prevented the establishment of a Jewish 
quarter in Hebron. I believed it was a mistake. This is what 
Qiryat Arba' is for. I opposed setting up Jewish settlement in 
areas densely populated by Palestinians. I agreed to the 
establishment of settlements in the 'Etzyon Bloc, in Qiryat 
Arba', in the Jordan Rift Valley, and on the outskirts of 
Netanya, such as Alfe Menashe, and Elqana. I never wanted 
settlement in the heart of the Palestinian population in Judaea 
and Samaria, between Ramallah and Nabulus. 
  Jewish history mentions Nabulus but, for example, Ashqelon, 
Qiryat Gat, and Ashdod are situated on historic Philistine land. 
Today they are rightfully part of the State of Israel. I do not 
suggest that we view the Bible as the book of maps of the Jewish 
state. To me, the Bible is the book of religion, real values, 
real codes, tradition, and history of the Jewish nation. This 
is how I studied it. Not as the book of the precise maps of the 
Jewish state. [passage omitted]

  [Text] At this morning's ceremony at the president's 
residence, reporter Amy Rhodes asked Foreign Minister Peres how 
he responded to 'Arafat's phone call to Prime Minister Rabin 
last night. 
  [Begin recording] [Peres] Well, we appreciate the call. We 
would like to see a more definite language, but this is a 
decision for Mr. 'Arafat, not for us. We shall condemn any and 
every act of terror whether it will be against innocent Arab 
people or innocent Israeli people. Nobody has the right to take 
away the life of anybody. 
  [Rhodes] Has the Israeli Government expressed to 'Arafat 
that they would like him to use stronger language? 
  [Peres] We are not offering lessons to anybody. It is for 
'Arafat to decide the language he wants to use. 
  [Rhodes] Is the Israeli Government satisfied with what he 
said? 
  [Peres] Our job is to provide security and to continue with 
peace. We are not in the business of reviews. 
  [Rhodes] The opposition is saying that if 'Arafat cannot 
even come out and condemn the attack, what kind of peace are we 
actually making? Can you comment on that? 
  [Peres] He is making peace with us. You know, the 
opposition is measuring and judging everything by declarations. 
Declarations are important. They are not the most important 
thing, and I do see that the opposition is having a summer 
collection of wintry declarations. It is of no importance. 
Words are words and actions are actions, and changes are 
changes, and we are not in the business of confusing it like the 
right is doing. [end recording] 
  [In a similar report on Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 1000 
GMT on 14 April, referring to 'Arafat's response to the latest 
terrorist attack, Peres says in a recorded passage: "I believe 
that for his own sake and for the sake of his nation, he should 
come out with the sharpest condemnation of terror."]

<F P=106> [Report by Aluf Ben, Eytan Rabin, 'Amira Hess, and Yosi </F>
Torpstein] 
  [Excerpts] The Palestinian delegation has notified the 
Israeli delegates in Cairo that the PLO will not send policemen 
to Gaza and Jericho before the withdrawal agreement is concluded 
and signed. 
  Israel has agreed that 300 Palestinian policemen, mainly on 
the command level, immediately enter the region to overlap with 
the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] officers while the Palestinians 
study the region and receive the buildings and equipment. The 
PLO had asked that 1,000 policemen be immediately given full 
powers on the ground. When Israel refused, the PLO decided that 
the Palestinian police force enter Gaza and Jericho only after 
the agreement is signed. [passage omitted] 
  Russian President Boris Yeltsin does not intend to visit the 
Middle East next month and will not visit 'Arafat in his new 
Jericho headquarters, contrary to reports which appeared in Arab 
newspapers and were quoted in Israel. This transpires from 
messages which have arrived from Moscow over the last few days. 
According to these messages Yeltsin is extremely occupied by 
internal Russian issues, and will not be able to tour the Middle 
East in the near future. 
  Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres yesterday called on the 
Middle 
East countries to cooperate in the economic sphere in order to 
raise their citizens' standard of living. Visiting Istanbul, 
Peres said: "We must develop regional economy in order to 
equalize the standards of living." 
  Peres said Israel is willing to vacate territories it 
conquered from Arab countries despite strong opposition to this 
move in Israel. "Israel must return territories to Syria, 
Jordan, and the Palestinians. We want to help our neighbors 
achieve prosperity. Israel cannot remain an island of prosperity 
in a poverty-ridden area," Peres said.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with 'Abd-al-Wahhab Darawshah, Israeli </F>
Knesset member and leader of the Arab Democratic Party, in 
Jerusalem, by Fawzi al-Jundi, in Cairo, on 14 April, from the 
"Dialogue From Afar" Program -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Al-Jundi] Let us begin with yesterday's fedayeen 
operation carried out by the Hamas and al-Jihad movements and 
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's statements that he will 
not let the perpetrators wreck the Israeli-Palestinian peace 
efforts. Let us begin with a glance at current incidents in the 
occupied territories and their link with Israel's slowness in 
implementing the Gaza-Jericho accord. 
  [Darawshah] The recent incidents that claimed the lives of 
innocent Palestinian and Israeli people are regrettable and 
painful. The criminal acts carried out by the settlers in the 
al-Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron and other regrettable incidents 
that followed and led to the fall of martyrs from our 
Palestinian people in the West Bank and Gaza have escalated the 
situation. This took place against a background of tangible 
slowness in implementing the Gaza-Jericho accord and the Oslo 
accord, responsibility for which lies with the Israeli 
Government, particularly the prime minister. 
  In general, we can say that these incidents carried out by 
Israeli or Palestinian extremists aim to undermine the peace 
process. Acts carried out by Jewish settlers or the Israeli 
army are reciprocated with retaliatory measures by Palestinian 
elements. What links the Israeli and Palestinian extremists is 
their desire to end the peace process and preclude any progress. 
The Palestinian elements say the Oslo accord is not enough and 
do not want it implemented, while the Israeli extremists 
consider the Oslo accord a betrayal of Jews in Israel and do not 
want to give up an inch of occupied Arab land. Hence, they do 
their utmost to undermine this accord. I believe the Israeli 
Government and the PLO, the Israeli and Palestinian peoples, and 
the entire region's nations have a mutual interest in stopping 
the massacres, repressive measures, hostile acts against 
civilians, advancing the peace process, and implementing the 
accord. This is the real test of Rabin's government now. 
  [Al-Jundi] Yesterday's fedayeen operation was supposed to 
coincide with the completion of the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza 
and Jericho on 13 April. It came in light of Israeli 
statements, especially by the first man in the Israeli 
Government--I mean Yitzhaq Rabin--that the withdrawal dates are 
not sacred. Does this mean a direct answer to the Israeli 
slowness and continuing evasion of commitments? 
  [Darawshah] We want the Israeli Government to adhere to the 
accord and the Israeli Army to withdraw immediately from Gaza 
and Jericho and from all the occupied Arab territories. This is 
our principled stance. Those who commit such acts aim to 
destroy the entire peace process. They do not want to encourage 
the Israeli Government to implement the accord but want to end 
the peace process. 
  We strongly condemned the massacre at the al-Ibrahimi 
Mosque and the painful incidents against Israeli civilians in 
'Afula and Hadera. These acts harm relations between the two 
peoples, hurt the peace process, and intensify the old enmity in 
the region. We must work to curb these acts and advance the 
peace process to achieve Arab rights. Only through a peace 
agreement can the Palestinian people achieve their national 
legitimate rights. The main solution is a peace agreement 
ensuring an end to the occupation and recognition of the 
Palestinian people's right to self-determination. When we say 
an end to occupation, we mean the removal of Israel's occupation 
of all the Arab territories in the West Bank, Gaza, the Golan, 
south Lebanon, and the occupied Jordanian territory. 
  Israel must know that the Palestinians are a struggling 
people, eager for their freedom and independence, and cannot 
accept the continuation of occupation. The Israeli Government 
must realize that as long as the occupation continues, violence 
and resistance will continue and innocent victims from both 
peoples will continue to fall. The key is in the hand of the 
Israeli Government. I hope this government and the Israeli 
public will wake up and realize that continuing occupation means 
continuing bloodshed on both sides. One side cannot keep 
everything it wants and continue the occupation without 
expecting resistance from the other, the Palestinians. 
  [Al-Jundi] The Israeli Knesset, of which you are a member, 
can put pressure on the Israeli Government, although the ruling 
Labor Party enjoys a majority in the Knesset. How can the 
Knesset and the Israeli public pressure Yitzhaq Rabin and his 
government? 
  [Darawshah] Regrettably, the recent painful incidents in 
both 
'Afula and Hadera in the past few days in which innocent people 
were killed and scores were injured boosted the rightist forces 
on the Israeli street. The Israelis reacted negatively to these 
incidents. This puts great pressure on the Israeli Government 
concerning the peace process. Even in the Knesset, the 
right-wing trend has gained ground. Although the government 
retains the majority in the Knesset, the rightists, primarily 
the Likud Party, have intensified their attack against the 
government, accusing it of adopting a weak position toward the 
Palestinians and of encouraging terrorism. These acts backfire 
on the Palestinian people and on the peace process. I do not 
believe that the killing of more citizens, Arabs or Jews, will 
resolve the conflict in the region. The solution must be 
peaceful and the Israeli Government must work to withdraw 
immediately from Gaza and Jericho and allow the PLO to assume 
Palestinian sovereignty on Palestinian territory there. 
Agreement on the permanent solution, not only the interim one, 
must also be accelerated. 
  [Al-Jundi] Thank you. 
  [Darawshah] You are welcome.

Among the six killed was apparently the terrorist himself. 
Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] has claimed responsibility 
and says more attacks can be expected. Most of those hurt 
sustained light injuries, and most of those have already been 
released from hospital. In Hadera demonstrators protested 
against the violence and government policy. [passage omitted]

decided, as of today, to begin conducting car patrols and 
lookout posts on vehicles and people traveling on the road from 
Ma'ale Efrayim to the Tapuah junction. Council head Hayim Aviv 
informed the commander of the Central Command and the commander 
of the Judaea and Samaria Division that the decision was made in 
the wake of an increase in hostile activities against Israelis 
on this road. According to Aviv, the settlers are not getting 
appropriate protection from the Israeli Defense Forces. This is

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with 'Arafat adviser Ahmad al-Tibi by </F>
Mikha Friedman; place not given -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Al-Tibi] With your 
permission, I would like to address the Hadera event. Innocent 
people, blameless civilians riding a civilian bus were murdered 
on their way from 'Afula to Tel Aviv. Murder is murder, and I 
repudiate this in no uncertain terms. Even if I ignore 
everything that happened before, murder is murder. Yet we 
should all remember that both sides are paying with precious 
blood. What started with the Hebron massacre and continued in 
'Afula and in Hadera and Jericho today should motivate us all to 
prevent murderers from both sides from achieving their one and 
only purpose -- harming the peace process and the chance for 
compromise between the two nations. [passage omitted] 
  I see no option other than sitting down and completing the 
agreement as soon as possible, in order to reduce the level of 
violence and terror to a minimum. 
  As for condemnation, it must come from both sides. As I have 
condemned today's event, I expect to hear a condemnation of what 
happened in Jericho today; of the cold-blooded killing yesterday 
of a pregnant woman in al-Jib; of the appalling demolition of a 
house belonging to a senior PLO official in Ramallah, which was 
also intolerable, although no one was hurt. Appalling things 
happen on both sides, and they merit a second look even when 
they are carried out by the authorities. 
  [Friedman] Dr. al-Tibi, we ran a seemingly astonishing 
report this morning about an ongoing dialogue in Gaza between 
the moderate, peace-seeking Fatah and Hamas [Islamic Resistance 
Movement], which is usually seen as an enemy of peace. There is 
talk of cooperation when autonomy is implemented there. Can you 
confirm it? 
  [Al-Tibi] Local-level meetings have been held in Gaza 
between people from all elements. The purpose of these meetings 
was to avert conflicts and bloodshed among Palestinians in the 
Gaza Strip. No one expects the Palestinians to start killing 
each other, and therefore the statement issued today by one of 
the Hamas leaders, saying they will respect and defend the 
Palestinian police, is a step in the right direction. I welcome 
it. 
  [Friedman] Except that 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam is not a party 
to this dialogue. 
  [Al-Tibi] There are clear discrepancies between the stands 
of the Palestinian leadership, namely the PLO, and Hamas, on the 
political process. It is no secret that the PLO favors 
continuing the political process, while Hamas is opposed to it 
and is even fighting it. 
  [Friedman] Will the Palestinian police and the Palestinian 
security services relentlessly fight the 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam 
peace opponents? 
  [Al-Tibi] Whenever I hear people call for a Palestinian 
civil war, I reject it categorically. 
  [Friedman] A relentless struggle is a determined fight 
against those who are out to kill you too, not just me. 
  [Al-Tibi] But the Palestinian leadership and the Palestinian 
national authority will do all it can to maintain order and 
security in a democratic fashion in the framework of the 
Palestinian national rule in Gaza and Jericho. 
  [Friedman] Dr. Ahmad al-Tibi, thank you very much. 
  [Al-Tibi] Thank you.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Dr. Nabil Sha'th, head of the </F>
Palestinian delegation to the Cairo talks, in Tunis, by Moshe 
Shlonsky, commander of IDF Radio in Tunis, "earlier today" -- 
recorded in English] 
  [Text] [Shlonsky] Mr. Sha'th, what is your reaction to 
this morning's terror attack in Hadera? 
  [Sha'th] I have heard of this incident, and it makes me very 
sad and very angry to see civilians, innocent people get killed 
in Hadera, in 'Afula, in Hebron, or in Gaza. To me this is all 
needless bloodshed of innocent people that should be stopped 
immediately; by continuing the peace process, it can be stopped. 
  [Shlonsky] You know, the Israelis are waiting for an 
official condemnation by Chairman Yasir 'Arafat... 
  [Sha'th, interrupting] The chairman has just made a 
statement in Strasbourg that I believe has been communicated 
everywhere. 
  [Shlonsky] In which he is condemning the attack? 
  [Sha'th] Yes. 
  [Shlonsky] You know, the Israelis were very surprised after 
the Hebron...not surprised, but maybe disappointed, that after 
the Hebron attack the Palestinians withdrew from the talks. Do 
you expect the Israelis to do the same now or to continue it? 
  [Sha'th] I think we should continue this peace process, 
because I think we should not confuse the cause and effect -- I 
mean the more we delay this peace process the more it will 
encourage the enemies of the peace process to continue doing 
things like this, whether in Hebron or in Hadera. And I see now 
more than ever that we need to finish as quickly as possible and 
implement our peace on the ground in order to swing the whole 
public opinion in the Palestinian areas, in the Palestinian 
occupied territories and in Israel to support the peace process. 
  [Shlonsky] You know, there is a feeling in Israel that you 
cannot control your people, or the Palestinians as a whole, to 
continue terrorist attacks [sentence as heard]. The peace 
process is continuing, and while the peace process is continuing 
these terrorist attacks are occurring here and there. 
  [Sha'th] Yes, this is very natural, because so long as we 
have absolutely no way to control these matters -- our police 
force is still totally outside the territories, and our people 
also have occurrences such as the massacre in the Hebron mosque 
-- there is no way to either control by police or to control by 
public support. We have a peace process, but this peace process 
has not been implemented on the ground and people have not seen 
any of its benefits, nor any of its police manifestations.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Nabil Sha'th, head of the Palestinian </F>
delegation to the Cairo talks, by Sa'id Mu'addi; place not 
given, on 13 April; from the "With the Events" program -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, good evening. 
  [Sha'th] Good evening. 
  [Mu'addi] What is your comment on the incident that took 
place in Hadera today? 
  [Sha'th] We can feel only pain and sorrow for the continuing 
innocent civilian victims in the ongoing conflict in which 
scores of the sons of our people in Hebron and Gaza have been 
killed, and the same holds for the victims from the sons of the 
Israeli people in 'Afula, and Hadera today. We always say we 
face these operations with anger and denunciation because they 
strike only innocent civilians on both sides. We say the only 
way to stop this violence on both sides is by quickly signing 
the peace agreement and really implementing it on the ground. 
This will create new conditions, end all violent acts from both 
sides, and abort all the attempts to torpedo the peace 
agreement. Our position on this subject is firm and unchanged. 
I pray for almighty God to help us reach a quick peace 
agreement that protects the sons of our people everywhere, and 
that protects Israeli civilians everywhere, in order to reach 
lasting and just peace. 
  [Mu'addi] Progress in the Palestinian-Israeli talks took 
place yesterday, and this incident took place today. Do such 
incidents influence the peace process? 
  [Sha'th] We can either bow to these incidents and allow them 
to obstruct the peace process, or we can expedite the peace 
process in order to stop these incidents. I believe the second 
option is better. We should create conditions on the ground 
that make it impossible for these operations to continue, or at 
least make them very difficult. I feel pain whenever an 
incident targets civilians. This was my feeling after the Hebron 
and Gaza incidents, and it was the same yesterday concerning the 
incident that took place in the al-Wahidi house in Ramallah. I 
have this feeling any time the sons of our people suffer as a 
result of the continuation of this situation. I have the same 
feelings toward the families of those who were killed in Hadera 
and 'Afula. 
  [Mu'addi] Did the Israelis and the Palestinians have 
contacts 
over the past few hours to prepare for the resumption of talks 
next Sunday? 
  [Sha'th] We have constant contacts. I think we will begin 
new talks next Sunday morning. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, thank you very much. 
  [Sha'th] Thank you.

<F P=106> [Interview with Muhammad Nazzal, Hamas representative in </F>
Jordan, by Raja Talab in Amman "a few days ago"] 
  [Text] [Talab] Was the 'Afula operation a reply to the holy 
al-Ibrahimi Mosque crime or part of a new strategy and method of 
struggle against the Israeli occupation? 
  [Nazzal] The 'Afula operation, carried out by the al-Qassam 
Battalions--the military wing of the Hamas Movement--was the 
first reply to the Hebron massacre. It will be followed by 
three more operations similar to the 'Afula operation in 
influence and power. 
  [Talab] Some Palestinian voices criticized the operation. 
They said the 'Afula operation, which targeted civilians, 
depicted matters as a racist conflict between Arabs and Israelis 
although the conflict is one of liberation and all forms of 
armed struggle should target the occupation army only. What is 
your comment? 
  [Nazzal] Forty days after the Hebron massacre, the 
Palestinian people realized that the international community 
will not take revenge for them. All that the Security Council 
did was to issue a inconsequential statement. Consequently, the 
Palestinian people in all their factions and classes were happy 
for this operation and considered it a restoration of honor and 
dignity. As for the Palestinians you mentioned, they are 
limited in number and isolated. They considered the operation an 
embarrassment and a pulling of the rug from under their feet. 
  [Talab] Will the next operations be similar to the 'Afula 
operation? 
  [Nazzal] The next operations are supposed to be highly 
qualitative to match the magnitude and ugliness of the Hebron 
massacre. 
  [Talab] You have a significant political presence in Jordan 
and Syria and these two countries are parties to the peace 
process. The 'Afula operation must have moved the United 
States, the sponsor of the peace process, to restrain you as a 
Hamas Movement. Have you been exposed to any pressure from 
Amman or Damascus, or to any questioning after this operation? 
  [Nazzal] The operation was received with great joy by the 
Arab and Islamic circles. It came within a context that is 
understood by the Arab and Islamic parties. It is regrettable 
that the PLO condemned the operation although no Arab party did 
so. 
  [Talab] Does this mean you did not come under any pressure 
or 
questioning because of the operation? 
  [Nazzal] No criticism whatsoever was leveled at us by the 
official Arab parties nor were there any pressures because of 
the 'Afula operation. 
  [Talab] Information says the PLO complained to Jordan about 
Hamas' strong political role in Jordan. Was this brought to 
your attention in order to reconsider your role? 
  [Nazzal] We have learned about this complaint from 
unofficial 
Jordanian sources, but nobody spoke to us about it. This, 
however, is indicative of the depth of the PLO leadership's 
impasse. Matters have gone so far in the PLO as to file 
complaints with the U.S. Administration to bring pressure to 
bear on Jordan. I believe there is a Jordanian understanding of 
the Hamas Movement's attitude toward the political settlement 
and the continuation of resistance against occupation. 
  [Talab] After the 'Afula operation, Israel went back to 
say that your movement is receiving financial support from Iran 
and that those who planned and implemented the operation 
received their training under Hizballah in southern Lebanon when 
they were in Marj al-Zuhur. Is this true? 
  [Nazzal] I think the Hamas Movement is able to develop its 
military and security capabilities without having to seek 
outside help. The Movement has an efficient military body that 
gains experience day by day. Hence, talk about Iranian or 
outside financial aid is not true. 
  [Talab] Where do you get your financing from then? 
  [Nazzal] I can say that Hamas finances itself and also 
receives financing from the people. So far we did not receive a 
single penny from any government. 
  [Talab] There are reports that the Hamas Movement is 
involved in plans to get rid of Yasir 'Arafat in order to abort 
the peace process. How true is this? 
  [Nazzal] Hamas does not believe in political assassination. 
It believes that its efforts should focus on resisting the 
occupation and its tools. What is being said about an 
inclination or plan to assassinate 'Arafat or other Palestinian 
figures is baseless. 
  [Talab] But how will you deal, after a short while, with the 
presence of 'Arafat and the Palestinian leadership in Gaza and 
Jericho and later on in the rest of the West Bank? 
  [Nazzal] Hamas' policy is not to clash with the Palestinian 
authority and its tools. This, in any case, does not mean 
stopping the resistance. Therefore, Hamas will continue its 
policy of resisting the occupation until it is removed. 
  [Talab] Do you have any information that 'Arafat agreed with 
the Israelis to get rid of the Hamas Movement? 
  [Nazzal] We have information about intelligence meetings 
between Palestinian and Israeli security bodies to coordinate on 
confronting Hamas and to exchange information on Hamas' 
leadership, cadres, and activities. 
  [Talab] How afraid are you of these meetings, especially 
during the next stage when 'Arafat returns and is in control of 
the West Bank and Gaza? 
  [Nazzal] There is no doubt that we view with caution 
cooperation between the Palestinian and occupation authorities 
aimed at confronting the Palestinian opposition. However, we, 
at the same time, believe that the Palestinian masses will side 
with whoever expresses their hopes and ambitions and represents 
their conscience. The masses will reject all those who are 
cooperating with the occupation and are standing in one trench 
with it. Hence, we are in line with the Palestinian masses in 
terms of continuing the resistance against the occupation. 
  [Talab] There is information that cadres from Fatah Hawks 
inside the occupied territories have turned to the Hamas 
Movement because the Fatah leadership in Tunis stopped financing 
these cadres, hence limiting their military moves against 
Israel. How true is this? 
  [Nazzal] There is no doubt that there is broad opposition 
within Fatah toward a political settlement. This opposition is 
increasing and includes various sectors. Hamas has links and 
channels of communication with those honorable and sincere 
sectors from Fatah, some of whom have been absorbed into Hamas 
ranks, especially from the military elements and cadres. 
Perhaps this could enrich Hamas' experience, especially since 
experienced Fatah cadres have joined the movement. 
  [Talab] It seems that the expertise of the Fatah cadres who 
joined Hamas made itself felt in the 'Afula operation? 
  [Nazzal] No doubt any cadres with past experience who join 
Hamas will provide a qualitative addition to the movement's 
experience and we believe that any cooperation between Hamas and 
the Fatah cadres will constitute a real threat to the occupation 
and its tools. 
  [Talab] Do you have channels of communication with the Fatah 
leadership abroad as you have with Fatah at home? Have these 
connections created coordination between you and them? 
  [Nazzal] Official contacts with the Fatah leadership abroad 
has been frozen since the Oslo agreement. We have individual 
contacts with certain Fatah opposition figures but these are 
personal contacts. 
  [Talab] Are you considering promoting these contacts with 
Fatah opposition figures to have a practical effect in foiling 
the peace process? 
  [Nazzal] We welcome any contacts and coordination with the 
Fatah opposition figures and cadres provided this coordination 
and cooperation is intended to confront the occupation. 
  [Talab] But are they also prepared? 
  [Nazzal] There are certain Fatah cadres who coordinate and 
cooperate with the Hamas Movement. 
  [Talab] Is there any practical coordination on the 
leadership 
level? 
  [Nazzal] There is none. 
  [Talab] You opposed Mustafa al-Natshah's appointment as 
mayor 
of Hebron and demanded municipal elections. How do you support 
a municipal election that is not rejected by the occupation 
while at the same time you oppose participation in electing a 
Palestinian authority if these elections are not rejected by the 
occupation? 
  [Nazzal] We have always supported and still support 
municipal 
elections that are not connected with any political plan because 
municipal elections are the means by which services can be 
extended to the Palestinian public, alleviating their suffering 
and improving their health and social conditions. Therefore, we 
call for municipal elections in every Palestinian town. This 
happened in 1976 and those elections were not connected with any 
political plans at a time when all the Palestinian forces were 
opposed to recognizing the Israeli enemy and had a stand that 
was similar to the current Hamas position. Therefore, we do not 
find it embarrassing to accept elections provided they are not 
linked with a political plan. 
  [Talab] In a statement to the press, Israeli military 
intelligence chief Uri Sagi [name as published] said that Hamas 
will participate in electing a Palestinian authority under a 
non-Hamas platform because he believed that the pragmatic trend 
within Hamas in the occupied territory will exercise pressure in 
this direction. How do you comment on this? 
  [Nazzal] Hamas' initial decision was not to participate in 
the autonomy elections. This decision was based on Hamas 
rejection of the Gaza-Jericho agreement and its consequences in 
terms of measures and results. Therefore, the talk on Hamas' 
participation is by way of exploration, feeling the pulse, and 
drawing conclusions. It is not based on genuine information. 
  [Talab] Is this your final stand on elections? 
  [Nazzal] I am speaking about this situation at this stage. 
Nobody is able to talk of the future. Everything is subject to 
study and reconsideration. 
  [Talab] I understand, then, that you are not closing the 
door 
completely to the question of dealing with the elections? 
  [Nazzal] The door is open to all possibilities. 
  [In a box on page 14, SHIHAN publishes the following "stop 
press" item: "Muhammad Nazzal has told SHIHAN that the bus 
operation was the work of the 'Izz al-Din al-Qassam battalions 
in retaliation against the Hebron massacre, and that Hamas will 
carry out three more operations in retaliation for the grotesque 
massacre at Hebron's al-Ibrahimi Mosque. 
  "Nazzal emphasized that the option of armed action against 
the occupation will continue until the occupation has ended. 
  "It may be mentioned that the above interview with Muhammad 
Nazzal was held some days ago."]

  [Text] Gaza City, Occupied Gaza Strip, April 14 (AFP)--The 
Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) threatened Thursday [14 
April] to carry out three more "surprise" attacks on Israeli 
targets following the killing of 12 Israelis in two bus bombings. 
  "There are three more attacks to come," Hamas said in a 
communique sent to AFP in Gaza City. 
  On April 7, a suicide bomber blew up a bus at 'Afula killing 
seven Israelis and wounding 45 in the first attack to avenge the 
mosque massacre of 30 Muslims by a Jewish settler in Hebron on 
February 25. 
  Hamas said it was proud to claim responsibility in the name 
of its armed branch 'Izz al-Din al-Qassam for Wednesday's attack 
at Hadera that left five dead apart from the bomber and 30 
wounded. 
  "The enemy prime minister (Yitzhaq) Rabin and his 
chief-of-staff Ehud Baraq can expect three more surprises to 
make them control the settlers," Hamas announced. 
  "The Hadera attack is another victory for 'Izz al-Din 
al-Qassam's intelligence and security network," it boasted. "Our 
hero got through all of Israel's security checks." 
  Israel "totally" sealed off the occupied territories after 
the 'Afula bombing in a bid to halt more killings and announced 
that security had been stepped up for Wednesday's memorial day 
for fallen soldiers and independence day on Thursday. 
  Hamas warned Arabs living in Israel to keep away from public 
places where Jews gathered. "We advise them not to get on 
Israeli buses." 
  The communique also criticized PLO chairman Yasir 'Arafat 
for 
voicing regret at the murders. "'Izz al-Din al-Qassam swears by 
God and the gun to defend our national rights." 
  [In a related report, Paris AFP in English at 0904 GMT on 14 
April adds the following: "The young Hamas militant who died 
carrying out the Hadera bus bombing had been arrested several 
times for clashes with Israeli troops, residents of his home 
village said Thursday. 
  ["They named the bomber as 22-year-old 'Amr Salih 'Amarnah 
and said he was from the occupied West Bank village of Ya'bad, 
east of Hadera where a bomb on a bus Wednesday killed five 
Israelis and wounded 30. 
  ["Israeli troops had arrested 'Amarnah several times, 
villagers told AFP. 
  ["Police said the assailant in the Hadera bombing, which 
coincided with Israel's memorial day for its soldiers who have 
fallen in battle, came from the West Bank but did not name him. 
  ["They said he had also placed a second bomb in the Hadera 
central bus station, timed to explode 90 minutes after the first 
blast and at a time when Israelis observed a minute of silence 
for their fallen soldiers. 
  ["Explosives experts blew up the second bomb."] 
  [In another related report, Paris AFP in English at 0915 GMT 
on 14 April adds the following: "Hamas spokesman Ibrahim 
Ghawshah, in an interview published Thursday, said the group was 
ready to halt deadly attacks on civilians inside the Jewish 
state if Israelis stopped `killing our children.' 
  ["`The principle of reciprocity is the same everywhere,' he 
told the London-based Arabic newspaper AL-HAYAH. 
  ["`When Rabin stops killing our children and our women, 
Hamas 
will stop attacking civilians and it will target only troops and 
settlers,' the spokesman said. 
  ["`The shabab (youths) of the intifadah will do miracles and 
will prove that the Israeli army is a paper tiger,' Ghawshah 
warned. 
  ["He also blasted 'Arafat for expressing regrets. `The blood 
of Palestinian children and women is not cheaper than the blood 
of Israeli civilians,' he said."]

  [Text] Amman-AKHIR KHABAR--Instructed by PLO Chairman Yasir 
'Arafat, PLO Executive Committee member Yasir 'Amr left for 
Damascus for talks with Syrian officials following the increase 
in tension between Damascus and the PLO. 
  Sources close to the PLO said 'Amr's mission is to try to 
ease tension and stop the media campaigns Damascus is launching 
against the PLO leadership as a result of the signing of the 
Oslo and Cairo agreements, which Damascus views as deviation 
from unified Arab position in the Arab-Israeli negotiations. 
  The sources said 'Amr will brief Damascus about what is 
going 
on in Cairo, and will discuss the cordon states meeting and the 
possibility for the PLO to participate in it. 
  'Amr was a member of the Syrian Arab Socialist Ba'th Party 
during the 1960's and 1970's, and he was a former member of the 
party's Regional Command. 
  The visit is taking place at a time when the PLO leadership 
is facing a real crisis as a result of Israeli procrastination 
and blackmailing in Cairo talks.

  [Text] Tehran, April 13 (MENA)--Iran has started setting up 
a nuclear power plant in Bushehr Province south of Tehran with 
the aid of Russian experts. 
  An informed Iranian source told reporters today that an 
agreement was reached with the Russian authorities a few months 
ago on the implementation of the first phase of the facility. 
  Construction of the project, which will take four years to 
operate with full capacity, started in March, the source said. 
As much as 30,000 tonnes of necessary materials were 
transported from Germany to Iran, he said. The German 
Government refused however to ferry another 7,000 tonnes, he 
added. [words indistinct]

Years"] 
  [Text] Cairo, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Cairo will in May 
witness the first Egyptian-Russian summit meeting in over five 
years. Russian President Boris Yeltsin will visit Egypt during a 
tour of the Middle East which will take him also to Syria, 
Jordan, and Israel. 
  Reliable political sources in Cairo have told AL-SHARQ 
AL-AWSAT that the peace process in the Middle East will be high 
on the agenda of the first summit meeting between Egyptian 
President Husni Mubarak and Russian President Yeltsin. A round 
of talks confined to the two leaders will be held before the two 
delegations join the talks. Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa 
and Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev will participate in 
the talks. 
  The sources confirmed that the Egyptian-Russian talks will 
discuss in their political and economic aspects ways of 
reinforcing bilateral relations in the various spheres and the 
two countries' contribution to advancing the Arab-Israeli peace 
negotiations, in addition to reviewing two countries' efforts in 
this connection. 
  The discussions will also include the possibility of 
settling 
some of the outstanding issues with regard to payment methods in 
the economic and trade exchange and agreeing on the preparation 
of a new trade exchange protocol guaranteeing an increase in the 
volume of trade exchange between them on the basis of new terms 
by closing the file concerning the settlement of payments 
related to the former Soviet Union. 
  The sources pointed out that Yeltsin's Middle East tour 
reflects a Russian desire to regain the active role to achieve a 
peace based on justice and accentuate Russia's commitment to the 
need to guarantee the legitimate Arab rights to territory and 
peace. 
  AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has learned from political sources that 
Yeltsin and his foreign minister are expected to discuss with 
leaders of the states they are going to visit a number of 
Russian proposals and initiatives that will reflect positively 
on the Arab-Israeli peace negotiations. And that the Russian 
talks in Israel will deal primarily with settling the 
Arab-Israeli conflict in a comprehensive manner that is fair to 
all parties.

<F P=106> [Report by Toaj-al-Din 'Abd-al-Haqq: "Gulf States Discuss </F>
Developing Peninsula Shield and Early Warning Network"] 
  [Excerpts] Abu Dhabi -- Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] 
chiefs of staff held a closed meeting in Dubayy yesterday. It 
focused on ways of developing and enlarging the Peninsula Shield 
Force and linking radar networks in the member states in the 
form of an early warning network. The meeting of the GCC chiefs 
of staff is considered the first practical step toward 
implementing a number of recommendations the GCC defense 
ministers made during their meeting in Abu Dhabi last November, 
which were referred to the GCC leaders during their December 
summit meeting in Riyadh. [passage omitted] 
  Sources at the GCC General Secretariat say that "the joint 
Gulf early warning network which has been agreed will not lead 
to a radical change in what already exists in the member states. 
This network will amount to a coalition among the radar 
networks the Gulf states own at present and what they plan to 
own in the future, provided a mechanism is secured to guarantee 
a smooth flow and exchange of information among the armed forces 
of the member states." The meeting of the chiefs of staff 
committee will determine a location for the command of the early 
warning network system. 
  Regarding development of the Peninsula Shield, there is an 
agreement to enlarge it, namely by each state allocating units 
from its army to join the Peninsula Shield Force whenever 
necessary or during joint exercises and maneuvers. 
  There is also an agreement that the Peninsula Shield Force 
command be assumed by turns among the member states, provided 
that the headquarters of these forces remains in the Kingdom of 
Saudi Arabia and that a unified general staff, based in Riyadh, 
is formed for these forces. 
  Regarding financing and armament, each state will contribute 
according to the number of units it allocates to the Peninsula 
Shield Force. 
  GCC Secretary General Shaykh Fahim al-Qasimi says that the 
recommendations are intended to develop the Peninsula Shield 
Force and to make it a deterrent force with an early warning 
network in order to guarantee the region's stability and 
security. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The prime minister says any suggestion to restrict 
the country's nuclear option is unacceptable in view of 
Pakistan's acquisition of nuclear capabilities. Addressing the 
Army Commanders Conference in New Delhi today, Mr. Narasimha Rao 
said India is in favor of a time-bound universal and 
nondiscriminatory nuclear disarmament. He said New Delhi has 
always advocated peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Referring to 
the allegations of human rights violations, he said that 
anti-India forces are using these for political exploitation. 
Mr. Rao called upon such forces to stop maligning India on this 
score as New Delhi's concern for human rights is second to none. 
The prime minister said that the low intensity conflict 
sponsored by Pakistan in Jammu and Kashmir is a major challenge. 
Islamabad is sending terrorists, including foreign mercenaries, 
to the state, he added.

  [Text] An authoritative source announced in Beirut that two 
Iraqi diplomats were arrested in Beirut today on suspicion of 
killing Iraqi opposition figure Talib al-Suhayl yesterday. The 
source added that the two diplomats are the economic attache at 
the Iraqi Embassy Khalid Khalaf and the cultural attache 
Muhammad Kazim. The two diplomats have been working in Beirut 
since August 1992. An embassy guard, who is on the run, is also 
a suspect. Sources at the Lebanese Foreign Ministry said that 
diplomatic immunity does not prevent apprehension for 
interrogation. 
  In a statement to AFP, 'Awwad Fakhri, Iraqi charge 
d'affaires 
in Beirut, said he is not aware of these facts and that he has 
officially informed the Lebanese Foreign Ministry that two Iraqi 
diplomats have not reported to work. 
  Slain Iraqi opposition figure Talib al-Suhayl, 70, had lived 
in Lebanon for many years, held Jordanian and Saudi passports, 
and was married to a Lebanese woman. He was shot dead in his 
house in Beirut by a gun equipped with a silencer.

  [Text] His Majesty King Husayn has said Jordan's 
participation in the peace process emanated from Jordan's belief 
in, and firm conviction about, the need to achieve a 
comprehensive, just, and lasting peace in this region, whose 
peoples suffered from the causes of tension and conflict 
throughout past decades. He warned against serious difficulties 
and obstacles facing the peace process. 
  His majesty also said failure to achieve a real breakthrough 
on the path to a just, comprehensive, and lasting peace in the 
region will result in a state of frustration and tension that 
will lead to violence. He called on the states concerned with 
achieving peace and stability in this region to make further 
efforts in order to promote this process and enable it to 
achieve its objectives. 
  His majesty pointed to the constant principles of the 
Jordanian position on the peace process, based on implementing 
the resolutions of international legitimacy and extending all 
assistance and support to the Palestinian brethren to enable 
them to achieve their rights on their national soil. 
  His majesty's remarks came during his reception of the 
information mission for fact-finding in the Middle East at the 
Royal Hashemite Court today. This mission comprises 
representatives of media and press bodies from various world 
states. 
  At the beginning of the meeting, His Majesty King Husayn 
welcomed the members of the mission, and briefed them on the 
dimensions of the democratic and developmental Jordanian march 
and Jordan's achievements, which are appreciated and admired by 
everyone. The meeting was attended by Marwan al-Qasim, his 
majesty the king's political adviser; and Muhammad Rasul 
al-Kilani and Dr. Khalid al-Karaki, advisers to his majesty the 
king.

  [Excerpts] Arab League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 
'Abd-al-Majid held a news conference this morning in the Press 
Syndicate office. 
  He said the south Lebanon issue has nothing to do with the 
Middle East problem. He expressed the hope that the Lebanese 
negotiations [with Israel] would resume and that Israel would 
withdraw from south Lebanon and from all the occupied Arab 
territories, because the Arabs have a just cause. 
  In his news conference, which coincided with the 19th 
anniversary of the war in Lebanon, Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said: We 
hoped the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho would have 
been implemented today. But Israel has retreated from its 
position. He stressed that the Arabs have a just cause and that 
the negotiations must continue and succeed, especially if the 
aim is to achieve peace: 
  [Begin 'Abd-al-Majid recording] There are of course 
difficulties and obstacles facing the peace negotiations. This 
is happening on every track: the Palestinian, Syrian, Lebanese, 
and Jordanian. But the peace process must continue and we must 
not decide to stop the negotiations with Israel. I do not 
support such a stance because we have a just cause. It would be 
the easiest thing to stop the negotiations but the most 
difficult thing to resume them, especially if their aim is to 
achieve peace. Peace is [words indistinct] and is missed most 
by those who are deprived of it. [passage omitted] 
  The peace negotiations must continue but continuing them 
does 
not mean I capitulate. Never. I insist on my stance and do not 
abandon my demands. I do whatever would ensure the success of 
these negotiations and peace. I reiterate that peace is not a 
gift from Israel to the Arab countries. Not at all. Israel is 
acting as if it is honoring us with peace. Thank you very much. 
When the just and comprehensive peace is achieved, Israel will 
be among the first to benefit from it. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by Amir </F>
Neumann and Daniyel Ben-Simon in Jerusalem on 6 April] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [DAVAR] Can you foresee how 
relations between Israel and its neighbors will develop from the 
current situation in the region? 
  [Peres] Undoubtedly. I think that it is only the start, and 
to tell the truth -- I am impatient. I believe we have one year 
in which to act. I believe that campaigning will begin next 
year, so that we are left with one full year. That is not a 
great deal of time. The Golan Heights is our last hurdle, and I 
ask: What do we do in that year? What do we do with that 
hurdle? What can we achieve on a security level? 
  My answer to that is that a new system of relations has to 
be 
achieved also here. We have to achieve regional security. We 
have to insist on two conditions with the Syrians: One, 
comprehensive negotiations, which will end the war with all the 
Arab states, except for Iraq, Iran, and Libya. Second, to begin 
a new strategic setup that responds to the threat of missiles 
and nuclear arms through an early warning system and 
nonaggression pacts, which will provide security to the nations. 
  It will be a joint Middle East structure, plus the United 
States, plus Russia, based on the NATO model. In addition, a 
new economic system has to be set up. Whoever thinks he can 
live outside the region is making a terrible mistake. I want 
two things: To end warfare with all the states and to set up a 
partnership of peace and not compulsory arbitration of former 
conflicts. 
  [DAVAR] Will you have enough time to present a new 
geopolitical situation prior to the next elections? 
  [Peres] We will not present a new geopolitical situation, we 
will recognize the existing geopolitical situation. Borders and 
one kilometer more or less will not decide our fate. What will 
decide it will be if we have an early warning system, 
nonaggression pacts, agreements giving warning of false alarms, 
and accords on arms limitations with mutual supervision. 
  [DAVAR] Has there been progress in the contacts with Syria 
on those issues? 
  [Peres] Nothing has begun yet with Syria. There has been an 
improvement in the atmosphere, but there are still no 
negotiations. What the Syrians have to understand is that what 
is at stake is not only peace between states, but between 
peoples. In other words, we have to convince our people, and 
the Syrians have to convince theirs, that there is something to 
talk about. 
  [DAVAR] How do you convince your people? 
  [Peres] I tell them what I think. Persuasion is done by 
explaining the situation and by actions. Sometimes the action 
precedes the explanation and sometimes the reverse. The big 
problem is to convince yourself and then to convince others. I 
do not understand why no one is reading the writing on the 
walls. Ask the Likud what it is offering. We have now 
concluded the issue of Gaza, thank God, which is good news. 
From here we have to go on to Syria, and then return to the 
West Bank. 
  [DAVAR] Interlinked negotiations? 
  [Peres] No, each separately. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Speech by Yasir 'Arafat, head of the Palestinian Government </F>
and PLO chairman, in Strasbourg on 13 April -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen, members of the 
European parliament, sincere greetings. On this occasion, I 
would like to express my happiness at meeting you and at the 
opportunity you have given me to speak before you and address 
you. 
  From this platform, please allow me to convey to you 
greetings from our Palestinian people; on its behalf and on 
behalf of brother- members of the PLO Executive Committee, and 
on behalf of the Palestinian national authority, I would like to 
express my extreme thanks and gratitude for the continuous 
support and backing from your respected council for the just 
struggle of our people to achieve a just and comprehensive peace 
in our region and in Palestine, the land of peace, amity and 
tolerance. 
  Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen, we are meeting you today, 
13 April, when our first entitlement under the declaration of 
principles agreement should have been fulfilled with the 
withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Gaza Strip and Jericho as 
laid down in this agreement, which received your support, the 
support of the whole international community, and all those who 
love freedom, justice, and peace in the world. 
  Eight months have passed since the signing of the agreement 
in the U.S. White House, and the Declaration of Principles 
agreement signed between us and the Israeli Government was 
supposed to be carried out and the Israeli withdrawal completed. 
I was supposed to come to you here from Jericho, and I believe 
that this was present in your minds when you sent us the 
invitation to address your venerable council. But the hopes we 
have all built since the signing of the agreement in Washington 
on 13 September 1993 have not materialized along what had been 
agreed upon as a result of Israeli procrastination and slowness 
when it comes to commitment and implementation. More still, in 
the course of this delay, our people were subjected to two 
large-scale massacres in al-Khalil and Gaza, which led to more 
than 90 martyrs and about 800 injured. All this was at the 
expense of peace. 
  I am saying to you truthfully and frankly: Were it not for 
our eagerness for and adherence to peace, to our pledges to our 
people and to the international community, the last massacres 
were enough to abort the peace process as a whole. Because the 
delay in carrying out what we agreed upon in the U.S. White 
House on 13 September 1993 has permitted all the extremist 
forces to engage in this frenzied and grave escalation. Just 
like what happened in 'Afula recently, perpetrated by 
Palestinian extremists, these acts regrettably were aimed at 
hitting Palestinian and Israeli innocent people as well as 
dealing a blow to the peace process. 
  Since the beginning of the peace process in Madrid in 
October 
1991, we, on our side, have made all efforts that could 
facilitate and push forward the process. We have showed the 
required flexibility, the patience, and the commitment to the 
peace process out of our belief in and desire for a just peace 
that would put an end to long decades of bloody wars and 
conflicts in our region and provide all its peoples and states 
with security, stability, and peace. 
  Faced with the new dealing, with the peace content and its 
ensuing outcome, and to consolidate trust-building measures and 
cooperation, we have, since the signature of the Declaration of 
Principles agreements, set up a number of national bodies that 
would be able to play their role in building a free, civil, and 
democratic Palestinian society and establish foundations of 
peace and genuine cooperation among the peoples of the region. 
  Mr. President, please allow me to state here that we were 
expecting, and we were hoping, that the Israeli Government, 
which came to power on the strength of its declared elections 
program that was based on the establishment of peace, to take 
the necessary and the apprriate steps to rebuild the trust 
between the Palestinian and Israeli peoples. We were expecting 
the Israeli Government to turn the page of the armed occupation 
by putting an end to everything that represented a humiliation 
to human achievements, international charters, treaties, and UN 
resolutions. 
  Mr. President, we were also hoping that the Israeli 
Government would have worked for the realization of peace, 
rather than just take measures that guarantee living in peace, 
because nobody can live in peace as long as peace has not been 
achieved in all sectors and at all levels. 
  However, the experience of the past eight months since the 
signing of the Declaration of The principles agreements in 
Washington was disappointing and discouraging. This is because 
the Israeli Government has continued its policy of mass killing; 
arrests; imposition of curfews; the siege on towns, especially 
the town of Jerusalem; the confiscation of land; the 
continuation of the economic embargo; and the support for and 
encouragement of settlers to continue committing the most 
horrible operations of killing and aggression against the lives, 
liberties, and property of the Palestinian people. 
  These actions made possible the perpetration of the vile 
massacre of Hebron in its holiest place, the most valued and 
secure of its temples, and the purest of its victims by armed 
Israeli settlers with the involvement of some units of the 
Israeli Army. That was similar to what was faced by our brothers 
in Algeria from the secret organization in the French Army in 
cooperation with French settlers. 
  Bloody incidents followed persistently, during which the 
Israeli Government punished the innocent sons of the Palestinian 
people by killing and detaining them, by curfew, and economic 
and trade siege. Furthermore, there were regrettable and 
rejected reactions by some Palestinian extremists against 
Israeli civilians, as was the case in Afula. 
  Mr. President, what took place in Hebron and before that in 
al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Gaza, Nablus, and other 
places was the result of the deliberate negligence and 
disgraceful collusion by some Israeli Army units with the 
extremist and racist settlers whose expatriation from their 
original country was facilitated by the Israeli Government, 
which also contributed toward training, arming, financing, and 
encouraging them to settle in Palestinian territory and in the 
center of Palestinian towns, until they became another army of 
occupation and armed groups that are not subject to any law or 
convention and protected by the guns of the occupation soldiers. 
These were demonstrated clearly by the results of the 
investigation carried out by the Israeli judicial authorities. 
  Mr. President, filled with feelings of responsibility, 
sorrow, and sadness, I warn that letting matters proceed as they 
have been since last September will lead us all to a disaster 
that will end whatever hope, trust, and credibility that is left 
among our Palestinian people, the Arab nation, and peace-loving 
people in the peace process itself, and in the ability, honesty, 
and seriousness of the international community in helping to 
achieve and implement it. 
  Mr. President, ladies, and gentlemen! On the basis of their 
understanding of the persistent pain and suffering of our 
people, the European countries have played a leading, effective, 
and prominent role in the international efforts to pass UN 
Security Council Resolution 904 in order to secure international 
protection for our people, continue the efforts to revitalize 
the peace process, and call for the implementation of the 
Declaration of Principles that was signed between the government 
of Israel and the PLO on 13 September 1993 at the White House in 
Washington. 
  On the basis of this and after the passing of the 
resolution, 
we turn to you and to the international community as a whole to 
do your utmost to bring about the implementation of the clauses 
of the resolution expeditiously, particularly with regards to 
securing and deployment of international protection for our 
Palestinian people in Hebron and throughout occupied Palestinian 
territories, the implementation of what was agreed in Cairo two 
weeks ago, and ensuring the success of this experiment by 
applying it in all the towns and villages of Palestine in order 
to ensure a solid start to the final stage and to prevent 
further killings during the transitional period. The 
translation of the clauses of the UN Security Council Resolution 
904 into reality and swift progress in the implementation of the 
agreements signed with the Israeli Government will bring peace 
of mind to our people and strengthen their trust and feeling of 
security, which will make them continue to support the peace 
process in order to achieve the sought after just peace. 
  Mr. President, previously, and on many occasions at 
international and regional gatherings, and during successive 
visits I have paid to many European capitals we have talked and 
exchanged views about the urgent and necessary requirements to 
commence the building of the Palestinian national economy and 
the Palestinian national authority institutions, particularly 
since we will be starting from nothing in the process of 
building and construction of the infrastructure and vital 
installations. The enormity of the destruction and the problems 
experienced by our people as a result of long years of Israeli 
occupation makes it necessary to begin the building process 
expeditiously and puts great responsibilities on and challenges 
to the Palestinian national authority in making up for the 
destruction inflicted on the Palestinian economy and our 
people's social structure by that long and bitter occupation. 
  In order for the Palestinian national authority to be able 
to 
deal with these challenges successfully, it has to be given the 
opportunity to assume responsibility for receiving international 
aid and support, and to direct, invest, and exploit them in a 
way that will ensure changing the painful reality of our people, 
raising their living standard, and solving many accumulating 
economic, social, health, educational, and institutional 
problems. 
  What we aspire for and desire is to see this international 
support materialize in a collective and bilateral cooperation, 
which stems from relations existing between us. The development 
and backing for these relations will strongly enhance our 
ability of movement and activity to confront various problems 
that might hamper the operation of reconstruction and building 
in the way that we aspire and wish for. 
  It is no secret for you to realize that our people boasts 
human capabilities that have positively contributed toward the 
building of some of the best aspects of modern architecture in 
the Middle East. Our people will also continue their innovation 
and use of their capabilities through the edification of our 
civil and democratic society and our free economic and complete 
social institutions, which will form the basis for peace, future 
co-existence, and cooperation in the region. 
  Our people are able to undertake reconstruction and 
rebuilding on the best technical and legal conditions, openness, 
seriousness, and competence in the shadow of a parliamentary and 
democratic system based on freedom of expression, freedom to 
form parties, protection of minority rights, and the minority's 
respect for the majority's decisions. It is a system based on 
social justice; equality; non-discrimination regardless of sex, 
race, religion, or color; and on the foundation of a full pledge 
to Palestine's spiritual and civil heritage based on tolerance 
and co-existence between religions throughout the centuries. 
  We are talking to you in full frankness about our concerns, 
and as our exceptional relations have accustomed us, this will 
make you help us build the future and avert failure, which will 
have a negative impact on the whole peace process. This help 
will be through the provision of all methods of the required 
support. 
  Also, I am addressing you to ask you to make an urgent 
decision to provide appropriate financial help in the form of 
either a gift or loan, which should be put at the disposal of 
the Palestinian national authority to deal with the urgent needs 
of Palestinian life and to help meet the costs of establishing 
Palestinian authority, institutions, and commitments. 
  Europe has a fundamental role in achieving peace and 
consolidating its foundations in the region. It also has a role 
in supporting development in its widest meaning, either through 
governmental backing or through boosting of the private sector, 
on which we attach a great importance in all our projects and 
plans out of our faith and conviction in the role of the private 
sector and its capability to create jobs, transfer technology, 
stimulate the economy, and foster bilateral cooperation. 
  Mr. President, ladies and gentlmen. As you can see, we now 
live in a time when distances have been condensed thanks to a 
considerable technological and scientific revolution that is 
being witnessed by the last quarter of this century. This 
revolution is ushering us into the future and into all its 
challenges. Despite all the injustices, oppression, and 
sufferings that have befallen our people, it possesses enough 
capabilities, resources, and innovative abilities to enable it 
to face up to the challenges of the coming phase, in full 
self-confidence and using full participation, not only in 
building and developing society, but also in contributing 
towards the construction, progress, and the prosperity of the 
Middle East region and human civilization. This will strengthen 
and consolidate the foundations of security and peace in this 
important and sensitive region of the world. 
  It is everybody's duty to contribute to the making of this 
future that will guarantee for our generations security, 
stability, and a future. We aspire for your support and help to 
turn the page of the past with all its pains and tragedies, and 
open a new page of peaceful coexistence, understanding, 
cooperation, solving disagreements peacefully with dialogue and 
arbitration. 
  Mr. President, once again I am addressing you from this 
rostrum, you who represent Europe, to help us save the peace 
process and save our hopes. I am addressing you to help us 
preserve the peace process and to implement what we have agreed 
and (?signed) together with the Israeli Government in the form 
of the declaration of principles in Washington, and the annexes 
we have agreed upon in Oslo, Davos, Paris, and Cairo. These 
agreements have not been implemented so far, despite the passing 
of the defined and agreed schedules to implement them, which is 
a serious and fundamental matter not only for the Middle East, 
but for the whole world. 
  The peace of the brave is in need of your support and 
backing 
because we are currently going through a dangerous turning point 
where the process seems to be at a standstill, which is 
weakening the speedy implementation of it. Yes, we need your 
support, efforts, and endeavors to implement what we have agreed 
on paper and turn it into tangible facts on the ground, so that 
we do not give the opportunity to the extremists, whatever their 
identity, to destroy it or hamper its progress for the sake of 
our and their children, for the sake of a Middle East where 
peoples and nations live in brotherly and constructive peaceful 
coexistence away from the pains and effects of the past, for the 
sake of a new Middle East based on love, good, and rising hope, 
for the sake of a true peace in the land of peace, the sacred 
land of Palestine, the land of the three heavenly messages. No 
voice should rise higher than that of peace, no interest should 
overcome that of the peace, no effort should be spared to 
achieve peace. 
  We are all now shouldering a momentous historic 
responsibility. I pray to God Almighty to guide and help us, to 
give us wisdom and patience to shoulder this responsibility, and 
firmly establish peace, the peace of the brave. Once again, I 
would like to express my gratitude and thanks for giving me this 
nice opportunity to address you. Thank you.

  [Text] Cairo, 15 Apr (MENA)--Dr. Nabil Sha'th, political 
adviser to Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, has stated that 
there is no substitute for continuing the negotiations with 
Israel and expressed his belief that Israel cannot retreat from 
this path. 
  In an interview with the newspaper AL-AHRAM on 15 April, he 
said: We are now completing the first stage, which will not end 
without entering Gaza and Jericho and without the Israeli 
forces' withdrawal. He added that the negotiating process opens 
the door to the [Israeli] withdrawal, the establishment of a 
national Palestinian authority, the entry of the Palestinian 
armed force from abroad in the form of police, and the entry of 
the Palestinian political leadership. 
  He said: Since engaging in the peace process I have become 
convinced that we will reach this land, that the Israeli 
withdrawal is inevitable, and that there is no going back on the 
process. The process may be delayed and cost lives but there is 
no substitute for continuing the negotiations. 
  Asked about the current phase of the negotiations, he said 
it 
represents the last tussle at the negotiating table. 
  He said: We want to learn the date of the signing of the 
agreement so that we can determine the withdrawal date. We have 
agreed with the Israelis to complete the entry of all the 
Palestinian forces during the first week after the signing and 
that the "zero hour" of the Israeli withdrawal will take place 
the following week. Thus there will be a dual authority for one 
week to avoid a security vacuum. We also supported this. But 
the question is: When will this "zero hour" come?

<F P=106> [Interview with Muslim Brotherhood spokesman Ma'mun </F>
al-Hudaybi by Sana' al-Sa'id; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Al-Sa'id] Why has the Muslim Brotherhood washed its 
hands, crawled into its shell, and turned into a spectator in 
the game of terror and extremism? 
  [Al-Hudaybi] We have not turned into spectators. We work 
within our potential. Ours is a constant effort to spread the 
true faith and the correct ideas, which involves eradicating any 
mistaken ideas and unfounded opinions. 
  [Al-Sa'id] But the tide of terror remains high and has not 
been turned back. 
  [Al-Hudaybi] Terror exists and no one can deny it. But I 
cannot destroy it with my current resources. The government 
does not legally recognize my group. All my activities are 
unlawful and my people are prone to arrest. Can I call a public 
meeting? No, it is forbidden. 
  [Al-Sa'id] If you sincerely want to contain extremism and 
terror you will succeed. 
  [Al-Hudaybi] No, not so. They [the government] want us to 
attack them [the terrorists] without spreading the true word [of 
Islam]. 
  [Al-Sa'id] Don't you have a good cause for disclaiming their 
[the extremists'] wrong views? Or are you afraid of them? 
  [Al-Hudaybi] To act, the state should give us leeway. 
Besides, how can I reach these people [the extremists] when 
they work underground. I do not know them. It is not easy for 
me to get to know them. 
  [Al-Sa'id] Rumor has it that you have lines of communication 
with them, isn't that so? 
  [Al-Hudaybi] There are no lines of communication or links 
between us and them. And the stage is not set for me to 
confront them. I cannot change things through preaching when I 
am a wanted man and my group is unrecognized. The first thing 
we should have to confront terror is a climate of freedom in 
which our rights and those of others would be respected and 
everyone would be free to express their opinions peacefully and 
without the use of force or threat of using it. 
  [Al-Sa'id] Some people claim there is an unholy alliance 
between you and the terrorist groups? 
  [Al-Hudaybi] We have nothing to do with them. We continue to 
denounce terror. We oppose violence because it disrupts our 
march, hampers Islamic propagation at home and abroad, and 
tarnishes our image. The government is required to uphold the 
Constitution and respect the law. It should promote justice, 
fairness, and freedom of opinion. The government should play by 
the rules of democracy. It should build true democracy, not a 
bogus one in which elections are rigged and parties are banned 
unless they have the personal approval of the head of state. 
  [Al-Sa'id] You are discussing political rights; I am 
discussing pure religion. 
  [Al-Hudaybi] Impossible. To us, religion and politics are 
interrelated and inseparable. The issue is unrelated with 
religion. No one is being prevented from praying, fasting, or 
performing any rite; he is being prevented from calling for an 
intellectual state built on respect for the basic principles of 
Islamic shari'ah. 
  [Al-Sa'id] There is no difference between what you are 
advocating and what is happening in society. We in Egypt are 
governed by shari'ah; 99 percent of our operational laws are 
derived from shari'ah. 
  [Al-Hudaybi] This is not true. The ratio might not even be 5 
percent. I am a man of law and I know. First, the Hudud 
[Koran-stipulated punishments] are not applied and many laws 
violate shari'ah. 
  [Al-Sa'id] Are you discussing the banking system? 
  [Al-Hudaybi] The entire economic system. There are many 
prohibitions, including prohibition of that which is shown on 
television. Islam is a creed and a code of ethics and conduct. 
  [Al-Sa'id] If this is the situation, you might as well apply 
Islam's criteria on terrorists, who ruin society by killing, 
stealing, and usurping in the name of religion. 
  [Al-Hudaybi] We have no power to apply them; we are not an 
authority to apply them. How can we do that? 
  [Al-Sa'id] By propagating Islam and cleansing terrorists of 
their faults and wrong concepts. 
  [Al-Hudaybi] I am promoting the call, making efforts, and 
speaking. I have no militia to fight people with arms. I am no 
agent for the authority. I propagate my creed and authentic 
Islam. 
  [Al-Sa'id] Nobody asked you to be an agent of the authority 
and nobody prevented you from propagating authentic Islam. 
  [Al-Hudaybi] My call is to distinguish the authentic from 
the 
false. Recruiting me to attack people as if I were a tool in 
the government's hand is rejected. 
  That is why I say that official jurisprudence produces no 
results, because it does not enjoy all its freedom. It is being 
asked to support the authorities. Hence, it loses its 
credibility instantly. 
  [Al-Sa'id] You are accused of having your eyes on power. 
Many fear that you will ride the wave of democracy to destroy 
it. 
  [Al-Hudaybi] Why do they fear for power? Do they stick to it 
or hate it? If they fear for it or if it is bad why do they 
stick to it? 
  [Al-Sa'id] Basically you preach to the people that they 
should observe religion without taking notice of purposes and 
goals or use religion as a means to an end. [as published] 
  [Al-Hudaybi] We preach to people that they should observe 
religion. Government rule is part of the shari'ah and creed. 
The difference between us and others is that we do not call for 
taking power for ourselves. We call on those who are in 
government to apply Islamic shari'ah and say that we will be 
their servants and the first to support them. I am not claiming 
that I represent Islam. We wrote a book in jail in 1969 
entitled "Preachers Not Judges." The book, written by Hasan 
al-Hudaybi, was a response to the calls for repudiation and 
renunciation. We explained these issues and maintained that we 
call for true religion but judge no particular person as an 
atheist. 
  [Al-Sa'id] The relationship between you and the terrorists 
is 
one of specialization but you pretend to have nothing to do with 
them. While you pretend to disapprove of the terrorist 
operations of the extremist groups, you give justifications and 
defend them. 
  [Al-Hudaybi] Anyone who wants to discuss things that have no 
foundation can do so. We have nothing to do with these people. 
  [Al-Sa'id] It is being said that the hardline wing 
represents your first line of defense and that the Muslim 
Brotherhood is hiding behind it until the time is ripe to seize 
power. 
  [Al-Hudaybi] We cannot argue with those people who make 
false 
accusations, because they do not understand our conscience or 
mentality. But they do oppose reality. The investigations into 
the cases of violence, the old case of the war college, the 
killing of al-Sadat, and current events, confirm that the Muslim 
Brotherhood had nothing to do with such actions. Had anything 
been proven against us, it would have appeared immediately, 
because the government does us no favors. 
  [Al-Sa'id] You have reportedly had contacts with the outside 
world, including the United States and Iran. Also, your 
contacts with the Zionist movement are not ruled out. 
  [Al-Hudaybi] We have no connection with any of those. We 
have no relations with Iran, except when we are invited to 
attend a conference there. We have no relations with the United 
States, because nobody would accept having relations with the 
United States. In what way could we benefit from this 
relationship? It is a major disaster. 
  [Al-Sa'id] What about the Zionist movement? 
  [Al-Hudaybi] You should not say anything that is untrue. 
  [Al-Sa'id] You have an international organization with 
charters in Switzerland and Munich. You also have resources 
that enabled you to coordinate the efforts of the political 
Islamic movement in the Arab and Islamic worlds. 
  [Al-Hudaybi] We have no organizations abroad. Do you call 
the attending of an international conference that is attended by 
people from elsewhere an organization, as if we were using this 
conference to stage a coup against the world? 
  [Al-Sa'id] What exactly do you want? Do you want an Islamic 
approach or a religious state? 
  [Al-Hudaybi] First, let's be specific and take, for example, 
the Islamic approach. If we say we want a government that 
abides by Islam, they will then say that this government is a 
religious one and that the Islamic approach is the basis. I do 
not care who applies this. The application of this approach is 
what counts. We are ready to be the servants of the government 
if it applies it. 
  [Al-Sa'id] What issues do you propose as essential in the 
national dialogue? Do you believe the issue of a religious 
party should be considered? 
  [Al-Hudaybi] Parties are civilian. Each party must have its 
line of thought. Is it prohibited for Muslims to set up parties 
that adopt their Islamic creed and thought? 
  [Al-Sa'id] The Constitution makes no provision for religious 
parties. 
  [Al-Hudaybi] But it did not ban them. I am a man of law and 
I challenge this. 
  [Al-Sa'id] But this will open the door wide to religious 
parties and the Copts will demand equal treatment. 
  [Al-Hudaybi] What will happen if they set up a religious 
party? The Copts are no idiots. Let them set up a party. 
Whoever forms a political party seeks to rule to apply his 
principles and dogma. If the Copts in Egypt represent no more 
than 7 percent, they can never contemplate ruling the country. 
But if they want a party, it will be to defend their interests 
and rights and we welcome this. 
  [Al-Sa'id] A conflict will ensue. 
  [Al-Hudaybi] Nothing of the sort will happen. Is the 
application of Islamic principles a novelty? Islam has been 
applied for centuries. Why the fear then? 
  [Al-Sa'id] If the arena is opened to religious parties, 
extremist Islamic currents will demand parties of their own. 
  [Al-Hudaybi] What do we fear? On the contrary, when freedoms 
are guaranteed only the good will survive. Even devious trends 
will expose themselves in such a climate. 
  [Al-Sa'id] But can the state withstand being a field for 
experiments? 
  [Al-Hudaybi] All states have parties. There is no fear of 
parties. 
  [Al-Sa'id] Do you want parties made up of murderers? 
  [Al-Hudaybi] If there is freedom a murderer cannot murder. 
If he kills, the whole world will rise against him, detest him, 
and cast him out. In every state there are parties. Algeria 
had 50 parties. Now there are three. Yemeni parties have 
fallen to three. Issues are always settled; elections provide 
the supportive power of the entire people. 
  [Al-Sa'id] Do you see a need to set up a national front? 
  [Al-Hudaybi] No. All it will do is applaud. 
  [Al-Sa'id] So what is the remedy for terror? 
  [Al-Hudaybi] Freedom. The government restricts freedoms and 
we call upon it to give freedom to the people and abandon the 
use of force. We call on it to hold free elections and call off 
the emergency laws that have been in force since 1981. Even the 
legally recognized parties feel restricted by these laws. The 
government should be truthful, just, and fair to gain the 
people's confidence. There is also a need for economic, social, 
intellectual, and cultural reforms. 
  [Al-Sa'id] I wonder who will take care of the cultural part? 
  [Al-Hudaybi] Anyone who is qualified. I believe the grand 
imam of al-Azhar is qualified and should be given the freedom to 
state everything that he believes. We respect al-Azhar and 
think it has a worthy mission but it needs to win the people's 
trust. It cannot do so if it goes on acting like a government 
clerk who carries out orders. 
  [Al-Sa'id] What do you think of the security confrontation? 
  [Al-Hudaybi] Security efforts alone will lead nowhere. There 
must be freedom, democracy, and parties that truly represent the 
people and work within the basic principles of the Constitution. 
Over 90 percent of the violence is due to despair that there 
will be no change for the better. 
  [Al-Sa'id] Why have you not used your influence to contain 
terror? 
  [Al-Hudaybi] What can we do? Is it not enough that we 
protect all the professional associations of which we gain 
control from any terrorist influence and prevent any terrorist 
ideas from infiltrating them? We are not a government that can 
eradicate terror. I can destroy them if I have freedom. Some 
90 percent of the causes of deviation and violence would 
disappear if the people were given the freedom to express their 
opinions safely and without threat of violence. Violence breeds 
violence.

  [Text] Beirut, 14 Apr (MENA)--Political sources in Beirut 
said today that PLO military personnel in Lebanon have begun to 
collect all types of light weapons carried by individuals in 
Palestinian camps in Sidon and Tyre in south Lebanon. This is 
being done in line with a decision by PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat. 
  Palestinian sources reported that 'Arafat instructed Sultan 
Abu-al-'Aynayn, the camps' military commander, via a message 
delivered to him by a leading Lebanese personality, to collect 
all personal and other weapons from the camps immediately, ahead 
of their transfer to Gaza and Jericho by official Egyptian 
authorities. 
  Abu-al-'Aynayn reportedly received a telephone call from 
Lieutenant Colonel Nasr Yusuf in Tunis asking him to implement 
'Arafat's decision immediately. Lt. Col. Yusuf is the official 
who will command the Palestinian police force in Gaza and 
Jericho. 
  The Palestinian source said some of the weapons have 
already been gathered and their number and type recorded, 
whether they are from military men or civilians. 
  These sources noted that Lieutenant Colonel Munir al-Maqdah, 
the Fatah Forces commander in the 'Ayn al-Hulwah Camp in south 
Lebanon and a man who opposes Yasir 'Arafat, has declared his 
refusal to allow weapons to be gathered from his forces inside 
the camp. He said in a statement today: Our rifles will remain 
under the control of the Syrian and Lebanese Army. 
  Lebanese political circles noted that Palestinian contacts 
took place during the past few weeks. The objective of these 
contacts was to coordinate on gathering weapons from the 
Palestinian camps in Lebanon in preparation for sending them to 
the Palestinian police in Gaza and Jericho. 
  The circles also said that last Monday's storming by the 
Lebanese Army of numerous arms caches belonging to a Palestinian 
faction in the district of Sharhabil, east of Sidon, in south 
Lebanon and the seizure of large amounts of weapons, missiles, 
and hand grenades fall within the framework of a plan set out by 
Lebanese and Palestinian officials. 
  The Lebanese circles expressed their belief that the 
prevailing trend now is to empty all the Palestinian camps of 
weapons as planned. 
  Diplomatic sources in Lebanon reported that interest is 
increasing among Lebanese officials regarding the conditions of 
the Palestinians in Lebanon, in particular after signs emerged 
that conditions inside the camps are worrying in light of 
developments in the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations. 
  During its meeting last night, the Lebanese Council of 
Ministers refused to approve the request submitted by the 10 
Palestinian factions in Lebanon to hold a political rally 
organized together with Hizballah and the national resistance in 
Lebanon.

  [Text] Tunis, 14 Apr (MENA)-- Tunisian newspaper AL-SABAH 
cites European diplomatic sources as saying that the PLO and 
Israel have agreed on the entrance of a Palestinian police 
battalion to Gaza and Jericho at a time yet to be determined and 
on its deployment within a period not exceeding 10 days. 
  According to the sources, this will be followed by the entry 
of the Palestine Liberation Army [PLA], which is made up of 
7,000 soldiers and officers, as a Palestinian police that will 
take charge of public security and prepare for the entry of the 
PLO apparatuses within five or six months. 
  The sources assert that the Palestinian side emphasized a 
number of points during their talks with Israelis in Cairo, 
primarily the commitment to a specific timetable ratified by the 
Israeli side that links the entry of the vanguards of the 
Palestinian police to that of the basic force into the self-rule 
areas in Gaza and Jericho. 
  The Palestinian demands involved the size and armaments of 
the Palestinian police and emphasized that these troops should 
enter with their weapons and equipment and dressed in an 
official uniform. 
  The European sources said that the Palestinian side insists 
on the entry of the police force according to a timetable that 
coincides with the redeployment of the occupation troops not 
later than the end of April. 
  The sources add that the Israeli side is trying to delay the 
entry of the Palestinian police to the period 15 May-1 July. 
The PLO warned against the effect such a measure may have, 
noting that it might create a security vacuum with moral and 
military repercussions, particularly since Israel is encouraging 
the possession of personal weapons in Gaza. The sector is 
witnessing a state of chaos deliberately encouraged by the 
Israelis with the goal of creating more problems for the 
Palestinian leadership before control is turned over to it. 
  According to the sources, the Palestinian side insists on 
the 
entry of the Palestinian police with their official uniform, 
weapons, and equipment to create a reassuring atmosphere of 
dignity. Meanwhile, the Israeli side wants these troops to enter 
in civilian cars or buses with sealed windows, like prisoners of 
war or infiltrators instead of a police force returning to the 
homeland. 
  The European diplomatic sources said that the Palestinian 
side is emphasizing the psychological side by insisting on the 
entry of the police force in the official uniform behind their 
flags in an official ceremony to win additional support for the 
Declaration of Principles. 
  The sources add that the most prominent personalities that 
will lead the vanguards of the police force are Major General 
Nasr Yusuf, commander of the Palestinian police force; Major 
General 'Abd-al-Raziq al-Majaydah, deputy chief of staff of the 
PLA, who will be commander of the Gaza police; Major General 
Mahmud Yusuf, head of the PLO military department, who will be 
commander of Jericho police; and Brigadier General Mamduh 
Nawfal, who will be in charge of criminal security. 
  According to the sources, the commanders of Palestinian 
troops in Yemen, Sudan, Libya, Algeria, Iraq, and Jordan have 
prepared lists of their personnel to prepare for leaving for 
Jordan and Egypt. Moreover, the sources add, the Saudi 
Government has undertaken to transport the Palestinian military 
units on its planes.

  [Text] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, head of the negotiating 
Palestinian team, has warned against the gravity of Israel's 
failure to honor the dates of withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho. 
The withdrawal had been scheduled to take place yesterday, 13 
April. In a press statement published in London today, Dr. 
Sha'th attributed the recent events in the occupied territories 
to the stalemated peace process and the loss of its credibility. 
  Dr. Sha'th said these events signal the importance of 
expediting the peace process. He indicated that the longer the 
parties take to arrive at positive results on the ground through 
the peace process, the more acts of violence we will see between 
the two sides.

  [Text] Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat, head of the Palestinian 
delegation to the peace negotiations, has held Israel fully 
responsible for the escalation of acts of violence in the 
occupied territories. In a statement last night, 'Urayqat was 
quoted as saying that the acts of violence are generated by the 
Israeli occupation troops' daily massacres targeting the 
Palestinian people. He stressed that ending the Israeli 
occupation of the occupied territories and halting the Israeli 
Army's acts of terrorism is the only way to end the acts of 
violence.

<F P=106> [Interview with Sufyan Abu-Zayidah, "prominent Fatah leader </F>
in the Gaza Strip," by Aharon Klein on 13 April; place not given] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Klein] How will you deal 
with Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] when you take over 
control of Gaza and Jericho? 
  [Abu-Zayidah] The Israelis attribute terror attacks, car 
bombs, and stabbings to Hamas and think that all its members are 
the same. However, the truth is that not everybody in Hamas 
thinks the same way or has the same logic and views about the 
near future. There are many moderate people among them, who 
believe in a modus vivendi with the Palestinian rule, similar to 
that of the Islamic movements in the Arab countries, such as 
Jordan. These people have got nothing to do with terror 
attacks, but they represent Hamas. 
  [Klein] Nevertheless, how will you prevent Hamas from 
setting 
out on attacks from the Gaza Strip and Jericho? 
  [Abu-Zayidah] The Palestinian side will not allow car bombs 
or any other attacks to set out from the Gaza Strip. Both 
sides, the Palestinian and the Israeli, will try to prevent it. 
  [Klein] Has Hamas given you any indication that it wants to 
take part in the process? Palestinian sources claim that Fatah 
and Hamas men met on Monday in an apartment in Gaza and that 
they secretly decided to integrate Hamas in the Palestinian 
police force, which will also include 2,000 inhabitants of the 
territories. 
  [Abu-Zayidah] They want to take part in it. They do not 
reject it. However, their integration in the Palestinian police 
force has both its advantages and disadvantages. The advantage 
is that the police force would be representing everybody and not 
just Fatah. The disadvantage is that they might use their jobs 
to smuggle weapons and pass on information against the 
Palestinian rule in the Gaza Strip. 
  [Klein] How much support do you think Fatah could muster in 
the territories? 
  [Abu-Zayidah] It is all a matter of economic success; of 
getting a democratic Palestinian rule established and of 
successfully solving economic problems. Fatah may very well 
enjoy the support of 90 percent of the population if it 
succeeds, and of 30 percent if it fails. Everything depends on 
how we go about translating the transfer of rule to us into 
action. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Occupied Gaza -- Quds Press -- A senior official at 
the PLO office in Gaza has criticized Israeli Foreign Minister 
Shim'on Peres' warning against rapprochement between the 
Palestine National Liberation Movement (Fatah)--the PLO's main 
group which supports the peace process--and the Islamic 
Resistance Movement (Hamas) which opposes the Palestinian 
self-rule accord. 
  Rashid Abu-Shibak, coordinator of the Palestinian police and 
the Israeli Army forces' activities in the occupied Gaza Strip 
said that the issue of rapprochement between Fatah and Hamas 
Movements is an internal issue that concerns only us as 
Palestinians and does not concern any other party. He added: 
Our decision to cooperate is an objective and unquestionable 
decision of our own. 
  Officials from Fatah and Hamas held a meeting in Gaza last 
week to solve problems and differences between the two movements 
in the Gaza Strip. After news of this meeting was revealed the 
day before yesterday, Israeli Foreign Minister Peres addressed a 
warning over Israeli radio that if rapprochement takes place 
between the two biggest organizations in the Palestinian arena, 
then it will be impossible to reach a peace agreement between 
Israel and the PLO.

  [Text] Gaza--Quds Press--The Islamic Resistance Movement 
(Hamas) has called for a comprehensive dialogue among the 
Palestinian forces in order to prevent internal conflict among 
the Palestinians. 
  Dr. Mahmud al-Zahhar, one of the Movement's leaders in the 
Gaza Strip, told a Quds Press correspondent that the Palestinian 
leaderships must hold a dialogue in order to avoid any conflicts 
that could arise among the Palestinians after the implementation 
of the agreement on self-rule in the Gaza Strip and the town of 
Jericho. However, he denied reports that coordination between 
Hamas and the PLO leadership had begun. He accused what he 
called "some parties to the Oslo agreement" of trying to give 
the impression through press statements on these [coordination] 
meetings that there was some sort of political flirtation going 
on between parties that support and parties that oppose the 
present settlement. 
  The Palestinian spokesman said that the Hamas Movement will 
not at all take part in the elections of a self-rule authority 
or in the self-rule parliament and administration. However, he 
explained that the Movement will take part in all the popular 
elections which serve the masses such as municipalities and 
professional unions.

<F P=106> [By Nabil 'Amr] </F>
  [Text] The Alliance of Palestinian Forces [APF] will begin 
meetings in Damascus on 20 April. The APF includes 10 
Palestinian organizations which oppose the Oslo and Cairo 
agreements and all the resulting arrangements, including 
arrangements to implement Palestinian self-rule in Gaza and 
Jericho. The Alliance also includes such organizations as the 
Islamic Hamas Movement, which rejects the achievement of a 
political solution or any peace with Israel. 
  AL-DUSTUR private sources said that the APF organizations, 
which met in the Libyan capital Tripoli last month under the 
auspices of Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi, have become closer 
than ever before. This is especially true since they feel that 
the PLO leadership, which is negotiating with Israel over 
self-rule arrangements, has overlooked the issue of returning 
deportees and releasing detainees. The PLO leadership is 
listening to Israeli conditions which demand that the 
Palestinian self-rule authority bans activities by Hamas, the 
largest of the 10 APF organizations. 
  These sources said that the 10 organizations, which will 
discuss the APF's bylaws, began to prepare their ideas for the 
next stage of struggle in light of developments in the 
Palestinian arena. They also began to formulate a popular and 
organizational action plan inside and outside the occupied 
territories. According to these organizations, this plan should 
foil the mission of the Palestinian self-rule authority and 
thwart the Oslo and Cairo agreements. 
  For his part, Ibrahim Ghawshah, official Hamas spokesman in 
Jordan, said that Israel will not give the Palestinians anything 
and that the Palestinian people inside the occupied territories 
are now more prepared for a militant confrontation with the 
Israeli enemy. This comes at a time when there are reports of 
strong indignation within the Palestinian political circles.

<F P=106> [By 'Abd-al-Ra'uf Arna'ut] </F>
  [Text] Cairo -- AL-NAHAR has learned that a memorandum 
drawn up by a number of leading West Bank and Gaza Strip 
figures. These representatives of the residents of the occupied 
territories declare their non-commitment to any agreements that 
will be signed regarding Palestinian self-rule in Gaza and 
Jericho. This memorandum will soon be presented to the United 
Nations and the envoys of various countries in Jerusalem. 
According to the Palestinian sources who provided this 
information, the initiative for this memorandum came from Dr. 
Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi and some West Bank and Gaza Strip mayors. 
  The memorandum is expected to include many names since it 
enjoys the support of all Palestinian opposition organizations 
in addition to the People's Party and some Fatah figures. 
  The memorandum was drawn up in the wake of the immense 
pressure that Israel is exerting on the PLO in the negotiations 
in a bid to obtain further concessions, not to mention the 
Israeli practices on the ground against Palestinians, such as 
the recent closure imposed on the occupied territories.

  [Text] Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine -- 
al-Aqsa battalions has stated that the Israeli Government would 
be responsible for any failure of the peace process. Israel's 
prevarication and refusal once again to withdraw from Gaza and 
Jericho within the period ending 13 April was a blatant breach 
and a scandalous, open violation of the bases of the Declaration 
of Principles agreement signed in Washington between the PLO and 
the Israeli Government. 
  In a press statement by its chief amir and Abu-'Abdallah 
Fa'iz al-'Aswad, its official spokesman in the occupied 
territories yesterday, the movement added: The procrastination 
of the Israeli side, which is not implementing the withdrawal by 
the set date, will lead to further deterioration of the 
situation in the occupied land. Consequently, the Rabin 
government will be responsible for the developments which will 
result from the non-implementation of the mechanisms of the 
Declaration of Principles agreement. 
  Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine further said 
that the escalation of terrorist acts by the settlers and the 
troops of occupation, the sealing off of the occupied 
territories, and the imposition of a military and economic 
blockade on the children of our Palestinian people would not 
weaken their determination to persevere in their legitimate 
right to rebel, rise, and fight the Israeli occupying enemy 
until the recovery of their legitimate national rights. Namely, 
their right to return and the right to self-determination and 
the establishment of an independent state with holy Jerusalem as 
its capital.

  [Text] For a local Palestinian reaction to the Hadera 
attack, reporter Mark Weiss spoke with Ghassan al-Khatib from 
the Palestinian People's Party: 
  [Begin al-Khatib recording] Well, first of all I feel that 
this is an expected and unfortunate natural reaction to the kind 
of policies and practices the Israeli settlers and Army has been 
practicing against the Palestinian people almost on daily basis. 
Of course, I feel sorry for the killing of any human being, 
including the persons that were killed in Hadera. But we have 
to go beyond just expressing feelings and see exactly why has 
this been happening and what is the way to overcome it. I think 
that it is happening because of the frustration people are 
feeling as a result of the occupation practices and as a result 
of the lack of progress in the peace process. The only way to 
get out of this circle of blood is simply to advance the peace 
process on a fair basis, and second, that Israel should modify 
its practices and policies in the occupied territories in order 
to reduce the tension and the frustration among the Palestinian 
people. [end recording]

  [Text] Brother president Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] this 
afternoon received the three ambassadors of the the European 
Union -- the troika -- led by the Greek ambassador, Konstandinos 
Theodhorakis. During the meeting, they discussed the situation 
resulting from the arrival of 13 April without the 
implementation of the Declaration of Principles agreement. The 
Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho that was expected to 
take place was delayed due to Israeli obstructions and 
procrastination. 
  Brother President Abu-'Ammar explained the importance of the 
implementation of Resolution 904 to provide international 
protection for our Palestinian people starting with Hebron. He 
said: We insist on the presence of the European Union within 
international protection, especially since we are dealing with 
it on the economic front as the European Union, in addition to 
the participation of the two peace conference co-sponsors, the 
Scandinavian countries and Egypt. 
  Brother president Abu-'Ammar thanked friendly Greece for the 
financial aid it had presented to the Palestinian police force. 
Furthermore, the ambassadors of the European Union stressed the 
importance of the European Union's presence as a union among the 
international [protection team], and welcomed the participation 
of some of the member-countries of the union as a first step in 
the international presence. The meeting also reviewed matters 
of common concern with the European Union.
