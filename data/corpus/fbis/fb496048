greetings of Mr. Carlos Menem, president of Argentina. 
  During this meeting, they reviewed the latest developments 
in 
the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations. Brother president 
Abu-'Ammar highlighted the dangers of Israel's resorting to 
procrastination and delay, and failure to abide by the times 
agreed upon for the implementation [of the Gaza-Jericho

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>
  [Text] Brothers: Neither Rabin nor the U.S. White House 
understood the massacre at al-Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron very 
well and accurately; otherwise, the U.S. Administration would 
not have brought the Security Council to a standstill for over 
two weeks, during which it paralyzed it, coerced it, fettered 
its will, and abstained from voting on the preamble of the 
resolution. Neither would Rabin have done as he pleased when he 
refrained from transferring 400 settlers from within the town of 
Hebron to where they should be transferred one day with other 
settlers. The issue of the settlers and the settlements needs 
to be resolved in order to ensure a successful settlement. 
  Since the settlers perpetrated the massacre, although they 
are not alone in this, this issue has become urgent and the 
transfer of the settlers should now be deemed more important 
than anything else, in order to give peace a better chance. The 
number of settlers in the heart of the town of Hebron is 
inferior to the number of victims who were killed or injured 
during [the massacre]. This means that Rabin was not serious 
when dealing with the causes, effects, and consequences of this 
massacre. 
  Consequently, the violence that is now continuing is natural 
and will remain so, because its causes and justifications can be 
easily found in this official Israeli violence and in the 
violence of the settlers towards the [West] Bank and the [Gaza] 
Strip, particularly towards Jerusalem and Hebron. Sadness and 
anger are useless and they do not mean anything it. The 
expression of this sadness and anger is a cajolery [as heard] 
which is of no use to the Israelis in the same way as it does 
not console the Palestinians. The occupation is continuing and 
the defense of 400 settlers in the town of Hebron allows Rabin 
to think that the Bank and the Strip and the Palestinian people 
can be appropriated. Therefore, he goes ahead and closes Hebron, 
seals off the Bank and lays siege to and starves these 
Palestinian people to whom the negotiations offer no bread, no 
security, and not even tranquillity. 
  Nobody supports terrorism, but it is unacceptable to 
everyone 
and to human conscience that our people remain subjected to 
terrorism and that the experiments of violence and racism are 
carried out against them. It is also unacceptable to expect 
them to remain silent and calm. Our people have the right to 
resist. 
  The U.S. Administration should clearly realize that any 
mishandling can only result in violence. The U.S. 
Administration and Rabin now have to handle matters on the basis 
of the principles and good intentions required by the peace 
process. The first of which being the removal of all the 
explosive fuses every time a fuse appears to be endangering this 
process in its entirety.

<F P=106> [Interview with King Husayn by unidentified Japanese NHK </F>
television correspondent in Amman on 13 April -- recorded, in 
English] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] Your Majesty, first of all, I would 
like to express my heartful gratitude for giving me this kind 
opportunity of receiving me today. 
  [Husayn] It is a pleasure, sir. 
  [Correspondent] The time is limited, sir, so let me start. 
First of all, I would like to focus on the peace. As you see, 
today is the deadline for Israeli forces withdrawal, and it is 
not met, after all. What is your feeling at this moment? 
  [Husayn] I am worried and concerned that, unfortunately, the 
hopes of so many people on either side of the divide are 
suffering a setback in terms of the delays and the lack of 
progress in implementing agreements and in dealing with the 
problem as a whole, comprehensively, on all the tracks that are 
there to be dealt with. 
  [Correspondent] Would you give me some general comment on 
the 
peace process itself? 
  [Husayn] It is so very, very important, sir. It is the 
difference between disaster overtaking this area and the rest of 
the world, and the future that we seek to give future 
generations from both sides of the divide; to live in peace and 
in security, and in an entirely different region characterized 
by peace and cooperation, a peace based on justice, a peace that 
future generations can live with and protect. And if this 
chance is lost, I really don't know what would happen, except 
disaster. So, we will be slipping towards it very, very 
rapidly. So, something has to be done. Everyone has to 
realize their responsibilities and move much more with 
determination to achieve it as soon as possible. 
  [Correspondent] How do you assess the possibility of this 
peace process and the Declaration of Principles? Can you become 
optimistic? 
  [Husayn] I have faith and a feeling that those in positions 
of responsibility, wherever they are, must respond to the 
genuine desire of the overwhelming majority of people in this 
region; to see it live a life worthy of it and worthy of its 
people in conditions of peace and security, and I hope that this 
will compel us to realize that we cannot waste more time, and 
that the Palestinian problem has to be addressed in terms of 
Palestinian rights on Palestinian soil, but also there has to be 
real, genuine progress on all tracks to achieve a comprehensive 
peace. It has been suggested, at times here, for example, that 
we should ratify a piece of paper, then negotiate its contents. 
I would believe that this is not the right approach. The right 
approach is to negotiate seriously about every matter that has 
been outlined in an agenda that we ratified in support of the 
Palestinian stand, in terms of Palestinian rights, following 
their agreement with the Government of Israel in Washington, and 
which is now there, but without much movement. We have to move 
to reach agreement on every point so that the crowning 
achievement is a state of peace and a peace treaty. [words 
indistinct] 
  [Correspondent] Well, I'd like to pick up Jordan-Israel 
track. What kind of stage is it on now? 
  [Husayn] Some movement, but nothing as serious as we would 
wish it to be, as yet. There are areas, sir, that concern 
occupied territories and these have to be addressed very, very 
rapidly. We have to know that we have arrived at a satisfactory 
conclusion in regard to defining, delineating, and demarcating 
these borders. These negotiations, to do so, could be held even 
in the region that is affected directly, and the question of 
water is an important issue to realize what the share of each 
participant is going to be, and beyond that, we want to create 
the conditions, sir, for the world to come out and help us when 
we can present a state of peace to the world. So, if those who 
are able can join us in doing everything possible to effect a 
change of the quality of life here, but also to be our partners 
in ventures that could not come to being except in a state of 
peace, ventures that would be mutually beneficial to us and to 
all those who partake in rebuilding this entire region in a 
state of peace. [sentence as heard] 
  [Correspondent] Well, about the relationship with Iraq. I 
think Jordan changed its favorable stands toward Iraqi President 
Saddam Husayn to not so favorable stands. Is it true? 
  [Husayn] Sir, the unfortunate result of all our efforts 
before the Gulf war and during the Gulf crisis was failure, 
failure to prevent the war, failure to reverse the occupation of 
Kuwait peacefully, and I believe that our concerns were 
legitimate and our motives were honorable; to try to, within the 
Arab context, achieve a withdrawal by the Iraqis from Kuwait and 
the resolution of the problem peacefully and to avoid the wounds 
that have been created since, which have affected many, many 
people and will continue to affect them for a long period of 
time. Unfortunately, my efforts with both sides to that 
confrontation failed. But, as far as the Iraqi people are 
concerned, I am worried and concerned with their continued 
suffering in a manner that cannot be accepted. 
  [Correspondent] Recently, I've heard that Jordan said that 
unless the United Nations lift the blockade of al-'Aqabah, 
Jordan will not return to the peace process. Is it true? 
  [Husayn] We have said that any further moves will be 
contingent on resolving this problem because we would like to 
know who is causing it. We would like to know under what 
authority, and for what purpose. If we have moved to enable the 
peace process to make all the achievement that was possible 
until now, including going to Madrid and providing the 
Palestinians an opportunity to engage in and try to resolve 
their problems with Israel, directly following the Rabat summit 
decision that the PLO is the sole legitimate representative of 
the people of Palestine. We did all that not because of 
pressure, not because of intimidation. We did that because of 
conviction. So, we see no reason for Jordan's treatment in the 
way it has been over the years that have passed, in regard to 
al-'Aqabah and freedom of navigation and shipping to al-'Aqabah 
and from it. So, things have reached a point where the 
situation is intolerable and we try to rectify it and to point 
out to the world that if it is pressure, we do not succumb to 
pressure. If we moved on the peace process, we moved because we 
have always been dedicated to the cause of peace. If it is 
Security Council resolutions as they affect Iraq, we have 
implemented them, although we are deeply worried and deeply 
concerned about the people of Iraq, suffering as they have, so 
far. So, this problem cannot continue the way it is, 
indefinitely. 
  [Correspondent] Would you give a brief comment on the role 
of 
Japan in this region and on the peace process? 
  [Husayn] The role of Japan is very much appreciated, sir. We 
are friends and have been over a long period of time, and the 
friendship has grown. The cooperation has grown between us. 
Japan is very important to us. It is an example. It is, at 
the same time, a major power in the world and I hope very, very 
much indeed, that its role will be constructive one in the times 
ahead, and that we will also be able to provide the 
opportunities in a context of peace for Japan to play a major 
role as a partner in reshaping the future in this region and 
addressing the area in terms of the requirements for peace as 
they affect the people in the times ahead. 
  [Correspondent] Thank you very much.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "King Husayn Rejects U.S. Offer To </F>
Carry Out Inspection Inside al-'Aqabah Port"] 
  [Text] Amman, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Well-informed Jordanian 
sources confirmed yesterday that the Jordanian monarch, King 
Husayn, has rejected a clause stipulating setting up a U.S. 
inspection position inside al-'Aqabah Port, because that impairs 
Jordanian sovereignty and provokes the Jordanians' feelings. 
  The sources said that U.S.-Jordanian contacts over the past 
few days resulted in an initial agreement containing a number of 
points on arrangements in Jordanian territorial waters and 
inside al-'Aqabah Port. Their aim is to ascertain Jordan's 
compliance with the Security Council resolutions concerning the 
economic embargo imposed on Iraq. 
  The sources added that the point that angered the Jordanian 
monarch is the proposal that U.S. soldiers and observers be 
allowed to inspect containers inside the port. 
  Early in the week reports said that an agreement had been 
reached between Washington and Amman to ease the al-'Aqabah Port 
blockade. 
  Meanwhile, a Jordanian Foreign Ministry source has ruled out 
a visit to the region at the end of the month by U.S. Secretary 
of State Warren Christopher, despite the official U.S. 
announcement of the date of the visit. 
  The source told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the delay in signing 
an Israeli-Palestinian agreement on arrangements for withdrawal 
from Gaza and Jericho is bound to change the date and program of 
the anticipated visit. The U.S. secretary was expected to 
attend the signing ceremony in Cairo, that is in addition to a 
number of European foreign ministers. 
  The Jordanian sources said that the continuation of the 
al-'Aqabah blockade is the result of Jordan's repeated rejection 
of the U.S.-Israeli pressures -- which have reached the point of 
going beyond diplomatic behavior -- designed to force Jordan to 
hasten to sign a separate peace agreement with Israel, as they 
are not content with the signing of the agenda. 
  The sources added that whenever the course of the 
negotiations with the Palestinians in Cairo and Paris becomes 
complicated and the signing of the principles agreement, which 
was expected to take place on 20 April, is delayed, more 
pressure is exerted on Jordan by every possible means to push it 
toward signing a peace agreement.

  [Text] AKHBAR AL-USBU' has learned that Jordan will shortly 
make large-scale political moves, to be spearheaded by His 
Majesty King Husayn, to explain Jordan's position toward the 
international embargo imposed against the Port of al-'Aqabah and 
Iraq. Jordan's drive aims to enlighten the world community 
about the need to apply pressures to end this embargo, which is 
harmful to both Jordan and Iraq, particularly since the outlets 
of the countries neighboring Iraq are wide open to trade with 
Iraq, whereas only Jordan is besieged in this regard. Jordan is 
next only to Iraq in terms of the harm caused by this embargo. 
  Responsible Jordanian sources said that the Jordanian moves 
will take the form of royal visits abroad, the dispatch of 
envoys carrying royal messages abroad, as well as extensive 
diplomatic efforts on the international scene to be led by 
Jordanian Embassies abroad. 
  The Jordanian campaign aims to end the blockade clamped on 
the Port of al-'Aqabah and the embargo imposed on the Iraqi 
people. Lately, Jordanian-Iraqi contacts have been activated. 
Iraqi Culture and Information Minister Hamid Yusuf Hammadi, who 
is currently visiting Jordan, has relayed a message from 
President Saddam to His Majesty King Husayn. Meanwhile, Deputy 
Prime Minister Dr. Sa'id al-Tall is visiting Baghdad, where he 
has met with several Iraqi officials.

<F P=106> [Nidal Mansur report: "This Is What the United States Wants </F>
From Jordan: Jordanian-Israeli Declaration of Principles, 
Normalization, End of Boycott of Israel"] 
  [Text] Politicians were initially optimistic that the 
al-'Aqabah siege would be lifted following official Jordanian 
protests and his majesty's announcement that Jordan would 
suspend its participation in the peace talks unless the siege 
was lifted. 
  But, days have gone by without any clear progress. To the 
contrary, economic personalities and merchants have told SHIHAN 
that the U.S. Navy has continued to tighten the noose on 
al-'Aqabah, indicating, as some Jordanian politicians say, that 
the al-'Aqabah blockade has no connection with the Gulf crisis 
and the rumored leaking of goods into Iraq from Jordan, and that 
the blockade is a systematic U.S. policy to compel Jordan to 
meet demands connected in a basic way with the peace process 
with Israel. 
  Clearly, the Jordanian leadership immediately understood the 
U.S. message, prompting the king to link the al-'Aqabah blockade 
with the peace process. 
  Well-informed government sources say Jordan will place the 
al- 'Aqabah issue at the top of the agenda of any talks with the 
Americans. 
  This information coincides with reports of U.S. Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher's approaching visit to the region in 
the next few weeks. Western diplomats believe that if the 
United States wants to continue to pressure Jordan without 
offering it a clear picture, Jordan will not be part of 
Christopher's coming tour. 
  Jordanian officials are bewildered by the U.S. stand and are 
wondering what the United States is demanding of Jordan. 
  It is certain that these demands are clearly linked with the 
peace process. Political observers indicate that the United 
States wants the following from Jordan: 
  1. An Israeli-Jordanian declaration of principles similar to 
the PLO-Israel Oslo agreement; 
  2. A clear Jordanian role in ending the Arab boycott of 
Israel; 
  3. An effective and primary Jordanian role in normalizing 
ties with Israel, such as the economic conference that was 
scheduled to convene in Jordan, with Shim'on Peres 
participating, and which the government demanded be postponed. 
  A minister who preferred anonymity told SHIHAN that while 
Jordan had known about these demands since the start of its 
participation in the peace process, it is difficult for Jordan 
to meet these demands in the way the United States wants, 
especially since it is governed by local and regional formulas 
making it revolve in a fixed orbit, calculating its slightest 
moves with extreme care. 
  Perhaps the more dangerous issue for Jordan, which prevents 
it from quickly responding to the U.S. desire, is that it does 
not know the price it is going to pay in return for these offers. 
  Until now, the United States has not told Jordan that the 
al-'Aqabah blockade will be lifted in return. Therefore, 
Jordanian officials are not reassured about the U.S. position. 
They say indignantly that since the beginning of the peace 
talks, the United States has not offered enough in terms of 
economic assistance and aide to Jordan, which is suffering a 
crisis after its boycott by the Gulf states. The United States 
has continued to monitor this Gulf boycott of Jordan, especially 
the Saudi veto against Jordan. The U.S. silence may have 
increased the Gulf's intransigent attitude. 
  America's ambiguity is one reason why Jordan is not rushing 
into hasty action. However, there are no less compelling 
reasons from Jordan's standpoint. 
  Jordan cannot afford to break ranks with fellow Arabs the 
way 
the PLO did when it signed the Oslo accord. There is the 
constraint of its relations with Syria. Jordan cannot proceed 
without the Syrians, unless the Americans provide sufficient 
guarantees to protect it regionally. 
  In the wake of the Oslo accord, it seems that history has 
come into play, with Jordan seeking cover under the Syrian 
option. Syria, for its part, cannot afford to let Lebanon or 
Jordan go it alone, and so be left high and dry. 
  By not accommodating America's requirements, Jordan is not 
being inhibited by purely regional calculations; given its 
internal politics, Jordan cannot afford to take a short cut. 
  With the institution of democracy in Jordan, the regime has 
been made stronger and political opposition has been given 
greater elbowroom and the ability to pester the government. Any 
action toward normalizing relations with or ending the economic 
boycott of Israel will not be easy to sell to the Jordanian 
public. For the government to undertake such moves, it will 
have either to secure a regional cover, or tame internal 
opposition. 
  With such givens, Jordan seems to be walking a tight rope. 
It is in the position of someone who has travelled half the 
distance and seems to be unable to go backward. Neither can it 
proceed forward without having to make real sacrifices. 
  There seems to be more than one school of thought in Jordan 
on how to proceed. 
  His majesty the king is known to be disinclined to adventure 
and gambling. He favors a more cautious approach to local and 
regional developments, even if that means the noose being 
tightened around Jordan. 
  However, political observers argue that Prime Minister 
'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali, having led the negotiating team with 
Israel, seems to be more inclined to breaking the deadlock. 
Al-Majali is thought to believe the "taboos" complex that 
Jordan resolved by joining the peace negotiations should not act 
to inhibit its movement. 
  Obviously, the king's line of balancing acts and keeping his 
lines open in all directions has not gone down well with the 
U.S. Administration, according to Western diplomats. Citing 
examples that inconvenienced the Americans and clouded relations 
with Washington, the diplomats point to Jordan's coordination 
with Syria. They also cite Jordan's failure to suppress 
Palestinian opposition, namely Hamas, the Islamic resistance 
movement, headquartered in Amman, and Jordan's flexibility 
toward its own Islamists. 
  Jordan is now facing difficult options. 
  It wants to reconcile its regional calculations and future 
interests, an argument observers cite while speculating that the 
king may dismiss the present government and bring in a new prime 
minister who would be prepared to cope with regional 
developments and pressures without worrying too much about the 
consequences.

<F P=106> [Report by JORDAN TIMES staff reporter Nirmin Murad] </F>
  [Text] Amman--The Government Wednesday [13 April] said it 
had sound and convincing reasons for detaining 10 Islamists 
being investigated for membership of an illegal group believed 
to be planning "terrorist acts." 
  Islamic Action Front (IAF) deputies took the case of these 
and other Islamists detained on security-related cases to Prime 
Minister 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali earlier this week and later 
circulated their memorandum to the premier for publication in 
local newspapers. 
  Information Minister Jawad al-'Anani said the IAF should 
have 
waited to "hear the other side of the story" before releasing 
their memorandum in the press. 
  Dr al-'Anani, in an interview with the Jordan Times, said 
that Dr. al-Majali, who met with a delegation of the IAF 
deputies Monday evening, "told them that arrests are not made 
indiscriminately and that there were good reasons for the 
detentions." 
  "The premier told them that we respect their request to 
study 
the issue but that since each story has two sides the premier 
was going to investigate their charges and bring back the other 
side of the story to them" Dr. al-'Anani said. 
  In their memorandum to the prime minister, the IAF deputies 
listed names of 72 detainees, including the 10 arrested in 
connection with an illegal group, and quoted relatives of some 
of the detainees with claims of mistreatment. 
  All of the arrests, as specified in the list provided by the 
IAF, have been made since the beginning of this year. 
  Ten people have been recently arrested for what security 
sources said was establishing a "group planning terrorist 
activities." The sources, quoted by the AL-RA'Y Arabic daily 
Wednesday, said the group had "islamist ties" and was planning a 
series of armed robberies of shops, taxis and at a later stage 
banking institutions to collect funds for weapons. 
  The security sources said the group was headed by a 38-year 
old man whom it did not name. 
  Amman Deputy Hamzah Mansur, the spokesman for the IAF's 
parliamentary bloc, told the Jordan Times that their meeting 
with the premier dealt with the detention of about 70 people on 
charges of belonging to groups to destablise the Kingdom's 
security or carry out terrorist attacks. 
  However, informed sources maintain that the conversation 
mainly dealt with the detention of these last 10 Islamists. Mr. 
Mansur said that the Monday meeting came after several similar 
meetings with the prime minister over the detention of illegal 
Islamist groups. 
  Asked why the IAF deputies decided to publicise this meeting 
with the prime minister and not the ones before, Mr. Mansur 
said: "We had received promises of quick releases and ensuring 
humane and good treatment of the detainees." 
  But, he added, they went to see the prime minister "because 
we felt that the issue still stands." 
  In a copy of a memorandum released Wednesday, the IAF asked 
the premier to interject on behalf of 72 detainees in Jordanian 
prisons and ensure that they receive treatment compatible with 
accepted human rights standards. 
  The deputies said that while they did not condone the 
actions 
of the detainees they wanted to "protect the dignity and 
freedoms of citizens as guranteed by the Islamic Sharia and our 
constitution." 
  Mr. Mansur, in his telephone interivew with the Jordan 
times, 
said that the delegation also wanted the government to release 
the detainees when investigations indicate that they were not 
party to any illegal activity. 
  The IAF delegation which met with Dr. al-Majali was composed 
of Mr. Masur, Amman Deputy Ibrahim Kaylani, Irbid Deputy 
'Abd-al-Rahim al-'Ukur, Amman Deputy Hammam Sa'id, al-Balqa' 
Deputy Muhammad 'Uwaydah and al-Karak Deputy Ahmad al-Kasasibah. 
  "The delegation briefed the prime minister on the wave 
arrests of citizens at this time and what accompanied these 
arrests in practices that do not tally with citizens' freedoms 
and rights as guaranteed by the Islamic Sharia and our 
constitution," the IAF said in a statement Wednesday. 
  "The prime minister promised to study the memorandum and 
deal 
with it positively stressing that he will endeavour to apply the 
law and protect the diegnity of citizens," it said. 
  In their letter to the prime minister, the IAF deputies 
appeared to concentrate their defence on former Afghan fighters 
who were arrested after security forces connected some of them 
to a series of bomb blasts in third-class cinemas in Amman and 
al-Zarqa. 
  "Jordan has never lived for itself alone but strove to serve 
the nation and higher causes... from this vision some of our 
young men flew to Pakistan and Afghanistan when that Islamic 
nation fell under Soviet occupation and their deed was 
compatible with the wishes of their people, government," the IAF 
deputies said in their memorandum to the prime minister. 
  "People like these should under no circumstances be accused 
unless we want to also accuse the Jordanians who answered the 
call of duty in Palestine, Iraq, Tunisia, Syria, Egypt, and 
others," the memo added. 
  "We refuse that contributing to help others of our faith in 
Afghanistan be considered a crime," the memo concluded. 
  The IAF deputies also criticized what they said was a wave 
of 
arrests of university students. They also said that there were 
"regretful events in the University of Jordan from parties known 
to the security forces aimed to influence the students." 
  The deputies were particularly careful in their criticism of 
the arrest of persons connected to bomb blasts and bombing 
attempts. While condemning "any act which targets any 
institution on the land of our country and any attempt to 
destabilise the atmosphere in the country and hope that those 
involved in these kind of acts would be referred to court," the 
memorandum said, the IAF "also believes that a defendant remains 
innocent and should exercise his right to defend himself until 
proven guilty." 
  The IAF deputies also criticised the crackdown on members of 
the Fatah Revolutionary Council (Abu-Nidal) group after their 
group was connected to the gunning down of Jordanian diplomat 
Na'ib al-Ma'ayitah in Beirut in January. 
  "While we condemn this ugly crime against a faithful son of 
Jordan we condemn the indiscriminate arrests," the memorandum 
said. 
  Dr. al-'Anani said that the prime minister had listened to 
the IAF's arguments and impressed on them that he believed there 
were "sound and convincing reasons" for the detentions. 
  "But in light of the fact that they had come asking him to 
look into the case and the charges of the relatives, the primier 
said that he was going to check their claims and come back to 
them with his findings," Dr. al-'Anani said. 
  Dr. al-Majali, the information minister said, also told the 
IAF deputies that "he will make sure that justice takes its 
course."

  [Text] Amman--AKHIR KHABAR--It has been reported that some 
Iraqi opposition members met in Amman in March. Husayn 
al-Hakim, an Iraqi opposition leader, took part in that meeting. 
  AKHIR KHABAR has noticed that reports of that meeting were 
leaked at a time coinciding with the visit of Dr. Sa'id al-Tall, 
Jordanian deputy prime minister and minister of higher 
education, to Baghdad to brief the Iraqi brothers on the latest 
developments in the siege imposed on Iraq and al-'Aqabah. 
  The reports came on the heels of a successful recent visit 
to 
Baghdad by a Jordanian parliamentary delegation. Informed 
sources said the Iraqi leadership welcomed the delegation's 
proposal that multilateral parliamentary delegations should 
visit the big powers in order to support the Iraqi position on 
the blockade. The Iraqi National Assembly (parliament) has 
issued a statement praising Jordan's stand on the official and 
popular levels.

  [Text] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
chairman of the Presidential Council, today received Hamid Yusuf 
Hammadi, Iraqi minister of culture and information and envoy of 
Iraqi President Saddam Husayn. 
  Hammadi conveyed to the brother Presidential Council 
chairman 
a message from his brother President Saddam Husayn dealing with 
the fraternal bilateral relations and issues of interest to our 
Arab nation. The message also dealt with the suffering of the 
sisterly Iraqi people as a result of the economic blockade 
imposed on Iraq, which requires a pan-Arab position to mitigate 
this hard human suffering of the Iraqi children, youths, and old 
people due to the continued blockade, especially since Iraq has 
stressed its commitment to all UN resolutions, led by Resolution 
687. 
  The brother chairman expressed our Yemeni people's 
solidarity 
with the fraternal Iraqi people's suffering as a result of the 
blockade. He asked the Iraqi culture and information ministers 
to convey his greetings to his brother President Saddam Husayn 
and his wishes of further progress and prosperity for the Iraqi 
people. 
  The meeting was attended by Information Minister brother 
Hasan Ahmad al-Lawzi and Dr. Muhsin Khalil, Iraqi ambassador to 
our country.

<F P=106> [Interview with Salim Salih Muhammad, member of the Yemeni </F>
Presidential Council and assistant secretary general of the YSP, 
by 'Abdallah al-Yamani; place and date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Al-Yamani] You have announced in the past that 
you were being hunted by Sanaa. Do you still have that feeling 
or has anything emerged from the accord document? 
  [Muhammad] Of course. The forces and elements that carried 
out bombings and assassinations are still free and unbridled. 
They are still tampering with the safety of the citizens. Our 
elements are being killed in Ta'izz, Sanaa, and some northern 
governorates. 
  [Al-Yamani] How do the Yemeni people regard the delay in 
implementing the document? 
  [Muhammad] The people are greatly worried because of the 
military conditions and tension and because of the security 
problems that have not been solved yet. The economic life has 
been paralyzed. Work at development projects and elsewhere is 
at a standstill. Frankly, the conditions are unsatisfactory to 
all. 
  [Al-Yamani] What are the causes of the armed confrontation? 
  [Muhammad] The other side's intransigence and the 
influential 
forces that do not want any satisfactory solution for Yemen. 
This intransigence and this mentality has harmed Yemen, the 
Yemeni unity, and the supreme interests of the Yemeni people. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Al-Yamani] It is rumored that the Jordanian-Omani role in 
pursuing efforts to implement the accord document has been 
abandoned now that other Arab sides have entered the arena. 
What do you say to that? 
  [Muhammad] The role of these countries has not been 
abandoned 
but there is an intensive Arab presence and the Arab brothers 
are asked to continue this effort because Yemen is part of the 
Arab homeland and Yemen's problems are the problems of the Arab 
nation. Helping us is a pan-Arab responsibility and it is the 
duty of all the Arab brothers to extricate Yemen from this 
crisis which threatens its democratic, unionist march. 
  [Al-Yamani] Will the resignation of the president solve the 
Yemeni crisis? 
  [Muhammad] The question is not under discussion now. We have 
not proposed the resignation yet. No political group has 
proposed this because we are looking for common denominators 
now. These things could be discussed when such thing happens.

<F P=106> [Interview with Salim Salih Muhammad, member of the Yemeni </F>
Presidential Council and assistant secretary general of the YSP, 
by Taghrid Sa'adah; place and date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Sa'adah] What is the first item on your 
agenda during your visit to Jordan? Do you have new proposals, 
especially after the failure of the Salalah meeting? 
  [Muhammad] Our visit to Jordan is meant to meet with His 
Majesty King Husayn to brief him on the latest developments in 
the Yemeni arena. We also want Jordan to continue its role in 
the military committees and in the dialogue with the political 
leaders, since Jordan hosted a Yemeni meeting and helped to 
endorse the accord document in Amman in the presence of all 
Yemeni parties. This obliges Yemen to brief Jordan's king, 
government, and people on these developments. The visit is also 
part of the Arab tour we have made, particularly after the 
Salalah meeting between the president and his deputy. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Sa'adah] The Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] is making shuttle 
tours to Arab capitals. For what purpose and what proposals do 
you have? 
  [Muhammad] Any party that achieves unity cannot be seeking 
disunity once again. However, we are now facing a process in 
which unity and democracy are being buried through the 
annexation, and ending the existing status, of southeastern 
regions. The YSP is therefore concerned with rectifying the 
domestic and foreign situation of the unity state. The YSP's 
contacts with its brothers and friends abroad is meant to ensure 
that Yemen will continue to play its natural role, along with 
its Arab brothers and friends abroad, away from the atmosphere 
of domestic problems and the results of the Gulf war. This is 
as far as its responsibility as a partner in government is 
concerned. As for its responsibility as a party, the YSP is 
still responsible for part of the Yemeni homeland. The YSP has 
domestic and foreign contacts and no one can deny or bar this. 
This is a right for others as well -- the General People's 
Congress, the Yemeni Reform Grouping, and others. They all 
travel on visits and have contacts. The tour of 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid adopted a specific formula. We are for national dialogue 
and the document which met 70 percent of our demands. We did 
not propose any view in our tour. However, we had in mind the 
military developments in Yemen, outlined in a report by the 
joint Jordanian-Omani military committee which also proposed 
solutions to this crisis, as well as the fact that we know and 
others know that the other parties do not want to, and cannot, 
implement the accord document. Therefore, we are only asking 
the Arab brothers to contribute toward solving this problem, 
since we are part of this nation. [passage omitted] 
  [Sa'adah] Why did 'Ali Salim al-Bid visit Saudi Arabia after 
signing the document in Amman? 
  [Muhammad] The visit was meant to explain the YSP's position 
to Saudi officials, after the other party had foiled the Amman 
meeting and after it had exploded the military situation in 
Abyan, in cooperation with the Islamic Jihad group. This was 
also after we made sure that the other party does not want to 
implement the accord, considering the conditions he set when he 
signed it. This prompted us to explain our position to besiege 
any military adventure that any party could think of. Yemeni 
stability is part of the stability of this region. Our region 
is rich in resources and the world cares about these resources. 
What happened during the Gulf war confirms this fact and that 
any party that disrupts security and stability will not be 
allowed to do that. [passage omitted] 
  [Sa'adah] It is being said now that oil is one of the 
reasons for the current crisis and that it is behind your desire 
to establish a federation. President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih said 
that you are seeking to be an oil country. What is your comment? 
  [Muhammad] Oil was a catalyst for unity in the first place 
because it existed before the unity. Our regions contain oil 
and we know how much they contain. Therefore, we expedited our 
efforts for unity. However, the way some people think indicates 
they had contemplated annexing the southern regions on this 
basis.

  [Text] The Israeli enemy forces and their agent militias 
stepped up the security situation in the south this evening. 
Using their large-caliber artillery, as of 1915 they shelled 
the city of Sidon with violent and concentrated fire. The 
NATIONAL NEWS AGENCY correspondent there reported that the 
shelling concentrated on Dalla'ah Street, the area around the 
town hall, and the eastern boulevard of the city. This led to 
various injuries among the people. A large fire also started as 
a result of the shelling near the Ghassan Hammud Hospital. In 
addition, al-Qurn al-'Arabi square and the Hayy al-Khabbaz areas 
came under violent and concentrated shelling at around 1930. We 
have received reports about many dead and injured. Among the 
dead are 'Adnan al-Susi and among the injured Ibrahim al-Susi. 
There were also some members from the al-Buji and al-Naquzi 
families among the injured. A military source in the Lebanese 
Army has reported that its artillery is shelling the locations 
of the enemy artillery inside the occupied strip, in response to 
the shelling Sidon has been coming under this evening. The 
various brigades and Army units in the area have been placed in 
a state of alert. 
  Ladies and gentlemen, we now have with us colleague Talal 
al-'Abdallah from the editorial desk at the radio news office. 
Hello, Talal. 
  [Begin al-'Abdallah recording] Hello, Joseph. In the latest 
dispatch from the NATIONAL NEWS AGENCY correspondent in the 
south, and in particular from Sidon, he said that the shelling 
abated at around 2130 and that the semi-final toll of this 
treacherous attack is as follows: Some of the martyrs are 
'Adnan al-Susi, Muhammad Mahmud Jirad, and a two-year old baby. 
At Hammud Hospital, the injured are Ahmad Jirdi, Amin al-Baba, 
Ibrahim Bawji, Mahmud 'Abd- al-Ghani, Muhammad al-Krambli, and 
Fawzi al-Sayigh. Also in Abu Dahr Hospital, some of the injured 
are First Warrant Officer Muhammad al-Hajj. In Dalla'ah 
Hospital, the injured are Ahmad Hallaq and Ahmad Muhiyyah. 
  On the other hand, what is called the Voice of the South 
admitted a short while ago that three members of the South 
Lebanese Army died when an explosive device blew up (?in their 
vehicle). [end recording]

  [Text] The villages of Qabrikha, Majdal Silm, Tulin, and 
al-Suwwanah came under a concentrated Israel artillery barrage 
this morning. The shelling continued intermittently at the rate 
of one round per minute until 0500 today, prompting residents 
inhabitants to seek protection in shelters and the innermost 
rooms of their homes. The bombardment was accompanied by 
intensive overflights by Israeli helicopters, which fired flares 
and raked the area. Retaliating for the continuing enemy acts of 
aggression, which left three dead and dozens wounded in Sidon, 
resistance groups shelled several Israeli settlements, 
concentrating on the Galilee panhandle. The enemy admitted that 
rockets landed in the area but denied any casualties. 
  The Israeli enemy sent in many vehicles and reinforcements, 
which were spotted traveling along the international highway 
near Tallat al-'Abbad. These reinforcements have deployed in 
the al-Tayyibah- al-Qantarah-'Alman triangle.

  [Text] The foreign minister, Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali, says 
supply of F-16 aircraft by the United States to Pakistan cannot 
be linked with its peaceful nuclear program. In an interview 
with BBC, he said the supply of the aircraft is a commercial 
commitment of the American Administration, for which Pakistan 
has already made payments. As for the American proposals 
relating to nuclear nonproliferation presented both to Pakistan 
and India, he said multilateral aspect of these proposals is 
quite interesting. Pakistan has agreed to move forward with some 
amendment in these proposals. He said we need to know about the 
American Administration's mind on the issue. The foreign 
minister said there is now a definite change in the thinking of 
the American Administration which is now prepared to look at 
Pakistan's position more reasonably. If this kind of confidence 
continues to develop, they would find answers to their problems 
without compromising their principles.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "F-16's -- Money or Aircraft; No Third Option, </F>
Nor Nuclear Deal Acceptable"] 
  [Text] Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto stated in a news 
conference that Pakistan will not open its nuclear installations 
unilaterally to international inspection nor will it roll back 
its nuclear program. As far as the F-16 aircraft are concerned, 
they cannot be linked with the nuclear program. The United 
States should either hand over the aircraft to Pakistan or 
return the payment made for their delivery. The prime minister 
has forgotten about compensation. The payment should be 
collected along with compensation. One day prior to the arrival 
of the U.S. delegation to Pakistan, the prime minister precisely 
explained the country's stand on the nuclear program and also 
took efforts to dispel the doubts and apprehensions that the 
government would succumb to U.S. pressure or that the nuclear 
program would be rolled back or frozen and would be subjected to 
international inspection. Although the prime minister said this 
after getting a green signal from General Waheed, may God make 
her stick to her words and not succumb to any counsel on the 
question of the country's security and stability. In principle, 
the F-16 aircraft transaction has nothing to do with the nuclear 
program. Pakistan struck a deal with a U.S. firm for the 
purchase of more than 70 F-16 aircraft purely on a commercial 
basis and in the meantime had paid in installments an amount of 
$700 million, which is equivalent to the cost of 38 aircraft. 
The United States should fulfill its obligations in this direct 
commercial transaction and should not set a despicable example 
for dishonesty, breach of promise, and unethical business 
practices in international commercial dealings although earlier, 
it had committed such a practice in the Arshad Parvez case. If 
the pro-Indian and pro-Israeli lobby does not want to see 
Pakistan become strong, the United States should face this lobby 
with confidence and not kneel before it and involve it in the 
conspiracy to weaken the security of Pakistan. It is 
regrettable that influenced by the propaganda of this lobby, the 
United States Government has been persistently refusing to hand 
over the F-16 aircraft; and now, the latest case is that if 
Pakistan wants to get F-16's, it should roll back its nuclear 
program and should subject it to international inspection in 
order to get ratification for the level of its capping. 
  U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott has arrived in 
Islamabad by passing through New Delhi and as per international 
media analysis, this visit is a ploy to exert pressure on 
Pakistan although Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto had stated that 
Pakistan would not come under any pressure and would not accept 
any conditions unilaterally. Prior to this, Army Chief Abdul 
Waheed also voiced the same feeling. We, however, are of the 
opinion that the mere precondition "unilaterally" is not enough 
now and even at the regional level, Pakistan should not 
compromise. Even if India accepts the conditions of the NPT 
[Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty] (the chances for which are 
remote), its military superiority over Pakistan will be intact. 
Besides making a nuclear bomb, India has amassed a heap of 
missiles and acquired a huge quantity of weapons; in 
conventional weapons it also is better off than Pakistan. 
Therefore, as long as India's wings of aggression are not 
clipped and a cut is not imposed on its armed forces, defense 
allocation, and stockpile of arms under a collective and 
comprehensive package, there will always be the threat of a war 
being waged by India. Pakistan now should insist on the 
introduction of some sort of a collective and comprehensive 
package first, which does not put the balance of power in favor 
of India. Otherwise, Pakistan cannot sacrifice its defense 
capabilities. It is a blessing that the U.S. officials have 
revealed that Pakistan is capable of producing an atom bomb 
within minutes or seconds. There cannot be any other good news 
and a matter of satisfaction to the Pakistani people than this. 
So far, responsible institutions in Pakistan have declined to 
say anything to the people about this. Now, Pakistan can in no 
way forego this invaluable possession. It is imperative that 
the U.S. delegation should be given this impression and sent 
away from Pakistan.

  [Excerpts] The president, Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari, has 
said Pakistan is fully conscious of its geographical and 
geostrategic sensitivities and the role it has to play in the 
newly emerging world order. Addressing PMA [Pakistan Military 
Academy] long course passing-out parade in Kakul today, the 
president said we strongly believe in the principle of peaceful 
coexistence and noninterference in the affairs of others. He 
said we have no aggressive designs against anyone and wish to 
live in peace and harmony with all, especially our neighbors. 
The president said, however, we have to maintain high level of 
preparedness to thwart any evil designs that imperil or 
jeopardize Pakistan's integrity. The parade was held in open in 
spite of continuing rain. [passage omitted] 
  Addressing the parade, the president lauded the professional 
capabilities of Pakistan armed forces. 
  [Begin Leghari recording] Let me assure you that the 
Government of Pakistan is fully conscious of our security needs 
and is doing its best to keep the armed forces of the country 
fully prepared to effectively defend the motherland and thwart 
any foreign aggression. Despite the many constraints, 
particularly economic, we shall equip our armed forces with the 
latest technologically advanced weapon systems and knowledge of 
related fields to qualitatively improve their condition so that 
the adverse effect of numerical inferiority can be offset. I am 
confident that our forces will be in a position to face the 
consequences of fast-changing geopolitical and geostrategic 
situation that Pakistan finds itself in. In fact our armed 
forces have already proved their effectiveness, both inside as 
well as outside the country, as part of different UN missions. 
We rightly feel proud of them. [end recording] 
  Cadets from some friendly countries, such as Bahrain, 
Jordan, 
Sri Lanka, and Maldives also got training in the current long 
course.

Iran, Hojjat ol-Eslam 'Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri, has described his 
talks with the Pakistani leaders as very useful and constructive 
with more emphasis on strengthening the role of the ECO 
[Economic Cooperation Organization]. Speaking at a news 
conference in Karachi today before his departure, the Iranian 
speaker expressed complete satisfaction on the talks he held 
with the Pakistani leaders on matters of bilateral interest 
including Kashmir, Bosnia, and the Palestine. He said the two 
sides also discussed the project of constructing a gas pipeline 
from Iran to Pakistan and setting up of an oil refinery in 
Karachi. Hojjat ol-Eslam 'Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri said the two 
countries will shortly exchange delegations for carrying out the 
feasibility for the proposed project. Replying to a question, 
he said the pace of cooperation among the ECO member countries 
would accelerate with the passage of time.

  [Text] Islamabad, April 3: The Federal Government was 
looking out for around 200 Arab nationals whose visas were 
cancelled in January. These Arab nationals were working with 
NGOs [nongovernmental organizations] involved in the welfare and 
rehabilitation of the displaced Afghans. 
  Most of these people, stationed in Peshawar and engaged in 
relief and rehabilitation activities were asked by the 
government to leave the country by Jan 31. However, even after 
the expiry of Jan 31 deadline the government knows nothing about 
their whereabouts. 
  Out of these 200 around 150 are Egyptian nationals, 40 
Tunisians, and 8 from Algeria, says a report prepared by the 
Federal Government. 
  The Egyptian authorities are convinced that the 
assassination 
attempt on President Hosni Mubarak was sponsored by the Egyptian 
dissidents residing in Pakistan. President Mubarak had 
personally conveyed this concern to former Prime Minister, 
Muhammad Nawaz Sharif. The then Pakistani PM had explained that 
his country had nothing to do with the terrorists and would 
extradite the Arab nationals from its soil. 
  "It is presumed that these people had left the country, says 
a high level government official in Islamabad. But to which 
country they have gone the government is not sure. 
  The Government of Pakistan, the officials said, was very 
clear on the subject. Since the Afghan Jehad has ended all the 
foreign nationals involved in the activity must leave the 
country, the official said. 
  "There will be no visa extension for them and those granted 
extensions should consider them void," said the officials. The 
government he said was determined to clear itself of the 
allegations that Pakistan was sponsoring terrorist activities. 
The Pakistani soil would not be allowed for any activities 
against any other state against any other state, he said. 
  Following the cancellation of visas of these Arab nationals, 
several reminders were sent to the NWFP government asking for 
report on the implementation of the federal government's 
directive for the extradition of the Arab nationals. The 
provincial government, however, had so far failed to reply to 
any of these directives. 
  The officials were of the view that the government of 
Pakistan had no desire to keep such people in the country as 
they could be dangerous for the country's security too." 
  However, the Government of Pakistan cannot hand over the 
culprits to the Governments of Algeria, Egypt and Tunisia. 
Pakistan is making efforts to hammer out extradition treaties 
with at least three of the Arab countries including Saudi 
Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Egypt. The signing of the 
treaties will facilitate exchange of criminals. 
  Officials, however, could not confirm that Pakistan, during 
1993, had extradited 3,000 Arab nationals as stated by Federal 
Minister for Law and Parliamentary Affairs, Syed Iqbal Haider.

<F P=106> [Interview with Hocine Ait-Ahmed, leader of Algeria's </F>
Socialist Forces Front, by Jean-Paul Mari; place and date not 
given: "The Third Way Is Our Only Hope"] 
  [Text] [Mari] Is violence continuing to gain ground in 
Algeria? 
  [Ait-Ahmed] Yes, since the interruption of the electoral 
process two years ago, violence has progressively extended to 
most parts of the country. For the last three days, the army 
has surrounded and cut off the town of Larbaa, and there are 
very severe skirmishes. Rockets and artillery are in use 
throughout the region between Bouira, Boumerdes and Blida. On 
the coast, the Delys region has been encircled for three days 
and villages have been shelled. These are no longer police 
operations but real battles. On the Islamic side, they are 
moving away slightly from the strategy of individual attempts 
toward a concentration of veritable army units which are 
springing up everywhere in the country. The GIA (Armed Islamic 
Group) and the MIA (Armed Islamic Movement) are clearly out to 
provoke the collapse of what remains of the state and to get the 
whole population to change sides psychologically. 
  [Mari] One remains stupefied at the level of brutality which 
has now been reached in Algeria. 
  [Ait-Ahmed] The excesses, and the acts of barbarism on both 
sides are... senseless! Algeria is prey to a veritable throat- 
cutting syndrome. It is the result of what I would call a 
"private war." On the one hand, in the name of Algeria and a 
type of nationalistic integrationism, those in power are 
fighting to maintain themselves in power, to preserve their 
privileges and to last. On the other side the Islamists want, 
in the name of God, to take power and monopolize it, just like 
the present regime. 
  [Mari] Are we moving towards civil war? 
  [Ait Ahmed] The ingredients for this civil war are there. 
Violence, popular despair, economic and social conditions, the 
current impasse, and then, in the future, the consequences of 
the plan imposed by the IMF... everything is contributing to 
exacerbating the situation. But let us be clear: we are not as 
far as one part of the population having taken up arms against 
the other; we are not yet in a civil war. Moreover, the 
present situation cannot be reduced to this type of bipolar 
confrontation: army against Islamists. One is condemned to 
understand nothing in Algeria if one forgets a major political 
fact: The population is revolted and powerless, but does not 
want to go on being the hostage of this violence. Whatever the 
efforts of one side or the other, the overwhelming majority of 
Algerians have so far refused to tip into one camp. Since the 
coup d'etat, all attempts by those in power to involve the 
population at its sides have failed. But, just after the first 
round of the elections, hundreds of thousands of people marched 
through the streets of Algiers shouting "No police state, no 
Islamic state!" Today we could add: no civil war. 
  [Mari] Do Algerians today still have a choice between a 
policy of total security [politique du tout-securitaire] and an 
Islamic republic? 
  [Ait-Ahmed] Algerians are retreating in on themselves and on 
their distress. Hoping that both groups realize that they 
cannot win. When we, the FFS (Socialist Forces Front), call for 
political opening, it is to permit this overwhelming majority to 
express itself, and to take its destiny in its own hand. This 
third way represents the only hope for the Algerian people. 
  [Mari] Right now, we hear only the noise of arms and 
declarations of war. Where are the forces of this third way? 
  [Ait-Ahmed] It is not because they are silent that these 
forces do not exist. They do exist! In the administration, the 
trade unions, other associations, in all the parties and even 
inside the army. It is all these forces which I wish to 
address, in order to form a "cross-party" movement, a democratic 
pole. Otherwise, if the total-security-policy disaster 
continues, we will end up with direct negotiations between those 
in power and the integrationists. 
  [Mari] With the danger of a military-Islamic power? 
  [Ait-Ahmed] With, just like in Iran, a power which cares 
nothing for the will of the people. If we are calling for 
openness, it is because we are persuaded that these forces, 
which are in the majority, are able to create a dynamism capable 
of reducing the extremists on both sides to their proper levels 
of importance. 
  [Mari] Can one discuss with the Islamists? And how far can 
one go without opening up the way towards an Islamic republic 
for them? 
  [Ait-Ahmed] One initial and elementary observation: the 
pursuit of total security is the pre-eminent road to bring the 
integrationists to power! For the last two years, we have not 
ceased to strengthen the mechanisms of repression. And what do 
we see? The Islamists are getting stronger. Second 
observation: the dialog is difficult, of course. But it was 
easier two years ago. The best way of avoiding violence was not 
to begin it! Every day which passes, every drop of blood which 
is shed complicates the situation. In the heat of action, we 
increase the amounts at stake. Today the breach is narrow, but 
we have to widen it! 
  [Mari] What must those in power do? 
  [Ait-Ahmed] Open up the political field. Now. 
  [Mari] Legalize the FIS [Islamic Front]? 
  [Ait-Ahmed] Yes! Why not? It is necessary to take 
appeasement measures: freeing political prisoners, ending 
condemnations, torture, closing of the camps in the South... 
  [Mari] Free Ali Belhadj and Abassi Madani? Issue an 
amnesty? 
  [Ait-Ahmed] Yes for Belhadj and Madani. I would not go as 
far as talking of general amnesty. In any event, the country 
needs shock treatment. And not homeopathic treatment. In 
particular if, as the FIS maintains, certain detainees freed 
from the camps have been killed on their return. In short, we 
are not in an appeasement situation. On the contrary, reprisals 
and acts of horror are continuing. On both sides. It is 
important to take concrete measures, and turn the page on 
confrontation. 
  [Mari] This opinion is not shared by the RCD [expansion 
unknown], whose leader has just called for "armed resistance." 
  [Ait-Ahmed] I do not believe it is shared by the Algerian 
people. 
  [Mari] The fact remains that time is short. 
  [Ait-Ahmed] Yes indeed! We are now in a race against the 
clock. There is too much blood. Too much blood! The situation 
can become inextricable. It is a question of months, perhaps 
weeks. 
  [Mari] You are not in Algeria, but in Switzerland. Certain 
people criticize you for this. It is possible to lead a 
political combat today outside the country? 
  [Ait-Ahmed] I am not resolved to be a political exile. But 
staying there after the coup d'etat, Boudiaf's murder, and the 
closing of the democratic arena, was to fall into the hands of 
the regime. Moreover, I am not a Zorro, neither am I a 
dictator. I have a party, a party management which works, and 
with which I am in daily contact. But I am a person who acts 
responsibly. If a "fatal accident" were to happen to me in 
Algeria, what would be the reaction of the part of the 
population which supports me? I do not want to risk that. But 
I assure you that I shall rush back to Algeria at the smallest 
sign of democratization! 
  [Mari] You come originally from Kabylia, where your party 
has a strong presence. For certain people, this region is a 
haven of peace, for others, it is being put to fire and the 
sword. What is the situation in Kabylia? 
  [Ait-Ahmed] Kabylia is first of all a region of Algeria 
which is experiencing all the problems of Algeria. Plus that of 
cultural exclusion. Since 1963, our party has been doing 
everything possible to prevent this political vacuum, which has 
allowed integrationism to gain a foothold elsewhere. Our 
cultural demands are made within the framework of the Algerian 
nation. There is just one nation, the Algerian nation. 
Politically, Kabylia, along with other regions, is supporting 
by all means a national project. The blockages which the 
authorities have placed on political activity is exacerbating 
tensions. And the danger is of either withdrawing into oneself 
or going off course into violence. It is certain that the 
"eradicators" would like to tip this region into their camp, 
just as the integrationists are fully aware of Kabylia's 
importance on the political chessboard. 
  [Mari] And on 20 April, in a week, the anniversary of the 
"Berber spring". 
  [Ait-Ahmed] We will be holding a demonstration, like we did 
last January, but this time at Algiers, again with the same 
theme: demand for cultural recognition and peace. I do not want 
certain people eventually trying to put Kabylia off course into 
a situation of violence, by attempting to distort the Kabyl 
people's democratic opposition to the present regime, 
transforming it into a Kabyl combat against the Islamists. That 
would be extremely serious. I cannot keep silent about the 
consequences of the resulting confrontation. Do not forget that 
there are Kabyls throughout the country. Of course, mountain 
people are full of common sense, with their heads firmly on 
their shoulders. But we are afraid of spectacular provocations. 
It is also to defuse this situation that I am speaking today. 
  [Mari] Can and should France play a role? Or is it 
condemned to keep silent? 
  [Ait-Ahmed] It is clear that Algeria's problems have to be 
settled by Algerians. But the international community cannot 
disinterest itself from the fate of human rights in Algeria. 
Without counting the threat of destabilization throughout the 
Maghreb. No western country can be indifferent to this. What 
shocks and revolts us is that governments have fallen into the 
trap of bipolarization, ignoring the population and democratic 
forces. The fact is that we are there, that we are fighting, and 
that we are carrying the word into the popular quarters, where 
those in power do not even dare set foot. The people, 
democratic forces, need support. 
  [Mari] When one sees how events have accelerated in recent 
years, and observes the gap which is widening, in the last two 
years, at a dizzying pace..., is it not already too late? 
  [Ait-Ahmed] I do not believe in the fatality of the worst. 
Nothing is lost. Algerians are built in such a way -- which is 
something I witnessed immediately after the war of independence 
-- that they can be very hard at the time and, later, forget any 
idea of revenge. Algerians are a generous people. Perhaps too 
the experience of the past two years has made people wiser. The 
"knife-edge"" situation could make us wiser. So that we do not 
fall into civil war.

  [Text] In Algeria the FIS, the Islamic Salvation Front, is 
pleased with the change of prime minister. Rabah Kebir, the FIS 
representative in exile, believes that the replacement of Mr. 
Redha Malek by Mr. Mokdad Sifi -- a relatively unknown 
technocrat -- is a positive act in the framework of the search 
for a negotiated solution. Rabah Kebir also claimed that 
contacts were continuing between Lamine Zeroual, the head of 
state, and the imprisoned FIS leaders. 
  Is this dialogue not likely to be held at the expense of the 
traditional parties? That will mean forgetting the large 
proportion of the people who reject the choice between the Army 
and the fundamentalists, and who also reject civil war. That is 
the opinion of Hocine Ait-Ahmed, the chairman of the Socialist 
Forces Front [FFS], who held a news conference in Paris 
yesterday. Mr. Ait-Ahmed also believes that France is not 
condemning the repression in Algeria strongly enough. His words 
were recorded by Farida Ayari: 
  [Begin Ait-Ahmed recording] I think France has adopted an 
attitude of the least possible criticism with regard to what is 
happening in our country, in particular, as far as repression is 
concerned. We would like it to raise its voice about violations 
of human rights. 
  Then, since Algeria is the keystone of the Maghreb as a 
whole, I do not think anyone will fail to see that the only 
highway the fundamentalists can use to achieve power is to 
continue down the path of repression, and that if Algeria falls 
into the hands of armed groups, the whole of the Maghreb will be 
destabilized, and the security of the Mediterranean as a whole 
will be threatened. [end recording]

  [Text] Marrakesh, Morocco, April 15 (AFP)--Here is the full 
text of the Marrakesh Declaration that is to be adopted by the 
ministerial meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade (GATT) at around 1100 GMT Friday [15 April]: 
  Ministers salute the historic achievement represented by the 
conclusion of the (Uruguay) Round, which they believe will 
strengthen the world economy and lead to more trade, investment, 
employment and income growth throughout the world. In 
particular, they welcome: 
  -- the stronger and clearer legal framework they adopted for 
the conduct of international trade, including a more effective 
and reliable dispute settlement mechanism. 
  -- the global reduction by 40 percent of tariffs and wider 
market-opening agreements on goods, and the increased 
predictability and security represented by a major expansion in 
the scope of tariff commitments, and 
  -- the establishment of a multilateral framework of 
disciplines for trade in services and for the protection of 
trade-related intellectual property rights, as well as the 
reinforced multilateral trade provisions in agriculture and in 
textiles and clothing. 
  Ministers affirm that the establishment of the World Trade 
Organization (WTO) ushers in a new era of global economic 
cooperation, reflecting the widespread desire to operate in a 
fairer and more open multilateral trading system for the benefit 
and welfare of their peoples. 
  Ministers express their determination to resist 
protectionist 
pressures of all kinds. They believe that the trade 
liberalization and strengthened rules achieved in the Uruguay 
Round will lead to a progressively more open world trading 
environment. 
  Ministers undertake, with immediate effect, and until the 
entry into force of the WTO, not to take any trade measures that 
would undermine or adversely affect the results of the Uruguay 
Round negotiations or their implementation. 
  Ministers confirm their resolution to strive for greater 
coherence of policies in the fields of trade, money and finance, 
including cooperation between the WTO, the International 
Monetary Fund and the World Bank for that purpose. 
  Ministers welcome the fact that participation in the Uruguay 
Round was considerably wider than in any previous multilateral 
trade negotiation and, in particular, that developing countries 
played a notably active role in it. 
  This has marked a historic step towards a more balanced and 
integrated global trade partnership. 
  Ministers note that during the period these negotiations 
were 
underway, significant measures of economic reform and autonomous 
trade liberalization were implemented in many developing 
countries and formerly centrally planned economies. 
  Ministers recall that the results of the negotiations embody 
provisions conferring differential and more favourable treatment 
for developing economies, including special attention to the 
particular situation of least-developed countries. 
  Ministers recognize the importance of the implementation of 
these provisions for the least-developed countries and declare 
their intention to continue to assist and facilitate the 
expansion of their trade and investment opportunities. 
  They agree to keep under regular review by the Ministerial 
Conference and the appropriate organs of the WTO the impact of 
the results of the Round on the least-developed countries as 
well as on the net food-importing developing countries, with a 
view to fostering positive measures to enable them to achieve 
their development objectives. 
  Ministers recognize the need for strengthening the 
capability 
of the GATT and the WTO to provide increased technical 
assistance in their areas of competence, and in particular to 
substantially expand its provision to the least-developed 
countries. 
  Ministers declare that their signature of the "Final Act 
Embodying the Results of the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade 
Negotiations" and their adoption of associated Ministerial 
Decisions initiates the transition from the GATT to the WTO. 
  They have in particular established a Preparatory Committee 
to lay the ground for the entry into force of the WTO Agreement 
and commit themselves to see to complete all steps necessary to 
ratify the WTO Agreement so that it can enter into force by 
January 1, 1995, or as early as possible thereafter. 
  Ministers have furthermore adopted a Decision on Trade and 
Environment. 
  Ministers express their sincere gratitude to H.M. King 
Hassan 
II for his personal contribution to the success of this 
Ministerial Meeting and to his government and the people of 
Morocco for their warm hospitality and the excellent 
organization they have provided. 
  The fact that this final Ministerial Meeting of the Uruguay 
Round has been held at Marrakesh is an additional manifestation 
of Morocco's commitment to an open world trading system and to 
its fullest integration into the global economy. 
  With the adoption and signature of the Final Act and the 
opening for acceptance of the WTO Agreement, Ministers declare 
the work of the Trade Negotiations Committee to be complete and 
the Uruguay Round formally concluded.

  [Excerpt] The Sudanese delegation attending the meeting of 
the subcommittee on humanitarian affairs set up by the 
Intergovernmental Authority on Drought and Development [IGADD] 
today issued a statement following the end of the negotiations, 
which were conducted in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi 6-12 April. 
  The statement said that the government delegation had signed 
the draft agreement put forward by Operation Lifeline [Sudan] on 
opening peace corridors to transport relief materials and 
humanitarian aid, which confirmed the agreement of 23 March 
specifying that aid should be transported in a practical and 
secure manner as cheaply as possible. It also laid down that 
the relief aid should be sent to new destinations by air, road, 
river and rail, to ensure that those in need were fed regardless 
of what party controlled the areas in which they were present. 
  The statement said that Operation Lifeline officials and the 
IGADD committee on humanitarian affairs had succeeded in 
arriving at an agreement which would guarantee that those in 
need would receive relief materials and humanitarian aid in the 
combat zones. The statement went on to say that the Sudanese 
Government, by signing the agreement, was merely upholding its 
firm stance of not permitting food to be used as a weapon. The 
government reiterated its determination to arrive at a peaceful 
solution to relieve the suffering of war victims in southern 
Sudan, sufferings which were imposed by the rebellion. 
  The statement expressed the Sudanese Government's hope that 
the other parties also sign the agreement, stressing that the 
government was totally confident that the heads of state of the 
IGADD committee would do everything in their power as mediators 
to persuade the rebel movement to do its duty by signing the 
agreement, because political extremism and obstinacy would 
result in innocent civilians having to bear the consequences.

  [Text] Information Minister Dr. Muhammad Salman yesterday 
evening received a UN Middle East fact-finding mission that 
includes journalists from several nations. 
  The minister spoke about Syria's policy toward the peace 
process. He said: We supported the U.S. initiative because it 
considered the implementation of UN Resolutions 242 and 338 the 
basis for the achievement of a just and comprehensive peace in 
the region. 
  The minister denounced the policy of procrastination and 
maneuvering being pursued by Israel to thwart the peace process. 
He asserted that the Madrid conference and the Washington talks 
have revealed to the world that Israel does not want peace and 
that it seeks instead to take on this or that Arab party on its 
own to conclude separate deals away from an international frame 
of reference. 
  Dr. Salman said further that Israel has tried to circumvent 
the outcome of the Geneva summit between President Hafiz al-Asad 
and U.S. President Bill Clinton by using pressure and launching 
a defamation campaign, in cooperation with the Zionist lobby, 
against the U.S. President. This is meant to drive the U.S. 
Administration to go back on its pledges regarding the 
achievement of peace on all tracks of the conflict. 
  The minister added that the new tendentious campaign against 
Syria is part of the schemes of Israel and the Zionist lobby to 
mar U.S.-Syrian relations and try to influence Syria's position 
that adheres to a comprehensive solution and does not submit to 
any blackmail or pressures. 
  The minister concluded his conversation with the members of 
the UN fact-finding mission by noting that the U.S. Government 
praised Syria's cooperation with Washington and European and 
international organizations in the field of combating drugs. 
Israel, on the other hand, is one of the primary countries that 
facilitate drug trafficking worldwide.

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] In another commentary, AL-THAWRAH speaks about 
renewed U.S. support for Israel, asserting that Israeli conduct 
that obstructs peace depends on continued U.S. support. 
  The paper urges Washington to adopt an independent policy 
toward the Arab-Israeli conflict or to deal impartially with 
this hot issue, so as to champion justice, international 
legitimacy, and the UN Charter and resolutions, as well as its 
credibility as a superpower entrusted by the Arabs and the 
world, but not by Israel, to look for a political settlement. 
Security Council Resolutions 242, 338, and 425 form the basis 
and foundation of this settlement, as well as the spirit of the 
initiative launched by the United States and the concept of 
exchanging land for peace. 
  AL-THAWRAH says if the U.S. Administration does not champion 
all of the above principles and the commitments President 
Clinton reiterated at the Geneva summit with President Hafiz 
al-Asad, then the least it should do is not to side with the 
Israeli aggressor that has usurped rights and territory. It 
should also not provide Israel with a cover by extending 
military and political aid to it. This aid strengthens the 
leaders of Israel in their rejection of all the obligations of 
just and comprehensive peace and in continuing aggression and 
crimes, adhering to their occupation of the Arab territories, 
taking lightly the will of the international community, and 
violating its legitimacy and laws. 
  The paper adds that U.S. support has been a major cause for 
increasing Israeli intransigence and arrogance. It has also 
encouraged Israeli practices, crimes, and attacks on Arabs. 
Today, this support is a direct cause for obstructing the peace 
process and Israel's not committing itself to its terms of 
reference. 
  In conclusion, AL-THAWRAH urges the United States to support 
the peace process toward achieving a just solution, without 
favoritism or bias.

<F P=106> [Palestine Broadcast: "Talk of the Return" by Fayiz Qandil] </F>
  [Text] Brother strugglers: Although the explosion at 
Hadera, in the Zionist heartland, yesterday, was only powerful 
enough to destroy just one Israeli military vehicle, it shook 
the earth under the decaying Zionist ideology, and dented the 
Zionists' arrogance and racism enough to make them understand 
who they are and who we, the Palestinian Arab people, are. 
  We, the Arabs, will help the Zionists make sense out of what 
happened at Hadera yesterday, provided they try to remember what 
happened a week before that. On that occasion, the Palestinian 
Arab struggle punished the wolves of the Ibrahimi Mosque 
massacre in 'Afula, as called for by divine and temporal laws 
and moral ethics. It would seem, though, that the Zionists have 
not recognized the 'Afula attack as a limited Palestinian Arab 
punishment for an indescribably savage Zionist massacre. 
Indeed, the Zionists were so arrogant and racist as to bark 
their infamous slogan, death to the Arabs. 
  True to their extremist and racist natures, they put their 
abhorrent slogan into practice. That was in the intervening 
week between the spectacular and wondrous 'Afula and Hadera 
operations. The Israeli military, using anti-tank rockets, 
flattened Palestinian Arab houses in the valiant city of 
Ramallah under their usual pretext that they were after some 
Palestinian Arabs on the run. That was an act of sheer terror 
and piracy. What matters here is that not one Palestinian 
Arab's body was found under the rubble. The houses and 
properties of all the world are not equal in value to a single 
Arab martyr's blood, even though martyrdom in itself is a gain 
and a new lease on life. In any case, let us remind Zionist 
injustice that by shelling Palestinian villages and camps with 
antitank rockets, Israel has pushed the limits of terrorism. 
Firing even a single rocket at an Arab house is the ultimate in 
terror -- an action prohibited by the Hague and Geneva 
conventions under which occupied territories and their 
population must be protected against the evils and criminality 
of the invading forces. Under these conventions, these forces 
are guilty of a category of war crimes and mass killings that 
came before special tribunals after World War II. 
  For the record, we will point out that Arab resistance in 
the 
occupied territories has warned the Israelis to expect Arab 
rockets to be fired at Zionist houses, as tit for tat, unless 
Israel refrains. After the Arab houses were blown up in 
Ramallah, the Israeli occupation wolves shot and killed a young 
pregnant Palestinian Arab woman who happened to be standing by a 
window in her home. Yesterday, and before the Hadera 
explosion, a Zionist settler, acting under the protection of the 
occupation army, opened fire on Arab school children in Jericho, 
wounding several of them. He was able to escape with the aid of 
killers of the Israeli occupation army. Hours later, Arab 
dynamite shook Hadera. 
  Will Israel now learn the lesson of 'Afula and Hadera, or 
will the Israelis revert to their terrorist, arrogant, and 
stupidly racist Zionist mentality? It is not for us to provide 
the answer to this question. This is for Israel to answer. If 
Israel learns the lesson and ends occupation and dismantles 
settlements and disarms settlers the road for peace will open 
wide. However, if Israel, as we think likely to happen, refuses 
to see sense, and death to the Arabs continues to be barked by 
the extremists, the Zionist state will be confronted by a great 
Palestinian Arab people who will unsheath the Israeli sword with 
one hand, staunch their noble wound with the other hand, and 
then hurl the sword back at Israel's chest. 
  Israel must call a halt to its terror and atrocities against 
the Palestinian Arab people. Otherwise, the muscular hand of 
the Palestinian Arab people that struck at 'Affula and Hadera in 
the Zionist heartland will reach to any place in Palestine that 
the wolves of Israeli occupation imagine is out of reach of the 
Palestinain resistance. 
  The only situation under which the Zionist invaders may have 
security and peace is the departure of Zionist colonialism and 
its weapons and institutions from the last inch of our sacred 
Palestinian Arab land.

<F P=106> [Palestine Broadcast: "Talk of the Return" by Ibrahim </F>
Basyuni] 
  [Text] Brothers along the path of revolution and 
liberation: The occupied Arab territories in the West Bank and 
Gaza Strip have seen further operations and violent 
confrontations with Zionist soldiers and settlers. These 
operations extended to parts of Palestinian territory occupied 
in 1948. 
  Less than 24 hours after the daring martyrdom operation 
carried out by a Palestinian youth in the city of 'Afula in 1948 
Palestine, in which eight Israelis were killed and 52 others 
were wounded, a Palestinian youth opened fire on Zionist 
settlers near Ashdod, also in 1948 Palestine. A settler was 
killed and four were wounded. The Palestinian youth was 
martyred when the Zionist soldiers in the area shot him dead. A 
Palestinian youth in the occupied Gaza Strip stabbed a Zionist 
settler in the [Gush Qatif] settlement near Khan Yunus, 
seriously wounding him. 
  These are some of the bold and heroic operations the 
intifadah youth carried out against the Zionist soldiers and 
settlers in the Arab territories occupied before and after 1967. 
The 'Afula and subsequent operations are in reply to the 
massacres committed by settler gangs and Zionist troops in the 
holy Ibrahim Mosque 40 days ago. 
  No doubt, carrying out this operation and the Ashdod 
operation in 1948 Palestine confirms the ability of intifadah 
youths to expand their operations to include, in addition to the 
West Bank and Gaza Strip, all the cities and villages in 1948 
Palestine. The intifadah youths can move and carry out 
operations throughout occupied Palestine. There will be no 
secure or calm place in the occupied Arab territories as long as 
Zionist occupation exists in Palestine and as long as the 
occupation authorities refuse to withdraw from the occupied Arab 
territories or recognize the Palestinian Arab people's 
legitimate rights. 
  As acknowledged by Zionist officials, the 'Afula operation 
and subsequent daring fedayeen operations confirmed both the 
failure of the Israeli repression and the inability of the 
Israeli Army, police, and all the repressive Israeli measures to 
provide protection and security to the Zionist settlers. After 
the Hebron massacre, the occupation authorities sealed off the 
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, and took various terrorist 
and repressive measures in order to prevent the intifadah youths 
from replying to this massacre. But what was the result? The 
result appeared in 'Afula, and a few hours later, in Ashdod. 
The intifadah youths replied to the massacre in the holy 
Ibrahimi Mosque, in which more than 60 Palestinian worshipers 
were victimized and hundreds were wounded. 
  The intifadah youths replied to this massacre in 1948 
Palestine in 'Afula and Ashdod, confirming their determination 
to continue the struggle against the occupation authorities, and 
stressing their ability to reach their targets at the time and 
in the place they choose. There is no safe place in the 
occupied Arab territories. There will be no peace or security 
for Zionist settlers and soldiers as long as Israel occupies 
Arab territories and as long as settler gangs and occupation 
troops commit daily massacres and terrorist crimes against 
Palestinian worshipers, children, and women. 
  Peace, security, and stability will not be achieved for 
Israel as long as peace, security, and stability are not 
available for the Palestinian Arab people. A just and 
comprehensive peace has bases, components, and principles. UN 
Security Council Resolutions 242, 338, and 425 defined these 
bases and components. These resolutions provide for full 
Israeli withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories, namely, 
the West Bank, including Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip, as well 
as occupied Golan and the occupied portion of southern Lebanon. 
They also guarantee the Palestinian Arab people's legitimate 
rights. 
  These are the components of a comprehensive and just peace 
which were the bases of the peace process. Without implementing 
these bases and components, Israel will not enjoy peace and 
stability regardless of the duration of the occupation or 
Israel's terrorist massacres and crimes. Our Palestinian Arab 
people will not surrender as long as occupation exists in the 
land of Palestine, and they will chase the Zionists in every 
spot in occupied Palestine. Our people can do this, as was 
proved by the 'Afula operation, by the operations that followed 
this operation, and by the operation that will follow it. These 
operations will never stop, regardless of challenges and of the 
duration of both the occupation and aggression. Final victory 
will be the lot of our Palestinian Arab people, the owners of 
the land and the rightful claimants to this land, the land of 
their fathers and forefathers.

  [Text] The Omani Consultative Council delegation led by 
Speaker Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-'Ali al-Qatabi left Damascus this 
morning after a four-day visit to Syria. They were seen off at 
Damascus International Airport by People's Assembly Speaker 
'Abd-al-Qadir Qaddurah; Dr. Ibrahim Za'rur, deputy head of the 
Assembly's Guidance Committee; Assembly secretary Rajab Ibrahim; 
Oman's Ambassador to Damascus 'Abdallah al-Kharusi; and some 
Omani Embassy staff . 
  In a statement to a SANA correspondent, Shaykh al-Qatabi 
lauded the close, strong, and fraternal relations between the 
two sisterly countries. The foundations of these relations were 
laid by President Hafiz al-Asad and Sultan Qabus, he noted. 
  Shaykh al-Qatabi added: As part of this visit, we are adding 
a brick to the comprehensive building of sisterly inter-Arab 
relations. This visit gave us an opportunity to meet with our 
brothers in the People's Assembly, and to discuss and exchange 
ideas with them and learn about the People's Assembly's 
experience. We also briefed them on our experience in the 
Consultative Council. Ideas were exchanged on ways to promote 
and enhance relations between the two bodies. 
  Shaykh al-Qatabi described the meetings he and his 
delegation 
held with senior Syrian officials during this visit as useful 
and fruitful. He said: During this visit, we were briefed on 
the Syrian position and course concerning the efforts made to 
reach a comprehensive and just peace. We were also briefed on 
Syrian initiatives in this regard. These initiatives enjoy 
regional and world appreciation for both their credibility and 
definite desire to achieve peace in the region. 
  Concluding his statement, Shaykh al-Qatabi said: We will 
brief our brothers in Oman on our ideas as part of ongoing 
contacts at the highest levels between the two fraternal 
countries.

'Ammar Salah 'Amarani from the Samaria village of Ya'bad. Our 
correspondent Moti Amir reports that the man was a known Hamas 
[Islamic Resistance Movement] activist, but he had been never

<F P=106> [Interview with Lieutenant General Ehud Baraq, chief of </F>
staff, by Army affairs correspondent Karmela Menashe; place and 
date not given -- recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [Menashe] Chief of Staff Ehud Baraq, you have 
just returned from a tour of Judaea and Samaria, of Qalqilyah. 
Is the closure being enforced? 
  [Baraq] As far as possible. I met with reserve soldiers 
from a very fine northern Infantry brigade, and I saw that they 
were very well briefed on the need to conduct tighter checks of 
both documents and the license plates on Israeli vehicles 
leaving the territories. In addition, they are properly 
inspecting the trunks of the vehicles and checking under the 
seats. Secondary roads are being cut off, and patrols are 
deploying between the roads and inside the terrain itself. All 
these actions hinder the infiltration of people and warfare 
means into Israel, but we must admit with all honesty that they 
do not eliminate the danger entirely. 
  [Menashe] Has the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] begun 
implementing the order from the prime minister and defense 
minister to move troops from the territories to the 
Israel-territories divide, the Green Line? 
  [Baraq] Yes. Immediately after receiving this order over 24 
hours ago, we started to considerably increase our deployment 
along the divide at the expense of our presence both in Judaea 
and Samaria and in Israel. This is part of some recent changes 
resulting from new emphases in response to the changing 
situation. We are no less responsible for the security of 
Israelis in Judaea and Samaria today than we were yesterday, but 
the recent events -- most notably the events in Hadera and 
'Afula -- revealed that the emphasis of the other side's 
operational activity has shifted to the divide; therefore, it is 
vital that we shift our own activity to that place. [passage

<F P=106> [Interview with Lieutenant General Ehud Baraq, chief of </F>
staff, by Army affairs correspondent Alon Ben-David; place and 
date not given -- recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Ben-David] A week ago we 
witnessed the removal of equipment from IDF [Israel Defense 
Forces] bases in the Gaza Strip. This was done despite the face 
that the negotiations with the PLO are still in progress and no 
agreement on the evacuation of Gaza and Jericho has been signed. 
Has the IDF not evacuated somewhat prematurely? 
  [Baraq] The IDF has brought forward the evacuation date of 
objects and logistics. If necessary, we can remain there just 
as we are for as long as 12 days, 12 months, or 12 years. The 
IDF's operational forces will neither leave nor redeploy in 
accordance with the new plans -- incidentally, the redeployment 
is also inside the Gaza Strip, around the Qatif Bloc, around 
settlements and along traffic axes -- until we achieve an 
agreement we consider reasonable from the security angle and the 
political echelons consider reasonable from the political point 
of view. 
  [Ben-David] We are waging a war against terrorism in the 
north as well. The question is whether our negotiations with 
Syria will be accompanied by protracted terror there, too, 
carried out under Syrian auspices, more or less. 
  [Baraq] In my opinion, we should work on the premise of and 
with a mental and physical preparedness for continuing terror in 
the north. In the long run, however, political arrangements may 
offer a certain chance for a long-term reduction of tension and 
enmity, provided they reflect an appropriate sensitivity to the 
security issue. Nothing can turn us into the Netherlands and 
Belgium or Switzerland and France in this generation, but a 
proper balance of security-related emphases in the political 
content with a technical, a physical military preparedness.... 
[pauses] At present, we face almost no existential threat. 
The State of Israel is very strong today in the sense of being 
able to defend its existence. What is threatened is the 
personal safety of its civilians, who are faced with terror. 
  [Ben-David] We are celebrating our Independence Day, and yet 
the IDF's POW's and MIA's are still not with us. Is there 
anything new in this respect? 
  [Baraq] There is no news; however, we will continue doing 
everything that may contribute to the discovery of new 
information about the fate of the MIA's and to return the POW's 
home. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Katyusha rockets were fired during the night into 
the Galilee Panhandle from south Lebanon. There were no reports 
of injuries or damage. On the line now is reporter Alan 
Ben-'Ami: 
  No one was hurt from the katyusha rockets which fell in the 
Galilee Panhandle twice during the night, nor were there any 
reports of damage. But it is only with first light that the 
Army has been able to begin sweeping the area to find exactly 
were the rockets fell. The katyusha attacks followed shelling 
of the Lebanese port city of Sidon by South Lebanon Army [SLA] 
soldiers last night, and that shooting came in the wake of two 
explosions yesterday in the village of 'Aramta in the security 
zone, explosions which killed several SLA soldiers and wounded a 
dozen more people, both soldiers and civilians. One of the dead 
SLA men is said to be Major As'ad Nasir, an SLA commander in the 
area. Hizballah has claimed responsibility for the bomb blasts, 
and Hizballah gunners also began shelling a number of SLA 
positions during the night. SLA gunners returned by firing a 
number of shells at different targets, including Sidon. 
Lebanese Army gunners also said to have taken part in exchanges 
of fire yesterday. This is the first time that this big port 
city in south Lebanon has come under fire in some years, and it 
is not clear just why it was targeted, but the SLA shellings 
claimed a number of lives and wounded a dozen people or so in 
this city, as well as setting a number of fires. 
  Israeli military sources deny reports that the IDF [Israel 
Defense Forces] was involved in the shooting in any way, and it 
was clearly a breach in the understandings which were reached 
after Operation Accountability in south Lebanon last year. It's 
not clear now just how the situation is going to develop, 
whether stability will return to the north or not, but tension 
remains very high both inside south Lebanon and in the Israeli 
border towns in the north.

  [Text] A few moments ago the residents of Qiryat Shemona 
were ordered into shelters. After a barrage of katyusha rockets 
on the Galilee this morning, the head of Northern Command has 
put the blame on the Hizballah organization. At the same time 
General Yitzhaq Mordekhay made it clear the IDF [Israel Defense 
Forces] would not let Hizballah escalate the situation in 
southern Lebanon. According to Gen. Mordekhay, there may have 
been a connection between the katyusha attack and the SLA's 
[South Lebanese Army] bombardment of Sidon.

  Our correspondent Nisim Qeynan reports that the rally was 
addressed by right-wing Knesset members, including Ari'el 
Sharon, Beni Begin, and Rehav'am Ze'evi. Ari'el Sharon told our 
correspondent that the settlers must resist settlement 
evacuation nonviolently. 
  Approximately 2,000 of the participants in the Qatif Bloc 
events marched to Netzarim, violating a High Court of Justice 
ruling and understandings with the IDF [Israel Defense Forces], 
and the Army was forced to escort the marchers.

<F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Aluf Ben] </F>
  [Excerpt] Russia has decided to renew its arms sales to 
Syria, and the two countries will sign a large $500-million arms 
deal in the near future. For the first time, Russia has 
informed Israel in advance of its intention to sign a new arms 
deal with Syria but did not specify the type of weapons covered 
by the transaction or the timetable of the weapons' delivery. 
  Moscow recently informed Jerusalem of the expected deal 
through diplomatic channels. According to the report, Russia 
has agreed to reschedule Damascus' $7-billion debt to the former 
Soviet Union, which was given as credit to finance previous arms 
purchases. After Syria makes the first payment of $2 billion to 
Russia, the two countries will sign a new arms deal. 
  Until now, Syria's huge debts were an obstacle to relations 
between Damascus and Moscow. For a long time the Syrians 
refused to discuss returning the money, claiming that Russia was 
not the sole heir to the former Soviet Union. Syrian President 
Hafiz al-Asad has recently recognized Russia as the sole 
creditor for outstanding debts and agreed to discuss resolving 
the problem. 
  In their message to Jerusalem, the Russians asserted that 
Moscow was still playing a marginal role in superpower arm sales 
to the Middle East, especially in comparison to the United 
States. The Russians also noted that Israel was selling weapons 
to the former Soviet republics bordering on Russia, such as 
Estonia, much to the displeasure of Moscow, which fears that 
these weapons may in future be turned against the Russian Army 
or Russian minorities in the republic. 
  According to reports which recently reached Israel from 
other 
sources, Syria is deliberately putting off its arms purchases 
from Russia in order to pressure Moscow to write off most of 
Syria's debt and settle for one payment of $2 billion. 
According to these reports, the Syrians hope that the economic 
crisis in Russia will force Moscow to write off their debt in 
order to supply work to the Russian arms industries. 
  It was recently reported that Syria seeks to purchase 
sophisticated SA-10 anti-aircraft missiles and new fighter jets 
from Russia. 
  Officials in Jerusalem have still not decided how to react 
to 
the reports on the new arms deal between Syria and Russia. 
Senior political sources yesterday said that Prime Minister 
Yitzhaq Rabin may discuss the Russian arms sales to the Middle 
East when he visits Moscow at the end of the month and meets 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Defense Minister Pavel 
Grachev. 
  Relations between Syria and the United States have become 
tense over recent weeks. Christopher Ross, the American 
ambassador to Syria, held an especially tough meeting, focusing 
on the continuing terrorist attacks in Lebanon, with Syrian 
Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar'. 
  Information reaching Jerusalem indicates that the tension in 
U.S.-Syrian relations was the main reason for al-Asad's trip to 
Egypt last week to meet Egyptian President Husni Mubarak. 
Al-Asad expressed his deep disappointment with U.S. promises to 
improve relations with Syria, especially with regard to removing 
Syria from the list of countries sponsoring terrorism and the 
drug trade. The Administration recently decided to leave Syria 
on "the drug list" despite an earlier promise to remove the 
Syrians from the list. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Commenting on the downing of two foreign 
helicopters by U.S. aircraft in northern Iraq, the political 
editor of the Iraqi News Agency [INA] wrote today the following: 
  The downing of these two helicopters has tangibly revealed 
the tendentious, premeditated intentions of U.S. and Western 
quarters and their agents in the autonomous region. 
  When the incident took place, the agent quarters in the 
autonomous region, as well as U.S. and Western quarters, 
initially said that the helicopters were shot down by Iraqi 
aircraft. When the truth came out and it was learned that the 
U.S. side was the one that downed the two helicopters, those 
quarters remained silent and could not avoid the truth. It 
seems they were forced to tell the truth because those who were 
killed in the incident were of several nationalities so the 
truth could not be hidden. Therefore, their black intentions to 
involve Iraq in any matter were exposed. 
  This tendentious approach in leveling accusations against 
Iraq betrays premeditated intentions against Iraq. It also 
reveals the truth about many previous tendentious accusations 
regarding incidents that took place in the northern region in 
which Iraq was falsely accused in a tendentious, hasty manner.

<F P=106> [Article by Salah al-Mukhtar: "Clinton's Decline"] </F>
  [Text] Bill Clinton, who had seemed to to be courteous and 
flexible enough and about to take a more realistic approach than 
the bloody criminal Bush, is increasingly unmasking a face no 
less ugly or filthy than Bush! Clinton had set himself apart 
from George Bush a few hours before taking office when he said 
he would be prepared to engage Iraq in dialogue. His advisers 
had leaked suggestions he would pursue different policies toward 
Iraq when he assumed power. 
  We, therefore, feel disgust toward a man who started off 
with 
a human face but later turned into a ferocious beast! In his 
early youth, Clinton joined protest marches and took a hostile 
stand toward his country's military engagement in Vietnam. But 
he is now pursing even more criminal policies than Richard Nixon 
and stands readier than Bush to become a monkey and effect a 
complete aboutface. 
  Is there anything so base as the president of the greatest 
nation on Earth turning himself into a monkey that turns its 
backside to amuse spectators in the hope of making a dime or 
two? The rash and nervous Clinton of today is not the sober and 
cool Clinton of yesterday! One who loses one's balance and 
falls captive to one's passions and crises is bound to be caught 
up in lies and further crimes! 
  On the day before yesterday, he sent a new letter to the 
U.S. 
Congress's official spokesman in which he stooped even lower and 
repeated lies about Iraq. Clinton opened his letter by stating 
his extreme alarm by contradictions and the questions that 
remain unanswered in the area of chemical weapons. It was 
important, his letter said, to ensure effective and 
comprehensive inspection. 
  Clinton knows that such statements to the Congress are sheer 
lies, for the simple reason that the UN commission's reports, 
including those submitted by Rolf Ekeus, head of the Special 
Commission, testify that Iraq has met its obligations and that 
the chemical weapons file is closed. 
  Beyond that, Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz and 
Lieutenant 
General 'Amir Rashid recently showed, supported by evidence and 
figures, that Iraq has implemented its commitments in the area 
of chemical weapons. Clinton and his aides have had access to 
these facts. To call him liar, therefore, is not to do him an 
injustice. 
  Clinton has stooped to such depths as to blackmail Ekeus 
into 
dereliction of his duties and abandonment of his convictions. 
The American President quotes Ekeus as saying he does not 
expect his report about Iraq's compliance with its commitments 
to be ready before the end of the year at the earliest. Clinton 
goes on to comment: We strongly advocate Ekeus' line and reject 
the drawing up of a timetable. 
  These statements are clearly meant to pressure and threaten 
Ekeus. They amount to orders as to what he should and should 
not do. Clinton thus chooses to forget that he is in breach of 
UN Security Council Resolution 687, especially Paragraph 22, 
which stipulates that the council will lift the sanctions once 
Iraq has honored its obligations, which Iraq has done, as 
evidenced by reports submitted by UN commissions and Ekeus 
himself. 
  Clinton goes too far with his show of his meanness, 
reaching the level of a professional liar. He quoted a 
fabricated story, previously denied by a neutral investigation 
conducted by a UN committee, to the effect that southern Iraq is 
exposed to repression. Does this mean the UN committee's 
investigation is based on lies? Doesn't this mean that the 
President of the United States is a liar? In an attempt to 
incite the Congress against Iraq, he spoke about investigating 
Iraq's war crimes and violations of human rights in Iraq. This 
proves once again that Clinton is not only a liar with double 
consciences and double standards, but that he also does not have 
the memory to protect him from saying anything that is easy to 
refute. Every day, the world discovers anew that the U.S. 
Administrations' crimes in the field of human rights are the 
worst, the meanest, in mankind's modern history. Based on U.S. 
information, since its establishment the United States has 
carried out more than 200 large-scale military interventions 
against other nations and peoples, without any justification or 
legal right. As a result, hundreds of thousands of people died 
and cities and cultural sites were destroyed. Among these crude 
interventions were the U.S. aggression against Korea in the 
fifties, the aggression against Vietnam in the sixties, the 
aggressions against Grenada and Nicaragua in the eighties, and 
the aggressions against Panama, Haiti, Iraq, and Somalia in the 
nineties. The world is now convinced that America is the most 
hostile state in history, and that it has encroached the most on 
the most important of human rights, namely, the right to live 
freely in a sovereign, independent state. 
  Before this, the United States was the first nation in 
history to use, unnecessarily, a nuclear weapon that killed 
hundreds of thousands of people. Later, the United States was 
one of the most prominent states that turned its own people into 
guinea pigs and injected them with chemical and nuclear 
materials, which led to many years of torture for them, although 
laws prohibited the experiments. 
  America's record of disdain for human rights is endless. It 
is the country that discriminates the most against other ethnic 
groups and races. It even reached the point where the non-white 
were considered equal to dogs and animals. 
  So, does a state whose human rights record is this black 
have 
the right to speak about human rights and war crimes? Mankind 
is looking forward to the day when peoples will succeed in 
condemning those who were the first to use nuclear arms against 
people; chemical weapons against revolutionaries, freedom-loving 
people, and civilians; those who assassinated the leaders of 
liberation movements and spread vice and drugs in the world; and 
those who, with unmatched brutality, attacked civilian shelters 
and annihilated hundreds of thousands of children as a result of 
a shortage of medicine and malnutrition due to the blockade 
clamped on Iraq. 
  When he speaks about Iraq's Kurds, as the one who defends 
them, Clinton looks like a circus clown who knows he has become 
a means to make his viewers laugh. The whole world knows, 
particularly the Kurds, that the most hideous persecution the 
Kurds had ever been exposed to is the one taking place now under 
the protection and blessing of Clinton. Turkey is carrying out 
a war of annihilation against its Kurds with Clinton's blessings 
and under his protection. However, concerning Iraq's Kurds, 
Clinton, just as his predecessor criminal Bush, also exposes 
them to annihilation, but in a different way. They are 
suffering from starvation, a lack of security, and the 
deliberate spread of disease and the destruction of the unity of 
the family. 
  America's appointment of the thieves, smugglers, and killers 
of the Talabani and Barzani gangs, rulers of Iraq's Kurds, is in 
itself a systematic destruction of the Kurds' life. How can 
Clinton have the audacity to accuse Iraq of doing something that 
is a small part of what he does? 
  The crimes America has perpetrated, and is perpetrating, 
against mankind requires that international observers be 
appointed at the Pentagon, the U.S. State Department, and CIA 
headquarters, in Indian reservations, the black cities, and the 
quarters of Hispanics exposed to ethnic and economic persecution 
and social discrimination. 
  Clinton told Congress that "the Security Council member 
states are unanimous that Iraq has not complied with Security 
Council resolutions." Clinton's statement contradicts UN and 
other reports that made the international community change its 
attitude. This change was even apparent at the Security Council, 
when three permanent member states and eight nonpermanent member 
states, including some U.S. allies, have acknowledged that Iraq 
has largely complied with UN resolutions. 
  Is there a fool in the whole world who would believe this 
nonsense? Is Clinton unaware that most nations now understand 
Iraq's view and are uncomfortable with U.S. custodianship? 
  Speaking about the embargo, moreover, Clinton said: "The 
Iraqi Government distributes humanitarian supplies to its 
supporters and to the Army." This contradicts hard reality that 
supplies reach even the isolated autonomous region. This also 
contradicts international and U.S. reports prepared by 
committees that visited Iraq and admired the ration card system 
as a comprehensive system that covers all citizens, and not only 
a faction of the people. 
  Finally, Clinton discussed the false story about the 
assassination of foreigners in the autonomous region, saying: 
"Documented reports show that the Iraqi Government is offering 
financial rewards for terrorist operations." We will not 
elaborate on this lie. We will only cite the fact that the U.S. 
State Department spokesman said the United States is checking 
this information. Also, a report by the United Nations did not 
make any accusations in this regard. So how can Clinton be so 
sure in his letter? Is this not a kind of falsification and 
deception of the highest legislative authority in the United 
States? 
  Has Clinton forgotten that the warlords in northern Iraq, 
such as Talabani and Barzani, trade accusations about murder, 
theft, lack of security, and spread of vice? Is the CIA so 
incapable of knowing that there is no security in northern Iraq 
and that this allows for all kinds of crimes, including crimes 
against foreigners? 
  Another thing. Why does Clinton find it strange for a German 
reporter to be killed and two others to be injured in a region 
where there is no security when dozens are killed daily in New 
York, as well as in other American cities. The last such 
incident was the killing of two Japanese people in America. 
  Finally, we would like to tell Mr. Clinton the following: 
First, you are lying and you know that you are lying. This 
shows your dreadful moral decline, especially since you were an 
advocate of freedom. Second, you are lying to mislead Congress. 
This is a crime punishable by the U.S. Constitution and U.S. 
law. Third, you are helpless and driven to do all of this 
because hellish episodes have placed you in the middle of a hell 
of financial and sex scandals. You were shown a picture that 
condemns you and were asked to choose either killing and 
devouring the flesh of mankind so as to satisfy the urge of 
capitalism for theft in return for covering your deviations or 
facing scandal and receiving slaps from Hilary Clinton, the lady 
who makes your decisions, when these pictures are sent to her 
showing her the story of your romance before and after becoming 
president. Fourth, the lies you are telling today will result 
in killing more Iraqi children and elderly people and expose the 
Iraqi people to further pain and suffering. You are well aware 
of that. Therefore, you are a strong candidate to become a war 
criminal that can be easily guided toward organized crime. 
  But you are mistaken, Mr. Clinton. The world is changing. 
The voices of freedom are getting louder, and you know that 
too. This is clear in your stupidities and nervousness that 
prove you are aware that the United States will be defeated and 
Iraq will triumph, just like all nations struggling for freedom, 
independence, and honor will triumph.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>
  [Excerpts] The NATO air attack on Serb positions last 
Monday, with the objective of forcing them to respect Gorazde as 
a UN declared safe haven, will undoubtedly affect the stand of 
all the warring sides and the influential foreign states. It is 
said that the U.S. Government wishes to continue such attacks 
from time to time, for the Serb aggression against Gorazde has 
wiped off the United Nations' last vestige of prestige and has 
undermined the Security Council decisions, taken under the 
influence of the western governments. But it seems that NATO is 
the main loser of this international air display. 
  The NATO air raids, although limited to some sort of air 
display so far, has angered the Russians who were not consulted 
on the decision to launch an air strike. [passage omitted] 
  The extreme nationalists of the Russian legislatures, 
including Zhirinovskiy's Liberal Democratic Party, have now 
become the major faction influencing Russia's foreign policy. 
This faction does not wish to see further humiliation of 
Russia. They become angry when they see their Slav brothers are 
killed by the NATO bombs. The Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev, therefore, protested and adopted a stand against the 
NATO air attack on the Serb positions. The attack foiled his 
dream of hoping that the West would consider Russia as an equal 
and trustworthy partner. The question in everybody's mind in 
Russia today is, when will the West stop humiliating Russia?

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Degrading Iran's Successful Anti-Drug Campaign"] </F>
  [Text] Since 1989 when the Majles (the Islamic Consultative 
Assembly) ratified the Antinarcotics Law--according to which 
tough punishments including long-term imprisonments and death 
penalty for local and international drug-traffickers were 
introduced--the quantity of narcotic drugs smuggled into Iran 
for either domestic use or transit to Europe, has drastically 
decreased. 
  During the past five years large quantities, including tens 
of tons of opium, heroin and morphine, have been seized by the 
Iranian National Security Forces from the smugglers, the bulk of 
which were en route to the European markets and possibly from 
Europe to other regions of the world. In their efforts to 
combat the well armed international drug smugglers, a number of 
Iranian law enforcement personnel were martyred. 
  Meanwhile every once in a while, some international human 
rights organization or certain foreign countries criticize 
Tehran for its anti-drug activities. For instance in October 
1993, Amnesty International under the pretext of protecting 
"human rights" criticized Iran for its death penalty policy for 
traffickers. 
  The recent statement by the U.S. assistant secretary of 
state 
for international narcotics strategy, Mr. Robert Gelbard, who 
accused Iran of not being successful in its drug campaign is 
surely part of a general conspiracy to degrade the Islamic 
Republic of Iran's successful efforts in combating drug 
trafficking. 
  Unable to convince the European countries and Japan to join 
Washington's economic embargo plans against Tehran, it is not a 
big surprise to see a senior U.S. official making such a 
baseless statement at a time when Iran is planning to further 
enhance its cooperation in combating traffickers both at 
regional and global levels, within the framework of the Economic 
Cooperation Organization as well as international organizations 
such as the United Nations Drug Control Program (UNDCP) or 
Interpol. 
  It is crystal clear that drug smuggling is a major 
international problem which knows no boundaries and without 
regional and international cooperation, combating traffickers 
and drug abuse will be a costly measure and a bit difficult for 
individual states. Therefore it is no wonder to hear a senior 
U.S. official to make such a baseless statement in order to 
merely degrade Iran's anti-narcotic strives. 
  Indeed, it can be assessed that what Mr. Gelbard has said is 
part of Washington's general foreign policy strategy to isolate 
Iran by using all available means to crate a negative picture of 
the Islamic Republic in the minds of the international 
community. But, surely the antinarcotic planners of the country 
and the brave personnel of the National Security Forces will 
foil Washington's propaganda by adopting proper measures.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Sow the Wind and Reap the Whirlwind"] </F>
  [Text] Yesterday marked the 14th anniversary of severing of 
diplomatic relations between the Islamic Republic and the United 
States of America. 
  Several occasions arose in the last decade and a half for 
improving Irano-American relations, but so far there has been no 
change in the status quo. 
  An analytical review of the history of the two countries' 
relations reveals that two key factors were instrumental in 
shaping U.S. policy towards Iran prior to the Islamic 
Revolution. First was the U.S. fear of Communist domination of 
the oil-rich Persian Gulf region, and second was America's 
political immaturity combined with its military and economic 
supremacy which deprived the United States of the chance to 
understand the realities of world politics. 
  The United States never understood the Islamic Revolution in 
Iran because it never appreciated this country's culture and 
history. If the universal definition of politics is war fought 
without arms, then Washington's policies towards 
pre-revolutionary Iran must be defined as war fought by coercion. 
  Despite the friendly disposition of Iran towards the United 
States in the late 1940's and early 1950's, American policies, 
stemming from U.S. power, gradually soured the initial and 
cordial relations between the two countries and changed it into 
an antagonistic relationship. The role of the United States in 
toppling the nationalist government of Dr. Mosaddeq in 1953, and 
the subsequent U.S.-sponsored policies of Iran which neglected 
this country's religious, historical, and cultural backgrounds, 
was the final straw that broke the back of Iran-U.S. friendly 
relations. 
  The Islamic Republic's anti-American stance in the past 14 
years is a natural reaction to U.S. actions in Iran since the 
50's and is based on the principle of "he who sows the wind will 
reap the whirlwind." Iranians' collective opinion of the U.S. 
has changed, they no longer think of the United States as 
synonymous with names such as Morgan Shuster [served as Persia's 
treasurer-general in 1911] and [Arthur] Millspaugh [U.S. adviser 
to the Persian Ministry of Finance 1922-1927]. The new American 
image in the Iranian mind is one of an imperialist government 
with less than friendly designs for the Islamic Republic. 
  Washington has preferred to look at the world from the point 
of view of a superpower, while the Islamic Republic, which was 
founded on the principle of mutual respect in its dealings with 
other countries, refuses to bow to superpower pressure. The 
U.S. is faced with the same dilemma in Europe where it took on 
the role of the dominant Western power during the Cold War. 
Today's European efforts to undermine U.S. authority is the 
logical outcome of 45 years of slave-master relationship between 
Europe and the United States. 
  The as yet undefined "new world order" has provided an 
opportunity for the U.S. to rethink its basic policies vis-a-vis 
the rest of the world.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Suspicious Conduct of the Russians Will </F>
Prove Costly for Armenia"] 
  [Text] With the experts group's conclusion of its work and 
the Foreign Ministry's dissemination of its official statement 
on the downing of the Iranian cargo plane by Armenian 
antiaircraft missiles, the technical aspects of the incident are 
clearer. At first glance, it appears that due to laxity on the 
part of the navigation facilities in the region, especially the 
Yerevan facility, and the lack of serious and responsible 
support for the aircraft resulted in it deviating from its 
course into the war zone, where it ultimately was downed by the 
Armenians. 
  In any case, Armenia is responsible for this incident 
because 
the Georgian air control facility reported that it had safely 
guided the aircraft into Armenian airspace, so whatever occurred 
thereafter was the responsibility of Armenia as the host country. 
  There are certain other clues that point to a second 
possibility--that is, that the downing of the plane was not an 
accident but a preplanned plot. If this hypothesis is assumed 
to be correct, we have to consider who stood to gain from such 
an incident. 
  It appears that the Armenians do not stand to gain, for this 
would only result in straining relations with the Islamic 
Republic of Iran and generate mistrust between the two 
neighbors. Therefore, such an act would not seem to be to 
Armenia's benefit. On the other hand, even though Azerbaijan 
stands to benefit from any worsening of relations between Iran 
and Armenia, in this particular case it could not have been able 
to interfere as the air corridors are designated by Russia, 
Georgia, Iran, and Armenia. 
  However, for quite some time Russia has considered this area 
its domain; and now that these countries have gained 
independence Russia's interests lie in the continuation of a 
state of instability and insecurity in the region so that it can 
use this as a pretext to justify the presence of its forces. On 
the other hand, it is possible the Russians refuse to remain 
passive while there is a growing trend of friendship and trust 
between Iran and regional countries such as Georgia, Azerbaijan, 
and Armenia, especially since at the same time these countries' 
displeasure with Russia is growing. Perhaps it is within the 
framework of these factors that we should view the growing 
unrest in that region and the fomenting of crises in order to 
erode the trust between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the 
rest of the region. 
  If we view the downing of the Iranian cargo airplane from 
this angle, there is much evidence to bolster this theory. 
First of all, news reports cite Moscow airport as saying that 
the flight route of the Iranian aircraft was suspicious, passing 
in the vicinity of the war zone--that is, the corridor 
[preceding word in English] over Russia, Georgia, Armenia, and 
Iran. The other corridor, which is the safe one and the one 
normally used--passing over Russia, Azerbaijan, and the Caspian 
Sea--goes over Baku and the Caspian Sea and is far away from the 
war zone. 
  If an airplane were to develop the slightest technical 
problem while transiting the Georgia-Armenia corridor it would 
stray into the dangerous war zone of Nagorno-Karabakh. Proof of 
this is that when this happened to some airplanes earlier, 
Russia and Yerevan were able to inform the commander of the 
Armenian forces in Nagorno-Karabakh immediately and thus 
forestall the downing of those aircraft. In this particular 
case, the navigation facility did not act as responsibly as 
before and simply let the aircraft remain in this dangerous zone. 
  The other proof, which is stronger than all the other 
evidence, is that less than 24 hours after the incident the 
Russians presented a detailed report by their military experts 
on the downing, which was carried by ITAR-TASS. This report 
attempted to disseminate for the first time at the regional and 
international levels a false and baseless rumor that the Iranian 
aircraft was on an espionage mission over Nagorno-Karabakh. 
  From the technical and practical point of view, this rumor 
is 
quite ridiculous, as the Iranian aircraft was only carrying 
family members of high-level Iranian diplomats and of some 
military personnel. It had remained on the ground in Moscow for 
three days prior to the flight and was directed toward Armenia 
by Moscow. What is interesting is that the pilot requested 
permission for an emergency landing at an Armenian airport. How 
could an airplane that had remained on the ground in Moscow for 
three days and later requested permission to land at an Armenian 
airport be on an espionage assignment against Armenians? 
Therefore, this preliminary report confirms the spuriousness of 
this rumor disseminated by the Russians. 
  In view of the extensive bureaucracy [preceding word in 
English] that we know characterizes the Russian system, how did 
the Russians obtain an expert analysis of the issue and manage 
to fabricate a rumor and even disseminate it so quickly by means 
of the ITAR-TASS news agency at the regional and international 
levels? All this points a premeditated plan with the specific 
objective of undermining trust and generating an atmosphere of 
suspicion in the region. It is also possible that this detailed 
report by ITAR-TASS had been prepared earlier. 
  Thus, on the basis of the information gleaned, the relevant 
high-level Iranian officials have contacted the Russian 
authorities to protest such troublemaking and ask them to deny 
the rumor publicly. The Russians expressed regret at the 
dissemination of this false rumor at the meeting, but not only 
did they not take any steps to issue a public denial, they even 
attempted to play up the issue in various ways in the Russian 
newspapers. Just yesterday [30 March] another Russian newspaper 
fanned this rumor once again. Therefore, the speed with which 
the rumor was concocted and disseminated and the Russian 
officials' insistence on spreading the rumor confirms the 
scenario of a there being a premeditated plot with regard to 
this painful incident. 
  The above points should be taken seriously into account. 
Armenia must be vigilant, and regardless of whether it was a 
premeditated plot against the Armenian regime or the result of 
carelessness on the part of the Armenian system in general the 
Armenian government should decide independently as a reliable 
neighbor to take responsibility for the incident. In a sincere 
and farsighted manner, it should try to pacify this great 
neighboring nation [of Iran] and should strive to restore and 
consolidate once again the mutual trust between our two nations. 
Otherwise, this incident will continue to fester painfully like 
a sharp bone protruding from a wound, and will prove costly for 
Armenia, all because of its irresponsible neighbor [Russia).

  [Text] Tehran, April 14, IRNA -- Iran's embassy in Ankara 
on Thursday denounced the "baseless" remarks made by Israeli 
Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres in Turkey against Iran. In a 
statement, the embassy said that it regretted that such baseless 
and meaningless statements were made in Iran's neighbouring 
state of Turkey. 
  Peres who is visiting Turkey, in his speech wished the laic 
government of Turkey would overcome the Islamic revolution of 
Iran. 
  The embassy statement stressed that world Muslims especially 
Muslims of Turkey know very well the "terrorist and unreliable" 
nature of the Zionist regime. Terrorist acts and instability in 
the Middle East began when imperialism implanted the Qods 
[Jerusalem] occupying regime in the heart of Muslim states, it 
said, adding all terrorist-motivated killings originated from 
the Zionist entity. 
  The Iranian Embassy said that Zionist officials by making 
such remarks could never mar the solid and brotherly relations 
between Iran and Turkey.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Satellite Dish"] </F>
  [Text] The use of satellite dishes is among the hottest 
subjects being debated in political and cultural circles of this 
country today. 
  Satellite receivers went up on rooftops of Tehran and other 
big cities with amazing speed in the last two years. The use of 
these dishes, in and of itself, does not constitute a 
reprehensible act, and can even be considered useful in 
disseminating news and information on a global level. The 
disturbing aspect of this mass communications device, however, 
is that it is being used by the West to gradually and subtly 
dilute non-Western cultures and change the prevailing social, 
political, and cultural standards of the Third World. 
  The controversy is not confined only to Western and 
non-Western countries. Europe is up in arms against American 
films and television programs that have saturated the European 
screens and air waves. France is considering putting a limit on 
showing U.S.-made films and programs on French television, 
following the failure of American distributors to voluntarily 
cut down their imports to Europe. 
  The Islamic Republic is justifiably concerned with the 
possible negative effects of this phenomenon and is currently 
debating the best way to counter it. Other Islamic countries, 
including Saudi Arabia and Malaysia, have already decided to ban 
satellite dishes. But the cultural invasion problem will not be 
resolved by the physical removal of satellite receivers, because 
smaller and more powerful satellite antennae are being built and 
it would be next to impossible to detect them short of searching 
every household in the country. 
  Officials charged with the task of finding the solution to 
this problem should first find out when the new and undetectable 
satellite dishes will reach our markets. If it takes more than 
three or four years, then passing legislation banning the device 
may work for at least a few years in keeping unwanted programs 
from entering our households. But if it turns out that the 
arrival of small antennae in our market is only a matter of a 
few months, then the physical removal of the existing dishes 
will serve only to destabilize the society and will contribute 
to a general feeling of uncertainty among the law abiding 
citizens of the Islamic Republic. 
  The long-term and logical way to combat cultural invasion is 
to improve domestic production of films and radio and television 
programs, thereby removing the incentive to watch Western 
products. After successfully averting the West's cultural 
invasion through producing internationally marketable programs, 
we can export our religious values, culture, and art through the 
same medium of communication to the rest of the world. 
  The natural target of Western media moguls who own these 
global networks are the younger generations of the Third World 
population. Iran should invest in this same generation by 
providing them with a proper education which will emphasize the 
richness and beauty of our culture and Islamic heritage that 
throughout our history has acted as an antidote to poisonous 
foreign cultural invasions.

<F P=106> [Interview with Asyut Governor Major General Samih al-Sa'id </F>
by Sami Fahmi in Asyut; date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Fahmi] What is the reason for 
the rising wave of terrorism in Asyut? 
  [Al-Sa'id] The tightening security fist in Asyut and the 
tightening noose around the terrorists have led the latter to 
resort to desperate terrorist operations. What is happening in 
Asyut is similar to swatting a "wasp's nest," when the wasps get 
irritated they will try anything. Everyone should know that 
Asyut is now different than it used to be. The Islamic groups 
do not hold activities in al-Rahmah Mosque, not even weekly 
seminars. Extremist activities have been brought under control. 
There are no longer marches like the ones that were staged 
during the Night of Revelation or during the nights that mark 
the first day of each Hegira month. 
  [Fahmi] Does this mean that the security forces start "the 
action?" 
  [Al-Sa'id] The security organ is in control of the 
situation. 
I do not know what you mean by the word "action." 
  [Fahmi] I mean the security organ takes the initiative by 
raiding the extremists and the terrorist moves are merely a 
"reaction." 
  [Al-Sa'id] What the terrorists are now doing is the result 
of 
their bankruptcy. 
  [Fahmi] How do you explain the calm in the governorates 
neighboring Asyut (al-Minya, Suhaj) and the inflamed situation 
in Asyut? 
  [Al-Sa'id] There are historic factors to consider. We cannot 
ignore the fact that the Islamic groups were first formed in 
Asyut University in the late 1970's and this helped them spread. 
There are also differences between the Islamic groups. Some of 
the terrorist elements that are carrying out terrorist acts in 
Asyut come from Suhaj, al-Wadi al-Jadid, and al-Minya. 
  [Fahmi] What helped the Islamic groups spread in the 1970's, 
as you mentioned? Was there official support? 
  [Al-Sa'id] I cannot answer because I was abroad at the time. 
  [Fahmi] Are the security organs, with their present 
resources 
and power, capable of dealing with terrorism? 
  [Al-Sa'id] The security forces are in control of the 
situation all over the governorate. The security fist is not 
concentrating on one area at the expense of another. Security 
measures are being tightened everywhere. The security organs 
are capable of handling this, but the support of the people is 
necessary. The government is meeting the Interior Ministry's 
demands within the limits of available resources. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Fahmi] Does the situation in Asyut require the armed 
forces' 
help to safeguard the vital installations? 
  [Al-Sa'id] The vital installations are secured according to 
specific guidelines. There is the popular defense, which plays 
a role in defending the installations. The military counselor 
in the governorate leads the popular defense operations in 
accordance with established plans and targets. 
  [Fahmi] Some people are saying that armed forces' 
intervention might be necessary to control the explosive 
situation. 
  [Al-Sa'id] It is my personal view that we will not reach 
this 
point. I have great hopes for the popular action that is 
confronting terrorism and the support being given to the 
security forces in Asyut so that the situation will be decided 
in favor of society's security and stability. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Commentary by Muhammad Sharaf: "Is There a Cure to the </F>
Pains of a Slow but Jittery Peace Process?"] 
  [Text] Escalation in Palestinian-Israeli violence over the 
past few weeks and the clear defiance with which both sides 
greeted security measures and precautions are, undeniably, a 
consequence of the Hebron massacre. Defiance of security 
measures and precautions was noticeable in both the Palestinian 
and Israeli sides. 
  Two bus attacks in Israel--the most recent one yesterday, 
left six dead and many wounded--may give fodder to the 
pro-Israeli propaganda machine. Despite that, a careful 
analysis of the consequences of the Hebron massacre reveals a 
worrying fact. Extremists on both sides are currently trying to 
take the law in their own hands and impose their antipeace 
agenda on everyone else. 
  The escalation in violence and bloodshed may at first glance 
appear to be a direct consequence of the Hebron massacre. But a 
deeper and more worrying reason is in play. The peace process 
has had a rough ride, not least because of the lack of 
commitment to the dates stipulated in the Declaration of 
Principles and the Gaza- Jericho agreement. 
  It is no secret to anyone following the scene closely that 
the Declaration of Principles and the Gaza-Jericho agreement 
failed to satisfy a significant segment of Palestinian and Arab 
public opinion, due to their failure to satisfy some Palestinian 
demands. 
  Still, we have to remember that the existing agreement was 
just a starting point and that what matters is what follows this 
agreement in terms of comprehensive self-rule and the final 
status of the occupied territories. 
  The Israeli side has introduced certain complications that 
resulted in the failure to meet the proposed date of full 
withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho: Wednesday 13 April, yesterday. 
It came and went without the withdrawal having even begun. 
  This and other factors combined to produce the recent 
deterioration in the situation and to endanger the entire peace 
process. The peace process is in danger. Its jitters are due 
partly to the slow pace with which it is proceeding and partly 
to the fact that doubts about Israel's intentions are reaching a 
higher and more worrying plateau. 
  Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Foreign Minister 
Shim'on Peres promised, after the distressing bus attack in 
Israel two days ago, that they will not allow such incidents to 
hinder the peace process. Earlier, Prime Minister Rabin made a 
statement to the effect that no dateline is sacred concerning 
the practical steps involved in the peace process. 
  At a time when matters have come to a head, it would be 
wrong 
to question the integrity of either side. But recent events, 
the general climate of the peace process, and the differences 
facing the implementation of the existing agreements are a cause 
for doubts, justified or imagined. 
  Despite that, there are other statements by the Israeli 
prime 
minister disseminated in the media today. These statements are 
extremely important and give cause for some optimism amid the 
discouragement created by the recent acts of mutual violence and 
fomented by the slow and unsure pace of Palestinian-Israeli 
talks. Most important of the Israeli prime minister's remarks, 
which he made in a press interview, is his expression of 
willingness to remove the Israeli settlements in the occupied 
territories in return for a final agreement with the 
Palestinians. Rabin, however, pointed out that the security of 
the settlements should be guaranteed during the self-rule period. 
  This Israeli statement leaves one question unanswered, 
however. Can guarantees for the security of the settlements be 
reconciled with the Palestinians' exercise of the self-rule 
authority in the commonly accepted sense of the word? 
  Having said all this, we wish to make it clear that there is 
a dire need for a faster pace, a stronger commitment, and 
clearer positions on all tracks of the peace process.

  [Text] Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa today met Libya's envoy 
to the Arab League, Ibrahim al-Bishari. 
  Afterward, al-Bishari stated that they discussed bilateral 
relations and Arab and international issues of common interest 
within the framework of the excellent ties between Egypt and 
Libya. 
  On the Libyan-Western crisis, al-Bishari said Libya regrets 
the Security Council's renewal of the unfair sanctions imposed 
on it in accordance with Resolution 748. 
  The Libyan envoy added that the Arab League is undertaking 
an 
Arab initiative based on the resolution issued at the last 
meeting of the Arab League Council. He said that if this 
initiative is accepted, it will lead to a response to Security 
Council Resolution 731, will satisfy the judicial cooperation 
involving all the parties, will protect the rights of everyone, 
including the Western countries, and will protect Libya's right 
and sovereignty. 
  He noted that the initiative calls for the trial of the 
defendants in accordance with Scottish law and before a Scottish 
court sitting in the International Court of Justice. He said: 
We have not yet heard the West's official view of this 
proposal. He expressed the hope that this proposal would be 
taken seriously and objectively because it would be a way out 
for everyone. He said the Arab League secretary general has 
conveyed the Arab initiative to the ambassadors of the three 
Western countries.

  [Text] Cairo, 14 Apr (MENA)--President Muhammad Husni 
Mubarak is following events in Rwanda with grave concern and 
deep regret, especially because of the hardships faced by the 
fraternal Rwandan people as security deteriorates. President 
Mubarak is motivated by close Egyptian-Rwandan ties and his 
position as chairman of the OAU. 
  The remarks came in a statement issued by the Egyptian 
Foreign Ministry today. 
  The statement announced that Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa 
communicated with OAU Secretary General Salim Ahmed Salim on the 
possible steps the OAU can take to contain the deteriorating 
situation in Rwanda. 
  The statement reported that the committee in charge of 
solving inter-African disputes will meet in Addis Ababa today 
chaired by an Egyptian representative to discuss the dangerous 
events in Rwanda. 
  The statement continued: The Government of the Arab Republic 
of Egypt appeals to all Rwandan parties to exercise 
self-restraint, accept an immediate cease-fire, and create the 
appropriate conditions for relief organizations to carry out 
their humanitarian mission. It also urges these parties to 
immediately resume their efforts to implement the Arosha 
Agreement so as to attain stability and peace in the country. 
  The Egyptian ambassador and Embassy staff in Kigali have 
been 
instructed to leave Rwanda temporarily in light of the dangers 
they are facing there and the extreme deterioration in security.

  [Text] Cairo, 15 Apr (MENA)--Finance Minister Dr. Muhammad 
Ahmad al-Razzaz has said that 30 agreements have been signed 
with other countries to avoid dual taxation. 
  In a statement to MENA, he said discussion is under way to 
sign agreements between Egypt and Indonesia and Singapore on 
avoiding dual taxation to consolidate relations and economic 
ties. He added that the agreement concluded on Tuesday with the 
United Arab Emirates [UAE] and signed by the UAE minister of 
state for financial and industrial affairs, Ahmad Bin-Humayyid 
al-Tayir, is one of the most modern examples of agreements on 
avoiding dual taxation and dealing with every means of handling 
taxes on sources of income. 
  Al-Razzaz said the Finance Ministry will submit the draft 
state budget for 1994-95 to the People's Assembly at the end of 
April to be debated by the Assembly in May, adding that it will 
come into force on 1 July. 
  He said the preliminary estimates for the budget this year 
amount to 83 billion pounds and that the value of wages is 
approximately 12.8 billion pounds, a 2.2 billion-pound-increase 
on the current fiscal year, which ends at the end of June. The 
target budget deficit is 4.2 percent. Inflation is 2.8 percent 
and state revenues amount to 40.3 billion pounds, a 
15-percent-increase on the previous year.

  [Text] Tunis, 15 Apr (MENA)--A high-ranking Palestinian 
source has said that PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli 
Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin will sign an agreement on the 
implementation of the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of 
Principles in Cairo in early May. 
  The source, who supervised the Palestinian delegation to the 
latest round of negotiations, said agreement on many issues has 
been reached with the Israelis. These include the size and 
deployment of the Palestinian police force, linking the 
deployment of the force and the Israeli pullout of Gaza and 
Jericho with the release of Palestinian detainees and civil 
affairs, the source said. 
  Geographic jurisdiction and the judiciary system in the 
Palestinian autonomous region are now being discussed, the 
source added. 
  The source said 'Arafat will enter Gaza and Jericho in late 
June or early July at the latest. 
  He said there is an agreement within the PLO leadership that 
the Political Department, led by Faruq Qaddumi, and the Arab and 
International Department, led by Mahmud 'Abbas, remain in Tunis. 
  Informed Palestinian sources said the readiness expressed by 
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin yesterday to dismantle some 
settlements in the occupied territories as part of efforts to 
achieve a permanent peace with the Palestinians constitutes a 
serious beginning toward ending over 50 years of enmity. 
  The sources expressed a belief that the recent operations in 
'Afula and Hadera, in which many Israelis were killed, will give 
the negotiations more momentum than expected. 
  Other Palestinian sources said the recent telephone 
conversation between Rabin and 'Arafat dealt with some aspects 
of the Declaration of Principles, especially the pressing 
Palestinian desire to get the negotiations into their final 
stage. The sources said that many sides are now making efforts 
toward this end. They added that 'Arafat expressed his full 
preparedness to enter into this final stage.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with King Husayn by Marc Guillet in </F>
Amman; date not given: "Husayn Concerned About Peace in the 
Middle East -- Says `Hope Has Faded'"] 
  [Excerpts] Amman -- "The extremists will gain successes if 
we fail," according to King Husayn of Jordan. The king, who 
always picks his words carefully and talks cautiously, could not 
be clearer. 
  He is concerned, pessimistic, and bitter about the slow 
progress of the peace negotiations. The Hashemite monarch no 
longer intends to gloss over things using polite diplomatic 
language. 
  On the day when Palestinian autonomy should have started and 
Muslim terrorists from Hamas had caused another bloodbath in a 
bomb attack in Israel, the king predicted "a disaster for 
everyone unless we make progress quickly." 
  He warned of serious consequences if the violence of Jewish 
and Palestinian extremists continued and the peace process 
continued to not deliver results. 
  [Husayn] At the start there was so much optimism and hope 
that the roots of the instability in the whole region would 
finally be tackled quickly and efficiently. I believe that too 
much time has been wasted without concrete results being 
achieved. [Husayn ends] [passage omitted] 
  While Circassians, armed with swords and dressed in their 
traditional black clothing, guard the doors of the meeting room, 
King Husayn said that we were unfortunately witnessing a 
"worrying" development. 
  [Husayn] A new mood of hope which was created with the start 
of the peace conference in Madrid resulted in a new large-scale 
movement for peace. Of course there were opponents, but at that 
time they were in the minority. 
  The hopes for peace have faded due to a lack of progress and 
the tragic events which have claimed many lives. I believe that 
the bloodbath in Hebron for example was an attempt to kill off 
the peace process. The violence and the counter-violence are 
tragic. To stop that, I would suggest moving forward as quickly 
as possible to reach a peace which future generations can also 
live with. I regret and condemn all the violence from whatever 
side, but I hope that the causes of despair will disappear and 
that hope will be reborn again as quickly as possible. [Husayn 
ends] [passage omitted] 
  When asked about the major cause of the lack of progress in 
the peace process, he lit another cigarette. After a marked 
pause, he started his answer hesitantly. "There are various 
causes," he said. "We have seen that attention is constantly 
shifting from one subject to another. Of course the 
negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians are the most 
important, but there is less attention on the other questions 
than there should be. That is not the right approach. Due to 
the fact that we must work toward an all-inclusive peace, 
progress should be made on all fronts." 
  King Husayn stressed that it nevertheless makes little 
sense, 
as Israel wants, to make a peace agreement while negotiations on 
the content of the agreement were continuing and little progress 
was being made. "Peace comes to crown agreements which have 
been made about every aspect on the agenda," he said. 
  On the Jordanian side, there is clearly less enthusiasm for 
continuing along the present road as long as Israel refuses to 
talk about its borders and the allocation of the scarce water 
sources and as long as the blockade of 'Aqaba harbor by the U.S. 
Navy continues. 
  "We do not understand why we are treated differently," the 
king said about the blockade, which is the result of the 
international trade embargo against Iraq after the Gulf War. 
"The special treatment gives the impression that we are not 
following the Security Council's resolutions with regard to 
Iraq. If people want to pressure us, we wonder what their goal 
is. We are implementing the resolutions. Are we being punished 
because we did not send soldiers for the war against Iraq? Or 
do some people in the region want us to end up in a situation 
where we can hardly survive? Is itan attempt to make us fall? 
Is it an attempt to seriously damage our relations with the 
people of Iraq? Why Jordan? Because Jordan is the only country 
which borders Iraq? This situation is unacceptable. We act 
against attempts to evade the UN embargo. Pressure on us will 
achieve nothing." 
  [Guillet] Do you think that extremists on both sides have 
enough support to derail the peace process? 
  [Husayn] There are extremists who do not understand what is 
at stake if peace is impossible. Extremism is fed by 
frustration, anger, and a lack of hope. If we do not change 
that very quickly, then the consequences will be very serious. 
The overwhelming majority of the people must regain hope by 
concrete progress. 
  [Guillet] PLO Chairman 'Arafat refused personally to condemn 
the bloodbath in 'Afula. What advice would you give to him 
after the latest attack in Israel? 
  [Husayn] I do not want to give him any advice. I hope he 
realizes the importance of what he is doing.

  [Text] In the Pondicherry assembly, the entire opposition 
consisting of the AIADMK [All India Anna Dravida Munnetra 
Kazhagam], DMK [Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam], CPI [Communist Party 
of India], and Janata Dal staged a walkout today following the 
deputy speaker's refusal to admit an adjournment motion. The 
motion tabled by CPI and Janata Dal members sought to discuss 
the signing of the GATT agreement. The deputy speaker, Mr. A.B. 
Subramaniam, while refusing permission for the motion said that 
the subject does not come under the purview of the union 
territory's assembly. The lone CPI member attended the session 
with a black towel on his shoulders to protest the signing of 
the GATT accord today. 
  In Kerala, the 12-hour statewide bundh [strike] called by 
the 
CPI-ML [Communist Party of India-Marxist Leninist] today evoked 
little response. Barring some minor incidents of stone 
throwing, the bundh was by and large peaceful. Some shops and 
business establishments remained closed. However, traffic plied 
as usual. The bundh call was given in protest against India 
signing the GATT agreement.

<F P=106> [News conference by Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz with </F>
unidentified correspondents at Lebanese Foreign Ministry in 
Beirut on 14 April--recorded] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] What measure will the Foreign 
Ministry take if it transpires that the two diplomats from the 
embassy assassinated Iraqi oppositionist Talib Suhayl? 
  [Buwayz] First, we should state what happened. On Tuesday 
[word indistinct], when Talib Suhayl, holder of a Jordanian 
passport but of Iraqi origin, was at home, two people entered 
masquerading as clothes merchants, fired from guns fitted with 
silencers, and escaped. The Internal Security Forces were 
informed and set up checkpoints. Based on a description of the 
cars [used by the attackers], the Internal Security Forces 
arrested people intending to enter the Iraqi Embassy on 
Wednesday morning. They were carrying guns equipped with 
silencers, the guns that were used in the shooting. The two men 
were identified as Khalid 'Alwan Khalaf, a trade attache in the 
Iraqi Embassy, and Muhammad Kamil Kazim, a cultural attache in 
the same embassy. It seems that Hadi Hasan, who has no official 
status, gained entry to the Iraqi Embassy. These are the facts. 
  The Lebanese authorities have taken measures to guard these 
people and to obtain the information necessary to conduct an 
investigation into this criminal case. As for the political and 
diplomatic aspects, the Foreign Ministry will soon request that 
the Iraqi charge d'affaires in Lebanon lift the diplomatic 
immunity of the two attaches and hand over Hadi Hasan to the 
Lebanese judicial authorities to investigate him. 
  Lebanon cannot be exploited, under diplomatic cover or the 
cover of diplomatic immunity, as a stage for settling scores and 
carrying out crimes. Based on that, the Lebanese Government 
insists on conducting investigations and uncovering every 
circumstance of this crime. 
  [Correspondent] If Iraq does not respond, will Lebanon 
break off relations with it? 
  [Buwayz] I believe it is premature to speculate on how 
things 
will develop. Today we will officially ask the Iraqi Embassy to 
inform the Iraqi Government of the Lebanese Government's request 
that the diplomatic immunity of the two be lifted and that the 
third suspect be handed over. 
  [Correspondent] Did the Iraqi foreign minister try to 
telephone you again today after failing to reach you yesterday? 
  [Buwayz] No direct contact has been held yet. The Iraqi 
Embassy gave us a memorandum asking that the two people be 
released on the basis of their immunity and international norms. 
We are saying that they are under guard for their own security 
first and in line with the requirements of public order second. 
We think the interrogations dictate such handling. 
  [Correspondent] [Words indistinct] the Lebanese charge 
d'affaires in Iraq? 
  [Buwayz] We recalled the Iraqi charge d'affaires at the 
Lebanese Embassy in Baghdad yesterday morning. In the evening 
he joined our embassy in Jordan and this morning he was at the 
Foreign Ministry for contacts and consultations. 
  [Correspondent] Is this the first step toward closing the 
Lebanese Embassy in Baghdad? 
  [Buwayz] I think it is useless to make predictions. All this 
depends on the extent of the Iraqi Embassy's cooperation with 
the Lebanese authorities. 
  [Correspondent] Was the atmosphere of the meeting with the 
Iraqi charge d'affaires positive? [words indistinct] 
  [Buwayz] The Iraqi charge d'affaires said he had no 
knowledge 
of what happened. Today he was summoned by the Foreign 
Ministry's secretary general, who will inform him of the 
Lebanese Government's decision in this regard. 
  [Correspondent] [Question indistinct] 
  [Buwayz] No. The victim is an Iraqi national holding 
Jordanian and Saudi passports. 
  [Correspondent] [Words indistinct] in Amman? 
  [Buwayz] No. We are not aware of this. Thank you.

  [Text] Malaysia will continue its unilateral 
liberalization policy in the financial services sector at a pace 
dictated by the national policy objectives to ensure foreign 
participation. International Trade and Industry Minister Datuk 
Sri Rafidah Aziz said Malaysia's offer of financial services was 
significant given the already high foreign presence in financial 
services sector. She said this was a result of Malaysia's 
unilateral liberalization measure, implemented even before the 
Uruguay Round talks. 
  She made those remarks at the Marrakech ministerial meeting 
on the Uruguay Round talks in Marrakech last night. About 120 
trade ministers from around the world have gathered in the 
Moroccan city to sign a landmark agreement on the final act of 
the trade talks, [words indistinct] of agreement. Malaysia 
[words indistinct] was committed to an open and strong 
multilateral trading system and attached much importance to 
[words indistinct] multilateral trade negotiations. Datuk Sri 
Rafidah said the conclusion of the Uruguay Round marked another 
important milestone in international economic cooperation and 
provided the foundation for strengthening an open trading 
system. It is a signal to the world that multilateral [words 
indistinct] is a universally acceptable trading norm and the 
successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round is indeed timely.

  [Text] The meetings of the subcommittee charged with 
studying ways of sending relief aid to those in need in the 
south under the supervision of the Intergovernmental Authority 
on Drought and Development [IGADD] Mediation Committee were 
suspended in Nairobi yesterday afternoon until 3 May. 
  The participants, who included the Sudanese Government 
delegation and that of the rebel movement, as well as the 
representatives of the four mediating IGADD states and the 
official in charge of Operation Lifeline Sudan, suspended the 
meetings after the delegation of Garang's faction refused to 
sign the draft agreement in its final form, having expressed 
some reservations. The participants in the meetings had 
concentrated on discussing various views on the ways by which 
relief aid could be dispatched to a number of areas, protecting 
and supervising the routes to be taken in sending the aid and 
vaccinating children in the south against infectious diseases. 
  A diplomatic source stated that the Sudanese Government 
delegation had shown great understanding during the negotiations 
on cooperating with the mediating team on most of the proposals 
put forward by the latter. The government delegation made it 
clear right from the beginning that it had no objection 
whatsoever to any citizen in the south being given food, 
irrespective of his orientation.

  [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin demands that Jordan 
put an end to the activities of the Hamas [Islamic Resistance 
Movement] office in Amman. Speaking to reporters on 
Independence Day, Rabin said that the Amman office is closely 
linked with the terrorist acts of Hamas in Israel, and that 
Israel holds the Jordanian Government responsible for anything 
that happens on Jordanian soil: 
  [Begin Rabin recording] Whoever watched closely the reaction 
and the action of the Hamas after carrying two murderous attacks 
in 'Afula and Hadera on peaceful Israeli people, could not but 
realize that all the spokesmanship, all the statements to the 
whole world came from the office of Hamas in Amman, headed by 
Muhammad Nazzal, that almost every day appears on television and 
other means of the media. We are fully aware that today the 
Hamas focal center of assistance to the Palestinians, to the 
Hamas, among the Palestinians in the territories, expresses 
every statement about murderous activities, threatens how many 
more, everything is done from the office of the Hamas in Amman 
[sentence as heard]. 
  Without elaborating we believe there are other lines of 
communication and assistance between this center of Hamas in 
Amman and the activities of Hamas in the territories and attacks 
on targets in Israel. We have good relations in practical terms 
with Jordan along the border. We are interested in the 
continuation of the peace negotiations with Jordan, but Israel 
cannot tolerate the continuation of Amman being a paradise for 
the activities of the Hamas from Amman. Therefore we would like 
to make it clear to the Government of Jordan, that we see this 
government responsible to whatever happens on its sovereign 
soil, and we would like to make it clear that this situation 
cannot continue. It's the responsibility of the Government of 
Jordan on one hand to continue the peace negotiations that we 
are interested in, and at the same time to prevent that the 
Hamas will have freedom of activities in Amman, in speaking, 
expressing the Hamas policies, issuing all the statements, and 
threatens what will happen in the future. [end recording] 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0405 GMT on 15 April, 
reporting on Rabin's and Foreign Minister Peres' news conference 
on Hamas activity from Jordan, carries a passage in which Peres 
is recorded as saying: "I have never encountered a case in which 
a country purportedly striving toward peace allows a 
representative of a murderous organization to publicly assume 
responsibility for two murderous attacks and announce its 
intention to carry out three more such attacks. He said this 
openly on television without any reaction, as though it is a 
natural thing. We know that Jordan is exerting efforts to guard 
the border, but there is another border which must be seen to: 
the border of murder and terrorism. We regard this message with 
all possible seriousness and firmness -- it takes precedence 
over everything else. I, like the prime minister, hope that 
Jordan implements all the necessary measures as soon as 
possible."] 
  Our diplomatic reporter Jack Katzenell points out that 
Israel 
has issued similar warnings to Jordan several times in recent 
years following cross-border raids by terrorists, usually 
Islamic fundamentalists. It's always been Israel's position 
that Jordan is responsible for anything that happens on or from 
its soil. However, Israel has never taken military action 
against Jordan in the wake of these warnings. When the Likud 
government was in power such action was demanded repeatedly by 
one of the most prominent figures in Prime Minister Shamir's 
party, Ari'el Sharon, but Shamir pointedly ignored Sharon's 
demands.

  [Text] The security forces have detained two Hamas 
[Islamic Resistance Movement] leaders from the Gaza Strip -- 
Nidal Ruhani and Ghassan al-Siyam -- and fifteen activists from 
'Izz-al-Din al- Qassam, the military arm of Hamas. 
  Our correspondent Moti Amir reports that in an operation in 
the al-Shati' refugee camp and Gaza city, which lasted several 
days and nights, the security forces detained Nidal Ruhani and 
Ghassan al-Siyam, and 15 more Hamas members were detained in the 
course of the two men's interrogation. Following a search of 
their homes, large sums of money, documents, and other materiel 
were seized, and it was learned that they were key elements in 
the Hamas operations against the security forces in the Strip. 
  Brigadier General Doron Almog, the IDF [Israel Defense 
Forces] commander in the Gaza Strip, commended the Shin Bet 
personnel and the other security forces for the capture of the 
Hamas members.

<F P=106> [Interview with Counselor Muhammad Sa'id al-'Ashmawi, </F>
"retired" court president and Islamic writer, by Majdi Hasanayn; 
place and date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Hasanayn] How would you 
explain Saudi criticism of you and your books, especially as the 
control of media organs by some Saudi circles raises questions? 
  [Al-'Ashmawi] Saudi Arabia, in the Arab and Islamic 
countries, follows the same method that Zionism used to control 
the economy, media, and press of the United States and Europe. 
With this, Saudi Arabia seeks to control the minds, eyes, and 
ears of the Arab nation, with particular interest in Egypt. So 
it buys people to use against Egypt, whether directly or 
indirectly, particularly to promote the Wahhabite doctrine in 
Egypt. 
  [Hasanayn] Does this mean we are living the Saudi era and 
that Egypt's role and leadership have shrunk? 
  [Al-'Ashmawi] I cannot say that Egypt has lost its role. But 
we notice this Saudi trend of trying to control the affairs of 
the Arab world, particularly Egypt, whether by buying writers or 
exploiting institutions and maneuvering them from behind the 
stage. 
  [Hasanayn] We seek to establish sound inter-Arab relations 
that can enable us to face world challenges. But are Saudi 
hands financing terrorism in Egypt? 
  [Al-'Ashmawi] No question. Clearly, some Saudi circles and 
individuals finance terrorism in Egypt and support some 
preachers here and there. I believe the Egyptian Government 
knows of this and occasionally tries to draw Saudi officials' 
attention to the issue calmly. But Saudi Arabia tries to clear 
itself of this charge by claiming that the financing comes from 
the private sector. Some people wonder about this because in 
Saudi Arabia there is no private or public sector. A recent 
announcement regarding a Bin-Ladin family member who lives in 
Sudan and who is accused of financing terrorism and the naming 
of three Ladin sons who work in a private security firm that 
tried to infiltrate Egyptian security are the best proof that 
what I am saying is true. 
  I could confirm that there is covert cooperation among Saudi 
Arabia, U.S. intelligence, and Israeli intelligence--whether 
Saudi Arabia knows of the consequences of this or not--to 
finance terrorism in Egypt and throughout the region. Foreign 
magazines have published reports that U.S. intelligence financed 
over 100 Islamic conferences attended by extremists. In 
collaboration with the Mosad, U.S. intelligence encouraged the 
extremist movements, which are called Islamic, to promote 
Islamic nationalism to counter pan-Arabism. Some continue to 
encourage extremists in Egypt with a view to weakening it for 
the next 10 years. From their point of view, this will be 
enough to virtually freeze its role as a leading country in the 
region for over a century. [passage omitted] 
  [Hasanayn] Some people believe the confrontation with 
Israel as the main enemy of the Arab nation must be based on the 
religious state, as is the case with Israel itself. How do you 
view this issue? 
  [Al-'Ashmawi] I mentioned before in my book Political 
Islam that the establishment of the State of Israel was one 
of the most important causes behind the spread of extremism in 
Egypt and the Arab world. But I hope it is now understood that 
Islamic extremism serves Israel's goals by distorting the image 
of Islam and weakening the Egyptian state, the natural leader of 
the Arab nation. The cultural way is the right course for 
confronting the State of Israel. The struggle between us and 
Israel is not a fundamentalist one. It is a cultural one. If 
we do not master every factor of culture, then Israel will win. 
I stress that Islamic extremism is enhancing Israel's position 
in the world and giving it the golden opportunity to distort 
Islam and make Egypt backward. 
  [Hasanayn] What is your view of the slogans of freedom and 
democracy that some of political Islam's groups are raising and 
that are demanding that authority be rotated through free 
elections? 
  [Al-'Ashmawi] They claim this because most Arab and Islamic 
governments are totalitarian. These groups seek to attract the 
ordinary people and the opposition to their ranks. They also 
want to address foreign circles and international human rights 
organizations. But they want democracy to destroy democracy 
through democracy and spoil freedom through freedom. For these 
groups, democracy means one voice for one man and once only. 
When they attain power, they will eliminate every democratic 
movement, because their nature is totalitarian, not democratic. 
They believe sovereignty does not belong to the people and that 
the people have no right to legislate for themselves. These are 
antidemocratic views. This was declared by Ali Belhadj, the 
second man in the Islamic Salvation Front [FIS] in Algeria, 
after the first round of elections, when he said democracy is 
blasphemy. This compelled the Algerian Army to confront the FIS 
outside the framework of democracy, which the FIS believes to be 
blasphemy. In Egypt, the religious extremist leaders have often 
said that democracy is blasphemy. Dozens of leaflets are found 
on the pavements confirming this. When they talk of democracy, 
they are voicing that which they do not believe in and following 
the method of al-Taqiyyah, which is one of the pillars of the 
Shiite sect [allowing followers to hide their religion to escape 
persecution], to which the groups of political Islam resort.

  [Text] Baghdad, 17 Apr (INA) -- President Saddam Husayn has 
expressed his confidence that the downing of two U.S. 
helicopters in northern Iraq on 14 April is linked with an evil 
scheme prepared in advance by Washington, London, and Paris. 
Addressing a number of fighters, who participated in the 
liberation of al-Faw City six years ago, his excellency revealed 
that the ambassadors of the United States, Britain, and France 
summoned Iraq's representative at the United Nations on the day 
in which the incident involving the two planes took places and 
informed him that their countries would patrol the Zakho-Fa'idah 
highway without revealing the purpose of this. 
  The president noted that a memorandum from the Foreign 
Ministry following the meeting between Iraq's representative and 
the three ambassadors indicated that the language of the 
ambassadors was hopeful and reassuring and that the objective of 
their countries' deployment of the patrol was not provocative 
and that they have no intention of waging a confrontation with 
Iraq. 
  His Excellency President Saddam Husayn emphasized that the 
meeting among the ambassadors of the United States, Britain, and 
France and the ambassador of Iraq at the United Nations took 
place following instructions from their governments. He said 
the meeting was designed to serve an evil action whose nature he 
hoped will be become clear later. He said the meeting must have 
had a connection with those who were aboard the two downed 
helicopters. 
  His excellency pointed to the questions that were raised by 
many political observers about the mission of the helicopters, 
the identity and specialty of those who were on board, and what 
they may have had been carrying. 
  His excellency the president called the downing of the 
American helicopters by American fighters a scandal that has 
exposed a moral, spiritual, practical, and humanitarian weakness 
in the nations of the alliance led by Washington. 
  His excellency the president drew attention to the 
objectives 
of the enemy circles and the intentions they had in common with 
the media and propaganda organizations they control and 
manipulate so as to promote their interests and objectives. He 
said the premeditated goal of the operation became apparent as 
soon as the incident occurred, when certain suspect radio 
stations put out press statements claiming that Iraqi aircraft 
had downed two American helicopters. 
  His excellency said it was likely that if it were not for 
the 
fact that there were other casualties besides the Americans and 
the fear that the joint inquiry would bring out the facts, the 
media would have stuck to the allegations and used them as 
grounds to level charges against Iraq as they have done in the 
past and continue to do now. 
  President Saddam Husayn recalled the chapters of Iraqi 
confrontation against Iran's hostile scheme and the pictures of 
Iraq's victory over these evil objectives. He said that the 
liberation of al-Faw was the first step on the road to victory. 
He said that the enemies were very concerned with entrenching a 
fact that is alien to Arab heritage, but which they have become 
known for by others recently -- namely, the land that is taken 
from Arabs will not return to them and that Arab armies cannot 
launch counterattacks to liberate their lands. 
  The president concentrated on the role of the Zionist 
quarters in spreading despair among the Arabs. He said that 
Zionism is working in this direction in all its activities and 
moves, and with all its branches and potential. 
  The president stressed that the liberation of al-Faw foiled 
all these false theories. He said: For the first time in 
contemporary Arab history an Arab country liberated its land 
without any political bargains or compromises. This was 
achieved in the liberation of al-Faw. 
  President Saddam Husayn added: Al-Faw was the beginning, 
where wills clashed. A city was liberated without any political 
intervention or foreign factors. Victories were then achieved 
when every inch on which the aggressors encroached was liberated. 
  His excellency shed light on the military lesson 
crystallized 
by Iraqi determination on the ground of confrontation against 
the Iranian enemy to liberate al-Faw and every inch of Iraq's 
territory. He said: No army, in a long war, can claim that its 
enemy will not achieve any victories on the front because the 
enemy can become stronger and superior and can benefit from 
other factors that will take this army by surprise. 
  In light of this lesson, His Excellency President Saddam 
Husayn urged the commanders not to belittle any field action, 
combat front, or move no matter how small. He underscored that 
it is these small moves and steps that add up to the final 
result. 
  His excellency the president cautioned, however, that the 
forest should not be overlooked for the trees, and that small 
factors should not distract the commander from the determination 
that the final strategy and results must be to his advantage. 
He reaffirmed the importance of handling small moves on the 
front on the basis of this overall strategy. 
  His excellency the president expressed his confidence that 
the practical implementation of this concept is possible not 
only in the military field, but that it is also possible to 
translate this concept into practice in the areas of politics, 
economics, social life, and security matters. 
  His Excellency President Saddam Husayn expressed his faith 
and conviction that the leadership in Iraq is capable of 
effecting changes in the overall situation if the pressure 
increases and the situation becomes vulnerable. If such a thing 
were to happen, the Iraqi leadership, the president added, would 
also be capable of introducing new factors into the picture, 
factors that could absorb any additional elements that might be 
brought into play by the enemy. 
  His excellency the president expressed his full confidence 
in 
the future of the confrontation between Iraq and the U.S.-led 
alliance, saying that the enemies' anti-Iraq posture can be 
likened to a man seizing the sword by its blade. When the owner 
of the sword pulls the sword forcefully, the adversary will find 
himself compelled to either release his grip around the sword or 
risk losing his fingers. In either case, he will have to release 
the sword.

  [Text] Baghdad, 16 Apr (INA) -- BABIL has stated that our 
people and the international community as a whole must remain 
fully alert in order to confront the U.S. insinuations and 
designs aimed at harming Iraq by all possible means, both inside 
and outside the UN Security Council. 
  In an article today, the paper says that the incident 
involving two helicopters in Iraqi Kurdistan demonstrates to the 
entire world the nature of the complicated and dangerous 
situation faced by that dear part of Iraq under the coalition 
troops. It says that this situation requires the employment of 
all possible political means to secure the withdrawal of the 
aggressors from the region and the return of the Iraqi state to 
Kurdistan in order to help our Kurdish people and serve peace 
and security in the entire region. 
  BABIL adds that, since the latest UN Security Council 
session 
on so-called human rights, the United States has been engaged in 
a systematic campaign against Iraq and has accused it of 
masterminding attacks against UN officials and observers in 
Kurdistan. This is despite Iraq's repeated denials of such 
allegations. This proves Washington's premeditated intentions 
against Iraq, especially to carry out a fresh aggression against 
Iraq, perhaps without referring to the Security Council.

  [Text] Baghdad, 16 Apr (INA) -- AL-'IRAQ has stressed that 
after the shooting down of two of its own helicopters in 
northern Iraq, the United States has begun to reap the fruits of 
its erroneous policy and flagrant and rejected interference in 
Iraq's domestic affairs in cooperation with its allies. 
  In an article published today, the newspaper says that this 
incident in northern Iraq, where foreign troops are deployed in 
an illegitimate and illegal manner without any logical or legal 
justification, means that the situation prevailing in that area 
is one of confusion, lawlessness, and disorder, especially in 
light of the absence of a central authority capable of halting 
the security deterioration or curbing the dangerous phenomena 
there. 
  The paper adds that if wrong premises lead to wrong 
conclusions, then any fair analyst must now be aware of the size 
of the crime that the United States has committed against our 
people in the autonomous region when it embraced the gangs and 
highway robbers there and sponsored their subversive activities 
against innocent citizens, thus depriving them of any sense of 
security, stability, and dignity. 
  AL-'IRAQ explains that in light of the unstable situation in 
the northern areas where foreign troops are deployed or 
controlled by agents and mercenaries, it is important to 
emphasize that circumstances of this kind must lead to many 
mistakes of the kind which led to the downing of two U.S. 
helicopters by U.S. warplanes. 
  Concluding its article, the paper says that the U.S. 
attempts 
to exploit the situation in the autonomous region to implement 
both overt and covert schemes against our homeland and 
people--both Arabs and Kurds--through employing agents and 
mercenaries to use them as pawns in its conspiratorial game will 
lead to other woes, for as you sow, so will you reap.

  [Text] Baghdad, 16 Apr (INA)--AL-JUMHURIYAH has said that 
the American mindset, which accepts the unhesitating and hasty 
killing of the children of other peoples, is behind the shooting 
down of the two U.S. helicopters in northern Iraq. 
  In an article today on the downing of the two helicopters, 
the paper adds that deteriorating morale among U.S. officers, 
which is a traditional flaw in U.S. national security, makes 
them panic and act irrationally whenever they have doubts about 
the existence of an enemy force. U.S. propaganda and media 
incitement against Iraq added to the U.S. officers panic, thus 
making them act hastily, killing 26 Americans and Europeans, who 
they mistook for people of another nationality -- which would 
make it okay to kill them. 
  The paper adds: As in previous cases when he lied to 
Congress, Clinton this time tried to peddle another lie among 
the U.S. public to justify this incident and to contain any 
negative repercussions. He claimed that the dead were on a 
humanitarian mission assigned to them by the United Nations. 
However, the United Nations did not wait long to answer, 
immediately responding that it had nothing to do with the 
mission nor had it asked anybody to undertake this mission. 
The United Nations also said that the two helicopters received 
orders from the United States.

  [Text] Staff Field Marshal President Saddam Husayn, 
commander in chief of the Armed Forces, has met with several 
heroic fighters and officials who had the honor of taking part 
in the execution of Operation Blessed Ramadan, the operation 
carried out to liberate al- Faw, the city of sacrifice and the 
gate of great victory. 
  The leader president received the congratulations of the 
heroic fighters at a hall bedecked with the flag of great Iraq. 
The flag had the name of martyr Staff General 'Adnan 
Khayrallah, whose death was a loss to the people and the Armed 
Forces, engraved on it in appreciation of his efforts to build 
the Armed Forces and enable them to defend great Iraq and 
vindicate its sovereignty and territories, and also in 
recognition of the great pioneering role he played in the 
liberation of al-Faw. 
  The president received the great fighters Staff General 
Husayn Kamil Hasan, who was in charge of the Republican Guards; 
Brigadier General 'Abd Hamid Mahmud, who was the president's 
escort; Udayy Saddam Husayn and Qusayy Saddam Husayn, whose 
involvement in the battle was ordered by the leader, may God 
protect him, so they may perform their duties toward the 
homeland; the staff of the Armed Forces General Command; the 
Army Corps and division commanders who had the honor of 
contributing to the liberation of al-Faw; and escorts of his 
excellency the president, may God protect him. 
  The leader president, may God grant him certain victory, 
offered his congratulations on this eternal occasion to the sons 
of his steadfast people, as well as the personnel affiliated 
with his valiant Armed Forces. He recalled this splendid epic 
waged by the Iraqis and the Armed Forces personnel in defense of 
their territories, sovereignty, and independence. He also 
commended their efforts to safeguard land and honor. 
  The president, may God protect him, evoked God's mercy on 
the 
souls of the martyrs who fell on the territory of al-Faw. He 
also expressed his affection for their families, noting 
appreciation for their positions. He said that the state, the 
homeland, and the march are thankful to these patient families. 
  His excellency the president, may God grant him victory, 
delivered a valuable and comprehensive speech, addressing the 
injustice done to Iraqis and Arabs when they were branded as 
people who are incapable of regaining lost territory. 
Nonetheless, al-Faw was the beginning. In al-Faw, there was a 
clash of two wills. And in this clash, one will was defeated 
and a city was liberated without any (?political) move and 
without the intervention of any external factors, the president 
said. 
  In this clash, the aggressive will was [words indistinct]. 
It recognized in writing that it was defeated. It wished that 
it had never lived to see what happened on the war front. 
  His excellency the president, may God protect him, also 
spoke 
on the Iraqis' patience and jihad in the course of their efforts 
to cope with the embargo, reaffirming that the good is coming, 
not because the evildoers intend to remove evil, but rather 
because the evil hand that is gripping the sword by the blade 
will find itself compelled to release the sword's blade when its 
owner pulls it forcefully.

  [Text] Baghdad, 16 Apr (INA) -- The Iraqi National Assembly 
has declared its willingness to discuss all outstanding issues 
with a delegation from the Kuwaiti parliament in the service of 
pan-Arab issues and the interests of the two sides, leading to 
stability and barring dispute. 
  In a statement to INA in reaction to a recent speech by 
Kuwaiti Prime Minister Sa'd al-'Abdallah, Sa'di Mahdi Salih, 
speaker of the Iraqi National Assembly, said: We are ready to 
discuss with a delegation from the Kuwaiti parliament all 
outstanding issues in the service of pan-Arab issues and the 
interests of the two sides, leading to stability and barring 
dispute. Many parties, which have become well known and 
exposed, are seeking to fuel disputes following the Mother of 
Battles. These parties are seeking to increase doubts, 
misgivings, and fears in the ranks of the Arabs and drive the 
rulers of Kuwait to the point of no return in order to serve the 
interests of these parties, including tampering with the 
security of the region, capturing its wealth, and impoverishing 
their peoples. 
  The National Assembly speaker added: We proposed this 
earlier to several Arab states. We suggested a delegation from 
the Kuwaiti parliament visit Iraq. We said we are willing to 
open the door to it and to give it access to all information and 
facts to confirm that claims that Iraq holds Kuwaiti nationals 
are exposed lies and fabrications that have suspect and mean 
political objectives. It has been proven to us that the 
Government of Kuwait did not convey our proposals to the 
parliament because it did not want the parliament to know the 
facts as they exist and to know Iraq's true Arab policy. 
  The National Assembly speaker added: While reiterating 
this proposal, and our seriousness about this issue, we do not 
mind having other Arab parties, to be agreed upon, take part in 
the discussions. We also do not mind an Arab side making 
shuttle tours between us and the Kuwaiti parliament to reach 
mature ideas in this regard and so as not to allow the 
government officials in Kuwait to drive things toward the worst, 
as they did before 2 August 1990. 
  The Kuwaiti heir apparent and prime minister delivered a 
speech a few days ago in which he cited a pack of lies about 
Iraq and its positions. He also spoke about the situation in 
Kuwait. The following is part of what he said: "The world is 
now like a big volcano. We do not know where and when it will 
erupt. Small countries stand fearfully before this terrible 
scene and are looking for a safe haven to avoid the danger of 
fierce storms, preserve their freedom and sovereignty, and 
protect their entity and independence."

  [Text] Baghdad, 17 Apr (INA) -- The political editor of the 
IRAQI NEWS AGENCY has denied in part and parcel the allegations 
published by the Zionist paper THE JERUSALEM POST of 3 April in 
which it claimed that contacts, which it described as "secret 
and important," are being held between Iraq and "Israel" through 
Palestinian and European parties in order to expand what it 
called the scope of the Middle East peace process. 
  The INA political editor commented: The objective of 
propagating such lies is to tarnish the reputation of Iraq and 
its clear, faithful pan-Arab policy, which is not built on the 
basis of rotten corridor deals and narrow interests. 
  The political editor added: Such things are useless attempts 
to peddle exposed lies which no longer fool anybody.

  [Text] Baghdad, 16 Apr (INA) -- The aircraft of the 
U.S.-led anti-Iraq coalition dropped two flares in the afternoon 
of last Tuesday [12 April] on the Ba'shiqah region in Ninawah 
Governorate, 400 km north of Baghdad. 
  INA's correspondent in the governorate cited informed

as saying the two flares burned out before reaching the ground 
without causing any damage.

  [Text] The authorities of tyrant Saddam have added a new 
crime to their record of atrocities with the execution of a 
number of innocent civilians in the marshlands of Maysan. 
  According to our sources, the tyrant's forces waged a 
ferocious attack on the (al-Sukhraydah) area in Maysan. Having 
blockaded the area and kept it under a sustained barrage of 
fire, the forces finally swept over it, killing and wounding 
some inhabitants and arresting others. 
  Our sources say that the tyrant's forces did not stop at 
this 
but executed seven (al-Sukhraydah) inhabitants by firing squads 
in front of their families. Here are the names of the executed 
men: Hulayyil Badr 'Awf al-Bukhaytawi, 'Abbar Juwaysim, Yusuf 
Khaylul al- Sawa'idah, 'Abbas Furayyij, Muhammad Muqashshar 
al-Bukhaytawi, Jawad Kazim al-Bukhaytawi, and Ghazi Lazim 
al-Bukhaytawi. 
  Our sources add that the regime's forces killed livestock 
and 
demolished houses in (al-Sukhraydah) before leaving, then they 
lobbed more shells into the area.

  [Text] Algeria's Central Bank announced today that Algeria 
had officially contacted the Paris Club to reschedule its 
estimated 26-billion dollar foreign debt. 
  The same source clarified that the Paris Club debt 
rescheduling concerned bilateral debts which constitute 60 
percent of Algeria's medium and long-term debts. The bank added 
that indebtedness would decrease by 4 billion dollars during 
this year and by 5 billion dollars over the period of a standby 
agreement with the International Monetary Fund from April until 
March 1995. (Rachid Benhelmi) reports: 
  [Begin (Benhelmi) recording] Algeria's Central Bank 
statement 
said that the Paris Club had been contacted after signing a 
letter of intent with the IMF in order to reschedule Algeria's 
bilateral debts which constitute about 60 percent of total 
medium and long-term debts. They include loans granted and 
guaranteed by governments or creditors' governmental 
institutions. 
  According to the Bank of Algeria, negotiations will start 
soon with international banks to reschedule repayment dates for 
medium-term bank debts. 
  It is expected, according to experts, that the rescheduling 
of payments for bank debts would reduce debt servicing in the 
medium and long-term. 
  Running parallel to these negotiations, discussions with 
some 
multilateral institutions, particularly the World Bank, the 
African Development Bank, the Arab Monetary Fund, the European 
Community, and other main bodies dealing with Algeria -- like 
industrialists and traders -- would take place. It is expected 
that these discussions would lead to clinching additional 
financial reserves to cover requirements in foreign financing. 
  The short-term debts which should be repaid within one year 
or less would not be subject to rescheduling and their interest 
would be paid on time. [end recording]

  [Text] Kuwait, 16 Apr -- Kuwaiti Interior Minister Shaykh 
'Ali Sabah al-Salim al-Sabah said in an interview published 
today that "the Iraqi forces amassed south of Iraq are not far 
from Kuwait," but he reassured citizens that "these forces, 
although they are a cause of disturbance to the Kuwaiti 
authorities, are present -- as has been repeatedly announced -- 
to quell the rebellion in southern Iraq." 
  Shaykh 'Ali Sabah al-Salim al-Sabah told the AL-WATAN 
newspaper in his first interview as interior minister that the 
Ministries of Interior, Defense, and National Guard were 
"prepared to block any possible aggression, especially as these 
forces are operating under joint and clear coordination." 
  Responding to a question on his future plans for the 
Interior 
Ministry, he said "work in the Interior Ministry is different to 
that in defense but the minister is required to work in the 
light of the state's general strategy." 
  "There are many ideas, including developing work in the 
departments, circulating some officials, and finding ways 
capable of handling citizens' dealings as quickly as possible," 
he said. 
  He added, "the ministries and the state's apparatus suffer 
from a shortage of qualified human cadres" and indicated that 
modern equipment would be required to compensate the shortage 
and overcome bureaucracy. 
  Shaykh 'Ali al-Sabah said there were "several ideas to 
develop the work of sentries and village chiefs to find a bigger 
and more comprehensive role for them. 
  "I am not superman and I alone cannot carry out all 
achievements. That is impossible without the intertwining of 
efforts, which would emerge by concentrating on ingraining the 
spirit of responsibility and confidence in security men, be they 
small or large." In that context, he stressed his rejection of 
centralization of the administration. 
  "Kuwait's interest is above any consideration and I will not 
delay in punishing and reprimanding all who try to disturb the 
security of this country and the unity of the people of Kuwait," 
he said. 
  Asked about some security members who sullied their 
positions 
and their work places with their conduct, he said that "this 
matter cannot be considered a phenomenon but there are some 
individual acts that give the security apparatus a bad name and 
we will try to select elements of high skill and abilities to 
carry out excellent performances." 
  He spoke of his wish to establish the principle of every 
citizen being a sentry so that he could, in the future, be 
responsible for his country's security, which was a joint 
responsibility. 
  Asked about tackling the problems of illegal residents and 
the position of Kuwaiti women married to non-Kuwaitis, the 
minister said that he could not go into those two issues at 
present until he had seen all figures and information found in 
reports.

  [Excerpt] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
chairman of the Presidential Council, along with Shaykh 
'Abd-al-Majid al-Zandani, member of the Presidential Council, 
today received brother Zayd Bin-Shakir, chief of the Jordanian 
Royal Hashemite Court and envoy of His Majesty King Husayn 
Bin-Talal of the fraternal Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. 
  The Jordanian envoy conveyed to the brother chairman a 
message from his brother, His Majesty King Husayn Bin-Talal, on 
issues of interest to brotherly relations between the two 
fraternal countries, as well as the efforts [words indistinct] 
made by the brothers in Jordan to bring views closer, contain 
the political crisis, and promote efforts to implement the 
accord document signed in the Jordanian capital, Amman. This is 
meant to safeguard Yemeni unity and democracy. 
  The message stressed the need to preserve unity, since it is 
a national and pan-Arab achievement and a gain for the Yemeni 
people and all the sons of the Arab nation. Yemeni unity is 
also an outstanding achievement amid pan-Arab divisions. The 
message stressed the importance of resorting to dialogue on all 
levels, stopping military and media developments, and activating 
official agencies so they exercise their duties to implement the 
accord document. The message further asserted Jordan's 
willingness to continue to make brotherly efforts and all that 
can help [words indistinct]. [passage omitted including

<F P=106> [Speech by Presidential Council Chairman 'Ali 'Abdallah </F>
Salih at the police academy in Sanaa on 16 April -- recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] All noble patriots must remain 
steadfast. They must define their position toward the elements 
that seek to partition the homeland using desecrated money, 
money that we would have liked to have used on development 
rather than on the purchase of weapons and explosives and 
disturbing public order. This money could have been better 
spent building a hospital or school or treating an incurable 
disease instead of [words indistinct] and disturbing the public 
peace. 
  Dear brothers: We are absolutely confident that all unionist 
patriots of all political organizations and parties -- the 
General People's Congress [GPC], the Yemeni Socialist Party 
[YSP], the Yemeni Reform Grouping, and others -- will place the 
interests of the homeland above all narrow and selfish interests. 
  We would have liked for this crisis not to have been dragged 
out. The struggler 'Abdallah al-Sallal was a martyr of the 
political crisis that was fabricated to redivide the Yemeni 
homeland. This unity was brought about through peaceful and 
democratic means, in which there was no annexation or coercion. 
The unity was the result of prolonged dialogue that went on for 
years and culminated on 22 May 1990, the date that saw an end to 
the division of a homeland into two systems of government and to 
the legacies of imamism and the end of odious colonialism 
throughout the land. We engaged in protracted dialogue long 
enough. Things came to a head on many occasions and we battled 
and conspired against each other long enough. There was the 
1972 war in which the victor was the loser. Then there was the 
second 1979 battle, in which the victor was also the loser. We 
are now working in earnestness and dedication and a sense of 
responsibility to defeat all schemes meant to fuel sedition 
within the ranks of the one Yemeni family. In that effort we 
are aided by all the dedicated unionist patriots of all the 
political groups and parties. We should work together toward 
defeating all these schemes that seek to split the national 
unity and reintroduce partition. The reintroduction of division 
would be a terrible ordeal. Division will not be permitted to 
return. There will not be a return to the state of affairs 
where there were the Democratic People's Republic of Yemen in 
the south and the Yemeni Arab Republic in the north of the 
homeland. That would be a disaster for all sections of this 
people, especially now that we have political pluralism, unity, 
and political parties throughout the country. Neither the GPC, 
nor the Yemeni Reform Grouping, nor the Arab Socialist Ba'th 
Party, nor the Right Party, nor the League of the Sons of Yemen 
Party, nor the Democratic Nasirite Party, nor the YSP, nor any 
other political faction will be custodian in one half of the 
homeland or the other. The true and basic need is for these 
political parties to spread across the land. No one has the 
right of custodianship on what used to be known as the north of 
the homeland or what used to be known as the south of the 
homeland. 
  God forbid, if we were sucked into the schemes of the 
fabricators of the crisis, who were paid to tear the Yemeni 
unity asunder, and if the Yemeni people fought among themselves 
throughout the land, we would have to come to an understanding 
and sit at the negotiating table to solve this problem as 
happened in 1972 and 1979. In other words, as political groups 
and parties we must sit at the negotiating table and solve our 
problems before any harm is done. I thank all brothers and 
comrades who have played a positive role on the Political Forces 
Dialogue Committee for their efforts. I hope that each of them 
will remain a support for unity instead of secession and that 
they will not take the side of any political groups directly or 
indirectly, neither behind the scenes nor through the telephone, 
to tell this or that party they are in the right. 
  In my name and on behalf of my fellow members on the 
Presidential Council and the executive and legislative branches, 
I ask God's mercy for the soul of Marshal 'Abdallah al-Sallal, 
whose departure was a great loss to the homeland.

  [Text] Cairo, 17 Apr (MENA)--Palestinian and Israeli 
negotiators meeting for talks to eliminate the obstacles 
impeding the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho accord on 
self-rule have wound up their first session, during which they 
continued the discussion of security issues. 
  Khalid al-Qidrah, a member of the Palestinian delegation, 
told MENA that the Security Affairs Committee held a two-hour 
meeting chaired on the Palestinian side by Brigadier General 
'Abd-al-Razzaq al-Yahya and on the Israeli side by Uzi Dayan, 
head of the Israeli Army's Planning Department. He added that 
the purpose of the meeting was to discuss issues concerning 
crossings between Gaza, Jericho, and Israel; joint 
Palestinian-Israeli patrols on parallel roads; the settlements' 
security; and other security topics. He said the Civil Affairs 
Committee, which will basically deal with water and 
communications, and the Legal Affairs Committee will meet later 
today. 
  Al-Qidrah said that during the previous round the Israeli 
side presented a working paper to the Palestinians on the legal 
jurisdiction in Gaza and Jericho. He affirmed that the paper 
has been rejected because it is not in line with the regional 
sovereignty of the self-rule authority. 
  He added that during this round the Palestinian side on the 
Legal Affairs Committee will submit a working paper on the legal 
and judicial jurisdiction and regional sovereignty. He noted 
that the Palestinian side demands full jurisdiction and 
sovereignty over the Palestinian territories. 
  He said: The Israeli paper, which was presented to us at the 
end of the last round, was not discussed. He affirmed that the 
Palestinian side rejected it completely. 
  Al-Qidrah rejected Israel having any legal jurisdiction in 
Gaza and Jericho, even on non-Palestinians as long as they are 
present in the territories under the Palestinian self-rule 
authority, noting that the Israeli proposal is incompatible with 
international law. 
  This round of negotiations, which opened this morning, is 
expected to last until Thursday.

  [Text] Palestinian and Israeli negotiators will today 
continue the talks they began in Cairo yesterday. The talks aim 
to resolve some unsettled issues concerning the implementation 
of the Gaza-Jericho agreement. 
  Nabil Sha'th, head of the Palestinian delegation, said the 
current talks focus on the release of detained Palestinians, 
crossing points between both Gaza and Jericho and Israel, and 
joint Palestinian-Israeli patrols. Sha'th added that any delay 
in the implementation of the Declaration of Principles will 
increase the suffering of the Palestinian people in the occupied 
territories. He expressed hopes of progress in the current 
round of talks, which will last until the end of this week.

  [Text] Cairo, April 18 (AFP)--The return of around 50 
banned or wanted Palestinians to the occupied territories, 
scheduled for Sunday [17 April], has been delayed by 
formalities, the Palestinian chief negotiator Nabil Sha'th said 
late Sunday. 
  The difficulties are being resolved and the exiles could be 
brought together in Egypt or Jordan Monday from where they could 
be transferred to the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, Sha'th told 
reporters here. 
  The delay resulted from the fact that Palestinians who were 
outside Jordan and Egypt needed to gain visas for the two 
countries, said Sha'th, who is leading negotiations with Israel 
on Palestinian self-rule on the Gaza Strip and in the West Bank 
town of Jericho. 
  An official from PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat's Fatah 
organisation said 17 out of the 50 Palestinians would have gone 
to Gaza from Egypt Sunday but for the technical problems. 
  A first group of 50 banned Palestinians returned to the 
occupied territories on April 5.

  [Text] Cairo, April 18 (AFP)--The PLO has rejected an 
Israeli compromise proposal on the scope of Palestinian 
jurisdiction in parts of the occupied territories slated for 
Palestinian self-rule, the chief PLO negotiator said early 
Monday [18 April]. 
  Nabil Sha'th was speaking at the opening session Sunday [as 
received] of the latest round of Israeli-PLO negotiations aimed 
at implementing Palestinian autonomy on the Gaza Strip and in 
the West Bank town of Jericho. 
  He said Israel had proposed that Palestinian jurisdiction 
extend to all foreigners -- non-Israelis and non-Palestinians -- 
in Gaza and Jericho, apart from those who travel there to visit 
Jewish settlements. 
  In another offer, according to Sha'th, Israel suggested that 
a Palestinian charged with a crime against an Israeli be tried 
before a Palestinian court if he is arrested in the autonomous 
areas and before an Israeli court if he escapes and is captured 
in Israel. 
  Israel had initially wanted to maintain jurisdiction over 
all 
foreigners as well as over any Palestinian charged with a crime 
against an Israeli. 
  "They tempered their first proposal, which I have called a 
horror," Sha'th said. "It is now a horror on a minature scale 
but still it is a horror." 
  He charged that Israel's position on jurisdiction was "a 
clear violation of the Declaration of Principles," referring to 
an autonomy agreement signed last September by Israel and the 
Palestine Liberation Organization. 
  "From our point of view, the only (areas) out of our 
jurisdiction are Israelis and settlements." 
  He disclosed that an electronic surveillance system will 
likely be used to resolve the issue of Palestinian movement 
between Gaza and Jericho. 
  The proposed route linking the two sites would extend from 
Eretz, bordering the Gaza Strip, and then pass through Ashqelon 
in southern Israel and Hebron on the West Bank, entering Jericho 
south of Jerusalem. 
  Sha'th also said that Israeli and PLO negotiators had begun 
discussions Sunday on water sharing but declined to release 
details. 
  But he added: "It's not really that much of a problem. It 
can be solved." 
  Sha'th stressed that that PLO was still pressing for a 
general amnesty for all Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, 
estimated to number 10,000. 
  Israel announced last Tuesday that it would agree to free 
5,000 prisoners following the approval of a final autonomy 
accord, excluding Islamic militants in the Hamas movement. 
  Hamas has claimed responsibility for two recent bomb blasts 
that killed 12 Israelis. 
  "What we are discussing is a general amnesty," Sha'th said. 
"We cannot accept that Israelis tell us that people who are 
imprisoned because of their resistance in the past to an illegal 
occupation should remain in jail indefinitely, even after an 
agreement is signed."

  [Text] The Israeli delegation for the multilateral talks 
on water has arrived in Oman. They were greeted by Omani 
Foreign Ministry officials. The talks are due to get under way 
on Sunday [17 April]. The Israeli delegation is headed by Deputy 
Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin, who is expected to meet with 
senior Omani officials during his stay. 
  Beilin said on his arrival that the visit is important 
because it broadens Israel's horizons, enabling the country to 
reach new areas. 
  The Israeli team flew to Muscat on an Egyptian plane from 
Cairo and not on a direct flight from Israel.

<F P=106> [Report by Nadim Ka'wash] </F>
  [Text] Muscat, April 17 (AFP) - Officials from Israel, Arab 
states, and other countries and organisations opened talks on 
water resources here Sunday [17 April] with a call by Oman for 
an agreement to ensure stable supplies. 
  Omani Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Yusuf Ibn-'Alawi 
Bin-'Abdallah said water was one of the most important issues 
being negotiated in the region, as he opened the session at 
Muscat's Intercontinental Hotel. 
  Social and economic development plans required an agreement 
among all the countries of the Middle East to manage water 
resources and develop secure and stable supplies, he told the 
participants. 
  Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin was heading the Israeli 
delegation at the talks, due to last four days. It is the first 
ever visit to a Gulf Arab state by Israeli officials. 
  The water committee is one of five set up within the 
framework of the Middle East peace negotiations. 
  The talks on water resources are the first to take place in 
a 
Gulf country. It is the fifth session since the multilateral 
meetings began, following the 1991 Madrid peace conference. 
  "We had not expected such hospitality and warmth here," said 
a member of the Israeli delegation of more than 15 officials, 
accompanied by 20 journalists. "We are really impressed." 
  Another Israeli delegate said he had "the impression that 
the 
barriers between all the people of the region could come down 
and we can become friends." 
  Beilin met the head of the Omani delegation on Saturday to 
discuss the agenda of the meeting. 
  Conference sources said the Israeli delegation had 
threatened 
to boycott the meeting following a Palestinian delegate's 
statement that the PLO and Israel had agreed to set up a 
National Palestinian Committee to manage Palestinian water 
resources. 
  "The Palestinian delegate later corrected his statement and 
said the committee was part of the autonomy agreement. His 
earlier comments implied a Palestinian state", said an Israeli 
journalist who spoke to Beilin. 
  The Israelis are also due to attend a meeting on arms 
control 
in Qatar early next month, and a tourism conference in Dubai 
this year, officials said. 
  'Alawi said Oman had finalised studies with international 
help to upgrade water desalination facilities. The studies were 
presented to the meeting. 
  "We hope this effort will be a successful beginning for 
serious research to develop water desalination," he said. 
  "Such an achievement will also contribute greatly to 
preventing the danger of potential conflict over water 
resources. There is no doubt such a trend requires joint 
cooperation, especially with industrialised countries which have 
the experience and technology in this field".

  [Text] His Excellency Yusuf Bin-'Alawi Bin-'Abdallah, Omani 
minister of state for foreign affairs, has opened the fifth 
meeting of the water committee within the multilateral talks 
stemming from the Middle East peace conference. The conference, 
which was opened at the Muscat Intercontinental Hotel this 
morning, is attended by 42 states, in addition to the Sultanate 
of Oman, and three international organizations -- the United 
Nations, the European Union, and the World Bank. 
  At the beginning of the four-day meeting, His Excellency 
Yusuf Bin-'Alawi Bin-'Abdallah delivered a speech in which he 
said: As the Sultanate of Oman today hosts the meeting of the 
water resources group within the multilateral talks of the 
Middle East peace conference, it strongly expresses its firm 
conviction of the importance of continuing the march of peace. 
  His excellency added that the sultanate's support for the 
peace process in the Middle East is based on a longstanding 
conviction that resolving the Middle East problem and its crux, 
the Palestinian cause, can only be achieved through direct 
dialogue and serious talks among the involved parties. 
  His excellency stressed that the convening of this meeting 
reflects the concern of the participant states in continuing 
their support and their valuable contribution to support the 
peace process. At the same time, he added, the meeting is an 
opportunity for the delegations to continue their constructive 
discussion, which they began in previous meetings, regarding 
water problems in the Middle East. 
  His excellency the minister of state for foreign affairs 
said: The multilateral track of the peace process concentrates 
on the details. We, in the water group, however, aim at 
preserving the scarce sources of water resources and concentrate 
on the importance of developing and creating new techniques in 
the service of water. We must realize that the work done by the 
water resources group is one of the most important factors of 
cooperation among the Middle East countries for many essential 
reasons, the most important of which is the limited water 
resources in the region. Therefore, the plans for social and 
economic development require that all Middle Eastern countries 
agree on policies to manage water resources and distribution and 
to secure stable water supplies. 
  His excellency said: In light of this, the Sultanate of Oman 
carried out a comprehensive survey to learn about the standards 
reached by water desalination research and technology in the 
world, which it was charged with by the committee during the 
Beijing meeting, to lay down options to reduce the financial 
burdens resulting from water desalination. 
  His excellency said: The document, which will be presented 
to you and which was the production of this survey, represents a 
distinguished technical achievement by a group specialized 
experts and is the result of positive common work thanks to the 
valuable cooperation demonstrated by your countries. 
  He added: On this occasion, we would like to express our 
heartfelt appreciation to those experts and to all those 
countries who contributed to the success of this study, which 
has come up with specific proposals and recommendations which 
will be detailed by the Omani delegation participating in this 
meeting. 
  The minister of state for foreign affairs expressed hope 
that 
this effort will be a successful beginning for serious 
scientific research to develop water desalination technology so 
that it will be used in ways that will have positive effects on 
the economic development in the Middle East. His excellency 
noted that such an achievement will also largely contribute to 
curbing the danger of potential conflict over water resources. 
He added that this trend requires constructive collective 
cooperation, especially with advanced industrialized countries 
that have genuine experience in this regard. 
  His excellency said: We have passed the stage in which we 
considered the mere holding of a meeting between us an 
achievement. We are aware of the fact that these very important 
multilateral meetings should be in harmony with what is achieved 
in the bilateral tracks of the peace talks by laying down sound 
foundations for tangible cooperation over mutual interests and 
common views regarding the issues of the region, which are the 
main topics of the multilateral talks. 
  His Excellency Yusuf Bin-'Alawi Bin-'Abdallah stressed that 
participants from the region know full well that we have made a 
progress in this peace process and reached the threshold of a 
new stage that requires initiatives aimed at building bridges 
and achieving interconnection among the partners of peace. 
Therefore, the multilateral working groups and committees 
should work to reinforce their role and efficiency to support 
the bilateral track of the peace process and to continue to lay 
down practical plans and views that will achieve common benefits 
for all parties in an atmosphere of peace and stability.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi </F>
Beilin, in Oman, by Ya'el Dan in Israel -- live] 
  [Excerpt] [Dan] Where are we catching you? Are you 
finished with the first day of deliberations or are you still in 
the middle of it? 
  [Beilin] The first day of deliberations is actually over. 
  [Dan] How were you impressed by the statements made at the 
opening session, particularly the remarks of the Omani foreign 
minister? Do you think they are important? 
  [Beilin] Yes, definitely. I think the Omani foreign 
minister's remarks reflected how vastly interested the Gulf 
countries are in the water issue. It is not just another topic 
of discussion, but a critical issue to their future. They spend 
a fortune on water, and they definitely want to make every 
possible effort to increase their water resources and lower 
desalination costs. In this respect, the conference here is 
very important. Oman has been subjected to the criticism of 
several Arab countries which were not thrilled about Qatar and 
Oman hosting such conferences. The Omani foreign minister 
defended the hosting of the conference and spoke in very 
positive terms about the political process in the Middle East 
and the wish to put an end to the Israeli-Arab conflict and 
bring about normalization. 
  [Dan] Could you tell us what happened today? How much 
progress did you make? 
  [Beilin] Today we heard statements by individual and blocs 
of countries about specific projects in the region. Although we 
are talking about small-scale projects, I believe these 
deliberations will for the first time culminate in concrete 
agreements about new projects and their financing. Oman 
proposed to concentrate all worldwide information about water 
desalination in Muscat, seeing that it conducted a very secret 
study on the issue. I think this proposal will meet with 
unanimous approval. In any case, we have already expressed our 
consent. 
  The Palestinians raised the question of a water authority in 
the context of the Oslo agreement, and we expressed our consent 
to this matter as well, as long as the authority remains within 
this context and the multilateral forum [sentence as heard]. 
The Europeans and the Americans specifically mentioned several 
projects which could be executed shortly. We proposed to 
discuss projects dealing with water saving and the prevention of 
leaks from water mains. The general atmosphere is very positive 
and everybody has remarked on the positive attitude of the 
participants toward the issues raised so far. At this point, 
there has not been even a trace of confrontation, contrary to 
previous conferences which there fraught with very high tension. 
  [Dan] I would like to confirm that I understood you 
correctly. Did you definitely say that Israel agreed to the 
establishment of an independent Palestinian water authority? To 
the best of our knowledge, Israel has so far opposed such a move. 
  [Beilin] Israel agreed in principle -- and this is also 
stipulated in the Oslo agreement -- to the establishment of 
Palestinian authorities within the framework of the Declaration 
of Principles [DOP] signed on 13 September 1993. In their 
statements this morning, the Palestinians asserted that their 
water authority conforms with the criteria spelled out in the 
DOP. The moment they clarified this, we expressed our consent 
to such an authority. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Aharon Barne'a from Oman] </F>
  [Text] Addressing the multilateral water talks yesterday, 
Omani Foreign Minister Yusuf Bin-'Alawi said that it is time to 
stop emphasizing the very fact that the conference is being held 
and to start acting. Thus, a mere few hours later, the Israeli 
delegation and the Omanis reached an agreement -- the first of 
its kind -- on regional Omani-Israeli cooperation in solar 
energy development. Israeli experts will visit an Omani solar 
energy center in about two weeks, and Omani solar energy experts 
will visit Israel several weeks later to promote the issue. 
Thus, Omani-Israeli cooperation on solar energy is to be 
launched in the coming weeks. 
  So far, all the Israeli proposals at the multilateral talks 
have been submitted through third parties, but today Israel 
itself will submit a proposal on a project for sea water 
desalination for small towns.

  [Text] Cairo, 17 Apr (MENA)--Arab League Secretary General 
Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid met today with a Kuwaiti delegation led 
by Ahmad al-Nassar, a member of the Human Rights Committee in 
the Kuwaiti National Assembly. The delegation includes Qattam 
al-Jumhur, a member of the assembly's Missing Persons Committee 
[Lajnat al-Murtahanin]; Du'ayj al-'Anzi, chairman of the 
National Committee for POW's; and Muhammad al-Haddad, a member 
of the National Committee for POW's. 
  Following the meeting, al-Nassar said he discussed with 
'Abd-al-Majid the latest developments on the POW's in Iraq, 
praising the Arab League stance on this issue. 
  Al-Nassar reacted to Iraqi Information Minister Hamid Yusuf 
Hammadi's announcement in Sanaa yesterday that Iraq has revoked 
its decision to annex Kuwait and make it the 19th governorate. 
The Kuwaiti official affirmed that his country has received no 
official Iraqi offer to revoke the decision on annexing Kuwait 
or to invite a Kuwaiti parliamentary delegation to visit Baghdad 
to discuss the POW problem. 
  He said Kuwait refuses to engage in a "political game" with 
Iraq away from the UN and Arab League resolutions. 
  He added that Kuwait cannot give an opinion about the Iraqi 
initiative until it is authenticated, particularly since Iraq 
has made it a habit of raising "untrue issues," as he put it. 
  Touching on the Kuwaiti POW's in Iraq, al-Nassar said that 
the case is now in the hands of the international community and 
that worldwide efforts are under way to release them. He 
remarked, however, that Iraq is not cooperating. 
  Du'ayj al-'Anzi, for his part, noted that Iraq denied 
holding 
any Iranian prisoners and then released thousands of Iranian 
POW's. He affirmed that Kuwait has presented documents to the 
Arab League, the United Nations, the International Committee of 
the Red Cross, and the Nonaligned Movement confirming that a 
large number of Kuwaiti POW's are being held in Iraq. He hoped 
the League's efforts will succeed in solving this ongoing 
problem.

    [Editorial Report] The following review of the 5 April 
issue of Cairo 'AQIDATI summarizes articles that are Islamic in 
nature. 
<H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>
  1. Awqaf Minister Praised for Confronting Extremism 
  2. Secularists' Criticism of Religious Practices Refuted 
  3. Religious Seminar Stresses Adherence to Religion 
  4. Al-Azhar Mufti Explains Position on Progeny Cloning

<H5>  AWQAF MINISTER PRAISED FOR CONFRONTING EXTREMISM </H5>
  In a 400-word article on page one, Samir Rajab, the 
newspaper's board chairman, praises the religious seminars 
organized by the Awqaf Ministry throughout Egypt to explain true 
Islam and protect the youth from extremist ideas. He says the 
Awqaf minister, through those seminars, took action "when minds 
were ready to receive that bad extremist thought." When the 
minister found that there was no point in dealing with the 
extremists themselves, he instructed that the broad bases in 
schools, universities, and factories be addressed. "The results 
were very promising. Honestly, without that effort many would 
have fallen in the quagmire, far more than those who are 
pointing their guns at the chests of our sons and daughters, 
desecrating our women, and indiscriminately destroying private 
and public property." 
<H5>  SECULARISTS' CRITICISM OF RELIGIOUS PRACTICES REFUTED </H5>
  An approximately 2,000-word article by al-Azhar professor 
Dr. 
'Abd-al-Jawad Sabir Isma'il on page six essentially reacts to an 
article entitled, "Who Is the Apostate?" which Isma'il says he 
read in some newspaper. Isma'il, who does not identify the 
newspaper or the writer, begins by stating that one of the 
"bizarre phenomena" these days is that some writers who know 
nothing about Islam are writing in newspapers about religious 
issues, making mistakes and telling lies, and trying to harm 
Islamic clerics and level false accusations against them. 
  Commenting on a claim in the article that religious sermons 
and preaching recorded by some ulema on audio cassettes contain 
material that is almost destructive to the country, Isma'il 
says: "Those ulema, in fact, were the reason for a religious 
and national awakening that is no secret to anyone. The 
destruction feared by the writer of that article will only be 
the destruction of corruption, treason, agentry, and apostasy." 
Isma'il adds: "Had the writer of that article been fair, he 
would have drawn the reader's attention to another area where 
cassettes are used: to promote vice and eliminate ethics and 
virtue. But this is not in the interest of the secular 
approach, which defends everything Western, even vice." 
  The author also refutes claims that there is an attempt "to 
establish Islamic priesthood" in Egypt. He says this is a big 
lie because Islam eliminated priesthood as it did idols. 
"Muslim ulema receive the credit for their knowledge, and we 
have never known in history, or in this contemporary age, a 
scholar who so sanctified himself or who people held as holy." 
He says this fact was understood by the orientals, who called 
those specializing in religion and its sciences ulema. 
  Isma'il also defends Shaykh al-Ghazali, whom the writer of 
the article allegedly tried to discredit, saying that he rejects 
the implementation of shari'ah. Preparing individuals and 
groups for shari'ah rule, says Isma'il, does not mean rejecting 
the implementation of shari'ah. 
  --A 200-word article by Ibrahim Nasr on page 23 says linking 
Islam and extremism is no longer justified after the confessions 
of repentant terrorist 'Adil 'Abd-al-Baqi on television. The 
writer says: "It is very regrettable that some tendentious 
people who hate Islam are trying to fish in troubled waters and 
use the confessions as a pretext to foolishly confuse right and 
wrong, good and bad, and to harm any religious trend." The 
writer notes that one of the things that made the terrorist 
repent was a book he read for imam al-Ghazali. He says Egypt is 
full of sincere and renowned ulema, but they are all viewed by 
the "tendentious" ones as terrorists. The writer addresses those 
tendentious ones: "Die in your fury, Egypt will remain Islamic. 
Islam is its official religion, Islamic shari'ah is its main 
source of legislation, and holy al-Azhar will continue to stand 
as fast as towering mountains against both the extremists and 
the deviants alike." 

<H5>    RELIGIOUS SEMINAR STRESSES ADHERENCE TO RELIGION </H5>
  An approximately 1,500-word report on page four gives an 
account of a religious seminar organized by the newspaper in a 
Cairo mosque. Men of religion answer questions posed by the 
audience on religious and civil matters, such as marriage, 
mosques, prayers, and family affairs. Speakers reportedly 
stress the role of the mosque in Islamic education and maintain 
that "religion is the spirit of this people, the source of their 
power, and the basis of their unity. Without adhering to our 
religion and acting accordingly, we cannot solve our problems." 
<H5>  AL-AZHAR MUFTI EXPLAINS POSITION ON PROGENY CLONING </H5>
  A 1,500-word report by Amal Hasan on page 14 cites Shaykh 
'Atiyah Saqr, head of al-Azhar's Fatwa [religious ruling] 
Committee, as saying that Islam is a religion of science. He 
encourages scientific research as long as it observes three 
conditions: legitimate purpose, legitimate means, and belief 
that things can only happen under God's order and will. He 
tells a medical seminar that "cloning, if meant to improve the 
selection of the species and treat some kinds of infertility, 
and the use of genetic engineering to treat cancer and some 
hereditary diseases, are no problem." He adds: "If cloning is 
aimed at producing males instead of females, or females instead 
of males, or at forming human progenies as needed, then it is a 
major mistake." 
<H5>  TURKISH ISLAMIC PARTY'S STRONG SHOWING IN ELECTION VIEWED </H5>
  Page 21 contains an 800-word comment by Ashraf Abu-al-Hawl 
on 
the results of the Turkish municipal election in which the 
Islamic Welfare Party made a strong showing. The writer notes 
Western anxiety over the results of the election. Although the 
Welfare Party is not a fundamentalist Islamic party in the sense 
we know it in Egypt, he writes, "The enemies of Islam, both in 
Turkey and abroad, rushed to attack it fiercely and to belittle 
its achievement. Indeed, they implicitly called for outlawing 
the party under the pretext of fear for freedoms and the 
democratic achievements of the secular state." The writer 
maintains that Turks "began to feel that the current Turkish 
crisis is caused by the enemies of Islam, who divided the Turks 
on nationalist grounds, tried to isolate Turkey from its 
historical Islamic roots, and promoted the idea of European 
Turkey."

<H5>  JOURNALIST 'ABD-AL-SATTAR ABU-HUSAYN HELD IN MILITARY PRISON </H5>
  An 800-word report by Mahmud Bakri on page 1 says "the 
campaign against the newspaper AL-SHA'B has reached its peak in 
the past few days." Journalist 'Abd-al-Sattar Abu-Husayn was 
arrested at his home at 2300 on 4 April and was then subjected 
to extensive interrogation at the office of the military public 
prosecutor. The report goes on to say that "in an unprecedented 
move in the history of military justice," he was brought before 
a military crime court in al-'Abbasiyah less than 24 hours after 
his arrest. Without mentioning the charges brought against him, 
the report says the concerned authorities prevented defense 
lawyers from attending his interrogation, which was held in 
"complete secrecy." The authorities also prevented his 
relatives and journalists from AL-SHA'B and other newspapers 
from visiting him in the military prison. The report adds that 
several journalists staged a sit-in at the Press Association on 
6 and 7 April to protest his arrest. The journalists issued a 
statement denouncing the "ferocious onslaught" on the newspaper 
AL-SHA'B. Furthermore, the report says police forces arrived 
twice on 6 April at the newspaper's premises on the pretext that 
there were "scuffles and sit-ins" within the premises. The 
report adds that the police force continues to have an 
"intensive security presence" around the premises. 
<H5>  JOURNALIST'S DETENTION LINKED TO REPORT ON BRIGHT STAR </H5>
EXERCISES 
  An 800-word editorial entitled "Abduction" by Chief Editor 
Majdi Ahmad Husayn sheds light on the reasons for the arrest of 
AL-SHA'B journalist 'Abd-al-Sattar Abu-Husayn. The chief editor 
says at first it was feared that the journalist was kidnapped by 
arms merchants because he wrote an investigative report 
[AL-SHA'B issue of 22 March] that he had honestly copied from 
U.S. newspapers on investigations being held by the U.S. 
Congress and the U.S. Justice Department on commissions paid on 
U.S. arms deals with Egypt. However, by 6 April it became clear 
that he was being held by the military authorities because he 
wrote a report in AL-SHA'B on 1 April on the presence of U.S. 
and European military officials in Cairo to arrange for the 
Bright Star Exercises. The chief editor says he received an 
order from the information minister's office on 6 April banning 
the newspaper from publishing further reports on this subject. 
<H5>  HAMAS CLAIMS RESPONSIBILITY FOR 'AFULA OPERATION </H5>
  The newspaper publishes a 500-word report by Muna Yasin on 
page 1 entitled "Palestinian Mujahidin Avenge the al-Haram 
al-Ibrahimi Massacre." The mostly factual report says Hamas has 
claimed responsibility for the car bombing of a bus in 'Afula in 
northern Israel in which eight Jews were killed and 52 others 
were wounded, saying it was in retaliation for the Hebron 
massacre. The report then cites a Hamas statement that was 
broadcast on Radio Monte Carlo on 7 April. In the statement 
"Hamas asks the inhabitants of the occupied territories to stock 
up on foodstuffs in preparation for a stage during which the 
country will face an all-out war in a very short time." In the 
statement, Hamas also "appeals to 'Arafat to postpone the talks 
with Israel for one year with the promise that it will force the 
occupation troops to withdraw without conditions from the West 
Bank and Gaza Strip within this period." 
<H5>  ARTICLE ATTACKS COMMUNIST, SECULAR WRITERS </H5>
  A 900-word article by Dr. Mahmud Himayah, director of the 
Preaching Department of the School of Religion in Asyut, 
comments on the government decision to ban Shaykh 'Umar 
'Abd-al-Kafi from delivering Friday sermons. He says, "the 
remnants of communists and secular people" are behind the 
campaign against men of religion in Egypt. They control the 
media and have close ties with high-ranking government 
officials. They attack such prominent preachers as Shaykh 
al-Ghazali, Shaykh al-Sha'rawi, and Shaykh 'Abd-al-Kafi. Even 
the grand iman of al-Azhar has not escaped their insults. They 
do this in the name of "fighting extremism" and safeguarding 
"national unity." Dr. Himayah says the "great calamity" is that 
these secular writers have become so influential with the 
government that one or two articles by them against a certain 
preacher will ensure that this preacher is expelled from his 
mosque or post. Himayah asks what crime Dr. 'Abd-al-Kafi has 
committed. He says Dr. 'Abd-al-Kafi is persuasive and 
reasonable. Thousands of youths attend his sermons. He deduces 
that "success in this bad time has become a crime for which the 
preachers must be called to account." Himayah asks what is wrong 
with Dr. 'Abd-al-Kafi's call on actresses and female singers to 
repent and wear the veil. He asks, "Is this another crime for 
which he must punished?" Himayah says in this age "virtue has 
become vice and vice has become virtue." 

<H5>    ARTICLE BY 'ADIL HUSAYN </H5>
  A 4,000-word article by Labor Party Secretary General 'Adil 
Husayn on pages 5 and 7 deals with several topics, including the 
television interview with former al-Shawqiyun terrorist 'Adil 
'Abd-al-Baqi and the film "The Terrorist." Regarding the 
television interview with 'Abd-al-Naqi, which was screened 
several times, including one time with subtitles in English, 
Husayn casts doubt on 'Abd-al-Baqi's character and maintains 
that he has ties with the General Intelligence Department and 
the Interior Ministry. To substantiate this view, the newspaper 
publishes a picture that was printed in the newspaper AKHBAR 
AL-HAWADITH on 27 January showing 'Abd-al-Baqi receiving an 
award from the Interior Minister. Husayn then asks what the 
"repentant youth" said to deserve all this attention. He says 
'Abd-al-Baqi denied that foreign governments had provided the 
terrorists with money and weapons. 'Abd-al-Baqi says the 
terrorists obtained money through theft, trade, and collection 
of donations. Husayn says the al-Shawqiyun are a "marginal" 
group that is not a serious threat to public security and is not 
responsible for the escalation of political violence. 
  Regarding the film "The Terrorist," Husayn said he saw the 
film and did not find it to be high quality. He asks why the 
film is surrounded by so much fanfare. He says the film wants 
to say that: "We are before a vicious, wicked, and murderous 
Islamic religion. In contrast, we are before a good and 
beautiful Christian religion. The rest of the Muslims have 
nothing to do with Islam. Good Muslims are not religious. Any 
Muslim who becomes religious necessarily becomes a terrorist." 
  Husayn maintains that "never in its history has Egypt 
witnessed this level of torture and indiscriminate killing." 
He claims that there are now 60,000 repeat 60,000 detainees in 
Egypt, compared to 7,000 detainees during the last days of 
President al-Sadat. 
  Husayn says matters have not stopped at fighting extremists 
and terrorists but have included attacks on al-Azhar and its 
scholars. He says Al-Azhar, due to several considerations, 
usually does not intervene in controversial issues unless they 
threaten the tenets of the religion. Nevertheless, we see that 
its limited role is not accepted. Husayn says the attacks on 
Shaykh al-Sha'rawi, the ban on Shaykh al-Ghazali and prominent 
Islamic thinker Dr. Muhammad 'Amarah from appearing on 
television, and the expulsion of Dr. 'Abd-al-Kafi from his 
mosque cannot be within the framework of fighting extremists but 
is an "all-out war" against righteous religious figures. 
  Husayn says he has heard about six new prisons being built 
secretly in the Egyptian desert. He asks for whom these new 
prisons with high walls and modern equipment are being prepared. 
<H5>  CALL FOR TRIAL OF DR. BUTRUS-GHALI </H5>
  On page 7 the newspaper carries a 150-word report that says, 
"the Egyptian Committee in Support of the People of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina continues to prepare for the popular trial 
that will be held for the United Nations and its secretary 
general, Dr. Butrus Butrus-Ghali, on charges of negligence in 
the massacres to which the Bosnian Muslims are being subjected." 
A preparatory committee headed by Yahya al-Rifa'i and including 
Mahfuz 'Azzam and Hasan Duh as members will collect all papers 
and documents incriminating the UN secretary general. Dr. 
'Izz-al-Din Fudah will act as a prosecutor in the case. 
<H5>  EGYPTIAN HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZATION </H5>
  On page 7, the newspaper publishes a 250-word statement by 
the Egyptian Human Rights Organization asking President Mubarak 
to intervene to stop the systematic human rights violations 
inside Egyptian prisons. The statement calls for the formation 
of an independent committee to hold a comprehensive and neutral 
investigation on prison conditions. It also calls for the 
abolition of the Interior Ministry's supervision of the prisons 
and for their transfer to the supervision of the Ministry of 
Justice. 
<H5>  U.S. WAR ON EGYPTIAN EXPORTS </H5>
  On page 7, the newspaper publishes a 250-word report that 
says the "U.S. Administration has stepped up its war against 
Egyptian exports, especially textiles." The report adds that 
the main reasons for this "war on Egyptian exports" are: 1) 
Egypt has not undertaken a real and tangible effort to include 
Israel in the Middle East market for cooperation between Israel 
and the Arab states. 2) The Egyptian Government has rejected 
several Israeli projects for strengthening cooperation between 
the two countries. The report says the United States insists on 
the need for strengthening Egyptian-Israeli economic relations. 
"These U.S. demands are considered a repetition of the demands 
of the U.S. trade secretary, who visited Cairo recently and 
asked Egypt to exert greater efforts to persuade the Arab 
countries to end their boycott of Israel." 
<H5>  ISLAMISTS WIN AL-MANSURAH UNIVERSITY ELECTIONS </H5>
  On page 7, the newspaper carries a 200-word report that says 
the Islamists have won all seats in the elections for the 
al-Mansurah University Teaching Club. The elected members are 
Dr. Hasan Mushrif for the College of Agriculture, Dr. Ahmad 
al-Wasif and Dr. Ahmad Sami for the College of Engineering, Dr. 
Muhammad al-Dusuqi and Dr. Tahir Hamzah for the College of 
Sciences, and Dr. Mamduh Mansur for the College of Pharmacology.

    [Editorial Report] Cairo ROSE AL-YUSUF in Arabic on 11 
April carries several articles attacking the Labor Party's 
newspaper AL-SHA'B, "extremist books," and a well-known Islamic 
writer. It presents portraits of two Islamic figures and 
praises scriptwriters and actors for espousing the battle 
against terror. Each of the five subjects covered in this 
editorial report is dealt with under its own heading as follows: 
<H5>  AL-SHA'B CRITICIZED </H5>
  A 2,000-word article on pages 58-59 by Wahid Hamid attacks 
the Socialist Labor Party's [SLP] biweekly mouthpiece AL-SHA'B 
[The People]. In the article, headlined "A Newspaper Against 
the People," the writer contends that both the paper and the SLP 
are a single-family enterprise, bringing together a group of 
relatives and in-laws who share "a hereditary dream of 
leadership, pursued even if it is a leadership of a ruined 
homeland." 
  Hamid claims the paper has no allegiance to the country but 
instead, "with great ignorance," advocates "the abolition of the 
Egyptian character" under the claim of establishing an Islamic 
character. He says the paper, rather than defending the 
homeland's causes in a sober way, uses exaggeration, invective, 
sensationalism, and incitement, which does a disservice to any 
cause it defends. He says the government pays no heed to this 
publication and might even benefit from it as providing an 
example of democratic free speech. 
  The writer accuses AL-SHA'B of belittling the Egyptian 
Government and people but admiring the systems of government in 
Sudan and Iraq. Stating that the Iraqi regime would never permit 
an Islamic government in the country, he says AL-SHA'B's support 
for this regime must spring from its "automatic sympathy with 
fascism everywhere, in addition to the usual personal interests 
well understood by politicians and media people." 
  Commenting on a recent article by SLP Secretary General 
'Adil 
Husayn in which he calls on the people to support his party's 
jihad until victory is achieved, the writer asks if the Islamic 
state that AL-SHA'B and the SLP advocate will be any different 
from the so-called Islamic governments in Afghanistan and Iran. 
He remarks that even the Saudi Government is a civilian 
government that merely permits the Wahhabists [puritanical 
Muslim sect] to monitor Islamic observances. 
  The writer concludes by saying: "A religious state is a mere 
fantasy that is not in harmony with the spirit of Islam, a 
religion that has preserved people's rights and left them their 
free will and liberty. We are on the side of Islam. We seek to 
make it prosper and fight its opponents but without having to 
live under a failed dictatorship that professes to be Muslim." 
<H5>  EXTREMIST BOOKS </H5>
  On pages 60-61, 'Abd-al-Sattar al-Tawilah takes issue with 
"extremist books." In an article entitled "A Document of Shame 
Against Islam and Muslims," he disputes the arguments set forth 
in the book "Putting the Apostates on Trial" by Ahmad al-Suyufi 
and says it approves of the assassination of secular writer 
Faraj Fudah and others accused of apostasy. He says that 
al-Suyufi expresses views similar to those of Shaykh Muhammad 
al-Ghazali, Shaykh Mahmud Mazru'ah, and Shaykh Qardawi. He 
objects to the book's premise that a person changing his 
religion is comparable with national treason and says that even 
fascist constitutions guarantee freedom of belief. 
  Al-Tawilah faults the argument that excuses assassinations 
on 
the grounds that the government does not permit the religious 
stream to form a political party or tortures prisoners in jail. 
He remarks: "Numerous political forces are not permitted to 
form political parties. Does this mean they have the right to 
resort to murder and sabotage?" 
<H5>  HUWAYDI VIEWED </H5>
  An article by Ibrahim 'Isa on pages 61-63 entitled "Fahmi 
Huwaydi's Pistol Has a Silencer" comments on the writings of the 
well-known Islamic writer, Huwaydi. He faults him for quoting 
other Islamic and secular writers out of context to level 
accusations at them, generally in an indirect manner, without 
"declaring anything but leaving things to simmer at a suitable 
temperature so that the bacteria of accusations will survive 
without being proclaimed but also without dying." He says he 
believes "Fahmi Huwaydi possesses an exceptional ability and an 
astonishing, talented, and admirable know-how in clothing truth 
with falsehood" to arouse the anger of any "fanatic" or any 
other reader against writers holding views different from his 
own to the point of making his readers want to "throttle" those 
writers. 
  He disputes Huwaydi's description as a "moderate" and says: 
"The man, talented in several ways, can present himself, and is 
represented by others, as a moderate. Behind this screen, 
manipulation occurs. I do not know from where his description 
as a moderate comes. Is it the calm tone of lamentation in his 
lines or is it the silencer he uses when he accuses others of 
disbelief?" 
  While acknowledging Huwaydi's former "important and great" 
literary contributions, he accuses him of abandoning his past 
intellectual achievements by not coming out strongly against the 
call to kill apostates and for his call to hold a dialogue 
between the government and the extremists. 

<H5>    ISLAMIC FIGURES HIGHLIGHTED </H5>
  A 1,800-word report by Usamah Salamah on pages 30-31 
discusses the case of a lawyer, Mukhtar Nuh, a formerly obscure 
but ambitious figure who has been an active member of the 
Egyptian Lawyers Association as a Muslim Brotherhood 
representative since 1985. The report discusses his early life 
since his enrollment as a law student in 1971 and notes that 
this "skillful guitar player" and member of the drama group at 
Cairo University's School of Law turned to religion after 
graduation and was detained by the authorities for 10 months in 
1981 in connection with the "religious streams." His first 
public connection with the Muslim Brotherhood is said to date 
back to 1985 when he raised the slogan: "Yes, we want it to be 
Islamic" during the Egyptian Lawyers Association elections. 
'Umar al-Talmasani, the late general guide of the Muslim 
Brotherhood, is reported to have told a group of lawyers at that 
time: "Mukhtar Nuh will become president of the Lawyers 
Association in 10 years but will become Muslim Brotherhood 
general guide in just five years." 
  The report notes that Nuh currently enjoys the backing of 
Muslim Brotherhood Spokesman Ma'mun al-Hudaybi, who helped 
nominate him for a seat in the People's Assembly 1987 general 
election. Nuh is no longer a People's Assembly member but 
remains active in the Lawyers Association. 
  A 2,000-word report by 'Abdallah Kamal on pages 32-33 speaks 
of the experiences of 'Abdallah al-Samawi, occasionally referred 
to by the writer as Taha al-Samawi, an Islamist jailed several 
times and who espouses the concept of repudiating society for 
its disbelief. Al-Samawi describes himself as "only a preacher" 
but the writer says he is behind the rulings to set video rental 
shops on fire and links him with the "Repudiation and 
Renunciation" group. 
<H5>  ARTISTS PRAISED </H5>
  In a 700-word article on page 34, Ahmad Hamrush expresses 
dismay at the continuing "terrorist acts by some extremist 
groups wearing the guise of Islam." He regrets the failure of 
the political establishment, which he says is plagued by 
corruption, to do anything about this phenomenon, and praises 
writers and moviemakers for endeavoring to resist extremism. He 
notes that Egyptian television has stopped broadcasting some 
programs and interviewing some personalities that did not 
properly interpret religion. Instead it is now showing artistic 
works mentioned elsewhere.

<F P=106> [Article by Fahmi Huwaydi: "Review of the Season's </F>
Testimony"] 
  [Text] I do not know when we will stop being frivolous in 
handling an issue as serious and dangerous as terrorism. I 
maintain, however, that the interview with a repentant extremist 
which Egyptian television broadcast three times last week raises 
several serious issues for discussion. 
  By frivolity I mean the attitude of treating the issue 
superficially, focussing on some outward features, and 
summarizing the entire affair with a collection of anecdotes and 
sensational headlines harping on the same old story--primarily 
that those groups contain only young guys with sexual and 
emotional hangups who receive orders and financing from abroad. 
The media has persistently driven this image home by various 
means, most recently via television soap operas and motion 
pictures. 
  This method is especially bad because it caters to our 
spontaneous and emotional responses and fosters in us an 
attitude of disgust. It bypasses our minds and does not require 
us to think. It makes people angry without understanding why 
they are angry and therefore convinces them that the individuals 
concerned are evil, deviant, criminal. People do not understand 
why those individuals are like that. Were they born that way or 
were they originally good and later became perverted? The root 
cause of the problem is ignored and the essential question "why" 
is not asked, so it follows that no one asks: "What should be 
done?" 
  To be precise, in this way of addressing the issue we are 
preoccupied with the sick person while ignoring the sickness. 
It is a method of caricaturing terrorists and terrorist 
behavior. The terrorist dossier itself, however, is left 
unopened. 
  The testimony of the repentant leading member -- 'Adil 
'Abd-al-Baqi -- is important because it was a direct testimony 
illustrating the views and experiences of some existing groups. 
Regardless of possible guidance and the revision of his 
testimony and no matter the degree of accuracy of his 
information, we believe that it revealed, in a general way, some 
important aspects of this disease. It shed some light that 
deserves to be followed up in order to answer the big question 
that still needs to be discussed seriously and courageously, 
namely: Why does such deviant behavior occur? Where does it 
come from? 
  Before we attempt to interpret the testimony from this 
angle, 
we must pause a moment and examine who the witness and his group 
are, in order to identify the case study we are addressing. We 
shall use the man's own statements as evidence. 
  He was born in 1961, did not complete his secondary 
education, and joined these groups in 1977 at the age of 16. It 
was at this point that he was taught to say that this is an 
infidel society. He was arrested after President al-Sadat's 
assassination in 1981; and while in jail he became a member of 
the group known as "al-Shawqiyun," named after "Shawqi 
al-Shaykh," a dissident belonging to Dr. 'Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman's 
"Islamic" group. Apparently, however, he quarreled with the 
al-Shawqiyun and joined another group known as "Hesitation and 
Confirmation." Throughout his life he has relied on his 
personal reading to acquire religious knowledge; and at the age 
of 22 he was regarded as a theoretician, issuing rulings about 
what is permitted behavior and what is taboo, and leveling 
accusations of disbelief and apostasy. By chance he came across 
Shaykh Muhammad al-Ghazali's book "Jurisprudence in the Life of 
the Prophet," in which the writer discusses some aspects of the 
conduct of the Prophet, may God's prayers and peace be with him. 
He realized then that he and his group were seizing other 
people's money wrongfully. This was the first spark in his 
gradual enlightenment as to the errors in the various groups' 
views and behavior. Other events prompted him to reconsider the 
whole issue and eventually led him to testify on television, 
where he renounced the ideology he had embraced for 17 years. 
  The "Hesitation and Confirmation" group to which he was said 
to belong is a link in the chain of groups that are covered by 
the blanket of the heretic ideology which brands [yadmagh] 
individuals, society, and the authorities as unbelievers. These 
groups went under various names, notably the "Repudiation and 
Renunciation," "al-Shawqiyun," "Those Delivered from the Fire," 
and the "Hesitation and Confirmation" groups. These four groups 
are the most prominent manifestations of intellectual deviation 
on the Egyptian Islamic scene. They are small groups of limited 
influence, drawing their grassroots membership from among 
simple, unsophisticated people to whom a person like 'Adil 
'Abd-al-Baqi can act as an "authority" able to lead them 
intellectually and organizationally. The heretic ideology is 
limited to these small groups. An essential difference between 
them and the larger well-known groups, that is the Muslim 
Brotherhood, the Islamic Group, and the Salafis [revanchists] is 
that the latter, despite having diverse programs, methods, and 
goals, do not call anyone an unbeliever. This repentant leader 
took care to explain this difference. His explanation corrected 
the widespread misconception that branding others as unbelievers 
is the foundation of Islamic action, a misconception created by 
frivolous media treatment of the issue. Actually, the heretic 
ideology is a deviant concept and an exception to the general 
rule. 
  If we go back to our subject and examine his remarks 
carefully, we will find in them important hints concerning the 
points of weakness and disorder through which this intellectual 
deviation infiltrates, paving the way for events culminating in 
terrorism. Here are examples of such factors: 
  First, he did not find in school anything to satisfy his 
desire for religious knowledge and thus he left school to seek 
that knowledge elsewhere. He was asked: Are the school 
curricula designed to help every person learn true religion? He 
replied: I felt that the religion of the mosques and what we 
learn in school did not satisfy my religious needs as a young 
man. 
  Both the question and the answer raise an issue which I 
believe is crucial in tracing the roots of intellectual 
deviation. This is that our youths emerge from school with a 
very shallow religious background that fails to give them a 
minimum of protection for keeping their balance and straight 
thinking. As a result, young men become soft and pliable putty 
for anyone to shape. 
  Regrettably, some of those annoyed by the deviations now 
apparent in the Islamic stream are calling for countering them 
by reducing the religious content of the academic curricula on 
the hypothesis that extremism grows in religious soil so by 
eliminating that soil we can slow the spread of deviations. 
These people have used and are still using the slogan "Dry Up 
the Springs." I remember I criticized this stand in previous 
articles and said we need to adopt a purposeful policy on 
religion, not dry up its springs. I warned that the advocates 
of drying up the springs drive students to various types of 
extremism and deviation so that they thereby do not fight 
extremism but encourage and spread it through their poor 
judgment and shortsightedness. 
  The example of 'Adil 'Abd-al-Baqi confirms this. The young 
man did not find what he was looking for at school, so he went 
looking for it outside school, became involved in illegal acts, 
and dragged many others with him. I have no doubt that entire 
generations are suffering from what this person suffered from, 
and there is no way to save them except by reconsidering the 
education policy and curricula in a manner that will restore 
prestige to religious culture and immunize our youths to 
deviation. 
  I mentioned before that the years of nationalistic fervor 
dictated these "nationalistic subjects" at the various education 
levels right up to university. It was an understandable 
approach during that stage. In the period of religious 
resurgence we are now experiencing, we ought to give our youths 
the healthy food they need at school before they swallow 
adulterated and poisoned food from street vendors. 
  Second, when he joined the groups, one of the leading 
advocates of the proposition that society is heretical convinced 
him about "legalization" -- that is to say that stealing money 
from others, from "the infidels," and using this money for one's 
duty is permissible. He was convinced of this and advocated it. 
He added: "We used to read things, but found no one to advise 
us on correct concepts. At the same time we shut ourselves in, 
regarded all preachers as part of the "infidel" regime, and 
turned our backs on them." At another point he said: "I could 
not find a clergyman who would tell me if what I read was right 
or wrong." 
  This is the first time I have heard the term "legalization." 
I know that some kind of a shari'ah loophole justifies seizing 
other people's money on the pretext that they are "infidels." 
This opens our eyes to the fact that there is an unknown world 
out there in the dark in which the weirdest ideas are spreading 
with no one to stem or rectify them. 
  This draws our attention to more than one crisis: 
  --the crisis of darkness, in which such groups move; 
  --the crisis due to preachers who have lost the youths' 
confidence and forced them to be satisfied with their underworld; 
  --the crisis of indignation against a society that fostered 
the mind set among young men that accepts the idea that the 
society is heretical and that it is permissible to seize 
people's money and property; and 
  --the crisis of the higher religious authority, which should 
be making sure of the correctness of the ideas these youths 
absorb and taking the lead in seeking a prudent and moderate way. 
  Suppose this young man, and hundreds or thousands like him, 
had found a public, legitimate agency to nurture them and 
satisfy their desire for piety and public service; would the 
concept of the repudiation of society have spread so easily 
then? Can anyone imagine that the term "legalization" would 
have appeared then? 
  Such questions lead to the discussion of an issue totally 
ignored amid the preoccupation with extremism and terrorism. It 
is the need to provide avenues of moderation for these young men 
before they find themselves compelled to join illegal groups 
that will indoctrinate them with whatever ideas those groups 
want, without supervision or accountability. 
  Another question arises: Why did those young men not find 
reliable, authoritative ulema to correct the ideas that had 
taken hold of their minds? The young men regarded preachers as 
part of the government, a form of authority, and establishment 
mouthpieces and so they lost faith in them and did not listen to 
them. 
  Preacher convoys have toured the country. Reports and 
photographs of them holding seminars and conferences to fight 
deviant ideologies fill the newspapers, but when young men were 
asked about them, they replied: Those preachers did not discuss 
any issues with us. They came to the villages to dictate things 
to us. 
  There is no doubt that those preacher convoys were a 
bureaucratic solution adopted merely as a stopgap measure and to 
show that the authorities were doing something. Perhaps we did 
not need this repentant's testimony to reach the conclusion we 
are now reaching. 
  What is the solution? It is necessary to make do better in 
training and upgrading preachers. Al-Azhar must play its role 
and do its duty as a beacon of sober thought and an independent 
institution responsible for the defense of Islam in Egypt and 
all over the Islamic world. Those who seek to undermine and 
slander al-Azhar and those who seek to subjugate it and make it 
part of the political establishment are derogating it and 
reducing its credibility. Every reduction of its credibility 
gives free help to deviancy and terrorism. Efforts to undermine 
or control al-Azhar serve the same ends as extremism. 
  Commenting on the membership of the deviant groups, the 
repentant leading member said that most of those who have joined 
since 1985 were unemployed who "came to us and we provided them 
with employment in the form of robbery within the context of 
legalization." He explained that "they wanted to marry and we 
provided them with the money for that. Within four months such 
a member would feel he had become somebody, with a job, a home, 
and a wife." 
  This description places the socioeconomic factor squarely 
before our eyes. Unemployed persons find self-fulfillment in 
the embrace of those groups that provide them with the things 
society has been unable to give them. If we remember that there 
are 3 million unemployed people in Egypt, we will immediately 
realize that those groups have a huge potential army. 
Unemployment is an important source of members, of those who 
are looking for a job and self- fulfillment. The issue goes 
beyond this, for once they are persuaded that their society is 
heretical and that their mission is to change that society from 
a swamp of unbelief into an oasis of faith, those young men will 
find a cause to defend and for which to make sacrifices. 
  Does not this situation demand some very deep thinking about 
the younger generation crushed by the ordeals of unemployment, a 
search for self-fulfillment, and the quest for a dream and a 
cause? 
  Should not this situation make us think again of what we are 
doing for our young people, who actually live on the margins of 
society where no one cares about them even though one day they 
will have to lead the country? 
  Our friend said that his mother gave him 4,000 pounds to 
start a project and earn a living. She did this after she 
realized that he had definitely abandoned his studies. He spent 
the money on forming his "Hesitation and Confirmation" group. 
He rented a house in which he lived with 25 companions. When 
the money ran out two months later, the solution was the 
legalization fatwa. They started stealing bicycles and selling 
them. When this became insufficient they stole motorcycles, and 
so on. "The greater the need for money, the more legalization 
was granted." 
  This discussion raises the issue of who finances them. Many 
people find it easy to link financing to foreign sources. Much 
published comment and various recent movies give the same 
message. According to this repentant man, generalized statements 
about links to foreign parties are at the very least not very 
accurate. He personally spent every penny his mother gave him 
on a cause he judged to be worth while. Later on, the 
legalization of theft was the solution to getting the funds 
necessary for continuing the "mission." What I mean is that 
this entire scene we are examining was homegrown, including the 
ideas, the people, and the money. It means that foreign parties 
were not part of the picture in the beginning. At worst, the 
role of foreign parties--if such a thing is proved--came later 
and was incidental. 
  We are not concerned with exonerating the foreign parties. 
Our chief concern at this time is to focus attention on the 
domestic factors in order to give them priority in our effort to 
eradicate this phenomenon. In other words, repeatedly hammering 
away about foreign parties does more harm than good because it 
diverts attention from the original and real domestic causes. 
These causes lie at our feet and are in our hands but we insist 
on looking beyond our borders, searching for an unknown foreign 
party that we cannot see. 
  What applies to money also applies to weapons. When the man 
was asked where he had obtained weapons, his simple answer was 
that weapons are found in every house in Upper Egypt. This 
means that the weapons have been found inside the country since 
the beginning. The means of violence were available from the 
start. What happened afterwards was a development and an 
exploitation of those means. 
  In conclusion, one cannot but notice in the statement of the 
repentant leading member that he wasted 17 years of his life on 
his miserable adventures and refused to meet his mother when she 
came to visit him in jail. We cannot fail to notice his 
references to those who abandoned their families and devoted 
their lives to a cause they considered righteous. He spoke of 
the science student who left his studies to peddle socks in the 
streets and the specialist surgeon who abandoned his profession 
to sell watches. When one examines these images, one realizes 
that this army of young men are victims of a corrupt cause and a 
fallacious dream. This raises the puzzling question: Who is 
responsible for this waste? Is it merely the responsibility of 
those who have misled the young men and tempted them with 
corrupt ideologies about repudiating society and considering the 
theft of its wealth as legitimate? Or is it also the 
responsibility of a society that has failed to rally them around 
an honorable cause and did not fire their imagination with a 
great dream? 
  'Adil 'Abd-al-Baqi said that he used to act on the 
understanding that he had a cause that filled his thoughts and 
took hold of his feelings and that, in those days, if he had 
been given 50 death sentences he would not have regretted his 
acts. That is because he believed he was right and would die a 
martyr. He is not alone in this; there are many like him. They 
think they are right and express a willingness to die in defense 
of their convictions. These are urgent questions: Is there a 
way to channel these feelings in the right direction, one that 
can serve the homeland's and the nation's noble objectives? Is 
there a means to channel this energetic faith, so full of 
resentment against society, in a way that will help society to 
progress and realize some of its legitimate dreams? 
  In the midst of our media's renowned buffoonery, 
sensationalism, and confusing tactics, it is difficult to answer 
these questions. Regrettably, sensationalism has governed even 
the way we read the testimony mentioned here. Many people have 
focused on the accusations, scandals, and other sensational 
material that emerged from the testimony. Only a few noticed 
the moral behind it. Hence, instead of organizing a roundtable 
to discuss the various aspects of the issue and the 
responsibility of all parties, we were astounded to see a great 
pavilion being set up full of shouting, clowning people. They 
gave us a headache with their loud but empty talk. Those who 
tried to say something serious could not be heard above the din. 
This means that the frivolous method of addressing the issue 
still has the upper hand and that the time for seriousness has 
not yet come!

  [Text] Gaza/London--Quds Press and news agencies--The 
Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, has lauded the 
Jordanian-Palestinian cohesion, and stressed that it will 
maintain this genuine historic cohesion. 
  In a statement issued by its military wing, known as 
'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam Battalions, and distributed in Gaza City 
yesterday, Hamas warned the Israeli Government against expanding 
the Palestinian-Israeli conflict following its claims against 
the Jordanian position. 
  In an amazing step, Hamas said that it is ready to reexamine 
its policy of attacking Israeli military and civilian targets, 
on the condition that the Israeli prime minister, his army, and 
government completely stop killing unarmed Palestinians. It 
pointed out that the objective of the recent 'Afula and Hadera 
operations, which targeted a group of soldiers and settlers, and 
in which some civilians were injured, was to deter the Zionist 
aggression against our people, and legitimate revenge for the 
martyrs of the abhorrent Hebron massacre. However, in a 
statement issued by its political bureau yesterday, of which 
Quds Press received a copy, it said that this is not a constant 
policy by the 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam Battalions, but an 
extraordinary policy imposed by the Israeli enemy government. 
  The statement added: We, in Hamas, as we have always said, 
we are not against the principle of peace, but the peace 
proposed by the enemy government is not peace, but an 
entrenchment of occupation. 
  In a clear response to the Israeli criticism of Jordan, it 
said that the Movement reiterates its concern for the security 
and stability of all states where the movement's political and 
economic representatives reside, who operate in accordance with 
the recognized laws in these states. The movement is also 
concerned not to give the enemy any justification to exert 
pressure on any of these states. 
  The statement said that any peace in the region must be 
based 
on Israel's withdrawal from the occupied territories, the 
removal of settlements, and the holding of free elections in the 
West Bank and Gaza Strip to elect our people's representatives 
and leadership. It added that the elected leadership is the one 
that will decide all the consequent steps and future of the 
cause. 
  In a statement distributed in Gaza, Hamas stressed that its 
units "had abided by carrying out its operations within the 
known borders of Palestine. Our leadership was committed to 
planning and carrying out its operations only inside the 
occupied Palestinian territories." 
  The statement added: "If the Israeli Government seeks to 
expand the arena of the conflict and decides to move against the 
Hamas Movement's officials or offices abroad, then it will 
consider this as the beginning of a war in which Israeli blood, 
interests, and gatherings of Jewish communities all over the 
globe will be legitimate [targets], and we will reply more 
harshly to any act of aggression." 
  The statement emphasized: The "Israeli Government knows 
better than anyone that the Islamic Resistance Movement has long 
and strong arms in all the world states. We have thus far 
abided by the rules of the game in the conflict arena. However, 
If the Israeli Government violates the rules of the game, then 
this government and the Jewish people will be first to pay the 
price." 
  The Hamas Movement called on its loyalists to declare a 
state 
of "mobilization and the highest degree of alertness."

<F P=106> [By 'Ali Nun] </F>
  [Text] London--Ibrahim Ghawshah, official spokesman of the 
Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, told AL-HAYAH yesterday that 
"the principle of reciprocal treatment is approved by all 
secular and religious laws. When Israeli Prime Minister Rabin 
stops killing our children and women, Hamas will then stop 
attacking Israeli civilians and commit itself to attacking 
soldiers and settlers only." 
  Replying to a question, he asserted that "the intifadah 
youths will perform miracles and prove that the Israeli Army is 
a paper tiger." Ghawshah rejected President Yasir 'Arafat's 
declared regret over the killing of Israeli civilians, and 
reiterated that "the ball is in Rabin's court. The blood of 
Palestinian children and women is not cheaper than the blood of 
Israeli civilians." 
  In a telephone contact, Ghawshah told AL-HAYAH that the 
Hadera operation, for which the 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam Battalions 
claimed credit, "came as part of the Palestinian people's 
reaction to the holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque's massacre. Moreover, 
it was directed against Israeli occupation and is part of the 
Hamas Movement strategy. We believe that there cannot be any 
peace as long as there are settlers on our land. No doubt, 
these strikes have put Rabin, 'Arafat, and U.S. President Bill 
Clinton in an impasse because they are in the same boat." 
  Ghawshah added: "These strikes prove that Rabin failed to 
fulfill his promise to the Jews that he would restore calm and 
guarantee security. These strikes happened in the territories 
occupied in 1948 under strict and serious security measures. 
Rabin's situation is being eroded. As for 'Arafat, the 
Palestinian people have bypassed him since the Ibrahimi Mosque's 
massacre in Hebron. When the 'Afula operation was carried out, 
Hamas managed to prove to the world that it can punish the 
criminals and murderers and impose respect for the will of 
Muslims and Arabs throughout the world." 
  Replying to a question, Ghawshah said that "Hamas was 
committed to attacking soldiers and settlers. What happened, 
however, is that Rabin did not stop killing children and women. 
Yesterday, they killed a pregnant woman, and they did not stop 
blowing up houses, which reminds us of the Nazi actions in 
Europe. Therefore, Hamas was obliged to expand the circle. The 
principle of reciprocal treatment is approved by all secular and 
religious laws. As we eagerly adhere to Islamic principles, we 
are aware that Islam permits reciprocal treatment for us. Thus, 
let them stop killing children and women, and Hamas will then 
commit itself to attacking only soldiers and settlers. If, 
however, they continue their actions, we tell them that the 
blood of Palestinian civilians is not cheaper than the blood of 
Jewish civilians. Rabin should be aware of this."

  [Text] Hamas will cooperate with the autonomy police on 
the condition that terror attacks inside the Green Line 
continue. Our correspondent Moti Amir reports that in the 
negotiations between the heads of Fatah and Hamas in Gaza, 
several agreements have been reached. These include an 
agreement of nonbelligerency between the two organizations, and 
cooperation for the removal of the Zionist enemy off the land of 
Palestine. A Fatah official in the Gaza Strip has said that 
Hamas also demands that Fatah ask Israel for compensation for 
the years of occupation.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Sufyan Abu-Zayidah, "prominent </F>
Fatah leader in the Gaza Strip," by Shalom Oren, place not 
given; from the "It Is All Talk" program -- live] 
  [Text] [Oren] We heard this morning that Hamas considers 
cooperation with the autonomy police conditional on continued 
terror attacks inside the Green Line boundaries. What did you 
reply? 
  [Abu-Zayidah] I believe there was nothing new in this 
morning's report by Moti Amir. That is, no new situation was 
created today which did not exist a week, a month, or a year ago. 
  [Oren] The recent attacks inside Israel, however, do create 
a new situation. 
  [Abu-Zayidah] I am speaking about our negotiations with 
Hamas, not about the location of terror attacks. We hold 
constant discussions in a bid to preserve the peace process, as 
Palestinians, as PLO members. 
  [Oren] What do you tell them when the say: We will 
cooperate only if we are allowed to go on with terror attacks in 
return? 
  [Abu-Zayidah] Obviously, there are serious differences 
between us and Hamas regarding the road we should take. We have 
covered quite a distance on the road to peace, the peace 
process. They do not believe in this way, and it is no secret; 
everybody knows this. There is no argument in which they say: 
You cooperate with us on terror, and we will cooperate in the 
negotiations. This is self evident. They have their way and we 
have ours. 
  [Oren] How, then, do the two organizations -- one of which 
wants peace and the other does not -- negotiate? 
  [Abu-Zayidah] There are many things we discuss. For 
example, both parties are not interested in a head-on collision 
between the two on the ground. Naturally, we both seek to 
prevent a civil war in the strip. We share an interest on this 
issue. Another example concerns the future of the process: 
Soon there will be a Palestinian rule here -- this is a fact! 
Knowing this, they know they will have to go along with the new 
situation, and discuss their incorporation in it. 
  [Oren] When autonomy is set up and there is a Palestinian 
police in the Gaza Strip, what will you do if, God forbid, 
terror acts are perpetrated inside the Green Line? 
  [Abu-Zayidah] As Palestinian members of the PLO, we will do 
whatever is required. We will implement and observe every 
agreement we sign. 
  [Oren] Will you arrest Hamas members when required? 
  [Abu-Zayidah] We will have our laws and it is clear that 
Hamas and PLO members will be arrested if they violate them. 
Anyone who violates the law will put himself in jeopardy. This 
is the way it is being done in every organized state, although 
we do not have a state yet. We will have our rule, which is 
clear, and it will have its own laws, and the citizens will have 
to observe the laws. 
  [Oren] But there is cooperation between Fatah and Hamas in 
the Gaza Strip. 
  [Abu-Zayidah] On what, for example? 
  [Oren] For example, speaking on the anniversary of the death 
of Abu-Jihad [Khalil al-Wazir], Muhsayn Abu-al-Ata, a Hamas 
leader, spoke about such cooperation. 
  [Abu-Zayidah] Look, there are no taxes on words, as you say. 
Let me tell you -- there is no cooperation on terror. We know 
that the terror attacks aim at damaging the peace process. How 
can we cooperate with this? We will, for example, cooperate on 
education. 
  [Oren] Do you have any bargaining chips with Hamas? We know 
that Hamas receives aid from Jordan while Fatah has financial 
problems. Hamas has arms, while Fatah handed over some of its 
weapons to the Army. 
  [Abu-Zayidah] You bet we have. We will be in charge. We 
will have a police force, money that we have, and money we are 
yet to receive. The rules of the games will change. 
  [Oren] What is your reaction to the report that Hamas is 
making cooperation with the autonomy police conditional on the 
continuation of attacks inside the Green Line? Do you 
absolutely reject this? 
  [Abu-Zayidah] We are not only rejecting this, we do not 
allow them to even say this. This request means sabotaging the 
peace process. Do you believe we will commit suicide? It is 
impossible. Anyone who thinks this way is insane. Believe me, 
they have never raised this condition. 
  [Oren] Do you deny that they did? 
  [Abu-Zayidah] They did not raise this. They cannot raise 
this. They know our policy.

  [Text] Gaza -- Dr. Mahmud al-Zahhar, yesterday denied 
having any knowledge of news agency reports that an agreement 
had been signed between Fatah and Hamas in the Gaza Strip. He 
accused Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin of raising such allegations 
in a bid to promote dubious aims. 
  Al-Zahhar said that relations between Fatah and Hamas were 
normal and that the meetings between the two sides are merely 
aimed at resolving some outstanding problems. 
  Regarding the arrival of the international observer forces 
to 
Hebron, al-Zahhar said: I still believe that this is an 
international trick to draw the Palestinians to the negotiating 
table. This will not change anything on the ground.

  [Text] Independent and party members of the opposition to 
the Oslo accord are experiencing a state of euphoria and a sense 
of victory over the accord and its supporters and their 
conviction that the Palestinians have lost all their weapons. 
  Informed sources believe the military escalation by Hamas 
and 
the Islamic Jihad has increased the popularity of Palestinian 
opposition to the Oslo accord in general. The sources told 
AL-HAYAH the increase in the popularity of any faction is not in 
the interest of the Alliance of Palestinian Forces (the 10 
factions) as an alliance. Rather, it is in the interest of some 
factions, especially the factions that took practical steps and 
did not confine their opposition to slogans and rhetoric. 
  The sources point out that the 'Afula, Ashdod, and Hadera 
operations carried out by Hamas and the Islamic Jihad, which are 
part of the alliance, have revitalized the two factions only and 
not the entire alliance. The alliance as a whole has so far 
failed to come up with any concrete plans. In fact, ideological 
differences relating to views and objectives have been apparent 
in practice and bolstered each faction's separate view of the 
Palestine question and its endeavor to achieve its factional 
objectives. 
  At any rate, the sources continue, the recent military 
actions have somewhat enhanced the image of the opposition and 
improved its situation, having reached a different stage in the 
recent months when Palestinian negotiators were conducting 
negotiations in Cairo about the stages of the administrative 
self-rule and making steps in this direction, regardless of the 
nature of these steps and agreement or disagreement with them. 
  The sources say the autonomy negotiations on the one hand 
and 
the opposition's inaction on the other have given rise to a 
third current in the recent four months that followed the 
signing of the Oslo accord. This third current rejects both 
attitudes. 
  Dr. Fathi al-Shaqaqi, secretary general of the Islamic Jihad 
Movement, told AL-HAYAH "those who were misled and thought we 
could do nothing are mistaken. We can strike hard. This is our 
practical choice in the current stage. When the movement 
carried out the Ashdod operation, the people regained confidence 
in us and in our ability to stage confrontation. We proved that 
we are not helpless. Therefore, the battle with the occupation 
will continue." 
  He added that after six months of the Oslo accord, the 
Palestinian man in the street has become bored of rhetoric that 
does not do anything. However, the situation is now different.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Legitimate Fedayeen Operation"] </F>
  [Text] Fedayeen operations in the occupied Arab 
territories are escalating to avenge the killing of the martyrs 
of the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in Hebron. A week after the 
'Afula suicide operation, as a result of which seven Israelis 
were killed and 50 others wounded, a Palestinian fedayee belong 
to Hamas carried out another suicide operation in Hadera, north 
of Hebron. As a result, six Israelis were killed and 30 others 
wounded, some seriously. 
  The recent operation came while Israel was celebrating the 
anniversary of its establishment at the expense of the 
Palestinian people and their territory. It also coincided with 
the date set for the completion of the Israeli forces' 
withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area in 
accordance with the Oslo agreement stipulations. 
  Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin is responsible for 
every 
drop of Palestinian or Israeli blood. Because the policies he 
has pursued, whether in running the negotiation process or in 
suppressing the intifadah inside the occupied territories, have 
encouraged extremism and subsequent violent operations, 
especially from the Israeli side. 
  At the negotiating table Rabin used the method of 
procrastination and evasion, thus voiding the peace process of 
any substance and putting the PLO in a very embarrassing 
situation. With regard to repression, more than 160 Palestinians 
have been martyred by Israeli troops' bullets since the signing 
of the Oslo agreement. 
  However, Rabin could have rescued the bilateral negotiations 
from their impasse when he assumed power, just before the eighth 
round. But he did not. He wanted them to revolve in the same 
vicious circle and with the same negotiating team for a further 
four rounds. 
  When the PLO opened the secret Oslo channel and reached an 
agreement stipulating withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho, the 
mentality of a fanatic Zionist general dominated that of a 
politician. And Rabin did his utmost as a former general to 
prevent the implementation of the agreement through impossible 
demands and by drowning the Taba and Cairo negotiations in minor 
details that inspire no assurance or trust. 
  Any fedayeen operation in the occupied territories can only 
be seen in the framework of the Palestinian Arab people's right 
to resist in order to get rid of the occupation. It is a 
legitimate right which all the other peoples have exercised, 
including the French people during the Nazi occupation and the 
U.S. people during their revolution against the British 
occupation under the leadership of George Washington. As long 
as the Israeli occupation continues, and as long as the Rabin 
government continues to encourage settlement building the 
occupied territories and to use rocket launchers to shell the 
homes of intifadah activists, the resistance and fedayeen 
operations will continue, regardless of the human and economic 
losses suffered by the people of the occupied territories. 
  The Palestinians -- moderates or extremists -- have had 
enough as a result of the Israeli repressive policies seeking 
both the land and conducting a constant starvation process for 
them. The moderates have been frustrated since the Rabin 
government's refusal to comply with the first date for its 
forces' withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho on 13 September. And 
the extremists had no option but to step up the fedayeen 
operations in retaliation to the settlers' provocations, which 
did not begin with the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre and will not 
end with the murder of a woman, three months pregnant, in 
Ramallah the days before yesterday evening. 
  The United States, sponsor of the peace process, shoulders a 
major part of the responsibility for the deterioration of 
conditions to this point. Because it has always preferred to 
overlook the Israeli murder operations against the Palestinians, 
refusing to provide international protection for the people of 
the occupied territories when the issue was referred to the 
United Nations and its Security Council. 
  The only solution to get out of this cycle of violence lies 
in ending the occupation and removing the settlements. As for 
trying to deal with conditions in the occupied territories as a 
security issue, not as an issue of a people deprived of their 
legitimate right to self-determination, it will lead to nothing 
except the escalation of resistance inside Palestine and further 
instability in the region.

    [Editorial Report] Tel Aviv SHISHI in Hebrew on 15 April in 
page 4 carries a 1,000-word report on an interview with PLO 
leader Yasir 'Arafat by 'Uzi Mahanaymi conducted on 11 April at 
PLO headquarters in Tunis. 
  Referring to Rabin, 'Arafat says: "I am pragmatic. I see 
things as they are. The man does not want to give me Gaza and 
Jericho." Moreover, he says, "Rabin regrets the whole business. 
Believe me." 
  Mahanaymi asks him why should he not accept what Rabin 
promised, Gaza and Jericho, and then worry about the details. 
  Shaking his head, 'Arafat replies: "Rabin does not want to 
give me Gaza and Jericho. I am sure about it." 
  Asked whether he can afford not to accept Gaza and Jericho 
or 
complete what he started in Washington, the PLO leader replies: 
"I can wait. I have waited so many years, I can wait another 
10 years. Just you wait and see what happens when I come out and 
tell the world that the process failed and why it did. You will 
see the reaction then. I have patience. I can wait." 
Moreover, 'Arafat notes, "I could have done business with 
Begin. I could have done business with Dayan. You know what -- 
even with Shamir I could." 
  Asked why he should not meet Rabin to break the stalemate, 
'Arafat replies: "There is no point to it. A meeting will not 
bring about a breakthrough." 
  When Mahanaymi remarks that Rabin could divert his efforts 
to 
talks with Syria, whereas he had crossed the point of no return, 
'Arafat answers: "I have patience. I am patient, I have all 
the time in the world." He goes on to say: "It takes two to 
tango, right? The same goes for peace. They do not want to. 
So, what can I do?" 
  Commenting on the way Israel conducts the negotiations, he 
says: "They came to me in Cairo with their walkie-talkies. 
Everybody has his own personal walkie-talkie. They call 
Israel. They step out to the garden and speak. One reports to 
Baraq, another reports to Peres, and the third reports to Rabin. 
Is that the way to work? I swear to you, President Mubarak was 
kept waiting four hours until they finished all their talking. 
  "I will not forget what happened with Peres. We came to talk 
business, and all of a sudden he gets on the walkie-talkie with 
Rabin. I saw his hair stand on end and his mood change. 
  "And then there was the business of adjourning the talks 
because of Holocaust Remembrance Day. What was this all about? 
If Remembrance Day was the reason, then how do you explain that 
the economic talks in Paris continued? Not only did they hold 
talks on Remembrance Day, but also on the Sabbath. So, what is 
going on here? The economic talks are more important than the 
political talks. And, if they were really adjourned because of 
Remembrance Day, why did the Paris talks continue that day?" 
  Asked where the Americans come into the picture, 'Arafat 
"does not reply, and makes a dismissive gesture with his hand." 
  Wrapping up the interview, Mahanaymi asks 'Arafat the same 
question he has asked him for years: "Can a Western and 
European-oriented Israel, unwilling to assimilate into its 
environment, survive in the Middle East?" The PLO leader 
reported "smiled, but was not prepared to answer this question 
either."

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Ahmad Quray', head of the PLO </F>
Economic Department, by unidentified reporter, in the studio, 
place and date not given; from the "With the Events" program -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Reporter] Good evening. 
  [Quray'] Good evening to you. 
  [Reporter] How true is the report that an economic agreement 
between Israel and the PLO is likely next week? 
  [Quray'] I think both sides want to see these negotiations 
wrapped up, after the two sides have probed each other's 
position. I hope the next round of talks will see us reach an 
agreement. There still are some fundamental issues pending... 
  [Reporter, interrupting] In which areas? 
  [Quray'] The question of imports is presenting difficulties. 
For the Palestinian side this is of vital importance, since it 
has an Arab dimension and affects Palestinian relations with the 
Arab states. The imports issue also bears on the difficult 
circumstances under which the Palestinians are living and coming 
up against in Israeli rules and regulations. There are other 
issues like the monetary system and what currencies will be 
legal tender. Insurance and tourism also have yet to be 
addressed. 
  [Reporter] Will the current water-sharing talks in Muscat 
have a positive impact on economic talks that will open in Paris 
tomorrow? 
  [Quray'] The two sets of talks are unconnected. The Muscat 
talks are mulitlateral, the Paris talks are bilateral, 
addressing economic concerns. 
  [Reporter] But cooperation on the wider front of the Middle 
East may help along the bilateral ties between Israel and the 
PLO. 
  [Quray'] We have an agreement that we are working to put in 
place. Regarding Israel's relations with the Arab world, this 
issue remains tied to a wider durable and comprehensive peace 
with all the Arab parties and to Israel's withdrawal from the 
occupied Arab territories in the Golan Heights, Jordan, and the 
West Bank and Gaza. When this kind of peace comes, the climate 
will recommend itself to rearranging the regional landscape so 
as to ensure security, stability, and prosperity for this region 
that has long suffered from wars. 
  [Reporter] You are in touch with Palestinian negotiators in 
Cairo. Does it look that these talks will be completed soon? 
  [Quray'] I hope that agreement will be reached soon there, 
now that the issues have been defined. There are not many 
controversial issues left. Most of the issues have more or less 
been settled. With questions of the Palestinian police and 
security now virtually settled, I think it will be possible to 
sort out the issues that remain if Israel is willing. 
  [Reporter] As long as there is a Palestinian willingness to 
reach agreement, I think there is a possibility. 
  [Quray'] We have the will to reach an agreement and get to 
the territories. An agreement cannot be viable and credible 
before the withdrawal begins and the Palestinian delegation 
arrives in the land. 
  [Reporter] When we were in Washington, you promised that you 
would be here in the country no later than February. Is there a 
set date for the PLO leadership to arrive in Gaza and Jericho? 
  [Quray'] If the Cairo talks and the economic agreement are 
completed, I think it will be a matter of days before the 
Palestinians enter Gaza and Jericho. We hope this will be in 
early May. I am not setting a fixed date. However, further 
postponement will help neither the agreement nor the peace 
process. 
  [Reporter] Mr. Ahmad Quray', head of the PLO's Economic 
Department, thank you. 
  [Quray'] Thank you.

  [Excerpt] In recent weeks, scores of collaborators with 
Israel have received blue Israeli identity cards. This came 
after the PLO, in its negotiations with Israel, refused to issue 
a general amnesty for collaborators. 
  This identity card permits collaborators and their families 
to live wherever they wish in Israel. A large number of 
collaborators have expressed their intention to reside in Arab 
villages within the Green Line. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Tzvi Gilat: "`There Will Be No Civil War in the </F>
Gaza Strip'"] 
  [Text] Spirits in the Gaza Strip were markedly low last 
Wednesday [6 April] compared with the week of euphoria 
experienced at the sight of the accelerated IDF [Israel Defense 
Forces] withdrawal from the Strip. The Islamic Jihad called for 
the monthly general strike as it does on the 6th of every month, 
reminding the locals that the intifadah is, in fact, not over. 
The streets were covered with rocks and the remains of burned 
tires. 
  The Palestinians failed to show up for the ceremony the IDF 
had prepared at the entrance to the al-Shati' refugee camp to 
hand over the police building. The disappointed Israeli 
policemen quickly folded up the refreshment tables. The 
disappointed residents started to slowly move away as IDF 
soldiers began pushing them with increasing determination, 
having no choice as the friction became intolerable. 
  Dozens of local residents crowded the gates of the Bayt 
Lahiya Civil Administration offices, seeking exit permits to 
Israel, while giant cranes lifted the barracks one by one. It 
looked as if all that will be left there soon will be the long 
line of unsolved problems. 
  In the afternoon, when the reports on the 'Afula car bomb 
started coming in, my taxi driver's face turned gray. He 
recalled the preintifadah days "when we used to work at a steak 
house in Rishon Leziyyon from morning till night and go home to 
the Strip once a week. It was quiet and good." From his point 
of view, a life of exploitation and humiliation is better that 
the current situation. "Now they will expand the closure," he 
said with concern. "You will leave, and we will remain here 
between the fences. What will we have? All the space between 
Gaza and Rafah. You can drive through our entire autonomy and 
the car engine will not even warm up." 
  Twilight is the hour of great hopes and of fears. At the PLO 
headquarters in the Rimal neighborhood, the deportees who 
returned the day before through the Rafah crossing repeatedly 
hug their friends at the local command. There is hope in their 
eyes. They are certain the road is leading to the establishment 
of a state. 
  Most of the deportees maintained daily contacts with the 
Gaza 
Strip. While in Tunis, Rashid Abu-Shibak, founder of the Fatah 
Hawks, was a member of the Gaza committee which liaised between 
Chairman 'Arafat and his comrades in the field. Upon arrival, 
he was appointed chairman of the liaison committee with the IDF. 
As soon as he arrived at the border crossing, he held a 
business meeting with Brigadier General Doron Almog, commander 
of the IDF forces in the Gaza Strip and his Israeli counterpart. 
A business meeting between two practical men. As a rule, the 
higher you go in the level of command, the more people speak to 
the point and not in slogans. 
  Midhat al-Salim, who had been serving a life sentence, was 
released in the Jibril deal, arrested time and again, and 
deported in early 1991. He returned yesterday and already wants 
to start working. He would rather not talk about the past and 
would not discuss the reason he was given a life sentence. All 
he would say is that he used to be a member of one the top 
secret squads operating in the Gaza Strip in the 1980's, named 
after Rafiq Salama, who, according to him, was killed on 25 
December 1990. He pronounces the date in the way a soldier 
would state his serial number. 
  "It is unhealthy to discuss the past," al-Salim says. "We do 
not wish to intimidate the Israelis. In the past, I acted like 
a soldier fighting for peace, and I am going to fight for peace 
now as well." What will he do now? Al-Salim does not yet have 
an official assignment but says that the bulk of his work will 
be against "our extremists." A local Shin Bet? He prefers not 
to use this word. "We will reach an understanding with them," he 
assures me. "They will know their limitations." It is to be 
assumed that he means Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement]. 
  Al-Salim has no difficulties assimilating back into the 
Gaza Strip after being away for three years. Sufyan 
Abu-Zayidah, a local Fatah leader, was a member of the same 
terror squad with him. 
  Abu-Zayidah, an eloquent person, carefully puts forth his 
ideas in Hebrew. Alert to language nuances, he tries to 
introduce to the Israeli media the idea of peace and 
coexistence. In an interview he granted Karmela Menashe of Qol 
Yisra'el, he asked that she say at the end "the PLO offices, 
Gaza," and not "the PLO offices in Gaza." 
  His office and the office of the Arab affairs adviser at the 
Civil Administration maintain frequent fax communication. When 
asked, Abu-Zayidah says that in the autonomy, he will be the 
Jewish affairs adviser. 
  Abu-Zayidah shares an office at the central PLO building 
with 
Hisham 'Abd-al-Raziq. There is no clear distribution of 
authorities between them; everything is being done in 
cooperation, but Abu- Zayidah focuses more on coordination with 
the IDF, while 'Abd-al-Raziq is primarily engaged in 
coordinating with the other Palestinian organizations in the 
Strip, including Hamas. 
  He is an impressive man, age 39 but looks older. He was 
released from prison only four months ago, shortly before 
completing a 20-year prison term, in response to a special 
request from Yasir 'Arafat. He was appointed a member of the 
Fatah leadership while in the Nafha prison. There, together 
with jailed Hamas leaders, he signed a document regulating 
coordinated operations in the Gaza Strip by the two 
organizations. As is well known, the Gaza Strip is being run 
from the city and from prisons. 
  'Abd-al-Raziq was a student in Lebanon when he joined Fatah. 
After he returned from his studies, he prepared an explosive 
charge and took it to Rishon Leziyyon to retaliate for the 
killing of three Palestinian leaders in the al-Firdan operation 
(he, too, utters the exact date this happened as if it were the 
date he joined the army). The charge exploded in his hands, he 
stresses; there were no Israeli casualties. He still carries 
the scars of that day: numerous scars, a split lip sewn 
together by undergoing plastic surgery several times, a twisted 
hand. He has nothing but praise for the medical treatment he 
received at Asaf Harofe Hospital. 
  In prison, he expanded his studies. He studied the history 
of the Haganah and read the writings of Ben-Gurion, Rabin, 
Dayan, and Begin -- all in Hebrew. He says that the books 
influenced and encouraged him. "I was impressed by the 
determination of those men, by their ability to reach their 
goals despite the difficulties. It helped me through the 
darkest days." To get to know Jewish history even better, he 
took an Open University course called "From Jerusalem to Yavne." 
He is better versed in the history of Yohanan Ben-Zakay and the 
Roman rule than most Israelis. 
  You must have compared this with your situation, I 
suggested. 
You must have viewed the Palestinians as the Jews with the 
Israeli occupation forces acting the part of the Romans. 
  "There is no comparison," Hisham 'Abd-al-Raziq says. "The 
Romans were much worse. They tried to wipe out an entire 
culture." 
  'Abd-al-Raziq is also very careful with his choice of words. 
When I ask him to confirm that he was one of the leaders of the 
"revolt of the security prisoners" staged in Israeli prisons, he 
asks that I replace the word "revolt" with "struggle for 
rights." What is the purpose of making such fine distinctions? 
"It is important to be precise. We care very much about how 
the Israeli public opinion reads us." 
  Why do you care so much about the Israeli public? Israel 
will soon be out of here. Why not deal with your own public? I 
asked. 
  "The Israeli public opinion is very important. Israel is a 
democratic society. Public opinion will determine what will 
take place here. It is important that you realize that we are 
not extremists. We are sensible people who know what their 
goals are. Naturally, our goal is an independent state, but it 
is important to point out that this state will seek peace with 
Israel. Without it, we stand no chance to exist. We need peace 
for domestic and external reasons. 
  "Unfortunately, Palestinian public opinion is less important 
at this time. We are not yet a democratic society. Our people 
are motivated by emotions. Sometimes I have to speak to the 
people's sentiments to promote our strategic goals. We have no 
other option but to become a democratic society. Anyone who 
fails to understand that understands nothing." 
  His remarks imply that he attributes the failure to 
understand to the chief leaders in Tunis. 'Abd-al-Raziq is not 
worried. They will understand. They have no choice. 'Arafat, 
too, will understand. "So far, our organization itself has been 
undemocratic," he admits. "The regime is undemocratic. In 
fact, there is hardly any regime to speak of." 
  Conversations with former prisoners, who constitute the 
local 
Gaza leadership, are in some peculiar way easy and relaxed. I 
am certain that IDF officers come across this daily. These are 
people who lost their youth in prison, who were subjected to the 
most rugged interrogations, who proved their character and 
determination in the toughest tests possible. Lies do not 
interest them, and the feeling that nothing could scare them any 
more helps them to speak openly with both Major General Matan 
Vilna'i and Yasir 'Arafat. 
  'Abd-al-Raziq says with indifference that he is not 
concerned 
about his future station or standing. 'Arafat may decide 
whatever he likes; he does not depend on his decision. "I have 
never been a man searching for a position. My position found 
me." He estimates that whoever comes to rule Gaza will require 
his qualifications -- his personality, ideological fortitude, 
organizational skills, integrity, his excellent Hebrew, and his 
understanding of the Israeli system and Israeli soul. 
Invaluable assets. 
  The seminar "From Jerusalem to Yavne" taught him how 
dangerous religious fanaticism is. He has a dream: to 
establish a universal movement opposing religious fanaticism. 
And he is the man who oversees the daily coordination with 
Hamas. 
  "It is true," he says, "that we maintain an open 
communication channel. I assure you: Hamas knows its place 
perfectly well, and it knows that it should avoid starting a 
civil w}F will return to Gaza. I can allay your fears: Even if 
it happens -- and you know to what organization I belong and how 
much I want my organization to do well -- even if Hamas comes to 
power, it will happen democratically, while safeguarding 
democratic values, because without democracy, we will all go 
down here." 
  Authoritative Israeli sources also believe that Hamas will 
not hinder the PLO and that it will play by the rules in the 
hope of enlisting the support of the majority of the public, the 
majority that does not identify with any side. 
  The prevailing opinion is that Hamas must not cause a 
"fitnah." Fitnah, or civil strife, is a major taboo according to 
the Koran. The practical implication of this Koran law is that 
Hamas will have to avoid attacking inside the 
Palestinian-controlled territory. As the PLO is in charge of 
the Qatif Bloc settlers' security, a Hamas attack on the Qatif 
settlers will force the PLO to shoot at Hamas members, possibly 
pitching the entire system into a domestic war. The Hamas 
leadership will seek to prevent such a development, IDF elements 
estimate, for practical as well as ideological reasons. "There 
must be no private militias, either on our or the other side," 
Hisham 'Abd-al-Raziq says. 
  Which means, I told him, that the Qatif Bloc settlers will 
be 
safer than Israelis anywhere. 
  "That is very possible," 'Abd-al-Raziq says seriously, "and 
it naturally depends on them as well. We obviously do not want 
them here; they should start preparing for a possible departure. 
But it is equally obvious that we must succeed in carrying out 
the task we have undertaken. If the Gaza First experiment 
fails, we will never reach a permanent arrangement and 
independence. And we want independence." 
  Hisham 'Abd-al-Raziq and his colleagues understand the 
reality. In Tunis, it is less understood. Nabil Sha'th placed 
a mine on the negotiating table by demanding last Wednesday that 
an armed and uniformed police force enter Gaza amid festive 
processions. The IDF was opposed, as was the local leadership. 
The locals understand very well that the deployment of an armed 
Palestinian police force before it has been granted formal 
powers will raise unattainable expectations. The locals prefer 
the policemen to enter quietly, to remain inside their camps, 
and to train until the right moment when are they able to take 
up their posts. 
  Right now, there is talk of about 3,000 Palestine Liberation 
Army [PLA] members. Thousands of locals enrolled at the 
recruitment offices, but they have had no training as yet. They 
will be unable to take up their posts for another two months. 
Actually, 'Arafat's appointments, against which no one dares to 
speak out, are more than surprising. The PLA generals have had 
no operational experience, and their knowledge of the terrain is 
minimal. Even 'Arafat's local appointment is odd: He appointed 
Zakariyah al-Agha, an engineer, as head of Fatah in the Strip. 
It is a worthy position, but in practice, it entails very few 
powers. Al-Agha is preoccupied primarily with settling feuds 
and conversing with journalists. 
  The PLO's offices in the Strip are situated in his private 
residence in the Rimal neighborhood. Not to worry, al-Agha owns 
another villa for his own use. He rarely makes an appearance at 
the offices. He has nothing to look for among the determined 
young people who populate the building. When the local leaders 
waited for the returning deportees at the Rafah terminal, the 
young people banded together, laughing and carrying on like a 
bunch of reserve soldiers meeting after an operation. A 
detached al-Agha remained standing alone by the door. He does 
not belong to this generation; neither does 'Arafat. It is to 
be hoped that he is sufficiently astute to give this generation 
the role which it -- and only it -- can play in the process. 
  Israel is concerned about the security issue. The issue is 
more or less closed. Yet civilian issues have hardly been 
discussed at all, and they are a true time bomb. Israel did not 
really invest in Gaza during its rule. A considerable part of 
the taxes levied from the residents of the territories was used 
to pay the Civil Administration personnel's salaries. The 
Israeli command officers -- soon they will become mere 
coordination officials -- had the rank of deputy directors and 
the salaries to go with it. They are leaving the Strip. For a 
while, they will work from the coordination offices in the Erez 
checkpoint. The services will be left to the locals. 
  Some of the local administration officials have been 
mistakenly labeled collaborators. It is to be hoped that 
'Arafat will allow them to keep their jobs and that he will not 
appoint his own people, who have no idea how the system 
operates. "We will miss the administration yet," a local 
resident, whose name is being withheld for obvious reasons, told 
me. "In our system, everything is corrupt. You need to know 
someone even to get yourself admitted to a hospital. If you do 
not know anyone, you are dirt." 
  At the moment, people fear the Palestinian rule more than 
the Israeli administration. For example, there is a Bedouin 
family, from among the Beersheba refugees, that has been living 
in Rimal since 1948. They built their house without a building 
permit, as a matter of course. Several times the IDF issued 
demolition orders, which were never executed. They are now 
afraid that their 30-year tenure will be of no avail against the 
interests of the PLO apparatus officials, who covet the 
expensive land. 
  Almost every family in the Gaza refugee camps owes money to 
the Electricity Corporation. The Civil Administration 
occasionally cut off the power supply and then reconnected it. 
Now the residents are afraid that the Palestinian regime will 
cut it off because of its dire need for funds. 
  The health services are in very poor shape, for which Israel 
is basically responsible. The al-Shifa' government hospital is 
unable to provide much of the required medical treatment. There 
is not a single oncology clinic in the entire Strip. In fact, 
there is only one qualified oncologist. There is still no 
agreement on how people will receive treatment in Israel. 
People will simply die. 
  There is still no agreement on how Gaza laborers will work 
in 
Israel. The present bureaucracy will double and triple in size 
when Palestinian rule takes over. There are no development or 
welfare plans, and people are afraid that, at least at the 
beginning, oppression will be worse than before. 
  The standard of living will drop. The more it will drop, the 
less the population will support the peace process. Unless an 
accelerated economic development process is launched, people 
will be disenchanted with the PLO and cross over to Hamas, 
augmenting its strength. A local resident told me: "When a man 
does not have bread, what else does he have, except God?" At 
present, Gaza Strip fundamentalists fear that they will be 
persecuted, as they are in other Arab countries. But with 
popular support, "Allah is great." 
  "I have as yet to see anything happening," says a local 
young 
man at one of the social clubs which cropped up after the Oslo 
agreement. A club was established in each neighborhood. In the 
future, they will be the foundation of political power. "In the 
meantime, there is a curfew. I cannot go over to my brother's 
after 2100. First we would like to see the PLO lift the curfew."

  [Text] The Golboddin-Dostam militia once again embarked on 
aggression against the Islamic army's positions and put the 
residential regions of Kabul city under a rain of rocket and 
mortar fire. The military correspondent of the BAKHTAR 
INFORMATION AGENCY reports that the criminal Golboddin-Dostam 
militia, following yesterday's failed attack -- launching 
rockets and firing heavy weapons -- last night also launched 
hundreds of rockets from the type of SAKAR, BM-12, BM-21, and 
mortar mine on residential regions of Kabul city. As a result 
of the launched rockets, which mostly landed on the residential 
regions of the 11th, 10th, fourth and second wards of the city, 
a number of our compatriots were martyred and a number were 
seriously injured. As a result of this lunatic action of 
Hekmatyar, in addition to loss of life, a number of residential 
houses, and government buildings located in the above wards were 
either destroyed or damaged. One mosque located in Khairkhana 
III was demolished. 
  The report adds that the infamous Golboddin-Dostam militia 
last night embarked on infantry aggression against the positions 
of the Islamic state's forces from the direction of Bala Hesar. 
It was foiled in the same way as their other unsuccessful 
attacks. With the blessing of Almighty God, courageous 
resistance by the mojahedin and soldiers of the Islamic army, 
the enemy was forced to retreat. A responsible security source 
put the enemy losses at 20 dead and 10 injured. 
  Military observers believe the recent actions by the 
Golboddin-Dostam mercenary militiamen in Kabul are an effort to 
recompense and disguise the repeated defeats of militia in the 
north and to disrupt the peace process in the country. The 
murderer and adventurist militiamen of Golboddin-Dostam can only 
see their political-military survival in fighting and in 
continuation of tension. This claim can be entirely 
substantiated by Golboddin Hekmatyar's (?utterance) made 
yesterday at a meeting with the peace delegation consisting of 
ulema from Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Bangladesh and some Jehadi 
leaders and personalities of Afghanistan. In reply to a 
question by a peace-seeking ulema who asked Hekmatyar to 
refrain, for the sake of holy Koran, from further bloodshed, 
destruction, and further defaming of Jehad and Islam, and asked 
him to open supply routes for the Muslim and innocent people of 
Kabul and to stop firing blind rockets, Hekmatyar with anger and 
disrespect said: I will fight for another 25 years against the 
Islamic sovereignty and people. And I would not reverse until I 
gain power. 
  This is happening at a time when esteemed professor 
Borhanoddin Rabbani, president of the Islamic State of 
Afghanistan, despite unforgivable crimes committed by Golboddin, 
has displayed flexibility and [words indistinct] in honor of the 
peace delegation from the fraternal countries of Saudi, 
Pakistan, and Bangladesh, as well as Jehadi leaders and 
personalities of Afghanistan. Relying on the usual strategy of 
the Islamic state, which is resolving the country's issues by 
talks and understanding, Rabbani declared a unilateral 
cease-fire in Kabul. But the Golboddin-Dostam militia, ignoring 
the cease-fire, have been attacking the positions of the Islamic 
army and residential regions during the past two days with heavy 
weapons and infantry forces. The Islamic state's forces 
responded to these attacks by defending their positions and 
safeguarding the life and property of the civil population in 
Kabul city.

  [Text] Fifty Dostum militia surrendered to forces of the 
Islamic army in Fariab Province. Reports received by BAKHTAR 
INFORMATION AGENCY from Fariab Province say the men, headed by 
Habibollah, realizing the inhuman and un-Islamic character of 
Dostum's militia, joined the forces of Jehadi Division 24 of the 
province in Qoshqar area in Fariab Province along with five 
rocket launchers, eight PK machine guns, and two ZK1 machine 
guns. The report adds that the surrendered people expressed 
their hatred of the crimes and atrocities of Dostumites and 
promised that, with all their will, they are ready to fight 
against Dostum's militia.

  [Text] Esteemed Pir Sayyed Ahmad Gaylani, leader of the 
Mahaz-e Meli-ye Eslami [National Islamic Front], asks for a 
cease-fire, first of all, for solving the country's current 
problems. After meeting the UN secretary general's special 
envoy in Peshawar, Pir Gaylani in his interview with a VOA 
reporter said: After the cease-fire a Loya Jerga [great council] 
or an urgent invited council should be set up. The council 
should have the power to appoint the future government and its 
leader, in order to take the place of the present government 
after the end of term of esteemed professor Borhanoddin 
Rabbani's leadership. Pir Sayyed Ahmad Gaylani further said: 
The above Shura council is to start work under the supervision 
of the United Nations and Conference of the Islamic Countries 
and is to take urgent action for the restoration of security. He 
added: The future government can devise the constitution through 
the Loya Jerga, in which the people's genuine representatives 
can take part. Thus, the ground will be prepared for a free 
election.

Afghanistan, and that camps have been opened to retrain and 
rehabilitate them in order to send them to their original

  [Text] The signing of the GATT by India at Marrakesh has 
evoked mixed reaction. The former prime minister and the 
Samajwadi Janata Party leader, Mr. Chandra Shekhar, has 
criticized the signing of the GATT adopting Dunkel proposals by 
India. Addressing public meetings at Chandigarh, Ludhiana and 
Amritsar yesterday, Mr. Chandra Shekhar said these proposals 
will badly affect and erode the Indian values swadeshi 
[indigenousness] and self-sufficiency as propounded by Mahatama 
Gandhi and other leaders. 
  Reacting to the signing of GATT by the government, the Uttar 
Pradesh chief minister, Mulayam Singh Yadav, said the people 
should have been taken into confidence before signing it. He 
said the chief ministers should have been consulted before 
signing the agreement which would affect the national interests. 
The Bihar chief minister, Mr. Lalu Prasad Yadav, addressing a 
public meeting at Sopol, charged the Congress-I with selling out 
the country's sovereignty by signing the agreement. 
  The BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] yesterday observed a 
protest 
day in Madhya Pradesh against the signing of GATT, while the 
Communist Party of India-Marxist observed the black day in the 
state. Janata Dal workers held demonstrations in some towns of 
Uttar Pradesh. However, the Congress-I has welcomed the signing 
of agreement by India and charged the Opposition with indulging 
in a disinformation campaign on the issue. Speaking to 
reporters in New Delhi yesterday, the party spokesman, Mr. V.N. 
Gadgil, said the agreement will boost India's agricultural and 
textile exports.

<F P=106> [Commentary by N. Madhavan] </F>
  [Text] The signing of the declaration for a new 
multilateral trade regime at Marrakesh by 125 countries, 
including India, marks the end of a long and arduous journey 
that began at Punta Del Este in Uruguay across the Atlantic 
nearly a decade ago, but there may still be some hurdles to go. 
Even as the agreement for a new multilateral trade regime was 
being signed, other indications signalled that some irritants 
still remain. The United States and Japan have not quite ended 
their trade dispute and the United States and the European Union 
have not taken back the demand to link social issues like labor 
standards out of the basic framework of the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade. Nevertheless, the Marrakesh accord signed 
last night is a historic step because it considerably reduces 
the walls of protectionism which stood in the way of freer 
trade. For one, tariff barriers are expected to come down by 40 
percent in all member countries. Second, the accord clears the 
way for the World Trade Organization -- WTO -- which will 
replace the GATT from 1 January next year and police world trade 
disputes. The final hurdle remains in the form of the national 
level ratification of the agreement in the legislatures of 
member countries, but it can be safely said that the ground has 
been laid for a body which will act as the arbiter in trade 
disputes. Further, the success of the Marrakesh accord will 
depend upon the ability of member countries to stick to their 
promises of functioning under the WTO and not resort to any act 
which will undermine it pending its creation. In particular, 
countries like the United States will have to stay away from 
selective bilateral action such as the invocation of Super 301 
Law which forbids investment in bilateral (?grounds). 
  For the developing countries, this opens up crucial avenues. 
India particularly stands to gain by greater market access for 
its exports in agriculture and textiles, but it will have to 
ensure that the code is implemented in letter and spirit so that 
in aspects like patenting of seeds and drug prices apprehensions 
that India may be affected do not come true. India will also 
have to guard against the misuse of social issues like human 
rights, environmental safety norms, and labor standards for 
trade purposes by powerful countries. India is committed to 
these values itself, but both the timing and the manner in which 
these issues have been smuggled into the context of the Uruguay 
round shows that the WTO may be here, but a watchful eye is 
needed all the same. However, India has once again shown that 
it articulates and leads Third World's interests by raising the 
issue of immigration barriers in developed countries which act 
as a deterrent to the flow of labor which is an economic 
service. In sum, it is clear that India and the world must 
ensure that the gains from trade must go hand in hand with 
concern for justice and equality.

  [Text] The Gujarat chief minister, Mr. Chhabildas Mehta, 
has complimented the prime minister and the commerce minister, 
Mr. Pranab Mukherjee, for signing the GATT agreement. In a 
message welcoming the agreement, Mr. Mehta said it will lead to 
increase in the export of food products and will provide a boost 
to agroindustries, thereby benefiting the farming community. 
  The Haryana chief minister, Mr. Bhajan Lal, has also 
welcomed 
the signing of the agreement. Talking to newsmen in Chandigarh 
today, he said all sections of society, including farmers and 
the industrialists, will benefit. Mr. Bhajan Lal said India 
will now be able to trade with 125 countries and the foodgrain 
exports to other countries will increase. The chief minister 
said that the farmers will get better prices for their produce 
and the percentage of subsidy to them will increase. 
  The BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] leader, Dr. Murli Manohar 
Joshi, has criticized the government for signing the accord. 
Addressing a press conference in Calcutta today, he said his 
party will oppose any move by the government to amend the 
existing laws in the wake of the GATT treaty.

  [Text] The commerce minister has strongly justified India 
signing the new GATT deal, saying the opposition stand is based 
on narrow partisan considerations. Mr. Pranab Mukherji, who 
returned to New Delhi from Marrakesh this morning, said there is 
no rationale in the demand for opting out of the global trading 
system. He pointed out that 20 more countries want to join the 
new trade agreement in addition to the 125 countries which are 
signatories to it.

  [Text] Official sources in New Delhi have clarified that 
there is no change in India's stand on Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty [NPT]. New Delhi believes that nuclear nonproliferation 
must be universal, comprehensive, and nondiscriminatory. The 
sources said the prime minister had categorically stated this 
position in his recent address to the Army commanders 
conference. They were reacting to press reports that the BJP 
[Bharatiya Janata Party] leader, Mr. Atal behari Vajpayee, 
expressed the view that the prime minister's observations over 
the issue needs clarification. 
  The sources said Mr. Narasimha Rao in his speech made it 
clear that any attempt to restrict India's nuclear option will 
be unacceptable and unrealistic in view of Pakistan having 
acquired nuclear weapon capability. There is also proliferation 
of such weapons recently.

  [Text] New Delhi -- In a significant development Germany 
has said its economic relations with India will not be guided by 
non-economic issues like human rights and child labour. 
  This was stated by German Minister for Economics Guenter 
Rexrodt at a meeting organised by Federation of Indian Chambers 
of Commerce and Industry (FICCI), Associated Chamber of Commerce 
and Industry (ASSOCHAM), Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) 
and Indo-German Chamber of Commerce here on Wednesday. 
  The German Minister's statement assumes significance in the 
wake of US' attempt to bring in human rights issues in GATT 
negotiations. The German Minister made it clear that his country 
was committed to free and unrestricted trade. 
  Rexrodt, who is accompanied by a high-level business 
delegation from Germany to attend the 11th Indo German Joint 
Commission meeting, said his country will not use non-tariff and 
noneconomic issues in trade negotiations, he said. "This is the 
stand we have taken in the Uruguay Round of negotiations," he 
said. 
  Indian industry is fearing that some developed countries may 
block exports from India by creating non-tariff hurdles such as 
human rights. "Germany never boycotts goods from other countries 
on the pretext of non-economic issues," Rexrodt said in response 
to a specific query. "Indian goods as well as Indian businessmen 
are welcome in our country," he said. 
  Referring to the pending bilateral accord between India and 
Germany on civil aviation, he said the "delay" was because the 
countries were sending "wrong signals." 
  "I must say the administrative process in India is 
complicated and takes a long time to finalise," he remarked 
adding that Germany attached importance to this bilateral accord 
on air transportation and regretted the delay. 
  Admitting that some countries had raised such non-economic 
and non-tariff issues in GATT negotiations, he said Germany was 
of the firm view that such issues should not be brought in trade 
negotiations. Rexrodt said Germany was also against "social 
dumping" as different countries had different social standards.

  [Text] The home minister, Mr. S.B. Chavan, says conditions 
in Kashmir are favorable for initiating a political process. 
Speaking to newspersons in Bombay yesterday, he said the 
antimilitancy drive in the valley has received a good response. 
Mr. Chavan said the people now realize that the activities of 
the militants have nothing to do with religion. Meanwhile, the 
CPI [Communist Party of India] has demanded immediate 
consultations by the national and the state parties to initiate 
a political process in Jammu and Kashmir. In a letter to the 
prime minister, Mr. Narasimha Rao, the party general secretary, 
Mr. Inderjit Gupta, said the government is relying mainly on 
administrative measures to tackle the serious problem. The CPI 
is opposed to this approach. The Janata Dal leader, Mr. George 
Fernandes, has urged the militants in Jammu and Kashmir to give 
up the path of violence and come to the negotiating table. 
Talking to newsmen in Jammu yesterday, he said this will help 
in restoring democratic process in the state. 
  In Jammu and Kashmir, 11 police personnel have been 
dismissed 
from service for dereliction of duty. They were found wanting 
in preventing militants from setting ablaze a bridge in Anantnag 
District. They did not put up resistance expected from them to 
avert the militants. The state government had announced earlier 
that stringent action will be taken against the defaulting 
police personnel. It also said the police personnel who show 
courage to thwart the militants action will be rewarded. As 
reported 20 policemen were dismissed last year on this account.

  [Text] In Jammu and Kashmir, security forces claim to have 
achieved notable success in their operations against the 
militants. One hundred and three militants were killed during 
the last month. Security forces have seized more than 13,000 
weapons, including 11 lakh ammunition, and about 40,000 
grenades. An official spokesman told our Jammu correspondent 
that this is mainly because of cooperation being extended by 
people who are fed up with militancy sponsored by Pakistan.

  [Text] The prime minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, has 
reiterated that the nuclear capability will never be rolled back 
and no stone will be left unturned to make the country's defense 
impregnable. The prime minister was addressing a meeting of the 
formation commanders at the General Headquarters in Rawalpindi 
today. The prime minister said indigenous production will get 
due priority and we shall either induct additional F-16's or 
make alternate arrangements. The concerned agencies are 
exploring the market for induction of new tanks and we also 
intend to induct new submarines. 
  About foreign policy, the prime minister said what happened 
at Geneva proves beyond doubt the hollowness of the human rights 
crisis raised by the West. It also leaves no ambiguity that in 
the prevalent global climate strategic alliances are reshaped 
for better economic gains. She said we have to face this 
challenge and make our foreign policy more vibrant. 
  Spelling out the main achievements in respect of foreign 
policy, the prime minister said the Kashmir dispute has been 
revived as a live international issue in the United Nations and 
other international forums. This has been evidenced by 
statements of President Clinton and the UN secretary general. 
The International Committee of the Red Cross and foreign 
diplomats visiting the held valley had confirmed perpetration of 
continuing human rights violations in the wake of claimed 
transparency. Pakistan she said, is taking necessary steps to 
bring desired stability in the Afghanistan situation. The key 
to solution of the problems lies with the Afghan people. Ms. 
Benazir Bhutto said her government is endeavoring for the 
promotion of a new perception of Pakistan as an enlightened 
democratic Islamic and just state. 
  She made special reference to the revival of relations with 
the United States with particular reference to the depiction of 
Kashmir as a disputed territory by the United States and 
expression of concern about violation of human rights there and 
efforts by the Clinton Administration to maintain relations with 
Pakistan despite the Pressler Amendment. 
  About the promotion of relations with the Central Asian 
Republics, the Middle East and the neighboring countries, the 
prime minister said a solid breakthrough has been achieved. 
  Elaborating the economic achievements, she said foreign 
exchange reserves have improved from a precarious level of $300 
million to $1.9 billion showing an unprecedented six-time 
increase. The prime minister said the government will miss no 
opportunity to seek rapprochement with the opposition to obtain 
a consensus on basic national issues like nuclear, Kashmir, 
long-term development projects like Kalabagh Dam and 
constitutional reforms. The prime minister expressed the hope 
that a sense of realization will soon prevail and the government 
will get the desired cooperation from the opposition in the best 
interest of the country. 
  Paying tribute to the armed forces, the prime minister said 
the professional and dedication in Pakistan Army is undoubtedly 
the envy of all and we are proud of our soldiers. She said the 
Army's sacrifices in the Sind Province are well known to all. 
The role played in holding free and fair elections last year 
was commendable.

  [Text] Sukkur (NNI) -- Federal Minister for Defence Aftab 
Shaban Mirani has said that Pakistan does not intend to build 
the nuclear bomb but, at the same, we would never disband our 
muclear programme. 
  Talking informally to newsmen at his residence here on 
Saturday, he strongly refuted speculations that any deal had 
been struck with the US on the issue. 
  He said Pakistan would never accept outside pressure on a 
matter related to our country's national security. 
  He blamed the Opposition's negative role in playing up the 
issue as "childish". 
  He also categorically ruled out reduction in the national 
defence budget and added "We had a traditionally aggressive 
enemy on our borders which had exploded a nuclear device as far 
back as 20 years ago and was only increasing its defence 
budget". "How can we ignore this build up?, he asked. [no end 
quotes as published] 
  He said that Pakistan would continue to strive for declaring 
our region as a nuclear-free zone.

Maine), who visited (Pando) Post along the Line of Control [LOC] 
in Azad Kashmir, was briefed on the situation in occupied 
Kashmir and the increasing violations of the LOC by Indian 
forces. He was accompanied by General Shamim Alam Khan, 
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee. The Danish 
general was also apprised of the large-scale violation of human 
rights at the hands of the Indian forces in occupied Kashmir. 
He was told that infamous laws have been enforced in occupied 
Kashmir, under which the Kashmiris have been deprived of their 
basic rights. The Indian judiciary is not allowed to hear any 
case relating to any crime committed by the Indian forces 
against the Kashmiris. The Danish general was also informed 
that India has deployed a large number of troops along the LOC 
to prevent the helpless refugees from coming into Pakistan from 
India. He was also told about the unprovoked violation of the 
cease-fire, as a result of which civilians living along the LOC 
are being killed. The Danish general also attended a briefing 
at the field station of the UN observers in Muzaffarabad.

Kashmir Conference at its meeting in Muzaffarabad today reviewed 
the latest political situation prevailing in the occupied Jammu 
and Kashmir. The council strongly rebutted Indian claims that 
the leadership of the conference was engaged in secret 
negotiations with the Indian authorities. The council said this 
is a technique used to mislead the Kashmiri people, which are 
engaged in relentless struggle against repressive measures of 
Indian forces in occupied territory. The council said that the 
Kashmiri people will not be affected through such unfounded and 
fabricated media tricks aimed at spreading disinformation. The 
executive council of All Parties Hurriyat Conference called upon 
the Kashmiri people to step up their struggle against Indian 
subjugation till their rights are achieved.

  [Text] In a statement to the newspaper AL-SAFIR published 
today, Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz asks what Israel wants the 
Lebanese delegation to negotiate in the peace talks. He said: 
Lebanon's stance is clear; it demands implementation of 
Security Council Resolution 425 providing for Israeli withdrawal 
to the internationally recognized borders to enable the 
legitimate Lebanese Government to extend its sovereignty 
throughout Lebanon. He added: Lebanon will then obligate itself 
and pledge to exercise its responsibility as a government and 
undertake to keep law and order in the area from which Israel 
will withdraw. Buwayz said: We tell the Israelis that this 
resolution is independent of the Middle East dispute. He added: 
Let them acknowledge this principle and then we will be ready 
to form a joint military committee to prepare an agenda and take 
the necessary steps to implement security measures. Then, and in 
solidarity with the other Arab countries, Lebanon will make 
progress in the peace talks and may then recognize a state of 
comprehensive and final peace. 
  Buwayz said: We offered to make progress in two stages: The 
first is a purely Lebanese stage through implementation of 
Resolution 425 and the second concerns progress on the regional 
level. He asked: What did Israel do? He said that Israel 
linked the Lebanese file with all the regional files, 
particularly the Syrian one. He noted that Israel is demanding 
that the Lebanese Government control the resistance as a 
precondition although it knows that this is impossible. Israel 
also knows that the resistance is a result, not a cause, of the 
occupation. The result cannot be eliminated before the cause is 
first removed. He said: Israel knows full well that this or any 
other Lebanese Government cannot give up the principle of 
resistance as long as it has no sure and definite guarantees to 
regain its territory. Thus, he said, Israel is setting out an 
impossible precondition whereas we pledge to establish peace and 
stability when Israel withdraws from the south. Moreover, 
Israel links its withdrawal with the signing of a comprehensive 
peace agreement. Israel knows that a comprehensive agreement 
requires the restoration of all Arab rights. 
  Buwayz pointed out that Israel links the south Lebanon 
problem with the regional problem. This is not the first time 
Israel has done this. He said that Israel maintained the same 
attitude after the 17 May Agreement. After one and a half years 
of peace negotiations and after ending the negotiations, Israel 
links the result of all negotiations with Syrian approval and 
commitment to security in south Lebanon and even with the 
political part of the agreement. He said that Israel accuses us 
of linking our file with that of Syria. He said: It is Israel 
that links our file with Syria's. Israel accuses us of linking 
our file with the regional file although it is the party that 
does this. 
  Buwayz noted that Israel maintains that it cannot make 
progress on one track while it has made no progress on the 
Palestinian track. Israel is deliberately prevaricating to foil 
this round in the hope of reaching particular agreements with 
the Palestinians. 
  Discussing the multilateral negotiations and Lebanon's 
refusal to take part, Buwayz said: Lebanon maintains this 
stance because we are still determined and more convinced than 
ever that joining the multilateral talks is premature. We 
cannot join these talks before the bilateral talks make firm, 
tangible, and substantial progress. We insist on our position 
that participation in the multilateral talks is wrong. Lebanon 
was the first country to warn against joining the multilateral 
talks. He revealed that there is a regional-international plan 
to solve the problem of Palestinian refugees in the diaspora, a 
solution that provides for settling these refugees living in 
Syria, Egypt, and Jordan, where they are now, and for 
distributing the Palestinian refugees living in Lebanon.

  [Excerpt] Lebanese villages just north of the occupied 
border strip came under further Israeli attacks today. The 
eastern hills of Kafr Rumman were shelled from the position of 
the occupation forces in al-Dabshah at 1500 today. Majdal Silm 
and Wadi al-Saluqi came under shell fire at noon today. Israeli 
planes overflew the central sector, al-Nabatiyah, and Iqlim 
al-Tuffah. 
  Security reports tell about a massacre in 'Aramta last 
night. 
The details are as follows: About 20 Lahd [South Lebanese Army] 
militiamen entered 'Aramta, firing wildly in all directions. 
The militiamen then broke into houses and wantonly shot several 
citizens, killing four and wounding several others, including 
Jihad Hikmat Jarjah and Fu'ad Jandal Yunus. Two bodies are yet 
to be identified. 
  The Lahd militia then took the town's entire population of 
70--many had already deserted the town--to Jazzin, where they 
were made to sleep outdoors. Today, the occupation forces and 
their agents took the 'Aramta inhabitants from Jazzin to Marj 
'Uyun to question them about resistance fighters. The women 
were then released, but the men are still in custody. [passage

  [Text] Israeli warplanes staged several sorties over the 
south this morning, specifically over the al-Nabatiyah and the 
Iqlim al-Tuffah areas. They staged two mock raids at low 
altitude and broke the sound barrier. 
  The eastern hills and the outskirts of Kafr Rumman came 
under 
heavy machine-gun fire at 0800 today from the Israeli forces' 
positions in al-Dabshah. 
  In the central sector, the outskirts of the town of Yatar 
came under intensive machine-gun fire at midnight last night 
while the sky overhead was lit by flares. 
  In the Marj 'Uyun area, an agent Lahd [South Lebanese Army] 
unit combed with machine-gun fire the main road that links Marj 
'Uyun with the Zumarayya crossing point and that passes through 
the al-Khiyan junction and the Nab' al-Hasbani. 
  According to information received from the occupied strip, 
the SLA command interrogated a number of its members following 
the explosion of a device under one of its patrols at the 
entrance to Marj 'Uyun three days ago. The explosion killed 
recruit Faris Ilyas Jabbur from Kawkaba and injured another.

  [Text] Cairo, 17 Apr (MENA)--Ambassador Badr Hamman, 
assistant foreign minister for Arab affairs, left Cairo for 
Sanaa as President Mubarak's special envoy this afternoon. He 
will deliver two messages to Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih and Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, secretary general of 
the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP]. 
  Ambassador Hammam said before leaving that the two messages 
deal with Egyptian-Yemeni relations and the Egyptian view of the 
Yemeni situation and stress the need for cooperation among all 
the Yemeni parties to surmount the situation in the country. 
  Hammam pointed out that his mission in Yemen falls within 
the 
context of the continuing Egyptian role of helping brother 
Yemenis overcome the situation the country has been encountering 
since last August. This role also seeks to preserve Yemeni 
unity and implement the pledge and accord document approved and 
signed by all the political parties in the Jordanian capital, 
Amman, on 20 February, he explained. 
  The Egyptian official added: We are confident that the 
political leaders in Yemen know of their responsibility to 
foster and maintain unity. We will cooperate together to 
achieve the collective goal of all the Yemeni parties, he said, 
adding: We will try to provide favorable conditions and common 
ground for bringing the parties together to overcome the crisis.

  [Text] Cairo, 16 Apr (INA) -- Kim Yong-sop, ambassador of 
North Korea in Cairo, has held the United States responsible for 
the continuation of the unjust embargo imposed on Iraq and its 
consequent human and material losses. 
  In an exclusive statement to INA's correspondent in Cairo, 
the Korean ambassador said U.S. determination and deliberate 
attempts to harm Iraq, and its use of the Security Council to 
apply illegal resolutions against it, violate international law 
and seriously jeopardize world peace and security. 
  He said U.S.-Western attempts to commit aggression against 
Iraq, besiege it, and interfere in its domestic affairs are all 
part of a old, and now new, colonialist scheme, led by the 
United States, to intimidate Third World nations, particularly 
countries that adhere to independent decision making and reject 
U.S. hegemony. 
  The North Korean ambassador said U.S. claims about the 
implementation of international resolutions, whether by Iraq or 
Korea, have fallen on deaf ears and have no legitimate 
foundation or relation to international law. He said these 
resolutions are void and are in line with U.S. interests in the 
world. 
  He said the Security Council has lost its true role in 
maintaining law and protecting nations and is now being used in 
an ugly manner to achieve U.S.-Western strategy whose features 
are today clearer than any time before. 
  The ambassador said his country firmly rejects the false 
propaganda campaign led by the United States against it under 
the pretext of Korea's rejection of the White House wishes and 
orders.

  [Text] Cairo, 17 Apr (MENA) -- Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa 
today received a report from Assistant Foreign Minister 
Ambassador Sa'id Rif'at on the mission he undertook in Liberia 
as President Husni Mubarak's envoy. 
  Ambassador Rif'at stated that President Mubarak entrusted 
him 
with a message to the Liberian State Council, reflecting his 
interest in the situation in Liberia after the various parties 
signed a peace agreement. The mission was within the context of 
Egyptian efforts to settle the Liberian problem and its backing 
for the State Council, the transitional government, and 
constitutional measures. 
  Ambassador Rif'at added that during his visit to Liberia he 
met the State Council members and discussed developments in the 
Liberian problem and ways to settle it, with particular emphasis 
on disarming the factions and completing the formation of the 
transitional government. 
  He pointed out that the Liberian parties reiterated their 
eagerness to find a settlement and form a government. The 
Liberian powers expressed their appreciation of the Egyptian 
role and reiterated their desire to see Egypt contributing to 
the country's reconstruction once the peace agreement is 
implemented, he said. 
  Rif'at added that he assured Liberian officials of Egypt's 
preparedness to offer its expertise in development and to extend 
training assistance to Liberians in medicine, engineering, and 
nursing.

  [Excerpts] Pope Shanudah, head of the Egyptian national 
church, has issued a call through AL-'ARABI to the grand imam, 
the shaykh of al-Azhar, to discuss with him practical ways to 
liberate Jerusalem. The grand imam welcomed cooperation with 
the brother Copts and the pope, and his eminence the mufti was 
enthusiastic about the idea and expressed his readiness to 
participate. 
  What is the starting point? AL-'ARABI has interviewed 
political figures and representatives from different national 
groups in order to form a common view on a starting point for 
this or any practical proposals to consider. [passage omitted] 
  Counselor Ma'mun al-Hudaybi, official spokesman of the 
Muslim 
Brotherhood, expressed support for Pope Shanudah's call and 
al-Azhar's favorable response to this call. He said that the 
agreement of the shaykh of al-Azhar and the pope on this issue 
is a good thing and reason for satisfaction. He called upon 
them to pursue this issue and continue to pressure the Egyptian 
Government and the Arab governments not to ignore the Jerusalem 
issue. One practical measure would be continuous public 
pressure on the government in order not to overlook this issue. 
While the status of Jerusalem is a matter for governments to 
deal with, this does not mean that the people should not get 
involved. Our role can be divided into two parts: The first is 
to collect donations to maintain the Islamic holy places in that 
city. The donations should go to a publicly trustworthy body. 
As for regaining Jerusalem itself, the major part of this task 
is the responsibility of the Arab and Islamic governments. We, 
as peoples, must exert maximum pressure through processions, 
seminars, conferences, and any other means to restore this city, 
which is dear to us all. 
  Al-Hudaybi stressed that the Muslim Brotherhood welcomes 
this 
call and is prepared to attend any al-Azhar-sponsored conference 
in which the national church and political forces will join in 
discussing practical ways to regain Jerusalem. He added that 
the real significance of the pope's call and al-Azhar's 
favorable response lies in the fact that it confirms beyond any 
doubt the absence of so-called sectarian strife in Egypt, and 
that the violence taking place now is not directed against the 
Copts alone; its victims are both Muslims and Copts. [passage

  [Text] Cairo, 16 Apr (MENA)--Ending a 20-year rift, the 
Coptic Orthodox Church and the Ethiopian Orthodox Church have 
agreed to normalize relations, according to a source at the 
papal seat of the Coptic Church. 
  The Coptic synod, led by Pope Shanudah III, approved a 
protocol regulating relations between the two churches. The 
protocol was prepared by a joint committee and discussed by both 
sides. The protocol will open a new chapter in relations 
between the two churches, stressing their amity, proximity, and 
common traditions of faith, according to the same source.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Land of Fire and Hatred"] </F>
  [Text] It was a noticeable scene last week to see dozens of 
Palestinian youngsters pelting the Israeli trucks withdrawing 
from Gaza and Jericho with stones. The trucks were carrying 
Israeli police equipment to pave the way for the entry of the 
Palestinian police force. The Palestinians were supposed to 
celebrate the withdrawal of Israel troops from their country, 
which has been living under occupation for almost 30 years. 
  However, it seems that the bitterness is deep rooted, and 
why 
not? Throughout the years of the intifadah, the Israeli 
occupation troops killed, wounded, and jailed Palestinians daily 
without mercy. The deep-rooted bitterness felt by the 
Palestinians became manifest a few days ago when a Palestinian 
youngster committed a suicide operation in northern Israel 
against a passenger bus, killing 8 Israelis and wounding 50 
others. What is so strange about this after dozens of 
Palestinians were killed and hundreds others wounded at the 
al-Ibrahimi Mosque 40 days ago in a treacherous attack during 
the dawn prayers in the month of Ramadan? 
  These conditions, which are bad by any standard, are to 
blame 
for the violence that claims the lives of innocent people. 
These conditions make it incumbent on the Israeli and 
Palestinian negotiators to do their utmost, and to do it fast, 
toward implementing the Gaza-Jericho Agreement, thus easing the 
hostilities that can be eliminated only through cooperation and 
goodwill. The burden of this largely falls on the shoulders of 
Israel because for long years the Palestinians have been 
subjected to acts of murder, oppression, terrorism, and 
brutality. The sooner Israel recognizes the Palestinian 
legitimate rights, the better the atmosphere will be for peace 
to be created in the land of peace, which for more than half a 
century has been the land of fire. 
  Without greater, faster, and bolder steps toward peace, the 
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, solutions, and agreements will 
be prone to collapse, something that does not augur well not 
only for the two parties but for the entire region.

  [Text] Cairo, 17 Apr (MENA)--Mahmud al-'Arabi, chairman of 
the General Federation of the Chambers of Commerce, has stated 
that the Arab common market can withstand no delay, particularly 
in view of world economic developments and the ongoing 
competition to set up free trade areas and attract investment. 
  In a statement today, al-'Arabi pointed out that inter-Arab 
trade today represents under 12 percent of collective Arab 
foreign trade. He noted that Arab investments in the Arab world 
are limited, although over $850 billion is being invested 
elsewhere. He called for adopting positive measures to attract 
part of the Arab capital being invested in foreign states. 
  Al-'Arabi pointed out that the necessary foundation for a 
common Arab market exists but that it needs a set of measures to 
be perfected. He explained that the required measures are to 
facilitate the movement of goods and flow of trade among Arab 
states, reduce shipping charges, eliminate customs barriers, and 
encourage bilateral agreements as a basis for a common Arab 
market.

  [Text] Asyut, Upper Egypt, 16 Apr (MENA)--The centers and 
villages of Asyut Governorate have been the scene of intensified 
security sweeps to arrest escaped criminals and terrorists. 
  Asyut Security Chief Major General Majdi al-Basyuni has said 
that the sweeps, which started early this morning and covered 
remote and shanty towns, resulted in catching 28 terrorists 
wanted in connection with various cases. 
  Maj. Gen. al-Basyuni added that these terrorists included 
nine in the city of Asyut and surrounding villages and urban 
centers, eight in al-Qusiyah, six in the city of Manfalut, two 
in al-Badari, two in Abu Tij, and two in al-Ghana'im. 
  The sweeps involved the State Security Detectives, Central 
Security, regular troops, the police, and Public Security 
forces. A total of 10 weapons--two automatic rifles, five 
pistols, and three rifles of various types--were seized during 
the sweeps. 
  The teams involved in the sweeps arrested 197 persons on 
suspicion of illegal political activity, who are being 
interrogated, and 141 fugitive convicts. 
  To facilitate full security control of the governorate, 
Asyut 
was recently divided into four security zones. Each zone is 
headed by an assistant security chief.

office has been notified so as to start its investigation.

  [Excerpt] Cairo, 16 Apr (MENA)--MENA has learned that the 
convicts sentenced in connection with the attempt against Prime 
Minister Dr. 'Atif Sidqi submitted appeals to reconsider their 
sentences to the military judiciary a few hours before the 
expiration of the deadline. 
  The military court issued death sentences against nine 
defendants, four of them at large; 15-year sentences at hard 
labor against three defendants; five-year sentences at hard 
labor against one defendant; and a three-year sentence against 
one defendant who is at large. One defendant, who is still at 
large, was acquitted. 
  If the court turns down these appeals, the sentences become 
final. 
  The defendants announced at the 17 March session, during 
which the sentences were issued, that they would not file any 
appeals. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Dr. 'Abd-al-Ra'uf al-Kasm, head of the National 
Security Office, at 1300 today received the UN Middle East 
fact-finding mission that comprises a number of journalists from 
various world countries. 
  Dr. al-Kasm answered journalists' questions concerning 
developments in the peace process and the Arab-Israeli conflict. 
He emphasized the constants of Syrian Arab policy, and its 
position on the just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East. 
  This morning, Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' received the 
mission, which includes ranking Western and Japanese media men. 
The foreign minister answered their questions and said Israel 
intransigence since the beginning of the peace process 
obstructed the realization of substantial progress in the peace 
process. Al- Shar' said the opportunity for peace is getting 
narrower day by day because of Israel's insistence on continuing 
its occupation of the Arab territories, contrary to the UN 
resolutions on which the peace process was based. 
  The foreign minister expressed Syria's determination to 
continue its objectives, which are identical with the 
international community's objectives, to realize a just and 
comprehensive peace in the region, in accordance with the Madrid 
formula. He stressed the importance of the objective role of 
mass media in the international arena in distinguishing between 
those who want real, just, and comprehensive peace, and those 
who block this peace.

<F P=106> [Report by Sana' al-Imam from Damascus] </F>
  [Text] Syrian Information Minister Muhammad Salman has 
said Syria is worried about an anti-Clinton campaign steered by 
Israel and the Zionist lobby in the United States to pressure 
the U.S. president into backtracking on understandings he 
reached with President al-Asad in Geneva and preempting 
developments in bilateral ties. 
  In remarks to foreign journalists, the minister emphasized 
that Zionist pressure had neutralized the positive signals sent 
by the Geneva summit. Clinton, according to Salman, has one of 
two choices -- either defend U.S. interests in the region and 
thus put his career on the line, or give in to Zionist pressure 
and thereby forfeit America's credibility. 
  Salman charged that Israel was out to exclude the United 
States from the region by convincing it that its interests are 
best served by Israel. He produced an American document titled 
Syrian-American Cooperation to Combat Drugs in Lebanon, in which 
the United States applauds Syria's anti-drug measures over the 
past few years. Syria, Salman said, was bewildered by the drug 
charges, especially seeing that it has been coordinating with 
the Americans in the fight against these poisons. The pressure 
on Syria, he maintained, is calculated to undermine its 
negotiating position and split the Syrian and Lebanese tracks at 
the talks with Israel. Salman contended that drug abuse and 
trafficking in Syria are virtually nonexistent. He explained 
that drug traffickers in Syria receive the death sentence and 
abusers receive at least three years in prison. In contrast, 
the minister said, drug abuse and trafficking were widespread in 
the West, in particular in the United States. 
  On another subject, the Syrian minister said that even if 
the 
Oslo agreement was implemented to the letter, it would fail to 
bring peace to the region. The terms of the agreement are such 
that the Palestinian people will be in a large jail. The Oslo 
agreement has strengthened opposition Palestinian factions and 
made them more popular inside and outside the occupied 
territories, Salman added. 'Arafat's unilateral agreement with 
Israel has had a negative impact inside the occupied 
territories. There have been a disproportionately high number 
of Palestinian casualties since the Oslo agreement, which he 
said had a clearly negative bearing on the Arab negotiating 
partners. 
  The Syrian minister denied that there are relations between 
Hamas, the Islamic resistance movement, and Syria. He stressed 
that Hamas' activities are restricted to the occupied 
territories and the group is working to liberate occupied 
Palestinian territory.

  [Excerpts] Amman--His Majesty King Husayn said Saturday [16 
April] that Jordan only recognises the Palestine Liberation 
Organisation (PLO) as the sole legitimate representative of the 
Palestinian people and as such will not allow any other 
Palestinian group to operate from Jordanian territory. 
  The King said the government had decided that the Islamic 
Resistance Movement, Hamas, had been operating illegally in 
Jordan before Israeli Prime Minister Yizhaq Rabin discussed the 
issue in remarks he made Thursday. [passage omitted] 
  A senior Jordanian official who asked to remain anonymous 
said the issue had been under discussion in the Cabinet since 
Hamas representative in Amman Muhammad Nazzal claimed his 
group's responsibility for the bus bomb attack in Hadera and had 
already issued instructions to the interior Ministry to limit 
Hamas operations in the Kingdom. 
  "The minister of interior had instructions to call the two 
Hamas representtives and inform them that they were operating 
here illegally before Rabin made his statements to the press 
Thursday evening," the official told the Jordan Times. [passage 
omitted] 
  Palestinian Ambassador to Jordan al-Tayyib 'Abd-al-Rahim 
welcomed the King's reaffirmation that the PLO is the sole 
legitimate representative of the Palestinian people in Jordan 
and elsewhere.

  [Text] In its meeting held today under Senate President 
Ahmad al-Lawzi, the Senate issued a statement expressing support 
for His Majesty King Husayn's statements to the local and 
foreign media. 
  The Senate's statement said his majesty has reiterated the 
constants of the firm Jordanian policy toward the Palestine 
question and the issues and problems resulting from it. 
  The Senate expressed full support for the Jordanian 
position, 
which was expressed by his majesty when he clearly explained 
Jordan's sincere intentions toward a just peace that realizes 
the national ambitions of the Palestinian people on their soil 
and liberates the occupied Arab territories in harmony with 
international legitimacy and human rights. 
  The Senate emphasized that Jordan has always stood against 
terrorism and has paid a dear price with the blood of its sons 
while firmly confronting terrorism. Jordan has always been 
eager to reject violence in politics. This position is 
manifested in Jordan's long history of working for the cause of 
just peace. 
  The Senate also stressed that Jordan strongly rejects any 
charges that it is soft on, or encourages terrorism. It 
considers that these false charges are made to justify the 
aggressive pressure being placed on the country, including the 
unjust siege on the Port of al-'Aqabah, in a bid to force it to 
change its pan-Arab constructive position on just and lasting 
peace.

  [Text] Amman (Petra)--Prime Minister 'Abd-al-Salam 
al-Majali on Sunday [17 April] reaffirmed Jordan's rejection of 
any unilateral solution to the Middle East conflict saying that 
Jordan was seeking just, comprehensive and durable peace 
acceptable by all Arab parties concerned. 
  Speaking during a meeting with representatives of 
publications of political parties, Dr. al-Majali said Jordan had 
been subjected to pressure in a bid to force it to change its 
principled stand towards Arab issues. 
  Dr. al-Majali rejected Israel's attempts to link Jordan with 
terrorism and said there could be a linkage between the threats 
and Israel's attempts to export its internal crises to Jordan. 
  Dr. al-Majali said the siege of al-'Aqabah was part of the 
Gulf war and that Jordan had been suffering for more than three 
years from the blockade. 
  He said the siege had so far cost Jordan more than $1.2 
billion. 
  The prime minister said the government was exerting efforts 
with France, Britain and others to explain the dangers posed by 
the situation. 
  He added that Jordan made intensive contacts with the U.S. 
administration and the United Nations Sanctions Committee to 
stop the interception of ships heading for al-'Aqabah. He 
expressed hope that a solution be reached to this problem soon. 
  Dr. al-Majali said Lloyds Register had made an offer to 
Jordan to help end the search of ships in the high seas. Lloyds 
is a non-political and non-profit international corporation 
whose presence will not have any effect on Jordan's national 
sovereignty," he said. 
  Inter-Arab coordination, Dr. al-Majali said, falls short of 
aspirations. "It is regrettable indeed that current events and 
crises facing the Arab nation have not made them more tolerant 
or more cohesive, particularly at a time when we realise that 
Arab negotiators can achieve more when they are united," the 
prime minister said. 
  On Jordanian-Palestinian relations, Dr. al-Majali said 
Jordan 
maintains unique and special relations with the Palestinian 
people. However, he said, there are several Palestinian factions 
with different political affiliations. 
  Dr. al-Majali said it was natural for Jordan to establish 
relations with the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), the 
Palestinian entity recognised by the Palestinian people, the 
Arab Nation and most world countries. 
  The prime minister voiced Jordan's support for the PLO to 
help it regain full Palestinian rights. 
  "We pray to God that the political organisation enters the 
occupied Palestinian territories and that the Palestinian people 
restore their legitimate rights on their national soil," he 
said. "It is then the kind of relation between Jordan and the 
Palestinians will be determined." 
  On Jerusalem, Dr. al-Majali said while PLO officials had 
agreed to discuss the issue of Jerusalem in the second phase of 
talks, Jordan believed that Jerusalem is the major problem, 
given the current state of inter-Arab division. "There is no 
peace without Jerusalem," Dr. al-Majali said. 
  On recent incidents aimed at destablising security and 
stability in the country, Dr. al-Majali said perpetrators of 
these crimes were trained abroad to use arms.

  [Text] An authoritative Jordanian source has said his 
country does not believe there is any justification for Israel's 
accusations of Amman's alleged support for Hamas' activities on 
its territory. The source explained that the Hamas 
representatives are Jordanian nationals and enjoy freedom of 
speech. Consequently, their statements are within the framework 
of this freedom of speech. The source also explained that Hamas 
operations are planned and carried out by the leadership of this 
movement in the occupied territories and not by its political 
representatives in Jordan. 
  After mentioning that the activities of the Hamas 
representatives are confined to only the political dimension and 
do not violate regulations and laws, the source emphasized that 
compelling them to leave the Kingdom is in violation of the 
Constitution. 
  Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin had said that Israel 
cannot tolerate the Hamas Movement, the declared enemy of the 
peace process, enjoying a safe haven in Jordan.

  A senior Jordanian official said Israel's accusations are

  Hamas claimed responsibility for two suicide attacks which 
killed 14 Israelis inside Israel over the past 10 days. 
  Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin called a news 
conference 
late last night and warned against what he called continued

<F P=106> [By JORDAN TIMES staff reporter Nirmin Murad] </F>
  [Text] Amman--Jordanian officials on Friday [15 April] 
dismissed as "political propaganda" Israeli accusations that 
Jordan was helping the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), 
which has claimed responsibility for two suicide bomb attacks 
that killed 12 Israelis during the last 10 days and threatened 
to launch similar attacks in the future. 
  "According to our information, the attacks carried out by 
Hamas inside Israeli were conceived, planned and executed in the 
occupied territories," a senior government official said. "Thus 
the accusation that Jordan is helping Hamas is unsubstantiated 
hasty and does not contribute positively to the peace process," 
the official told the JORDAN TIMES. 
  Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin on Thursday accused 
Jordan of helping Hamas although he did not say how Jordan was 
extending that help. 
  "Israel cannot tolerate the situation of Amman being a 
paradise for the activities of the Hamas," Mr. Rabin said at a 
hastily called late-night news conference in Tel Aviv. "I see 
the need, I and the foreign minister together, to come and say 
to the Jordan government: This situation is intolerable." 
  Another Jordanian official, who also spoke on condition of 
anonymity, dismissed the Israeli accusations as politically 
motivated. "It is ridiculous to say that Jordan is helping 
Hamas in carrying out these attacks just because a Jordanian 
citizen comes out and says my group did it," the official said 
"what they (the Israelis) are trying to do is to look for 
scapegoats outside the occupied territories to blame them for 
their own frustration." 
  "Instead of doing that" the official continued, "Israel 
needs 
to look closer to home to see that acts of Palestinian violence 
are in direct response to acts of violence by Israelis against 
Palestinians. Violence can only breed violence, as the Israelis 
well know." 
  Jordanian officials generally believed that Muhammad Nazzal, 
the Hamas representative in Amman, who made the statements 
claiming responsibility for the attacks against Israelis in 
'Afula and Khudayrah "is not himself responsible for the attacks 
and was only addressing journalists as a politician, which is 
not against the law." 
  There was no official response from the Cabinet whose 
spokesman said it was still deliberating the accusation and 
preparing a response. 
  But some officials privately expressed concern that such 
statements as those made by Mr. Nazzal in Amman were not 
compatible with the Kingdom's policy on the Middle East peace 
process and could put the country into a difficult position at a 
time when it is calling for linking the lifting of the siege on 
al-'Aqabah with its role in the process. 
  They said that the Hamas statements from Amman played into 
the hands of the Americans and Israel who wanted to pressure the 
Kingdom further after His Majesty King Husayn tied the Kingdom's 
role in the peace process with lifting the siege against 
al-'Aqabah. 
  "It is clear," a prominent Jordanian politician told the 
JORDAN TIMES, "that the U.S. and Israel want to tie the Hamas 
statements with Jordan's conditions on the peace process and the 
al-'Aqabah blockade." 
  "They were unhappy with the King's conditions regarding 
al-'Aqabah and this is how they found a counter issue to 
pressure the Kingdom," the politician said. 
  A senior official, who agreed with the politician, also said 
that Jordan also sees the anger expressed by the Israeli prime 
minister as another indication of attempts to undermine Jordan's 
role in the peace process. 
  Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, who joined Mr. Rabin 
in his press conference Thursday, said he was especially angry 
that Mr. Nazzal had said that the two attacks were among five 
that Hamas would carry out to avenge the Hebron Mosque massacre 
of dozens of Palestinian worshipers. 
  "I don't know one incident in foreign affairs in which a 
state which says it is aspiring to peace would allow in light of 
day the head or representative of a murderous organisation to 
say: `We committed two incidents of murder and we intend to 
carry out three more incidents like this, in the light of day,' 
on the television screen," Mr. Peres said. 
  Jordanian officials also believe that this is another link 
in 
the general antagonism many countries in the Arab region and the 
U.S. feel towards Jordan's democracy and inability of many of 
these countries to believe that Jordan cannot impose limits on 
the political statements of politicians like Mr. Nazzal, or 
force newspapers to take one side over the other. 
  "Since the Gulf war, the U.S. and Gulf states did not 
believe 
us when we said we could not control the media hailing Saddam 
Husayn or criticising Gulf states," a well-placed official said. 
  "Now when we tell them that we legally cannot take any 
action 
against Hamas issuing statements from here, they are also not 
going to believe us," the official added. 
  "Hamas represents an extremist point of view which echoes 
statements made by the extremists on the Israeli side calling 
for the extermination of all Palestinians," one official said 
adding, "I do not see how Israel in a democratic context can 
expect us to muffle the extremist voices on our side while 
letting free the extremist voices on their side." 
  Hamas representatives were not available for comment over 
this controversy, but one of them would only say that his group 
did not want to "make Jordan's position any more difficult than 
it already is." 
  However, prominent Islamist and Islamic Action Front (IAF) 
Deputy Hammam Sa'id said that Hamas in Jordan had better leave 
claims of responsibility to come from inside the occupied 
territories. 
  "All Hamas activities originate from inside the occupied 
territories and there is nothing coming from outside except 
political and media statements...decisions for Hamas are not 
taken from outside of the occupied territories in terms of 
military action," he said. 
  Mr. Sa'id, implicitly criticising Mr. Nazzal, said that "the 
approach should be of a different kind. People inside the 
occupied territories should be left to express themselves by 
themselves as they offer sacrifices and take their own 
decisions."

<F P=106> [By Amjad Mu'alla] </F>
  [Excerpts] Amman--Talal Sat'an al-Hasan, minister of state 
for foreign affairs, has asserted that Jordan will not yield to 
threats and pressures regardless of their form and source. 
Replying to the recent Israeli threats against Jordan, al-Hasan 
said: "We are astonished at the statements made by the Israeli 
prime minister, and assert that Jordan will not yield to threats 
and pressures." 
  In an open dialogue with the Arab Youths Forum held at the 
Amman Chamber of Industry yesterday afternoon, al-Hasan added 
that the Israeli threats were discussed at the highest levels 
over the past two days, and the Council of Ministers also 
discussed them in yesterday's session and followed up all 
statements made by the Israeli side. He said that Jordan is 
proud of its record of fighting all forms and sources of 
terrorism. We in Jordan have been victims of international 
terrorism, he noted. 
  Al-Hasan added: With regard to what was said about Hamas and 
other parties, Jordan's position is clear, which is that Jordan 
recognizes the PLO as the sole legitimate representative of the 
Palestinian people. He said that Israel is responsible for what 
happened in Hebron, and that all that has happened recently in 
terms of escalated violence was a result of the Hebron massacre, 
in which 50 worshipers fell victim and more than 300 others were 
wounded. 
  Asked about Jordan's participation as an observer in the 
meetings of the Water and Refugees Committee which will begin in 
Oman today as part of the multilateral negotiations, as well as 
linking this participation to Jordan's suspension of 
participation in the peace process until the siege of al-'Aqabah 
is lifted, al-Hasan said: Our participation in these 
negotiations came in this way to prove the Jordanian credibility 
about commitment to the peace process. He added that this 
position was taken despite what we said about the siege of 
al-'Aqabah and despite what His Majesty King Husayn said to the 
ambassadors of the five permanent Security Council member states. 
  Al-Hasan asserted that we preferred not to boycott the 
negotiations but to reduce the level of representation in them 
and be content with an observer status in the Water Committee 
until something new develops with regard to the siege of 
al-'Aqabah. 
  Al-Hasan detailed the bases and principles of Jordan's 
foreign policy during this meeting which was organized by the 
Arab Youths Forum and attended by the Foreign Ministry's 
secretary general and several senior Foreign Ministry officials. 
The dialogue was moderated by 'Abdallah Kan'an, member of the 
Board of Trustees of the Arab Youths Forum. The meeting was 
also attended by many Forum members and heads of branches in 
various governorates of the Kingdom. 
  Al-Hasan said that in coordination with Arab states, Jordan 
is interested in and committed to the negotiations [with Israel] 
to arrive at a just, comprehensive solution to the Middle East 
crisis. He said that for the Hashemite leader, finding a 
solution to this crisis is a top priority. This is because, he 
noted, the holy city [Jerusalem] has a special status in the 
hearts of Arabs and Muslims. He stressed that no solution is 
considered fair and comprehensive unless Jerusalem is included. 
  He added that Jerusalem is one of the delayed issues, but 
Jordan has left no occasion without asserting that the city's 
Arab, Islamic identity must be restored. 
  Responding to a question on the Jordanian-Palestinian 
coordination, the minister said that Jordan is interested in 
serious, effective coordination with all concerned Arab parties, 
especially the Palestinians. He said that coordination must 
take place before and after any decision is made. He stressed 
Jordan's rejection of superficial coordination that is intended 
only to convey information. 
  He stressed that Jordan respects and supports the 
independent 
Palestinian decisionmaking by the PLO, in its capacity as the 
sole, legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. 
  Responding to a question on Jordanian-U.S. contacts on the 
question of the Port of al-'Aqbah, al-Hasan said that contacts 
are continuing, but so far there is no U.S. response. [passage 
omitted] 
  He added: Jordan supported Iraq and its people when they 
defended the eastern flank of the Arab nation. Jordan also 
offered Iraq the assistance and facilities which enabled it to 
defend the Arab nation and confront the aggression. Jordan 
still opposes any attempt to undermine the national integrity of 
the Iraqi territory. Jordan urged the international community to 
end the suffering of the Iraqi people resulting from the 
blockade imposed on them. During the Gulf crisis, our 
principled stand was misunderstood. We do not support that the 
territory of any state be occupied by another state. We reject 
the use of force to settle differences. Therefore, after the 
Gulf crisis we sought to clarify the reality of our stand and to 
restore our relations with some Gulf states to their past amity 
and solidarity. Our efforts have been successful. Some Gulf 
states understood our position. Our relations with them have 
returned to normal. However, other states do not seem to be 
willing to open a dialogue, understand matters as they are, or 
to forget the past and revive solidarity. [passage omitted] 
  Responding to a question on the relationship between the 
recent Israeli threats and Jordan's demands that al-'Aqabah 
siege be lifted, the minister said that Jordan rejects the 
continuation of this siege, and that it insists on linking its 
return to the negotiations to having the siege lifted. 
  He stressed that Jordan does not fear the Israeli threats, 
and that its demand that the siege be lifted is a strategic 
demand, not a maneuver or a tactic. 
  The minister stressed that Jordan rejects the inspection of 
al-'Aqbah-bound by foreign forces at the port's jetties. 
  He said that ship inspections must either be a pure 
Jordanian 
responsibility or that of a civilian neutral side.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "False and Rejected Allegations!"] </F>
  [Text] Following the fedayeen operations carried out by 
Palestinian citizens inside the "green line" in 'Afula and 
Hadera in reply to the massacre at the holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque 
in Hebron, the leaders of Israel have begun to utter threats and 
level accusations indiscriminately. The most recent threats 
were uttered by Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Foreign 
Minister Shim'on Peres, who accused Jordan of allowing the free 
movement of Hamas [the Islamic Resistance Movement] on Jordanian 
territory. They also said that the official Hamas spokesman 
claimed responsibility for the 'Afula and Hadera operations! 
  It is true that a media official sympathizing with Hamas has 
boastfully claimed responsibility for these operations. 
However, the real announcement about this responsibility came 
first from loudspeakers in the Abu-Khudayr Mosque and other 
mosques in Gaza. Thus, Israel's allegations that Jordan allows 
freedom of movement for Hamas--only because a media official 
claimed responsibility for the two operations--are false and 
rejected allegations. The threats uttered by the Israeli prime 
minister and foreign minister are only one link in the chain of 
pressure and blackmail pursued by the Israeli leadership 
whenever it feels distressed and encircled. 
  It is known to both us and Israel that Hamas has no 
political 
or military organization, nor do its members or sympathizers 
carry out activities of a military nature, outside occupied 
Palestine. The whole story is that certain sympathizers in the 
Arab countries and other countries express support for, and 
sympathy with, Hamas in the occupied territories. Moreover, 
those who carried out the 'Afula and Hadera operations were 
Palestinians from the occupied territories; they carried out the 
two operations inside Israel despite the cordon and siege 
imposed on the occupied territories. 
  Jordan, which has rejected such threats in the past and 
which 
rejects them today, will not accept this tone by the Israeli 
leadership, and will not yield to any pressure or blackmail from 
any party whatsoever. Jordan also believes that the Israeli 
leadership should realize that its procrastination concerning 
the peace process, its failure to recognize the Palestinian 
people's legitimate rights, and its failure to withdraw from the 
occupied territories are the reason and driving force for all 
acts of violence. This leadership should be aware that a just, 
comprehensive, and lasting peace would guarantee regional 
stability and entrench security. Threats and insistence on both 
occupation and aggression will only yield more bloodshed, 
victims, and violence.

<F P=106> ["Every Day" column by Tariq Masarwah: "Security Bankruptcy </F>
and the Failure of the Peace Game"] 
  [Text] The Rabin-Peres warnings to Jordan declare the 
failure of Israeli policies in the occupied territory. Hamas is 
not in Amman, but in 'Afula, Hadera, Gaza, Hebron, and in every 
part of Palestine. Hamas communiques are faxed, in moments, 
from Jerusalem -- which they call the eternal capital of Israel 
-- to Amman, Damascus, and London. Jordan Television broadcast 
a very brief report, no more than a minute, about the Hadera 
explosion while the Israeli radio carried for one and a half 
hours a report about the explosion and the reactions to this 
explosion. 
  These Israeli threats do not scare us; they are a 
declaration 
of the bankruptcy of the military and security occupation forces 
inside the occupied territory and an unconvincing quest for 
excuses, outside the occupied territory, to justify this 
failure. The occupation is an impasse for Rabin and Peres, not 
for Jordan. Violent resistance against occupation has exposed 
the game of peace, and turned the doves of the Labor Party -- 
who preach about the prosperity that will be achieved in the 
region once the Middle East market is established -- into hawks 
who make threats against others. Violent resistance has also who 
turned carriers of olive branches into pilots of lethal U.S. 
aircraft. They want the game to play in accordance with their 
own rules and, if it deviates from this course, war will be the 
alternative. 
  We say these ridiculous Israeli threats will not scare us. 
We will put them in our political calculations together with 
the U.S. siege on al-'Aqabah. 
  We know that the U.S. Embassy [in Amman] has been working, 
since the 'Afula incident, to mobilize public opinion against 
two youths who carry Hamas faxes to the Jordanian media just as 
Arab journalists in London carry Hamas faxes to AL-SHARQ 
AL-AWSAT, AL- HAYAH, AL-QUDS AL-DUWALI, and AL-AHRAM AL-DUWALI. 
Hamas communiques reach us as they reach every part in the 
world. 
  The Labor Party doves, who turned into hawks, and peace 
advocates who turned into warmongers, have reached a deadlock 
and the game of peace has deviated from its course and has been 
exposed. And Jordan is not responsible for this.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Impotence and Despair Are Behind Israel's </F>
Accusations"] 
  [Text] The accusations the Rabin government has leveled at 
Jordan about alleged activity by Hamas [the Islamic Resistance 
Movement] on Jordanian territory and about Jordanian-Hamas 
relations are baseless. 
  These accusations stem from the Rabin government's failure 
to 
end the intifadah in the occupied territories and from its 
frustration and despair about limiting the fedayeen operations 
carried out by Hamas and other Palestinian organizations. No 
doubt, Rabin himself is fully aware that the Hamas leadership in 
the occupied territories is the party that plans the operations 
and activities against Israeli occupation. 
  The Rabin government also knows that Jordan has no role in, 
or any link to, the activity of Hamas or other organizations in 
the occupied territories. Hamas does not consult Jordan or any 
other party when it, or other Palestinian faction or 
organization, carries out fedayeen operations against Israeli 
occupation in order to avenge the massacre committed by the 
Jewish settlers in cooperation with Israeli occupation troops. 
  Rabin himself certainly knows that Jordan is participating 
in 
the peace process and making a great deal of honest and sincere 
efforts in order to champion a comprehensive and just peace in 
the region at a time when Hamas opposes both the peace process 
and the Oslo agreement signed by Israel and the PLO. 
  Jordan warns against a collapse in the peace process due to 
Israel's intransigence and procrastination. It also warns that 
the region could face a real disaster if the negotiations fail 
on all tracks. On the contrary, Hamas and 10 other Palestinian 
factions reject the Israeli terms on whose basis the Oslo 
agreement was signed. 
  The accusations by Rabin and Peres that Jordan supports 
Hamas 
are either part of the pressure and harassment campaign being 
pursued against Jordan -- including, for example, the siege of 
al-'Aqabah -- or a new link in this campaign designed to force 
Jordan into signing a declaration of principles with Israel 
before, or even without, addressing the water, border, and 
refugee issues. 
  The accusations leveled by Rabin and Peres against Jordan 
and 
their instigation of the U.S. Administration against Jordan are 
a new sign of their government's bankruptcy and failure to take 
a courageous step in order to activate the peace process on the 
four tracks based on UN Resolutions 242, 338, and 425 and on the 
land-for-peace principle. 
  The Jordanian media only reported the 'Afula and Hadera 
operations, carried out by Hamas, just as foreign media did. 
The Jordanian media also cited foreign sources that reported 
the Hamas announcement on its responsibility for these 
operations from loudspeakers in Gaza mosques prior to the 
statement made by a Hamas information official during his 
stopover in Jordan. Israel's fabrications about an alleged 
Jordan-Hamas relationship only seek to conceal Israel's 
impotence and bankruptcy.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Rabin-Peres Campaign Is a Completion of the </F>
Threats and Pressure"] 
  [Text] The campaign launched by the Israeli prime minister 
and foreign minister against Jordan yesterday was part of a 
campaign with multiple purposes. 
  Since the time this country chose a consistent and clear 
policy on dealing with events, campaigns and pressure have been 
directed against it with the aim of ending its sound views and 
judgment and of dragging it into positions and decisions that 
many parties have experienced and which would lead to further 
losses, complications, problems, and damages. 
  Jordan was the first party to call for peace based on 
justice 
and comprehensiveness. At a time when Jordan was aware of the 
requirements of its role in the international community in terms 
of commitment to charters and resolutions, it maintained both 
its consistent pan-Arab position on the Palestine question and 
its demand that the Arab rights be regained as a mandatory 
condition for peace to be established and maintained. 
  Jordan also believed in the importance of peoples' 
participation in decisionmaking and self-determination. Thus, 
Jordan proceeded with its blessed march toward democracy without 
hesitation and despite all circumstances. Moreover, a wider 
participation in decisionmaking is being garnered now, and all 
doors are being opened to a frank and responsible dialogue 
within the framework of the law. Jordan has thus presented the 
Arab model of an institutional state. Israel used to claim that 
it was the only such model, and that there was no regional 
democracy that recognizes the people's right to power sharing 
and free choice. When Rabin and Peres level accusations at 
Jordan and utter threats against it now, the matter becomes 
clear. This is because, at a time when we are facing both a 
siege that has been imposed on us since the Gulf war and 
Israel's intransigence in repressing our kinsfolk in the 
occupied territories, our verbal expressions can only demand 
justice and commitment to international legitimacy, and warn 
against the consequences of dealing with us and with other Arab 
peoples in a manner which exerts further pressure. 
  The talk about peace and its importance for the region's 
future and welfare of its peoples has been ours. When we talked 
about peace in the past, we suffered much in terms of false 
accusations and slander campaigns. But as others' positions 
have circumvented justice as part of the desired peace, we can 
only remain faithful to our positions and principles regardless 
of campaigns and pressure. These positions and principles will 
not be sold out, nor will any Arab right in Jordan, Palestine, 
or elsewhere. This is because we do not accept sellouts in 
response to threats and pressure out of our regard for all 
religions, norms, and laws. Selling out will not establish a 
just peace that will last and be accepted by the people.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Yes, Jordan Acts According to its Own </F>
Conviction, and Does Not Implement Others' Policy"] 
  [Text] There is no longer any doubt that the Rabin 
government is facing a difficult impasse these days. After 
losing both its credibility and international reputation, and 
after appearing as a terrorist state that supports terrorism, 
the Rabin government has become nervous and upset and has begun 
to blame others for its impasse. 
  When the Israeli Army's collusion with the racist settlers 
in 
committing the crime of the age at the holy Ibrahimi Mosque was 
confirmed, the Rabin government chose to move its political 
battle outside Israel. It did so particularly after its 
clear-cut failure to confront the escalating intifadah and 
fedayeen operations, represented by the 'Afula and Hadera 
operations. This escalation embarrassed and confused the Rabin 
government before the Israeli public opinion. It also doubled 
the Israeli opposition's activity against the government and the 
demand to topple it. 
  In order to calm the onslaught of the Likud opposition and 
decrease the indignation of influential settlers, the Rabin 
government leveled false accusations against Jordan, claiming 
that Jordan supports terrorism, and using as a pretext a 
statement made by a Hamas information spokesman, during his 
stopover in Jordan, about the 'Afula and Hadera operations. 
This is despite the fact that the Rabin government is fully 
aware of the true principled Jordanian position. 
  As His Majesty King Husayn said while chairing part of the 
Council of Ministers' session, Jordan does not recognize any 
organization other than the PLO. Jordan also condemns terrorism 
and has offered sacrifices and blood in confronting terrorism 
and terrorists; the blood of Jordan's sons was shed in Arab and 
foreign capitals at the hands of terrorists. 
  Since the very beginning, Jordan has believed that terrorism 
does not make a just and comprehensive peace; on the contrary, 
terrorism, as King Husayn said, kills peace and foils peace 
initiatives. Now that the Palestinian people--who are 
frustrated and on the verge of despair over the possibility of 
achieving a just and comprehensive peace and regaining their 
national rights--have determined to continue their struggle and 
escalate their fedayeen operations and intifadah until the 
occupation is removed. The Rabin government itself is the party 
responsible for creating this frustration and despair among 
Palestinian circles, political forces, and organizations. 
  Therefore, our kinsfolk in the occupied territories, as King 
Husayn said, are determined to continue struggle and resistance 
until occupation is removed. Also as King Husayn said, 
Jordan--which condemns and fights terrorism because it conflicts 
with the principles of our true religion, Islam, and with our 
Arab values and ideals--acts according to its own conviction, 
and will not accept to implement the convictions of others or 
receive instructions from any party whatsoever. This is because 
Israel is primarily responsible for the Palestinians' 
frustration and despair and for the escalation in the acts of 
violence and counterviolence.

  [Text] In today's open session of the Majles, Mr. Rohani, 
the deputy speaker of the Islamic Consultative Majles described 
the onslaught of the Serbs against Gorazde as yet more evidence 
of the lies and deceit of international circles and the United 
Nations. He condemned the silence and time-wasting of the 
Security Council in response to the Serbs' aggression and said: 
Of all the resolutions passed by this council, only the 
resolution imposing an arms embargo on the Muslims of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina is being implemented. This in itself 
encourages the Serbs to further carry on with their aggression 
and blood shedding. 
  On the downing of two U.S. helicopters by the fighters of 
the 
same country in northern Iraq, he said that this would lead to 
instability and insecurity for all the countries of the region 
and added that the downing was a result of America's domineering 
policies.

<F P=106> [Commentary by News Research and Commentaries Group] </F>
  [Text] The bloody and calamitous game in the disarmed and 
so-called safe haven of Gorazde has entered a new phase and UN 
officials and the Serb criminals are trying to reap fresh fruit 
from the joint and coordinated game they have been carrying on. 
  While the calamitous deaths and the nightmare of the 
massacre 
of civilians have cast their shadow over the residents of the 
oppressed city of Gorazde, UN officials, the Security Council, 
and Western leaders are seeking a political solution for the 
crisis of the city of Gorazde, which is on the verge of falling. 
This is the West's new tactic in response to the world's rage 
and concern and the horrific nightmare the Gorazde residents are 
facing. It is a pattern of behavior on the basis of the new 
rule of acting and interfering after the tragedy. The objective 
behind this new tactic is to officialize the presence of the 
Serbs inside and around Gorazde and to delineate the political 
map of the area on the basis of its current military situation. 
And this will grant the Serbs the legitimacy they need. 
  Basically, the Serbs prefer to have Gorazde, on the basis of 
a political agreement, in the war, not as an aggressor to be 
confronted and with whom the people are enraged. The Muslims 
and the leaders of Bosnia too may have no alternative. This 
comes at a time when the world of Islam is silent and 
indifferent. In this case, the West and the United Nations and 
the Serbs will emerge victorious and respectable from this 
bloody and calamitous game. 
  With this new tactic, the West will achieve its political 
objective, which is the political crushing of the Muslims in 
Europe, in addition to the propaganda success that the Bosnian 
crisis was solved by politics. Once they dominate, occupiers, 
aggressors, and their mentors support political solutions so 
that they can thus legitimize their aggression and what they 
have gained through such solutions and portray confrontation 
with such solutions as illegitimate or doomed. The Westerners 
also hope to calm people with this game. 
  The Serbs too will achieve one of their most important 
military and political objectives and will gain full control of 
east Bosnia. Basically speaking, there could be no better 
condition than this for them to reap the political fruit of 
their savage military and inhuman crimes. 
  But behind this deceitful and bloody game, it is clear that 
even if the United Nations and the Western officials can 
apparently prevent the fall of Gorazde, they can no longer 
prevent the fall of the values of Western culture and of the 
prestige and credibility of the United Nations in the eyes of 
the world. 
  Gorazde today reminds the world of Islam of the tragedy of 
the fall of Andalusia into the hands of the crusaders and of the 
fall of holy Jerusalem into the hands of the Zionists and it 
will thus leave a great mark in the history that is in front of 
Islam and the West.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>
  [Text] Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko arrived 
in Tehran on Sunday at the head of a high-ranking 
political-economic delegation on a three day official visit to 
the Islamic Republic of Iran. Soon after his arrival, Mr. 
Zlenko began the first round of his talks with Iranian Foreign 
Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati. 
  Part of yesterday's talks between the foreign ministers 
focused on regional and international developments and, as he 
had announced before his visit to Tehran, Mr. Zlenko showed he 
is willing to do his best for the expansion and strengthening of 
bilateral ties during his first official visit to Iran. 
  In view of the agreements concluded during the Ukrainian 
president's visit to Tehran and his meeting with Iranian 
President Hashemi-Rafsanjani in April 1992, the Ukrainian 
foreign minister believes the present level of the two 
countries' ties is not compatible with the needs of the day and 
that, along with the two countries' political ties, the level of 
Tehran-Kiev economic exchanges should also be increased to 
higher and desirable levels. 
  Therefore, the composition of the political-economic 
delegation accompanying the Ukrainian foreign minister is so 
designed that, during the three days of talks in Tehran, all 
areas of mutual interest could be included, especially when Mr. 
Zlenko has come to Tehran with certain specific and clear 
proposals for the expansion of bilateral ties. 
  The Ukrainian foreign minister has laid real stress on the 
need for expanding bilateral cooperation in the fields of 
energy, steel, petrochemical industries, oil and oil refining, 
transport, geology and the training of the two countries' 
experts. 
  The Ukrainian foreign minister, in a detailed report on the 
latest developments in his country -- especially Ukraine's views 
vis-a-vis the regional countries -- stressed that regional 
security is actually a wide-ranging process, which can be 
attained only through security for all the regional countries. 
The emphasis the Ukrainian foreign minister places on this 
point means that, aside from expanding ties with Tehran, Ukraine 
is willing to cooperate with Iran on regional and international 
security. 
  On the whole, the trend of Iran-Ukraine ties during the two 
year period that has elapsed since the start of political and 
economic relations between the two countries and the outcome of 
the first round of talks between Dr. Velayati and Mr. Zlenko 
reflect the reality that the two countries, with due knowledge 
of their common interests, are moving ahead in consolidating the 
foundations of bilateral ties. This is not only to the benefit 
of Tehran and Kiev, but will also prove beneficial to the 
Caucasian region countries.

  [Text] The Iraqi skies, which have been and are still 
considered an arena for Western aircraft to engage in maneuvers 
and for flaunting their strength, turned into an sacrificial 
altar for these forces on Thursday and resulted in the deaths of 
26 American, French, British, and Turkish servicemen. The 
incident took place when a squadron of American F-15 planes 
fired at and downed two military helicopters, killing 26 of its 
American, British, French, and Turkish crewmen. 
  This incident is noteworthy because, despite the West's 
ultramodern weaponry systems and technology, the degree of 
confusion among the human element and within the West's military 
establishments is such that the West was unable to prevent an 
incident that many experts have say could have been avoided. 
  It should be noted that most of the Western victims of the 
bloody Persian Gulf war and of the postwar incidents were 
victims of military mistakes committed by the Westerners 
themselves. Even though the West's military experts are trying 
to portray the recent mistake as a technical error and to blame 
the electronic systems in their aircraft, nevertheless the truth 
lies elsewhere--there is a state of psychological confusion 
being experienced by the West's military forces deployed in this 
part of the world. 
  Undoubtedly these forces are more victims of the political 
interests of their leaders than victims of sacred objectives or 
even of national interests. Thus, one cannot believe that the 
recent incident was a unique incident that will not recur. This 
incident speaks of a fundamental characteristic of these forces 
that has just begun to show, and it is not improbable that more 
Western forces deployed in the Persian Gulf will be added to the 
list of victims soon.

  [Text] Tehran, April 18, IRNA -- A morning daily here 
Monday called on the Saudi Government to prepare the necessary 
facilities for the Muslims to enable them to fulfill their 
religious obligations. 
  Referring to the 1991 agreement between Iran and Saudi 
Arabia 
according to which some 115,000 Iranians could go for hajj 
pilgrimage each year, and holding of 'Bara'at' (deliverance from 
pagans) rally was accepted, the `TEHRAN TIMES' said that Riyadh 
has unilaterally canceled the agreement and reduced the number 
to 61,600 for this year. 
  "The Saudi ruling family is governing a country that has a 
special status in the Islamic world," noted the paper adding 
that they should "understand the sentiments and philosophies of 
one billion Muslims who are not Saudi citizens but believed that 
the house of God belongs to all of them." 
  "It is in the Saudi's interest to facilitate Muslim's needs 
and provide them with security and accommodations," the article 
said. Muslims cannot sit idle and watch a government create 
obstacles to prevent them from performing their religious 
obligations, it added. 
  Pointing to the large number of the elderly Iranians who 
were 
in the waiting list to take a trip to Mecca and perform their 
religious duties, the paper said Iran has been "forced" to 
accept a reduced quota for this year's hajj. 
  It concluded by saying that to show good faith, the Saudi 
Government should help Muslims perform their hajj duties, 
including the Bara'at rally.

  [Text] Tehran, April 18, IRNA -- President Akbar 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani opened ceremonies marking the Army Day at 
Tehran's Azadi Square Monday morning. 
  Addressing the participants, the president condemned the 
indifferent attitude that international bodies have adopted 
against crimes in the besieged Muslim town of Gorazde and 
stressed that the world was not seeking to defend the truth. 
  Those international organizations, he added, are seeking 
their own interests as they did in the course of the Iraqi 
invasion of Kuwait in which they intervened. 
  He congratulated the army personnel on the occasion and 
expressed hope that while the army is preserving its combat 
power it will also take part in the reconstruction effort. 
  Various units of the army later paraded before the president 
while the airborne parachute units performed operations and the 
aircraft flew in formation. 
  The army combat and cargo planes as well as helicopters 
performed operations during the ceremonies. 
  Also present at the ceremomies were Chief of Staff of Armed 
Forces Brigadier General Hasan Firuzabadi, Army Chief of Staff 
Major General 'Ali Shahbazi and a number of other senior army 
officials.

  [Text] Tehran, April 18, IRNA -- Despite U.S. attempts to 
sabotage a deal between Iran and its foreign creditors, Iranian 
officials have signed seperate agreements with the creditors for 
rescheduling the payment of about dlrs. 6 billion of the delayed 
debts. 
  Germany, Japan, Italy, Austria and Spain are among the major 
creditors to have agreed to reschedule the payment of Iran's 
debts. 
  Of the total dlrs. 6 billion of the resheduled debts, Iran 
owes dlrs. 2.6 billion to German banks, dlrs. 2 billion to 
Japan, dlrs. 800 million to Italy, dlrs. 458 million to Austria 
and about dlrs. 150 million to Spain. 
  Iran had already singed seperate agreements with Germany, 
Japan and France for rescheduling about dlrs. 4.5 billion of its 
debts to these countries. 
  The success of Iran in rescheduling the payment of its 
foreign debts is, on the one hand, an indicator of the 
importance that the European countries and Japan attach to Iran 
and, on the other, shows that the foreign trade partners are 
quite confident that Iran would have a prosperous economic 
future.

  [Text] Four Israelis were wounded in the Jerusalem attack. 
One sustained serious wounds and three sustained light injuries. 
Our police affairs correspondent Aviv Bushinsky reports that a 
17-year-old Arab from East Jerusalem got on the bus in the Neve 
Ya'aqov neighborhood and attacked passengers with an ax. He was 
shot by an IDF [Israel Defense Forces] soldier, wounded, and 
captured. Our correspondent Ofra Nehmad reports that two of the 
casualties were wounded by shots fired by the soldier. The 
wounded were taken to Hadassah-'En Kerem Hospital. An 
unidentified man called Qol Yisra'el's Arabic Department to 
announce that the terrorist belonged to Hamas [Islamic 
Resistance Movement]. 
  Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said that there is a reasonable 
chance to conclude the negotiations with the PLO within several 
weeks. Rabin told a meeting of the coalition's Knesset factions 
that the evacuation from Gaza and Jericho will be short and will 
last two to three weeks. He stressed that Israel will not agree 
to the PLO continuing in the peace talks and at the same time 
reaching agreements with Hamas on attacks inside Israel. For 
us, that is the red line, the prime minister said. He noted 
that Israel acted in Cairo and in other places to foil such an 
agreement and will judge developments by results on the ground.

  [Text] The cabinet today decided to warn the PLO against 
cooperating with Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement], in the 
wake of reports on possible cooperation between the two 
organizations. This was reported at the close of the weekly 
cabinet session. Our political correspondent Shlomo Raz reports 
that the cabinet approved the issuance of 20,000 work permits 
for Palestinians, mainly in farming. The laborers will be 35 
years old, or above. The cabinet also approved the allocation 
of 30 million shekels for government-initiated projects and 
social welfare payments for the Palestinians in the territories. 
For the time being, the closure will continue indefinitely. 
  Knesset Member Ori Or, chairman of the Knesset Foreign 
Affairs and Defense Committee, said today that the cooperation 
announced by Hamas and Fatah in the territories is not an 
agreement between the leadership of the two organizations. 
These are understandings made by local Gaza activists. The 
understandings were made because some Hamas members are hoping 
for jobs in the autonomy administration, and in view of the 
interest shared by both organizations to prevent bloodshed in 
Gaza. Ori Or further said that there are serious difference 
among Hamas members. Activists in the territories claim that 
they should take part in the PLO administration in order to 
survive when autonomy is established. At the same time, some of 
the organization leaders believe that terror is the only path to 
be pursued. 
  Likud has called on the prime minister to stop negotiations 
with the PLO if it does not immediately stop cooperating with 
Hamas. Likud faction chairman Moshe Qatzav stated it is now 
clear that the working assumption of the Oslo agreement, 
according to which the PLO would fight Hamas, is silly.

  [Excerpts] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin confirmed at 
today's cabinet session that an IDF [Israel Defense Forces] and 
Foreign Ministry team have been doing staff work on the Syrian 
issue. The cabinet today approved the entry of 20,000 
inhabitants of the territories into Israel in spite of the 
closure, which was extended until further notice. 
  As for reports about cooperation between Hamas and Fatah, 
cabinet ministers asserted that this would lead to the annulment 
of the Declaration of Principles with Israel. Our political 
correspondent Udi Segal reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Segal] An IDF and a Foreign Ministry team 
have been working on a peace package with Syria, Yitzhaq Rabin 
confirmed in today's cabinet session. The teams were instructed 
to examine several possibilities, particularly with regard to 
the security issue, but none of these mentions a full withdrawal 
from the Golan Heights. Rabin was angry about the leaks to the 
press of the document formulated by Major General Ilan Biran, 
and said he was opposed to holding a cabinet debate on the peace 
package. A debate here would be tantamount to a public debate, 
he said. The ministers, at least some of them, accepted Rabin's 
position with understanding. [passage omitted] 
  Another issue tackled by the cabinet was the report about an 
agreement -- a kind of distribution of labor -- between the PLO 
and Hamas, whereby the former would allow the latter to go on 
staging terror attacks against Israelis. This report was not 
corroborated by the briefings given by IDF officers and the head 
of the Shin Bet. Nevertheless, Rabin and other cabinet ministers 
asserted that the issue would be looked into and that if the 
existence of such an agreement is confirmed, this would 
invalidate the Oslo agreement. 
  [Education Ministry Official Rubinstein] We did not get any 
confirmation of these reports. However, in order to remove any 
doubt, we are hereby announcing in advance that such a 
development would thwart and sabotage any arrangement with the 
PLO and would actually invalidate the understanding reached with 
it. 
  [Segal] In contrast, Tourism Minister 'Uzi Bar'am believes 
the whole thing is a lie. 
  [Bar'am] The matter will be checked, of course, but it is 
most probably Hamas propaganda. [passage omitted] [end 
recording] 
  Knesset Member Binyamin Netanyahu urged the prime minister 
to 
present to the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee the 
peace package with Syria drafted by the IDF.

<F P=106> [Report by Alan Ben-'Ami] </F>
  [Excerpts] Both Israeli and British officials have begun 
working to have Hamas declared a terrorist organization in 
Britain. According to Israeli sources, the Islamic 
fundamentalist group is using England as a safe haven for 
planning attacks and transferring funds and operational 
instructions to its terrorist squads in the West Bank and Gaza 
Strip. 
  Details of how Hamas operates in Britain -- in some cases 
using Islamic social and charitable organizations as a cover for 
planning operations, raising or laundering funds, then 
transferring money and orders to the territories -- have all 
been passed on to the relevant British security authorities. 
  This is not the first time such information has been passed 
on to Britain. More than a year ago, the British authorities 
were told that their country was a major base for Hamas leaders, 
with direct links to the 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam murder squads 
here. This followed the arrest of two high-ranking Hamas 
operatives, Muhammad Salah and Muhammad Jarrad. [passage 
omitted] 
  Now, according to a well-placed source, in the wake of 
increased Hamas terror activity and especially the bomb attacks 
in 'Afula and Hadera, the British authorities are more likely to 
take action. What is needed, according to the source, is formal 
Israeli diplomatic representations to Britain, along the lines 
of the diplomatic offensive by Israel and the U.S. to get King 
Husayn to crack down on Hamas members and their activities in 
Jordan. For the British authorities to act against Hamas under 
Britain's Prevention of Terrorism Act, Israel will have to show 
that Hamas engages in terrorist activity and that while Hamas 
may not yet be carrying out terror attacks in Britain, 
instructions, money, or logistic support for Hamas terror acts 
elsewhere is being sent from Britain. This is now believed to 
be possible in light of the fact that Hamas has openly and 
officially boasted of its terrorist attacks and that detailed 
information on the links between Hamas members in Britain and 
the territories is now being made available.

<F P=106> [Report by Roni Shaqed] </F>
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Hamas' overt and covert 
operations in Jordan are no secret, certainly not to Israeli 
intelligence. Israel has been familiar with this activity -- 
including that of the military headquarters in Amman -- since 
Hamas' establishment in December 1987. In Jordan, Hamas is 
enjoying the support and aid offered by its patron, the Muslim 
Brotherhood -- which operates openly and legally in this country. 
  We must recall that in the first clause of its covenant, 
Hamas defines itself as "one of the branches of the Muslim 
Brotherhood in Palestine. The Muslim Brotherhood is a worldwide 
movement and the largest Muslim movement in the modern era." 
  Late in 1988 Hamas opened operational branches in several 
Arab states: Iran, Sudan, Lebanon, Yemen, and Jordan. Muhammad 
Nazzal from Qalqilyah, one of the prominent Palestinian members 
in the Muslim Brotherhood -- who moved to Jordan in the early 
1980's -- was appointed Hamas' official representative in Jordan 
late in 1988. He received the special status also accorded to 
the PLO representative in Amman. His official office turned 
into a headquarters for all intents and purposes. 
  The overt activity of the Jordanian office was mainly 
directed at recruiting to Hamas Palestinians living in Jordan, 
as well as funneling funds to the territories. The office did 
not settle for this activity, however, and during 1990 there 
were several infiltration attempts by Hamas terrorists into the 
Jordan Valley. All this activity took place under the direction 
of the Amman office. 
  The Hamas office in Jordan also included a branch of the 
military command, which recruited and operated terror squads, 
especially in the West Bank. Some of 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam's 
most senior terrorists, including the two commanders in Samaria 
-- 'Abd-al-Karim Hanini and Zuhayr Jubran -- were operated by 
the Jordan headquarters. 
  The car bombs which exploded in Mehola and Ramat Ef'al, and 
the plans to activate car bombs in the Hasharon junction, near a 
large Jerusalem department store, and Tel Aviv's Defense 
Ministry complex, were all initiated and planned by the Hamas 
headquarters in Jordan. Jubran was the man who operated the 
squad whose members murdered Nisim Toledano and policemen Dani 
Hazut and Mordekhay Yisra'el. 
  Since late 1988 the Jordan headquarters has been the seat of 
Hamas spokesman Ibrahim Ghawshah, an East Jerusalem engineer who 
moved to Jordan after the Six-Day War. Since then the office 
has turned into Hamas' information, public relations, and 
propaganda center. Over the last year Hamas' leaflets and 
directions to the Palestinian public in the territories have 
been disseminated from his office. Official Hamas statements -- 
including those of a military nature -- also emanate from Jordan. 
  Until the end of 1992 the international Hamas headquarters 
-- 
including the military command -- operated from Washington and 
London. These locations were the source of operational 
directives to 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam's murder squads. Through 
fax machines and telephone calls directives were also conveyed 
to other Hamas apparatus. The Jordan headquarters was only a 
subordinate transit station for relaying directives onward. 
  Following the detention of two senior American Hamas 
activists -- Muhammad Jarrad and Muhammad Salah -- in Israel in 
January 1993, and due to the uncovering of fundamentalist Muslim 
terrorism in the United States, Hamas' main military command was 
transferred from London and Washington to Yemen and Jordan. 
  Muhammad Khazim Sawalihah, Hamas' military commander, at 
present operates from Jordan. He is being aided by several 
Hamas deportees who preferred not to return to the territories. 
Among them is Dr. Musa al-Aqtam, who was a senior lecturer in 
Nabulus' al-Najah University and a senior Hamas commander in the 
territories. Hamas terrorists caught by the Shin Bet during the 
last year divulged in the interrogations that they received 
their orders, funds, and operational directives from the 
Jordanian headquarters. 
  Dr. Musa Abu-Marzuq, head of Hamas international, passes his 
time both in Damascus and Amman. Most of his time is spent on 
furthering the military operations and other covert Hamas 
operations in the territories. 
  The Jordanian headquarters also handles Hamas' financial 
operations. Contributions from all over the Arab world reach 
Jordan, and from there -- via money changers -- to Hamas 
activists in the territories. The funds serve to buy weapons, 
pay rent for hiding places for fugitives, and finance their 
activities. 
  The Jordanian headquarters transfers huge amounts of funds 
to 
all the Hamas-controlled civilian institutions on a monthly 
basis. These institutions, such as education and medical 
institutions, trade unions, and sport clubs, serve as a legal 
cover for Hamas activity in the territories and a pool for 
recruiting activists and terrorists. 
  As will be recalled, Hamas pledged to carry out five attacks 
in retaliation to the Hebron massacre. Two have already been 
carried out. Jerusalem hopes that the uncovering of the links 
between the Jordanian headquarters and the attacks, and pressure 
exerted on King Husayn will hamper the activities of the 
Jordanian headquarters and indirectly contribute toward 
decreasing Hamas terrorism in the territories and in Israel. 
  [Tel Aviv MA'ARIV in Hebrew on 17 April, in a page 1 and 2 
report by Hemi Shalev and Shefi Gabay on Hamas activity in 
Jordan, adds that "Israel has relayed to Jordan intelligence 
information regarding Hamas activity in Amman and inside 
Israel."]

  [Excerpts] The United States has warned Jordan that unless 
Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] stops operating from its 
soil, Jordan will join the list of terror-supporting countries. 
  So far Amman has not formally reacted to the warning issued 
yesterday by Prime Minister Rabin, but Jerusalem is convinced 
that Husayn will take steps against Hamas. Our political 
correspondent 'Imanu'el Rosen has more: 
  [Begin recording] [Rosen] [passage omitted] The news 
conference held by Rabin and Peres close to midnight last night 
was deliberately dramatic. Jerusalem believes that such a 
public onslaught will deal King Husayn a hard blow and force him 
to take action. The decision to act publicly, which Rabin made 
yesterday afternoon, was preceded by a series of secret 
messages. Elyaqim Rubinstein spoke with Jordanian Ambassador in 
Washington Fayiz al-Tarawinah. Senior U.S. elements also spoke 
with Amman. Jordan has not yet reacted officially. Unofficial 
elements said today: There is not much we can do. 
  Rabin says Jordan is running the risk of being placed on the 
U.S. list of terror-supporting countries; the Jordanians must 
choose between good relations with Washington and good relations 
with Hamas. 
  [Rabin] Not only does the Israeli Government take a grave 
view of this, but it will be unable to continue as if nothing 
has happened if this situation continues. 
  [Rosen] A military operation? asked journalists. No 
comment, replied Rabin. It is safe to assume that he was not 
referring to that. [end recording] 
  [Jerusalem Israel Television Channel 1 Network in Hebrew at 
1730 GMT on 15 April carries an announcer-read report adding 
that "Israel refuses to accept the Jordanian reaction conveyed 
by a senior official, rejecting the prime minister's warning 
with regard to Hamas. Israeli political elements said that 
Jordan will be given some more time so that it can be determined 
whether the Jordanians are genuinely curbing the freedom of 
movement of the Hamas office in Amman."]

  [Text] The prime minister has launched a series of 
consultations with senior IDF [Israel Defense Forces] elements, 
including the chief of staff and the Intelligence Branch chief, 
as to Israel's consent to withdraw on the Golan Heights. 
Intelligence Branch Chief Uri Sagi has made two trips to 
Washington recently, and one of his visits has been kept secret 
until now. 
  The meetings are part of the drafting of a working paper 
entitled The Israel-Syria Peace Package, and it outlines the 
Israeli stands on an agreement with Syria. 
  Our political correspondent 'Imanu'el Rosen reports that the 
proposal will be submitted to U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher, who is slated to arrive in the region in about 10 
days. 
  Likud elements asserted that by proposing to withdraw from 
the Golan while al-Asad-inspired katyushas are being launched at 
the Galilee, Rabin is behaving with obduracy.

  [Text] Cairo, 16 Apr (MENA)--Israeli Prime Minister 
Yitzhaq Rabin has praised the efforts that President Husni 
Mubarak and the Egyptian Government are exerting calmly and away 
from the media spotlight to help the PLO and Israel reach 
agreement over establishing peace in the region. 
  In an interview with the newspaper AL-AHRAM to be published 
in its 17 April issue, Rabin said that in a telephone 
conversation following the Israeli bus blast, he and Palestinian 
Chairman Yasir 'Arafat agreed on the need to continue the peace 
process, because it is the best response to the enemies of peace 
by the Israeli and the Palestinian sides. 
  The Israeli prime minister affirmed that the objective of 
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's visit to the region 
at the end of this month is to boost the multilateral talks and 
to attend the signing of the agreement on implementing the 
Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles, if they reach 
agreement. 
  Rabin clarified that the peace efforts with the Palestinians 
must proceed simultaneously along two parallel roads, 
concentrating on the negotiations to reach agreement on 
implementing the Gaza-Jericho First agreement and to confirm 
that violence and terrorism will not hamper the negotiating 
process or attempts to reach agreement to implement the 
Declaration of Principles. 
  Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said in his interview 
with AL-AHRAM that agreement was reached between the Palestinian 
and the Israeli sides in a meeting in Cairo recently that 
anything that is agreed upon during the talks will be written 
down and initialed. 
  He pointed out that what Israel is trying to do with the 
Palestinians is to find a formula for peaceful coexistence 
without any clear or dividing lines, because there are no 
dividing lines in reality. In this context, he mentioned the 
corridor linking Gaza and Jericho. 
  Rabin said he would head for Moscow on April 24 to meet 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin. This visit will be preceded by 
another visit by Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat to Moscow. 
But Rabin ruled out the possibility of a meeting between him 
and 'Arafat then. 
  Rabin said that Israel tried to start secret talks with 
Syria 
but that Damascus refused to cooperate, despite the fact that 
none of the agreements between the Arabs and Israel since 1977 
could have taken place had they not been preceded by secret 
talks. 
  Answering a question on relations between Israel and the 
Arab 
countries, Rabin said that peace between Egypt and Israel broke 
the hostility between Israel and the Arab countries. He stated: 
Undoubtedly, Egypt is the biggest and most important Arab 
country. Peace with Egypt has proven that peace can be 
established and preserved. 
  On the siege imposed on Gaza and the West Bank towns, the 
Israeli prime minister denied that there are any instructions 
banning the entry of food and medicine to the Gaza Strip. He 
said he agreed to exclude doctors, nurses, and Palestinian 
employees of international organizations from the ban on 
entering and leaving the occupied territories.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin by Karmit Gay, </F>
Sheli Yehimovich, and Shlomo Raz on 13 April; place not given -- 
recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Yehimovich] The Jewish 
settlers were once favored by the government, even when your 
party was in power before. Now they have been somehow pushed 
into a corner. Naturally, they are not all made of one skin. 
They are not all Barukh Goldstein. Many of them have a 
different world view. Do you intend at any stage to resume a 
dialogue with them, to hold a closer and more frequent dialogue 
with them? 
  [Rabin] In a democratic state, it is legitimate to support 
or oppose the government policies. Staging legal demonstrations 
is legitimate. It is not legitimate to make threats or issue 
warnings about use of force. It is certainly not legitimate to 
issue halakic decrees urging soldiers to disobey orders. To me, 
this is most grave. It is inconceivable to call on soldiers of 
the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] -- which, as the military, is 
subject to the democratically and legally elected government 
which issues legitimate orders -- to disobey an order. Had we 
accepted the principle that anyone may decide for himself what 
is right and what is not -- whether he is a rabbi or a public 
figure -- hundreds and thousands of soldiers would have refused 
to serve in Lebanon and hundreds, if not thousands, would have 
refused to serve in the territories. 
  I believe the Jewish nation has a right to settle in Eretz 
Yisra'el, but according to a concept. When I was prime minister 
between 1974 and 1977, I prevented the establishment of a Jewish 
quarter in Hebron. I believed it to be a mistake. This is what 
Qiryat Arba' is for. I opposed setting up Jewish settlements in 
areas densely populated by Palestinians. I agreed to the 
establishment of settlements in the 'Etzyon Bloc, in Qiryat 
Arba', in the Jordan Rift Valley, and on the outskirts of 
Netanya, such as Alfe Menashe and Elqana. I never wanted 
settlement in the heart of the Palestinian population in Judaea 
and Samaria, between Ramallah and Nabulus. 
  Jewish history mentions Nabulus but, for example, Ashqelon, 
Qiryat Gat, and Ashdod are situated on historical Philistine 
land. Today, they are rightfully part of the State of Israel. I 
do not suggest that we view the Bible as the book of maps of the 
Jewish state. To me, the Bible is the book of religion, real 
values, real codes, tradition, and the history of the Jewish 
nation. This is how I studied it, and not as the book of the 
precise maps of the Jewish state. [passage omitted] 
  [Raz] Does the way the settlements are spread out not make 
it very difficult for the current government to make decisions 
regarding the future of the West Bank? 
  [Rabin] This is the reason we chose the path we did. The 
path started at Camp David, with the idea of autonomy for the 
Palestinians, and continued in the negotiations at the Madrid 
conference, where the word autonomy was erased, not by us, but 
by the Arab side at the very beginning of the negotiations that 
led to the convention of the Madrid Conference. The word 
autonomy does not feature in any of the papers that accompanied 
the letter of invitation to the Madrid Conference. The word 
autonomy does not appear in any paper presented by Israeli 
Governments -- and I stress governments in the plural -- during 
the negotiating process. It was replaced by Self-Government 
Arrangements for the Palestinians. This is what we are dealing 
with. 
  I believe our approach is correct. I know there is a serious 
problem. We must change the reality on the ground before we 
approach the issue of the permanent solution. I believe that 
the reality of settlements located in areas densely populated by 
the Palestinians -- and I am not referring to Greater Jerusalem, 
the 'Etzyon Bloc, or the Jordan Rift Valley -- the reality in 
which settlements are spread out among such a dense population 
does place a burden on the IDF [Israel Defense Forces], which 
must provide them with security. If I take the size of the 
force currently situated in Hebron.... [pauses] This is no 
simple matter. Nonetheless, it is our duty to defend all the 
Jewish settlements. This is also in accordance with the 
Declaration of Principles for the interim period. We have 
reached an agreement with the PLO that the Jewish settlements 
will remain in place, and we.... 
  [Gay, interrupting] But there is a settlement in the heart 
of Hebron which you personally said is a mistake.... 
  [Rabin, interrupting] I opposed it, but now it exists. I 
have said this before, and I am willing to repeat: Given a 
militarily strong Israel, I would not want to remove a 
settlement for security reasons, but I am willing to remove 
settlements for peace. There is a precedent. In order to 
achieve peace with Egypt, we not only returned everything we had 
conquered from Egypt in the Six-Day War, down to the very last 
inch of sovereign Egyptian soil, but we also uprooted every sign 
of Israeli presence in the Sinai: the entire area of the Rafah 
enclave, Yamit, Ofira, and so on. The precedent of the price of 
peace was determined, to a large extent, when we made peace with 
Egypt. We hope to change it. Again, given our military might 
and even if the price is a painful one, I say yes to evacuating 
settlements for peace and no to evacuating for security reasons.

  [Text] The United States is pressuring Israel and the PLO 
to sign a Gaza-Jericho withdrawal agreement this month so that 
the signing ceremony can take place during the secretary of 
state's visit to the region in late April. 
  Our political correspondent Gadi Sukenik reports that 
Shim'on 
Peres and Yasir 'Arafat will meet several times at a conference 
in Bucharest on Thursday and Friday so as to speed up the 
negotiations. Peres will probably also meet Jordanian Prime 
Minister al-Majali there, and there are currently contacts to 
work that out. 
  The United States is demanding that Israel and Syria prepare 
a package of their demands on security, peace, and a Golan 
withdrawal prior to Secretary Christopher's visit. Due to that, 
deliberations are taking place in Rabin's and Peres' bureaus on 
various position papers. It is unclear whether the Syrians are 
working on their own proposals.

  [Text] Cairo, 15 Apr (MENA)--Israeli Foreign Minister 
Shim'on Peres has stated that withdrawal from the Gaza Strip can 
be completed within three or four days after the final agreement 
with the Palestinians is signed. 
  In a statement to AL-AHRAM to be published tomorrow, Peres 
said that Israel has actually completed the withdrawal of the 
major part of its equipment and men from the Strip, and only the 
necessary forces to guard the Israeli camps there have remained. 
  The Israeli foreign minister added that he will meet with 
Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat next Friday [22 April] in 
Bucharest, noting that if tangible progress is made during this 
meeting, he will leave with 'Arafat immediately for Cairo. 
  Peres said that Israel is prepared to respond to President 
Husni Mubarak's call from Cairo following his meeting with 
Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad for reciprocal concessions by 
Israel and Syria. The Israeli foreign minister said that Israel 
is ready to return the Golan to Syria, but this will depend on 
the nature of peace, which Damascus wants. He noted that Syria 
still refuses to hold direct, secret talks with Israel. 
  Peres denied reports about Israel's intention to dominate 
the 
Middle East economically. He said that Egypt received Israeli 
assistance in the agricultural field, and within a few years it 
was able to compete with Israel in exporting its agricultural 
produce to the countries to which Israel used to export its own 
agricultural produce. 
  Regarding Israeli pressure on the Palestinians to make 
concessions, Peres said that Israel is the one that is making 
concessions and not the Palestinians. He said that all those 
who carried out stabbings against Israelis came from Gaza. 
  The Israeli foreign minister said that agreement has 
actually 
been reached regarding the Palestinian force that will operate 
in Gaza, and that the date for the deployment of the first group 
will be decided by the Palestinian authority. This may take 
place at any time after the signing of the agreement. The 
remainder of the force can enter after the signing of the final 
agreement, which might be ready by the end of this month. 
  Peres said that it was also agreed with the Palestinians 
that 
'Arafat and senior officials of his administration can use 
helicopters to move between Gaza and Jericho. Agreement is also 
being worked out on a number of matters such as identity cards 
for the Palestinian citizens, postage stamps, and so forth.

<F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Aluf Ben] </F>
  [Excerpts] On 15 April, Yitzhaq Rabin, prime minister and 
defense minister, received a draft offer for a "peace package" 
with Syria, to be given to U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher in order that he relay it to Syrian President Hafiz 
al-Asad. 
  Staff work on the formulation of the "peace package" with 
Syria was conducted by Major General Ilan Biran on behalf of 
Rabin. Biran, who over the past several months had no IDF 
[Israel Defense Forces] assignment, will assume duty as 
commander of Central Command today. Professor Itamar 
Rabinovich, Israel's ambassador to the United States and head of 
Israel's delegation for negotiations with Syria, also 
participated in drafting the document. Parallel with the work 
on the "peace package" for the Syrians, the IDF has begun 
preparing a list of security demands Israel will present to the 
United States to compensate for the peace risks. 
  The "peace package" with Syria presents the principles of 
the 
offered arrangement, and does not detail the depth of withdrawal 
and the time needed for its implementation. Israel will suggest 
to Syria that the details be worked out in direct discussions on 
the expert level. 
  The "peace package" with Syria is made of four basic 
elements: withdrawal from the Golan, peace relations, security 
arrangements, and a timetable for the implementation of the 
withdrawal and the normalization. Among other things, the 
Israeli offer to the Syrians will include the following points: 
  -- A commitment in principle to withdraw. The offer does not 
  contain a pledge to fully withdraw from the Golan Heights. 
  -- Full peace relations, including embassies, open 
borders, and 
  economic ties. 
  -- A gradual implementation of the withdrawal over years. 
  -- Establishing normalization and relations between Israel 
and 
  Syria right after the first stage of withdrawal, while the 
IDF 
  still holds a significant part of the Golan Heights. 
  -- A future discussion of water resources on the Golan. 
  -- Security arrangements that will include demilitarizing 
zones, 
  force reductions, warning stations; and the deployment of 
an 
  international force to supervise the implementation of the 
  arrangement. 
  The security arrangements will be reciprocal, but not 
symmetrical: Syria will be asked to demilitarize a larger 
territory than Israel. 
  Senior political sources yesterday said that the United 
States does not demand that Israel currently detail its stands 
beyond a general description of principles because Israel is way 
ahead of Syria in presenting its stands. Syria has not yet 
drafted a similar offer. 
  The presentation of the basic components of the "peace 
package" was at the center of Rabin's meeting with U.S. 
President Bill Clinton in Washington last month. Israel pledged 
to present the package to Secretary of State Christopher so that 
he relay it to the Syrians during his upcoming visit in the 
region. According to reports received in Israel recently, 
al-Asad is expecting the Israeli offer from Christopher. 
  Parallel with the arrangement with Syria, Israel will 
demand that the United States bolster Israeli security, and 
assist in implementing and guarding the arrangement. Rabin 
discussed the issue with the heads of the U.S. Administration, 
and the issue was also broached in meetings Ambassador 
Rabinovich held with U.S. officials, but it has not yet been 
raised in contacts between the Israeli defense establishment and 
the Pentagon. Rabin will discuss the security demands with 
Christopher. 
  Israel will not ask that military aid be expanded, only that 
its current level of $1.8 billion annually be maintained, as 
Clinton promised. Among the ideas raised in internal 
discussions were the placement of large amounts of U.S. arms and 
ammunition in Israel ahead of time; expanding the use by the 6th 
Fleet of the Haifa port; a deployment of armed U.S. Navy vessels 
along the Israeli coast to serve as the launching pad for 
intervention forces in the Balkans, the Persian Gulf, and 
Africa; expanding Israeli access to U.S. warning systems and 
sophisticated armament. Israel will also demand that strategic 
and political coordination with Washington be tightened. 
[passage omitted] 
  The offer for an arrangement with Syria recently drafted by 
the Foreign Ministry, which includes a full withdrawal from the 
Golan Heights as its working assumption, was prepared without 
any connection to the staff work prepared upon the request of 
the prime minister. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin says that without 
secret talks with Syria, a peace agreement cannot be reached. 
In an interview with the Cairo newspaper AL-AHRAM, Rabin says 
Israel had tried to arrange secret meetings with Syrian leaders, 
but they had refused. In the interview, Rabin accused Syria of 
talking peace, while simultaneously supporting Palestinian 
organizations opposed to negotiations. 
  Major General Ilan Biran, who today takes over as the head 
of 
the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] Central Command, has presented 
Prime Minister Rabin with a working paper on security 
arrangements on the Golan. Biran discussed the issue with the 
prime minister and with Chief of Staff Baraq on Friday and on a 
previous occasion. [passage omitted] 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0500 GMT on 17 April 
reports: "Israel has expressed its displeasure over the harsh 
criticism Syria had leveled at Oman for its willingness to host 
an Israeli delegation. Our correspondent in Washington Arye 
Golan reports that Professor Itamar Rabinovich, Israel's 
ambassador to the United States, spoke to U.S. coordinator 
Dennis Ross on the matter, and told him that the Syrian remarks 
do not contribute to the establishment of a proper atmosphere in 
view of the upcoming Middle East tour by U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher, and toward the resumption of the peace 
talks."] 
  The Prime Minister's office in Jerusalem says there were 
contacts involving Syria, after katyusha rockets landed in 
Israel, during the early hours of Friday morning. Jerusalem 
says those contacts brought quiet to the Israeli side of the 
border over the Sabbath, even if katyushas did land in southern 
Lebanon. 
  [Tel Aviv YEDI'OT AHARONOT in Hebrew on 17 April carries a 
report by Ron Ben-Yishay on pages 1 and 15, adding: "Over the 
weekend, the Israeli Government relayed a warning to Hizballah 
and Syria that if murderous attacks on the SLA [South Lebanese 
Army] and Lebanese civilians in the security zone continue, the 
IDF will feel free to ignore the understandings made after 
Operation Accountability last summer." The report adds that 
"there is growing concern among Israel's top security echelons 
that the SLA might gradually disintegrate, physically and 
morally, and that the security zone in south Lebanon might 
crumble."] 
  Also at the Prime Minister's Office, there is expectation 
for 
more progress with the PLO on Gaza-Jericho first, as the 
Israelis prepare for the resumption of those talks today. If 
the Palestinians raise the issue of the closure of the 
territories imposed a week and a half ago, an official in 
Jerusalem said last night they will be told that the possibility 
of lifting restrictions has been and will continue to be checked 
on a constant basis, including at this morning's cabinet meeting. 
  There is no reaction in Jerusalem to King Husayn's news 
conference on Hamas. Prime Minister Rabin's media adviser 'Oded 
Ben-'Ami says Israel will know whether in fact Jordan has acted 
against Hamas operations in the country, based on whether or not 
we hear from the Hamas people in Jordan again. For now, says 
Ben-'Ami, we have said what we wanted to say.

<F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Aluf Ben and 'Aqiva Eldar] </F>
  [Excerpts] In the past few weeks, a state body subject to 
the Prime Minister's Office presented Prime Minister Yitzhaq 
Rabin with a plan for a peace arrangement with Syria. The paper 
was drafted in parallel with similar work done by the IDF 
[Israel Defense Forces] and the Foreign Ministry. 
  The plan, drafted at the initiative of that body's research 
department, assumes that, in the framework of the agreement, 
there will be a total Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights 
and that the negotiations with Syria will focus on security 
arrangements and stages of normalization and withdrawal. 
  The authors of the document propose a staged withdrawal over 
a period of more than 10 years, during which the IDF will 
maintain its military presence on the Golan. They believe that 
future peace relations between Israel and Syria will be similar 
to those existing between Israel and Egypt -- perhaps even 
cooler. 
  The team that drafted the document on the arrangement with 
Syria prepared a proposal four months ago on an arrangement with 
the Palestinians. That paper determined that the preferable 
solution for Israel is the establishment of a 
Jordanian-Palestinian confederation. 
  Of the three staff works prepared in anticipation of the 
resumption of the negotiations with Syria, only the one prepared 
by Major General Ilan Biran was done by order of the prime 
minister and followed his guidance regarding the principles of 
the arrangement. Biran's paper speaks of a withdrawal on the 
Golan Heights, but not a full one. The Foreign Ministry and the 
state body, which assumed that a full withdrawal will be carried 
out, based their work on their own assumptions. [passage 
omitted] 
  As U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's tour of the 
Middle East approaches, Israeli sources in Washington have 
reported that Israel will not relay detailed plans on peace 
arrangements and a withdrawal to Syria through the United 
States. The prime minister will again ask the secretary of 
state to propose to Syria to begin a practical discussion of the 
security arrangements, but it is not clear whether al-Asad will 
accept this proposal and waive his demand that Israel pledge a 
full withdrawal in advance.

  [Text] Cairo, 17 Apr (MENA) -- The Palestinian and Israeli 
negotiators today began a new round of negotiations to overcome 
obstacles preventing the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho 
agreement for Palestinian self-rule. 
  The talks began with a separate meeting between Dr. Nabil 
Sha'th, Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat's political adviser 
and head of the Palestinian negotiating delegation, and General 
Amnon Shahaq, deputy chief of staff and head of the Israeli 
delegation, to draw up the agenda for this round of 
negotiations, which is expected to continue until Thursday. 
  In a statement to correspondents beforehand, Dr. Sha'th 
said: 
We will do our best to make this round the last. He noted that 
they will continue to discuss the topics discussed in previous 
rounds, particularly those pertaining to security and water. 
Dr. Sha'th expressed the hope that agreement will be reached 
with the Israeli delegation on these issues. 
  Regarding the impending meeting between Palestinian 
president 
Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres in 
Bucharest on Friday, Dr. Sha'th said its original purpose was 
not to try to overcome the obstacles in the current negotiations 
in Cairo. It will take place on the sidelines of the world 
economic conference, which will discuss economic cooperation in 
the Middle East in the era of peace. 
  The Security, Civilian, and Legal Affairs Committees are 
expected to meet later today.

  [Text] Jeddah, April 17, SPA -- Secretary General of the 
Organization of the Islamic Conference (ICO) Dr. Hamid al-Ghabid 
has urged the United Nations Security Council to take effective 
steps to guarantee Serbian compliance with its resolutions on 
the protection of safe areas in the Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina especially in the surrounded Moslem enclave 
of Gorazde. 
  In a statement issued here Saturday [16 April], the ICO said 
the barbaric attack on Gorazde, the murder of personnel of 
United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR), hampering United 
Nations humanitarian missions, seizing heavy weapons and the 
near massacre of thousands of Moslems living in areas protected 
by the United Nations should provide enough proof of the Serbs' 
complete defiance of the United Nations and the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization (NATO). 
  Al-Ghabid pointed out that these horrible acts not only pose 
a serious threat to the international community, but represent a 
permanent disgrace to the entire civilised world. 
  He said the view that NATO should remain neutral represents 
the ultimate appeasement of Serbian aggressors and reflects 
their scorn of relevant powerful organizations. 
  He called on the Security Council to issue a mandate for 
immediate action including air strikes by NATO against Serb 
aggressors to prevent the fall of Gorazde and the spread of the 
conflict to other areas like Zeppa and Srebrenica. 
  He said the Security Council should also reinstate the 
Bosnian republic's right to self-defence. 
  He warned that a massacre of Moslems in a United Nations 
protected area would have grave consequences on the whole region 
and seriously damage the authority of the United Nations.

  [Text] London -- Quds Press -- Hamas in the occupied 
territory has rejected threats made by senior Israeli officials 
against Jordan for allowing Hamas activists to carry out 
political and media activities within its territory. 
  In a telephone contact with the Quds Press, an authoritative 
source in Hamas said that his movement strongly disapproves of 
the arrogant threats made by Israeli rulers against the brothers 
in Jordan, adding that Hamas believes that such threats are 
desperate attempts to drive a wedge in the strong and close 
relations among the sons of the same people in Jordan and 
Palestine. 
  The source said Israelis' failure to arrest those who carry 
out the attacks forced them to move the confrontation outside 
the occupied territory, to claim that armed operations are not 
launched from within the occupied territory, and to make 
frivolous threats against Arab brothers. 
  Asked if he believes that his movement will face a secret 
war 
by the Israeli Intelligence Department similar to that campaign 
launched against the PLO two decades ago, the source said: We 
warn against any hostile acts, including terrorist 
assassinations, which Israeli officials would carry out -- 
motivated by their bloody background and feelings of frustration 
and despair -- against any of our brothers or against Hamas 
symbols and spokesmen. The source noted that his movement has 
preliminary information on an Israeli scheme to kill figures 
from Hamas. The source, however, did not give further details. 
  Commenting on the accusations made at the joint news 
conference held by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and 
Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres that the military operations are 
being planned outside the occupied territory, the spokesman [as 
published] said that the movement carries out no activities of a 
military nature in any Arab or non-Arab state, adding that the 
military activities' planning, command, and announcements are 
made inside the occupied territory. 
  The source stressed that his movement is concerned about 
Jordan's security and stability, adding that the movement does 
not want to give the Israelis any excuse to infringe upon the 
country's unity and security. The source said: We condemn any 
Israeli attempt in this regard. The source added that Hamas has 
no organizational structure outside the occupied territory, 
noting that the Arab brothers are aware of this fact and 
understand the movement's great concern about their countries' 
security and stability. 
  The source strongly criticized U.S. sympathy with the 
Israeli 
threats, saying that this is all aimed at widening the gap and 
preventing dialogue between the forces of the Palestinian people 
and official U.S. quarters. The source called on Washington to 
reassess its political positions and to show more understanding 
and realization of the nature of the political structure of the 
Palestinian people. The source warned that certain officials in 
charge of U.S. foreign policy are attempting to demolish the 
bases of peaceful relations. He added that this would create 
further hotbeds of tension and increase anger, resentment, and 
hostility toward everything related to the U.S. course.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Mahmud 'Abbas, member of the PLO </F>
Executive Committee, in Tunis, by Ashraf 'Abd-al-'Aziz, in 
Cairo, date not given; from the "Dialogue From Afar" program -- 
live or recorded] 
  [Text] ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Welcome to our program. 
  ['Abbas] Thank you. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] A new round of Palestinian-Israeli talks has 
started in Cairo over the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho 
agreement. The Economic Affairs Committee also resumed its work 
in Paris. What have these talks achieved? 
  ['Abbas] Significant progress has been achieved in the 
latest 
round of talks in Cairo. The two sides worked out full details 
concerning the police force. This topic is now closed. Once 
the signal is given, the police force will be ready to deploy. 
The issue has been fully discussed. 
  The talks in Cairo also focused on the civilian [local 
administration] functions. Only one of these functions needs 
further discussion. The current round of talks may finalize 
this issue as well. 
  Economic issues are being discussed in Paris. Economic 
issues, we all know, are numerous and complicated. At issue are 
concerns such as customs, taxes, trade, merchandise, labor, and 
currency. I can say there has been some 90-percent progress in 
this regard. I expect that issues concerning both the economy 
and the civilian administration will be resolved in the current 
round of talks. 
  If some issues remain unsettled, the two sides will decide 
whether to hold further negotiations to resolve them or begin 
implementing the agreement immediately It all depends on what 
the two sides will agree upon. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] What are the most important of the 
unresolved 
issues? 
  ['Abbas] They have to do with security, the crossings, 
geographic jurisdiction, and the judiciary. There are quite a 
few snags here and there and although we cannot shrug them off, 
I think it is advisable to begin the implementation and let the 
talks go on. This is what we plan to tell the Israelis. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] What is the real cause of the remaining 
differences between the Palestinians and Israelis? 
  ['Abbas] It has to do with the interpretation of the 
Declaration of Principles. Every side is trying to interpret it 
in the way that suits them, to tell you the truth. The 
Declaration of Principles is a document that needs 
interpretation and clarification and gives rise to differing 
views and a bit of horse-trading. This is the reason for the 
differences. 
  Naturally, the Israelis want to hold on to the land and the 
authority they have until the very last. They find it hard to 
let go. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] The recent incidents in the occupied 
territories have proven that Israel's security claims are unreal 
and that there is a need for Palestinian security as well. 
  ['Abbas] I hope the Israelis will understand this, namely, 
that both the Israelis and Palestinians need security. I hope 
the Israelis will also understand that the issue is actually one 
of confidence, not security. We are discussing peace. If we 
have genuine intentions of making peace, real security and other 
measures will certainly be taken without reference to texts. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Recent Israeli statements say the 
Palestinian-Israeli Agreement will be signed soon. Is this true? 
  ['Abbas] I cannot give dates or depend on dates. I say that 
when work on the basic and necessary files is completed, the two 
sides will be ready for signing and implementation. There is 
another point: The two sides may finish with some files and 
agree to begin implementation while negotiations on the 
remaining files continue. This is decided through negotiations. 
But we cannot say the signing will be tomorrow, the day after, 
next week, or in two weeks. A single word or minor problem may 
obstruct the signing. We cannot give people false hopes that 
may not be fulfilled. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Should we expect a summit meeting between 
Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister 
Yitzhaq Rabin very soon? 
  ['Abbas] When a summit is decided, it will mean the 
implementation of the agreement has started. Such a summit will 
be meant to announce the implementation, not to hold 
negotiations. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Mahmud 'Abbas: The file of the Palestinian 
police force was closed after an agreement was reached. Is the 
force prepared to assume security on the Palestinian territory? 
  ['Abbas] Yes. Of course. The force will be ready. It is. 
When it enters Palestinian territory, it will start assuming its 
national responsibilities on its land. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] This is my last question. The multilateral 
talks on water are now being held in Muscat, Oman. A 
Palestinian delegation is participating. What are the 
Palestinian proposals at these talks? 
  ['Abbas] We make no Palestinian proposals. We make Arab 
ones. We cooperate with the Arab brothers taking part in these 
negotiations. The water issue is of concern not only to the 
Palestinians, but to all Arab sides in the Middle East. Any 
views we may offer, therefore, must be in harmony with the views 
of our brothers who are attending the talks or are concerned 
with this issue. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Thank you. 
  ['Abbas] You are welcome.

GATT accord by India at Marrakech and charged the opposition 
with indulging in a disinformation campaign on the issue. 
Speaking to reporters in New Delhi today, the party spokesman, 
Mr. V.N. Gadgil, said the agreement will boost India's 
agricultural and textile exports. He said the government will 
now have to translate the agreement into various laws and these 
have to come before parliament. 
  The minister of state for commerce, Mr. Kamaluddin Ahmad, 
said that the new agreement is on the whole beneficial to India. 
Speaking to a group of foreign journalists in New Delhi today, 
he reaffirmed India's faith in a rule-based transparent 
multilateral trading system. 
  The BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] president, Mr. L.K. Advani, 
has criticized the signing of the Marrakech Declaration by 
India. He said in New Delhi that the treaty has been conceived 
by developed countries to promote their trade interests.

  [Excerpts] Beirut, 15 Apr (MENA)--The assassination of 
Iraqi opposition figure Talib Suhayl al-Tamimi in his house in 
Beirut continues to cause political and diplomatic interactions, 
particularly after two Iraqi diplomats confessed yesterday to 
the Lebanese judicial authorities and also before 'Awad Fakhri, 
Iraqi charge d'affaires in Lebanon that they were involved in 
the assassination. 
  While the Lebanese Foreign Ministry is expecting today to 
receive the Iraqi Government's reply to its request to lift the 
diplomats' immunity in order to try them before Lebanese courts, 
diplomatic sources expect the Iraqi reply to be negative and 
expect the Lebanese Government to expel Cultural Attache Khalid 
Khalaf and Cultural Attache Muhammad Kamil Kazim next week after 
indicting them in accordance with Lebanese laws. [passage 
omitted] 
  The Lebanese judicial authorities have asked the Foreign 
Ministry departments to provide them with a copy of the full 
identity papers of 'Ali Sultan Darwish, the Iraqi consul in the 
embassy. 
  Security authorities last night arrested Muhammad Rashid, 
manager of the al-Rafidayn Bank, and two of the bank's 
employees. They are being investigated at the same time as the 
Lebanese security forces continue to surround the Iraqi Embassy 
building. Security sources said that the siege will not be 
lifted until the wanted men are handed over. 
  The Iraqi Embassy issued a statement rejecting the measures 
taken around the embassy as a violation of diplomatic norms. 
[passage omitted] 
  As part of the security measures taken in connection with 
the 
assassination, security men raided a number of apartments in 
northern Beirut where members of the group that planned and 
carried out the assassination reside. The security men 
confiscated guns, ammunition, and silencers. 
  Lebanese press reports said that the judicial investigation 
into the assassination of Iraqi opposition figure Talib Suhayl 
al-Tamimi has revealed serious information. The confessions of 
the two Iraqi diplomats accused of the assassination indicated 
that there is an intelligence network [words indistinct] within 
another group of employees of the Iraqi Embassy and the 
al-Rafidayn Bank, including an Armenian shirt maker called 
George Tartajian who helped the defendants reach the house of 
the victim. He has been arrested. 
  The paper AL-SAFIR, which published this information today, 
said that the order from Baghdad to assassinate al-Tamimi came 
in a coded telex message to the al-Rafidayn Bank center in 
al-Sadat Street in Ra's Beirut.

Yesterday the Lebanese Government officially requested that Iraq 
lift the immunity of Iraqi diplomats Khalid Kahalaf and Muhammad 
Kazim, who are accused of assassinating Iraqi oppositionist 
Talib Suhayl in Beirut the day before yesterday evening. It 
also turned down a request submitted by the Iraqi Embassy in 
Beirut that the two detained diplomats be released, saying that 
they are under "guard" for their own safety and investigation 
requirements. [passage omitted] 
  Official Lebanese sources told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT yesterday 
that, if the Lebanese Government receives a negative response to 
its request that the immunity of the two detained diplomats be 
lifted and that the third man accused of the crime be handed 
over, it could decide to sever diplomatic relations with Baghdad. 
  The sources added that a decision would be made after 
consultation with Charge D'Affaires Sa'd Zakhya, the only 
Lebanese diplomat in Baghdad, who was summoned by the Lebanese 
Foreign Ministry for "consultation." The Lebanese sources added 
that, if Baghdad refuses to lift the immunity of the detained 
culture and trade attaches, they would be declared persona non 
grata and expelled from Lebanese territory. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Cairo, 17 Apr (MENA) -- Egypt has expressed its deep 
concern over what is happening in the Bosnian town of Gorazde 
and the continuing Serbian aggression against it. 
  Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa said in a statement today that 
this aggression is part of the ethnic cleansing that the Serbs 
are carrying out in Bosnia, describing it as a criminal 
aggression. 
  Musa added that reluctance in halting the Serbian aggression 
against Gorazde again raises the question of how the influential 
countries and NATO stand on these attacks. 
  He called for adopting immediate, deterrent measures against 
the Serbian aggression and to save the city's residents from the 
continuing bombardment. He also called for trying those 
responsible for the ethnic cleansing.

  [Text] In its session today, the Council of Ministers 
issued a statement on remarks directed against Jordan by Israeli 
officials. Dr. Jawad al-'Anani, minister of information and 
minister of state for cabinet affairs, made a statement whose 
text reads as follows: 
  The Jordanian Government has followed the serious and sudden 
stepping up of statements by Israeli officials, particularly the 
Israeli prime minister and the foreign minister, against Jordan 
and its government in light of the increasing acts of violence 
in the occupied Arab territories and in Israel and the 
intentional escalation in the official Israeli media in the wake 
of these statements, including the issuance of warnings and 
threats to Jordan that military action would be taken against 
its security and sovereignty. 
  The Jordanian Government views these sudden statements with 
surprise and disapprobation. These statements point an accusing 
finger at Jordan under the pretext that it allowed a Hamas 
spokesman to make statements from Jordan on the 'Afula and 
Hadera operations. 
  This method, which has become more frequent than at any time 
in the past, is nothing but an abortive attempt which 
demonstrates the Israeli Government's inability to distribute 
its responsibilities for dealing with the aggravating 
conditions. It is an Israeli Government attempt to brand Jordan 
with terrorism, tarnish its reputation, and undermine its 
sincere desire and effective efforts to realize just, permanent, 
and comprehensive peace in the region. 
  Jordan has endeavored on all levels to warn against the 
dangers of violence that results from the continuation of the 
Israeli occupation of Arab territories and the consequences of 
its practices, represented by collective punishment of the 
residents of the occupied territories and by daily curfews and 
killings, something which escalates the circle of violence and 
counterviolence, in addition to Israel's faltering stands in the 
peace process, its attempts to evade substantive issues, its 
practice of inventing excuses and indulging in detail, and its 
denial of rights. 
  Needless to say, Jordan has no need to defend itself or its 
record of not approving the option of violence or terrorism. 
Neither does Jordan need anyone to remind it of terror's 
consequential killing of innocents and civilians and disruption 
of the peace process. Jordan has suffered much from terror and 
paid a heavy price in blood and resources. Jordan has not and 
never will let its territory be used as a springboard or 
passageway for violence or planning it, proceeding from a 
principled stand reflecting a concern for the lives of 
innocents, human rights, democracy, and the peace process. 
  The Jordanian government has noticed that the Israeli prime 
minister said that the Jordanian television showed an interview 
with a spokesman for Hamas. No such interview was broadcast by 
the Jordanian television -- neither after the 'Afula attack nor 
after the Hadera attack. Indeed, it was the Israeli television 
newscasts that featured such interviews. 
  While emphasizing its concern for and commitment to the 
peace 
process and its call for promoting the intensive and continuous 
endeavors to realize the cherished peace, the Jordanian 
government categorically rejects methods of intimidation and of 
threats to use force. Based on its position which calls for 
peace and as a worker for the realization of peace, for 
stability in the region, and for an end to the conflict in it, 
Jordan will not submit to methods of pressure, coercion, or 
intimidation. Jordan calls for pooling all efforts and supports 
all calls that have been issued for accelerating the peace 
process and finding solutions for substantive issues. This will 
extricate the region from the circle of violence and realize 
peace, security, and stability for its peoples. 
  Having always abided by, respected, and implemented 
unanimous 
Arab decisions; and out of its respect for the will of the 
Palestinian people in their free choice of the PLO as their 
sole, legitimate representative, Jordan reaffirms that it deals 
with the PLO in its capacity as the sole party authorized to 
negotiate on behalf of the Palestinian people and undertake its 
responsibilities on Palestinian territory. 
  Jordan shall continue to deal with the PLO on this basis and 
shall not allow Jordanian territory to give prominence to any 
organizations contrary to this reality or influencing this 
reality and weakening the PLO's ability to achieve the ambitions 
and aspirations of the Palestinian people on Palestinian soil.

<F P=106> [News conference by King Husayn with unidentified reporters </F>
in Amman on 16 April -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Husayn] I would like to say that from the outset we 
had the feeling that the peace process to which we have always 
committed ourselves toward the establishment of a just, durable 
peace for future generations to enjoy and cherish and protect, 
because it is hopefully going to be a just peace and, therefore, 
a durable one -- we realized from the outset that it was going 
to take time and efforts and patience. But even by my standards 
I believe that a lot of time has passed, and that it has been 
wasted, and that the approach to peace has not been 
characterized by the required determination by all parties to 
the conflict, and all involved in trying to get it to achieve 
its objectives are sponsoring these efforts; that all this has 
with the passage of time caused a psychological setback so that 
the overwhelming majority of people in this region who showed 
great optimism and enthusiasm for peace have had their hopes 
dampened with the passage of time. 
  As far as I am concerned, it is a time for all to reassess 
and to move deliberately and seriously to achieve the desired 
results. No more time can be wasted. As for violence, we abhor 
and condemn it wherever it occurs. This is the history of 
Jordan, which has suffered as a result of violence and which has 
stood time and again squarely in the face of violence as it 
affected innocent people anywhere in the world. This does not 
change or waver. But violence in the recent times is most 
disturbing and distressing and the zenith of violence was the 
tragedy that occurred in Hebron on a Friday morning and in the 
mosque. Beyond that, there have been actions and reactions and 
our hearts go out to the victims and to the families of the 
victims, wherever they be and whoever they are. 
  But in regard to that dimension as well, I feel that the 
Government of Israel should admit, or have the courage to admit, 
that it has, and it bears, a responsibility in terms of violence 
that has been growing in the occupied territories and in the 
region. 
  On the other hand, I feel very, very strongly that the 
unfortunate target of the Hebron massacre or any other act that 
has followed is the peace process, is the hope for a different 
region were people can live under conditions which had been 
denied us over a very, very long period of time, in fact, which 
we haven't known throughout our lives. If this is the case, 
then something has to be done about it, and there has to be the 
realization that such acts are carried out to drive us away from 
the goal of attaining and achieving a just, honorable, durable 
peace in the region. 
  On an internal Jordanian matter -- before the prime 
minister of Israel and the foreign minister of Israel made their 
statements -- we, on the highest level of authority in this 
country, have been looking at developments in the region and had 
decided to reemphasize our unwavering position adopted after 
deep discussion at the Rabat summit in 1974 recognizing and 
nominating the PLO as the sole legitimate representative of the 
people of Palestine in response to a Palestinian wish and Arab 
wish, with which we agreed. And ever since then we have tried 
to our utmost to realize this position in terms in every action 
that we have taken, including providing the umbrella for the 
joint delegation, in other words, the Jordanian-Palestinian 
delegation, to go to Madrid, the Palestinians being the 
representatives of the Palestinian people regarding their rights 
on their legitimate soil -- and despite the surprise of Oslo we 
had to adhere, as we always do to our policy and perspective, 
and we emphasize the need to support the PLO. And, more 
concretely, we ratified the Jordanian-Israeli agenda following 
the ratification of the Israeli-Palestinian agreement in 
Washington in support of the Palestinians and their right to act 
in terms of the interests of the Palestinian people on 
Palestinian soil, and to move to resolve our own problems. So, 
this is the background. 
  As far as we are concerned on this land, the territories of 
the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, we do not recognize or accept 
to cooperate with anybody representing or professing to 
represent our Palestinian brethren except the Palestine 
Liberation Organization, the sole legitimate representative of 
the people of Palestine, through its recognized organs and 
representatives here in Jordan. Any other group is illegal in 
terms of any actions it takes or position it feels or claims to 
represent. And I call upon all Jordanians to realize this fact, 
and to adhere to this consistent policy that has been that of 
the government and the kingdom over so many years. 
  [Unidentified reporter] What is the legal status of the 
Hamas 
presence in Jordan, and are you planning to take any action 
against them to ensure that the PLO remains the sole legitimate 
representative of the Palestinians? 
  [Husayn] There is no legal status. 
  [Reporter] I mean [Hamas leaders] Mr. Nazzal and Mr. 
Ghawshah... 
  [Husayn,interrupting] I think that if they chose to behave 
as 
Jordanians, then that's fine, they will be amongst the other 
Jordanians, members of this family. If they choose otherwise, 
then they will have to answer for that, but there is no legal 
status. 
  [Reporter] Your Majesty, it was the first time that since 
the 
beginning of the peace process that Jordan links its 
continuation of its participation in the peace process to a 
condition, which is in this case the lifting of the blockade of 
al-'Aqabah. Now, can we deduce from here that in view of these 
pressures it is becoming, and due to the declining enthusiasms 
for the peace process, Jordan feels that the price of continuing 
the peace process--in view of these pressures--is becoming too 
high, and that Jordan at one point, due to public opinion 
pressure, or due to economic pressure, reconsider its role in 
the peace process, or its participation to begin with? 
  [Husayn] Nothing could be further from the truth. I think 
others should review their positions regarding the peace 
process. Jordan has not backed away, nor has Jordan showed any 
reluctance to serious dialogue and negotiations towards 
achieving the resolution of all our standing problems as 
outlined in the Jordanian-Israeli agenda leading to the desired 
peace and peace treaty as a crowning achievement of resolving 
these problems. We have been ready. We don't see anybody 
responding to that yet. 
  So we hope that not only on this track but on every track 
we will see movement so that the final result is a comprehensive 
peace that we all seek for this entire region. 
  Regarding al-'Aqabah, we feel that there was a deliberate 
policy to pick out Jordan from all the neighbors of Iraq 
following the tragedy of the Gulf and to treat it in a manner 
that is unacceptable. We've tried to correct this by every 
means possible over the years, but things have reached the point 
where we would like to know what is this policy and what is its 
objective and who is behind this policy. Is it the Security 
Council? Is it one single nation? Is it the coalition of 
countries of the Gulf war? We find it deeply humiliating and we 
find that one of the obvious objectives is to tarnish the 
credibility of Jordan. We accepted Security Council resolutions 
as they affect Iraq and we implemented them and we are 
implementing them. But the integrity and credibility of this 
country is something that we can't bargain over. 
  And in fact these recent accusations of Jordan and Jordan's 
involvement with terror, contrary to everything else known about 
this country, may unfortunately, whether intentionally or 
otherwise, fall in the same stream. 
  Regarding the Gulf crisis, our position was honorable and 
was 
one of concern regarding all in this region, and then eagerness 
to try to resolve the terrible mistake by Arab means and within 
the context of the Arab family. Unfortunately, we were unable 
to do nothing that would have brought us close to our targets, 
we were unable to succeed with either side in terms of the 
powers that stood facing each other until the disaster occurred. 
We are unhappy about the conditions of the people of Iraq. We 
are really concerned with them. As far as the policies of the 
government and the leadership of Iraq, we have nothing to do 
with their policies and unfortunately the last time I was able 
to discuss policies with the leadership in Iraq was the time I 
visited Baghdad before the war, and I came back brokenhearted 
because I met failure there, as I had met it with the coalition 
and with the other parties to the terrible tragedy that has 
occurred there. 
  We have accepted the Security Council resolutions. We have 
implemented them. We are implementing them to the best of our 
ability. So what is the sense of continuing this situation as 
far as al-'Aqabah is concerned? We would like to know what is 
happening and we would like to have assurances that we are close 
to the end of this situation before we are able to determine 
exactly where we go from here. But as far as the peace process 
is concerned, we are very interested in it. In fact, we did 
more to get it to move in the first place than any. And here, 
I'd like to point out that we did not go as a government alone. 
We had, to the best of our ability, a debate in this country 
through a meeting that was attended by all elected bodies in 
this country and representative bodies looked at our options and 
decided to go. We did not go there because of any pressure. We 
do not succumb to pressure, from any quarter. We go... [pauses] 
whatever we do in this world, driven by our conscience and our 
sense of responsibility towards our people and the people in 
this region and the future of all.

  [Text] Dear viewers, as you saw and heard earlier, the town 
of Gorazde, which has been declared a safe haven by the United 
Nations, has come under severe attacks from the Serbs in recent 
days and there is a possibility that the town may fall 
completely and all the town's residents may be in danger. In 
view of the importance of this issue, we invited the honorable 
foreign minister, Dr. 'Ali Akbar Velayati, to kindly come to the 
studio and grant us an interview in this regard. [passage 
omitted] 
  Dr. Velayati, I would be grateful if you could tell us about 
the Islamic Republic of Iran's stance on this issue and does 
Iran, by any chance, have any proposals towards ending the 
genocide of the Muslim people of Gorazde or not? 
  [Velayati] During the more than two years that have passed 
since the start of the Bosnian tragedy, the Islamic Republic of 
Iran has undertaken numerous steps -- both within the framework 
of the Islamic Conference Organization [ICO] and the United 
Nations -- and it is continuing to do so. Nearly all the ICO 
meetings that have been held have focused on the appointment of 
a contact group, representing the organization, with the purpose 
of making efforts at the United Nations. And the relatively 
positive steps that were taken at the UN General Assembly, I can 
tell you that all this was at Iran's initiative. 
  Iran has not confined itself to these political and 
international activities, but has also spared no effort in 
giving humanitarian assistance to Bosnian Muslims. However, 
efforts have been made, in various ways, to block the activities 
of Iran and sincere Islamic countries in this connection. For 
example, we suggested that we were prepared to put 10,000 of our 
forces at the disposal of the United Nations, so they could 
function as peacekeeping forces under the UN flag toward the 
implementation of Security Council resolutions and the 
protection of the honor and dignity of Muslims there. However, 
the United Nations, the Security Council and, specifically, the 
UN Secretary General have opposed our offer so far. 
  We have written letters and I have personally met Mr 
Butrus-Ghali, the UN secretary general, at least twice. 
Unfortunately, so far, permission has not been granted to Iran. 
We are determined to persevere so that, at least, the 
resolutions of the UN Security Council are implemented. So they 
put an end to their procrastination; so they refrain at last 
from trying to protect their own interests and further their own 
rivalries and try instead to safeguard the interests of the 
Bosnian people as members of the United Nations. I have to tell 
you that one of their most important aims is to prevent the 
establishment of an Islamic country in Europe. 
  [Announcer] Thank you.

  [Text] Tehran, April 17, IRNA -- A Persian daily here 
Sunday censured the United Nations for its indifference towards 
the tragedy of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  `JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI', editorialializing on the develpments in 
the Bosnian city of Gorazde wrote that despite being announced 
as a safe area by the U.N., Gorazde has been a target of the 
Serbs' shellings and chemical attacks over the past one month. 
  Due to the indifference of the U.N., said the daily, the 
situation has aggravated in the area to the extent that the 
Bosnian prime minister says what else the Serbs should commit to 
make them liable to punishment? 
  This statement will be recorded as a black point in the 
history of the U.N. as an organiztion that claims to support the 
rights of the nations and protect peace and security in the 
world, the paper said. 
  Turning to the hard conditions imposed on Bosnian Muslims 
and 
the fact that the Serbs do not abide by any rules and 
regulations, the daily criticized the U.N. for imposing an arms 
embargo on the Bosnian Muslims whereby reducing them to 
defenceless victims of the criminal Serbs. 
  The bitter reality that the world witnesses today is the 
death of humanity in the West on the one hand, and the 
double-standard role of the U.N. on the other, the paper said, 
adding that the world nations should, therefore, protest against 
the U.N. which has been reduced to a protector of `the law of 
jungle'.

  [Text] There was a terrorist attack in north Jerusalem a 
few minutes ago. As far as we know, three Israelis were wounded 
when a terrorist struck at them with an ax. Our police affairs 
correspondent Tali Katzenelson reports: 
  We have only initial reports about the incident. Police 
forces arrived at the scene a few minutes ago. According to 
what we know, an Arab terrorist from East Jerusalem was 
traveling on a No. 25 bus near the entrance to the Neve Ya'aqov 
neighborhood in north Jerusalem when he pulled out an ax and 
began to strike at the passengers. The terrorist wounded three 
people before a soldier from a nearby military base shot him in 
the back, killing him. The wounded were taken to a nearby Army 
base.

<F P=106> [Address by Libyan leader Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi in </F>
Tripoli on 15 April -- recording] 
  [Excerpts] Today's rally is added to other mass rallies by 
various sections of the Libyan Arab people who have moved by 
themselves and said that they have joined the ranks of 
confrontation in order to be at the historical frontline so that 
they can face the enemies who beat the drums of war and threats 
and blow the trumpets of departure for war. They do this as it 
is their custom, which history has made us accustomed to, as 
they are barbaric and savage peoples who have not ceased to 
attack us from one century to another out of injustice and 
hostility. 
  We, along with the whole world, do not belive that the 
problem is the so-called Pan Am or Lockerbie incident. This is 
only an excuse. When one of these countries -- namely Britain, 
which is one of the great powers confronting us now, confronting 
this small nation -- wanted to occupy an Arab country, Egypt in 
1882, Britain said there was a fortress [tabiyah] in Alexandria 
that was in conflict with Britain's security and should be 
removed and that Egypt's building a fortress in Alexandria 
constituted a threat to Britain's security. 
  When 'Urabi [Ahmad 'Urabi, an Egyptian nationalist who 
fought 
against British occupation] refused to remove that fortress, 
Britain attacked Egypt on the pretext of self-defense. This 
mockery was recorded in history, and convoys of martyrs became 
victims of it. 
  Matters such as these are what made important sections of 
the 
Libyan people, such as writers, artists, religious jurists, and 
lawyers, along with great masses of revolutionary people in all 
the places I have visited [sentence as heard]. Because they 
realized that the issue here is an attempt to seek unjust 
aggression and find justification for this aggression. 
  What adds to our steadfastness and strengthens our stance is 
that the struggling forces against injustice and insolence in 
all parts of the world stand by us. We salute today the 
presence of representatives of peoples and international 
organizations who raise their voices and say that America, 
Britain, and France are states that are transgressors and 
aggressors and have no right in anything they do against the 
Libyan people. The Libyan people are innocent people who have 
been wronged, and consequently, they deserve that all strugglers 
and honorable people stand by them. This is the reason of their 
presence with us today. [passage omitted] 
  France rejects the Security Council, the so-called Security 
Council, resolution. It refuses to resolve its problem with 
Libya. It refused to solve the problem although the Security 
Council calls on Libya to respond to investigations by France. 
Libya responded but France refused to cooperate with Libya to 
resolve its problem concerning the French UTA plane. 
  This is a clear violation by France of the Security Council 
resolution. The Security Council should hold a session and try 
France, which violated that resolution and refused to implement 
it. Sanctions should be imposed on it according to Article 7, 
since we are talking now about Article 7. It is false. 
  This festival is taking place in conjunction with an 
international power to support the Libyan people's rights and to 
demonstrate clear international condemnation of the aggressive 
policies of Western states. It is taking place in the shadow of 
a type of mourning, sorrow, and pain that is cast over Tripoli, 
Benghazi, and Libya as a whole. Tens of families lost their 
children, on a day corresponding to today in 1986, when America 
and Britain violated UN resolutions prohibiting the use of force 
or threats for the use of force in international relations after 
World War II. 
  They perpetrated unjustifiable barbaric aggression and a 
blatant violation of Article 7. This article should have been 
implemented on America and Britain. The UN Security Council 
could not implement this as long as the assaulting countries are 
the ones that can veto the Security Council resolutions. 
Therefore, what kind of a Security Council we are relying on? 
  Brothers, from the legal aspect, this meeting is that of 
defiance. This is a nice thing and a law on facing force. We 
see it only as a meeting of defiance of a people, of an 
important part of a people who are exposed to injustice, 
attacks, and hostility. [passage omitted] 
  After Western capitalist imperialism becomes a tyrant and 
wants to impose the impossible on the world, confrontation is no 
longer between money and law, but between money and blood. It 
said it was inevitable that blood replaced law. Exactly the 
amount of blood offered by peoples in their struggle in 
defending their dignity, humanity, and their right to life and 
existence becomes the deterrent law. There is no hope at all in 
this respect to resort to the UN charter. The UN charter has 
been destroyed. The 1986 raid on Tripoli burnt the UN charter. 
They had lied to us. America, France, and Britain had lied to 
us, and also the Soviet Union in the Stalin era. They had lied 
to us and said the United Nations is good news to the peoples of 
the world. [passage omitted] 
  They told us that this is the United Nations Organization, 
come and join us. So, we the poor and good people came. Then, 
we found that this organization was a sword brandished over our 
necks and that nations are not equal. [passage omitted] 
  Brothers, who would now dare to say that we are deceived and 
let's get out of the United Nations? We say it now. We 
(?explain) getting out of the United Nations because it has 
proved to be a lie. In the name of the United Nations, 
thousands of Iraq's children are dying. 
  Children of Iraq were burnt (?in the occupation of Kuwait). 
Do Iraqi children still occupying Kuwait deserve to die by the 
thousands in the name of the United Nations? (?We) have left 
Kuwait and all of us said it was unjust and an invasion, and we 
were against all the things Iraq's ruler did in Kuwait. All was 
condemned. 
  We are facing, without Kuwait, the same fate of Iraq. Did we 
occupy Iraq? We are facing the same tragedy. Did Korea occupy 
Kuwait? Is North Korea the only state on the earth that reached 
nuclear energy and thus makes them attack it, threaten it, and 
bomb it? It is the last state to reach nuclear energy, if it 
has reached it, that is. 
  What is this abuse, law, and ethics. There is no such thing. 
When the Soviet deterrent came to an end, the Western states 
appeared in their true colors without any fear or shame and 
appeared barbaric and savage. 
  When Khrushchev and Brezhnev were present, the Western 
states 
had ethics, and they respected international law within the UN 
framework because they were afraid of the missiles of Khrushchev 
and Brezhnev. Since the deaths of Khrushchev and Brezhnev and 
the demise of the Soviet Union, America, Britain, and France 
have no more ethics, human rights, or humaneness. [passage 
omitted] 
  Can they answer why they killed dozens of children of Libya 
(?in a day like this one)? Who can even interview them? Let us 
go and submit it to the United Nations and inform Libya's 
delegate at the United Nations tomorrow to submit, on the 
occasion of this sinister anniversary, the following question: 
Why did America and Britain kill dozens of children while they 
were asleep? 
  When they submit it to the UN Security Council tomorrow, 
America, and Britain will put their conditions because they have 
the right of veto. How can we be reassured about the UN and the 
UN Security Council? What is this Security Council? 
  [Passage omitted] If there was a law, my brothers, do you 
think it would have been possible for America, Britain, and 
France, the plaintiffs, to vote in the Security Council? Never. 
In the Lockerbie case, they do not legally have the right to 
participate in the vote because they are the plaintiffs. They 
are not neutral towards Libya. [passage indistinct] If they 
vote, and they are the plaintiffs and have the right of veto, 
what is the meaning of the Security Council, what is its set-up 
and decisions that [words indistinct] Arabs adhere to. We, the 
Libyan people, condemn Arab governments that adhere to that 
resolution. The sanctions against Libya are Arab. 
  Why don't they say that this is rubbish, this aggression. 
These are controlled [qararat manzura] resolutions that cannot 
be recognized, or they can at least be tolerated for some years 
after which Arabs should say enough. We should defy the 
deformities [a'hat]. Next to us are Tunisia, Algeria, Sudan, 
and Egypt. Let them bring their planes to us and Libyan planes 
go there. The sanctions will end, Jordan, Syria, Saudi Arabia, 
too. 
  Saudi Arabia is preventing the pilgrims. Mecca has become 
part of the sanctions. The house of God has become part of the 
sanctions. [passage indistinct] Is it possible for the house of 
God to become part of the sanctions? If a Libyan plane should 
take off with pilgrims, Saudi Arabia should say that it was a 
plane carrying pilgrims and allow it to land. But if it was for 
trade, tourism purposes, or carrying other passengers, I would 
abide by the sanctions. Saudi Arabia has the right to adhere to 
America's Security Council resolutions. 
  Pilgrims cannot land in Riyadh or even in Jeddah. We can 
[words indistinct] in Medina and then have to go by foot to 
Mecca. They are pilgrims, but Saudis say no, Mecca is part of 
the sanctions. Didn't you bring American troops -- who did not 
have any control on Mecca and Medina -- on to the peninsula. 
Here you are, [word indistinct]. The American resolution has 
proved that it has control over Mecca and Medina. These are 
facts. 
  But we cannot blame our brothers in Saudi Arabia for not 
defying Security Council sanctions. They may be wishing to be 
with us, and indeed we and them talk to each. We talk about 
American injustice, American tyranny, American contempt to the 
Arabs and all the peoples that want to liberate themselves. The 
poor, they cannot. Saudi Arabia does not dare defy America. 
Impossible. It is its destiny. Americans change governments, 
borders; they change, they assassinate, they unleash the CIA in 
the world to destroy at will. People raise a hue, a cry over the 
KGB and remain silent over the CIA. What is the difference 
between this and that, they are all evil. There is a law, 
gentlemen. America and Britain should not vote at the Security 
Council in this precise case [Lockerbie]. Besides, there is also 
this contempt for the world. Is not there justice in the world 
except in America and Britain? We said to them: try them in 
Malta, they say no; we say in Egypt, they say no; in France, no; 
in Holland, no. Justice in America and Britain only? This means 
that all other countries have no justice, and there is justice 
only in America and Britain. This is another contempt to all 
peoples. This is not permissible. From the legal point of view 
the two suspects cannot be tried in America and Britain. Why? 
Because over there they already guilty. When they speak now 
they do not say: the suspects, they say: those who have blown up 
the Pan Am and UTA planes. If they already say guilty then the 
case is no longer a case of accusation. They say: Libya 
committed the Lockerbie operation. Therefore that is it: the 
punishment of Libya, all these resolutions put an end to the 
case. They put an end to the case because they constitute 
punishment. 
  Look, as far as international law is concerned, the air 
embargo, the blockade, and so on, including the losses incurred 
by Libya because of the Lockerbie affair, are tantamount to 
punishment. Normally when this punishment is over, the 
Lockerbie affair ends automatically. Some say Libya carried out 
Lockerbie and it has been punished for it. That's it then. The 
matter should have stopped there. You said Libya carried out 
the Lockerbie operation and you punished her for it. Fine then. 
You thought Libya carried out the operation and that Libya was 
guilty. If a person commits a crime and pays the price for it, 
well that's it; he has paid the price. If you tell someone: You 
have committed a crime and its punishment will be 10 years 
imprisonment; and if you jail that person for 10 years, he must 
be released at the end of that period. You cannot detain him 
again by telling him: No, we cannot release you because you 
committed that crime in the past. But if you committed it and 
served 10 years in jail for it, why should you be detained any 
longer? That should be it. 
  Let us suppose Libya carried out Lockerbie. Well, they have 
already made her pay for it. The matter is over and there 
should be no further legal prosecution. If we need to use 
international law as an argument, then this is one of the 
arguments we are presenting to the world. We have paid the 
price and that's it; so don't talk about Lockerbie anymore and 
close the file. 
  If there is a law, how come they forget the Montreal 
agreement? How can they make light of the Montreal agreement? 
The Montreal agreement allows Libya to try the suspects on 
Libyan soil. The agreement is clear. 
  The Scottish prosecutor, the Scottish prosecutor general, 
says hand them to a court in Scotland because courts in Scotland 
are just and neutral. This prosecutor a month ago made a 
statement swearing at Libya as if he was a diplomat or a lowly 
journalist. Is it conceivable that this prosecutor general who 
should be making legal statements is so filled with anti-Semitic 
racist hatred? Semitism means Arabs. It should not be 
interpreted the way Israelis do. We are Semites. [passage 
omitted] 
  The Scottish prosecutor says Libya is a liar and has no 
credibility or integrity. How could a suspect or the accused go 
to his court when the Scottish prosecutor general makes these 
statements? What would the judge be like when the prosecutor 
behaves in such a way? [passage omitted] 
  He has said that the so-called Libyan parliament had 
rejected 
their trial in [word indistinct] and left it to public opinion. 
This a tendentious political action against Libya. He 
overstepped his position as a prosecutor general. 
  Who is trying to gain time? Is it the accused who has been 
condemned politically and by the media before a trial and eager 
to be tried to prove his innocence before the world, or is it 
the person who has falsified the facts, doctored charge sheets? 
Maybe the falsification was carried out with the full knowledge 
of the prosecution itself. 
  If there was a law, this case would not have been referred 
to 
the Security Council, just like a civil case, an ordinary crime. 
How was it referred to the Security Council? They have a 
political objective. This should not at all have been referred 
to the Security Council. When they spoke about referring it to 
the Security Council, all law experts, and you among them, said 
this was not possible. This is an ordinary crime, not a case to 
be referred to the Security Council. It is not a dispute 
between two states and should not have been referred to the 
Security Council. [passage omitted] 
  Brothers, they have no scruples. This is not possible. They 
are hunting a small people, the Libyan people, who have been 
living under threats and infringement for so many years because 
it wants to live free. 
  UN Security Council members think they could remain their 
slaves for ever. Could they protect the Israelis in the occupied 
territories? They could not. They could not because there is a 
people there that is struggling. There is an ordinary 
individual who is no governor or king, he has no power or 
medals, he is not prominent, an individual who is barefoot and 
has no identity who could carry out a suicide attack and kill 
whomever he likes among the enemies. When we told them that the 
Gaza-Jericho agreement was meaningless, they said: You are 
against peace. I replied I was for real peace and told them 
that they were the ones who were falsifying the truth and lying 
to the Jews and the Palestinians, because Jews are at risk 
because of this agreement. 
  It showed that 'Arafat is not all of the Palestinian 
fighters; he is only the head of a single organization called 
Fatah and not of the Palestine Liberation Organization. 'Arafat 
is not a fighter. The solution is down to the fighters who have 
destroyed this agreement and showed that it was... [pauses]. 
The Palestinian people have now started to fight. They have 
said: To hell with the Gaza and Jericho agreement. A new power 
has emerged over which Yasir 'Arafat has no control. From the 
beginning, on the first day the Gaza-Jericho agreement was 
signed, I made a statement and said I would deceive neither the 
Jews nor the Palestinians and that the agreement was a big lie 
because Yasir 'Arafat does not represent all the Palestinians 
and because there is a power fighting in the arena now and it is 
the one to hold negotiations with if there are to be any 
negotiations. I said negotiations should be held with the 
Palestinian people and all of the Palestinian people have to 
return to their land. They said no, we want Fatah. 
  There you are, that is what you got from Fatah. There even 
was a split within Fatah itself. Fatah hawks are now being 
killed by the Israelis and they are killing the Israelis [words 
indistinct]. Fatah are 'Arafat's followers, and they have 
revolted against him. He has even deceived the Jews. Why do 
[word indistinct] tell the Jews this is peace? This is 
swindling. By the way, they all hate the Jews, they all are 
Hitlers, all of them, from the United States to Russia. They 
all wish the Jews to be eradicated, and they tell us that those 
Jews are an evil that has to be eradicated; they hate them more 
than we do. We eventually say we and the Jews are both Semite 
and cousins, but they say that those ones are Semite and they 
have destroyed the world. This is what the French, English, and 
U.S. officials are saying; it is written in their agendas. 
[passage omitted] 
  How do they give a machine gun to a doctor? Why did not the 
Security Council convene to say that Israel is a terrorist 
state? Why does the United States support terrorism? The United 
States gives billions of weapons to so-called Israel, and 
so-called Israel armed the doctor who perpetrated the massacre 
at the al-Ibrahimi mosque. How do they give a machine gun to a 
doctor? If an Arab country had armed a doctor and he was 
witnessed fighting, they would have immediately put it in the 
blacklist, declared it as a terrorist state, and put it under 
siege, ban exports to it, humiliate and wipe it out. Why? They 
would say because it had armed the doctor. [passage omitted] 
  How come the government gave him a machine gun? Before the 
massacre, many days before, in front of the government, the 
army, the Israeli officials, he used to go out and address 
people and incite them. Are America, Britain, and France 
civilized states? America, of course, does not pretent to be 
civilized. It says we are [word indistinct], cowboys, and 
criminals. They say all criminals are there and they had formed 
America. America itself does not at all claim to be a civilized 
state, and no one can confer on it such a certificate, but are 
Britain and France civilized states? If Britain is civilized 
and if France is civilized, then to hell with civilization. 
This is not civilization. These are biased, very biased 
nations. [passage omitted] 
  We defy the Americans to come and negotiate with Libya, and 
we will not negotiate secretely with them. We are not a gang. 
States negotiate openly. We challenge them to negotiate openly 
with Libya. Even if they want to negotiate, they would say let 
us negotiate secretly. We are not a gang to negotiate secretly. 
If you are a gang, we are not a gang. It is the Israeli and 
Palestinian gangs that go to Norway or Denmark or I do not know 
where, in Oslo, to negotiate secretly. They are right, they are 
gangs: the Zionist Hagana or I do not know what gangs and the 
Palestinian armed gangs. All gangs, and they have the right to 
negotiate secretly. They are all gangs struggling for 
Palestine. But we, independent states and members of the United 
Nations who do not negotiate secretly. 
  What right has America to supply the Israelis with weapons? 
Against who? They say: it is to strike the Arab Maghreb, the 
Gulf, Sudan. They said to the Israelis: We have now done away 
with the ring countries, and now we give you weapons. Yesterday 
we saw a report on 25 aircraft whose range attains the Arab 
Maghreb, Sudan, Yemen, the Arab Peninsula. [passage omitted] 
  The so-called Israel has admitted to possessing nuclear 
weapons, why then don't they treat it like Korea? Like the 
Rabta? This is not possible. The so-called Israel is exempt of 
article 7. No matter what crimes it may commit, which fall 100 
percent under article 7, America cannot permit that article 7 is 
applied to Israel. Therefore, the charter of the UN is 
finished. [passage omitted] 
  Therefore, it is not a case of justice or injustice and 
legality or illegality. The UN Security Council member states 
have told us that the United States had threatened and told them 
to vote against Libya otherwise they would suspend economic aid 
to them; vote against Libya to get economic aid. It is like a 
judge going to witnesses and members of a court and threatening 
them, ordering them to pass unjust sentences or else. [passage 
omitted] 
  You hear statements made by the United States, Britain, and 
France; they say that Libya is against the international 
community. You three are against the international community and 
swimming against the current. You have been afflicted by 
conceit. However, this conceit will shatter on the rock of 
peoples' resistance and the Libyan people's [word indistinct]. 
This arrogance and superciliousness will escalate the 
resistance. This arrogance and audacity will inevitably 
shatter. We enter the battle with resilience, good patience, 
and unique courage. Let the battle between us and them continue 
until doomsday. They are the ones who are seeking quick profits 
and [word indistinct] without loss. They will lose in this 
battle. We are fighting on our land, while they are fighting 
outside their borders; in the seas, oceans, and continents. 
They are opening fronts to terrify the whole world. 
  As a matter of fact, this gathering of Libyan men of law, 
supported and backed by honorable men outside Libya in the Arab 
homeland and the world, is an extremely important message 
directed to America, France, and Britain precisely, the arrogant 
and leagued states that have trampled under foot international 
law, the sovereignty of peoples, the UN charter and conventions, 
which do not permit comparison between what is done against the 
Israelis and against the Arab countries. Double standards. 
This is an extremely important message if they respect world 
public opinion. But it should be made clear that it is they who 
are isolated. Setting aside the [word indistinct] between Libya 
and America, Britain and France, all the world stands on the 
side of Libya. 
  In reality they have served the Libyan people because the 
Libyan people were going along on their way, not paying 
attention. They have awakened you and told you that they wanted 
to harm you a second, third, and tenth time. They told you 
their ambitions have been continuous since Caesar's time, since 
the first century AD until today. They have warned you. In 
fact we thank them for warning the Libyan people, who were not 
vigilant. We have felt that their rifles were directed at the 
chest of each one of us. On a night like this, innocent young 
people were killed. Who blew up the the Berlin night club? In 
the end, it became clear that Libya had nothing to do with the 
Berlin nighclub. What should we do then about the dozens of 
young people who died that night? Does this mean that this is 
going to be repeated? Every Libyan is feeling that his child 
might be killed, that he might be killed, that his home might 
collapse on him at any time. He knows there is no Security 
Council any more, no United Nations or international law; there 
is a jungle. [passage omitted] We are resisting. Thank you. 
The struggle continues.

    [Editorial Report] London AL-HAYAH in Arabic, on page four 
of its 13 April issue, publishes an approximately 2,500-word 
report by reporter 'Ali al-Ruzz in Stockholm. The report cites 
interviews with three defecting Libyan officers, who are in a 
Scandinavian country after fleeing Libya when their military 
plot against the al-Qadhdhafi regime was discovered. 
  The report begins by saying that three Libyan officers 
managed to flee Libya after participating in the "October 
uprising" events. It adds: They are, perhaps, the only members 
of the secret military organization who escaped the arrests and 
managed to reach safety after having traveled for five months in 
Arab and foreign countries, and they are now members of "the 
National Front for the Salvation of Libya." 
  The three defecting Libyan officers, whom AL-HAYAH met in a 
Scandinavian country, are: 
  1. Lieutenant Colonel pilot Muhammad Bashir Salih, 36, born 
in Bani Walid, who joined the Libyan Army in 1978 and received 
training in Yugoslavia and Russia. He says that in 1988 he 
considered playing a role that would effect a change in Libya, 
and that he joined a secret military organization led by Major 
'Abd-al-Salam al-Wa'ir in 1991 after the latter talked to him 
about this organization. 
  2. Major 'Abd-al-Salam al-Wa'ir, 38, born in Bani Walid. 
  3. Captain Salim Dabnun Muhammad al-Wa'ir, 31, from Bani 
Walid. 
  Lt. Col. Salih points out that "the Libyan situation 
compelled me to think in this way because we do not have a 
state, institutions, laws, or a constitution." Discussing the 
role of the al-Warfallah tribe in the military rebellion, Maj. 
al-Wa'ir says: "The fact that most participants in this military 
action belong to the al-Warfallah tribe does not mean that other 
tribes did not take part." He adds: "As officers, we all agreed 
to hand the authority over to a civilian if our movement 
succeeded. He is Dr. Muhammad Yusuf al-Maqrif and he does not 
belong to the al-Warfallah tribe." 
  Regarding how this secret military organization was 
established, Maj. al-Wa'ir says that he was the first one who 
had the idea of establishing this organization. He adds: "Since 
my graduation in 1980, the Libyan Army has been sent on missions 
whose objectives were not known to us. We fought in Chad and 
Uganda, and in 1987 I stayed in Lebanon with the force of 
volunteers to champion the so-called the nationalist and Islamic 
forces and assist Palestinian organizations. In December 1988, 
I returned to Libya and briefed a group of officers on the idea 
of the organization. There were just five of us. Afterward, I 
went back to Lebanon in 1990, and I met with Colonel Mustafa 
Balqasim in an Arab state and briefed him on the organization. 
We agreed that he would act in one direction and I would act in 
another direction in absolute secrecy. I once again returned to 
Libya at the end of 1991, and finalized the establishment of the 
organization whose membership reached 10. I believe that the 
number of members in Mustafa's organization was similar to ours." 
  Discussing their story with the Salvation Front, Maj. 
al-Wa'ir indicates that in 1992 he briefed Col. Balqasim on the 
need to open a channel of communications with this front abroad 
because "it is the only effective faction, and because we 
received news about it through smuggled newspapers or radios, 
and also because the Front's members are known in Libya for 
their honesty and efficiency. Balqsim concurred." 
  Maj. al-Wa'ir adds that in 1993, a third organization led by 
Colonel Miftah Qarrum, who suffers from leukemia, joined the two 
organizations, and that "following several contacts and 
meetings, a plan of action was agreed, and was to be implemented 
no later than the spring of 1994. I agreed with Balqasim and 
Qarrum on the broad outlines of the program designed to topple 
the regime and on the transitional period. There was one 
objective; namely, to topple the regime and establish a 
democratic constitutional state." 
  Concerning the details of the coup attempt, Cap. al-Wa'ir 
discloses that, according to the plan of action, military units 
would move in Tripoli, Banghazi, Misratah, Tarhunah, Sabratah, 
and Gharyan. He also revealed that the targets of the coupists 
were the army command headquarters in Bab al-'Aziziyah, the 
intelligence directorate, the al-Jamahiriyah security 
commission, and centers belonging to a group of the Republican 
Guard battalions. However, he adds, the Libyan regime 
discovered the plan, so the coupists sought to implement the 
plan on 15 October but the arrests and confrontations with the 
regime began on 12 October, so the coup attempt failed. 
  The report cites Lt. Col. Salih as saying that on 12 October 
the Libyan military intelligence arrested Col. Miftah Qarrum, 
Col. Mustafa Balqasim, Major 'Ali al-Kakli, Major Khalil 
al-Jadak, Major Ramadan al-'Ayhuri, and other officers. 
  Concluding, the report cites Major al-Wa'ir as refuting the 
claims that the organization's officers recently shown on Libyan 
television were spying for the United States and stressed that 
these officers are honorable ones who were only agents working 
for Libya.

<F P=106> [Report by Muhammad 'Allam in Cairo] </F>
  [Text] Chief Palestinian negotiator Dr. Nabil Sha'th has 
warned that he who does respect the dates in the agreements that 
he has signed does not adhere to the texts of these agreements, 
and accused Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin of going too 
far in his attempt to ignore the dates, saying this violates the 
commitments by which we are determined to abide. 
  Sha'th told AL-HAYAH that any agreement takes place between 
two sides, and we should reach an agreement within two or three 
weeks at most. [sentence as published] 
  He expressed the Palestinian side's fear that Rabin may 
delay 
the deadline from 15 May to a later date, and said: We are 
supposed to fix a date and to stick to it. 
  Sha'th reiterated the call on the U.S. Administration to pay 
its role as a sponsor of the peace process, and to adhere to its 
stated positions, and said: We are determined to continue the 
negotiations. 
  He described U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's 
expected visit to the region later this month as important. 
  On the Hadera operation that took place yesterday, he said: 
It is painful that actions of killing in Gaza, Hebron, 'Afula, 
and Hadera continue and that innocents, whether they are 
Palestinians or Israelis, are killed without any reason other 
than that no applicable just peace has been reached. 
  He said the operation should encourage an expedited peace 
agreement in order to protect the innocents on both sides. 
  Answering a question on a statement by Military Intelligence 
Commander General Uri in which he said negotiating delegation 
members Muhammad Dahlan and Faysal al-Husayni, among others, are 
nominees to replace Palestinian President 'Arafat, Sha'th 
accused Israel of trying to instigate differences among the 
Palestinian personalities and said: This is no more than an 
attempt to instigate 'Arafat in an exposed and lowly manner 
against his men. 
  Sha'th denied that there is agreement with Israel on 
supplying the Palestinian police with six helicopters, two of 
which will be placed at the disposal of President 'Arafat, and 
said: There is no such agreement. 
  He denied that there is a plan to convene a meeting between 
'Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres in Bucharest 
tomorrow.

  [Text] Nabil Sha'th, chief Palestinian negotiator to the 
PLO-Israeli talks, has said that within a week of the signing of 
the Gaza-Jericho agreement 6,500-7,000 military and police 
personnel will enter Gaza and Jericho as the backbone of a 
Palestinian security force. 
  In statements to the Egyptian daily AL-AHRAM published 
[words 
indistinct] that considering that their families will accompany 
them, a total of 30,000 Palestinians will enter Gaza and Jericho 
within a week. Most of these, he noted, belong to the refugees 
who were displaced in 1948. Together with them will also enter 
the entire political Palestinian leadership [passage indistinct] 
to look into the return of the persons displaced in 1967. 
  Sha'th emphasized that the presence of a national authority 
inside will lead to the institution of some symbols of 
sovereignty like measures related to economic development. He 
indicated that the donor countries that have decided to 
contribute financial grants toward the development of Gaza and 
Jericho are waiting for the signing of the accord and the 
installation of the Palestinian authority. Economic development 
and water, he said, will be the most pressing issues for the 
Palestinian authority. If a solution is not found to the water 
issue, there will be a retrenchment in the agricultural sector. 
We will rely more heavily on pollution free modern technology, 
tourism, and trade, said Sha'th.

<F P=106> [Report by Maher Chmaytelli] </F>
  [Text] Cairo, April 18 (AFP)--Israel and the PLO are 
working to resolve three key issues holding up the launch of 
self-rule for Gaza and Jericho, chief Palestinian negotiator 
Nabil Sha'th said here Monday [18 April]. 
  "There are issues without which we cannot sign an agreement: 
jurisdiction, water, prisoners," he told reporters as 
negotiations resumed here. 
  The Palestine Liberation Organisation rejected an Israeli 
compromise proposal on the scope of Palestinian jurisdiction in 
the Gaza Strip and West Bank town of Jericho, Sha'th had said 
late Sunday after the latest round of talks opened. 
  Israel proposed that Palestinian jurisdiction extend to all 
non-Israelis and non-Palestinians, apart from those visiting 
Jewish settlements. 
  Sha'th said Israel also proposed that a Palestinian charged 
with a crime against an Israeli should be tried before a 
Palestinian court if he is arrested in the autonomous areas but 
otherwise before an Israeli court. 
  Israel had initially wanted to maintain jurisdiction over 
all 
foreigners as well as over any Palestinian charged with a crime 
against an Israeli. 
  Sha'th charged that Israel's position on jurisdiction was "a 
clear violation of the Declaration of Principles," referring to 
the historic autonomy accord signed on September 13 by Israel 
and the PLO. 
  "From our point of view, the only (areas) out of our 
jurisdiction are Israelis and settlements," he said. 
  The PLO has also put the question of prisoners back on the 
agenda, following an announcement by both sides last week that 
5,000 Palestinians would be released in two stages within three 
weeks of the signing of an overall accord. 
  Sha'th had said the remaining 5,000 Palestinians held in 
Israeli jails would be discussed at future negotiations on the 
autonomy for the rest of the West Bank and on elections for Gaza 
and Jericho. 
  But Muhammad Dahlan, the PLO delegate in charge of the 
prisoners' dossier, said Monday that the issue was still on the 
table. The Palestinians want the release of 8,300 prisoners, he 
said. 
  The move follows talks last week between the PLO and the 
Palestinian Islamic militant group Hamas, a fierce opponent of 
the autonomy negotiations, on coordination in the occupied 
territories. 
  Israel has turned down PLO calls for a general amnesty and 
refuses to free prisoners of militant groups such as Hamas, 
which claimed responsibility for two bomb blasts earlier this 
month that killed 12 Israelis. 
  On the question of water-sharing, the Palestinians have 
reported progress. 
  "We have the right to control the water resources of Gaza 
and 
Jericho, as well as the right to manage (its distribution)," 
said Jamil al-Tarifi, a Palestinian delegate to water talks. 
  "It's true that the Jewish settlements will not be under our 
authority but we want to know what quantities of water they will 
draw," he said, adding that the settlements had 22 of the 
deepest wells out of the total of 500 in Gaza. 
  "The Israeli positions are starting to coming nearer to 
ours, 
and we hope to reduce the differences further today," he said. 
  In Muscat, officials and experts from more than 40 countries 
and organisations held a second day of talks Monday to discuss a 
formula for water sharing in the Middle East, with delegates 
speaking of progress. 
  The talks, part of the multilateral track of Middle East 
peace talks, were attended by Israel, its Arab neighbours, 
Turkey and other parties.

  [Text] Cairo, 18 Apr (MENA) -- Palestinian and Israeli 
negotiators resumed their meetings this morning with a meeting 
of the Security Committee cochaired by Major General 
'Abd-al-Razzaq Yahya and General Effin Agmon, deputy chief of 
the Israeli Army's planning department [name and title as 
received]. 
  General 'Uzi Dayan, chief of the Israeli Army's planning 
department, who was heading his country's delegation to the 
talks, left Cairo last night for a day in Israel. He is 
expected to return to Cairo tonight to join the talks. 
  According to Palestinian sources, the Legal Affairs 
Committee 
will resume its talks today. The committee will examine two 
working papers, a Palestinian and an Israeli, concerning the 
legal and judicial powers of the Palestinian authorities in the 
self-rule areas. 
  Khalid al-Qidrah, a member of the Palestinian negotiating 
team, yesterday told MENA that the paper Israel presented at the 
end of the last round is "completely unacceptable." 
  According to Palestinian sources, members of the Civilian 
Affairs Committee will meet today in subcommittees to discuss 
water, communications, and other unresolved issues. Experts 
from both sides will attend the meetings of the subcommittee on 
water, the same sources said. 
  The subcommittee on communications will mainly discuss the 
frequencies that the Palestinian authorities will use for 
police, communications, and other purposes. The two sides 
agreed on measures concerning the creation of a Palestinian 
radio and television service, according to the same sources. 
  The Palestinian sources said that a subcommittee emanating 
from the Legal Affairs Committee will begin working today on the 
draft of a final agreement. The same sources said that it is 
too early to speak of progress in the talks as they have just 
started. 
  Dr. Nabil Sha'th and General Amnon Shahaq, head of the 
Palestinian and Israeli delegations respectively, held a private 
meeting this morning in which they discussed issues concerning 
this round of talks, which will last until 21 April.

<F P=106> [Report from the "With the Events" feature] </F>
  [Text] The Israeli-Palestinian talks within the context of 
the Security and Civilian Affairs Committees continued in Cairo 
today. To learn the latest developments in this regard, let us 
move to our correspondent 'Umar Zaydani [in Cairo]: 
  [Begin recording] [Zaydani] The security talks held between 
Israel and the PLO today primarily addressed the issue of 
security, prisoners, and the repatriation of deportees. 
Muhammad Dahlan [the PLO delegate in charge of the prisoners' 
issue] informed us that the Palestinians are demanding the 
release of 8,300 prisoners. Last week, it was agreed that only 
5,000 prisoners would be released. The talks have continued 
regardless of the statements being made by either Hamas or the 
Israelis, Dahlan noted. 
  Reports have revealed a willingness on the part of Hamas to 
halt violence in return for a halt to the pursuit of Hamas 
personnel by the Israeli security authorities. 
  [Dahlan] I am not interested in what Hamas or the Israelis 
are saying. We are negotiating the release of all prisoners. 
  [Zaydani] [Words indistinct] 
  [Dahlan] No, there are no [words indistinct] or (?bargains) 
over the prisoners currently under way. The number of the 
prisoners whose release we demand stands at 8,300. 
  [Zaydani] Muhammad Dahlan also informed us that six 
deportees 
will be repatriated tomorrow, and 10 others will be repatriated 
on 21 April. Among the deportees who will return from Libya and 
Algeria are Salih Abu-Sa'id and Nasim al-Farrah. 
  Moreover, the Legal Committee resumed its meetings today. 
Progress was made in the deliberations of this committee. The 
Israelis submitted a working paper, whereas the Palestinians 
submitted another working paper during the deliberations of this 
committee. The two papers are currently being addressed, as 
Khalid al-Qidrah, head of the Palestinian delegation to the 
Legal Committee, said: 
  [Al-Qidrah] We cannot speak of differences right now. The 
Palestinian and Israeli working papers are being debated and 
negotiated. God willing, there is progress. I do not want to 
delve into details. But, indeed, there is progress. 
  [Zaydani] With regard to the negotiations on the launching 
of 
a Palestinian radio and television station, these negotiations 
were interrupted for some time soon after they had been started. 
This was because the Palestinian side backed down on an initial 
agreement reached in this regard in Cairo in February. 
  Radwan Abu-'Ayyash [Palestinian negotiator in radio and 
television affairs] left the negotiations for consultations with 
Nabil Sha'th. As for (Shlomo Vax), he informed (Gabi Johar) of 
the differences with the Palestinians. These differences 
concern the extent and scope of the frequencies to be used by 
the Palestinians. They also concern the range of these 
frequencies. Unless the Palestinian back down on these demands, 
the Palestinians will not have a Palestinian radio and 
television station. A source close to the Israeli delegation 
informed us that Israel is willing to meet the Palestinian 
demands regarding all that concerns the radio and television 
station. The Israelis are also willing to meet demands 
regarding frequencies for civilian communication equipment and 
police communications equipment. However, the Palestinians also 
want frequencies for airports and ports, something not enshrined 
in the agreement. [end recording]

  [Text] No progress was made in the Cairo talks today, our 
correspondent Moti Amir reports. The Palestinians presented a 
detailed working paper on water matters, and Israeli experts 
will go to Cairo tonight to study it. Differences surfaced in 
the subcommittee on communications and following the 
intervention of the delegation heads, the Palestinians withdrew 
their demand to reopen issues already agreed upon two months ago. 
  Muhammad Dahlan told our correspondent that six deportees 
would arrive in the Gaza Strip tomorrow, and another 10 on 
Friday. He noted that there has still not been any progress on 
the release of Palestinian detainees. He said Israel now agrees 
to release only 4,000 detainees although last week it agreed to 
free 5,000. The PLO is demanding the release of 8,300 
detainees, including Hamas activists.

  [Text] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, head of the Palestinian 
delegation to the Gaza-Jericho Committee meetings, has announced 
that some progress has been made in the talks currently taking 
place in Cairo on Palestinian autonomy, despite the fact that 
the Israeli side has refused to give total amnesty to all the 
Palestinian detainees. Sha'th clarified that the two sides have 
come close to reaching agreement over the powers of the 
Palestinian judiciary and other issues pertaining to air 
transportation, communications, and some security matters. He 
expected that concentration during the talks this week will be 
on important security and civilian matters dealing with Israeli 
withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho and on the powers of 
Palestinian autonomy. 
  At the same time, Faysal al-Husayni, the prominent 
Palestinian figure in the occupied territories, warned that any 
delay in reaching agreement on implementing the Declaration of 
Principles will have negative repercussions. He expressed his 
belief that the situation in the occupied territories is very 
dangerous.

  [Text] The negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians 
are continuing in Cairo today. Today's talks revolve around the 
release of the Palestinian detainees. A member of the 
Palestinian delegation said Israel has agreed to release all the 
detainees, including Hamas members, adding that the main 
argument revolves around the timetable for their release. 
  Our envoy in Cairo Moti Amir was told by a Palestinian 
source 
that Egypt will open a quasi-consulate in Jericho which will 
serve the residents of the Palestinian autonomous areas until an 
independent Palestinian state is established. According to the 
source, the consulate will be located in a building belonging to 
the Coptic church, upon the approval of the head of the Coptic 
church in Egypt.

  [Text] The water resources working group within the 
multilateral talks stemming from the Middle East peace 
conference continued its meetings at the Muscat Intercontinental 
Hotel this morning. 
  The sultanate's delegation to this meeting was led by His 
Excellency Muhammad Bin-'Alawi al-Khusaybi, the Omani ambassador 
to Japan. 
  A source close to the meeting said the group will discuss 
the 
same issues on its agenda again today, including regional 
cooperation, administering water resources, and collecting data 
on water and water supplies. 
  The conferees have initially agreed to set up an 
international research center on sea water desalination in the 
sultanate. The center will try to coordinate research efforts 
in order to reduce the costs of sea water desalination 
technology, in order to enable the countries of the region to 
get fresh water at low cost, and to reduce dependence on 
declining quantities of surface and ground waters.

<F P=106> [By Nadim Kawash] </F>
  [Text] Muscat, April 19 (AFP) -- Delegates on Tuesday [19 
April] hailed the latest round of Middle East water talks as the 
most successful since the discussions were launched more than 
two years ago. 
  The talks, part of the multilateral track of the peace 
process, were winding up Tuesday after bringing together 
representatives from 43 countries and organisations, including 
Israel and Arab states. 
  "It is the most successful round of talks by the water 
committee", an Arab delegate told AFP. 
  "Several useful studies were presented and the meeting 
yielded the first fruit of the negotiations: a desalination 
research centre in Oman". 
  Oman proposed setting up the centre at Sunday's opening 
session following a five month study with the help of 
international experts. 
  The centre would study ways of cutting the high cost of 
desalination which is sapping the resources of water-starved 
Gulf states. 
  Omani minister of state for foreign affairs, Yusuf 
Bin-'Alawi 
Bin-'Abdallah, said it would benefit Arabs, Israel and other 
parties as some states outside the Gulf could opt for 
desalination in future to face growing water consumption. 
  Other projects being discussed are a meteorological centre, 
a 
water data bank and a regional water authority proposed by the 
United States and other Western countries. 
  Delegates said Japan and other industrial nations renewed 
pledges to support such projects and provide expertise and 
technical training. 
  The training would benefit Palestinians most as they are on 
the verge of managing their own water resources but lack the 
technology and experience, the delegates said. 
  "The United States, France, Japan, Germany and other 
industrial countries have assured us they will extend assistance 
in all fields pertaining to water", Palestinian chief delegate 
Riyad al-Khudayri told AFP on Tuesday. 
  He said the talks were gaining momentum now that 
Palestinians 
were creating their own water authority in line with the 
September 13 autonomy accord signed between Israel and the 
Palestine Liberation Organisation. 
  Western delegates described the Muscat disccusions as more 
constructive than previous meetings but admitted final agreement 
on water sharing needed time. 
  "Water is a vital and complicated issue and it has to do 
with 
politics" one delegate said. "All parties involved agree on the 
need for water cooperation but there are some differences on the 
extent and shape of this cooperation". 
  Bin-'Alawi opened the talks, the water committee's first in 
a 
Gulf state, with a call for cooperation to prevent potential 
conflict and bring regional states closer together. 
  Turkey, the only country in the region to enjoy a large 
water 
surplus, was actively involved in the Muscat discussions but it 
did not push its five-year-old proposal to supply Gulf states 
with sweet water through a multi-billion-dollar pipeline. 
  "We have made the proposal before and it is still in force 
because it was found feasible" a Turkish delegate said. "It's up 
to the Arabs now to decide if they want the project". 
  Gulf governments have turned down the offer on the grounds 
it 
is expensive and poses security risks. Conference sources said 
the Omani desalination research project implied the region 
wanted to remain dependent on the more secure desalination 
facilities, which provide them with nearly 70 percent of their 
sweet water needs. 
  Israeli deputy foreign minister Yosi Beilin is heading a 
team 
of nearly 20 officials and experts, the first time the Jewish 
state has sent an official delegation to a Gulf Arab country. 
  Jordan is taking part in the talks as an observer after 
boycotting negotiations in protest at naval interceptions off 
its coast by Western forces enforcing a United Nations embargo 
against neighboring Iraq. 
  Iran, another key regional country, stayed away because it 
is 
opposed to negotiations with Israel. 
  Syria and Lebanon are boycotting all multilateral talks. 
Delegates said Lebanon could be a key player in water activity 
in the region given its large but unexploited water resources.

  [Excerpts] Cairo, 18 Apr -- In a press statement published 
here today, Kuwaiti Ambassador to Egypt 'Abd-al-Hamid 
al-Bu'ayjan, said the way to resolve the pending problems is for 
Iraq to abide by all UN Secretary Council resolutions and the 
resolutions of the Iraqi-Kuwaiti border demarcation committee. 
  Ambassador al-Bu'ayjan called on the Iraqi regime to deal 
with the case of Kuwaiti POW's case and missing persons through 
the Red Cross and to allow the latter to send a mission to visit 
Iraqi jails and detention centers. [passage omitted] 
  The ambassador pointed out that the Iraqi statements do not 
add anything new. In the past, the Iraqi regime also revoked 
the decision to annex Kuwait until a cease-fire is reached, but 
it then presented a memorandum to the UN Security Council, 
saying that revoking the annexation decision was taken under the 
then prevailing conditions and began to repeat the same story 
about the 19th governorate in its media and political 
publications. 
  Replying to a question on the suggestion that a Kuwaiti 
parliamentarian delegation be sent or that some figures should 
shuttle between Baghdad and Kuwait, Ambassador al-Bu'ayjan said 
Arab League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid has 
exerted great efforts in this respect and that such trips would 
be useless without a recognition of international resolutions.

<F P=106> [Report by Khalid Salah and Yasir Zari'] </F>
  [Text] Reliable sources have revealed some very important 
information to AL-'ARABI, which is being published for the first 
time, about a long series of contacts between Israel and the 
groups carrying out religious violence in Egypt during the last 
five years. Approximately 30 contacts have been monitored by 
the security service in this country. 
  AL-'ARABI has secured a letter confirming these contacts and 
asking the U.S. Embassy in Cairo to provide Israeli researchers 
and research centers with specialized information on the results 
of secret contacts with these groups, in particular with the 
al-Jihad organization. 
  Israeli attempts to contact these groups in Egypt started in 
1989. These contacts used to take place under the slogan of 
information and press dialogues. 
  The Israeli researchers used to introduce themselves to the 
members of the religious groups as reporters for Western media 
organization. The following is what happened in a contact 
monitored by the Egyptian security service in the summer of 1989 
with a student in the School of Agriculture at Cairo University: 
  He was a prominent member of the Islamic group at the 
University. An Israeli researcher succeeded in introducing 
himself to the student as a correspondent for the German 
magazine DER SPIEGEL. Through this student, the Israeli 
researcher managed to meet a large number of members of the 
group who were also members of the Student Union. 
  In 1990 an Israeli journalist from the magazine HA'OLAM HAZE 
visited Imbabah accompanied by a member of the Islamic group. 
The latter knew the real identity of the journalist. The 
Israeli journalist met in Imbabah with a large number of leading 
figures from the group and learned about their activities there. 
This journalist resided in Egypt many weeks during which he 
managed, through another member of the Islamic group who at that 
time was training to become a journalist in a newspaper that 
labels itself Islamic, to meet with leaders of the group in the 
Governorate of al-Minya. He met with these leaders after a 
seminar that he attended with them at the Sudanese Student 
Union's headquarters in Cairo and after the sectarian sedition 
incidents in Abu Qurqas in al-Minya Governorate in 1991. A 
lawyer called M.W., who is also a member of the Islamic group, 
accompanied a number of Israeli researchers to the city of Abu 
Qurqas after he learned of their true identity. This caused a 
serious dispute between the leaders of the group in al-Minya 
regarding contacts with Israelis. In this dispute, one group 
defended contacts with the Israelis under the pretext that the 
call also targets the Jews since they are the People of the Book. 
  The document that AL-'ARABI has procured reveals an 
important aspect of the Israeli contacts with the religious 
groups in Egypt and the U.S.-Israeli cooperation in this field. 
In the summer of 1991 an Israeli researcher from the Gustav 
Heineman Institute, which is part of Haifa University, held many 
meetings with members of the Islamic groups. He also met with a 
number of leaders of a group called the Husam al-Battuti group, 
which has seceded from the al-Jihad group in Bani Suwayf led by 
a man named Majdi Kamal. In this context, we have the 
"document," which is really a letter from the director of the 
Asian and African Studies Center of the Heineman Institute dated 
5 September 1992 to an American researcher named Dr. Harold 
Marthuni from the University of California. The letter refers 
to the meetings mentioned earlier that the Israeli researcher 
held. The literal translation of the letter is as follows: 
  "Dear Dr. Harold, (5 September 1992) 
  "We thank you for the valuable documents you provided to the 
Israeli researchers in Cairo. In fact, we are looking for a 
different kind of cooperation. Our colleague Dr. Dick Bergman 
contacted some of these fundamentalists who took him to the home 
of one of them in the city of Bani Suwayf. They presented him 
with documents similar to your papers on the concept of judging 
the state authorities as heretical. However, our researchers 
doubted the results of all the contacts. This is why we asked 
our embassies to mediate with the U.S. Embassy in Cairo to 
inform us of the results of their contacts with the al-Jihad 
group in particular. We also hope for your cooperation in this 
framework. In addition, we hope you will place the study you 
are currently carrying out on the agenda of the special seminar 
we are holding in cooperation with your renowned university. 
  "Thank you 
  "[Signed] Gavri'el Warburg, director of the institute" 
  The value of the letter lies in the fact that it shows the 
tip of the iceberg on this subject. It notes the visit by one 
of the most famous Israeli researchers on Egyptian matters to 
Cairo. This researcher is Dick Bergman, the researcher at the 
African and Asian Studies Center of the Heineman Institute. His 
objective was to prepare a field study on the religious groups 
in Egypt. 
  The sources confirm that some of the reasons that prompted 
the Israeli researchers to doubt Bergman's results were the fact 
that some of the people he met with who belong to the Islamic 
groups confirmed that they might agree to accept Israel in the 
region as soon as they assume power. According to him, they 
consider the ruling regime to be further away from God than the 
Jews, since the Jews are the People of the Book. 
  The sources confirm that the Israelis were very careful 
about 
getting the largest amount of information possible from the 
Americans regarding their meetings with the religious groups in 
Egypt, especially after they learned that these contacts 
continued outside of Egypt after the contacts between these 
groups and the U.S. Embassy were revealed. 
  Proceeding from an American proposal, the Israelis organized 
a research roundtable in June 1993 at Haifa University. Four of 
the most prominent U.S. researchers specializing in studying the 
fundamentalist groups in the region and Egypt took part in this 
roundtable, in addition to Israeli researchers from the Gustav 
Heineman Institute. 
  The sources confirm that this roundtable went on for three 
days, during which they discussed and analyzed all the reports 
and U.S.-Israeli contacts with members of religious groups in 
Egypt. Researchers who participated in this roundtable explored 
the various scenarios that could be expected from the contacts 
and changes in behavior of the religious groups toward Israel 
should they assume power in Egypt.

  [Text] Asyut, 18 Apr (MENA)--President Husni Mubarak 
affirmed that Egypt has preserved, and will continue to preserve 
and guard the moderate Islamic heritage and culture, and that 
its people have been an example of forgiveness, moderation, and 
religious tolerance since the dawn of history. 
  This came in the president's message today to the people of 
Asyut during a popular celebration to mark the governorate's 
annual festival in Markaz Manfalut, Asyut. Awqaf Minister 
Muhammad 'Ali Mahjub read the message on the president's behalf. 
  President Mubarak emphasized that society's peace and 
stability is a national issue, the responsibility for which 
falls on each citizen--on both the majority and opposition, and 
primarily on the political institutions and organizations, and 
the popular, professional, and trade associations. 
  He stressed that Egypt belongs to all Egyptians, 
pro-government and opposition alike, and that sustaining its 
safety and peace is the responsibility of all its sons. Egypt 
is above all and bigger than all, he said. 
  Reviewing the economic reform march, the president said that 
we are about to reap the fruits of that reform. The masses of 
the great Egyptian people provided real support to guarantee the 
success of that reform, he said. 
  Mubarak affirmed that the future is promising and calls for 
optimism and hope to overcome many of the crises our great 
people have withstood and to make up for the sacrifices they had 
to make to put the homeland on the right course. 
  Touching on the current phase the country is going through, 
the president said that the success of the human, economic, and 
political development march, along which we have gone far, 
depends on a cohesive national front and a stable and secure 
society. He stressed a number of general principles considered 
crucial to ensuring the success of the Egyptian march. These 
principles emphasize that society's security and stability is a 
national issue and that the Egyptian political system's strength 
lies in its effort to expand democracy without disturbing the 
criteria that distinguish democracy from anarchy. They also 
emphasize that serving the masses can only be done through 
serious and sincere work and by giving public interest priority 
over all else, that social peace is the safety valve for the 
national march, and that terrorism is an open war against Egypt 
and its people that seeks to waste the country's resources and 
ruin its accomplishments. 
  The president stressed that Egypt has preserved and will 
continue to preserve and guard the moderate Islamic culture and 
heritage. Advocates of violence should know that all they will 
harvest by indulging in their action is disgrace and social 
isolation, he said.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the Political Bureau of the Hamas; </F>
place and date not given] 
  [Text] Since he took office, the terrorist Yitzhaq Rabin 
has been pursuing repression against all sections of our 
Palestinian population and ordering the occupation troops to 
shoot at our people without discriminating between armed and 
unarmed or young and old people. He has also unleashed armed 
gangs of settlers to terrorize and kill our people and profane 
their holy sites. Unprovoked and ongoing killings carried out 
by the occupation troops and settlers have targeted women, 
children, and the elderly. 
  Despite Rabin's peace protestations, the launch of the 
Madrid-Washington process, and the signing of the Oslo accord, 
the Rabin government's crimes against our people have doubled as 
have the draconian security measures, including collective 
punishment, and the closure of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
  In response to these criminal policies, our people have 
stepped up their resistance to occupation and their 
confrontations with its tools represented in the troops and 
settlers, which is the same strategy of Hamas [Islamic 
Resistance Movement]. 
  The Rabin government's repressive measures have gone too far 
and climaxed when his soldiers colluded with the settlers in the 
hideous Hebron massacre against kneeling worshippers at dawn 
prayers. 
  Moreover, soldiers opened fire on pregnant women while at 
home or standing in their doorways, thus spurring our people to 
escalate their resistance to occupation and to avenge the 
martyrs of the horrific Hebron massacre. 
  To honor the martyrs' blood, the martyr 'Izz-al-Din 
al-Qassam 
Battalions active across our country decided to take revenge for 
our martyrs' blood. Two of our heroic mujahidin carried out two 
acts of martyrdom in 'Afula and Hadera against soldier and 
settler targets. The operations were mounted in the face of the 
strict security measures instituted by the Rabin government to 
attend celebrations marking the anniversary of the theft of our 
country. 
  The failure of the Rabin government's measures to preempt 
our 
heroic mujahidin on the eve of launching an implementation of 
the Oslo accord and against the backdrop of his promises of 
security and tranquility for the Zionist public as a result of 
that accord and the disgraceful PLO concessions, coupled with 
rising Likud opposition to his policies, has left him frustrated 
and feeling a sense of doom and confusion. 
  Hamas would like to make the following points: 
  First: The terrorist Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has issued 
a threat to brother Jordan, claiming that the Movement maintains 
its headquarters on its territories. Rabin demanded that Jordan 
crack down on Hamas in a wretched attempt to capitalize on a 
confirmation by the Movement's representative in Amman that 
al-Qassam Battalions were responsible for the heroic operations 
in 'Afula and Hadera. 
  Rabin and his criminal government colleagues know only too 
well that the planning, execution, and announcements on the 
battalion's operations all originate in the occupied territories. 
  Using a combination of his inability to forestall these 
operations and the exposure of his deceptiveness in the 
settlement process, Rabin issued the threat to Jordan to advance 
the following goals: 
  1. To shift attention away from the failure of his draconian 
security and repressive measures to thwart the heroic acts of 
martyrdom executed by al-Qassam Battalions and our people's 
resistance throughout the land. 
  2. To use the clout of the United States to press Jordan 
into signing a unilateral peace agreement with his government on 
the Oslo accord model. This threat fits in with the inspection 
of merchant vessels bound for the Port of al-'Aqabah as a lever 
of pressure on brotherly Jordan and the retention of Syria on 
Washinton's list of nations sponsoring terrorism as a tool to 
press the Syrians into backing down on their demand for a 
universal settlement on all fronts. 
  Hamas is not unaware of what the enemy hopes to reap from 
peace -- the Arab parties' capitulation to its demeaning terms 
and a consolidation of its dominance over our region, while it 
stays in our territories. Rabin and his government's 
allegations are false and groundless. Our Movement's 
single-minded purpose is resistance to occupation until victory 
and liberation. 
  Hamas hereby underlines its concern for the security and 
stability of all the countries where it has political and media 
representatives who observe their respective laws. Hamas 
strives to deny any grounds for the occupying enemy to apply 
pressure on any of these countries. 
  Second: Hamas' established policy had been that 'Izz al-Din 
al-Qassam Battalion's operations should be directed exclusively 
at occupation troops and its military agencies, as well as the 
settlers as army reservists. Al-Qassam Battalions had taken 
pains to spare civilians in their anti-occupation action. 
  However, the Rabin government's strong-arm tactics running 
counter to the most basic human rights and the failure of the 
enemy military and settlers to distinguish between fighter 
mujahidin and unarmed civilians prompted al-Qassam Battalions to 
adopt the principle of reciprocity, which has been sanctioned by 
temporal and divine laws alike. 
  The 'Afula and Hadera attacks that targeted concentrations 
of 
troops and settlers and hit some civilians were meant as a 
deterrent for the savage Zionist aggression on our people and a 
legitimate revenge for the blood of the martyrs of the hideous 
Hebron massacre. The actions were not a constant policy for 
al-Qassam Battalions, but an exception dictated by the enemy 
government. 
  Hamas is prepared to reconsider this exception, provided the 
enemy prime minister, his government, and army undertake to stop 
killing unarmed civilians of our people. Our objective is to 
guarantee the security and safety of our people and deter 
killers so that our people are not made easy targets for enemy 
soldiers and unrestrained settler gangs. Hamas will adhere to 
its policy of resistance as long as occupation remains. 
  Third: The quickened pace of jihad and heroic operations by 
our mujahidin in al-Qassam Battalions fits in with the 
Movement's game plan of resistance until occupation is routed 
and our sacred land liberated. 
  To cover the abysmal failure of the Rabin government to 
thwart our mujahidin's heroic operations, this government claims 
that the Hamas' actions are designed to undermine or abort the 
peace process, in an attempt to discredit Hamas in the eyes of 
the internationaal community. 
  We want to make an oft-repated statement that Hamas is not 
adverse to the principle of peace. However, the kind of peace 
offered by the enemy government is not peace; it is a 
consolidation of occupation and the iniquity to which our people 
are subjected. We are aware that the Oslo operation is one of 
humiliating surrender by the PLO leadership and capitulation to 
the Zionist and American terms and dictates. The operation 
carries the seeds of its own destruction; built on unjust and 
false foundations, it is destined to crash. 
  The right beginning lies in the following steps: 
  1. A full Zionist withdrawal from our Palestinian land and 
the dismantlement and removal of the settlements. 
  2. Free and fair general elections in the West Bank and Gaza 
Strip in which our peole would choose their representatives and 
leadership. 
  3. It is the elected leadership that reflects the hopes and 
ambitions of our people and decides on the next steps and the 
future of the Palestinian cause. 
  This is to shed light on Hamas' stands and to expose the 
lies 
and frivolities of the enemy prime minister. In the meantime, 
Hamas promises our people to sustain the jihad and martyrdom 
until the liberation of all of Palestine.

  [Text] The security forces this morning arrested about 50 
Hamas and Islamic Jihad activists from Gaza city, Rafah, and the 
Jabalyah refugee camp. The arrests follow an earlier sweep over 
the weekend, when more than 50 Hamas activists were also 
arrested. 
  [A report by military correspondent Yariv Ben-Yehuda on Tel 
Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 1000 GMT on 19 April adds: "It 
appears that 10 of those arrested are former deportees who 
returned to the Gaza Strip from southern Lebanon a few months 
ago. Tension in the strip is high since the arrests were 
carried out. Arab sources warned today that retaliatory terror 
attacks by Hamas are to be expected in the wake of the arrests 
which, according to them, seriously harmed the organization."] 
  Dr. Mahmud al-Zahhar, one of the Hamas deportees who 
returned 
from south Lebanon and acts as a spokesman for Hamas in the 
strip, denied the people arrested were senior activists. 
Speaking to reporter Mark Weiss, al-Zahhar also puts the number 
of those arrested at up to 200: 
  [Begin recording] [Al-Zahhar] The number, up to last night, 
ranged from 150 up to 200, and the people who were arrested are 
not activists. They were previously under detention or had 
already been sentenced. There is no reason for arresting any of 
them because they are well known as Islamic people. They have 
no participation in the process carried on in the area. 
  [Weiss] Do you think this is an Israeli crackdown following 
the 'Afula and Hadera bombings? 
  [Al-Zahhar] Do you think the people who were arrested in the 
Gaza Strip are involved in what happened in 'Afula and Hadera? 
  [Weiss] An interview was published in Jordan this morning 
from Musa Abu-Marzuq, the head of the Hamas politburo, and he 
said that Hamas may be willing to make peace with Israel if 
Israel pulls out of the occupied territories and dismantles the 
settlements. Do you see this as a change in Hamas policy? 
  [Al-Zahhar] I actually until now did not read the statements 
thoroughly, and after its discussion, I think after that I will 
be ready to give my personal idea. 
  [Weiss] Would you support peace with Israel if they withdrew 
from the territories and pulled out of the settlements? 
  [Al-Zahhar] This actually should be thoroughly studied, 
because about what we are going to negotiate? What will be the 
relation of the occupied territories, and what will be the 
contradiction between this implementation of policy with the 
Cairo and Oslo agreements? So, what type of peace Israel are 
going to give? If they are ready to give a genuine peace, a 
permanent peace, a justice peace, I think nobody will refuse.

  [Text] Amman--The Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) 
has completed recruiting a "board of executives" for a council 
that will take charge of the economic aspects of Palestinian 
self-rule in the occupied territories, PLO officials said Friday 
[15 April]. 
  Once formally installed in office, the "board of executives" 
will meet one of the key demands of international donors and the 
World Bank which have been pressing the PLO for "credible" 
Palestinian institutions to channel aid to support the 
Palestinian self-rule envisaged under the Sept. 13 accord 
between Israel and the PLO. 
  The executives will take direct charge of the nitty-gritty 
details of economy, such as customs and tariffs, taxation, 
social security, currency and monetary affairs as well as other 
aspects of financial administration of the occupied territories 
under the Palestinian Economic Council for Development and 
Reconstruction (PECDAR). 
  In essence, PECDAR is expected to be the Palestinian 
ministry 
of finance in the occupied territories pending final-status 
negotiations with Israel after the interim period as stipulated 
in the September accord. 
  The PLO officials said a PECDAR committee selected the 
executives, who will in effect be heads of departments, who had 
responded to advertisements in Jordan, Tunisia and the occupied 
territories. 
  Many of the interviews were conducted in Amman early this 
month, they said. 
  "The names of the successful candidates have been forwarded 
to the PLO leadership, and we are now awaiting approval from 
Tunis," where the PLO is headquartered, said a senior PLO 
official. But the official declined to characterise the 
recruits. 
  But other PLO sources said most of those recommended by the 
interview committee were of Palestinian origin who have had 
extensive experience in financial administration in the Gulf 
states and elsewhere. 
  "They more than meet the basic requirements and 
qualifications that enable them to be the key figures in the 
executive side of Palestinian nation-building," said one source. 
"Many of them have done [work] in the Gulf states, contributing 
to setting financial administrative structures there and made a 
success of it." 
  The list of recruits has to be approved by PLO Chairman 
Yasir 
'Arafat, PLO officials said. 
  The World Bank, which is directly in charge of channelling 
pledged international aid of up to $2.4 billion to help support 
Palestinian self-rule has been insisting that expertise, rather 
than political loyalties, guide the selection of key officials 
in the autonomy structure. 
  Mr. 'Arafat chairs PECDAR. His immediate deputies are Faruq 
Qaddumi, head of the PLO's Political Department and the de facto 
foreign minister of Palestine and Muhammad Zuhdi al-Nashashibi, 
head of the Economic Department of the PLO. 
  Ahmad Quray' a PLO economic strategist and one of the key 
figures in the secret Oslo negotiations that led the autonomy 
accord, and Sari Nusaybah, a university professor from the 
occupied West Bank, are the senior-most executives of the 
13-member council. 
  Several other members who are professional economists have 
complained that 'Arafat loyalists rather than people with 
expertise dominate the council. Some of the critics have 
announced their suspension of membership in the council, but PLO 
officials said they had not submitted formal resignations. 
  Among them are Dr. Yusuf Sayigh, a Beirut-based Palestinian 
economist who led the Palestinian side to multilateral talks on 
economic cooperation. 
  Samir 'Abdallah, a noted professor of economics from a West 
Bank university and member of the multilateral group, has also 
been critical of the way the PLO leadership was handling its 
economic approach and the overall peace negotiations with Israel. 
  The council is expected to meet soon in Tunisia to discuss 
practical measures to coordinate with the World Bank to channel 
aid to the self-rule areas, the PLO officials said. 
  That meeting will be followed by the first meeting of the 
"board of executives" of PECDAR. The board will work under the 
direct supervision of PECDAR in implementing the decisions and 
policies of the council," said the PLO official. 
  Jawad Naji, a member of the council and head of the PLO's 
economic department in Amman, said in a recent interview that 
the council estimates that it needs up to $400 million in the 
first year. 
  The donors and the World Bank, in a meeting held in Paris in 
January, decided to allocate up to $160 million to the council. 
  Dr. Naji noted that the allocation falls short of PLO 
estimates, but said the organisation hoped to secure further 
funds once self-rule is in place. 
  "We have to start from scratch in the occupied territories," 
Dr. Naji said, referring to the almost total absence of 
self-supporting economic structure in the West Bank and the Gaza 
Strip.

  [Text] Marrakech, Apr. 15 (MAP) -- The U.S. Vice President 
Al Gore held a meeting here Thursday [April 14] afternoon with 
heads of Arab delegations to the GATT ministerial conference 
currently held in Marrakech. Al Gore discussed with his 
interlocutors the issue of the Arab boycott of Israel saying the 
lifting of the boycott will give a new momentum to the Middle 
East process in general and to economic cooperation in the 
region in particular, reliable sources said. 
  The US official told MAP at the end of the meeting that 
talks 
mainly focused on the Middle East peace process. `This meeting 
was very positive and I appreciated this opportunity', the US 
Vice President said. 
  Tunisian Foreign Minister Habib Ben Yahya who took part in 
the meeting on his part told MAP that the US official explained 
to the heads of Arab delegations the stand of the United States 
regarding the peace process. As to the Arab boycott of Israel, 
Ben Yahya said a decision on the matter falls within the Arab 
League competence and does not arise at the level of Arab states 
taken separately. It is a collective decision made in the Arab 
League context, the Tunisian official said adding that this 
issue is not only economic but has also a political dimension. 
The Arab world, he went on, is open to dialog and contributes 
to the peace process, Ben Yahya said expressing hope to see the 
peace process reach positive results and usher in a new regional 
order. 
  Eleven Arab countries are participating in the Marrakech 
conference namely Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait, 
Qatar, Mauritania, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia and the United 
Arab Emirates.

  [Text] Marrakech, Apr. 15 (MAP) -- The GATT ministerial 
conference to wind up this Friday in Marrakech Thursday 
unanimously adopted the decision on the creation of the World 
Trade Organization (WTO). The conference also adopted decisions 
relative to trade and environment and the debts stemming from 
the implementation of the GATT accords. 
  This Friday, head of the delegations attending the 
conference 
are to sign five implements of the Uruguay Round, namely the 
final act of the round, the accord setting up the WTO, the 
accord on public projects, the accord on dairy produce and the 
accord on beef. 
  GATT Information Director David Woods said at a press 
briefing here Thursday the signing ceremony will be held in the 
afternoon and will be preceded by a meeting of the trade 
negotiations committee which is to adopt the declaration of 
Marrakech and ministerial decisions. 
  On the accord setting up the WTO, Woods said some countries 
will sign the accord without conditions while others will do it 
under the reservation of its ratification by their parliaments. 
He explained the non signing of this accord will have no legal 
incidence since all the countries signatory of the Uruguay Round 
final act committed to submit the accord for approval to the 
[words indistinct] competent authorities. 
  The other three accords, which are partially new, will be 
signed by some countries and the accord on public projects will 
be signed by 22 countries including those of the European Union 
under the reservation of ratification. 
  The accord on dairy products which dates back to the Tokyo 
negotiations and which was not renegotiated by the Uruguay Round 
will be signed by seven or eight entities, only, including the 
European Union on behalf of its member counories, Woods said 
adding the same is true for the accord on beef. Another 
implement, namely the accord on civil aircraft of 1979 will be 
presented for signing by GATT members, woods said.

<F P=106> ["Full text" of declaration adopted by GATT ministers in </F>
Marrakech, Morocco on 15 April] 
  [Text] Marrakech, Morocco, April 15 KYODO -- Marrakech 
Declaration of 15 April 1994: 
  Ministers representing the 124 governments and the European 
communities participating in the Uruguay Round of multilateral 
trade negotiations, on the occasion of the final session of the 
trade negotiations committee at ministerial level held at 
Marrakech, Morocco from 12 to 15 April 1994, 
  Recalling the ministerial declaration adopted at Punta del 
Este, Uruguay on 20 September 1986 to launch the Uruguay Round 
of multilateral trade negotiations, 
  Recalling the progress achieved at the ministerial meetings 
held at Montreal, Canada and Brussels, Belgium in December of 
1988 and 1990 respectively, 
  Noting that the negotiations were substantially concluded on 
15 December 1993, 
  Determined to build upon the success of the Uruguay Round 
through the participation of their economies in the world 
trading system, based upon open, market-oriented policies and 
the commitments set out in the Uruguay Round agreements and 
decisions, 
  Have today adopted the following declaration 
  1. Ministers salute the historic achievement represented by 
the conclusion of the round, which they believe will strengthen 
the world economy and lead to more trade, investment, employment 
and income growth throughout the world. In particular, they 
welcome 
  -- The stronger and clearer legal framework they have 
adopted 
for the conduct of international trade, including a more 
effective and reliable dispute settlement mechanism, 
  -- The global reduction by 40 percent of tariffs and wider 
market-opening agreements on goods, and the increased 
predictability and security represented by a major expansion in 
the scope of tariff commitments, and 
  -- The establishment of a multilateral framework of 
disciplines for trade in services and for the protection of 
trade-related intellectual property rights, as well as the 
reinforced multilateral trade provisions in agriculture and in 
textiles and clothing. 
  2. Ministers affirm that the establishment of the World 
Trade Organization (WTO) ushers in a new era of global economic 
cooperation, reflecting the widespread desire to operate in a 
fairer and more open multilateral trading system for the benefit 
and welfare of their peoples. Ministers believe that the trade 
liberalization and strengthened rules achieved in the Uruguay 
Round will lead to a progressively open world trading 
environment, and express their determination to resist 
protectionist pressures of all kinds. Ministers undertake, with 
immediate effect and until the entry into force of the wto, not 
to take any trade measures that would undermine or adversely 
affect the results of the Uruguay Round negotiations or their 
implementation. 
  3. Ministers confirm their resolution to strive for greater 
global coherence of policies in the fields of trade, money and 
finance, including cooperation between the WTO, the IMF and the 
World Bank for that purpose. 
  4. Ministers welcome the fact that participation in the 
Uruguay Round was considerably wider than in any previous 
multilateral trade negotiation and, in particular, that 
developing countries played a notably active role in it. This 
has marked a historic step toward a more balanced and integrated 
global trade partnership. Ministers note that during the period 
these negotiations were underway significant measures of 
economic reform and autonomous trade liberalization were 
implemented in many developing countries and formerly centrally 
planned economies. 
  5. Ministers recall that the results of the negotiations 
embody provisions conferring differential and more favorable 
treatment for developing economies, including special attention 
to the particular situation of least-developed countries. 
Ministers underscore the importance of these provisions for the 
least-developed countries, and declare their intention to 
continue to assist and facilitate the expansion of their trade 
and investment opportunities. They agree to keep under regular 
review by the ministerial conference and the appropriate organs 
of the WTO the impact of the results of the round on the 
least-developed countries as well as on the net-food- importing 
developing countries, with a view to fostering positive measures 
to enable them to achieve their development objectives. 
Ministers recognize the need for strengthening the capability of 
GATT and the WTO to provide increased technical assistance in 
their areas of competence, and in particular to substantially 
expand its provision to the least-developed countries. 
  6. Ministers declare that their signature of the "Final Act 
Embodying the Results of the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade 
Negotiations" and their adoption of associated ministerial 
decisions initiates the transition from GATT to the WTO. They 
have in particular established a preparatory committee to lay 
the ground for the entry into force of the WTO agreement and 
commit themselves to seek to complete all steps necessary to 
ratify the WTO agreement so that it can enter into force by 1 
January 1995 or as early as possible thereafter. Ministers have 
furthermore adopted a decision on trade and environment. 
  7. Ministers express their sincere gratitude to His Majesty 
King Hassan II for his personal contribution to the success of 
this ministerial meeting, and to his government and the people 
of Morocco for their warm hospitality and excellent organization 
they have provided. The fact that this final ministerial 
meeting of the Uruguay Round has been held at Marrakech is an 
additional manifestation of Morocco's commitment to an open 
world trading system and to its fullest integration to the 
global economy. 
  8. With the adoption and signature of the final act and the 
opening for acceptance of the WTO agreement, ministers declare 
the work of the trade negotiations committee to be complete and 
the Uruguay Round formally concluded.

<F P=106> ["Full text" of speech by King Hassan II at the royal palace </F>
in Marrakech, Morocco on 15 April--all quotation marks as 
received] 
  [Text] Ministerial conference Marrakech, Apr. 16 (MAP) -- 
King Hassan II, flanked by Crown Prince Sidi Mohammed, hosted 
Friday [April 15] at the royal palace here a banquet in honor of 
participants in the GATT ministerial conference held in 
Marrakech this April 12-15. 
  Here is the full text of the royal speech delivered before 
delegations of over 124 countries: "Mr. Chairman, honorable 
premiers, honorable ministers, Mr. Director General, honorable 
delegates, excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, 
  We, and the world at large with us, have just crossed a 
watershed, one of those decisive moments in history in which 
mankind unfailingly taps its wellspring of energy and 
psychological strength to launch a new grand design, conjure up 
hope of a brighter future and dispel the specter of despondency 
or disheartenment. 
  The atmosphere of this moment we are sharing calls to mind 
the unforgettable memory of the Anfa conference that took place 
in Casablanca in 1943, at which we had the privilege of 
accompanying his majesty our father, may God have him in his 
mercy. The purpose of the conference, attended notably by 
President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill, was to prepare 
the allied disembarkation in Europe, but it marked the beginning 
not only of the allies' long march to victory but also of the 
far-reaching movement of liberation of the people still under 
colonial rule. 
  Those men, whose action and abnegation restored freedom and 
democracy in the world, knew that the cessation of hostilities 
was not the same thing as peace, and that as the same causes 
will produce the same effects, they would be unable to establish 
enduring peace except in a setting favorable to lasting economic 
growth. The lessons they drew from the 1930s and in particular 
from the impact of protectionism on world-wide economic activity 
and security decisively shaped the drafting of the San Francisco 
Charter and the Bretton Woods Agreements. The aborted 
International Trade Organization would have rounded off the 
institutional framework for the multilateral management of the 
world economy, but the vagaries of politics dashed the hopes of 
those architects of the peacetime world. 
  Thus, we have had to wait almost half-a-century in order at 
last to manage to bring the privileges of power within the sway 
of law. 
  By bringing into being the world trade organization today, 
we 
are enshrining the rule of law in international economic and 
trade relations, thus setting universal rules and disciplines 
over the temptations of unilateralism and the law of the jungle. 
This collective profession of faith actually marks the end of 
the colonial pact and embodies genuine interdependence. 
Regardless of the size of our economies, from now on we shall 
all enjoy the same rights and be subject to the same 
obligations. we share the same goals and must meet the same 
challenges: Tackling the scourge of unemployment, redressing 
the problem of social exclusion, or finding appropriate ways of 
responding to our environmental or other concerns. 
  The fact that the trade negotiations that we have just 
solemnly concluded were launched in Punta del Este and ended in 
Marrakech, in other words, in two countries of the south, must 
be seen as heralding a new age in which the antagonisms between 
the industrialized and developing countries will fade away. The 
alliances forged during these negotiations between partners 
having different levels of development show that this process is 
now under way. It is up to us to deepen it and strengthen it. 
  The rise in the number of contracting parties, which lends a 
universal dimension to the agreements just signed, together with 
the aftermath of the fall of the Berlin wall, mark the end of 
the ideological cleavages that have hampered the smooth 
development of the world economy. Henceforth, four fifths of 
the world's population live in market economies and over a 
hundred countries have embarked on the privatization of 
public-sector enterprises. 
  Lastly, the fact that the Marrakech meeting coincides with 
the implementation of the agreements between the PLO and Israel 
is a good omen. Those agreements, enabling the Palestinian flag 
to fly over part of its territory, are the beginning of a 
process that will finally extinguish the oldest hotbed in the 
world. 
  All of this means that the world of tomorrow can scarcely 
resemble the one in which we have lived until today. Changing 
production systems and consumption patterns, the emergence of 
new multimedia technologies and the rapid growth of related 
services will further speed up the globalization of markets for 
goods, services and capital. 
  This globalization could herald greater inequalities among 
countries and aggravate the symptoms of social exclusion which 
may be observed in the rich as the less prosperous countries. 
It therefore calls for the creation and use of new machinery of 
collective solidarity as well as a new approach to economic and 
social development problems. The reason why many developing 
countries have courageously restructured their economies in 
order to integrate them better into the international economy is 
that they are convinced of the virtues of financial discipline 
and of the need to cushion the ensuing transitional social cost. 
This cost requires a counterpart from the developed countries 
in the form of corresponding adjustments favoring markets access 
and transparent conditions of fair competition, in particular 
through greater monetary stability. 
  The special situation of Africa deserves a particular 
attention. Morocco, a Muslim, Arab and African country, was a 
pioneer of emancipation movements in Africa and it is fully 
aware of the challenges to be faced. We must assess the 
situation with lucidity and admit that the results of forty 
years of independence are mixed. Of course mistakes have been 
made, successes have been achieved here and there, but no one 
can ignore the latent risks of a situation in which the 
imbalance in levels of development is so sharp. We must not 
misjudge the shape of the future nor the danger of excluding a 
whole continent from the global economy. After all the measures 
taken to save Africa, we should ask ourselves if the time is not 
ripe for a veritable Marshall plan to alleviate the poverty and 
suffering of millions of people." 
  "Mr. Chairman, honorable premiers, honorable ministers, Mr. 
Director General, honorable delegates, excellencies, ladies, and 
gentlemen, 
  When we invited you to consider signing the final act of the 
Uruguay round in Marrakech, an invitation which you did us the 
honor and pleasure of accepting, we were motivated by a number 
of important considerations. 
  To cite only some of them, for many centuries Marrakech has 
been a crossroads of trade and civilization between Africa and 
Europe and between the latter and the Arab world. 
  It was in Marrakech, in 1788, that the exchange of letters 
between Sultan Sidi Mohammed Ben 'Abdellah and George Washington 
led to the Kingdom of Morocco being the first nation to 
recognize the independence of the United States of America. 
These texts are still in force and deal with peace, friendship, 
and freedom of navigation and trade. 
  It was also in Marrakech, in 1856, that an exchange of 
diplomatic instruments took place between Queen Victoria and 
Sultan Moulay Abderrahmane. The trade agreement which was the 
subject of this exchange set up the frame for the majority of 
treaties of the time. Its modernity and conformity with the 
rules and disciplines we have just adopted today would surprise 
many people: The most-favored nation clause was used in it for 
the first time. 
  Thus it is in one of the oldest trading nations in the world 
that the most complex and most important trade negotiations in 
history have been concluded. 
  By putting its signature beside those of the contracting 
parties present here, the Kingdom of Morocco is reaffirming a 
tradition of free trade from which it never swerved from its 
origin through the last world war. 
  This tradition is not simply confined to trade, but embraces 
the wider area of the options facing society. In adopting 
pluralism and prohibiting a single-party regime in its first 
constitution proclaimed upon independence, Morocco was fully 
aware of the fact that a truly liberal economic policy must 
first of all be based on the values of democracy, and of 
political and trade union pluralism. 
  Its steadfast determination to promote an economic system 
which gives pride of place to private initiative and the 
stimulus of equitable competition has allowed Morocco to follow 
the path of sustainable growth, remedy structural imbalances and 
attract foreign investment. 
  The experience we have gained over the centuries has allowed 
us to establish our vocation as a land of reflection, courage 
and innovation and has taught us the virtues of humility and the 
essential need for lucidity. 
  This leads us to conclude that, although the Marrakech 
agreements constitute a cornerstone of our common structure, 
they cannot be considered as an end in themselves. 
  These agreements should rather give us food for thought and 
spur our creative imagination for building a new international 
order. 
  We believe that the conditions have just been provided for a 
collective and calm reflection on the functioning of the global 
economy in the next century. 
  Trade is only one element in a trilogy in which monetary and 
financial issues are interdependent. The impact of the monetary 
policies followed by the major actors in the international 
economy often leads to counterproductive effects which 
jeopardize what has been achieved by our restructuring efforts. 
  In this respect, we propose studying with your respective 
heads of state the possibility of establishing an 
intergovernmental group to study the new mechanisms for 
international economic negotiations with a view to: 
  -- improved coordination of action by the IMF, the IBRD 
[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development] and the 
WTO [World Trade Organization] 
  -- a greater contribution by countries of the south to 
concerted implementation of a strategy to give the global 
economy a new impetus so as to come up with the appropriate 
response to the scourge of the twenty first century, which will 
be unemployment. 
  "Mr. Chairman, honorable premiers, honorable ministers, Mr. 
Director General, honorable delegates, excellencies, ladies and 
gentlemen, 
  We give thanks to God for having allowed our meeting to be 
one of those which, in contributing to international 
cooperation, widen its scope, strengthen its bases and 
consolidate its rules. The Marrakech charter which concludes 
this meeting is a further valuable contribution to the series of 
international conventions on which our world of today has based 
its unity, turning away from the causes of strife and enmity to 
become part of the cycle of relations promoting the reign of 
peace and understanding. 
  When Morocco expresses the pride it takes in having hosted 
the meeting, it simply is rightfully expressing its aspirations 
and its choice to always remain open onto the world and adhere 
to the principles of international cooperation. 
  We should all therefore welcome the gigantic step forward 
towards broader and more intensive international cooperation, 
this progress towards the international solidarity which we hope 
will be the hallmark of the next century. And more than any 
other promise, it is the confirmation of this solidarity that we 
hope for from the proposed new world order."

  [Text] Marrakech, Apr.16 (MAP) -- Moroccan Privatization 
Minister Abderrahmane Saidi expounded to ministers attending the 
GATT ministerial conference which wound up Friday the 
privatization policy followed by the Moroccan Government. 
  At separate meetings he held with ministers from several 
countries, the minister said the privatization of state-owned 
enterprises associates both Moroccan and foreign capital. He 
also gave explanations on procedures of the transfer operations. 
  With the officials from Italy, Switzerland, Austria, Guinea 
Bissau, Canada, Congo, and Paraguay, talks covered means to 
attract foreign investors to the ongoing privatization program 
and it was also agreed to hold information meetings to this end. 
  A Moroccan governmental delegation led by Prime Minister 
Mohamed Karim Lamrani held a work session with Japanese foreign 
minister. The meeting looked into prospects of cooperation in 
the banking sector, as well as in energy, mining, industry, 
transports and fisheries. Moroccan-Japanese talks also examined 
the possibility of Japanese investments in Moroccan industrial 
sectors. 
  On his part, Minister of Sea Fisheries and Merchant Navy 
Mustapha Sahel had intense talks with several delegations to the 
meeting. He thus met Mauritanian minister of trade, handicraft 
and tourism, Spanish secretary of state of sea fisheries, 
Japanese vice-minister of agriculture, forests, and fisheries, 
American under-secretary of state for trade and Brazilian 
foreign minister. 
  The minister also took part, together with Premier Mohamed 
Karim Lamrani and other cabinet members, in a work session with 
Japanese Foreign Minister Hata. The meeting examined 
development of Moroccan-Japanese cooperation in fisheries. In 
this connection, a work session on expansion works and 
construction of ports in northern Morocco gathered Moroccan 
ministers of public works and vocational and executives training 
and of economy boosting and Romanian minister of external trade. 
  On his part, Minister of Trade and Industry Driss Jettou 
received South African minister of finance, trade, and industry 
who was accompanied by a special representative of the African 
National Congress. The African officials agreed to organize 
business trips for delegations of the two countries. Jettou 
then conferred with Malaysian minister of external trade and 
industry on economic and industrial relations between the two 
countries. The Malaysian official invited the Moroccan side to 
take part in the international fair to be hosted by her country 
next May. 
  As part of the intensive side meetings held by the Moroccan 
delegation, Moroccan Minister of External Trade, Foreign 
Investment and Handicraft Mourad Cherif received Chinese 
vice-minister of external trade and economic cooperation. 
  Moroccan-Thai cooperation was covered in a meeting between 
Minister in Charge of Economic Boosting Omar Kabbaj and Thai 
[word indistinct] of Trade Uthai Pinchaichon. The two sides 
agreed on the principle to set up a joint commission and to 
trade expertise in economic policy. 
  Minister of Agriculture Abdelaziz Mezian also received 
Chinese minister of external trade and economic cooperation with 
whom he reviewed cooperation prospects offered to the two 
countries where agriculture is a vital sector. 
  With Salvadorian minister of agriculture and fisheries, the 
Moroccan minister surveyed the policy followed by the two 
countries to diversify their produce and to develop exports of 
fresh products. In this regard, it was agreed to exchange 
expertise, mainly in matters of marketing techniques.

  [Text] Marrakech, Apr. 16 (MAP) -- Chairman of the GATT 
conference Sergio Enrique Bonilla and GATT director general 
Peter Sutherland hailed here Friday [15 April] the conclusion of 
the Uruguay Round. 
  During a joint press conference, Bonilla and Sutherland 
underlined that the signature of the Uruguay Round final act in 
Marrakech is a historic step to world economic integration and 
towards the establishment of the international multilateral 
trading system. 
  Sutherland, who expressed conviction that the projected 
world 
trade organization will see the light next January 1st as 
initially scheduled, said the commitments expressed by every 
member country in the Uruguay final act are categorical. 
  To a question on the concerns of some developing countries 
that their economies will be negatively impacted by the new 
international trading system, the GATT director general 
underlined that the efficient contribution of developing 
countries to the conclusion of the Uruguay round is evidence to 
their trust in the viability of the multilateral system. 
  As to the situation of African countries, particularly 
sub-Saharan ones, Sutherland stressed that every individual 
country will draw benefits from the multilateral system, 
specifying that the African representatives who took the floor 
during the Marrakech conference underlined the paramount 
importance of the GATT accord for their respective economies. 
  Tackling the pending issues, the GATT director general 
explained that negotiations will be continued on these 
questions, particularly those related to financial services, the 
intellectual property and the audiovisual.

<F P=106> ["Text" of interview with Abdellatif Filali, Moroccan </F>
minister of state for foreign affairs and cooperation, by an 
unidentified correspondent in Marrakech on 16 April -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] In a statement to Moroccan television today 
Abdellatif Filali, the minister of state for foreign affairs and 
cooperation, said that Morocco's stance vis-a-vis the 
developments on the Saharan issue enjoyed international support. 
He also said that the GATT conference opened new doors to 
Morocco to extend the scope of its cooperation with various 
developed countries. Here is the text of the interview. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Abdellatif Filali, minister of state for 
foreign affairs and cooperation: The GATT conference ended here 
in Marrakech yesterday. You signed the agreement marking the 
birth of the international trade organization on behalf of the 
Moroccan delegation. First of all, what is your assessment of 
the results of the conference? 
  [Filali] As stated by his majesty in his speech yesterday, I 
believe that this was a very important international event. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] Mentioning the European Union [EU], how do 
you envision future relations between Morocco and the EU in the 
trade and, particularly, the agricultural spheres? 
  [Filali] On this particular point I would like to remind the 
Moroccan public, particularly those who have a specific 
profession in this field or direct trade with European markets, 
that within the scope of GATT there is an essential point, 
namely Point 24 in the GATT agreement which stresses that the 
regional agreements that hitherto exist will remain intact. By 
that I mean that Morocco's privileges with the European 
Community will not change. Therefore, let all Moroccans who 
have close and well-established relations with Europe be rest 
assured that there will be no change in that sphere. [passage 
omitted]. 
  [Correspondent] We shall set aside the GATT conference and 
Moroccan-European relations and move to another question 
concerning our national issue. What is the government's view 
regarding the recent resolution passed by the UN Security 
Council, Resolution 907? 
  [Filali] I believe that it is necessary to discuss 
Resolution 
809 before dealing with Resolution 907. In Resolution 809, the 
Security Council gave the UN secretary general a new prerogative 
in an attempt to bring about an agreement between the two sides 
with regards to the criteria and implementation. The 
negotiations were very tough, but finally we reached a positive 
result with the secretary general and accepted his proposals 
regarding the criteria and implementation. The Moroccan 
agreement took place this year. Since then, the secretary 
general personally, or his special envoy in the region, have 
been repeatedly trying to convince the other side of the need to 
get their endorsement of his proposal, namely compromise 
solutions regarding the criteria and their implementation. 
However, as stated in the secretary general's report, so far 
Morocco has provided every facility in its dealings with the 
secretary general and the general secretariat regarding the 
proposal, but there are pending problems. By that I mean the 
other side has so far not given a clear reply concerning the 
secretary general's proposal. 
  Therefore, it is farcical when we hear many mercenaries 
abroad saying that Morocco is responsible for the status quo; 
and it is necessary that the Moroccan and also international 
public opinion should be aware that the true culprit, who is 
mentioned in Resolution 907, is the Polisario [Popular Front for 
the Liberation of Saquia El Hamra and Rio de Oro]. In fact, 
this resolution does not concern us greatly because we have 
given our approval to the secretary general's reconciliation 
proposal this year. Therefore, when the Security Council says 
in this resolution that the voter identification commission is 
now committed to register all the people in the referendum 
lists, it means that from now until 30 June the Polisario has to 
give its final reply. [passage omitted] 
  I believe that our stance is correct and enjoys official and 
sensible international support. [passage omitted] 
Responsibility for what is taking place in the region lies with 
Polisario's stance and those who support its stance. This is 
what can be said now. I believe that our public opinion in 
Morocco is not confused about that because Morocco's position is 
getting stronger daily. Everyone believes that what is taking 
place in the international field is indicative that Polisario's 
stances and statements have lost credibility. It is empty talk. 
[passage omitted]

  [Text] Goat, Apr. 16 (MAP) -- Morocco and Russia concluded 
two accords providing for the creation of an intergovernmental 
commission for economic, scientific and technical cooperation 
and for a new frame of trade exchanges. 
  Under the first accord, a joint intergovernmental commission 
is to be set up to examine issues linked to bilateral 
cooperation, explore ways to develop and promote economic, 
scientific and technical relations and extend assistance to the 
two countries' enterprises concerned. 
  The renewable five year accord stipulates that the 
commission 
will meet al least once a year alternately in Rabat and Moscow. 
  The second accord sets a new frame governing trade exchanges 
between the two countries with a view to strengthening economic 
and trade relations between the two sides. In 1992, 
Moroccan-Russian trade exchanges amounted to 876 million dirhams 
and are expected to increase under the accord. 
  The two accords were initialled on the Russian side by 
Minister of Foreign Economic Relations Oleg Davydov and on the 
Moroccan side by Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and 
Cooperation Taib Fassi Fihri and Minister of External Trade, 
Foreign Investments and Handicraft Mourad Cherif.

  [Text] Khartoum, 18 Apr (SUNA) -- The president of the 
Republic, Lieutenant General 'Umar al-Bashir, has said in a 
statement to the AL-MULTAQA magazine that the government had 
earlier stopped its contacts with the American ambassador 
because of its indignation over his hostile statements. These 
came at a time when both sides, the Government of Sudan and the 
American Government, had agreed to resume their dialogue on the 
basis of frankness. 
  It is worth, mentioning that some news agencies had quoted 
the presidents statement imprecisely.

  [Text] The deputy foreign minister of Sudan met with his 
Iranian counterpart in Tehran yesterday. During this meeting, 
the two sides called for the expansion of bilateral relations. 
  The Sudanese deputy foreign minister commented on the 
limitations by the Saudi Government on the quota of pilgrims to 
Mecca and on the need to examine problems faced by the world of 
Islam during the Hajj congress, and emphasized the significance 
of the religious and political aspect of the Hajj pilgrimage. 
The Sudanese deputy foreign minister stated: When the Saudis 
say that the quota for pilgrims from Islamic countries has been 
set by the Islamic Conference Organization, then this 
organization should also make all the decisions concerning the 
Hajj pilgrimage as well.

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Excerpt] Things appear to be going from bad to worse for 
people in rebel-controlled areas of southern Sudan. Since the 
Khartoum government launched the dry season offensive, thousands 
of civilians have been forced to flee the war zone for 
neighboring countries. Most of them ended up in Uganda and the 
SPLA [Sudanese People's Liberation Army] rebel movement appears 
to be on the retreat in the face of Sudanese Air Force bombing 
raids. The rebels claim that the National Islamic Front, NIF, 
is behind the recruitment of fresh troops to take part in some 
kind of holy war. Well, SPLA leader, John Garang, has just 
attended the seventh Pan-Africanist Congress which was held in 
Kampala, and William Wanendeya put it to him that things were 
going badly for his movement. 
  [Begin recording] [Garang] We are doing very well. We are a 
guerilla movement and we employ a multiplicity of tactics. If 
we don't need to defend ground, why defend it. Sometimes, the 
aim is to inflict as many casualties on the enemy as possible 
and I tell you the NIF, mujahedin, are dying like flies. So we 
are succeeding. It is true that the civil population is bearing 
the brunt of the NIF offensive because they are being bombed. 
As for the soldiers, they are in their trenches and foxholes 
but the civil population has no foxholes and no bunkers. That 
is the only tragedy but with respect to the war proper, the SPLA 
is invincible. 
  [Wanendeya] You've suggested that one of the problems is 
that 
the SPLA does not have many arms, does not have many lorries to 
transport its soldiers around. Now, recently there was the 
story that the SPLA was buying guns through Israel and the plane 
was stranded in Cyprus. Do you have any comments to make on 
this issue. Was this plane carrying arms for the SPLA? 
  [Garang] We wish it was. We never knew anything about the 
plane. The plane does not belong to us, if it is there at all. 
So, we have no knowledge of it. We only heard it over the BBC 
that there was a plane that was in Cyprus and the arms were 
intended for the SPLA. No arms were intended for us and you can 
take it from me. Because if anybody should know, I should. 
  [Wanendeya] What about this story that I have heard that you 
are receiving Stinger missiles from the American Government to 
shoot down antennae, high altitude antennae bombers. 
  [Garang] There is no truth whatsoever. I think the NIF is 
making these things up in order to mobilize resources from the 
fundamentalist Islamic world. 
  [Wanendeya] If I could ask you on a topic unrelated; where 
were you born in southern Sudan and how did you grow up? 
  [Garang] I was born in Bordie Street, Bokor, (Wanglor) 
village. I don't know exactly when, but I think it is 1945. 
What else do you want to know? 
  [Wanendeya] What did your parents do and what kind of early 
life did you live? 
  [Garang] My parents were peasants -- cattle-rearers and 
cultivators just like any other southern Sudanese family. I 
lived until I was eight years at home, when I went to school.

<F P=106> [Report on "guideline address" by President Liamine Zeroual </F>
to the Council of Ministers on 18 April in Algiers--recorded] 
  [Text] At the presidency of the Republic, head of state 
Liamine Zeroual today chaired the first meeting of the Council 
of Ministers since the appointment of the new prime minister, 
Mr. Mokdad Sifi. It should be mentioned that Mr. Sifi's 
government consists of 29 ministers, and among its priorities 
are the consolidation of the state institutions, reviving the 
national economy, and promoting national solidarity. Concerning 
the issues tabled at the meeting of the Council of Ministers 
today, the official spokesman for the presidency, Mr. Mihoub, 
said the following: 
  On the occasion of this first meeting with the government 
chaired by Mr. Mokdad Sifi, the head of state, made the 
following guideline address: 
  In the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. On the 
occasion of this meeting of the Council of Ministers, I cannot, 
to begin with, but greet and express my personal gratitude to 
Mr. Redha Malek, the previous prime minister, and all the 
members of his team for their commitment and loyalty in serving 
our country. In addressing you, ministers, I congratulate you 
for your selection, and I express to you and the prime minister 
my sincerest wishes of success in the mission entrusted to you. 
  The appointment of your government comes within the 
framework 
of establishing the institutions that will be in charge of the 
realization of the objectives of the transitional stage, the 
objectives mentioned by the platform agreed by the national 
conference. In this framework come all the activities already 
started in the recent weeks, as well as the directives I gave at 
the two previous meetings of the Council of Ministers, which I 
recall today. I have already had the occasion to define the 
problems that were the cause of the crisis faced by our country. 
In addition to the known political causes and the deterioration 
of the foreign monetary resources, there was a laissez-faire in 
management and lack of clarity of objectives. 
  Such deviations faciliated the emergence of calamities in 
the 
apparatus of the state, such as bureaucracy, despotism, 
injustice, and nepotism. Such deviations also reduced contact 
between officials and permitted the absence of officials in the 
field of work, as well as the marginalization and instability of 
the cadres. The break with past practices, which remain our 
basic objective, lies in eliminating these manifestations and 
practices, and this can be brought about only with the carrying 
out of a radical change in the state's structures which, in the 
future, must obey new rules. 
  Effectively, the work we are doing to bring about national 
reconciliation and definitively uproot terrorism and violence 
from our society must be necessarily accompanied by the 
strengthening of the state's institutions, the rehabilitation of 
the civil service, and the setting up of sound relations between 
the citizens and the administration, which must be in their 
service. In this respect, the mobilization of officials at all 
levels is an urgent necessity to guarantee the follow-up and the 
realization of decisions, and to perform the job of control, and 
therefore restore full credibility to the public institutions. 
In this respect, there must be reforms that give a fresh breath 
to the civil service sector. 
  The credibility of the public institutions also requires 
them 
to lead by example in reducing the state's expenditure and 
practicing austerity. This credibility also requires combating 
bribery, speculation, and smuggling with seriousness and 
determination. The law must be implemented strictly within the 
framework of the respect of individual and collective liberties. 
  In the field of communication, the government has got to 
exert a considerable effort. The media, which will receive a 
lot of attention, should be mobilized so as to carry out its 
fundamental role, which consists in serving the higher interests 
of the citizens and conveying their concerns to the state. 
  The media, whose variety is considered as one of the gains 
of 
democracy, should play its role in consolidating this 
achievement and defending the higher interests of the homeland, 
whatever source is harming them. Freedom of expression means 
the responsible transmitting of sincere information away from 
any deceptions and conspiracies. 
  It is also our duty to devote a bigger share of attention to 
promote our national culture. It is indisputable that our 
deep-rooted cultural heritage is considered a property of the 
Algerians and a strong factor in the unity and progress of our 
people. 
  A comprehensive program for our national culture must be set 
up to recover the true position of this sector in our society. 
The success of all these tasks demands the utmost care in 
choosing officials at all levels of the state apparatus. As you 
know, the state has concluded an agreement with the IMF. We 
will be vigilant in implementing this agreement in our concern 
that it should bring benefits to citizens and in reviving the 
national economy. 
  Within this framework I accord every importance to the 
temporary burdens ensuing from this agreement will be borne 
equitably by all strata of society and to implementing social 
protection programs that are accompanied by effective 
implementation. 
  The national solidarity, which constitutes a tradition and 
is 
one of the demands of our people, must be reinforced more and 
more particularly for the benefit of the most deprived groups. 
Within the same context, some sectors of the national economy 
that I have previously touched upon must receive special care 
and be given priority in the government's efforts. This matter 
is related to the hydrocarbons, housing and agriculture sectors, 
small and medium enterprises, and trade. These priorities will 
allow the exploitation of the positive effects of the agreement 
with the IMF to activate the national economic apparatus, meet 
the requirements of the citizens, and create new jobs. 
  We must also work to mobilize as many as possible of the 
country's resources, including the tourism sector, which will 
play a considerable role in developing the national economic 
wealth. 
  Furthermore, the implementation of the agreement with the 
IMF comes within the framework of a structural reform process in 
connection with the national economy. This process should be 
continued and consolidated, especially in the sphere of 
industrial restructuring, and this sector should be opened up to 
partnership. 
  It is obvious that all these operations, which require the 
government's utmost attention, will be better implemented by 
delegating them to the local authorities. The state is also 
represented by the wali, the head of the district, and the head 
of the municipal executive body. 
  Within this framework we should rehabilitate the local 
communities, whose contribution to a coherent development of the 
country is indisputable. These tasks will achieve better 
success if they are carried out within the framework of an 
intensive consultation with social partners. As far as this is 
concerned, the creation of the National Social and Economic 
Council, which should be initiated as soon as possible, will 
contribute to promoting consultation between the state and its 
social partners. 
  Finally, this program will receive more popular support if 
it 
is effectively explained to show clearly that this program 
requires temporary sacrifices, and that its aim, in the final 
assessment, is to revive national development and to produce 
opportunity for the creative resources, particularly the youth, 
to whom the horizons of the future will be opened, and toward 
which they can legitimately aspire to. 
  Those are some of the directives your government program 
will 
focus on. The program should be prepared as soon as possible, 
because the state will not restore the citizens' trust unless it 
honors the commitments it undertook and provides tangible deeds. 
  No doubt that consultation, unity of action, consistency of 
address, and the daily follow up of major issues are among the 
requirements for the success of your program, and of the 
materialization of the objectives which we have set for 
ourselves. 
  Solidarity and harmony will be two conditions necessary in 
order to carry out our task. 
  Here ends the directives of the head of state presented 
before the Council of Ministers. Thank you. [end recording]

  [Excerpt] Mourad Benachnou, the minister of industrial 
restructuring and participation [former economy minister], 
yesterday described his new duty as important. He said it will 
be within the framework of reorganizing the economy on the basis 
of the stability program, which was negotiated with the IMF. 
  Meanwhile, Benachnou affirmed the commitment of the new 
Prime 
Minister Mokdad Sifi to honor Algeria's international pledges. 
He added that without restructuring the economy -- which is the 
second stage of the government's policy after balancing finances 
-- the stability program could never succeed. He said that 
options that accommodate Algeria's social reality should be 
found. 
  The prime minister, who installed Benachnou in his new duty, 
said that the aim of creating this new ministry was to create a 
new nucleus in order to restructure the economy along the path 
of industrial restructuring and crossing into the market 
economy. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Concerning the setting up of the Transitional 
National Council, debates on whether to take part in it have 
flavored the lives of political parties. 
  After the National Liberation Front, the Socialist Forces 
Front, Ennahda, Ettahadi Movement, and the Democratic Movement 
for the Renewal of Algeria announced they were boycotting the 
council, the Rally for Culture and Democracy announced that it 
would not be participating. The Algerian People's Union, 
however, has agreed to join in.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf has warned 
against the danger of the U.S.-Zionist scheme against the Arab 
world. He noted that this ill will is not directed against Iraq 
alone because the imperialist scheme is targeting all Arab 
states. 
  In an interview with AL-'ARABI, al-Sahhaf said that proof of 
this scheme is that the Iraqi Government was about to conclude 
an agreement with the Kurdish parties to promote autonomy but 
the U.S. Administration, as Barzani has admitted, prevented 
these parties from concluding the agreement, which was in the 
interest of Iraq's Kurds. 
  Al-Sahhaf accused Washington, Tel Aviv, and some Arab 
parties, including Kuwait, of backing gangs in northern Iraq to 
maintain the abnormal situation there, partition Iraq, and 
conspire against it. He stressed that the Iraqis are aware of 
the goals of these schemes and are prepared to confront them. 
  Al-Sahhaf revealed the U.S. hostile acts that seek to shake 
Iraq's unity and undermine its national sovereignty. He noted 
that the no-fly zones in northern and southern Iraq are nothing 
but a U.S. conspiracy concocted by a decision that runs contrary 
to the Security Council resolutions, as UN Secretary General 
Butrus-Ghali himself has admitted. He pointed out that between 
the time that the no-fly zone was enacted in southern Iraq and 
last year, U.S. and British aircraft have made more than 25,535 
violations of the Iraqi airspace in the south, using the bases 
and facilities provided by the Saudi and Kuwaiti regimes. 
  The Iraqi minister stressed that what Iraq is being 
subjected 
to is not related to the issue of Kuwait or the implementation 
of the international resolutions but is a conspiracy led by the 
United States to achieve obvious political goals. He pointed 
out that Iraq has fully cooperated with the United Nations and 
has implemented its resolutions, particularly Resolution 687. 
Under the mutual obligations included in Paragraph 22 of this 
resolution, the UN is supposed to lift the economic blockade 
unconditionally. 
  Al-Sahhaf refuted the allegations and accusations about the 
existence of Iraqi weapons. He stated that Iraq does not 
possess any prohibited weapons and that it has gotten rid of any 
of the weapons mentioned in Resolution 687. Referring to 
reports by the UN special committee, al-Sahhaf noted that Iraq 
has cooperated with the inspection committees and has agreed to 
long-term monitoring programs to speed up the lifting of the 
embargo. 
  The Iraqi foreign minister referred to the great change in 
the stances of a number of Security Council members in light of 
the great strides made by Iraq in complying with and 
implementing the international resolutions. He said that the 
Security Council debates and the review of the blockade at its 
recent session indicated a great change in the stances of the 
majority of the member states in favor of Iraq. He noted that 
France, China, Russia, and other nonpermanent member countries 
such as Brazil, Rwanda, the Sultanate of Oman, and Spain 
demanded that the blockade be lifted. 
  The Iraqi minister regretted deeply the continued U.S. 
influence in formulating international resolutions. He said 
that the United States pushed the Security Council to continue 
the blockade despite its effects on public health, especially 
women and children, to achieve its objectives of bringing the 
Iraqi people to their knees and annihilating them. He warned 
the world of the gravity of the crime against the Iraqi people. 
He said that keeping Iraq's funds frozen in Western banks and 
institutions has deprived Iraq of the opportunity to use these 
funds to import medicine and food. The minister added that this 
collusion reflects the hostile and criminal campaign of 
annihilation unprecedented in history to which the Iraqi people 
are being subjected and that is being led by known international 
parties. He said that the reports of the international bodies 
WHO and UNICEF very clearly point to the U.S. crime in Iraq. 
  Al-Sahhaf denied that there are Kuwaiti prisoners or missing 
persons and reiterated that there are no Kuwaitis in Iraq. He 
said that Iraq has cooperated positively with the Red Cross and 
the Arab League on this issue. He accused Kuwait of continuing 
to exploit the issue, pointing out as evidence that Kuwait has 
not approved or responded to all the Arab initiatives, including 
a Gulf initiative that tried to close the file on these claims 
that are used against the Iraqi people. 
  Referring to Iraqi-Egyptian relations, Foreign Minister 
Sa'id 
al- Sahhaf said that his country has a sincere desire to develop 
the relationship that transient crises cannot destroy, although 
they have "frozen" them for a short period. He added: This is 
why we were anxious to maintain "interest section" offices in 
the two capitals.

  [Text] Baghdad, 18 Apr (INA) -- Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 
'Aziz has said those who planned and carried out the aggression 
against Iraq, those who took part in it, as well as those who 
have imposed the embargo on Iraq, want the Iraqis and others who 
believe in Arabism in the Arab world to abandon their belief in 
their principles and their adherence to their cause. They also 
want to bring the nation to its knees and make it surrender to 
their will and wishes. 
  Addressing delegations taking part in the Baghdad meeting of 
Arab journalists, organized by the Iraqi Journalists 
Association, 'Aziz said: This meeting in Baghdad boosts the 
morale of all of us and sends a signal to imperialist forces and 
those collaborating with them that their hopes and aspirations 
will not be achieved. 
  'Aziz added: The meeting in Baghdad at this time in 
particular and in this holy month has a special importance and a 
great symbolic meaning because it takes place after years of the 
aggression and the unjust embargo against Baghdad, which still 
represents a bright center of patriotism and nationalism and a 
bulwark that believes in the nation's issues that have a bearing 
on its destiny. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz added that the basis of 
any 
political or diplomatic activity is steadfastness and adherence 
to patriotic and nationalistic principles. He pointed out the 
major reasons for the change in the international position on 
the question of the unjust embargo against Iraq, attributing 
this primarily to the steadfastness of Iraq and its leadership 
and their firm adherence to national and pan-Arab principles. 
  The deputy prime minister added that the aggression against 
Iraq did not bring Iraq to its knees, as the enemies had planned 
and dreamed. The embargo has also not made the leadership and 
the people of Iraq abandon the national and pan-Arab principles 
in which they believe and for which they have struggled. He 
underlined in this regard the reconstruction campaign, which has 
not been a purely technical process. He said the reconstruction 
process was launched by a decision from the leadership. 
However, the people took part in making this decision and 
implementing it. This means that the entire population rejects 
the threat of former U.S. Secretary of State James Baker and the 
U.S. scheme and is sending a clear message in this regard. 
  Tariq 'Aziz added: The reconstruction process is a great act 
of jihad, which remarkably demonstrated the creativity of the 
Iraqis and reflected the people's resolve to reject aggression. 
This also reflects the strong relationship and harmony between 
the leadership and the people. 
  Tariq 'Aziz added: Steadfastness, success in reconstruction, 
and the strong relationship between the leadership and people 
are all behind the aggression states' reconsideration of their 
positions and their listening to Iraq. The steadfastness of the 
Iraqis made all the facts come out in the open. The strong 
relationship between the leadership and the people has become 
clear for all, including the enemies. 
  In his comprehensive conversation with Arab journalists, 
Tariq 'Aziz reviewed developments in the international arena and 
the national and pan-Arab constant principles in Iraq's policy, 
whether before or after the aggression. He said Iraq sticks to 
its option to live. 
  He further explained the current split in the Security 
Council toward many issues, saying this points to the decline of 
U.S. hegemony. This means that the forces that have faith in 
their central causes are gaining more ground. 
  'Aziz also discussed the material and historical losses of 
some countries that took part in the aggression and the embargo 
against Iraq, saying these countries have started to feel that 
they have lost more than the bribes and rewards they gained, and 
this is an important fact.

  O esteemed citizens, o masses of our struggling people; on

  [Text] Baghdad, 16 Apr (INA) -- The Ministry of Justice has 
urged organizations and bodies connected with international law 
and the defense of human rights and freedoms to work toward 
lifting the unjust embargo against Iraq. 
  In cables to these organizations, the Ministry of Justice 
said Iraq has fulfilled its obligations under Section C of 
Security Council Resolution 687. The Security Council should 
therefore implement Paragraph 22 of this resolution and lift the 
embargo imposed on the Iraqi people. The ministry noted that 
the continuation of the embargo is a blatant violation of the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Geneva Conventions.

  [Text] Baghdad, Apr 16, INA -- An Iraqi paper said that 
those saying that Russia has ended as a super power should 
reconsider their calculations and the way of thinking. 
  The community of independent states summit yesterday 
authorized Russia to send forces to any part of the world 
without prior permission from the United Nations. 
  The paper "BABIL" said that this authorization indicates 
several realities, prominent among which is that Russia has 
started restoring influence over the former Soviet republics, 
the manner that means an increased international weight for 
Russia. It added that this also means that Russia rejects the 
idea of minimizing its role and turning it into a subordinate 
power to the United States. 
  The Iraqi paper said that this shift also indicates the fall 
down of hypothesis saying that Russia does not possess the 
economic and political weight to perform the role of the 
superpower which was originally propagated by the United States 
for the sake of pushing world peoples and Russia itself to a 
state of desperation and surrender. 
  The paper added that despite the disintegration and collapse 
of the Soviet Union as planned by the United States, Russia 
remained cohesive and maintained a spirit of resistance and 
challenge to return to the international arena. 
  The paper further said that the new Russian attitude means a 
message of warning to the United States saying it should stop at 
a certain point and also ushers a signal of a possible return to 
the Cold War because the new language of Russia implied meanings 
of concern to the United States, foremost among which is that 
factors influencing the future of Russia were internal and not 
external.

  [Text] Sidon, Lebanon, April 18 (AFP) -- The authorities 
have arrested 12 Lebanese members of the ruling Iraqi Ba'th 
Party and handed over some of them to Syria, relatives said on 
Monday [18 April]. 
  The men, who were not immediately identified, were seized at 
night last week from their homes in the Sidon region of south 
Lebanon by members of the Lebanese army intelligence services, 
they said. 
  The suspects were not presented with any arrest warrants, 
were not given any reasons for being rounded up and were not 
prosecuted, relatives said. 
  Reports of the alleged arrests coincided with strained ties 
between Lebanon and Iraq, after Baghdad refused to lift the 
immunity of two diplomats suspected of murdering a prominent 
Iraqi dissident in Beirut last week. 
  The Lebanese cabinet held an emergency session on Monday to 
discuss its relations with Iraq amid press speculation that 
Beirut could sever diplomatic ties with Beirut. 
  Iraq has denied any involvement in the murder of Talib 
Suhayl, a leader of the Free Iraqi Council opposition movement. 
  But Lebanese officials have said that Iraqi commercial 
attache Khalid Khalaf and cultural attache Muhammad Kamil Kazim 
had confessed their involvement in the killing. They have been 
detained since last Wednesday. 
  Syria is Iraq's main Arab rival. Damascus deploys some 
35,000 troops in Lebanon.

  [Text] Beirut, 18 Apr (MENA)--Lebanese Foreign Minister 
Faris Buwayz has reiterated his country's refusal to "naturalize 
and settle the Palestinians who are living inside the camps in 
Lebanon, who number between 400,000 and 500,000." He stressed 
that a solution to the Palestinian problem must not be at the 
expense of Lebanon. 
  In an interview with the Lebanese newspaper AL-SAFIR 
published today, Buwayz said that many Palestinians in Lebanon 
want to return to Palestine or to other countries that will 
provide them with better residential and living conditions. He 
added that Lebanon cannot absorb such a large number of 
Palestinians because it is small in area and also because of its 
particular political structure; therefore it cannot provide them 
with jobs or health, social, and educational opportunities. 
  He revealed that Lebanon has proposed to regional and 
international parties a political plan for solving the problem 
of the Palestinian refugees in Lebanon by returning 20 percent 
of them to the territories on the West Bank and Gaza that are to 
come under Palestinian authority and distributing another 25 
percent in some Arab countries where they could be reunited with 
their families. 
  The Lebanese foreign minister went on to say that there are 
some countries that accept expatriates, such as the United 
States, Australia, and Canada, and these could take the 
remaining Palestinians. He added that the multilateral 
negotiations will not be able to solve the Palestinian refugee 
problem until a comprehensive peaceful settlement in the region 
is reached. 
  Buwayz called on the United States to deal more effectively 
with Israel. He said that Washington has not played the role of 
an impartial mediator and driving force and has not yet 
exercised dynamic mediation, as it promised when the peace 
process began. 
  Buwayz stressed that the Arab side wants to provide every 
condition and opportunity for the success of these negotiations 
despite the difficulties and Israel's tardiness, for our side 
does not want to appear negative in the world's eyes. 
  He held Israel responsible for the collapse of the situation 
in south Lebanon, stressing that Lebanon will never abandon the 
principle of resistance as long as the occupation continues and 
Israel refuses to implement Security Council Resolution 425, 
which is based on withdrawal from the Lebanese territories.

  [Text] Our correspondent reports that tension prevails 
between members of Amal and Hizballah activists in the southern 
villages following the murder of Ni'mah Khaldun Haydar, Amal's 
military official in the south, by a car bomb today. 
  Our correspondent adds that Amal activists in al-Nabatiyah 
and the neighboring villages accuse Hizballah of being 
responsible for the explosion, and that this explosion was 
perpetrated by the same people who have blown up cars belonging 
to Amal officials in Khirbat Silm, Zawtar al-Gharbiyah, and Bi'r 
al-Salasil in the past few months. 
  The same correspondent notes that there was a deep rift 
between Haydar and Hizballah members. There was an attempt on 
his life on 12 April 1990, when Hizballah members detonated an 
explosive device in Iqlim al-Tuffah which wounded Haydar.

  [Text] Hizballah's rank and file are facing severe 
confusion after news was made public that the Hizballah 
leadership handed over 11 members to the Lebanese authorities 
for carrying arms during a celebration marking Jerusalem Day. 
Imam Khomeyni designated the last Friday in Ramadan every year 
to mark Jerusalem Day. The reason for this confusion is that 
this overture could open the way for more drastic steps. This 
means that the Hizballah leadership represented by Hasan 
Nasrallah is unable to protect its members from government 
security agencies should they abide by organizational 
instructions. Hizballah members are asking why they should bear 
the brunt when all they did was to carry out what their 
leadership ordered, that is, to carry arms and appear in public 
places. 
  Hizballah members are asking if it is admissible for youths 
to pay the price for Nasrallah's decisions when failure to obey 
orders is considered a violation of the Velayat-e Faqih [rule by 
supreme jurisconsult], which is a sin. Hizballah members are 
also asking why Nasrallah should sleep safe and sound in his 
home under the protection of more than 100 heavily armed men 
while those who sincerely obeyed his organizational orders stay 
in Lebanese government jails. Is it not required to pursue the 
official who is responsible for giving the orders for members to 
carry arms in public, that is Nasrallah, instead of arresting 
ordinary members here and there and putting them in jail with 
all the humiliation of the dignity of these sincere youths? 
  Certain Hizballah members compare the situation within their 
organization to that of the Lebanese Forces some time ago when 
Samir Ja'ja' began to sell his low-ranking members to the 
Lebanese Government so that he and his close aides could avoid 
the block. However, this approach gradually led to giving up 
Fu'ad Malik, chief of staff of the Lebanese Forces, to stave off 
any danger to Ja'ja' personally. Hence, resentment against 
Nasrallah is mounting because members believe that the countdown 
has begun with the selling of Hizballah cadres according to 
deals, the price of which will be paid to Nasrallah and 
Hizballah members in the Chamber of Deputies. 
  An informed source has said that the government's success in 
apprehending Hizballah members under legal warrants has had a 
direct impact on confidence between Hizballah members in 
al-Biqa' and their leadership. He said that many Hizballah 
members now hesitate to carry out the decisions of the 
leadership in Beirut. They justify their hesitation by saying 
that the leadership may abandon them after implementing its 
decisions, like what happened to the members who carried out the 
Hizballah leadership's decision to carry arms in public during 
the celebration of Jerusalem Day. This leadership handed them 
over to the state to punish them for carrying arms in public. 
  The confidence crisis between Hizballah members and their 
leadership deepened after Hizballah's Voice of the Oppressed 
radio, which transmits from Ba'labakk, laid off several 
employees in its Political Programs Department after the 
government's decision on audio and visual media. It is worth 
noting that most employees in this radio are Hizballah members.

  [Text] Beirut -- The joint Syrian-Lebanese committee for 
electricity affairs held a meeting yesterday in Beirut. 
  Nasri Khuri, secretary general of the Higher Syrian-Lebanese 
Council, announced that the discussion dealt with two main 
topics: the establishment of a joint training center, and a grid 
link between the two fraternal countries. 
  Khuri pointed out that it was agreed to exchange expertise 
in 
the electricity field with regard to power stations, grids, and 
other technical aspects. 
  Regarding the grid link, Khuri said that it was agreed to 
prepare the power lines coming from 'Anjar Power Station and the 
northern region for the exchange of energy before the end of 
1994. 
  Khuri revealed that several projects are under discussion to 
increase the power link between the two countries. 
  Regarding the agenda of the next meeting, Khuri said the 
building of a power station will be the subject of the next 
meeting. The current idea, he added, is to build this station 
on Lebanese territory, in the northern region of al-Biddawi, in 
order to benefit from the waters of the southern al-Nahr 
al-Kabir River for the cooling operations.

  [Text] Islamabad -- PML [Pakistan Muslim League] president 
Mian Nawaz Sharif expressed serious doubts about the real 
outcome of the recent talks between the US and the PPP [Pakistan 
People's Party] government on the nuclear issue. 
  Demanding the details of the nuclear inspection talks on 
Friday the PML chief said media reports had strengthened the 
suspicion in this regard as the US declared that its objective 
was to achieve non-proliferation in South Asia by forcing 
Pakistan to rollback and cap its nuclear programme. 
  He said since the US Deputy Secretary of State declared 
these 
talk as "complete success" therefore it was legitimate to ask 
about the details of these talks, adding, a further cause of 
concern is the announcement by both sides that in the future 
deliberations on achieving the American objectives would be 
pursed through quiet and secret diplomacy". 
  Former prime minister pointed out that the joint communique 
issued at the end of these talks failed to mention the Indian 
nuclear and ballistic missile programme which is a real threat 
to the security of the region, adding," there has been no 
reference to a regional approach on the nuclear issue. 
  Nawaz Sharif expressing his concern over the "quiet 
diplomacy" being talked about in the context of the nuclear 
programme said, "like the rest of his countrymen I have certain 
apprehension that under the garb of this quiet diplomacy the PPP 
government would damage national security as it did by providing 
help to Rajiv Gandhi on on the Sikh issue". He said that help 
came to light almost five years after the event when Benazir 
herself confessed it recently and perhaps it was also a part of 
the PPP's quiet diplomacy of that period. 
  Criticising Benazir Bhutto he alleged, "since the entire 
nation knows that she is a security risk we have every right to 
question her motives in pursuing 'quiet diplomacy' which could 
end up similar to the secret support to Rajiv Gandhi on the Sikh 
issue". 
  Highlighting the importance of Pakistan's nuclear programme 
he said there is broad national consensus on the nuclear issue 
and the PPP would not be allowed to compromise on this issue. 
  Terming the nuclear issue as a sacred trust and as a 
deterrent against foreign aggression he said Pakistan's 
consistent commitment was viewing the nuclear issue in a 
regional perspective with an even-handed approach that links the 
core security question like Kashmir with the nuclear issue. 
  He warned that any reversal of this position would amount to 
rolling back the nuclear programme and the national consensus. 
He asked the PPP government to dispel apprehensions and doubts 
it should categorically the nation about its real position on 
the nuclear issue. [sentence as published] 
  However, he said the PML will not allow any compromise on 
the 
nuclear issue.

  [Text] Narowal -- PML-N [Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz] 
chief Nawaz Sharif Saturday called upon the United States to 
mind its own nuclear programme before asking Pakistan to allow 
an inspection of its facilities. 
  Addressing the District Bar here, Nawaz suspected the claims 
of US Deputy Secretary of State, Strobe Talbott that his visit 
to Pakistan was a complete success. "If they want to peep in 
our nuclear programme, they should first mind their own nuclear 
programme," he said. 
  He said US officials had also met him "but I told them that 
we want friendly relations only and would not beg for aid". 
  Pointing out that India was far ahead of Pakistan in the 
production of conventional weapons, he said the country's 
nuclear programme was the only deterrence to India. 
  Rejecting the capping of the country's nuclear programme in 
exchange of F-16 aircraft, he feared that the F-16s would be of 
little use once the nuclear programme was capped. 
  He also warned that the inspection of the nuclear facilities 
was tantamount to accepting restrictions at every stage of 
development of the programme. 
  Condemning the rollback of the Motorway project, he asked 
Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto not to cancel the programme only 
because it was started during his government. He said 
[Uzbekistan] President Islam Karimov had also expressed his 
concern over the cancellation of the project and said he would 
not be keen to expand ties if Benazir was not interested in 
boosting mutual relations.

  [Excerpt] Jordan has promised the United States to 
restrain the activity of the Hamas organization in its 
territory. From Washington, Qol Yisra'el's correspondent Arye 
Golan quotes American sources as saying that since the weekend, 
the Hamas headquarters in the Jordanian capital is no longer 
operating. Israeli sources have said that if Jordan indeed 
stands by her pledge, Israel will take no further action. Last 
week Israeli leaders made it clear that they expected Jordan to 
halt Hamas' incitement and operational activity directed from 
its Amman offices. 
  Earlier, King Husayn himself made it clear that he 
considered 
an illegal organization in the Hashemite kingdom. [passage

<F P=106> [Report by JORDAN TIMES staff reporter Nirmin Murad] </F>
  [Text] Amman--Jordanian authorities have withdrawn the 
passports of Hamas representative in Jordan Muhammad Nazzal and 
Hamas spokesman Ibrahim Ghawshah, pending their decision on 
whether to comply with Jordanian regulations. 
  Official sources said the two men were summoned by the 
authorities and asked to "decide whether they are 
Palestinian--in which case they would be given a temporary 
two-year passport given to residents of the occupied 
territories, or they are Jordanian citizens who comply with 
Jordanian laws." 
  The sources said the two were also asked to refrain from 
making any statements claiming responsibility for attacks in the 
occupied territories. 
  A senior Jordanian official told the Jordan Times that the 
government had intended to curb the activities of Hamas in 
Jordan without much publicity but was pressured to publicise 
these measures after Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin issued 
a warning to Jordan charging that it was helping Hamas. 
  "We had already instructed the minister of interior to deal 
with the issue before Rabin had his press conference," the 
senior official said. 
  Hamas representatives were not available for comment Monday, 
but the movement issued a statement charging that Mr. Rabin was 
"creating fictitious conflicts to cover up for his political 
failure." 
  "The prime minister of the enemy Yitzhaq Rabin has issued a 
warning to Jordanin which he claimed that there is a leadership 
for Hamas on its territory and demanding that the Jordanian 
government take action against its activities," the statement 
responded. 
  "It is a failed attempt to use the confirmation by the Hamas 
representatives in Amman of 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam's Brigades' 
claim of responsibility for the heroic acts in 'Afula and 
Hadera," the statement said. 
  "Rabin and his government know very well that the 
al-Qassam's 
Brigades conduct, plan and execute their activities from the 
occupied territories," the statement said, adding that "his 
failure to put an end to these attacks, and the revealing of his 
deception in the settlement process has caused him to use these 
attacks to issue a warning to Jordan." 
  Hamas said that Mr. Rabin needed to warn Jordan to achieve 
the following objectives: 
  --Direct attention away from the failure of his security 
measures and his oppressive measures in putting an end to the 
heroic attacks by the al-Qassam Brigades. 
  --Use the "American sword" to pressure Jordan towards 
signing 
a unilateral agreement with his government similar to the one 
signed in Oslo, and this warning falls in line with the policy 
of the U.S. administration which uses the naval blockade on 
al-'Aqabah as a way to pressure Jordan for the same purpose. 
  Despite the strong language against Israel and Mr. Rabin's 
government, the Hamas statement appeared to set a precedent in 
opening the door for bargaining with Israel. 
  Stressing that the attacks against Israeli civilians were in 
retaliation against the Hebron massacre of Palestinian 
worshippers, Hamas said that this was not a policy but the 
"exception." 
  "Hamas is ready to reconsider this exception on the 
condition 
that the enemy's prime minister, his government and his army 
halt completely all killings of unarmed civilians from our 
people," the statement said. 
  "We are not against peace," the statement added," but the 
peace offered by the government of the enemy is not peace but a 
consolidation of occupation and the injustice falling on our 
people." 
  "While we in Hamas know well that the Oslo agreement is 
nothing but humiliating surrender from the PLO... we think that 
the right beginning would be on the following foundations," the 
statement added. 
  Hamas demanded the "full Israeli withdrawal from our 
Palestinian land and dismantling and removal of all settlements, 
the holding of full and free elections in the West Bank and Gaza 
to select the representatives of our people and their 
leadership." 
  "The chosen leadership will be the one that represents the 
aspirations and hopes of our people and will decide on the 
ensuing steps," the statement concluded in what most analysts 
termed as an indication that Hamas was proposing itself as an 
alternative leadership to the Palestine Liberation Organisation, 
through the results of the elections and by deduction the side 
to conduct negotiations with Israel.

<F P=106> [Report by Salamah Ni'mat: "King Husayn Announces Ban on </F>
Hamas Activities"] 
  [Excerpts] Amman -- King Husayn of Jordan yesterday 
announced a ban on the activities of the Islamic Resistance 
Movement (Hamas) in Jordan and emphasized that his country did 
not recognize or deal with any Palestinian organization other 
than the PLO as the sole legitimate representative of the 
Palestinian people. King Husayn, speaking at a press conference 
he held after chairing a cabinet meeting which discussed the 
Israeli threats to the Kingdom and the charge that Jordan 
supports Hamas, said that any Palestinian organization other 
than the PLO would be treated as "unlawful." [passage omitted] 
  Responsible government sources have told AL-HAYAH that the 
government "had decided to close Hamas' offices in Amman" and 
ban its informational activities before Rabin made his threats. 
  The sources pointed out that the government considered that 
step "an internal matter in harmony with Jordan's policy which 
sees the PLO as the only party empowered to speak for the 
Palestinian people." 
  They stressed that the official authorities "have not and 
will not take any measures" against Hamas representative in 
Jordan Muhammad Nazzal or its official spokesman Ibrahim 
Ghawshah, "because the two are Jordanian citizens who abide by 
the country's current Constitution and laws." The same sources 
pointed out that "despite Jordan's affirmation that neither 
Nazzal nor Ghawshah had anything to do with the planning and 
execution of military operations in the occupied territory, we 
will allow no one to exploit their statements in the media to 
undermine Jordan." [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Hamas office in Jordan continues functioning 
regularly, despite reports and announcements that it had been 
closed. Office workers come to work, answer phones, and operate 
the office as before. In a telephone conversation with the 
Hamas office, Muhammad Nazzal, head of the movement, said that 
the office exists and is operational, "but unfortunately, I 
cannot make comments to your newspaper because it is our policy 
not to speak with Israeli elements." 
  Jordanian sources in Amman have reported that the king's 
decision regarding Hamas has remained unchanged but, as far as 
they know, no practical steps to restrict the movement's 
activity have been taken so far. According to them, the heads 
of the movement were summoned for a discussion with the heads of 
the Jordanian intelligence who asked that Hamas media activity 
be reduced.

<F P=106> [News conference by King Husayn with unidentified </F>
correspondents in Amman on 16 April -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Husayn] I am happy to have this opportunity to meet 
with all the brothers here. Proceed please. 
  [Correspondent] Your Majesty, from the beginning of the 
peace 
process, you have repeatedly warned that any delay in the peace 
process would lead to frustration in the region and that 
extremism in the region will increase. Yesterday, Israel tried 
to hold Jordan responsible for some acts of violence in the West 
Bank. How do you explain the situation, in light of the 
conditions at which the peace process has arrived? 
  [Husayn] Concerning the peace process, I said at the 
beginning of this process that it would need time, that it 
required concentrated, sincere, serious, and objective efforts 
to reach its goals. In fact, even by my own standards, I 
noticed that there are pitfalls, procrastinations, and wastes of 
time. In fact, the beginnings were different from the present 
reality, now, in terms of the fact that, in my view, the vast 
majority of the people concerned in the entire region were 
optimistic that there would be serious progress toward tangible 
results. Regrettably, as time went by and with the pitfalls and 
confusion, these hopes or this zeal [hamas] -- please forgive me 
for this expression, I mean, by the zeal, the zeal for peace -- 
has dropped. 
  Many sides perhaps share the responsibility for all of this, 
be they the sponsors of the process or the parties concerned. I 
can frankly say that Israel bears the major part in terms of 
time that was lost. We in Jordan have reiterated our position 
in terms of our readiness and determination to work seriously to 
implement the provisions of the agenda, which was approved after 
the signing of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement in Washington, 
and to deal with all the important problems at the time in a way 
that would ensure that the end result would be the state of 
peace, the peace agreement and not the opposite. 
  We have time and again called for movement on all tracks 
pursuing a comprehensive settlement, under which future 
generations in the entire region enjoy completely different 
living conditions in terms of peace, stability, tranquility, and 
chances to bring about a state of affairs under which all 
parties can join hands and preserve peace for the benefit of 
future generations. 
  As for the issue of terror, our record testifies to a 
consistent condemnation of all acts of terrorism. We have 
suffered many casualties who fell victim to terror here and 
there around the world. We are against terrorism wherever and 
whenever it targets innocents. We condemn, denounce, and combat 
terror. The feelings of frustration have, recently, been 
running high in this region. However, one incident--the 
al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre--stands out as undeniably the 
ultimate in savagery. 
  To be fair, we cannot single out one party as the target for 
accusations of extremism. Extremism is as much a reality there 
as it is on the Arab side. 
  In all cases, it may be that the goal is to kill the 
chances of a just, durable, and decent and viable peace. We are 
saddened on account of the victims and their relatives of an 
incident here or anywhere else in the world irrespective of 
their place in this or that state or in this or that position. 
As I have said, we believe that terrorism aims at assassinating 
peace and the chances to realize peace. This requires a degree 
of awareness for those who want to realize or contribute to 
realizing a just, permanent, and honorable peace. 
  I believe that Israel should also appraise its own 
contributions on the path of peace so far. We hope that 
everyone will reconsider their calculations and move seriously 
before it is too late, because the alternative, God forbid, will 
be a disaster for all, not only on the level of officials but on 
the level of everybody in the entire region. 
  Concerning us -- and this issue concerns us, in fact, and 
perhaps we talked about it with the brother officials before the 
recent developments and media escalation -- after 1974 and after 
a prolonged and frank discussion at the Rabat summit conference, 
we adopted the Palestinian and Arab approach. We all accepted 
the PLO as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian 
Arab people. When we went to Madrid, we provided an umbrella 
for the Palestinian moves so that the Palestinian Arab people 
would exercise their right in representing the Palestinian 
dimension under their recognized and accredited leadership. 
When things developed concerning the Oslo agreement, we took a 
position supporting the Palestinian brothers in terms of what 
they had chosen and we overcame the factor of shock in order to 
be in harmony with ourselves. Moreover, we went and signed the 
joint agenda immediately after the Israeli-Palestinian agreement 
in Washington. 
  Consistent with our stand and at this critical phase, the 
only organization that has our recognition as representative of 
the Palestinian people here is the PLO, which maintains a 
mission and related institutions in Jordan. We are not dealing 
with any other Palestinian or non-Palestinian organizations. We 
will not accept any practices carried out in their name on this 
land. 
  If we are talking about Jordanian nationals, they will be 
regarded as such -- Jordanians belonging to a large family 
hailing from various stocks. We will do our utmost on behalf of 
national unity in Jordan, until such time as a change becomes 
necessary. 
  We do not want this country to become a battleground, God 
forbid, between this or that faction of the people of Palestine 
or the people of Jordan. We will not, under any circumstances, 
permit any excesses that will put us in a position in which we 
would not be able to be consistent with our constant stand that 
the PLO is the only legitimate representative of the Palestinian 
Arab people. They can debate their affairs among themselves, 
and whether they agree or disagree among themselves is their 
business. We support the PLO and do not recognize any other 
organization. This is how things stand. 
  It seems, though, that there have been, of late, different 
quarters that want this country to take on greater burdens than 
it has already unjustly borne. This is not strange. The whole 
issue is one of conflict and adherence to rights and principle. 
When it comes to rights, we will speak out, no matter what 
critics may think. 
  [Correspondent] Your Majesty: The Israeli prime minister 
has issued a clear and direct threat to Jordan at a news 
conference. Israel is now in crisis due to the two operations. 
It is also disrupting the peace process. What is Jordan's 
response to the threat? Will Jordan take action against Hamas? 
  [Husayn] As I have told you, we do not recognize any 
organization other than the PLO -- the sole and legitimate 
representative of the Palestinian Arab people -- and its 
official, recognized organs in this country. We are not dealing 
with any other group. Nor will we recognize it or allow it to 
have any activities in this arena. That was our position before 
the Israeli prime minister, or any other Israeli officials, 
spoke at his news conference. This is because this is an affair 
of ours here in Jordan. 
  [Correspondent] You have mentioned pressures being applied 
on Jordan in relation to the issue of the Gulf of Aqaba. What is 
Jordan required to do? Why this pressure? 
  [Husayn] Help me find the answer. It seems that what is 
required of Jordan is something vague that I cannot put my 
finger on. It may be one of a number of objectives or a 
combination of objectives. The blockade of the Port of 
al-'Aqabah, in my opinion, was, from the beginning, meant to 
damage Jordan's credibility. Else, why single out Jordan, which 
is not the only neighboring state of Iraq? Jordan has complied 
with Security Council resolutions with regard to brotherly Iraq. 
Then, the aim is to continually discredit Jordan's image and 
damage the country's credibility around the world. This is 
something that we regard as unacceptably demeaning to this 
country. 
  The recent accusations that Jordan has relations with or 
harbors terror must be seen in the same context. I don't think 
that many people in the world can say they have been victims of 
terror and have resisted terror in the manner Jordan has. Our 
policy in this regard is clear and unambiguous. 
  I sometimes wonder whether democracy in this country is also 
being targeted as a source of apprehension for some. In this 
country, we believe in democracy and will continue to strive to 
make this country a model for others in the region and beyond. 
Are these policies aiming to get Jordan to give in to these 
pressures? Our heads will remain held high and will only bow to 
God. 
  I am not saying this only as one human being among you. I 
say this based on the absolute trust I have in my mind and heart 
in the large Jordanian family, its truthfulness, and its ability 
to be patient until the conditions improve. 
  [Correspondent] The U.S. secretary of state will begin a new 
tour of the region soon. What are your hopes? Will the U.S. 
official carry any new proposals to promote the peace process? 
  [Husayn] That is what we hope for. I do not know when he 
will visit the region, but I hope that this will be very soon. 
Concerning the al-'Aqabah issue, we have raised this and we are 
awaiting something that reassures us that it is going to be 
resolved. We raised this issue after we felt that we could no 
longer remain silent about the practices against this country 
and the blockade imposed on it for years. 
  [Correspondent] Al-Sharif Zayd Bin-Shakir [chief of the 
Royal 
court] left for Yemen today as part of His Majesty King Husayn's 
good efforts to resolve the political crisis in Yemen. Are you 
optimistic, sir, on the subject of the Yemeni crisis? 
  [Husayn] I always have to be optimistic, sir. In fact, we 
have been exerting our sincere efforts for the past seven 
months. We felt that we were responding to the Yemeni desire to 
help them overcome the problems and difficulties that threatened 
their great achievement of realizing Yemeni unity. Then there 
was the agreement and the accord document. We were happy to 
welcome all the representatives in Yemen here in Amman, where 
they signed the document, which deals with all problems and 
paves the way for building the strong, modern Yemen that we 
wish. Regrettably, only hours after the signing of the 
agreement, bloody clashes occurred which took us by surprise and 
pained us. We were asked to move again. A high-ranking 
military group left here. We met with our brothers in the 
Sultanate of Oman, as part of a joint mission that worked as one 
team. This mission stopped the fighting and was able to restore 
some of the formations to their original places and has been 
contributing to calming the situation so far. However, this 
mission cannot continue. Our Omani brothers have ended their 
mission, and we are considering ending ours, too. We will have 
a presence like any state represented in Yemen, through a 
military attache's office. This is because if we consider the 
document, there are many problems that must be tackled by our 
brothers in Yemen. They must bear their full responsibilities 
until the Armed Forces are reorganized and reunited. Then, we 
will be able to make moves, if they wish, and acquiesce to their 
wishes. We are prepared to serve them in any field in which we 
can help in order to promote the unity and the aims enshrined in 
the document. But, they have to bear their responsibilities. 
All the sons of beloved Yemen should bear this responsibility. 
  Now, there are so many parties in the picture. We feel that 
our presence will not offer the service we offered in the past. 
This is the message a Jordanian delegation is bearing to the 
brothers in Yemen right now. We are awaiting the notes this 
delegation will bring us from there. We only hope that Yemen 
will remain united and that we will not be party to partitioning 
Yemen or fragmenting it, God forbid, in any way.

<F P=106> [Speech by King Husayn in Amman -- live] </F>
  [Text] In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful. 
Prayers and peace be upon His faithful Arab Hashemite Prophet 
and all his companions. 
  Dear brothers, Arabs and Muslims everywhere: 
  God's peace, compassion and blessings be upon all of you. 
  Praise be to Allah, the Almighty, who sustains the glory of 
Islam and who, verily, makes the future belong to those who take 
heed for themselves and follow the straight path. I bear 
witness that there is no god but Allah, who has no compeers, and 
that Muhammad, peace be upon him, is the votary and messenger of 
Allah, who took him on a night journey from the al-Haram Mosque 
to the al-Aqsa Mosque from where he ascended to the Lotus tree 
in the Seventh Heaven. 
  Also, I praise God for all His kindness to me, especially 
since he blessed me with a special favor to be associated with 
the first qiblah [direction of Muslim prayer] and the third 
sacred mosque. This association goes back to the early days of 
the first great message and the day when God brought the light 
of Islam to Jerusalem. Ever since then, the holy city thrived 
in glory, piety and tolerance. It also goes back to the day 
when the body of the great revolutionary al-Husayn Bin-'Ali, was 
finally laid to rest in the sacred grounds of al-Aqsa. It was 
he who had set an example for historical leaders of how to 
choose between attaining glory of the transient moment and 
immortality in the life hereafter. It was the very same 
association that was consolidated when I witnessed 'Abdallah 
Bin-al-Husayn as he fell a martyr on the sacred grounds of 
al-Aqsa Mosque as he stood upright in dignity, like all 
Hashemites who pass away while still firmly adhering to 
time-honored principles [applause] and determined to attain 
their goals against all odds. Little wonder that they have been 
immortalized in the annals of history. 
  Islam was in point of fact the message of all God's prophets 
and messengers whose missions had been sealed by that of 
Muhammad, peace be upon him. Over and above that, my 
relationship with Jerusalem is similar to that of any Muslim who 
believes in God, His angels, holy books, messengers, and the Day 
of Judgment, and who strives, along with the patient tiny 
minority of the faithful, to defend his nation, inspired by what 
the holy koran says: Remember when you were few and powerless 
in the land, afraid of despoliation at the hands of men. But 
then God sheltered and helped you to strength, and provided for 
you good things that you may perhaps be grateful. [Koranic verse] 
  Dear brethren, 
  The accomplishment we celebrate today is one of my dearest 
achievements, namely, the third Hashemite-sponsored renovation 
of al-Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Holy Rock. It was by 
God's grace that I was able to fulfill my obligations seeking 
only the reward of the exalted Lord. 
  As I take special pride in, and feel happy about, this 
blessing conferred upon me and all Jordanians by the Lord, I 
must admit that this joyous occasion is soured by the current 
state of affairs of this nation and the suffering of its 
peoples, especially the people of Jerusalem and Palestine. At 
this moment, my memory takes me back to the morning of Thursday, 
the 28th of Rabi' al-'Awwal, 1384 Hegira, corresponding to 6 
August, 1964, when we celebrated in the city of Jerusalem the 
completion of the first phase of the renovation of al-Aqsa 
Mosque and the Dome of the Holy Rock. May I recall the very 
same words I addressed to the nation 30 years ago. The appeal I 
made on that morning in the distant past was quite timely then 
as it is now, for it was intended to alert the entire nation to 
the dangers of fragmentation. 
  My exact words then were as follows: 
  As we celebrate today, we look beyond our immediate scope of 
vision towards the millions of Arab and Muslims in Asia and 
Africa who, at this moment, collectively set their eyes on 
Palestine. Let me emphasize that the actual renovation of the 
Mosque and the Dome of the Holy Rock assumes significance far 
beyond the physical repair work on their actual site to include, 
in addition to the salvation of the rock, the preservation of 
its mosque and the maintenance of its dome, the complete 
restoration of our full rights in our usurped land, the dear 
Arab land [of Palestine]. [applause] I also said that this 
country, my dear brethren, has for years been pursuing 
development efforts at the same time when we were also defending 
our homeland and nation. Palestine has always been the essence 
of Jordan's pan-Arab message, figured prominently in our 
national construction and defense efforts because Jordan lives 
for Palestine and for its sake stands ready to sacrifice itself. 
  This was our plea then which was inspired by the eternal and 
historic positions of al-Husayn Bin-'Ali on Palestine and its 
holy shrines, positions which settled deep in our hearts and 
came forth on our lips. They were later reinforced by Faysal 
Bin-al-Husayn's battle cry, "Let us embrace death, brethren 
Arabs." [applause] It was also impressively demonstrated by the 
sincerity of 'Abdallah Bin-al-Husayn in defending the holy 
places and his comprehension of the dynamics of our age. It was 
indeed his sense of duty which prompted him to accept the 
supervision of the renovation work at al- Haram al-Sharif under 
the patronage of al-Husayn Bin-'Ali, as clearly documented in 
the letter addressed to him in 1924 by the late Hajj Amin 
al-Husayni, the then head of the supreme Islamic council, may 
his soul rest in peace. It was 'Abdallah Bin-al-Husayn himself 
who personally ascended to the roof of the Church of the Holy 
Sepulcher to direct efforts to fight a fire that threatened the 
structure of the church in 1949. Later, he offered the funds 
needed for complete repair of damage to the church. Our 
position toward all the sons of the nation today is no 
different. It is the same position demonstrated by our soldiers 
as they put up legendary resistance in defending the walls, 
alleys and streets of Jerusalem in the June 1967 war. They were 
the same brave servicemen who kept faith as they fought the 
al-Karamah Battle as a perpetuation of their struggle for 
Jerusalem. They were the ones who neither compromised Arab 
rights nor did they waver in their determination to defend those 
rights or face up to the oppression of the usurpers. The rights 
I have in mind are the inalienable rights of the people of 
Palestine, including the restoration of peace to al-Aqsa Mosque 
and the al-Ibrahimi Mosque so that no worshiper there would ever 
be terrorized by a murderer; so that Salah-al-Din's pulpit would 
never be set ablaze by a bigot; so that children would never be 
sprayed at point blank with gunfire by a usurper. 
  Brothers and Sisters of the noble nation: Thanks to our 
firm belief in Almighty God and by virtue of faith and 
determination of the righteous people, we have been able to 
maintain our resolve. Our martyrs' blood was the light guiding 
us to Jerusalem, the dear and precious city, the symbol of 
steadfastness and the gem of peace. To us, the Hashemites, 
Jerusalem has been an eternal trust of religious tolerance we 
cherish in accordance with Caliph 'Umar's Covenant, consecrated 
by Jordanian blood and a symbol of Arab and Muslim struggle. 
Thus, our association with Jerusalem stands above the fray of 
political ploys and earthly greed [applause] since it has been 
anchored in the faith, prophethood, history, and martyrdom. We 
will keep our pledge and we will continue to defend the nation's 
rights in it so that it will return as an Arab and Islamic city 
[applause] in accordance with the international legitimacy and 
so that sovereignty over its holy sites will only be for God. In 
the name of God, the Almighty, the nation will be entitled to 
religious jurisdiction in a manner that will be determined by 
consensus. In this fashion, a link between the past and the 
present will be maintained and [Caliph] 'Umar's Covenant will 
continue to be a beacon lighting the road of relationship with 
Jerusalem--the symbol, history, and holy shrines. What trust 
could be dearer and more precious than our holy places in it! 
  Hence, in the name of the martyrs of Al al-Bayt [the House 
of 
the Prophet] and all the nation's martyrs, headed by the martyrs 
of this dear Arab homeland, we appeal to the nation to rise in 
order to rescue Jerusalem [applause] and to be able to confront 
all forms of blockade, oppression, and estrangement. This 
nation is worthy of freedom, glory, and life. Our grandfathers 
chose to leave Hejaz earlier in this century in order to 
spearhead its revolution. They carried the banners of freedom, 
unity, and tolerance and shouldered the trust of the revolution 
together--Muslims and Christians, Arabs and non-Arabs--united by 
the banner of the Great Arab Revolt and the noble goals of 
defending human rights and dignity. [applause] 
  For the sake of securing the peoples' right to 
self-determination, al-Husayn Bin-'Ali said no to all forms of 
colonization and usurpation. 'Abdallah Bin-al-Husayn, too, said 
no to all forms of division and loss. And today, we say no to 
any solution that does not restore Arab sovereignty to Arab 
Jerusalem [applause] so that the whole city would eventually 
become a token and symbol of peace for all the faithful children 
of Abraham, peace be upon him. In the same breath, we say no to 
any solution that does not secure the historical and legitimate 
rights of the people of Palestine on their sacred national soil 
[applause]. And we say no to any peace the next generations do 
not accept, safeguard, or defend because it does not represent 
right, justice, and human dignity. [applause] 
  Dear brothers, distinguished guests: 
  Today, we celebrate the completion of renovation work at the 
Dome of the Rock and our brethren in Jerusalem are observing the 
same occasion. We are one and the same family. This event is 
just another reminder of a long history of common heritage 
marked by patience, cherished memories, and satisfaction. I pray 
God to enable us to fulfill our obligation to the cause of 
Islam. To this end, we have started construction work in this 
country on the mausoleums of the Prophet's companions, may God 
be pleased with them, since they were the first Muslims to set 
foot on this land and elsewhere in the Muslim world. More so, 
because they were either from the House of the Prophet or his 
associates. This honor will include the other mujahidin who 
followed in their steps. These mausoleums should be designed 
and constructed as architectural masterpieces that display to 
the generations to come the splendor of their achievements as 
well as to serve as a source of inspiration to them. For this 
land was the gate to the Islamic conquest through Mu'tah and 
al-Yarmuk, and the passage to Muslim cavalier battalions to 
Hittin and 'Ayn Jalut. 
  In the name of upright Islam, we also initiated work to 
establish the 'Al al-Bayt [The House of the Prophet] University 
which will be the gift of all members of the House of the 
Prophet, peace be upon him, to the entire Islamic nation. The 
institution is conceived to be an Islamic forum that encompasses 
the glorious past history while it seeks to cope with the 
challenges of the present and the future. Our ultimate goal is 
to meet the Lord's wish that this nation will remain the most 
favored among communities raised on this earth. 
  In the same vein, we have reached out to our brethren in the 
newly independent Islamic republics. A team of our experts is 
engaged now in providing assistance to those republics in a 
number of areas, including education, construction, and culture. 
We intended to help in the restoration of the Mausoleum of 
al-Qutham Ibn-al-'Abbass in Samarkand to its original 
magnificence, splendor, and beauty. We have also commissioned 
the restoration of the splendid pulpit of Salah-al-Din at its 
original site in the al-Aqsa Mosque. If anything, this is our 
response to the malicious bigots who set it ablaze [in 1968]. 
We have engaged ourselves in this exercise secure in our 
knowledge that history will ultimately do justice to this 
nation. It was Nur-al-Din Zinki, the renowned Muslim martyr, 
who ordered the artisans of Aleppo to perfect its manufacture, 
and it was Salah-al-Din himself who moved it to Jerusalem 20 
years after it had been built. It is my fervent hope now to see 
it back in place one day and to attend a sermon there in which a 
preacher would congratulate the nation on restoring Jerusalem to 
the nation, free, dignified, and proud. 
  Dear brothers and sisters, the current plight of our nation 
is a very severe one and the prognosis is grim indeed. I can 
see no salvation except by ensuring genuine freedoms and making 
sacrifices, in addition to enlightenment and clear vision. Only 
then can we comprehend the evolution of history with a fresh 
outlook which would enable us to instill into the younger 
generation a sense of new hope to attain rejuvenation, revival, 
scientific know-how and strength. This would also help us in 
shaking ourselves loose from the sins of the current epoch of 
weakness, the colonial designs, the oil curse, and oppressive 
practices. Down this road, we would perhaps see an end to our 
senseless hostilities and to the meaningless loss of our 
resources and blood which are given away in the service of 
foreign interests. Then, the whole nation would emerge free of 
ethnic intolerance, religious extremism, or cultural 
introversion. 
  To Jerusalem, the omnipresent city in our minds and hearts, 
we send our greetings. 
  Without Jerusalem, our lives will always be lacking in 
harmony. For Jerusalem represents our collective memory and 
common faith. It stands for our epicenter of knowledge, vision, 
and religious tolerance as exemplified in the Covenant of 'Umar 
[Ibn-al-Khattab, the second caliph in early Islam]. It is the 
focal point of our cherished freedom and dignified peace. 
  We will continue to warn against and then resist all 
attempts at tampering with our Islamic holy shrines, at the 
first of the two Qiblahs [direction to which a Muslim addresses 
his prayers] and the third holiest mosque, in particular, and 
throughout the Islamic world. We shall oppose any change in the 
physical features of these shrines that might be effected under 
false pretexts or repair, expansion, or renovation, or under any 
other slogan. For such attempts might strip the nation of its 
historical legacy to safeguard and maintain them. These 
endeavors of ours will be mounted on behalf of and in 
coordination with the entire Islamic nation with a view to 
ensuring the preservation of its sacred common heritage. 
  Here, we must emphasize that the means to repair our holy 
places in Jerusalem are known. They are the committees in 
charge of this. I mean the Jordanian Awqaf Ministry and the 
Commission on the Renovation of the al-Aqsa Mosque and the Dome 
of the Holy Rock, which have been assuming their 
responsibilities for decades. Palestine is determined to restore 
its right to freedom. It enjoys an enlightened awareness that 
it will triumph, God willing. We beseech God to have mercy on 
the souls of its martyrs, from 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam to the 
worshipers at the Holy Ibrahimi Mosque, [applause] and to make 
us to always remember them and to be faithful to them. 
  O beloved ones who maintain their steadfastness on the land 
of Palestine and those in fraternal Iraq who are courageously, 
patiently facing the blockade. O those who are defending the 
unity of your land, people, and spirit in beloved Yemen. O 
Arabs and Muslims everywhere. Let me seize this moment to renew 
the pledge initially undertaken by our forefathers that they 
will bow their heads in submission to no one except to God, the 
Almighty. They committed themselves to combating injustice and 
oppression in a manner that behooves their lineage to Hamzah of 
'Uhud, Ja'afar of Mu'ta, and al-Husayn of Karbala'. 
  Many a Hashemite martyr uttered in soliloquy: O Lord, I have 
control over none but myself, which I offer in duty to their 
cause. And many of them swore an oath to each other that they 
would fight till death rather than retreat, surrender or 
disgrace themselves. No wonder that their tombs are still 
recognized throughout the larger homeland and their names are 
held in high esteem by the nation. Their memories are 
associated with holy events and places that are subject to no 
authority other than that of the one united nation. Their souls 
seek no permission for prayer at this mosque or that. After 
all, they were the ones who in their deeds demonstrated to the 
world the real difference between freedom and bondage, between 
justice and oppression, between dignity and submission. In the 
face of a sever crisis, their reaction has always been: 
overwhelming stress demands overwhelming determination. That is 
because their consuming dream was to see one united nation 
living in justice and dignity; a nation that draws its strength 
from its glorious past, despite all obstacles on the road, 
severe limitations and dim prospects. And since our spirit of 
challenge will never wane, we shall remain loyal to their 
mission until the nation gains victory or we meet our Lord, the 
Creator, as martyrs, for martyrdom would make up for victory in 
the life hereafter if we failed to achieve it in our life. 
  If the response of the nation to the challenge on hand 
appeared sometimes to be weak or limited, or if destruction, 
fragmentation, poverty and hunger seemed to be spreading out of 
control, then we should not feel despondent. Rather, we should 
respond with resolve and determination to rise to the challenge 
in order to develop a modern Islamic discourse and an integrated 
model for civilized communal life which revives hope that the 
whole nation could indeed be rebuilt from within in terms of its 
thinking, orientation, vision and way of life, bearing always in 
mind the need to safeguard freedoms, the purist of knowledge, 
tolerance, and justice. 
  Dear brothers and sisters, 
  From this platform in Amman, which stands for the Arab 
cause, 
freedom and steadfastness, I say: Peace be upon Jerusalem and 
greetings of peace from Jordanians to their kinsfolk there. 
These are the Jordanians who never failed to respond to the 
call of duty dictated by blood ties and their sense of morality. 
These are the Jordanians who never lost vision of al-Aqsa 
Mosque with all the sentiments of worship, martyrdom, and pride 
it evokes in their souls. 
  Peace be upon Jerusalem of al-Faruk [Caliph 'Umar], of 
Salah-al-Din, and of al-Husayn bin-'Ali. 
  Peace be upon its rock, and the First Qiblah, the site of 
the 
Prophet's night journey and his ascension therefrom to heavens. 
  Peace be upon the church of the Holy Sepulcher. 
  Peace goes from Jordan, who takes pride as its mantle, the 
nation as its beloved one, and freedom as its wish. [applause] 
  Peace from the Jordanians whose spirit cannot be broken 
during the time of apostasy, whose heads are not bound during 
the siege, and whose steps do not go astray in times of darkness. 
  We send greetings of peace to the jewel of all the cities of 
the nation. We pray for the rest of souls of all martyrs who 
fell on its soil, of all worshipers who said their prayers in 
its mosque and churches, of all scholars who went through its 
schools. We salute all its inhabitants who are enduring the 
oppression of the occupier while struggling for its freedom and 
glory. 
  My dear brothers and sisters, 
  In closing, let me salute all of you and welcome once again 
our guests who came from several places in the large homeland of 
our nation. I should also like to pay tribute to all those who 
contributed to the renovation effort, especially the 
supervisors, designers, builders and artisans. I pray to Allah, 
the Almighty, to guide us all along the right path to win His 
satisfaction. 
  May God bring upon you one and all peace, compassion, and 
blessings.

  [Text] Following the U.S.-Jordanian tension resulting from 
the al-'Aqabah Port blockade, Crown Prince Hasan has decided to 
cancel a visit to Washington scheduled 20 April. Jordan had 
expected that the United States would decide to lift the 
blockade against ships bound for al-'Aqabah Port and allow 
inspection of ships at the port instead of accosting them on the 
high seas. 
  Jordan has already conveyed its views to the United States 
and the world and the issue has become clear and does not have 
to be discussed by the prince in Washington during the visit, 
which was scheduled one month before the outbreak of the present 
crisis. Talks during the visit were supposed to focus on certain 
economic aspects and political issues which cannot be discussed 
now before the al-'Aqabah blockade crisis is over.

  [Text] Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali said 
Jordan seeks a comprehensive peace settlement and has rejected a 
separate one because it will not be a permanent solution, and 
might also be more dangerous than having no solution at all. 
  The prime minister met today with the Jordanian journalists 
and columnists of the country's party press, and other daily 
newspapers. 
  The prime minister agreed that there could be a possible 
link 
between recent Israeli accusations to Jordan of encouraging 
terrorism and the blockade on the Gulf of Aqaba. 
  Prime Minister al-Majali indicated that Jordan is making 
contacts with a number of world countries to explain losses to 
the national economy as a result of the blockade. 
  The prime minister said Jordan believes in the need for 
further coordination among Arab parties to the peace 
negotiations with Israel. He said the Arab negotiators can be 
in a stronger position as the Arabs demonstrated a unity of 
stands. 
  The prime minister said Jordan's relationship with the 
Palestinians is very special, and the country deals with the PLO 
as the sole representative of the Palestinian people.

  [Excerpt] Nabih Birri, speaker of the Lebanese Chamber of 
Deputies, began an official visit to Jordan at the head of a 
Lebanese parliamentary delegation. His visit is aimed at 
discussing bilateral relations and the current Arab situation. 
Details are in the following report by our parliamentary 
affairs correspondent: 
  A session of Jordanian-Lebanese parliamentary talks was held 
at the Parliament today. The Jordanian side was led by Tahir 
al-Masri, speaker of the House of Representatives, and included 
members of the permanent office, heads of committees, and 
rapporteurs of the parliamentary blocs. The Lebanese side was 
led by Nabih Birri, speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, and 
included a number of deputies as well as representatives of 
leading Lebanese newspapers. 
  Tahir al-Masri said: We welcome Mr. Birri as a prominent 
national and pan-Arab figure who is playing a distinguished role 
in restoring Arab solidarity. Al-Masri said that we, in Jordan 
and Lebanon, are convinced that our democratic march and respect 
of citizens' rights constitute the basic cornerstone in the 
battle of restoring Arab rights. 
  He added that we, in Jordan, have Arab rather than Jordanian 
concerns. Jordan is unionist and Arabist. It has paid a dear 
price as a result of its pan-Arab stands and democratic march. 
  Nabih Birri, speaker of the Lebanese Chamber of Deputies, 
thanked the king and people of Jordan for not acting 
unilaterally and for paying the tax of war. 
  He said that we should return to our Arab solidarity, adding 
that the Arab cordon states --Syria. Lebanon, Jordan, and 
Palestine -- must be supported so that none of them are singled 
out. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Lebanon's Parliament Speaker Nabih Birri is now 
visiting Jordan. Shortly after arriving in Amman today, he met 
with the speaker of the Lower House of Parliament Tahir al-Masri. 
  In remarks during the meeting, al-Masri said that the Arab 
nation is facing the most difficult conditions and must unify 
its ranks to confront the challenges and dangers. He said 
Jordan and Lebanon are living through similar conditions in 
terms of their being targeted by a joint enemy and being exposed 
to foreign pressures. 
  Mr. Birri paid tribute to his majesty the king's pan-Arab 
stands and said Jordan had withstood the pressures. He called 
for closer coordination among Arab partners to the peace talks 
with Israel. 
  The Lebanese Parliament speaker is accompanied on his visit 
to Jordan by a number of Lebanese deputies and officials.

  [Text] Dr. Jawad al-'Anani, minister of information and 
minister of state for cabinet affairs, received in his office 
this morning the Lebanese media delegation accompanying Nabih 
Birri, speaker of the Lebanese Chamber of Deputies. 
  At the outset of the meeting, Dr. al-'Anani welcomed the 
delegation members and reviewed with them the distinguished 
Jordanian-Lebanese relations on various levels as well as the 
recent developments aimed at putting pressure on Jordan and 
weakening its position. 
  Al-'Anani stressed Jordan's constant principles of not 
concluding separate deals or violating the Arab consensus. He 
reasserted that Jordan will not seek any gains at the expense of 
any other Arab state. He also reviewed the economic pressures 
being put on Jordan, particularly the continued siege on the 
port of al-'Aqabah. 
  Al-'Anani emphasized that Jordan will not budge from its 
consistent and principled position, and that Jordan's 
participation in the peace talks is contingent upon finding a 
solution to the method of searches concerning the port of 
al-'Aqabah. He stressed Jordan's eagerness to coordinate with 
all parties concerned with the peace process in order to adopt a 
firm Arab position, so a just and comprehensive peace settlement 
would be achieved. Such a settlement would guarantee the rights 
of all, he added.

  [Text] Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali received 
at his office at the Parliament today Nabih Birri, speaker of 
the Lebanese Chamber of Deputies, and the delegation 
accompanying him. 
  At the outset of the meeting, Dr. al-Majali asserted that 
this country's approach has always been Arab and Islamic. 
Jordan's eagerness to promote Arab causes is equal to its 
eagerness to promote its own interests, al-Majali added. He 
went on to say: We view Lebanon as a fraternal Arab state. We 
support its causes and issues, especially given the calamities 
and attacks to which southern Lebanon has been exposed. We hope 
that Lebanon will recover and remain a strong country, a strong 
foundation contributing to the Arab nation's strength. 
  Dr. al-Majali also addressed the issue of peace, and 
Jordan's 
position toward peace efforts, as explained by His Majesty King 
Husayn. He reasserted that the solution must be just and 
comprehensive on all fronts. He added that any solution must 
ensure the restoration of all Arab rights. He went on to say 
that Jordan has pursued contacts and coordination with all 
concerned Arab parties, including the PLO, which is the 
representative of the Palestinian people, to help form a unified 
Arab stand that will help to achieve peace on the basis of 
justice and equality, a peace that will be accepted by future 
generations. 
  Dr. al-Majali underscored the need to close Arab ranks and 
unify Arab positions, since this would promote the Arab nation's 
standing and enable it to cope with its own problems and issues. 
He added that Jordan views all Arab brothers as a part of this 
nation. Besides, Jordan has been directly and effectively 
involved in problems. The most recent evidence of this is 
Jordan's accommodation of some 300,000 refugees in the aftermath 
of the Gulf war. He indicated that this, given Jordan's 
capabilities and resources, constitutes a heavy burden. 
Nonetheless, Jordan believes that their presence here is the 
outcome of difficult circumstances created by the Gulf war. 
  For his part, Nabih Birri underlined Jordan's honorable 
positions under His Majesty King Husayn toward all Arab and 
pan-Arab causes. He also underscored Jordan's support for 
Lebanon in the years of its ordeal and Jordan's help in coping 
with this ordeal. He added: Our prime concern in Lebanon is to 
achieve security and stability, which we are beginning to see. 
The Lebanese Government has drafted a plan to rebuild the 
infrastructure damaged during the internal strife. Moreover, 
there is a focus on rebuilding southern Lebanon, which has 
continued to come under constant Israeli attacks. 
  The meeting was attended by Tahir al-Masri, speaker of the 
House of Representatives; Dr. Khalid al-Zu'bi, minister of state 
for legal and parliamentary affairs; the Jordanian ambassador in 
Beirut; and the Lebanese ambassador in Amman. 
  Senate President Ahmad al-Lawzi met with the speaker of the 
Lebanese Chamber of Deputies and his delegation at the 
Parliament earlier in the day. House of Representatives Speaker 
Tahir al-Masri attended. 
  At the outset of the meeting, al-Lawzi noted that Lebanon 
has 
always provided a haven for the nation's thinkers. He noted the 
commonalities in the two countries, particularly in terms of 
their history and their efforts to establish true inter-Arab 
cooperation to promote inter-Arab integration in all spheres. 
He reaffirmed the importance of the role the Lebanese Chamber 
of Deputies can play to safeguard Lebanon and its unity to help 
it return to the forefront. He also called for honoring 
international legitimacy and implementing the UN resolutions 
pertaining to southern Lebanon, asserting Jordan's strong faith 
in true peace, peace that will restore rights to their rightful 
owners. He added that there is no alternative to a just and 
comprehensive peace that will end massacres and occupation. He 
noted that it is Israel which is sponsoring terrorism, and that 
it was Israel which occupied Arab lands and perpetrated 
killings, displacement, and settlement activities throughout the 
occupied Arab territories. He called for an end to these 
practices so that peace can be achieved in the region. 
  For his part, Nabih Birri, speaker of the Lebanese Chamber 
of 
Deputies, expressed his thanks and appreciation to His Majesty 
King Husayn, the Jordanian Government, and the Jordanian people. 
He underlined the strong Jordanian-Lebanese relations in all 
spheres. 
  Nabih Birri added: Jordan does not need to absolve itself of 
any alleged terrorism, particularly since everybody is well 
aware of His Majesty King Husayn's moderation, patience, 
shrewdness, wisdom, and intelligence. Everybody is well aware 
that Jordan has paid a high price for terrorism. He wondered: 
Is the person who acts in defense of his territories, homeland, 
and rights an extremist terrorist? By contrast, can the party 
that occupied another's territory by force, and displaces its 
population and owners be called a non-terrorist? 
  Birri continued: It is no coincidence that Israel is 
perpetrating terrorism in southern Lebanon and accusing Jordan 
of terror. He recalled the killing of innocent civilians at the 
Ibrahimi Mosque, wondering: What can this be called? Was it a 
premeditated act, planned a long time ago? What is the daily 
shelling of Lebanese cities and the displacement of their 
residents called? 
  Birri asserted that we are engaged in acts of self-defense, 
whereas the Israelis have fostered terrorism. He indicated that 
without a just and comprehensive peace in the region, the 
phenomenon they call terrorism will spread. He wondered: How 
can you blame me when you push me too far? 
  Birri urged the Arab nation to unify its ranks. He indicated 
that the current Arab state of affairs is the result of its 
weakness and disunity. He reiterated that the pressure put on 
Jordan and the threats made against its stability and security 
are designed to make it conclude a unilateral deal so that it 
may be dissociated from Lebanon and Syria. The same goes for 
Lebanon and the attempts to make it sign a unilateral deal with 
the Zionist entity. He reaffirmed the seriousness of concluding 
such unilateral deals, because this would undermine the 
inalienable legitimate rights of the parties concerned. 
  At the end of the meeting, which was attended by members of 
the Lebanese and Jordanian delegations, the two sides held a 
lengthy discussion on the current Arab state of affairs, issues 
of common interest between the two fraternal states, and mutual 
coordination. They said that the pressure applied to Jordan does 
not frighten us, particularly since similar pressure has been 
applied in the past. 
  The Jordanian and Lebanese sides reaffirmed the importance 
of 
national unity, indicating that it is the most effective means 
of resistance. 
  During the meeting, the two sides discussed the issue of 
forming a Jordanian-Lebanese parliamentary committee that could 
be expanded in the future to include other nations. The purpose 
of this committee would be to examine the potential of current 
developments.

  [Text] His Majesty King Husayn received at Raghadan Palace 
today Nabih Birri, speaker of the Lebanese Chamber of Deputies, 
and his delegation. The meeting was attended by His Highness 
Crown Prince Hasan. 
  His majesty held a closed meeting, attended by the crown 
prince, with Nabih Birri, followed by an expanded meeting 
attended by a number of officials from both sides. 
  At the outset of the meeting, his majesty welcomed Birri and 
his delegation and emphasized importance of such meetings on all 
legislative and political levels in Arab countries, and the need 
to intensify these meetings in the service of the causes of the 
Arab nation and to lead the nation toward its aspirations. 
  His majesty emphasized the importance of continuous contacts 
between political leaderships and the need to intensify efforts 
in a manner that realizes serious and constructive coordination 
between the Arab countries to the peace process, because this 
continuous coordination is a national and pan-Arab interest to 
which all should adhere. 
  For his part, Birri stressed the appreciation of the 
Lebanese 
people for His majesty King Husayn's pan-Arab and honorable 
positions and his eagerness to support the brotherly Lebanese 
people and the Lebanese leadership in defending the just 
Lebanese cause. He expressed admiration of the wise leadership 
of His Majesty King Husayn and his positions on various crucial 
pan-Arab issues. 
  The meeting was attended by 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali, prime 
minister; His Excellency al-Sharif Zayd Bin-Shakir, chief of the 
Royal Hashemite Court; Ahmad al-Lawzi, Senate president; Tahir 
al-Masri, speaker of the House of Representatives; advisers of 
his majesty the king; the Jordanian ambassador in Beirut; and 
Deputy 'Abd-al-Hadi al-Majali, head of the Foreign Affairs 
Committee at the House of Representatives. 
  On the Lebanese side, the meeting was attended by Deputy 
Asmar Asmar, Deputy 'Ali Mita, Deputy Astafan al-Duayhi, Deputy 
'Ala' al-Din, and the Lebanese ambassador in Amman. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] We know how 
much you love Lebanon and its people. What can say after this 
meeting with Speaker Birri and the parliamentary delegation? 
  [Husayn] This meeting is a blessed one. The beloved members 
of the delegation are now in their second homeland, and I am 
happy to have this chance to welcome my brothers. The hopes and 
aspirations of both sides are the same. We are the closest to 
each other among the Arabs. We pray God that henceforth, the 
march of real coordination and cooperation will resume. We have 
great expectations that wider Arab coordination and cooperation 
will take place in these difficult circumstances and in face of 
the challenges. There is much love for Lebanon in the hearts of 
all Jordanians from various origins. We are proud of our 
strong, brotherly, and continuous relations with God's care. 
  [Correspondent] Your Majesty, Speaker Birri described you as 
the most patient Arab leader. How do you view the future of 
this region, especially Lebanon and Jordan? 
  [Husayn] This is nice coming from my brother, and it is an 
honor to me and to Jordan. In fact, these circumstances require 
patience. But on the other hand, we feel that these 
circumstances will not continue in terms of our suffering in the 
whole of the Arab world. Therefore, we are patient and we wait 
for a real awakening and a serious and meaningful Arab move. We 
believe in the Arab individual and that it is inevitable that he 
will have the right to live and will attain all his rights in 
his greater Arab homeland. 
  [Correspondent] Thank you Your Majesty. 
  [Husayn] Thank you. [end recording]

  [Text] The Jordanian-Iraqi relations have sharply 
deteriorated recently, particularly after the assassination of a 
prominent Iraqi opposition figure, Shaykh Talib al-Suhayl, by 
Iraqi diplomats in Beirut. His majesty's cable of condolences 
to the family of the deceased carried clear denunciation of the 
assassination. His majesty said that he "received the news with 
indignation and disgust," and that "it was perpetrated by 
vicious hands which derive their ability to commit evil from 
sick hearts that have been so blinded by hatred that they are 
accustomed to shedding innocent blood, forgetting that nothing 
will save them from the wrath of man and God." 
  The killing of Shaykh al-Suhayl, who carried the Jordanian 
and Saudi nationalities and who is known for his friendship with 
his majesty the king and the Hashemites in Iraq, has put an end 
to the Jordanian-Iraqi attempts over the past two weeks to 
revive the Baghdad-Amman ties after a long period of stagnation 
and after Saudi Arabia insisted on its position and closed all 
doors of reconciliation with Jordan, which exerted tremendous 
efforts to mend fences. 
  Dr. Sa'id al-Tall, the Jordanian deputy prime minister, went 
to Iraq last week on a visit that was not officially announced, 
carrying a special message from the king to Saddam Husayn. The 
message stressed Jordan's concern to restrengthen the 
Iraqi-Jordanian relations and face the U.S. pressures directed 
against Jordan through the continuation of the unjust blockade 
of al-'Aqabah port. 
  President Saddam Husayn sent a reply which was brought to 
Amman by the Iraqi Information Minister Hamid Hammadi a few days 
ago. The Iraqi president welcomed the king's proposals and 
voiced Iraq's readiness to resume joint cooperation in the 
political and economic domains. 
  However, the Iraqi information minister's visit to Jordan 
started a crisis with Jordan instead of effecting channels of 
contacts between the two countries. This is because of the way 
the Jordanian media reported the visit, describing the Iraqi 
official as envoy of the Iraqi leadership in contrast with the 
Iraqi media description of him as President Saddam Husayn's 
envoy. 
  In order to ascertain if this allusion to the minister was 
an 
intentional move by the Jordanian decisionmakers or a media 
contrivance, the Iraqi side made contacts on all levels and was 
convinced that this was done by the Jordanian decisionmakers who 
wanted to officially ignore Iraqi President Saddam Husayn and 
depict Jordan as dealing with an Iraqi leadership and an Iraqi 
people. 
  This crisis could have been contained if al-Suhayl had not 
been assassinated on the same day the Iraqi president's envoy 
arrived in Amman. Accusations were leveled at the Iraqi 
leadership based on the fact the he was a prominent Iraqi 
opposition figure. Al-Suhayl left Baghdad in 1958 following the 
14 July revolution. He held Jordanian and Saudi nationalities 
and his name was recently mentioned as the mastermind behind the 
assassination attempt against President Saddam Husayn revealed 
by the U.S. press recently.

  [Text] Army has foiled yet another bid by Pakistani 
infiltrators to smuggle in a large quantity of arms and 
ammunition through the northern sector into the Kashmir state. 
A Defense Ministry spokesman told newsmen in Srinagar that this 
is the biggest cache of arms recovered so far this year. It 
includes 32,000 rounds of ammunition, 92 hand grenades, 203 
antipersonnel mines and a large quantity of incriminating 
documents. A massive hunt has been launched to trace the arms 
couriers. Meanwhile, security forces launched a huge search 
operation this morning in the Batmalu area and adjoining 
localities to nab militants. 
  Elsewhere in the state, 10 militants have been killed during 
the past 24 hours. Of these three were killed in intergang 
rivalry.

  [Text] The Government of India views the recent escalation 
of tension in Bosnia and Herzegovina and specifically around 
Gorazde with deep concern. The lives of innocent citizens and 
UN peace-keepers have once again come under unwarranted threat. 
A ceasefire must be put in place and respected and the peace 
process resumed without delay so that there can be movement 
towards a political settlement which is irreversible and 
acceptable to all parties. The Government of India calls upon 
all parties to the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina to eschew 
the futile pursuit of a military solution as this only results 
in endless bloodshed which is abhorrent to the international 
community. We call for the immediate resumption of the process 
of negotiations.

  [Text] Parliament will today take up discussion on the new 
World Trade Treaty to replace the GATT agreement. This will 
follow a suo moto statement by the government in both the houses 
of Parliament today. The parliamentary affairs minister, Mr. 
V.C. Shukla, told our correspondent that this was decided in the 
speaker's chamber yesterday in the presence of the leaders of 
the opposition. 
  The prime minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, has defended the 
signing of the treaty by India. He asserted that the 
opposition's criticism against the government for taking the 
step will be warded off. Speaking at a function after 
presenting G.D. Birla awards for scientific research in New 
Delhi yesterday, he said that the Indian economy should be 
integrated with the world economy. This, he said, cannot be 
achieved without science and technology in the country 
integrating with that in the world. The awards were received by 
Dr. Masilkar and Professor Raghuwamsh. The awards carry 1 lakh 
rupees each. 
  Addressing the annual session of the Confederation of Indian 
Industry, [Commerce Minister] Mr. Pranab Mukherjee said the 
agreement provides both challenges and opportunities to step up 
the export of agricultural products and textiles.

  [Text] A new laser-based simulator system has been designed 
by the BHEL [Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited] at Bangalore. It 
will be used by the defense and paramilitary forces for training 
exercises without using live ammunition. 
  [Begin correspondent recording] With the use of IWESS, that 
is the Infantry Weapon Effect Simulator System, the defense as 
well as police department and other paramilitary forces have 
found a way of training their forces systematically without 
wasting ammunition and definitely without any harm or loss of 
life. The IWESS is a laser-based system which simulates the 
effect of small arms, live-fire in field exercises. It gives 
the [word indistinct] the realism of being able to accurately 
use his personal weapons in a two-sided exercise. At the same 
time, it provides immediate feedback on effectiveness of his own 
fire position, weapons [word indistinct] and use of ground 
cover. The electronics division of Bharat Heavy Electricals, 
Bangalore has diversified into the manufacture of this simulator 
system of various types for defense application. The equipment 
can be used for a wide range of weapons and will operate when 
fitted with a blank firing attachment. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Article by 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Haydari and Faysal Makram in </F>
Sanaa and Iqbal 'Ali 'Abdallah in Aden] 
  [Excerpts] Responsible political sources in Sanaa yesterday 
expressed their fear that Prime Minister Haydar Abu-Bakr 
al-'Attas' visit to the United States for medical treatment is a 
political maneuver to impede the government sessions in Sanaa. 
[passage omitted] 
  Yemeni political quarters in Sanaa and Aden considered the 
sudden departure of al-'Attas, prime minister and member of the 
Political Bureau of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], an evasion 
from holding the Yemeni Government meetings expected to resume 
in Sanaa next Wednesday [20 April]. The cabinet held a session 
in Aden three weeks ago and in Ta'izz one week ago. 
  These quarters say that the sudden departure of al-'Attas 
for 
medical treatment in the United States arouses suspicion, 
especially since the members of his government knew nothing 
about his trip for treatment, which he began the day before 
yesterday following his meeting in Aden with U.S. Ambassador to 
Yemen Arthur Hughes. 
  Yemeni political quarters, including members of the dialogue 
committee, expressed extreme concern about what it terms as 
al-'Attas' attempt to abort the role of the Yemeni coalition 
government in implementing the accord document and to abort the 
efforts aimed at reunifying the constitutional institutions in 
Sanaa. These quarters linked al-'Attas' trip with the visit to 
Britain by Salim Salih Muhammad, member of the YSP Political 
Bureau and the Presidential Council, following his Arab tour. 
The quarters considered this an evasion on the part of the YSP 
from the commitment to reunify the institutions in Sanaa, 
particularly the Presidential Council and the Cabinet. The 
Presidential Council was expected to convene in Sanaa in the 
presence of Salim Salih Muhammad following his Arab tour, during 
which he conveyed messages from YSP Secretary General 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid to a number of Arab leaders. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Salim Salih Muhammad, member of the Yemeni </F>
Presidential Council and assistant secretary general of the 
Yemeni Socialist Party, by Tawfiq Jazulit; place and date not 
given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Jazulit] Brother Salim Salih Muhammad: We talk to 
you, as YSP [Yemeni Socialist Party] secretary general and 
member of the Yemeni Presidential Council, when Yemeni unity is 
experiencing a stifling crisis. That is why I want this 
dialogue to be frank. We hope we can learn what goes on in the 
mind of the YSP leadership. As you know, Yemen has just seen 
the Salalah meeting. Some believe it failed. Why did that 
meeting fail? 
  [Muhammad] Welcome to you and to MBC, which is putting 
Yemen's worries in front of the Yemenis and Arabs. The Yemeni 
issue interests not only the Yemenis, but all the Arabs and the 
world. This is due to what Yemen stands for and to its location 
in addition to the issue of unity and how to achieve it. This 
is a pan-Arab and national goal. Unity was peacefully, 
voluntarily, and democratically achieved in an approach contrary 
to that which was hitherto pursued and that believed that Yemeni 
unity could only be achieved through war. 
  We appreciate the feelings of our Arab nation, our friends, 
and our people. We must be frank when it comes to presenting 
the issues, hardships, and challenges the process of unity is 
encountering. 
  Everybody followed up the signing of the Pledge and Accord 
Document and the political dialogues held earlier to create it. 
There were domestic, Arab, and friendly efforts that helped 
Yemen, its parties, and its political mentality to work out that 
document. 
  This document stands for the collective aspiration common to 
all parties and categories in Yemen today. Everyone is 
convinced of its stipulations, although some are opposed to it 
or have some reservations about it. But it represents the 
national program, which everybody tries to implement in his own 
way. That is why there were various interpretations, 
particularly after the document was signed in fraternal Jordan, 
and why difficulties were encountered during that meeting. 
  There were efforts to arrange a meeting between the brother 
president and his vice president to halt the military 
developments that ensued, most notably on the day the document 
was signed. These developments have become the primary issues; 
they take priority over the issues specified by the document. 
The first issue in that document was the security problem, 
which has lately experienced many developments. This issue has 
not been tackled. Hence the Salalah meeting. 
  I can frankly say that the phrasing was not carried out in 
the desired manner. There was no paper specifying the nature 
and agenda of the meeting. We hoped the meeting would be held 
to halt military developments, eliminate barriers and, thus, 
reverse any development leading to [word indistinct] in Yemen. 
  [Jazulit] There are questions regarding implementation of 
the Pledge and Accord Document that you all signed in Amman. 
The opposition accuses the YSP of resorting to particular 
political tactics to avoid signing and implementing it. This 
stance is clear in one case: An agreement was reached within 
the framework of the national dialogue committee to attend--in 
your capacity as a member of the Presidential Council--a meeting 
of the Presidential Council in Sanaa at the same time as a 
Cabinet meeting in Aden chaired by Abu-Bakr al-'Attas. You 
agreed to attend the meeting but then you changed your mind. 
This seemed to be the reason for [words indistinct]. What are 
the real reasons for not responding to the national dialogue 
committee decision regarding your meeting in Sanaa? 
  [Muhammad] It is a Yemeni characteristic that sometimes, the 
opposition and the authorities agree fully or differ to the 
point of [word indistinct]. Our party has good relations with 
the opposition political parties. Our party was the first to 
raise the idea of broadening the political dialogue. You may 
remember that the parties of the coalition insisted on solving 
their problems within the framework of the ruling coalition. 
Our party broached this idea to expand the dialogue and 
political and popular participation in this committee. The 
opposition joined this committee. We made a decision that any 
agreement reached by this committee would be binding [words 
indistinct]. When we attended the Amman meeting, which was 
attended by Jordanian brothers, notably His Majesty King Husayn, 
the Yemeni president and vice president, and the opposition 
parties, of whom I remember Shaykh [name indistinct], Shaykh 
Mujhid Abu-Shawarib, and the Reform Grouping secretary general 
[sentence incomplete as heard] At this one meeting, which 
failed, the YSP proposed a working paper relating to the 
Document of Pledge and Accord to implement it according to a 
timetable and mechanism. The working paper was rejected by our 
brothers in the General People's Congress. So we differed and 
afterward the paper was submitted to the national dialogue 
committee. This paper includes interrelated issues. At its 
meeting in Aden, the national dialogue committee approved every 
measure relating to security. The committee formulated its 
views and submitted its recommendations. Afterward, when the 
committee discussed merging the institutions, it automatically 
approved my attending the Presidential Council meeting. I 
received no agenda, although discussion of the document should 
be instructed by the Council of Ministers. The main issue for 
us was implementation of the document. We believe the security 
issue is the main thing and the practical approach to 
normalizing (?relations). If this issue is settled, then the 
institutions in both parts of Yemen can be merged and things 
will return to normal. But this has not materialized. You hear 
daily that security is worrisome, particularly in the capital. 
There is indeed a need for intensive and bold efforts to help 
us normalize security. First, we must hand over the personnel 
who disturbed security and those who stand behind them to the 
judiciary to issue its verdict. This issue relates to the 
normalization of relations. The situation in the establishment 
charged with security must be corrected. If not, this 
establishment will not help to restore security. As things 
stand, this establishment cannot perform its duty. We can 
attend any meeting and participate in any effort to address this 
issue. Otherwise the situation will remain the same [words 
indistinct] and ignore the document. 
  [Jazulit] So as far as you are concerned, the current 
security situation is a barrier to realizing unity as stipulated 
by the Amman agreement. Some believe the situation the Yemenis 
are experiencing has nothing to do with unity. First, your 
party leadership sits in Aden. You have left Sanaa, the 
capital. You have not united either the Army or the currency. 
So you are not experiencing unity, but division, which has 
become a fait accompli. What is left of this unity? 
  [Muhammad] The only thing left is popular unity. There is 
movement between the two parts. But I agree with you that the 
army is divided and that there are two currencies, two capitals, 
and two administrations. These are the conditions that prompted 
us to review the course of our unity. This is the suffering 
that has made us propose 18 points, participate in formulating 
the document effectively, and attempt to present the issues of 
the people. We do not know what sort of unity we are in. Some 
propose that we must formulate a merger unity. We believe the 
situation needs to be rectified and reviewed. This is why we 
have tried very hard to have the Pledge and Accord Document 
contain all the issues that lead to rectifying this course. 
This is a course that has not made us feel unity, except in the 
united anthem and flag, and sometimes in the united 
representation in the [word indistinct]. This is why the 
document must be implemented. We know time will not help us. 
The crisis will create harsh conditions if it continues too 
long, like this. [words indistinct] I personally believe that 
things will become even more complicated. 
  [Jazulit] Within the framework of the negative repercussions 
of unity in Yemen, you, the leadership of the YSP in Aden, 
suspect that religious extremism will increase. Do you not 
believe your party is responsible for the failure of unity in 
Yemen, as is the GPC [General People's Congress], which was your 
ally in making the unity decision between the two parts, the 
north and the south. The failure of your party and the GPC 
dissatisfied the Yemeni people. It also helped to develop 
extremism in Yemen. How could you reconcile between the process 
of solving the unity problem in Yemen and confronting extremism, 
as you called it, while you are the ones responsible for this 
problem? 
  [Muhammad] Our party is undoubtedly responsible 
historically, 
whether in working to establish unity among the Yemeni people or 
in the failure of this unity. Undoubtedly, our party is a 
partner and participant in this historic process. But the truth 
that has been confirmed by fact--and no one can refute it--is 
that the party has played its role in trying to preserve this 
unity. It presented a great deal. In my evaluation, there is 
no party in power in this day and age, according to my modest 
information, that pays daily, in martyrs and dead from among its 
cadres and leaders, while acting as an essential participant in 
power. It enjoys leadership in the Army and the Administration. 
This party can also do the same things. But the party has 
categorically stated that going down such a route is fatal and 
cannot solve problems. This is why we have tried, since unity 
was established, not to be dragged into this conflict. 
  Of course, some sides may have felt the party was weak. They 
played some [word indistinct] cards. They thought these cards 
could realize greater gains for them, not only in dissolving the 
unity of the party, but also in weakening the relationship 
between the party and its supporters. So they started resorting 
to various methods, which I do not have the time to explain in 
detail here. In general, I believe that in light of the 
circumstances of Yemen and our limited potential, we have done 
everything within our means to maintain unity and allow it to 
succeed. We have done everything to start the course of 
democracy, which is the new phenomenon in our life, whether with 
regard to Yemen or the Arab region. 
  Proceeding from this, I believe that dialogue with the 
Reform 
Grouping is one of the issues that concern the party. We 
believed that through this course and our attempts to gather all 
the political currents and set aside all their programs, views, 
and differences, we could, in light of the situation in Yemen, 
the unity, and the people's aspirations, create what we have 
called the Yemeni character, the Yemeni edition. This consists 
of making the left, the right, and the center start united 
coalition action [words indistinct]. We have tried to learn 
from the Algerian lesson. We have tried to learn from our 
mistakes. We have also tried to do something new that can be 
added to the unity and democracy process we have started. 
Unfortunately, there are some mentalities that are below such 
levels of thinking. They have harmed unity, democracy, and the 
outstretched hands. They started adopting two kinds of 
terrorism: physical terrorism represented in cutting off roads, 
killing people, and creating a state of terrorism and mental 
terrorism, judging people as heretics and issuing fatwas on 
agents, as well as resorting to the mind-set of the sixties and 
seventies, which consists of falsely accusing others if they do 
not agree with their opinion. 
  Thus, we bear our responsibility toward rectifying the 
situation and toward the mistakes and emotions affecting us in 
realizing unity quickly and without any settling of accounts. 
We went to Sanaa with one thing in mind--that the others are of 
a particular standard. But time has proven that this standard, 
unfortunately, is not there. 
  [Jazulit] A trend within your party says that YSP Secretary 
General 'Ali Salim al-Bid unilaterally decided to go ahead with 
the unification process. This same trend is now opposing the 
continuation of unity saying that the circumstances are still 
not right. How influential is this trend within the YSP? 
  [Muhammad] We are a real party, one that interacts with its 
members and leaders. Any decision is made through the party's 
institutions ... 
  [Jazulit, interrupting] Is it true that al-Bid made the 
unity 
decision unilaterally? 
  [Muhammad] It was not a unilateral decision. As you know, 
unity was one of the party's concerns and strategic issues when 
it was in power in the south. The same applied to the other 
part in the north [words indistinct]. Our leadership was 
united. For us, unity will remain a fateful issue. But what 
kind of unity do we want? The YSP formed a team that continued 
to study the issue for one year. The team made recommendations 
and proposals regarding unity. It offered several options, 
including a federation and a confederation. But developments 
and circumstances dictated that policy, namely, that we sign the 
30 November agreement and adopt the existing Constitution, which 
we are still adopting. The YSP secretary general made no 
unilateral decision, as some people are claiming; the decision 
was made through consultations with the leadership--the 
Political Bureau [words indistinct], and the Central Committee. 
I remember that day when brother President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih 
came to Aden and was received by brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid. The 
Central Committee of our party was in session and we were 
discussing that particular subject. We in the YSP make no 
unilateral decisions; we always refer to the party's 
institutions when we make fateful and important decisions. 
  [Jazulit] You did not answer the essence of my question, 
brother Salim Salih Muhammad. There is undoubtedly a trend 
within your party saying that unity cannot continue because the 
circumstances are not ripe. How strong is this trend on the 
level of the leadership, the cadres, and the members of the 
party? 
  [Muhammad] I am not exaggerating if I say that our situation 
has never been better as far as trends, wings, and blocs are 
concerned. We are now in agreement on national issues more than 
ever. We have no trends against these issues, among the 
leaders, or the base. But opinions are expressed by this person 
or that or this group of brothers or that. Now we are expanding 
democracy in the life of the party and society. We are dealing 
with things through dialogue and we make decisions through 
dialogue. What is happening now is that some people are 
proposing rectifying unity's course. They express their views 
and we discuss them within the framework of the party's 
institutions. These days, we are discussing a host of issues in 
the Central Committee. We are trying to find the right thing 
and convince each other about the best formula the party should 
offer and deal with [words indistinct]. We must not restrict 
ourselves or reject opposing views regarding these issues 
because we do not want to repeat past mistakes. We, therefore, 
accommodate this [word indistinct] and do not have trends in the 
old sense of the word, that is, that a particular trend has a 
particular opinion and will triumph and the other trend will 
lose. All the trends must coexist within dialogue to formulate 
the right position for the party. 
  [Jazulit] Arab mediation has been expanding. What is the 
essence of this mediation? 
  [Muhammad] From the beginning, we have welcomed every 
initiative by our Arab brothers. We deal with this mediation. 
At first, the Jordanian and Omani brothers helped, whether 
through the military committee or the political dialogue. The 
initiatives produced the known results. I would like to thank 
the Omani and Jordanian brothers and also the friends, whether 
[words indistinct] for their role in defusing tension and 
calming the military situation. But the crisis was 
oversimplified, and this is perhaps what foiled the meetings and 
efforts. We insist on an intensive Arab role. We do not feel 
shy about saying that the brothers in Saudi Arabia are concerned 
with Yemen's developments, and we ask for their help. The 
brothers in Oman, the Gulf states, Egypt, Syria, Jordan and all 
Arab countries are also concerned. Yemen is part of the region, 
and what happens here concerns the Arab brothers. Arab efforts 
should be effectively redoubled, first, to prevent a civil war 
that would have dire consequences for the Yemeni people and 
unity [word indistinct], and second, to help normalize the 
situation. The security issue is integrated: Yemen is facing 
an organized international terrorism practiced by the 
international fundamentalist movement, which has its centers and 
sources of finance. So what happens in Yemen does not concern 
Yemen alone. [Words indistinct] Yemen began to export some 
trouble to fraternal and friendly countries. 
  [Jazulit] In view of the unity crisis and its 
complications, some alternatives have been proposed. I remember 
that when the crisis started you proposed the alternative of 
federalism. This option was strongly opposed by the GPC and the 
Islamic Reform Grouping. Now you are again proposing 
federalism. Where does federalism stand now as an alternative to 
the Yemeni crisis? 
  [Muhammad] This idea should have been discussed. When we 
proposed this idea, before the document was signed, it was 
supposed to be an alternative that could have been discussed. 
When I was asked about it, I said that we are ready and willing 
to discuss any alternative that could rectify the course of the 
country and the situation in it, including the issue of 
federalism. Of course, the thinking prevalent among the older 
generations is fixed in many ways. If there is a warning or 
statement that does not agree with the accepted concepts 
imprinted in the Arab political mind, they will automatically 
reject it and categorize it into different things. Therefore, 
this idea was buried right from the start. We know that the 
document [word indistinct] addressed some 70-80 percent of this 
issue in my estimation ... 
  [Jazulit, interrupting] What do you mean? How come? 
  [Muhammad] The document addresses the issue of provinces for 
local government. In Yemen, we could have anywhere between four 
and seven provinces. They have full powers, except for judicial 
authority and nominating portfolios for the Cabinet. The 
federal situation or the known unity conditions--I do not want 
to delve into detailed explanations; I will neglect its legal 
aspects and the characteristics that could [words 
indistinct]--led us to understand that there will be local 
governments. There is also a general framework for maintaining 
the sovereignty of the homeland, Yemeni patriotism, the united 
economy, and legislation. There are all these issues. We are 
really trying to strengthen this unity as we explained at the 
beginning of the interview and to clarify its various aspects. 
It is truly regrettable. The document was set out and now, as 
a party, we are proposing that the real introduction to 
realizing this goal is possibly local government and [words 
indistinct]. As I said, the inherent contents of this document 
are the federal unity that we proposed. 
  [Jazulit] Let us go back to the beginning of the crisis. The 
Amman summit failed. Then the Salalah meeting failed. There 
are preparations now for a summit that might convene in Cairo 
during the coming few weeks. Has a date been set for this 
meeting or for such a summit? 
  [Muhammad] There is no invitation to such a meeting or 
summit. But there are calm and important preparations to avoid 
making the same mistake as previous preparation, such as in 
Amman and [word indistinct]. 
  [Jazulit] Is there a bilateral agreement between the YSP and 
the GPC over points on which to agree before going to Cairo so 
that you do not fall into the same trap you fell into in Amman, 
for example? 
  [Muhammad] We feel that the Egyptian and the United Arab 
Emirates [UAE] roles, as well as the Arab role, despite [words 
indistinct] political presence, and even though some Arab 
countries rule out implementation of any decisions--the Arab 
role has clearly tried to politically support the Egyptian and 
UAE roles--have been trying from the beginning to diagnose the 
issues. At the same time, they work on proposing solutions and 
preparing for a meeting that will really be a success. We 
believe this is good work. 
  [Jazulit] You continue to ask the Arab countries in general 
to work on salvaging what can be salvaged from Yemeni unity. 
This is something you have confirmed often. What are the 
concessions that the YSP could make to guarantee the 
continuation of unity and its success? We mean building the 
structures of unity. You must make some concessions if you 
really want unity. What are the concessions that you might make 
if you go to Cairo for a meeting? 
  [Muhammad] Our party has made every possible concession, 
especially big concessions. It abandoned power; it went to 
Sanaa. 
  [Jazulit] But you are still in power. 
  [Muhammad] What power are you talking about ... 
  [Jazulit] You, in Aden, are still in power, as is the 
president in Sanaa. 
  [Muhammad] You know the situation we are in. All those 
inside and outside Yemen know our situation. Our party, as I 
said, might have worked and sacrificed for the big aim or it 
might have committed a naive political act. But all this is not 
very important. We are very ready to make concessions and to 
have a new government for example. We are ready to work to 
rectify issues. We are ready to concede our right as 
individuals or a party but we cannot make concessions over 
issues that define the fate of unity and the future of the 
generations. This is a matter over which we can make no 
concessions. If we made any concessions over it, we would be 
abandoning our credibility toward our people, our friends, and 
everyone. 
  [Jazulit] Do you believe that the awaited Cairo summit could 
yield some positive results if you make use of the negative 
aspects of the Amman and Salalah summits? 
  [Muhammad] There are efforts we appreciate a great deal. We 
address them and interact with them, not just on our level. We 
also try to exchange trust with other parties so as to render 
these Arab efforts a success. I believe the Egyptian and other 
brothers now have a comprehensive analysis of the nature of the 
crisis. They could help Yemen overcome the stage of fighting as 
a first step. After that, we need to work jointly with everyone 
and all the parties to bury such thinking. Second, we can start 
rectifying the course of unity, which would calm the various 
parties. 
  [Jazulit] We thank you for this meeting.

  [Text] Bosnia-Herzegovina President Alia Izetbegovic today 
sent a message to the president of our country from Sarajevo. 
The text of this message is as follows: 
  Your Excellency Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani, president of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran. 
  Dear Mr. President: I am sure that Your Excellency is aware 
of the tragedy that has befallen the inhabitants of Gorazde. 
The Serbian Army, which for the past two years, before the eyes 
of the world, has committed barbaric crimes in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, is at the moment laying siege to a city that 
has 70,000 inhabitants, most of whom are women and children. 
The people of that city are desperately awaiting the assistance 
of international organizations. 
  Dear brother, at the most difficult and hard times, the 
Iranian people and Government have been with us and have helped 
us. Therefore, we will never feel alone. We are confident that 
you and the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran will make 
every effort to defend the inhabitants of Gorazde and to prevent 
their destruction [soqut-e hasti], in view of the spiritual 
values which we adhere to. 
  Our faith and certainty in the brotherly assistance of Iran 
gives us the confidence to remain steadfast during these very 
critical moments. 
  May the merciful and compassionate God protect you with his 
blessings. With the most sincere greetings, 
  [Signed] Alia Izetbegovic

  [Text] President Hashemi-Rafsanjani spoke by phone with 
Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic, and in response to his 
written mesage, talked about the latest situation in the 
conflict areas, especially in Gorazde. 
  In this telephone conversation, our president, referring to 
the deep sorrow of the officials and members of the public, from 
the esteemed leader of the Islamic Revolution down to the 
Government and the people of Iran, for the bitter and painful 
events of Bosnia, which are taking place in front of the 
indifferent eyes of the world, said: When the United Nations 
refused the offer of the Islamic Republic of Iran to dispatch 
forces to defend the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the areas 
that had been declared as safe havens by the same organization, 
the Iranian people realized that international organizations and 
countries are not serious in their claims of defending the 
defenseless people of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The president added: Now that the United Nations has openly 
declared its inability to defend the wronged Bosnian nation, the 
Islamic Republic of Iran is prepared to send forces to the areas 
under the supervision of that organization and to defend the 
rights of the Muslim Bosnian people. Iran also welcomes the 
assistance of other countries. 
  Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani also asked the president of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina to convey the greetings and feelings of 
sympathy of the Iranian people to the oppressed Bosnian people. 
They should regard the Islamic Republic of Iran as a partner in 
their affliction and they should be assured that, as far as 
possible, the Iranian Government and people will not desert them 
in their struggle to achieve their legitimate rights.

  [Text] The foreign minister contacted the UN secretary 
general by telephone last night and reiterated the Islamic 
Republic's readiness to dispatch forces to Bosnia. Velayati 
criticized the UN's policies and asked Butrus-Ghali: Is the 
fall of Gorazde not a prologue to the Serbs' attacks on other 
safe havens and the repetition of the Gorazde tragedy in vaster 
dimensions? 
  In answer to the criticisms by the Islamic Republic's 
foreign 
minister, the UN secretary general spoke about his efforts to 
solve the Bosnian problem, saying that he tried to encourage 
influential countries in the Security Council to defend Gorazde 
but that he failed. Butrus-Ghali promised to inform the 
Security Council of Iran's reiteration of its readiness to 
dispatch forces to Bosnia. 
  Minutes ago we contacted Velayati and asked him to comment 
on 
his contacts last night with the UN secretary general. Velayati 
said: Because of our repeated statements that we are ready to 
dispatch forces to Bosnia, Butrus-Ghali was mentally ready for 
this and promised that after holding talks with the Security 
Council members tonight he will inform us of the outcome of his 
steps concerning Iran's readiness to dispatch forces. 
  The second question we put to Velayati was: Two days ago the 
UN secretary general said that the only solution to the Bosnian 
problem is through talks. But in his remarks to you last night, 
he said that the Security Council members are not replying 
positively to his efforts for a military effort in Gorazde. 
There is a contradiction in these two stances. 
  In answer, Velayati described the future steps to be taken 
by 
our country as far as the Bosnian crisis is concerned: 
  [Begin Velayati recording] He [Butrus-Ghali] added last 
night that he has asked NATO to act but NATO has refrained. Of 
course, there is no doubt that the United Nations has displayed 
its inability in this field. Unfortunately, this organization 
and especially the Security Council has been transformed into a 
forum where big powers exercise their influence on it in order 
to fulfill their own intentions, and the innocent people in 
hotbeds become victims of the greed of influential powers in the 
Security Council. 
  Of course Mr. Butrus-Ghali has not used the power that the 
UN 
Charter has given him. On the basis of Article 99 of the UN 
Charter, when the Security Council is unable or unwilling to 
take a serious step to preserve world security and peace, the 
secretary general can use the UN tribune to call for help from 
world public opinion to overcome the specific problem that is 
threatening peace and security in some part of the world. But 
Mr. Butrus-Ghali has not made use of this power. 
  I told him last night: I want to know your opinion because 
after my conversation with you I intend to call the Islamic 
Conference Organization [ICO] secretary general and the 
Pakistani foreign minister who is the current president of the 
ICO and some others in order to organize the steps to be taken 
by Islamic countries. I want to know your opinion; and these 
are the next steps that we plan to take. 
  In tandem with our conversation, [Iranian UN representative] 
Dr. Kharrazi informed us from New York that he attended the 
contact group session there and that he proposed that the 
foreign ministers of the ICO contact group hold an emergency 
session in New York and call for presence in the Security 
Council to seriously discuss the issue at the Security Council. 
[end recording] 
  Minutes ago, IRNA reported from the United Nations that the 
UN secretary general discussed Iran's readiness to dispatch 
forces [to Bosnia] with Security Council members and that as 
usual, the Security Council did not make any decision on this.

  [Text] Our country's Foreign Ministry has issued a 
statement in the wake of the bestial attacks launched by the 
Serbs against the Muslim-inhabited town of Gorazde and the 
accompanying silence of the international forums. The statement 
criticizes the United Nations for holding back from forcing the 
Serbs to abide by the international regulations and accuses the 
United Nations of playing a part in the crimes committed by the 
Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The statement says: Iran considers the United Nation's 
inability to carry out its duties as unjustifiable and once 
again calls on that organization's secretary general to accept 
the Islamic countries' proposal to dispatch troops to Bosnia and 
attempt to lift the arms embargo against that country's 
defenseless people, thus preventing the continuation of Serbian 
crimes in Bosnia.

  [Text] Tehran, April 19, IRNA -- The visiting deputy 
foreign minister of Sudan, Yusuf 'Umar Baridah, and his Iranian 
counterpart Mohammad Hashemi urged lifting of arms embargo on 
Bosnians and called on world Muslims to take serious measures in 
this connection. 
  In a meeting here Monday, the two sides discussed 
international developments including crisis in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and termed the double-standard of the West, 
especially the U.S., as "cruel and unacceptable". The two 
officials also criticized procrastination of the U.N. and the 
West towards massacre of Bosnian Muslims by Serbian forces. 
  Pointing to the issue of hajj, Hashemi regretted new 
restrictions being imposed by Saudi Arabia on the number of 
Iranian hajj pilgrims. He stressed that if Muslims were allowed 
to raise problems facing the Islamic world during hajj rituals 
and could make proper decisions themselves, the world arrogance 
could never find a chance to interfere in their internal affairs. 
  Baridah, who arrived here Monday on a three-day visit, 
discussed expansion of bilateral relations in all fields. He 
also underlined the religious and political importance of hajj.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Excerpts] The action taken by Jordan to ban political 
activities of the office of the Islamic Resistance Movement, 
Hamas, in Amman will make the Zionist regime more aggressive and 
encourage its interference in regional countries' internal 
affairs. 
  Even though Jordanian authorities have said that the measure 
has been adopted within the framework of their country's 
political position vis-a-vis the Palestine crisis, no one is in 
doubt that the will of the Zionist regime has also influenced 
the decision. 
  The Hamas office in Amman, respecting the sovereignty of the 
Government of Jordan, continued its solely political and 
propaganda activities in support of the legitimate and legal 
struggle of the oppressed nation of Palestine until Rabin, the 
prime minister of the Zionist regime said that Jordan provided 
shelter for the Islamic Resistance Movement of Palestine. 
[passage omitted] 
  In reaction to the closure of its office in Jordan, the 
Islamic Resistance Movement of Palestine warned the Zionist 
regime that it should not extend the scope of the conflict to 
outside the occupied Palestine. So far the Palestinian movement 
of Hamas has limited the scope of its organizational and jihad 
operations against the Zionist regime to within the occupied 
territories; and in order to avoid repeating the mistake of the 
PLO in diverting from the main struggle, it has not carried even 
a single guerrilla operation against the Zionist regime outside 
the borders of Palestine. 
  The political and propaganda activities of the political 
office of Hamas in Jordan, contrary to past PLO activities in 
that country, have, so far, not created any kind of problem. 
Therefore, its closure is only due to foreign pressure, 
particularly by the Zionist regime and probably its Western 
supporters. 
  That is why it is probable that this decision of the 
Jordanian Government would have negative consequences on the 
public opinion of Islamic countries, particularly Jordan, where 
most of the population are Palestinians and have strong 
pro-Islamic tendencies. 
  In the opinion of political analysts, the exertion of 
pressure by Israel on Jordan and Jordan's leniency can have 
other unpleasant consequences. Such actions will encourage 
direct and indirect efforts by Tel Aviv to limit activities of 
Palestinian organizations in other countries of the region and 
such interference, due to their aggressive nature, would 
definitely create tension. Also, the aggressive nature of the 
Zionist regime and its clear interference in the internal 
affairs of the countries of the region may spread the scope of 
the Muslim peoples' confrontation against the Zionist regime 
from the occupied territories to beyond them. Such a situation, 
in the first instance, will be detrimental to the Zionist regime 
and the compromising Arab governments.

  [Text] In today's Friday prayers sermons in Tehran, the 
president stressed the need to reform the system of payment of 
various subsidies. In his debate on the issue of social 
justice, Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani referred to subsidies paid by 
the government, and said: The situation regarding subsidies 
during recent years has in effect constituted a kind of 
injustice. This has of course been alleviated. 
  Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani then set out to describe the details 
of this year's budget, and said: During the current year [ending 
21 March 1995], 600 billion tomans will be paid in form of 
various subsidies. Of course, a large proportion of these will 
be distributed in a fair manner. However, this system must 
undergo a comprehensive reform. 
  The president added: About half of the said sum will be 
earmarked to basic commodities, so that the people can obtain 
cheap edible oil, rice, and sugar. Of course, in a healthy 
economy, only those with a low purchasing power should be able 
to benefit from such subsidies. 
  Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani, moreover, announced the sums 
allocated to payment of various subsidies, and added: In sectors 
such as agriculture, culture, education, and purchase of 
medicine and dried milk, payment of subsidies to the deprived 
strata who are covered by Imam Relief Committee or other 
organization is fair. However, payment of bread subsidies does 
not constitute a fair system. This system should be revised 
according to a systematic plan, with a view to political and 
social prerogatives, so that the said subsidies may be available 
only to certain strata. One must also do something about fuel, 
so that by regulating the method of payment of these subsidies, 
fairness can be introduced into this system. This is because 
every year around 20 trillion rials of the country's reserves 
are spent on fuel without any considerable return. The 
situation in other countries, however, is clearly different. 
  The president stressed: The present situation, under which 
everyone, even the well-off strata and those without a real 
need, benefit from subsidies, is an injustice to the really 
needy people. This situation should be changed. 
  The president then referred to the occasion of Army Day, 29 
Farvardin [18th April]. He praised the services of the army of 
the Islamic Republic of Iran during the years after the victory 
of the Islamic revolution. He said: The role of the army during 
the war was highly worthy of praise. Alongside the sacrifices 
of the Islamic Revolution Guard Corps, Basij and other defense 
institutions, the army was a highly reliable entity. He then 
said that solving the problems of military personnel is in 
harmony with solving the problems of society's other strata. 
  On Bosnia, the president said: Because of apathy and the 
weak 
attitude of the United Nations, and other organizations, the 
Serbs' impudence has reached a level that they even express an 
opposition toward the forces of that [UN] organization. The 
interim Friday imam of Tehran added: This ugly attitude of the 
West has, in fact, caused disgust among human society; since the 
experience of the Iraqi attack on Kuwait has shown that Western 
powers, if they wish, can stop the Serbs' aggression. 
  Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani described the continuing clashes in 
Afghanistan as regrettable and called on the leaders of jihadi 
groups to show forgiveness and refrain from seeking power so as 
to reach a solution to the existing problems. The president 
said: The continuation of this situation has, in practice, made 
it impossible to help the Afghan people.

<F P=106> [First Friday prayers sermon by President Akbar </F>
Hashemi-Rafsanjani in Tehran on 15 April -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] In the name of God, the compassionate, the 
merciful. [passage omitted] In my first sermon in the new year I 
have the opportunity to continue on the subject of social 
justice, to which my first sermons are usually devoted. Of 
course, some times there are many topical issues -- there are 
exceptions -- but I will try to tell you about the rest of the 
subject in other sermons this year. [passage omitted] 
  In my talks in recent weeks about financial issues between 
the government and the people I referred to some aspects of 
social justice. Today we will talk in general terms and about a 
specific point that we mentioned in previous talks. 
  Basically, one of the important manifestations of social 
justice concerns financial relations between governments and 
people, both in government revenues and expenses. Government 
resources -- we are like others -- come either from the 
country's natural resources, taxes, payments received for 
services rendered to the public, or from public charity and 
donations, and so forth. They constitute budget revenues. 
  Expenses are either for services that are the government's 
duty, such as defense, education, health, treatment, 
communications, infrastructural work, justice, security, 
legislation, and all the usual tasks of governments. For every 
sector there is usually an official responsible, called a 
minister. Or there are expenses for the country's construction 
and development, which is part of the development expenditure, 
or expenses to help the needy. 
  When all of that is done properly social justice prevails in 
that sector. If they take anything from the people unfairly, it 
is an injustice. And if they spend unfairly that is an 
injustice, too. It is very very difficult for a government to be 
in control of itself and the society to such an extent that all 
its expenditure and revenues are really fair. [passage omitted] 
  Today I will not talk about taxes, which I talked about last 
year, or development and services revenues. Since today's talk 
is the continuation of other sermons I will talk about expenses. 
The sermon will be short. And regarding expenses I will talk 
about one type of expenditure in this sermon. [passage omitted] 
  As I have said before, it is during periods of crises, such 
as war, earthquakes, floods, or other natural disasters, that 
government assistance in the form of subsidies is introduced. 
If there is a plan, then such subsidies will be only temporary 
and will come to an end. However, if there are other influences 
in place, then subsidies will have to remain. Unfortunately, in 
our country many of the subsidies that have been introduced at 
various times for different reasons have remained in force. 
This has caused the weakening of the foundation of the 
country's economic system, while at the same time giving rise to 
severe injustices throughout the course of the history. It has 
brought about injustices that, on the surface, seem like justice 
and charity. The people, on the other hand, mainly remain 
unaware, while the officials do not dare bring about reforms. 
  The reason for not reforming the system is that governments 
chiefly serve for only a short time, whereas such reforms are 
possible only in the long-term. If a government decides to 
reform the system of subsidies, it will upset at least its 
contemporary generation. The generation that will benefit from 
the results are often served by a future government. 
  For this reason, when governments come to power, they try 
to do what is good and expedient merely for the present time. 
They not only continue this wrong trend, but also add to and 
enhance it. This has happened in our country many times. 
  The figures that I am going to put forward today in very 
simple terms will show you what your country's budget is all 
about, and what your government's expenditures are in the sphere 
of provision of aid and assistance. If the people of our 
country become aware of what we officials already know, they 
certainly will not remain happy with the present situation. Of 
course, during the course of the first plan, we tried to avoid 
this unhealthy trend, and we managed to regulate a large part of 
our subsidies. However, there is still a large gap that needs 
to be filled, and this has to be accomplished through 
implementing a proper program. This is necessary because people 
cannot be put under pressure, as this will prove dangerous. 
  At this point, I would like to mention a general figure. The 
total sum of the budget approved by the Majles this year is 69 
trillion rials, that is 69 thousand billion rials. This figure, 
naturally, might not mean much to the majority of our people, as 
they do not really deal with figures amounting to a trillion; 
they mainly deal with hundreds, thousands, and millions. 
Trillion, therefore, might seem a bit strange. 
  Out of the said figure, around 35 trillion rials belongs to 
state organizations and companies that are active in the 
country's economic system. We do not wish to deal with such 
entities here. Around 32 to 33 trillion make up the government's 
overall budget, which is to be earned by oil exports or from 
sources such as taxation and provision of services. Out of this 
sum, around 3 trillion rials belongs exclusively to the 
apparatus [dastgah], which should not be taken into account [as 
heard]. Thirty trillion rials, nonetheless, makes up our 
budget. That is to say a budget that runs all our ministries, 
such as the oil, energy, communications, defense, agriculture, 
education, higher education, and health ministries. The budget 
for some of these ministries, such as defense and education is 
very large, while the budget allocated to some others is 
relatively small. 
  So, alongside this, all the government's budget comes to 30 
trillion. We have one item outside the government's budget that 
is the people's fuel; this is not included in this. The fuel 
that the people use, such as gasoline, diesel, mazut, 
electricity and gas.... [pauses] These are the things the people 
use. We use around 1.4 million barrels of oil for this, and 
around 800,000 barrels of gas. So in total, we use around 2 
million or 2.2 million barrels of oil. And this is not even 
included in the budget. We do not have any income for this. We 
take it from wells, we refine it, and transport it. The money 
that we receive from the people just about covers the cost of 
this very same job, in other words to extract oil from the well, 
etc. I am not including investment in this. I am talking about 
the cost of refining and transporting it, and placing it in 
storage tankers for the people to use. In other words, around 
$11 billion -- OPEC's average price of oil is around $13 dollars 
[per barrel] today -- of the people's money, the people's 
treasury, is used by us without receiving any income in return. 
The people burn this amount. This comes to around 20 trillion 
rials, in other words, two-thirds of the total budget with 
today's prices. Of course, with last year's price, it was 
higher, it was enough for everything. 
  So 20 trillion rials are taken out for free from the 
treasury 
which the people use. Of course, this is not the case in other 
countries, we are practically alone in this situation. This 2 
million barrels of oil that I have said we use is valued at $11 
billion; in comparison, France uses and in return receives $40 
billion from its people. In other words, France has an income. 
And the tax is not its own [as heard]. It buys oil from 
abroad, brings it home, sells it to the people, and takes $40 
billion from the people in tax. The same applies to Germany and 
many other places. However, this trend has continued in Iran 
since the war, the old war, World War II. No one has had the 
guts to correct this trend, and there has been no planning for 
this. 
  That is a section that is not related to this part of my 
remarks. There are also subsidies for which each year we ask 
permission of the Majlis before distributing among the people. 
During those five years, we made efforts and reformed the 
subsidies that were not fair. In most cases, the subsidies only 
benefited the richer strata and the deprived strata did not even 
receive them. That went on for most of those five years, but you 
will see from the list that I read to you that we still have 
fundamental problems. That means that subsidies have not been 
fair. [passage omitted] Subsidies are one fifth of the total 
budget for this year [beginning 21 March 1994]. That is 600 
billion toman or 6 trillion rials. That figure is not exact, I 
have rounded it up to the next figure. [passage omitted] 
  I am going to read you the list that I think will be useful 
for our people to know. Something around half of that figure is 
paid for subsidies for basic goods. That is wheat, sugar, 
cooking oil, rice, meat, and other goods. That is, the 
government pays around 300 billion tomans so that bread prices 
stay the same and people can purchase cheap cooking oil, rice, 
and sugar. As I said, in a healthy economy such goods should 
have their real price and the ones who are poor should receive 
help from the government. [passage omitted] One of the things 
that is not just is this. This is an injustice. It really does 
not make sense for someone who can waste so much money in his 
life to be able to buy bread made with flour at nine rials per 
kilogram from the government or cooking oil at 30 or 40 rials 
per kilogram or cheap rice or sugar at 20 or 30 rials per 
kilogram. The government has to buy the flour from the farmer 
for 270 rials to give it to that gentleman, sugar for 700 rials, 
and so on. 
  This is unjust, not for the poor: The poor should get these 
things. However, unfortunately, we are implementing this 
injustice in our country at the moment. We are spending part of 
everyone's wealth, the public wealth for the advantage of people 
who do not need it and who should be giving instead of receiving. 
  That is one thing. Half of that 600 I mentioned. The next 
thing relates to the agricultural sector. Our expenditure in 
that sector is more or less just and fair. It poses no problem 
as far as we are concerned. In terms of fertilizer and 
pesticides this year -- I am referring now to figures proposed 
by the cabinet to the Majlis. Of course, the Majlis reduced 
these figures to some extent, but it has elsewhere allowed the 
full figures, if we have the revenue. The assumption has been 
that we will not have the revenue, but if we do, we can spend 
it. We are spending 600 billion rials for fertilizer and 
pesticides, that is, 60 billion tomans. We spend 10 billion 
tomans on improved seeds so that farmers will have a better 
harvest. We spend 10 billion tomans to cover unexpected damages 
suffered by farmers, such as diseases affecting their crops. 
And we spend six billion tomans on insurance funds for farmers. 
In other words, we give about 626 billion rials to the 
agricultural sector. 
  There is nothing wrong with this, because the farmer is a 
producer after all and the government itself is a purchaser. We 
have to take this into account. We buy wheat [as heard] for 270 
rials per kilogram. If we did not give them that money, we would 
have to buy it for 300 or 350 rials. We buy it cheaper; we do 
not see this as unfair. We believe that we can keep paying 
these sums for however long; it does not matter. 
  In terms of cultural matters: We give a lot of assistance. 
We are not unhappy about this either. All these things have 
been adjusted in recent years. We give 5 billion tomans to the 
press: newspapers, magazines, and so on. We spend 2 billion 
tomans on the publication of books and book fairs. We spend 3 
billion tomans on the publication of books for school children. 
And we spend about 3 billion tomans for the education of 
martyrs' families, schools for martyrs' families. We spend 6 
billion tomans on providing free school meals for poor children 
in underprivileged areas, on subsidizing meals for university 
students, and so on. All this relates to our cultural 
expenditure about which we are not unhappy and which we do not 
consider to be unjust. These are well spent. 
  Another item that we pay for is the specific strata. For 
example, the Imam [Khomeyni] Relief Committee. We give 40 
billion tomans to the Imam Relief Committee, that it spends on 
the needy. The committee itself has a large income. They help 
people in towns and villages, and people are satisfied with 
this. This is justified. 
  This year we want to start social and medical insurance for 
those who are not workers or civil servants. We have set aside 
5.5 billion tomans for these two sectors this year. This is 
only the start of the work. There is absolutely no problem with 
this. This is fair, we are contributing to certain people's 
insurance. 
  To the Martyr's Foundation and the families of martyrs -- 
they are the real owners of our wealth, they have inherited the 
revolution -- we give 40 billion tomans. This is a small help 
to these families who have given their all to the revolution. 
To the freemen [former POWs], the freemen's headquarters, we 
give 1.5 billion tomans. We do not give anything to the 
Disabled Foundation, because the wealth of the Oppressed 
Foundation is at their disposal, around 20 billion tomans, as 
has been reported to us. This has not been included in my 
calculations. 
  We have other costs that can be justified or not. We are 
telling the people this so that they will be informed. This 
year we have set aside 21 billion tomans for the pilgrims, to 
pay for the difference. Of course, some people believe that 
these people have for a number of years put down a deposit, and 
if the money was in their hands, it would have grown. But in 
any case, the government has not seen any benefit from this. 
Twenty one billion tomans is paid so that those who are 
eligible can go to Mecca and come back. This comes from the 
pockets of the poor, the needy, and the people. If we were to 
act correctly, we would not help the pilgrims at all. In fact, 
we should have received something from them. But as I have 
already said, since we have taken a deposit from the people -- 
the exchange rate was seven tomans to the dollar in those days, 
and we for no reason we used to provide dollars at an exchange 
rate of seven tomans to the dollar -- we are now paying. 
  We pay for the difference in the price of medical 
equipment. There is no problem with this, although both rich 
and poor benefit from this. In any case, this comes to 13 
billion tomans. We subsidize medicine and powdered milk. 
Although the rich benefit from this, it does not matter, we can 
accept this. The figure for this is very high: 457 billion 
rials or 45 billion tomans. The government pays this so 
medicine can reach people cheaply. Of course, some people 
betray cheap medicine. They take it out of the country or put 
it on the black market. This is the worst crime. We give 75 
billion rials to the Red Crescent; it has a good income. We 
have no problem with this either. The Welfare [Organization] 
receives 242 billion rials. This organization helps the 
disabled, the retarded, and the needy. We give this 
organization 24 billion tomans and we have no problems with this 
either. 
  To the sick who go abroad for treatment -- of course we only 
send those who have to go, not everyone, we send those we cannot 
treat at home -- we give 4.5 billion tomans. If they do not 
cheat, if they use the money for treatment abroad, we have no 
problems with this, it is not unjust. 
  To those we send abroad on a grant for education, we give 14 
billion tomans. Of course, we pay them in dollars; I have 
converted the figure to rials. There is a great difference in 
the costs between those who study in Iran and abroad. If they 
really do study, return to Iran and place their know-how at the 
services of the people.... [pauses] This is a good investment, 
we are satisfied with this, it is not unjust. But if they 
themselves and members of their families are going to benefit 
from this expensive investment, then this is the same as 
oppression. It is a very important issue. 
  Regarding damage caused by floods and accidents, we spend 12 
billion tomans. This is not unfair. People suffer from 
disasters and the government must assist them. 
  Regarding loans for housing or investment for 
underprivileged 
people as stipulated in Clauses 3, 4, 5, 6 and so on -- this 
relates more to underprivileged areas, to former combatants, to 
cooperatives -- this amounts to about 100 billion rials in 
payments made to cover the charges. The bank asks for the 
charges and we pay them for this, so that it is not too 
expensive. 
  All this amounts to about 620 billion tomans; I read you the 
list. They will publish this list in the papers eventually and 
you can study it closely. You will see that most of our 
subsidies are not unfair now. That is, with respect to the 
sectors I mentioned. 
  However, for one thing, the issue of bread is unfair in 
several respects. First, because part of the people in our rural 
areas do not take advantage of the inexpensive bread. Although 
it has been stated in the budget that this subsidy should be 
made fair, should be made equal; but this is no mean task 
because it would require raising the price of bread in towns and 
we are not able to do this yet -- in terms of the political and 
social considerations that have to be taken into account on the 
basis of plans, in a suitable order and at the appropriate time. 
This is one thing that we must think about. 
  Another issue is, as I said, the question of fuel where the 
assistance is unfair. If we correct the problems relating to 
these two or three things, we will not be acting unfairly in our 
aid expenditure. This is an enormous task. As I said, it is 
not the norm for governments that have a limited lifetime to lay 
themselves open to a great deal of criticism, to do the right 
thing, be scorned for it and be pleased about this. It is a 
difficult task, but it must be done. The country's officials, 
the Majlis, the cabinet, the press and the other media must all 
work together and inform the people. Then, we can correct this 
incorrect aspect of our economy. It is our duty to implement 
social justice, to bring about a fair system of distribution, to 
help the needy and to allow those who are not needy to help 
themselves. These are not things to which a Muslim official can 
be indifferent. 
  Of course, these things must be done slowly in view of the 
fact that the revolution itself must be preserved, the society's 
conditions must be safeguarded, the people's morale must be 
maintained, we have to deal with pressures exerted by foreign 
countries and so on. We must proceed according to plans. 
Fortunately, during these past four or five years, we have put 
up with some criticism and carried out changes so that public 
property is no longer spent on many other things for which the 
expenditure was not necessary: industrial goods, non-basic 
goods. We separated these from government foreign exchange and 
moved them into the open market. They are now moving along their 
own economic channels. Of course, the question of control is 
another issue altogether. That must be carried out in its own 
place. 
  God willing, I hope that, with the explanations I have 
provided today -- analysts can perhaps evaluate these 
explanations or add to them and inform the society -- we can all 
work together in order to bring about a just government in 
material terms. Of course, the issues of taxes, the means of 
obtaining revenue, services and the value of services are all 
separate matters which, God willing, I will address at the 
appropriate time in future sermons.

<F P=106> [Address by Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu at the opening </F>
of the Knesset summer session in Jerusalem -- live] 
  [Text] Mr. Chairman, Honorable Knesset, I would like to 
begin by wishing a full and speedy recovery to those wounded in 
yet another terrorist attack which took place today in 
Jerusalem. One attack follows another and terrorism has become 
a daily occurrence. Seeing as we are now opening the Knesset 
summer session, I would like to remind you, Mr. Prime Minister, 
of what you said at the beginning of the last winter session. 
Seven months ago, eight days after signing the Oslo agreement 
with 'Arafat, you stood upon the podium and declared that a new 
era had begun. I am quoting the very words you used to describe 
it: a new era. I continue to quote: Today, we are heading 
toward greater opportunities and better times, toward days which 
will be free of worry and nights which will be free of anxiety. 
When the peace which we so yearn for arrives, our lives will 
change completely and we will no longer have to live by the 
sword. What has happened since then? What has happened is that 
there has never been such a deterioration of personal security 
in every city, town, village, and settlement in this country. 
You, Mr. Prime Minister. You, and not me, mentioned statistics 
before. I heard your statistics. You said that 161 Israeli 
civilians were murdered during the six and a half years of the 
intifadah. Sorry, I was mistaken, the correct number is 151. 
Since the signing of the Oslo agreement, a period of a little 
more than six months, almost 40 Israeli civilians were murdered. 
According to my calculation, Mr. Prime Minister, this means 
that since the signing of the Oslo agreement -- which you signed 
in order to bring about an end to terrorism -- the rate of 
murders and the rate of terrorism has increased fourfold. So do 
not talk to us about days without anxiety. What you have 
brought us with your government's stupid policy is days filled 
with worry and nights consumed by anxiety. The good days you 
promised us have turned into days of bloodshed and terror under 
the shadow of terrorist attacks. Mr. Prime Minister, the 
government has failed in the most important task of every 
Israeli government, which is to protect the life of each 
civilian; and this failure is a direct result of your policy. 
You said that you did not change the rules of engagement for 
IDF soldiers. Okay, I will not argue with you on that point 
although that too is debatable. However, you did the following 
things with regard to the other party. You, not me, released 
thousands of terrorists into the streets. You returned hundreds 
of deportees. We told you not to permit them to return. They 
participated in accelerated courses in assembling car bombs in 
Lebanon, yet you permitted them to return. You pardoned hundreds 
of fugitives and let all the leaders of the intifadah return. 
So what happens when you flood the streets with terrorists? Is 
there really reason to be surprised by the tremendous upsurge in 
terrorism, as indicated by the data you yourself provided? More 
terrorists lead to more terrorism. Did you learn anything from 
this? No, because you are going to continue. We have just been 
told that you are about to release not 4,000, but another 6,000 
prisoners. You talk about a historic process. Mr. Prime 
Minister, you are about to enter history as the prime minister 
who established a 9,000 member Palestinian terrorist army whom 
you are about to arm with helicopters, armored vehicles, and 
machine guns. You call this a security policy? It is a policy 
that undermines security, it is a policy of insanity, of 
disconnection from reality. I call on you to stop this policy 
and bring it to a halt before there is more bloodshed. 
  However, since we are at the opening of a Knesset session 
and I have reminded you of statements you made in the past, let 
me recall other remarks you made at the same session on 21 
September 1993, eight days after the signing of the agreement in 
Washington. You said that you have firmly anchored this 
agreement on three basic tenets. Let me quote the very words 
you used from this podium to describe these three principles. 
One, the PLO has committed to condemn and stop all acts of 
terrorism and violence in Israel, the territories, and 
everywhere else. Two, the PLO has promised to enforce the 
cessation of terrorism and violence on all of its members and 
prosecute anyone who breaks these commitments. Three, the PLO 
has promised to annul all clauses in the Palestinian Covenant 
denying Israel's right to exist and to bring about the official 
abrogation of these clauses. Mr. Prime Minister, what is left 
from all these commitments? You can make as many dismissive 
gestures as you want. Let us see what happened. You said that 
the PLO would stop terrorism. Okay, so we checked the minutes 
again and noted down that on the same occasion on this podium, 
eight days after the signing of the agreement, you said -- and I 
quote: I would like to report that since the signing of the 
Oslo agreement, the PLO has not carried out any attacks. Well, 
Mr. Prime Minister, I would like to tell you that nearly eight 
months have now passed since the signing of the Oslo agreement 
and they have definitely perpetrated attacks. Let us see what 
the PLO has done. First of all, the PLO -- and right now I am 
not talking about people directly under 'Arafat's command, I am 
talking about those who are not under his direct command -- 
these factions carried out nine terrorist attacks. They killed 
five Israelis and wounded eight other people. Okay, they are not 
directly under 'Arafat's command. So let us see what the Fatah 
did. This is much worse, Mr. Prime Minister. When one makes 
use of statistics it is advisable to examine the figures first. 
For example, the Fatah, 'Arafat's own organization, carried out 
37 attacks in which six people were killed and 14 others were 
wounded. I would like to read out the names of Yuval Golan, 
David Dedi, Hayim Weizman, Yitzhaq Rutenberg, Maurice Eisenstadt 
-- who murdered them Mr. Prime Minister? Was it the Hamas 
[Islamic Resistance Movement]? No, it was Fatah. 
  Mr. Chairman, I would like to ask the prime minister who 
murdered them? Was it the enemies of peace? No, it was the 
supporters of peace, the Fatah people, the good guys. You 
understand: There are bad guys, who are the Hamas, and good 
guys who are the PLO. There are also even better guys among the 
good guys -- that is Fatah, the cream of the crop. 
  Mr. Prime Minister, the first promise you made to the people 
of Israel that the PLO would halt terrorism was not kept. Now, 
with regard to the second promise that 'Arafat would take steps 
to punish any of his people who continued to carry out attacks, 
thus violating the new policy of putting a stop to terrorism -- 
that was not kept either. No action whatsoever was taken 
against any of these murderers. 'Arafat did not say anything. 
He did not bring them before a court, he did not expel them 
from the organization, he has not even condemned the attacks. 
One can occasionally drag out a condemnation from him much like 
a dentist extracting a tooth from a reluctant patient. That is 
really interesting. Obviously, the second condition that the 
PLO would take steps against terrorists was not kept. Now for 
your third promise: that 'Arafat would annul the Palestinian 
Covenant calling for Israel's destruction. He has not canceled 
the covenant nor does he intend to abrogate it in future. Mr. 
Prime Minister, I heard a senior defense establishment official, 
whom you sent to one of the Knesset committees, say that Israel 
had solid intelligence data that they had no intention of ever 
conceding anything. What are you proposing? Let us examine 
that. Every single one of your assumptions, without exception, 
has crumbled in the face of reality. 
  I understand that this bothers you, Mr. Peres. You wrote a 
book about the new Middle East but what can you do if the old 
Middle East comes back to slap you in the face? I know that 
reality is hard to face. Because when you examine your 
assumptions -- the PLO did not keep its promise to stop 
terrorism; the Palestinian Covenant was not canceled; and no 
punitive steps were ever taken against PLO terrorists -- they 
all crumble in the face of reality. All I am asking for is that 
the prime minister, who, as we have already seen, can take the 
stage at any given moment, come up to the podium and simply 
admit that he was wrong. Let him say: I was wrong and made 
certain assumptions that did not come to pass. It can happen. 
People can make mistakes. 
  Mr. Prime Minister, I heard that you held a telephone 
conversation with 'Arafat two or three days ago. Let me ask you 
exactly what you have to talk to that man about? Do you demand 
that he revoke the Palestinian Covenant and stop Fatah 
terrorism? Do you demand that he enforce these steps? Do you 
ask for this? It is very hard to hear the truth but the people 
already know the truth and no amount of shouting can hide or 
obfuscate it. Mr. Prime Minister, I was also told that during 
yesterday's cabinet session, you flexed a little, puny muscle 
vis a vis the PLO. You said something, you gently chided them 
that people were saying that the Fatah in Gaza is not behaving 
nicely, that it has some sort of cooperation going. Look, I do 
not want to offend the prime minister or the members of the 
cabinet but I do not think that 'Arafat is overly concerned and 
I will tell you why. It is because he sees and knows that every 
one of the basic assumptions that you counted on, every one of 
the promises he gave you are not being kept and you are not 
demanding that he keep them. For him, the entire business is 
pure bunk. To him, you personally as well as the entire Israeli 
Government is nothing but a paper tiger. It has no value. It 
is incapable of demanding or insisting on anything. It can only 
make threats which are meaningless. You do not know how to 
negotiate. Several days ago, I asked a group of Israeli 
businessmen, who are not affiliated with the Likud -- actually 
they are even closer to the Labor party -- whether they would 
entrust negotiations over their private businesses and assets to 
such a government. None of them said yes. Now, Mr. Prime 
Minister, you have discovered something new. Mr. Prime 
Minister, today I heard of your new discovery. You have 
discovered that the PLO is cooperating with Hamas; or rather you 
said that if it cooperates with Hamas then we will have to 
consider taking steps. Have you suddenly discovered this today? 
Did you not know this already? You have a delegation where 
Fatah representatives are constantly and incessantly issuing one 
ultimatum. They are demanding that we release the Hamas 
murderers. A Hamas official appears at the ceremony marking the 
30th anniversary of the Fatah's establishment. Now they meet 
and say that when the Palestinian police, or rather army, is 
established it will not act to prevent attacks against Israeli 
citizens. This is Hamas and Fatah. I hear what they say and 
then I hear your reaction. Who do you threaten? King Husayn. 
Okay, so you threatened Husayn. But I ask you Mr. Prime 
Minister, why do you not demand the same demands of yourself 
that you demand from Husayn. Where is this cooperation between 
these two terrorist organizations, Hamas and Fatah, taking 
place? In Amman, Syria, Baghdad, or Tunisia? No, it is taking 
place here in the territories under your control and 
responsibility. It is taking place here in the Gaza Strip, in 
Judaea and Samaria, and you are doing nothing. You are not even 
condemning it or demanding anything. What you do is threaten 
King Husayn. This is a government which makes threats that 
nobody takes seriously. Everything is collapsing and 
disintegrating. What do you do? What does the prime minister 
do after all his basic assumptions collapse? The third basic 
assumption was that the PLO would defend us against Hamas. The 
prime minister told us several minutes ago and I quote: We will 
not stop the peace train. What peace are you talking about? Do 
you really believe this? This is self-delusion, it is not 
peace. The government is deluding itself and deluding the 
public. It is a process which will lead to an increase in 
terrorism. It is a process of retreat. It is a process of 
retreat which will lead to the establishment of a Palestinian 
state along the 1967 borders. 
  Mr. Prime Minister, you may have a technical majority in 
the Knesset, however, you tour the country occasionally and you 
already know that you do not enjoy the support of a majority of 
the Israeli public. You do not have a majority and that is 
putting it diplomatically [Netanyahu interrupted by prolonged 
heckling]. 
  Mr. Chairman, you have to understand that this government 
believes that its job is to prevent the opposition from voicing 
its opinions. If the government can use its influence in the 
media then great, but if not it can always scream to high 
heaven. But I can hear what Hamas and Fatah said through all 
the government's yelling. They said that not only will they 
cooperate in murdering Jews -- they are not the murderers of 
peace, they are the murderers of Jews -- but they also said 
something else which is more important. They reiterated what 
was once declared by Rafiq al-Natshah, a leading PLO official, 
who said that they shared a joint long-term goal: the 
liberation of all of Palestine. Therefore, from the point of 
view of both Hamas and the PLO, the goal of this process, which 
you insist on calling a peace process, is to establish a 
Palestinian state which serves as an instrument for our 
destruction. The distinction made by the government between 
those Israelis who oppose and Israelis who support peace is not 
only absurd but also patently false. There are no opponents of 
peace among the Israeli people but there are many people who 
oppose a false peace which is only designed to bring about the 
establishment of a Palestinian state, to hand over the Golan 
Heights to the Syrian tyrant, and following these concessions to 
lead to a war which will be far worse than any we have 
experienced until today. If one were to ask what is the most 
fundamental and deepest difference between our approaches it is 
this: The main difference between the left-wing Labor 
government and the Likud is that the left-wing believes that 
peace will be achieved by dwarfing Israel's stature and by its 
capitulation to the dictates of tyrannical regimes and 
terrorists; whereas we believe that peace can only be achieved 
by Israel growing stronger within its present defensive borders. 
We believe that this strengthening must be effected by 
expanding settlement activity, increasing aliyah, and 
bolstering, not weakening, the IDF's ability to meet the 
challenges we may yet be forced to face.

<F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Aluf Ben] </F>
  [Excerpts] Israel will demand that the understandings 
achieved with Syria in July 1993 as a result of Operation 
Accountability be expanded in a bid to curb Hizballah activity 
in the security zone and minimize friction between Hizballah and 
other terrorist organizations on one hand and the IDF [Israel 
Defense Forces] and the SLA [South Lebanese Army] on the other. 
Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin will ask Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher, who will visit Israel next week, to relay this 
message to Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad. 
  Among other things, Israel will demand that the ban on 
Hizballah katyusha and mortar attacks be expanded to include the 
security zone as well. The Operation Accountability 
understandings refer only to Israeli territory. 
  In contacts with U.S. officials over the past few days, 
senior Israeli officials made it clear that as a result of the 
war of attrition with Hizballah, the SLA is under a strain so 
great that it is in danger of disintegrating -- a thing which 
Israel cannot tolerate. [passage omitted] 
  Reacting to Israeli warnings, senior Lebanese and Syrian 
officials told the U.S. ambassadors in both countries' capitals 
that Hizballah is maintaining the Operation Accountability 
understandings by limiting its attacks to IDF and SLA military 
targets, while Israel and the SLA are breaching the 
understandings by attacking civilians. 
  Israel briefed the United States in detail about last 
weekend's events in south Lebanon. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Today's guest at the Knesset Foreign Affairs 
and Defense Committee was Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin. Our 
correspondent Hayim Hecht reports on today's proceedings: 
  [Begin recording] [Hecht] The Golan Heights was the main 
issue discussed at today's session. Opposition members demanded 
that the prime minister disclose the working papers prepared by 
the IDF [Israel Defense Forces], the Foreign Ministry, and what 
they defined as another government-affiliated body. Yitzhaq 
Rabin said: No working papers, just data collection. 
  [Rabin] Various working papers that were drafted over the 
years have now been put together. These papers do not amount to 
plans but rather are meant to provide the political echelon with 
data in order to reach decisions. This is how all these papers 
should be regarded. Neither the Army nor any other government 
body deals with political issues. Each body is in charge of a 
specific field, but when it comes to issues that are first and 
foremost of a security nature, they follow the guidance of the 
political echelon. They only prepare data, nothing else. 
  [Hecht] Binyamin Netanyahu disclosed information according 
to which the 6,000 Palestinian policemen who will arrive in Gaza 
in the next few days will be permitted to bring their family 
members. Netanyahu claims this amounts to exercising the right 
of return. [passage omitted] 
  [Rabin] I agreed that those who will come from abroad on 
specific dates may bring their immediate relatives with them. 
More than 750,000 Palestinians live in Gaza; I do not think 
another 20,000-30,000 will make any difference. I have no 
problem with their coming to Gaza. 
  [Hecht] Referring to the cooperation between Fatah and Hamas 
[Islamic Resistance Movement], Rabin said he cannot prevent 
Palestinians from talking to each other, but if this talk leads 
to attacks, this will constitute a red line for us. [end 
recording]
