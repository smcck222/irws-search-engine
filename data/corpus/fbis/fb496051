  [Text] Tehran, April 26, IRNA -- A morning daily here 
Tuesday [26 April] commented on the establishment of peace in 
the Middle East and said that real and lasting peace is only 
possible through full and sincere cooperation of the regional 
countries free of any foreign influence and interference. 
Referring to the visit to Saudi Arabia of the U.S. Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher, `TEHRAN TIMES' said the visit has two 
objectives. 
  The first, said the paper, is to speed up the process of 
signing the Gaza-Jericho peace accord despite popular 
Palestinian opposition, and the second is to justify the illegal 
presence of the U.S. in the Persian Gulf and push the sale of 
U.S.-made arms to members of the Persian Gulf Cooperation 
Council (PGCC). 
  U.S. policy in the Middle East is to legitimize the presence 
of the Zionist entity in the region at any cost, said the paper 
noting that America must realize that even the Palestinian 
Liberation Organization (PLO) has reached the conclusion that no 
peace will be achieved unless `all Palestinians' unanimously 
accept the terms.

  [Text] London, Apr. 25, IRNA -- After securing land and air 
arms deals with Persian Gulf states that are due to go on until 
the next century, the UK is now focusing on maritime defense 
equipment sales based again on invented fears of a so-called 
Iranian threat. 
  According to Jane's sentinel editor, Paul Beaver, 
international submarine suppliers are rushing to exploit the 
fears. For example, he points out Britain's offering to rent to 
littoral states the first of four new upholder-class submarines 
decommissioned by the defense ministry. 
  The sale pitch is apparently orchestrated around the false 
perception in the West of Iran's naval defense capability 
following the delivery to Iran of two Russian kilo-class 
conventional submarines last year. 
  To give the drive more credibility, Western navies are said 
to have fitted their warships in the region with torpedo decoy 
equipment. The old adage about 50 percent of hydrocarbons used 
by industrial nations passing through the Hormuz Strait is also 
exploited to the hilt. 
  The switch in emphasis to naval defense follows Britain's 
much-trumpeted arms sales in the Persian Gulf, which climaxed 
the biggest-ever "al-Yamamah deal" to Saudi Arabia and which has 
made the UK the world's second biggest arms exporter after the 
U.S. 
  The British proposal to rent submarines was said by Beaver 
to 
include an experienced crew as a way of outbidding the French 
and Americans, who are also seeking to reap the benefits of the 
built-up feeling of maritime insecurity in the region. 
  In a special report for this week's Middle East Economic 
Digest, Beaver quoted numerous Western defense companies bidding 
for contracts to supply Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and 
the UAE with a variety of submarines. 
  Although budgets are tight in the Persian Gulf due to low 
oil 
prices, Beaver believed that there was little doubt that the 
need for security of oil platforms will ensure funding is found. 
He suggested that the first significant anti-submarine defence 
and surveillance systems could be expected in the Persian Gulf 
later this year.

Iran is ready to send at least 115,000 pilgrims to Saudi Arabia 
under an agreement signed by the Iranian and Saudi foreign 
ministers in Oman in 1990. Riyadh has cut Iran's quota to 
61,000.

  [Text] The second festival of radio and television programs 
produced by Voice and Vision centers has opened in the town of 
Ziba-Kenar in Rasht Province in the presence of Mr. 'Ali 
Larijani, the head of the Voice and Vision of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran. 
  In the festival, which will last three days, 39 selected 
news 
programs, 31 television programs, 27 music and song programs, 20 
radio programs, and 65 other productions relating to graphics, 
photography, and posters will be assessed. 
  At the festival's opening ceremony, Mr. Larijani delivered a 
speech in which he said: Holding this kind of festival leads to 
the improvement of the cultural standards of our Voice and 
Vision colleagues in two respects--the assessment and appraisal 
of the year's cultural work and the exchange of experiences. 
  The head of the Voice and Vision referred to the means by 
which the enemies of Islam carry out their cultural onslaught 
and to the expansion of satellite broadcasting. He added: 
Today, the expansion and increased activity of satellite 
broadcasting has become a serious problem for Europeans, because 
it will bring about the destruction of their cultural 
identities. He went on to say: We are not opposed to the 
positive dimensions of satellite broadcasting; we must also 
strive toward improving the quantity and quality of our programs 
while adhering to our Islamic criteria.

  [Text] The prime minister has urged the opposition to play 
its constitutional role and adopt a path of understanding and 
conciliation in the national interest. Speaking to reporters at 
Parliament House in Islamabad this evening, Benazir Bhutto asked 
the opposition to reconsider its decision to boycott the 
National Assembly proceedings. The government wants the 
opposition to make decisions in the interest of the people. She 
said when the Northwest Frontier Province Assembly members 
elected Pir Sabir Shah as chief minister, the Pakistan People's 
Party [PPP] accepted the decision. Now that the same members 
have decided to make Aftab Ahmad Khan Sherpao leader of the 
house, the opposition should accept this decision. She 
emphasized that everybody must follow the Constitution. 
  Answering a question on the opposition members submitting 
their resignations to their leaders, the prime minister said the 
speaker has not received any resignation from any member. She 
asked the opposition leader not to speak about resignations, but 
to make efforts at conciliation with the government. In 
response to another query, Benazir Bhutto said that as prime 
minister and former opposition leader, I invite the opposition 
to return to the National Assembly. Answering yet another 
question, she said democracy is in the hands of the people and 
there is no danger to it. She said the opposition is taking 
these steps because it is afraid of action against it. She said 
that the PPP has been trying to establish the rule of law and 
hold aloft the rights of the people. Her government has not set 
up tribunals for disqualification in order to make the 
opposition the target of a vendetta, as the former government 
did during its tenure.

  [Text] The foreign minister, Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali, has 
said that Pakistan and ICO [Islamic Conference Organization] 
have consistently urged the international community, 
particularly the great powers, to forcefully counter Serbian 
designs in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In a statement at Islamabad 
airport today before departure for New York, he said it should 
be clear by now that the policy of (?appeasement) will not work. 
He said it is time for the powerful countries, especially those 
in Europe, to work with the Islamic (?countries) to halt the 
Serbian aggression. The foreign minister said a solution should 
now be sought which is consistent with the principles of the UN 
Charter. 
  In New York, Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali will attend the ICO 
Contact Group ministerial meeting on situation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is being convened on Pakistan's 
initiative on Wednesday. He will also address the United

  [Text] Islamabad -- Chief of the PAF [Pakistan Air Force] 
Air Chief Marshal Farooq Feroze Khan has said the F-16 are not 
indispensable and we do not depend entirely on them for our 
aerial defence. 
  "We cannot sacrifice our nuclear programme for these. If we 
do not get them we have other options and we will make alternate 
arrangements," he added. 
  In an exclusive interview with this correspondent at the Air 
Headquarter, the PAF chief said "we are looking for 
multi-functional planes which are readily available." 
  He disagreed with the suggestion that the defence capability 
of the Air Force will suffer a setback as F-16 have become part 
of the national psyche and said that we have blown the qualities 
of the aircraft and of proportion. [sentence as published] He 
said that although the F-16 was a good plane but it does not 
mean that our Air Force would be incapacitated without them. 
  To another question about the possibility of acquiring 
MiG-2000, SU-27 or MiG-29, the PAF chief said that we should not 
take hasty decisions on replacing F-16s. "We have to make a 
choice keeping in view our needs for the next 25 years and 
considering all technical aspects." 
  Replying to another question, the Air Chief Marshal said 
that 
Mirage-2000-5 was still in its infancy and it would take at 
least three to four years for this aircraft to roll out of the 
assembly plant. 
  He revealed that Taiwan was likely to be the first recipient 
of the plane in 1998. "Our priority is to opt for the planes 
which could be delivered immediately," he added. 
  The Air Chief was of the view that nuclear programme and 
F-16 
were absolutely different issues and these should not be 
intermingled "Our stand and that of the govt on the issue is 
similar," he added. 
  He dismissed the suggestion of kickbacks in defence deals 
and 
said that the role of the PAF comes to an end the moment choice 
of planes is made. 
  The PAF chief said the defence of Kahuta [nuclear power 
plant] was in safe hands and keeping in view the probable 
dangers defence of the vital national project has been made 
impregnable and so one can dare violate Kahuta air space. 
[sentence as published] 
  He said no one wanted war. "Wars take place where diplomacy 
falls and our diplomacy is moving in the right direction. 
However if war was thrust on us, we are fully prepared to 
repulse aggression and are capable of defending the motherland," 
he added. 
  He said that the six K-8 trainer aircraft have been acquired 
from China to fill in the gap created by American T-37 which 
have been returned after expiry of the lease period.

  [Text] Islamabad -- For every Afghan refugee leaving 
Pakistan two are entering the country. Latest UNHCR (United 
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) statistics show that an 
estimated 11,710 Afghans entered Pakistan between April 1 to 
April 16, while a total of 4,992 Afghans repatriated. 
  Of the 11,710 crossing over to Pakistan, only 721 persons 
entered with passports. 
  UNHCR says its border monitors observed 455 Afghan families 
(comprising 2,836 persons), as well as 3,720 single persons, 
arriving via Torkham on humanitarian grounds in first half of 
the month. 
  According to UNHCR the total number of Afghans who entered 
Pakistan in March was 21,178. 
  Officially entry to Pakistan for Afghans is still restricted 
to those with valid documents, or to those allowed to cross over 
on humanitarian grounds.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "China's Goodwill Gesture"] </F>
  [Text] The Chinese ambassador, Mr Cheng Ruisheng's 
statement, that Beijing is soon likely to officially recognise 
Sikkim's merger with India, is further good tidings for New 
Delhi and indicates that India can now look forward to the 
dividends of last year's agreement which marked a departure from 
past hostility between the two countries. Ever since Indira 
Gandhi's decision to make the "Protectorate" of Sikkim a State 
of the Republic in 1975, Beijing has steadfastly questioned the 
legality of the annexation. More than the technicality of the 
Himalayan kingdom's merger with India and whether or not a 
sovereign nation had been subjugated, Beijing was bothered by 
the disappearance of a buffer between India and China. After 
all, Sikkim had been the gateway to Tibet and its merger with 
India meant pushing the Indian frontier that much forward. 
Indeed, Chinese unhappiness with the turn of the events was 
reflected in Beijing's refusal to acknowledge Sikkim as a part 
of the Indian Union, a view which has been repeatedly expressed 
over the years. 
  It was Rajiv Gandhi's visit to China that led to a softening 
in Beijing's stand on Sikkim insofar as any official mention of 
the protectorate's merger with India was concerned. It is 
possible that the Chinese political leadership remained unhappy 
with the merger, but it refrained from striking public postures 
on the issue. Two factors have since contributed to the removal 
of doubts in Beijing about India's motives behind granting 
Sikkim statehood: First, the Prime Minister's visit to China 
last year which led to the Sino- Indian agreement on maintaining 
peace and tranquillity along the Line of Actual Control; and, 
second, China's interest in forging a regional front to prevent 
the U.S. from meddling in Asian affairs. Both the factors have 
contributed towards an upswing in Sino-Indian relations to the 
detriment of America's hegemonistic designs in the region, an 
added spinoff being the weakening of the Pakistan-China axis. 
  True, Beijing's official recognition of Sikkim's merger will 
not necessarily mean the removal of all irritants in Sino-Indian 
relations; neither should it be seen as indicative of a smooth 
road to solving the vexatious border dispute. At the same time, 
the benefits of narrowing down differences in other areas by 
stepping around what is apparently an intractable problem cannot 
be over- emphasised. Some problems will continue to plague 
Sino-Indian relations and both New Delhi and Beijing will have 
to learn to cope with them if a lasting relation is to be forged 
between the two Asian giants. For instance, Beijing will have 
to stop doubting New Delhi's official position on Tibet -- that 
it is an autonomous zone of China -- and accept the 
inevitability of pluralism in a democratic society. By 
cavilling at views on Tibet's future expressed by individuals at 
seminars and rallies, like it did recently, Beijing will be 
running the risk of setting the clock back. A better option 
would be to hasten the reopening of the silk route which once 
connected two civilisations.

  [Text] The All India Urdu Editors and Intellectuals 
Conference has strongly condemned Pakistan's support to 
terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir. In a resolution in New Delhi 
today, the conference said while fighting militancy in the 
valley, it should be ensured that the lives of innocent people 
are protected. It suggested the government to send a delegation 
of Urdu editors to Kashmir to assess the situation there. The 
conference also stressed the need to review all TADA [Terrorism 
and Disruptive Activities Act] cases and demanded the release of 
innocent persons. 
  Addressing the conference the railway minister, C. K. Jaffar 
Shariff, said that efforts should be made to enlist people's 
support in restoring normalcy in Kashmir. The tourism and civil 
aviation minister, Mr. Ghulam Nabi Azad, warned Pakistan against 
meddling in India's internal affairs. He said Pakistani 
misadventures are only creating more problems for minorities 
rather than serving any purpose.

<F P=106> [Report by unidentified correspondent] </F>
  [Text] New Delhi, April 10 -- Keen as they appeared to be 
to get Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao to visit Washington, the U.S. 
side, in the course of Mr. Strobe Talbott's talks here, sought 
to convince India that the strategic significance of getting 
Pakistan to cap verifiably its fissile material production would 
be far greater than a marginal increase in the latter's 
conventional arms strength. 
  One aspect of the proposed trade-off, entailing supply of 38 
F-16 aircraft, what Mr. Talbott sought to highlight was that the 
exercise, if successful, would amount to Islamabad "delinking" 
its nuclear programme from India's. Consequently, New Delhi's 
security concerns, which extend beyond Islamabad, even the 
Indian sub-continent, would stand acknowledged with the China 
factor also being taken care of. 
  The Indian interlocutors weren't obviously impressed by the 
American logic. It was conveyed in very clear terms to Mr. 
Talbott and also reportedly to Mr. Robert Einhorn, Deputy 
Assistant Secretary in the Bureau of Politico-Military Affairs 
of the State Department, that the induction of the 
deep-penetration jets would affect the balance of forces 
adversely against India in the region, forcing it to take steps 
in line with the changed situation. 
  Mr. Einhorn has been engaged in Indo-U.S. bilateral 
discussions on disarmament and international security since 
1992. His role in the recently concluded negotiations, which 
Mr. Talbott preferred to categorise as consultations, was much 
deeper than that of Ms. Robin Raphel, the U.S. Assistant 
Secretary of State in charge of South Asia. On the sidelines of 
the talks at the political level, Mr. Einhorn is understood to 
have had meetings covering the nuts and bolts of the F-16 issue 
and its security implications for India. 
  The future contours of Washington's new policy of pursuing 
the nuclear issue separately with New Delhi and Islamabad would 
depend on the extent to which the Benazir Bhutto regime is 
willing to play ball. Unless Pakistan accepts the deal, the 
move would remain a non-starter. It's because of the Kashmir 
issue that South-Asia is perceived as a potential nuclear 
flash-point. In recent months, Pakistan has sought to link the 
two, the message being that the nuclear imbroglio cannot be 
resolved ahead of the Kashmir question for the need for a 
deterrent against India was felt due to the situation in the 
Valley. 
  In November last year, Ms. Raphel, in the course of her 
visit 
to Islamabad, had described the linkage drawn by Pakistan 
between Kashmir and its nuclear endeavour as a "natural line of 
thought." From accounts available of the latest Pak-U.S. 
bilateral exchange, it can safely be deduced that Washington's 
thinking has since changed. "The issue of non-proliferation is 
so important," Mr. Talbott is reported to have told his 
Pakistani audience "... that it needs to be discussed very much 
in its own terms." 
  Against this backdrop, Ms. Raphel, as President Clinton's 
pointsperson in South Asia, may have problems selling the 
intended package despite her reputation of being a friend of 
Pakistan. The rosy side (for India) of the proposed deal, if 
that, indeed, is the case, also hasn't been lost on the Pak 
foreign office. It has already spoken about the need to evolve 
an "agreed and equitable approach" in the U.S. linkage between 
the delivery of F-16 aircraft and the verifiable nuclear cap. 
  The message emanating from Islamabad is, therefore, 
unmistakable: the India factor cannot be ignored in Washington's 
bilateral dealings having a bearing on Pakistan's nuclear 
option. Said a spokesman of the Pak Foreign Office following 
talks with Mr. Talbott: "We have now informed the U.S. of our 
willingness to consider any ideas that might prompt a balance of 
obligation by India, on the one hand and by Pakistan on the 
other, although these country-specific obligations could be 
different in substance." 
  As pointed out by the U.S. official the process is going to 
be complicated and time-consuming, requiring a lot of work 
through "quiet" diplomatic channels. However, Ms. Bhutto does 
not appear to be in a position to accept the quid pro quo, 
especially not if Army Chief Gen. Abdul Waheed has returned 
unimpressed from Washington. According to Pakistani Press 
reports, he was to reach Islamabad before Mr. Talbott and his 
teammates. 
  Essentially, it's the Pak army which has to weigh the 
advantages of acquiring the 38 F-16s and some other "toys" 
against the major nuclear concession being demanded of them by 
the U.S.. As of now, only the Americans have some assessment of 
Gen. Waheed's thinking which, for evident reasons, Mr. Talbott 
refused to share at his Press conference in New Delhi, terming 
as "confidential" the record dialogue held in Washington. 
  Talking of confidential conversations, one may mention that 
not much also is known about what transpired at Mr. Talbott's 
one-to-one chat with Mr. Rao before leaving for Islamabad. 
Originally planned for Thursday last, the meeting had to be 
rescheduled for the next morning. 
  Privately, Mr. Talbott is understood to have confirmed to 
the 
Indian officials the components of the arms package offered to 
Pakistan. Besides the F-16s, the offer includes three P-3 Orion 
anti-submarine warplanes, 15 T-37 trainer aircraft and 
military-to- military cooperation and training for Pakistani 
army officers at U.S. war colleges. 
  It's against this background that the Foreign Office is 
exercising caution and care while working out the details of Mr. 
Rao's visit to Washington. The basic objective is to avoid any 
embarrassment to the Premier in terms of the timing of the 
supplies to Islamabad -- if Pakistan accepts the deal, that is. 
At his Press conference here, Mr. Talbott was categorical that 
the gifts offered bilaterally would be delivered "if and only if 
Pakistan accepts a verifiable cap on its fissile material 
production."

<F P=106> [Report by Roni Daniyel] </F>
  [Excerpts] The Palestinians will have free passage from 
Gaza to Jericho, passing through Israeli settlements, and they 
will even travel on the Tel Aviv-Jerusalem highway. Agreement 
on that was reached a short time ago in the Cairo talks. Our 
correspondent Roni Daniyel reports on the agreement reached: 
  Inspections at the Erez junction will be reorganized. 
Inspection of vehicles and passengers will be computerized to 
provide real time data on those leaving the Gaza Strip, their 
destinations, and the time they arrive, so that by the end of 
the day we will know who is still in Israel. Four axes were 
defined as free passage for traffic from Gaza to Jericho. From 
the Yad Mordekhay junction those with permission will be able to 
travel to the Shoqet junction, and from there to Hebron, 
Bethlehem, and Jericho, or through 'Arad to the Dead Sea and 
Jericho. [passage omitted] 
  Besides those two southern axes, Israel has agreed to permit 
free passage along two other axes: From Ashqelon through Qiryat 
Gat to Hebron, a distance of 60 km, while the fourth axis links 
the Gaza Strip with Latrun and Jerusalem through Qiryat 
Mal'akhi. [passage omitted] 
  Those are the four axes that will link Gaza and Jericho, it 
was agreed upon in Cairo. They are called the free passages. 
We traveled along one of them today and where does it come to? 
Highway No. 1, which links Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, and from 
there they will travel through Jerusalem to Jericho, with all 
the security problems such traffic can set off, but that was 
what was agreed upon and the moment there is autonomy traffic 
from Gaza will cross here.

  [Text] Cairo, 26 Apr (MENA)--Mahmud 'Abbas, alias 
Abu-Mazin, a PLO Executive Committee member, arrived in Cairo 
this morning. He met General Amnon Shahaq, Israeli deputy chief 
of staff and head of the Israeli delegation to the 
Palestinian-Israeli negotiations. Palestinian sources said the 
meeting aims to bridge the gap between the two sides' views 
concerning various points that are still the subject of dispute, 
particularly the legal jurisdiction in Gaza and Jericho and the 
control of the crossings. 
  Abu-Mazin earlier met members of the Palestinian negotiating 
team. The talks during the meeting dealt with progress and the 
efforts required to coordinate the Palestinian stances on the 
proposals to be presented during this round of negotiations.

  [Text] Cairo, 26 Apr (MENA)--Palestinian-Israeli 
negotiations chaired by Dr. Nabil Sha'th, political adviser to 
Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, and Amnon Shahaq, Israeli 
deputy chief of staff, resumed today. 
  The Security Affairs Committee and the Legal Affairs 
Committee met to discuss the remaining disputed issues with a 
view to reaching an agreement at the end of this week. 
  Khalid al-Qidrah, head of the Palestinian delegation to the 
Legal Affairs Committee, noted some progress in the committee's 
work. There is now a great deal of understanding on the main 
issues, such as jurisdiction over territory and over criminal 
and judicial affairs, he said. Once we finish with the 
agreement, we will present it to the Palestinian leadership, he 
added. 
  Palestinian sources have said that the Israeli proposals on 
legal jurisdiction meet some Palestinian demands, especially 
concerning the rights of foreigners in Gaza and Jericho and 
legal pursuits in security and criminal cases. 
  The sources say that some differences, especially those over 
the control of crossing points and the release of detainees, 
have yet to be resolved and efforts are being made to reach 
agreement on them.

  [Text] AL-MAJD has learned that Israeli goods have begun to 
flow publicly into the markets of certain Arabian Gulf states. 
Informed political sources told AL-MAJD that an Israel ship 
called "The Orient" [al-sharq] docked at 'Isa Port in Bahrain a 
few days ago with an Israeli consignment for certain Gulf 
markets. The ship's captain and crew were allowed to tour 
Manama. 
  In another development, a Jewish businessman of Moroccan 
origin, who is married to the daughter of a ranking Moroccan 
politician, arrived in Morocco. He held intensive talks with 
Moroccan officials on backing the Israeli efforts to lift the 
Arab economic boycott of Israel and open public channels of 
communication with the rest of the Arab Maghreb states. The 
Moroccan side responded to this request by stressing the need to 
lift the political boycott first. The Israeli delegation 
objected to this and said no real political boycott exists. 
  AL-MAJD has learned that the contacts Rabin's government is 
currently holding with various Arab countries will result in a 
decision by the governments of Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, and Oman 
to cancel the economic boycott of Israel before the end of this 
year.

Arab League has stated that the League's Secretariat is awaiting 
the member states' response to the Libyan request to hold an 
emergency meeting of the foreign and defense ministers council. 
  The official explained that holding the meeting requires the

agree within 30 days of the request, the meeting will be held at 
the level of permanent delegates. 
  Libya called that extraordinary meeting to discuss the U.S. 
sophisticated weapons deal to Israel, in addition to other 
topics.

  [Text] Jeddah, 25 Apr -- The foreign ministers of the 
member states in the liaison team of the Islamic Conference 
Organization [ICO] concerned with following up the situation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina is to hold a meeting on 27 April at the UN 
headquarters in New York. 
  A statement issued by the ICO general secretariat today says 
that the meeting will discuss the upcoming steps to be taken at 
the international level to halt the savage Serbian aggression 
against the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The statement says that ICO Secretary General Dr. Hamid 
al-Ghabid has called for this ministerial meeting of the liaison 
committee to be held as a result of the savage Serbian attack on 
the town of Gorazde, which the UN has declared a safe area. 
  The statement says that Dr. al-Ghabid will go to New York 
later tonight to meet UN Secretary general Butrus-Ghali and 
members of the Security Council, in addition to participating in 
the ministerial meeting of the liaison team. 
  The statement expresses the the ICO's anxiety as a result of 
the savage crimes which Bosnian forces are committing, even 
after they expressed their compliance with the NATO ultimatum. 
  The statement denounces the scorched earth policy being 
pursued by the Serbs, which can be counted as another example of 
their bare-faced disregard for all legal standards and moral 
principles, and calls for clear and unambiguous condemnation on 
the part of the international community. 
  It is to be recalled that the liaison team is made up of the 
permanent UN representatives of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, 
Egypt, Senegal, Tunisia, Malaysia, Turkey, and Iran.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. 'Umar Salih Farwanah and Dr. Sa'ud </F>
al-Shawwa, identified as leaders of Hamas in Gaza, by Muhammad 
al-Hinnawi in Tel Aviv; date not given -- interviewees not 
identified in response] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Al-Hinnawi] How will you deal 
with the new Palestinian authority that will emerge in Gaza and 
Jericho? 
  [Hamas] It will be a relationship of cooperation and 
sympathy 
so that we can rebuild the Palestinian house. But at the same 
time we will stress the Palestinian people's right to armed 
resistance because this was the only way to force the Israelis 
to start the Gaza-Jericho negotiations. 
  [Al-Hinnawi] And where will the armed resistance take place? 
  [Hamas] Beyond the boundaries of the new Palestinian entity 
and wherever the Israeli authority, army, and police exist. The 
Palestinian authority will therefore have no responsibility for 
these military operations because they will be carried out 
outside the self-rule areas. Gosh Qatif, for instance, is not 
part of the self-rule region. So it will be a target for our 
operations. This applies to the West Bank towns of Hebron, 
Nabulus, and others; they will be the venues of operations like 
those carried out in 'Afula, Hadera, Tel Aviv, and Yafo. 
  [Al-Hinnawi] After these operations, will your elements flee 
to the self-rule areas and, consequently, create problems 
between the Palestinian authority and the Israeli Government? 
  [Hamas] Those who carried out the latest suicide operations 
did not hide in Gaza or Jericho. The Israeli Army could not 
find them. Had the army known where they were it would have 
captured them. The torch of resistance must remain lit. This 
will make Israel feel that there is no use keeping the rest of 
the Arab territory. 
  [Al-Hinnawi] Do you have links with the other Islamic 
parties 
in the Arab world? 
  [Hamas] We must first make it clear that we are against all 
the terrorist operations that take place in Egypt in the name of 
the Islamic groups, such as killing innocent people, killing 
Christians, and thefts. We are for a rational and enlightened 
Islam that establishes genuine legitimacy. 
  [Al-Hinnawi] So you are against the liquidations that are 
now 
taking place in Gaza, something that I saw with my own eyes? 
  [Hamas] We cannot say there is a struggle and campaign of 
liquidation between Hamas and Fatah. Problems do appear 
occasionally but they are quickly solved. But those who are 
proven to be enemy agents tell a different story.

<F P=106> [Report by Pinhas 'Inbari] </F>
  [Text] The agreement between Fatah and Hamas in Gaza 
contains a secret clause in which Hamas pledges not to attack 
the Qatif Bloc settlements, our correspondent has learned from 
Fatah sources in the territories. According to the sources, this 
reflects the most recent Hamas line -- namely, that the 
organization will not obstruct Palestinian rule in Gaza and 
Jericho. The sources claim that this clause has created tension 
between the Islamic Jihad and Hamas, as well as between two 
Hamas branches: the pro-peace Ahmad Yasin branch and the branch 
comprising the 10 rejectionist organizations that oppose the 
agreement. 
  [A related report by Dan Avidan on page 2 of Tel Aviv DAVAR 
in Hebrew on 26 April cites "Arab sources" as saying that "PLO 
and Hamas delegations are conducting secret negotiations in 
Cairo in an attempt to conceptualize the ties between the two 
movements on the eve of the Israel Defense Forces withdrawal 
from Gaza and Jericho" and that "the PLO-Hamas encounter was 
arranged through the mediation of Hamad Abu-al-Nasr and Sayf 
al-Din al-Banna, leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood movement in 
Egypt."]

<F P=106> [Station commentary by Yahya Rabah, Palestinian ambassador </F>
in Sanaa] 
  [Excerpts] The pact announced last 22 April between Fatah 
and the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, has been widely 
welcomed by all segments of the Palestinian community, both 
inside and outside the homeland. [passage omitted] 
  Against this backdrop came the pact between Fatah and Hamas 
-- a pact that has been widely welcomed and that defies Israel 
and underscores the ability of principal Palestinian forces to 
frustrate those who are wagering on Palestinian infighting, 
which is preached by outside circles, including the Israelis. 
  As for the Palestinian opposition factions, no matter what 
their political persuasion -- Islamic, nationalist, or leftist 
-- there is an audible dialogue going on asking such questions 
as these: What is our position? What is our role? How are we 
perceived by our people? And, increasingly, difficult questions 
are being asked. 
  Regrettably, certain Palestinian opposition leaders are 
still 
locked in a vicious circle and spitting out old slogans that 
have grown out of touch with reality and are clinging to others 
surrounded by [word indistinct]. However, instead of losing 
patience, the PLO leadership should display a spirit of national 
understanding and tolerance. This is because the Palestinian 
homeland stands in need of all its sons, and it will take 
considerable effort to establish an independent Palestinian 
state. The easy way out and haphazard policies cannot hold out 
for long. The remarkable Palestinian journey from exile to the 
homeland will infuse the Palestinian people with an enormous 
measure of [word indistinct] with self and to slough off 
illusions and [word indistinct] false offensive. 
  Brothers: The Fatah-Hamas pact will create new mechanisms to 
promote further successes. We have opened the door wide for 
diaspora Palestinians to participate in the national march in 
the face of adverse and untoward circumstances. We may as well 
open the door even wider for a national effort inside the 
homeland within the framework of the state, entity, and 
independence.

  [Text] A group of 23 Palestinian leaders from the 
territories, led by Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi, today issued a 
manifesto expressing opposition to the concessions they say the 
PLO is making in the negotiations with Israel. The public 
statement says that any agreement which legitimizes Israel's 
unilateral and illegal actions in the territories -- such as the 
expropriation of lands, establishment of settlements, and the 
annexation of East Jerusalem -- will not bind the Palestinian 
people and its national institutions. 
  At a Jerusalem news conference, 'Abd-al-Shafi, who headed 
the 
Palestinian delegation to the negotiations with Israel, attacked 
the PLO and 'Arafat. He claimed that they are cut off from what 
is happening on the ground and that the Palestinian people will 
pay a heavy price for their mistakes. He also demanded 
democratization of the PLO and for the entire Palestinian people 
to be involved in deciding on the composition of its 
institutions. 
  Our correspondent Ron Nesi'el adds that among those who 
signed the manifesto are Ghassan al-Khatib and Dr. Mamduh 
al-'Akar, who participated in the Palestinian delegation to the 
Washington talks.

  [Excerpt] Tunis, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Palestinian sources 
have told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the Fatah preparatory committee 
meetings held in Tunis last night and the evening of the day 
before yesterday sharply criticized 'Arafat adviser Nabil 
Sha'th's performance in the negotiations currently being held in 
Cairo. 
  According to the sources, al-Tayyib 'Abd-al-Rahim, member of 
the Fatah Central Committee and PLO ambassador to Jordan, 
demanded that confidence be withdrawn from Sha'th, while Major 
General Nasr Yusuf, chief of the Palestinian police and 
security, attacked him. 
  AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has learned that al-Tayyib 'Abd-al-Rahim 
surprised participants by his reservations about what is 
happening in the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations, as he was 
considered until recently one of the supporters of the course of 
the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations. Some observers do not 
rule out the possibility of Arab influences behind this position. 
  The sources also said that Sha'th was criticized almost 
unanimously for his performance in the negotiations and for his 
statements to the press. 
  The most marked criticisms aimed against Sha'th are his 
failure to adhere to the foundations, from which he must not 
deviate in any negotiations with Israel, and also his media 
performance following the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in Hebron, 
whether because of his statement that this massacre would not 
affect the peace process, or the permanent broad smile that 
appeared on his face, even amid the Palestinian people's grief.

<F P=106> [Article by Dr. Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi, former head of the </F>
Palestinian negotiating delegation: "What Should We Do?"] 
  [Text] Pondering the current state of the Palestinians, 
which is characterized by frustration and limbo, one feels pain 
and sorrow. The national movement is divided, and the peace 
process has lost its credibility. Among all the factions there 
have been various views and conflicting efforts. As a result, 
the urgent question keeps popping up: What should we do? 
  Neither I, nor anyone else can answer this question. I 
believe there can be no answer to it, except through a unified 
Palestinian stand capable of making a decision that can win the 
respect and commitment of the entire Palestinian people. 
  I beg the readers pardon for reiterating already well-known 
details. But the sequence of events and their relationships 
need to be repeated in order to clarify the truth and make it 
possible to grope for a way out of our crucial situation. 
  The Palestinian struggle has, from the outset, taken upon 
itself to defend the right of the Palestinians to 
self-determination and to an independent state. Later, after 
the emergence of the refugee problem it became necessary to 
defend their rights as stipulated in the UN resolutions. 
Despite the human and material sacrifices of the Palestinian 
people over three-quarters of a century, it has been affected 
with consecutive setbacks. There is no need to go over the 
reasons, but they should not be totally ignored either. 
  The intifada erupted in Gaza, the West Bank and East 
Jerusalem as conclusive evidence that the Palestinian masses, 
driven by conscience categorically and definitively, reject 
occupation. Moreover, they will never relinquish their declared 
national rights which they express on every possible occasion. 
Despite the violence, Israel confronted it with a fierce type 
of bloody repression and measures that are incompatible with 
international norms and the principles of human rights. The 
world knows all that. There is no need to repeat it. 
  The Palestinian National Council, out of political 
pragmatism 
and desire to put an end to the warring and bloodshed in the 
Middle East, through concessions and flexibility unprecedented 
in the history of peoples fighting for their rights, adopted a 
peace initiative accepting the principle of two states on Nov. 
15, 1988. The principle is based on UN Resolution 181 as a basis 
for negotiations between the Palestinians and the Israelis under 
the UN's auspices with the aim of reaching a just and enduring 
peace in the region. 
  Israel rejected this initiative outright, heaping 
incriminations and definitions upon the Palestinians. The 
United States, Israel's staunchest supporter, ignored it 
claiming it was insufficient. Thus, the real opportunity for 
peace in the Middle East was missed. 
  The Israeli refusal was neither surprising nor totally 
strange. For the dimensions and conditions of the Israeli 
approach in the occupied territories have emphasized that Israel 
has a claim to the area, partially or totally. It has clearly 
demonstrated such an attitude by employing a policy of land 
seizure, the establishment of settlements, the annexation of 
East Jerusalem and expanding its area with complete disregard to 
the Security Council's resolutions, condemning such measures and 
asserting that they contravene international laws and norms, as 
well as the principles of human rights. Such policy was also 
condemned by the whole world as being difficult obstacles on the 
way to a just and lasting peace in the region. 
  The Gulf crisis that started with Iraq's occupation of 
Kuwait and America's devastating aggression against Iraq under 
the banner of Security Council resolutions shed light anew on 
the Palestinian problem as an issue of occupation that has been 
going on for so long that it cannot be ignored. The United 
States proposed a peace process for the Middle East on the basis 
of UN resolutions 242 and 338. The nations of the world and the 
Arab states surrounding Israel responded to the proposal. The 
Palestinian side also responded to it, despite the Israelis' 
provocations, in order to prove its true desire for peace. 
  The Israeli-Palestinian negotiations faltered at an early 
stage because of Israel's insistence on continuing settlement, 
and its refusal to talk about the status of East Jerusalem, as 
well as its insistence on stripping the Palestinian government 
during the transitional period of any real powers. In brief, 
the Israeli attitude aimed at legitimizing what Israel has 
illegally established in the Palestinian occupied territories, 
including Jerusalem. The implication of all that was to 
obstruct the road to the possibility of establishing an 
independent Palestinian state as a result of the final 
negotiations. Israel aimed at emphasizing the stability of its 
dominance on all the occupied territories, that is the whole of 
Palestine within its natural borders. 
  The Palestinian side rejected this attitude because we have 
not participated in the negotiations to bargain on the 
Palestinians right to self-determination. That was the core of 
the negotiating crisis. 
  The US sponsor did nothing to put things in order in 
accordance with the peace reference "Resolution 242," which 
stipulates the inadmissibility of acquiring land by force, and 
the withdrawal from the occupied territories in the context of 
the peace accord. The US approach has revealed a supportive 
stand to the Israeli ambitions. Though this position was 
expected from the beginning, yet it become crystal clear during 
the ninth and tenth rounds. It became useless to continue with 
the negotiations. The negotiating team deemed it fit to suspend 
negotiations so as to have an opportunity to reconsider and 
reassess the situation in order to reach a clear and precise 
decision around which the Palestinian people could rally. 
  In the midst of all this, everyone was surprised by the 
Declaration of Principles, which was presented to the 
Palestinians as substantial accomplishment that would pave the 
way for achieving our national goals as well as realizing a just 
peace. The accord was approved by the Executive Committee and 
the Central Council with considerable reservations and a demand 
to implement its term in a way that is consistent in harmony 
with our national rights. 
  The accord has many loopholes: 
  1. It does not challenge the Israeli claims to the occupied 
territories. Israel expressed such a claim by usurping land, 
establishing settlements and annexing East Jerusalem, in 
addition to the measures taken in support of this claim and in 
flagrant violation of all international laws and norms. It is 
worth mentioning here that the accord is void of any request for 
Israel to halt settlements or to allow it to continue with them. 
  2. This non-challenging attitude to Israel's claim implied 
acceptance of a separate Israeli presence in the occupied 
territories, the settlements and settlers, with their separate 
legal and administrative systems whose point of reference is the 
Israeli state. This complete acquiescence in the Israeli claim. 
[sentence as published] 
  3. Many of the terms of the accord are open to several 
interpretations. This rendered the current negotiations 
extremely difficult to implement and paved the way for imposing 
the Israeli point of view. 
  The danger of what is going on now lies in the fact that the 
Palestinian side has not raised the issues of continued 
settlement, the establishment of new settlements, the expansion 
of the existing ones and the establishment of infrastructures 
for the benefit of the settlements, especially when the UN 
resolutions and international consensus emphasize that 
settlement is illegal and constitutes obstacles on the way of 
achieving a just and consistent peace. 
  Continuing in the current mode of negotiations but heeding 
the views of opposition, which are raised daily, causes the 
deepest concern and wonder. [sentence as published] I don't 
think the leadership is aware of this grave situation. 
  I think we are at an emerging national juncture that makes 
it 
imperative upon all nationalist forces to join together to 
review the situation and reach a decision that might win the 
confidence and support of all the Palestinians, wherever they 
might be.

<F P=106> [Report by Yosi Torpstein] </F>
  [Text] The Palestinians have started preparing for 
elections to the Palestinian self-government council. A 
committee on general and municipal elections has recently 
started operating at Orient House, the Palestinian headquarters 
in East Jerusalem. 
  The committee, headed by Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat, deputy head of 
the Palestinian delegation to the Washington negotiations, is 
working on the structure and powers of the council and on the 
manner in which the elections will be held. The committee 
members, some of whom are lawyers, represent the West Bank and 
the Gaza Strip. 
  The Palestinian Center for Statistics, set up several months 
ago in Jerusalem, has started drafting lists of Palestinian 
residents in the territories which will help in the preparation 
of voters lists. 
  The elections committee is about to send 30 Palestinian 
academics to Germany to study the issues of general and 
municipal elections. The studies, sponsored by the Germans, will 
include the management and conduct of elections, methods of 
defining constituencies, and so on. The course will start at 
the beginning of June and will last three weeks. At the end of 
the course, the academics will return and serve as instructors 
in local classes. 
  According to the Declaration of Principles [DOP] of 13 
September 1993, general elections for the Palestinian 
self-government council are to be held in the Gaza Strip and the 
West Bank nine months after the DOP goes into effect and after 
the negotiations on the council and the elections are completed. 
According to the DOP timetable, the elections were supposed to 
be held in July but, due to the delay in the completion of the 
negotiations on the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho, 
the elections will probably be postponed. 
  Palestinian sources have reported that municipal elections 
may be held in the territories before the elections to the 
autonomy council take place.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Sa'ib 'Urayqat, head of the </F>
Palestinian elections committee, by Qol Yisra'el correspondent 
Sa'id Mu'addi, place and date not given; from the "With the 
Events" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Mu'addi] Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat, head of the 
Palestinian delegation to the Washington talks and head of the 
Elections and Local Government Committee, good evening. 
  ['Urayqat] Good evening. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Sa'ib, preparations and arrangements are under 
way for the coming elections in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, 
including the appointment of an elections committee. 
  ['Urayqat] In fact, the decision to hold elections was made 
on 20 November. This decision was the first presidential decree 
signed by President Yasir 'Arafat in the wake of the Oslo 
agreement. 'Arafat signed a second presidential decree 
appointing members in the committee. This committee comprises 
figures in the legal, administrative, city organizations, and 
statistical fields. It includes brothers such as lawyer Fu'ad 
Shihadah, 'Ali Safarini, Khalid al-Qidrah, Tawfiq Abu-Ghazal, 
Faraj al-Sarraf, Dr. Hasan Abu-Libdah, Dr. Muhammad Ishtayyah, 
Dr. Rami 'Abd-al-Hadi, Dr. Husayn al-A'raj, Zahirah Kamal, and 
Engineer Nadir al-Saqqa. 
  This committee was entrusted with preparing for domestic and 
general elections, with general elections meaning [self-rule] 
council according to the agreement. The committee is now 
working to lay the pillars of the basic elections law for the 
council, and also the basic Palestinian law for elections on the 
level of municipalities and village councils, which we call 
local government. God willing, in the next three days, and after 
we have completed both the studies and a total of 17 projects 
with the EEC, the basic contract will be signed between this 
committee and the EEC. 
  The committee's work also includes much training. We will 
send 30 persons to train in Germany. These people will return 
and train cadres here. According to our information, donations 
for training purposes will be given by other states such as 
Britain, Sweden, and Norway. I can say that because of the work 
of the past four months, both elections and democracy in the 
Palestinian community are now irreversible, and matters are 
proceeding persistently. God willing, we will manage to hold 
the elections as soon as possible. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Sa'ib, what are the bases and nature of the 
elections that will be held? When do you expect the coming 
elections will be held? 
  ['Urayqat] As I said, elections will be held on the national 
level, that is, general political elections designed to elect 
the Palestinian Council. This is in addition to the elections 
on the domestic level for municipalities and village councils. 
As you know, there are 481 residential gatherings in the 
occupied territories, including only 29 municipalities, 82 
village councils, and 23 camps. This leaves 347 residential 
gatherings without any bases for administration; in other words, 
they are run by what we call village heads. The committee is 
now in the process of returning the structural organization of 
the occupied territories in terms of the number of districts and 
governorates as well as upgrading a large number of villages to 
the level of municipalities and laying a basic Palestinian law 
for the local government elections. Meanwhile, we have 
finalized the options for the elections system, whether 
elections would be proportional or according to the majority or 
a mixed model in addition to dividing the constituencies. We 
will present this to the leadership in the next few days, so it 
can choose the elections system. Afterward, the legal team in 
this group will begin to put the complete touches on the 
elections system on the general national level. As we suggested 
in our negotiations in Washington, there will be an 
international supervising committee under UN auspices composed 
of the two cosponsors, the United States and Russia, the EC 
countries, the Scandinavian countries, Japan, Canada, Jordan, 
and Egypt. We seek to hold honest, free, and general elections. 
I believe that in view of the stalled negotiations, the date of 
13 July, as stipulated in the agreement, cannot, from the 
technical and readiness viewpoints, be honored. Thus, we have 
worked out a new timetable for elections on 15 October. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat, thank you very much. 
  ['Urayqat] You are welcome.

  [Excerpts] Cairo, 25 Apr (MENA)--An official source in the 
Ministry of Interior has stated that terrorist Tal'at Muhammad 
Yasin Hammam, who was killed today, is considered the primary 
leader who controlled the "Afghanistan Returnees" organization 
and its military wing. He was sentenced to death in Case No. 
24/1993 on military felony. 
  In a statement this evening, the source revealed that Hammam 
was the primary source of instructions to implement terrorist 
operations in the country and the supreme commander at the 
domestic level. He was also the major link between the inside 
and outside, since he was the primary source of financing for 
terrorist schemes. 
  The source pointed out that Hammam received funds directly 
from financing elements abroad and redistributed them among the 
groups in charge of carrying out the operations in accordance 
with a plan prepared in advance. 
  In his statement, the security source revealed that a 
search of the terrorist's home yielded large amounts of local 
and foreign currencies, long distance telephone cards, and 
official documents ready for use in the various terrorist 
operations. 
  The search also yielded some important documents on how to 
make explosive and incendiary charges, including those used in 
the assassination of Major General Ra'uf Khayrat, deputy chief 
of the State Security Investigation in charge of religious 
activity, in addition to charts of his residence in the Pyramids 
area, the route he took, and the location selected for carrying 
out the assassination. 
  A detailed list of the names and addresses of some banks and 
companies targeted in previous operations and in the future was 
also found in the terrorist's home. 
  The security source said in his statement that papers 
containing detailed information about political, executive, 
security, judicial, and media figures and detailed drawings of 
their places of residence and the routes they traveled were also 
discovered. 
  The State Security forces that stormed the place found a 
German- made pistol with a loaded magazine, a facsimile machine 
with a collection of messages faxed previously, and a detailed 
list of the names and addresses of foreign news agencies and 
newspapers, of their correspondents, and of some local 
newspapers. 
  The security source pointed out that the killed terrorist's 
movements confirmed that he was in charge of issuing statements 
on behalf of terrorist organizations and sending them to several 
news agencies abroad. 
  He added that the State Security forces also found a 
collection of very important organizational papers, in addition 
to ciphering terms and detailed information on some of the 
companies that produce and export movie features and soap 
operas. [passage omitted] 
  The source noted that the State Security Investigation 
forces, assisted by the central security forces, have launched 
synchronized search operations in 12 governorates, during which 
58 active terrorist elements that took part in recent operations 
were caught. They are being interrogated, he said. 
  The source added that the State Security service is 
monitoring all the elements on which information indicating 
involvement in terrorist operations have been obtained.

  [Text] Cairo, 25 Apr (MENA)--The official Interior 
Ministry spokesman has stated that all the terrorist elements 
inside or outside the country are under security control. 
  Commenting on the killing of terrorist leader Tal'at Yasin 
Hammam, the official spokesman this evening said that the 
successive blows by security are now being directed at the heads 
and leaders of the terrorist groups in Egypt and are no longer 
confined to pursuing those who carry out these operations. 
  He affirmed that the State Security Investigations Apparatus 
has drawn up a detailed and precise map of all the organizations 
engaged in terrorism, explaining that this map contains the 
names of all those involved in these operations and their roles, 
in terms of financing, monitoring, preparation, and execution. 
  The official spokesman added that this map is constantly 
being updated, removing the names of terrorists who are captured 
or killed during confrontations with the security forces. 
  The spokesman emphasized that the main lines of finance from 
abroad are being monitored and efforts are under way to pursue 
and arrest all those involved. 
  He explained that the security forces were able to frustrate 
most terrorist operations before they were carried out and were 
able to capture all those involved and seize all materials used 
in these operations. He noted the huge quantity of materials 
that have been seized recently. He said that the perpetrators 
of every single recent operation have been identified, and a 
large number of perpetrators of these operations have been 
captured. The security forces are currently pursuing the 
fugitives to bring them to justice. 
  The official Interior Ministry spokesman affirmed that the 
Egyptian security service is monitoring all the elements abroad 
that instigate these operations and their movements in various 
countries of the world. He explained that the security service 
with its various branches is currently preparing the necessary 
plans to deal with these elements decisively and effectively.

    [Editorial Report] Cairo ROSE AL-YUSUF in Arabic on 18 
April on pages 62 to 64 publishes a 1,200-word report by 'Isam 
'Abd-al-Jawad in which he warns that al-Minya Governorate "might 
turn into another Asyut." 
  The report reveals that in their search for "additional and 
urgent funding for their terrorist operations, terrorist groups 
have decided to engage in the antiquities trade," having 
obtained a religious edict [fatwa] from their leadership 
legalizing this trade. 
  To establish themselves in the community, these groups have 
started to offer free health and education services. They have 
opened health centers where the groups' physicians examine 
patients without charge and women gynecologists wage a fierce 
war on family planning. They also offer free private lessons in 
mosques and sell foodstuffs at reduced prices in dozens of 
shops, mostly unlicensed, the report explains. 
  To finance their social activities, the groups collect 
voluntary as well as obligatory donations from shops and houses, 
'Abd-al-Jawad says. 
  He points out that the extremist groups' activities cover 
all 
the cities in al-Minya Governorate. He notes, however, that 
Mallawi is the main center of their activity. "The Islamic 
Group organization controls the city of Mallawi. The Muslim 
Brotherhood presence has thinned out in the city for fear of a 
clash with the Islamic Group," the writer says. 
  "Al-Shaykh 'Isa Mosque, the main stronghold of the Islamic 
Group in Mallawi, is the site of a weekly meeting on Wednesdays. 
Group members dressed in their Pakistani uniforms tour the city 
in groups, chanting Islamic songs, until they reach the crowded 
mosque." The mosque's orator is changed every week and his name 
is rarely announced. Following the sermon, a young man reads 
"the weekly bulletin on conditions of Muslims in the world, 
which reports on Westerners' persecution of Muslims, the 
internal position of the group and its persecution by the 
authorities, and finally the success of its operations." The 
bulletin concludes with warnings and threats to whoever stands 
in the group's way. 
  Explaining why Mallawi was selected, 'Abd-al-Jawad says that 
it is one of the main strongholds of the Islamic Group and the 
birthplace of al-Sadat's assassin, Khalid al-Islambuli, and 
Muhammad Shawqi al-Islambuli, one of the Islamic group leaders 
who escaped to and operated from Afghanistan. 
  'Abd-al-Jawad adds that signs indicate that a number of the 
fugitive leaders of the Dayrut branch of the Islamic Group 
reside in Mallawi and work out plans for their operations there. 
Of these he mentions Rif'at Zaydan and Jamal 'Abd-al-Hamid 
'Abd-al-Nasir, better known as al-Shaykh. 
  Citing a politician who requested anonymity "out of fear for 
his political career," 'Abd-al-Jawad says that terrorist groups 
control much of the services; they attract the citizens by 
offering free medical treatment and private lessons. Although 
the Awqaf Ministry appoints preachers and imams every now and 
then, the groups still control the governorate's mosques and the 
ministry's imams fear punishment from the terrorist groups. 
  Asked why the extremism phenomenon spreads in al-Minya, the 
politician cites unemployment as the major reason. He notes 
that the rate exceeds 60 percent and that productive projects 
are almost nonexistent. Terrorist groups attract citizens by 
involving frustrated young people in small projects, he explains. 
  As to where collected funds go, the report notes that they 
are spent on arms and financing operations in Asyut.

<F P=106> [Report by Hamdi Rizq] </F>
  [Text] AL-MUSAWWAR has learned that the Prisons Department 
last week moved 50 extremists led by Hasan al-Hillawi, who 
declared their breakaway from the al-Jihad Organization, from 
the al-Istiqbal Prison to the Mazra'at Turrah Jail after 
repeated clashes with the old al-Jihad members led by 'Abbud 
al-Zumur and Ayman al-Zawahiri inside the al-Istiqbal Prison and 
because the security agencies fear killings inside the prison in 
light of threats between the two groups. This measure was taken 
after the extremists in Ward A and Ward B in al-Istiqbal 
rejected the entry into their wards of members belonging to 
Hasan al-Hillawi. 
  A joint statement released inside the prison by the 
leaderships of the al-Jihad Organization and the Islamic Group 
accused al-Hillawi of supporting the security agencies, 
deviating from the consensus, and of being traitors and spies. 
They sanctioned their murder. They took this measure to 
prevent other members from joining al-Hillawi, who declared his 
rejection of acts of violence prevailing among the extremist 
groups. 
  Al-Hillawi used the hospital in the al-Istiqbal Prison as a 
shelter for himself and his 50-member group and sought a 
dialogue with the leaders of the Islamic Group, particularly 
Najih Ibrahim. The latter, however, rejected al-Hillawi and 
accused him of being a traitor and spy. Heated arguments took 
place between al-Hillawi and members of the al-Jihad 
Organization and they were about to engage in fistfights and 
hand-to-hand fighting. But policemen intervened, disengaged 
the two groups, and decided to move the al-Hillawi followers to 
the Mazra'at Turrah Prison. 
  The recent crisis, the second disturbance in the al-Jihad 
Organization after the Muhammad al-Makkawi dissension from 
al-Zawahiri, who is living abroad, began when a fax reached Arab 
and foreign newspapers signed by Hasan al-Hillawi. Al-Hillawi 
is a prominent figure in the al-Jihad Organization and 
participated in military sedition in 1977. The fax urged the 
extremist groups to exercise self-restraint, stop acts of 
violence, lay down their arms, and hold a dialogue with the 
government to ease restrictions on detainees. He expressed 
readiness to hold this dialogue and declared that it is 
inadmissible to oppose the ruler and form groups opposed to the 
regime. Although the fax caused confusion among al-Jihad 
Organization ranks abroad and raised questions about 
al-Hillawi's role in the al-Istiqbal Prison, a lawyer on the 
detainees' defense panel asked to meet al-Hillawi on 
instructions from abroad to discuss his call and make sure that 
he appeared, particularly as he is considered to be an important 
intellectual leader in the al-Jihad Organization. The lawyer 
met al-Hillawi and asked him what he wanted. Al-Hillawi 
answered: I urge the groups to give up acts of violence and I 
will undertake a dialogue with the government. At the meeting, 
which was also attended by Ahmad Rashid Muhammad Rashid, one of 
the most important figures in the Vanguards of Conquest, the 
lawyer accused al-Hillawi of trying to get out of jail by any 
means, that he was weakening, and that he no longer put up any 
resistance. The lawyer advised the group members abroad on the 
details of the meeting. Despite the threats that the al-Jihad 
members inside the prison made to al-Hillawi to return to the 
fold, he rejected them and gained the support of 50 extremists. 
He thus established an independent organization and began 
making calls denouncing violence and calling for dialogue. The 
groups inside the prison considered these calls to be a 
deviation from the course by a leading intellectual figure who 
played a major role in the military sedition and the 
reorganization of the al-Jihad Organization (Case No. 401 of 
1977). They feared that his influence might spread to the rest 
of the groups and create problems with other members. Bloody 
clashes would have occurred had the prison administration not 
intervened, saving al-Hillawi and his group from certain death 
by moving them to the Mazra'at Turrah Prison. 
  Disputes continue, involving the leaderships of the 
extremists abroad and Ayman al-Zawahiri, al-Jihad leader abroad, 
and Muhammad al-Makkawi, who is accused in State Security Case 
No. 401, known as the reorganization of the al-Jihad 
Organization. Attempts by members of the group in Egypt, 
particularly lawyers, failed to resolve the dispute despite 
reports that al-Zawahiri traveled to Europe and that al-Makkawi 
left Pakistan and joined tribes on the border fearing manhunts 
by the Pakistani authorities of Arabs there.

<F P=106> ["Dividing Lines" column by Samir Rajab] </F>
  [Text] It does not befit the United States to sell 25 F-15A 
military aircraft to Israel in the current tense atmosphere and 
when acts of violence are taking place daily. With this 
decision, Washington wants to tell the whole world: "Let Israel 
strike at the Palestinians as it pleases, let it slow down and 
stall over implementing the Gaza-Jericho Agreement, and let it 
set the toughest conditions for withdrawal from the Syrian 
Golan; that is, if it ever really considered withdrawal." These 
are not our words. This is, verbatim, what the Pentagon said to 
justify the aircraft deal: The Pentagon's statement said that 
the deal will contribute to furthering the foreign policy and 
national security of a "friendly" country that will remain an 
important force for political stability and economic progress in 
the Middle East. 
  First, the claim that Israel is a factor of stability 
contradicts the truth, because since they "planted it," Israel 
has been the root of upheaval, conflict, and war. Even after 
signs of peace began to loom on the horizon, Israel did not give 
up its shameless actions and behavior. Proof of this is the 
al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre and subsequent shameless acts. 
  At the same time, I maintain that the United States has a 
right to market its industrial products and help its partners 
survive. Frankly speaking, however, the timing is 
inappropriate. The need is not so urgent that Israel should be 
provided with the most modern offensive aircraft on the pretext 
of strengthening its air force so that it can reach particular 
positions in Iraq, which fired missiles at Israeli cities during 
the Gulf war. This, of course, is a flimsy excuse for the 
simple reason that the United States is the first to know Iraq's 
current military and economic capabilities, which do not enable 
it to stage even a limited maneuver, let alone launch a raid on 
Israel. 
  Anyway, America continues to reiterate that it is a 
"partner" 
in the peace negotiations. A partner is supposed to be 
concerned about attaining the goal. But I believe that the 
announcement today about a deal for the sale of 
$2.4-billion-worth of aircraft to one of the parties in the 
partnership, a party noted for its intransigence, arbitrariness, 
and conceit, will not make the achievement of the "goal" of 
peace, which we have long and eagerly awaited, easy.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Strange Statements and Stranger Attitudes by </F>
the United States"] 
  [Text] U.S. sources have pointed out that Israel's 
acquisition of 45 fighter aircraft of the latest version will 
enable the Israeli air force to hit sites in Libya, Iraq, and 
Iran, thanks to the aircraft's capability for long-distance 
flights. This is the first time the U.S. Government has 
approved the sale of aircraft of this advanced type to another 
state, as it had been used exclusively by the U.S. Air Force. 
  It is strange for U.S. sources to single out these three 
states, two Arab states and an Islamic state, regardless of the 
kind of policy adopted by the latter. In addition, the position 
of U.S. President Bill Clinton's government on the question of 
the international inspection of sites said to be used by North 
Korea to produce nuclear weapons and its threats to conduct air 
strikes against South Korea should it reject international 
inspection of its nuclear facilities are surprising to many. 
They also bring into question the real reason prompting the 
current U.S. Administration and the preceding administrations to 
ignore any mention of the nuclear weapons that Israel managed to 
produce and store in the Negev desert a long time ago and to 
turn a blind eye to the Tel Aviv government's continued refusal 
to sign the nuclear nonproliferation treaty. This refusal is a 
flagrant defiance of the world community and the treaties 
endorsed by the majority of countries. 
  Washington cannot claim to be ignorant of Israel's nuclear 
activity, something that is known to all scientific intelligence 
services, which know the number of nuclear bombs produced by the 
Dimona reactor and other hidden facilities. Moreover, every now 
and then the Israeli intelligence services leak information 
about the nuclear weapons that Israel possesses, the purpose of 
which is clear: to spread panic and anxiety among the 
neighboring and non-neighboring Arab states. If we add to this 
Washington's vacillating position over the tragedy in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, which encourages the Serbian leaders to 
continue their barbaric aggression and ethnic cleansing 
operations against Muslims there, we will realize the real 
feelings governing the attitude of the U.S. Administration, no 
matter how much it tries to pretend goodwill, with which 
Washington officials' statements are replete!

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Arabs Are Under Siege"] </F>
  [Text] The "international" Security Council has once again 
decided to maintain the sanctions on the Libyan people which, it 
falsely claims, are imposed on the Libyan regime for its refusal 
to extradite two of its citizens accused of involvement in 
blowing up an American airliner over Scotland in 1988. 
  This decision means continuing the siege of Libya, both 
people and state, for another four months, during which Libyan 
citizens will be paying the price for a crime they have not 
committed. Libya's children, including babies, will shoulder the 
burden of punishment for a crime on which no sentence has yet 
been issued. 
  At the same time, the siege of Iraq continues. It is the 
siege of the people and state and not the siege of Saddam Husayn 
alone or his regime. The long-range monitoring is continuing 
and its purpose is to prevent the Iraqi people from benefiting 
from their resources and wealth. 
  It is regrettable that international resolutions are issued 
one after the other against Libya and Iraq amid Arab silence at 
the best of times and even with an Arab welcome and blessing. 
While this silence by any other Arab country can be excused, we 
cannot excuse the silence of Egypt, the citadel of Arabism, the 
pillar of the Arab movement, and the country that represents the 
fundamental basis of every correct Arab policy. Also, lifting 
the siege from Libya and Iraq serves -- in the present 
circumstances -- a purely Egyptian interest. It is enough to 
mention that there are thousands of Egyptians working in these 
two fraternal countries and both countries can absorb more when 
the situation stabilizes and improves. 
  We do not deny that there is Egyptian action toward lifting 
the siege. But we believe that, in view of its role, Egypt can 
act more strongly in this direction. The Arab League secretary 
general can also support and back this action. Conditions are 
possibly appropriate today for the Arab League head to call for 
an Arab summit, not to affect a reconciliation, to "kiss and 
make up," or to "forget the past," but to stop the deterioration 
in Arab relations, to save the fraternal peoples in Libya and 
Iraq, and to draw up a plan for lifting the siege imposed on 
them. 
  At the same time, all the Egyptian forces, parties, and 
establishments, both the ruling and opposition ones, can today 
start an Arab campaign to save the Iraqi and Libyan peoples. 
The quicker this action is, the better it will be; otherwise, 
we will all pay the price in the form of more differences, 
divisions, and weakness in this era of the siege of the Arabs.

<F P=106> ["Closeup" column by Salamah Ahmad Salamah: "Outside </F>
International Legitimacy"] 
  [Text] The U.S. F-15 military aircraft's downing of two UN 
helicopters over the no-fly zone in north Iraq is raising many 
questions about the legality of the measures the United States 
is taking in monitoring the situation there and the congruity 
with the UN resolutions that specified the nature of the 
international measures imposed on Iraq as a result of its 
aggression against Kuwait. 
  It is well known that a Western agreement imposing the 
no-fly 
zone over Iraq was reached among the United States, Britain, and 
France outside the framework of the United Nations and the 
Security Council resolutions to protect the Kurds in north Iraq 
from the atrocities and persecution of Saddam Husayn's regime. 
Despite the fact that the Shiites in south Iraq are exposed to 
the same atrocities and persecution, they have not enjoyed the 
same degree of protection as the Kurds. 
  It seems illogical that the West should volunteer to protect 
the Kurds in Iraq while it ignores the raging battles between 
the Turkish Army and the Kurds in the Turkish-Iraqi border area. 
The Turkish forces have for several months been bombarding and 
burning Kurdish villages on a large scale, and even chasing them 
inside Iraqi territory. This indicates that the no-fly zone in 
north Iraq and the U.S. military aircraft sorties in its 
airspace are not meant to protect the Kurds as much as to put 
the Iraqi people under a stiffer international blockade than the 
Security Council resolutions stipulate in a way that threatens 
to separate the Kurdish areas in the north from the Iraqi state. 
This would definitely lead to partition or to creating new 
political situation allowing the establishment of an independent 
state for the Kurds. 
  The U.S. State Department spokesman's statement blaming Iraq 
for causing the downing of the two helicopters and the death of 
more than 20 senior commanders and UN figures is ridiculous. It 
is the U.S. military aircraft that mistook the UN helicopters. 
When the use of double standards becomes a well-established 
method in international dealings, the stance of the United 
States and NATO on the Serb aggression against Bosnia and the 
continuing bombardment of Gorazde and of the UN forces seem 
extremely strange. The Serb forces' defiance of the UN 
resolutions and NATO ultimatums are being met with a great deal 
of patience, pampering, and caution. Air strikes are calculated 
while contacts, negotiations, and attempts to reach a peaceful 
solution go on. Moreover, numerous acts of aggression against 
safe zones in Bosnia are ignored. This totally contradicts what 
is happening in Iraq. Why? This is the question.

<F P=106> [Report by Salwa al-Ustuwani: "Russian Delegation in </F>
Damascus To Discuss Syria's Debts and Military Needs"] 
  [Text] Damascus -- A Russian delegation headed by Oleg 
Soskovets, first deputy prime minister of the Russian 
Federation, arrived in Damascus the day before yesterday on a 
three-day official visit, during which talks will be held with 
senior political and military officials. The head of the 
delegation will deliver a message to President Hafiz al-Asad 
from Russian President Boris Yeltsin concerning developments in 
the Middle East, the peace process, the Russian efforts made in 
this connection, and bilateral relations. According to Russian 
sources, the Russian delegation is expected to discuss the debts 
question and Syria's needs, that is, spare parts and weapons. 
  The delegation will also visit a number of industrial 
installations and participate in opening the electrical "Tishrin 
Complex" in which Russia participates. 
  Syrian-Russian committees will meet to solve the problem of 
the military debts Syria owes to the Russian Federation, as the 
heir of the former Soviet Union. The debt problems will be 
solved in the two countries' joint interests. The debts are 
estimated at about $1.5 billion. 
  Syria had demanded that Russia fulfill its defense needs 
requested from the former Soviet Union under the friendship and 
cooperation agreement signed between the two countries in 1980. 
  The Russian delegation will also hold talks with Syrian 
Defense Ministry General Mustafa Talal on the Middle East 
crisis, the peace process, and Russia's view on how to advance 
this process, especially the Russian proposal to convene a 
"Madrid-2" conference.

<F P=106> [Unattributed "News and Analysis" feature: "Canceling Books </F>
in the United Arab Emirates Discussing Israeli Repression!"] 
  [Text] In a report from the United Arab Emirates [UAE] 
yesterday morning, London radio said the French Government 
canceled educational books in the French school in the UAE 
because they point to both Israeli repression in the occupied 
Arab territories and the Palestinian people's resistance of 
occupation. The press report claimed this measure was taken in 
agreement with the UAE authorities as part of fighting 
anti-Semitism! 
  The report, in itself, was brief. It, however, has serious 
implications. Everyone is aware of the French Government's 
current shift in favor of Israel, which reached the extent of 
concluding military and nuclear cooperation deals with it. This 
recalls the cooperation of the Guy Moliere [name as 
transliterated] government in the fifties before and after the 
futile Suez aggression. However, the French Government's 
cancellation, under the Zionist lobby's influence, of curricula 
in an Arab country on the pretext that it is anti-Semitic to 
discuss Israeli repression is regarded as extreme deception and 
collusion. It also reveals strong hostility to Arab hopes and 
aspirations as well as a readiness to cooperate with Israel as 
much as possible. 
  The Western press in general, including the French press, 
constantly discusses both Israeli repression and the subjection 
of Palestinians to disgraceful ordeals. We, however, have heard 
no official in the French Government viewing the Western 
reporters' articles and reports as anti-Semitic. Are not Arabs, 
the victims of Israeli occupation, entitled to raise their 
voices in denunciation and to urge the international community 
to assume its responsibilities? Do not both the failure to 
brief students on facts and publicity for Israel constitute 
absolute hostility to Arabs and their cause? 
  The French Government's conduct is amazing because it has 
apparently bargained the international community's principles 
and the values of justice for blind bias toward Israel, thus 
relinquishing the friendship of 200 million Arabs in favor of 
concealing Israeli crimes and implementing Israel's schemes. 
  What draws our attention is the fact that this measure 
totally conflicts with the recent decisions by the UAE 
Government with regard to tightening the boycott of Israel. 
This measure also contradicts the UAE's official policy 
condemning Israeli occupation and urging Israeli withdrawal and 
recognition of the Palestinian people's legitimate rights. The 
brothers in the UAE are aware of Israel's intransigence and 
aggression, knowing that the blood shed in the al-Ibrahimi 
Mosque massacre has not yet dried! 
  The French Government's submission to Zionist blackmail 
should not mean that Paris is in a position to determine the 
UAE's policy toward Israel, especially since the UAE is not in 
need of France as much as France is in need of Arab oil. After 
all, Arab dignity remains above all considerations.

<F P=106> [Article by Simon Abu-Fadil in the "AL-DIYAR's Horizons" </F>
column: "Amid Optimism Over the Success of Negotiations, 
Hizballah Prepares Itself by Reconsidering Its Political Line"] 
  [Text] Political circles close to American channels in 
Lebanon are optimistic that the negotiations, which stumble once 
in awhile, will eventually end the state of war between Israel 
and the Arab states. What enhances these circles' optimism is 
well known: That is the presence of a single world camp whose 
plans will not be blocked, not even by the closest allies, 
particularly Israel. The positions assumed recently by some 
Israeli officials, who accept withdrawal from Golan and the 
suspension of settlement building, support the beliefs of these 
circles, who understand the American policy to a certain extent. 
  If the course of negotiations leads to such results, how 
will 
Hizballah deal with this reality? Will it give up its 
resistance role or will it be the difficult figure in the 
equation? 
  Political sources close to Hizballah say that the party's 
leadership is well aware of what is happening in the region and 
that it reads events and developments carefully and thoroughly. 
Hence, the sources say, it will not let the party pay the price 
or be the victim of the settlement. 
  Therefore, the inner political line of Hizballah leadership 
has started to focus on how to cope with peace with Israel 
through political and social methods, particularly since the 
party believes that coping with normalization is its 
responsibility. The party is thus turning its battle with 
Israel from military resistance to fierce political resistance, 
for which all its energies and institutions have been mobilized. 
The party believes that peace with Israel is more dangerous 
than war, the sources add. 
  The same sources affirm that Hizballah leadership is totally 
aware that the regional settlement will not be halted by Iran, 
which is up to its ears in foreign debts exceeding $50 billions 
and which is in a political position similar to that of other 
Third World states as a result of domestic and surrounding 
political conditions. 
  Other sources note in this context that the Hizballah 
leadership has launched contacts with state officials with a 
view to expanding the ways to cope with the Israeli peace and 
its impact on Lebanese society. The features of the approaching 
stage in the region have become clear to the party's leadership. 
Thus, it has started to reconsider its military structure and 
to organize it and monitor it carefully to avoid any individual 
fault or emotional outburst leading to a clash with the Lebanese 
Army, which will not let any incident or violation occur in the 
future. The Hizballah leadership understands that the 
government's acknowledgement of the resistance's reality at 
present can never be allowed in the next stage, when the 
Lebanese Army takes charge of security for the south, both its 
land and people. 
  These sources add that the measures the Lebanese Army 
adopted 
recently have put all the parties involved, particularly 
Hizballah, face to face with the reality that once the army 
"takes action," it will not "leave" the land it set foot on. 
Moreover, the Army will not tolerate any disruption so long as 
its organs are capable of "reaching" all the parties to correct 
them. In this, the Army will pursue methods that safeguard the 
state's interests and will avoid claiming victims among the 
party that fails to understand that it does not bargain for the 
land it deploys on or share it with others. Any leniency in this 
is tantamount to going back to the stage in which the state 
collapsed. 
  This reading of reality might turn the party with all its 
energies toward coping with peace, the sources say. They affirm 
that the party leadership is aware of fears from clashes within 
the party or between it and other parties in al-Biqa' in the 
same way it is aware of the impact peace will have on the region.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Hizballah: Israel's Terms Betray </F>
Its Anxiety About Effectiveness of the Resistance"] 
  [Text] Beirut -- In a statement it issued yesterday, 
Hizballah reacted to the Israel call for a crackdown on the 
resistance in the south and in the occupied territories. It 
said that "their terms and demands calling for the disarmament 
of the resistance reveal the extent of the enemy's anxiety about 
the effectiveness of that resistance, its forces, and its 
ability to undermine the enemy's security and presence in the 
occupied territories. Furthermore, such terms reflect a clear 
Zionist line relying on U.S. political and military support." 
  It added that "these conditions give a very good idea of the 
attrition to which the enemy is subjected, resulting in policy 
confusion." It expressed fear that "the enemy might turn that 
problem around by exploiting some willingness to discuss these 
terms or respond to some of them, like what happened to the 
Hamas representatives in Jordan." 
  It "totally" rejected these terms, and it asked: "Do recent 
declarations by enemy leaders call for a strong and firm 
reaction or does not the matter deserve any bother by some 
people?" It warned against the "suspect trumpets trying to give 
the recent confrontations and the subsequent Zionist-Lahdist 
aggressions the label of internal disputes and to turn the 
matter toward sectarian sedition and conflict." It urged "these 
trumpets to stop these attempts, particularly as what they say 
does not indicate that they see the occupation and its agents as 
a threat to the homeland, the people, the territory, and 
sovereignty."

occupation troops fired several shells at Mimis, the al-Dahr 
hills, and the outskirts of (Mazra'at 'Ayn Bashshur). Several 
shells were also fired at Maydun and Birkat Jabbur in Western 
al-Biqa'. At 0700 this morning, three vehicles from the Lahd 
[South Lebanese Army] militias strafed areas on the 
al-Hasbani-Zymmarayya combat line for approximately 90 minutes. 
  At 0830, the occupation troops reopened the Zummarayya 
crossing gate, which they closed on Friday. A heavy traffic 
flow made up of civilian cars entered the liberated areas. 
[passage omitted] 
  The Islamic Resistance issued a statement today saying that 
to avenge the martyrs of a massacre in 'Aramta, one of its 
groups detonated an explosive device against an occupation 
patrol on a search campaign along the Kafr Huna-Jazzin road. 
One M-113 armored personnel carrier was destroyed and those 
inside either killed or wounded. Ambulances were seen rushing 
to the scene of the incident to evacuate the dead and wounded.

  [Text] Gadi Sukenik reports from Moscow that Prime 
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said he is prepared to put off dealing 
with any issue not tied to security or law and order in Gaza and 
Jericho until after the signing of the agreement with the PLO. 
Our political correspondent Gadi Sukenik, who is with the prime 
minister's entourage, reports that Prime Minister Rabin told a 
Moscow news conference a few minutes ago that he expects the 
Syrian media and its leadership -- meaning al-Asad, of course -- 
to state publicly its true desire for peace.

<F P=106> [Report by Tamar Asalem] </F>
  [Text] Knesset Member [MK] Avi Yehezqel asserted at 
today's meeting of the Labor caucus that two men are not equals 
among equals in the government and the faction. He was 
naturally referring to the prime minister and the foreign 
minister, who are steering the peace negotiations but keeping 
the faction in the dark. In response, Foreign Minister Shim'on 
Peres delivered an extended political review. 
  The faction members' questions focused on two issues: the 
conclusion of negotiations and the prime minister's remarks at a 
United Kibbutzim Movement forum concerning the evacuation of 
Golan Heights settlements. On the first issue, Peres repeated 
the remarks he made yesterday at the cabinet meeting: 
  [Begin Peres recording] There are no disagreements between 
Yitzhaq [Rabin] and me. We both believe the negotiations should 
be concluded. They could be dragged out through eternity, but I 
think -- and that is the opinion of our colleagues in Cairo, too 
-- that we should assemble all the outstanding issues in one 
cluster and resolve them in one fell swoop this coming weekend. 
[end recording] 
  Peres added that it had been agreed that only two issues 
will 
be left for Rabin's and 'Arafat's ruling: the size of Jericho, 
which the Palestinians want to be 100 square kilometers and 
Israel will agree to about 60 only; and the matter of the 
Palestinian policeman on the bridge. Peres stressed that Israel 
does not wish to leave any unresolved issues. The reports I 
receive indicate that the other side is likewise interested in 
wrapping the thing up, Peres said. [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in 
Hebrew at 1400 GMT on 25 April adds that "addressing the Labor 
caucus, Shim'on Peres said that the reports he received from 
Cairo today reflect a certain optimism. He said that after the 
prime minister returns from Russia, all the finalized issues 
will have to be revisited and decisions will have to be made on 
the outstanding issues, such as the judicial procedures and the 
air and sea space."] 
  As for rumors about disagreements between the foreign 
minister and the prime minister, Peres clarified that they were 
totally baseless. 
  Peres was forced to parry another attack by faction members, 
including MK's Avigdor Qahalani and Eli Goldschmidt from the 
Golan Heights lobby, over the prime minister's remarks about 
settlement evacuation made at the United Kibbutzim Movement 
forum. 
  [Begin Peres recording] Want peace? There is not a single 
person who does not realize that peace entails a deep and 
painful change in the Golan Heights. Whoever is ready for a 
territorial compromise understands that if we cede territory, 
our settlements will not remain there. The settlements 
themselves are not going to want to remain. [end recording] 
  It will be noted that some faction members lauded the prime 
minister's remarks. Peres, however, asked the forum to refrain 
from discussing the issue while the prime minister is abroad.

<F P=106> [ITIM report] </F>
  [Text] Moshe Shahal, minister of police, energy, and 
infrastructure, said on 22 April that peace arrangements with 
Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan would take form between the summer of 
1994 and the beginning of 1995. The minister was speaking to 
the forum of managers for advancing managerial culture in Israel 
at Tel Aviv's Open University. He said that Israel was 
demanding a period of several years between the signing of a 
peace agreement with Syria and its actual implementation in 
order to enable the parties to examine whether the agreement 
holds under different rulers and whether it indeed includes all 
the components of a normal peace. 
  Shahal asserted that Israel wished to impose a 10-year 
waiting period between the signing and the initial 
implementation of the agreement. The Syrians were prepared to 
accept a period of three years, while the United States had 
suggested a seven-year moratorium. At any rate, he added, the 
question of time did not trouble Syrian President al-Asad since 
he was also interested in putting things off. 
  In Shahal's assessment, the negotiations will hit a logjam 
if 
we do not reach agreement by the end of 1994 or the beginning of 
1995 because both the United States and Israel will enter an 
election period which will preclude any real progress in the 
peace process. "Ten minutes after the signing of a peace 
agreement with Syria, Lebanon will also sign an agreement with 
us. Jordan will sign even before the Syrians, as soon as there 
is a signal that Damascus and Jerusalem are about to reach 
agreement," Shahal said. He believes that soon after the peace 
agreements are made, five Muslim countries will establish 
diplomatic relations with Israel. 
  Shahal also said that the Gulf emirates, mainly Oman and 
Qatar, believe Israel could protect the area against an Iraqi or 
Iranian invasion and have an interest in the peace arrangements 
because they estimate the agreements would provide the emirates 
with protection. He estimated that Qatar will announce the joint 
gas project with Israel in May, adding: "I will not be 
surprised if they invite Israelis for business there." At the 
same time, Oman has accepted the possibility of starting 
business contacts with Israel even without granting it 
diplomatic recognition.

<F P=106> [Interview with Major General Dani Rothschild, the </F>
coordinator of government activities in the territories, by 
Smadar Peri -- place and date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Peri] Major General Rothschild, do you 
believe 'Arafat? 
  [Rothschild] It is not a question of whether I believe him 
or not. The question is whether he can implement the agreement. 
I believe that he wants to; however, if 'Arafat does not 
realize that he is assuming responsibility for a system as 
complicated as that of a country -- and whether or not he has 
sovereignty is of no significance here -- and if the world does 
not understand that he requires aid on a large scale, then there 
is no chance of turning a new leaf. 
  [Peri] These are certainly good times. The coordinator of 
government activities in the territories is almost conducting 
public relations on behalf of 'Arafat. 
  [Rothschild] Definitely. Not because I like 'Arafat so much 
but because I want this agreement to succeed. If the 
Palestinian authority does not show the residents that it is 
better than we were in the civilian-economic sphere, there is no 
chance of this agreement ever being implemented. 
  We can hold talks in Cairo, Paris, and Washington until the 
sun goes down but if we fail to implement what is agreed upon 
because of a lack of resources, then what have we achieved? 
Their needs will grow threefold or fourfold after the agreement 
in comparison to their needs while we were in control. If we 
also consider the fact that they will be able to collect all the 
taxes they want to, then there will really be no chance of 
getting anything done. 
  [Peri] People are saying that 'Arafat is deliberately 
stalling because he does not want the agreement at all. He does 
not want to be the mayor of Jericho and is afraid of being 
assassinated in Gaza. 
  [Rothschild] I do not know if he is afraid. I think 'Arafat 
is becoming increasingly aware of the difficulties. I believe 
that one of his fears, which have accumulated during the 
negotiations, is that he will be unable to meet the needs and 
expectations of his public. He has no choice, however, because 
with every day that goes by without changes on the ground he 
loses more supporters of the agreement. Afterwards, things will 
be even more difficult for him. 
  The more profound and detailed the negotiations become, the 
more the Palestinians realize how complicated their problem will 
prove to be; how impossible it is to bring about changes in the 
field within a short time; and to what degree the shortage of 
resources dashes any hopes of meeting the public's expectations. 
They are frightened by the burden of responsibility they will 
have to assume and the scope of the needs they will have to fill 
with regard to a population who currently receives services in 
all walks of life. 
  [Peri] You are a member of the Israeli delegation to the 
economic talks with the Palestinians. How much money do they 
need in your assessment? 
  [Rothschild] Our budget stands at 300 million shekels this 
year. They will need at least three times that amount because 
our budget does not include security. Today, we finance the 
salaries of 400 policemen. The Palestinians are talking about 
9,000 Palestinian policemen in Gaza and Jericho. Salaries are 
not everything, there is also maintenance. Whoever talks about 
adding 200 classrooms must understand that even after the 
construction work is over, one still has to pay wages to 
hundreds of teachers. They also want to increase the number of 
clerks, build residential apartment buildings, set up a sewage 
system. 
  [Peri] How do they perceive self-administration? 
  [Rothschild] It is easier to speak of Gaza because Jericho 
is a very isolated area. It all depends on the kind of 
resources the Palestinian authority will have at its disposal. 
According to studies carried out by us, the public's standard 
of living will drop by 20 to 25 percent compared to its present 
level, which is already low. 
  Unless a great deal of money is invested in the Gaza Strip 
very soon it will turn into a tinderbox. Not so much against 
Israel but primarily against the Palestinian rule. If people 
say that 'Arafat is frightened of an agreement, or at least 
hesitant, then that is the reason. 
  [Peri] What do you expect them to do? 
  [Rothschild] We are encouraging 'Arafat to appoint a 
council, but he is stalling. A decision should be made now on 
who is to head each system -- health, education, customs, and so 
forth, and these people should be brought in so as to have time 
to overlap with us before they take charge. They have to set up 
an entire economic system and to man the tax authority whose 
staff resigned at the outset of the intifadah. 
  Under the agreement, they are committed to certain levels of 
income tax, VAT [value added tax], and customs. Yet they do not 
have a system which knows how to impose, calculate, and levy the 
taxes. You cannot build such a system in a day. 
  Rami, Nabil Sha'th's son, arrived this week to acquaint 
himself with the computer system which we are going to leave to 
the Palestinian administration in Gaza. He is still in shock. 
It is a sophisticated system, and they have no one to operate 
it. You cannot work from day to day. You have to train people 
in each sphere of life. 
  This week in Cairo, for instance, the transfer of the 
Finance 
Ministry's powers was discussed; namely, that Israel is to 
cancel all its contracts with suppliers. But they do not have 
answers to the most basic questions: How will they operate 
elevators? How will they obtain oxygen for hospitals? What 
will they do about all the daily systems based on these 
contracts? 
  [Peri] Have your public and secret meetings with 
Palestinians included meetings with Hamas [Islamic Resistance 
Movement] people? 
  [Rothschild] Since Hamas is an illegal organization, people 
who meet me are only willing to admit to an affiliation with the 
universal Islamic network. I have spent many hours in 
conversation with these people. I acquired an in-depth 
acquaintance with how their network operates, what its 
objectives are, and how it seeks to achieve these objectives. 
  One of their leaders told me: We are no pistol revolution. 
We did it once in Egypt (the assassination of President 
al-Sadat), and the alternative is someone who is much more 
diffident, hesitant, and much more brutal. Therefore, our 
method is to cultivate the support of a broad social stratum. 
How? We invest in the target public everything the 
administration cannot invest. 
  [Peri] Is it possible that we screwed up, that we should 
have opted for the radicals? 
  [Rothschild] I definitely think we conducted contacts with 
people who do not necessarily represent the Palestinian society. 
The problem with Faysal al-Husayni and the other salon leaders 
was that their power stemmed from their affiliation with the 
PLO, and not from a self-built position in the Palestinian 
street. We conduct negotiations with them, but the street does 
not recognize them. 
  In my opinion, one of our mistakes was not having held 
sufficient contacts with the authentic leaders, and the 
intifadah has indeed generated such leaders. We could have 
found them in prisons. On the Palestinian street. One does not 
necessarily make political agreements with them, but a dialogue 
with them is definitely possible. But it should be understood: 
I will not propose -- and I never have -- that we hold contacts 
with Hamas, whose motto is the destruction of Israel. 
  [Peri] I understand from your answer that the agenda should 
have been turned around: We should have started with the local 
radicals -- not Hamas -- and bring in the Tunis wheeler-dealers 
afterward. We should have skipped al-Husayni, 'Ashrawi, and the 
likes. 
  [Rothschild] Yes. We should have started out by talking 
with the street leaders. With those who are capable of getting 
5,000 or 10,000 people out to hurl stones. They would have been 
capable of getting the same 10,000 to extend olive branches. 
The PLO alone cannot do it. 
  I have always been in favor of launching a dialogue with the 
street leaders, because you can run the area with them, and they 
have no problem cooperating with us. Guys like Hisham 
'Abd-al-Raziq or Sufyan Abu-Zayidah, who have served many years 
in prison -- they are not afraid. They have already thrown 
their grenades. Faysal al-Husayni cannot criticize them, 
because they will immediately answer: And where have you been? 
  [Peri] If we indeed made a mistake in this issue, is it 
still possible to fix it? 
  [Rothschild] We are fixing it, because now we are holding a 
dialogue with representatives of the Palestinian street. 
  [Peri] It is still unclear who will rule the territories: 
'Arafat and the people from Tunis, or the young local leadership? 
  [Rothschild] I am convinced that if the people from Tunis do 
not give the local youngsters a measure of control, they will 
find it very hard to rule. The young generation, however, will 
also find it hard to go it alone. Even if they are considered 
the leaders in the streets of Gaza, they have no funds. Only a 
combination of PLO funds -- raised by regular contributions and 
organized by a well-ordered system -- and the authentic local 
leadership, can provide some chances for normal functioning. 
  [Peri] Will the real problems in the territories surface 
only after the withdrawal, with the present level of terrorism 
being only a sort of prelude? 
  [Rothschild] I am not all that concerned about the security 
problem, although it tops our list of priorities. I believe the 
IDF [Israel Defense Forces] is strong enough to solve this 
problem eventually. It is very possible that the Palestinian 
police will be interested in proving it can cope with terrorism 
within the area under its jurisdiction, whereas terrorism will 
still prevail in the areas under our control. 
  [Peri] Do you believe that the Palestinian police will be 
able to squelch Hamas activity? 
  [Rothschild] I believe that the primary objective of the 
Palestinian police will be not to prevent Hamas attacks against 
us, but rather to foil attacks on the Palestinian council, to 
prevent Hamas taking over the streets and its attempts to 
disrupt daily affairs in Gaza and Jericho. They will leave it 
to us to foil Hamas attacks against Israel. 
  [Peri] If Israel has early warnings about a Hamas attack, 
will the Palestinian police cooperate with us, or will it leak 
the information to Hamas members? 
  [Rothschild] According to the agreement between us, if there 
is a warning about somebody who plans attacks against us, the 
PLO has to foil these attacks. We must remember, however, that 
the Palestinian police will not be homogeneous. There will 
probably be some people there whose opinions do not necessarily 
coincide with those of the PLO. There are enough people in Gaza 
who find this agreement utterly disagreeable and who will do 
everything possible to foil it, including attacks on Israelis 
and on the Palestinian autonomy institutions. 
  [Peri] The Palestinian street is a great and frightening 
unknown. Do you find a deep and eternal hatred for us there? 
  [Rothschild] There is hatred, but I would not term it 
eternal. It is a hatred which is not politically motivated, but 
is rather constituted of negative feelings toward our behavior, 
whether this behavior is justified or not. A son who sees his 
father under detention, or who has to undergo brutal searches 
and insults can never forget this -- nothing will change this 
fact. I am not talking here about those wounded and killed. 
  [Peri] What about the slight to their honor? 
  [Rothschild] The insult done to their honor is one of the 
main factors contributing to their hatred. This hatred, 
however, is limited only to those affected, and does not mean 
that the Palestinians will not be able to coexist with us over 
the long term. 
  [Peri] What does coexistence with the Israelis mean for the 
Palestinians? 
  [Rothschild] It is a slogan for wanting to receive all the 
benefits Israel can give them without Israeli presence in the 
territories. It means working in Israel, trading with us, and 
enjoying Israeli freedom. 
  I believe that over the prolonged months of negotiations 
'Arafat has learned about a Palestinian public he was unfamiliar 
with. This is a public which has learned a lot from us over the 
last 26 years. It is a demanding public which has learned to use 
the media. They used CNN against us, and now they are using it 
against 'Arafat. It is not the public to which 'Arafat was 
accustomed in Beirut, Amman, or Tunis, a public which was used 
to obey his every order. 
  [Peri] Do you hear them criticize 'Arafat? 
  [Rothschild] Now they criticize him openly, whereas once 
they dared to criticize him only secretly. The difference is 
that today they give vent to their criticism openly over the 
pages of AL-QUDS. They say that if 'Arafat believes he can 
establish the 23d dictatorship in the Middle East here, he is 
mistaken. It is not only that somebody is willing to write this 
down, there is also somebody who is willing to publish this 
criticism. [passage omitted] 
  [Peri] You sound very pessimistic. 
  [Rothschild] I am not pessimistic, I am concerned. If the 
agreement we achieved will not be implemented on the ground, we 
will have achieved nothing. Unfortunately, we can do very 
little to help implement this agreement. The chances of 
implementing it depend on how the Palestinians shoulder the 
responsibility, their ability to manage affairs and their 
leadership. I am rather worried about all of this, because I 
still do not see any signs that the Palestinian side is ready to 
assume this responsibility.

<F P=106> [Report by military correspondent Eytan Rabin] </F>
  [Text] Yesterday, at a news conference in Bucharest, 
Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati was asked by IDF 
Radio correspondent Udi Segal why Iran continues holding 
Navigator Ron Arad. The Iranian foreign minister replied: "I 
firmly deny that there are Israeli MIA's on Iranian territory." 
  This was the first time the Iranian foreign minister 
publicly 
answered an Israeli correspondent and reacted to the claim that 
Iran is holding Israeli MIA's or POW's. Commenting on 
Velayati's remark, an Israeli source said last night that, as 
far as Israel is concerned, Iran is responsible for the MIA's 
and POW's. 
  The source said that Velayati's remarks "do not relieve Iran 
of its responsibility for the Israeli MIA's and POW's. It may 
well be that none are held on Iranian soil, but we hold Iran 
responsible for the affair." 
  According to the Israeli source, Israel continues dealing 
with the issue of the MIA's and POW's on all levels, including a 
special effort in the international arena, in order to bring the 
affair to an end.

  [Excerpt] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres said yesterday 
that Israel holds Iran responsible for the fate of captive 
navigator Ron Arad. As recalled, in reply to a question posed 
by an IDF radio correspondent, the Iranian foreign minister 
denied that any Israeli prisoners are being held on Iranian 
soil. Iran is now officially denying that its foreign minister 
ever spoke to a Zionist correspondent. Our correspondent Eyal 
Eisenstein spoke with Foreign Minister Peres: 
  [Begin recording] [Eisenstein] Foreign Minister Shim'on 
Peres was skeptical with regard to Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali 
Akbar Velayati's statements on the issue of the Israeli POW's 
and MIA's. Yesterday, Peres said that Israel still considers 
Iran responsible for the fate of captive navigator Ron Arad. 
  [Peres] Iran's word carries no particular weight. Iran has 
no problem with making up or denying stories, without any 
foundation. Therefore, regardless of this or that statement, we 
shall continue to regard Iran as the main party responsible for 
the fate of Ron Arad. [passage omitted] [end recording]

  [Text] Four more Iraqi citizens last night entered Israel 
from across the Jordanian border, seeking political asylum in 
Israel. Our correspondent Karmela Menashe reports that they 
crossed the border fence near the Allenby Bridge, and were 
arrested by IDF [Israel Defense Forces] soldiers. They were 
unarmed. Two days ago, two Iraqi citizens crossed the border 
from Jordan near Kefar Rupin.

<F P=106> [Report by Yerah Tal] </F>
  [Excerpt] Last night, the Tzomet Central Committee 
approved the new party constitution by a majority of 58 to 30. 
Only 90 of the 250 committee members attended the vote. 
  Sources in Tzomet said that the fact that the constitution, 
which was supported by Tzomet Chairman Refa'el Eytan, did not 
win a sweeping majority is a further indication that Eytan is 
losing his power in Tzomet. 
  According to the new constitution, the chairman may appoint 
party functionaries, and his only obligation is to report the 
appointment to the party council and management. It was also 
decided that the chairman will be the party's candidate for 
prime minister and will be authorized to select and appoint 
candidates for the posts of minister and deputy minister, 
needing only to present the list to the Central Committee 
without asking for its authorization. [passage omitted]

  [Text] In an exclusive interview conducted by 'Adil Malik 
for Jordan Television, His Majesty King Husayn has made the 
following remarks: 
  [Begin recording] [Malik] Your Majesty King Husayn: You 
have accustomed Jordanians to being informed about developments 
that concern them. What do you have to say to your compatriots 
today, following this meeting with the U.S. secretary of state? 
  [Husayn] I believe that the meeting was fruitful and useful. 
The climate of the talks was cordial and frank. Concerning the 
issue that is the focus of attention, it is the issue of peace. 
He [U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher] is obviously on 
his way to the region to activate things in a positive 
direction. I have learned that they [the Americans] have the 
same concerns we have concerning the fact that, for various 
reasons, enthusiasm for peace has recently suffered some 
setbacks. The parties concerned also feel this. Progress on a 
certain pivotal track has been very heartening. This is what I 
have to say as far as the issue of peace is concerned. 
  As for another issue that we addressed, it is the issue of 
al-'Aqabah. It concerns the treatment of Jordan in a manner 
that could no longer be accepted or condoned. They have 
accepted our view. It seems that the issue is about to be 
resolved appropriately and satisfactorily. We expect.... 
  [Malik, interrupting] Can we expect a change in the method 
of 
inspections? 
  [Husayn] The blockade will be ended very soon. The ships 
that have been deployed there will be moved. A proper 
arrangement involving the use of a neutral party will be in 
place, something that we have proposed (?from the outset). 
  [Malik] Sir, one last word on the fate of the peace process. 
Have you seen any new horizons for addressing the problem at 
this point? 
  [Husayn] Sir, as far as I am concerned, the problem does not 
lie with the question of peace. For peace is undoubtedly a 
great objective. But, at the same time, one should contemplate 
the alternative should efforts fail, and should we fail to 
achieve anything. The peace I am speaking of is a durable, 
just, and comprehensive peace that future generations can 
accept. This is what we insist on and focus on. It seems to me 
that there are still great hopes for efforts to move in this 
direction. 
  [Malik] Thank you, sir. 
  [Husayn] Thank you, sir. [end recording]

<F P=106> [News conference by King Husayn and U.S. Secretary of State </F>
Warren Christopher with unidentified correspondents in London on 
25 April--recorded, in English; passages in italics in Arabic] 
  [Text] [Husayn] Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to express 
before you once again joy at having the opportunity to meet a 
very dear and old friend [words indistinct] Christopher here. 
We've had some very, very fruitful, open, and frank discussions 
on a number of issues of mutual interest to us, but also to all 
of you. I'm very happy indeed to have had this chance. I'm sure 
you have questions that you wish to address to the secretary and 
myself, and we'll be more than happy to respond to them. 
  [Christopher] Good morning, or good afternoon, I guess it is 
by now. I did have the honor of meeting with King Husayn again 
here in his residence in London, and I have to say that we've 
had a very constructive discussion of a number of issues. We, 
of course, discussed the peace process and the importance of 
pushing for progress on all four of the tracks, looking toward 
and understanding the great importance of comprehensive peace. 
We talked about resumption on the four bilateral tracks in 
Washington D.C. rather soon after I complete this visit to the 
Middle East. We particularly agreed on the importance of moving 
forward to rapid implementation of the Declaration of Principles 
between the Israelis and the Palestinians after they conclude 
their agreement which we hope will be in the very near future. 
  On a matter of importance, I informed his majesty that, 
subject to some fine tuning, the United States Government will 
support the establishment of a land-based regime for verifying 
enforcement of sanctions against Iraq. The inspections will be 
carried out by a private independent, not-for-profit company of 
international stature and integrity, Lloyds Register of the 
United Kingdom, which will operate at the port of al-'Aqabah. 
The United States is convinced that this new inspection regime 
will be as effective as the MIF [Multinational Interdiction 
Force], effective in guaranteeing that no Iraqi trade will 
transit al-'Aqabah other than transactions which have been 
specifically permitted by the United Nations. Indeed, we 
believe that in some respects land-based inspections will [word 
indistinct] an improvement in our ability to enforce sanctions 
against Iraq. And I want to emphasize that the king and I 
discussed these matters today, and the United States and Jordan 
and our MIF partners are all fully and definitely committed to 
the enforcement of the sanctions. After careful study, I'm glad 
to say we became convinced that this proposal for a new 
inspection regime not only takes into account in response to the 
legitimate concerns that his majesty has indicated to me on a 
prior occasion, but will also make it easier to sustain and 
enhance the sanctions against Iraq. The king and I have agreed 
that Jordan and the United States will cooperate closely 
together with the Sanctions Committee and other interested 
parties to effectuate and establish this new on-shore 
enforcement regime to make it work efficiently and 
expeditiously. Thank you very much, and as the king said, we'll 
be glad to try to respond to questions that you have. 
  [Correspondent] Your Majesty, does this mean now, this new 
development, that you can participate fully in the Middle East 
peace process? And can you tell us a little bit more on how 
will this actually operate on shore? 
  [Husayn] Well, initially I believe it was a Jordanian 
suggestion that we have discussed with our friends over a long 
period of time to try to address the problems that we are facing 
and which caused us in Jordan tremendous damage not only in the 
material sense but also the feeling that Jordan was treated in a 
way that was different to any treatment of other neighbors of 
Iraq. So, the idea that is now adopted is one that we have 
looked at and we have contributed in terms of the recent past, 
and I am very happy indeed that we see eye-to-eye on this 
particular approach. 
  At the same time, I would like to make it very very clear, 
that we are, and have been, adhering to Security Council 
resolutions and implementing them to the best of our ability. 
And as the secretary has mentioned, we are very very deeply 
concerned with the suffering of the Iraqi people as a result of 
this whole situation that Iraq has faced over a number of years. 
And we hope that conditions will permit an end to this 
nightmare as far as the people are concerned before too long. 
  [Correspondent] Your Majesty, did you today agree on a date 
to resume talks with Israel in Washington as part of the 
four-track process? 
  [Husayn] [Words indistinct] secretary's visit to the region 
will determine that probably. But as far as we are concerned, 
no one has, we believe, contributed more to the cause of peace 
or has been committed more to that than we in Jordan. At least, 
we are equal with the best of the flock, [word indistint] ahead 
of them. And It's something that we say with pride and with a 
feeling that we have always realized our responsibilities 
towards future generations. So, the cause of peace is very very 
dear to us. But we have done our best so far and I think we've 
moved, helped move the process along through the various stages 
that have passed. Now, we will look and see what developments 
will occur. Our problem that we raised, I believe, is addressed 
now in a satisfactory manner; that is, that of al-'Aqabah and 
the continuing suffering that we've endured over a period of 
time there. So I hope that the secretary will meet with every 
success during his trip to the area. And as far as peace is 
concerned, it's very dear to us and it's an area where we will 
do whatever we can, whenever we can, to see a comprehensive 
peace in that region that will transform it and give future 
generations a chance to live as they desire. 
  [Correspondent] Your Majesty, would you like to see the 
easing of the naval blockade as the first step towards totally 
lifting the sanctions on Iraq? 
  [Husayn] Definitely, this is a part of it and I hope that we 
will see it end as a mechanism comes into place to provide all 
with a satisfactory solution to the problem. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Christopher, are you aware of any secret 
talks between Israel and Iraq? 
  [Christopher] No. [mild laughter in audience] 
  [Correspondent] Can you tell us when this naval blockade of 
al-'Aqabah could be lifted, and why it wasn't lifted before? 
  [Christopher] Well, we're talking now about the 
Multinational 
Interception Force which had its purpose preventing violations 
of the sanctions regime. I spoke of some fine tuning, and by 
that I mean we do need to have some consultations with the other 
members of that force to find the best way to carry and to 
effect this on-shore regime. I think they'll be very prompt. I 
can't give you a definite date, but I think it will be in the 
very near future that we are able to shift over to the on-shore 
inspection regime. You asked why it was not done in the future 
[as heard] and I think the fact is that the enforcement of the 
sanctions is highly important. It was done efficiently and 
effectively by the Multinational Interception Force, but this, 
as it turned out, was having a very adverse effect here in 
Jordan, and so, we responded to the king's request to try to 
search for an alternative mechanism. We wanted to satisfy 
ourselves that the alternative mechanism could work. We have 
concluded that it will, and we are going to move to put it into 
effect as soon as possible. I think it's a, I believe it is 
common ground between the king and the United States that this 
will not resolve in any attenuation of the sanctions regime 
itself, but indeed as simply an alternative, and perhaps more 
effective way of carrying out the regime. The sanctions 
themselves can only be lifted, in the view of the United States, 
when there is full compliance by Iraq with the United Nations 
Security Council resolutions. 
  [Correspondent] Your Majesty, you recently made some 
comments 
about the status of Jerusalem in the final solution. Did the 
question come up at all and what is Jordan's stand on the final 
status of Jerusalem in an overall peace settlement? 
  [Husayn] I don't think we discussed the final status of 
Jerusalem today, but our friends are aware of it, and that it is 
clear in my mind that there are two facades to the problem; one 
which is political and demographic in terms of Security Council 
Resolution 242, in terms of the rights of the Palestinian 
brethren there, in the hope that Jerusalem will be the symbol 
and the essence of peace between the Israelis and the 
Palestinians. And the other is in regard to the holy places, 
and our hope, and our determination is to do anything we can to 
serve what we believe is the [words indistinct] that small area 
should be that important to all the followers of the three great 
religions, that sovereignty over those holy places should be to 
God only, and that we should encourage the ongoing dialogue 
between the followers of the three monotheistic religions. And 
I hope, eventually, that we will find a status that will make 
Jerusalem once more the essence and the symbol of peace between 
the followers of these three great religions. 
  [Correspondent] Your Majesty: Jordan has troops in Bosnia. 
Did you discuss the latest developments in Bosnia with the 
secretary? And what is the feeling, what is your own feeling 
about the situation of the Muslims now in Bosnia? 
  [Husayn] It is one of deep anxiety. And we do have troops 
there. And I believe we probably have the second largest 
contingent of UN forces after France there. And we will try our 
very very best to serve the cause of peace and justice for all, 
and alleviate the suffering of people there. I think it is a 
very, very dangerous, difficult moment. And it is a test, not 
only for the goodwill of people in the world, but for the United 
Nations and its future, and for the credibility of the UN, and 
the credibility of the world in terms of its ability to address 
such problems adequately and to arrive at solutions that are 
just and fair. 
  [Correspondent] Your Majesty: How soon do you expect to see 
a comprehensive peace for the Middle East? 
  [Husayn] I wish it were with me, we would probably progress 
much more rapidly. But, there are many other parties involved. 
However, I believe that what is important at this stage, and I 
am sure that the secretary feels the same way, is that the 
overwhelming majority of people, what I call the peace camp on 
either side of the divide, we have in the recent past seen a 
change. And there was so much enthusiasm for peace, and so much 
hope. It hasn't been dampened by the recent tragic events and 
by the slow pace of progress in attaining a just and 
comprehensive peace. I hope that the secretary's efforts, and 
the efforts of all concerned will see us really address problems 
seriously, and with total commitment and determination. And I 
can't give a timeframe. But, I hope it will be as soon as 
possible. 
  [Correspondent] Excuse me Your Majesty: Two more questions, 
please, ladies and gentlemen. 
  [Correspondent] [as heard] Why didn't the United States work 
hard to make United Nations resolutions work in Bosnia like it 
did with Iraq? 
  [Christopher] You mean where [words indistinct]? 
  [Correspondent] I said in Bosnia. Why did the United 
Nations' resolutions not work like they worked in Iraq? 
  [Christopher] First, let me say that his majesty and I did 
have a good discussion of, with respect to Bosnia today. We 
talked about the recent progress that has been made there in 
connection with Sarajevo. We talked about the federation that 
has been formed between the Croatians and the Muslims in Bosnia, 
both of those being positive steps. The United States is 
working very intensely to try to achieve an end to the killing 
there, and have a settlement that would bring some peace to that 
land. We are also trying very hard to contain the situation 
within Bosnia itself. No one would regard this as a simple 
problem. All would agree that it is extremely complex. The 
United States is devoting great energy to carrying out the 
United Nations resolutions, as well as to trying to seek peace 
there. You know the long list of things the United States has 
done in connection with this largest humanitarian contributor 
out of many other nations, the no-fly zone. The flights bring 
food in the longest airlift in history. Ten million meals have 
been dropped most recently, leading the way to a NATO coalition, 
which first established an ultimatum for Sarajevo, which brought 
some measure of normality to that city, and now leading the way 
to NATO resolution, which seems to be working this morning in 
Gorazde. The United States will continue to devote its efforts 
to achieve some more rational settlement of the situation in 
Bosnia. 
  [Correspondent] Your Majesty, you threatened not to 
return to the peace negotiations if the siege on the port of 
al-'Aqabah is not lifted. Has there been any new development, 
particularly after your meeting? 
  [Husayn] [Words indistinct] a positive development in 
what was conveyed to me today by the U.S. media that this siege 
is about to be lifted on al-'Aqabah. They accepted what we 
suggested regarding finding another way to address the problem 
in a satisfactory manner. 
  [Correspondent] Will you return to the negotiating 
table with Israel soon? 
  [Husayn] I believe that we offered much, and perhaps 
more than others did, to serve the objective of establishing a 
just and lasting peace in the region. We are committed to doing 
the impossible to reach a just, honorable, lasting, and 
comprehensive peace in the region, which will return the rights 
to their owners, particularly the Palestinian rights on the 
Palestinian national soil, and which will also give the 
generations an opportunity to live under circumstances different 
from those under which we lived. In fact, our commitment has not 
changed. We do not know precisely what the coming phase will be 
in terms of the secretary of state's move in the region. We 
said clearly and frankly that we are suffering from a problem, 
which we have long been suffering from, with regard to the port 
of al-'Aqabah and that this problem should be addressed. It 
seems that this treatment is now [sentence incomplete as 
heard] 
  [Correspondent] What about the harassments made by the 
Israeli prime minister with regard to the Hamas issue? It seems 
that he is interfering in Jordan's internal affairs. There are 
clear harassments. What are your reactions to these 
harassments? 
  [Husayn] Sir, the reaction is simple. In fact, with 
regard to the whole issue, the reply would have been clearer if 
these statements were not made by the Israeli prime minister 
with the foreign minister attending. With much simplicity, we 
are against terrorism; we have always been against terrorism and 
we fought it and paid a dear price with the blood of our sons 
and kinsfolk in Jordan while standing against terrorism from any 
source whatsoever. With regard to the Palestinian dimension, we 
practically ['amaliyan] deal with the PLO, the sole legitimate 
representative of the Palestinian Arab people. We stressed this 
decision in Rabat in 1974. Israel is now negotiating with this 
organization and the Palestinian side regarding the Palestinian 
rights on the Palestinian national soil. We practically do not 
recognize any other organization and will not allow it to carry 
out its activity on Jordanian soil in a way that threatens the 
Palestinian arena with division. Since the beginning of the 
phase of working for peace and since the PLO embarked on its 
steps I have frequently said, cautioned, and appealed to the 
Palestinian brothers to be one hand and one heart in this phase. 
We do not seek division and fragmentation but the closure of 
ranks, and we only deal with the PLO. 
  [Correspondent] Your Majesty the King, are you 
satisfied with the level of coordination with the Arab parties 
in the peace talks? You always said that you wanted these talks 
to be based on [Resolution] 242. Is this resolution still valid 
when we see some Arab parties working alone, for example? Not 
all parties are actually coordinating, and this is what is 
surfacing. 
  [Husayn] Sir, naturally, I will continue to hope that 
coordination will be at the required level. Matters are only 
judged by their results. So far, I do not believe that 
coordination is at the level required by the situation and 
through addressing a cause with such a degree of accuracy and 
seriousness, not only at the level of the parties concerned but 
also with regard to the atmosphere we are experiencing as an 
Arab nation in this crisis. However, we hope that matters will 
improve.

  [Text] Jordanian Prime Minister 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali has 
stressed that his country received positive signals concerning a 
solution in the near future to the siege clamped on the Port of 
al-'Aqabah. He noted that U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher might convey to Jordan's Monarch King Husayn such a 
U.S. position during their meeting in London today. 
  At a news conference, al-Majali said that Washington is 
serious about reaching a solution to this issue, and that the 
United States has accepted Jordan's proposal to deploy observers 
from Lloyds Register at the Port of al-'Aqabah instead of 
inspecting ships at sea. However, he said that if the present 
situation continues, Jordan will adhere to its stand of 
suspending its participation in the peace talks. He noted that 
Syria supports the Jordanian stand on the siege on al-'Aqabah, 
and that a Syrian-Jordanian meeting will be held before the 
resumption of bilateral talks with Israel, which are scheduled 
to begin in early May.

  [Text] Amman, 25 Apr (PETRA)--Prime Minister Dr. 
'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali has stated that there is no political 
dimension in the call of His Highness Prince Hasan, the regent, 
for reconsidering the valid procedures for the residence of West 
Bank citizens in the kingdom. He added that this procedural 
issue was aimed at facilitating measures for citizens arriving 
and departing across the bridges because of the growing pressure 
on state organs at the bridges. Thousands of citizens, he said, 
cross the bridges every day. 
  During his meeting with the representatives and 
correspondents of Arab and foreign news agencies and newspapers 
accredited in Jordan, Dr. al-Majali asserted that nothing 
decisive and final has been issued so far regarding the siege of 
al-'Aqabah. 
  The prime minister denied that there were U.S. conditions 
for 
lifting the siege on the Port of al-'Aqabah, noting that Jordan 
has announced that it will send a very low-level delegation to 
the multilateral negotiations to express its dissatisfaction 
with the contradiction between the objectives of the 
multilateral negotiations, which have economic and social aims 
in the region, and the maintenance of a siege or punitive 
measures on one of the parties. This, he said, will destabilize 
the national economy that should be improved as a result of 
these negotiations. 
  The prime minister appealed to the fraternal Arab countries 
to reschedule their political differences just as they 
reschedule their economic debts. He also said that the recent 
accelerating events in the region, particularly the Hebron 
massacre and the situation in the Port of al-'Aqabah, have 
contributed to halting the peace process, pending positive signs 
on outstanding issues. He added that Jordan's decision to enter 
the negotiations had nothing to do with the siege of al-'Aqabah 
but was due to Jordan's firm strategy toward peace. Jordan, he 
added, was among the states that first carried the torch of 
peace in this region. 
  Following are the proceedings of the prime minister's 
meeting: 
  Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali has said that 
there is no political dimension in the call of His Highness 
Crown Prince Hasan, the regent, for reconsidering valid 
procedures for the residence of West Bank citizens in the 
kingdom, adding that it is simply a procedural issue at the 
bridges and the kingdom's other border points. The continued 
pressure at the bridges makes it incumbent on the state organs 
to change and improve many of these routine procedures. 
  He added that are no procedures and instructions that can 
satisfy everybody and cover every case. Therefore, an issue 
requiring certain measures emerges from time to time and new 
developments have to be considered. 
  Speaking about what is new concerning the al-'Aqabah siege, 
the prime minister said that so far no decisive and final 
decision has been made on this issue. However, he noted, there 
is an inclination to remove this cloud and that the preparations 
for that are underway. Perhaps a statement on this issue will 
be made following His Majesty King Husayn's meeting with the 
U.S. secretary of state. 
  If the situation remains the same, then the Jordanian stand 
is clear. We have announced that our representation at the 
multilateral negotiations will be minimal as an expression of 
how we feel toward the contradiction between the objectives of 
the multilateral negotiations, which have economic and social 
aims in the region, and the maintenance of a siege or sanctions 
on one of the parties, which will destabilize the national 
economy that these negotiations seek to improve. 
  Speaking about the options Jordan presented as solutions to 
the al-'Aqabah siege, the prime minister said that Jordan 
proposed that a nonpolitical and nonprofitmaking party carry out 
observation rather inspection operations at the Port of 
al-'Aqabah while Jordanian customs personnel inspect the 
containers which arrive on board the ships. 
  He added that the recommended party is Lloyd's Register, 
whose task will be confined to observation and inspection of 
shipping documents. It will then present reports to responsible 
parties on the implementation of resolutions which deal with 
sanctions on Iraq. 
  He said that Jordan made it very clear that it will not 
allow 
any foreign party whatsoever to encroach on Jordan's sovereignty 
over its own soil. Al-Majali said this in response to reports 
that Jordan had agreed to replace naval inspections by U.S.-led 
multinational forces with ground inspections. 
  He noted that the United States had made inquiries about 
parties to carry out inspection operations and that it presented 
a report to U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who may 
brief His Majesty King Husayn on some details and 
recommendations of this report during their anticipated meeting 
later today. 
  He said that the U.S. side had almost accepted this 
Jordanian 
proposal and that the details concerning the action plan and the 
financing of this party are currently under discussion. 
  Al-Majali noted that Jordan had explained to the 
international quarters its stand that al-'Aqabah is Jordan's 
gate to the world and not to Iraq only. He added that if the 
alliance forces want to make sure that Jordanian goods are not 
being exported to Iraq, then inspection and observation should 
take place at the Jordanian-Iraqi borders.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Husayn-Christopher Meeting is Crowned With </F>
Satisfactory Results"] 
  [Text] His Majesty King Husayn has convinced the U.S. 
Administration of the need to address the issue of the siege 
imposed on the Port of al-'Aqabah and to stop harassing the 
port-bound ships. 
  The U.S. Administration has responded to Jordan's call for 
another method of searching vessels, one that will not harm 
Jordan's economy and trade. The U.S. Administration's 
understanding of the Jordanian position on this issue was 
evident during His Majesty King Husayn's meeting with 
Christopher in London yesterday. The U.S. secretary, who will 
start a Middle East tour following his meeting with his majesty 
the king, emphasized that Washington is seriously considering 
Jordan's desire to see a change in the method of inspecting 
Iraqi trade via Jordan and to shift inspection from sea to land. 
  This is a positive development in the U.S. position on the 
siege of al-'Aqabah. This development denotes a U.S. desire to 
see Jordan resume its role in the peace process. However, as 
His Majesty King Husayn said, the resumption of Jordan's role 
and efforts in support of the peace process hinges upon the 
outcome of Christopher's Middle East tour and his meetings with 
the officials of the Arab cordon [al-tawq] states. Jordan, as 
his majesty stressed, is keen on the success of the process, 
which should lead to a just and comprehensive peace based on 
Security Council Resolutions 242, 338, and 425 and the principle 
of trading land for peace. 
  If the U.S. secretary makes sufficient efforts during his 
Middle East tour to convince or force Israel to abide by the 
principle of withdrawal from all of the occupied Arab 
territories and on all fronts, the peace process may proceed at 
a reasonable pace and in a satisfactory manner, and negotiations 
on the four tracks will overcome the obstacles planted by Israel 
along their course. Otherwise, Israel and the U.S. 
Administration will be responsible for any failure in the peace 
process.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "To Reverse a Wrong Course Is a Virtue] </F>
  [Text] In the wake of yesterday's meeting with His Majesty 
King Husayn, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher stressed 
that his country has responded to Jordan's proposals on the 
al-'Aqabah Port inspections. We can only welcome such a 
development, which Jordan has been seeking and struggling to 
achieve. 
  Understandably, America's reverse of its unjustified 
position 
on the al-'Aqabah Port is considered an abandonment of wrong 
course. Welcoming such a move, we hope to see pertinent measures 
on the ground as soon as possible, especially since the 
imposition of this iniquitous sea blockade has been targeting 
Jordan and its economy more than any other country. 
  Undoubtedly, the U.S. decision to give up such an erroneous 
course against Jordan must be attributed to His Majesty King 
Husayn's brave insistence that this blockade be lifted before 
Jordan resumes any active participation in any negotiations in 
the context of the Middle East peace process. 
  U.S. approval to stop the sea piracy measures that have been 
exercised against Jordan for over three years means that it is 
abandoning a course that blemished Jordan's position and image, 
despite the fact that Jordan has declared its commitment to 
international resolutions and played an undeniable part in 
boosting the peace process. 
  We welcome such a development in the U.S. position on 
Jordan. 
We view it as a reverse of a grave mistake that the United 
States has been committing against us without any adequate 
justification. At the same time, we firmly support his majesty 
the king who confidently led a courageous and aggressive 
diplomatic thrust that eventually convinced the United States to 
respond to our objective proposals in this regard.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Siege Removal, Peace, Christopher Tour"] </F>
  [Text] The U.S. receptiveness toward Jordan's legitimate 
demand that the blockade of Jordan's only outlet to the sea be 
ended meets the requirements of mutual respect and Jordan's 
legitimate right that it be spared undue pressure to promote 
certain goals. 
  Now that Christopher has informed His Majesty King Husayn 
that measures are being taken toward lifting the siege of the 
Port of al-'Aqabah and acknowledged Jordan has incurred losses 
as a consequence, follow-through is needed to propel the peace 
process forward and to advance the cause of security and 
stability in a region plagued by turbulence and turmoil since 
the founding of the state of Israel. 
  On the eve of Secretary Christopher's Middle East tour, it 
is 
worth making this point: If we are to sell true peace to the 
peoples of the region, then promises of peace, stability, and 
prosperity need to be converted into physical realities based on 
justice and Israel's compliance with what it takes to bring 
peace to the region; namely, the UN resolutions granting the 
Palestinian people's right to repatriation and mandating the 
withdrawal from the occupied Palestinian and Arab territories. 
  The pessimism and frustration that has gripped the region 
since the negotiations got stuck on all tracks must be laid at 
Israel's doorstep. For, they are the result of the obstacles 
Israel has placed in the path of the efforts to promote a just 
settlement under which Palestinian and Arab rights are assured. 
  If the negotiations are to emerge from crisis and a regional 
explosion is to be averted, Israel's regimen of terror, 
aggression, and repression of innocents must end. It is hoped 
that Christopher's tour will set out to achieve these goals and 
that the removal of the blockade on the Port of al-'Aqabah will 
be followed by other steps. One of these would be to shift the 
pressure on the Arab parties involved in the negotiations to the 
party where it rightly belongs -- Israel, the true enemy of an 
equitable peace and stability.

<F P=106> [By JORDAN TIMES staff reporter Ayman al-Safadi] </F>
  [Text] Amman -- Jordan on Monday [25 April] welcomed as a 
"positive step" Israeli statements indicating readiness for 
making territorial compromise and dismantling the settlements in 
the occupied Arab territories in return for peace with the Arabs. 
  "I believe what (Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin) said 
is positive...it is the first time he makes such a statement and 
it (means) an acceptance of the truth that peace cannot be 
achieved as long as the settlements exist in their current 
shape," Prime Minister 'Abd al-Salam al-Majali told reporters. 
  Restating Jordan's position that settlements are an obstacle 
to peace, Dr. al-Majali said the Hebron massacre was a major 
factor in "shaking the idea of building and keeping settlements." 
  Dr. al-Majali said Jordan was ready to hold the meetings of 
the Jordanian-Palestinian coordination committees, blaming the 
failure of these committees to meet on the Palestinian 
engagement with the autonomy talks in Egypt. 
  He said this engagement partly justifies the Palestine 
Liberation Organisation's (PLO) failure to hold the meetings of 
these committees but "does not justify it fully because a long 
time has passed (since the formation of committees)." He said, 
"our fear for the absence of coordination is that our brothers 
in the organisation do not have enough experience in certain 
issues and we are more experienced than them and could help them 
and avoid harm." 
  But coordination with Syria "is at its best," said Dr. 
al-Majali adding that Syria supports Jordan's demand for an end 
to the siege on al-'Aqabah and the two countries along with 
other Arab partners will meet to coordinate before the 
resumption of the bilateral peace talks. 
  He said the Hebron massacre and the siege on al-'Aqabah 
contributed to the halting of the peace talks until the 
emergence of positive signs about these issues. 
  Dr. al-Majali rejected accusations that his government 
lacked 
a strategy on the process or its media policy, saying Jordan was 
among the first countries to seek peace in the region. 
  Reiterating Jordan's commitment to a comprehensive peace in 
the Middle East, the prime minister said Jordan will be ready 
for discussing all issues related to the peace process when it 
resumes. 
  He said Jordan will take into consideration developments on 
other tracks of the negotiations which will lead to peace 
treaties in accordance with the Madrid formula. 
  Dr. al-Majali repeated Jordan's rejection of Israel's 
"illogical" demands to sign a peace treaty before resolving the 
issues on the agenda for the talks signed by the two countries 
in September last year. 
  He said the objective of the negotiations is to reach a 
peace 
treaty but only after all issues in the agenda have been 
resolved. 
  In reply to a question on the status of the Islamic 
Resistance Movement, Hamas, in Jordan, Dr. al-Majali reiterated 
that Jordan does not accept "any illegal grouping" and will only 
deal with the PLO as the representative of the Palestinian 
people. 
  Dr. al-Majali said Jordanian relations with some Gulf Arab 
countries have improved but said "some issues" remain unresolved 
between the Kingdom and Saudi Arabia. 
  "Time will reveal it all and the day will come when the 
brothers will realise that we did not do them any wrong at all," 
the prime minister told foreign correspondents at the Prime 
Ministry. 
  Dr. al-Majali held the Jordanian media responsible for the 
failure of the reconciliation efforts among Arab states, adding 
that Jordan received some complaints from some Arab Gulf 
countries about reports carried by the country's unofficial 
media. 
  "The role of the press was not positive in improving 
relations," Dr. al-Majali said, expressing an opinion he has 
projected earlier. 
  Dr. al-Majali, who said the media "shoulders 95 per cent of 
the responsibility" for the tension in relations with the Gulf, 
said Jordan had told countries which complained that the media 
in Jordan are free and "we have never guided (them)," adding 
that the Press and Publication Law bans the publishing of news 
that harm friendly countries and legal cases have been launched 
against those who violated the law. 
  Pointing out that the government cannot control the 
unofficial press, Dr. al-Majali said, "the role played by the 
official media towards Arab relations is positive and there was 
nothing in them that could be interpreted as offensive to our 
brothers in the Arab countries." 
  Responding to a question on whether Egypt was trying to 
undermine Jordan's role in the region, Dr. al-Majali said that 
Egypt and Jordan had strong relations and the two countries look 
into means of strengthening them. 
  The prime minister said Jordan played a mediation role in 
the 
Yemeni conflict upon the request of its leaders who trust the 
wisdom of His Majesty King Husayn. But he said there are 
differences in Yemen that might have become personal which makes 
the implementation of the reconciliation agreement signed in 
Amman difficult. 
  The prime minister said: "We believe in the Iraqi people, 
their freedom and (the need) to lift the injustice inflicted 
upon them." 
  The Iraqi people, he said, "are free in their choice of its 
leadership and we do not impose our opinion on them because we 
do not allow ourselves to interfere in the affairs of others." 
  Asked about the reported involvement of an Arab country in 
the assassination of Jordanian diplomat Na'ib al-Ma'ayitah in 
Beirut in January, Dr. al-Majali said the results of the 
investigation conducted by the Lebanese authorities did not name 
any country behind the assassination. 
  The prime minister said the two suspects arrested in the 
case 
admitted that their organisation, Abu-Nidal Group, assassinated 
Mr. Ma'ayitah because it "was not happy with Jordan's policy." 
  It was "a big plot; too many people were involved," said Dr. 
al-Majali, adding that the assassins had planned to kill the 
Jordanian ambassador in Beirut.

  [Text] The Council of Ministers held a session under Prime 
Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali this morning. It listened 
to a report by the minister of state for foreign affairs on 
Jordan's participation in the meetings of the multilateral 
working group on water, which held its fifth meeting in Muscat 
in the Sultanate of Oman. 
  It is noteworthy that Jordan decided to reduce the number of 
its delegates participating in the meeting to only one, until an 
appropriate solution is found for the way ships heading for 
al-'Aqabah are searched. 
  At the end of the meetings, Jordan's delegate delivered a 
speech. He said he could not reject or support the decisions 
reached in the committee's meetings until he consulted with the 
Jordanian Government. This position postponed the meetings for 
a few hours because the committee's decisions are made 
unanimously. 
  In honor of the host state, the fraternal Sultanate of Oman, 
the Jordanian delegate decided to regard his speech as canceled, 
so acceptable decisions could be made unanimously. In a 
concluding speech, the meeting's head said he understood 
Jordan's position and stressed the desire of the committee's 
members to remove the reasons for the reduction in the Jordanian 
delegation, so it can resume its previous activity and efforts.

terrorism in the world, imposed restrictions on the movement of 
Jordanian nationals in France, and forced them to obtain exit 
permits before leaving France. In a statement to AKHIR KHABAR, 
Deputy Muhammad Abu-'Alim, who recently returned from an 
official visit to the French capital, said that he, as well as 
the Arab delegations participating in the Arab-European 
parliamentary dialogue, were surprised at the official French 
stand vis-a-vis Jordan. He added that they discussed the matter 
with the French officials, particularly since we in Jordan are 
not aware of this matter. 
  Abu-'Alim said: The Jordanian Embassy in Paris is aware of 
this. I personally met with Mr. Bouchar [name as published] who 
is currently the head of the Middle East Political Desk at the 
French Foreign Ministry, He added that the French official 
admitted that Jordan was mistakenly placed on the terrorism 
list. The French official said: The French Government will 
discuss the matter. 
  AKHIR KHABAR has also learned that the [Jordanian] 
Government 
is currently holding contacts with the French officials in this 
regard and that it expects the situation to be addressed before 
declaring the official French stand which is known to French 
political figures. 
  The French foreign minister visited Israel three weeks ago 
and refused the meet the Jordanian deputies who visited Paris.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Saddam's Palace Shelled"] </F>
  [Text] London, AL-HAYAH -- Reliable Iraqi opposition 
sources have confirmed to AL-HAYAH that at dawn on 15 April four 
60-mm mortar shells were fired in the direction of the 
Republican Palace, located in Baghdad's Karradat Maryam on the 
Tigris river. 
  They said that the shells were fired from a position 
opposite 
the palace somewhere in the Abu-Nuwwas Street, which runs 
parallel to the Tigris in the eastern Karradah quarter on the 
al-Rasafah side. Three shells fell on the palace and the fourth 
fell in the river. 
  Unified Iraqi National Congress [UINC] sources have told 
AL-HAYAH that "some members of the Iraqi National Assembly 
(parliament) and some Army officers have taken refuge in Irbil," 
which is under Kurdistan Front control. 
  A statement issued by the Supreme Assembly of the Islamic 
Revolution in Iraq [SAIRI] said that "the special security organ 
in Baghdad arrested Staff Major General 'Abd-al-Malik al-Juburi 
on a charge of covering up embezzlement at the al-Radwaniyah 
military industries plant." SAIRI sources said that al-Juburi, 
who was commander of the 10th Armored Division during the war 
with Iran, "was recently released after being sentenced to seven 
years in prison on suspicion of complicity in the coup attempt 
plotted by a number of officers from the al-Jubur tribe after 
the Gulf war." 
  Meanwhile Kurdish administration sources have told AL-HAYAH 
that Iran has amassed large forces from the 5th and 11th Corps 
of the Revolutionary Guard supported by tanks and artillery on 
the borders with Iraq, in the area opposite Banjwin to the east 
of al-Sulaymaniyah Governorate. They added that the Iraqi 
Kurdish villages of Nukan, Tuqla, Kurah Shir, and Bidlan [last 
four names as transliterated] were shelled again. Most 
inhabitants of these villages have had to leave before as a 
result of previous Iranian aggression. 
  On 24 April an Iranian force entered the village of Kani 
Khan 
in the Banjwin area after shelling it. The same sources 
described the situation on the Iraqi-Iranian border as tense.

<F P=106> [Interview with Sayyed Ahmad Gailani, leader of the National </F>
Islamic Front, by Salih Qallab in Islamabad; date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Qallab] You say that the 
current struggle between Rabbani and Hekmatyar is attributable 
to the fact that each party is seeking to monopolize power. Is 
that the reason, and are there no ideological and political 
dimensions to this conflict? 
  [Gailani] Actually the main reason for this war is the power 
struggle. The Hezb-e Eslami led by Hekmatyar says that it wants 
a democratic government based on direct free elections, and that 
it is opposed to the regime of President Borhanoddin Rabbani, 
because the latter is seeking to monopolize power for himself, 
his party, and allies by military force. 
  For our part, we wanted a democratic system based on free 
elections and the establishment of a democratic parliament whose 
task is to elect the head of state. But regrettably, the idea 
of referring to influential people, announced by Rabbani 
initially, began to be stripped of its content, hence illegal, 
and undemocratic practices began to take place. This is why we 
refused to recognize this reality or to participate in the shura 
council which was formed by unsound means. 
  What we are seeking is to hold elections under the 
supervision of the United Nations and the Islamic Conference 
Organization, in order to elect a legal council that really 
represents the Afghan people. [passage omitted] 
  [Qallab] Rabbani says he is prepared to hold a dialogue with 
Hekmatyar or any other faction but cannot hold a dialogue with 
Abdol Rashid Dostam and Babrak Karmal, who is now in Mazar-e 
Sharif, because they represent a communist front. What is your 
opinion? 
  [Gailani] We are against communism, and we have fought it. 
But there is a unanimous decision to accept General Abdol Rashid 
Dostam among mojahedin ranks and to consider him a mojahed, as 
he rebelled against the communist regime. It is wrong now to 
say that he is a communist and thus no dialogue cannot be held 
with him. 
  [Qallab] But Dostam is allied with Babrak Karmal and the 
other leaders of the communist regime. 
  [Gailani] That is what Rabbani says, but it is absolutely 
untrue. [passage omitted] 
  [Qallab] If Rabbani's term ends without achieving a solution 
acceptable to most parties, a vacuum will occur and the country 
will be plunged into chaos and destruction. Do you have any 
alternatives? 
  [Gailani] We want to hold general elections on the basis of 
which to form a new legislative council and new government 
before the end of Rabbani's term. 
  [Qallab] These are your aspirations, but the reality on the 
ground is different. There are numerous armies and states. 
  [Gailani] All these armies could be merged into one national 
army. 
  [Qallab] Do you not believe that a disagreement would emerge 
over the allocation of posts? 
  [Gailani] No, they would not disagree at all, especially if 
a neutral government is elected. I point out here that Rabbani 
has expressed willingness to comply if a neutral government is 
elected. [passage omitted] 
  [Qallab] Do you agree with the view that some Islamic and 
Arab states do not want an Islamic state in Afghanistan for fear 
that such a state could become a seat of world tension in the 
future? 
  [Gailani] No, I do not agree with that view. I say that we 
want a moderate government, willing to coexist with neighboring 
states and all world states. 
  [Qallab] But Rabbani, to whom you are opposed now, is the 
most moderate person, compared with Hekmatyar. 
  [Gailani] The two are from the same school; there is no 
difference between them at all. 
  [Qallab] The Arab region, especially Egypt and Algeria, has 
suffered from the "Afghan Arabs" phenomenon. Which factions 
support them? 
  [Gailani] There are "Afghan Arabs" and there are 
organizations offering them camps and support. There are also 
Arab states guiding them against other Arab states. But we as 
Afghans reject that and want a moderate government that 
cooperates with all. 
  [Qallab] We heard some people say that the solution in 
Afghanistan lies in the return of the monarchy and King Zahir 
Shah. What is your opinion? 
  [Gailani] I respect King Zahir Shah. But I want any 
decision to be made by the Afghan people, whether with regard to 
the return of the monarchy or anything else. [passage omitted]

change in its stand on the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty 
[NPT]. The parliamentary affairs minister, Mr. V.C. Shukla, 
told the Lok Sabha that India's policy is consistent that the 
treaty should be universal and nondiscriminatory. He was 
responding when several opposition leaders demanded that the 
government should make its position clear in view of the 
reported U.S. pressure for convening a regional conference on 
the issue. Raising the matter during zero hour, Mr. Chandrajit 
Yadav, Janata Dal, said the government should not agree to 
anything which will stop the research and development work for 
peaceful uses of nuclear energy.

  [Text] Cairo, 25 Apr (MENA)--Muhammad Dahlan, a member of 
the Palestinian delegation to the Palestinian-Israeli 
negotiations, has affirmed that the two sides have agreed on the 
phased return of all the Palestinian deportees who have left 
Gaza and the West Bank since 1967. That is a total of 1,068 
deportees. 
  In exclusive statements to MENA, Dahlan said that 105 
deportees have returned and that the others will return in 
groups, the number of which will be agreed with the Israeli side. 
  Dahlan pointed out that Israel deported 68 Palestinians 
because of the intifadah while others were deported for 
different reasons. He added that the release of 1,400 of 8,400 
Palestinians held in Israeli jails has not yet been agreed with 
the Israelis. He added that it has been agreed with the 
Israelis to release 2,500 prisoners two days after the 
Gaza-Jericho implementation agreement is signed. He also said 
that 1,000 detainees will be released after the Israelis 
complete their withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho and that 500 
will be released one month after the withdrawal is completed. He 
added that the release of 1,000 detainees will be discussed 
after the inauguration of negotiations on autonomy in West Bank. 
  The Palestinian negotiators are seeking the release of all 
Palestinians held in Israeli jails regardless of their political 
orientation. The purpose is to preserve Palestinian unity, 
because these prisoners represent every affiliation. The 
Israelis refuse to release Hamas members, particularly following 
the operations the movement launched recently against the 
Israelis.

<F P=106> [Report by 'Ali al-Salih: "Hamas Denies Secret Negotiation </F>
With Israel"] 
  [Text] London -- A senior official in the Palestinian 
Hamas movement has denied the existence of any secret contacts 
between his movement and Israel. He also denied that the 
initiative launched by Dr. Musa Abu-Marzuq, head of the 
movement's Political Bureau, indicates the existence of such 
contacts or any change in the movement's policy and strategy. 
  Abu-Hamdan, Hamas representative in Tehran, told AL-SHARQ 
AL-AWSAT that this information is untrue and designed to distort 
the movement's position. 
  Abu-Hamdan added that "the attempt to leak this false 
information is aimed at trying to provoke the negotiating 
Palestinian side into offering further concessions, especially 
as Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres stated after his 
recent meeting with Yasir 'Arafat that the agreement could be 
somewhat delayed." 
  As is known, contacts have been made in the past between 
Israel and Hamas officials held in Israeli jails, including 
Shaykh Ahmad Yasin, the movement's spiritual leader. On this 
question the Hamas representative in Tehran said that "past 
contacts had their own circumstances and were made with the 
detained brothers." He added that "Israel asked some detained 
brothers to convey messages to the movement's leadership abroad. 
Their reply was clear, namely that there could be no 
negotiations or contacts between jailer and prisoner. Hamas 
explained its position on these contacts at the time." 
  Asked whether the truce initiative to which Dr. Abu-Marzuq 
stressed his commitment means Hamas' recognition of Israel and a 
willingness to accept the principle of negotiating with the 
Hebrew state, especially as the initiative was announced in the 
wake of operations carried out by the 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam 
battalions inside the green strip in 'Afula and Hadera and 
Israel's moves to tighten the noose around the movement in both 
Jordan and other Arab and foreign states, Abu-Hamdan said that 
"the truce that Dr. Abu-Marzuq announced does not mean 
recognition of Israel's right to occupy or remain in any part of 
the Palestinian territories." 
  He went on: "Dr. Abu-Marzuq's proposal is very clear: It 
means accepting a truce in order to hold free elections and, if 
Hamas wins those elections, it means accepting its program, 
which rejects Israel's existence." 
  Abu-Hamdan added that "Hamas did not request the truce. What 
Dr. Abu-Marzuq said was that, if Israel wants to extricate 
itself from its dilemma and if it requests a truce, we will 
agree." 
  Asked whether Hamas should extricate its enemy from his 
dilemma -- if Israel is in fact suffering one -- Abu-Hamdan said 
that "we are not interested in extricating Israel from its 
dilemma. Israel tried to extricate itself from the dilemma 
following its failure to protect its security after our 
operations, which hurt it, by trying to turn the conflict with 
it into an inter-Arab conflict, but it failed." 
  Asked whether the new initiative is not an attempt by Hamas 
to escape pressures which face it in Jordan and those which it 
might face in other Arab and foreign countries, Abu-Hamdan said 
that "there is understanding in Hamas of Jordan's and Syria's 
circumstances, because any harm inflicted on their stability 
weakens the Palestinian cause. Thus we are interested in this 
question, and the statements made by the head of the Political 
Bureau indicate that." 
  Asked why he is not interested in the PLO's stability in 
the way that he is interested in the stability of these two 
states, which are also participating in the peace process, 
Abu-Hamdan said that "the PLO is abandoning the Palestinian 
people's cause as a whole and granting legitimacy to that 
abandonment by considering itself their representative. What I 
am interested in is for my issue not to be abandoned. The 
problem with the PLO is not personal; it revolves around the 
nature of the settlement and the abandonment of rights." 
  He added that "Hamas' position is against the settlement and 
only accepts negotiation if that negotiation is going to lead to 
the restoration of the Palestinian people's rights to their 
territory from the river to the sea. But it is unacceptable to 
negotiate over something unknown that might or might not be 
achieved. This is what the PLO is doing. In this context it is 
offering one concession after another." 
  On the possibility of a meeting between 'Arafat and the 
Hamas 
leadership, as reported recently, Abu-Hamdan said that "our 
position on a meeting with 'Arafat has been very clear since the 
signing of the Oslo agreement, namely that we will not meet with 
him unless he backtracks on the agreement and returns to a 
struggle program around which all Palestinian forces can rally 
for the sake of liberating the land and recovering all 
Palestinian rights." 
  On the agreement signed between Hamas and Fatah in the 
occupied territories yesterday, he said that "this agreement is 
a field agreement prompted by conditions. It is aimed at 
solving problems between the two sides and averting Palestinian 
infighting. That is the essence of the movement's strategy, 
which prohibits infighting."

<F P=106> [Speech by President Husni Mubarak on the 12th anniversary </F>
of the liberation of Sinai; place not given--live or recorded] 
  [Text] In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful. 
  Brother citizens: On this day in 1982, the great Egyptian 
people achieved what is regarded as one of the great historic 
events immortalized by time and thus etched forever in its 
annals, alive and forever in the people's conscience, and 
continue to spread their fruits and blessings everywhere until 
judgment day. 
  This date will always remain one of Egyptian nationalism and 
a symbol that embodies the people's ability to give endlessly 
and its determination to sacrifice all that is dear for the sake 
of our land and sovereignty and in defense of the homeland's 
supreme interests and its right to live in security and peace 
with other peoples and nations. This will continue to add to 
humanity's assets and contribute to the process of renaissance 
and progress. 
  This great achievement could not have come from a void nor 
have happened because of any historic coincidence. It was the 
logical and natural outcome of several antecedents and 
successive positive events that all came together to create this 
resounding victory and coordinated process that constituted a 
magnificent epic the like of which history rarely hands out. 
  The people understood the course it had to take and set out 
its supreme national interests with a clear scientific vision 
that did not confuse between reality and dreams or between the 
possible and the impossible. It then expressed the sincere 
intention to achieve these objectives in accordance with the 
right priorities and regardless of the sacrifices. The 
tumultuous masses competed in the national action process with 
full seriousness and commitment to the objective. Not one 
Egyptian who loved his country deviated from the noble national 
consensus. 
  With its unique sense of history and its shrewdness, the 
people realized that it had no life, present, or future without 
liberation of the land and honor and the retrieval of every 
single inch of the sacred land of a homeland blessed by Almighty 
God. It was incumbent on every Egyptian who cared deeply about 
his country and its honor to regard the objective of liberation 
as above all other considerations and to give it priority. No 
person, regardless of his status, can have dignity if his 
homeland does not hold its head high and has no dignity. 
  The people, who have a rich civilization, knew that the 
road to liberation was difficult and bitter and that it was not 
strewn with roses, rhetoric, or wishful thinking. The people 
knew that the road to liberation needed constant hard work, 
sweat, and tears in a solemn national procession in which wills 
were united, abilities merged, and differences eliminated. Thus 
it was certain that the march would continue to its triumphant 
goal. 
  The struggling people knew that liberation could not be 
achieved on one, but on several twisting paths in which decisive 
military action would mingle with active political action and 
where every citizen had a role to play, because the liberation 
battalions were not only confined to fighting soldiers, but 
included other builders of glory and civilization in every 
field. The real touchstone for testing a citizen's ability to 
participate is his readiness to make efforts and sacrifices 
within the framework of one national structure free from 
selfishness and personal interests at the expense of the 
interests of the public. 
  Since the first spark of the liberation war in those blessed 
hours of October 1973, the people realized the goal of the war. 
They realized that it was not an end in and of itself, but a 
means to achieve a fair and lasting peace based on the 
provisions of law and legitimacy and striking a balance between 
rights and various interests. Thus Egypt's noble people met the 
challenge of peace with the same resolve and determination with 
which they fought the glorious October war. They were not 
frightened by claims about the adversary's superiority and its 
great abilities and resources. They entertained no doubts about 
their ability to meet the challenge. It was inevitable that 
they would triumph and liberate their land and their will, the 
region would witness the birth of a new age in which broad 
horizons of peace would be opened, there would be coexistence, 
and violence and suffering, bloodshed, and the exhaustion of 
resources would end. 
  We place this great achievement, which the Egyptian people 
attained through war, peace, and self-confidence, at the service 
of peace and security for all the people of the region. We will 
use this achievement to serve the fateful pan-Arab issues, 
particularly the principle of total withdrawal in return for 
comprehensive peace, to guarantee balanced security for all the 
parties, and enhance cooperation based on acceptance and free 
choice. No one should be harmed and no one coerced into 
anything. There should be fruitful cooperation for the common 
good. 
  We are following with great attention and anticipation the 
ongoing talks on the various tracks. We are confident that the 
people's will will prevail and triumph. We are also confident 
that the differences that surface occasionally are temporary, 
not an obstacle to the march of history. All the parties 
realize that there is no alternative to a comprehensive and just 
peace. No one can stop the current for change or tie the region 
up in the shackles of subversion and stalemate. The world is 
witnessing exhilarating developments and an unprecedented, great 
technical revolution. 
  All our achievements and all the horizons that peace will 
open up for other peoples with whom we share a common interest 
and fate inspire us to double national work at home with firm 
resolve and renewable energy, spreading glory, cultivating hope, 
making progress, and opening great vistas for innovative and 
creative work for every Egyptian. 
  The current comprehensive reconstruction and development in 
the blessed land of Sinai is a good example and a true mirror of 
the future throughout Egypt. It is a future full of dreams and 
hopes, replete with good fortune and bounty for every hand that 
lays a stone in the great building of renaissance, for every arm 
that safeguards the homeland, and for every eye that guards the 
country and the people's security. 
  May God grant success to us all. May He protect our march. 
He is the best protector. May God's peace and mercy be with 
you.

  [Text] Cairo, 26 Apr (MENA)--Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq 
al-Shar' has stated that his country's position on peace is 
clear: implementation of the Security Council resolutions, full 
Israeli withdrawal from the Golan, and a just and comprehensive 
peace in the region. 
  Al-Shar' told AL-'ALAM AL-YAWM that Syria will not concede 
one inch of Golan territory and will accept no security 
arrangements at the expense of Syria's national security or 
pan-Arab security. 
  He said Syria will determine its position on resuming the 
peace negotiations in Washington in light of the results of U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher's upcoming tour of the 
region. 
  The Syrian foreign minister called on the United States to 
shoulder its responsibility as a sponsor of the peace process. 
He urged the United States to make the right decision to 
safeguard the peace process and preserve U.S. credibility in the 
region. 
  Al-Shar' warned that if Israel fails to reconsider its 
position toward the peace process as a whole and to make the 
right decision to put this process back on track in accordance 
with the Madrid formula, then things will keep getting worse.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz by </F>
correspondents Zuhayr Hawari and 'Imad Marmil; place and date 
not given] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [AL-SAFIR] Lebanon has not 
participated in the multilateral peace negotiations during which 
fundamental issues are being discussed that affect it, such as 
refugees and water. Are you still insisting on not 
participating in the talks? 
  [Buwayz] Not only are we still insisting but we are also 
more 
convinced than ever before that it was premature to embark on 
multilateral negotiations before the bilateral negotiations made 
tangible, essential, and decisive progress. We are insisting 
that participation in them is a mistake. Lebanon was the first 
country that warned against joining the multilateral talks. I 
remember that I made this warning when I chaired the Arab League 
Council meeting in Cairo in 1990 before the Madrid conference. 
I said then that we are reading in the press and hearing from 
some sources that multilateral talks are being proposed on the 
issues of water, armaments, the environment, transportation, 
communications, etc. I also said: While firmly convinced that 
these are essential issues, that we cannot be forgiven if we 
ignore them, that these issues have to be discussed when peace 
comes, and that an agreement must be reached on them because 
they are common problems, we cannot embark on discussing these 
issues if they are proposed to us--and at that time they were 
not officially proposed--before we are certain that peace is 
coming and on the details of this peace. 
  Why? First, because I regarded the multilateral talks as 
complementary to peace and to the peace decision. How can we 
complement a decision that has not been made yet? 
  Second, I said that these multilateral talks are like 
someone 
who tries to furnish a house before it is built or the shape is 
known. How can we choose the furniture for a house that has not 
been built? 
  This is why I say that the multilateral talks involve 
complementary issues that presuppose the existence of peace. We 
must be certain that the peace decision has become inevitable 
and that its aspects and shape have become clear before we enter 
into multilateral talks. We have no reservations about the 
issues being discussed at the multilateral talks but about the 
mechanism. We even welcome international participation in them. 
But we have reservations about their timing. We say it 
openly--and time has proved that we are right--that the 
multilateral talks have not made progress because the bilateral 
ones have not made progress. Those who have been tempted to 
take part in these talks admitted to us later that they were 
tempted by the promises made from outside the multilateral talks 
framework. Some Arab countries have admitted to me later that 
they joined the multilateral talks not out of conviction but on 
the basis of foreign promises to improve their relations with a 
certain country. Where have the multilateral talks gone now? 
  The question is how could the negotiator sitting at the 
multilateral talks table make progress when he knows that the 
principal negotiator involved in the bilateral talks is stalled? 
  [AL-SAFIR] It appears that the dead end is a dual one? 
  [Buwayz] In addition to what I have already said, the most 
important consideration for us is that the multilateral talks 
must be in the interest of everyone in the region. For Israel 
it is of an additional interest. How can we pay a price to 
Israel when the latter has not yet agreed to implement the 
Madrid agreement principles and the international resolutions 
that were supposedly used by the Madrid conference as a basis 
for shaping the implementation mechanism? 
  [AL-SAFIR] Israel alone is not responsible for the dead end 
in the talks but is jointly responsible for it with the United 
States, which is managing the negotiating process? 
  [Buwayz] Like in criminal law where there is a positive and 
a 
negative responsibility, I believe that Israel is responsible 
for not abiding by the Madrid agreement and for not seeking to 
implement the Madrid decisions. It is prevaricating on 
implementing what was decided on in that conference. It tried 
to prevaricate when it sought to gain six additional months 
during the U.S. elections and when it procrastinated with all 
the Arab countries as it was working to push the Palestinian 
negotiator into certain positions while refusing to make 
progress on the other tracks. Between the policy of isolating 
the other parties, the policy of the Israeli Governments' 
internal weakness, and the policy of wagering on the change in 
U.S. Administrations, Israel has squandered much of the years 
since the peace process started. I say that this is a positive 
responsibility, that is, it practiced this responsibility 
intentionally and negatively. That was a positive 
responsibility done to serve a negative objective. 
  Regarding U.S. responsibility as cosponsor of the 
conference, we did not enter the peace process believing Israel 
really wanted peace and would quickly embrace it. We did not 
enter an ambiguous peace process either; we entered a process 
with well-defined features, goals, mechanisms, and roles. The 
goals were clear and frank. They were represented by the 
principle of land for peace, the principle of the implementation 
of UN resolutions, and the principle of the restoration of lands 
and the Palestinian people's political rights. A major reason 
for our participation in the conference was our belief that the 
U.S. role would be an influential one. We believed that Israel 
on its own would not move toward peace. We took into 
consideration the U.S. and Soviet assurances. The Soviet Union 
still existed then. We particularly depended on the U.S. 
assurances, believing that the U.S. commitment to this 
conference would result in pressure being applied on Israel to 
move in the required direction. 
  I cannot say that the successive U.S. Administrations have 
fully played this role. I cannot say that the United States has 
played this role from the beginning, that is, the role of an 
honest broker or a driving force. I believe that the United 
States has so far sufficed itself with playing a role of a 
logistical nature or that of a technical broker. It has not 
undertaken dynamic and strong mediation as envisaged in the 
peace process. Hence, its responsibility is negative, the 
responsibility of someone who has not fulfilled his obligations. 
  [AL-SAFIR] Israel claims that the Lebanese delegation is not 
negotiating with it. At the same time, Rabin stresses that 
there is no full withdrawal from the Golan in return for a full 
peace. How can this vicious circle be broken? 
  [Buwayz] This question consists of two parts. Regarding the 
negotiations with the Lebanese delegation, what do they want the 
Lebanese delegation to negotiate? There are certain Lebanese 
principles. Lebanon clearly says that Israel must implement 
Resolution 425, which calls for Israel's withdrawal to the 
internationally recognized border, and for the Lebanese state to 
establish its authority. In return, Lebanon pledges to assume 
its responsibility as a state and to ensure that security and 
stability prevails in the area that the state will receive. We 
tell the Israelis that this resolution is independent of the 
Middle East conflict. Let them accept the principle of its 
implementation and we will then be ready to form a joint 
military commission that will adopt the executive steps, 
programs, and timetables. Afterwards, in solidarity with the 
other Arab states, we will move forward with the peace talks 
until a comprehensive and final peace is achieved. 
  We have proposed progress in two phases. The first phase is 
purely Lebanese and is through the implementation of Resolution 
425. The second phase is on the regional level. What did Israel 
do? It linked the Lebanese dossier with the other dossiers, 
especially the Syrian dossier. First, as a precondition Israel 
demanded that the Lebanese state control the resistance when it 
knew that this was impossible. Israel knows that the resistance 
is the result and not the cause of the occupation. The result 
cannot disappear as long as the cause remains. Israel knows 
that the Lebanese Government cannot drop the principle of 
resistance as long as it does not have definite assurances that 
its territory will be restored. Therefore, Israel is imposing 
impossible conditions while we have pledged to establish peace 
and security when Israel withdraws from the south. Second, 
Israel links its withdrawal to the signing of a comprehensive 
peace treaty under which all Arab rights are supposed to be 
restored. Hence, it is Israel that is linking the problem of 
the south with the regional problem. This is not the first 
time it has done this. In the 17 May [1983] agreement, which 
was signed after one and a half years of talks, Israel linked 
the outcome of the talks with Syria's commitment to the security 
of the south. Therefore, if Israel is accusing us of linking our 
dossier to Syria's dossier, it is doing that itself. If it is 
accusing us of linking it to the regional problem, it is also 
doing that itself. 
  [AL-SAFIR] In the beginning you stated that Israel is 
seeking 
to deal unilaterally with the Arab states. Now you are saying 
that it is linking the Lebanese dossier with the Syrian dossier. 
  [Buwayz] In the Lebanese dossier, instead of accepting the 
spirit of Resolution 425 and acknowledging the need for the 
implementation of this resolution in return for security and 
stability and then moving on to the regional level, Israel is 
linking this subject with the regional topic. One of Israel's 
conditions for withdrawal is the signing of a comprehensive 
peace agreement. 
  [AL-SAFIR] The Madrid conference was launched on the basis 
of land for peace. The Lebanese translation of the conference 
is the implementation of Resolution 425 in return for what? 
  [Buwayz] Well, we have told Israel to please declare its 
readiness for complete withdrawal. This would justify forming a 
military committee, which would work out a timetable for a 
withdrawal and then we could proceed together toward a 
comprehensive peace. However, Israel is proposing forming a 
military committee with an as yet unidentified purpose. We have 
asked Israel about the purpose of a military committee. If the 
purpose is to maintain the prevailing truce, then we say that 
there is a truce committee, so why this new committee? If the 
goal is to maintain the current situation, we say that there are 
UN forces doing that. Let us do their job. However, if the 
purpose is really to reach a full withdrawal from south Lebanon, 
then let Israel declare this and there would be justification 
for forming a military committee. 
  [AL-SAFIR] We are currently in a dormant stage that may last 
for a long time. Can Lebanon tolerate such a situation? 
  [Buwayz] For us to say whether this situation will continue 
or not we have to pinpoint responsibility for it. It was very 
obvious in the latest round of talks, the 12th round, that 
Israel deliberately refused to make any progress for three 
reasons: 
  1. It wanted to frustrate all results of the Geneva summit 
between Presidents al-Asad and Clinton to negate any possibility 
of an Arab-U.S. agreement that might be imposed on it and to 
show that nothing positive can be done without taking the 
Israeli factor into account. 
  2. It believed that it could not make progress on a track as 
long as the Palestinian track had not run its course, so Israel 
deliberately prevaricated to foil this round in the hopes of 
reaching certain agreements with the Palestinians. 
  3. It used the pretext that the government's internal 
situation at the time did not allow it to make certain decisions 
and that it had to secure certain domestic alliances before 
making new decisions. Israel used these three reasons directly 
or tacitly to prevent any progress. So, who is responsible for 
the stagnation in the negotiations? 
  [AL-SAFIR] There is no doubt that Israel is responsible, but 
the Arab party has no other option than negotiations. 
  [Buwayz] I would not say that the Arab side has no other 
options, but that the Arab side is trying to give the peace 
process every chance. I would also like to maintain that the 
Arab side refuses to bear the responsibility for the failure of 
the peace process, should it fail. Therefore, despite the 
difficult negotiations and Israeli stalling, the Arab side wants 
to ensure all chances for these negotiations to succeed. Should 
the negotiations fail, the Arab side does not want to look 
negative before the world. If a party does not mind looking 
negative and bearing the moral and political responsibility for 
the peace process, let it be Israel. [passage omitted] 
  [AL-SAFIR] One of the issues that shows the extent of Arab 
solidarity is that of the Palestinian refugees in the Arab 
countries, which is being discussed at the multilateral talks. 
For example, Jordan, which you said will not sign, said that it 
will resort to international law and not Resolution 194, which 
provides for the return of refugees to their land. What about 
the Palestinian refugees in Lebanon and how will you deal with 
this issue? 
  [Buwayz] When Jordan chooses a certain legal or any other 
framework to deal with the Palestinian refugee problem, it means 
the problem of Palestinians on its territory and not elsewhere. 
Regarding Lebanon, we believe that there can be no possible 
solution to the Palestinian refugee problem in the context of 
the multilateral negotiations outside the bilateral talks. 
Regarding the Palestinian presence in Lebanon, we are 
proceeding from the points outlined in our Constitution: We 
reject settling the Palestinians in Lebanon in any way, and all 
Lebanese concur on this issue. We believe that there is no one 
radical solution to the Palestinian refugee problem. Anyone who 
believes that there is one prompt solution is mistaken. I 
believe that solving this problem must follow four lines: 
First, recognizing the right to return and consolidating the UN 
resolution on the right to return. What do I mean by the right 
to return? Of course, Israel will not agree to the Palestinians 
returning to the territories that will remain under its 
authority. But what about Israel's stance on the return of 
Palestinians to the territories that will be regained--Gaza and 
Jericho--and to more areas that may be regained later? The 
right to return to the Palestinian territories that will be 
under Palestinian authority in the future must be entrenched, 
particularly those Palestinians who have connections there such 
as material, property, or relatives. I believe that if we work 
seriously to emphasize this principle, some 20 percent of 
Palestinian citizens in Lebanon could be assimilated there. 
  Second is the principle of the family reunion return. The 
world has the humanitarian responsibility to allow those who 
have family members anywhere in the world--whether it is Egypt, 
Syria, Jordan, the Gulf, Palestine, Canada, or the United 
States--to join their families, that is, family reunion by 
having the minority join the majority. If we can shape this 
idea and adopt it, it can solve 25 percent of the problems of 
the Palestinians in Lebanon. 
  Third, I believe that there are countries with many 
immigrants. There are countries that are large and rich but 
suffer from the weakness of their human resources and low 
populations. These countries have let in a number of 
expatriates. They include Australia, Canada, and possibly the 
United States. I believe that these countries that continue to 
accept a large number of immigrants should give priority to the 
Palestinians who want to settle in them. 
  And last, I believe that the Middle East region is also a 
very extensive area. Some of its areas have huge resources and 
need manpower and certain human resources. I also believe that 
some of these countries have the moral, political, and ethnic 
responsibility of tackling even the problem of the Palestinian 
refugees. How can we continue to import Asian laborers when we 
have Palestinians who cannot enter and work in these countries? 
  Hence, I believe that if we deal seriously with these four 
solutions, they can solve a major and radical part of Lebanon's 
problem with the Palestinian presence. While this presence 
might be normal, acceptable, and "easily digested" in other 
countries of immense size and huge population and where the 
absorption of 400,000 or 500,000 Palestinians will not affect 
them, this presence in Lebanon will have deep and fundamental 
consequences. First, Lebanon's geographic size is very small 
compared to its population. Second, the Lebanese area that can 
be inhabited or is fit for investment--if we take away the high 
mountains and deep valleys-- remains very small. Third, 
everyone knows that the Lebanese structure is a very complicated 
one and any imbalance in it will have political social, 
economic, and security consequences. Fourth, we believe that 
the conditions of the Palestinians in the refugee camps in 
Lebanon radically differs from those in a number of countries 
where they have settled down, are working, and are enjoying 
health care and education. It is impossible to ask Lebanon at 
present, when it has emerged from war and is incapable of 
satisfying the social needs of the Lebanese, to take care of the 
Palestinians' needs, too. 
  [AL-SAFIR] But the state has banned the rebuilding of the 
camps from the United Nations Relief and Works Agency funds and 
not from Lebanon's funds. What exactly is going on? What is 
being planned for the camps? 
  [Buwayz] If this were allowed, you would have said that 
resettlement is already taking place. What is required here to 
keep the Palestinian issue alive and keep it the responsibility 
of everyone or to absorb and resolve it here in Lebanon? I 
believe it is impossible to reconcile these two notions. If you 
want to allow the Palestinians to build wherever they want and 
if you want them to be included in social security and to enjoy 
all the rights of Lebanese citizens, then I believe that you are 
moving, intentionally or unintentionally, toward bringing 
resettlement about. 
  [AL-SAFIR] Mr. Minister, it is clear that Israel will not 
allow the Palestinians back and is raising the issue of the Jews 
in Arab countries. 
  [Buwayz] I don't think that the problem lies with Israel 
only. I don't believe that there are Palestinians who want to 
live in the State of Israel. This issue is not under discussion 
in the first place. We are talking about the Palestinians' 
return to the territories that will be retrieved and placed 
under Palestinian authority. 
  [AL-SAFIR] Your words imply that Lebanon does not want to 
keep the Palestinians already here and will work to reduce their 
numbers because, as you just said, it cannot tolerate such a 
number. 
  [Buwayz] I am not saying that Lebanon cannot tolerate that 
number now because this implies that it could tolerate that in 
the past. I am saying that Lebanon has never tolerated such a 
number and cannot tolerate it. We do not accept or allow a 
solution to the Palestinian problem to be made at the expense of 
creating a Lebanese problem. We also do not want or accept the 
exchange of the Palestinian identity for another one, including 
a Lebanese identity. 
  [AL-SAFIR] But Lebanon has shouldered responsibility for 
some of the Palestinians and must continue to do so at least 
temporarily. 
  [Buwayz] Lebanon and other Arab countries have temporarily 
received a number of Palestinians until solutions are found. 
The solutions have not been forthcoming. Does this mean that 
Lebanon must shoulder the responsibility alone for these 
Palestinians? This is an international responsibility resulting 
from the creation of Israel at the expense of the Palestinians, 
and an Arab responsibility from the perspective of blood and 
brotherly ties. Accordingly, this subject concerns the host 
states. 
  [AL-SAFIR] In any case, we retain our viewpoint regarding 
what you are saying. 
  [Buwayz] What is the problem? 
  [AL-SAFIR] Matters might not be explained only on the basis 
of the options you have spoken about. There is a problem. 
  [Buwayz] You have convinced me that there is a problem. Has 
anybody said there is no problem? If this problem did not 
exist, you would not have asked me all these questions. I agree 
with you that there is a problem. You have asked me how it can 
be solved. I have given you the realistic and possible 
solutions for this problem. 
  [AL-SAFIR] Are the ideas that you have aired personal or 
part of arrangements being prepared for the region? 
  [Buwayz] They are a kind of evaluation of the approaches 
that we can adopt. We have discussed this topic with 
international and other quarters. These quarters are now 
discussing this topic. 
  [AL-SAFIR] Do these ideas apply to Syria, Jordan, and Egypt? 
  [Buwayz] No, this solution applies to Lebanon. Perhaps the 
Palestinians in Egypt are not facing a problem. Egypt, with a 
population of 60 million, might not have a problem in 
assimilating 500,000 Palestinians. Syria does not have a 
problem with large refugee camps. The Palestinians in Syria 
benefit from free medicine and education. They enjoy almost all 
rights, except political rights. 
  I have explained Lebanon's special character. It is a small 
country with a sensitive social structure. 
  [AL-SAFIR] If the Palestinians refuse to leave Lebanon, will 
they be forced to leave? 
  [Buwayz] The Palestinians have so far proved their adherence 
to their identity. I believe a large number of Palestinians 
want either to return to Palestine or to go to another country 
where the conditions for living and working are better. I 
believe the opening of these options does not conflict with the 
Palestinian people's rights to return, to family reunions, or to 
choose the country in which they want to live. 
  [AL-SAFIR] Is there a possibility of discussing other 
options 
for the Palestinians in Lebanon that will provide better 
conditions for them? 
  [Buwayz] Under no circumstances will Lebanon accept the 
naturalization of the Palestinians. 
  [AL-SAFIR] We did not mean naturalization. 
  [Buwayz] Lebanon may accept gradual solutions. The 
residence of some Palestinians might be organized in accordance 
with solutions that will require some time. However, there is a 
firm national principle. Lebanon cannot assimilate the 
Palestinians and melt them into the Lebanese identity.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin by Muhammad </F>
Wahbi -- place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Wahbi] Reports from Washington say that Dennis 
Ross, U.S. coordinator of the peace process, and Martin Indyk, 
President Clinton's assistant for Middle East affairs, will 
arrive in the region to give impetus to the peace process, 
particularly the Syrian-Israeli track. You have said that 
President al-Asad has not done even one percent of what he 
should be doing toward the peace process, but the Syrians say 
that he has done much more than that. He has stated that he is 
prepared to fully recognize Israel in exchange for full 
withdrawal from the Golan. He also has gone a long way by 
explaining to President Clinton what he means by a comprehensive 
peace with Israel. Why don't you for your part travel the same 
distance that President al-Asad has travelled by specifying what 
you mean by withdrawal from the Golan? 
  [Rabin] First of all, I am not aware that the two U.S. 
officials you have named will come to the region. As far as I 
know, since it has been decided to resume the talks in 
Washington at the end of April, U.S. Secretary of State 
Christopher and the U.S. peace team will visit all the countries 
participating in the peace process to get the process going. 
This is all I can say in this regard. I am going to Moscow for 
four days next month and when I come back, Christopher will be 
in the region. He will visit Israel the week after next. In 
the meantime, we are continuing the negotiations with the 
Palestinians, primarily in Cairo. We are also negotiating with 
them on economic issues in Paris. President Mubarak and the 
Egyptian Government are hosting the negotiations in Cairo. I 
believe that President Mubarak has made a great and positive 
contribution toward continuing this process and eliminating the 
obstacles facing it. As regards the other parties, undoubtedly 
the position of Syria is of major importance to the peace 
process. I have previously stated, and I still believe, that 
Israel is a democratic state. Its people must be convinced, now 
that we have entered the peace process, that we must achieve 
peace with all parties in the region. Naturally, no one could 
do what President al-Sadat did in terms of making a breakthrough 
in the Arab-Israeli conflict. There is no doubt that President 
Mubarak is developing and backing the peace resulting from this 
breakthrough. As for Syria, I refer to what the newspaper 
TISHRIN, the official paper in Syria, published two days ago. 
It severely criticized Oman for hosting an Israeli delegation 
to talk about water issues. If such an attitude shows a 
readiness for peace on the part of Syria, then I don't know what 
opposition to peace would be like. Also, do not forget that in 
the joint news conference between Clinton and al-Asad following 
their talks, in which you said the Syrian president explained 
his definition of full peace, none of the Israeli papers were 
invited to the conference. Israeli journalists were not allowed 
to ask any questions. In addition, Syria is hosting antipeace 
organizations. It allows the Ahmad Jibril-led organization and 
others to attack the PLO for signing the Declaration of 
Principles with Israel and the Cairo Agreement and at the same 
time urges the Palestinians to undermine the peace process. More 
serious than this is that Syria provides all facilities to all 
types of attacks on Israel, whether from Lebanon or other 
places. All this does not prove that Syria has made a strategic 
decision to make peace with Israel. 
  I also do not believe in the possibility of achieving peace 
with Syria without secret meetings. We all remember that a 
secret meeting took place between Major General Hasan al-Tuhami 
[an aide of late Egyptian President al-Sadat] and Moshe Dayan in 
Morocco in 1977. We also remember that we were engaged with the 
PLO in secret talks in Oslo over six months, after which a 
Declaration of Principles was reached with the PLO. 
  Our government was the first Israeli Government to accept 
Resolution 242 as a basis for peace with Syria, which includes 
agreement to withdraw from the Golan as I have announced many 
times before, and this prompted the Israelis to attack me. 
  However, the geographical dimension of the withdrawal cannot 
be determined until after Israel knows the full meaning of the 
Syrians' term full peace. President al-Asad may have explained 
what that meant to President Clinton as you have indicated, but 
I have no knowledge that Syria's delegate to the Washington 
peace talks has explained this to his Israeli counterpart at the 
talks. So I cannot understand the meaning of a full peace as 
envisaged by the Syrians. Besides, the problems goes beyond the 
mere linking of peace and withdrawal and we have to know the 
meaning of peace, the extent of withdrawal, and the security 
phases that this withdrawal will pass through. 
  Let me remind you that the Camp David Accord was reached 
after one-year-long talks, from the time President al-Sadat 
visited Jerusalem in November 1977 to September 1978, and 
another six months were needed to reach a peace treaty in March 
1979. Six months later we withdrew to the Ra's 
Muhammad-al-'Arish Line and then began the normalization between 
the two countries by exchanging embassies and we completed the 
withdrawal beyond the border as was agreed upon in April 1982. 
  In the one-year period between President al-Sadat's visit to 
Jerusalem and the signing of the Camp David Accord, the Israeli 
prime minister was invited to Ismailia and the Mena House 
Conference was held. We also held talks at the highest level 
before the Camp David Accord, 13 days after Egyptian, Israeli, 
and U.S. leaders met behind the walls of Camp David, which was 
isolated from the rest of the world. So far, nothing of this 
kind or similar to it has happened between us and Syria. 
  [Wahbi] I have spoken with some Syrians about your demand 
for 
secret talks with Syria, but they told me that the Palestinians' 
experience in the secret talks with you does not really 
encourage them to repeat the same experiment with you. 
  [Rabin] Why? 
  [Wahbi] Because of the many difficulties the Palestinians 
are 
encountering right now, particularly since some Palestinian 
leaders believe that the PLO was cheated in the Oslo agreement. 
The talks leading to that agreement were held in secret and no 
third party, like the Americans, was represented in them. 
  [Rabin] The difficulties existing now are due to the fact 
that the Declaration of Principles between Israel and the PLO 
tackled much more complex matters than those that might 
complicate matters between Israel and any other Arab state. An 
agreement with any Arab state would mean defining peace, 
dividing borders, withdrawal stages, and the interrelation 
between a phased withdrawal and the normalization process. When 
it comes to Palestinians, we are trying to attain a certain goal 
in the peace process in its entirety. That goal is how to 
establish peaceful coexistence between two geographically 
overlapping entities. This creates much cause for strife on a 
daily basis. Many other details will need to be tackled if you 
want to guarantee success for peaceful coexistence between these 
two overlapping entities. 
  Moreover, there are people among both Palestinians and 
Israelis who oppose peace and want to ruin it. Among the 
Palestinians, extremist groups like "Hamas" and al-Jihad 
Organization practice terrorism, although they know very well 
that the Israeli people accept a political solution. But most 
of these Israelis ask: If this solution does not bring peace to 
us in our daily life, what kind of peace do you seek through the 
current peace process? The operations that "Hamas" and al-Jihad 
are carrying out create a vicious circle of violence between the 
two sides. This makes an agreement with the Palestinians much 
more difficult than with any Arab state. 
  [Wahbi] Egypt used to say to our Arab brothers that Israel 
can be very difficult and might insist on the smallest details 
in negotiations, but it implements any agreement it signs to 
the letter. I have to tell you that many of us have difficulty 
in repeating what we used to say to Arabs about the Israelis. 
  [Rabin] Why? Why? 
  [Wahbi] Since you say that agreed dates for implementing the 
Declaration of Principles are not sacred, what prevents you from 
announcing later on that any of the Declaration's words is not 
sacred? 
  [Rabin] I will only give you an example to show you that 
there is no justification whatsoever for saying that. We did 
not delay for a single day any previously agreed date for 
negotiations with the Palestinians. They delayed negotiations 
with us for a month. The opponents of peace in Israel asked me 
why I did not suspend negotiations with the Palestinians after 
the killing of Israelis in the "Afula and Hadera" incidents. I 
told them that if we did that in reaction to those who killed 
the Israelis with the goal of ruining the peace process we would 
be giving the perpetrators the best reward for their actions. 
  We did not delay negotiations for a single day. The 
Palestinians have to realize that they cannot say that dates are 
sacred. They said that they were delaying talks for a month 
because of a certain horrid incident to achieve what was agreed 
upon and to show commitment to the dates specified in the 
Declaration of Principles. However, I say that if both sides are 
prepared to reach middle solutions, which they have already done 
several times, we will implement the agreement on putting the 
Declaration of Principles into effect within two or three weeks 
at the most after signing it. 
  [Wahbi] It is also being said that if Rabin is causing all 
these difficulties while negotiating about the implementation of 
an agreement that is not related to the questions of 
sovereignty, the settlements, and Jerusalem, which have been 
postponed until negotiations on the final status of the occupied 
territories start, then what kind of difficulties could he cause 
when the time comes to discuss these topics at the final stage 
of the negotiations? 
  [Rabin] Why are these suspicions raised? The Palestinians 
and Israelis have agreed that their agreement would not be the 
same as Israel's agreement with the other Arab states. First of 
all, the Palestinians do not represent a country, but an 
organization. Second, it was clear to them and to us that when 
the facts change and when the Palestinians are able to run every 
aspect of their life, cities, villages and the enormous 
responsibilities that this entails, the more difficult issues 
can then be handled. This is because they would then be in a 
better position to handle such issues. Also, the atmosphere 
then would be more suitable because bridges of confidence 
between the two peoples will have been built, or at least the 
mutual hatred and suspicions will have eased. 
  [Wahbi] It is known that the self-rule idea goes back to the 
Likud and to [Zionist leader] Jabotinsky. The Labor Party has 
always talked about regional solutions that involve exchanging 
land for peace. Why, then, this exaggerated insistence by the 
Labor Party on the terms of the self-rule? 
  [Rabin] First of all, the Palestinians do not like to use 
the term self-rule because it appeared in the Camp David Accord. 
They prefer to use the abbreviation PISGA, which stands for 
Palestinian Interim Self-Government Authority. For our part, we 
have decided not to get into an argument with them over names. 
Thus, the term self-rule was mentioned in the letter of 
invitation to the Madrid Conference on this basis. For me, I 
believe that there are two stages: a transitional stage for 
building bridges of confidence and changing some realities, then 
comes the stage in which the final solution will be handled and 
in which we will be ready for regional solutions. We have 
pointed out that we do not want to assume responsibility for 
most of the Palestinians in the territories, but this does not 
mean that we will be prepared to withdraw to the pre-1967 lines. 
  [Wahbi] It is said that by creating obstacles to the 
implementation of the Declaration of Principles, Rabin is 
damaging the credibility of the moderate Arab forces, 
particularly Yasir 'Arafat's position. It is also said that if 
Rabin continues to create such obstacles, this will cause chaos 
in the occupied territories and might cause problems for Israel 
itself. What is your comment? 
  [Rabin] I am not creating any problems, nor am I delaying 
the 
implementation of any agreement. If you read the Declaration of 
Principles you will be certain that agreement has to be reached 
through negotiations on each phase stipulated in the Declaration. 
  We have not postponed the negotiations and are ready to 
pursue the efforts to reach an agreement that will realize the 
goals of the transitional phase, overwhelm the opposition from 
some forces on both sides, achieve security for the Israelis, 
and grant the Palestinian council the authority to run the 
Palestinians' affairs. 
  [Wahbi] I believe you have promised to face the problem of 
the settlements in the future. The question now is how can you 
deal with this difficult problem with all the trouble it entails 
if you are currently refusing to evacuate about 20-30 settlers 
from (Notetrim) settlement and also refuse to evacuate a handful 
of settlers from Hebron even after the al-Ibrahimi Mosque 
massacre? 
  [Rabin] Because the agreement is very clear. It stipulates 
that all settlements will remain during the transitional phase 
and the PLO has signed that agreement. We will turn to the 
settlements when we negotiate a final solution. I expect the 
Palestinians to honor their commitments as they expect me to 
honor mine. 
  [Wahbi] About two weeks ago Israeli television showed a 
documentary in which the camera proved that the settlers, at 
least in some case, issue orders to the Israel army instead of 
the army issuing orders to them. How true is this? 
  [Rabin] I have not seen this program, although I heard about 
it. In any case, that situation does not exist and for our part 
we will prevent that from happening. We have issued additional 
orders to make sure that such an impression is not made in 
future, because the army is responsible for the security of both 
the Palestinians and Israelis and that is its role. 
  [Wahbi] It is also being said that you are using the talks 
with the Palestinians to pressure the Syrians and vice versa. 
Why don't you negotiate with everybody at the same time and with 
the same zeal? 
  [Rabin] We have not suspended the Washington talks, the 
Syrians decided to suspend them, then the other parties followed 
suit. We are not engaged in any "game" at the expense of other 
parties. We deal with every Arab party on the basis of the 
chances of success that each issue presents. We thought we were 
close to reaching an agreement with Jordan, but unfortunately 
our efforts have not brought results. For our part, we have no 
regional problems with Jordan basically. We have absolutely no 
regional problems with Lebanon, but there are security problems 
because the Lebanese Government does not enjoy sovereignty over 
all its territories. We are not after a single inch of Lebanese 
territory. There are international borders between us and 
Lebanon. All we want is for the government there to be able to 
disengage [as published] the private military groups, such as 
the Druze and Phalangist militias and others. So far, the 
Lebanese Government has not done anything to prove its ability 
to control south Lebanon. 
  [Wahbi] Let me ask one final question, which concerns 
Israel's internal affairs. How far is Foreign Minister Peres 
authorized by you to negotiate with the Palestinians? In other 
words, does Minister Peres have a real and full authorization to 
reach an agreement with the PLO or do you keep the final 
decision on the Palestinians in your hands? If so, why do you 
refuse to meet with President 'Arafat, with whom you have not 
met for a long time? 
  [Rabin] Every time Peres met with 'Arafat he had full 
authorization, and reports about a limited authorization are 
nothing but nonsense. Also, I believe that no one should 
recommend a meeting between me and Chairman 'Arafat before 
everything is made to prepare for such a meeting. This is 
because if we meet and fail to reach an agreement, it will cause 
disappointment and frustration that in fact will defeat our 
purpose of reaching an agreement that can be implemented.

  [Excerpt] His Majesty King Husayn today received at his 
place of residence in London U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher. During the meeting, the two sides made a 
comprehensive review of all issues of common concern, especially 
the peace process in the region and the siege imposed on the 
Port of al-'Aqabah. The U.S. secretary expressed the United 
States' positive response to Jordan's proposals of having Lloyds 
Register -- a civil and nonprofitmaking company -- carry out 
inspections on the ground at the Port of al-'Aqabah instead of 
the military inspection of ships at sea. 
  The U.S. secretary briefed His Majesty King Husayn on the 
latest developments in the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations. He 
expressed his hope that a tangible result will be achieved in 
the next few days. Christopher also hoped that during his 
upcoming tour of the region's countries, the bilateral 
negotiations will resume on all tracks in Washington next month. 
  His Majesty King Husayn and the secretary expressed the need 
to achieve tangible progress in these negotiations in order to 
reach a comprehensive, just, and lasting solution to all aspects 
of the Arab-Israeli conflict. 
  The talks dealt with all aspects of bilateral relations and 
the general situation in the Middle East. 
  His Majesty King Husayn expressed his continuous concern 
over 
the suffering of the Iraqi people and the difficult 
circumstances they are facing. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "U.S. Response to the Jordanian Proposals"] </F>
  [Text] During His Majesty King Husayn's meeting with U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher in London yesterday, the 
U.S. secretary said that the United States has responded to the 
proposals presented by Jordan to lift the siege of al-'Aqabah. 
He added that the inspections will be carried out by a neutral 
civilian body in the Port of al-'Aqabah instead of by offshore 
military vessels. 
  The U.S. response to the Jordanian proposals came as a 
result 
of a solid Jordanian stand following Jordan's announcement on 
many occasions on its compliance with the UN resolutions. The 
inspection of 1,700 ships bound for al-'Aqabah has proven that 
these resolutions were not violated. 
  Jordan has also announced that the offshore inspections are 
useless because there are too many other gateways to Iraq and 
because no inspection is carried out at these gateways. 
Therefore, there is no point in continuing the siege of 
al-'Aqabah alone unless the siege has other objectives related 
to the Jordanian stand vis-a-vis the peace process and 
negotiations. 
  As the prime minister asserted in his meeting with the Arab 
and foreign journalists yesterday, Jordan rejects any 
encroachment on its sovereignty by any foreign side. The 
proposals presented by Jordan stipulate that a non-political and 
not-for-profit party should carry out monitoring work, not 
inspection, while Jordanian customs employees inspect the 
containers that arrive at the port on board al-'Aqabah-bound 
ships. The proposals also stipulate that the recommended party 
-- Lloyds Register -- is to monitor, check the documents of the 
cargo, and to report to those in charge of implementing the 
sanctions on Iraq. 
  The U.S. agreement on the Jordanian proposals will end a 
clear contradiction between the objectives of the peace process 
and the unjustified imposition of sanctions on Jordan, for which 
it has paid dearly from its national economy.

<F P=106> [Interview with Lieutenant General Mohammad Gol Aryubwal, </F>
deputy defense minister, by unidentified correspondent in Kabul; 
date not given -- recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [Correspondent] Esteemed Lieutenant General 
Mohammad Gol Aryubwal, deputy defense minister of the Islamic 
State of Afghanistan, I thank you for receiving us for the 
interview. I would like to ask you -- since we are now 
completing the second anniversary of the Islamic revolution -- 
since the fall of the previous regime and the disintegration of 
its arme, the country has had a new national Islamic Army. 
Could you please give us information about the organization and 
ideological work in the Army? 
  [Aryubwal] In the name of God the compassionate, the 
merciful. As you said, the Army of Afghanistan disintegrated. 
It was an organized plan of the longstanding enemies of 
Afghanistan. For ages they planned to destroy the national 
treasures of Afghanistan -- the national archive of Afghanistan, 
the museums, and to eliminate the Afghan institutions -- to 
destroy the national Army of Afghanistan -- and with the 
implementation of that plan Afghanistan was faced with a strange 
situation which is the cause of the sorrow of every Afghan, 
every Muslim, every patriot. Through their servants they took 
all Afghan treasures to their countries. In practice now there 
is nothing in Afghanistan. 
  But although Afghanistan was confronted with a civil war by 
those enemies of its freedom, the Islamic State of Afghanistan 
was able to establish such an army to at least defend the 
national honor of Afghanistan, that is to safeguard its national 
unity and national sovereignty. And despite the problems 
created for it by the enemies, the Afghan Army has been able to 
protect national sovereignty and national unity and to abort 
many of the enemies' conspiracies. As I said before despite the 
fact that the Army is faced with big problems -- for a single 
moment the Afghan Army has not been allowed to be 
self-confident, to think about itself -- yet, thanks God, a 
large number of patriotic and nationalist trained officers, from 
every class, every stratum, every profession came together and 
organized themselves. As a result of this organization, thus 
far several conspiracies, created especially by [word 
indistinct] enemies of Afghanistan about which the world knows, 
have been aborted by this Army, and God willing so far as 
possible it will defend the national honor of the country at any 
moment, day and night. 
  From the ideological point of view too the Islamic Army is 
progressing and attention has been paid to the ideological life 
of the Army. Courses have been set up and work continues. It 
is hoped that when the Afghan Army can rest for a while it is 
expected of it to [words indistinct]. 
  [Correspondent] Unfortunately since the victory of the 
Islamic revolution there had been fighting in various directions 
in Afghanistan. Recent incidents would have caused very grave 
consequences, but the mojahedin and officials of our Islamic 
Army were able to prevent those grave incidents. Please shed 
some light on the activities and the share of the officials and 
units of the Islamic Army and mojahedin in the dislodging of the 
recent incidents. 
  [Aryubwal] As I said before, the longstanding enemies of 
Afghanistan have not for a moment allowed the Afghan nation, 
Army, and state to dress Afghanistan's wounds so as to take care 
of its affairs and pay attention to its national unity and 
reconstruction. [Words indistinct] especially after the recent 
conspiracy this heroic, Muslim and patriotic Army, which cannot 
even be called an army compared with other armies, was able to 
abort a dangerous conspiracy, a coup d'etat. Not only did it 
abort the coup d'etat, but it also gained many victories, which 
are a cause of pride for this Army. Military experts can 
understand the fact that an army, which even cannot be called an 
army, was able to abort such a dangerous coup d'etat that was 
supported by many foreign powers, and to capture many areas from 
the enemies. 
  For example since the failed coup d'etat of 11 Jadi [1 
January] this Army has cleared up bravely the area of the 
airport, where previously militia forces resided, and the areas 
of Qabelbai, Hudkhel, Banayi, Alokhel, Milli Bus, Microrayon 
Bridge, the area of Idgah mosque, the surroundings of Balahesar, 
Maiwand Wat, [east and south of Kabul] the surroundings of 
Bagh-e Babor, the surrounding of Dehmazang, the cultural area of 
Kabul, and many other areas in Kabul. 
  Outside Kabul many victories have been achieved. For 
instance, Parwan Province has been completely cleared of the 
enemies and many positions have been conquered. The enemy is in 
very small area of Kapisa Province, God willing, and in a short 
time that area will also be cleared [words indistinct]. In 
northern areas such as in Faryab Province many areas have been 
cleared of the militia. The area of Pol-e Khomri [in Baghlan] 
is completely cleared. Northern Salang, Khinjan, Doshi, 
Samangan Province, and the districts of Balkh Province have been 
conquered. In the near future we will hear about other 
conquests too. [passage omitted]

  [Text] In Islamabad, a Foreign Office spokesman has 
expressed concern over the report that India is once again 
inducting additional troops in occupied Kashmir. He said it is 
evident that while talking about dialogue, Indian authorities 
are intent to repress by force the legitimate struggle of 
Kashmiri people. 
  The spokesman expressed the hope that the Muslim ambassadors 
visiting Indian-held Kashmir would report an objective 
evaluation of the situation to their respective governments and 
ICO [Islamic Conference Organization] secretary general, so that 
the Muslim world would have better knowledge of the atrocities 
being perpetrated by the Indian forces in the held valley. The 
spokesman hoped that the ambassadors will be allowed free access 
to visit all parts of the held valley, including the sites of 
recent massacres in Sopor and Bijbiara, and to meet the Kashmiri 
leaders, including those under detention. However, the 
spokesman said according to our information, unfortunately, it 
appears that once again this visit will be a conducted tour.

  [Text] The former president of Afghanistan, Professor 
Sebghatollah Mojaddedi, called on the president, Mr. Farooq 
Ahmad Khan Leghari, in Islamabad today. During the meeting, he 
held wide-ranging discussions with the president. Speaking of 
prospects of peace in Afghanistan, President Leghari emphasized 
that this will have to be an indigenous process, as anything

expressed the hope that developed countries would not wait for 
complete peace to begin reconstruction work in Afghanistan.

and affirmed that he would make every effort to bring to an end

  [Text] New York, April 28, IRNA -- Iranian Foreign Minister 
'Ali Akbar Velayati here today in his address to the Security 
Council criticized the Council for failing to come to terms with 
"the real cause of the tragedy" in Bosnia. "We have never faced 
a civil war in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It has been a blatant 
aggression, which continues to be waged against a member of the 
United Nations," Velayati told the Council, adding that, it was 
the duty of the Council to see to it that aggressors were 
repelled and punished. He blasted the United Nations for 
overseeing the confiscation of arms from defenseless Muslims in 
places such as Srebrenica while allowing the Serbs who had 
surrounded the city to keep their heavy weapons. 
  Despite repeated declaration by the UN that it did not 
possess sufficient resources and man-power to defend the 
Bosnians, Velayati said, the UN failed to take advantage of the 
offer by some Muslim governments to send peace-keepers under the 
pretext that they were not neutral enough. 
  "Yet troops from a well-known supporter of the Serbs were 
deployed in a most critical area around Sarajevo," he added. 
Velayati also criticized the Security Council for shirking its 
responsibilities in Bosnia-Herzegovina under the pretext of 
having a "balanced approach" and said that such approaches were 
responsible for creating the impression that "a strong bias 
against Muslims is prevalent in the Security Council." The 
perception, he said, leads to frustration amongs the Muslims who 
perceive the Security Council as biased and insensitive towards 
the plight of the Muslims. "This frustration has obvious 
consequences. And the responsibility will be borne by those who 
have so blatantly applied the double standards, and put their 
perceived strategic interests before the lives of hundreds of 
thousands of innocent human beings," he added.

  [Text] Tehran, April 26, IRNA -- Majlis Speaker 'Ali Akbar 
Nateq-Nuri here Tuesday [26 April] praised the nation for its 
readiness to assist Bosnian Muslims and said the Islamic 
Republic of Iran was the first country to extend practical 
support to Bosnian Muslims. 
  Speaking to a group of workers gathered in front of the 
Majlis to announce readiness to defend Bosnian Muslims, 
Nateq-Nuri stated that Majlis deputies, in compliance with the 
supreme leader's call, are also prepared to give any assistance 
to the Bosnian Muslims. 
  He criticized the arrogant powers for their aid to the Serbs 
and the United Nations for its silence toward the crimes being 
committed by the Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Nateq-Nuri 
expressed hope that the Bosnian Muslims who are resisting with 
empty hands against the armed-to-the-teeth aggressor Serbs will 
be victorious and will bring disgrace to the UN and to those who 
backed the aggressors.

  [Text] Tehran, April 26, IRNA -- Majlis Speaker 'Ali Akbar 
Nateq-Nuri here Tuesday [26 April] called on parliament speakers 
of Muslim states to use every available channel to press the 
lifting of the United Nations embargo against aggressed Bosnia. 
  In a message to his counterparts in Muslim countries, the 
Hojjat ol-Eslam said that in accordance with Article 51 of the 
United Nations Charter, imposition of arms embargo against 
Bosnia which is suffering from Serb aggression, should be 
regarded as violation of the republic's sovereignty. 
  Nateq-Nuri addressed himself to his counterparts in Islamic 
states, and emphasized that the only possibility to confront the 
ongoing genocide and aggression against the people of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina is honouring the people's and the 
government's right of defending sovereignty and territorial 
integrity of the republic. 
  The message stressed that the issue of lifting the arms 
embargo should be taken into consideration in any peace talks of 
the contact group of the Organization of the Islamic Conference 
(OIC) at the UN. 
  The speaker said that the unsuccessful experience of 
diplomatic negotiations to restore peace in Bosnia has 
practically led to weakening of the Muslims and strengthening of 
the Serb aggressors.

policy, to march to the assistance of the defenceless people of

  [Text] Tehran, April 27, IRNA -- A Persian daily Wednesday 
[27 April] lauded the heroic resistance of Muslims in Gorazde 
and said such a withstanding heralds a bright prospect for Islam 
in the heart of Europe. The daily `JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI' urged 
Muslim nations and governments to feel responsible more than 
ever and assist the resisting Bosnian Muslims through any 
possible means. 
  The daily called on hajj pilgrims to raise the issue of the 
oppression of the Bosnian Muslims by the Serbs during the annual 
hajj rituals. It hailed the measures taken by certain Islamic 
countries, especially Iran, in recent days to pressure the UN 
and supporters of the Serbs in abating the Serbs crimes in 
Gorazde. 
  This is indicative of the fact that both Muslim nations and 
governments own potentials that, if used properly and on time, 
can prevent numerous crimes that the arrogant front is 
committing against Muslims in various parts of the world. 
  The editorial in conclusion called on hajj pilgrims to try 
to 
find suitable and practical ways for offering economic, 
political, military and psychological assistnce to the Bosnian 
Muslims.

  [Text] Tehran, April 27, IRNA -- Education Minister 
Mohammad 'Ali Najafi who has been recently impeached by the 
Majlis (parliament), was quoted as saying that he would defend 
his stand whenever the motion is brought to the Majlis.

the event in the Majlis. He did not go into further details. 
  The impeachment was called by a total of 29 Majlis deputies 
early this week and so far no details as to why he had been 
summoned have been made public. 
  Usually a minister is summoned to be formally questioned 
concerning an official action, policy or personal conduct, said

of some deputies working on a plan to withdraw the impeachment 
proceedings.

  [Text] During today's open session of the Islamic Majles an 
urgent draft bill on controlling commodity and service prices 
was submitted to the Majles. The Majles approved the urgency of 
this draft bill. 
  The introduction part of this draft bill says: The task of 
fixing prices is taken away from the Economic Council and is 
transferred to the Islamic Majles. The deputies, who have 
signed the only article of this draft bill, have demanded that 
every price change of commodities and services should be 
proposed and approved by the Islamic Majles before 
implementation. The draft bill has also proposed that all such 
price rises announced by the Economic Council or other 
authorities, which came into effect from the beginning of 
Farvardin this year [since 21 March], should be declared null 
and void. 
  During today's open session of the Islamic Majles, the 
speaker Mr. 'Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri announced: The call for 
impeachment of the education minister [Mohammad 'Ali Najafi], 
which was submitted to the Majles by 29 deputies, is contrary to 
Article 151 of the Majles internal regulations and is therefore 
turned down because the cases raised are general and a number of 
the signatories have retracted. The speaker of the Islamic 
Majles stressed: If the deputies wish to go ahead with the 
impeachment, they can resubmit the impeachment request by giving 
a detailed and precise account of the cases. 
  I would like to point out that the call for impeachment of 
the education minister has been signed and submitted to the 
Majles presidium. Among the instances of criticism raised are a 
drop in the level of academic progress of students, the granting 
of licences to managers of the Ministry to set up 
non-profit-making schools, ignoring the wishes of hezbollahi 
heads of schools, and squandering the national wealth. 
  Also during today's open session of the Majles, results of 
the votes cast to elect a number of deputies proposed in some 
notes of the country's budget bill for the year 1373 were 
announced. During this session, there was a debate on the first 
reading of a bill to establish rural development centers. After 
hearing the remarks made by a number of deputies for and against 
this bill, it was rejected without being approved.

  Granting study bursaries to Iranian students studying 
fishing 
industries, marine wild life, and maritime installations, as 
well as the decision to hold training workshops in Iran and 
Ireland were among the key aspects of the agreement reached 
between the two ministers.

  [Text] Tehran, April 27, IRNA -- The terrorist Mujahideen 
Khalq Organization (MKO) has backed the aborted attempt on the 
life of the substitute Friday prayer leader of Mashhad Hojjat 
ol-Eslam Aba'i Khorasani, on April 22. In a radio broadcast 
from Iraq, the terrorist grouplet described the failed 
assassination attempt as a popular move without mentioning its 
links with the assassin. 
  An armed assailant, identified by the Ministry of 
Information 
as 'Ali Huri, shot and wounded Hojjat ol-Eslam Khorasani on 
Friday. He was later arrested by worshippers and handed over to 
police. Huri has confessed to his link with the Iraq-based 
terrorist grouplet and the MKO has not denied the link.

<F P=106> [Report by Moti Amir in Cairo] </F>
  [Text] A news conference with Major General Amnon Shahaq 
ended a few minutes ago. The bottom line of what Gen. Shahaq 
had to say is that he is not sure the Cairo negotiations will be 
completed this week. 
  [Begin recording] [Shahaq] I do not think that the 
negotiations will be completed this week. Progress is 
definitely being made because we work around the clock. We meet 
and things are being settled, but there is still work to be 
done. There is no cardinal issue on which there are 
differences, but there are many issues for which there are still 
no answers and with which we are currently dealing -- some of 
which can become difficult to resolve and therefore important. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Are there issues that will be 
finalized after the agreement is signed? 
  [Shahaq] There will be issues that will be resolved after 
the signing, and agreement must be reached on that as well. If 
that happens, those issues will be put off and work on them will 
continue immediately after the signing. [end recording] 
  Gen. Shahaq noted that he does know about any Peres-'Arafat 
meeting in Cairo at the end of the week and refused to say which 
issues remain controversial. He merely said that there are no 
substantive disputes but that the small print must also be 
negotiated. Asked what these issues are, he said: 
  [Begin Shahaq recording] I do not think it is significant, 
even for you, because you are not sitting with a list and 
checking off the issues. We have almost completed the 
deliberations on civilian issues, but even that is not totally 
accurate. Last week I mentioned passports, dialing zones, 
stamps, and currency as issues on which agreement has not yet 
been reached. There are also other issues on which we are still 
deliberating. Some of the security issues have also been 
completed, but I think it is pointless and irrelevant for most 
people to become involved in the niceties. All the issues have 
to be resolved. We referred earlier to the issue of crossings 
and safe passage [last two words in English]. The gaps on those 
issues are very, very small, and I think they will also be 
settled this week. I think that when the week ends, we will 
provide a list of all the issues completed this week. [end 
recording] 
  On the agreement reached between Fatah and Hamas [Islamic 
Resistance Movement] in the Gaza Strip, Gen. Shahaq stressed 
that Israel will not accept agreements between the two 
organizations that permit Hamas to continue attacking Israel. 
  [Begin Shahaq recording] As long as meetings between Fatah 
and Hamas are devoted to resolving conflicts between them and to 
the problems of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, they do not 
constitute a problem for us. If, however, they are meant to 
provide a distribution of labor between Fatah, which will abide 
by the agreement, and Hamas, which will take actions not 
permitted in the agreement, that is not only unacceptable but 
will not happen and will have an impact on the talks. I think 
that is clear. We were told that this is not what took place 
and will also not take place in the future. [end recording]

  [Text] Cairo, 26 Apr (MENA)--General Amnon Shahaq, Israeli 
deputy chief of staff and head of the Israeli delegation to the

completed 50 percent of an agreement.

  [Text] Cairo, 26 Apr (MENA)--Dr. Nabil Sha'th, political 
adviser to Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat and head of the 
Palestinian delegation to the Gaza-Jericho negotiations, has 
stated that the Palestinian and Israeli teams will go back to 
their leaders for consultations on the subjects that have been 
talked about and then meet once again to prepare the final 
version of the agreement for implementing self-rule in Gaza and 
Jericho. 
  Speaking at a news conference today, Sha'th said that it is 
not possible now to set a final date for signing the agreement, 
although the two sides are trying to deal with the issues left 
from last week and want to finalize the negotiations by the end 
of the week, if possible. The Palestinian official added: We 
are working day and night to get it over with as soon as 
possible. 
  Dr. Sha'th stated that 'Arafat will arrive in Cairo tomorrow 
evening and will meet with President Husni Mubarak on Thursday 
morning. He added that 'Arafat will hold talks with Foreign 
Minister 'Amr Musa and U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher. 
  Dr. Sha'th noted that he will represent President 'Arafat at 
a small ceremony to be held at Cairo Airport in the presence of 
Musa and Christopher to mark the arrival of the first group of 
Palestinian police vehicles donated by the United States to the 
Palestinians. There are 200 vehicles, he added. He pointed out 
that the remaining vehicles will arrive at Port Said within two 
weeks, noting that the first group, which will be transported by 
air, will be available for use by the Palestinian police once 
the agreement for implementing the Gaza-Jericho accord is signed. 
  Dr. Sha'th expressed the hope that during U.S. Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher's visit to Egypt beginning tomorrow the 
two sides will finalize all parts of the agreement, except for 
two or three items that will be endorsed by President Yasir 
'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin. Sha'th 
welcomed any effort made by the U.S. secretary of state during 
his tour, saying: We welcome the role of the U.S. cosponsor in 
promoting the negotiations. 
  Asked whether President 'Arafat will meet with the Israeli 
Foreign Minister in Cairo, Dr. Sha'th said he did not know if 
Peres will arrive in Cairo some time after tomorrow. If Peres 
does arrive, he might meet with 'Arafat. However, such a 
meeting has not been confirmed. 
  Dr. Sha'th said the two sides are working to find solutions, 
clarify all matters, sign the agreement, and work out any 
pending details. He said: We do not want to divulge the 
details of the progress in the negotiations now. Perhaps all 
details will be announced in two days. He added: We are trying 
our best to finish the negotiations. 
  Dr. Sha'th indicated that he is "optimistic" by nature. 
However, this is a very difficult process in which the 
Palestinians are seeking justice. 
  Regarding the date the Palestinian police will enter Gaza 
and 
Jericho, Dr. Sha'th said that some forces will begin their 
duties after the signing of the agreement and that 6,000 
Palestinian policemen will be deployed in the two areas one week 
after the signing. 
  On the meeting between PLO Executive Committee member Mahmud 
'Abbas, alias Abu-Mazin, and Chief Israeli Negotiator Gen. Amnon 
Shahaq, Dr. Sha'th said the two sides reviewed the course of the 
negotiations before Abu-Mazin left for Tunis today. He added 
that Abu-Mazin could return to Cairo tomorrow with Palestinian 
President Yasir 'Arafat. 
  Dr. Sha'th said that a team of legal experts will revise the 
items of the agreement in light of the Palestinian documents 
next week. The team consists of Dr. George Sealam [name as 
received], a U.S. professor of international law, and Dr. Mufid 
Shihab and Dr. Salah 'Amir, two Egyptian professors of 
international law. 
  On the criticism by [former chief Palestinian negotiator] 
Dr. 
Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi of the current negotiations, Dr. Sha'th 
said the PLO welcomes objective opposition within the democratic 
framework serving the Palestinian people's cause. He added: We 
respect Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi and appreciate his view. What we are 
doing now is only a small step on a long road to achieving our 
goals.

<F P=106> [Aharon Barne'a video report from Cairo] </F>
  [Excerpts] There will be no agreement between the PLO and 
Israel unless a timetable is determined for the release of all 
Palestinian prisoners, including Hamas [Islamic Resistance 
Movement] members. This was said today by Dr. Ahmad al-Tibi, 
'Arafat's adviser. It was reported in Cairo today that the 
delegations will continue their meetings next week. The date 
for the signing of the agreement has still not been determined. 
  [Begin recording] [passage omitted] [Al-Tibi] Without an 
agreed-upon timetable for the release of all the Palestinian 
prisoners there will be no agreement. 
  [Barne'a] Are you referring to all the prisoners, including 
Hamas people? 
  [Al-Tibi] All the prisoners are Palestinians, and the PLO is 
the legitimate leadership of the entire Palestinian people, 
therefore it is responsible for all prisoners, regardless of 
their affiliation. [end recording]

  [Excerpt] Sources described as informed have said that the 
Palestinian-Israeli Liaison Committee, which is chaired by 
brother Abu-Mazin [Mahmud 'Abbas], member of the PLO Executive 
Committee, and Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, will meet 
next Thursday [28 April] if the current dispute over a number of 
issues before the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations persists. 
Each side is insisting on its stance vis-a-vis a number of 
fundamental issues. 
  Palestinian sources have said that the Israeli side in the 
negotiations is insisting on its position regarding the topic of 
travel documents that the self-rule authority will provide to 
the Palestinian citizens. They are insisting on writing State 
of Israel on the cover while the Palestinian side stresses that 
this is unacceptable because it deprives the self rule of all 
authority. 
  The other fundamental point of contention is the subjugation 
of the coasts of Gaza to an Israeli authority, especially in the 
Khan Yunis area. 
  Regarding passage between Jericho and Gaza, the Israeli 
position has retracted in the new round of negotiations, 
expressing reservations over the passage linking the two areas. 
The Israeli side is proposing to make the link by air in order 
to avoid accidents in the future. The Israeli side also refuses 
to grant the right of the self-ruling authority to issue postage 
stamps under the pretext that what is being negotiated is a 
transitional self rule, while the travel document and the stamps 
represent manifestations of a state. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by On Levi] </F>
  [Text] Senior sources in the Israeli peace delegation 
yesterday sharply criticized the Palestinians for delaying the 
arrival of their representatives in the territories. These 
representatives are supposed to prepare the arrival of the 
Palestinian police and the transfer of civilian powers from the 
Civil Administration to the Palestinian autonomy authorities. 
  The Israeli sources said that "the fact that the 
Palestinians 
are not sending their people to Gaza and Jericho prior to the 
signing of the agreement could harm their ability to assume 
responsibility for these areas after it is signed." The sources 
claim that this issue has been raised many times during the 
talks, but to date the Palestinians did nothing about it. 
  According to Nabil Sha'th, head of the Palestinian 
delegation, some 6,000 Palestinian policemen will arrive in the 
autonomous areas 12 hours after the agreement is signed. 
  Sources in the Palestinian delegation yesterday confirmed 
that the issue was raised many times. They expressed 
understanding for the Israeli concern, but added that it has 
still not been decided who will serve in what post and therefore 
they have difficulties in starting operations on the ground. 
  The Palestinian sources added, however, that in the last few 
meetings it has been agreed that the Palestinian policemen will 
arrive in the autonomy a short time after the signing of the 
agreement. They will arrive with their arms and other military 
equipment and enter the Palestinian police bases. It was also 
decided that as long as the IDF does not transfer the 
responsibility to the Palestinian police, the policemen will 
travel unarmed in the autonomous areas in order to avoid mishaps.

  [Text] Cairo, 27 Apr (MENA)--The Palestinian-Israeli 
negotiations to implement autonomy in Gaza and Jericho resumed 
today. The Palestinian side is led by Dr. Nabil Sha'th, 
political adviser to President Yasir 'Arafat while the Israeli 
side is headed by Deputy Chief of Staff General Amnon Shahaq. 
  Knowledgeable Palestinian sources have told MENA that the 
Legal and Security Affairs Committees will try today to reach an 
agreement over a number of issues still under dispute. The same 
sources pointed out that progress was achieved on several topics 
during the round that started on Sunday, 24 April. This 
includes the two sides' agreement over the corridor between Gaza 
and Jericho and the provision of permits--valid for one year--to 
cars that use this corridor. This step, the sources added, will 
facilitate contact between the two autonomous regions--Gaza and 
Jericho. 
  The Palestinian sources said that agreement was also 
reached on a Palestinian presence in a place called al-Mawasi in 
al-Shati' area, Gaza Strip, where Israel had previously rejected 
any Palestinian presence. 
  The sources said progress was made on the question of legal 
jurisdiction over the Gaza Strip and Jericho area, so that 
foreigners will be subject to Palestinian authority, as will the 
prosecution of suspects in security and criminal cases there. 
The sources affirmed that agreement was reached on instituting 
joint patrols on parallel roads linking the Israeli settlements, 
especially in Gaza. 
  The sources explained that despite the progress made in this 
round, it is not expected that all the issues will be resolved 
during this round. The sources said the release of Palestinian 
detainees; some points on control over the crossings between 
Gaza, Egypt, Jericho, and Jordan; and control over the crossing 
points on the green line separating Israel and the West Bank are 
still outstanding. 
  Therefore, another round is likely to be held next week to 
discuss the remaining unresolved issues. The next round is 
expected to be the last.

  [Text] The PLO and Israeli delegations will continue the 
discussions until an agreement is signed between the two 
parties. Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres will leave for Cairo 
tomorrow to meet with Egyptian President Husni Mubarak, PLO 
Chairman Yasir 'Arafat, and U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher. Our political correspondent Udi Segal reports from 
Cairo: 
  [Begin recording] [Segal] The negotiations between the PLO 
and Israeli delegations in Cairo will continue unabated until 
the Gaza-Jericho First agreement is signed. This piece of news 
was revealed by Dr. Nabil Sha'th a short while ago. Sha'th said 
that the negotiations were making rapid progress. A written 
document noting down all the agreements on civilian issues was 
presented for the first time today. Work continues on the 
documents, or rather on the thick pamphlets, pertaining to 
security and legal issues. The main differences still revolve 
around issues of jurisdiction. 
  As for the issue of Palestinian prisoners, Dr. Nabil Sha'th 
asserted that progress had been made, noting that in general, he 
could no longer describe any issues as problematic. Sha'th 
sketched out the problems the delegations would have to confront 
in future. 
  [Sha'th, in English] The Israeli delegation for the first 
time will remain here all through this weekend. We are also 
going to remain here. We are at the stage of final drafting and 
final redrafting, therefore it is difficult to say when. We are 
working every day till the day of signing from now on. 
  [Segal translates above remarks and continues] When the 
correspondents became insistent, Sha'th smiled apologetically 
and said that since he had come under criticism for being overly 
optimistic, he would not specify a date for signing the 
agreement until the actual invitations to the signing ceremony 
had been printed. Sha'th also confirmed that Foreign Minister 
Shim'on Peres would arrive in Cairo tomorrow morning. Egyptian 
Foreign Ministry sources said that Peres would meet tomorrow 
afternoon with President Husni Mubarak, PLO Chairman Yasir 
'Arafat, and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher who is 
arriving in Egypt this evening. 
  Minister Shulamit Aloni is also in Cairo and receives 
occasional updates on the negotiations. Minister Aloni said the 
agreement would probably be signed next week and called on Prime 
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin to show greater flexibility with regard 
to the Palestinian demands for their own postage stamp, 
passport, and telephone area code. 
  [Aloni] I think that the agreement can be signed next week. 
The problem is whether or not the Palestinians raise new issues 
and whether or not we show narrow-mindedness. As soon as the 
security problems are resolved we should move forward and try to 
make things easier, bearing in mind that we control them and are 
thus the last country in the world dominating another people. 
We should start easing things for them. I think that today the 
prime minister holds the key to most of the decisions and I hope 
that he brings the issues before the cabinet. All these 
ostensible symbols of sovereignty that scare some people so much 
should not be so terrifying. Palestine was a British colony for 
30 years and had its own stamps. That did not make Palestine 
independent and we needed a War of Independence before we became 
a sovereign country. [end recording]

the first time remain in Cairo over the weekend. 
  Dr. Sha'th said that the only topics officially deferred to 
the meeting between Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat and 
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin are the size of the Jericho 
area and the Palestinian presence on the Allenby Bridge. If any 
other problems remain, they will be automatically deferred to 
them. 
  Dr. Sha'th said the negotiators will continue their talks 
until a final agreement is signed. He explained that the date 
of the signing of the agreement will not be set until official 
invitations are sent for the attendance of the signing ceremony. 
  Dr. Sha'th said we are moving quickly and it is very 
difficult for us to evaluate what we have achieved so far. 
  Asked whether an agreement has been reached on the issue of 
legal jurisdiction, Dr. Sha'th said this point is still under 
discussion. He indicated that today's talks did not encounter 
any major problems. They dealt with the transfer of civilian 
powers to the Palestinian civilian authority. He noted that 
these points were agreed on before but that they are being 
incorporated into one document. He added that there has been 
progress made on the issue of detainees. 
  Asked whether the Palestinian and Israeli delegations will 
defer the issue of legal jurisdiction to the 'Arafat-Peres 
meeting, Dr. Sha'th said we are trying not to leave out any 
point we can discuss. We are trying to spare 'Arafat and Peres 
the effort. He added that the timetable being prepared now is 
measured in days and not weeks. 
  Dr. Sha'th said he met with Israeli Communications Minister 
Shulamit Aloni, who promised to help speed up the negotiating 
process, especially on the issuance of Palestinian stamps, which 
is a point of disagreement between the Israelis and Palestinians.

  [Text] Cairo, 27 Apr (MENA)--Muhammad Dahlan, member of the 
Palestinian delegation to the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations, 
has said that a general Palestinian-Israeli agreement is 
currently being formulated to release all 8,400 Palestinian 
detainees in Israeli jails. In a statement to MENA, he noted 
that this agreement allows for the release of detainees of all 
political inclinations so that a timetable can be worked out 
later. 
  In an earlier statement to MENA, Dahlan said that an 
agreement was reached to release 2,500 Palestinian detainees two 
days after the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho agreement is 
signed, 2,000 other detainees will be released after the Israeli 
withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho is completed, 500 will be 
released one month after the withdrawal, and 2,000 will be set 
free after the beginning of negotiations to implement 
Palestinian self-rule. He noted that no agreement has been 
reached on the procedure for releasing the other 1,400 detainees. 
  Palestinian sources said that camps are being prepared in 
Rafah to receive the Palestinian police force that will be 
deployed in Gaza after the final signing of the implementation 
of the Gaza-Jericho agreement. These sources said that Egypt 
offered facilities and equipment for these camps. They noted 
that the Palestinian police force consists of 7,000 personnel 
from outside the occupied territories in addition to 2,000 from 
inside them.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ambassador Itamar Rabinovich by Arye Golan </F>
in Washington, date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Golan] Ambassador Rabinovich, Syria claims that 
Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's willingness to implement a deep 
withdrawal and to uproot settlements on the Golan Heights, is 
simply a word game. Following that claim by the Syrian 
Government newspaper AL-BA'TH, is there still hope for a 
breakthrough in peace with Syria? 
  [Rabinovich] I think we have to differentiate between 
statements by the Syrian media and actual moves in the 
negotiations. We are on the eve of the secretary of state's 
visit and the important exchange of views will of course take 
place in Damascus between President al-Asad and Secretary 
Christopher and it does not necessarily depend on what the media 
says. At the same time, we Israelis and those who follow the 
process regret that while the Israeli leaders make very resolute 
declarations about the peace process, which indicate the depth 
of the Israeli commitment to the process and the readiness to 
discuss sensitive and painful issues, the Syrian response is 
disappointing. We would like the response to improve, and we 
hope it will be better, but this is still but the background 
music and not the negotiations themselves. 
  [Golan] Does the peace package prepared in Jerusalem for 
Secretary Christopher to take to Damascus include a working 
assumption of a full withdrawal from the Golan Heights? 
  [Rabinovich] Definitely not. I think we should not 
exaggerate the word, package. In order to make peace or 
ascertain that there is a sufficient basis for an agreement, 
Israel and Syria must agree on more than just two issues. That 
is, even if a formula acceptable to both sides is found on the 
issues of peace and withdrawal, that does not mean that we have 
reached critical mass on the arrangement. 
  [Golan] Have you succeeded in making any progress in the 
secret track you are conducting here in Washington with Syria 
Ambassador Walid Mu'allim? 
  [Rabinovich] The secret track you refer to is so secret that 
even I do not know about it. In the two last rounds of talks, 
we met with the Syrians at discreet meetings -- not delegations, 
just private meetings, which lasted almost until daybreak. 
These talks were good. We started serious discussions there on 
security and a timetable. Starts were made on very complex 
issues. The negotiations with the Syrians are moving very 
slowly. We prepared the ground for the qualitative leap in the 
negotiations, which can be achieved either by the secretary of 
state or the political leaderships in both countries. 
  [Golan] Will that happen sometime in 1994? 
  [Rabinovich] Operatively it could take place in 1994, and 
that would be good. I think the Syrian approach to the 
negotiations is what will decide if the negotiations take off in 
1994 or not. 
  [Golan] Does the package -- or basket, as you call it -- we 
will be sending with Christopher to al-Asad contain new ideas, 
proposals, promises or incentives we have not yet offered him to 
induce him to make peace with Israel? 
  [Rabinovich] No, we are not asking him to do us any favors. 
In the final analysis, they have to do something for an 
agreement to come about. If they want an agreement it is for 
their self-interest. From that point of view, we do not have a 
feeling that we have to make new, more tempting proposals. The 
dynamics of the negotiations have to lead to a situation whereby 
even finding a bridging formula on the issues of peace and 
withdrawal will not resolve the problem, will not form the 
minimal basis for a breakthrough in the negotiations. That is 
the reason for moving to the basket [sal] approach, which does 
not depend on new ideas or initiatives.

<F P=106> [Report by Pinhas 'Inbari] </F>
  [Text] Israel is demanding that Syria make possible a 
meeting between Foreign Ministers Shim'on Peres and Faruq 
al-Shar'. It believes that Rabin's recent statements regarding 
the evacuation of settlements from the Golan Heights justifies a 
Syrian acquiescence in this issue. Such a meeting is vital for 
convincing the Israeli public to accept the price of peace. 
  These messages are being relayed to Syria via the United 
States. Israeli diplomatic sources briefed our correspondent 
about some of the ongoing contacts. It is likely that Rabin 
relayed similar messages via Russia as well. 
  According to the sources, Israel is not only demanding to 
upgrade the talks, but also to open a secret, informal channel 
of talks between trusted representatives of Rabin and al-Asad. 
  These talks are supposed to be conducted in the following 
fashion: Suppose Israel withdraws from the entire Golan, what, 
in your opinion, will Syria give Israel in return? This is what 
the Israeli representative will ask his interlocutor. 
  According to the sources, Syria claimed it cannot open such 
a 
secret channel despite the fact that Israel believes talks 
conducted without official minutes being taken are immune to 
leaks. Syria has also differentiated between what it termed 
"peace," and "the results of peace" -- thus expressing its 
unwillingness to implement normalization immediately after the 
agreements are signed. 
  As far as the withdrawal timetable, Syria is talking about 
one year, whereas Israel wants the withdrawal to be phased out 
over a 10 year period. 
  The sources said that tactical differences have surfaced 
between the United States and Israel. While Israel is against 
facilitating talks on the Syrian track as long as the talks with 
the PLO are still going on, the United States is claiming there 
is no connection between the two tracks and it is inadvisable to 
wait until the agreements with the PLO are signed. 
  The sources claim this is the reason why Christopher 
retracted his earlier decision to wait for the Israel-PLO 
signing ceremony. They add he has no intention of intervening in 
the Israel-PLO negotiations. 
  The sources noted that the date for the resumption of the 
Washington talks will be determined only after there is an 
agreement with Syria regarding the framework and the contents of 
the talks.

  [Excerpts] Cairo, 26 Apr (MENA)--The 10th session of the 
Arab Justice Ministers Council began at the Arab League 
headquarters here tonight under the chairmanship of United Arab 
Emirates Justice Minister Dr. 'Abdallah Bin-'Imran Turyam. 
  The ministers will discuss during their two days of meetings 
a number of Arab issues that will boost joint Arab action, 
including the unification of Arab legislation, the draft law on 
unified financial transactions, the unified criminal draft law, 
the plan to unify civic measures, the Arab human rights plan, 
the unified Arab draft law on land registration, and the plan on 
preventing the phenomena of extremism and terrorism. [passage 
omitted] 
  Addressing the meeting, Arab League Secretary General Dr. 
'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid stressed that the draft agreement on 
preventing the phenomena of extremism and terrorism is one of 
the most important issues that the justice ministers will 
discuss. He said: This issue is of concern to Arab citizens 
all across our Arab nation because of its close link to the Arab 
nation's values and traditions. These values and traditions are 
based on rejection of violence and terrorism and on adherence to 
the principles of the tolerant Islamic shari'ah, the principles 
of right and justice, and commitment to the international 
charters and the principles of public and private international 
law. 
  He added that the sons of the Arab nation are looking toward 
this meeting and waiting for the resolutions that will have a 
bearing on the core of the various aspects of Arab society. They 
are waiting to see the effect this will have on strengthening 
and bolstering Arab solidarity, which is of extreme importance 
in view of international and regional changes. The Arab 
countries have to pay attention to these changes and deal with 
them from a united Arab stand based on coordination and 
integration of the Arab efforts so as to back the Arab 
negotiator in the process of a comprehensive and just peace. 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid called on the Arab countries to prepare to 
deal with the economic changes brought about by the signing of 
the "GATT" agreement and to seek political solidarity and 
economic integration. He added that this can be brought about 
through the achievement of Arab reconciliation. [passage

  [Text] The proceedings of the 10th session of the council 
of Arab justice ministers began in Cairo last night. Over two 
days the participants will study a number of drafts for unified 
Arab legislation and a draft agreement on preventing and 
countering the manifestations of terrorism and extremism. 
  Algerian Justice Minister Mohamed Teguia, who is 
representing 
Algeria at these proceedings, said in his address that he hoped 
the round would produce results which would help to establish 
the foundations of joint Arab endeavors. 
  The Algerian justice minister stressed that the inclusion of 
a draft Arab agreement to prevent the manifestations of 
terrorism was an important and timely step in response to one of 
the most serious threats to have affected a number of Arab 
countries since they regained their national sovereignty. 
  He said that terrorism was born of extremism, and that 
extremism was the most dangerous plague these states had 
experienced in their modern history. He explained that progress 
could only be achieved if the preconditions of security were 
provided in our societies and justice prevailed in them. 
  Mohamed Teguia ended his address by emphasizing that Algeria 
was fine despite the campaigns of intimidation, and that under 
the new leadership it had found the road towards the solution of 
its problems by opening up national dialogue on the one hand and 
consolidating security on the other.

  [Text] Cairo, 27 Apr (INA)--Shabib al-Maliki, minister of 
justice and leader of the Iraqi delegation to the meetings of 
the 10th session of the Arab Justice Ministers Council, has 
asserted that Iraq, under His Excellency President Saddam 
Husayn, is very interested in promoting and enhancing joint Arab 
action in all areas. 
  In a speech delivered to the Arab Justice Ministers Council 
in Cairo, the minister said Iraq will keep Arab reconciliation 
at the top of its political agenda despite the circumstances of 
the embargo clamped on it. The embargo, the minister noted, 
will not distract Iraq from its pan-Arab role of defending the 
interests of the Arab nation and its fateful causes. 
  Shabib al-Maliki explained to the Arab justice ministers 
that 
Iraq has fulfilled its commitments per the relevant UN Security 
Council resolutions, particularly Resolution 687, Paragraph 22 
of which provides for the expeditious lifting of the sanctions 
clamped on Iraq. 
  The justice minister urged Arab and international peoples, 
as 
well as the advocates and champions of justice, to strongly 
demand that the UN Security Council comply with its own 
resolutions and honor its commitments to Iraq, including the 
commitment to lift the embargo clamped on its mujahid people. 
This, he noted, is dictated by humanitarian and pan-Arab 
duties, not to mention the requirements of Arab solidarity. 
  Al-Maliki said the tenets of fairness, which the Arab 
justice 
ministers enthusiastically promote in the Arab homeland, are 
being disturbed in terms of international relations. These 
tenets are enormously jeopardized. This compromises the 
stability of world peoples in general, and the Arab people in 
particular, because Arab and international developments have 
made it easy for the forces of aggression and colonialism to 
transgress against Iraq and the Arab nation. 
  The justice minister commended the fair-minded and honorable 
people who have begun an effort to uphold right and promote 
common pan-Arab interests to sincerely and conscientiously 
express their solidarity with Iraq, demanding that the unfair, 
aggressive, and unjustifiable blockade enforced against it be 
revoked.

  [Excerpt] Algiers, 27 Apr (MENA)--Arab Maghreb Union [AMU] 
Secretary General Mohammed Amamou has denied the existence of 
any political reasons or differences among the AMU member states 
that caused the absence of Moroccan King Hassan II and Libyan 
revolution leader Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi from the Arab 
Maghreb summit that was held in Tunis early last month. 
  Amamou, who is now in Algiers to participate in the meetings 
of the follow-up committee, said in an interview with MENA that 
both leaders had their own circumstances and engagements that 
kept them from attending the summit. He noted that Morocco and 
Libya were represented at a high level and that the five member 
states participated in the summit with the leaders' approval. 
  He said the full commitment of the heads of state to the 
idea 
of a great Arab Maghreb and to serious work to consolidate 
progress and implement what has been agreed on in the context of 
the AMU was clearly evident at the Arab Maghreb summit. 
  In response to a question on the AMU's role in the Libyan 
crisis in which Libya has been accused by Western nations of 
involvement in the Lockerbie issue, Amamou said the AMU is 
continuing to do all it can to find a fair and honorable 
solution to this crisis that will guarantee security and 
stability in the region and prevent any harm being done to all 
peoples of the region, not just the Libyan people. He pointed 
out that this crisis has had far-reaching effects on all peoples 
of the region, even Egypt. He stressed that the Arab Maghreb 
countries and Egypt are concerting their efforts along with the 
Arab league to solve this problem. He noted that Arab League 
Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd al-Majid entrusted the Arab 
foreign ministers at their latest meeting to follow up on this 
issue until a fair and honorable solution is found. [passage

  [Excerpt] The proceedings of the 28th ordinary session of 
the Arab Maghreb Union [AMU] follow-up committee ended at 
El-Djazair Hotel in Algiers this evening. This is the first 
session to be held since Algeria took over the chairmanship of 
the union for the current year. The participants discussed a 
number of issues relating to the progress achieved in the 
building of the Maghreb edifice. 
  The heads of the delegations representing the five Maghreban 
states also discussed the union's relations with the other 
regional blocs and with regional and international financial 
institutions. 
  In his closing speech, Ahmed Attaf, the chairman of the 
session and secretary of state in charge of cooperation and 
Maghreban affairs in Algeria -- given that Algeria has been 
chairing the AMU since March -- expressed his satisfaction with 
the results achieved by the session which, he said, would 
undoubtedly contribute to strengthening the Maghreban process 
and increase its dynamism and activity. He added that the 
committee would follow-up the realization of the programs drawn 
up by the session, particularly the sectors that require serious 
attention. 
  AMU Secretary-General Mohamed Amamou, for his part, read out 
a thank-you message addressed to President Liamine Zeroual in 
which he wished him total success in carrying out his mission as 
current president of the Arab Maghreb Union. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Cairo, 27 Apr (MENA)--The Arab League General 
Secretariat has expressed its deep concern over the continuing 
Israeli measures against Palestinian citizens in the occupied 
Arab territories while the Palestinian-Israeli talks pass 
through a very delicate stage that requires Arabs to rally 
around the Arab negotiator. 
  In a statement today, the General Secretariat said the Arab 
negotiator is fighting an important political battle to achieve 
the desired goal of establishing a just, durable, and 
comprehensive peace in the Middle East. This, the statement 
added, requires Israel to show its credibility toward this noble 
goal by halting the policy of evacuation it is still carrying 
out in the occupied Arab territories. The statement said that 
the last such incident was on the night of 18 April, when the 
Israeli occupation forces evacuated about 110 Palestinian 
families from the Yatta area in Hebron and proclaimed this 
20-square km area a confiscated land. 
  The statement noted that the Israeli authorities' campaign 
of 
arrests and wide-scale deportation measures have covered most of 
the West Bank and Gaza Strip cities and villages. This is 
Israel's largest campaign since the arrests that preceded the 
deportation of over 400 Palestinians in December 1992 to south 
Lebanon and the subsequent deportation of 2,500 Palestinian 
laborers who work in Israel by force and under strict military 
guard. 
  The statement emphasized that these continuous Israeli 
measures create a tense atmosphere that does not contribute to 
the peace process that the Arab countries have agreed to and all 
countries have supported. 
  The General Secretariat called on the international 
community, especially cosponsor countries of the peace 
conference the United States and Russia, to force Israel to 
adhere to international legitimacy resolutions, provide 
international protection for the Palestinian citizens, implement 
the Fourth Geneva Convention that stresses the protection of 
civilians who are under occupation, and halt its arbitrary 
measures against the Palestinians in the occupied territories so 
that an appropriate climate will prevail to continue the peace 
process. This process, the statement added, aims to end the 
bloody conflict in the region and to work toward achieving 
security, stability, and development for all the region's 
nations.

  [Text] Abu Dhabi, April 27 (AFP) -- Arab states are still 
suffering from high unemployment and illiteracy rates despite 
economic reforms and educational campaigns, and the problem is 
threatening stability in the region, an official Arab report 
said on Wednesday [27 April]. 
  While illiteracy is expected to decline in the near future, 
unemployment is likely to get worse in some Arab countries due 
to economic slowdown and a rapid population growth, said the 
report by the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development and 
the Abu Dhabi-based Arab Monetary Fund. 
  "The high unemployment rate in several Arab countries is one 
of the most serious problems which affect not only economic 
development but social and political stability," the 1993 annual 
report said. 
  "What increases the dangers of this phenomenon is that 
unemployment rates are steadily rising and the problem could 
become more complicated in future." 
  The report said unemployment in some Arab countries far 
exceeded that in industrial countries where such rates do not 
exceed 10 percent. 
  In Jordan, it rose from six percent in 1985 to 19 percent in 
1991 while it increased from 13 percent to 16 percent in 
Tunisia, it said. In Morocco it stood at 16 percent and Algeria 
at 19 percent. 
  It said unemployment was widespread among educated people in 
Algeria, Egypt and Morocco. "This makes the problem more 
worrying," it added. 
  The report put the workforce in the Arab League's 22 members 
at 66 million, which it said would increase to 81 million by the 
year 2000. 
  It said the expected growth in labour was because more women 
were taking up jobs and a large number of people are within 
working age groups. 
  But the report cited what it called negative aspects in the 
labour structure in the Arab world, including the low 
productivity of workers, small contribution by women to economic 
activity and employment of children. 
  "Productivity of a worker in Europe is more than six times 
the productivity in the Arab world," it said. "The problem is 
underscored in the farming sector, which accounts for 36 percent 
of the Arab labour force but its share in the Gross Domestic 
Product did not exceed 13 percent in 1992." 
  Surveys conducted recently in some Arab nations showed 
around 
1.3 million children aged between 6-14 were working in Egypt 
while children accounted for 13.3 percent of the total workforce 
in Morocco's countryside, it said. 
  "The surveys showed that this phenomenon is prevalent in the 
countryside of other Arab countries," it said. "What adds to 
those problems is the large number of non-Arab expatriate 
workers in the Gulf oil producing states." 
  The report showed the services sector attracted the largest 
number of workers, acounting for 46 percent. 
  It was followed by the farming sector, which has 36 percent, 
and the industrial sector, with 18 percent. 
  Women accounted for only 6.7 percent of the total Arab 
workforce but the level was expected to jump to 20 percent in 
the year 2000. 
  "Illiteracy is another serious problem facing Arab states. 
Despite educational campaigns, illiteracy stood at 49 percent in 
1991 compared with 66 percent in 1970. The level is expected to 
decline further to reach 38 percent in the year 2000," the 
report said. 
  Women are suffering most, with their illiteracy accounting 
for nearly 62 percent of the total. The level is expected to 
reach 50 percent by the year 2000, it added. 
  A breakdown for 1992 showed Somalia had the highest rate, 
standing at 75.9 percent, followed by Sudan at 72.9 percent, 
Yemen at 61.5 percent, Egypt at 51.6 percent and Morocco at 50.5 
percent. 
  The report showed Lebanon and Jordan had the lowest rates, 
at 
19.9 percent each but it did not provide figures for the United 
Arab Emirates, Djibouti, Oman, Mauritania and Palestinians.

  [Text] Cairo, April 27 (AFP)--The PLO will seek the help of 
US Secretary of State Warren Christopher to press Israel to 
change its stance to the remaining hurdles in the self-rule 
talks, a senior Palestinian official said Wednesday [27 April]. 
  Faysal al-Husayni told reporters the Palestinian delegation 
here would inform Christopher of some of the issues obstructing 
the launch of Palestinian self-rule in the occupied Gaza Strip 
and the West Bank town of Jericho. 
  Christopher is expected here later Wednesday, after arriving 
in Riyadh earlier on the first leg of a Middle East tour 
designed to give fresh impetus to the peace process. 
  He would be told of the difficulties "so that he can try to 
convince the Israelis to change" some of their positions, 
al-Husayni. 
  Israeli and PLO delegations resumed their talks here 
Wednesday to try to iron out the remaining differences to seal 
an accord to launch self-rule. 
  Al-Husayni, who is the main PLO leader in the occupied 
territories, said although the issue of jurisdiction in the 
territories remained "the main obstacle" there had been a 
breakthrough. 
  He said both sides had agreed that the Israeli military 
controlling the three lateral roads linking Israel to the 
settlements in Gaza would have the right to question non-Israeli 
and non-Palestinian foreigners. 
  If the visitors were accused of a serious crime, then they 
would be handed over to Palestinian authorities, al-Husayni said. 
  But the two sides still disagree on who should have the 
right 
to try a Palestinian who attacked a settler, he said, adding he 
was not taking part in the talks. 
  He insisted the future Palestinian authorities should be 
given "full powers," saying incomplete powers would reduce their 
ability "to provide total security," in Gaza, where Jewish 
settlements will remain, and in Jericho. 
  Meanwhile in Jerusalem Palestinian leaders said they would 
urge Christopher to press Israel to ease its restrictions on the 
territories. 
  Sa'ib Urayqat, head of the Palestinian delegation to the 
Middle East peace talks in Washington, said the situation in the 
territories and the continued Israeli settlement would be "the 
main subject on the agenda" at a meeting planned with 
Christopher in East Jerusalem on Friday. 
  Christopher is expected to travel to Israel from Egypt on 
Thursday for talks with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin 
Friday before heading to Syria on Saturday. 
  Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres said on Tuesday it 
was 
"not impossible" that he would meet with PLO Chairman Yasir 
'Arafat on Thursday in Cairo, but it depended on how the talks 
progressed. 
  Arafat is expected here Wednesday overnight, an Egyptian 
official said.

  [Text] Cairo, 27 Apr (MENA)--Dr. Faysal al-Husayni, head of 
the advisory committee of the Palestinian delegation at the 
Washington peace talks, has emphasized that Israel's failure to 
grant the Palestinians full authority in Gaza and Jericho will 
result in ineffective control over the security situation. 
  In a statement today, he said: We must have a complete 
authority so that security will be achieved for everyone. 
  He expressed his hope that Palestinian President Yasir 
'Arafat's meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher will result in resolving the problems blocking the 
peace process. He also hoped that the U.S. side, as a cosponsor 
of the peace conference, will persuade the Israelis to change 
some of their policies on the negotiations. 
  Al-Husayni affirmed that his visit to Egypt is private and 
has nothing to do with the negotiations or with Palestinian 
President Yasir 'Arafat's visit to Cairo. 
  He announced that a meeting is expected to be held between 
representatives of the Palestinians inside the occupied 
territories and the PLO leadership in Tunis next week as part of 
continuous coordination in preparation for the next stage once 
an agreement to implement the Gaza-Jericho Accord is signed.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Al-Surani Urges Escalation of </F>
Confrontation With Israelis"] 
  [Text] Cairo, AL-HAYAH -- PLO Executive Committee Member 
Jamal al-Surani has reaffirmed "the need for the continuation of 
the intifadah in the occupied Palestinian territory and for the 
escalation of confrontational operations against the Israelis to 
force them to speed up their withdrawal." 
  Although the signing of the Gaza-Jericho agreement is 
imminent, al-Surani, who is opposed to the Declaration of 
Principles agreement, believes that "the Palestinian-Israeli 
negotiation sessions have exposed Israel's lies about its desire 
for peace and also exposed its continuing refusal to implement 
the UN resolutions and its violation of the fourth Geneva 
Convention." 
  In a statement to AL-HAYAH, al-Surani described the 
agreement 
between Fatah and the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) as "a 
step toward unification of the various Palestinian factions 
within the framework of the PLO, the sole legitimate 
representative of the Palestinian people." 
  He accused the U.S. Administration of "appeasing" Israel. He 
added that when the Palestinians "defend their rights they are 
accused of terrorism but the Israeli repression and murders are 
seen by them as security preccautions."

  [Text] Following sharp differences within the ranks of the 
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command 
[PFLP-GC], led by Ahmad Jibril, Mustafa Khamis, a PFLP-GC 
leader, today decided to split from the PFLP-GC and form what he 
called the Popular Front-General Islamic Command. 
  Mustafa Khamis, who was a member of the PFLP-GC Central 
Committee and member of the Palestine National Council, said 
today in Amman that he has decided, along with a group of the 
cadres operating in the territories, to split in the wake of 
severe financial and administrative corruption within PFLP-GC 
ranks. 
  The group that split from the PFLP-GC, led by Mustafa 
Khamis, 
accuses Ahmad Jibril and the PFLP-GC leadership of no longer 
being able to run the PFLP-GC, saying their fighting is not in 
the interest of the Palestinian people and its cause. 
  Khamis said Jibril's nationalist attitude and his arrogance 
have driven him to destroy the PFLP-GC, noting that the decision 
to split follows the failure of the PFLP-GC leaders to persuade 
Jibril to change his unilateral conduct during the meetings of 
the PFLP-GC Central Committee, held in Damascus last month. 
  The PFLP-GC was established in 1968 when Ahmad Jibril split, 
along with dozens of his supporters, from the Popular Front for 
the Liberation of Palestine, led by George Habash, against the 
background of personal competition between the two men over the 
leadership of the front. 
  The PFLP-GC today forms a part of the Damascus-based 
Palestinian opposition factions.

  [Excerpt] Cairo--Damascus--AL-ITTIHAD, News Agencies--Arab 
sources in Cairo have told AL-ITTIHAD that a reconciliatory 
meeting will be held soon between PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat and 
officials of the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, which has 
recently proposed a truce with Israel if the latter withdraws 
from territories occupied in 1967 and removes the settlements. 
  The sources welcomed 'Arafat's planned urgent visit to 
Jordan 
next week to meet for the first time with Hamas leaders, 
foremost of whom are Muhammad Nazzal and Ibrahim Ghawshah and to 
clear the way for a complete reconciliation between the PLO and 
the movement. 
  Hamas yesterday reiterated its denial of reports that it 
recognizes Israel's right to exist, but stressed its readiness 
to conclude a truce with Israel if it agrees to withdraw from 
the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and Jerusalem; remove the 
settlements; evacuate the settlers; and hold general elections 
for the Palestinian people to elect their leaders and 
representatives. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] What is taking place between Palestine President 
Yasir 'Arafat and the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas? This 
question is being posed in light of the reported contacts 
between the two parties, especially after Hamas' pledge to Yasir 
'Arafat to name him president if he voices commitment to 
implement Islamic law. 
  Hamas' pledge seems to have been taken seriously by Yasir 
'Arafat, who unhesitatingly held contacts with this movement's 
leaders in Gaza through Muslim Brotherhood leaders in Egypt to 
ask them to meet him in Cairo after his meeting with Israeli 
Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin. 
  Hamas' pledge, however, was not taken seriously by the other 
Palestinian rejectionist factions that are allied with Hamas 
under the Alliance of Palestinian Forces. [passage omitted] 
  The Palestinian president has prepared a complete file for 
the Cairo meeting. The file primarily addresses the situation 
in Gaza under the autonomy and spells out foundations for the 
relationship between the Hamas movement and the self-rule 
authority. 
  SAWT AL-SHA'B has learned that 'Arafat will propose that 
Hamas take over the Gaza municipality in a preemptive attempt to 
prevent it from asking for half the seats of the self-rule.

circles. The news media misinterpreted both the interview and 
statement. Therefore, we deem it important to publish the 
following 21 April Hamas Political Bureau statement: 
  In the light of the political concept presented by the 
Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas; in the light of the various 
official and media reactions to what was said; and in the light 
of the statements made by the U.S. secretary of state and 
officials in the enemy government and other states, Hamas would 
like to emphasize the following: 
  1. Escalation of the brave popular resistance and 
continuation of jihad and military operations against the 
occupying enemy will be maintained as long as the Zionist 
occupation of our blessed Palestinian land is continuing and 
until our usurped Palestinian soil has been fully liberated from 
the sea to the river. 
  The Hamas Movement believes that the so-called settlement 
negotiations currently taking place between the PLO leadership 
and the Zionist enemy are doomed to failure because they are 
based on consecrating injustice, aggression, and occupation, and 
held under Zionist hegemony and arrogance and official Arab and 
Palestinian weakness. These negotiations are a submission and 
capitulation to the Zionist and U.S. terms and dictates and 
conflict with our patient people's will and struggling forces. 
Hamas also reiterates its clear rejection of the flimsy 
self-rule. 
  3. Hamas has presented its political concept through its 
Political Bureau's statement as well as the statements made by 
the head of the Political Bureau. These statements were 
unequivocally clear. However, some news media disseminated them 
in a mutilated and incomplete manner, suggesting that there is 
some sort of change in Hamas' policy, programs, and concept of 
the conflict with the occupying enemy. Some even went so far as 
to interpret the Movement's statements in their own way, 
claiming that Hamas proposes peace with the occupying Zionists, 
recognizes the usurping Zionist enemy, and similar wrong 
utterances and interpretations. 
  4. The Hamas Movement's concept as presented to the sons of 
our people and their struggling forces calls for: 
  A. The unconditional withdrawal of the Zionist occupation 
forces from the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and Jerusalem. 
  B. The dismantlement and removal of settlements and the 
evacuation of settlers from the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and 
Jerusalem. 
  C. General free legislative elections for the Palestinian 
people inside and outside the occupied territories in order to 
enable them to elect their leadership and true representatives. 
Only this elected and legitimate leadership will be authorized 
to express our people's will and aspirations. It alone can 
decide all the subsequent steps of our conflict with the 
occupiers. 
  5. Hamas explained through the statements of the chairman of 
its Political Bureau that if the Hamas Movement and its 
political program win the confidence of our Palestinian people 
in general elections, Hamas will then express our people's will 
and implement its program for the sake of pooling our people's 
efforts and forces and unifying their ranks for the liberation 
of all of their territory and holy shrines. If the outcome of 
the elections is different, Hamas will then respect the opinion 
of the majority, adhere to their constants and programs, and 
seek to accomplish them and express their opinion with full 
freedom and vigor. 
  6. The above-mentioned statements did not include what some 
tried to circulate as a Hamas recognition of the usurping 
Zionist entity, acceptance of Security Council Resolution 242, 
or relinquishment of Hamas' program and genuine Islamic 
constants which consider Palestine an Islamic land which should 
not be ceded, relinquished, or bargained over. 
  Finally, this is Hamas' concept, which was strongly and 
clearly presented from the position of its escalating jihad. It 
appeals to all the sons of our struggling Palestinian people and 
influential forces to rally around this political concept and 
join hands to implement it on the ground. The Hamas Movement, 
which expresses the people's will and the pulse of the living 
Palestinian, Arab, and Islamic masses, stresses that it will 
continue its jihad and valiant resistance of the unjust Zionist 
occupation, along with all the faithful sons of our people, on 
the path of victory and liberation.

  [Excerpts] Hamas terrorists are threatening to carry out a 
wave of attacks and kidnappings if all Hamas [Islamic Resistance 
Movement] prisoners are not released from jail. The threat came 
in a leaflet claiming responsibility for last week's murder of 
Israeli soldier Shahar Simhoni. The leaflet carries a photocopy 
of Simhoni's ID card. Meanwhile, arrests are continuing in the 
Janin area, of Hamas members connected to the Hadera bombing. 
More on these developments from reporter Alan Ben-'Ami: 
  [Ben-'Ami] The Hamas leaflet distributed in the Gaza Strip 
says that members of 'Izz-al-Dan al-Qassam's Squad No. 6 
kidnapped and killed soldier Shahar Simhoni last week. 
According to the leaflet, which reproduced the soldier's ID 
card and driver's license, the terrorists passed themselves off 
as Jews, grabbed Simhoni, who was on his way to his girlfriend 
from his Army base, and after a short struggle, killed him. 
[passage omitted] 
  The leaflet is addressed to Prime Minister Rabin and demands 
that he immediately release all Hamas prisoners, especially the 
Hamas leader Shaykh Ahmad Yasin and Hamas members captured in 
recent weeks. If not, the leaflet warns, the killing or 
kidnapping of Israelis will continue. The threats are coming 
against the backdrop of a major crack down on Hamas by security 
forces. [passage omitted]

  [Text] AL-SHA'B has learned that Israel has prepared a plan 
to assassinate Hamas leaders in response to the hostile 
operations Hamas mujahidin have carried out inside the occupied 
territories that have killed and wounded scores of Israelis 
during the past two weeks. 
  The Israeli security services, military intelligence, and 
Mosad last week approved the final plan, which consists of 
several phases. The first phase envisages the assassination of 
200 Hamas leaders while the second phase envisages the 
assassination of 400 leaders. The assassination operations will 
target Hamas leaders in Britain, Jordan, Sudan, Lebanon and 
other countries. New methods will be used in these operations. 
  The Israeli military intelligence service has agreed to 
finance a number of Jewish terrorist organizations that will 
carry out these operations. 
  Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has approved the plan. 
The Israeli Foreign Ministry has asked its embassies abroad to 
gather the necessary information to carry out the 
assassinations. The Israeli Embassy in Cairo has been asked to 
gather information on the movements of Hamas leaders in 
neighboring Arab countries.

  [Text] Abu-Muhammad Mustafa, one of the officials of the 
Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, in Damascus, said that last 
Friday's [22 April] agreement between representatives of the 
Fatah Hawks and the Hamas 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam battalions in 
Gaza is not the beginning of a political agreement between the 
two sides. The Hamas official said the agreement was signed to 
resolve some of the differences on outstanding issues between 
the military wings of the two movements and to lay the 
foundations of dialogue to resolve possible future problems and 
prevent a resort to arms and starting an internecine Palestinian 
fighting. 
  Abu-Muhammad Mustafa pointed out that this is not the first 
time that such an agreement has been signed between the Fatah 
hawks and the al-Qassam battalions, adding that the political 
stands and the basic differences on the Oslo-Cairo agreement and 
the stands on the occupation and the Palestinian cause are still 
the same between Hamas and Fatah. 
  As for the reported joint seminar between Hamas and Fatah, 
which was held at the Islamic University in Gaza recently, 
Mustafa said that the seminar was just an open debate among 
students and that differences between the two debating sides 
continued unabated. He added: This has nothing to do with 
allegations that Hamas has begun to retreat from its principled 
stands.

States on disarmament issue. An official spokesman in a 
statement in New Delhi said that the talks between the two sides 
on the issue have been open and well-known. He said London has 
been chosen as the venue only for logistical reasons as it is 
convenient to both the sides. He said the Indian team of 
experts is led by the former Indian ambassador, Mr. N. Krishnan, 
as he has wide experience of multilateral diplomacy. 
  Meanwhile, the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] has asked the 
government to explain reported Indo-U.S. talks in London. The 
party spokesman, Mr. K.L. Sharma, said in New Delhi today that 
his party is of the view that a resolution should be passed by 
Parliament on NPT [Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty], stating 
that the country will not compromise on the issue.

evidence that arms training was imparted in a neighboring 
country to some of the accused in last year's Bombay blasts. A 
CBI spokesman said that two people have been arrested in this 
connection. The bureau is said to have gathered more material 
against the prime accused in this case. It is alleged that the 
two arrested were sent abroad for training in handling 
explosives by another accused who is absconding. The CBI is 
reported to have made the breakthrough while checking the

a cosmetic exercise intended to perpetuate illegal occupation. 
In response to a query by newsmen in New Delhi, the External 
Affairs Ministry spokesman said Islamabad has denied democratic 
rights and violated the human rights of the people of the 
region, which was occupied by it through aggression four decades 
ago. The spokesman said the recurring violence including 
sectarian strifes speak of the political alienation, economic 
deprivation, and backwardness of the people in the region.

  [Text] Textile exports constitute 35 percent of the 
country's total exports. The industry is now gearing itself to 
boosting exports still further. 
  [Begin unidentified correspondent recording] India's textile 
output has gone up from 25,045 million square meters in 1992-93 
to 25,942 million square meters in 1993-94. This is excluding 
the production in the khadi, wool, and silk sectors. The steep 
rise in production is mainly attributed to an increase in output 
by the handloom and power loom sectors which employs 140 lakhs 
of people specially in the rural sector. The capital [words 
indistinct] sector contributes only 10 percent of the total 
production and employs just about 10 lakh people. According to 
the annual report of the Textiles Ministry, textile exports 
constitute as much as 35 percent of India's total exports. 
Textiles have, thus, emerged as one of the highest foreign 
exchange earner for the country crossing the 19,000 crore rupee 
mark during 1993-94 -- an increase of 34 percent over 1992-93.

  [Text] Algiers, 27 Apr, KUNA--Algerian Foreign Affairs 
Minister Mohamed Salah Dembri today expressed his "astonishment 
that there was some confusion" over his country's position on 
the crisis resulting from the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. He said 
that the position adopted from the beginning "was clear and 
demanded the immediate withdrawal of Iraqi troops from Kuwaiti 
territory." 
  He added, in an interview with the Kuwaiti news agency, that 
the visit of Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad, first deputy prime minister 
and foreign minister, to Algeria "was an opportunity to remove 
the misunderstanding resulting from the crisis caused by the 
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait." 
  The Algerian foreign minister also called for the rebuilding 
of Arab solidarity in accordance with principles that take into 
account the national character of every people of the Arab 
nation and that respect the sovereignty of states and their 
existing borders. Dembri also said: "The Arab world needs 
solidarity to confront external challenges." He indicated that 
this did not mean ignoring the foundations and principles on 
which such a solidarity had to be built. He added, in this 
respect, that his talks with Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad, Kuwaiti 
first deputy prime minister and foreign minister, dealt with 
ways to achieve an effective Arab solidarity that would be 
beneficial to the Arab nation. 
  Regarding the future of Kuwaiti-Algerian relations in the 
light of Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad's visit, Dembri said that the 
talks between the two sides "will give a big boost to bilateral 
relations." He added that the relations between the two 
countries "are solid and good but they need to be somewhat 
revived in a number of areas."

  [Text] The State of Kuwait and Algeria tonight stressed the 
need for preparing the conditions that would restore security 
and stability in all the countries of the Gulf region, including 
an affirmation to honor the independence and sovereignty of the 
State of Kuwait and guarantee its borders, which had been 
confirmed by international legitimacy. This was stated in a 
joint Kuwaiti-Algerian statement that also included an emphasis 
on the need for adherence to the implementation of UN Security 
Council resolutions pertaining to the settlement of the issue of 
Kuwaiti and other POW's so that the collective conscience of the 
Arab peoples would finally leave behind that tragedy. 
  The statement, issued on the occasion of a visit to Algeria 
that ended today by Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad, first deputy prime 
minister and foreign minister, in appreciation of Algeria's 
clear and firm stance vis-a-vis the sovereignty and independence 
of the State of Kuwait. 
  The statement said that the two sides exchanged views 
regarding Arab and international issues of mutual concern. The 
statement expressed Algeria and Kuwait's commitment to the Arab 
League and UN charters; honoring the territorial integrity and 
regional security of states; equality of sovereignty; 
inadmissibility of gaining territory by force; settlement of 
disputes by peaceful means, and adherence to the principles of 
international legitimacy and the precepts of international law. 
  The first deputy prime minister and foreign minister left 
Algeria tonight for Mauritania. 
  In another development, Algerian Foreign Affairs Minister 
Mohamed Salah Dembri expressed his amazement tonight at the 
misunderstanding about his country's stance regarding the crisis 
that resulted from the Iraqi invasion of the State of Kuwait. 
He pointed out that the Algerian stance had been clear from the 
outset; it demanded an immediate withdrawal of Iraqi forces from 
Kuwait. 
  The Algerian minister of foreign affairs called for the 
reestablishment of Arab solidarity on bases that would take into 
consideration the national identity of all the peoples of the 
Arab nation and honor the sovereignty of states and their 
existing borders.

  [Text] Rabat, Apr. 27 (MAP) -- An Algerian authorized 
source said that the Algerian ambassador to Spain was speaking 
on behalf of his country and voicing Algeria's standpoint when 
he addressed a conference held recently in Madrid on the peace 
plan in the Sahara. 
  The statement came following the response of Morocco to the 
Algerian diplomat's "vigorous and deluding" statements before 
the conference and after a Moroccan official source wondered 
whether the Algerian diplomat was expressing his own standpoint 
vis-a-vis the situation in the Sahara or that of his country 
which repeatedly claimed it was observing restraint regarding 
the Sahara issue. 
  The ambassador had said that the present deadlock in the 
Sahara issue was due to "the hesitations of one of the two 
sides...while the Polisario [Popular Front for the Liberation of 
Saquia El Hamra and Rio de Oro] has always showed a high spirit 
of maturity". 
  The Algerian source, quoted by the official news agency 
"APS" 
said the Algerian ambassador is plenipotentiary and was 
attending the conference as Algeria's official representative.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Our colleague Saliha Bahri 
asked Foreign Minister Mohamed Salah Dembri yesterday what he 
thought about chances for transforming the Arab Maghreb Union 
into a regional bloc and about its relations with the European 
Union. 
  [Begin Dembri recording] In theory this is an easy option 
for 
us. However, when it comes to practice it is necessary to first 
build the Maghreb bloc up as a strong economic group, a matter 
which has yet to be achieved. The European Community has had 30 
years of experience behind it before it was possible to realize 
a strong economy and abolish borders between European countries. 
As far as we are concerned we are still at the beginning; it is 
necessary for us now to examine all aspects of trade: individual 
movement and everything else. We have to build the Maghreb 
house first before one can talk as a bloc with any other bloc in 
the world. [end recording]

  [Text] The information and study workshop on the prospects 
of the Algerian economy, organized by the presidency and 
premiership and attended by some members of the government and 
principal economic and social partners ended this evening. 
  Prime Minister Mokdad Sifi revealed during the information 
and study workshop that the government's plan would be announced 
soon. Sifi said the plan would revolve around controlling 
unemployment and inflation and the revitalization of some 
priority sectors. 
  [Begin Sifi recording] The government will work, through its 
plan of action, which will be announced soon, to, first, resume 
economic growth so it will be possible to combat unemployment in 
a better way and facilitate the participation of all the 
economic and social operators in that; second, to ensure an 
expansion in growth by selecting the sectors that should be 
given priority, such as housing, agriculture, small and medium 
institutions, and the hydrocarbons sector. The growth and 
promotion of these sectors will contribute toward raising [words 
indistinct] our economy and improving returns through effective 
utilization, and (?provision) and competition in external 
markets. Third, the government will work to restore the 
tenacity of external and internal financial balance and 
stabilization of the national currency. Fourth, it will work to 
ease the effects of the social cost of the program of stability 
and economic advancement and improve the effectiveness of 
protecting the more deprived social groups [end recording].

  [Excerpt] The information and study workshop on the 
prospects for the Algerian economy, which was set up by the 
presidency and government and in which members of the government 
and the main social and economic operators participated, has 
issued its recommendations. In the recommendations, the

comprehensive and coherent program for institutional reforms and 
restructuring, in order to free the initiative of economic 
operators and reintroduce a market economy mechanism. 
  The participants also recommended that as soon as possible 
work should begin on drawing up a coherent program to 
restructure the public sector in order to increase output; work 
should also begin on the reorganization and diversification of 
the activities of banks. They also recommended the 
reintroduction of a system that would encourage partnership. 
  Concerning the social sphere, the participants stressed the 
importance of bolstering the program for social and economic 
development, as part of the embodiment of social justice, 
through the consolidation of the national system of social 
security and the protection of the purchasing power of those 
strata who are below the poverty line. They also stressed the 
importance of bolstering dialogue and national solidarity.

  [Text] Baghdad, 26 Apr (INA) -- Official talks between Iraq 
and the UN Special Commission, which lasted three days, ended 
today. A joint statement was issued on the high-level talks 
held in Baghdad between Iraq and the UN Special Commission and 
the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]. 
  The statement said the talks are a continuation of the 
discussions started in July 1993 in Baghdad and New York. The 
statement further noted the tangible progress made since the 
recent round of high-level talks in New York 14-19 March 1994. 
The statement also expressed the appreciation of the Special 
Commission and the IAEA for Iraq's prompt, positive response to 
their demands, thus facilitating effective and active 
inspection. This has also significantly contributed to 
establishing long-term monitoring and verification as called for 
by Security Council resolutions. 
  The Special Commission and the IAEA also welcomed Iraq's 
commitment to continue to cooperate with them. The Special 
Commission and the IAEA reiterated their commitment to Iraq's 
legitimate interests pertaining to sovereignty, independence, 
security, and dignity in line with the UN Charter. 
  The two sides also asserted their commitment to continuing 
and intensifying efforts to reach their common objective, noting 
that Iraq has adopted all measures stipulated in Paragraph 22 of 
Resolution 687 of 1991. 
  In a related development, Rolf Ekeus, chairman of the UN 
Special Commission, held a news conference, in which he reviewed 
the talks he held with Iraqi officials 24-26 April. Ekeus 
pointed out that great progress has been made in technical 
aspects related to the implementation of Security Council 
resolutions. 
  He praised Iraq's cooperation with UN committees, expressing 
his happiness for these positive developments that were 
reflected in the joint statement issued at the conclusion of the 
talks today. 
  Answering an INA question about the substance of the report 
he will submit to the Security Council this week, Ekeus said the 
joint statement issued today will be an official document of the 
Security Council, in addition to the nominal report that will be 
presented by the Special Commission and the IAEA. 
  Ekeus added that the Special Commission will inform the 
Security Council of the progress made thus far, pointing out 
that a decision to lift the embargo is a political one and made 
by the Security Council. 
  Ekeus further asserted that the meetings held between Iraq 
and the Special Commission since last July have made tangible 
progress and have enhanced mutual confidence on both sides. 
  Ekeus and his delegation left Baghdad following a three-day 
visit to Iraq.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary from the "Spotlight on the News" </F>
program] 
  [Text] At the conclusion of his visit to Baghdad, Rolf 
Ekeus said the question of lifting the blockade imposed on Iraq 
is a political decision. This is not the first time the head of 
the UN Special Commission has made such a declaration. For some 
time, Mr. Ekeus has been talking about matters that go beyond 
the technical aspects of arms, disarmament, and other issues 
related to weapons of mass destruction. When weapons-related 
issues were still pending between Iraq and the Special 
Commission, particularly questions pertaining to ways of 
implementing relevant UN Security Council resolution, Ekeus and 
other UN officials emphasized in their statements the need for 
Iraq to respect the resolutions of the international legitimacy, 
particularly the UN Security Council resolutions. They used to 
say the decision to lift the sanctions depends on Iraq's 
implementation of those resolutions, which they admit to be 
negative, illegitimate, and unjust. When Iraq declared that it 
had fully complied with the UN Security Council resolutions and 
that there is no justification for the continued blockade, they 
started raising issues which in themselves are considered a 
circumvention of those resolutions and their objectives. 
  To appease their masters in Washington, it is absolutely 
clear that sometimes they play with words and sometimes they 
play for time to prolong the blockade. Therefore, saying that 
the blockade question depends on the UN Security Council 
political plans exposes the last pretext in a series of pretexts 
they have been using throughout the stages of the blockade. 
This also proves that the matter has nothing to do with Iraq's 
implementation of UN Security Council resolutions. As Ekeus 
bluntly put it, the question needs a political decision. 
  Talk about a political decision is no surprise for Iraq. In 
fact, it perhaps surprises some quarters which (?used to 
believe) that Iraq's implementation of UN Security Council 
resolutions means paving the way for lifting the blockade. 
However, as proved by recent events, the matter is not like 
that. As Ekeus says, the decision is political rather than 
technical, as it should be. 
  At any rate, great Iraq has managed to expose all the faces 
hiding behind false, glimmering slogans. Iraq is now capable of 
exposing them completely to prove to the entire world that all 
their words on legitimacy are false.

  [Text] To the esteemed AL-HAYAH newspaper: 
  Subject: Explanation 
  Greetings: 
  In its issue No. 11,386 dated 20 April 1994, your newspaper 
published an article by Kamiran Qurrah Daghi under the headline 
"Barzani Sets Three Conditions for Acceptance of Damascus 
Invitation." In order to shed light and explain the truth about 
what was published in the article, we ask that the following 
explanation be published: 
  1. Our party's relations with Syria are strong. They are 
based on mutual respect and understanding. We attach great 
importance to these relations. 
  2. His Excellency President Hafiz al-Asad has kindly 
received Mr. Barzani during all his visits to Syria. Mr. 
Barzani has strong and close relations with President Hafiz 
al-Asad. 
  3. We would like to explain that Barzani would not set 
conditions for visiting Syria. He regards Syria as his own 
country. The doors of Damascus have always been and still are 
open and there is no need for friends to set conditions among 
themselves. 
  Please accept our regards. 
  Signed: The Central Public Relations Office

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Jalal Talabani, leader of the </F>
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, by Sami Kulayb in Paris; date not 
given] 
  [Text] Jalal Talabani, leader of the Patriotic Union of 
Kurdistan [PUK], has not ruled out the establishment of 
relations between the Kurds and Israel sometime in the future 
when most of the Arabs have done so. However, he rejected the 
possibility of renewing a dialogue with Baghdad and criticized 
Saddam Husayn's regime, describing him as a dictator. 
  In an interview with AL-SAFIR, Talabani said that the 
Turkish 
military operations in northern Iraq are meant for domestic 
propaganda. 
  Talabani's remarks came the day after his arrival in Paris, 
where he will meet for the first time with the leaders of the 
French right in addition to President Francois Mitterrand, who 
stressed in their meeting one year ago that he supports the 
proposal for a Kurdish federation within Iraq's territory. 
  On relations with Israel, Talabani said: "We have not found 
any Israeli who has penetrated Iraq's Kurdistan. No Israeli 
delegation has visited us. But I want to ask why it is all 
right for the Israelis to visit Cairo, the capital of the Arab 
nation and the citadel of Arabism, but they are not allowed to 
visit part of Arab Iraq or part of Iraq's Kurdistan? Why is it 
permissible for them to hold talks with the Arab leaders but 
they are not allowed to come to us?" 
  He continued: "I want to ask with more frankness. We, the 
Kurds, have been historically known to support the Palestinian 
people in their just cause and are more than proud of this 
support. But are we more Palestinian than the Palestinians 
themselves? Do we care more for the Palestinian cause than Mr. 
Yasir 'Arafat? He met, talked, and even embraced Israeli Prime 
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin. Why shouldn't a Kurd do the same? Are 
we more royalists than the king?" 
  Talabani added: "It is true that there are no relations now. 
But I would not be surprised if such relations were established 
one day. As we know, relations between a number of Arab 
countries and Israel have become semi-normal. Iraq has informed 
Israel in secret memos on relations of its desire to establish 
ties with the Hebrew state, and Kurdistan is part of Iraq. Why 
shouldn't the Kurds have the right to do so when the Arab 
countries are competing to establish ties with Israel and when 
King Hassan II, chairman of the Arab Jerusalem Committee, 
receives Israeli ministers?" 
  He said: "The talk about Israeli penetration is primarily 
based on the Iraqi regime's lies and on the appearance of an 
organization for the Jews of Kurdistan in Israel. The Jews who 
went from Kurdistan to the Hebrew state carried with them good 
memories of the hospitable and tolerant Kurdish people, who 
treated them humanely and with dignity. Kurdistan's Jews have 
established a society to defend the Kurdish people and 
strengthen ties with Kurdistan. This society has carried out 
some activities in Israel. There has been talk about the 
existence of a relationship. I personally do not rule out the 
establishment of a relationship in the future. I do not think 
that this will be strange, since the Arab brothers have 
legalized the relationship with Israel." 
  Regarding how relations with Israel will benefit the Kurdish 
people, Talabani said: "It is in the best interests of the 
Kurds to establish relations with everyone and not be hostile 
toward anyone in the world because, as the proverb says, one 
thousand friends are a little but one enemy is too much. If the 
Arab brothers are accusing us of establishing ties with Israel, 
then they are establishing better ones. If a Syrian-Israeli 
peace settlement is achieved on the basis of a comprehensive 
peace in return for a full withdrawal, then we will welcome it, 
especially if Syria retrieves the Golan. Kurdish-Israeli 
relations will begin then." 
  Talking about "the impossible dialogue" with the Iraqi 
regime 
and about some Kurds' desire to establish some form of autonomy, 
he said: "The Kurdish people are committed to the Iraqi 
people's national unity. We are committed to Iraqi unity, but 
we want a democratic, federal Iraq. We believe that 
dictatorship poses a great danger to Iraq's independence, unity, 
and existence. Therefore, we want to change the dictatorial 
regime and replace it with a democratic one." 
  The PUK leader added: "It was the current Iraqi regime 
that ruled out the dialogue. It refused to introduce any 
democratic changes and submit to the will of the Iraqi people, 
both Arabs and Kurds. It also rejected the Kurdish people's 
minimum demands. The (regime) became very arrogant for several 
days following the Russian military coup, and this prompted it 
to give a negative reply to the simplest demands presented by 
brother Mas'ud Barzani, leader of the negotiating Kurdish 
delegation in Baghdad. The delegation had no choice but to 
return and the negotiations were aborted." 
  He said: "I personally have much experience in negotiating 
with successive Iraqi Governments. I have been negotiating with 
them since 1963. I believe that the experience proves that 
negotiating with a dictatorial regime is futile and will not 
lead to results. Therefore, I personally rule out negotiations 
with a dictatorial government. This is not just my personal 
opinion, but also that of the Kurdistan Front, which believes 
that action is necessary for the sake of a democratic Iraq. 
This is also the view of the unified Iraqi National Congress." 
  Asked to comment on reports published in some newspapers 
citing Turkish officials who stressed that Iraq is ready to 
resume a dialogue with the Kurds, Talabani said: "I believe 
that this is a new Iraqi lie to deceive the Turks because the 
Turkish Government likes to get rid of the Kurdish problem in 
Iraq's Kurdistan. It fears the presence of a federal Kurdish 
entity and consequently fears the internationalization of the 
Kurdish problem. It wants a solution to be found within the 
Iraqi framework. Hence, the Iraqi Government is deceiving the 
Turks and dropping hints of its desire to resume the dialogue. 
But I ask: If (Baghdad) is serious, why doesn't it do so 
directly?" 
  Talabani expressed doubts about Ankara's information on the 
losses of the Kurdistan Workers Party [PKK], against whom Turkey 
is undertaking military operations in northern Iraq. He said: 
"The Turkish figures that are always given about Iraq's 
Kurdistan are exaggerated. There are no people, villages, or 
human beings in the area invaded by the Turkish forces. If 
there are some PKK members there, they have most probably come 
from Turkish territories, not to set up permanent bases but to 
flee from the Turks." 
  He stressed: "There are no permanent PKK bases all along the 
Iraqi-Turkish border. The `joined' Kurdish forces [Talabani's 
PUK and Barzani's Kurdistan Democratic Party] can control the 
border areas. The Turkish Government's objectives in its 
operations are to use them for domestic propaganda." 
  Regarding the reason for the West's nonrecognition of the 
political institutions in Iraq's Kurdistan, such as the 
parliament and the government, Talabani said: "The reason is 
that the Kurds themselves are not asking the West to recognize 
the Kurdish government because they do not want an independent 
government and they have not announced one. They only announced 
federal measures within a unified Iraqi entity. A federation 
does not mean division of the state's institutions, and an 
example of this is Germany, Belgium, Canada, the United States, 
Pakistan, and India. However, the West has recognized the 
elections and democracy in Iraq's Kurdistan." 
  On the nature of relations with Syria, the Kurdish official 
said: "Syria has always been a shelter for free Kurds and free 
Iraqis. Since the corrective movement launched by President 
Hafiz al-Asad, Syria has been backing the struggle of the 
Kurdish people and the Iraqi opposition forces to establish 
democracy in Iraq, end the dictatorship, and build a plural and 
democratic Iraq. Syria has always been and continues to be 
friendly with the Kurds." He denied that Mas'ud Barzani had set 
conditions for visiting Damascus. He added: "Actually, my 
information is the opposite of what the newspaper AL-HAYAH has 
published. When I was in Syria, I met with a representative of 
brother Mas'ud Barzani, who made a request explaining Barzani's 
desire to visit Damascus without prior conditions." 
  Reviewing the ties linking the Kurds with the United States, 
Talabani pointed out that the "U.S. position toward the Kurdish 
cause is friendly. The democratic administration under 
President Clinton and Vice President Gore has repeatedly 
reiterated its commitment to protecting the Kurdish people from 
the dictatorial aggression, helping them rebuild their region, 
and getting involved in our issues in general. Even if we take 
the U.S. stance regarding the Turkish Kurds, we will find that 
in his latest message to the Turkish prime minister Clinton 
urged her to find a political and peaceful solution to the 
Kurdish issue in Turkey. Thus, the U.S. attitude toward us is 
friendly and positive." 
  Asked if the Kurds want the United States to overthrow the 
Iraqi regime, Talabani said: "As an Iraqi Kurd, I cannot accept 
the dictatorial regime's being removed by foreign hands. Had 
the Gulf war resulted in the downfall of the regime, we would 
have been happy, but I believe that the main task lies with the 
Iraqi people." 
  Talabani talked about his current European tour. He 
explained that before visiting France he had met in Germany with 
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, leaders of political parties, and 
leaders of the Bundestag, particularly the chairman and leading 
figures of the Foreign Relations Committee. In Greece he met 
with leaders of PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist Movement]. 
  On his current visit to France, he said: "Tomorrow we will 
meet with French Defense Minister Francois Leotard, party 
leaders, and French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe. On Friday we 
will meet with President Mitterrand. They will be the first 
meetings with the French right, and the atmosphere surrounding 
the meetings seems to be one of understanding and amity. As for 
the meeting with Leotard, we will express condolences over the 
death of the French military official who was killed in the U.S. 
helicopter incident. Leotard was and still is sympathetic to our 
cause. I repeat that France remains committed to its position 
regarding the need for Iraq to implement all the UN resolutions. 
President Mitterrand has responded positively to our federation 
proposal. He is the one who proposed such a solution for 
countries with multiethnic groups." 
  In another development, Talabani announced that he will 
participate in a seminar entitled "The United Nations 
Declaration on the Rights of Minorities and the Middle East 
Peoples" to be held in Cairo 12-14 May. It will be attended by 
UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali and a number of Arab figures, 
including Minister Walid Junblatt, Minh al-Sulh, Karim 
Paqraduni, Ghassan Salamah, Karim Muruwwah, and Muna 'Ubayd from 
Lebanon. It will also be attended by Ait Ahmed, leader of the 
Algerian Socialist Forces Front, and leaders of the rebellion in 
southern Sudan.

  [Text] U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's visit 
to Egypt to promote the peace process coincides with the 
progress made in the Palestinian-Israeli talks on the 
implementation of Palestinian self-rule in Gaza and Jericho. 
The visit reflects a U.S. appreciation of Egypt and President 
Husni Mubarak for his intensive efforts to achieve an honorable 
peace providing the firm bases for Egyptian and other Arab 
peoples to build themselves and assert their existence in this 
changing world. 
  Christopher's visit to the region reflects U.S. awareness of 
the importance of intervention on the level of the U.S. 
secretary of state at this phase in the peace process to prevent 
any setback that will return the talks to the whirlpool of 
Israeli obstacles aimed at extorting the Palestinians and 
turning the two self-rule areas into a prison without barbed 
wire. The visit reflects a U.S. desire for the success of the 
peace process to bypass the stage of wars to a new Middle East 
enjoying peace, security, cooperation, and prosperity for all 
the region's peoples. 
  We believe the U.S. secretary of state must convince the 
Israelis to respect their pledges and signatures on the 
September agreement in Washington. He must also convince them 
that the only guarantee for their security is a just and 
comprehensive peace through which the Arabs will have their 
occupied lands restored and the Palestinians will regain all 
their legitimate rights. Israel must realize that regional 
peace and security are not its demand alone. Concern for peace 
and stability must be reflected in a clear commitment that the 
world can see and that the Middle East peoples can experience. 
The Middle East peoples are in dire need of peace and stability 
in order to devote themselves to development. 
  Mubarak's Egypt has played a vanguard role for the sake of 
peace and stability in this part of the world. It continues to 
play this key role for peace, which will provide common security 
for all parties. President Mubarak has called on all parties to 
work to continue the peace process. 
  Undoubtedly, accelerating the implementation of the 
Gaza-Jericho agreement will be a sign of hope in a region whose 
people have lived in despair and disappointment for a long time, 
especially the Palestinian people. Speeding up the 
implementation of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement will give 
credibility to the process of a comprehensive peace and 
encourage the other Arab parties to sit at the negotiating table. 
  It is a fact that President Husni Mubarak is playing an 
important role in pushing forward the peace process on all 
tracks. Egypt is the biggest Arab country and has the first 
experience of a permanent peace with Israel. 
  All parties must realize that Egypt is not prepared to put 
any pressure on the Palestinian leadership to compel it to adopt 
unacceptable stances or to approve unsatisfactory proposals. 
Egypt is not a mediator. It does not play a neutral role 
between the Arabs and Israel. Egypt's stance is part of the 
Arab stance on interests and rights, including the Palestinian 
people's interests and rights. 
  We are certain that the ship of peace will sail again. The 
difficult and complicated negotiations taking place in Cairo and 
President Husni Mubarak's continuing contacts with all parties 
will ultimately persuade Israel to respond to the Palestinian 
demands. Egypt is hosting the talks on the implementation of the 
Gaza-Jericho accord and President Mubarak is sponsoring these 
talks. In view of President Mubarak's personal role for the 
sake of a just, comprehensive, and lasting peace, we say that 
the peace we desire must include the Palestinians, Syria, 
Lebanon, and Jordan and must return to them their legitimate 
rights.

  [Text] Cairo, 27 Apr (MENA)--U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher arrived in Cairo this evening as part of his current 
tour of the region. He was met at Cairo Airport by Foreign 
Minister 'Amr Musa and U.S. Embassy staff. 
  As soon as U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher 
arrived, a ceremony was held at Cairo airport to deliver 
vehicles, given as the first part of American assistance to the 
Palestinian police force. The vehicles were received by Dr. 
Nabil Sha'th, adviser to Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, in 
the presence of Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa and senior 
Palestinian Embassy staff. 
  In a speech, Musa said: Christopher's presence gives us a 
chance to welcome him, especially at this important stage in 
which we are working to end the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations 
on the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho Agreement. 
  Musa said he was happy to be joining the U.S. secretary of 
state and representatives of the Palestinian people in 
celebrating the delivery of the first American contribution to 
the Palestinian police. The celebration indicates that all 
parties are ready to put the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of 
Principles into practice, he said. 
  U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher said he was glad 
to return to Egypt. I am looking forward to meeting President 
Mubarak again and also 'Amr Musa, Palestinian President Yasir 
'Arafat, and Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, he said. 
  He added that he was happy with the arrival of the first 
American contribution to the Palestinian police. The police, he 
said, will be a basic factor in implementing the Declaration of 
Principles. He said the United States is sure of this and will 
help the Palestinian police force perform its duty in Gaza and 
Jericho. 
  Christopher pointed out that the American assistance 
includes 
200 vehicles and spare parts, 100 pickup trucks, 50 personnel 
carriers, and 50 bulldozers. He said the rest of the equipment 
will arrive in the next few weeks. 
  Christopher said the donation, which also includes 2,300 
blankets and 1,800 pair of shoes, shows that the implementation 
is taking place. It is also a good sign that the Israelis and 
the Palestinians are moving ahead with the negotiations to reach 
agreement for peace in the region, he said. 
  During the implementation, Christopher noted, the tragedy 
can 
be forgotten and the creation of a new climate based on mutual 
respect can be started. This step will be the response to 
attempts by the extremists to harm peace, he added. 
  He thanked the Israeli Government for giving the donor 
states 
the chance to provide assistance to the Palestinian police. 
  He also thanked and hailed President Husni Mubarak for his 
important role in the peace process and the implementation of 
the Declaration of Principles. 
  In conclusion, Christopher said he hoped the Palestinians 
would use the equipment to achieve its objective of bringing 
about peace and reconciliation in the region. 
  Dr. Nabil Sha'th delivered a speech. On behalf of the PLO 
and the Palestinian police, he thanked the United States and 
Christopher for their valuable assistance. He noted the 
importance of that assistance for implementing the agreement, 
which is expected to be signed soon, on the entry of the police 
force to Gaza and Jericho. 
  Sha'th said: We will remember 13 September 1993, the day the 
Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles was signed, and 
will remember that two weeks later, the U.S. President invited 
the donor states to meet. Those states pledged to provide $2.4 
billion to the Palestinian authority to implement the agreement. 
  He added: As a representative of the Palestinians, who for a 
long time lacked peace and freedom, I would like to emphasize 
that these vehicles will be used to ensure security for the 
Palestinians so that they can work in peace to build their 
homeland, of which they are proud. 
  He stressed that the Palestinian police will respect human 
rights, freedom, and democracy, and will serve as a factor of 
peace and stability to ensure the well-being of the Palestinian 
people. 
  Sha'th thanked President Mubarak and the Egyptian people for 
Egypt's great support for the Palestinian people, backing of the 
Palestinian negotiators, and help in deploying the Palestinian 
police in Gaza and Jericho. 
  He also thanked Norway for its role and the U.S. secretary 
of 
state, who came to deliver the assistance. He stressed the 
Palestinians' pledge to achieve the peace that serves the 
Palestinian people and the peoples of the region.

  [Text] Cairo, 28 Apr (MENA)-- U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher has announced that the Palestinian-Israeli 
negotiations on autonomy in Gaza and Jericho are making progress 
and that the two sides are closer to reaching an agreement. 
  The secretary of state said: I want to affirm our wish to 
complete this stage so that we can embark on implementing the 
agreement and then administer daily affairs in Gaza and Jericho 
for the first time. This can be compared with what is happening 
in South Africa. 
  These remarks came during a joint news conference 
Christopher 
and Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat held following their 
meeting with Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa today. 
  Christopher stated that those who wanted to hamper and ruin 
the peace march had no better alternatives. During my meeting 
with Chairman 'Arafat, I found common ground for moving ahead, 
he said. 
  Noting the talks' progress, Christopher said that this was 
manifested with the arrival of the first group of vehicles 
donated by his country to the Palestinian police force. He 
pointed out that this is only part of what the donor states have 
promised to offer. 
  I congratulate Chairman 'Arafat and the negotiating 
Palestinian delegation on what they have achieved on the basic 
points. This demonstrates their determination to get over the 
tragic incidents and shows the need to implement the agreement, 
Christopher said. 
  He added: We want to emphasize again the need to move ahead. 
The reports I have received from the concerned parties over the 
past six months have encouraged me. 
  Christopher reiterated the U.S. determination to encourage 
the parties to proceed to the next stage. We want to be here 
and to do what we can to get closer to the implementation stage, 
he said. 
  Speaking at the news conference, 'Arafat expressed the hope 
of reaching an agreement within the framework of the 
comprehensive settlement of the Middle East crisis on the 
various tracks. We hope we will overcome the obstacles that 
still hinder a Palestinian-Israeli agreement, 'Arafat said. 
  'Arafat expressed his appreciation of the role President 
Mubarak and Egypt played to support the peace process. He also 
thanked U.S. President Bill Clinton for assisting in the 
implementation of the Declaration of Principles and aiding the 
Palestinian police. 
  At the end of the joint news conference, 'Arafat affirmed 
that the Palestinians will be fully prepared to sign an 
agreement on implementing the Gaza-Jericho Agreement once the 
obstacles hindering it are eliminated. He added that it is the 
other side that is responsible for placing these obstacles.

  [Text] Cairo, 28 Apr (MENA)--Commenting on the 
Egyptian-U.S. talks, Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa said the talks 
dealt with several issues, including all tracks of the Middle 
East peace process, regional problems--such as Somalia and 
Bosnia, and bilateral relations. 
  In his statement following his meeting today with Israeli 
Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, Musa said the final measures to 
implement the Gaza-Jericho Agreement will be signed the first 
week of May. 
  Regarding the situation in Bosnia, he stated that Egypt 
supports NATO's recent measures to strike the Serbs if they 
continue their aggression or if they violate the decision to 
withdraw their forces 20 km from Gorazde. 
  Musa added that the formation of the United Nations 
committee 
on Bosnia-Herzegovina marks a step forward, because questions 
had arisen concerning some of the proposals made by some of the 
mediators. 
  He said President Mubarak has sent Ambassador Badr Hammam, 
assistant foreign minister for Arab and Middle East affairs, to 
Yemen to contact the Yemeni president and vice president. 
Hammam is carrying a message from President Mubarak following 
yesterday's contact made by the president with the Yemeni 
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and Vice President 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid.

  [Text] Cairo, 27 Apr (MENA)--AL-AHRAM newspaper says that 
developments in the Bosnia-Herzegovina issue indicate the 
failure of the U.S. plan to increase pressure on the Serbs by 
normalizing relations between the Muslims and Croats and pushing 
them into a confederation which the Serbs would later be 
compelled to join. 
  In today's editorial, the paper notes that since an 
agreement 
was signed between the Muslims and Croats in Washington in 
March, fighting between the Muslims and Serbs has intensified, 
and it seems obvious that NATO's ability to intervene militarily 
against the Bosnian Serbs has limitations. 
  The paper says the Russian Federation foiled the first 
ultimatum by deploying its forces on the hills above Sarajevo, 
while the Serbs foiled the second ultimatum by signing an accord 
with the United Nations on a withdrawal from Gorazde. Before 
they withdrew, however, they burned most of the city. 
  The paper concludes that it is necessary for the 
international community, represented by the United Nations and 
the European Union, to agree on a formula acceptable to the 
three parties by which they will return to the negotiating table 
in order to produce a cease-fire and then unconditionally 
discuss solutions. 
  The newspaper expresses its belief that the arena must not 
be 
left for the United States to use as a guinea pig to test its 
relations with the Russian Federation.

<F P=106> [From the "Questions" column by 'Abdallah Nassar] </F>
  [Text] Lee Hamilton, chairman of the U.S. Congress' Foreign 
Relations Committee, has announced that economic aid to Egypt 
will continue for one, two, or perhaps three more years. His 
opinion reflects debates going on in several U.S. circles 
concerning foreign aid to various countries. Because of 
pressure, the volume of foreign aid is being reduced annually, 
because U.S. taxpayers believe the aid serves no purpose now 
that the Cold War is over. 
  The United States can choose any policy it wants. Any 
attempts to influence it will not work because they care about 
the interests of the U.S. citizen. However, why did the 
announcement that aid to Egypt will stop in three years at most 
coincide with U.S. attempts to block Egyptian exports to U.S. 
markets? Egypt is capable of continuing its economic reform 
measures without U.S. aid. If we shed some light on this issue, 
we find that the United States, its employees, and companies 
have greatly benefited from this aid and even shared some of it. 
  How can we prepare ourselves for the end of this aid? We 
can, if we mobilize our enormous capabilities in various areas, 
improve our products, encourage Egyptians to invest their money 
and work harder, and grant preferential treatment by the state 
to Egyptian investors, citizens, and businessmen. 
  No country in the world can exist without cooperating with 
other countries, but this cooperation must be governed by rules 
and conditions, so that no party may benefit at the expense of 
another and no party may impose arbitrary terms or restrictions, 
and this is what we should expect from now on. Aid does not 
build a homeland, and Egypt is rich in resources and people.

  [Text] Cairo, 27 Apr (MENA)--President Husni Mubarak has 
asked the Yemeni leaders to exercise self-restraint and to avoid 
intensifying the problems in Yemen. He warned of the gravity of 
any escalation in the situation and any acts of violence. 
  Mubarak made this statement during two telephone calls he 
received this afternoon from Yemeni Vice President 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid and from Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih. He told 
Salih and al-Bid that confrontation between Yemeni brothers and 
forces will be detrimental to Yemeni interests and will threaten 
the country's security, stability, and unity of its sons. He 
called for settling their differences through dialogue and 
reason.

  [Text] On 20 April Labor Party leader Ibrahim Shukri handed 
Dr. Yusuf Wali, agriculture minister and secretary general of 
the National Democratic Party [NDP], a statement by the 
opposition parties and political forces. 
  The leaders of the opposition parties issued a statement on 
14 April concerning a political dialogue and asked the Labor 
Party leader to hand it to the NDP secretary general. 
  The statement says that political reform should be at the 
top 
of the agenda of a national dialogue and that all opposition 
forces should take part in preparations for this dialogue. The 
statement also calls for guarantees for fair elections and for 
revising laws obstructing the establishment of a democratic 
society, noting that terrorism will recede if democracy is 
achieved. 
  The statement also calls for a solution to the economic and 
social problems that beset ordinary people. 
  The following is the text of this statement: 
  A. When President Husni Mubarak issued a call for national 
dialogue at a session of the People's Assembly marking Mubarak's 
reelection for a third term, leaders of the opposition parties 
and political forces met and unanimously agreed to welcome a 
dialogue in principle, viewing the president's call as an answer 
to their repeated requests for cooperation and solidarity in 
finding the best solutions to the country's problems. The 
opposition leaders also examined the principles ensuring the 
seriousness of the dialogue and issued a statement including 
their views, which they presented to the president and released 
to the public. 
  B. In later exchanges between the NDP and opposition 
representatives, it became clear that the NDP agrees with most 
of the opposition's statement. 
  C. This was followed by quite a long period in which there 
were no exchanges and no particular steps were taken to prepare 
for the conference on a national dialogue. 
  D. Following a recent meeting of the NDP General 
Secretariat, which was chaired by President Mubarak, Information 
Minister Safwat al-Sharif announced a decision by the NDP 
Secretariat to invite a 25-member committee to prepare for the 
national dialogue conference. 
  E. On 14 April, leaders of the opposition parties and 
political forces who signed the aforesaid agreement met to look 
into the developments since their previous meeting, and reached 
the following conclusions: 
  1. The conferees, once again, state their commitment to the 
statement they issued at their last meeting, in which they 
stressed that political reform should be the top priority of a 
national dialogue. They also stressed the importance of the 
participation of all the opposition forces in preparing for the 
dialogue. There is a particular need to guarantee the probity 
of elections and to reconsider laws that impede the 
establishment of democracy. Democracy will weaken the wave of 
terror and help resolve the country's economic and social 
problems that haunt the lives of ordinary citizens. 
  2. A dialogue can only be conducted in a spirit of equality. 
Therefore, the opposition leaders request to have a part in 
naming the members of the preparatory committee for the national 
dialogue conference. They believe that the rules governing the 
dialogue should be formulated in agreement among the 
participants in that dialogue. 
  3. The signatories of this statement wish to note the 
importance of providing a healthy atmosphere for national 
dialogue through the following steps: 
  a. Ending the arbitrary measures that are being taken 
against journalists of opposition papers; and 
  b. Refraining from passing laws or making decisions that 
interfere with national political life, such as the amendment of 
the village mayors' law and the extension of the state of 
emergency by three years. The latter move, made only two months 
before the expiration of the Emergency Law, could have been 
delayed until the national dialogue had its say. 
  We implore Almighty God to guide us all toward what is best 
for the nation.

  [Text] Cairo, April 27 (AFP) -- The Moslem militant group 
al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah on Wednesday [27 April] vowed to kill 
President Husni Mubarak to avenge the death of its military 
leader. Police said they gunned down 32-year-old Tal'at Yasin 
Hammam, head of the group's armed wing, and six other militants 
in a dawn raid Monday on his apartment in northeast Cairo. 
  In a statement sent to AFP, al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah (the 
Islamic Group) warned Mubarak, saying: "Your head, as well as 
those of hundreds of torturers in the Interior (Ministry), will 
not be enough for our revenge." 
  It mocked the government's effectiveness in fighting 
militants, saying Hammam used to plan his operations from a 
building located "a few meters (yards) from the general 
intelligence offices" in central Cairo. Hammam "dealt one blow 
after the other" to the regime, the statement said. 
  The Egyptian authorities said Hammam was, among other 
things, 
in charge of sending statements to foreign press agencies. 
  Around 380 have been killed in the two years since the 
militants launched their violent campaign to topple Mubarak and 
install an Iranian-style Islamic republic. The dead include 134 
policemen and 135 militants. 
  Experts said the killing of Hammam will be only a temporary 
setback to the fundamentalists.

<F P=106> [Interview with Crown Prince Hasan Bin-Talal by Ashraf </F>
Khalil in Amman; date not given] 
  [Text] [Khalil] What is your evaluation of the peace 
process? 
  [Hasan] There have been various international moves and 
initiatives following the Oslo accord between the PLO and 
Israel. There are reports of a visit by U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher--the more important cosponsor of the 
conference--to the region to promote the talks. To tell you the 
truth, I know nothing about the visit. Regarding my evaluation 
of the peace process, I believe that the current circumstances 
resemble a no peace, no war situation. It looks like a 
stalemate. We have not changed positions. I ask: What is the 
use of the talks if they do not produce positive progress on all 
tracks? The complete opposite is happening on the ground of 
reality. Let me mention the Hebron massacre and the feelings of 
sorrow and frustration it has left in the Arab world. 
Naturally, this barbaric massacre against innocent people is a 
reflection of the failure of the talks. It in turn pushes the 
parties to the point of despair. That paves the way for more 
unjustified acts of violence. Here, I want to return to the 
basic issue, the issue of mankind and mankind's view of peace 
and its benefits and gains. We are not ones to thwart the peace 
process but we are searching for just and comprehensive peace in 
accordance with UN resolutions. 
  [Khalil] What is your view of the region's future in light 
of the negotiating process? Israel's ultimate aim is the 
establishment of a regional bloc or a Middle East regime that 
will redraw the landscape of the region. I believe, Your 
Highness, you agree with me that Jordan is a sine qua non for 
the Middle East market project in its first stage, the so-called 
triangle, according to a book by Israeli Foreign Minister 
Shim'on Peres. 
  [Hasan] Yes, Peres says we need economic projects and 
commercial dealings to protect peace. My response is that peace 
will not thrive on forced relations between two different 
economies when the rich side gets richer at the expense of the 
economy of the poor. I believe Peres' projects need a clear 
perspective. Our perspective in Jordan is that we should 
shoulder our Arab responsibility within an Arab framework. Any 
talk about a Middle East market that will achieve Israel's 
economic ambitions is premature. We have not achieved peace 
yet. So on what basis should I ask the Arab citizen to change 
his feelings, agree to deal with it, and establish economic and 
trade activity with it? This is a complicated process. Israel 
must first of all prove its desire to live in peace by giving 
the land back to its owners. It must cease its inhumane 
violations and excesses against the inhabitants of the occupied 
territories. It must refrain from attempting to erase the 
character of Arab towns and Islamic holy shrines. In fact, we 
have many reasons to reject this so-called Middle East market. 
I wish to point out that it is not clear yet what the term 
Middle East means. 
  So how can we form an economic grouping in a region with no 
defined features, at least from the geographical point of view? 
According to our concept, we ought to establish an Arab 
grouping. We have the bonds of blood, religion, history, and a 
common future. The agreements and recommendations of the summit 
conference held under the aegis of the Arab League since 1957 
approved the establishment of a Common Arab market. What 
remains is implementation, which is not being done due to lack 
of political will. You are aware of the pressure put on the 
Arab League to end the boycott [of Israel]. However, in its 
recent 101st session the Arab League reaffirmed its adherence to 
the boycott decisions as one of the best bargaining cards in the 
hands of the Arab negotiator. The Arab negotiator will not give 
up this bargaining chip under any pressure or at any price. 
  [Khalil] In view of what you said about the Arab League and 
your ambition to revive joint Arab cooperation agreements to 
face Western-Zionist schemes to redraw the region's map, where 
do you stand on the secretary general's call for reconciliation? 
  [Hasan] When that initiative saw the light in March last 
year, I met with Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid. There was a notably 
genuine desire among Arab intellectuals and writers to get over 
the Gulf ordeal and welcome undertakings to patch up the schism 
in Arab relations. The people as well are eager to restore the 
unity of the nation's ranks. When it comes to states, only 13 
out of 23 member states have consented to the initiative. Some 
states had reservations about it due to bilateral problems, 
although I am convinced that this is more reason for brothers to 
get together and discuss matters rather than wait. Just as 
Husayn said in an appeal to the nation's leaders, let us emerge 
from the dark tunnel. 
  [Khalil] Since we are talking about mending fences, how far 
have bilateral ties between Egypt and Jordan gone, particularly 
in view of Egyptian Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif Sidqi's expected 
visit to Jordan on 26 April? 
  [Hasan] The visit is in the context of the meetings of the 
Egyptian-Jordanian joint higher committee. We hope these 
meetings will contribute to restoring normalcy to bilateral ties 
between the two fraternal countries. 
  [Khalil] What about ties with the Gulf states? 
  [Hasan] We still believe that patience is our only hope for 
an opening up or, in other words, for dialogue and for avoiding 
hazards. 
  [Khalil] My last question is about the democratic experience 
and the distance you have covered so far. Did the recent acts 
of violence have an impact on that experience? 
  [Hasan] First of all, violence exists everywhere in the 
world, primarily in the states that claim to have fully 
democratic state institutions. Violence does not bother us in 
effect, it enhances our belief in the need to further 
consolidate our democratic practices. I admit, however, that 
our democratic experience is not fully mature.

<F P=106> [Report by JORDAN TIMES staff reporter Nirmin Murad] </F>
  [Text] Amman--After the U.S. announced its acceptance of a 
Jordanian proposal to ease the naval blockade against the port 
of al-'Aqabah, the Kingdom will await final agreement and 
implementation before renewing its full participation in the 
peace process, a senior Jordanian official said Wednesday [27 
April]. 
  Information Minister Jawad al-'Anani told the JORDAN TIMES 
that the kindgom is satisfied with the U.S. move, which he said, 
had "removed a major obstacle and has allowed the Kingdom to 
shift its position towards renewed participation in the peace 
process." 
  But he pointed out that the U.S.-Jordan agreement over the 
naval blockade in al'Aqabah was not "100 per cent complete" and 
that the Kingdom was awaiting final agreement and implementation 
before announcing its return to the Middle East peace 
negotiations. 
  At a joint conference that followed a meeting in London with 
His Majesty King Husayn, U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher announced that "subject to fine tuning the U.S. 
accepted a Jordanian proposal on a new land-based system of 
verifying compliance with international sanctions against Iraq 
without the need to intercept ships at midsea. 
  The acceptance came after months of deliberations which 
prompted the King to link Jordan's return to the peace talks 
with Israel to an end to the sea-based inspections of all 
Jordan-bound vessels by a U.S.-led naval force which Washington 
calls the Multinational Interception [as published] Force (MIF). 
  Dr. al-'Anani said that the U.S.' positive response is an 
indication of the "unfolding realisation of Jordan's important 
role," another issue that Jordan tied to the renewal of Jordan's 
participation in the talks. 
  King Husayn had told representatives of Security Council 
member countries that he believed the pressure on Jordan with 
the al-'Aqabah siege was humiliting to Jordan and indicated a 
lack of appreciation for Jordan's positive role in promoting 
peace in the region. 
  Dr. al-'Anani, who said that the problem with the U.S. could 
have been averted earlier, said that this latest move will 
contribute positively to the "credibility of U.S. policies" in 
the Kingdom. 
  Politicians and analysts interviewed by the JORDAN TIMES 
agreed that the Jordan-U.S. agreement has placed Jordan back 
into its traditionally important role in the Middle East peace 
process. 
  Jordan had stuck to its conditions out of total frustration 
with the U.S. on two occasion where Arabs and Israelis were 
meeting for multilateral negotiations, Jordan sent only 
low-level observers to attend the meetings and held back "active 
participation." 
  In the multilateral meeting on water, held for the first 
time 
in a Gulf state, Oman, Jordan balanced its need to underline 
that it was not going to play a spoiler role by boycotting the 
meeting with a reiteration to its ultimatum on al-'Aqabah. The 
Jordanian observer to that meeting managed to delay the issuing 
of recommendations at the end of that meeting for several hours 
before allowing the meeting to conclude for the sake of 
maintaining Amman's relations with Muscat. 
  Observers believe that having been awarded a dignified way 
out of what was threatening to escalate into an open 
confrontation with Washington, Jordan is now willing to take an 
even more active role in the negotiating process with Israel, 
especially that a problem that arose earlier this month between 
the two countries over the present of Hamas representatives in 
Jordan seemed to have been settled. 
  "We are now willing to sign agreements on all individual 
items on the Jordan-Israeli agenda and to participate in the 
multilateral talks on all fronts discussing all issues at one 
time in the hope that these negotiations will lead to a peace 
treaty," Prime Minister 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali told reporters 
this week, stressing that such a treaty cannot be reached any 
other way.

  [Text] Sources close to the Hamas Movement in Jordan have 
said that approximately 90 members and supporters of the 
movement in Jordan have been arrested and that some Muslim 
Brotherhood members, who support Hamas, or who consider 
themselves to be part of Hamas were also arrested. 
  The sources stated that these measures were taken after the 
passports of Muhammad Nazzal and Ibrahim Ghawshah, Hamas 
officials in Jordan, were confiscated even though their 
passports are valid for five years. The sources added that such 
an action is unconstitutional. 
  In a telephone conversation with AL-BILAD, Interior Minister 
Salamah Hammad refused to comment on the passport issue 
considering it an issue not worth discussing. On the issue of 
arrests, Hammad said: I have not heard about it, and I have no 
idea about what you are saying.

  [Text] Amman--AL-QABAS--Reliable Jordanian sources have 
stressed that the recent fire at the Forte Grand Hotel, formerly 
the Plaza Hotel, one of Amman's most luxurious hotels, was 
premeditated. The sources say competent Jordanian authorities 
are currently conducting large-scale investigations into the 
causes of the fire and the parties behind it. 
  The fire resulted in the death of an Italian tourist and the 
injury of many visitors, including Iraqi Major General Hisham 
'Ata Hajjaj, who is in charge of many sports posts in Iraq. 
  Information available to the same sources says that in 
addition to his sports activities, Maj. Gen. Hisham 'Ata Hajjaj 
is the air traffic control director. He is referred to by the 
Iraqi media and press as staff major general, air traffic

  [Excerpts] A Chinese parliamentary delegation led by Wang 
Zhaoguo, vice chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese 
People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC], today held 
parliamentary talks with Senate Speaker Ahmad al-Lawzi and a 
number of Senate members. The delegation also visited the Royal 
Jordanian Scientific Society. 
  The visit seeks to examine prospects of Jordanian-Chinese 
cooperation in various fields. Senate Speaker Ahmad al-Lawzi 
noted the importance of this visit because Jordan believes that 
China's role in and concern about achieving peace in the region 
is one of the most important bases on which we depend. This is 
especially so since China is one of the five permanent UN 
Security Council members. Therefore, it is directly concerned 
with implementing UN Security Council resolutions that deal with 
the Middle East issue. 
  Al-Lawzi called on the Chinese friends to exercise their 
real 
role based on the international legitimacy to solve the 
Arab-Israeli conflict. He noted the firmness of 
Jordanian-Chinese political, cultural, and economic relations as 
a result of both countries' eagerness to develop and reinforce 
these relations. 
  The head of the Chinese delegation said that the Chinese 
leadership and people greatly appreciate His Majesty King 
Husayn's balanced stands on various international issues. 
[passage omitted] 
  The Chinese delegation arrived in Amman this morning on a 
four-day visit to Jordan. The delegation was received by a 
number of Senate members, the Parliament's secretary general, 
and the Chinese ambassador in Amman.

  [Excerpt] Tahir al-Masri, speaker of the House of 
Representatives, has received at Parliament Wang Zhaoguo, vice 
chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC], and members of the 
accompanying delegation. 
  The Chinese delegation had previously held a series of 
contacts and meetings that are summed up in the following report 
by our correspondent: 
  During his meeting with CPPCC Vice Chairman Wang Zhaoguo and 
members of the accompanying delegation, House of Representatives 
Speaker Tahir al-Masri said that Jordan, under the leadership of 
His Majesty King Husayn, believes that real peace should be 
founded on bases that secure its continuation and 
comprehensiveness and recognize the legitimate rights of the 
Palestinians and of all the peoples in the region. 
  Al-Masri stressed that Israel has not shown real interest in 
the peace process nor has it demonstrated a commitment to the 
resolutions of international legitimacy and a willingness to 
save the region from the whirlpool of conflict by ending the 
causes of this conflict. 
  Al-Masri said that the House of Representatives decided to 
send parliamentary delegations to a number of countries, 
including China, to explain the dimensions of the siege imposed 
on the Port of al-'Aqabah and the harm it is causing to the 
Jordanian people. 
  For his part, Zhaoguo said that the Chinese people highly 
appreciate Jordan's accomplishments under the leadership of His 
Majesty King Husayn in all fields, especially in terms of 
entrenching a democratic regime inspired from Jordan's own 
characteristics and genuine Jordanian traditions. 
  Zhaoguo explained that the Middle East problem is one of the 
oldest and most complex international conflicts. He noted that 
China believes that this problem can only be solved through 
peaceful negotiations in order to reach a solution that secures 
the national rights of the Palestinian people--a peace based on 
the principles and related resolutions of international 
legitimacy. 
  Zhaoguo said he will convey to the Chinese Parliament and 
Government the suffering of the Jordanian people as a result of 
al-'Aqabah siege. He stressed that the Chinese people deeply 
sympathize with the Jordanian people, hoping that this problem 
will be solved soon. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Tehran, April 26, IRNA -- Iranian Ambassador to 
Lebanon, Homayun 'Alizadeh, met Lebanese Foreign Minister Faris 
Buwayz in Beirut last night to formally discuss the case of the 
four Iranian hostages kidnapped by the Christian Phalangists in

Motevasellian, embassy worker Taqi Rastgar Moqaddam and 
photographer of the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) Kazem 
Akhawan, who were kidnapped on the Beirut-Tripoli road are the 
longest held hostages. 
  Sources related to the Zionist regime insisted that the 
Iranian nationals were killed at Phalangist Militia Chief Samir 
Ja'ja's headquarters. 
  Ja'ja' said he was not responsible for kidnapping of the 
Iranian diplomats. 
  Despite Iran's repeated requests the case of the four 
Iranian 
has remained unresolved.

  [Text] Judge Munir Hunayn, the investigator into the 
assassination of Engineer Dani Sham'un and his family, this 
afternoon questioned Dr. Samir Ja'ja' and checked his testimony 
against those given by other people in custody. The judge also 
listened to a number of witnesses, but the judicial sources who 
reported this did not reveal any details. 
  Judge Hunayn and Judge Jozeph Furayhah, who is investigating 
the bombing of the Sayyidat al-Najat Church, this morning 
received in their offices at the Justice Palace lawyers for a 
number of detainees and petitions from their families. The 
judges agreed to some of the requests. 
  According to the judicial sources, Chief Public Prosecutor 
Judge Munif 'Uwaydat asked that the treatment of Dr. Ja'ja' be 
improved. 'Uwaydat pointed out, however, that Dr. Ja'ja is not 
being treated badly and that Justice Minister Bahij Tabbarah is 
taking care of this. 
  The sources said that the cases referred to the Judiciary 
Council are old files under investigation. Some of them are 
being examined by investigating judges and are automatically 
activated when new evidence appears. Other cases, including the 
assassination of Deputy Tony Franjiyah and his family, require 
the appointment of new investigating judges. The sources said 
the case involving the bombing of Minister Elie Hubayqah's car 
was dropped in accordance with the general amnesty. 
  Concerning the assassination of former Prime Minister Rashid 
Karami, the judicial sources said the case was referred to 
investigating Judge Walid Ghamrah and that there is nothing new. 
On the file of former President Rene Mu'awwad, the sources said 
that Judge Sa'id Mirza is the investigator into this file and 
that investigations have been continuing for three years. 
  Regarding the file of Major General Michel 'Awn, which 
includes his breach of state security and keeping state taxes 
and fees for himself, the judicial sources said the general 
amnesty law did not cover the financial part. They said that 
Judge Labib Zuwayn left the case about a year ago and that the 
security agencies are now appointing a judge to investigate this 
file. The sources said there is no request to extradite Michel 
'Awn because such a request cannot be made before an arrest 
warrant is issued by the investigating judge. The case is 
awaiting the appointment of an investigating judge and an 
extradition request is not appropriate at present. 
  On the assassination of Colonel Khalil Kan'an, the sources 
said that it is within the jurisdiction of the military court. 
Concerning the assassination of Dr. Ilyas al-Zayik, Beirut 
investigating Judge 'Abdallah Bitar today began questioning a 
number of people being held in connection with the case. The 
chief public prosecutor accused one of the detainees, Rafiq 
Ghalib Sa'adah, and will do so with anyone else the 
investigation may prove is an accomplice or perpetrator. 
  We have just received word that Beirut investigating Judge 
'Abdallah Bitar questioned the accused Rafiq Ghalib Sa'adah and 
issued a warrant for his arrest in connection with the murder of 
Dr. Ilyas al-Zayik in al-Ashrafiyah in 1990. The judge sent a 
judicial note to security authorities to conduct initial 
investigations to identify all perpetrators and accomplices.

  [Text] Lebanon was officially invited by the United States, 
Russia, and Egypt to take part in the Middle East multilateral 
talks on refugees scheduled to be held in Cairo on 10-12 May. 
The invitation was conveyed by the American, Russian, and 
Egyptian ambassadors to Ambassador Zafir al-Hasan, the Foreign 
Ministry secretary general, today. 
  The Egyptian ambassador said after the meeting that Lebanon 
should always take part in the Middle East peace negotiations 
because Lebanon is a principal, important, and effective party 
in the peace process. 
  The Russian ambassador expressed the conviction that Lebanon 
will take part in the multilateral negotiations, noting that 
Lebanon is entitled to choose the stance it likes. The Russian 
envoy said it would be in Lebanon's interest to take part in 
these negotiations. 
  The U.S. ambassador said that Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher is unlikely to visit Lebanon, adding that the 
ongoing talks could achieve progress. 
  Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz today received a written 
message from his Sudanese counterpart, Husayn Abu-Salih. The 
message was forwarded by the Sudanese ambassador to Lebanon. It 
contains the Sudanese Government's thanks to Minister Buwayz and 
the Lebanese Government for their support for Sudan during the 
Arab League Council's meetings in March, when Minister Buwayz 
backed a decision condemning plans to partition Sudan.

  [Text] The Lebanese Islamic and nationalist parties and 
forces have held an expanded meeting at Hizballah's Political 
Bureau premises to discuss developments in the Lebanese arena. 
The delegates discussed the political situation and public 
liberties resulting from the government's policy, which is aimed 
at repressing the honest voices and forces confronting the 
Zionist enemy and the U.S. schemes in the region. 
  Hizballah was represented at the meeting by the Political 
Bureau head al-Hajj Husayn al-Khalil, bureau member Abu-Sa'id 
al-Khansa, and deputies Muhammad Ra'd, Muhammad Funaysh, and 
Muhammad Yaghi. 
  The other parties were represented by Zahi al-Khatib for the 
Workers' League; Usamah Sa'd and Khalil al-Khalil for the 
Nasirite Popular Organization; Tawfiq Muhanna for the Syrian 
Social Nationalist Party--Higher Council; 'Ali al-Shaykh 'Ammar 
for the Islamic Group; Sa'dallah Mazra'ani for the Lebanese 
Communist Party; Mukhtar Haydar for the Communist Action 
Organization; Hamad Haydar for the Popular Committees and 
Associations Grouping; Munir al- Sayyad for the Nasirite 
Organization; Husayn Hamdan for the Arab Socialist Action Party; 
and Hasan Shalhah for the Union Party. 
  After the meeting, the delegates issued the following 
statement: 
  Out of their concern for political freedom; in defense of 
the 
Resistance's nationalist media and the freedom of expression 
through appropriate methods; in rejection of the government's 
repressive policy toward public liberties--a policy demonstrated 
in the suspension of some papers and television stations; 
bearing in mind the perpetration of the 13 September massacre 
against citizens who reject the Gaza-Jericho plan; recalling the 
ban on broadcasting all audiovisual newscasts and political 
programs; and out of their concern for the principle of freedom 
in Lebanon, the Lebanese Islamic and nationalist forces and 
parties held an expanded meeting, following which they issued 
this statement: 
  First, the Islamic and nationalist forces and parties 
strongly believe that the government's recent decision is a 
clear threat against political life in Lebanon. The 
government's decision circumvents the nationalist media, which 
support the peace, unity, and coexistence march, and the 
honorable Resistance, which seeks to liberate the usurped 
territories. This decision also paves the way for the Western 
media to infuse their sectarian and seditious poison and to 
propagate the imperialist policy against the Arab and Islamic 
nation and its central issues. 
  Second, as part of a destructive and grave social, 
economic, and political crisis created by exhausting the citizen 
with taxes and strangling the country with debts, the government 
decided to silence nationalist media to prevent them from 
exposing this policy, which seeks to hold the country's future 
to ransom. 
  Third, the delegates believe that the government's decision 
is meant to reward the radios that spread sedition. Instead of 
closing the radios that violated the covenant of honor, the 
government equated them with the national media. This reveals 
the government's deceptive policy, lack of concern for the 
country's interests, and failure to curb the sedition that 
almost destroyed peace, stability, and national unity. 
  Fourth, The responsibility for the chaos that overwhelmed 
the 
media in the past should be shouldered by the government, which 
deliberately failed to issue a clear media law that would 
consolidate national unity and step up resistance of the Zionist 
enemy occupying our land. 
  Fifth, the delegates urge the honorable Chamber of Deputies 
to shoulder its historic responsibility under the current 
delicate circumstances to safeguard the freedom of expression 
stipulated in the National Accord. The delegates call on the 
Chamber, in its capacity as the legislative authority that must 
reflect the people's will and interests, to play its role in 
confronting the government's policy, which is strangling 
liberties. 
  Sixth, the media, whether audio, visual, or written, have 
one 
mission. So we urge the free Lebanese press to unify ranks in 
defense of information and political liberties in Lebanon and to 
undermine the government's acts of discrimination and division. 
  After the meeting, the delegates decided to form committees 
that will be entrusted with contacting press, trade union, 
parliamentary, and political functionaries to follow up on the 
move rejecting the government's unfair course.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by </F>
Me'ir Einstein -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Einstein] Mr. Peres, what issues in the Cairo 
talks still remain open? 
  [Peres] We will see what issues are finalized by this 
afternoon. There are still several issues that must be dealt 
with. 
  [Einstein] Do you believe you will be able to reach 
understandings during your visit to Cairo today? 
  [Peres] This is our intention, but it is impossible to know 
what the other side's position will be: What they will 
emphasize and what they will insist on. This is a negotiations 
process, and in every such process we can know at most only 50 
percent -- namely, our own positions. 
  [Einstein] What will we insist on? 
  [Peres] We will insist on what we have insisted on 
throughout the process -- namely, the security issues. We will 
not make any compromises on anything relating to human life. I 
want to add here, however, something that everybody understands: 
It is impossible to eradicate violence by force alone. Like 
elsewhere in the world, we need a carrot in addition to the 
stick. In order to wipe out the raging terrorism in Israel, we 
must use both the carrot and the stick. [passage omitted] 
  [Einstein] It is generally assessed that the agreement will 
be signed next week. Do you share this assessment? 
  [Peres] Unfortunately I cannot predict the date. I can tell 
you with conviction, however, that we will do our utmost to 
navigate the ship safely to shore -- namely, to finalize the 
negotiations. If it takes one more week, that will be good; if 
an additional week will be necessary, however, so be it. 
Sometimes there is a trade-off [last word in English] between 
the time element and the contents. There is no doubt, however, 
that the issue has matured, and I believe we should sign the 
agreement. When I spoke about the carrot, I was not referring 
to mere tactics. I believe that only a new reality can change 
the old reality -- that is, when the Palestinians finally have a 
territorial address and possess various powers. The 
Palestinians will have a piece of reality in their possession. 
Without this, I fear that the overcrowded conditions, the 
overpopulation, and mounting hate will feed the growing violence 
and terrorism. 
  [Einstein] Mr. Peres, do you believe that an agreement with 
the Palestinians will facilitate the talks with Syria? 
  [Peres] We have never made the two issues conditional on 
each other. The truth is, however, that if we finalize the 
agreement with the Palestinians, we will be freer to deal with 
the Syrian issue, although we have never put this issue off. 
Incidentally, wrapping things up with the Palestinians will be 
no excuse for making uncalled for concessions on the Syrian 
track. We want to attain a comprehensive agreement, and this 
must clearly include Syria as well. We regard our future with 
Syria not in terms of warfare but in terms of peace and 
understanding in all spheres. 
  [Einstein] Does Christopher's visit mean a possible 
breakthrough with Syria? 
  [Peres] The United States is constantly trying to lower the 
expectations. It is right in doing so, because it, too, does 
not know exactly what to expect from Damascus. I have no doubts 
that Warren Christopher will exert supreme efforts to pave the 
way for the negotiations. So far, however, Damascus is behaving 
stubbornly. It appears to have a strategy of peace, but the 
winds of peace are still not blowing from that direction.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Foreign Minister Peres told 
the Knesset plenum that when the Palestinians are granted 
autonomy, it will practically be independence. 
  Referring to the Camp David accords, Peres said when the 
Likud Prime Minister Menahem Begin offered autonomy to all the 
Palestinian residents of Judaea and Samaria, the Likud should 
have known that autonomy is 80 percent, if not 90 percent, 
independence. Autonomy is not a reduction in their authority 
but basically sovereignty minus responsibility for two things: 
security and foreign relations. Peres later said we will let 
the Palestinians run their lives with honor and independence, 
again with the two exceptions. 
  The foreign minister was responding to a motion for the 
agenda by Likud Knesset Member Moshe Qatzav, who accused Peres 
of rushing the negotiations with the PLO at the expense of 
Israeli interests.

  [Text] The Knesset today rejected the draft bills 
presented by NRP [National Religious Party] Knesset Member [MK] 
Yitzhaq Levi and Likud MK 'Uzi Landau on the Golan Heights by a 
majority of 57 to 47 votes. The draft bills sought to make any 
territorial concessions on the Golan Heights conditional on a 
parliamentary majority of at least 80 MK's. Our Knesset affairs 
correspondent Tamar Asalem reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Asalem] MK Yitzhaq Levi presented his 
draft bill against the background of two remarks by the prime 
minister. The first asserted that a national referendum would 
be held prior to any withdrawal from the Golan Heights while the 
second referred to the evacuation of settlements. Levi said 
there was no official government decision on holding a national 
referendum and that Rabin could not be counted on to keep his 
promises. 
  [Levi] The prime minister is the greatest retractor in 
Israel. No one goes back on his remarks as much as the prime 
minister. He immediately retracts every statement he makes. 
Every time he speaks he changes his mind. Therefore, I believe 
that he is worthy of this title. 
  [Asalem] MK 'Uzi Landau continued the personal attack on 
Rabin. Landau caused a furor in the plenum when he read excerpts 
from 'Ezer Weizman's book about Rabin's collapse during his 
tenure as chief of staff and about how the collapse was passed 
off as a case of nicotine poisoning. The prime minister, Landau 
said, could not take pressure. 
  [Landau] One cannot have confidence in him. He fails to 
keep his promises not because he does not want to -- he does -- 
but because he simply cannot. The prime minister breaks under 
pressure and has been suffering from chronic nicotine poisoning 
since 23 May 1967. 
  [Asalem] Against this background, Landau said, the prime 
minister's promises could not be counted upon and the issue must 
be anchored in law. Minister Moshe Shahal, who replied on 
behalf of the government, called the personal attacks on Rabin 
ridiculous and said that these were the last-ditch efforts of 
pathetic individuals who had lost their political bearings. 
Moving on to the issue itself, Shahal said that the Golan 
Heights had never been consecrated by politicians, had not been 
occupied because it was holy land, and Israel's history had not 
begun on its basalt rocks. Shahal taunted opposition MK's, who 
have sought on several occasions to pass similar bills, by 
saying that in such historic times sitting on the opposition 
benches was not only frustrating but even tedious. The 
coalition's efforts to muster all possible support proved 
itself. SHAS [Torah Observing Sephardim] also voted against the 
bills, which were defeated by a majority of 57 votes. [end 
recording] 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1200 GMT on 27 April 
reports: "The Knesset plenum today passed the preliminary 
reading of MK Yehoshu'a Matza's bill limiting the prime minister 
to two portfolios, in addition to the premiership portfolio. 
The coalition failed to muster a majority and the plenum passed 
the bill with a majority of 26 versus 22. 
  "The Knesset also passed the preliminary hearing of a bill 
submitted by David Mena' and Limor Livnat from the Likud to 
apply state audit to the Histadrut Labor Union and its 
institutions. The bill passed with a majority of 20 versus 
one."]

  [Text] The Likud, NRP [National Religious Party], Tzomet, 
and YI'UD [Independent and Democratic Israel] have submitted 
motions of no confidence in the government that will be debated 
by the Knesset on 2 May. 
  Our correspondent Yo'el Nir reports that the Likud explains 
its motion by what it terms the government's inability to 
protect the state's vital interests and to conduct negotiations 
wisely and responsibly. 
  The joint no-confidence motion of Tzomet and the NRP cites 
what it terms the government's inadequate struggle against 
terror. 
  The YI'UD's motion of no confidence was instigated by the 
prime minister's remarks on Golan settlements evacuation. 
  Coalition Chairman Eli Dayan has said in reaction that the 
conduct of the opposition, which exploits terrorist attacks for 
antigovernment incitement, reflects an absence of national 
responsibility.

<F P=106> [Nitzan Hen video report; speakers identified by caption] </F>
  [Text] The outlawed Kakh and Kahana Hay Movements have 
decided to merge into one new movement, which would fight 
against the administrative detentions issued against some of 
their members. Kakh leader Barukh Marzel, currently in prison, 
and Kahana Hay leader Binyamin Kahana decided on the merger. 
Beni Kahana held a news conference this afternoon in Jerusalem 
to report on the affair. Our correspondent Nitzan Hen reports: 
  [Begin video-recording] [Hen] The decision to merge Kakh 
and Kahana Hay was born in the Hasharon Prison where Binyamin 
Kahana was held in the same cell with his biggest rival, Barukh 
Marzel. Kahana was released from prison last weekend. In 
response to the wave of administrative detention orders issued 
against activists of both movements, the two decided to put 
personal rivalries aside and work together. 
  [Kahana] In putting a large group of people in prison, the 
government has itself established the alternative leadership. 
  [Hen] The police sent its own observers to the news 
conference, fearing that the cooperation declaration might not 
strictly fall within the law. 
  [Kakh activist Mikha'el Ben-Ari] The cooperation will mainly 
be expressed in public activity, primarily on the streets. 
There will be legal coordination of our struggle against the 
various government decisions. We will also choose other ways, 
some of which we will disclose, others of which we will only 
report after the fact. [end recording]

  [Text] Chief of Staff Ehud Baraq says the PLO and Hamas 
[Islamic Resistance Movement] represent two aspects of a 
national movement possessing rather similar long-term aims 
vis-a-vis Israel. Lieutenant General Baraq added, however, that 
the two organizations have different methods for arriving at 
these goals. 
  Our correspondent Yo'el Nir reports Lt. Gen. Baraq today 
briefed the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee about 
reports on agreements between the PLO and Hamas. Baraq said 
that he will not be surprised if Hamas people join social 
networks in Gaza and Jericho, such as schools and welfare 
services. The chief of staff also said he will not be surprised 
if one faction of Hamas will pursue the path of terrorism. The 
chief of staff believes that the PLO will on the whole be 
interested in proving that terrorism is on the wane in the areas 
under their jurisdiction.

problems. 
  The commander made the remarks to our Army affairs

series of tests aimed at developing defenses for settlements 
along the confrontation lines to enable them to withstand a

  [Text] Jerusalem, April 27 (AFP)--The United States has run 
at least three spies against Israel who were all caught and 
jailed, according to a book published this week. 
  An Israeli-Arab arrested in 1988 is still in prison on 
charges of spying for Washington, said Yosi Melman, co-author of 
"Friends Indeed, Inside the US-Israel Alliance." 
  In another case a member of Israel's Shin Bet General 
Security Service passed on documents to double agent Major Yosi 
Amit, an Israeli intelligence officer he knew, Melman said. 
  The Shin Bet man has never been identified, nor has the 
Israeli-Arab, but Amit was released in October after serving 
seven years of a 12-year term. 
  "Israel has never wanted to admit which country Amit spied 
for," Melman told AFP. "All we know officially is that he 
supplied information to foreign agents. Although the United 
States denies it, I believe he spied for them. 
  "The Shin Bet agent who handed over documents to Amit 
claimed 
that he did not know what Amit did with them," Melman said. He 
was jailed for only three months. 
  "The first arrest in 1986 led Israeli investigators to 
suspect that the United States has set up a spy ring in Israel," 
Melman added. 
  With co-author and American Dan Raviv of CBS, he claims that 
the United States monitors Israel from a giant 
intelligence-gathering base in northern England which also 
watches Europe. 
  "One unit specializing in Hebrew listens permanently to 
Israel," Melman said. However he added that "the United States 
is cautious and uses a limited number of spies in Israel." 
  The book also backed previous press reports that Israel 
offered the United States a spy exchange in 1991, four years 
after the United States jailed for life Jonathan Pollard, a US 
naval officer, who spied for Israel.

  [Text] Aden, 27 Apr (MENA)--A responsible source at the 
Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] Information Center has stated that 
at 1100 today the 1st Armored Division led by Colonel 'Ali 
Muhsin al-Ahmar, stepbrother of Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih, backed by other brigades brought in from Sanaa, launched 
an offensive. 
  The Yemeni source said that these forces launched a 
large-scale offensive with various types of weapons against the 
2nd Armored Brigade, deployed in 'Imran, which receives its 
orders from the defense minister. The source added that pitched 
battles involving the use of heavy weapons are still raging this 
afternoon. 
  The source said that the aggression against the southern 
brigade took place directly after President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih 
delivered a speech in al-Sab'ayn Square in Sanaa today to mark 
the 27 April occasion. In his speech, he called for removing 
the YSP from power. The source noted that the military 
escalation of the situation on this large a scale throughout 
Yemen will block the success of the mediation efforts being made 
to resolve the crisis peacefully. The YSP holds President Salih 
personally, and members of his family who occupy important posts 
in the military establishment, as the source put it, responsible 
for the grave consequences that may result from this offensive.

  [Text] Sanaa, 27 Apr (MENA)--A Yemeni military source in 
Sanaa today accused the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] of causing 
the military situation in Yemen. In a statement this evening, 
the source said that at 1330 today while the military committee, 
accompanied by the U.S. and French military attaches, was 
visiting the 1st Armored Brigade and the 3d Armored Brigade in 
the 'Imran Camp in Sanaa Governorate, armed groups led by YSP 
member Yahya Dahish 'Alyan, an "old officer expelled from the 
Armed Forces," stormed the camp and began firing various small-, 
medium-, and large-caliber weapons as well as tank, artillery, 
and rocket fire. The source pointed out that the bombardment 
targeted the headquarters of the 1st Armored Brigade, the 
soldiers barracks, the central security camp nearby, and 
residential areas in the city of 'Imran. 
  The source said that the intensive bombardment caused heavy 
losses in lives and property. Dozens of people were martyred 
and others were injured, but the casualty toll has not been 
determined. The Yemeni military source expressed his regret for 
this incident. He said that President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih 
followed up on the situation from the very beginning and 
immediately issued instructions to the defense minister and the 
general chief of staff to quickly contain the situation and 
prevent any military deterioration.

  [Text] Sanaa, 27 Apr (MENA)--The joint military committee 
entrusted to control the situation and prevent friction between 
Yemeni forces regrets the 'Imran Camp incident between military 
units from north and south Yemen that occurred north of Sanaa 
this afternoon. 
  In a statement this evening, the committee said it will 
continue its mission to maintain the cease-fire and will work to 
restore reassurance to the personnel in the camp. 
  The committee urged the forces in 'Imran Camp to demonstrate 
patience and self-restraint, and it called on the Yemeni Armed 
Forces not to heed those who try to ignite sedition among the 
sons of the unified homeland. 
  The committee discussed the circumstances of the clashes 
that 
took place in the camp while it was visiting at noon today. It 
did not blame one side or the other. 
  The committee said it visited the camp accompanied by the 
two 
commanders of the two brigades (one from the north and one from 
the south) and noticed that everybody was in a state of high 
tension and that the engines of the tanks and military vehicles 
of both sides were in a state of readiness. 
  It was agreed that the engines be stopped and that everyone 
would go to lunch, the committee said. During this, it added, 
three gunshots from an unidentified source were heard. This was 
followed by heavy machine-gun fire and later by fire from tanks 
and all types of weapons coming from all directions. 
  The statement said the committee managed with extreme 
difficulty to leave the camp by going in different directions.

  [Text] The joint military committee has issued the 
following communique: 
  At a time when the joint military committee was making a 
field visit to the camp of the 1st and 3d Armored Brigades in 
'Imran, which it reached at 1200 yesterday, and after meeting 
with the commanders of the two brigades and making a field tour 
of the camp, accompanied by the two brigades' commanders, the 
committee noted that all were in a state of maximum tension. 
The engines of tanks and vehicles were running. The committee 
reached an understanding and agreement with the commanders to 
switch off the engines of the tanks and vehicles. All went for 
lunch, after which the committee was to meet again with the 
commanders of the two brigades. Afterward, the committee was to 
meet with the personnel and officers of the two brigades to talk 
to them and calm them down. While the brother members of the 
committee were having lunch with the commanders at the officer 
hall and at around 1400, three shots were heard from an 
automatic machine gun. The source of the shots was not known. 
However, somebody fired them in the air. At the same time, 
gunfire was heard from a heavy machine gun after which shells 
were fired by the tanks in the camp, as well as all other kinds 
of weapons in all directions. It was with extreme difficulty 
that the military committee managed to leave the camp from 
various directions. 
  The joint military committee has informed the political 
leadership in Sanaa and Aden of the incident. It also met with 
a number of dignitaries, notables, and citizens in the region. 
Afterward, everybody headed in the direction of the fighting 
units. Loudspeakers were used to convey the appeal made by the 
chairman of the Presidential Council and commander in chief of 
the Armed Forces, the vice chairman of the Presidential Council, 
the defense minister, the chairman of the General Staff, and the 
members of the military committee, for an immediate cease-fire. 
  The military committee demanded that all vehicles and tanks 
remain in their positions until tomorrow morning. 
  While expressing its regret for this regrettable incident, 
the military committee will pursue its mission to keep the 
cease-fire and work collectively to instill once again 
reassurance in the hearts of the officers, noncommissioned 
officers, and personnel in the 'Imran Camp. The committee 
appeals to all of them to exercise self-restraint and 
demonstrate patience and wisdom. It also appeals to all members 
of the Armed Forces to deny any chance to those who are trying 
to ignite sedition between the sons of the one homeland and to 
work to restore confidence to enhance national unity.

  [Text] Aden, 27 Apr (MENA)--An official Yemeni Defense 
Ministry spokesman in Aden has said that a large-scale military 
campaign is moving toward 'Imran Camp (which witnessed clashes 
between northern and southern units today) to besiege the 3d 
Armored Brigade (southern) despite telephone appeals to the 
chairman of the Presidential Council and the chief of staff for 
a cease-fire. 
  The spokesman said in a statement tonight that the campaign 
does not only target the "steadfast" brigade but seeks to push 
Yemen into a devastating war. 
  The spokesman warned "those who play with fire" against such 
acts and demanded an immediate halt to the fighting against the 
3d Armored Brigade. The spokesman appealed to the joint 
military committee to investigate the incidents and condemn 
those responsible for them.

  [Text] A military source at the Defense Ministry and the 
General Staff command has made the following statement to the 
Yemeni News Agency, SABA': 
  At 1400 yesterday, Wednesday, the same time the military 
committee and the U.S. and French military attaches were 
visiting the 1st Armored Brigade and the 3d Armored Brigade at 
the 'Imran Camp in Sanaa Governorate--as part of a tour of 
various military units and formations in the various Yemeni 
camps being made in an attempt to end the military repercussions 
and remove any form of tension and to pave the way for the 
implementation of the military section of the pledge and accord 
document--the tanks and armored vehicles of the 3d Armored 
Brigade suddenly and treacherously opened fire on the 
headquarters of the 1st Armored Brigade and the soldiers' 
barracks, as well as the dining hall in which the personnel of 
the 1st Armored Brigade were eating, in addition to the nearby 
central security camp and the citizens' residential areas in the 
city of 'Imran. This action resulted in a large number of human 
and material losses, including scores of martyrs and innocent 
victims. Their numbers have not yet been determined. 
  The source strongly regretted this deplorable criminal act 
which was planned and implemented at the orders of the forces of 
apostasy and secession in the Yemeni Socialist Party to exploit 
the situation militarily and implement their secessionist plan 
which seeks to fragment the country, foment sedition among the 
sons of the one homeland, and implicate the sons of the valiant 
Armed Forces in fratricide and a bloody, destructive conflict 
which benefits no one except warmongers and enemies of the 
Yemeni homeland, its unity, and its democratic course. 
  The source said it was no coincidence that this new military 
situation was triggered on 27 April, the same day our Yemeni 
people throughout Yemen were celebrating the day of democracy 
and legislative legitimacy, on this day marking the passage of 
one year of the people's free election of the first elected 
parliament under the banner of a unified Yemen. The renegade, 
secessionist forces saw on this day a setback for their failed 
dreams and aims for a comprehensive hegemony. This is what our 
Yemeni people rejected with great resolve when the Yemeni 
homeland restored its cherished unity on 22 May 1990. April 27, 
1993 was the historic day on which our Yemeni people triumphed 
through their own free will in electing their representatives at 
the House of Representatives and established their legitimate 
constitutional institutions, which the separatist forces are 
trying to attack and marginalize as part of their scheme to 
fragment the homeland and restore the pre-22 May 1990 situation. 
The source indicated that such a criminal act is part of a 
series of plots concocted by the forces or apostasy and 
secession, which began with exploding the situation in Abyan on 
the eve of signing the pledge and accord document in Amman, 
capital of the sisterly Hashemite Kingdon of Jordan, when they 
planned to transfer a military brigade from al-Mukalla in 
Hadramaut to the Abyan Governorate, send a tank battalion from 
Aden to Abyan, and move units from the 5th Brigade to Abyan. 
They also instructed the 30th Brigade to move from Shabwah in 
the direction of Abyan. The aim was to disavow commitment to 
the pledge and accord document under the pretext of a militarily 
explosive situation. This is a clear indication of the 
premeditated secessionist intentions of the forces of apostasy 
and secession in fragmenting the homeland. 
  The source said brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih, chairman of the Presidential Council and supreme 
commander of the Armed Forces, has been following the situation 
closely. He issued his immediate instructions to the brother 
defense minister and the chief of staff to quickly contain the 
situation and stop any possible military repercussions in order 
to foil the plans of the secessionist forces and enemies of the 
homeland and its unity. He also instructed the military 
committee to quickly investigate the incident and its 
implications. The source voiced confidence that the sons of the 
valiant Yemeni Armed Forces, well known by our Yemeni people as 
protectors of the homeland and a shield for the revolution, 
unity, and democracy, will live up to the confidence our people 
have placed in them. They will foil such criminal schemes by 
the forces of apostasy and secession. They will also be lying 
in wait for anyone who dares to harm the homeland's gains, 
headed by unity and democracy. 
  The source also appealed to the military committee to 
continue its efforts to stop all clashes and military actions in 
'Imran Camp to spare Yemeni blood and foil the plans aimed at 
implicating the sons of the Yemeni homeland in fratricide, 
conflict, and the fragmentation of the homeland. He called on 
the military committee to quickly investigate the regrettable 
incident, expose those responsible for it, and inform the Yemeni 
people both inside and outside the country about what really 
happened. The source called on our Yemeni masses and military 
and security forces to show vigilance, awareness, and national 
cohesion in order to confront the schemes of the forces hostile 
to unity and democracy in our country, those which seek to 
fragment the homeland and foment sedition among its people.

  [Text] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
Presidential Council chairman, has received Arthur Hughes, the 
U.S. ambassador to our country. They discussed various issues 
of interest to bilateral relations. They also discussed 
developments in the situation in our country in light of the 
regrettable events at the 'Imran camp. 
  The brother chairman expressed profound regret and sorrow 
for 
the chaste Yemeni blood spilled as result of the reckless 
practices of some irresponsible elements. He said these 
practices aim to implement hostile designs to push the situation 
toward a military explosion, to circumvent the pledge and accord 
document, and to drive the people and their Armed Forces into 
the furnace of bloody fighting in order to destroy unity. He 
stressed there is no alternative to unity, democracy, security, 
and stability, no matter what the price. He expressed 
appreciation for the U.S. friends' interest in our country's 
security and stability and for their support for unity and 
democracy. 
  The brother chairman of the Presidential Council also 
received French Ambassador (Marcel Levin). They reviewed 
bilateral relations and the efforts being exerted to contain the 
crisis in light of the regrettable military developments and 
incidents in 'Imran yesterday. 
  The brother chairman stressed his eagerness to contain the 
situation and thwart all designs to stir up sedition and 
infighting among the children of the same homeland. He said 
dialogue and resorting to reason and wisdom are the only way to 
tackle all issues and problems. He expressed appreciation for 
France's efforts to support our country and its unity and 
democratization.

  [Text] Sanaa, 27 Apr (MENA)--Yemeni President 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih has received a message from Egyptian President 
Muhammad Husni Mubarak urging the Yemeni parties to stop the 
clashes and avoid a military confrontation to prevent shedding 
Yemeni blood. 
  The message was delivered by Egyptian Ambassador in Sanaa 
'Ata Mahmud Harun when the Yemeni president received him this 
evening. 
  President Mubarak called for dialogue among the parties to 
the conflict and for a halt to violence to preserve Yemeni unity. 
  The Egyptian ambassador also telephoned Yemeni Vice 
President

  [Excerpts] To celebrate 27 April Day, the immortal day of 
democracy in the life and history of our people [first 
anniversary of first legislative elections in Yemen], a grand 
popular speech rally was held today in 70 Square in Sanaa, the 
capital of the revolution and the unity. The celebration was 
held in an atmosphere of overflowing national zeal streaming 
from the depth of the Yemeni people's national conscience, faith 
in God almighty, confidence in the present and future, and 
awareness of the importance of the Yemeni revolution and the 
blessed unity. [passage omitted] 
  Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
Presidential 
Council chairman, attended the grand popular speech rally. He 
delivered an important national speech. Addressing the masses 
who assembled in 70 Square, brother 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih said: 
This day last year, our people, men and women, throughout the 
governorates of the Republic of Yemen orderly headed for the 
polls to elect their representatives to the House of 
Representatives. [passage omitted] 
  The brother chairman said: We stress to the masses of our 
people that we will not agree to seeing the role of the 
legislative institution -- the House of Representatives -- 
marginalized. We call on the representatives of the Yemeni 
people -- being above parties and narrow party affiliations -- 
to exercise their Constitutional tasks without hesitation, for 
they are the representatives of the Yemeni nation. Our Yemeni 
people struggled before and after the revolution until we 
arrived at 27 April, the day when the first parliament in the 
history of unified Yemen was elected. I call on state officials 
to respect the nation and to head for the Constitutional 
institutions in order to take the Constitutional oath and to 
exercise their tasks. Any practices outside Constitutional 
institutions or the Constitution will be considered 
illegitimate. For over nine months, our Yemeni people have been 
suffering a great deal as a result of a grueling and suffocating 
crisis. It is a crisis for which some have been paid filthy 
money -- the same money that once tried to abort the revolution 
and now tries to abort unity and democracy. However, it is a 
bet on a losing horse. Our people, who supported the revolution 
and the republic and held fast at the 'Ayban, Zafar, and Radfan 
mountains, are again ready to collectively confront the enemies 
of unity and democracy and the advocates of separation. They 
have been paid the price of the crisis. Yet, they continue to 
talk about the people's suffering and living conditions. They 
have received the price of the crisis to purchase mines, machine 
guns, and tools of death to [words indistinct] and to abort the 
unity and democratization. In their view, returning the 
homeland to pre- 22 May 1990 is a cultural achievement. Our 
understanding of a cultural achievement is democracy, 
development, progress, social justice, and boosting national 
unity among the sons of the Yemeni people. No cultural plan can 
call for disintegration, destruction, planting the mountains 
with mines and lethal weapons. Yet, they claim to be speaking 
for unity and on behalf of the masses. From this place, I call 
on the valiant children of Yemeni people in Aden, Hadhramaut, 
(?Rassan), al-Dali', al-Yafi', Shabwah, al-Maharah, Abyan, and 
throughout all the governorates of the republic to lie in wait 
against all anti-unity forces and separatist elements. If the 
separatists manage to control any part of the homeland, the iron 
fist will return. However, our entire Yemeni people throughout 
the homeland will be waiting for the separatists and will 
confront them. Our people will stem those who stop at the gates 
of some capitals to receive filthy money to abort unity. Our 
people and their Armed and Security Forces will say no to those 
people. They will collectively erect an impregnable wall 
against outlaws and those who want to harm the unity and 
democracy. 
  The brother chairman said: We proudly assure the masses of 
our Yemeni people that the unity enjoys extensive Arab, Islamic, 
and international support. This is because the unity is a 
guarantee of regional security and stability. We call on the 
unionists in the Yemeni Socialist Party to speak out and to 
firmly oppose the advocates of separation, who are inimical to 
the Yemeni people. We say yes to unity and democracy and no to 
infighting, blocking roads, and embellished speeches; yes to 
development, paving roads, building hospitals, and purchasing 
medicine, instead of purchasing tools of destruction, 
subversion, and death, and fattening overseas bank accounts. 
  Earlier, the festival was opened with Koranic recitations. 
Afterward, many speeches were delivered, including a speech by 
the popular commission for defense of unity and opposing 
separation in the capital. The speech was delivered by brother 
Jamal Sharhan. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] To celebrate 27 April Day, the immortal day of 
democracy in the life and history of our people [first 
anniversary of first legislative elections in Yemen], a grand 
popular speech rally was held today in 70 Square in Sanaa, the 
capital of the revolution and the unity. [passage omitted] 
  Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
Presidential 
Council chairman, attended the grand popular speech rally. He 
delivered an important national speech. [passage omitted] 
  Addressing the large crowd in 70 Square, the brother 
chairman 
said: You should arm yourselves with awareness. I had wished 
that the rest of the political parties would participate in the 
democratic framework. Some of these parties had acquired more 
than their true size. However, they knew their place on 27 
April and each political party knew its true size. The masses 
said their word and were above all parties, and above all those 
who seek to extend their hands abroad. The loyalty of the 
masses was for God, the homeland, the revolution, democracy, and 
unity. The masses spoke clearly: No to sectarianism, 
regionalism, and racism; no to the elements of sabotage and 
destruction. All those who seek to sabotage national unity and 
disunite national ranks will pay a heavy price. Each citizen of 
our people will turn into a judge, court president, and attorney 
general in the name of the Yemeni people to try all those who 
harm this homeland and this nation. Also, our Armed Forces 
today represent [words indistinct] the homeland and the shield 
of 22 May. They are also the protectors of unity and democracy. 
  The brother chairman called on the masses of our Yemeni 
people to form committees in all the governorates, districts, 
and neighborhoods, to defend unity and democracy and oppose the 
elements of sabotage wherever they exist. 
  The brother chairman cited a political statement by the 
spokesman of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] to the effect that 
the accord document cannot be accepted and that it is not 
possible to return to pre-22 May 1990 and after [date 
indistinct] 1993. He means by this canceling 22 May. However, 
there are people who have remained faithful to their pledge to 
God and who keep to unity and democracy. Unity and democracy are 
the property of the entire Yemeni people, who can protect them, 
since they are not the property of a political party or leader 
who claims guardianship over any governorate of the republic. 
The parties should be national parties and should extend over 
the entire Yemeni arena, from Sa'dah to al-Maharah and to 
Hadhdramaut, Aden, Ta'izz, and other governorates of the Yemeni 
republic. Our people reject, and will not accept, regional 
parties. These parties are rejected. 
  The brother chairman called on the House of Representatives 
to assume its historic responsibilities. He added that there is 
apparent circumvention to abort the [Dialogue] Committee. We 
had wished that the Dialogue Committee would be fair and 
unbiased and that it would side with justice against falsehood. 
Regrettably, however, the Dialogue Committee ordered all 
members of the Presidential Council to get together and this did 
not happen, but it did not dare condemn the party that violated 
its decisions. 
  He noted that the accord document stipulated two major 
points. First, arresting the subversive elements. However, the 
YSP is today allying with these elements and is supplying them 
with tools of sabotage. Second, moving the military units from 
the pre-unity positions to the center of Yemen in line with the 
document. However, this has not happened and we did not hear any 
voice from our brothers and colleagues in the Political Forces 
Dialogue Committee regarding this conduct. [passage omitted] 
  The brother chairman added that 27 April shall remain the 
cultural plan of the Yemeni republic. It is an object of 
admiration and appreciation of the world. We assert to those 
who attempt to fragment our national unity that we, here, shall 
maintain our steadfastness and defend the revolution, the 
republic, and the unity. There can be no alternative to the 
revolution, the republic, unity and democracy, whatever the 
price. [passage omitted]

  [Text] As we informed you earlier in the bulletin, the 
first extraordinary meeting of the foreign ministers of member 
countries of the contact group of the Islamic Conference 
Organization [ICO] will convene in a few hours time in New York. 
The meeting is to discuss ways to deal with the present 
situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. We draw your attention to an 
interview by our correspondent with Mr. Velayati, our country's 
foreign minister, who is in New York at present: 
  [Begin recording] [Velayati] On Wednesday morning, New York 
time, we plan to have a private, informal and consultative 
meeting with the foreign ministers of the contact group 
countries. Then we will participate in the ICO's official 
session. Thereafter, we will attend the UN Security Council 
General Assembly. We intend to discuss more profound and 
detailed legal and political issues with the Security Council. 
This is because the continuing complacency by the United 
Nations in defending peace, security, and human rights in 
Bosnia, and in Gorazde particularly, cannot be justified. On 
the basis of Article 51 of the UN Charter, the right of 
legitimate self-defense is one of the fundamental and 
indisputable rights of the people of Bosnia. Unfortunately, 
however, with the imposition of an arms embargo on Bosnia, which 
is based on UN Security Council Resolution 713, the right of 
self-defense has in effect been taken away by the United Nations 
from the people of Bosnia. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] In your opinion, to what extent 
will the decisions to be adopted at the session be effective in 
countering the Serbian aggression? 
  [Velayati] There is no doubt that diplomatic and 
international initiatives are effective in paving the ground for 
inception of a correct or, as the case may be, a wrong process 
at a global level. [sentence as heard] The elements who 
violated the rights of the Bosnian people during recent times, 
were earlier active at the diplomatic and international levels 
to prepare the ground for their actions. If we seek to defend 
the rights of the Bosnian people, we must pursue diplomatic and 
international efforts carefully and seriously, alongside our 
efforts to secure various types of aid and assistance to the 
Bosnian people. In this way, we will be able to present the 
world with a logical explanation for the endeavors that are 
currently being made by the Muslims of the world. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Jamal Salim and Tariq 'Abdallah] </F>
  [Text] After 70 years, during which Muslims -- in what was 
once called the Soviet Union -- suffered from persecution and 
oppression under the yoke of the communist rule which imposed on 
them the principles of atheism, the new Islamic republics have 
shaken off the dust of humiliation and degradation and replaced 
it with the light of Islam, of which the majority know nothing 
other than the two testimonies. These republics are strenuously 
trying to find a place for themselves on the world's map, 
especially as they are being subjected to many cultures that are 
alien to them, each of which is trying to attract them to its 
ranks. Egypt started to help these republics get to know their 
Islamic roots as soon as the Soviet Union collapsed. 
  Al-Azhar University President Dr. 'Abd-al-Fattah al-Shaykh 
said that the number of students who came in 1990-91 for higher 
studies reached 7,204, while 39,708 such students came to the 
university during 1985-1992, and the overall number during the 
scholastic year 1991-92 reached 8,118. He added that 250 
scholarships had been given to the new Islamic countries and 
there will be 250 this year. He said that the number of 
scholarships will be increased in the coming years. 
  'AQIDATI has met with the following students: 
  Muhammad 'Ali Hakim Sharif from Tajikistan -- a fourth-year 
student in the Islamic Research Institute. He said: A group of 
Muslims from Tajikistan, including myself, have come to study in 
Egypt at the expense of the Islamic Relief Organization. He 
added: Muslims in our country suffer from weak religious 
awareness and many of them know nothing about Islam other than 
the two testimonies. This is why I have come to Egypt full of 
determination to try to fill this vacuum, which is increasing 
daily because the communists killed a large number of 'ulema and 
shaykhs. 
  Muhammad Ahmad Qadi from Dagestan -- a second-year high 
school student at the Islamic Research Institute. He said: We 
Muslims in Dagestan are suffering from a struggle between the 
remnants of the collapsed communism and the new light of Islam. 
The population of Dagestan is three million, of whom 75 percent 
are Muslims. Regrettably, though the president of the republic 
is a Muslim he is also a communist. This is why we have 
suffered from much persecution, including a ban on prayers and 
on celebrating Muslim holy days. In these conditions, my father 
played a big role by setting up a secret office for teaching the 
Holy Koran and the Arabic language. Even though the 'ulema in 
our country are very few in number there are conflicts among 
them over trivial matters of jurisprudence. This is why we are 
in dire need of more Muslim 'ulema from all over the world, 
provided they are tolerant and well educated. 
  The child Qutb-al-Din Tabari from Tajikistan gave us 
details of his visit to Egypt. He said: I came to Egypt to 
learn the Arabic language and memorize the holy Koran. 
Currently I am a student at the Ahmad Libi Elementary School in 
Madinat al-Nasr. Praise be to God, I have succeeded in 
memorizing five parts of the holy Koran. I am making diligent 
efforts to memorize the entire book. I am doing well in my 
Arabic lessons at the elementary institute. I will also attend 
the Islamic Research Institute and afterward al-Azhar University. 
  Tabari added: When I go back to my country I will become an 
Islamic preacher and I will explain the concepts and 
fundamentals of Islam to my kinsfolk. I recall that when I 
returned to Tajikistan, I urged my friends to visit Egypt and 
learn Arabic and the fundamentals of Islam because al-Azhar is a 
scientific institute where Islam is well taught. 
  Zaynatallah Habiballah from Tajikistan is still waiting for 
the results of her exams at the Islamic Research Institute. She 
said she will attend al-Azhar University. She added: I believe 
that my education at al-Azhar is a mission that I must 
accomplish well. I come from a Muslim family in Tajikistan who 
perform the Islamic religious duties. My grandfather was an 
ulema who was educated at al-Azhar. 
  'Abd-al-Qadir Amin from Eastern Turkmenistan is a first-year 
student at the Shari'ah and Law School. He said: I came to 
Egypt three years ago on a grant from al-Azhar. I am learning 
the fundamentals of true Islam in order to propagate it in 
Eastern Turkmenistan. No awareness of Islam exists there, even 
though there are 25 million Muslims in Turkmenistan. Muslims 
throughout the world are unaware of the situation in Eastern 
Turkmenistan, where Islam is threatened with complete extinction 
despite this huge population. 
  Ramadan Shunshula from Dagestan is a student at the Islamic 
Research Institute. He said: The Muslims in Dagestan suffer 
from the communist rule of the country despite the collapse of 
communism. The Muslims are trying to regain their glories and 
the fundamentals of their religion. Hence, I urge the Islamic 
countries and organizations as well as all the Arab countries to 
keep the Muslims in mind and promote Islamic awareness in our 
country. Western missionaries are making intensive efforts to 
dominate the mentalities of the Muslim people in Dagestan. 
Muslims of the whole world should take responsibility for us. 
  Mustafa Tabari from Uzbekistan said: Our country is 
currently witnessing a huge Islamic awakening due to its dire 
need for Islam. Accordingly, many mosques, Islamic schools, and 
religious institutes have been built since independence. 
Furthermore, a Religious Affairs Ministry has been established 
to supervise such activities. We look forward to the support of 
the Islamic countries, particularly Egypt, in terms of the 
religious education in our country. Tabari added: We learned 
the Arabic language in the first year through our mixing with 
the people and avid reading. 
  Ya'qub Bin-Khalduf is from the Tatar Republic. He is in the 
second year of al-Azhar High School. He said that more 
attention should be paid to non-Arabic-speaking students, adding 
that these students should receive a one-year intensive courses 
in the fundamentals and basics of the Arabic language, in 
addition to the principles of Islam and its rulings regarding 
purity, prayers, fasting, and alms. He added: The students 
should take an exam at the end of the year, the results of which 
will determine the student's educational stage at al-Azhar. 
  Muhammad Karim from Tajikistan had the following to say: 
Our country is currently witnessing a power struggle between the 
Communists and Islamists. Accordingly, religious activities 
have so far been banned. The Islamic organizations must 
increase the number of scholarships to overcome this ban and to 
end the lack of awareness of the Islamic religion. 
  Ilyas Bin-Sulayman from Uzbekistan, a student at al-Azhar 
High School, says that Islam in Uzbekistan. [sentence incomplete 
as published] 
  Alluding to the problems facing them in obtaining 
scholarships at al-Azhar, 'Abd-al-Halim Bin-Fadl al-Din from 
Uzbekistan, who is at the al-Azhar Preparatory Institute, said: 
Our main problem lies in insufficient knowledge of Arabic and 
the lack of funds required for our travel to Egypt. 
  Firdaws Bin-'Abd-al-Hafiz from Uzbekistan said: I spent two 
years at the al-Bukhari Islamic Institute in Samarkand. I 
learned a certain amount of Arabic. I also learned the five 
foundations of Islam. But this is not sufficient for a graduate 
to propagate Islam in an affective and influential manner. 
Therefore, we decided to attend al-Azhar in order to learn 
Islam properly so we could carry out the propagation in our 
country. 
  He added: Praise be to God, there are still good people in 
the world. Shaykh Sa'ud 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Butayni from Kuwait 
undertook to send 57 students from Uzbekistan to complete their 
studies at al-Azhar at his own expense. Shaykh al-Butayni also 
provided all the funds for the students' transportation and 
tuition fees until the end of our studies at al-Azhar. 
  Anas Ya'qub from Tajikistan, a seventh grader at al-Azhar 
School, said: I joined al-Azhar fully determined to learn the 
true religion in order to convey my knowledge to my kinsfolk. 
To a question about the most prominent ulema and scholars in 
the Muslim world, Ya'qub said: I like to listen to Shaykh 
al-Husari, Shaykh Mahmud 'Ali al-Banna, and Shaykh al-Hudhayfi.

  [Text] Tunis, 27 Apr (MENA)--Palestinian President Yasir 
'Arafat has called Palestinian leaders, including officials from 
Gaza and Jericho, to an emergency meeting in Tunis on the night 
of Friday, 29 April. The aim of the meeting is to discuss the 
final draft of the agreement on the implementation of the 
Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles. The signing will 
pave the way for Palestinian self-rule in Gaza and Jericho. 
  'Arafat also invited a number of Palestinian and Arab legal 
advisers, including Dr. Mufid Shihab and Dr. Salah 'Amir from 
Egypt, to give their opinions on the agreement that will be 
signed with Israel once it is approved by the Palestinian 
leadership. 
  According to well-informed Palestinian sources, 'Arafat 
called the meeting following intensive discussions within the 
Fatah Movement's Central Committee earlier this week. The 
meeting is expected to address recent criticism of the agreement 
by Dr. Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi, former head of the Palestinian 
delegation to the Washington talks. 'Abd-al-Shafi had said that 
the agreement is not binding on the Palestinians in Gaza, a 
place where 'Abd-al-Shafi wields considerable clout. 
  The same sources say that 'Arafat is in favor of signing the 
self-rule agreement with Israel even if some issues remain 
unresolved, in which case self-rule in Gaza and Jericho will get 
under way at once and the remaining problems will be worked out 
later.

  [Text] Khartoum, 26 Apr (SUNA) -- Justice Minister 
'Abd-al-Aziz Shiddu has again stressed Sudan's firm commitment 
to human rights, in conformity with the nation's faith and 
current orientation. Shiddu responded to a statement issued by 
the U.S. Embassy last week, in today's issue of AL-INQADH 
AL-WATANI. Shiddu stated: We know all our responsibilities and 
do not need guidance on this issue. He declared the 
government's rejection of the United States' evil deeds against 
Sudan both inside and outside the country. 
  The U.S. Embassy claimed that Amnesty International's 
findings, which confirm that Sudan's human rights record is much 
better than that of the United States, Great Britain, and 
Israel, were not correct. The U.S. Embassy statement referred 
to alleged human rights violations in Sudan, and urged the 
government to take what it called serious steps to stop these 
violations.

  [Text] A news conference has been held at Iqamat el-Mithaq 
[near Algiers]. It was attended by the national pressmen and 
chaired by His Highness Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah, the 
Kuwaiti foreign minister. 
  The Shaykh began his news conference by praising the 
positive 
development in Kuwait's relations with Algeria and the rest of 
fraternal countries before dwelling on the possibility of the 
state of Kuwait giving financial assistance. He also dealt with 
the oil issue and the possibility of reducing Kuwait's quota in 
a bid to rally the oil prices. 
  [Begin al-Sabah recording] I hope that this news conference 
will be an opportunity to explain Kuwait's stance on the main 
issues of common interest to our two countries and to the Arab 
and Islamic nation. I would like at the beginning to praise the 
constructive talks which I have had in Algeria. I was honored 
to have a meeting with His Excellency President Liamine Zeroual, 
the head of state, to whom I conveyed a message from his 
brother, His Highness Shaykh Jabir al-Ahmad al-Jabir, the amir 
of the state of Kuwait, on our two countries' relations as well 
as other topics of common interest. 
  I would like here to praise the atmosphere which prevailed 
during our meeting. It was an atmosphere of brotherhood, 
clarity, and frankness. I have acquainted myself at this 
meeting with the Algerian officials' viewpoints on current 
issues. 
  I also had talks with Mr. Mokdad Sifi, the head of 
government, and with my brother and colleague Mohamed Salah 
Dembri, the minister of foreign affairs. I explained at these 
talks Kuwait's principled stance on a number of current issues. 
I would like to point out here that I was glad to find 
understanding of and appreciation for our position and our 
efforts. I would like to reiterate my gratitude and 
appreciation for Algeria and my brother the foreign minister and 
his aides for providing an atmosphere of amity for our visit and 
for their warm hospitality. [end recording]

  [Text] Kuwait, 26 Apr (KUNA) -- Lebanese Defense Minister 
Muhsin Dallul said in an interview published today that his 
country is strong and able to provide security for its citizens 
and residents. "No one, whoever it might be, can weaken it," he 
said. 
  In an interview with the Kuwaiti AL-ANBA' newspaper, Dallul 
said "There is an Arab country which attacked Lebanon, its 
security, its sovereignty, and its stability. Were we expected 
to stand with our hands tied over what happened?" He was 
referring to the recent assassination of an Iraqi opposition 
member Talib Suhayl al-Tamimi killed by members of the Iraqi 
Embassy in Beirut. 
  He added that his country has cut ties with the Iraqi regime 
because it chose Lebanon in particular as the site for the 
assassination. 
  "It is obvious that Iraq deems Lebanon to be weak and we 
want 
to prove to Iraq that Lebanon is a strong and capable country. 
No one, whoever it might be, can weaken it -- not Iraq or any 
one else," he said. 
  "We willfully cut ties with Iraq," he added, stressing the 
Lebanese Government's great responsibility for the security of 
Lebanese citizens and residents in the country. 
  Lebanon cut diplomatic ties with Iraq last week after 
Baghdad 
refused to lift diplomatic immunity from the Iraqi diplomats 
suspected of being involved in assassinating al-Tamimi. 
  Dallul said Lebanon will continue to confront what he 
described as "the dirty attack" which Iraq carried out against 
it and to teach everyone a lesson that his country is not "a 
sphere for settling accounts or a ground for others to fight 
each other on." 
  "We reject all these vile methods. Ties have been cut and 
will remain cut," he said expressing surprise that the killers 
confessed their crime based on a central decision from Baghdad 
to their embassy employees in Lebanon. 
  On the aggravated situation in southern Lebanon as a result 
of Israeli threats on the eve of U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher's arrival, Dallul said the threats were intended to 
heat up the negotiations so that they could remain "fiery." 
However, he ruled out an Israeli attack on his country as it 
would be "very costly." 
  Dallul rejected reports that Palestinians were (?singled 
out) 
and legally prosecuted, saying his country is going after those 
who committed crimes, be they Lebanese or otherwise. 
  "We are going after all those who commit crimes, whoever 
they 
might be, and not Palestinians in particular," he said. 
  Concerning the Lebanese army's raids on arm depots belonging 
to some groups and organizations and the confiscation of 
weapons, Dallul stressed that "no weapons, except legitimate 
weapons, will exist." 
  He indicated that several areas in the al-Biqa' and Beirut 
have been raided, but said that areas in southern Lebanon were 
excluded because Lebanese resistance is confronting the Israeli 
enemy and carrying out its national duty by doing so. He 
stressed the Lebanese Government's support for the resistance 
fighters. 
  On the government's media file, Dallul said that the 
ministerial committee assigned to drafting a law on the audio 
and visual media -- of which he is a member -- intends to 
prepare a draft law that is "advanced, civilized, and which 
guarantees the national interest."

<F P=106> [Interview and public phone-in with Foreign Minister Shim'on </F>
Peres by Nisim Mish'al in the studio on the weekly "Conference 
Call" program -- live] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Unidentified caller] The 
press reports that the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] has advised 
the prime minister against a full withdraw from the Golan 
Heights, while the prime minister declared he is willing to 
fully withdraw in return for full peace with Syria. In 1973, 
the chief of staff advised the cabinet to call up the reserves 
and, regrettably, the government decided otherwise, though the 
price was different. In view of this, does the foreign minister 
not think that maybe we should take the IDF estimate that we 
should not withdraw from the Golan Heights more seriously? 
  [Peres] Allow me first to correct you. The prime minister 
never said he favors a full withdrawal from the Golan. He said 
that the depth of withdrawal will match the depth of peace, but 
he did not say that we want full withdrawal. There are two 
questions here: one is military and regards the General Staff, 
the other is political and regards the government. The Army was 
asked how can we win a war -- that is, should we hold on to 
another mountain, which is reasonable. The government is asked 
how to prevent a war. Let me ask you, which is more important 
-- winning a war or preventing it? To prevent war, you need to 
attain peace. Hence, the question is not whether or not to get 
off the Golan Heights but how to attain peace. You should 
honestly ask yourself: Can we attain peace with Syria while 
holding on to the Golan Heights? If you want the State of 
Israel to live from one war to another while always thinking 
about how to win the next one, what kind of security is this? 
In terms of security, peace is an asset more important than 
army deployment. Peace is a weapon which protects Israel's 
security. 
  [Mish'al] Mr. Peres, let us review your stands on the issue 
of the Golan: You are for removing settlements from the Golan, 
as the prime minister said, and you are for ceding the Golan in 
return for a peace agreement. If so, what is there left to 
negotiate; the duration of the withdrawal? 
  [Peres] I never said I am for relinquishing, or even for 
saying I am for relinquishing, the entire Golan Heights. 
  [Mish'al] You are not for it? 
  [Peres] I am not for saying it. There are many questions 
that I have asked, and I am not willing to give answers 
regarding Israel before receiving answers that concern Israel. 
  [Mish'al] Excuse me, Mr. Peres, the press carry daily 
reports in which you and Mr. Rabin announce concessions on the 
Golan Heights, declare evacuation of settlements. Where else 
did the Israeli public get this idea from? 
  [Peres] This will not work. You will not mislead me. Let 
me tell you this: We say that we are willing to make 
concessions on the Golan in order to reach peace with Syria. It 
is clear to us that if we cede parts of the Golan Heights -- and 
I am not referring to their size at this time -- no settlements 
will remain there. The one follows from the other. I believe 
in saying the truth. The time has come to stop pretending. 
  [Mish'al] Please, say the truth. 
  [Peres] I am. I believe that attaining a comprehensive 
peace arrangement with Syria, including the Golan Heights, calls 
for the attainment of several goals: I want this to be the last 
agreement with the Arab world -- that is, after it is signed, 
the Arab world will no longer boycott us, threaten us, or be in 
a state of war with us. Al-Asad claims he is the leader of the 
Arab world. This is the last peak over which we haggle. I want 
this to be the last war we discuss. 
  [Mish'al] But while you attempt to conquer this peak, you, 
Mr. Rabin, in fact the entire Israeli Government, announce a 
willingness to make concessions. At the same time, we have not 
heard anything from al-Asad. 
  [Peres] Why are you worried? If he makes no concessions, 
there will be no agreement. Why are you so worried? 
  [Mish'al] You, who are negotiating with him, should be 
worried. 
  [Peres] I am not worried. In general, we are talking as if 
this is some ball. Everyone knows we have an agreement with 
Egypt, and that this agreement was signed by a person who said 
he will never give up the Sinai and he gave up on the entire 
Sinai, thus setting a precedent. 
  [Mish'al] But there was a slight difference: Al-Sadat 
announced he is ready to come to Jerusalem and address the 
Israeli nation and the Knesset and announce his willingness to 
make peace. 
  [Peres] I am all for al-Asad doing the same thing. 
  [Mish'al] Only he does not want to. 
  [Peres] We have no peace yet. Also, this is why we have no 
agreement. I say that peace with Syria should be accompanied by 
two types of agreements: A comprehensive peace between the 
states and a thorough peace in terms of the issues, including 
the strategic, tactical, and economic issues. This time, we 
want a comprehensive peace. We do want an open wound. We want 
real and comprehensive peace. We know the price; we know it is 
painful; I do not have to announce it at the beginning of the 
negotiations. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Riyadh, 27 April (KUNA) -- U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher will this afternoon hold a meeting here with 
his counterparts from the Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] states 
to discuss the latest developments in the Middle East peace 
process and the situation in the Gulf. The U.S. secretary of 
state arrived here early this morning preceded by the GCC 
foreign ministers who had arrived here late last night. 
Christopher is due to meet with King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, 
custodian of the two holy mosques, today before leaving for 
Cairo to complete his Middle East tour. 
  The GCC foreign ministers held a meeting here last night in 
preparation for the talks which they will hold with Christopher 
today. Sources from the meeting told KUNA that at the short 
meeting held at the airport the agenda for the meeting [with 
Christopher] prepared by the GCC general secretariat was 
reviewed. 
  Official political sources said that during their short 
meeting the ministers discussed the agenda of topics to be 
discussed with the U.S. secretary of state during the meeting to 
be held at the GCC general secretariat at noon today which will 
be followed by a joint news conference by Christopher and his 
Saudi counterpart Prince Sa'ud al-Faysal. 
  Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Sa'ud al-Faysal, who received 
the GCC foreign ministers and U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher, said that the meeting will focus on three issues 
[as received]: namely developments in the Middle East peace 
process, and the need for the co-sponsors of the peace 
conference -- particularly the United States -- to exert greater 
efforts to overcome the obstacles facing the process. Prince 
Sa'ud al-Faysal added that the meeting will also discuss the 
situation and developments in the Gulf region and the issue of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Sources expected that the meeting, which is taking place 
within Christopher's tour of the region, will focus on giving 
impetus to the peace process in the Middle East, the situation 
in the Gulf, and the Arab boycott of Israel.

  We are God's creatures, and to him we return. 
  May God's peace be upon you. 
  [Signed] Saddam Husayn, president of the Republic of Iraq

  [Text] Amman, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- 'Udayy Saddam Husayn, 
son of the Iraqi president, has prevented five Iraqi journalists 
from exercising their profession and decided to dismiss them 
from the the Journalists Association he heads. Among these 
journalists are Lutfi al-Khayyat and Ahmad Sabri, both members 
of the association's council. The decision came the day after 
the announcement in the Iraqi press that 'Udayy had been chosen 
as chairman of the Youth Union. This is his latest post, as he 
also heads the Students Union, the Journalists Association, the 
Olympic Committee, the Football Association, and the cultural 
grouping supervising the Writers Union and the Artists Union. 
He also heads the Saddam Engineering College and supervises 
Baghdad University, al-Mustansiriyah University, the Saddam 
Medical College, and the Scientific Research Center. He is also 
chairman of the meat company in al-Dawrah and the meat company 
in al-Mahmudiyah. In addition to the declared 13 posts he also 
assumes undeclared political and security tasks.

<F P=106> ["Attention" column by Hasan al-Kashif: "Iraq and Lebanon" ] </F>
  [Text] No matter how smart the parties fabricating the 
crisis between Iraq and Lebanon, and no matter what the official 
Lebanese claims and measures against Iraq are, no one is 
convinced that Iraq is behind all of Lebanon's problems, be they 
security, sovereignty, unity, stability, or the authority and 
efficacy of its legislative and executive institutions. 
  It is not Iraq that has shared Lebanon's occupation with 
"Israel" for almost 20 years. 
  It is not Iraq that imposes on Lebanon its presidents, 
ministers, and Arab and international policies. 
  It was not Iraq that bombed the Lebanese Presidential Palace 
at Ba'abda with its military aircraft, nor did it use its heavy 
artillery to shell the Lebanese Defense Ministry at al-Yarzah. 
  Iraq did not abduct anyone in Lebanon, nor did it 
assassinate 
Kamal Junblatt and scores of other prominent politicians, 
journalists, and intellectuals. 
  The history of the Iraqi Army is not tarnished by the crimes 
of the invasion and occupation of Lebanon or by the crimes of 
annihilating Lebanese. On the contrary, it is a history which 
is proud of the Iraqi Army's participation in confronting the 
Zionist invasion of Lebanon in 1978. 
  Iraq's relations with official and popular Lebanon are well 
known and very clean. They have always been based on respecting 
Lebanon's unity, sovereignty, and independent options. These 
relations have never been of the type that foster the division 
of the land and the people. This is well understood by all 
Lebanese Muslims and Christians, as well as all politicians, 
both the traditional ones and the leaders of the nationalist 
parties. 
  Iraq did not make a big of issue of the incident in which 
the 
enemies of Lebanon's unity and sovereignty blew up the Iraqi 
Embassy in Beirut in an unprecedented crime during which the 
Iraqi ambassador to Lebanon, several diplomats, and scores of 
other martyrs fell victims, although the protection of Iraqi 
diplomats accredited to Lebanon was the full responsibility of 
the Lebanese authority. Before the embassy explosion, several 
Iraqi officials also fell as martyrs through assassinations in 
Beirut in 1980 and 1981. 
  It is not the Iraqi armies that have occupied Lebanese 
territory since 1976 following an invasion blessed by Washington 
and Tel Aviv and in which Muslims, Christians, and Palestinians 
were massacred not in any clashes with the Zionist occupier, but 
under coexistence and full coordination with that occupier. 
  Iranian guards did not enter Lebanon with all their weapons 
and funds through Iraq and with its blessing and protection, nor 
did these guards set up their authority, banks, and 
establishments through coordination and suspicious deals with 
Iraq. 
  It was not Iraq that turned Lebanese territory into a den 
for 
terrorism, kidnapping, and blackmail operations to split a few 
dollars with the gangs of kidnappers who were charged with this 
temporary role according to certain policies and timings and for 
purposes which were known to the Lebanese authority which stood 
by like a spectator. 
  Are the present official Lebanese claims, measures, and 
accusations sufficient to hide all these facts?! 
  Will the smart ones in Lebanon succeed in diverting the 
Lebanese people's attention from the true enemies of their 
sovereignty and unity in Damascus and Tel Aviv, from those who 
are responsible for the death of the sons of Lebanon in the 
South, Beirut, Jabal Lubnan, the North, and al-Biqa'?!! 
  Lebanese shrewdness, inspired by the Damascus leaders, will 
not change facts. Iraq is busy with very well-known enemies, 
the enemies of all Arabs. Everyone has his known position and 
objectives.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Position of the Kuwaiti Rulers and Their </F>
Supporters and the Correct Conclusions"] 
  [Text] The speaker of the Kuwaiti parliament has rejected a 
proposal by Sa'di Mahdi Salih, speaker of the Iraqi National 
Assembly, expressing the Iraqi Assembly's readiness to discuss 
with a Kuwaiti parliamentary delegation all outstanding issues 
in order to serve the Arab national cause, achieve stability, 
and avoid the conflicts certain well-known quarters are trying 
to foster. 
  Important facts have been revealed by the Iraqi call for 
dialogue and the Kuwaiti parliamentary speaker's rejection of 
this call. It is up to sincere and honest Arabs everywhere to 
draw the right conclusions from these two stands, especially in 
the current difficult Arab situation in which Arab national 
interests need earnest, sincere, and responsible endeavors to 
solve Arab problems through dialogue and within the Arab 
framework. 
  Any sincere and honest Arab, whether an ordinary citizen or 
a 
government official, must link the Kuwaiti parliamentary 
speaker's stand with ill intentions, introversion, lack of 
desire to solve problems through dialogue and within the Arab 
framework, and more open dependence on foreign powers and their 
trusteeship over the region. 
  This is nothing strange for the Kuwaiti rulers and their 
supporters. They created the crisis through their own policies 
and liaisons, refused to resolve it through dialogue within the 
Arab framework, and then rushed for the help of the foreigner. 
  Arabs, Iraqis, and Kuwaitis will recall that recent events 
revealed the facts that Jabir instructed Sa'd [al-'Abdallah] on 
the eve of the Jeddah meeting not to reach an agreement and to 
go to the UN Security Council, rather than use an Arab framework 
within the Arab League. Developments confirm how the stands of 
the Kuwaiti rulers and their supporters were selfish, mean, 
introverted, incomprehensible, and arrogant. 
  Those stands, which did not help Kuwait and which in fact 
harmed the Arab stand, were and still are contrary to the Iraqi 
stand. Thus, the Iraqi National Assembly's readiness for 
dialogue with a Kuwaiti parliamentary delegation is based on a 
responsible Iraqi stand that has tried by every means to resolve 
differences through dialogue and to find an Arab solution to the 
crisis that serves the higher Arab national interests and 
protects Arab national security. 
  The difference between the two stands reveals many of the 
facts about the previous phase and how Iraq's pan-Arab stands 
were serious and open-minded. Leader President Saddam Husayn 
presented the dispute with Kuwait during a closed session of the 
extraordinary Baghdad summit in a fraternal, calm, and 
responsible spirit marked by wisdom, courage, and patience. 
Iraq presented the dispute to the Arab League in a memo 
addressed by the Iraqi foreign minister on 16 July 1990. A day 
later, Iraq's leader warned in his speech on the anniversary of 
the 17 July revolution of the dangers of the continuous harm 
being done by the Kuwaiti rulers. Throughout the weeks that 
preceded and followed 2 August 1990, Iraq took initiatives and 
responded to others in order to resolve the dispute through a 
dialogue within an Arab framework. However, the Kuwaiti rulers 
and their supporters followed a course different from that of 
the nation and brotherhood. 
  Sincere and honest Arabs everywhere are facing these facts 
anew. They can, after all that has happened, draw the correct 
conclusions and call a spade a spade. The Kuwaiti rulers and 
their supporters still reject the resolution of these 
differences through dialogue within the Arab framework. By 
holding to that suspicious rejection and continuing to maintain 
an atmosphere of panic, fear, and lies to justify their alliance 
with the foreigner and the continued presence of U.S. forces on 
Kuwaiti territory, they are serving their overlords who are 
exploiting the Kuwaiti rulers. They will continue to be the 
ones who determine when and how to provoke or permit the 
provocation of wars and seditions and guarantee placing the 
region into the wolf's mouth, as leader President Saddam Husayn 
said on 17 July 1990. 
  The Kuwaiti rulers and their supporters continue on the path 
of crisis, divisions, and dispute, while Iraq continues its 
honest and responsible pan-Arab stands which sincerely seek to 
resolve all outstanding issues and serve the Arab cause. 
  This makes it the duty of honest men in Kuwait and sincere 
and honest Arabs everywhere to confront the Kuwaiti rulers' 
suspect course, which is doing more harm to the region and the 
nation.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Sardar Asif by Buthaynah </F>
Abu-'Ubayd; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Abu-'Ubayd] Recently, there has been an increase 
in the wave of criticism of the Benazir Bhutto government 
claiming that she has reembraced the old approach. This raises 
questions about the fate of the current government and its 
stability? 
  [Asif] The internal situation in Pakistan is completely 
stable. Reports about tension have no truth whatsoever. The 
internal disturbances that take place are provoked by a 
neighboring state that always seeks to cause these disturbances 
to divert the attention of the Pakistani Government from its 
inhuman practices on its border. 
  [Abu-'Ubayd] How true is the current talk in Islamabad about 
the possibility of the Pakistan Muslim League [PML] withdrawing 
from its alliance with the ruling Pakistan People's Party, 
against the background of widespread mismanagement? 
  [Asif] I do not want to offend the Pakistani opposition. 
However, there is no real problem with the PML. These are only 
press headlines. The fact is my presence here is the best 
evidence of the continued alliance of the two parties. I am a 
member of the PML and I say the party coalition is permanent and 
stable. In addition, some religious parties, who posed as our 
enemies in the recent elections, have started to cooperate with 
the government. Take, for example, the Assembly of Islamic 
Clergy led by Maulana Fazlur Rahman. 
  [Abu-'Ubayd] On the economic level, has the government 
fulfilled the promises it made in its election program? 
  [Asif] We have succeeded in some aspects, particularly the 
economic aspects. When we arrived, the Pakistani treasury had 
only about three million [currency not specified] in hard 
currency. Now, we have two billion. We also got rid of the 
floating currency problem, which happened three times during the 
government of Nawaz Sharif. Also, the Karachi stock market is 
one of the world's five strongest markets. 
  There is also a major plan for economic reform. However, 
before carrying out this plan, we must remove difficulties and 
obstacles and pave the way for such reforms. We are currently 
trying to avoid the mistakes of the previous government and stop 
the negative developments it has caused, such as the financial 
crisis suffered by the country. 
  The IMF has agreed to give Pakistan $3 billion in aid. This 
shows the success of our new economic approach, which is also a 
subject of interest to world quarters. 
  [Abu-'Ubayd] As soon as she assumed office, Benazir Bhutto 
called a halt to the policy of privatization adopted by her 
predecessor. Is there any plan to reintroduce this policy? 
  [Asif] During the term of Nawaz Sharif, the system of 
privatization was used to serve the personal interests of a few 
people. The selling and ownership of government sectors was 
confined to an elite of his group. Consequently, the money and 
shares primarily went to people who are loyal to him, despite 
the fact that these sectors are owned by all the people. 
Therefore, we terminated and reviewed privatization in light of 
the new reform plan. We are now about to start it once again, 
but with caution and avoiding any corruption that might affect 
it. Within this context, we seek to attract investments and 
capital to invest in Pakistan, especially in the energy sector 
that yields guaranteed profit amounting to 33 percent. 
  [Abu-'Ubayd] The rise of the recent government was 
surrounded by speculation regarding a retreat to Islamic 
fundamentalism. How true is this on the ground? 
  [Asif] In the recent elections, the religious parties won 
only a few votes. There has been a large retreat in religious 
fundamentalism in the wake of the elections. It was clear to 
everybody that our people resent fundamentalism and extremism 
and support moderation and modern approaches. Our people think 
political parties can build a new Pakistan better than religious 
parties. 
  [Abu-'Ubayd] What is the aim of the active Pakistani 
diplomatic moves toward Iran, including high-level visits 
recently? 
  [Asif] You must be aware of the close relations between Iran 
and Pakistan. Iran is a friendly state. We have excellent 
relations with it but not at the expense of any other state. 
  We attach great importance to the north and south of the 
Gulf. We are interested in stability in the Gulf as well as in 
the Indian sea [as published] region. The Gulf states host more 
than 1 million Pakistani nationals. We have important economic 
cooperation. We have special ties with the United Arab Emirates 
[UAE], in particular. The UAE participates in huge projects and 
has huge investments in Pakistan. It is also an important 
source of oil for Pakistan. Moreover, during my current visit 
to the UAE, I proposed to the brother UAE officials to hold 
joint naval maneuvers, as we have already done with Iran and 
Oman. This is an indication of our special relations with the 
UAE. 
  Stemming from its good relations with both Iran and the UAE, 
Pakistan is prepared to play the role of mediator to resolve 
differences and the problem of the occupied islands, and end 
tension between the two, if we are asked to do so. 
  [Abu-'Ubayd] Now that the bilateral talks between Pakistan 
and India on the Kashmir issue have stopped, how do you see 
relations between the two countries in light of the continuous 
border tension? 
  [Asif] India does not want to resolve the Kashmir issue 
through negotiations. The Pakistani side has ascertained that 
India did not follow peaceful methods in this issue. Pakistan 
wants a peaceful solution based on UN resolutions. 
  The situation is really serious. Any deviation from the 
peaceful path will definitely lead to war in which the 
possibility of nuclear escalation will increase. This prompted 
the United States to bring India and Pakistan to the negotiating 
table. 
  Meanwhile, we will not remain silent on the mass violations 
of human rights in Kashmir. More than 500,000 Indian troops are 
deployed in Kashmir, spreading destruction and corruption on a 
daily basis. The situation there is more difficult than it is 
in Bosnia. We will be right if we call Kashmir the "Bosnia of 
Asia." 
  [Abu-'Ubayd] Following U.S. Assistant Secretary of State 
Strobe Talbott's visit, you announced your conditional readiness 
to stop your nuclear program. Will this be in exchange for a 
U.S. aircraft deal? 
  [Asif] Pakistan has never refused to sign an agreement to 
end 
the nuclear race in South Asia. We offered to agree to the U.S. 
proposals provided India agreed in the second round of 
negotiations and a solution was reached. [sentence as 
published] When an agreement is reached on a solution, we will 
be prepared to halt our nuclear programs in three stages, which 
will inevitably lead to some results. The first is immediate 
halt to the atomic project, the second is to return the program 
to its first stages, and then stop it altogether. I would like 
to assert that Pakistan does not possess a nuclear bomb. But 
Pakistan is a nuclear power and has the capability 
[al-salahiyah] to produce it at any time. When we reach 
agreement with India, we will stop the program completely. 
  As for the F-16 plane deal, we made it clear to the 
Americans 
that it should not be linked to the nuclear question. The 
United States agreed to the deal in the past and we paid $650 
[million] for 38 out of a total of 71 planes. 
  The U.S. Congress's refusal to approve the deal following 
the 
Pressler Amendment is a U.S. problem. I am confident that the 
Clinton Administration is understanding, and that it is 
endeavoring to remove obstacles to approving the deal because of 
the differences it engendered in the U.S.-Pakistani relations. 
  [Abu-'Ubayd] What about your agreement to allow inspection 
of 
your nuclear facilities? 
  [Asif] The Americans presented technical proposals on 
inspection to ascertain that we do not possess the bomb. After 
we study these proposals, we will consider whether or not we 
will allow them to monitor.

  [Text] The president, Mr. Sardar Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari, 
has called upon the opposition to end its boycott and join the 
proceedings of the National Assembly. He was talking to newsmen 
in Islamabad this morning after laying the foundation stone of 
the National Police Academy. The president said boycott is a 
constitutional right of the opposition, but it is high time that 
politicians must play their due role to defuse tension and end 
polarization in the national body politic. He said even 
otherwise there is no justification for the opposition to resort 
to boycott at this moment. 
  Replying to various questions, the president said he has 
done 
nothing unconstitutional as far as the NWFP [Northwest Frontier 
Province] is concerned. He said that Syed Sabir Shah, after 
losing majority in the Provincial Assembly, adopted improper 
tactics to sustain his government. He said it is a democratic 
norm that when one loses majority, he should step aside.

  [Text] Islamabad: The trade deficit recorded a decrease of 
US $700 million during the first nine months (July 1993 to March 
1994) of the current fiscal year as compared to the 
corresponding period of the last monetary year (1992-1993), 
official sources told The News on Tuesday [26 April]. 
  Statistics show that the trade deficit during the first nine 
months of 1992-1993 was US $2.014 billion, which reduced to US 
$1.322 billion between July 1993 to March 1994. 
  Financial managers consider this a significant reduction in 
the trade deficit, which registered a decrease of almost US $77 
million per month during the first nine months of the current 
financial year. They hope that the deficit would further be 
reduced by adopting more balanced approach in exports and 
imports. 
  Official sources say the foreign exchage reserves have been 
studied for the last two months at US $1.8 billion -- sufficient 
for almost nine weeks of imports. 
  Between July 1993 to March 1994, the total export bill 
remained US $4.80 billion as compared to US $5.05 billion during 
the same period of last fiscal year, showing a decline of 3.4 
percent in exports. 
  During the first nine months of the current fiscal year, the 
total import bill remained US $6.2 billion as compared to US 
$7.1 billion in the corresponding period of 1992-93, showing a 
decline of 12.2 percent in imports. 
  Financial managers say the decline in exports occured due to 
the discontinuation of the yellow cab scheme, effect of

  [Text] Colombo, April 28 (AFP) -- Sri Lankan authorities 
released an Egypt-bound cargo of chemicals detained at the main 
port here on suspicion that it could be used to make nerve gas, 
officials said Thursday [28 April]. 
  The three containers of phosporous pentasulphide arrived 
here 
four weeks ago from the Indian port of Bombay for transshipment 
to a consignee in Egypt, port officials said. 
  The Defence Ministry ordered the containers to be released 
this week following investigations regarding the end use of the 
cargo. The chemical is used to make pesticides and is also an 
ingredient in the manufacture of nerve gas. 
  The Egyptian embassy in Colombo had informed the authorities 
that the cargo was intended for the legitimate use of one of its 
chemical plants, the Dyestuffs and Chemicals of Kafar Dawar.

  [Text] The security forces, in an operation code named 
Jayamaga against the LTTE [Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam], 
began their task to extend the Army's area of control by 
(?acquiring) 75 square km in the Vavuniya District. A military 
spokesman told LANKAPUVATH that the troops -- directed from 
(Aptran) by Army Commander Lieutenant General Gerry De Silva -- 
had already extended their forward defense localities by 35 
square km last afternoon. They also liberated 500 farmer 
families from the LTTE control in Vavuniya's green rice belt. 
The operation has been launched with a view to rescuing farmer 
families from the LTTE. The Army commander had toured the new 
forward defense locality. He also held a series of meetings 
with the farming families. Arrangements have been made to 
immediately supply emergency stocks of logistics. 
  In another incident in the Eastern Province, troops of 
Operation (?Fighting) located and destroyed three terrorist 
bases and 24 huts in which the LTTE cadres were accommodated. 
They also recovered 43 bags of rice, stocks of medicines, and 
antipersonnel mines. A report from Amparai says that STF 
[Special Task Force] commanders have destroyed two LTTE hideouts 
at Kanchikudichiyaru and located an abandoned terrorist camp and 
destroyed it.

  [Text] Sri Lanka expects to achieve at least over 6.5 
percent economic growth in 1994. According to the Central Bank, 
in the first two months main traditional agricultural exports 
increased substantially showing a healthy growth in the gross 
domestic product. Production of tea in January and February was 
37 million kg. This is an increase of 12 percent over the 
corresponding period last year. Coconut production rose by 11 
percent to 329 million coconuts compared with 296 million 
coconuts in the first two months of 1993. The Paddy Marketing 
Board purchased 1,692 metric tons of rice during the period 
under review. It is an increase of four percent compared to 
1,630 metric tons purchased during January and February last 
year. 
  Deputy Governor of the Central Bank. A.S. Jayewardene said 
that the targeted economic growth for the year 1993 at the 
beginning of the year was 5.7 percent, but with the impressive 
economic performance, the real economic growth has now been 
estimated at 6.5 percent for that year. He said that this 
upward trend in the economy was continuing.

  [Text] The government today categorically assured 
Parliament that it will not give in to any pressure on the NPT 
[Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty] issue, neither will there be 
any change in India's stand that the NPT should be universal and 
nondiscriminatory. 
  Allaying apprehensions expressed by opposition members on 
the 
London talks between Indian and U.S. officials, the 
parliamentary affairs minister, Mr. V.C. Shukla, in the Lok 
Sabha and the minister of state for external affairs, Mr. Salman 
Khurshid, in the Rajya Sabha made it clear that there is 
absolutely no rethinking on the NPT issue. Mr. Shukla said 
there is no secrecy about the talks and it was held in London 
only because it was convenient to both the sides. Describing 
the talks as preparatory to the prime minister's forthcoming 
visit to the United States, he urged the members to ensure that 
both Parliament and the people strengthen the hands of Mr. 
Narasimha Rao in safeguarding the nation's interests. Mr. 
Shukla said that whenever summit meetings are planned, such 
preparatory talks are held to discuss various points which will 
come up. 
  Mr. Salman Khurshid said that government will abide by the 
Rajiv Gandhi action plan on nuclear disarmament; and earlier 
raising the issue during zero hour in the Lok Sabha, Mr. 
Saifuddin Chaudhary and other opposition leaders demanded a 
statement on the London talks, as it has created apprehensions 
in the minds of the people because of various press reports 
about the secrecy of the meeting. Raising the issue in the Rajya 
Sabha, Mr. J.P. Mathur, BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party], said that 
utterances by the U.S. officials have hurt the self-respect of 
the country.

  [Text] The ambassadors of 11 countries currently on a 
four-day visit to Kashmir were yesterday briefed in Srinagar by 
senior Army officers about the Pak-sponsored militant activities 
in the valley. The ambassadors were told that the militants 
indulged in killing of innocent people, burned government and 
private property, and also misbehaved with women. Ambassadors 
of Peru, Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Iran, 
Argentina, Brazil, Jordan, and Oman were shown the arms and 
ammunition seized by the security forces during their 
anti-militant operations. 
  The ambassadors also met some foreign mercenaries who 
admitted that they were misled by false propaganda that a lot of 
atrocities were being committed on the Muslim population of the 
valley of Kashmir but when they came there they found that 
nothing of this sort was happening there. The militants said 
they were disappointed now. The ambassadors saw some wounded 
militants being treated by Army doctors. 
  The visiting ambassadors today called on the Jammu and 
Kashmir governor, Mr. K.V. Krishna Rao, at the Raj Bhavan.

today to protest against official hindrances in the way of 
people's contact with the visiting Islamic countries' 
ambassadors in the valley. All shops, business establishments, 
educational institutions, and private and public offices

off the road. A spokesman of the All Parties Hurriyat 
Conference accused the governor of not allowing the public 
access to the foreign envoys. 
  Meanwhile, another six people have been martyred and many

<F P=106> [Speech by President Borhanoddin Rabbani, marking second </F>
anniversary of the Islamic revolution; place not given -- live 
or recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Faithful and free compatriots 
of the country, heirs of the blood of martyrs and guards of the 
Islamic revolution, brothers and sisters, peace and the 
blessings of God be on you [preceding nine words spoken in 
Arabic], and infinite praise to the nurturer of the universe who 
helped the proud and infidel-crushing Afghan nation in their 
bloody war and holy jihad to confront the aggressor and arrogant 
red forces, which like a demon generated fear and terror in the 
world, inflicting a defeat which opened a new chapter of 
campaign and uprising in the history of the struggle of the 
peace-loving and freedom-loving people. 
  Sawr 8th, which corresponds with the victory of the Islamic 
revolution in our country, revives the memory of the great 
resurrection of our nation and of more than 14 years of jihad 
and liberation struggle by every compatriot. On this very day 
two years ago the sound of God is Great [preceding three words 
spoken in Arabic] echoed far and wide in this land of heroes and 
the splendid flag of monotheism was unfurled. On this day the 
mojahedin of Afghanistan and the entire warrior and believer 
nation saw for themselves the fruit of jihad and the promise of 
God, and our people were freed from the degrading communist 
culture and from ideological and social degradation. 
  On this occasion I would like to present my cordial 
congratulations to you, the free and heroic nation which 
demonstrated steadfastness, fortitude, and resistance and which 
eventually bravely achieved the victory of the Islamic 
revolution. Sawr 8th opened a new chapter in the ancient history 
of Afghanistan, and without doubt future generations across the 
Islamic, free, independent, united, and unified Afghanistan will 
celebrate this day as the dearest blood-price of the fighters on 
the path of righteousness and monotheism with jubilation and 
enthusiasm. 
  It is appropriate that on such a day we should mark the 
second anniversary of our Islamic revolution, to honor the 
victory of the revolution as the blood-price of the martyrs of 
Islam and freedom in their tulip-colored shrouds and pray for 
the souls of those brave free men of this land who raised the 
flag of monotheism and guarded our independence and national 
sovereignty with their pure blood. We pray that God will make 
paradise their abode and residence. 
  There is no doubt that the Afghan jihad brought great 
changes 
in the world in the interest of peace and freedom. One result 
of this is the independence of many countries who lived, 
directly or indirectly, for many years under [word indistinct] 
of the former Soviet Union. The international system of 
communism as a base of [words indistinct] terror and colonialism 
disappeared. The Berlin wall in the heart of Europe fell, 
[words indistinct] and the period of the cold war ended, and a 
new era of understanding among countries and continents began. 
  The 14-year jihad of the people of Afghanistan and its great 
international impact, which is called [words indistinct] of the 
century, cost our nation very dearly. With the victory of the 
Islamic revolution the jihad leaders and the Islamic state 
declared a general amnesty -- the greatest example of Islamic 
and humanitarian forbearance and forgiveness. It was thereby 
decided that clashes and hostilities -- created by looting 
aliens and their uncultured servants -- were to be ended for 
good and replaced with Islamic fraternity and cooperation. 
  As for the living standards of state employees, despite 
budget restrictions the salaries of state employees have been 
doubled and the overdue allowances of civil servants and other 
state employees have been paid. It must be mentioned that 
despite the fighting and its huge costs, the state has been able 
to pay the salaries and other allowances of state employees up 
to the month of Hamal 1373, and to pay about seven billion 
afghanis to the families of the martyrs, the wounded, and those 
whose property was damaged. Steps have been taken to eliminate 
the atheist communist culture which was inculcated in certain 
circles of our society under the atheist regime, and a program 
of economic, social, and cultural policies of the Islamic state 
has been initiated within the limits of high national interests 
and lofty Islamic teachings. 
  In the international field, efforts have been made for the 
country to emerge from diplomatic isolation and to enter a new 
stage of constructive diplomacy in the interest of peace, the 
reconstruction of the country, and relations [words indistinct] 
with neighbors and all nations of the world. 
  Dear compatriots, the list of measures and achievements of 
the Islamic State of Afghanistan would certainly have been much 
longer but for treacherous conspiracies and ruinous battles 
waged by the traitorous elements against the achievements of 
jihad and the national interest. We mark this great victory at 
a time when, unfortunately due to the power-seeking of known 
groups and agents of the aliens, a bloody and ruinous war has 
been imposed on our nation, especially on the oppressed 
residents of Kabul. In this bloody hostility, the Islamic state 
has no goal but defense of the oppressed people. 
  After the victory of the Islamic revolution no armed clash 
inside the country has an Islamic and sharia basis. Yes, after 
14 years of jihad and after enduring enormous hardships, the 
people of Afghanistan were expecting that with the establishment 
of the Islamic State an epoch of order, tranquillity, stability 
and good intention and welfare would begin. They hoped that no 
pain, and that too from the side of the jihadi ranks, would 
threaten their individual and social life. 
  But because of the fiendish and opportunist forces,inside 
and 
abroad, who preferred their personal and group interest on the 
interests of Islam and national interest and who could not bear 
a powerful, united and developing Afghanistan in the heart of 
the continent of Asia, as a foundation of freedom and justice, 
embarked on sabotage and destruction. As a result of those 
bloody conspiracies our material and morale forces, which should 
have been employed for the reconstruction of the country and for 
the repair of damages caused by the war, have been, 
unfortunately, used for further destruction and the killing of 
our defenseless and innocent compatriots. 
  Those hostile acts began as from the first days when state 
power was handed over to mojahedin. When the gang-leaders of 
this catastrophe [words indistinct], and sometimes under the 
pretext of opposing the militia and sometimes opposition to some 
heroic personalities of jihad fanned the flame of war of [word 
indistinct] and fratricide. And thereby not only did they embark 
on killing and destruction in the country but also made 
questionable many years' prides of the mojahedin in and out of 
the country. In pursuit of a peace-seeking policy and observing 
the strategy of understanding and talks for the solution of 
problems, the ISA [Islamic State of Afghanistan] entered 
negotiations patiently and even ignored their organized 
conspiracies for the sake of the high national interests and the 
urgent realization of peace and security and resorted to the 
solution of problems through peaceful means when the ruthless 
warmongers embarked on chaos and destruction, and went anywhere 
possible in search of peace. But the other side did not adhere 
to any treaty and agreement. 
  Their last treacherous attempt, in the form of the 11th Jadi 
[1 January] coup d'etat of the sinister triangle, occurred only 
three days after the signing of an agreement which had been 
initiated by the peace delegation of the cabinet. 
  The coup d'etat plan was executed on a day which 
corresponded 
the date of the establishment of the infamous Khalq party 
[People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan]. In the incongruous 
composition of the putschists, known atheists, national 
traitors, and hypocrites have gathered in the form of a shameful 
coalition against Islam and Islamic sovereignty and against the 
people and the interests of the Afghan nation [37-second break 
in reception]. When the [word indistinct] of the coup d'etat 
were frustrated in their action, they embarked on retaliation 
against the afflicted people of Afghanistan and the residents of 
Kabul, and closed the road for the people whom they claim to be 
ruling, embarked on the intensification of war and rocket 
launching and the destruction of private and state property. It 
had not been seen in the history of the world for the prime 
minister of a country to commit such crimes against the 
residents of his capital, and it has nowhere been seen for a 
prime minister, who had been disappointed to seize power in a 
monopolized manner, to announce if he did not accede to power in 
a desired way, I would continue the killing of the defenseless 
nation for another 25 years. 
  It is interesting that they call elections a solution, and 
still think that they will be winners in elections, and expect 
that the people of Afghanistan will vote the killers of their 
children and the destroyers of their homes and those who 
strangulate them every moment by the imposition of famine and 
high prices of primary goods. The people have recognized their 
enemies. 
  Dear compatriots, we are of the opinion that the principled 
way of the solution of the current crisis of the country is the 
creation of an effective electoral mechanism for the appointment 
of the future leadership of Afghanistan. As in the past, war 
cannot resolve the smallest of problems but it adds to the 
hardship. In the opinion of the ISA, talks and understanding 
for the cessation of war and bloodshed and for the joint search 
for solution of the problems of the country are preferable and 
have priority. Now the time of the rejection of the mojahed 
forces and their upstaging in the process of determining the 
fate of the country has passed. We should all jointly 
participate in the cessation of the disputes in the high 
interest of the country. 
  Our faithful and patriotic people are seriously in need of 
peace and security. They should practically condemn these 
warmongers, and should not allow any person or force to obstruct 
the tranquillity of our people and the stability of the 
situation. The homeland is the common home of all of us. All 
son of this land, belonging to any nationality or tribe and 
living in any part of the country and speaking any language, are 
equally responsible before the country. The defense of its 
independence and honors, effort and striving for its 
construction and prosperity are of the common responsibility of 
all residents of this land. 
  Defense of independence and its honor and work for the 
country's reconstruction are the common duties and 
responsibilities of all who live in this country. Another most 
important duty of our people is to foil and repulse the 
(?enemies) [words indistinct] who are causing sedition and 
disorder in their own self-interests or on the instruction of 
groups to whom they are attached. We believe that the faithful 
and honest sons of this country are able to resolve and to end 
the present crisis and any other crisis in their country without 
foreign interference. 
  I believe that the people of Afghanistan themselves are 
confident arbitrators and judges with the right and authority 
regarding the national issues of Afghanistan. The people must 
have the opportunity to use this right and to decide about their 
homeland and its future, its political system, and its 
organizational structure. Respecting the will of the people is 
an Islamic command and an accepted international tradition. 
Therefore, with regard to the solution of current problems, we 
believe that a council [shura] representing the will of the 
people should be set up. Whatever this council is called or 
whatever name they give to it -- great council [loya jerga], 
constituent council [shura-e hal wa aqd], grand council [grand 
majlis], or any other name -- all nationalities, clans and 
tribes, religious sects, and the country's various regions are 
to have proportionate representation in this council. 
  A nongovernmental and competent commission named the 
Preparatory Commission for the Formation of the Shura is to be 
set up in order to prevent and to eliminate every possible kind 
of pressure likely to be exerted on the work of this council or 
to prevent any question about its work. This commission will be 
tasked with preparing the draft for setting up this council and 
determining the procedure for the election of council members 
and candidates for the country's leadership. This commission 
will have [word indistinct] executive authority and its expenses 
are to be paid by the conference of foreign ministers of the 
Islamic countries and the United Nations. These two 
international organizations can supervise the work of setting up 
this council. [words indistinct] 
  I call on the esteemed arbitrator delegation and all those 
who are working for peace to take action as soon as possible to 
set up this Shura. As soon as this work is completed I am ready 
to hand over all power immediately to this council. I declare 
clearly and earnestly to the brave people of Afghanistan that I 
personally do not wish to shed even one drop of blood of our 
persecuted people for whatever reason or objective. We have 
already shown the necessary readiness, and in the future too we 
are ready to take every beneficial action on this path. After 
this council has been set up, as pointed out, state power will 
be handed over. This council will elect the future leadership 
in conformity with the will and wish of the entire people. The 
council's decision must be respected by all. 
  It is my duty here to express appreciation for the work and 
earnest endeavor of the peace delegations inside the country and 
the esteemed ulema from the Islamic countries, as well as for 
the work and efforts of the United Nations (?and the UN peace 
delegation) led by esteemed M. Mestiri who have been working 
very hard. 
  I hope that as a result of the efforts of the caring people 
inside the country and the cooperation of the friendly and 
neighborly countries and international organizations, especially 
the OIC and UN, the current problem in our country be resolved 
and peace and security be restored. 
  Pursuing the principle of positive nonalignment and 
noninterference in the internal affairs of countries near and 
far, the Islamic State of Afghanistan is loyal and interested in 
the consolidation of peace and stability in the world and does 
not interfere in the internal affairs of any country. The 
Islamic State of Afghanistan is the serious supporter of 
freedom, justice, and the observance of human rights, and 
consider respectable and observable the Charter of UN, the 
principles of Nonalignment Movement, and all international 
conventions which are not against Islamic values. While 
remembering with appreciation the support of the neighboring, 
Islamic, and other peace-loving countries during the righteous 
struggle of the people of Afghanistan, the Islamic State of 
Afghanistan once again asks all those countries to render 
sincere cooperation with our people in the process of the 
ensuring peace and security and the reconstruction of the ruined 
Afghanistan. Dear compatriots, congratulating you once again 
on the second anniversary of the victory of the Islamic 
revolution, I wish that almighty God makes the third year of the 
victory of the Islamic revolution, in whose first days we are 
now, a year of peace and calm and [words indistinct] in order 
that we shall celebrate other anniversaries of this historic day 
in an atmosphere of peace and fraternity across the Islamic, 
independent, and free Afghanistan, God willing. Peace be upon 
you.

  [Text] The State of Kuwait and Tunisia have stressed the 
significance of implementing all the UN resolutions relating to 
the respect of the independence and sovereignty of the State of 
Kuwait, including Resolution No. 833, which embodies the 
geographical framework of the borders between the State of 
Kuwait and Iraq, and on resolving the question of the Kuwaiti 
POW's and hostages in the prisons of the Iraqi regime. 
  A joint statement released today at the end of the first 
visit to Tunisia by Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad, Kuwaiti deputy prime 
minister and foreign Minister, says that the visit of the first 
deputy prime minister and foreign minister to Tunisia stemmed 
from the fraternal relations between the peoples of the two 
countries, and the close relations which his highness the amir 
and his brother President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali have laid. 
  The statement notes that the talks between the delegations 
of 
the two countries dealt with ways of promoting bilateral 
relations and an exchange of views on Arab, Islamic, and 
international issues of mutual interest. 
  The two sides renewed their support of the peace process in 
the Middle East aimed at achieving a just and durable peace 
which ensures legitimate Arab rights. The two sides also stress 
their backing for the efforts exerted at realizing national 
reconciliation in Yemen and maintaining its unity and cohesion. 
  Regarding the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the two sides 
express their profound concern at the aggressive acts, genocide, 
and ethnic cleansing to which the unarmed people of Bosnia is 
subjected at the hands of the Serbs. The two sides demand that 
the international community shoulder its responsibility through 
an immediate implementation of the Security Council's 
resolutions, and to save a state member of the United Nations 
[as heard].

  [Text] Cairo, 26 Apr (MENA)--The UN Information Center in 
Cairo has denied that the United Nations or Secretary General 
Dr. Butrus Butrus-Ghali has any connection with a conference on 
minorities in the Arab world scheduled to be held in Cairo on 12 
May. 
  Hidayat 'Abd-al-Nabi, UN information official in Cairo, said 
Dr. Butrus-Ghali will not address the conference, adding that 
his name was associated with a conference with which he has no 
connection. 
  In a statement to MENA, 'Abd-al-Nabi said this conference is 
one among thousands of conferences held by nongovernment 
organizations and research centers. She added that the 
conference will be held under the joint auspices of the 
Ibn-Khaldun Center for Studies in Cairo and a London-based 
nongovernment organization that specializes in minority affairs. 
  'Abd-al-Nabi said the conference's name gives the impression 
that the United Nations is involved. She said that "the United 
Nations has no connection with the conference despite the title, 
which refers to the UN declaration on minority rights." 
  She added: To clarify the uproar that exploded in the media 
recently when an invitation was sent to the UN secretary 
general, the invitation did not mention the Copts of Egypt. 
  She stressed that on 12 April the UN Secretary General's 
Office declined the invitation on behalf of Butrus-Ghali.

  [Text] Here are the details of the agreement achieved by 
Israel and the PLO. Israel has consented to the Palestinian 
administration's issuing its own laissez-passers [travel 
document] featuring the term passport. The Palestinians will be 
able to print stamps under the heading -- Palestinian Authority. 
The autonomy will have its own international telephone area 
code. Israel has agreed to a temporary international presence 
in Gaza and Jericho composed of representatives of countries 
donating to the autonomy. 
  Possibilities of expanding the Palestinian powers on the 
Gaza 
coast and the al-Mawasi strip abutting on the Qatif Bloc will be 
explored. No agreement has been achieved on the Palestinian 
territorial waters. Israel refused to permit the appointment of 
a Palestinian overseer at the Rafah terminal. 
  Our correspondent adds that 'Arafat has pledged to propose 
annulling the Palestinian Covenant at the next Palestine 
National Council session. 'Arafat has further pledged to enter 
the territories as PLO chairman and not to claim any other 
title. He has not reiterated his demand to pray in Jerusalem. 
'Arafat has again promised to make an effort to forward to 
Israel additional information about its POW's and MIA's. 
  Tonight the parties will probably conclude the issues of 
prisoner release and pardon for fugitives. The committee 
planning the 4 May ceremony has already launched preparations. 
  [A related report on Jerusalem New Channel 2 Television 
Network in Hebrew at 1700 GMT on 28 April adds that "Israeli 
withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho will begin on 5 May, the day 
after the agreement is signed in Cairo."]

  [Text] Cairo, 28 Apr (MENA)--Diplomatic sources in Cairo 
have stated that Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli 
Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres agreed in their extensive talks 
in Cairo today on the need to overcome the remaining obstacles 
preventing the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho self-rule 
agreement. 
  In remarks to MENA, the sources revealed that only three 
points of difference remain to be resolved in the meeting 
expected to be held in Cairo between 'Arafat and Israeli Prime 
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin on Tuesday. The three points of 
difference relate to the size of Jericho, the Palestinian police 
presence on the Allenby Bridge, and the control of the sea area 
in Gaza. 
  The same sources told MENA that the Palestinian and Israeli 
sides have agreed on the following: 
  1. A temporary international presence in Gaza and Jericho by 
elements from countries making donations to the self-rule areas, 
as agreed upon in the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of 
Principles signed in Washington on 13 September 1993. These 
elements will work as observers and administrative staff to 
provide social and other aid, as in the case of Hebron, but the 
number of observers is yet to be determined. 
  2. Regarding the question of Palestinian passports, a travel 
document (laissez-passer) will be issued. The word passport 
will be written at the top of the document, to be followed by 
the words Palestinian Interim Self-Government Authority, 
abbreviated as PISGA. The document will be valid for three years. 
  3. It has been agreed that the border point in Rafah is to 
remain open 24 hours a day throughout the year to individuals 
and goods. The Cairo Agreement will apply at the crossing 
points. 
  4. A safe passage for the Palestinians between Gaza and 
Jericho has been agreed upon. 
  5. Regarding stamps, the sources pointed out that it has 
been agreed that stamps bearing the words Palestinian 
Self-Government Authority will be issued. 
  6. Regarding the telephone code, a certain code for the 
Palestinian self-rule areas has been designated. 
  The same sources emphasized that the two sides had agreed on 
the air space of the Palestinian Self-Government Authority in 
Gaza and Jericho. The sources added that the drafting committee 
is holding a meeting that will last until early in the morning 
to settle the question of legal jurisdiction. 
  The sources told MENA that Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on 
Peres had told 'Arafat that the Israeli troops' withdrawal from 
the self-rule areas would start the day after the agreement is 
signed in Cairo. Peres believes that there is a possibility of 
creating a new Palestinian reality, and this represents a goal 
for the State of Israel, the sources added. 
  The same sources pointed out that at the Egyptian Foreign 
Ministry this evening, small teams from the United States, 
Egypt, Israel, and the Palestinians are meeting to work out the 
arrangements for signing the agreement for implementing 
self-rule in Gaza and Jericho. Peres has commended the hard 
work of Dr. Nabil Sha'th and Major General Amnon Shahaq, heads 
of the Palestinian and Israeli delegations, noting that the two 
delegations have made a great accomplishment. 
  MENA has learned that when 'Arafat enters the self-rule 
areas 
in Gaza and Jericho, he will hold the title "Chairman of the 
Palestinian Authority." Diplomatic sources have told MENA that 
during the meetings between 'Arafat and Peres, it was agreed to 
discuss the issue of the Israeli army's MIA's and POW's. 'Arafat 
promised to exert all efforts in this regard. 
  MENA has also learned that the committees in charge of the 
actual transfer of the self-rule powers will start their work as 
of Sunday. The same sources added that Dr. Sha'th and Maj. Gen. 
Shahaq will discuss the question of the Palestinian prisoners in 
a meeting to be held tonight. They should be able to finalize 
this issue by Sunday. The sources pointed out that there is a 
general agreement on the number of prisoners and detainees to be 
released, adding that the details will be made public on Sunday. 
  Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres has stressed that the 
Palestinian and Israeli sides have reached the end of the road 
of negotiations. He added: We thought we could face and combat 
terrorism with military measures alone, but now we must create a 
new Palestinian reality, and this is the goal of the State of 
Israel.

  [Text] Cairo, April 29 (AFP)--Israeli and PLO negotiators 
have reached agreement in principle on the release of all 
Palestinian prisoners held by Israel who commit themselves to 
renouncing violence, a senior PLO official disclosed Thursday. 
  The two sides agreed that in addition to 5,000 Palestinians 
whose release had already been approved, all remaining prisoners 
would be eligible for a pardon if they pledged "in writing" to 
abandon violence and to adhere to the policies of the PLO, Nabil 
Sha'th said. 
  The offer would apply to all Palestinian prisoners 
regardless 
of their political affiliation, according to Sha'th, who is the 
Palestine Liberation Organization's chief negotiator in talks 
here with Israel. 
  The negotiations are aimed at implementing limited 
Palestinian self-rule on the Gaza Strip and in the West Bank 
town of Jericho in accordance with a Declaration of Principles 
signed by the PLO and Israel in Washington last September. 
  After months of difficult and delicate talks, PLO Chairman 
Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin are to 
sign an accord here on May 4 to launch Palestinian autonomy, 
Egyptian President Husni Mubarak announced Thursday. 
  Sha'th said Israeli-PLO contacts would continue after next 
Wednesday's signing ceremony to determine a timetable for the 
prisoner releases. He said Palestinians in the autonomous areas 
would be issued a passport by Palestinian authorities that would 
be valid for three years and would entitle them to travel to any 
country accepting the document. 
  On the question of jurisdiction in Gaza and Jericho, which 
had plagued the Cairo talks earlier this month, Sha'th reported 
that the two sides had agreed that Palestinian officials would 
exert authority "in all domains, with the exception of Israeli 
citizens, Jewish settlements and external security." 
  He said the principal outstanding issue was the scope of the 
security zones to be established around the settlements on the 
Gaza Strip. The Palestinians want to reduce the dimensions of 
the zones to a minimum, according to Sha'th, who added that 
their proposed boundaries were detailed in maps appended to an 
agreement here on February 9. The maps have not been made 
public. Other sources close to the talks said the PLO and 
Israel still had to agree on the size of the autonomous Jericho 
area and the presence of a Palestinian guard on the Allenby 
Bridge between the West Bank and Jordan. 
  In Paris Thursday Israeli and Palestinian officials also 
reached an accord on future economic relations between Israel 
and the autonomous areas. In a statement released after five 
months of arduous talks, the Israeli delegation said "all the 
obstacles have been overcome and differences settled." "The 
heads of the delegations think it is possible to reach a general 
accord on Friday which will form the basis of economic relations 
between Israeli and Palestinian authorities," the statement 
said. Details of a final economic agreement were to be worked 
on overnight ahead of a 9:30 a.m. (0730 GMT) signing ceremony 
Friday at the French foreign ministry. 
  [Paris AFP in English at 0759 on 29 April in a 
Cairo-datelined item by Marius Schattner adds the following: 
"The two remaining points to be sorted out by Rabin and 'Arafat 
would be the size of the autonomous Jericho area and the 
presence of a Palestinian guard on the Allenby Bridge between 
the West Bank and Jordan, sources close to the talks said. But 
chief PLO negotiator Nabil Sha'th said Thursday the principal 
outstanding issue was the dimension of the security zones to be 
established around Jewish settlements on the Gaza Strip."]

  [Text] Finance Minister Avraham Shohat said that the 
economic agreement scheduled to be signed in Paris this morning 
constitutes a historic breakthrough toward establishing a 
prosperous peacetime economy. Shohat told Voice of Jerusalem 
radio that the agreement was good, protected Israel's economic 
interests, and also permitted the development of a Palestinian 
economy. Shohat noted that Israel had rejected the 
Palestinians' demand for their own currency; however, the 
economic committee accompanying the negotiations would continue 
to discuss the issue until a decision acceptable to both sides 
was reached. 
  Finance Minister Shohat and Abu-al-'Ala' [Ahmad Quray'], the 
head of the PLO's economic department, will sign the agreement 
regulating economic relations between the Palestinian autonomous 
areas and Israel at a festive ceremony in Paris this morning. 
In the event of discrepancies between the Paris agreement and 
the agreement that will be signed next week in Cairo, the latter 
agreement will be considered binding by both parties.

  [Text] Paris, April 29 (AFP)--Israel and the PLO on Friday 
[29 April] signed an accord here setting out future 
Israeli-Palestinian economic relations under Palestinian 
self-rule. The accord was signed by Israeli Finance Minister 
Avraham Shohat and Ahmad Quray', head of the Palestine 
Liberation Organizations's economic department. French Foreign 
Minister Alain Juppe attended the signing ceremony. 
  In a statement, Juppe hailed "the courage and determination" 
of the two delegations which reached the accord after protracted 
negotiations which began here last November. In an eighth and 
final round of haggling Thursday, negotiators managed to agree 
on several contentious issues, notably customs tariffs. 
  "It's a good agreement which upholds Israel's economic 
interests and allows the Palestinians to develop their own 
economy," Shohat told Israeli radio in an interview from Paris 
before signing the accord. "It's a historic moment. Life 
depends on economic relations, investments, trade and improving 
living standards," he said. 
  The economic accord followed an announcement by Egyptian 
President Husni Mubarak in Cairo on Thursday that Israel and the 
PLO would next Wednesday sign an overall agreement to launch 
Palestinian self-rule. The deal covers banking, finance, 
employment, customs duties, tourism, agriculture, industry, 
energy, and insurance. The Palestinians will be able to control 
the quantity of imports and tariffs imposed on them. 
  The PLO has foregone demands for an independent central bank 
but could create its own monetary authority to control and 
monitor the banking and financial sector.

  [Excerpts] The information and study workshop on the 
prospects of the Algerian economy, organized by the presidency 
and the government and attended by government members and main 
social and economic operators, has been crowned by a 
recommendation underlining the need for a comprehensive and 
coherent program of institutional restructuring and reforms in 
order to free the initiatives of the economic operators and to 
reintroduce the market economy mechanism. [passage omitted] 
  The days proceedings of the information and study workshop 
was also characterized by the intervention of Mr. Mokdad Sifi, 
the head of government, with an address during the opening 
meeting in which he touched, in particular, on the consequences 
of the agreement our country had recently concluded with the 
IMF, which aims to insure the highest possible level of 
stability in the national economy and create the objective 
conditions to resume a continuous growth that will insure the 
alleviation and gradual elimination of all forms of imbalances 
and serious pressures at times that burden our society at the 
present. 
  The head of government pointed out in his intervention that 
resorting to rescheduling the debts of our country has come at a 
time when Algeria has become unable to face the maturity dates 
of its debts on the one hand, and to respond to the basic needs 
of its citizens and economy, on the other. This reflects the 
inevitable nature of the debt rescheduling effort. Here the 
head of government said: 
  [Begin Safi recording] This effort was impossible to avoid, 
especially when Algeria had to import the high-cost staple 
foodstuffs, which cannot be reduced, with hard currency that 
constitute a heavy burden on the foreign currency accounts of 
the country. 
  I would like to point out in this instance, so that we 
comprehend the dimensions of the country's financial 
difficulties, that we are obliged to face up to annual 
expenditures estimated at least to be three billion dollars in 
respect of the widely-consumed stuff only. And if we talk about 
the details, in respect of cereals, including hard wheat, soft 
wheat, and semolina and flour, Algeria consumes more than 3 
million tonnes annually, namely to the value of 780 million 
dollars. Thus, Algeria alone consumes about 40 percent of the 
world exports. 
  Regarding milk, Algeria consumes 400,000 tonnes worth 560 
million dollars. Algeria consumes 400,000 tonnes of oils worth 
200 million dollars. Algeria also consumes 950,000 tonnes of 
sugar worth 320 million dollars, and 120,000 tonnes of coffee 
worth 160 million dollars. Regarding medicines, it consumes a 
quantity worth 500 million dollars. Of the total value of only 
these commodities I have mentioned, Algeria is committed to 
spend an amount estimated at 2.5 billion dollars annually. In 
addition to that, the costs of imports of this type of commodity 
in the current circumstances is very high. [end recording]

  [Text] The reform plan based on the liberal system that the 
Algerian Government has approved after its agreement with the 
IMF has received extensive attention in different international 
financial circles. 
  In light of this agreement, the Algerian Government economic 
delegation led by Mr. Mourad Benachnou, the minister of 
industrial restructuring and participation, is continuing its 
talks in Washington with officials in the IMF and the World Bank 
who are meeting within the framework of their annual joint 
session. 
  The Algerian delegation's talks with the two international 
bodies are focusing on the technical aspects of the Algerian 
Government's reform plan. 
  An Algerian source in the U.S. capital explained that the 
greater part of the discussions between the two sides is 
centered on the release [tasrih] of the second part related to 
banking systems in Algeria that comprises 14 plans on budget 
correction. 
  It has become clear from these talks that the World Bank is 
prepared to grant Algeria a 200 million dollar loan to be 
invested in the field of water in Algeria. Official circles in 
both the IMF and the World Bank have told our delegation that 
they support the government reform plan. The same circles said 
they considered this plan to be an important step on the way to 
establishing Algeria's economy on sound foundations. 
  The same source says that preparations are being made for a 
new plan related to the development of the housing sector, 
adding that Mr. Mourad Benachnou's talks with World Bank 
officials was fruitful. The talks also covered how to deal with 
the problems of unemployment by relying on experiments that were 
tried in other countries. This would encourage the private 
sector to play its role in step with the expansion and promotion 
of the activities of the productive sectors. 
  The Algerian delegation's talks will continue tomorrow, 
Thursday, with a sector by sector review of the economic plan in 
order to obtain support for the reform plan from the World Bank.

  [Text] Cairo, 28 Apr (MENA)--Israeli Foreign Minister 
Shim'on Peres has expressed his belief that it is possible to 
reach an agreement this evening with the Palestinian side on 
resolving certain pending issues that have not yet been solved. 
He noted that there are other issues that will be negotiated 
after signing the agreement between the Palestinian and Israeli 
parties on implementing self-rule in Gaza and Jericho. 
  Regarding the Israeli-Syrian track, Peres stressed that 
Israel is serious about withdrawal from the Golan, although the 
size and limits of this withdrawal have not been determined. 
This came in a joint news conference held by Peres and U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher at noon today following 
their talks at the U.S. Embassy in Cairo. 
  Discussing the Palestinian track, Peres said that it is 
possible to solve all pending issues this evening to open the 
way for signing an agreement on implementing Palestinian 
self-rule in Gaza and Jericho. He noted that the issues that 
will be left for negotiations after signing the agreement 
pertain to registration of papers, mail, telephones, naming and 
defining the powers of authorities, security issues, and two 
issues relating to legal jurisdiction. 
  Regarding the Golan, Peres said that the size and limits of 
Israeli withdrawal from the Golan must be part of the 
negotiations. He noted that Warren Christopher may help to bring 
the Syrian and Israeli views closer. 
  Christopher pointed out that he met with Palestinian 
President Yasir 'Arafat this morning and that he made sure that 
the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations were making progress, 
although there are still certain issues that have not yet been 
settled. He said: "I want to emphasize that the Israelis and 
their Palestinian neighbors have some concerns about the 
future." He said that both the Israeli and Palestinian parties 
have recently suffered tragedies. This increases the importance 
of the role Peres and his colleagues are playing. He expressed 
his appreciation for the Israeli foreign minister and the 
negotiating team for their ceaseless search for peace. He 
voiced his hope that these endeavors will be capped with 
success. He stressed that establishing peace is the best thing 
to confront terrorism. 
  Peres praised Christopher's persistent efforts to help 
achieve peace in the Middle East. He said: "I believe that 
these efforts are extremely important, particularly because we 
are coming close to the end of the negotiations with the 
Palestinians." He said: "The U.S. secretary of state's 
participation is important and is of considerable help to us." 
He noted that certain important issues remain to be discussed 
in the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, noting that the 
negotiators need support and backing from the U.S. secretary of 
state, Yasir 'Arafat, and our friends in Egypt so that they may 
reach results. He said: "We are meeting in Cairo today to 
reach solutions to pending issues." 
  Responding to a question on negotiations with Syria and what 
Israel will offer, Peres said: "We said, Prime Minister Rabin 
and I, that we are ready to withdraw from the Golan Heights or 
withdraw within the area. We did not define the limits or size 
of this withdrawal because this must be part of the 
negotiations." He added: "We believe that Christopher can 
bring both parties closer. "He expressed confidence that 
Christopher will bring closer the Israeli and Syrian parties and 
will take into account "all issues" and not only territory. He 
noted that these issues include security and the nature of 
peace. He said that general peace from a comprehensive 
perspective must involve all parties including the Palestinians. 
  Peres said: We are serious regarding Syria. We want to 
achieve peace with Syria. Peace will not be comprehensive until 
it includes solving the problems with Syria. Peres expressed 
the belief that "there is no difference between the U.S. and 
Israeli aims toward peace in the region." 
  Asked about the Palestinian-Israeli talks, Warren 
Christopher 
said: The basic issue now is helping the sides to reach an 
agreement. This is what we are working to achieve today. As 
the two sides have stated, they are very close to reaching this 
agreement. Once the agreement is ready, there will be a signing 
ceremony. 
  Christopher said that the most important thing is that this 
agreement should enter the implementation phase. Commenting on 
Christopher's remarks, Peres said: There are some outstanding 
issues that we will discuss later today in an attempt to reach 
an agreement on them. 
  Asked about Iran, Christopher expressed his "extreme anger" 
about the terrorism that Iran is planning, not only in the 
Middle East but also in other areas. He said: I believe this 
is one of the reasons the United States does not deal with Iran 
the way it cooperates with other states from the standpoint of 
giving them special economic privileges. 
  Christopher added: We will not cooperate with the Iranians 
in this domain until they improve their behavior in various 
ways. He explained that this includes support for the peace 
process in the Middle East, which Iran rejects. He expressed 
the belief that "Iran deserves to be isolated." 
  On Britain's stand on Iran, Christopher said he is not aware 
of any British plans toward Iran. However, he noted that he was 
in London recently. He believes Britain shares his concern 
regarding Iran. 
  The talks between Christopher and Peres were held at the 
U.S. 
Embassy in Cairo. They began with a separate meeting between 
Christopher and Peres, who were later joined by the members of 
the U.S. and Israeli delegations. The talks lasted 90 minutes.

  [Text] President Husni Mubarak, Palestinian President Yasir 
'Arafat, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, and 
Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres held a news conference at 
the end of their meeting at the Presidential Palace in 
Heliopolis today. President Mubarak made a statement at the 
beginning of the conference. He noted that today's meeting was 
good. He said: I met first with U.S. Secretary of State 
Christopher and then with President 'Arafat, and the Israeli 
foreign minister. He added: The four of us then held a lengthy 
meeting together, during which we discussed numerous issues that 
are still unresolved. Indeed, we found solutions for some of 
these issues but certain small issues that may prove difficult 
remain unresolved. These issues, he said, will be discussed and 
resolved in the next two days. He noted that 'Arafat and 
Israeli Prime Minister Rabin will meet before signing the 
agreement because two issues must be resolved by the two 
leaders. He said: I hope they will succeed and I proposed that 
they sign the agreement in Cairo on 4 May. The two sides agreed 
on this. He said that the two parties also agreed that 'Arafat 
and Rabin will meet on 3 May. He said: I asked Secretary 
Christopher to postpone his work in Europe and to stay in the 
region to attend this meeting. He said: We are all aware of 
the U.S. role in advancing the peace process. 
  Secretary Christopher then made a statement in which he 
thanked President Mubarak. He said: We held a good meeting 
during which tangible progress in major issues was achieved. He 
said: I am touched by both parties' interest in quickly finding 
solutions to their problems and starting to implement the 
agreement. He added: I agreed to stay until 3 and 4 May, the 
date for signing the agreement and I am happy that the two 
parties set 4 May as a specific date to sign the agreement on 
implementing the Declaration of Principles. He thanked 
President Mubarak and expressed his appreciation for the role he 
played during the protracted talks at the end of which the two 
sides were persuaded to set a date to sign the agreement. 
  President 'Arafat then made a statement in which he thanked 
President Mubarak and Secretary Christopher. Here President 
Mubarak remarked: I thank you both. 'Arafat said: I thank 
you, U.S. President Bill Clinton, and Secretary Christopher for 
what we achieved today. He added: We hope that we will achieve 
a tangible result of substance, as you have said, to offer to 
our two peoples. 
  Peres made a statement in which he thanked President Mubarak 
and the U.S. Secretary of State for their participation in and 
support for the peace process to put an end to a long journey 
and usher in the start of a new journey in relations between the 
Palestinians and Israelis and to take a new step on the path 
toward peace in the Middle East. 
  Responding to a question on the pending issues and the 
others 
on which agreement was reached, President 'Arafat said: Wait 
and see. Peres commented saying: The two points involve the 
size of Jericho and security at the crossing points, adding that 
'Arafat and Rabin will discuss these points at their meeting. 
Christopher remarked: There are also other issues. Peres 
said: Yes, but these are the two points that Rabin and 'Arafat 
will decide how to settle. 
  In response to a question on whether this would mean 
reaching 
an agreement on other issues such as registration, Peres said 
that there are still certain secondary issues that will be 
discussed today and tomorrow, adding: We hope that we will 
settle them. 
  In reply to a question on the steps that can be taken to 
motivate the peace process on the Syrian track and on the new 
ideas he is bringing to the two sides to return to the 
negotiating table and bring about Israeli withdrawal from the 
Golan, Christopher said: Regarding efforts to advance the peace 
process, I believe that the parties will consider what is 
happening here and will listen to President Mubarak's statement 
that there is a specific date for signing the implementation of 
the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles, which in 
itself would generate considerable momentum. He said: I will 
meet with the Israeli prime minister tomorrow and I hope that 
the facilities that I will be able to achieve during these two 
meetings will generate new momentum. I hope that you are aware 
that our current role does not allow us to disclose more details. 
  Responding to a question on his feelings about security in 
Egypt, particularly in view of the presence of four leaders and 
of the upcoming date of a meeting to sign the agreement in 
Cairo, Christopher said: I have learned that the current 
situation in Egypt is encouraging. President Mubarak told me 
that tourists are coming back to Egypt in large numbers. I 
believe that this is a strong indication that the convoy is 
proceeding on the right path under the leadership of President 
Mubarak.

<F P=106> [Report on telephone interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on </F>
Peres, in Cairo, by Mikha Friedman and Ge'ula Even, in Tel Aviv, 
on 29 April -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Friedman] We will now carry large segments of an 
interview we conducted earlier this morning with Foreign 
Minister Shim'on Peres, who is currently in Cairo. Our first 
question to Peres was about the myriad symbols of sovereignty 
Israel was prepared to grant the Palestinians: a stamp, 
passport, international dialing zone, strong police force, 
legislative assembly. Did you know, we asked Peres, that this 
was the only autonomy in the world with all these attributes? 
  [Peres] No, it is not the only case. There are not many 
autonomous areas in the world. I think that there are only one 
or two. Each autonomy has its own logic. The autonomous areas 
I am familiar with have passports and stamps. There is nothing 
unique about this. 
  [Friedman] The question is whether this autonomy's internal 
logic indicates that this is the embryo of the future 
Palestinian state? 
  [Peres] I do not know what you mean by the term logic. I 
only know that we are leaving the Gaza Strip without any 
intention of ever returning. I do not know what we have to look 
for in Gaza. You know, we also have to put things in clear 
perspective. There are 800,000 people in the Gaza Strip. Do we 
want to give them Israeli passports? Do we seek to prevent them 
from travelling abroad? Why? We therefore came up with a very 
original solution. We agreed on laissez-passers and passports 
for a period of three years; or in other words, until the 
implementation of the permanent arrangement. I think this is an 
elegant solution. Look, we should not be niggardly about 
insignificant things. What do we want? What is all this talk 
about signs of sovereignty? 
  [Friedman] Up until yesterday, Israel was very adamant about 
these issues. 
  [Peres] Who told you that? 
  [Friedman] Is this not true? Was Israel prepared to give 
the Palestinians all this from the very beginning? 
  [Peres] Excuse me. The decision on this was reached in 
Israel before I left for Cairo. I made no concessions here. We 
carefully considered what had to be done and I believe we found 
a unique, original, and fair solution. 
  [Friedman] I expressly asked whether this was the embryonic 
Palestinian state. You know that there are many Israelis who 
fear this demon [last word in English]? 
  [Peres] Is it preferable to annex these areas to Israel? We 
have decided to begin negotiations on the permanent arrangement 
in two years. These negotiations have to end within a year. We 
agreed to the issuing of Palestinian laissez-passers for a 
period of three years. I admit that we were a little bit 
generous. Why not? This still does not constitute a decision 
either on a Palestinian state or on the permanent arrangement. 
This agreement, which is totally unique to the best of my 
knowledge, deals entirely with an interim period. 
  [Even] Mr. Peres, I do not know if you have been updated on 
this but Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu has described this 
agreement as Israel's biggest political defeat ever. Other 
right-wing figures voiced similar reactions. 
  [Peres] I want to tell you that this constitutes tremendous 
progress. He has already warned about unprecedented political 
defeats in the past. We are advancing from defeat to defeat. 
What has Binyamin Netanyahu ever achieved? What did the Likud 
achieve during its 15 years in the Gaza Strip? Damage, blood, 
shame, and disgrace. What else? What does he mean by defeat? 
Does he want to remain in the Gaza Strip? What solutions does 
he propose for the refugees, poverty, terrorism, assassinations, 
hatred? What are these empty statements? Anyone can just quote 
words from the encyclopedia. I think that this is a brave and 
fair step. 
  [Even] The question is whether we were not in too much of a 
hurry to sign the agreement without tying up some very important 
loose ends. 
  [Peres] I do not understand what we were supposed to wait 
for. For more terrorist attacks? I think that Israel must use 
a stick and carrot approach in its war against terrorism. 
Although we still have our stick we have dropped the carrot. 
One cannot quash terrorism with just a stick. We unequivocally 
have no interest in running the Gaza Strip. We therefore took 
the appropriate steps. What would we have gained from dragging 
things out another year? We would have just had more soldiers 
acting as policemen in the Gaza Strip with daily television 
coverage of children throwing stones at them while mothers were 
quaking in fear. What for? 
  [Friedman] Mr. Peres, there are two contradictory statements 
which you may be able to square. One of them is the assessment 
by the director of the Shin Bet according to which the IDF's 
[Israel Defense Forces] withdrawal from the Gaza Strip will 
precipitate a massacre. The second statement came from Hamas 
[Islamic Resistance Movement] who said it would not sabotage the 
agreement between the PLO and Israel. Which of these 
assessments do you lean toward? 
  [Peres] I want to make this very clear. Ben-Gurion said 
that all the experts were very knowledgeable about the past. 
There are no experts on future developments. Anyone who 
purports to be an expert about future developments is taking an 
unnecessary risk. However, I think that an agreement that is 
equitable both in form and content on the Gaza Strip will 
greatly help in reducing the level of hatred, and perhaps also 
violence. I do not see any alternatives. As for the future, 
time will tell. No one knows which forces will seize control or 
demonstrate their presence. It is crystal clear, however, that 
the Palestinians now have an interest in managing a tangible 
reality through administrative, not violent, measures. The 
alternative to administration is brute violence. 
  [Friedman] You met U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher in Cairo yesterday. Christopher has already arrived 
in Israel, ostensibly to promote the Syrian-Israeli track. On 
arrival, however, he somewhat discouragingly stated that he did 
not anticipate significant progress on this track. 
  [Peres] No progress will be made without clear and 
intelligent decisions. If anyone thinks that anything can be 
achieved by stuttering or demagoguery then they are wrong. 
  [Friedman] Mr. Peres, I left the most sensitive question for 
last. Do you think that the agreement you reached with 'Arafat, 
according to which the PLO promised to immediately deliver any 
information it receives on the Israeli POW's and MIA's to the 
Israeli Government, will satisfy Yona Baumel, the father of MIA 
Zekharya Baumel, who called you a traitor this week? 
  [Peres] That is something I cannot tell you. I only know 
that both the prime minister and myself have done our best with 
regard to this sensitive issue. We all belong to the same 
family. I can certainly understand the feelings of the Baumel 
family; however, I can also say that we did absolutely 
everything possible. I would like to take this opportunity to 
say that I appealed to the Egyptian president who agreed that 
Egypt would continue to help in the search for the bodies of 
Israeli pilots and soldiers who fell on Egyptian soil. I know 
that this issue is also very sensitive and important to the 
families and to all Israelis. We will never forget the people 
who risked their lives, fell in battle, or have been missing in 
action since then. This is the responsibility of the State of 
Israel and its government, and we will continue to exert serious 
efforts in this regard and tenaciously pursue this issue. 
  [Friedman] Thank you, Foreign Minister Peres in Cairo.

  [Text] Cairo, 27 Apr (MENA)--The security agencies have 
announced that the killing of a detective earlier today was 
caused by indiscriminate gunfire resulting from a vendetta 
between certain families. The gunfire occurred as voters were 
going to cast their ballots in elections for the People's 
Assembly members. 
  A security source stressed that at about 0820 today 
Lieutenant Colonel Ahmad Sulayman was driving in a government 
vehicle belonging to the Housing Directorate accompanied by a 
four-man force, a detective, and a sentry along the al-'Iqal 
al-Bahri road. Another vehicle with an officer and four 
soldiers happened to be driving behind the first vehicle. The 
two cars came under indiscriminate gunfire, forcing the soldiers 
in the back vehicle to return fire. The government vehicle 
swerved and fell into a canal. Detective 'Atiyah was killed and 
soldiers Jum'ah Makram Hasanayn, Muhammad Fathi Ahmad, Jamal 
Makram Kamil, and sentry Muhammad Hasan Darwish were slightly 
injured in the crash.

  [Text] The People's Assembly will resume its meetings today 
under the chairmanship of the speaker, Dr. Fathi Surur. In last 
night's session, the Assembly ratified the foreign currency 
bill. Under the new law, all individuals and corporations will 
be allowed to retain all their foreign currency earnings [rather 
than convert it into Egyptian pounds]. 
  Assembly members stressed that this law will boost 
confidence 
in the Egyptian economy, encourage foreign and domestic 
investment, and stimulate the national economy. 
  Mahmud Muhammad Mahmud, minister of economy and foreign 
trade, told the Assembly that the law will benefit both 
importers and exporters. The minister added that the $16 
billion that the Central Bank has in reserves measure the extent 
of the success of the country's economic policy. There is an 
oversupply of foreign exchange in Egypt and the new law will 
help bring about a balance between the supply and demand for 
foreign currency, Minister Mahmud stated.

  [Text] At a time when preparations are under way for a 
meeting between Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa and Sudanese 
Foreign Minister Dr. Husayn Abu-Talib, differences have again 
arisen over the Hala'ib triangle after the Sudanese Government 
has granted development projects there to foreign companies. 
Moreover, the Sudanese Government has appointed officials to 
administer the region, moved some military units closer to the 
border, and set up a center headed by a number of senior 
officers from the Military Operations Department. 
  Diplomatic sources have noted that the Sudanese measures 
conflict with the agreement that the two foreign ministers 
reached on the sidelines of the Arab League meeting last month. 
That agreement stipulates that neither side shall take any 
measures that might jeopardize the negotiations on resolving the 
crisis over Hala'ib. 
  The new Sudanese moves have surprised the Egyptian 
Government, especially since the Sudanese Government has 
expressed its readiness to accept the Egyptian documents on the 
dispute. The Sudanese Government had previously rejected these 
documents, claiming they were forged British documents. 
  Sudan's flexibility toward Hala'ib came after Egypt 
expressed 
its opposition to any attempt for secession in southern Sudan. 
In a telephone conversation with [Sudanese President] 'Umar 
al-Bashir, President Mubarak said Egypt would do its utmost to 
prevent the south from seceding from the north. 
  Meanwhile, Syria is continuing to mediate between Cairo and 
Khartoum. It is trying to increase the meetings between 
Egyptian and Sudanese officials and to bridge the differences in 
their views.

  [Text] Cairo, 28 Apr (MENA)--Rwanda's Trade, Industry, and 
Crafts Minister, Justin Mugenzi, arrived in Cairo early this 
morning on a visit to Egypt of several days. 
  The Rwandan minister said he would meet President Husni 
Mubarak, in his capacity as chairman of the OAU, to discuss the 
current critical situation in Rwanda following the death of 
Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana and the attacks carried 
out by the rebel Rwandan National Front. 
  The Rwandan minister said he would also explain to President 
Mubarak the failure to honor the Arusha Peace Agreement signed 
on 4 August 1993 and the violation of international accords and 
the principle of good-neighborliness by our neighboring state of 
Uganda. 
  He noted that what matters now is for the international 
public and the OAU to realize the role the Ugandan president is 
playing toward Rwanda and the extent of his material and moral 
influence. 
  The Rwandan president explained that he will brief President 
Mubarak on the UN role in supervising the implementation of the 
peace agreements in his country and will discuss the effects the 
UN Security Council resolutions will have on the UN mission in 
Rwanda. 
  He said he will seek President Mubarak's help to stop the 
violence and massacres in his country and restore stability and 
security.

  [Text] Nouakchott, 28 Apr -- Mauritania has stressed today 
her "supportive stance vis-a-vis the independence of the State 
of Kuwait and her sovereignty over her internationally 
recognized boundaries according to the international Resolution 
No. 833" and demanded a settlement to the issue of the Kuwaiti 
POW's and detainees in the Iraqi prisons. 
  A joint communique released here at the end of the visit by

Mauritanian, have discussed the overall developments at the Arab 
and Islamic arena. 
  On the other hand, Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad hailed the results 
of his visit to Mauritania and described it as "successful and 
fruitful." 
  This remark was made in an interview by Shaykh Sabah 
al-Ahmad 
with the Mauritanian information media before his departure from 
Nouakchott for Rabat. 
  Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad said the visit has paved the way for 
building strong and solid relations between the two countries. 
  The two sides called for serious efforts to cleanse the Arab 
air and overcome the obstacles that prevent the strengthening 
and consolidating Arab and Islamic solidarity. They expressed 
their commitment to the Arab League and UN charters, and their 
respect for the territorial integrity and regional security of 
states. 
  The statement said that the two sides expressed their 
support 
for the Middle East peace process on the basis of land for peace 
and the international resolutions calling for the restoration of 
all Arab rights, particularly the Palestinian people's right to 
regain their land and self-determination. 
  The statement added that the two sides expressed their hope 
that the brothers in Yemen would reach a solution that would 
please everyone and safeguard Yemen's territorial integrity and 
stability. 
  Regarding the situation in Somalia, the two sides expressed 
their hope that a settlement would be reached that would 
safeguard Somalia's sovereignty and territorial safety. 
  In their statement, the two sides called on the 
international 
community to find a quick solution to the problem of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, and expressed their condemnation of the 
attacks by Serb gangs to which the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
were exposed. 
  The statement pointed out that the Kuwaiti first deputy 
prime 
minister and foreign minister had extended and invitation to 
Mohamed Ould Lekhal, the Mauritanian foreign affairs and 
cooperation minister, to visit the State of Kuwait that was 
accepted by the Mauritanian minister, and that Shaykh Sabah had 
expressed his gratitude for the hospitality and honor he was 
accorded during his visit to Mauritania.

<F P=106> [Report by Sulayman Nimr: "Gulf States Studying </F>
`Declaration of Principles' Proposed by United States for 
Multilaterals"] 
  [Text] London -- Experts from the foreign ministries of 
the Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] states discussed at a meeting 
in Riyadh yesterday a draft statement proposed by the United 
States for the multilateral negotiations in the Middle East. It 
is called the "declaration of principles" statement. The U.S. 
Administration submitted it for approval by the participating 
states during the multilateral negotiations steering committee 
meetings in Ottawa on 6 February. The proposed declaration lays 
the foundations for the shape of political and economic 
cooperations among Middle Eastern states. 
  The meeting of the Gulf foreign ministries' experts was held 
to discuss developments in the multilaterals and the meetings of 
their five committees and ways of coordinating positions in this 
connection. 
  The Sultanate of Oman last week hosted the meetings of the 
water committee arising from these negotiations. Qatar is 
scheduled to host the arms control committee meetings next 
Monday. And Bahrain has offered to host the environment 
committee meetings scheduled to held next fall. 
  The GCC states showed interest in the draft "declaration of 
principles" proposed by the United States because of the clauses 
related to political conditions in Middle Eastern states and the 
future of relations among them; the declaration urges working 
"to develop a view of what the region will be like after the 
achievement of peace at the bilateral level, and to develop the 
regional institutions which the region might need." Gulf states 
are concerned that this statement might impose on it material 
and political obligations they do not need. This is why despite 
their participation in the meetings of the multilateral 
committees, they do not want any future obligations to be 
imposed on them. Hence the experts' meetings in Riyadh are 
important to the foreign ministers. 
  As is known, Gulf experts for the multilaterals met on 26 
March and sent a report containing their view to their foreign 
ministers during their meetings in the Saudi capital in the 
first week of this month. The ministers decided that the 
experts should meet again.

<F P=106> [Report by Hasin al-Bunyan: "Gulf Reservations About U.S. </F>
Draft for Multilaterals"] 
  [Text] Riyadh -- U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher will meet tomorrow with the foreign ministers of the 
Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] states at the GCC General 
Secretariat. 
  Well-informed sources have told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that Gulf 
ministers will discuss with Christopher the proposed draft for a 
"declaration of principles" of states participating in the 
multilateral negotiations, which lays the foundations for the 
shape of political and economic cooperation between the states 
of the region. 
  The United States submitted this draft to the GCC states 
during the meeting of the multilateral negotiations steering 
committee, which convened in Ottawa, Canada, in February. Under 
secretaries of the GCC foreign ministries met in Riyadh at the 
beginning of the week to discuss this draft. They reached a 
joint formula in this connection. The ministers will discuss 
this formula with Christopher when they meet with him tomorrow. 
  AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has learned that some GCC states have 
reservations about some clauses in the proposed U.S. draft, 
especially those related to the pledge to establish democracy 
and party pluralism and encourage individual and collective 
freedoms. 
  In addition to GCC Secretary General Shaykh Fahim Bin-Sultan 
al-Qasimi, the meeting will be attended by the foreign ministers 
of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Qatar, and 
the Sultanate of Oman. It will not be attended by Shaykh Sabah 
al-Ahmad, Kuwaiti first deputy prime minister and foreign 
minister, who is on a tour of the Maghreb states. Kuwait will 
be represented at the meeting by 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Dakhil, 
minister of state for cabinet affairs, planning minister, and 
acting foreign minister. 
  The "declaration of principles" proposed for the 
multilaterals in the Middle East region stipulates laying down 
basic principles to govern relations among regional parties in 
the region, establishing full relations, and reinforcing 
regional cooperation and economic development with Israel's 
participation under the plan to achieve reconciliation; a just, 
secure, comprehensive, and lasting peace; and mutual trust among 
all parties in the Middle East region. 
  Muscat recently hosted the meetings of the water committee 
arising from these negotiations. Qatar is scheduled to host the 
arms control committee meetings next Monday. Bahrain too has 
offered to host the environment committee meetings next fall.

  [Text] Kuwait City, 26 Apr. (KUNA) -- An authoritative 
source from the Foreign Ministry today denied a report published 
by the London-based AL-HAYAH on the existence of Algerian good 
offices to clear the atmosphere between Kuwait and Iraq, on an 
alleged meeting between Kuwaiti and Iraqi delegations at an Arab 
embassy, and on a linkage between these allegations and [Foreign 
Minister] Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jabir's current tour of 
sisterly Arab states in North Africa. In a statement to KUNA, 
the source also expressed Kuwait's rejection of any linkage 
between Shaykh Sabah's tour with the message sent by the 
president of the Iraqi regime to the Algerian head of state. 
  The source said that "while Kuwait denies the report 
published by the London-based AL-HAYAH, it would like to 
emphasize that Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad's tour of sisterly Arab 
states aims to bolster relations between Kuwait and these 
states. It also falls within Kuwait's policy of aiming to 
consolidate ties between Arab brothers to strengthen the Arab 
stance." The source also indicated that Kuwait's relations with 
Iraq are governed by the UN resolutions that Iraq must adhere to 
instead of pursuing blatant attempts to flout them and refusing 
to implement them. 
  In today's edition, AL-HAYAH published a report which it 
attributed to a source close to the Algerian Foreign Ministry 
who stated that "Algerian endeavors are being made to clear the 
atmosphere among Arab brothers." The paper reported that the 
source "did not rule out the possibility of Algerian mediation 
between Kuwait and Iraq." The paper added that reliable sources 
had disclosed to AL-HAYAH that "a Kuwaiti delegation has held a 
meeting with an Iraqi delegation at an Arab embassy."

<F P=106> [Statement by Saudi Arabian Foreign Minister Sa'ud al-Faysal </F>
al Sa'ud--read by announcer] 
  [Text] Saudi Foreign Minister Sa'ud al-Faysal al Sa'ud and 
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher held a news 
conference at King Khalid international airport prior to Mr. 
Christopher's departure from Riyadh last night. 
  It is a source of our pleasure to host today the meeting 
with 
U.S. Secretary of State Christopher and their excellencies the 
foreign ministers of the Gulf Cooperation Council states [GCC]. 
  The GCC and the U.S. have a long history of firmly 
established relations. The most prominent of its 
characteristics is the close cooperation to achieve regional 
peace and security in the interest of all states of the region. 
  During our talks, we reviewed with Christopher our common 
positions regarding the threat which Iraq still poses to 
regional security. We agreed on a common, firm, and vigilant 
stand toward Iraq to ensure the full implementation of UN 
sanctions in accordance with the Security Council resolutions, 
particularly Resolution 833 on the demarcation of borders 
between the state of Kuwait and Iraq. Christopher also 
reaffirmed, on behalf of the American President, America's 
commitment to defend the Gulf. This commitment is appreciated 
by all the GCC states. 
  The two sides expressed their utmost appreciation for the 
efforts made by the United Arab Emirates and which are aimed at 
solving the crisis of the three islands, Greater and Lesser Tunb 
and Abu Musa, with the Islamic Republic of Iran. The two sides 
also asked the Islamic Republic of Iran to enter serious 
negotiations with the United Arab Emirates with a view to 
reaching a peaceful solution to the issue of the three islands 
in accordance with international law and the principle of 
peaceful coexistence between states. 
  Christopher presented the GCC foreign ministers with a 
resume 
on the progress of the peace process and the objectives of his 
visit to the region. 
  The states of the region reaffirmed their full support of 
the 
peaceful settlement through negotiations. In this respect the 
ministers noted with satisfaction the progress that have taken 
place in the Palestinian-Israeli accord, stressing once again 
the need for speeding up the implementation of that accord. The 
ministers also pledged to continue their tireless efforts to 
back up the negotiations and the agreements that are reached at 
in the other courses, and their effective participation in the 
multilateral talks. One of the multilateral meetings had been 
held in the Gulf area and another meeting is on the way to be 
held in the area. 
  The GCC foreign ministers see that all parties have to exert 
every possible effort to ensure the progress of the peace 
process. 
  The ministers condemn terrorism anywhere in the world and 
stress the need to abandon extremism which threatens the peace 
process. 
  The ministers appreciate the efforts of President Clinton 
and 
the U.S. Secretary of State aiming at underpinning the 
Arab-Israeli peace. 
  The ministers are looking forward to the day when a new 
chapter will be opened in the Middle East and the comprehensive 
and just peace be realized to all peoples of the region. 
  Regarding events in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the ministers 
expressed their sincere appreciation of the firm stance taken by 
the U.S. and their wish that this stance would continue until a 
peaceful solution is reached.

<F P=106> [Report on news conference by Saudi Arabian Foreign Minister </F>
Sa'ud al-Faysal Al Sa'ud and U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher in Riyadh on 28 April] 
  [Text] In reply to a question on whether he had discussed 
with the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques the project for the 
extension of the telecommunications network in the Kingdom and 
whether one of the U.S. companies had won the deal, the U.S. 
Secretary of State said: I did not discuss this matter with the 
King and I am certain that the matter will be examined carefully 
here in Saudi Arabia. I am also certain that the government 
will seriously study the bid made by U.S. IT&amp;T. 
  Foreign Minister Sa'ud al-Faysal Al Sa'ud replied to a 
question on whether he had received a pledge from the American 
side to speed up the Middle East peace process and said: As Mr. 
Christopher has noted, they are endeavoring on this path and the 
U.S. is hoping and is determined to contribute in speeding up 
the implementation of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement and in 
pushing forward the other processes. 
  Prince al-Faysal was asked about the outcome of the 
discussions on the Arab-Israeli peace talks in the other 
processes. In reply he said that the Custodian of the Two Holy 
Mosques told Secretary Christopher that he hoped that during his 
current visit to the states in the region, progress would be 
achieved and that serious and persistent efforts would be made 
toward a just and comprehensive solution in the Syrian process. 
He also reaffirmed the need to advance on the Lebanese process. 
  Asked if he was prepared to lift the boycott of Israel the 
Saudi Foreign Minister said: Yes. We have discussed the 
question of the boycott and as you know this issue was reviewed 
within the framework of the Arab League. We expect and we hope 
that progress will be made in this respect after the 
implementation of the Declaration of Principles. We also hope 
that this will take place after progress has been made in the 
other processes of the talks. 
  Moreover, Christopher replied to a question on the foreign 
ministers' meeting in Europe next week on Bosnia and whether he 
had discussed the matter with Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev 
yesterday and whether he had any reaction to a report released 
in Geneva today on the situation in Gorazde and he said: The 
contact group must be given the necessary time to explore the 
matter with the various sides but only after they are given the 
opportunity which will enable them to do that. He indicated 
that the contact group would present a report to the foreign 
ministers of the countries concerned. He added: We discussed 
this issue in general terms yesterday and we wanted to give the 
contact group, which has links with many sides, the opportunity 
to explore the matter but as soon as possible. We will move 
quickly to start the talks on Thursday and Friday. He expressed 
the hope to see this take place at the appropriate time in the 
near future. He indicated that this was the moment which would 
give the opportunity to achieve some progress in the context of 
NATO's clear success in Gorazde. 
  Responding to a question on the lifting of sanctions on 
Iraq, 
Secretary Christopher said: I believe that the statement I have 
made is self-explanatory on this subject. However I can say 
that I believe that when the Security Council member states see 
that Iraq is not complying with the resolutions and the existing 
sanctions, these states will realize the importance of 
maintaining these sanctions. I also believe that it is high 
time the U.S. and all those interested in the situation in Iraq 
stood together to prevent Iraq from getting the impression that 
there will be any easing of the sanctions. 
  Responding to another question, Foreign Minister Sa'ud 
al-Faysal Al Sa'ud said: I would also like to refer you to a 
statement made by the Gulf Cooperation Council on the subject 
and which I read at the beginning. Moreover, I would like to 
say that these sanctions, in our opinion, are an integral part 
and Iraq must commit itself to implement all the Security 
Council resolutions, particularly the resolution on the 
recognition of the Iraqi-Kuwait borders which is considered to 
be the core of the conflict. We do not wish to see a repetition 
of this conflict in our region. Thus, we must ensure that this 
point in the UN resolutions is fully implemented; and we would 
also like to ensure that what is going to be implemented is not 
only related to the issue of weapons mentioned in the 
resolutions. 
  I also reaffirm what Secretary Christopher has said to the 
effect that this common stand which we are adopting is not a 
hostile stand toward the Iraqi people but it is a stand aimed at 
ensuring that the conflict is not repeated in the future between 
Iraq and the countries in the region, as this would cause 
further pain to the people of Iraq and the peoples of the 
region. If anybody is responsible for the situation in which 
the people of Iraq find themselves, the government of Iraq is 
certainly responsible. In a nutshell, the UN resolutions deal 
very clearly with the humanitarian aspects; therefore, the 
government of Iraq is entirely responsible. 
  Asked whether he has discussed with Gulf ministers the 
situation in Yemen, Secretary Christopher said: Yes, during my 
meeting with the GCC ministers and during my meeting with King 
Fahd the situation in Yemen was discussed. The ministers and 
King Fahd insisted on the need for the two parties concerned in 
Yemen to resolve their disputes for the sake of peace in the 
region. The Saudi foreign minister might want to add something 
to that. 
  At this point, Prince Sa'ud al-Faysal spoke and said: Thank 
you. I believe that our two positions reflect our hope that all 
disputes, whatever they may be, are resolved through 
negotiations and talks. Furthermore, many Arab and other sides 
are intervening in this respect and we hope that these disputes 
will be resolved peacefully and amicably within the framework of 
Yemen's unity.

  [Text] The Yemeni House of Representatives has called on 
the Defense Ministry and the Armed Forces Command to abandon the 
use of force immediately and abide by the instructions of the 
legitimate authorities. The House issued a statement saying 
that its members and the rest of the nation denounce the use of 
force and all those responsible, directly or indirectly, for 
fanning the flames of sedition among the sons of the same nation. 
  A responsible source at the Yemeni Defense Ministry says 
that 
Yemen will only overcome the complications created by the 
fighting in 'Imran camp, north of Sanaa, through solidarity 
among all patriotic and democratic forces concerned for the 
country's safety and unity. 
  Reports speak of more fighting between rival army factions 
at 
a military base situated north of Sanaa. Tank battles erupted 
between forces loyal to Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih 
and Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bayd in what was described as 
the worse fighting in Yemen's history since its unification four 
years ago. The outcome of the fighting is still unclear, but 
reports say that about 30 tanks were destroyed and other tanks 
were captured. Hundreds were reportedly killed or wounded. 
  The Aden-based South Military Command has issued a call for 
an immediate end to the fighting, warning that fighting may 
spill over to other parts of the country, raising the prospect 
of a destructive civil war.

  [Excerpt] Independent sources have said that more than 100 
people have been killed and 200 others wounded in the clashes 
that took place in 'Imran, north of Sanaa, on Wednesday and 
Thursday [27 and 28 April] between the northern and southern 
armored units. 
  So far, no official count of casualties has been announced. 
Initial reports issued by the Defense Ministry in Sanaa noted

latest reports from Sanaa noted that artillery clashes and tank 
battles continued yesterday following the failure of the 
cease-fire reached Wednesday evening. Independent sources said

  [Text] An official security source at the Interior Ministry 
has told the Yemeni News Agency, SABA', that at 1345 today 
brother Dr. Hasan Muhammad Makki, the first deputy prime 
minister, was the target of a sinful assassination attempt. 
According to initial investigations, five attackers driving two 
Toyota cars blocked the path of the brother first deputy prime 
minister's car as it was driving along (?al-Mathar) Street in 
front of the Ministry of Local Administration. They opened fire 
on his car with automatic weapons, wounding him in the shoulder 
and leg. Three of his escorts were fatally wounded. The 
brother Dr. Hgasan Makki was rushed to hospital, where he has 
been receiving treatment and is now in satisfactory condition. 
  Security forces captured the attackers, who are now being 
questioned. 
  The source expressed deep regret over this deplorable 
incident. He called on all citizens to exercise alertness, 
awareness and restraint to forestall seditions in society. He 
called for their cooperation to help security agencies fulfill 
their functions under the critical circumstances our Yemeni 
homeland is experiencing.

of the martyrs, beseeching God to keep our country and people

  [Text] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
chairman of the Presidential Council and supreme commander of 
the Armed Forces, has visited the military hospital where he was 
reassured about the condition of the wounded from the 3d Armored 
Brigade and the 1st Armored Brigade who were the victims of the 
regrettable fighting that broke out the day before yesterday [27 
April] in the 'Imran garrison. 
  The brother president expressed his sympathy and deep regret 
and sorrow over this incident, which was planned and carried out 
by irresponsible elements. These elements want to achieve their 
wicked objectives with the aim of pushing the sons of the one 
homeland toward conflict and fighting in order to destroy the 
homeland and return the Yemeni homeland to the situation that 
prevailed before 22 May 1990. These elements are doing so to 
satisfy their whims and narrow interests, pursuant to the 
objectives of forces hostile to the revolution and democracy. 
  The brother president also expressed his heartfelt 
condolences to the families of the martyrs and innocent victims 
of the regrettable incident, noting that all are the sons of the 
one Yemeni homeland, whose souls and chaste blood are dear to 
us. He stressed that the sons of the Armed Forces are 
comrades-in-arms and comrades-in-struggle who stand in one 
trench to defend the revolution, the republic, homeland, and 
unity. He said that they will never turn into tools or lackeys 
of those elements with egocentric inclinations and destructive 
desires who are forcing the sons of the Armed Forces to pay 
dearly from their souls and blood for the sake of their 
destructive inclinations. He noted that the sons of the Armed 
Forces and security forces are our sons and brothers and we are 
proud of their sacrifices for the sake of the homeland. He 
said: They are the sons of this great people; they are faithful 
to this people's struggle, principles, and sacrifices. They 
will never allow any tampering with the security, stability, and 
achievements of the homeland. 
  The brother president said: The forces that are pushing 
toward war and fighting and toward igniting the military 
situation for selfish purposes and personal interests are, in 
fact, punishing the sons of our people and the members of the 
valiant Armed Forces by exposing them to death and pushing them 
toward danger for no reason except to satisfy the whims of these 
forces, which are being paid for all this. 
  He said: As the people expect, the sons of the Armed Forces 
will be the vanguards of the ranks and will form the frontlines 
that will protect the homeland against all dangers and foil the 
sick dreams and desperate attempts to redivide the country and 
impose separation. He added: Any separatist act will be faced 
with decisiveness and with more coherence among Yemeni unionists. 
  The brother president praised the high morale and readiness 
of the injured to sacrifice their souls in defense of unity. He 
noted that this criminal act, in which the sons of our Armed 
Forces were dragged into confrontation against each other, falls 
within the framework of the criminal series of acts that began 
on 20 February 1993, on the eve of the signing of the accord 
document in Amman, with the aim of bypassing it and obstructing 
the accord document's implementation in order to peddle the 
scheme of separation. He said that this series began with the 
aggravation of the situation against the al-'Amaliqah Brigade in 
the Ibyan Governorate and the incidents in Harth Sufyan, Shabwah 
and Dhamar, when the separatist forces intended to ignite the 
military situation and mobilize people with to create 
estrangement and conflicts among the sons of the Armed Forces 
and to push them toward fighting. 
  The brother president warned these separatist elements, 
which 
planned these criminal acts, against continuing these acts and 
playing with fire. He called on these elements to turn to 
reason, wisdom, and peaceful dialogue to resolve all issues, as 
well as to respect the will of the people and their 
constitutional institutions. He expressed hope that the tragedy 
of the 'Imran garrison will be the last tragedy in this beloved 
homeland in this delicate phase of its history. He also called 
for a mobilization of all national efforts within the framework 
of a large-scale national agreement to implement the accord 
document without hesitation or procrastination to reinforce 
national unity and strengthen our democratic unifying march. 
  The brother president urged the military committee to 
expeditiously present a detailed report on this regrettable 
incident, its circumstances, and those who stand behind it so 
that the people will be aware of all the facts. 
  The brother president instructed officials in the Defense 
Ministry, the Armed Forces General Staff, and the military 
hospital to take good care of the wounded. He also instructed 
that the serious cases, which cannot be treated in hospitals 
inside the country, be transferred for treatment abroad. 
  The president was accompanied by Deputy Prime Minister and 
Industry Minister Dr. Muhammad Sa'id al-'Attar, Planning and 
Development Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, Foreign 
Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah, Interior Minister Brigadier 
General Yahya al-Mutwakkil, and Sanaa Mayor Husayn al-Miswari.

  [Text] The General Committee of the General People's 
Congress [GPC] held a meeting yesterday under brother 
'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani, member of the Presidential Council 
and assistant secretary general of the GPC. The General 
Committee reviewed developments on the local scene in light of 
the regrettable incidents witnessed at the 'Imran camp yesterday. 
  The General Committee issued the following statement: 
  In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. There 
is the type of man whose speech about this world's life may 
dazzle thee. And he calls Allah to witness about what is in his 
heart; yet he is the most contentious of enemies. [Koranic 
verse] 
  O masses of our great Yemeni people: The GPC has observed, 
with extreme concern, the developments of the regrettable 
criminal incident witnessed by the city of 'Imran on Wednesday. 
At 1200 that day, a group of the 3d Armored Brigade, acting at 
the behest of the separatists within the Yemeni Socialist Party 
[YSP], carried out a treacherous, cowardly act against the 
members of the 1st Armored Brigade and innocent citizens in the 
city of 'Imran. They used tanks, armored vehicles, and heavy 
artillery, firing shells at the personnel of the 1st Armored 
Brigade, when the personnel were having lunch peacefully at the 
dining hall where the members of the joint military committee 
were present. The joint military committee was on a visit to 
the camp as part of its efforts to check military developments 
and pave the way for implementing the military part of the 
accord document. 
  Consequently, many members of the 1st Brigade were martyred 
and injured. The military situation inside the camp also flared 
up. The comrades-in-arms inside the camp had previously stayed 
together peacefully for over four years enjoying a spirit of 
amity and camaraderie. However, the influential separatists did 
not like this, so they sought to sow discord and ignite fighting 
between the sons of the Yemeni Armed Forces, using the commander 
of the 3d Armored Brigade and his accomplice in the crime and 
sabotage, who is called Yahya Dahish 'Alyan. Both were used as 
pliable, criminal tools to ignite fighting between the members 
of the two brigades, causing the loss of dozens of innocent 
martyrs of troops and citizens in the valiant city of 'Imran. 
The shells of the 3d Armored Brigade did not spare the homes of 
those citizens, thus claiming the lives of dozens of innocent 
martyrs and victims as a result of this treacherous, cowardly 
act. In addition, many homes and public facilities in the 
valiant city of 'Imran were destroyed. 
  The General Committee of the GPC condemns and deplores this 
heinous crime, which was carried out by certain YSP leaders and 
which happened at a time when national and political peaceful 
efforts are being dedicated to the implementation of the accord 
document, signed in Amman on 20 February, 1994. The crime also 
took place at a time when efforts were being exerted to bring 
the state institutions closer to a peaceful and positive 
relaxation of the crisis, which was engineered by the advocates 
of separation who rebelled against democracy, unity, peace, and 
peaceful coexistence. This stand is being repeated with every 
step made toward a relaxation of the crisis and containment of 
its developments and the beginning of the implementation of the 
accord document. It began in Abyan when the situation flared up 
against the forces of al-'Amaliqah, Shabwah and Harth Sufyan, in 
addition to the reckless acts carried out by the camp of the 
Ba-Fahd Brigade, terrorizing defenseless citizens in the city of 
Dhamar. This situation is being repeated today in the city of 
'Imran through the forces of the 3d Armored Brigade, which 
caused the martyrdom of dozens of victims. 
  While expressing its regret, warm sympathies, and 
consolation for all the families of the innocent victims who 
fell in the premeditated criminal incident -- all of them being 
sons of the one Yemeni homeland and whose chaste blood and 
precious lives are dear to all of us -- the General Committee 
appeals to the heroic troops, noncommissioned officers, and 
officers of our valiant Armed Forces to rise to the level of 
their national responsibility and match the expectations of 
their people as protectors of the homeland and a shield of its 
unity and democratic approach. It also appeals to them to be 
vigilant so as to avert all schemes that target the homeland, 
its unity, security, and stability. They should not heed the 
orders issued by the influential separatists within the YSP who 
seek to throw them into an inferno of death and fighting with 
their brothers and comrades-in-arms, who stand with them in one 
trench defending the homeland, the revolution, the republic, and 
unity. Those influential separatists want to satisfy their sick 
whims and narrow personal interests, having been blinded by the 
glitter of [word indistinct] money paid by the enemies of the 
Yemeni homeland to ignite fighting between the sons of the 
Yemeni people, divide the homeland, and harm its unity and 
democracy. 
  The General Committee also appeals to all parties, factions, 
and mass organizations and unions to condemn such criminal 
stupidity, reject calls for separation and division, and close 
ranks to unify the sincere national will so as to implement the 
accord document by showing collective responsibility. This will 
spare the homeland the danger of falling into the trap of this 
conspiracy that targets the will of the people, their unity, 
security and stability. 
  The General Committee stresses dialogue as a means to 
resolve 
all differences. It also asserts that the accord document 
should be translated into reality, without hesitation or 
procrastination, since this document is the common denominator 
between all parties, in order to build a modern Yemeni state. 
  The General Committee urges the masses of our people to 
demonstrate more vigilance and alertness and reject and denounce 
this conspiracy that aims at dragging the country toward more 
fighting, fragmentation, and sedition. It also reiterates the 
appeal made by Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, the 
chairman of the Presidential Council and secretary general of 
the GPC, to the constitutional, legitimate institution -- the 
House of Representatives -- to assume all its legal and 
constitutional responsibilities to put an end to these stupid, 
criminal acts that threaten the safety, security, and stability 
of the homeland and citizens. This will safeguard and protect 
unity, enhance and protect constitutional legitimacy, and 
protect the citizens and the homeland from the intrigues of 
enemies and conspirators. 
  Glory and immortality to the martyrs of unity; death to 
plotters against unity. Allah will certainly aid those who aid 
His cause; for verily Allah is full of strength, exalted in 
might, able to enforce His will. [Koranic verse] 
  Issued by the General Committee of the GPC.

<F P=106> [Statement by Yemeni House of Representatives issued on 28 </F>
April] 
  [Excerpt] Praise be to God, who says: And fear the trial 
which affects not in particular only those of you who do wrong 
[partial Koranic verse], and peace and blessings be upon his 
honest messenger, Muhammad, and his family and companions. 
  The House of Representatives has been following the 
exacerbating political crisis since the beginning, and has been 
exerting intensive efforts to end it. In the meantime, the 
House provided successive chances for coalition parties and 
direct dialogue to find solutions to the crisis in a manner that 
satisfies all parties. 
  The House, along with the masses of our people, used to 
believe that the drafting and signing of the pledge and accord 
document would end the political crisis, which has negatively 
affected every aspect of citizens' daily lives. 
  Having followed the regrettable military incidents in 'Imran 
at noon yesterday, Wednesday, 27 April 1994, leaving many of our 
people's sons in the Armed Forces dead, the House expresses 
extreme regret and concern for those incidents. It instructs 
the Defense Ministry and the command of the Armed Forces to 
immediately stop the use of weapons between the brother members 
of the same people and same army. It instructs all of them to 
abide by the instructions of legitimate constitutional 
authority, which represents the people, and to abide by their 
constitutional duty to safeguard national sovereignty and 
legitimacy. It appeals to everyone to immediately stop using 
weapons and to abolish all military manifestations which lead to 
disputes at the camps and outlying [formerly border] areas. 
  The House, along with all the sons of our people, condemns 
the use of force and all those who directly or indirectly 
fomented the sedition among the sons of the same homeland. The 
House demands that the executive authority take the instigators 
to court as soon as investigations are concluded, within one 
week. The House instructs the Defense and Security Committee to 
move to 'Imran to investigate what has taken place and to submit 
an urgent report to the House. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
chairman of the Presidential Council, last night received 
brother Badr Hammam, Egyptian assistant foreign minister and the 
envoy of Egyptian President Muhammad Husni Mubarak. Hammam 
conveyed to the brother president a message from his brother 
President Muhammad Husni Mubarak. The message deals with 
developments in our region and the efforts exerted by the 
brothers in Egypt to contain the political crisis and to end its 
regrettable repercussions, especially on the media and military 
levels. 
  The message also expresses the Egyptian president's concern 
over the regrettable incidents that took place at the 'Imran 
camp. The message stresses Egypt's concern about security and 
stability and about supporting the march of unity and democracy 
in our country and exerting all efforts to achieve this. 
  The brother president asked the Egyptian envoy to convey a 
reply to his brother Egyptian President Muhammad Husni Mubarak 
reassuring him about the situation in our country. In his 
message, the brother president expresses his eagerness to exert 
every effort required to guarantee the safety of the Yemeni 
homeland and to foil all schemes aimed at threatening the march 
of security, stability, unity, and democracy in our country. 
The message also expresses the brother president's deep 
appreciation for the efforts of the brothers in Egypt, 
especially his brother President Muhammad Husni Mubarak, to 
prevent the danger of conflicts and violence in our country and 
to support the march of Yemeni unity since it is a national and 
pan-Arab gain that cannot be relinquished at any price. 
  The meeting was attended by 'Atta' Hardun, the Egyptian 
ambassador to our country.

  [Text] United Nations, New York, April 28, IRNA -- The 
foreign ministers of the contact group of the Organisation of 
Islamic Conference (ICO) [Islamic Conference Organization -- 
ICO] on Bosnia-Herzegovina in a declaration here Wednesday [27 
April] termed the arms embargo imposed on Sarajevo as illegal, 
unjust and in direct contradiction to Article 51 of the UN 
Charter. 
  The foreign ministers of the ICO contact group comprising 
Iran, Pakistan, Turkey, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Senegal and 
Malaysia who held an emergency meeting here Wednesday to discuss 
the deteriorating situation arising from the Serbian unabated 
atrocities in Bosnia-Herzegovina, made the remark in their final 
declaration. 
  Stressing the implementation of the Security Council and 
General Assembly resolutions on Bosnia-Herzegovina, the 
statement said that justice, humanity, morality and 
international law should not be ignored in settling the Bosnian 
plight. 
  The foreign ministers urged the international community, 
particularly ICO member states to extend their fullest 
cooperation to the Government of Bosnia-Herzegovina in the 
exercise of its inherent and inalienable right of individual and 
collective self-defence under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter. 
  The contact group will table a draft resolution to be handed 
over to the Security Council to proclaim that the provisions of 
Security Council Resolution 713 did not apply to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, the declaration said. 
  Expressing regret over the U.N. inability to preserve the 
inviolability of the "safe areas" designated by the Security 
Council, the declaration said that brutal Serbian atatcks on 
Gorazde once again proved the failure of all international 
efforts to deter and end the Serbian aggression. 
  The foreign ministers held "the Belgrade regime and its 
surrogate in Bosnia-Herzegovina" responsible for the cold 
blooded massacre in Gorazde of over 700 innocent civilians, the 
maiming of more than 2000 others and the forced displacement of 
more than 20,000 people. 
  Condemning the brutal Serbian offensive on Gorazde, they 
expressed support for the international war crime tribunal and 
called for the prosecution of those responsible for organizing 
and perpetrating the atrocities. 
  The foreign ministers welcomed the decision of the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) for extending the "Sarajevo 
exclusion zone model" to other U.N. declared "safe areas" in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and stressed the necessity of employing 
massive air-power, in accordance with Security Council 
resolutions to deter and interdict Serbian military supply lines. 
  Stressing the full and complete withdrawal of Serbian heavy 
weapons from Gorazde, as specified in NATO ultimatum of April 
22, they called for the removal of all heavy weapons in the 
possession of Bosnian Serbs to Serbia-Montenegro as called for 
in the Security Council Resolution 752. 
  Stressing the necessity for strengthening of UNPROFOR [UN 
Protection Force] in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the declaration urged 
the U.N. to avail itself of the proposal made by several Islamic 
countries for contributing troops to the UNPROFOR. 
  Expressing support for the convening of an international 
peace conference on former Yugoslavia, they emphasized that such 
a conference has to be formally based on the purposes and 
principles of U.N. Charter and consistent with the provisions of 
relevant Security Council resolutions. 
  However, they stressed that such a conference should not be 
utilized by the Serbs as a cover to execute or legitimize their 
war objectives and annexationist designs. 
  The declaration stressed that the Serb withdrawal from 
Gorazde and the establishment of "exclusion zone" must precede 
the holding of the conference and the member states of the ICO 
contact group should be invited to attend the conference as 
participants as well as any other peace initiative on 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The declaration welcomed the Washington agremeent between 
the 
Muslims and Croats and the confederal arrangements with the 
Republic of Croatia and said that it considers the initiative as 
an important step towards an overall political settlement of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  It called for tightening of the existing sanctions against 
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) until 
they comply with the Security Council resolutions and 
establishment of a comprehensive peace settlement. 
  The declaration called on international community to 
intensify humanitarian relief efforts in Bosnia-Herzegovina and 
called for urgent steps to reopen the Tuzla airport on regular 
basis. 
  Calling for the establishment of an ICO trust fund for the 
reconstruction of Bosnia-Herzegovina, it urged member states to 
contribute generously to this fund. 
  The declaration touched on the situation of Muslims in 
Sanjak 
and Kosovo and called on the international community to provide 
them with effective international protection. 
  The foreign ministers reaffirmed their decision to continue 
to review their economic relations with those governments, which 
continue to impede the achievement of just settlement by acts 
and policies aimed at rewarding the aggressor and legitimizing 
the fruits of aggression and decide to evolve a joint ICO 
position on this important question as soon as possible. 
  The declaration stressed the necessity to peserve the unity 
and indivisibility of Sarajevo as the capital of the Republic of 
Bosnia- Herzegovina and called on the United Nations to review 
the mandate of the UNPROFOR. 
  It also supported Algerian Government's proposal on holding 
an emergency ministerial meeting of the full membership of the 
ICO.

  [Text] The foreign minister, Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali, has 
said imposition of arms embargo on Bosnia-Herzegovina is a clear 
violation of Article 51 of the UN Charter. He was addressing a 
news conference, along with other foreign ministers of ICO 
[Islamic Conference Organization] Contact Group on Bosnia at the 
United Nations. He said according to the interpretation of the 
ICO, the Security Council by imposing the embargo had in fact 
amended the UN Charter, which was something beyond its own 
mandate. 
  The foreign minister said the government of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina held the special UN representative, Mr. 
Akashi, responsible for the deaths in Gorazde by acting to stop 
the air strikes against the Serb aggressors. He said the ICO 
members support this view and favor the removal of Mr. Akashi 
from his position. He said there are many other countries, 
besides the ICO members, who are also demanding his removal. 
  Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali said during their meeting with the UN 
secretary general, the ICO foreign ministers raised the question 
that if there was no peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina, then what 
exactly the UN forces were keeping there. [sentence as heard] 
The peacekeeping forces must have a clear defined role of 
enforcing peace, he added.

<F P=106> ['Uthman Mirghani report: "Sudanese Police Prepares To </F>
Confront `Mobile' Demonstrations"] 
  [Excerpt] London -- Well-informed sources have confirmed 
that a state of high alert has been announced in the Sudanese 
police, as `mobile' protest demonstrations have spread. 
  The sources linked the announcement of the high alert with 
the movement of protest demonstrations from the city of Medani 
in central Sudan to al-Husayhisah, Abu Haraz, Rufa'ah, 
al-Hilaliyah, and then al-Kamilin. 
  Several Sudanese sources inside and outside the country said 
yesterday that demonstrations have reached the city of Atbara, 
the largest industrial city in Sudan. 
  AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT could not confirm reports that 
demonstrators burned down some railroad maintenance workshops in 
Atbara. 
  Sudanese authorities fear the possibility of the 
demonstrations, staged to protest deteriorating living and 
economic conditions, moving to Khartoum, especially after what 
happened in al-Muradah district a few days ago and what happened 
in Omdurman a few weeks ago. 
  In the context of the measures taken as a result of these 
developments and demonstrations, al-Jazirah University Director 
Mubarak 'Ali Majzub issued a decision dismissing 29 male and 
female students from the university, from which protest 
demonstrations were launched in Medani last week. [passage

  [Text] The meeting between Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin 
and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher ended at the 
prime minister's bureau in Tel Aviv a short while ago. During 
the meeting, Rabin again complained about Syria's refusal to 
enact confidence-building measures while continuing to demand a 
complete Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights. Our 
correspondent Sefi Hendler reports from the prime minister's 
bureau in Tel Aviv: 
  [Begin recording] [Hendler] The Americans and the Israelis 
split up into three working groups. One group, dealing with the 
Syrian track, is headed on the Israeli side by Itamar 
Rabinovich. In the second group, dealing with Lebanon, Israel is 
represented by Uri Lubrani. Israel's representative in the 
third group, dealing with the Jordanian track, is Elyaqim 
Rubinstein. Prime Minister Rabin proposed that the group of 
officials attending the meeting split up into three smaller 
working teams and return for a concluding discussion in the 
presence of Foreign Minister Peres, Secretary of State 
Christopher, and Prime Minister Rabin at 1600 [1300 GMT]. 
Statements will apparently be released to the media following 
this afternoon's meeting. 
  During this morning's meetings, Rabin made several remarks. 
The prime minister briefed Christopher on Israel's plans for 
the continuation of the talks with Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan. 
The prime minister reiterated that Syria's maximalist demands 
for a full withdrawal from the Golan Heights had not been 
accompanied by any confidence-building measures vis a vis 
Israel. This was not right, the prime minister asserted. Rabin 
also mentioned two problems related to terrorism that Israel was 
currently facing. Raising the problem of Hizballah terrorism in 
Lebanon, the prime minister stressed that Hizballah was 
intentionally shelling Christian villages. Obviously, Rabin 
also spoke of Palestinian terrorism in the territories and 
specified in general the type of security arrangements Israel 
wanted on the Golan Heights. These are the initial details. 
The working groups are currently holding discussions and the 
prime minister will meet Warren Christopher again at 1600. [end 
recording]

  [Text] Residents of the Druze settlements on the Golan 
Heights are saying they have learned from various sources in 
Syria that U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher will 
deliver an Israeli proposal to Damascus entitled Majdal Shams 
First. The proposal suggests that during the first stage, Syria 
be given sovereignty and control over the four Druze settlements 
on the Golan Heights. 
  Our correspondents Nati Zilberman and Hayim Hecht report 
that 
the Druze villagers on the Golan Heights are already preparing 
for such a possibility. 
  Officials at the Prime Minister's Office, at the Foreign 
Ministry, and in the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] denied any 
plans for a withdrawal from Majdal Shams first. Our 
correspondents nevertheless report that the maps prepared by the 
General Staff contain several possible options for the transfer 
of the Druze villages to Syrian control.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by </F>
'Anat Davidov and political correspondent Shlomo Raz; place not 
given -- live] 
  [Text] [Davidov] Good evening, Foreign Minister Shim'on 
Peres. 
  [Peres] Good evening. 
  [Davidov] Have all sides agreed that 4 May is the date on 
which the agreement will be signed? 
  [Peres] That 4 May is the target date, yes. 
  [Raz] We have received reports saying that two issues remain 
open: the area of Jericho and the policeman on the bridge. 
What about the other issues, concerning which the sides had 
apparently agreed in advance that they should be concluded after 
the agreement is signed -- currency, transit documents, 
international presence? What is the situation with these issues? 
  [Peres] We have agreed on most issues. There are two or 
three issues on which I hope we will agree later today. 
  [Raz] When do you plan to return home, then? 
  [Peres] Tomorrow morning, I think. 
  [Raz] Since you originally planned to stay there till 
Saturday night, the negotiations must be almost concluded. 
  [Peres] I planned to stay on if necessary, but today was 
fruitful, we put in many hours, and Christopher and Mubarak's 
participation in the negotiations was definitely a help. 
  [Raz] What about Gaza roads? I understand there were 
disagreements on that issue, too. 
  [Peres] Gaza roads were not discussed. 
  [Raz] Then I understand this issue is also concluded. 
  [Peres] Yes. Whatever was achieved during the previous 
Cairo talks is still valid. 
  [Raz] Mr. Peres, can we then say with near certainty or with 
total certainty that the Israeli-PLO agreement will be signed on 
4 May? 
  [Peres] We can speak of reasonable likelihood, as they say, 
that it may be signed on 4 May, but we should leave room for 
doubt until the last minute. 
  [Raz] Let us move on to Syria, then. Christopher is 
arriving here tomorrow. I assume the Syrian track will be the 
main issue on the agenda with him. 
  [Peres] Yes. Tonight we will attempt to conclude all the 
outstanding issues, and I assume that tomorrow the Syrian 
chapter will be launched. 
  [Raz] What will happen on that track? Will Christopher 
achieve a dramatic development on the Syrian track as well 
during his present Middle East tour? 
  [Peres] I cannot promise anything. First of all, there is a 
difference between the concluding and the opening stages. With 
the Palestinians, we are close to conclusion, while with Syria, 
we have not even reached the opening stage. Therefore, we 
cannot speak of a breakthrough. 
  [Raz] Do you mean that with the Syrians, we are still at a 
stage prior to.... 
  [Peres, interrupting] We are at a ground-breaking stage. 
  [Davidov] Thank you very much, Foreign Minister Shim'on 
Peres. 
  [Peres] You are welcome. Shalom.

that Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] and Fatah have moved 
closer together recently. This process is important and 
consequential for Israel as well. The sources said that the

background of Hamas attempts to share control of the autonomy 
institutions. 
  The understandings between the two organizations were

in a bid to reduce internecine fighting during the sensitive 
period when the Palestinians assume authority over the 
autonomous areas. The sources attribute great importance to the 
prevention of internecine fighting between the two organizations 
and say that an agreement between them could lead to a reduction 
in terrorism and violence in the Gaza Strip.

<F P=106> [Report by Aharon Klein] </F>
  [Text] Some 10 armed bodyguards have been recently 
assigned to protect Fatah leaders in the Gaza Strip. The step 
had been approved by the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] and the 
defense establishment. The bodyguards received personal 
handguns, which had been purchased by Palestinians after 
receiving special Israeli approval. The decision to approve the 
employment of armed bodyguards was made in the wake of an 
explicit Palestinian request. In discussions with senior IDF 
officers, senior Fatah officials explained they had to protect 
themselves against assassination attempts by peace-opposing 
organizations. 
  The defense establishment's approval was granted on the 
strict condition that the bodyguards should only fire for 
protection and that they would not exhibit their weapons in 
public. The bodyguards have been issued appropriate permits. 
It should be noted that before the handguns were handed to the 
bodyguards, they were registered and ballistically tested.

<F P=106> [Report by military correspondent Eytan Rabin] </F>
  [Text] Major General Ilan Biran, commander of the IDF 
[Israel Defense Forces] Central Command, has ordered suspension 
of the activity of the squads operating against stone throwers 
in the West Bank. These squads were set up during the tenure of 
Major General Nehemya Tamari in order to apprehend stone 
throwers, including opening fire when necessary. The squads 
operated for several months, until the military advocate-general 
sent a letter instructing clarification of the orders relating 
to their operation. 
  The activity of the squads was resumed when Major General 
Dani Yatom was appointed temporary commander of the Central 
Command, and was occasionally halted on the basis of operational 
considerations. Major General Sha'ul Mufaz, commander of the IDF 
forces in the West Bank, renewed the activity of the squads 
several months ago. Maj. Gen. Biran ordered to suspend their 
operation several days after he entered office. 
  Central Command sources said Maj. Gen. Biran implemented 
this 
move in order to avoid unnecessary firing. They said Biran is 
checking all the standing orders relating to the Central 
Command, mainly open-fire orders, issued during the tenures of 
Yatom and Tamari. 
  An army source said "Biran is examining every order given in 
the Central Command and canceling those he does not approve of." 
If necessary, Biran will issue out new instructions. 
  The military sources add that Maj. Gen. Biran has held 
meetings with the Central Command's senior officers, including 
the division and brigade commanders, and visited the sensitive 
areas of the West Bank in order to get personally acquainted 
with the various spheres relating to his new post.

  [Excerpt] The wave of detentions against opponents of the 
peace process in the Gaza Strip continues. Twenty-five Hamas 
[Islamic Resistance Movement] and Islamic Jihad activists in the 
Strip were arrested over the past 24 hours by the security 
forces, Arab sources reported yesterday. 
  According to the sources, the activists were detained in 
their homes and the security forces also visited the homes of 15 
activists and fugitives who were not at home, and demanded their 
relatives give them up. Among those detained were Shaykh Nafar 
A'zam, 40, of Rafah, an Islamic Jihad leader who was put under 
administrative detention for six months. A'zam was released 
several weeks ago after a long period of imprisonment. 
  A senior activist of the Popular Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine, Walid al-Rul, 40, of al-Shati', was put under 
administrative detention for six months for the ninth time. 
Arab sources said he has been under detention for 53 months 
running. 
  Khalil Bal'awi, 24, a Hamas wanted man, was captured by 
security forces in Gaza yesterday. Bal'awi is suspected of 
terrorist activity against the security forces, including firing 
at IDF [Israel Defense Forces] patrols. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Haifa District Court has lifted the ban on 
reporting the detention of two Israeli Arabs, residents of West 
Barta'ah, suspected of aiding the terrorist who perpetrated the 
attack at Hadera's central bus station. 
  The two -- 'Atif Kabaha, 46, and Majid Kabaha, 48 -- are 
suspected of driving the terrorist from East Barta'ah in the 
territories to Hadera's central bus station under orders from 
Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] in return for money. The 
court extended their remand for another 15 days. They are not 
cooperating with the police. Our correspondent Nati Silberman 
notes that the police take a grave view of cooperation between 
Israeli Arabs and terrorists.

  [Text] London, Apr. 28, IRNA -- The British Government 
Thursday [28 April] launched a new campaign to discredit Iran by 
making claims that Tehran was involved in "assisting and 
encouraging terrorism" in Northern Ireland. At a meeting with 
Iran's charge d'affaires to London, Gholamreza Ansari, Foreign 
Office minister, Douglas Hogg, was said to have made accusations 
that he was "convinced of contacts between Iranian intelligence 
and the IRA" in its struggle against UK rule. 
  The charge d'affaires had been asked to have an advance 
meeting with Hogg ahead of the Organization of Islamic 
Conference (OIC) group on Bosnia pressing the British Government 
to end its indifference to Serb aggression. But according to 
the Foreign Office minister, Ansari was told that he had been 
"summoned" to convey British concern about the supposed contacts 
with the IRA, which he maintained should be "immediately and 
conclusively severed." 
  A spokesman for the Foreign Office said he was unable to 
comment on where the unspecified allegations came from other 
than there had been no claims or reports made in the British 
press. The only advance information came from a BBC 
correspondent, presumably briefed by the Foreign Office, who 
alleged that Iran was planning to assist the IRA with funds and 
weapons. 
  Republican sources in Belfast were equally surprised by the 
claims, suggesting that it was "black propaganda" used to cover 
British intelligence involvement in helping to supply South 
African weapons to loyalist terrorists in Northern Ireland. 
  The UK Government has also been under pressure by its 
failure 
to press forward the peace process in Belfast and is seen 
looking for a scapegoat. Other links have been made about 
Britain's `Rushdie campaign' against Iran "running out-of-steam" 
and was looking to for a fresh smear to support the U.S. policy 
to isolate Tehran following this week's visit from Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher.

  [Text] London, April 28, IRNA -- British Government 
allegations of Iran's involvement with terrorism and having 
connections with the Irish Republican Army (IRA) are "absolutely 
unfounded," Iran's Charge D'affaires to London, Gholam Reza 
Ansari said Thursday [28 April]. 
  The Islamic Republic has "always condemned terrorism and 
never supported such activities in anyway," he told a press 
conference after holding talks with Foreign Office Minister, 
Douglas Hogg. 
  Ansari's said London's allegations were to divert public 
opinion from Bosnia, ahead of his participation in an 
Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) group meeting with 
Hogg, which included seven other senior diplomats from Muslim 
countries. 
  The Iranian charge d'affaires was asked to attend the 
Foreign 
Office just prior to his participation in the OIC meeting, which 
criticized the United Nation's indifference to the Bosnian 
crisis. 
  However, on his arrival, he found the Foreign Office 
minister 
claiming that he was "summoned." Political analysts were both 
mystified and surprised at Britain provoking a fresh dispute 
with Islamic Iran. The BBC suggested that it could undermine 
the already fragile relations between the two countries. 
  A delegation of London parliamentarians had been hoping this 
week to make its first trip to Tehran since the Islamic 
revolution in a move to repair relations, which had been 
approved by Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd. 
  Other opinions suggested the smear campaign may be a cover 
for the failure of Britain's peace initiative in Northern 
Ireland, which appears to have recently ended in deadlock.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary from the "Perspectives" feature] </F>
  [Text] The foreign secretary of Britain and foreign 
minister of Northern Ireland [titles as heard], Douglas Hurd and 
Dick Spring, met on April the 25th in Dublin, capital of 
Ireland, in the context of the Northern Ireland peace talks 
aimed at examining the means and ways for breaking the 
deadlocked talks. 
  After four months since the signing of Ireland-Britain peace 
initiative this is the first time ever that the two countries' 
senior officials have launched a fresh effort for overcoming the 
existing obstacles. Britain, which is one of the old parties to 
the Northern Ireland dispute, through setting certain 
preconditions for the participation of Sinn Fein, the political 
wing of the Irish Republican Army, at their peace talks has 
resulted in prompting this army to view their future peace talks 
with pessimism, thus continuing its armed struggles [sentence as 
received]. 
  Britain, through setting a precondition for the Irish 
Republican Army for putting an end to the armed struggles 
without determining any obligation for London in connection with 
the withdrawal of its forces, has drawn these talks to a 
stalemate. 
  Political observers believe the presence of 12,000 British 
troops as well as a 7,000 strong Ulster police in Northern 
Ireland, which are considered as major opposition forces 
antagonizing the IRA, are regarded as major obstacles to the 
continuation of the peace talks process. 
  The British Government, contrary to its claims, based on its 
interests in resolving the Northern Ireland dispute, still 
insists on certain stands which are typical of the continuation 
of Britain's dominance in Northern Ireland. 
  The British Government has hinted at the issue of self-rule 
for Northern Ireland in its plan for peace initiative which 
means that London refuses to accept the right to sovereignty for 
Northern Ireland and is attempting to keep Northern Ireland as a 
region under British dominance. Meanwhile, the Protestant 
majority residing in Northern Ireland, that enjoys all-out 
support and protection of Britain, is yet another obstacle to 
the process of peace talks. In order to overcome it, Britain 
has to adopt a stance taking into consideration the existing 
realities. 
  Assuredly the British Government is no longer able to resort 
to the past methods to suppress the IRA and seek to exercise 
military power for the materialization of its political 
objectives. 
  In the meantime, one should note that the IRA, in turn, now 
does not see continuation of the armed struggle to be enough for 
achieving its goals. That is because the Conservative and Labor 
Governments in Britain have demonstrated that they have made 
themselves invulnerable to the blows of the army and will 
neutralize the effects of such measures and the government's 
political decisions. With regard to the fact that the two sides 
have obtained great experiences during more than two decades of 
struggle, and also in view of the difficulties faced by each 
side, it appears that one can assess the future of these talks 
optimistically through the presentation of peaceful views by 
each side.

  Although it is said that Christopher's talks in Riyadh will 
concentrate on three topics--the Middle East compromise, the 
situation and developments in the Persian Gulf, and the 
situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina--political observers believe 
that the major topic of discussion among the U.S. secretary of 
state, Saudi officials, and GCC foreign ministers will be these 
countries' role in activating the talks with the Zionist regime, 
the recognition of this regime, and the normalization of 
relations with it. 
  In view of the difficulties that the compromise talks are 
facing on bilateral levels, especially those of Syria and 
Lebanon, as well as the bleak prospects for the Israeli-PLO 
talks, the foreign sides--especially the United States--are 
trying to shift the talks' center of gravity from bilateral 
conflicts between the front-line countries and those that are in 
contact with the Zionist regime to multilateral sessions. By 
removing the support from behind the front-line countries, they 
hope to transform compromise with the Zionist regime into a road 
of no return. 
  Within this framework, a new round of multilateral sessions 
with Zionist diplomatic delegations have started in the Arab 
littoral countries of the Persian Gulf. Although Saudi Arabia 
is apparently not the host of any of these sessions, 
Christopher's visit to Riyadh shows that the center of 
Washington's new diplomacy for activating the rusty wheels of 
compromise is in Riyadh. 
  One of the most important topics in the discussions between 
the six GCC foreign ministers and the U.S. secretary of state is 
a statement proposed by the United States in which countries 
participating in the multilateral talks would mutually recognize 
the sovereignty, territorial integrity, and so-called political 
independence of each other and declare their firm belief in a 
peaceful solution of differences, respect for human rights, and 
support for economic cooperation with each other. Moreover, the 
statement proposed by the United States emphasizes the need for 
political reform, the implementation of democratic principles, 
and the freedom of political parties. 
  Thus, the GCC countries are currently facing a new 
bottleneck 
and have to resort to a deal with Washington. These countries 
consider the implementation of any type of fundamental political 
reforms to be destructive. Thus, they will possibly resort to a 
political transaction that will include concessions to Tel Aviv 
in the political and economic fields in return for Washington's 
acceptance of the slow pace at which political reforms are 
moving in these countries.

  [Text] Trilateral talks among Christopher, Peres, and 
'Arafat began in Cairo today. The three sides discussed the 
resumption of the Middle East peace talks and the implementation 
of the Gaza-Ariha Accord. 
  According to most observers, before being effective in 
overcoming the present differences, the meeting has merely been 
a show for indicating the three sides' interest in reaching an 
agreement. The analysts say that the main goal being pursued by 
Mr. Christopher during his Middle East tour, which began on 
Wednesday, is nothing except persuading the Arabs to resume 
compromise talks with Israel. Despite this, in view of the 
outcome of Christopher's Wednesday meeting in Riyadh, Saudi 
Arabia, with the foreign ministers of the southern Persian Gulf 
countries, some political observers say that, as before, the 
U.S. secretary of state, during his meetings with the foreign 
ministers of the regional countries, besides increasing the 
interregional countries' differences, is persuading the Arab 
countries of the Middle East to lift economic sanctions against 
Israel. The United States has been basically pursuing the same 
very goal for the past year, which is also part of its strategy 
that, on the one hand, the pro-U.S. Arab countries are brought 
closer to Israel and, on the other, on various pretexts, any 
country opposing the U.S. imperialist policies in the Middle 
East is projected as a new enemy of the Arabs instead of Israel 
and their old enemy, that is Israel itself, is projected as the 
apparent friend of the Arabs. 
  However, during his Middle East tour, Mr. Christopher while 
continuing his strategy, is seeking to remove the factors that 
have halted the compromise talks. But it is already evident 
that he will have no success in this goal because Arab states 
have now discerned that the Zionist regime is trying to get 
maximum concessions while giving minimum concessions in return. 
Therefore any plan being pursued by the Americans eventually 
falls within this framework. This matter has already been 
established over the past three years when the compromise talks 
opened in Madrid. 
  Some Arab allies of America in the region, without paying 
any 
attention to the events taking place behind the scene, are 
adopting their political stance as agents of Washington and Tel 
Aviv solely for the sake of holding on to their rule for some 
more time. This has prevented the Arab states to form a united 
front in the face of the Zionist regime. It is even more 
painful to note that these Arab states are distancing themselves 
further from their own Muslim masses. Under such conditions, 
Washington and Tel Aviv, without any concern about the future, 
are trying to gain maximum concessions from the governments 
which are a party to negotiations with the Zionist regime by 
exploiting the differences among them and through creating a 
rift among the Arab and non-Arab Islamic states.

  [Text] Hojjat ol-Eslam val-Moslemin Mohammad Reyshahri, the 
representative of the esteemed leader and the supervisor of the 
Iranian pilgrims to the House of God [Mecca] stressed: The 
disavowal of infidels is a part of the hajj, is the spirit of 
the hajj and is the true meaning of this great congress. 
  The supervisor of the Iranian pilgrims to the House of God, 
who was speaking before today's Friday prayers sermons in 
Tehran, criticized the approach of the Saudi Arabian Government 
towards the disavowal of infidels ceremonies and said: We are 
not trying to create any disturbances for the Saudi Government. 
However, on the basis of Islamic principles and at the urging 
of the guardian of the cause of Muslims [Khamene'i], and in 
order to implement a divine injunction, we will perform these 
ceremonies. 
  He said: In Islam it is incumbent upon people to take part 
in the disavowal of infidels ceremonies. He added: To separate 
the political dimension from the hajj means that in this great 
congress the Muslims will have to do nothing regarding the 
enemies of Islam and should not find any solutions for the 
political and social problems in Islamic countries, including in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is burning in the fire of Serbian 
atrocities. 
  He urged Saudi officials not to prevent the Muslims from 
carrying out their duty in performing the disavowal of infidels 
ceremonies in this year's hajj pilgrimage.

  [Text] Tehran, April 26, IRNA -- The leader's 
representative for Afghan affairs, Hojjat ol-Eslam Ebrahimi, 
here Tuesday called on Afghan ulema to strive for ending the 
civil war in their country. 
  Ebrahimi, who made the plea in a meeting with head of 
coordination council for northern Afghanistan and General 
Abdul-Rashid Dostam's special envoy Sirat Taleqani, said Afghan 
ulema can play an important role in improving current situation 
in Afghanistan and bringing unity to the feuding Afghan groups. 
  "If they (Afghan ulema) fulfil their mission, clashes will 
end," reiterated the Iranian official. 
  He said the clashes in Afghanistan have no result except the 
massacre of civilians. Unity and cohesion among all groups to 
elect just one leader or leadership council can put an end to 
the ongoing animosities, he added. 
  Ebrahimi voiced the Iranian nation and leadership's sympathy 
with the situation of world Muslim, especially the Afghan people. 
  Taleqani, who carried Dostam's written message to leader of 
the Islamic revolution, Ayatollah Seyyed 'Ali Khamene'i, thanked 
Iran for its humanitarian relief supplies to the Afghan people. 
  The message expressed gratitude for Ayatollah Khamene'i's 
sympathies for the Afghan people, and called for continuation of 
Iran's assistance to the Afghan Muslims.

  [Text] In a meeting with Malian President Alpha Oumar 
Konare, President Hashemi-Rafsanjani placed emphasis on the 
Islamic Republic of Iran's foreign policy which stresses 
cooperation with African countries in general and Muslim 
countries in particular. 
  During this morning's meeting, the president of Mali 
expressed pleasure about visiting Iran. He pointed out that 
unity among Muslim and other nations plays an effective role in 
the resolution of world problems, and called for the expansion 
of relations with Iran. He added: Your excellency is well aware 
of the situation in African countries and particularly in Mali, 
as well as the problems of that continent, and I feel that I am 
able to hold discussions with your excellency in all fields. 
  In response, Hashemi-Rafsanjani thanked Mr. Konare for his 
sincere remarks and referred to Iran's foreign policy, giving 
priority to cooperation with Muslim countries and said: We are 
ready for extensive cooperation with the Muslim and friendly 
country of Mali in all fields of interest to the two countries. 
He added: Your country can be a powerful country in 
agriculture and animal husbandry, and your plentiful natural 
resources can play a decisive role in solving your country's 
problems. Underdevelopment there should be seen as an outcome 
of the colonialism which dominated your country for years. The 
president said: We hope that you succeed in overcoming your 
problems through your work and through solidarity now that you 
are independent. We in Iran had some good experiences and are 
ready to cooperate with you, and Islam, which is the common bond 
between the two countries, can play a significant role in ever 
expanding cooperation. 
  Also during the meeting, the problems of the Islamic world, 
particularly problems of Palestine and Bosnia-Herzegovina, were 
discussed and the two sides stressed the need for further 
solidarity among Islamic countries in order to solve problems of 
the Muslim people of Bosnia-Herzegovina.

  [Text] President Hashemi-Rafsanjani, in a gathering of the 
central council of the Islamic Coalition Society 
[ICS--Jam'iyyat-e Mo'talefe-ye Eslami], described action based 
on the axis of velayat-e faqih [guardianship of the 
jurisconsult] and following the guidelines of the exalted 
leadership [Khamene'i] at this juncture in society to be a duty 
for officials, the people, and various formations of the 
community. 
  Praising the lofty character of the martyrs of ICS, the 
president said: What guarantees the correctness and soundness 
of the activities of a formation is its adherence to the 
principle of velayat-e faqih and giving preference to the 
interests of the Islamic system as opposed to personal and 
factional interests. The ICS has maintained its adherence to 
that important principle since its inception. 
  Referring to the fact that Iran is known as a wealthy state 
in the world, Hashemi-Rafsanjani laid emphasis on the need for 
endeavor, planning, and sincere cooperation among each and every 
one of the people and said: Thus, we will prove to the world 
that a nation is able to make up for past underdevelopment and 
to correct past wrongful policies through reliance on its 
financial and human resources while preserving its holy, 
Islamic, noble, and national values and aspirations. The 
realization of that import by the end of the second development 
plan is not hard to expect.

  [Excerpt] As we informed you earlier in the bulletin, Mr. 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani today inspected three exhibitions in 
connection with the electricity, mining, construction, and 
gemstone industries, and also the projects of the Science 
Academy of the Islamic Republic of Iran. The exhibitions were 
set up on Tehran's permanent exhibition site for international 
trade fairs. 
  At the end of his inspection tour, the president was 
interviewed by our correspondent and expressed his views on 
these exhibitions. 
  [Begin Hashemi-Rafsanjani recording] The outstanding 
features 
of the electricity industry exhibition were too many to be 
mentioned in this interview. However, one of the features which 
interested me greatly was to witness the result of a move which 
started two years ago with the aim of enabling us to manage all 
aspects of the electricity industry on our own -- such as 
production, transfer, and distribution. With regard to the 
distribution of electricity, we are almost fully self-sufficient 
in that everything to do with all 20 posts [as heard] is being 
done inside the country. 
  As far as the transfer of electricity is concerned, we are 
also largely self-sufficient. In production too, there has been 
a major move during the last two years, and now we are able to 
build everything which is feasible and cost-efficient inside the 
country and meet the needs of our hydroelectric, steam, gas, and 
compound cycle power stations. [passage omitted] [end recording] 
  The president stressed: With the plans we have, during the 
next five or six years Iran will become one of the main centers 
for the construction of various types of power stations. Such 
an achievement deserves praise, and one must really pay tribute 
to the efforts of the experts in the field. He added: 
Experience shows that our choice, that is the construction of 
dams and hydroelectric power stations, was a right choice which 
has proved beneficial to us. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Tehran, April 28, IRNA -- The governor of Iran's 
Central Bank Mohammad Hoseyn 'Adeli in a meeting with the 
managing director of International Monetary Fund, Michel 
Camdessus, in Washington D.C. Tuesday exchanged views on the 
issues of mutual interest. 'Adeli briefed Camdessus on the 
achievements and progress of the first development plan saying 
that during the first five-year development plan Iran's gross 
domestic product (GDP) has considerably increased. Despite 
pressures from some foreign countries, Iran has succeeded in 
concluding useful agreements with its trade partners, 'Adeli 
said. 
  Camdessus said that Iran's success in rescheduling its 
foreign debts would increase its credit in the fields of trade 
and commerce. He also lauded Iran's stands vis-a-vis the 
developing countries. 
  'Adeli is currently in Washington D.C. to attend the joint 
session of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.

  [Text] On the basis of a draft bill whose urgency was 
approved in yesterday's Majles session, any change in the price 
of goods and services provided by the government will require 
the approval of the legislature. 
  On the basis of this single article bill, from the date of 
the approval of the bill, any increase in the prices of goods or 
services can be implemented only on the basis of the proposal of 
the Economic Council and the approval of the Islamic Majles. 
Any price increases that have been announced by the Economic 
Council or any other source since the start of the current year 
[starting 21 March 1994] will be null and void. If this bill is 
approved, the government will also be dutybound to exert precise 
supervision and control over the prices that have been approved 
and should take legal measures against those who violate the 
approved prices. 
  It should be added that on the basis of the internal 
regulations of the Islamic Majles, the single article draft bill 
on controlling the prices of goods and services will be 
discussed and studied out of turn by the specialized [economic] 
committee, and will be probably debated and ratified by the open 
session of the Majles within the next 20 days. 
  According to some experts on economic affairs, the 
ratification of the single bill article regarding the 
intervention of the legislature in controlling prices will be a 
way of expanding the scope of decisionmaking on the increase of 
the prices of goods and services. Consequently, when necessary, 
any changes in prices will be implemented after a deeper expert 
discussion and on the basis of realities and needs. This will 
prevent some illogical decisions that may be taken by some 
executive officials regarding unprincipled price increases. At 
the same time, this move to control prices in itself will be 
regarded as a lever for controlling inflation. 
  It should be noted that the First Development Plan of the 
country [which concluded 20 March 1994] was drawn up on the 
basis of a balanced economy. In other words, the prices of 
government goods and services should have been set at a level 
which would, at least, cover the cost of the production of those 
goods and services; so that, on the one hand, by lowering its 
costs, the government could reduce its financial liabilities 
and, on the other hand, those revenues [thus saved] could be 
spent on development projects and investments in infrastructure. 
  Consequently, the consumers should pay an appropriate price 
for making use of government goods and services, so that the 
sick economy of the country will be directed toward recovery and 
its structure will be corrected. 
  During the past five years, in order to implement a balanced 
policy, economic programs were drawn up in such a way that in 
the medium term to support the oppressed [poorer classes] the 
level of cash payments and subsidies would be gradually reduced 
on a balanced scale so that the consumers could adjust their 
purchasing abilities with the prices. 
  In the same connection, President Hashemi-Rafsanjani has 
explained the government policies on a balanced economy, and 
stressed the need to increase the people's income and purchasing 
power. He said: There should be a balance between the people's 
income and expenditure, so that they will need government 
assistance. Therefore, in the policies of economic equilibrium, 
hand in hand with correcting the prices of goods and services 
there should also be an increase in the purchasing power and 
salaries of vulnerable classes. In the same connection, His 
Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i, the esteemed Leader of the Islamic 
Revolution, in his 12-point instruction to the government, 
stressed the need for serious legal support for all the 
oppressed classes of society in various fields. The esteemed 
president of the Islamic Republic also described the achievement 
of social justice as the main target of the Second Development 
Plan of the country. 
  In any case, under the present conditions when our country 
is 
in the process of its economic reconstruction, the legislative 
and executive powers of the Islamic Republic of Iran are 
determined to pave the way for the achievement of economic 
independence and public welfare of the Iranian people.

<F P=106> ["AL-AHALI Opinion" column: "We Are Not A Gate To Tighten </F>
The Siege of Iraq"] 
  [Text] We have condemned the U.S. aggression against the 
Port of al-'Aqabah and considered it a manifestation of the 
comprehensive hostile policy against the whole region. This 
falls within the framework of the attempts aimed at imposing a 
new regional order under U.S. tutelage and hegemony. We also 
cannot find an excuse for entrenching -- with our approval -- 
this aggression against our national sovereignty under the 
pretext of conducting land inspection. 
  We want an answer to this simple question: Is there a 
decision to monitor, besiege, or inspect Jordan? We know there 
is no decision in this regard; and the UN Sanctions Committee 
says there is no such decision. The Americans are the ones who 
are imposing the siege, and the evidence is clear. The talks to 
lift the siege are being held with U.S. envoys -- the last of 
whom was Secretary of State Christopher -- not with Butrus-Ghali 
or with the president of the Security Council as the Iraqi 
brothers are doing. 
  We wanted the government to champion the opinion of the 
people, not only the interests of some importers and merchants 
who are harmed by U.S. piracy. We were ready to fight together 
in one trench to confront the U.S. aggression against Jordan. 
The government's view, however, was different. It opted for 
the policy of ostrich in front of the U.S. hyena, thereby 
ignoring the view of the people and their political forces as 
well as the good reputation of our country on the international 
level. 
  Warren Christopher's statements in London aroused anger and 
resentment because he linked these measures with tightening the 
siege of Iraq. Do they want Jordan to become a barrier in the 
face of Iraq or a gate to ease the burdens of the unjust siege 
imposed on the people who have always been generous with Jordan, 
Syria, and Palestine and who watered the soil of these countries 
with the blood of their martyrs? 
  The policy of weakness and hiding heads in the sand will 
only 
lead to more humiliation and disgrace. We are not like that and 
we will not be like that. We will continue to resist the policy 
of capitulation and normalization. We will never agree to 
seeing Jordan become a passageway for U.S.-Israeli peace 
regardless of the sacrifices.

  [Excerpt] The chief U.S. diplomat has begun his tour of the 
region by meeting in London with His Majesty King Husayn. This 
meeting ended the debate over a final solution of the blockade 
enforced against al-'Aqabah, from which Jordan has suffered for 
the past four years. 
  The Jordanian side, through King Husayn, and the U.S. side, 
through Warren Christopher, announced the blockade problem will 
be resolved soon, and that sea-based inspections will be 
replaced by land-based inspections at the Port of al-'Aqabah to 
be conducted by the British company, Lloyds Register. . 
  The U.S. secretary of state has solved one of the crises his 
Middle East tour is designed to resolve as part of his efforts 
to reactivate the Middle East multilateral peace talks. 
  Christopher will continue his tour of the region by heading 
to Riyadh, Cairo, and Tel Aviv. It is possible he might visit 
Lebanon, as several news agencies have reported. But, he will 
not stop in Amman. 
  An authorized Jordanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs source 
has told AKHIR KHABAR that Christopher's plan not to visit 
Jordan can in no way create any difficulties, because the 
meeting between him and his majesty the king in London achieved 
the purpose of any visit to Jordan he might make. Meanwhile, 
several parliamentarians have reiterated that political factors 
were behind Christopher's decision not to visit Jordan. They 
ruled out the possibility that the U.S. secretary of state's 
plan not to visit Jordan came about at Jordan's request. 
  For his part, Muhammad Dawudiyah, member of the House of 
Representatives, said it is good that Christopher is not 
visiting Jordan. He argued that the United States, given its 
sponsorship of the Middle East peace talks, must demonstrate 
impartiality. But, it is not doing so. He added: I believe 
demonstrations would be staged in the country if Christopher 
stopped in Jordan. He did not rule out the possibility that a 
Jordanian request might have been behind Christopher's decision 
not to visit Amman. 
  Fawzi Tu'aymah [member of the Jordanian House of 
Representatives], said: Some reasons pertaining to the peace 
process might have been behind Christopher's decision not to 
visit Amman. I cannot determine these reasons. Nonetheless, 
Christopher's recent statements have underscored the good 
Jordanian- U.S. ties. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] Under the headline "The Results of the Test Will 
Not Change," the newspaper AL-BA'TH says: Israel's rulers 
always precede U.S. envoys' visits to the region with 
intensified media campaigns designed to throw dust in the eyes 
of the international community, creating the deceptive 
impression that Israel is being flexible and that it is willing 
to pay the price of peace. 
  AL-BA'TH adds: In light of Warren Christopher's current 
visit to the region, Israel sparked and guided a media campaign 
throughout the world to cast the rulers of Israel in a favorable 
light, portraying them as taking peaceful regional initiatives. 
At the same time, this media campaign seeks to portray Syria as 
the party that fails to offer initiatives, or what the rulers of 
Israel call concessions for peace. 
  The paper explains that mere talk about Israel's willingness 
to abandon the settlements within an unspecifified period, in 
accordance with a list of Israeli demands and conditions, in no 
way changes the problem on the Syrian-Israeli track of the peace 
process. The paper says the obstacle to progress in the peace 
talks is Israel's refusal to announce its acceptance of the 
resolutions of international legitimacy by withdrawing from all 
occupied Syrian Arab territories. The peace talks will not 
progress without full withdrawal. 
  The paper says Syria, as President Hafiz al-Asad has said, 
accepted the bases of the peace process. It is willing to offer 
full peace in return for full withdrawal. Syria is not avoiding 
a just and comprehensive peace. It has always sought this peace 
and is sincerely cooperating with the United States for its sake. 
  AL-BA'TH concludes: There can be no peace without the return 
of all the territories, not just part of them. The territories 
cannot be divided, diminished, or replaced. The exercise of any 
kind of pressure, intimidation, deception, and threats by any 
party is a method that has been tried and tested more than once. 
The results have never changed. 
  Under the headline "The Fact," the newspaper AL-THAWRAH 
says: Perhaps the most outstanding fact all observers realize is 
that the peace process needs new momentum. A propelling force 
has been lost due to Israel's continued intransigence, 
procrastination, and time wasting, all designed to entrench 
facts on the ground, like the partial agreements it concluded 
with the Palestinian side in Oslo and Cairo. AL-THAWRAH adds: 
New momentum requires an effective U.S. role in accordance with 
United States' commitments as an honest partner in the peace 
process, which was originally based on a U.S. initiative founded 
on the UN Security Council resolutions and the land-for-peace 
principle. 
  AL-THAWRAH discusses Israeli intransigence and its role in 
blocking progress in the peace process. The paper says the 
policy of deception and prevarication resulting from Israel's 
violation on the Palestinian track -- a track that has become 
the prisoner of a separate and partial agreement -- is the 
outcome of secret hallway negotiations outside the peace 
process. Because of this policy, the peace process is fraught 
with dangers. 
  The paper says Israel wants only the formal activation of 
the 
peace process, via the formal U.S. role regrettably expressed by 
Warren Christopher before his arrival in the region. This was 
in noticeable contrast to the optimistic statements that used to 
precede each of his visits to the region. The paper continues: 
Today, there is no way to hide from the fact that it is a 
priority to translate the U.S. admission of Syria's central role 
into reality. The paper demands an effective U.S. role in order 
to implement the UN Security Council resolutions. The U.S. 
Administration has been committed to this role. It should 
manifest this in its behavior and on the diplomatic and 
political levels. This is what the peace process needs to avoid 
remaining the prisoner of Israeli intransigence. 
  AL-THAWRAH concludes by asking: Does Christopher realize 
that the ball is still in the Israeli court? Is he bringing any 
indication of the effective U.S. role that will put the peace 
process back on track toward a just and comprehensive peace?

<F P=106> [Press review] </F>
  [Text] Today's newspapers highlight the need to maintain 
the Arab boycott of Israel until its causes are removed. They 
also discuss U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's 
current tour of the region. 
  In one of its commentaries, AL-THAWRAH discusses the 
importance of the Arab boycott of Israel and the attempts to end 
the boycott. 
  The paper says: What amazing logic that calls for canceling 
the Arab boycott of Israel before reversing the Israeli 
occupation of the Arab territories and its consequences! 
  The paper notes that the Arab boycott was a natural result 
and a position adopted by the Arabs in self-defense in the face 
of Israel's aggressive policy and its expansionist ambitions 
toward the Arab nation. 
  AL-THAWRAH adds: Israel has not changed its function and 
role in the service of expansionist ambitions, based on 
plundering the wealth of the Arab nation and undermining its 
political and economic status. Canceling the boycott, 
therefore, while Israel continues to adopt an aggressive policy, 
has two aims: Stripping the Arabs of their right to use the 
boycott as a legitimate weapon in the face of Israel's ambitions 
and aggressive policy; and sabotaging the peace process and 
efforts for peace. 
  Concluding, the paper says: Israel's policy, in all its 
manifestations, is the only reason that the Arabs, primarily 
Syria, adhere to the Arab boycott as a regimen to immunize Arab 
existence against the danger of Israel's inclination for 
expansion and aggression. Developments on the ground have 
proven that Israel will never abandon this inclination, even 
under the peace process and efforts to make it succeed. 
  On the same issue, AL-BA'TH says: In order to prevent the 
peace process from becoming divorced from its objectives, there 
is now a pressing need to rectify the course of this process 
since the Rabin government has tried to derail the process and 
distort the basic substance through a series of attempts to 
circumvent the issues. These attempt began in Madrid and are 
still continuing today. 
  AL-BA'TH says it is the role of the U.S. secretary, who is 
visiting the region to intensify his efforts, on behalf of his 
administration that sponsors the peace process, to advance this 
process. 
  AL-BA'TH stresses Syria's full right to give its frank 
opinion, as usual, and to give a final say on the course of the 
peace process, particularly regarding a full Israeli withdrawal 
from the Golan and the rest of the occupied Arab territories. 
  Concluding its commentary, AL-BA'TH stresses that Syria's 
demands have never departed from the foundations of the peace 
process, which was launched on the basis of international 
legitimacy and relevant UN resolutions. 
  In another commentary, AL-THAWRAH speaks about U.S. 
Secretary 
of State Warren Christopher's tour of the region, asking the 
world and the U.S. Administration to identify the party that is 
obstructing the peace process and pushing it toward a dead end, 
and to take action to deter that party. 
  AL-THAWRAH stresses that the political process lacks 
vitality 
and vigor because of the continued Israeli policy of maneuvering 
and that sincere efforts need to be made now to press for the 
implementation of UN resolutions and the exchange of land for 
peace. The paper asks Washington to quickly fulfill its 
obligations and pledges so as not to undermine its credibility. 
  AL-THAWRAH concludes by stressing the constant principles in 
Syria's policy and its sincere attitude toward peace and 
adherence to its just demands to preserve our national and 
pan-Arab rights and ensure their return in full.

<F P=106> ["Opinion" column by 'Izz al-Din Darwish: "New Crime by </F>
Iraqi Regime"] 
  [Text] The murder of the Iraqi opposition figure, Shaykh 
Talib al-Suhayl al-Tamimi, is still alive on the political and 
judicial levels in Lebanon, especially after Iraqi diplomats 
confessed to the murder. 
  Preliminary investigations prove the assassination was 
carried out by direct orders from Baghdad and that a large 
sabotage network, including diplomats, carried out the operation. 
  Perhaps it is not unusual for the Iraqi regime to carry out 
such practices because it relies on methods of killing and 
bodily liquidation as official policy, even inside Iraq. The 
question is: What could the Iraqi regime reap from such murder? 
  The deceased shaykh had lived in Lebanon for a long time. 
Lebanese circles say he respected the principles governing his 
presence as a guest and was not a direct threat to the Iraqi 
regime, although he devoted his life to serving his people's 
causes. 
  It is indeed very sad for Iraqis to see their regime 
implementing these murders. But the fact remains that the Iraqi 
regime continues to live in isolation, outside the contemporary 
world. It is futile even to imagine that there is any 
possibility that this regime will behave differently and stop 
its ugly methods, known to Iraqis, Arabs, and foreigners alike. 
  Iraqis are sad and indignant because of the crimes committed 
by their regime. This is indisputable. They are not just 
witnessing what is happening, but are confronting it with the 
means at their disposal, waiting for the right opportunity. 
  It is unacceptable and unreasonable for conditions in Iraq 
to 
continue as they are now and for the regime to continue gambling 
with the fate of the land and people, after all the disasters it 
brought to them over the past years -- disasters whose 
humiliating results are impossible to comprehend. 
  Nevertheless, the Iraqi regime continues to dispatch 
sabotage, sedition, and killing missions without doing anything 
positive about Iraq, which is now under trusteeship and whose 
people are suffering pain and want. 
  Many strings connected with al-Suhayl's murder have been 
unraveled. The Iraqi charge d'affaires in Beirut himself heard 
what the detained diplomats said about the murder and the 
instructions they had received directly from Baghdad. 
  Lebanon has regained its strength and unity. It has said it 
will not allow sabotage gangs, whether they are Israeli or are 
linked with the Saddam regime, to carry out acts of killing and 
terrorism on its territory, that all the vicious acts will be 
referred to the law so the killers will take the punishment they 
deserve.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Syria Conducting Negotiations To </F>
Forge New Alliances"] 
  [Text] London, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Well-informed sources 
in London which are in direct contact with the Middle East 
crisis have pointed out that there have recently been numerous 
indications that new Syrian alliances may emerge in the region 
because of the developments concerning the Arab-Israeli 
negotiations. 
  The sources said that, as the United States supplied Israel 
with weapons and offered nothing to serve the peace process, 
Syria has begun to look once again for allies to supply it with 
spare parts and weapons and work again to achieve the military 
and strategic parity it had started, that is within new Arab 
alliances that could surprise the Arab world. 
  The sources pointed out that Syria will overturn the 
equation 
in its relations, which will center on its interests that 
secures power for it in the Middle East region. And that it is 
currently making secret contacts with Arab parties with which it 
has had strained relations in the past. 
  The sources said that what justifies this is that Syria has 
begun to be subjected to great pressures to accept concessions 
in its demands vis-a-vis Israel's withdrawal from the Golan and 
the occupied Arab territories. And Damascus has begun to urge 
the elimination of Arab differences and the restoration of 
cohesion among the Arab states.

  [Text] Cairo, 28 Apr (MENA)--The Arab League Secretariat 
General expressed its deep concern over the military 
confrontation in Yemen which is threatening its unity, security, 
and stability and subjecting the constant Arab efforts to find a 
solution for the crisis to failure. 
  In a statement issued today, the Arab League appealed to all 
the Yemeni parties to exercise self-restraint, unite their 
ranks, resolve their differences through frankness and dialogue, 
and abide by what was agreed on in the Pledge and Agreement 
Document signed by the Yemeni brothers in the Jordanian capital, 
Amman, on 20 February 1994. 
  The statement stressed that Yemen's unity is a "national 
gain 
and a pan-Arab achievement" that should be protected in order to 
establish stability and security in Yemen in particular and the 
region in general. 
  It reiterated the need for all the Yemeni parties to protect 
the state of unity and overcome all the obstacles and 
difficulties that are impeding the attainment of national accord. 
  The statement declared the Arab League Secretariat General's 
readiness to mobilize all its resources in order to help remove 
the specter of civil war in fraternal Yemen.

  [Excerpts] General Antoine Lahd, commander of the SLA 
[South Lebanese Army], says his army has already prepared for 
the possibility that in the near future it will remain alone, 
that is, that Israel will leave Lebanon in the framework of a 
peace arrangement. These remarks were made during an 
inauguration ceremony of a hospital built by Israel in the 
Shiite village of Bint Jubayl at the cost of $1 million. Our 
correspondent Menahem Horowitz reports from the north. 
  [Begin Horowitz recording] [passage omitted] Gen. Antoine 
Lahd, who met Israeli correspondents prior to the ceremony, said 
that the SLA has no objections to joining the Lebanese Army in 
future. 
  Over the last year Israel provided $7 million in civilian 
aid 
to the residents of south Lebanon's security zone. In this 
hospital in Bint Jubayl alone Israel invested $1 million. 
Israel wants to prove to south Lebanon's population -- mainly 
the Shiites -- that despite the political negotiations Israel 
will continue to provide them with all possible aid. [end

  [Text] According to reports from the occupied south, the 
township of Marj 'Uyun is currently teeming with arrivals from 
East Beirut. The reports add that the new arrivals are being 
provided with housing for a prolonged stay. 
  The reports note that the area's residents say that the 
arrivals are members and cadres of the Lebanese Forces who have 
come there following the dissolution of their party in the wake 
of their involvement in a series of explosions, including the 
bombing of the Sayyidat al-Najat Church in Zuq Mikha'il. 
  Although the reports do not indicate the number of those 
arriving, they nevertheless mention that many of them have 
arrived in the nearby villages and towns as well. The same 
reports say that some of the arrivals are carrying out military 
and security activities and are roaming the areas with light 
weapons. It is not yet clear whether the new arrivals will join 
the army of agent Antoine Lahd--which has since 1987 banned any 
political or military entity from operating outside its 
jurisdiction--or if they will open offices run by the Lebanese 
Forces and with the support of Israel. The reports say the 
Lebanese forces will either be deployed along the combat lines 
facing the liberated southern areas or they will foment 
seditious acts.

al-Litani River basin came under violent and concentrated 
shelling by Israeli artillery in al-Zaffat and al-Tayyibah at 
1645 this afternoon. The Israeli occupation troops strafed the 
forests close to the al-Litani River basin with machine-gun 
fire. [passage omitted] 
  The Islamic Resistance, in a statement released in 
al-Nabatiyah this afternoon, announced that the martyr Yusuf 
Harb group at 1645 today ambushed a patrol from the Lahd 
militias [South Lebanese Army] while passing along the dirt road 
between 'Alman and al-Shumariyah. The group members destroyed 
an armored personnel carrier and killed and wounded those inside 
it. Following the operation, clashes ensued between the 
resistance fighters and the patrol members in which various 
types of weapons were used. The occupation troops' artillery in 
al-Zaffat and the enemy tanks in al-Tayyibah joined the battle.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat by </F>
'Abd-al-Jabbar al-Barghuthi in Tunis; date not given] 
  [Text] Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat has stressed 
that he will not feel at ease until all Palestinian prisoners in 
Israeli jails obtain their freedom so that they may participate 
in the battle for building the Palestinian national authority 
and an independent state. 'Arafat rejected any attempt to 
categorize or divide the prisoners and insisted that all of them 
be treated equally. 
  'Arafat emphasized the need to close ranks and achieve 
national unity. He called on everyone to behave as one man and 
one heart, to think with responsibility, and to confront the 
immense challenges we are facing with all methods available. 
This, at a time when the Palestinians are knocking on the doors 
of independence and freedom under the PLO's leadership and the 
international community is looking forward to seeing the 
embodiment of Palestinian rights in a way that would end the 
suffering of our people and nation and provide them with the 
opportunity to build the life for which they have always 
dreamed. 'Arafat said that the Palestinian people have the 
right to live in security, dignity, stability, and prosperity. 
  'Arafat criticized the foot-dragging and procrastination 
inherent in Israeli policy on implementing the 
Palestinian-Israeli accord signed on 13 September in Washington. 
He described this policy as a rejected blackmail attempt that 
will only lead to wasting more time and deprive the peace 
process of credibility. 
  'Arafat held the Israeli Government responsible for this 
delay and the ensuing continuation of the cycle of violence in 
the occupied territories. He expressed the hope that Israel 
will stop procrastinating and will respond to realities and the 
requirements of the era on the dissemination of the climate of 
peace and stability among states and peoples. This requires 
that every people be guaranteed the right to self-determination 
and the establishment of its independent political entity over 
the soil of its homeland in accordance with the provisions of 
the United Nations and the resolutions of its institutions 
issued in this regard. 
  In this context, 'Arafat stressed the PLO's adherence to the 
Palestinian people's legitimate rights and said: The day of 
return is near and the attainment of our people's dream is not 
impossible but possible. We must achieve that dream regardless 
of how difficult the march may be and irrespective of the 
obstacles it faces.

Executive Committee; Palestinian Leadership Discussing National 
Authority Structure"] 
  [Excerpts] Tunis -- Informed Palestinian sources in Tunis 
have told AL-HAYAH that the PLO leadership is currently 
discussing the structure of the Palestinian national authority 
to agree on a final formula before submitting it to the 
Israelis. They added that the discussions have so far resulted 
in agreement to have figures from inside the occupied territory 
and figures from the diaspora equally represented in the 
authority body. [passage omitted] 
  Meanwhile, informed Palestinian sources have stated that 
'Abdallah Hurani, who had resigned from the PLO Executive 
Committee, has had a reconciliation with President Yasir 
'Arafat. Their reconciliation resulted in his appointment as 
head of the "Returnees Department" formerly headed by 
'Abd-al-Rahim Malluh, the representatiave of the Popular Front 
for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP] in the Executive 
Committee (who had also resigned). 
  Hurani, who, along with five other Executive Committee 
members, resigned after the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of 
Principles was signed on 13 September 1993, was previously head 
of the PLO's Cultural Department. 
  AL-HAYAH has learned that Malluh visited Tunis at the end of 
last week for the first time since resigning from the Executive 
Committee last September. He met with some prominent Fatah 
leaders and also probably met with President 'Arafat. This is 
considered to be the first meeting between the the PFLP and 
Fatah since the Declaration of Principles was signed.

  [Text] Cairo, QUDS PRESS -- Informed Palestinian sources 
have said that the PLO leadership recently completed the 
formation of the national authority that will manage the 
self-government's affairs in the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area 
in accordance with the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of 
Principles. 
  According to the Palestinian sources, who are close to the 
Cairo talks, Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat will personally 
head this authority, which will be announced at a later date. 
  The sources, who wished to remain anonymous, linked the 
announcement on the formation of this authority to the 
achievement of fundamental progress that ensures the 
Palestinians the beginning of the implementation of the 
Declaration of Principles. 
  The Palestinian sources told QUDS PRESS that "Israel's 
procrastination and its non-adherence to dates on which 
agreement had been reached forced the Palestinian leadership to 
postpone the announcement on the national authority's formation." 
  The Palestinian sources refused to provide details on the 
formation of this body but said that it will comprise 18 
members, 11 from the diaspora and seven from the occupied 
territories. The distribution of the authority's diaspora 
members will be as follows: Seven from the PLO Executive 
Committee, two from the Fatah Central Committee, and two 
independents. 
  The Israeli Government had called on the Palestinian 
leadership to announce the self-rule authority, but the PLO 
rejected this demand as premature. The Palestinian sources 
expressed the belief that the announcement on the formation of 
the authority might provoke internal conflicts, especially as 
there is no Palestinian authority inside the occupied 
territories to impose the law.

<F P=106> [By Muhammad Abu-Khudayr and Zaki Abu-al-Halawah] </F>
  [Excerpts] Jerusalem -- Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat, head of the 
Palestinian delegation to the bilateral talks in Washington and 
head of the elections committee, has stressed that it is not 
possible to hold elections for the Palestinian national 
authority before total agreement is reached on the interim stage. 
  In an exclusive interview with AL-QUDS, 'Urayqat ruled out 
the possibility of holding elections for the coming authority 
before the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and Jericho 
and their redeployment in the rest of the occupied territories 
and before the Israeli Civil Administration is dissolved. 
  'Urayqat disclosed that the date for these elections has 
been 
set for 15 October instead of July. He added: Any snag in the 
talks will lead to further delay. [passage omitted] 
  'Urayqat noted that the elections will be conducted under 
the 
patronage of the United Nations and the participation of the 
European Community, the Scandinavian countries, Japan, Canada, 
the United States, Russia, Egypt, and Jordan. 
  On the cost of these elections, 'Urayqat said: We cannot 
itemize the expenses, but we are talking about training and 
equipment that might cost more than $44 million. 
  'Urayqat affirmed that during the talks, the Palestinian 
side 
proposed that the elected council comprise 100 members and 
insisted on this, because that is an internal Palestinian matter 
and no one has the right to object to it. [passage omitted] 
  'Urayqat emphasized that there were no lists of Palestinian 
voters and that it was impossible to hold a census before two 
years. He said: Therefore, we have officially asked Israel to 
hand us the population lists of the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, 
and East Jerusalem. Israel has agreed, in principle, to do so. 
  'Urayqat added: After receiving the lists, we will verify 
them. Then election cards will be distributed to everyone in his 
own district, including the residents of East Jerusalem who will 
participate in the elections both as voters and candidates like 
other residents of the occupied territories. 
  As for the diaspora Palestinians, 'Urayqat said that the 
Oslo 
accord stipulates that the displaced persons listed in the 1967 
census cannot participate in the elections for practical reasons 
which will not deprive them of their future status. 
  In conclusion, 'Urayqat said that the 100 members elected to 
the self-rule council will automatically become members of the 
Palestine National Council.

  [Text] Brother Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat], president of the 
state of Palestine and chairman of the PLO Executive Committee, 
has asked Palestinian negotiators to open the file of the 
Palestinian martyrs who fell during confrontations with the 
Israeli occupation troops during the period of armed fedayeen 
action that was launched from Jordanian, Syrian, and Lebanese 
territories, in addition to the occupied territories. 
  Palestinian sources said that the Israeli authorities have 
been holding the bodies of more than 100 martyrs in morgues for 
over two decades, and that they refuse to hand them to their 
families. The sources explained that this request was passed on 
during the meetings that were held in Tunis over the past two 
days.

  [Text] Informed Palestinian sources have said that 
Damascus refused to receive Palestinian President Yasir 
'Arafat's envoy, whom he dispatched last week in an attempt to 
improve Syria's relationship with the chairman of the PLO 
Executive Committee. 
  'Arafat's envoy, who is a member of the PLO Executive 
Committee and who arrived unexpectedly in Damascus, returned 
without achieving anything because of the Syrian officials' 
refusal to receive him. 
  It has been learned that 'Arafat's envoy met Khalid 
al-Fahum, 
head of the Salvation Front, but nothing has been reported about 
what transpired at this meeting. 
  The PLO Executive Committee member who visited Damascus has 
reportedly said that he did not have a mission of reconciliation 
between the Syrian president and 'Arafat but that he traveled 
there "to perform a social duty."

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Abu-Mazin Tells AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT: </F>
Peace Negotiations Will Produce Independent Entity Linked With 
Jordan"] 
  [Text] Abu Dhabi, Amman, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- PLO 
Executive Committee member Mahmud 'Abbas (Abu-Mazin) expects 
developments in the peace process to crystallize into a form of 
an independent Palestinian entity linked with Jordan. 
  Abu-Mazin believes it is necessary to link Palestine with 
Jordan, even if full Palestinian independence is obtained 
because Jordan represents a basic and natural extension to 
Palestine. 
  He said: If a confederation is agreed with Jordan, it must 
be conducted in accordance with the free will of the two sides, 
and the confederation should be the outcome of the negotiations. 
  In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT during his visit to Abu 
Dhabi, Abu-Mazin said that it has not yet been agreed to hold a 
meeting between Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli 
Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres. He said it is likely that a 
meeting will be held directly between Israeli Prime Minister 
Yitzhaq Rabin and 'Arafat if the Cairo negotiations end this 
week. Abu-Mazin expects the final agreement to be signed next 
month. 
  He refused to give a specific date for the signing. He said: 
We do not want people to get frustrated if matters are delayed 
at the last moment. 
  Abu-Mazin described Rabin's statements on the settlements as 
very encouraging. He said that these statements represent a 
change in Rabin's view of the settlements, which began by 
differentiating between security and political settlement. 
  In Amman, in reply to a question put to him by AL-SHARQ 
AL-AWSAT, Jordanian Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali 
strongly denied that Crown Prince Hasan's call the day before 
yesterday for easing the administrative measures experienced by 
the people of the West Bank residing in Jordan carry any 
political dimensions. Dr. al-Majali said: "There is no 
political dimension for the measures. It is an administrative 
matter."

  [Excerpt] Jerusalem -- AL-NAHAR has learned that an 
internal dialogue among Palestinian factions that support and 
oppose the Palestinian-Israeli agreement is currently taking 
place inside and outside the occupied territories. The aim of 
this dialogue is to reach a draft joint agreement on unity in 
view of the conditions that will prevail in the occupied 
territories during the coming stage. 
  Fatah has invited all Palestinian political and militant 
forces to a comprehensive national dialogue. The invitation, 
extended by Ahmad Ghunaym, head of Fatah's office in Jerusalem, 
during a commemorative ceremony for martyr Khalil al-Wazir, 
said: We invite our brothers in Hamas [Islamic Resistance 
Movement], the Islamic Jihad, the Popular Front for the 
Liberation of Palestine, the People's Party, FIDA [Palestinian 
Democratic Union], and all our national movements to a 
comprehensive dialogue in order to affirm that this homeland 
does not belong to one organization but to the entire people.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" report] </F>
  [Text] Tunis -- President Yasir 'Arafat announced that 
6,000 Palestinian policemen, accompanied by their families, in 
addition to 100 body guards will enter Gaza and Jericho within 
the coming three weeks. President 'Arafat, who was speaking at 
a Fatah Central Committee meeting in Tunis, said that in the 
first stage 25,000 Palestinians will arrive in the self-rule 
area. 
  The Fatah Central Committee meetings witnessed heated 
debates 
and arguments between Hani al-Hasan on one hand, and Ahmad 
Quray' and Hakam Bal'awi on the other. Leaked information 
indicates that Ahmad Quray', head of the PLO Economic Department 
and head of the Palestinian delegation to the Paris economic 
talks with Israel, threatened that he will not go to Paris in 
protest of Hani al-Hasan's objections to and observations on the 
economic talks. 
  Differences within the Fatah Central Committee extended to 
Sakhr Habash, Muhammad Ghunaym, Major General Muhammad Jihad, 
and 'Abbas Zaki when they expressed their dissatisfaction over 
the current situation, especially following the Cairo accord. 
  According to Palestinian sources close to the Fatah Central 
Committee, the situation inside the committee became more 
aggravated after Muhammad Ghunaym, who is responsible for 
mobilization and organization in Fatah, submitted his 
resignation protesting the decisions about the higher national 
authority. 
  For his part, Ghunaym stressed that he did not submit his 
resignation nor was there any mediation for rescinding his 
resignation because it did not happen in the first place. 
  Ghunaym said that this session of the Fatah Central 
Committee 
meetings is devoted to drawing up the blueprint of the coming 
stage in Gaza and Jericho. He added that each committee member 
has his own views about this subject and that there were 
differences between some viewpoints. He explained that the 
Central Committee has not drawn up the final blueprint yet. 
  Other sources in the Central Committee emphasized that 
President 'Arafat expressed his anger at the visit by Mahmud 
'Abbas to the United Arab Emirates, stressing that 'Abbas went 
there without a decision by the leadership. Faruq Qaddumi, head 
of the PLO Political Department, backed 'Arafat on this issue. 
  The sources said that some Fatah Central Committee members, 
including Hani al-Hasan, voiced strong criticism at Nabil 
Sha'th's negotiating performance. They said that 'Arafat 
proposed to Hani al-Hasan to manage the negotiations with 
Sha'th. Al-Hasan told 'Arafat that in the past he had called 
for reassessing the negotiating reference point and adopting a 
policy of playing off the political blocs and persevering. 
Al-Hasan continued: What I said about the multilateral talks 
has proven to be true, but unfortunately it was ignored by the 
Palestinian leadership. 
  The Fatah Central Committee meetings will continue until the 
final perception of the Palestinian self-rule authority is drawn 
up. 
  It has been learned that President 'Arafat is disappointed 
with the Israeli position, which has engrossed the PLO in 
details while failing to broach the extent of the self-rule 
authority's powers.

<F P=106> [Report by Ibrahim Humaydi: "Hamas' Partners Support, </F>
Oppose, or Wait for Clarifications"] 
  [Text] Damascus -- The nine Palestinian factions which, 
along with the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), form the 
Palestinian Forces Alliance [PFA] opposed to the Oslo agreement, 
are divided into two groups in their reaction to Hamas' declared 
willingness to "call a truce" with Israel on certain conditions 
including withdrawal from the occupied territories. 
  Their different positions on the Hamas initiative, however, 
do not negate the fact that all the factions are "very 
reproachful" because they were not consulted before that 
"sensitive" position was taken, although some factions have 
declined to comment, awaiting "clarifications from Hamas 
leaders" who will meet with the leaders of the other factions 
next week. The meeting of the "central command" of the alliance 
of opposition forces, scheduled to be held on 19 April, was 
postponed "but that was because Hamas' leaders were unable to 
make the journey from Amman in view of the circumstances they 
were experiencing," according to Palestinian sources. 
  The sources told AL-HAYAH that Hamas is targeted by everyone 
because of its position and the fact that it is the only party 
operating effectively and aggressively in the territories. 
  Two trends have emerged within the Palestinian factions 
opposed to the Oslo agreement regarding the Hamas "truce." They 
are basically based on the various factions' positions, nature, 
and views on the Arab-Israeli conflict and the extent of their 
willingness to accept phased solutions for that conflict. The 
factions which support the "Palestinian national program" (the 
1974 phased program) have supported Hamas' new position and see 
it as "a positive development in the political thinking." They 
include the four factions which are PLO members, namely the 
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP] led by 
George Habash, the Democratic Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine [DFLP] led by Nayif Hawatimah, the Palestinian Popular 
Struggle Front [PPSF] led by Khalid 'Abd-al-Majid, and the 
Palestine Liberation Front [PLF] led by Abu-Nidal al-Ashqar 
(Yusuf al-Miqdah). 
  Those opposed to the new Hamas stance are the factions 
opposed to phased solutions such as the Popular Front for the 
Liberation of Palestine-General Command [PFL-GC] led by Ahmad 
Jibril, the Arab Liberation Front (Fatah-the Uprising) led by 
Colonel Abu-Musa, and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad Movement led 
by Fathi al-Shaqaqi. 
  All the factions, however, are unanimous in their "rebuke" 
for the Hamas leaders for not contacting them before taking that 
position. DFLP sources said "we would have liked to discuss the 
matter within the alliance so that we could announce a unified 
position by the alliance." The DFLP sources told AL-HAYAH that 
its representative in the alliance Qays al-Samarra'i (Abu-Layla) 
had suggested to them "in the early consultations before the 
announcement of the alliance that we would be prepared to adopt 
the points made regarding the questions of full Israeli 
withdrawal and the right of self-determination in return for a 
truce" with the Israelis. They added "Hamas should have 
discussed the matter within the alliance's central command." 
  DFLP sources stressed that there were "positive points in 
the 
main position announced by Hamas in an official statement 
because it marked the start of a realistic approach to the 
current developments and introduced a tangible crystallized 
alternative to the Oslo-Cairo agreements," but the same sources 
added that the Hamas initiative included three loopholes "of 
serious political implications." One, they said, was that Hamas 
appeared to be confining its handling of the Palestinian 
question to the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, including its call 
for a new leadership from the people of the West Bank and the 
Gaza Strip. That is a serious matter, they added, because it 
ignores the unity of the Palestinians at home and abroad. 
  The second loophole, according to these sources, is that 
Hamas ignored "the right of self-determination and just talked 
about Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank." 
  They also pointed out that Hamas "also ignored the refugee 
problem which is one of the main causes of the Palestinian 
people. That was the third dangerous point in the position of 
the brothers in Hamas." 
  The sources reaffirmed the DFLP's rejection of the fact that 
Hamas was treating the Palestinian question "as if it was a 
question of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, something we do 
not accept at all."

  [Excerpt] Jerusalem -- In the first Palestinian reaction 
to the agreement between Fatah and Hamas [Islamic Resistance 
Movement], Fatah Central Committee member 'Abbas Zaki said that 
this agreement affirms the futility of betting on Palestinian 
division and weakness. The agreement will lead to a unified and 
good performance that will enable us to look forward to a good 
future. Moreover, it will constitute the groundwork for 
expanding the circle of dialogue and finalizing formulas for 
Palestinian unity. 
  In an exclusive statement, Zaki added: This is the first 
time in history that the Palestinians have embarked on 
establishing an entity. That requires priority in caring for, 
protecting, and defending this entity. 
  Zaki stressed: In order to avoid what happened in other 
revolutions that ended painfully with the outbreak of civil 
wars, we will not allow those models to be repeated in 
Palestine. Therefore, we have continued and will continue the 
dialogue with all Islamic and national Palestinian forces and 
factions in a bid to avoid the specter of a civil war and 
infighting. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Gaza -- The repatriated deportee Jamal Zaqqut, 
member of the executive bureau of FIDA [Palestinian Democratic 
Union], said yesterday that the agreement between Hamas [Islamic 
Resistance Movement] and Fatah in the Gaza Strip is a step in 
the right direction and that FIDA welcomes this step, because it 
has come at a time when everyone is sensing the great 
significance of enhancing national unity and when meetings are 
being held among various national and Islamic forces. 
  Zaqqut called on all forces to consolidate dialogue and 
harmony in order to confront the tasks of the coming stage. He 
said that the inception of a national and Islamic authority in 
the Gaza Strip, on the basis of plurality and mutual respect of 
opinions, will lead to the establishment of a democratic 
foundation based on popular participation.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Dialogue Amid a New Reality"] </F>
  [Text] The satisfaction and welcome expressed by the 
Palestinian people's sons, both inside and outside the occupied 
territories, for the recent agreement between Hamas [Islamic 
Resistance Movement] and Fatah and for the launching of an 
expanded dialogue between various Palestinian national forces 
aimed at safeguarding the Palestinian supreme national interests 
affirm that this positive development constitutes, among other 
things, a response to the Palestinian street's desire to see 
that unity has been restored and democracy consolidated in the 
Palestinian arena. This, despite the different positions and 
views in the occupied territories on the interim stage agreement. 
  The timing of the agreement and dialogue confirm the depth 
of 
the realization by the various Palestinian national forces, 
whether those supporting or opposing the Oslo accord, that a new 
stage has begun in the life of our Palestinian people and that 
we are standing on the threshold of a new reality, which makes 
it incumbent on all to shoulder their national and historic 
responsibility. This, at a time when the occupied territories' 
sons are getting ready to set up the first Palestinian 
self-governing authority and hoping that this development will 
be a prelude to ending the occupation and building an 
independent Palestinian state. 
  From this premise, the comprehensive national dialogue 
derives immense significance. This dialogue, which relies on a 
firm basis of crucial common denominators linking the sons of 
one people, and which is based on democratic traditions 
reinforced by long years of struggle, should lead to the 
enhancement of Palestinian unity and spare it the dangers of 
fragmentation and infighting in the coming new stage. This 
stage requires every Palestinian effort to be directed toward 
construction. It also requires moving the new reality toward 
consolidating the Palestinian national authority and translating 
Palestinian aspirations for freedom and independence into 
tangible and responsible steps leading to the realization of 
this goal. 
  At a time when the Palestinians in general, and the occupied 
territories' sons in particular, expect the current dialogue to 
produce positive results that remove from the Palestinian arena 
the elements of weakness and enhance unity in confronting the 
new reality, we hope that the various Palestinian national 
forces will translate the slogans of unity and democracy into 
steps that strengthen those that have already been taken. 
Moreover, we hope that the pace of this translation will not 
only be in harmony with our approach to the new reality, but 
will approach this reality with a firm Palestinian body, able to 
confront the various developments and capable of waging the 
battle of construction with the same resolve that it showed in 
its long march toward freedom and independence.

<F P=106> [Report by Salwa al-Ustuwani: "Khamis Confirms Split From </F>
`General Command'"] 
  [Excerpt] Damascus, Amman, London, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- 
Mustafa Khamis, a Popular Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine--General Command [PFLP-GC] leader, has confirmed his 
split from the Front and the formation of a new command under 
his leadership called the Popular Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine--Islamic General Command. 
  In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT in his residence in 
Amman 
yesterday Khamis said that he has taken this step in protest at 
the attitude of the Front's leadership, saying that he had, on 
several occasions, asked the Front's Central Committee to form a 
special committee to investigate the accusations leveled at him 
by some officials in order to judge them and expel them from its 
ranks. But his requests fell on deaf ears and, as a result, some 
Central Committee members conspired against him and hence 
dismissed him as official in charge of the General Command on 
the Jordanian scene and action in the western sector of the 
occupied territories. 
  However, circles of the PFLP-GC led by Ahmad Jibril were 
surprised by these reports when AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT went to ask 
them about the causes that led to the split. 
  General Command officials expressed their astonishment at 
and 
rejection of the idea. An employee in Jibril's office told 
AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that it is a personal action, and the 
Palestinian issue does not need further splits and 
fragmentation. Such actions harm Palestinian struggle, which he 
is working to unify in order to confront the Israeli enemy, his 
practices, and his agreement with Palestinian President Yasir 
'Arafat. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" report] </F>
  [Text] There were strong verbal exchanges among senior PLO 
officials during last week's Fatah Movement meeting in Tunis. 
Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat chaired the meeting. 
  AL-BILAD learned that Ahmad Quray', alias Abu-'Ala', head of 
the PLO Economic Department and head of the Palestinian 
delegation to the Paris economic talks with Israel, lost his 
temper after a flare up over differences with Fatah Central 
Committee member Hani al- Hasan, who protested against 
Abu-'Ala's hasty verbal presentation of a report during the 
meeting. After al-Hasan's protest, Quray' openly threatened to 
not go back to Paris. He tore up the file of the 
Palestinian-Israeli negotiations, an indication that he is 
abandoning his pursuit of this issue. 
  An argument immediately erupted between Fatah Central 
Committee members Mahmud 'Abbas, alias Abu-Mazin, and Hakam 
Bal'awi. According to AL-BILAD's information, during the heated 
discussion, Hani al-Hasan said the head of the Israeli 
delegation briefed the Israelis in a televised seminar about the 
proceedings of the Paris negotiations, explaining the economic 
and political gains the Israeli side has achieved, especially on 
the subject of Palestinian currency, part of which will be kept 
in the Israeli Central Bank's reserves. 
  Al-Hasan said: This is a very serious issue that cannot be 
discussed in this way. All the provisions of the economic 
agreement should be laid down on the table and distributed so 
the members of Fatah Central Committee can closely examine them. 
  The sources said another strong verbal exchange occurred 
during the meeting when al-Hasan said the pro-Labor Party group 
within the Palestinian revolution leadership had implicated 
President 'Arafat in affairs in which the Fatah Movement should 
not have been involved. 
  According to AL-BILAD sources, Fatah is expected to hold 
another meeting when 'Arafat concludes his current tours.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Saddam Re-Forms `Popular Army'"] </F>
  [Excerpts] London, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Iraqi President 
Saddam Husayn has ordered the re-formation of the so-called 
"Popular Army," the ruling party's militia which Taha Yasin 
Ramadan led and which was disbanded after the end of the war 
with Iran. Elsewhere, Britain and France have warned Baghdad of 
the consequences of the attacks carried out recently against UN 
employees, correspondents, and foreign nationals in north Iraq. 
[passage omitted] 
  Regarding reports about the re-formation of the Popular Army 
in Iraq, Dr. Hamid al-Bayyati, representative of the Supreme 
Assembly of the Islamic Revolution in Iraq [SAIRI], said that 
Saddam has issued a decision to that effect, together with 
instructions concerning the details and rules governing the 
commanders and personnel of this army, which is tantamount to a 
militia for the ruling party. 
  Dr. al-Bayyati's statement, issued by the SAIRI support 
office in London, a copy of which AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has 
received, said that the authorities have designated several 
camps to train the battalions and brigades formed recently from 
partisan elements, on whom Saddam's instructions "imposed 
voluntary service," in Popular Army formations for six to 12 
months. 
  The statement pointed out that discontent has spread among 
ruling party elements. They expressed their discontent at 
Saddam's decision, which they believe means that the country is 
experiencing a serious political, military, and security crisis, 
and that they should expect an important event as a result of 
which they will become the victims of one of Saddam's whims 
manifested in his internal and external wars. 
  Dr. al-Bayyati pointed out that the Iraqi regime disbanded 
the Popular Army after the war with Iran because it had 
represented a huge financial burden for the regime and an 
administrative vacuum during the war. The statement added: It 
is also worth mentioning that, because the regime has been 
exposed to real dangers threatening its existence at this stage, 
and for the sake of staying in power, it has taken new steps to 
protect itself with more than one security cordon to allow it to 
maneuver and unleash its military forces to carry out tasks that 
are still shrouded in ambiguity and could be launched at any 
moment.

  [Text] Colombo, April 28 (AFP) -- Sri Lanka President 
Dingiri Banda Wijetunga has indefinitely postponed a planned 
visit to China amid a serious crisis within his ruling party, 
press reports here said Thursday [28 April]. 
  Wijetunga was due to leave on May 8 on a five-day tour of 
China which was to be his first foreign visit since coming to 
power in May last year. 
  State-run newspapers said Wijetunga had put off the trip 
indefinitely, but gave no reason for the move. However, the 
privately-ownned Sinhalese language Divaina newspaper said the 
decision was due to serious squabbling within his party. 
  Sections of the ruling United National Party (UNP) have 
openly questioned Wijetunga's ability to lead them to victory at 
national elections later this year, following the UNP's 
humiliating defeat at a local election last month. 
  The March 24 defeat in the southern provincial council 
elections, is seen as the most serious set back for the UNP 
since it came to power in 1977.

  [Text] Cairo, 28 Apr (MENA)--The Palestinian and Israeli 
negotiators today resumed their talks on the implementation of 
the Gaza-Jericho agreement. 
  Palestinian sources said that the security and legal 
committees stemming from the negotiations are now formulating 
the points agreed on during the talks held in the past few days 
and trying to resolve issues that have not yet been resolved. 
  The sources added that the negotiators are waiting for the 
outcome of Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat's talks with 
Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and U.S. Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher and also the outcome of Presidents 
'Arafat and Husni Mubarak's talks, which will have direct 
bearing on overcoming the disputed points between the 
Palestinians and Israelis. 
  The sources expect the two sides to reach an agreement next 
week on implementing the Gaza-Jericho agreement in preparation 
for the signing of the agreement by Palestinian President 
'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin under President 
Husni Mubarak's auspices.

  [Text] Riyadh, April 23 (AFP) -- Gulf Arab states have 
reservations about a U.S. document calling on them to encourage 
pluralism and democracy as the basis of future relations in the 
Middle East, Arab diplomats said here Saturday. 
  The document, presented to the six-nation Gulf Cooperation 
Council (GCC) in February, said the United States wanted to see 
participants in the multilateral Middle East peace talks 
"encourage individual and collective freedoms and pursue 
democracy and pluralism." 
  It said relations between states in the region should be 
based on such concepts in the future. 
  Foreign Ministry officials from GCC members Saudi Arabia, 
Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain and Oman met in 
Riyadh Saturday to discuss the document. They had 
"reservations" about the proposals, the diplomats said. 
  The ministry officials were to coordinate their positions on 
the document and review their participation in the multilateral 
talks, launched at the Madrid peace conference in 1991. 
  Of the six GCC states only Kuwait has a freely elected 
parliament with various political groups represented. 
  The other five have specially-appointed consultative 
assemblies. 
  On Tuesday the multilateral working group on water resources 
-- one of five set up in Madrid -- ended talks in Oman with 
agreements on five projects to boost scarce water supplies and 
establish Israeli-Arab cooperation. 
  The talks were attended by an Israeli delegation, visiting a 
Gulf Arab country for the first time ever. 
  Qatar is due to host a meeting of the working group on 
disarmament from May 2 to 5. 
  The other three groups deal with economic cooperation, 
refugees and the environment.
