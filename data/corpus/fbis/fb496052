  [Text] New York, April 27, IRNA -- Iran's Foreign Minister 
'Ali Akbar Velayati here Wednesday called on Security Council to 
untie the hands of the Bosnian Muslim and let them exercise 
their right to defend themselves. 
  Addressing the meeting of Organization of Islamic Conference 
(ICO) contact group here, Velayati said that the latest 
cold-blooded massacre in Gorazde which has resulted in death of 
700 and injury of more than 2,000 civilians is a vivid example 
of Serbian atrocities in Bosnia and the inaction and 
indifference of the international community towards these crimes 
against humanity. 
  "What is more disturbing is the fact that the Serbs continue 
to commit these crimes and violate Security Council resolutions 
particularly those related to the safe areas, with impunity, 
while the UN system is watching a gradual annihilation of one of 
its member states," said Velayati. 
  He underlined that the Islamic countries, from the 
beginning, 
have called for the lifting of the unjust arms embargo against 
the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The Iranian foreign minister, elsewhere in his speeches 
argued that the Security Council is unable or unwilling to 
implement its own resolutions, and thus destroying its 
credibility and legitimacy. "Now the question is what is the 
justification for the continuation of arms embargo? Why do some 
permanent members of the Council look after their short-sighted 
political interests at the expense of a nation?" he asked. 
  Velayati emphasized that the contact group should continue 
its hard work to press the UN particularly the Security Council 
for lifting the arms embargo and in case the Security Council 
fails due to veto, we should intensify our efforts to invoke the 
a "uniting for peace" resolution and convene an urgent session 
of the United Nations General Assembly. 
  We should continue to intensify humanitarian relief efforts 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina by establishing an air fleet to various 
parts of it, Velayati said, adding that the government of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran strongly endorses the convening of an 
emergency ministerial meeting of the full membership of the ICO 
as soon as possible.

<F P=106> [Report by Aluf Ben and Gay Bekhor] </F>
  [Excerpt] U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher will 
meet today twice with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and will hear 
from him the details of the "peace package" Israel is offering 
Syria. Christopher leaves for Damascus tomorrow to present the 
Israeli proposal to Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad. 
  The following are the components of the peace package: an 
Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights; setting up of full 
peace and full relations; security arrangements on the Golan; 
implementation of the arrangements in stages over several years; 
an exchange of ambassadors between Damascus and Jerusalem after 
the initial withdrawal stage. Israel will suggest to Syria to 
start deliberations in joint working groups on the details of 
the arrangement. 
  The package that will be handed over to Christopher will not 
detail the withdrawal line and will focus on Israel's security 
needs within the framework of the arrangement with Syria on the 
Golan, and in a parallel agreement to be signed with the United 
States, which will pledge to strengthen Israel. In his talks 
with Christopher, the prime minister will request that the 
Israeli-U.S. agreement will accord Israel security guarantees 
and will assure maintaining current aid levels, as well as the 
supply of advanced weaponry and intelligence information from 
satellites to the IDF [Israel Defense Forces]. The defense 
establishment is at present working on the list of requests to 
be made to the Americans. 
  The package to be presented to Christopher will include the 
principles of each of the components of the arrangement. The 
security arrangement will include deep demilitarization of the 
Syrian side and less deep demilitarization by Israel, thinning 
out of forces on both sides, the setting up of early warning 
stations on the Golan, and deployment of an international force 
on the plateau to supervise the arrangement. 
  Rabin will also reiterate his call to al-Asad to take public 
steps to assist in legitimizing the agreement among the Israeli 
public. 
  Israel expects progress in the arrangement with Syria to 
bring about simultaneous progress in the peace process with 
Jordan, Lebanon, and the other Arab states, except for Iraq, 
Iran, and Libya. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by unidentified correspondent in Tehran on 29 April] </F>
  [Text] On his arrival at the Mehrabad Airport in Tehran, 
the deputy prime minister of Bosnia-Herzegovina said: The 
Muslim nation of Bosnia-Herzegovina continues to appreciate the 
support and assistance by their brothers and sisters in Iran and 
will never forget this affection. We believe that Iran is our 
best friend and supporter in today's sorrowful crisis. 
  Referring to the condition in his country, Edib Bukvic 
stressed: After 20 days of aggression and the massacre of 
thousands of our compatriots, the war in Gorazde has relatively 
subsided. He warned: We believe that the Serbs are preparing 
for renewed attacks in northern and southern Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
The world today is amazed and saddened at the silence and 
indifference of the West and of Europe, who continue to profess 
the defense of freedom and human rights. 
  The Bosnian deputy prime minister asserted: Of course we 
rely on God, our people, and the support of friendly and 
fraternal countries such as Iran, but we insist upon the lifting 
of the arms embargo on Bosnia-Herzegovina, so we can resist this 
unjust aggression and war, and defend our homeland and beliefs.

<F P=106> [Interview with PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat by Marius Petrean </F>
in Bucharest; date not given: "Where Is the Peace We Have Been 
Talking About for the Past Seven Months?"] 
  [Text] [Petrean] More than seven months have passed since 
the "historic shaking of hands" in Washington. Are you 
disappointed with the way in which the peace process is evolving? 
  ['Arafat] Indeed, more than nine months have passed since 
the meetings in Oslo and eight months since the signing of the 
agreement in Washington, but I regret to have to say that 
nothing has been accomplished so far. 
  [Petrean] How do you explain the delays in the initially 
envisaged calender of the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations? 
  ['Arafat] The reason for this is the policy of 
procrastination and delay used by the Israeli Government, 
something that jeopardizes the peace process and places it in a 
dangerous situation. The Palestinian side has proven 
flexibility and full responsibility by trying to reach a 
so-called "peace of the brave men," despite the tough Israeli 
practices in the field and the continuation of the Israeli 
policy of killing and arresting Palestinian citizens, imposing 
traffic restrictions, and maintaining a military encirclement 
and economic isolation, something that makes the life of our 
citizens in the occupied territories very difficult and does not 
contribute in the least to the establishment of a favorable 
atmosphere for making further progress along the road of peace. 
  The massacre at Ibrahim's Mosque in Hebron is a telling 
example of the Israeli policy of colonialization and the Israeli 
Government's responsibility for having brought these colonists 
there and for having trained, armed, protected, and encouraged 
them to set up colonies in the towns and inhabited areas of the 
occupied territories. It is also a telling example of the 
procrastinating and eschewing policy practiced by the Israeli 
Government in the implementation of the accord and declaration 
of principles signed in Washington last September. 
  [Petrean] The attacks and acts of violence continue 
uninterrupted, particularly in the occupied territories. Do you 
believe that the Israeli-Palestinian "rejection front" is on the 
point of reaching its goal? How broad is, in your opinion, the 
current opposition against the peace process? 
  ['Arafat] One must realize that the delay in the 
implementation of the peace process will increase the number of 
people in both camps who oppose this process. The general 
feeling, which is increasingly growing day by day, particularly 
among the Palestinians, is that the peace process is futile and 
that it has failed because of the stubbornness and shunning of 
the Israeli side. This feeling not only represents the personal 
stand of several individuals, but is a pervading feeling 
justified by the growing distrust in this peace process and its 
usefulness. I have repeatedly warned that the delay in the 
implementation of the peace process and in the achievement of 
palpable results may turn the peace process against itself and 
put it in a dangerous situation! Well, the present is just 
proving this point, which cannot be ignored, since the acts of 
violence are on the increase on both sides and the hopes that 
the Israeli Government will favorably respond to the so-called 
"peace of the brave men" offered by the PLO -- and successively 
endorsed by the Palestinian National Council (parliament) in its 
sessions -- are getting dashed. The Palestinian people are 
fully engaged in the peace process and want peace. But more 
than that, the Palestinian people want to live in peace and do 
not want mere empty words uttered in a handsome way or brilliant 
festivities and promises that are invalidated by the official 
Israeli practice and by the actions carried out by the Israeli 
colonists in the occupied territories. Now, I would also like 
to ask a few questions. Where is the peace we have been talking 
about for the past seven months? Where is the peace, when the 
Israeli occupation against our people's freedom continues? 
Where is the peace... when the Israeli prisons are full of 
Palestinian citizens? Where is the peace... when the killing, 
wounding, and humiliation of Palestinian citizens keep repeating 
themselves day by day? Where is the peace... when the economic, 
commercial, and financial isolation is practiced as a constant 
policy? Where is the peace... when armed extremist colonists 
are doing what they want in Palestinian towns and villages, 
without having to answer to any laws? What shall I tell my 
people? Shall I tell them that the peace process is useless, 
since the Israelis are not serious and the cochairmen of the 
peace process are making no effort to implement the provisions 
of the peace accord? Shall I tell them that the other 
international forces and the international community are also 
doing nothing in this respect? 
  [Petrean] Is the PLO ready to ensure the rule of law and 
order in Gaza and Jericho after the Israeli withdrawal? What 
kind of social regime does the future Palestinian self-governing 
authority plan to establish? Is democracy desired and possible? 
  ['Arafat] Palestinian democracy is no illusion or figment 
of the people's imagination but a reality of the Palestinian 
people within the PLO, a reality with a long-standing tradition. 
Thanks to their originality, keen awareness, and feeling of full 
responsibility, the Palestinian people have managed to preserve 
and are still preserving this democracy, even during the 
Palestinian revolution (known as the "Democracy of the Forest of 
Guns"). Therefore, any future of the Palestinian people in a new 
state of their own depends on the total and full application of 
democracy and on its conscious and responsible practice, since 
democracy is the citadel that protects the Palestinian people's 
achievements. It is the citadel that preserves the order and 
supervises the unity of the people and their parties and 
institutions operating inside and outside the Palestinian 
territories. All draft laws and the temporary Constitution 
confirms, supports, and promotes this reality. 
  [Petrean] The PLO has estimated that at least $13 billion is 
needed in the next 10 years to promote economic reconstruction 
and meet basic social requirements. What are the financing 
possibilities available to you? What overall economic strategy 
do you envisage? 
  ['Arafat] I would like to emphasize the huge burden of 
responsibility on the shoulders of the Palestinian National 
authority for the future reconstruction of the occupied 
territories, since we are obliged to start from zero and even 
from below zero. The long years of the Israeli occupation have 
brought the Palestinian territories, society, institutions, 
governmental bodies, and national councils into a disastrous 
state, something that has hurt the entire infrastructure; 
consequently, we will have to rebuild this infrastructure basis 
in its entirety. 
  Therefore, the PLO and the Palestinian National Authority -- 
fully aware of their huge responsibility in this respect -- are 
doing everything possible to implement their economic program in 
the financial and production sectors, so as to begin Palestine's 
reconstruction as soon as possible. As you know, this requires 
ensuring the necessary financial means for implementing these 
projects and plans. We are now in the process of establishing 
contacts with the relevant international financial institutions 
and with the funds of the credit countries, which can grant 
assistance and the necessary financial means. However, this is 
a very difficult and slow process, which does not meet the 
immediate requirements of beginning the reconstruction work. 
  [Petrean] Do you believe that Romania, which has always had 
very good relations with the PLO, can participate in the 
Palestinian reconstruction? What role can be played by Romanian 
businessmen? 
  ['Arafat] We believe that a large part of the development 
projects in Palestine should be done through bilateral 
cooperation with friendly countries, countries that want to help 
the Palestinian people and participate alongside them in the 
development of Palestine. As you have said, 
Romanian-Palestinian relations, at both the official or popular 
level, have always been warm and sincere. We believe that the 
friendship between the two peoples provides for a favorable 
basis for increasing bilateral economic cooperation, and we hope 
that Romania will play an important role, both at the 
governmental and private sector levels, in the reconstruction of 
the Palestinian infrastructure. We welcome this role. 
  [Petrean] Looking slightly ahead, how do you think the 
problem of the Jewish settlements in the occupied territories 
should be solved? What about Jerusalem? 
  ['Arafat] The problem of the colonies and Jerusalem should 
be discussed as soon as possible after the implementation of the 
agreements on Gaza and Jericho, within a period that should not 
exceed the beginning of the third year after the implementation 
of this accord. Let us not forget that these colonies are not 
legal from a juridic point of view; nor are they legal from an 
international viewpoint, particularly in view of the UN 
decisions of the 4th Geneva Convention of 1949. Prime Minister 
Yitzhaq Rabin told me not long ago that he intends to liquidate 
the colonies. 
  Regarding the holy Arab Jerusalem, it is subject to Decision 
242 of the UN Security Council regarding the Arab and 
Palestinian territories occupied after 1967. The problem of 
Jerusalem is also covered by Decision 904 of the UN Security 
Council, which considers Jerusalem as part of the territories 
occupied at the respective time (1967). 
  Likewise, the Israeli United Workers Party sees the 
possibility of creating two capitals in Jerusalem for the two 
states, and we support this idea.

<F P=106> [Gennadiy Charodeyev report: "Treaty With Pyongyang on </F>
Military Assistance Still Valid"] 
  [Text] "In accordance with the existing treaty between the 
USSR and the DPRK Russia will provide North Korea with 
assistance in the event of unprovoked aggression against it, but 
it will decide this solely on the basis of its own analysis," 
Russia Deputy Foreign Minister Aleksandr Panov has said during a 
meeting with journalists. 
  The news agencies took these words as an expression of 
support for Kim Il-song's regime. However, the Foreign Ministry 
took a calm view of that. They gave IZVESTIYA the following 
explanation: 
  "The Treaty on Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual 
Assistance 
between Moscow and Pyongyang was signed in 1961. This document 
has no time limit -- the sides automatically extend it every 
five years. In 1995 we will decide whether to extend it for 
another term or sign a new treaty with North Korea. It is valid 
today, albeit pro forma, and this means that Russia would 
provide the DPRK with the requisite assistance if it decided 
that Pyongyang was the victim of aggression. What is more, 
under existing legislation the North Koreans will only receive 
military assistance once parliament has adopted a corresponding 
decision," a Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman stressed. 
  During his conversation with journalists Aleksandr Panov had 
described the situation on the Korean Peninsula as "teetering on 
the brink of war." 
  In the deputy minister's opinion, Moscow's recent initiative 
calling for the convocation of an international conference 
involving the six interested states -- China, the United States, 
Japan, Russia, the DPRK, and the ROK -- along with 
representatives of the United Nations and the International 
Atomic Energy Agency, is in the interests of a settlement on the 
Korean peninsula.

<F P=106> [Maksim Yusin report: "Moscow Does Not Want To Fall Out </F>
With Washington and Seoul Over Kim Il-song's Nuclear Ambitions"] 
  [Text] "There has been no change in Russia's position on 
the Korean crisis. The main thing for us is for Pyongyang to 
meet its obligations under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. 
If the UN Security Council considers a resolution requiring 
North Korea to admit International Atomic Energy Agency 
inspectors to its nuclear installations, Russia's representative 
will vote in favor," Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Aleksandr 
Panov, who is responsible for the Far East region at the Foreign 
Ministry, said during an interview with IZVESTIYA. 
  It was Panov's statement to journalists early this week that 
caused a slight shock around the world. News agencies carried 
flashes that Moscow intends to observe the 1961 treaty between 
the Soviet Union and the DPRK and offer Pyongyang assistance "in 
the event of unprovoked aggression." 
  "My words were taken out of context," Panov explained. "When 
answering the journalist's questions I only reiterated our 
position, which contains nothing new; it was formulated a year 
ago. Russia as the legal successor to the USSR will fulfill its 
commitments under the 1961 treaty. However, mindful of the fact 
that the world situation is totally different now, we will act 
on the basis of our own analysis, act in Russia's interests, and 
take into consideration not only the treaty with North Korea, 
but also our country's other international commitments, 
including on nuclear nonproliferation." 
  You could see from what the deputy minister said that he 
wanted to place the emphasis on the latter part of his answer 
but journalists focused their attention on the first sentence. 
As a result a distorted notion of Russia's approach developed. 
Nevertheless, Panov asserts that both Seoul and Washington have 
correctly appraised the situation. 
  Moscow quite possibly had to provide additional explanations 
to ensure that. Be that as it may, U.S. State Department 
spokesman Michael McCurry said Wednesday that his country does 
not feel worried by what the Russian diplomat said. And South 
Korean President Kim Yong-sam, acknowledging Russia's role in 
settling the crisis, has decided to send Foreign Minister Han 
Sung-chu to Moscow. According to reports from Smolenskaya 
Square [Russian Foreign Ministry], the visit, the dates of which 
have not yet been agreed, will presumably go ahead in the second 
half of April. 
  While trying to exploit the situation on the Korean 
Peninsula 
to strengthen its positions in Asia, Russia is at the same time 
by no means keen to fall out with Washington and Seoul over 
Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions. Significantly, Moscow, unlike 
Beijing, is willing to back a UN Security Council resolution 
designed to step up international pressure on the "great 
leader." Russia has no wish to gain a reputation as the patron 
of a loathsome Communist regime. And however much people in 
Pyongyang may recall a treaty dating back 33 years, its 
significance should hardly be overestimated. 
  In conversation with IZVESTIYA Aleksandr Panov admitted that 
"unprovoked aggression" by any state against the DPRK is 
virtually impossible at the moment. Consequently there are no 
grounds for talking, even hypothetically, about military aid for 
Kim Il-song from Moscow.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Nadein report: "Washington Fears North Korea </F>
Because It Does Not Understand Kim Il-song"] 
  [Text] Washington -- U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry 
has called the decision to prepare for war with the DPRK a 
"sensible precaution." 
  The DPRK, which has the oldest of the totalitarian Communist 
regimes still existing on the planet, says that it is prepared 
to return to the negotiating table, but it is flexing its 
muscles. According to U.S. intelligence information, leave has 
been canceled in the North Korean Army. Large units have been 
moved up to the border. Combat readiness is being reinforced by 
a propaganda campaign portraying war (provoked by U.S. 
imperialists, of course) as inevitable and victorious. 
  The U.S. defense secretary said that the bellicose speeches 
in Pyongyang do not signify an immediate danger of war. He 
announced a series of measures designed to discourage Pyongyang 
from attacking. Dictatorial regimes have their own logic, 
however. If Kim Il-song, North Korea's aged sovereign, takes it 
into his head that his autocratic rule is in danger, he might 
resort to any measures. U.S. officials have admitted that 
Pyongyang's logic is beyond them. "We have an extremely limited 
idea of what guides the North Korean Government in 
decisionmaking," the U.S. defense secretary said at a news 
conference. 
  Some analysts believe that on the threshold of a blockade 
Pyongyang might decide on a massive offensive by its army of 
more than 1 million men. Last week the official DPRK agency 
warned that UN sanctions would trigger a war. 
  U.S. troops have been based in the south of the peninsula 
since the early fifties, when the Korean war ended. There have 
been no substantial personnel reductions there, as distinct from 
all other operational large units abroad. Total personnel 
strength is equal to 37,000. The ROK Army has 650,000 men. 
  Neither Washington nor Seoul intends to increase the size of 
its armed forces in the immediate future. But the Pentagon has 
put on red alert its air forces designed for destroying tanks. 
It has been proposed that the ROK, a wealthy country with a 
positive trade balance with the United States, urgently acquire 
combat helicopters, radar trailers for artillery, and ABM 
systems from America. 
  The U.S. defense secretary said that none of the steps being 
taken by Washington and Seoul is dramatic in itself. Taken as a 
whole, however, they will make it possible to place tactical 
deterrents in a full state of readiness within a few days. The 
secretary plans to visit South Korea in mid-April, i.e. at 
approximately the time the Patriot missiles will be deployed 
there. 
  The Patriots made a name for themselves when they downed 
Scuds, Iraqi intermediate-range missiles, during the war in the 
Persian Gulf in 1990. The Scuds were based on obsolete Soviet 
models. North Korean specialists and enterprises were involved 
in modernizing them. 
  Russia is participating in the international inspection 
being 
conducted under UN auspices, and its special ties with the DPRK 
have vanished into the remote past. The recent expulsion from 
Moscow of several North Korean diplomats for attempts to entice 
Russian nuclear scientists has worsened relations. 
  China, which was the mainstay of the DPRK's ground forces at 
the time of the Korean war, now takes a cautious stand. To all 
appearances, Beijing, which is rigidly opposed to U.S. pressure 
on the question of human rights, does not intend to complicate 
still further its relations with Washington over Kim Il-song's 
nuclear ambitions, which are alien to it.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Golts article: "Korean Crisis Continues -- That </F>
Someone Wants It To"] 
  [Text] The crisis now threatening the security of the 
whole Asian-Pacific region as well as the Korean Peninsula can 
be called anything but unexpected. Suspicions have been 
circulating for a few years to the effect that North Korea is 
secretly developing nuclear weapons. Complex diplomatic 
maneuvers were needed to get Pyongyang to accede to the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty. And even then it did not prove 
possible to carry out the kind of inspections that would have 
completely dispelled International Atomic Energy Agency 
specialists' doubts. Direct talks between Pyongyang and 
Washington regarding the terms for such inspections and 
guarantees of the peninsula's becoming a nuclear-free zone have 
been under way for over a year. The United States was even 
willing to give up the "Team Spirit" maneuvers, which have 
always caused DPRK leaders particular irritation. But even then 
the inspectors say that obstacles were put in their way. 
  The upshot being that all the talks have been frustrated. 
The sides exchange the kind of statements that, if they are 
taken seriously, it may seem that North and South Korea have 
really reached the point of another war. The most striking 
thing is that the interests of the main parties to the conflict 
can be glimpsed increasingly clearly behind the seemingly 
determined actions to settle the crisis situation. Interests 
which only have an indirect bearing on an actual settlement, 
moreover. 
  Take the question of economic sanctions against the DPRK 
which have been discussed at such length. It turns out that 
people in Seoul and Tokyo are more afraid of these sanctions 
being introduced than people in Pyongyang. The DPRK's neighbors 
are afraid that these sanctions may destroy the already shaky 
North Korean economy. Which in turn might impel this country's 
leaders to take desperate adventurist action. 
  It also incidentally turns out that Japan is North Korea's 
second [biggest] trading partner after China. Every year 
billions of yen come from Koreans living in Japan to their 
relatives in the DPRK. Which then go back to Japan to buy the 
goods that the DPRK needs. 
  Washington may even reap certain dividends from this crisis. 
The United States has of late had problems with its allies in 
Asia. For instance, it has become increasingly difficult to 
extract concessions from Tokyo in the field of trade and the 
economy. The situation on the Korean Peninsula reminds both 
Tokyo and Seoul that their security depends on the U.S. military 
presence. 
  In principle what is happening is extremely useful for 
Chinese diplomacy. Beijing's relations with a number of states, 
primarily the United States, have deteriorated now owing to 
differences of approach to the problem of human rights. 
Washington is threatening to cancel its most-favored-nation 
status in trade. The Korean crisis clearly shows Beijing to be 
the key participant in a settlement, capable of influencing 
Pyongyang's position. 
  Finally, for all the risks involved in the game that 
Pyongyang is playing it may also bring dividends to it too. If 
DPRK leaders succeed in finding the requisite balance between 
promises to allow inspectors in on the one hand and threats on 
the other hand, they may obtain more than the cancellation of 
the maneuvers. 
  I will not say that this crisis was provoked specially. But 
the strange inertia in the attempts to settle it shows that 
almost every one of the active participants intends to use the 
situation in their own interests. Was that not why Russia's 
proposal to hold an international conference regarding the 
problems of the Korean peninsula's nuclear-free status viewed so 
coolly? After all, multilateral efforts do nonetheless limit 
certain states' freedom of maneuver.

<F P=106> [Vissarion Sisnev report: "Washington and `Chicken Kiev.' </F>
Review of U.S.-Russian Relations Is Going on Behind the Scenes"] 
  [Text] Washington -- Monday 28 March will go down in 
history as the day when, for the first time, a special briefing 
was organized in the White House for the Russian press corps 
accredited to the U.S. capital. Admittedly, this event was 
organized not by the principal occupant of the White House but 
by one of his staff, but it was a major event nonetheless. The 
briefing was organized to deal with a topic that is of utmost 
importance to us: The state of U.S.-Russian relations. On the 
whole the essence of what was said boils down to what Secretary 
of State Christopher stated on television last Sunday: Russia 
remains one of the administration's foreign policy priorities 
and it will offer every possible assistance in order to 
strengthen the democratic market road of development. 
  There is no reason to doubt that this is how things will be. 
Just as there is no doubt that relations between our countries 
are visibly becoming more strained or at any rate less 
unequivocal -- a touch of what I would describe as rivalry has 
clearly crept in. Former President George Bush, a Republican, is 
being reproached because he was the first to have adopted a 
"Russia first" course, and because he arrived in Kiev after 
Moscow and "lectured" the Ukrainian leadership on the 
desirability of friendly cooperation with Russia. At the time 
the press christened this episode "Chicken Kiev," thus alluding 
to the second meaning that the word "chicken" has for Americans: 
weakness of character. 
  Eminent observers here believe that Clinton has not only 
inherited this "Chicken Kiev," he has recently started to "have 
another think about it." At the White House briefing the 
changes were expressed in the same mild wording that was used in 
Moscow: The "honeymoon" in U.S.-Russian relations is over. At 
the same time it was stressed that they certainly cannot be 
described as being in crisis. On this there is clear agreement 
with Russian Foreign Minister A. Kozyrev, who described the 
present stage as "mature partnership" in an article published in 
the THE NEW YORK TIMES. 
  But this is seemingly the only thing which the denizens of 
Washington's corridors of power agree with in Kozyrev's program 
article entitled "You Should Not Frighten Us." For example, 
Professor Perlmutter, the well-known political analyst and 
editor of the magazine STRATEGIC STUDIES, thought that "Minister 
Kozyrev has started to talk the language of the Cold War." He 
took extreme exception to the accusation that "new chauvinist 
banners are fluttering in the air in Washington" and that the 
United States is striving to achieve "world hegemony." 
Perlmutter says that he is "slightly irritated" by the 
minister's tendency to include areas of "the former Soviet 
empire" in his concept of "our national interests," that is to 
say Belorussia [Belarus], Ukraine, and Kazakhstan. And there is 
much else besides he does not like about A. Kozyrev's position. 
  It would be a small misfortune if just one expert or 
journalist were to get up and openly voice the question: "What 
precisely is the difference between 'national interests' 
according to the democrat Kozyrev on the one hand and the 
so-called reactionaries and ultranationalists on the other?" 
Especially as the specific accusations always boil down to the 
"unexpected interference" by Russia in the Bosnian crisis, 
thanks to which NATO air power has not been used to launch 
strikes against the Serbs. But it is quite clear that in 
addition to this unexpected briefing for the Russian press, 
other briefings are also being organized in Washington -- at a 
much higher level and with franker remarks on the very same 
topic. President Clinton spent one and a half hours chatting 
with representatives of ethnic minorities of East European 
origin, and one of the people who is closest to him -- Deputy 
Secretary of State Talbott -- has met with ambassadors of East 
European and Baltic countries. 
  Judging by information which somehow leaked out of these 
meetings, we must draw the unambiguous conclusion that a review 
of relations with Russia is going on behind the scenes. We are 
not talking about a return to the mores of nuclear and political 
confrontation. However, again and again we are hearing a term 
which dates from that unfortunate period, namely "containment." 
The State Department's guests were informed that up to now the 
United States has not paid enough attention to states bordering 
on Russia, but from now on all this will change because, 
according to informed U.S. colleagues, "the United States and 
the West cannot basically ignore the legitimate concerns of 
these countries which have been provoked by Russian 
expansionism." 
  It is also claimed that President Clinton has privately 
intimated that if Russian expansionist behavior spills over the 
borders of East European states, the United States will 
immediately change its position with regard to admitting East 
European countries to NATO. This is reported, for example, by 
the consistently well-informed R. Evans and R. Novak in THE 
WASHINGTON POST. They also believe that the pressure of public 
opinion polls is "drawing Clinton away from a love affair with 
Russia." They are referring to the fact that ethnic minorities, 
who put together constitute millions of voters, did not forgive 
Bush for his "chicken Kiev," and naturally they will not forgive 
the current President if he continues the "love affair." It 
should also be remembered that before breaking for the Easter 
vacation, the Senate adopted a resolution warning that the 
United States would rebuff "by all appropriate means" any 
Russian attempt to exert pressure on East Europe or the Baltic 
states. 
  The conclusion? It was summarized by Evans and Novak in 
yesterday's article: "Bill Clinton and Strobe Talbott are the 
last people in the world you would suspect of wanting to return 
to the Cold War. But they are unambiguously letting it be known 
that they no longer intend to overlook Russia's imperialist 
aspirations." Let us not get into an argument about how 
justified the term "imperialist" is. Let us simply take it as 
given that on this side of the Atlantic, Russian foreign policy 
is for one reason or another being presented in this manner. In 
print, with quotations from the highest authorities. It seems 
the U.S.-Russian "honeymoon" really is over. It is a pity, but, 
as they say, nothing lasts for ever and we must see things for 
what they really are.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Aleksey Berezhkov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow March 29 TASS -- "The actions of the Russian 
leadership and the results of the country's economic development 
during the first three months of 1994 have confirmed the Russian 
Government's and president's determination to continue the 
course of reforms," Russian vice-premier and economics minister 
Aleksandr Shokhin said during the opening of a roundtable here 
today. It is being attended by representatives of the Russian 
Government and business circles and a U.S. delegation led by 
Secretary of Commerce Ronald Brown. 
  "Voiced during the past two months, including in the United 
States, were doubts about the Russian Government's readiness to 
continue the course of reforms," Shokhin said. "I think nobody 
has such doubts now." 
  "The rates of inflation in February and March," he noted, 
"were the lowest as compared to 1992 and 1993. The January 
upsurge of inflation can be largely explained by heightened 
inflationary expectations, provoked for purely political 
reasons. They were in no way linked with the government's 
economic efforts." 
  "The orientation of the Russian Government's reformist 
efforts," Shokhin stressed, "are confirmed by the recently 
reached agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), 
which is to grant Russia the second part of the envisaged system 
credit. The agreement with the IMF is important for us not only 
because a decision is to be adopted this April on granting 
Russia a 1.5 billion dollars credit. This sum, frankly speaking, 
is not decisive for our national economy's financial development 
and investment process," Shokhin noted. "It is important for us 
as proof of the international economic and financial community's 
readiness to back the Russian reforms." 
  On the other hand, according to Shokhin, the reached 
agreements should pave the way for an IMF decision to grant 
Russia a reserve credit, to an agreement with the Paris Club on 
the postponement of payments for the debts of the former USSR, 
which are to be made in 1994. Moreover, the World Bank is 
expected to pass a decision not later than June to grant the 
second rehabilitation credit to Russia, amounting to 600 million 
dollars. 
  The visit of the delegation of the U.S. Department of 
Commerce is proceeding at a time when trade exchange between the 
two countries is expanding. According to data received from the 
Russian Foreign Ministry (the Department for Economic 
Cooperation between the United States and Russia) Russia had a 
deficit of 2.2 billion dollars in trade with the United States 
in 1992. The export of Russian goods to the United States 
trebled in 1993, growing from 693.9 millions to 2.05 billion 
U.S. Dollars. But a slight deficit remained, because Russia 
imported 2.2 billion dollars worth of goods from the United 
States that year. 
  According to a reference note, released by the U.S. 
Department of Commerce before Ronald Brown's visit, American 
exports to Russia reached three billion dollars in 1993, which 
is 40 per cent more than in 1992. American imports from Russia 
grew by 262 per cent and amounted to 1.7 billion dollars in 
1993. Nevertheless, the sum total of American investments in 
Russia is still very small and amounts, according to some 
estimates, to only one billion dollars, which were invested by 
American companies based in Western Europe. Nevertheless, the 
United States believes there are great potentialities for 
capital investments in Russia, especially in the oil and gas 
industry.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Pavel Vanichkin] </F>
  [Text] Washington, 31 Mar -- In a talk with an ITAR-TASS 
correspondent, Oleb Lobov, secretary of the Russian Security 
Council, who is on a visit to the United States, described his 
meetings on Wednesday with high-ranking representatives of the 
American administration as frank and constructive. 
  The main focus of attention at the meeting with Nicholas 
Burns, special assistant to the U.S. President for affairs of 
Russia, Ukraine, and Eurasia, was paid to getting to know the 
work of the National Security Council's Russian department, 
which he heads, Lobov noted. 
  We came to the conclusion that there is a need to establish 
permanent contacts and to reach agreement, and that Burns should 
pay a visit to Moscow in the future. We also handed the 
American side a draft memorandum on cooperation between the U.S. 
National Security Council and the Russian Security Council. The 
document establishes the machinery of cooperation and stipulates 
the periodicity of meetings and the field of questions to be 
discussed. Such questions should include topical international 
problems, peacemaking activities, and coordination of policy 
toward various countries and regions. 
  We then had a meeting with James Collins, ambassador at 
large 
for the new independent states, Lobov continued. We talked 
mainly about the prospects for cooperation between Russian 
analysts and American experts on Russia and other countries of 
the CIS working in the State Department, which should be aimed 
at joint study of the situation in Russia and other countries, 
and also the drafting of proposals for political leaders. 
  At a meeting with David Binney, acting director of the FBI, 
what interested us most were questions of combating organized 
crime, Lobov noted. Russia and the United States could expand 
cooperation in combating organized crime, the drug barons, 
economic crimes connected with evasion of taxes and customs 
duties, and illegal exportation of goods. I think such 
cooperation will be of benefit to both countries.

Kikilo] 
  [Text] Moscow March 30 TASS -- Russia and the United States 
signed agreements on trade and economic cooperation in Moscow on 
Wednesday. 
  Russian Vice-Prime Minister Aleksandr Shokhin and visiting 
U.S. Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown signed a joint statement 
giving the two countries access to each other's markets. Brown 
and Russian Minister of Foreign Economic Relations Oleg Davydov 
signed a memorandum to establish American business centres in 
Russia, a joint statement to improve terms of cooperation in 
medical industry and a document on the American-Russian Business 
Development Committee. 
  "We attach great importance to the visit to Russia by a 
representative U.S. delegation led by Secretary of Commerce Ron 
Brown," Davydov said. "Two days is not enough to solve all our 
questions which have piled up since the cold war era. But we 
have moved along this path. This is proved by the documents we 
have signed. They allow our trade and economic ties to develop 
more successfully. Additionally, we discussed issues which 
still impede our cooperation, including flaws in Russian laws 
and the difficulties which remain in the American trade laws 
with respect to Russian manufacturers," he said. 
  Davydov said that American colleagues understand the need of 
lifting trade restrictions on Russian goods and assured him that 
the U.S. will take concrete steps in this direction. [sentence 
as received] 
  The committee plans to hold its next meeting in Washington 
in 
June 1994 to discuss large American investments in Russia. "We 
have pledged to provide maximum state support for these 
projects. This particularly concerns the Sakhalin-2 project and 
the development of the Timano-Pechora oil deposit," the minister 
said. 
  Another key issue do be discussed in June will be the 
removal 
of barriers hampering Russian-American trade and economic 
cooperation.

  [Text] Russia can count on an additional $1 Bn [Billion] 
credit from the American Exxim Bank. The fact was disclosed in 
an exclusive interview for Interfax by the Russian Deputy 
Prime-Minister for Economics Aleksandr Shokhin. 
  Earlier the American bank agreed with the Russian side on a 
$2 Bn credit most of which was to be spent on imports of 
American equipment and technologies. 
  According to the official the additional credit will be 
given 
at the same terms and be used to purchase oil and gas equipment 
and modernize Russian industrial facilities which possess a high 
export potential "which can guarantee the repayment of the 
credits," Shokhin stressed. 
  He also said that while the Russian government is taking 
steps to protect foreign investments from political risks, it is 
also inclined to apply stricter requirements to foreign 
investors. 
  "Even now the offers of foreign investments under government 
guarantees are two times greater than the amount we can actually 
use. Some banks put forward as a condition of investment the 
submission of detailed financial and statistical reports about 
certain companies for the past ten years. I doubt whether we 
can and should do that," Shokhin said. 
  On increasing the country's export potential he said that 
the 
Ministry of Economics is determined to work for the abolition of 
all export quotas. In his opinion Russian manufacturers need 
the removal of quotas on oil products the domestic demand for 
which has sharply dropped, as well as the gradual reduction of 
quotas on crude oil. "Otherwise we will really be forced to 
close down productive oil-fields." Shokhin also said that the 
export quotas for the second quarter of this year can serve as 
an indication of the efforts of his ministry in this direction.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Boris Krivoshey and </F>
Aleksandr Krylovich] 
  [Text] Moscow March 31 TASS -- The Russian president's 
envoy for former Yugoslavia, Vitaliy Churkin, described as "a 
great political recklessness" possible violations of the 
agreement signed in Zagreb yesterday on a ceasefire and 
withdrawal of troops and weapons from the delimitating line in 
Croatian areas under U.N. control. 
  Addressing on Thursday a news conference in Moscow, Churkin 
gave his assessment of chances that the agreements reached 
between Croatia and Serb Krajina will be observed. 
  The Russian diplomat described the latest document signed by 
the warring factions as "a special case" in contrast to previous 
agreements which had been frequently broken. This time, Churkin 
stressed, "Russia, the United States, the European Union and 
U.N. stand behind the parties to the agreement." Thus, "the 
party daring to violate the accord would challenge not only the 
other side in the conflict but also to these key members of the 
world community," Russia's envoy noted. 
  Furthermore, the point at issue at the moment is an 
all-round 
agreement, "rather a complicated military-technical document on 
disengagement of troops and weapons," which contains "quite 
definite, if not ideal, provisions" about U.N. supervision over 
its implementation, Churkin emphasised. 
  Commenting on the content of the agreement, the Russian 
diplomat said it comprised not only the text of the document 
itself, but also 35 detailed maps signed by the warring 
factions. "There should not be any room for uncertainty as to 
what the sides should do to fulfil the agreements," Churkin 
pointed out. 
  Therefore, Churkin stressed, he is inclined to believe that 
the agreement will be observed. However, he did not rule out 
the possiblity of "certain roughness," especially at the most 
difficult initial stage of troop disengagement."

<F P=106> [Yelena Shchedrunova report under the "Balkans" rubric: "A </F>
New Russian Success in the Former Yugoslavia. Cease-fire 
Agreement Signed Between Croatia and Serbian Krajina"] 
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] Vitaliy Churkin, Russia's 
special representative in the talks on the former Yugoslavia, 
who returned to Moscow on the evening of 30 March, has told your 
SEGODNYA correspondent that the document signed gives all 
reasons to state that the threat of a military conflict between 
the Serbs and the Croats has been brought to nil. [passage 
omitted] 
  The next step in the efforts to settle the conflict between 
Croatia and Serbian Krajina will be talks on the resumption of 
economic ties and communications between regions that are 
scheduled to be held in two weeks or so, probably at the same 
location. Discussion of the most crucial matter -- Serbian 
Krajina's status -- was postponed indefinitely. Vitaliy Churkin 
believes that the process of decisionmaking on the subject 
should not be rushed; he pointed out, however, that both Russia 
and the West adhere to the principle of Croatia's territorial 
integrity. But he is "certain that solutions are possible that 
would not be detrimental to either side." [passage omitted] 
  Vitaliy Churkin emphasized that the United States, the EC, 
and the participants in the international conference have had a 
significant role to play in achieving this result. Although the 
meeting was sponsored and organized by Russia, which later 
invited other participants to join it, only the thorough 
coordination in the actions of all mediators made it possible to 
make sure that the agreement was signed. Vitaliy Churkin 
pointed out in particular that U.S. and Russian diplomats, who 
had previously made repeated statements about the coincidence of 
their views on the Balkan conflict, demonstrated this 
coincidence in practice for the first time. The experience of 
the Zagreb talks, he stressed, may also be used for Bosnia and 
Herzegovina.

recorded remarks by Vitaliy Churkin, Russian first deputy 
foreign minister, in Zagreb on 30 March; from the "Vesti" 
newscast] 
  [Excerpts] Talks between representatives of Croatia and 
Serb Krajina went on for 17 hours at the Russian Embassy in 
Zagreb. [passage omitted] 
  [Safiulin] Also, today in an interview, Vitaliy Churkin said 
the agreement was a specific success of Russian diplomacy. 
  [Churkin] We organized these talks both politically and 
technically. We brought the parties together. We involved U.S. 
efforts in this. Representatives of the European Union and the 
United Nations organization were working together with us. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Safiulin] Churkin also said: 
  [Churkin] For the first time, if not legally, then 
politically, the guarantors of the agreement are Russia, the 
United States, and the European Union. 
  [Safiulin] To a question on who played the main role in the 
signing of the agreement, the deputy minister replied: 
  [Churkin] There were neither competition nor grudges between 
us. We worked very harmoniously together. No agreement would 
have been reached if we had not acted from harmonious, joint 
political and negotiating positions. 
  [Safiulin] The next meeting between the Serbs and Croats 
with 
the aim of discussing economic matters is planned in two weeks' 
time, probably at the Russian Embassy again.

<F P=106> [Maksim Yusin report: "Serbs and Croats Agree on Cease-Fire </F>
With Moscow Mediating"] 
  [Text] On the morning of 30 March, after grueling 18-hour 
talks in the Russian Embassy in Zagreb, the Croatian Government 
and representatives of the self-proclaimed "Republic of Serbian 
Krajina" signed a cease-fire agreement. 
  Russian diplomacy celebrates a new success. Without Moscow's 
mediation the truce between the Serbs and Croats would probably 
not have happened. The efforts over many months of Vitaliy 
Churkin, President Yeltsin's special representative, have 
finally borne fruit. "The agreement signed today is the first 
step toward settling the conflict and normalizing Serb-Croat 
relations," Churkin told journalists on the talks' completion. 
  The truce comes into effect at 0900 hours on 5 April. By 
this time mortars and antiaircraft guns must be withdrawn 10 km 
from the demarcation line, and tanks and heavy artillery must be 
withdrawn 20 km. Before 8 April all Serb and Croat formations 
will have retreated 1 km into their own territory, giving up 
advanced positions to UN "Blue Helmets" and EU [European Union] 
observers. 
  By signing the cease-fire agreement the Serbs and Croats 
have 
closed the age on a bloody period in their history when they 
were in a state of war for two and a half years. As a result of 
the hostilities around 10,000 people died and one-fourth of 
Croatian territory is occupied by Serbs and Yugoslav Army 
subunits. 
  The cease-fire treaty will undoubtedly make further talks 
between Zagreb and "Serbian Krajina" easier, although by all 
accounts they will again require Russian mediation. The main 
task is to define the status of Serb areas in Croatia. As of 
today the sides' positions are diametrically opposed. The 
Krajina authorities are demanding separation from Croatia, but 
Zagreb is not even entertaining this notion, offering Serbs 
broad autonomy but as part of a united state. 
  The Serbian leaders' separatist sentiments are supported by 
few people in the world. The vast majority of UN members 
recognized Croatia with its original borders. The United 
States, EU, and Russia with certain reservations are inclined 
toward the settlement option proposed by Zagreb. In this 
situation much will depend on Belgrade: If Serbian President 
Slobodan Milosevic persuades his fellow countrymen in Croatia to 
compromise and not to seek separation at any price the conflict 
could be finally settled, and Yugoslavia will obtain additional 
grounds for demanding the lifting of sanctions. 
  For their part the Croatian authorities, who are interested 
as never before in solving the problem as quickly as possible, 
could agree to certain concessions. The truce with the Serbs 
will enable the country's economy to switch back to a peacetime 
track, will ensure the return of hundreds of thousands of 
refugees to their homes, and will decrease social tension. 
Croatia, which before the war had the fourth-highest number of 
foreign tourists in Europe, will get the chance to redevelop its 
tourist business, which, according to expert estimates, could 
bring the country up to $5 billion a year.

  [Text] RIA-Novosti agency reports that a Russian diplomat, 
Igor Makeyev, has disappeared in mysterious circumstances in 
Thailand. He has allegedly disappeared with a portable computer 
containing secret information. The Thai police believe Makeyev 
has either secretly left the country or is no longer alive. The 
Russian Embassy has so far refrained from commenting, but it has 
noted that any information in the possession of an employee of 
the consular department could only be concerned with that 
department.

March 22. 
  Karasin said that the Russian Embassy and Thai officials 
have 
taken the necessary steps to investigate into the circumstances 
of the diplomat's disappearance and organise a search for him. 
However, "the search has been unsuccessful so far," he added. 
  "The news about Makeyev's disappearance was a blow to his 
next of kin. They were shocked by it," Karasin said. 
  "The feeling of sympathy and humaneness prompt us to take 
urgent and more active steps to find the missing diplomat," he 
said.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Russian Prime Minister Viktor </F>
Chernomyrdin by correspondent Gabor Izbeki, on the eve of his 
visit to Budapest, in Moscow on 30 March; Chernomyrdin speaks in 
Russian with superimposed Hungarian translation -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Izbeki] The Russian prime minister is basically 
satisfied with the development of Hungarian-Russian economic 
ties and trusts that his visit will further boost them. [passage 
omitted] Viktor Chernomyrdin sees no serious problem in the 
significant difference in value between the Russian and 
Hungarian deliveries. 
  [Chernomyrdin] It has various reasons. I would not hold 
either side responsible for that, and I would certainly not 
blame either of them. The transitional, semi-market nature of 
the Russian economy has of course a considerable influence on 
this. [passage omitted] The creation of the legal basis of a 
market economy is now taking place in Russia. The bilateral 
agreements to be signed in Budapest, for instance, will 
partially serve this purpose. Economic processes cannot be 
changed all at once. However, I am certain that the imbalance 
in Hungarian-Russian exports and imports will gradually decrease. 
  [Izbeki] The issue of debts inherited from the Soviet era is 
also a subject matter in which our countries are ahead of 
everyone else. The Russian Government is determined to settle 
this debate once and for all and as soon as possible. Viktor 
Chernomyrdin answered my question regarding this. He welcomes 
the Hungarian proposal that part of the still outstanding debt 
of about $800 million would be invested here in Russia. The 
details, of course, are yet to be discussed, but in theory, it 
is supported. Thus, I see no problem regarding this. The debt 
issue can be resolved, he added. Russia is a reliable partner 
in energy deliveries as well, he said. 
  [Chernomyrdin] We undertake responsibility for what we have 
promised and agreed on. [passage omitted] As far as our 
neighbors are concerned, in my view, Ukraine has to handle this 
matter in a civilized manner, as it is customary in the world. 
The diversion or tapping of deliveries, or similar non-business 
methods are unacceptable. Russia and the recipient European 
countries expect nothing less from the transit countries than to 
fulfill their business obligations. 
  [Izbeki] Viktor Chernomyrdin, who has been Russia's prime 
minister since December 1992, is of the view that the Russian 
reforms, the economy's transformation, could not have moved 
forward any faster, more successfully and less painfully than 
they did. [passage omitted] 
  Concerning the power struggle within the Russian top 
leadership, Viktor Chernomyrdin denied the allegation that he 
was striving for greater power than what he currently has.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondents Sergey Zhirnikhin, Ivan </F>
Ivanov] 
  [Text] Budapest March 31 TASS -- Russia views Hungary as a 
promising economic and trading partner in Central and Eastern 
Europe. The widening of commercial and economic ties that has 
begun now should become a stable tendency. Russian Prime 
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said this at Hungarian-Russian 
intergovernmental negotiations in Budapest on Thursday. The 
negotiations of the delegations in an enlarged composition was 
preceded by a one-on-one conversation between the Russian prime 
minister and his Hungarian counterpart Peter Boross. 
  Special attention was given at the talks to the development 
of cooperation between the two countries under the principles of 
genuine equality, trust and respect for each other's interests, 
ITAR-TASS learned from sources in the Russian delegation. 
Chernomyrdin and Boross informed each other of the political and 
economic situation in their countries and the pace of 
transformations and reforms. 
  During the exchange of opinions of the development of 
bilateral relations and the implementation of arrangements 
reached at the summit level during Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin's visit to Hungary in 1992, the participants in the 
talks pointed to the need to step up joint efforts, to raise the 
level of commercial and economic cooperation in accordance with 
the potential of the two countries, to restore on new market 
principles traditional economic ties and to set in motion new 
financial and economic mechanisms. 
  The Russian side raised the question of the expediency of 
concluding a free trade agreement between the two countries, as 
well as encouragement of mutual investment, establishment of 
cooperation introducion and of direct ties between enterprises 
and regions. 
  Topical international problems, including the situation in 
Europe and processes of European integration, have also been 
discussed at the talks. Positively assessing the level of 
interaction between Russia and Hungary in foreign policy, 
Chernomyrdin said that the ensurance of stability and 
consolidation of security in Europe should become the main 
tendency of that interaction. 
  Russia proposes the creation of an integrated European 
security system on a basis of cooperation and equality regarding 
the consolidation of cardinal political role of CSCE, the 
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, as a top 
priority. 
  During the negotiations the Russian side noted that NATO's 
initiative "Partnership for Peace" had become an important step 
in shaping universal European structure of military-political 
cooperation. 
  A meeting of the Hungarian-Russian intergovernmetnal 
commission of commercial and economic cooperation was held in 
the parliament building on the same day. Bela Kadar, Hungarian 
minister of international economic relations, said in a brief 
remark after the meeting that ways to pay off Russia's trading 
debt to Hungary loomed large in the debate. An arrangement on 
problems discussed has in principle been reached.

  [Text] Economic cooperation has dominated the talks between 
Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy and Russian Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin. The meeting between the delegation of the Polish 
parliament and the head of the Russian government was decided at 
the last moment. 
  [Correspondent Wojciech Nomejko] The expected half-hour talk 
was extended to over an hour. Both interlocuters considered 
ways to increase Polish investment in the Russian market. 
  [Begin Oleksy recording] I am very satisfied with the 
expressions of readiness that Prime Minister Chernomyrdin 
declared regarding close contacts. We told each other: Poland 
can, at the last resort, manage without Russia, Russia without 
Poland on the whole certainly so, but why? [end recording] 
  [Nomejko] Prime Minister Chernomyrdin declared a readiness 
for an economic rapprochement between Russia and Poland. 
Speaker Jozef Oleksy expressed the hope that after the talk 
today and after the visit of the Russian prime minister to 
Poland, which will take place in May, decisions will be made to 
stimulate the economy in Poland. There is a chance that the 
Polish food processing and construction industries will regain 
their former positions in the Russian market. They also 
discussed issues of mutual indebtedness and of the conctruction 
of gas pipelines. 
  To be sure, the visit of the Polish parliamentarians was to 
have been solely an informational one, but the meetings with the 
representatives of the highest authorities of the Russian 
Federation, the prime minister, and probably the president, mark 
out the political character of the visit.

  [Text] Speaking at the Russian State Duma today, Polish 
Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy said that different approaches to the 
NATO Partnership for Peace [PFP] program should not lead to 
disagreements between the two countries. 
  In Oleksy's words, Poland is against any security concept 
that does not take account of Russia's interests. A policy of 
isolating Moscow is irrational. At the same time the Sejm 
speaker emphasized that Poland wants NATO membership, in which 
it sees a basis for strategic security. Duma Defense Committee 
Chairman Sergey Yushenkov in his turn thinks that the NATO PFP 
plan pushes the European CSCE security system into the 
background. In theory, Yushenkov noted, all European countries 
should have equal rights in building collective security.

  [Text] Moscow March 31 TASS -- "We finally come to realise 
that separation of powers does not mean their confrontation," 
Ivan Rybkin, speaker of the State Duma, said on Thursday during 
a meeting with marshal of the Polish Sejm, Jozef Oleksy. Rybkin 
said that the drafting of a document on national concord is an 
example of practical interaction of branches of power. 
  The speaker of the Lower House of the Federal Assembly 
believes it would be naive to think that the present Duma will 
be able to provide full legislative backing for transformations 
in Russia. Nevertheless, it is possible to lay down the 
groundwork for fruitful operation of the next composition of the 
Lower House, he said. 
  Rybkin said some Russian MPs suggest that the term of the 
present State Duma be extended for another four years. The 
speaker of the Lower House said this can become possible only if 
the process of national reconciliation develops successfully. 
There is, above all, interaction between the president and the 
parliament. "Then the people would be able to express their 
will, which would be represented in a constitutional extention 
of the Duma's powers," Rybkin said. 
  Dwelling on European interparliamentary ties, the speaker of 
the State Duma expressed perplexity with the fact that Russia 
has not yet been admitted into the Council of Europe as a 
full-fledged member. 
  In his turn, the marshal of the Polish Sejm expressed 
satisfaction with successfully developing cooperation between 
Russian and Polish MPs and declared for its further widening. 
Jozef Oleksy heads a delegation of members of the Polish Sejm 
that arrived in Moscow at the invitation of the Duma. The 
delegation includes representatives of the main factions of the 
Polish Sejm.

  [Text] The leasing agreement on the Baykonur space center 
that Moscow and Alma-Ata [Almaty] recently signed may be 
ratified in the next four weeks and take effect thereafter, a 
senior official of the Russian Space Agency [RSA] told Interfax. 
  He said the deal would enable Russia to go ahead with its 
space programs for the next 20 years. It will also be able to 
comply with its obligations to maintain and develop the facility. 
  More importantly, he said, the two sides had agreed that the 
facility should include all of its infrastructures, the adjacent 
town of Leninsk and related property. The official said that 
General Aleksey Shumilin would remain in charge of the space 
center. 
  On Russia's payment of an annual $115 Mn to Kazakhstan, he 
said this would be done in the form of compensation as part of 
account settling between Moscow and Alma-Ata. The deal brings 
an end to the dispute over the future of a launch pad for Zenit 
boosters. Earlier, Ukraine and Kazakhstan were planning to sign 
a separate deal because of Kiev's claim to the facility. 
  However, Moscow challenges this, saying the Zenit booster is 
80 percent Russian contribution, the RSA official said. All the 
same, he said, it will make no sense to turn down cooperation 
with Ukraine in the development of that environmentally safe and 
advanced booster. 
  "We will continue to work together with Ukraine as before, 
he 
said, but Russia is not going to cede the booster to Kiev." 
  "Russia will cooperate with Ukraine and other CIS states 
within the framework of the CIS space program," he said.

<F P=106> [ITAR-TASS report followed by Yuriy Konorov commentary: </F>
"Baykonur's Future Decided" -- first three paragraphs are 
ITAR-TASS report] 
  [Text] The changes made to the agreement between Russia 
and Kazakhstan on the status of and conditions for using the 
Baykonur cosmodrome and the city of Leninsk in literally the 
last few hours before the ceremony at which the two countries' 
presidents signed it cannot be described as significant. 
Moreover, the document preserves the points on which the 
Russian side in particular was insisting: a lease period of 20 
years with a further 10-year extension, and agreement for 
Russian citizens -- servicemen of the Russian Federation 
Military Space Forces -- to stay at the cosmodrome and service 
it. The only change is that the rent payments are $115 million 
a year [as published]. 
  The problems over Baykonur's status in fact started last 
summer, when Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev put forward 
the idea of turning Baykonur into an international spaceport. 
  Both sides win from the Baykonur lease arrangement. 
Kazakhstan cannot maintain Baykonur on its own: It has neither 
the money nor the specialists for this at present. And Russia 
would be deprived of a base for launching heavy carrier rockets 
over the next few years while it establishes a new cosmodrome. 
  [Konorov] Now that all the worries are over, we can look 
back and recall the circumstances under which the negotiations 
took place. The politicians, economists, and legal specialists 
spent a long time preparing for them; and, to give them credit, 
they prepared well: Every figure was checked down to the last 
cent (given that the cost of the rent is in dollars -- 115 
million a month) [as published]. It emerges that the Russian 
specialists, basing themselves on international experience and 
Kazakhstan legislation, insisted that the real cost of the lease 
should be $80 million. The Kazakh side took no account of these 
arguments. The essence of their claims boiled down to the 
statement: "But we need 150 million." The negotiations were 
going badly until a "judgment of Solomon" was found. The two 
sums would be added together and then divided in half. The 
so-called "arithmetic mean" came to 115 million. 
  In addition, an understanding was reached that a significant 
proportion of this sum would be paid "by barter" in the form of 
all kinds of services. 
  How firm is this understanding? Like Russia, Kazakhstan now 
has certain obligations to foreign partners to carry out 
international space programs. The influence of international 
public opinion and the prestige of space powers are arguments of 
considerable weight in this protracted dispute.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Aleksandr Krylovich] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 30 Mar -- Problems relating to the 
development of Russian-Kyrgyz relations and the peacekeeping 
activities of the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly in Nagornyy 
Karabakh were considered today at a meeting between Russian 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and Medetkan Sherimkulov, 
chairman of the Kyrgyz Supreme Council and head of the CIS 
Interparliamentary Assembly peacemaking group on Nagornyy 
Karabakh. 
  Answering a question from the ITAR-TASS correspondent, the 
head of Kyrgyzstan's parliament stated that the 
Interparliamentary peacemaking group is now engaged in preparing 
for a meeting of Azerbaijani, Armenian, and Nagornyy Karabakh 
parliamentarians in Bishkek. He expressed the hope that success 
will be achieved in organizing a frank exchange of opinions 
between the heads of the parliaments of these states. According 
to M. Sherimkulov he will tomorrow be flying to Baku and Yerevan 
and afterwards will visit Stepanakert, where specific dates will 
be agreed for the meeting. 
  "I should like to hope that the end result of our activities 
will be peace. People are tired of war and of the fact that the 
number of refugees is growing. Not one state gains from this," 
M. Sherimkulov emphasized. "If we managed to give help and 
support in bringing the positions of the warring sides closer, 
we should consider our mission useful," he said. 
  As a high-ranking Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman noted 
in 
a conversation with journalists, the Russian foreign policy 
department fully supports the intention and desire of the CIS 
Interparliamentary Assembly peacemaking group to take what part 
it can in the process of settling the conflict in Nagornyy 
Karabakh. According to him the Russian Foreign Ministry "is 
working in close contact and is ready to provide expert 
assistance in the work that this group is performing." The 
Russian Foreign Ministry considers that this group "can play a 
special role, since parliamentarians can promote the 
establishment of an appropriate atmosphere in which it would be 
possible to adopt the agreement on which the executive 
structures are now working." 
  According to the high-ranking Russian diplomat the main aim 
now is "to bring the sides together and to create an appropriate 
atmosphere for the adoption of an agreement on halting the 
conflict in Nagornyy Karabakh." This agreement has been worked 
out in principle. Each side involved in the conflict has its 
own approaches and probably much more effort will have to be 
made for it to be signed, the Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman 
stressed.

<F P=106> [Report by Tamara Smirnova: "Shock-Free, But Painful. The </F>
Duma Agonizes Over the Budget"] 
  [Text] The draft federal budget for 1994 did not reach the 
State Duma until the end of March. The budget message will 
first be studied in committees and commissions, after which the 
Duma committees will present their findings. Parliamentary 
hearings will take place 5 and 7 April, and on 13 April there 
will be a discussion on the first reading at a plenary session. 
The work of agreeing the budget will last for a further month 
to six weeks. 
  How is the budget structured in general? Revenue is set at a 
level of 120 trillion rubles [R], expenditure at R182 trillion, 
with a planned deficit of 62 trillion. 
  The Russian Finance Ministry's concept is formulated thus: 
No shock, but a tough credit and monetary policy and realistic 
collection of revenue. The revenue side of the budget will 
increase through a growth in the volume of indirect taxes, 
value-added tax, and excise duties. As for the expenditure 
side, there is nothing to rejoice about. Finance has been cut 
for practically everything. The biggest expenditure items of 
the budget are: defense -- R37 trillion; targeted support for 
sectors -- R33 trillion; aid to authorities at other levels -- 
18 trillion; social and cultural programs -- 12.5 trillion. The 
Finance Ministry has maintained the level of expenditure on 
social needs at the 1993 volume. 
  It is planned to cover the expenditure items by means of 
Central Bank credits, transactions involving securities, and 
foreign sources, but mostly by means of tougher financial 
discipline, first and foremost taxation discipline. 
  It is predicted that inflation will fall to 15 and then 10 
percent per month. Consumer prices will increase fivefold, and 
the decline in production will be 12 percent. These figures are 
contained in a forecast of Russia's socioeconomic development 
for 1994 which was discussed at a session of the Russian 
Federation Government Presidium. The document has been sent to 
parliament as an appendix to the draft federal budget.

<F P=106> [Interview with Galina Karelova, chairman of Russian </F>
Federation Council Social Policy Committee, by Sergey Karkhanin; 
place, date not given: "Integral of Well-Being. Deputies and 
Ministers Plan Social Policy for This Year"] 
  [Text] This term has been encountered so often in the 
political rhetoric of recent months that it has come to resemble 
an incantation, but we should not be surprised. Given that, 
according to sociological polls, "Reforms for the sake of 
people, not at the expense of people" is now one of the most 
popular slogans, the social dimension of every step taken by the 
government is becoming particularly significant. Deputies from 
the Federation Council Social Policy Committee together with 
Vice Premier Yuriy Yarov and the leaders of a number of 
ministries and departments recently discussed the draft basic 
guidelines for social policy in 1994. Committee Chairman Galina 
Karelova describes the details in conversation with a 
ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI correspondent. 
  [Karkhanin] Galina Nikolayevna, it is no secret that there 
were many such drafts in earlier years too, but they usually 
remained only on paper. Does the present document contain any 
fundamental differences from its predecessors capable of 
providing hope that it will be implemented nevertheless? 
  [Karelova] The similar drafts that emerged in past years 
represented a mechanical summation of uncoordinated "sectoral" 
programs, which were very difficult to harmonize. But the 
present draft is precisely a package of measures. An attempt 
has been made to create an integrated document possessing 
integrity and a single linchpin. Obviously, the attempt has not 
been a total success, but Yuriy Fedorovich Yarov and his "team" 
have done a very great deal of work. 
  As we completed the preparation of our legislative program, 
we deputies needed to correlate our approaches with the 
government's and to agree on timetables so that the draft laws 
on social policy that Russians are so keenly awaiting could be 
more swiftly approved by the Federal Assembly. Moreover, we and 
the representatives of the government, endeavored to coordinate 
our actions connected with the budget. It is clear that the 
fine words about the priority of the social sphere pronounced 
from lofty rostrums are no impediment to continued funding of 
this sphere on the basis of the notorious leftover principle.... 
  Our deputies particularly noted a fundamentally important 
point: A system of state social guarantees expressing in 
figures what the minimum needs of each Russian citizen cost has 
still not been formulated. I believe that this system has not 
been formulated precisely because at present, it is impossible 
to provide the money for it, since the state has almost none. 
But then, in my view, people should be openly and directly told 
what percentage of their needs we can provide for. 
  Until recently, I worked in Sverdlovsk Oblast, and I know 
that the regions are keenly awaiting a law on the minimum 
consumer budget, which will make it possible at long last to 
determine who should be categorized as belonging to low-income 
groups. At present, anybody can categorize themselves as such. 
There is no officially approved criterion.... Incidentally, it 
will also be useful for enterprises to have a guideline as to 
what minimum wage they should provide for their workers. 
  [Karkhanin] So far we have been talking about approaches, 
about the general nature of the draft basic guidelines. Could 
you cite a few sections to show what it is like? 
  [Karelova] One of the most important sections is the one 
about policy in the sphere of labor relations. New forms of 
ownership have emerged, and hired workers often feel that they 
have no rights now that the code of labor laws effectively does 
not operate. So the document touches on questions of 
remuneration and insurance. The government has prepared a 
number of draft laws about the rights of employers and hired 
workers. Moreover, a federal employment program has been 
submitted to us -- this touches not only on the problem of the 
unemployed, but also on the problems of support for small and 
medium enterprises via the territories. Tremendous preparatory 
work has been carried out here, and the regions in primary need 
of assistance have been identified. 
  [Karkhanin] You mentioned the government's lawmaking 
activity, although this role used usually to belong to 
parliament.... 
  [Karelova, interrupting] We are not abandoning lawmaking, of 
course, but in my view the government's activeness is only to be 
welcomed. I already have in hand around 20 draft laws relating 
to labor relations, employment, migration, and the environment 
prepared by the government. I think it is important for 
normative documents, especially those relating to problems of 
social protection, to be prepared by those who will have to 
fulfill them. Having said that, there is a need for control. 
You cannot allow standards to be artificially lowered in the 
interests of irresponsibility. 
  I know that many organizations, both state and public, took 
part in preparing these draft laws, and we are prepared to 
accept the documents that were discussed as the basis for work. 
  Separate chapters in the draft basic guidelines relate to 
migration policy and social support for those who are unable to 
work and low-income groups. Incidentally, our parliamentary 
committee will soon receive from the government a blueprint for 
pension reform, and the draft law on nonstate pension funds will 
clearly be discussed by Federal Assembly deputies as early as 
April. 
  Furthermore, under the present system there are 14 types of 
benefits for families with children, and there is a confusing 
situation which people find it hard to understand. So the 
government is proposing to introduce a clear unified system that 
everyone can understand. We support this stance. There is also 
the idea of restructuring the obsolete and cumbersome system for 
collecting alimony, which has meant unnecessary and often futile 
hassle both for the militia and mothers. Together with the 
State Duma deputies' commissions, we intend to work on a plan 
whereby the rights of the child will be protected by the state, 
to ensure that alimony is paid from the state budget regardless 
of whether the errant father who left the family without a 
livelihood has been found. 
  [Karkhanin] Nevertheless, the most burning question for most 
people today is the income of family budgets. If it proves 
possible to implement the draft basic guidelines, how will this 
affect people's lives? 
  [Karelova] The most important point is that their social 
rights, including with regard to remuneration, will be better 
protected. We will shortly begin to examine a new labor code 
which specially notes that delays in paying wages are 
impermissible. Various forms of payment were mentioned in the 
debates that our deputies had with Labor Minister Gennadiy 
Melikyan. If there is no cash, credit cards or promissory notes 
can be used. The banks have a whole system for noncash 
payments, and better use must be made of these. 
  Unemployed people are appearing and the problem of 
employment 
is emerging, and it by no means always has to be solved by 
finding someone a new job. For instance, back home in 
Sverdlovsk Oblast the "Uralobuv" [footwear] enterprise closed, 
although its products were cheap and convenient and were snapped 
up for children and pensioners. So for socially important 
enterprises that find themselves in difficult economic 
conditions, there must be material support from an employment 
fund in order to preserve these jobs. 
  For this reason, the federal employment program includes a 
number of sections aimed at supporting not only those who have 
already lost their jobs but also those who are employed in small 
and medium enterprises, especially those producing consumer 
goods. These mainly employ women and young people -- the social 
groups who make up around 70 percent of the unemployed. 
  According to the draft state budget, it is planned to 
appropriate around 12 trillion rubles [R] for social purposes -- 
this is approximately the same level as last year. We believe 
that this sum must be increased -- I am talking about the 
regions that suffered as a result of the Chernobyl disaster and 
the environmental disaster zones with equivalent status -- 
Kamensk-Uralskiy, Chelyabinsk and Sverdlovsk Oblasts, Altay 
Kray. Even if expenditure is kept at last year's level, the sum 
of R3.8 trillion is needed, but only half of that sum has been 
agreed, so we are asking the government to fund the 
aforementioned regions at least at the level of 1993. 
  Clearly, increasing expenditure means increasing the budget 
deficit, but our committees and the Duma committees still intend 
to make an in-depth examination of a number of issues and 
identify where savings can be made. But I think it would be 
immoral to making savings out of the calamity that befell the 
victims of Chernobyl. 
  [Karkhanin] Incidentally, how did the debates with 
government representatives go at the enlarged sitting of your 
committee? What was the atmosphere like? 
  [Karelova] Each minister spoke about his sector's problems. 
This is the information we badly need. We received all the 
necessary documents. The debate was very amicable, and we 
remain inclined toward businesslike cooperation. 
  Obviously, the draft basic guidelines along with our 
comments 
will be approved in the government in the very near future. Our 
comments mostly boiled down to saying that insufficient account 
was taken of the regional aspect. We Federation Council 
deputies have worked in the regions and we know that the state 
gets 80 percent of its funds from the provinces. So why does 
Moscow dictate to the local authorities how to spend them? This 
does not allow the oblasts to solve social questions in an 
effective manner. Although the local authorities must become a 
real player in social policy. 
  Moreover, the draft has virtually not been agreed with 
nonstate players in social policy. They too should have been 
made into allies. One final point -- the programs on most 
topics are integrated only in terms of their elements. However, 
this is natural: Ministries have always been isolated from each 
other. 
  So it is one of our main tasks to unite. Our deputies' 
committee is already setting up an interdepartmental expert 
commission that will prepare draft normative acts. So we are 
already taking the first steps.

  [Text] Moscow 30 Mar, TASS -- The lower house of the 
Russian Parliament is making efforts to reach stabilisation in 
society which meets the support of Moslem believers in Russia, 
said the speaker of the State Duma, Ivan Rybkin, at a meeting 
with Moslem leaders of religious denominations of the Russian 
Federation on Tuesday. 
  The meeting was attended by the chairman of the Central 
Department of Moslem Communities of Russia, the European Part of 
the CIS and the Baltic States (MDEC), Talgat 
Tadzhuddin-Sheikh-ul-Islam, members of the MDEC presidium, Ravil 
Gainutdin and Dzhafar Bikmayev. 
  During the talks the sides discussed problems of cooperation 
between the state and Moslem organisations in reaching civic 
peace and accord in Russia, problems of imposing fundamentalism 
and extremism on Russian Moslems by foreign Islamic 
organisations and the assistance rendered by the state in the 
restoration and construction of mosques and education of priests. 
  During the talks religious leaders raised the question of 
setting up a special state department for religious affairs. 
They also touched upon unfair distribution of air time on 
television, which prefers foreign missionaries, infringing on 
the rights of traditional religious confessions in Russia.

<F P=106> [Report by Anatoliy Yershov under the "Events and Comments" </F>
rubric: "Nizhniy Novgorod Mayor Falsifies Election Results"] 
  [Text] Nizhniy Novgorod -- A. Nekrasov, chairman of the 
Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast Electoral Commission, has made a 
sensational statement: In District No. 3, where, among other 
candidates, Nizhniy Novgorod Mayor D. Bednyakov was running for 
the Oblast Legislative Assembly, facts concerning the 
falsification of the election results have been uncovered. 
Furthermore, this was done with the participation of D. 
Bednyakov and other officials. 
  Staffers of the Avtozavodskiy Rayon Prosecutor's Office are 
now investigating this unusual case. District No. 3 for the 
elections to the Oblast Legislative Assembly has 30 electoral 
precincts; 65,000 voters live here. On the day of the 
elections, 27 March, 17,611 ballot papers were given out; the 
voter turnout was over 27 percent. But, as we know, the 
definitive results of the ballot are determined by the number of 
ballot papers which are deemed to be valid. 
  Unfortunately, there was a "shortfall" here, and this 
district clearly did not reach the necessary 25 percent. 
  "In all, for various reasons, 1,655 ballot papers were 
deemed 
invalid, that is, almost one-tenth of the number issued," A. 
Nekrasov said. "Incidentally, we had obtained all this 
information by computer communication from the district 
electoral commission the day before, and that is why the 
elections here were deemed invalid." 
  There followed actions which can not be called anything 
except the most gross violation of legality, A. Nekrasov went 
on. Under pressure from D. Bednyakov and with the active 
participation of G. Sokolnikov, head of the Avtozavodskiy Rayon 
Administration, his deputy, Zh. Bolshakova, and Ye. 
Boyarintseva, head of the organizational section at the rayon 
administration, all the ballot papers were unpacked. Of course, 
the officials, trying to please their chief at any cost, were 
primarily interested in the ballot papers which were deemed 
invalid the day before. They were all laid out in piles again, 
and essentially a recount took place. At the same time the 
previous protocols of the precinct electoral commissions were 
destroyed, and this documentation was essentially filled out 
anew. The number of valid ballot papers was raised first to 
25.1 percent as a result of the aforementioned manipulations, 
and later even higher -- to 25.2 percent. It must be noted 
that the original count of the electorate's votes was conducted 
in the presence of persons empowered to act for the candidates 
and numerous observers, and there were no complaints or censure 
on their part. In short, this is a matter of the most flagrant 
arbitrariness by officials and an attempt by D. Bednyakov, 
leader of the city authorities, to achieve the desired results 
during the elections.

  [Text] President Boris Yeltsin dismissed acting 
administration head of Nizhny Novgorod Dmitriy Bednyakov for 
"flagrant misconduct." 
  The regional Governor Boris Nemtsov appointed his deputy 
Ivan 
Sklyarov to act as Nizhnyy Novgorod mayor. 
  Officials in the regional administration explained to 
Interfax that the misconduct lay in Bednyakov's refusal to carry 
out Governor Nemtsov's order to cancel the referendum on the 
city charter draft. The refusal destabilized the city and the 
region, discredited the authorities and made their joint work 
impossible. 
  Nemtsov said at a news conference Wednesday that "continuous 
rallies, picketing, ballot rigging and a large-scale 
anti-Semitic campaign could not be described as stability."

<F P=106> [Article by Tatyana Roshchina: "Suits, Applications From </F>
`Formers' Beset Vladivostok Procuracy and Courts"] 
  [Text] According to a report from the city administration 
press center, a commission for reorganizing the management 
structure under the leadership of acting deputy chief of the 
city, V. Terekhov, has been formed in the Gray House. 
Information about the course of its work has been promised 
within the next few days when the document on "reorganization" 
is finally ready. 
  Well, the "victims" have a viewpoint regarding this as well. 
In the words of V. Gilgenberg, he has not seen the decree for 
his ouster. After moving out of the city manager's office, from 
which he managed to remove his personal belongings and money, 
Vladimir Aleksandrovich filed charges in the Frunzenskiy Rayon 
court against the deputy chief of the kray, I. Lebedinets, 
regarding his discharge. 
  As it turned out, I. Lebedinets had signed no such decree, 
and so the charges were filed against the wrong person. They 
were transferred to the Leninskiy Rayon people's court, which 
will obviously submit an inquiry to the city administration 
which is located on the territory of this rayon. It is assumed 
that the corresponding directive was issued by acting city chief 
K. Tolstochein, and the question of the legality of firing 
Gilgenberg should be addressed to him. 
  Further, V. Gilgenberg filed charges against the deputy 
chief 
of the kray, I. Lebedinets, in the Frunzenskiy Rayon court 
concerning the illegality, in the plaintiff's opinion, of 
Lebedinets' decree appointing K. Tolstochein as acting chief of 
the city, since effective 14 March, on instructions from V. 
Cherepkov, who had gone into the hospital, his duties were to be 
performed by V. Gilgenberg. 
  In addition, Gilgenberg sent three applications to the city 
procurator and also the kray procurator. The latter was 
addressed also to the president, the chairmen of the Duma and 
the Council of the Federation of the Russian Federation, and the 
procurator general. They also discuss the illegality of the 
ouster of both Gilgenberg himself and the other workers of the 
mayor's office. Moreover, the former manager insisted on having 
I. Lebedinets removed from his position and bringing criminal 
charges against him for statements that violate, in the 
plaintiff's opinion, the principles of "racial and ethnic equal 
rights." 
  The chief of the city administration for public education, 
N. 
Beletskiy, reported that on 22 March two workers of the mayor's 
office accompanied by a militia detail headed by the deputy 
chief of the Leninskiy Rayon internal affairs department, S. 
Goncharuk, had tried twice to kick him out of his office and no 
documents were presented either for his dismissal or for staff 
cutbacks. In Beletskiy's words, administration workers 
"defended" him. 
  This incident was the occasion for the appeal from N. 
Beletskiy to the city procurator, representatives of the State 
Duma, and the investigator of the Procuracy General of the 
Russian Federation. 
  The former chairman of the city committee for administration 
of property, P. Bezukladnikov, was "luckier": He was given, in 
his words, an order firing him (No. 356 of 17 March), signed by 
K. Tolstochein. Effective 18 March the former chief, A. 
Sazhnov, was returned to the office. P. Bezukladnikov filed 
charges with the Leninskiy Rayon people's court against acting 
chief of the city administration K. Tolstochein concerning the 
illegality of his dismissal.

<F P=106> [Report by Vasiliy Shpachkov: "What Color Will Bryansk Duma </F>
Be?"] 
  [Text] Bryansk -- Elections have been held to the Bryansk 
Oblast Duma in an unstable sociopolitical situation. The 
oblast, in turmoil at the constant change of leaders (this is no 
joke, last year they changed governors three times!), has again 
been sent into a spin. In the local mass media and at meetings 
with the voters deputies of the Russian Federal Assembly -- Petr 
Shirshov, former chairman of Bryansk City Soviet, Oleg 
Shenkarev, leader of the Russian Federation Communist Party 
oblast organization, and other opponents of the course of 
reforms -- have been trying to mobilize public opinion in favor 
of reinstating the communist Yuriy Lodkin, previously ousted by 
the president, to the post of governor. 
  The oblast duma cannot expand indefinitely. It has 27 seats. 
One-hundred-and-fifty-two deputies want to occupy them. 
Furthermore, it is mainly economic managers and leaders of 
production who wanted to contest those seats. A real danger 
emerged that instead of a constructive body here there might be 
a recurrence of the old party-economic aktiv. This, of course, 
was bound to affect the voters' attitude. 
  Emerging from the woodwork, the partyocrats and opponents of 
the radical transformation of the country bombarded people with 
a torrent of propaganda that has been so well rehearsed in the 
past. Leaflets appeared in Bryansk "advising" voters to vote 
unfailingly for the communists and, of course, against the 
oblast Charter, which has been submitted to the residents' 
verdict. Such a familiar "corrupt leadership," such a familiar 
method! Victory at any price -- that is the usual principle of 
the opponents of the reforms. But it seems that the "champions 
of the people's well-being" had not given any thought to what 
actual work they would do on the voters' behalf should they 
happen to win. For example, how did Federation Council Deputy 
Petr Shirshov, recently elected chairman of the CIS Countries' 
Defense Committee, plan physically and geographically to combine 
that job with his work in the oblast duma? After all, Petr 
Petrovich was so busy that he could not even attend a 
prearranged news conference, and the candidate sent an assistant 
to represent his interests. 
  Do these factors not explain the unprecedentedly low turnout 
of voters in Bryansk? By the end of polling none of the city 
electoral districts had managed to pass the necessary 25-percent 
target. It was only the turnout among rural inhabitants which 
made the elections in the oblast valid.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Filippovich Shumeyko, Russian </F>
minister of press and mass information, by unidentified 
SVOBODNAYA ZONA reporter; place and date not given: "Vladimir 
Shumeyko: `The Treaty With Kaliningrad Oblast Will Be Signed'"] 
  [Text] [Reporter] Vladimir Filippovich, much is currently 
being said about the following subject: After the treaty on the 
division of power between Tatarstan and the federal organs is 
concluded, a similar treaty will be signed with Kaliningrad 
Oblast. Who is the initiator of this project? 
  [Shumeyko] The initiative to conclude the treaty between the 
Kaliningrad Oblast administration and the federal government 
belongs to the Security Council. I would like to emphasize that 
the Potsdam Agreement has no time limit. However, some 
politicians use its 50th anniversary to raise the issue of 
Kaliningrad's status, claiming that the term of this agreement 
expires because the USSR and Stalin no longer exist. 
Furthermore, they state that Russia is not the legal heir to 
the Soviet Union, and Kaliningrad Oblast could become a German 
protectorate or a separate state. At the same time, some 
propose setting up a demilitarized zone on the territory of 
Kaliningrad Oblast because the presence of troops allegedly 
blocks economic development, and so on. 
  Therefore, the Security Council decided to sign this 
agreement. 
  [Reporter] What provisions will the agreement include? Will 
relations be altered? 
  [Shumeyko] The power and rights to be relegated by the 
federal government to the local authorities correspond to the 
equivalent volume of power and rights to be handed over by local 
authorities to the federal government. Thus, the Security 
Council came to the conclusion that currently it is expedient to 
relegate as much power as possible to the local administration 
to enable it to react operatively and timely to any 
developments. Instant and adequate reaction by the local 
authorities to every development in this area is of key 
importance for Russia. 
  Hence, we will thoroughly prepare this agreement. We will 
properly decide what functions should be relegated and which of 
them should remain under the jurisdiction of the Federal 
Government.

"Republic of Ingushetia"] 
  [Text] According to a report from the press service of the 
permanent mission of the Republic of Ingushetia under the 
Russian Federation president, the meeting of working groups of 
the conciliation commission for Ingushetia and North Ossetia 
scheduled in the town of Terek (Kabardino-Balkaria) for 29 March 
did not take place owing to the Vladikavkaz delegation's failure 
to appear. The Ingush delegation returned to Nazran. Earlier, 
Republic of Ingushetia President Ruslan Aushev forwarded to 
Akhsarbek Galazov, head of the Republic of North Ossetia, a 
package of proposals on a settlement of relations between the 
two republics. Since terms for the return of Ingush refugees to 
North Ossetia and preparations for a meeting between the 
Republic's leaders early in April were supposed to form the main 
topic of the talks in Terek, in the Ingush side's assessment the 
failure of the North Ossetia delegation to come to the talks can 
be assessed as "boycotting the process of normalizing the 
situation in the region."

  [Text] Ingushetia has again accused North Ossetia of 
boycotting the process of normalizing the situation in the area. 
A letter to the chairman of the Council of the Federation 
Vladimir Shumeyko says the tactics of North Ossetia during the 
past year and a half has been procrastinating a settlement by 
senseless talks, the failure to carry out approved protocols and 
agreements. 
  The first round of the talks which were supposed to work out 
documents for the 2 April meeting of the presidents of North 
Ossetia and Ingushetia should have taken place in Terek, 
Kabardino-Balkaria on Tuesday. However, according to Interfax 
reporters the Ossetian side was late an hour and a half for the 
negotiations. The Ingush side regarded this as a demonstration 
of disrespect and left for home. 
  The Ossetian side was late for the meeting because of a car 
crash in which two persons were injured and taken to hospital. 
The Ingush side waved off the explanation as groundless.

<F P=106> [Report by Natalya Pachegina in the "Negotiations" column: </F>
"Groznyy Is Unhappy With Russia's Terms. Nonetheless It Is 
Ready for Dialogue"] 
  [Text] The results of the preliminary talks in Moscow 
between Chechen Republic State Secretary Aslambek Akbulatov and 
Russian presidential administration chief Sergey Filatov have 
not as yet received official approval in Groznyy. According to 
Republic parliament chairman Yakhyat Idigov, Chechnya regards 
the positions outlined by both sides at this stage as fairly 
satisfactory. Russia's conditions (there are two) are that 
Chechnya will continue to be a component of the Russian 
Federation and that democratic elections be held there, Sergey 
Shakhray, Russian nationalities and regional policy minister, 
told a State Duma session. It is another matter, Idigov said, 
that the Chechen leadership is in no haste to accept these terms 
as an expression of the government viewpoint on the issue of 
relations with the republic. "We know Shakhray's position," 
NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA's correspondent was told, "but this does not 
mean that these are actually Russia's terms." Groznyy knows 
that there are forces in Russia capable of abandoning the old- 
fashioned ambitions. 
  In this respect, the interlocutor made clear, Groznyy does 
not see the Russian State Duma and the Federation Council as 
reliable allies. Primarily because in the eyes of the incumbent 
Chechen authorities their Russian colleagues do not represent 
legitimate executive bodies. Nonetheless, Groznyy is left with 
no other option than to accept the inevitable, especially given 
that over here "it is traditional to respect the choice of 
Russia's peoples who have elected the present composition of the 
Federal Assembly." 
  With respect to the possibility of the anti-Dudayev 
opposition's using the name and authority of Ruslan Khasbulatov, 
who now lives in Groznyy, Idigov noted that Ruslan Khasbulatov, 
a citizen of Chechnya, a well-known advocate of the idea of "a 
single and indivisible Russia," will not find it very easy to 
retain his authority among his fellow countrymen. Recalling the 
details of the nearly two-centuries-old Russian-Chechen 
"alliance," speaker Idigov observed that furthermore, on the 
issue of Chechnya's independence, the anti-Dudayev opposition 
fully shares the position of Groznyy officialdom and that no 
Khasbulatov or his admirers, "bent by Soviet rule," will manage 
"to buy the hard-won freedom so cheaply." Neither will this 
"maneuver" come off with certain Russian politicians who are 
trying, as it is known to Groznyy, to "involve" Khasbulatov in 
the complicated Russian-Chechen relations.

<F P=106> [Report by Lyubov Tsukanova citing remarks by Sergey </F>
Samoylov, deputy chief of the Administration for Territorial 
Affairs under the President's Administration, under "Regional 
Elections" rubric: "Who Has Been Voted Onto Local Organs of 
Power"] 
  [Text] "Today we have only the preliminary data on the 
elections," Sergey Samoylov, deputy chief of the Administration 
for Territorial Affairs under the President's Administration, 
told our correspondent. "At the moment it is still too early to 
analyze the composition of the local-level representative 
organs; that is a task for the next few days. But one or two 
preliminary conclusions can be drawn: For instance, we were 
attracted by the election proceedings in Kemerovo Oblast. Of 
the 35 districts, elections were valid in 30. Nineteen 
supporters of Aman Tuleyev, the former oblast soviet chairman, 
headed by Tuleyev himself, were voted onto the representative 
organ, and 11 of the deputies elected are supporters of the head 
of the administration and his course. The future representative 
assembly will thus be determined by by-elections for five 
deputies. 
  "Running for the Novosibirsk Oblast Soviet of Deputies (such 
is the name of the representative organ) was the former chairman 
of the local oblast soviet, a `star' of all antipresidential 
campaigns. He was elected along with a significant number of 
his supporters. 
  "We forecast that the elections would prove invalid in 
Magadan Oblast: This region has a very difficult social 
situation, and sends many complaints to the president, and 
indeed, of the 17 districts, elections were valid only in 10. 
We hoped that the elections would take place more or less 
evenly in Samara Oblast, and that a good guberniya duma would be 
elected, but the results do not empower the representative organ 
to begin work. Elections to the organs of local self-government 
were valid here in only half the districts. 
  "Ryazan Oblast is a special case -- voters elected 19 
deputies, there was a fairly large turnout, but the people of 
Ryazan had raised the bar which they have to clear: In order 
for the elctions to be deemed valid, not less than 35 percent of 
voters had to take part in the vote here. This bar was cleared 
in only 12 districts, and the representative organ cannot begin 
work because it is one deputy short. 
  "The conflict between Nizhniy Novgorod's governor and the 
head of the oblast center administration could not fail to 
affect the course of the elections. The collapse of the 
elections in the city suggest that the legislative assembly will 
be composed of people of a sufficiently conservative cast of 
mind."

Will Be Counted by...the Courts"] 
  [Text] St. Petersburg -- Elections in the city on the Neva 
could be ruled valid in only half of the 50 districts. And even 
there, whether they are legally valid or not, will have to be 
decided by the city court, since city Mayor Anatoliy Sobchak has 
rejected a protest from the prosecutor's office over the 
extension of the voting hours in the ballot, which took place 20 
March. The fate of a further 25 seats will be decided in the 
fall. However, the new organ of representative power could 
prove noncompetent -- its legal authority is determined by the 
presence of two-thirds of elected deputies.

<F P=106> [Report by Viktor Metchikov: "It Is Not a Duma That Has </F>
Been Elected, But a Council of Administration Heads"] 
  [Text] Kursk -- Last Sunday, 36 deputies were elected to 
45 seats in the Kursk Oblast Duma. The citizens' level of 
participation was as a whole fairly high at 47 percent. 
  In short, the elections took place, but now with hindsight 
you think: What was the point of holding them at all? No 
representative power as such has come into being in the oblast. 
Twenty-one of the 36 new deputies are rayon administration 
heads. Meaning that they themselves will write the local laws as 
well as executing and monitoring them.... 
  This situation is not new, but in our parts, where it is 
"getting worse" with every successive election, it is 
interesting that the townspeople long ago surrendered their 
voting rights to the rural areas. It was actually there that 
voting went amazingly smoothly, But the elections could be said 
to have been boycotted in eight out of 12 districts in Kursk. 
In four of the oblast center's districts the turnout proved to 
be the minimum allowed, and, as it is not hard to divine, it was 
on the whole elderly people who voted here. They accordingly 
entrusted deputies' powers to a former oblast military commissar 
and pensioner for some years now, M. Ovsyannikov, and one of the 
leaders of the oblast Communist Party organization, N. Ivanov.... 
  V. Aseyev, first secretary of the Russian Communist Workers 
Party Oblast Committee, and another communist, successfully got 
into the Oblast Duma from the mining district of Zheleznogorsk, 
and the nuclear power workers' city of Kurchatov, as promised, 
made a show of not turning up at the polling places -- the 
turnout was only about 12 percent here -- because their wages 
have not been paid for a long time. It is a paradox of the 
times when, it would seem, the need to qualitatively change the 
authorities is greater and more acute in those places where the 
people do not wish to participate in voting for them.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS commentator Lyudmila Yermakova] </F>
  [Excerpts] Moscow, 30 Mar -- The Central Electoral 
Commission has told an ITAR-TASS commentator that between last 
December and the end of this March there were local elections in 
69 regions of Russia, 60 of which were declared valid. In the 
overwhelming majority of these regions, additional elections 
needed to be held to fill local assemblies as a result of 
voters' passivity the first time around. [passage omitted] 
  In the Chuvash Republic, elections took place in 28 out of 
47 
constituencies; in Voronezh Oblast -- in 35 out of 45; in 
Kemerovo Oblast -- in 30 out of 35; and in Nizhnyy Novgorod -- 
in 32 out of 45 constituencies. 
  As an illustration of how politicians were more active then 
voters, it was noted that in Belgorod Oblast, there were 104 
candidates for 21 seats; 198 for 48 in Kirov Oblast; 187 for 30 
in Omsk Oblast; and 210 candidates for 50 seats in Orel Oblast. 
  Only 19 percent of candidates in the elections had stood on 
party tickets. The Communists were the most active party. In 
the 27 March elections, 34 Russian Communist Party members were 
elected to local assemblies, out of 200 candidates. 
  Former oblast Soviet chairmen were elected as deputies in 
Kemerovo, Tambov, Voronezh, Novosibirsk, and other Oblasts.

<F P=106> [Report by O. Padenko from Vladivostok; from the "Pacific </F>
Ocean" program] 
  [Text] Yevgeniy Nazdratenko, head of the Maritime Kray 
administration who has just returned from Moscow, held a news 
conference in Vladivostok. He began by rebutting criticism by 
the VLADIVOSTOK newspaper, which in an article, accused him of 
lobbying for Japanese technology to process nuclear submarine 
waste. The newspaper claimed that, unlike the costly equipment 
from Japan, our Far East scientists offer a version which is 
both cheaper and much more effective. 
  However, Yevgeniy Nazdratenko emphasized that our equipment 
was still at the laboratory stage, while the Japanese technology 
has already been tried in industrial applications at every 
Japanese nuclear station and could quickly save Maritime Kray 
residents from a catastrophic accumulation of nuclear waste. 
What is more, the equipment will be installed free of charge. 
  After this, the governor made the following statement: 
  [Begin Nazdratenko recording] On the basis of edict No. 54-1 
of the Russian Federation State Duma, issued on 11 February 
1994, on the legal basis for the election of organs of state 
power of federal members of the Russian Federation and of organs 
of local self rule, and on guaranteeing the voting rights of 
citizens; and in accordance with article No. 5 of decree No. 
2265 from the President of the Russian Federation, issued on 22 
December 1993, on guarantees of local self rule in the Russian 
Federation; and taking into consideration the numerous appeals 
by city and rayon administrations, political parties, public 
movements, and voters, and the need to search for a means of 
social protection for the needy in society; and in coordination 
with the Central Election Commission of the Russian Federation, 
I hereby decree: 
  1. To transfer the date of elections for the Maritime Kray 
Duma and organs of local self rule from 27 March 1994 to 23 
October 1994. 
  2. To recommend to the Election Commission of the Maritime 
Kray that it prepare, before 30 April 1994, a proposal to ensure 
the implementation of the above-mentioned decree. 
  3. That Tereshkov, head of the finance department, and 
Stepanovich, head of the accounts department, are to direct 
funding allocated by the kray administration for conducting the 
election campaign to city and rayon administrations to solve 
issues of social protection for needy citizens. [end recording] 
  [Padenko] Then Yevgeniy Nazdratenko answered questions by 
journalists on such topics as the scandalous action taken 
against Viktor Cherepkov, the mayor of Vladivostok. He denied 
reports by several news agencies that claimed the municipality 
building was surrounded by OMON [special purpose militia unit] 
troops, bonfires and many protesters bearing placards. We 
journalists verified this denial personally when we visited the 
municipality building immediately after the news conference. 
There were no bonfires or demonstrations. The building is 
protected by reinforced police units, and the tenth floor, where 
the offices of the city administration leadership are located, 
are a shambles. Repairs to the offices are being carried out, 
they are also being cleaned and furniture is being replaced 
because, it seems, the previous leadership did not even keep 
their own workplace clean. The new leaders saw the similarity 
between this scene and the neglect in the city. The new 
authorities, therefore, issued decree No.1 declaring a sanitary 
and epidemiological emergency in Vladivostok. It was signed by 
Konstantin Tolstoshein, acting head of city administration. 
Here is his what he said: 
  [Begin Tolstoshein recording] We must clean the city before 
9 May, in time for the national holiday, the holiday of 
veterans, the holiday of victory. Church holidays fall on 
approximately the same dates. We simply must tidy the city and 
make it look as it should. 
  The second issue is the work of the city transport 
authorities. The way the city transport system works today... 
  [Padenko, interrupting] ...Free of charge. 
  [Tolstoshein] Free of charge or not is a secondary issue. 
First, it must start working in an orderly fashion. Trains, 
trams, and trolley buses must function properly. There is a 
problem: The dacha season is about to begin, and electric 
trains should be running. After all, not everyone in 
Vladivostok has a car, so we have to deal with this issue, too. 
  Third, there are very few stores in the city that cater to 
veterans of World War II, or Afghanistan, Chernobyl victims, or 
diabetics; most of them are closed. In other words, we are also 
working on this problem. I have met and resolved this issue 
with the state reserve, so we will open several additional 
stores over the next few days, and we will supply food products 
and necessities there at much lower prices. 
  Fourth, strange as it may seem, the winter is over, and we 
are taking care of the city, cleaning and washing it and so on, 
but we have already started to prepare for next winter. [end 
recording] 
  [Padenko] A demonstration supporting the ousted mayor was 
held yesterday in Vladivostok central square. Even Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy was expected, though he did not fly in. 
  A commission from Moscow began its work in the kray 
administration building. The highest legislative organs are 
looking into the Cherepkov affair, and Viktor Ivanovich 
[Cherepkov] himself declared a hunger strike in his home.

  [Text] The Minister for Nationalities Sergey Shakhray 
believes that the agreement on civic accord in Russia can be 
given a legal form. In a Tuesday interview for Interfax he 
expressed the opinion that the State Duma can pass it as a law 
to be approved by the Council of the Federation and signed by 
the president. 
  In Shakhray's opinion, initially the agreement on civic 
peace 
should be signed by parliamentary groups and leading political 
parties. He is also convinced that if the work on the document 
is done correctly, the process will be joined by all political 
forces. "Parties and movements refusing to sign it will remain 
outside the political process," the minister said. 
  Shakhray sees the greatest danger in the possibility that 
several documents will appear. "If the right, left and center 
each write their own agreements and start a competition of 
documents, this can lead to a war of peace charters," he 
remarked. 
  Shakhray assumed that after studying the draft agreement on 
accord the president will submit the document to the parliament 
and government. He did not rule out the possibility that the 
draft can be published for a public debate. 
  In Shakhray's opinion, the agreement should set the rules of 
political activities for two years. "During this time we should 
concentrate on efforts to overcome the economic crisis," he said. 
  Shakhray is the leader of the Party of Russian Unity and 
Concord.

  [Text] The Coordinating Council of the Democratic Russia 
movement has sent a letter to President Yeltsin voicing its 
support for the president-initiated policy of civil accord. 
  The letter says, however, that the memorandum on civil peace 
between the main political forces should be amended. It should 
include a mechanism for ensuring all the signatories abide by 
it. The adoption of a law banning fascism and extremism by the 
Federal Assembly might provide such a guarantee. 
  The Democratic Russia movement also insists that 
representatives of political forces which violate Russian laws, 
provoke mass disturbances, instigate national enmity and 
advocate war and violence, should not be allowed to sign this 
memorandum.

  [Text] Moscow March 30 TASS--An explosion which occurred in 
the Osenny Boulevard in the vicinity of a new residence of the 
Russian president "does not have a political colouring", 
ITAR-TASS was told at the Russian president's press service. 
"This is an ordinary crime," the press service said, relying on 
a conclusion made by competent interior officials. 
  At 12:30 p.m. Wednesday, an explosive device went off in a 
Zhiguli car parked in the yard of a house located in the Osenny 
Boulevard, 12, block 2. The explosion killed a driver of the 
"Oton" trade company who lived there, and "a criminal boss" was 
injured. The criminal was hospitalized. Two more girls, aged 8 
and 10, were injured. The explosion was presumably targeted at 
the "criminal element", interior officials said. 
  The incident occurred at a distance of one kilometer from a 
new city residence of the Russian president. Neither Boris 
Yeltsin, nor his family are living in the new house yet.

<F P=106> [Vasiliy Kononenko article: "Yeltsin May Run in 1996 </F>
Presidential Election"] 
  [Text] Your IZVESTIYA correspondent was told this 
sensational news in confidence by the Kremlin on the evening of 
30 March. And a day later when asked "Is Boris Yeltsin ruling 
himself out of the election campaign?" Press Secretary V. 
Kostikov unequivocally told journalists: 
  "I do not think that the president will leave the bridge 
unless he is confident that the helm is in safe hands." 
  Your IZVESTIYA correspondent learned that the press 
secretary 
had a conversation with the president the day before to obtain 
explanations ahead of his meeting with journalists regarding the 
main problems worrying society today. Needless to say, they 
included the subject of the presidential election campaign. 
Here is a significant detail: The president's aides put around 
a dozen newspapers on his desk every day. More often than not 
he only looks at the headlines, the leads, because he does not 
have time for anything else. But the president did want to read 
in full the article published in IZVESTIYA 29 March entitled 
"Boris Yeltsin Launches Election Campaign," since he did not 
trust his services' reports and summaries. Here is his response 
(according to his press secretary). 
  The first signs of political peace or at least truce have 
emerged in society. The idea of a political accord among 
various social forces is beginning to take shape. It would be 
rash to turn Russia into a boxing ring. There are two years to 
go until the presidential election. Election fever would fuel 
the situation. A political breathing space is what is needed, a 
moratorium on political battles. 
  V. Kostikov also hinted at a possible way of B. Yeltsin's 
joining the election campaign. "Analysts forecasting Yeltsin's 
departure from the political scene in 1996," he said, "are 
formulating schemes based on the theoretical party structure in 
Russia today. At the same time they are becoming distracted 
from the most important thing -- the population, the voters. 
Can we rule out the idea of large groups of Russians nominating 
Yeltsin to stand for another term? In that case Yeltsin would 
naturally have to make a decision. And that decision would 
depend on his personal wishes, concept of duty, and political 
responsibility...." 
  The press secretary did not shirk the question of a possible 
presidential election victory for Rutskoy or Zhirinovskiy. "The 
very idea of that being possible dramatically reduces the 
standard of political ethics in society," he said. "A whole 
series of their statements are outside the law. Implementing 
these appeals could be disastrous for the country and the 
population. You cannot inure the population to the idea that a 
man with the mentality and vocabulary of a street hooligan can 
end up head of a great country. Yeltsin's team is confident 
that the president will not surrender Russia to these people." 
  He dwelt in detail on the content of the Accord on Civil 
Peace, which is being drafted and which the president is 
consistently forcing through despite certain opposition forces' 
skeptical attitude to it. According to the press secretary, the 
eight-page text contains a preamble and the following sections: 
  -- the political life of society; 
  -- regional policy; 
  -- nationalities policy; 
  -- socioeconomic policy; 
  -- the security of citizens and the state; 
  -- integrity, ethics, morality, and culture; 
  -- the conditions and mechanisms for the fulfillment of the 
agreement; 
  -- the responsibility of the signatories to the document. 
  Presidential aides G. Satarov and Yu. Baturin, as well as 
representatives of the parliament, government, and public 
organizations, have taken part in drafting the Accord on Civil 
Peace. The press secretary stressed that the sides did not seek 
compromises in the field of ideology because that is impossible. 
The task was to highlight those points that would act as a 
reliable base for cooperation among all forces in order to 
ensure peace in the country. Efforts must be concentrated on 
specific issues, for instance a contentious government decision 
or the threat of wholesale strikes, etc. The document makes 
provision for the creation of a conciliation commission. But 
the president is not happy with the text at the moment. He 
thinks it ponderous and reminiscent of a constitution. There 
will be consultations over the next few days with the future 
parties to the agreement. 
  It is already known that the president has had conversations 
on this issue with V. Shumeyko, who voiced a positive opinion of 
the draft document. Regrettably, the State Duma will probably 
give it, if not a hostile reception, then at least a very 
critical one. Nevertheless, no matter what the result of these 
efforts, one thing is important. The whole range of political 
views and party plans will be manifested during the 
consultations.

<F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>
  [Text] ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA today published a statement by 
the Russian Federation Committee for the Press officially 
warning OBSHCHAYA GAZETA that its actions are regarded as a 
deliberate attempt to destabilize society and undermine the 
constitutional power. 
  Let me remind you that this refers to the recent publication 
of the scandalous version No. 1 of a coup d'etat allegedly being 
planned. 
  In reply to these accusations, Yegor Yakovlev, the founder 
of 
OBSHCHAYA GAZETA today told our television agency: 
  [Begin Yakovlev recording] [Video shows Yakovlev seated in 
office] If the Committee for the Press has not read OBSHCHAYA 
GAZETA, which stated that it was publishing a document known to 
be false and proving why it was false [pauses]... This is the 
first point. 
  Second, there is Article 58 of the law on the press, or 
rather on the mass media, which says that any attempt to hamper 
the publishing of information will be subject to disciplinary, 
administrative, and criminal punishment. I do not know who 
signed this statement, whether it was Mr. (Mironov) or someone 
else, but when Mr. (Mironov) accused OBSHCHAYA GAZETA of warning 
society against this provocation -- and it was the first to 
publish this and was punished for doing it -- in this way we are 
being told: If you learn about another provocation, keep quiet. 
When a doctor tells his patient that he is ill, there is no 
point in hurling accusations at the doctor; similarly, this was 
a sick document produced by a sick society. We just 
demonstrated this. 
  Another thing -- otherwise it would be too sad to talk about 
these attacks and persecutions. I recall the time when 
MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI was being persecuted in about the same way, 
with the same zeal, and more or less by the same organizations, 
though by different newspapers - yet now they say that 
MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI was always right. [end recording]

Court accepted the protest of the Prosecutor General against the 
closure of the criminal case of members of the State Emergency 
Committee in August 1991 Gennadiy Yanayev and Aleksandr Tizyakov 
in connection with the amnesty. Earlier at the trial of leaders

  The Presidium believes the case was closed in violation of

  [Text] Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin was the most 
influential political figure in Russia last February, according 
to a survey conducted by the Vox Populi public opinion service 
(its head Professor Boris Grushin is a member of the 
presidential council). President Yeltsin who headed the list 
last December was the second. 
  The rating was determined by 50 experts: editors of leading 
publications and prominent political analysts. 
  The composition of the fist five changed considerably 
compared with January: Yegor Gaydar, Vladimir Zhirinovsky and 
Vladimir Shumeyko dropped out. Their places were taken 
accordingly by the Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov, Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev and the Chairman of the Central Bank Victor 
Gerashchenko. 
  The greatest change in rating happened to the Deputy Foreign 
Minister Vitaly Churkin who skyrocketed from position 98-99 to 
16-16 which can be accounted to his key role in Russian 
diplomacy in Bosnia. The Tatar President Mintimer Shaymyev 
moved from 27th to 10th place which is attributed to the signing 
of the agreement between Russia and Tatarstan. 
  The other politicians whose influence grew included Defence 
Minister Pavel Grachev (8), presidential national security 
advisor Yuriy Baturin (12), the Fuel and Energy Minister Yuriy 
Shafranik (25), the secretary of the Security Council Oleg 
Lobov, the chief of the External Intelligence Service Yevgeniy 
Primakov.

  [Text] Moscow March 30 TASS -- If the government does not 
take action soon to finance the TV and radio broadcasting 
network, the volume of broadcasting will be reduced by four 
times, says a message of the Central Committee of the Trade 
Union of Communication Workers, sent to President Yeltsin and 
Prime Minister Chernomyrdin. 
  The message said that communication workers, who are 
ensuring 
the functioning of the system, received only 7.5 billion roubles 
in payment of this year's debt, which amounts to 209 billion. 
This makes less than four per cent. The Russian Ministry of 
Finance plans to provide financing in the current year only for 
25 per cent of TV and radio programmes. The Chita radio 
broadcasting station has already been stopped because of the 
absence of money. Radio broadcasting stations in 
Blagoveshchensk and some other Russian cities may also be closed 
down soon. 
  According to the message, "the president should have a final 
say in settling this important problem." Communication workers, 
who are practically working gratis, stated that they would not 
be held responsible for the reduction of the volume of TV and 
radio broadcasting.

  [Text] Former Russian Finance Minister Boris Fedorov is now 
in charge of the State Duma's sub-committee for monetary and 
credit policy. At his news conference today, Fedorov made his 
views known concerning the current government's economic 
policies: 
  [Begin Fedorov recording] I think that not a single economic 
action was carried out over the past three months that could be 
called reformist, even in the conventional sense of the word. 
  At the same time, nothing bad was done either, or almost 
nothing, save for the abrogation of the decision on excise 
duties on alcohol, and for the adoption of strange import 
tariffs, under which the budget revenue from import tariffs is 
declining while prices are rising. 
  The government is, in essence, on course and, as for me, I 
will support the budget, because given the quality of the 
current political situation I think that this budget can be the 
best possible one, at any rate where expenditure is concerned. 
  It is clear that the government and the Finance Ministry 
endeavored to keep in check the swelling expenditure we have 
experienced. However, attempts to keep the situation under 
control are not tantamount to any real forward movement and that 
is why my views are as follows: In the first place, the 
government must be given a further two or three months and we 
must take a look at how the situation develops in reality, how 
inflation shapes up in May and June. 
  I think that in principle, things have so far been going 
much 
better than could have been expected and in this context, again, 
I will broadly speak in support of the government and will not 
enter any opposition. [end recording]

  [Text] Moscow, 31 Mar -- "The paralysis of the financial 
system in the country is not allowing many formulated programs 
to be implemented." This was stated today by Russian First Vice 
Premier Oleg Soskovets at a sitting of the Russian Government. 
Summing up the results for the first qyarter of this year he 
referred to the drop in inflation as a positive element. On 
average it was 13-14 percent over the quarter. In addition, the 
first vice premier noted, a positive balance has been achieved 
in foreign trade. We have also been able to attain a definite 
stabilization of the population's standard of living. 
  However, Oleg Soskovets asserted, capital investments, which 
amounted to only 75-80 percent, have decreased. The volume of 
paid services fell by 40 percent, and the price index for 
industrial goods grew by 1.5 times. As far as the industrial 
sector is concerned, for example, the fall in production levels 
in light industry was 15 percent. The volume of freight carried 
by rail decreased by 23 percent. 
  Oleg Soskovets noted a deterioration in production activity 
in the fuel and energy complex, the export potential of which 
has significantly declined. According to him, owing to the the 
confused nature of the quota system Russia failed to deliver 1.5 
million tonnes of oil for export.

  [Text] Acting Russian Finance Minister Sergey Dubinin 
believes that the economic slump will be overcome and economic 
growth will begin late in 1994-early in 1995. He addressed 
those present at the round-table discussions in Moscow in which 
U.S. businessmen also took part. 
  Dubinin said that financial stabilization is becoming a 
reality. Inflation rates are reducing and by the end of the 
year, he believes, inflation will not exceed 5-7% a month. 
  We are entering a new stage of economic development, he 
said. 
Deals in rubles are becoming more profitable. This makes it 
possible to stabilize the currency rate though we do not face 
the task of making the currency rate fixed, he said. 
  Dubinin said Russian reforms are aimed at achieving 
financial 
stabilization and the overcoming of inflation. 
  Shock therapy did not work, said Dubinin. 
  The key to success in the anti-inflation policy is in the 
draft budget, he said. In line with the draft budget, the 
deficit for 1994 will not exceed 10% of GNP and only 
50%, he 
said, will be covered by Central Bank emission, while the other 
50% will be covered by government bonds and the 
attraction of 
foreign loans. 
  Russia will not agree to accept loans with high interest, he 
said. 
  Dubinin also said that the talks will continue with the 
Paris 
and London clubs of creditor countries on restructuring Russia's 
external debt. 
  Dubinin called on representatives of U.S. industrial circles 
to cooperate to raise money from the United States which could 
be used for investments into the Russian economy.

  [Text] Russia must go ahead with building a balanced navy 
which would include all types of warships, Deputy 
Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Navy Admiral Igor Kasatonov 
told Interfax. 
  He said priority would be given to the building of 
submarines, cruisers and anti-submarine warships with a 
displacement tonnage of 10,000-12,000 tons and medium-class 
vessels such as destroyers and patrol ships with a displacement 
tonnage of 4,000-5,000 tons. 
  On the future of Russia's aircraft carrier fleet, Kasatonov 
said that out of the three carriers it had, only one, Felix 
Kuznetsov, was on combat duty in the Pacific. The second 
carrier, Varyag, is 85 percent complete, but he said there was 
no money to finish the project at the moment. More 
disturbingly, the carrier is under construction at Nikolyayev 
shipyards belonging to Ukraine, which is also cash-starved, 
Kasatonov said. As for the third carrier, Ulyanovsk, it is yet 
to be assembled, he said. 
  Nonetheless, the admiral believes the current trend of 
building aircraft carriers will persist though Russia cannot 
afford this at present. At the same time if other CIS states 
are ready to help finance the program, Moscow will welcome this, 
Kasatonov said.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Igor Ivantsov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 30 Mar -- The situation in the defense 
industry sectors remains extremely serious. This was confirmed 
by the participants in a conference here today of leaders of 
Russian defense enterprises. 
  The avalanche-like nature of conversion and the reduction in 
state orders and state budget funding are the main reasons for 
the sharp slump in production. According to Viktor Glukhikh, 
chairman of the Russian Federation State Committee for the 
Defense Branches of Industry [Goskomoboronprom], production has 
slumped over the past three years by 78 percent. 
  The committee's action plan for the coming two years is 
intended to help rectify the situation in these sectors that 
possess a high scientific-technical potential, modern 
technologies, and a powerful manufacturing base. The plan was 
brought to the attention of the enterprise leaders. It is a 
document of almost 90 pages, which deals with practically all 
spheres of the defense industry and envisages the development of 
six major programs in the industry and their handover for 
government consideration. It also contains recommendations on 
improving the legislative base. 
  The enterprises should themselves also seek a way out of the 
complex situation more energetically, Viktor Glukhikh thinks. 
There are considerable prospects in this area, in his view, 
linked with the development of programs for defense industry 
enterprises that take deeper account of the interests of regions. 
  Those taking part in the conference said that priority 
measures should include increasing the preliminary payment for 
state orders from 20 to 75 percent, the financing of new 
developments, and the length of state order periods from one 
year to five years.

<F P=106> [Dmitriy Kholodov report: "Generals Conquer Politics. </F>
Appropriations Will Be Just Enough To Rename Something"] 
  [Text] Andrey Kozyrev will apparently soon have to make 
way for other people on the international scene. Following an 
active reform of the Armed Forces, the Defense Ministry risks 
turning into a Foreign Ministry. 
  It seems that everyone at the military ministry is engaged 
in 
foreign policy. Colonel General Kondratyev, deputy defense 
minister, is extinguishing "hot spots;" another deputy, Boris 
Gromov, is responsible for communications with the CIS 
countries. It is absolutely unclear who is handling army reform 
at the ministry. Even the Military Organization and Reform 
Administration is becoming the Military Policy Administration 
starting 1 April, "switching over" to the analysis of the 
NATO-proposed "Partnership for Peace" program. In addition, 
there is the International Treaty Administration, which also 
handles foreign policy matters. 
  People at the Defense Ministry have gotten used to renaming 
things: some of its structures have thus been "reformed" five 
or six times already within the past 18 months. For instance, 
the Main Personnel Administration [MPA] has become the Main 
Administration for the Training and Allocation of Personnel, 
only to be renamed the MPA once again. To all appearances, it 
is the renaming and cuts in the army, a process going on 
independently of anyone, that all reform in the Armed Forces 
will boil down to: the Defense Ministry has lost the battle for 
the budget, having received only half of what it requested. 
There is not enough money even to provide clothes for the 
ministerial personnel and the General Staff -- the Defense 
Ministry's warehouses are completely empty. 
  So, crying a lack of trench coats, trouser stripes, and 
subordinates could not but give a boost to "the foreign policy 
consciousness of the generals' masses."

<F P=106> [INTERFAX report: "Will Russia Become an Importer?"] </F>
  [Text] Russia may soon turn from an exporter of weapons 
into an importer, certain participants in a conference of 
leaders of Russia's defense enterprises, held in Yekaterinburg, 
believe. This was held within the framework of the "Weapons 
Industry Day" organized by the Russian Federation State 
Committee for the Defense Sectors of Industry. 
  Representatives of 70 enterprises and institutions in 
Russia's military-industrial complex discussed problems of the 
survival of the defense industry in the prevailing conditions. 
  It was noted at the conference that, whereas in 1990 25 
percent of the capacities of the military-industrial complex 
produced civilian output, in 1993 only 25 percent of the 
capacities of the defense complex were involved in the 
production of military output. 
  Oleg Borisov, general director of the "Promeksport" 
association, noted that the volume of Russian weapons exports 
has fallen considerably at the same time: Whereas in 1988 it 
totaled $12 billion, in 1993 the figure was one-sixth of this. 
  In their speeches, the participants also spoke of the fact 
that the funding of scientific projects in the 
military-industrial complex has fallen by a factor of 10-15 
compared with 1989. According to the weapons developers, this 
will lead to a situation where no one will take Russia seriously 
on the weapons market in a few years' time. 
  The participants in the conference demanded that the 
government take fundamental measures to support the 
military-industrial complex.

  [Text] Some of Moscow's industrial enterprises dealing with 
radioactive materials do not pass all of the radioactive waste 
to the Radon processing amalgamation. As a result, there are 
about 70 places contaminated with radioactive substances on the 
premises of Moscow's enterprises and even in the vicinity of 
apartment blocks, the Moscow Environmental Protection Committee 
told Interfax. Almost all of them have been eliminated by now, 
except 18 storages of low-radioactive waste in Krylatskoye, 
Lyublino, Strogino and some other districts. 
  The Moscow Environmental Protection Committee believes that 
as such these sites pose no threat to the population. But 
before building housing on them decontamination measures must be 
taken. The decontamination of one of such site, 26 kilometers 
from Moscow, is being completed. 
  The same source reports that there are more than 1,500 
enterprises and organizations in Moscow which use nuclear 
reactors, radioactive materials and products. 
  The worst danger is coming from 769 enterprises which create 
radioactive waste. In 1993, radiation control inspectors 
revealed 288 instances of violation of safety rules. 
  The Moscow Environmental Protection Committee announced that 
on the whole, Moscow's radiation level is light and measures 7 
to 14 microroentgen per hour.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report under the "Around the Clock Nonstop" </F>
rubric: "Ukraine Defense Ministry Urged To Pay Bills"] 
  [Text] We have come to learn from competent sources in 
Sevastopol that the Black Sea Fleet command sent a cable 
yesterday to General of the Army Vitaliy Radetskyy, Ukraine 
defense minister. 
  It says that, as of 28 March 1994, the debt of the Ukrainian 
military units that use electric power through military units of 
the Black Sea Fleet amounts to 4 billion karbovanets. As for 
the debt run up by customers subordinated to Ukraine's Defense 
Ministry to the construction department of the Black Sea Fleet, 
it is as high as 16.709 trillion karbovanets. 
  The Black Sea Fleet Command believes that this situation is 
evidence of the Ukraine Defense Ministry's having violated the 
understanding reached between the two republics at the 
presidential level on joint financing of the Black Sea Fleet. 
In essence, the Ukrainian military is solving its own problems 
at the expense of the Russian Navy. 
  Unless the Defense Ministry pays up the debt to the Black 
Sea 
Fleet before 10 April, the Black Sea Fleet command will halt the 
construction and assembly work being done for Ukraine's Defense 
Ministry, and make all Ukrainian military units use their own 
power resources, the cable says.

group and chairman of the Kyrgyz Supreme Soviet who had met with 
Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev Wednesday, told Interfax

  Sherinkulov expressed the hope that a candid exchange of

  The Russian Foreign Ministry supports the desire of the CIS

Galina Sidorova, a political adviser of Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev, who had met with head of the CIS Karabakh peace group 
and chairman of the Kyrgyz Supreme Soviet, told Interfax that 
the ministry maintained close contacts with the group and was 
willing to help it with expert advice. "We do our best as an 
executive body. But parliaments are in a position to play quite 
a different role in resolving the conflict by creating an 
appropriate environment for acceptance of what the executive 
branch has prepared," she said.

may begin proceedings to establish whether an act is 
constitutional on the initiative of the president, parliament, a 
permanent parliamentary commission, a group of no less than 70 
lawmakers, the Supreme Court, the highest economical court and 
the prosecutor general of the Republic. 
  The Constitutional Court shall be elected by the parliament. 
The Constitutional Court is entitled to adopt resolutions and 
begin its activities only if no less than seven judges have been 
elected. Chairman of a parliamentary commission of the 
Belarusian parliament assured that elections of the judges of 
the Constitutional Court may be held no sooner than the 
Belarusian parliament meets in its spring session scheduled 
approximately on 17 May.

  [Begin Giorgadze recording] If we are talking about Georgian

was built on Soviet traditions. We shall retain the good 
features of that tradition and, in fact, we have already done 
so. The bad features that the society rejected will not be 
implemented. 
  As for today's confirmation, of course the factor of trust

<F P=106> ["Unofficial translation" of statement issued by the Latvian </F>
Cabinet of Ministers concerning a package of agreements on 
Russian troop withdrawal signed in Moscow on 15 March] 
  [Text] In support of signing and ratification at the Saeima 
[parliament] of the Republic of Latvia of a package of 
agreements initialed at the intergovernmental negotiations 
between the Republic of Latvia and the Federation of Russia on 
March 15, 1994, the Government of the Republic of Latvia 
stresses that signing and ratification of the agreement on 
Russian troop pull-out from the territory of Latvia by August 
31, 1994. After talks which had lasted for two years, for the 
first time there has finally emerged a chance to solve a part of 
issues which are of vital importance to Latvia, which would lead 
to strengthening the sovereignty of Latvia. By stating the 
deadline of Russian troop withdrawal, the chances to secure 
international control of the process are considerably increased. 
Signing of the agreement will show once again Latvia's 
willingness to join the community of European nations as a full- 
fledged member of the community. A number of countries over the 
world have voiced their support of initializing the agreement, 
describing it as a success of Latvian diplomacy. 
  Drafting an agreement on temporary operating of the Skrunda 
radar base in the Republic of Latvia was a compromise, and the 
Latvian Government had set a series of conditions for adopting 
it, which have been accepted by the Russian part, namely, 
internationalization of the site, establishing the international 
control over the facility, its civil status, and security 
guarantees for Latvia. The aspects have been discussed at 
numerous consultations with Western countries. Signing the 
agreement would rule out a possibility to put to operation the 
second tier of the Skrunda radar base and would allow to launch 
an immediate dismantling of the eventually most dangerous part 
of the facility. An exact date for terminating the operations 
of the remaining part of the Skrunda radar base, 31 August of 
1998, has been stated. The Skrunda site being stationed in the 
territory of Latvia without a respective agreement stating the 
exact deadline for its operation, would mean uncontrollable 
functioning of the facility in Latvia to last for an unspecified 
period of time. 
  Under the agreement the Russian part would be allowed to use 
only a strictly stated limited number of its own experts to 
secure functioning of the site. The agreement does not envisage 
any possibility to bring to the site a new equipment or 
additional contingent of experts, or to carry out modernization 
of the facility. 
  Compliance with the agreement is to be monitored by a 
special 
tri-lateral commission, including also representatives of the 
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. The control 
over the process of carrying out the agreement exercised by the 
CSCE, is not the sole guarantee, it is secured also by Latvia's 
participation in the NATO "Partnership for Peace" programme. 
The agreement would foster cooperation opportunities between 
Latvia and Western structures of collective security by showing 
that Latvia is a politically mature nation which is able to 
implement a compromise policy also in the interests of the 
international community. Additionally to the rental to be paid 
for the Skrunda radar base being stationed in Latvia, the 
Russian part commits itself to compensate for the damage caused 
to the local environment, if any. Persons which would arrive to 
Latvia to maintain the facility, would go under the general visa 
regulations. 
  The agreement on social status of the Russian retired 
militaries and their families does not provide for their legal 
position in the Republic of Latvia, which would be envisaged by 
the legislation of the Republic of Latvia. The claims by the 
Russian part to grant these people Latvian citizenship are ruled 
out. In the agreement the Russian part commits itself to 
continue payments of pensions to the retired militaries, as well 
as to compensate the health service provided for these people. 
  The Government of Latvia admits that the agreements contain 
some concessions which would bear hard on Latvia. The 
government, however, maintains that stating the deadline for 
Russian troop withdrawal is the top priority which would open 
the door for a real pull-out of the army from the territory of 
Latvia as soon as possible.

  [Text] Moscow, March 31 (AFP) -- Russia is reconsidering 
plans to join a partnership program with NATO and will not make 
a decision until sometime next autumn, presidential spokesman 
Vyacheslav Kostikov said Thursday. 
  "Boris Yeltsin believes six to seven months is needed" to 
make a decision, Kostikov said at a Kremlin news conference. 
"The president will not be rushed, he will discuss the matter 
with all political parties." 
  Russian and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) 
officials had previously indicated that Russia would join the 
program, known as Partnership for Peace, in April. 
  "Russia's interests must be preserved," Kostikov said, 
adding 
that "dangers exist" to Russia's membership in the program, 
which extends a cooperative link from NATO to its former east 
bloc adversaries. 
  Kostikov said that "many people" in Russia supported 
membership in the NATO program, notably officials in the foreign 
ministry, the Defense Ministry and the federal counterespionage 
service. 
  "But there are arguments against (joining) that must be 
taken 
into account," Kostikov said. 
  He said that in particular "one of the documents" involved 
in 
Russia's membership in the partnership program "does not 
correspond to Russia's interests." 
  Kostikov did not specify what document this was, but he 
stressed that an agreement on trade of Russian-made weapons 
"needs to be reviewed." 
  Arguments in favor of joining the program focused on closer 
cooperation with the West and maintaining high efficiency of the 
Russian Armed Forces comparable to Western levels. 
  Vladimir Lukin, the former Russian ambassador to Washington 
who now leads a pro-reform faction in parliament, earlier 
outlined seven questions which he said must be answered before 
Moscow could sign on to the Partnership scheme. 
  Those questions included how responsibilities were to be 
divided between member nations, how decisions were to be made, 
implications for military ties between the former Soviet 
republics, standardization of military hardware and how Russia 
was to finance its membership in the scheme. 
  "The answer to these questions is indispensable for a 
decision to be made on whether Russia will take part in the 
program," Lukin said at a news conference. 
  He stressed however that he was not necessarily opposed to 
Russia joining the partnership program, but noted that "long 
talks" with the NATO countries that proposed the plan were 
needed before Russia could make a decision. 
  In Warsaw, meanwhile, Polish Defence Minister Piotr 
Kolodziejczyk cast doubt on Moscow's sincerity in wanting to 
join the Partnership for Peace, suggesting the Russian 
leadership had political reasons for doing so. 
  "I think I am right in wondering if it is not just an 
expedient gesture," he told a press conference. "Russia looks 
like a besieged fortress. It is a self-isolation which helps 
them with their domestic political games." 
  He said Russian membership would be "a positive thing," 
adding that "the more secure and stable Russia is, the more 
secure Europe can feel." 
  "We hope admission to the Partnership for Peace will make 
Russia treat us as partners, and that they will at last 
understand that we are no longer their underlings," he said.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Chudodeyev report in the "Korean Peninsula" </F>
column: "The Russian Foreign Ministry Denies Possibility of Aid 
for Kim Il- song. The National-Patriots Shift Their Sympathies 
to the North Korean Dictator"] 
  [Excerpt] The 29 March INTERFAX report quoting Aleksandr 
Panov, former Russian ambassador to South Korea and currently 
Russian Federation deputy foreign minister, saying that Moscow 
will render assistance to North Korea in the event of unprovoked 
aggression against it because Russia, as successor to the USSR, 
is linked with the DPRK by a corresponding treaty of 1961, 
according to Foreign Ministry officials distorts the essence of 
the Russian position. In response to a request from SEGODNYA's 
correspondent to provide the full text of the deputy minister's 
statement, however, Foreign Ministry employees said that so far 
they had no verbatim record of the speech themselves. 
  Even so, such statements like those cited by INTERFAX are 
already being heard from deputies of the Russian State Duma. On 
28 March North Korea's main communist paper NODONG SINMUN 
printed, in the place where odes glorifying the "great leader" 
Kim Il-song are usually published, an "angry statement" by 
Viktor Ilyukhin, Sergey Baburin, Aleksandr Nevzorov, and other 
Russian parliamentarians about their "profound concern" over the 
aggravation of the situation in Korea (which is true in itself). 
They condemned not the North Korean blackmailing, however, but 
"certain U.S. circles advocating the so-called new world order 
and setting new unjustified demands on our traditional ally -- 
the DPRK -- which only exacerbates the situation and arouses 
surprise and indignation." [passage omitted]

Dmitriy Voskoboinikov, Igor Porshnev, and Vitaliy Trubetskoy] 
  [Text] The proposal made by the Kazakh President Nursultan 
Nazarbayev on the setting up of a Euro-Asian Union of CIS member 
states would generate more questions than answer them, a highly 
placed Russian Foreign Ministry official in charge of CIS 
affairs told Interfax. 
  He described Nazarbayev's idea as interesting "but every 
idea 
must be thoroughly prepared. In particular, there is no saying 
what consequences would follow for the CIS that has just won the 
status of an observer in the UN. If closer ties between two or 
more CIS member states frighten the others and the union becomes 
a purely formal body, this will hardly be a desirable outcome." 
  In his words, Russia wanted a stronger Commonwealth. "Ways 
have to be found to implement the Kazakh president's proposals 
that would be conducive to this goal," the diplomat said.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Gavrilenko article under the "Postscriptum: </F>
Events and Commentaries" rubric: "Nursultan Nazarbayev Always 
Has Ideas. In Moscow the President of Kazakhstan Left More Than 
Just His Signature on 23 Kazakhstani-Russian Documents"] 
  [Text] After taking his leave of Boris Yeltsin, Nursultan 
Nazarbayev visited the mayor of Moscow and Moscow State 
University in turn. Quite frankly, he amazed the Moscow public. 
Only not so much with the essence of what he said as with his 
shrewdness: Nursultan Abishevich said something which recently 
has been actively preying on the minds of politicians in a 
considerable part of the post-Soviet area. This is the idea of 
uniting it in a Eurasian Union [EAU]. "I believe," the 
president said at a reception in the capital's City Hall, "that 
it is necessary to disband the association within the CIS 
framework because it does not work." He went on to expound his 
views on the EAU. He believes that it is necessary to form 
supranational working organs to coordinate economic, defense, 
and foreign policies. The union must have a common parliament. 
This is to make it possible to bring together the laws of the 
states in the union. The EAU needs an interstate executive 
secretariat appointed by the heads of state and common 
citizenship registered in a single passport. Even the currency 
could be common and supranational -- like the European ECU.... 
Nursultan Nazarbayev concluded as follows: "We must take this 
step, and our children would continue strengthening this union." 
  In my view this idea needs least of all epithets like "new," 
"fresh," and "unexpected." I believe that epithets such as 
"sensible" and "realistic" suit it better. If you look at the 
abbreviation EAU, you perceive something familiar.... Well, of 
course, the European Union! But you certainly cannot suspect 
the Europeans of being rash and indulging in state romanticism 
-- it took them decades to arrive at their community. They 
surmounted difficult obstacles, which we have written about in 
different ways at different times -- ten years ago with playful 
skepticism, now with interested surprise and maybe even envy. 
Well I never: ...They are uniting while we are scattering. The 
bitter taste as a result of this, I believe, burns the souls of 
many people in the former Soviet republics. It is offensive to 
see Europeans chuckling about it. 
  I do not doubt that many people in Ukraine feel this burning 
sensation. The recent elections have made them feel it. They 
feel it in Moldavia [Moldova], where the new parliament has now 
begun working. Belorussia [Belarus] has also demonstrated this, 
with its firm desire for economic union. How will others 
respond to this? We shall see. But if we are or, at least, 
want to be realists, the EAU is a vital idea. From all 
viewpoints: historical, economic, military, not to mention 
geopolitical.... In this part of the globe, where mankind is 
accustomed to seeing a unified state, we must not procreate 
dozens of weak formations at odds with each other. Of course, 
some people will see an image of the old empire. But it is 
perfectly within our power to create a union on totally new 
principles, without the former imperial aroma. So let us thank 
Nursultan Nazarbayev for his political telepathy: He has 
perceived in time and given voice to the mental impulses of many 
of us. 
  I would like to think that Nazarbayev's idea was not 
announced in Moscow without the Russian president's knowledge. 
I want to believe it.

  [Text] Sevastopol March 30 TASS -- The Black Sea Fleet 
dispute can be resolved only by the presidents of Russia and 
Ukraine, according to Fleet Commander Eduard Baltin. 
  In an interview with ITAR-TASS on Wednesday, Baltin's 
spokesman Andrey Grachev said the commander hopes that President 
Boris Yeltsin and President Leonid Kravchuk will solve the 
problem soon and find the only correct decision reflecting the 
military, political and economic possibilities of the two 
countries. 
  Baltin believes that the dependence of military and 
political 
tasks on the economic situation is crucial for solving the Black 
Sea Fleet problem. Russia and Ukraine have no big 
disagreements, while those that exist can be solved by political 
means, the spokesman quoted Baltin as saying. 
  The fleet commander considers himself subordinated to both 
presidents and agrees all his decisions with them, Grachev 
continued. He voiced concern about unilateral decisions 
concerning the Black Sea Fleet by the Ukrainian Defence 
Ministry, stressing that the Russian side remains adherent to 
the Massandra Agreements which must be observed. 
  Commenting on Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov's proposal to 
Ukraine to withdraw its troops from the Crimea, Grachev said 
that should such a decision appear, the Black Sea Fleet 
commanders will provide Moscow, Kiev and Simferopol with firm 
guarantees of the security of their southern frontiers.

  [Text] Almaty, 30 Mar -- The CIS consultative council on 
labor, migration, and social protection of the population 
finished its work here today. Its attention was focused on 
problems connected with the development of a common labor market. 
  It discussed reports by labor ministers on migration 
processes, the social and labor situation in CIS states and 
measures being undertaken in this sphere, as well as matters 
relating to cooperation and interaction in training and raising 
the qualifications of staff employed in central labor bodies. 
The council decided to create joint training programs and a 
data bank on labor and social protection matters. 
  It examined a number of draft agreements, in particular a 
multilateral agreement on reciprocal actions and cooperation in 
work safety. Draft bilateral agreements were prepared between 
Russia and Kazakhstan on regulating migration processes, 
employment of the population, investigation of production 
accidents and also a number of others of importance for the two 
states.

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow March 31 (ITAR-TASS) -- Today's Russian 
newspapers concentrate on an idea of setting up a Eurasian Union 
(EAU), which was put forth by Kazakh President Nursultan 
Nazarbayev. 
  "The Kazakh president seeks to replace the moribund 
structures of the Commonwealth of Independent States with new 
organisations resembling more the European Union than the USSR," 
the NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA newspaper writes. 
  Praising "the reasonable, realistic and vital" idea of 
creating the EAU, the KRASNAYA ZVEZDA daily stresses that this 
initiative "was recently agitating the minds of politicians in 
post-Soviet space". 
  The PRAVDA newspaper shares this appraisal, noting that "the 
euphoria of sovereignties has passed". The ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI 
newspaper forecasts that "the idea of reforming the CIS will be 
amplified at the next Commonwealth summit. 
  Summing up the results of the Kazakh president's visit to 
Moscow, which ended on Wednesday, PRAVDA stresses that the sides 
at the talks "made real headway to bring the two republics 
closer together". 
  Commenting on the results of the Russian-Kazakh summit, the 
KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA newspaper dwells at length on duel 
citizenship which the Kazakh side refused to discuss. According 
to the newspaper, "this question was postponed: the problem of 
Russians in Kazakhstan still remains". 
  "The CIS development will be stable if all the Commonwealth 
members take into account the principles of the Conference on 
Security and Cooperation in Europe to a greater extent," CSCE 
Secretary-General Wilhelm Hoeynck said in an interview with 
KRASNAYA ZVEZDA. 
  He sees the CSCE's task in 1994 "in creating stability in 
the 
region between Vancouver to Vladivostok" and favours the 
development of contacts between the CSCE and the CIS. 
  Newspapers single out, among other topics, the survival of 
Russian science. ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI notes that scientists are at 
the bottom of the list of civil servants for the remuneration of 
their labour. 
  According to NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, this causes the outflow of 
specialists to other spheres of employment, which means the doom 
of fundamental science. "There will be no top-notch specialists 
in Russia by the year 2013," the newspaper cites calculations by 
the institute of social and political research of the Russian 
academy of sciences. 
  "Medical science will not survive, if authorities brush it 
aside," president of the Russian academy of medical sciences 
Valentin Pokrovskiy said in an interview with PRAVDA. He 
substantiates the need for state investments in medical 
fundamental science. According to the scientist, it "takes the 
32nd place out of 35 as to its financing". 
  Speaking of non-payments in industry, Economics Institute 
director Leonid Abalkin claims in his article in NEZAVISMAYA 
GAZETA that "non-payments were provoked by the Finance 
Ministry's actions". 
  The author examines in detail questions of employment and 
investments in the Russian economy. 
  The Russian President's special representative Vitaliy 
Churkin commented in NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on particulars of an 
agreement concluded on Wednesday between Krajina Serbs and 
Croats at the Russian Embassy in Zagreb. 
  According to Churkin, "a new round of talks on economic 
issues between Croats and Krajina Serbs can be arranged" in 
Zagreb in two weeks' time. 
  "Work on reorganising security bodies has been completed. A 
new Federal Counterintelligence Service (FCIS) has been 
established in Russia," FCIS director Sergey Stepashin told 
KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA. He described activities of Russian secret 
services. 
  Lithuania "has no such service as counterintelligence" 
Vytautas Petkevicius, chaiman of the Lithuanian parliament 
committee on national security, said in an interview with 
KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA. 
  According to Petkevicius, the small Lithuanian Army "has not 
even regulations, let alone a military doctrine" and will be 
used for "putting down conflicts". 
  Writing in NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, Sakha (Yakut) President 
Mikhail nikolayev opposed the dumping of the federal treaty 
which has not become a part of the Russian constitution. 
  Regarding the treaty as "a long-term document", Nikolyaev 
calls for "making it an object of every-day policy".

  [Text] In a Wednesday interview for Interfax a high-ranking 
official in the Yeltsin administration assumed that the final 
text of the agreement on accord in Russia will be ready in about 
10 days. He said the working draft of the agreement submitted to 
Boris Yeltsin has been basically approved by the president. 
  Interfax has not received confirmation of the information 
from official sources. At the office of the presidential 
advisor Satarov our reporter was told they do not know "the full 
reaction" of Yeltsin to the working document. 
  The official who was involved in drafting the agreement 
confirmed that one of the main provisions renounces the 
introduction of destabilizing constitutional amendments, in 
particular concerning the procedure and time of presidential 
elections. In keeping with the draft, the organizers of rallies 
and demonstrations shall assume the responsibility for the 
peaceful nature of the actions. The draft also calls for 
refraining from making evaluations of the 1991 attempted coup 
and developments in October 1993 in a manner which hightens 
public confrontation. 
  The official found unrealistic the idea expressed by certain 
creators of the draft to pass a special law to better control 
the observation of the agreement by its sides (the president, 
government, parliament, trade unions, political parties and 
public movements). 
  Still he admitted that the mechanisms provided for by the 
draft rely primarily on the moral capacity of those who are 
going to sign it. Under the draft a permanent conciliatory 
committee will be formed. If the agreement is violated it will 
call for the resignation or dissolution of the person or group 
in question through the media. 
  In the opinion of the administration member, the document 
should be widely discussed after the president approves its 
text. He spoke of the possibility of a debate at a regular 
session of Public Chamber under the president due on April 9. 
He said it would be useful to involve some organizations which 
have gained a reputation for being extremist in the work on the 
agreement.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report under the rubric "Choice `94": "They </F>
Won the Elections"] 
  [Text] According to preliminary data that VECHERNIY 
NOVOSIBIRSK has obtained, elections to the oblast soviet will be 
confirmed as valid in 34 out of 49 electoral districts. 
  In rural districts (there are 24 of them) elections met the 
requirements everywhere; in Novosibirsk, however, only 10 out of 
25 districts qualified. Thus, unless there are some surprises 
(which is extremely improbable), the following administration 
heads will be named deputies to the Novosibirsk Oblast Soviet: 
Kolyvanskiy Rayon--Viktor Nozdryukhin; Moshkovskiy--Aleksandr 
Korchagin; Dovolenskiy--Vitaliy Ugnenko; Kochenevskiy--Grigoriy 
Makarenko; Kuybyshevskiy-- Valeriy Lepeshkin; 
Novosibirskiy--Anatoliy Chastikin; Toguchinskiy-- Nikolay 
Baraulin; Cherepanovskiy--Georgiy Ivashchenko; and Koltsovo 
settlement--Nikolay Krasnikov. Keeping them company are 
Aleksandr Petrov, the chairman of the Kozlovskoye joint-stock 
company (Barabinskiy Rayon); Aleksandr Kudryavtsev, the director 
of the Linev construction materials combine; Nikolay Cherepkov, 
the director of the Iskitimskiy Izvestkovyy Karyer limited 
liability partnership; Anatoliy Khilchenko, executive director 
of the APZT [closely-held joint-stock enterprise] Dzerzhinskoye 
(Karasuk); Oleg Votyakov, the director of the Novomayskoye 
joint-stock enterprise (Krasnozerskiy Rayon); Yuriy Bugakov, 
chairman of the board of the APZT Irmen livestock-breeding plant 
(Ordynskiy Rayon); Valentina Usova, chief engineer of the Suzun 
furniture factory; Gennadiy Naumtsev, deputy chief of the MPMK-2 
[mobile mechanized convoy] in Tatarsk; Aleksandr Bulgakov, the 
head of Novosibirskavtodor; Vitaliy Trunov, the director of the 
Chulyma power grid; Vasiliy Kononov, the director of Kyshta 
secondary school No. 1; Vladimir Karlov, the director of 
vocational-technical school No. 16 (Berdsk); and Viktor 
Kuznetsov, department chief of the Novosibirsk administration of 
the State Committee for Antitrust Policy (Berdsk). Among the 
winners are the current oblast soviet chairman Anatoliy Sychev 
and Vladimir Shleyev, Novosibirsk Oblast administration chief of 
the Federal Treasury of the Russian Federation Ministry of 
Finance. 
  In Novosibirsk, the following heads of rayon administrations 
won in their electoral districts: Dzerzhinskiy--Vladimir 
Krivushkin; Oktyabrskiy--Valeriy Shaposhnikov; and Central--Igor 
Lyuzenkov. Among the winners are two general 
directors--Aleksandr Belosokhov of the chemical concentrates 
plant and Anatoliy Stepanov of the meat combine; Konstantin 
Komarov, the director of the Siberian Analytical Center and the 
rector of the Siberian State Railways Academy; Aleksandr 
Melnikov--another representative of the Novosibirsk chemical 
concentrates plant, group leader in the office of chief 
designer; Aleksandr Plyushkin, chief physician of Pervomayskiy 
Rayon's city hospital No. 9; and Pavel Isayev, senior researcher 
in the Nuclear Physics Institute of the Russian Academy of 
Sciences' Siberian branch.

<F P=106> [Report by Gennadiy Belotserkovskiy under the "Elections" </F>
rubric: "Bureaucrats Become Don Legislators"] 
  [Text] Rostov-na-Donu -- The Rostov Oblast Legislative 
Assembly elections were declared valid, having passed off amid a 
low level of enthusiasm on the part of the electorate, with just 
35 percent turning out to vote. What is more, the elections 
were disrupted in Rostov's two largest districts. So it is that 
the first session of the "Don Parliament" will bring together 
not 45 deputies, as planned, but 43. 
  "The victory of the administration over democracy is 
absolute," Sergey Ivanenko, an eminent political expert from 
Rostov, said in comment on the results. "Two-thirds of the 
deputies are top bureaucrats." 
  I glanced at the lists of "lucky winners." And, indeed, 
there are 10 heads of city and rayon administrations, four 
holding the office of deputy head, and three leaders of 
departments which are subordinate to the oblast administration 
head. There are three chiefs of Internal Affairs 
Administrations -- oblast, city, and rayon. There is one 
banker, one counterintelligence staffer, and the deputy chief of 
a workshop. There are three entrepreneurs, three journalists, 
three kolkhoz chairmen, and three major enterprise directors. 
It is interesting that Kozitsyn, ataman of the Oblast Cossack 
Union of the Don Host, did not appear among the elected -- he 
lost the election, and this is an indication of the degree of 
popularity of the Cossack movement in the Don, which has 
declined in the past year. 
  Of course, there was the inevitable furore. Aleksandr Boyko, 
a native of Rostov and a senior lecturer in law at Rostov 
University, does not believe he was defeated. He told me: "If 
you count up the votes cast in my favor at the 28 polling 
stations, and such documentation is available, then I beat 
Karachentsev, head of the administration of Rostov City's 
Sovetskiy Rayon, by 142 votes. However, the district commission, 
having spent the whole night sitting at the computer to complete 
the simple task of adding up the votes, accorded a winning 
margin of four to him." 
  An official complaint has been lodged, and the matter now 
rests with the Oblast Electoral Commission. But even if it is 
upheld, this will not affect the overall situation. As forecast 
by sociologists, there is no point in expecting a division of 
powers on the Don. The new parliament will simply be another 
cabinet, another tier in the bureaucratic pyramid. And, when a 
session is held, virtually the entire body of the parliament 
could go to the local governor's office for a detailed briefing. 
  Incidentally, Boyko, a qualified lawyer, considers it 
unacceptable in a democratic state for "intermediaries" in the 
form of certain "working groups," set up under administrations 
at various levels to "give technical aid to the electoral 
commissions," to come between the voters and the electoral 
commission. In practice, the lawyer believes, these working 
groups are exceeding their powers by securing an advantage for 
their own chiefs. 
  "In their desire to shield themselves from a truly 
independent legislative power, the bureaucrats have clearly 
overdone it," political commentator Ivanenko believes. "After 
all, by law, two out of five deputies in the Legislative 
Assembly must work on a permanent basis. It is unlikely that 
any one of the newly elected will resolve to leave their top 
jobs in exchange for posts which are far less lucrative, laying 
to rest a civil service career into the bargain. I am convinced 
that this parliament will simply be unable to begin its work. 
Furthermore, the Russian Federation State Duma may adopt a law 
on local organs of power, under which this combination of deputy 
and bureaucratic functions will be forbidden. What then? More 
elections?" 
  So, the Don executive can be congratulated. It has become 
the parliament. The only thing is, will it arrive at the truth 
in debate with itself?

"`Black-Market Business With a Foreign Accent"] 
  [Text] St. Petersburg -- Acting jointly with Finnish 
police officers, a Petersburg special service has neutralized a 
gang consisting of Russian and Finnish citizens. It had 
committed a string of serious crimes, including a murder on 
Finnish territory. 
  In the last year or two reports of this kind have been 
filling the pages of criminal summaries more and more often. 
The criminal world is closely monitoring foreign capital's 
penetration of Russia's northwest border region. There are 
currently 7,285 joint enterprises registered in St. Petersburg 
and Leningrad Oblast. Foreign investment totals 7.5 billion 
rubles. According to information from Sergey Sidorenko, chief 
of the Regional Organized Crime Administration, around 20 
percent of foreign business on St. Petersburg's territory is 
controlled by local criminal structures. Last year 1,576 foreign 
citizens -- tourists, businessmen from joint enterprises, 
diplomatic mission staffers, and students -- fell victim to 
criminal transgressions. 
  A special militia service has been formed in the St. 
Petersburg and Oblast Internal Affairs Main Administration in 
order to ensure foreign subjects' personal security and the 
security of their property. Vladimir Karpankov, this subunit's 
chief, reported that it is responsible for protecting 494 
facilities at which foreign citizens work. Five protection 
enterprises and four security services have been set up jointly 
with German, British, U.S., Belgian, Finnish, and Swedish 
criminal experts. The special service staffers admit themselves 
that foreign businessmen are reluctant to cooperate with local 
law-enforcement organs, preferring to come to an agreement with 
criminal groupings. There is information that some Finnish 
firms, for example, are paying racketeers up to 100,000 markkas 
per month. 
  An increasing number of cases is coming to light where 
foreign businessmen, on coming into contact with the criminal 
world, are being actively involved in breaking Russian law. 
Thus, St. Petersburg criminal experts have halted the activity 
of the "LST-Metall" Russian-Finnish joint enterprise, which 
specialized in the duty-free export of aluminum abroad. 
  Incidentally, the special services note that it is the 
foreign party which most often suffers when Russian laws are 
broken. The St. Petersburg Administration for Combating 
Organized Crime has detected the theft of 2.6 million bottles of 
liquor belonging to the Spanish firm "Codimport International." 
During the investigation it was ascertained that, in order to 
avoid paying taxes and to obtain maximum profit, an entire 
consignment of liquor was not registered at the firm's Moscow 
branch but handed over for resale to Russian "businessmen," who 
swindled their Spanish partners.

Crime Swoop"] 
  [Text] St. Petersburg -- A preventive operation code-named 
"Signal 2," in which personnel of the Internal Affairs 
Directorates of Murmansk, Kaliningrad, Pskov, Smolensk, 
Arkhangelsk and other oblasts of Russia and the Republic of 
Karelia took part, has ended in St. Petersburg City and oblast. 
  A simultaneous investigation of all zones and scenes of 
crime 
-- stations, markets, hotels, warehouses, and parking lots -- 
was carried out for the first time. A 500-strong motorized 
infantry regiment of internal troops and a 300-strong motorized 
militia detachment were involved in the operation. Checks and 
controls on railroads and highways leading to Moscow, Pskov, 
Novgorod, and Murmansk were stepped up. People worked 12-hour 
shifts without leave during the operation. 
  The results in brief are that more than 3,500 crimes were 
detected, including 43 murders, around 300 robberies, and more 
than 200 thefts and cases of taking away of vehicles. A huge 
number of firearms and edged weapons, around 40 kg of drugs, and 
money and valuables worth 718 million rubles and $29,000 were 
seized from criminals. The level of crime halved in St 
Petersburg City and oblast during the two weeks of the operation.

<F P=106> [Report by Yuriy Kokanov: "Army of Officials...Retreating. </F>
But for How Long?"] 
  [Text] In the Smolnyy the ides of March were marked by the 
high-speed transformation of the local executive administrative 
structures. The Government of St. Petersburg has been formed, 
and the administrative and territorial structure of the city has 
been altered. 
  The Government of St. Petersburg, which is headed by 
Anatoliy 
Sobchak, includes 11 top officials, mainly former chairmen of 
City Hall sector committees. 
  From the end of March seven city rayons will vanish at a 
stroke from the map of St. Petersburg. They are being replaced 
by three new, larger ones -- Tsentralnyy, Admiralteyskiy, and 
Kurortnyy. The authorities have a totally convincing case: 
Expenditure on maintaining the rayon-level bureaucracy must be 
reduced. 
  As for the citizens, they have no particular enthusiasm for 
this latest reshaping of administrative structures. The man in 
the street has always been accustomed to our bureaucrats finding 
themselves a job which suits them. People are more worried 
about something else: What is going to happen to the social 
welfare offices, housing offices, militia departments, advice 
centers, and other rayon services to which everyone has become 
accustomed.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Ivan Mashkivskiy, head of Russian </F>
Main Inspectorate for Civil Aviation Flight Safety and deputy 
director of the Air Transport Department, by Ruslan Ignatyev; 
date, place not given: "Stop Press: Was Terrorism Cause of 
A-310 Crash?..."] 
  [Text] Your ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA special correspondent has 
learned that the Air Transport Department has received a copy of 
a tape recording of the crew's conversation during the tragic 
flight. The specialists who decoded the so-called "black boxes" 
at a Paris laboratory allegedly returned to the idea that the 
A-310 crash near the city of Mezhdurechensk was caused by an act 
of terrorism. They have rejected the hypothesis that the 
aircraft depressurized during the flight.... 
  Your ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA correspondent spoke over the 
telephone with Ivan Mashkivskiy, head of the Russian Federation 
Main Inspectorate for Civil Aviation Flight Safety and deputy 
director of the Air Transport Department, who is in charge of 
the technical commission studying the cause of the tragedy, and 
asked him to comment on the information that he has received. 
  [Ignatyev] Ivan Yefremovich, you have evidently already done 
some work to find out the causes and circumstances behind the 
crash and can probably shed some light on the situation. 
  [Mashkivskiy] Our commission has indeed conducted a 
preliminary investigation at the crash site. But we first took 
the engines, some aircraft components, all the computer 
equipment, computers, fragments, and parts of the fuselage to 
Novokuznetsk Airport and laid them out in a definite order on 
the airfield. Specialists carefully inspected everything and 
drew some conclusions. 
  [Ignatyev] Can you confirm that the disaster was caused by 
an act of terrorism? 
  [Mashkivskiy] Let me be blunt and say that we have not found 
confirmation of that. The only thing that I can say now is that 
the aircraft hit the ground in a flying position [v poletnom 
polozhenii]. That is, all the flaps were retracted, the landing 
gear was in the appropriate position, the engines were running 
until the last moment [rabotali do kontsa], and the plane was 
banking at an angle of 30 degrees. We also have other 
information. But it is too early to talk about that. We will 
receive the decoding of the special instruments -- the "black 
boxes" -- in a few days and we will check the information that 
we receive from Paris against our own information and only then 
produce our final findings. In a word, there is still a great 
deal of work to be done to find out the real cause of the 
accident. 
  [Ignatyev] Is any work under way at the scene of the crash? 
  [Mashkivskiy] No. We had to stop all the searches 30 March 
because flooding cut off our route to the crash site. Rescue 
personnel and other services managed to remove the fuselage and 
parts of the aircraft in good time. Relatives of the dead have 
been allowed to visit the scene of the tragedy. They were taken 
there by helicopter. The whole area is strewn with flowers.... 
[Mashkivskiy ends] 
  A civil memorial service for the crew of the A-310 who 
perished in the disaster was held yesterday in Moscow at 
Sheremetyevo Airport. The crew's remains were brought from 
Novokuznetsk. Relatives of the foreign passengers who died in 
the tragedy have flown to Moscow. They have to identify the 
bodies.

  [Text] The spring draft to the ranks of the Russian Army 
is approaching. The creation of a number of military units 
manned by Cossacks, which will be located in Omsk, will be a 
novelty. According to military commissariats' explanations, 
members of public organizations of Cossacks will be drafted 
under their banners, and if there are none of these in the 
areas, citizens who are their direct descendants will be 
drafted. Cossacks will also be drafted on contract as officers, 
warrant officers, sergeants, and soldiers.

<F P=106> [Report by Anatoliy Grachev: "Wasn't Chernobyl Enough?"] </F>
  [Text] Bryansk -- For many years a strictly guarded 
facility existed in the rayon center of Pochep in Bryansk 
Oblast. Nobody there apart from the oblast party committee 
first secretary knew what was behind the barbed wire. Now the 
shroud of secrecy has been lifted and the residents of Pochep 
have found out that chemical weapons are being stored nearby. 
  But it was another discovery that particularly bothered 
them: 
It is planned to build a facility here to destroy the said 
weapons. 
  Local residents posed the reasonable question: "Surely 
Bryansk Oblast, which was contaminated by radiation from 
Chernobyl, should not also become an area for destroying 
chemical weapons?" Signatures are being collected in opposition 
to the plant's construction.

<F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast: Video report on Theoretical </F>
and Experimental Physics Institute's work on safe nuclear 
reactors by Vladimir Polozhentsev, identified by caption] 
  [Excerpts] [Polozhentsev] The problem of safe nuclear power 
stations is a worldwide concern today. In ordinary nuclear 
reactors the chain reaction sets in after the fuel rods have 
been lowered in, and it is controlled automatically by means of 
special absorbers. However, the regulation of this process 
cannot be 100-percent reliable. In the event of a malfunction a 
reactor runaway can occur, which is very difficult to halt. 
  In the nuclear-electric installation proposed by scientists 
at the Theoretical and Experimental Physics Institute the chain 
reaction is triggered by a powerful proton beam directed at a 
beryllium target from which it knocks out neutrons. The same 
physical processes take place, but they can be halted at any 
moment by switching off the electricity, for example. 
  [V.V. Vasilyev, deputy head of a Theoretical and 
Experimental 
Physics Institute laboratory] Given funding and two and a half 
years of work, the installation could be ready for physical 
startup. 
  [Polozhentsev] But funding is a problem at the Institute. 
Because of the low wages, talented staff are leaving for 
commercial ventures. Five billion rubles are needed to complete 
the work on the accelerator. Meanwhile "Mosenergo" is 
threatening to cut off electricity in the near future as a 
result of unpaid electricity bills. [passage omitted] 
  [Polozhentsev] Despite all the problems, Russian nuclear 
physicists are continuing to perfect the linear proton 
accelerator. It will now depend on the government how 
successful their efforts are.

<F P=106> [Report by Iryna Popova: "`I Am Shocked. Even in Somalia I </F>
Did Not See Such Things,' Said Canadian Observer About 
Elections in Crimea"] 
  [Text] More than 60 percent of the electors participated 
in the Crimean elections. It was evident that the Russia bloc 
would win and preliminary results confirm this. While 
communists reportedly received 10 to 12 percent of the vote, the 
Party of Economic Rebirth -- 7 to 8 percent, the Party of Social 
Guarantees and the Union in Support of the Republic of Crimea 
received 3 percent each, the Russia bloc is expected to hit the 
mark of 65 to 70 percent. Although the 14 seats allocated for 
parties will not determine the nature of the Crimean Supreme 
Soviet, representatives of the bloc are the leaders in 
single-seat districts, where elections will have to be repeated. 
Names of winners have already been announced in 10 electoral 
districts. The new professional legislature will be comprised 
of an electrician from a grain elevator, a messenger from a 
small company, a mechanic, and a deputy manager of a television 
center. In two districts (Yalta and Yevpatoriya) the Crimean 
Supreme Soviet elections did not take place at all. Elections 
to the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet took place in all the districts, 
although many electors responded to President Meshkov's 
televised appeal and instead of dropping their ballots into 
ballot boxes, took them home. 
  Pro-Ukrainian organizations, along with the Organization of 
the National Movement of the Crimean Tatars, have issued a 
declaration and held a news conference emphasizing that 
representatives of the Russia bloc and members of electoral 
committees themselves were campaigning right at the polling 
stations, advising the electors what to do. Ihor Banakh, deputy 
chairman of the committee "Crimea With Ukraine" cited a remark 
by Canadian citizen Alexander Shelak, an observer from the 
Ukrainian Congressional Union of America, who had said: "I am 
shocked. Even in Somalia I did not see such things." At any 
rate, after Meshkov, the top official of the Republic of Crimea, 
advised on television to vote for the Russia bloc and ignore the 
Ukrainian elections, after he termed the national quotas the 
Supreme Soviet's mistake and a "departing legislature's deal," 
few things can be considered shocking. 
  Meshkov's concern over the national quotas is quite 
understandable. The results of voting in the Crimean Tatar 
constituency have demonstrated Kurultay's [Tatars' congress] 
convincing victory. According to incomplete reports, some 88 
percent voted for Kurultay candidates which amounts to the 
political death of the Majlis [Tatar council] opponent, the 
National Movement of Crimean Tatars. Kurultay's deputies in the 
Crimean legislature are the only thing casting gloom over the 
festive mood of pro-Russian forces. They will hardly put up 
with this situation, all the more so since Yuriy Meshkov 
outlined his stance in the following way: "There's God, there's 
the nation, and there's the president. This is what determines 
our strategy." That is why the results of the 27 March poll on 
changing Crimea's status and granting more powers to the 
president, not yet announced, will provide guidance for action. 
The Crimean president solemnly promised this to the "Crimean 
people." 
  It is worth pointing out that Yevgeniy Saburov, after 
returning to the Crimea, immediately left for Kiev to meet with 
Leonid Kravchuk. Under the current circumstances, the subject 
of their talks seems very intriguing.

  [Text] Simferopol [no date as received] -- A session of the 
Republic of Crimea's Central Electoral Commission took place on 
31 March. Issues of confirming the results of elections in 
multiseat districts were examined at the sitting. The 
commission's chairman Viktor Alsufyev read out a statement by 
the political council of the "Union in Support of the Republic 
of Crimea" [Soyuz v podderzhku Respubliki Krym] party, in which 
are given -- in the opinion of the statement's authors -- facts 
of violations in the course of the election campaign and the 
elections, in particular the call by Crimean President Yuriy 
Meshkov on the eve of the elections to vote for the "Russia" 
bloc, and also the holding of a poll of Crimean citizens at the 
same time as the elections. 
  In connection with the numerous violations, the political 
council of the Union in Support of the Republic of Crimea is 
demanding that the elections be recognized as invalid and that a 
new time-scale for holding elections be set. It has become 
known that practically all of the autonomy's parties of a 
centrist tendency supported the statement. 
  Having examined the statement, the Central Electoral 
Commission decided to hand over the materials to the judicial 
bodies for examination because, as the resolution notes, "only 
the Republic of Crimea's Supreme Court can recognize the 
elections as invalid." 
  The results of the elections in the multiseat district for 
political parties were examined. According to the election 
results, the Communist Party of Crimea got two seats out of the 
14, the "Russia" bloc 11 seats, and the Party of Economic 
Revival of Crimea one seat. 
  In the opinion of observers, supporters of Crimea's 
President 
Meshkov can reckon on 60 of the 98 seats in the Crimean 
Parliament. 
  Results of the elections in the Crimean Tatar multiseat 
national district were also examined. In all, 76.18 percent or 
102,379 electors of Crimean Tatar nationality took part in the 
voting. Some 90,959 votes were cast for the kurultay of the 
Crimean Tatar people. Thus, the kurultay got all 14 seats. 
Commenting on the results of the voting to a UNIAN 
correspondent, Refat Chubarov, deputy chairman of the majlis of 
the Crimean Tatar people, who is first on the list from the 
kurultay, said: "This is even more than we expected, and I am 
pleased that our people showed wisdom in voting for candidates 
from the kurultay." 
  In a conversation with a UNIAN correspondent on the election 
results in the multiseat district for political parties, 
Volodymyr Shevyev, cochairman of the Party of Economic Revival 
of Crimea, who was confirmed as a deputy from the Party of 
Economic Revival of Crimea by the Central Electoral Commission 
on 31 March, noted: "The people supported the president in the 
elections. I think great prospects are ahead for Crimea if 
there is unity of judicial, legislative, and executive power." 
  The results of the election in single-seat national 
districts 
were also examined at the sitting of the Central Electoral 
Commission.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Gordeyev] </F>
  [Text] Donetsk 31 March, TASS -- As it was expected, the 
first round of elections in Ukraine did not bring even a half of 
deputies to the new parliament. Only 49 out of 450 deputies 
were elected, while the parliament can work if the number of its 
members is no less than 226. The Central Election Committee 
enacted that the second round must be held until 10 April, and 
each election district must establish the date on its own. 
  The elections in Ukraine were held in the atmosphere of 
unprecedented activity. More than 28 million citizens, that is 
almost 75 per cent of all voters took part in the elections. 
  Residents of western Ukraine where the idea of national 
independence has been forged for many years were most active. 
The dream about breaking all ties with "imperial Russia" has 
almost become a religious obsession. That is why almost all 
leaders of many nationalist parties strive to run in that region. 
  The distribution of "colours" of the Ukrainian political 
palette was manifested last Sunday. Only nine out of the 49 
deputies represent various nationalist parties, 12 deputies -- 
the Ukrainian Communist Party, which was registered last 
October, four deputies -- leftist parties-social and agrarian. 
Among the so called "non-party deputies" elected on Sunday, 
there are people, who are not independent politicians -- speaker 
of the current parliament Ivan Plyushch, former prime minister 
Leonid Kuchma, former vice-premiers Viktor Pinzenik and Igor 
Yukhnovskiy. 
  Residents of eastern Ukraine definitely voted for "their own 
colour." For example, in Donetsk and Lugansk regions, 11 
deputies out of 14 will represent Ukrainian Communist Party. 
Moreover, none out of 132 communists running for parliament 
there dropped out. The positions of socialists and agrarians 
are also very strong. 
  No doubt, local referendums and public-opinion polls held in 
the Crimea and in Donbass contributed to political acuteness of 
current election campaign. Despite firm pressure undertaken by 
official Kiev, residents of these regions could openly express 
their opinions on concrete and vital questions. The bulk of 
Crimea's residents confirmed their strive for dual citizenship 
and raised their voices against Kiev's dictate. 
  Almost 90 per cent of residents of Donetsk and Lugansk 
regions did not only protected the right of Russian language to 
exist here, but confirmed their will to see it fixed by the 
Constitution as the second official language along with the 
Ukrainian. 
  Nearly the same percentage of voters supported the immediate 
joining of the Commonwealth of Independent States and the 
necessity of participating in the CIS interparliament assembly. 
  Official Kiev will fail to play down the results of the 
Crimean and Donbass' referendums and to rule them as illegal, 
observers believe. Res dents of the "obstinate regions" who are 
tired of prolonged and senseless struggle with the centre 
expressed their will and deputies and regional authorities now 
have to take it into account.

  [Text] We are moving toward democracy in an evolutionary 
process; this opinion was voiced by Ukrainian Deputies Serhiy 
Holovatyy and Volodymyr Lanovyy at a press conference in Kiev 
today. Serhiy Holovatyy believes that the scenario envisioning a 
vacuum has failed to materialize in spite of the flawed 
electoral law; and it was the people, who actively participated 
in the election, that headed off this scenario. In his opinion, 
after the second-round elections, the new parliament will be 
able to get down to work. However, it must be reform-minded in 
nature to operate successfully. You cannot overcome the crisis 
with an antiquated background, he stressed. Continuing on the 
topic of economic reform, Volodymyr Lanovyy emphasized: I stand 
for uniting all economic concepts that would help transform 
Ukraine into a wealthy state. We have nothing to fight for 
right now. We must unite. At the same time, Volodymyr Lanovyy 
said he was concerned about the political standoff that came to 
a head in the country, as well as the too-politicized election 
process. He thinks that the electorate cast its ballots either 
for far-right or far-left candidates. Only those who will work 
and not just talk should be elected to parliament, he stressed.

  [Text] Kiev -- On 31 March the Central Election Commission 
reported that 801 candidates got through to the runoffs. Of 
these, 371 persons were nominated by the electorate, 254 by 
working collectives and 176 by parties. 
  Among the latter the Communist Party is the leader -- 108 
candidates (27 candidates in Donetsk oblast, 14 in Lugansk 
oblast and eight in Kharkov oblast). 
  Other parties are significantly lagging behind the leader: 
Rukh -- 26 persons; the Ukrainian Republican Party and the 
Socialist Party of Ukraine -- 17 representatives from each; the 
Party of Labor -- three persons; the Congress of Ukrainian 
Nationalists -- two persons; the Democratic Party of Ukraine, 
the Ukrainian Conservative Republican Party and the Christian 
Democratic Party of Ukraine -- one representative from each. 
  However, the Central Electoral Commission pointed out that 
these figures did not reflect the absolute representation of the 
parties because many political party members were nominated 
either by the electorate or by working collectives.

<F P=106> [Report by UKRINFORM correspondent Lev Ryabchikov for TASS] </F>
  [Text] Simferopol 31 March, TASS -- The information working 
group of the national movement of Crimean Tatars send telegrams 
to the presidents of Crimea, Russia and Ukraine, as well as to 
the mass media, labelling the 27 March elcections to the Crimean 
parliament as "an act of outrage against the will of the Crimean 
Tatars" which ensured cooperation of the kurultay-mejlis cohort 
to the parliament. 
  Some 90 per cent of the voters in the Crimean Tatar ethnic 
constituency cast their ballots for candidates from the 
kurultay- mejlis, while the national movement of Crimean Tatars, 
which is in opposition to the kurultay, managed to poll slightly 
above 5 per cent of the votes. The telegram said this outcome 
was prompted by the intensive treatment of the people by means 
of the mass media, numerous violations of the voting procedure, 
overt campaigning for kurultay candidates on the election day, 
which is banned under law. 
  The leaders of the Crimean Tatars' movement assess the 
election results as a plot against Ukraine, Russia and Crimea, 
as well as the Crimean Tatars, the CIS, the world community, the 
truth and justice.

  [Text] Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko has 
warned against a crucial foreign policy review by the new 
parliament. In an interview with INTERFAX-Ukraine about the 
first round of general elections, the minister pointed to a 
polarization of views of the first group of 49 candidates who 
had won parliamentary seats. "A radical shift either way will 
not help consolidate our independence," he said. 
  Zlenko stressed that any crucial policy shift may cause a 
similar change of heart towards Ukraine by the international 
community.

<F P=106> [Article by Andrey Lekant in the "Trouble" column: "The </F>
Situation in Sevastopol Causes Concern, But There Is Still 
`Normal, Russian Spirit' in the Fleet"] 
  [Text] For Crimea's economy, Sevastopol, inseparably 
linked with the Russian Black Sea Fleet, is a focus of acute 
problems. This may have been the reason for the many sharp 
statements made by Mr. Kuznetsov, military adviser to the 
Crimean president, in a conversation with your correspondent. 
The former commander of a Soviet Army corps stationed in 
Crimea, after his unit was placed under Kiev's jurisdiction 
Major General Valeriy Kuznetsov swore allegiance to Ukraine. 
And soon after stating that he will not fight with Russia under 
any circumstances, he was removed from his post. Later, in 
summer 1992, he was elected people's deputy to the former 
composition of the Crimean Supreme Soviet. 
  According to him, the complexity of the Black Sea Fleet's 
position today is primarily related to the fact that as of 1 
September 1993 Ukraine stopped its financing. It is done by 
Russia through Privatbank in Dnepropetrovsk. Meanwhile the 
exchange of rubles for coupons "is proceeding at a robber's 
rate," constituting approximately half the market rate (the 
commercial price of the ruble is 20 to 23 karbovanets). In 
addition, the Black Sea Fleet is charged exorbitant land taxes. 
What is more, "at the highest tax rate, although no land 
assessment has been made." As a result, the fleet does not have 
enough funds even to pay monetary allowances to commissioned and 
warrant officers. 
  For its part, Kiev cannot provide even for its own five or 
six ships (against a hundred or so Russian ones, not counting a 
border guard brigade). In this connection, "Admiral 
Beskaravaynyy, commander of the Ukrainian Navy, proposed to 
Eduard Dmitriyevich Baltin to buy one or several of them." 
  Furthermore, Mr. Kuznetsov expressed concern over the fact 
that since May 1992 Ukraine has substantially built up the land 
component of its Armed Forces in Crimea. At present its 
strength on the peninsula, including construction troops, is 
approximately 50,000 -- "half of what there was in Afghanistan." 
Moreover, many units have been deployed anew: a mechanized 
marine brigade in Feodosiya, and an air-mobile unit in Saki. 
And this given that under the Crimean Constitution and a 
corresponding Ukrainian law, any changes in the disposition and 
strength of armed elements, as well as the formation of new 
units in Crimea, is subject to coordination with Simferopol. 
  According to Mr. Kuznetsov, the Black Sea Fleet is taking no 
retaliatory moves and will not violate the agreements signed. 
In particular there are no plans to create military structures 
under President Meshkov's control. 
  Crimea's presidential adviser is inclined to attribute the 
actions by Kiev politicians to the fact that "they may be afraid 
of the processes that are unfolding in Crimea." The peninsula 
"slowly but surely is drifting toward Russia, without declaring 
its secession from the country. Ukraine will disintegrate by 
itself. It is economically incapable of existing as a state. De 
jure, it exists, but de facto, you can see for yourself. A 
hungry Ukraine and a bubble of nationalism that has burst. 
Nothing else has remained," Mr. Kuznetsov believes. 
  Going back to the problems of Sevastopol, Mr. Kuznetsov said 
that there were two USSR naval schools there. One of them -- 
popularly known as "Holland" -- trained specialists for nuclear 
submarines. The other -- named after Nakhimov -- prepared 
missile and artillery men. Ukraine has seized both schools and 
merged them into one. The "Holland" school, in his estimation, 
costs more than the entire Black Sea Fleet with its land and sea 
components, and all of this multibillion equipment and property 
is in fact falling into disrepair. Meanwhile, this year Ukraine 
is going to enroll a mere 135 cadets in the school, as against 
800 and more previously. 
  Responding to a question about the morale in the Black Sea 
Fleet, the Crimean presidential adviser stated solemnly, "The 
morale in our fleet is normal, Russian. As for the Ukrainian 
Army, there is practically no morale there."

<F P=106> [Report by Mikhail Rutkowski] </F>
  [Excerpts] At the 13th Supreme Soviet session, deputies 
have managed to adopt the basic law of our state -- the new 
Constitution of the Republic of Belarus -- and the electoral 
law. They have also managed to authorize presidential power, 
and adopt legislation on the Constitutional Court. In my 
opinion, however, economic issues have not been resolved. The 
Republic still does not have its own, concrete economic program. 
We are going into the future blindfolded, and looking for a 
shining path in the darkness. 
  The so-called personnel issue, which was addressed by 
Alyaksandr Lukashenka, chairman of the Interim Commission for 
Combating Corruption, proved to be conclusive at the current 
session. Yesterday, the interim commission handed over to the 
deputies a draft resolution on dismissing National Bank Chairman 
Stanislaw Bahdankevich, Deputy Prime Ministers Mikalay Kostsikaw 
and Stanislaw Bryl, Uladzimir Radkevich, chairman of the State 
Committee for External Economic Relations, and Defense Minister 
Pavel Kazlowski. All in all, Alyaksandr Lukashenka accused more 
than 60 state officials. 
  Today, following a debate on miscellaneous matters, the 
discussion on the report delivered by Lukashenka continued. The 
floor was taken by People's Deputies Syarhey Antonchyk, Viktar 
Kuchynskiy, Henadz Lavitskiy, Frants Minko, all of whom were 
members of the interim commission, and as a sign of protest, 
they announced their intention to leave the commission headed by 
Alyaksandr Lukashenka. 
  Later, the floor was taken by Bahdankevich, Bryl, Kostsikaw, 
Radkevich, and Kazlowskiy. They all refuted the accusations 
presented by Alyaksandr Lukashenka. Attorney General Vasil 
Shaladonaw provided a legal assessment. Alyaksandr Lukashenka 
delivered the concluding speech. [passage omitted] This 
concluded the 13th session of the Supreme Soviet.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: compiled by </F>
Nikolay Zherebtsov and Andrey Petrovsky] 
  [Text] Parliament speaker Mechyslaw Hryb has told INTERFAX 
that before 15 April everything will be prepared for nominating 
candidates for presidential elections in Belarus. 
  He said for that day it is planned to approve the schedule 
of 
the procedures associated with the presidential campaign, to 
prepare the lists for collecting signatures of people's deputies 
and citizens in support of different candidates for presidency. 
  On 15 March it is expected to approve a list of expenditures 
for the elections. Referring to so far unconfirmed information, 
Hryb said that the presidential campaign would cost 
approximately 160 Bn Belarusian rubles. 
  He said that everything associated with the elections will 
pass smoothly and openly, without any deviations. Hryb said 
about the intention to invite CIS and foreign observers to 
monitor the campaign. 
  When the president is elected, the state power in the 
Republic will be stronger and the crisis of power will end, said 
Hryb. He believes a clear structure of subordination laid in 
the system of the presidential rule will allow to rule the state 
efficiently through the presidential representatives in 
provinces. 
  IF Note: According to the parliament decision adopted on 30 
March, the elections of the first ever Belarusian president will 
take place on 23 June. 
  The head of the temporary parliamentary commission for 
combating corruption Aleksandr Lukashenko officially said about 
his intention to stand for presidency. 
  The spokesman for the Republic's prime minister Vladimir 
Zametalin has said that Vyacheslav Kebich is expected to make an 
official statement about his intention to run for presidency. 
  The organization of Belarusian Social Democrats and the 
United Democratic party decided to nominate for presidency the 
ex-speaker of the Belrusian parliament Stanislav Shushkevich. 
  The opposition Belarusian People's Front nominates its 
leader 
Zenon Poznyak. The Party of the People's Accord will nominate 
its chairman Gennadiy Karpenko, while the party Belarusian 
Scientific Industrial Congress -- Federal Director of the the 
Gorizont association producing TV-sets -- Aleksandr 
Sanchukovskiy. 
  Still undecided are the parliament speaker Mechyslaw Hryb 
and 
the CIS executive secretary Ivan Korotchenya. 
  Minsk observers name among the main candidates for 
presidency 
Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich, who consistently pursues the 
policy oriented for the economic integration with Russia. 
Staking on the popular idea of a closer union with Russia, 
Kebich, observers believe, has a big advantage over the bloc of 
"national patriots" led by Zenon Poznyak who orients on opposite 
ideas. 
  Aleksandr Lukashenko, who recently accused of dealing with 
mafiosi two vice-premiers, three ministers and some other 
government officials, and also Kebich of patronizing the 
corrupted officials, is also popular among the people for his 
struggle with corruption. 
  With the aim to discredit before the elections his main 
opponent Vyacheslav Kebich, Lukashenko expects to win a victory 
despite the fact that he does not have the structural 
organizations in provinces which could help him during the 
election campaign. 
  Observers believe that if the court where the accused want 
to 
file a suit against Lukashenko, manages to pass a verdict 
against him and prove the innocence of the vice-premiers and 
ministers before the elections, his chances will be slim. 
  An aspect of the presidential campaign, namely: whether a 
person who is prosecuted by court, may be candidate for 
presidency, is the popular talk in the political quarters of 
Minsk. Lukashenko admits that he has no so far economic 
program. In an interview with INTERFAX he said that he could be 
helped by his supporters to draw a program overnight. 
  Stanislav Shushkevich, ex-speaker of the Belarusian 
Parliament, is also among the contenders. The stake on the two 
parties which have their structures in provinces, as well as the 
organization of servicemen, banned in the Republic, will allow 
Shushkevich to collect the necessary 100,000 signatures to stand 
for presidency, forecast the observers.

  [Text] Parliament in Minsk at the end of a session on 
Thursday has failed to adopt any resolution after looking into 
findings by the interim anti-corruption commission. 
  The commission proposed that the Supreme Soviet should 
dismiss a number of government officials on various charges, 
among them -- Vice Premiers Stanislav Bril and Nikolay Kostikov 
and National Bank President Stanislav Bogdankevich. 
  Head of the commission Aleksandr Lukashenko in an interview 
with Interfax pledged his commitment to further investigations 
with "the help and understanding of ordinary people and decent 
members of the Interior Ministry, KGB and prosecutor general's 
office who may want to cooperate with the commission." 
  Nor does he rule out the possibility of cooperating with the 
media because it has a wide spectrum of information. Lukashenko 
raised fears the next session to be held in mid-May could wind 
up his commission.

<F P=106> [Report by RID correspondent Anatoliy Vitkovskiy: "We Need </F>
Socialism With a Human Face"] 
  [Text] This remarkable saying is still favored by the 
majority of Belarusian citizens, however, currently, it has 
acquired a "deeper" sense, because the aforementioned "face," 
according to the opinion of the majority of our citizens, should 
be... private. 
  The scenario looks like this: According to the poll "We and 
Our Time," conducted by the Independent Institute of 
Socioeconomic and Political Research, along with the 
International Center of Support of Entrepreneurship, the 
majority of respondents -- 40.9 percent -- think that socialism 
is the most appropriate social system for Belarus. Capitalism 
is supported by 31.6 percent. At the same time, 52.8 percent 
think that private ownership is economically more efficient. 
Only 29 percent favor social ownership. Some 11.7 percent 
support a rational combination of private and social ownership. 
  Emotions caused by nostalgia for "the best, the most humane 
in the world" will likely dominate people's minds for a long 
time to come. In connection with this, we would like to learn 
what social order our current leaders are building in our state. 
It is high time to clarify this provocative question.

Gazprom has been forced to gradually reduce gas deliveries to 
Belarus beginning 1 April. As a result of the 
Belarusian-Russian talks held on 15 March, the volume of gas 
deliveries to Belarus was restored to the level of 54 million 
cubic meters per day. Since then, however, the Belarusian debt 
to Gazprom has risen to 500 billion rubles, and it continues to 
increase. The Belarusian Government's attempts to collect money 
from Belarusian consumers and pay the debt have so far been 
unsuccessful.

"Struggle Flares Up in Moldova for the 14th Russian Army's 
Legacy." Tiraspol Wants Its Share on a Par With Chisinau"] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] Moldavia [Moldova] has 
instantly reacted to Tiraspol's "legislative initiative." A 
report quickly circulated through ITAR-TASS channels speaks of 
the fact that "Lieutenant General Aleksandr Lebed, commander of 
the 14th Russian Army in the Dniester Region, has ordered his 
soldiers and officers to resolutely cut short, even with the use 
of weapons, any attempts to attack the facilities and personnel 
of the Army." This was allegedly done "in connection with the 
latest increasingly frequent cases of attacks on servicemen and 
threats of violence against them and members of their families 
from armed mafia-like groupings operating with the tacit 
approval of the Dniester Region authorities." 
  Our correspondent was told at the Russian Federation Defense 
Ministry and the main staff of the ground troops that there have 
been no reports coming from the Dniester Region about a 
worsening situation around 14th Army subunits. On the contrary, 
there have been of late no cases of attacks on servicemen or 
Army facilities. As for "cutting short any attempts to attack 
the facilities and personnel of the Army," the servicemen must 
do that in accordance with service regulations, and with the use 
of weapons if need be. Thus, there is nothing new in it. The 
report from Chisinau must have been most probably "timed" to 
coincide with the eighth round of talks between Moldavia and 
Russia. 
  Chisinau continues to insist on a speedy pullout from the 
Dniester Region of 14th Army units. The more radically minded 
politicians in the Moldovan leadership demand that this be done 
before the end of this summer. Moscow maintains that this is 
virtually impossible. It is in order to "press" the Russian 
military into making the decision sooner that Chisinau wants a 
worsening of the situation around the 14th Army units or at 
least a semblance of such a worsening.

  [Text] Chairman of the Moldovan parliament Pyotr Luchinsky 
said that his republic is not considering entry in the EURASIAN 
Union. In an exclusive interview with INTERFAX, he said that the 
Republic is now considering other issues, such as the creation 
of parliamentary structures, the formation of a new government 
and the structure of executive power. 
  As for the proposal of Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev 
to create a EURASIAN Union, in Luchinsky's opinion, the 
implementation of this idea is unlikely under present conditions. 
  Luchinsky believes that it infringes upon the independence 
of 
the new independent states. 
  "Moldova stands for economic cooperation with all countries 
and intends to ratify the agreements within the framework of the 
CIS and the economic union, but we will not create joint 
political and military structures," Luchinsky said.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 31/3/1994 -- Daily ADEVARUL 
comments on a deadline set for 1 April 1994 in the Republic of 
Moldova: Staff's examination with regard to their knowledge of 
the state language, an opportunity to reveal the maneuvers of 
the anti-Romanian quarters aiming at a relapse to the situation 
existing in the defunct USSR, when the official language in the 
republic was Russian. 
  Showing that the previous deadline was 1 January 1994, then 
postponed "to avoid trouble before the 27 February elections," 
the paper writes: "The poll is gone, and its returns known: The 
agrarians hold the majority in the legislative and together with 
the socialists (former communists and also Russian-speakers of 
the `Edinstvo-Unity' movement) they hold two-thirds of all 
deputy seats. Is this why the deadline for the examination is 
still uncertain?" -- the daily wonders. 
  "As a matter of fact, the majority's stand is known. The 
socialists and Russian-speakers made a big fuss, while 
electioneering, about the enforcement of the state language law. 
But they circumvented the content of the law. For, the 
law-makers meant that the examination to be passed only by the 
executives of the state enterprises and institutions and the 
functionaries (of the same state institutions) who get into 
direct touch with the public. It was only they who ought to have 
acquired the least knowledge of Romanian language inside six 
years. 
  "But, in order to be more convincing, to infuriate their own 
electorate, the Russian-speaking leaders threatened that the 
whole population having a different mother-tongue would be fired 
unless it complied with the above-mentioned provision. Too 
preposterous to need further comment. But it is just as true 
that a number of Russians, which is not at all inconsequential, 
hold leading offices with state institutions and they have not 
learned Romanian, hoping for a return to the old rules. For, 
that is what the respective leaders want: The Russian to become 
a state language once more, along with the language of the 
majority population, which they call "`Moldovan.'"

  [Text] Kiev -- Ukrainian Foreign Affairs Minister Anatoliy 
Zlenko on 31 March met Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Andre 
Ouellet who is on an official visit to Ukraine. After the 
negotiations ended, the sides signed "The Agreement Between the 
Government of Ukraine and the Government of Canada on Trade and 
Commerce Relations," "The Declaration on Special Partnership 
Between Ukraine and Canada," "The Declaration on Cooperation 
Between the Government of ukraine and the Government of Canada 
on Implementing the Program of Organizing Environmental 
Management in the River Dnieper's Basin," and "The Agreement on 
Cooperation Between the Canadian Ukrainian Chamber of Commerce 
and the Ukraine's Chamber of Commerce and Industry." 
  Andre Ouellet commented on the event: "The documents signed 
are a significant step along the path of consolidating relations 
between Ukraine and Canada. We attach especial significance to 
economic agreements that have demonstrated that Canadian 
business will be represented on the Ukrainian market. The 
Government of Canada is also ready to assist Ukraine in 
converting its defense enterprises and retraining its military 
personnel." 
  Anatoliy Zlenko stressed that relations between Ukraine and 
Canada were developing consistently, stably, and dynamically. 
The documents signed, he said, "are the beginning of a special 
partnership between the countries, which is the world's new 
phenomenon, and put Ukraine in a position of privilege as well 
as creating conditions for joint actions on the international 
arena."

  [Text] Kiev, 31 March -- Commenting on the results of the 
first round of elections to Ukraine's Supreme Council and 
analyzing the possible influence of the new council on foreign 
policy, Minister of Foreign Affairs Anatoliy Zlenko noted: "One 
would naturally want the future council to be a democratic one. 
I have grounds to believe that various polar forces will be 
represented in it and, on the one hand, this will reflect the 
democratic nature of the council. On the other hand, I think 
that each deputy, and the council as a whole, reflects the 
essence of his people -- the main bearers of power. Therefore, 
both the old and new councils will not be able to radically 
change foreign policy. There are factors that determine the 
future of our independent state, and any kind of radical 
changes in this or that direction will not serve the further 
strengthening of our independence and sovereignty. We have a 
concept of foreign policy, which has been confirmed by Ukraine's 
Supreme Council, but we should all understand that the concept 
is a changeable system, which should adapt in accordance with 
the relevant realities, but not in a radical manner. I admit 
the introduction of adjustments to Ukraine's foreign policy, but 
not radical ones, because such changes could have a negative 
influence on the attitude of the international community to our 
state, and this is then dangerous."

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Gordeyev] </F>
  [Text] Donetsk, 31 March TASS -- Ukraine's major industrial 
area of Donbass (the Donetsk coal-mining basin) prefers speaking 
Russian and joining the Commonwealth of Independent States, 
according to the results of the consultative opinion polls held 
last Sunday in the Donetsk and Lugansk regions. 
  The results published on Thursday indicated that out of 4.5 
million voters casting their ballots in the local plebiscites, 
over 3.6 million would like the Russian language to become that 
of work, record-keeping, education and science in the area, 
mainly populated by ethnic Russians. 
  The same 90 per cent of the voters agreed that the Russian 
language should be granted the status of a second state language 
throughout the Republic, which is to be sealed by the Ukrainian 
Constitution. 
  The overwhelming majority of the voters also spoke in favour 
of Ukraine's signing the CIS charter and joining, as a 
full-fledged member, the economic union and the CIS 
interparliamentary assembly. 
  Thus, Donbass has voiced its opinion. Time will show whether 
it will be taken into consideration by Ukrainian authorities. 
The Republican prosecutor general's office intends to press for 
the resolution by the Donetsk regional council to be declared 
null and void. But even if the court annuls the decisions of 
the two regional councils, what can be done about the opinion 
voiced by one seventh of Ukrainian citizens?

Development of Economic Cooperation Between Ukrainian Oblasts

issued in Kiev on 25 Mar] 
  [Text] In order to expand cooperation between Ukrainian 
oblasts and adjacent border area oblasts of the Russian 
Federation, and to promote the development of their economic 
relations, I resolve as follows: 
  1. Ukraine's Cabinet of Ministers must: 
  -- Prepare, within a month, a draft agreement between the 
Government of Ukraine and the Government of the Russian 
Federation on cooperation between the border area oblasts and 
start negotiations with the Russian Federation on the conclusion 
of this agreement; 
  -- Elaborate, within two months, with the participation of 
Donetsk, Luhansk, Sumy, Kharkiv, and Chernihiv oblast state 
administrations, and adopt normative acts on the legal 
regulation of relations between the aforementioned oblasts and 
border area oblasts of the Russian Federation. 
  2. To grant the following rights to Donetsk, Luhansk, Sumy, 
Kharkiv, and Chernihiv oblasts: 
  -- To participate in establishing rules of administration in 
the border areas with an account of local characteristics; 
  -- To carry out, within the limits of established quotas, 
export-import operations for the needs of the oblasts at 
preferential conditions, which are to be determined by Ukraine's 
Cabinet of Ministers; 
  -- With the participation of corresponding Ukrainian 
ministries, to coordinate with the leadership of oblasts of the 
Russian Federation quotas for free training of specialists in 
educational institutions of the border area oblasts. 
  3. To recommend that Ukraine's National Bank, with the 
participation of corresponding state administrations, promote 
the creation of joint credits and finance institutions with 
various forms of ownership for the purpose of financing programs 
for interoblast cooperation, including investments and credits 
for entrepreneurs.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: Compiled by </F>
Nikolay Zherebtsov and Andrey Petrovskiy; edited by Vladimir 
Shishlin] 
  [Text] Commenting on results of his recent official visit 
to Moscow in an interview with the Kazakh TV and Interfax 
President Nursultan Nazarbayev said that his idea of creating 
the Euroasian Union is in essence "just an idea, not an official 
proposal." He explained that his idea had not been discussed 
with anybody and is a subject for discussions with CIS leaders. 
"We will see how leaders of the Commonwealth countries will 
react to it," Nazarbayev said. IF's note: The Kazakh leader put 
forward the idea at a meeting with Moscow State University 
professors in Moscow on Tuesday and continued the subject on the 
next day during his conversation with Russian mass media 
officials. Nazarbayev proposed to replace the CIS by a new 
union of states with single bodies for coordination of economic 
and military policies and a single currency. He proposed in 
particular to set up a single parliament, a council of defense 
ministers, a single defense complex, an executive committee of 
the union which would be appointed by the heads of the states. 
Nazarbayev also spoke in favor of a single citizenship for the 
Euroasian union residents. He proposed that the Russian 
language be given the official status. The Kazakh president 
categorically opposed associate membership in the proposed 
union. [no begin or end parentheses for IF's note] 
  Observers note that on the eve of his departure from Moscow 
Nazarbayev claimed that he had discussed the union issue with 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin. INTERFAX failed to get 
confirmation of the fact from official sources. 
  A joint communique on results of the talks between 
Nazarbayev 
and Yeltsin says that the sides "expressed readiness to promote 
efficiency of the CIS, in particular, through speeding up the 
formation of the economic union." 
  A high-ranking diplomat in the Russian Foreign Ministry told 
INTERFAX that Nazarbayev's proposal to creat the Euroasian Union 
on the basis of the CIS generates more questions than answers. 
  According to the diplomat, Nazarbayev's idea is 
"interesting." "Not every idea needs to be elaborated. For 
example, it is not clear what would be the result of its 
implementation for the CIS which has just received the status of 
an observer in the U.N.," the diplomat said. "If closer 
relations between two or more states of the CIS frightens other 
countries of the Commonwealth and finally lead to its 
transformation into a purely formal union, perhaps it would not 
be the best option." 
  He said that Russia is interested in the strengthening of 
the 
Commonwealth. "It is necessary to find ways to implement the 
proposals made by the Kazakh president serving this goal," the 
Russian diplomat said. 
  In the opinion of Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy 
Zlenko, 
Nazarbayev's concept needs to be carefully examined. 
  In an interview with Interfax Zlenko noted that for him the 
idea "is not new. People in Ukraine have studied it before." 
"At this stage I think "perhaps, there is something in this 
idea," the minister said [quotation marks, as received]. 
  At the same time, he said that the formation of such a union 
on the territory of the former Soviet Union should not envisage 
the creation of structures which would perform "functions of a 
supernational body or let's say would have the rights of an 
international subject." Zlenko pointed out that "if this union 
is based on structures similar to former ministries and 
departments of the Soviet Union, that is not the best way." 
  Let us remind you that earlier the CIS Executive Secretary 
Ivan Korotchenya called the initiatives of the Kazakh president 
on the creation of the Euroasian Union in an interview with 
Interfax "rather well-thought and exclusively useful and 
correct." Korotchenya believes that Nazarbayev's initiave would 
be put on the agenda of the CIS summit in Moscow on 15 April.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Boris Maynayev] </F>
  [Text] Bishkek, 31 March -- Kirghizia [Kyrgyzstan] has 
become the first Central Asian country allocated funds from the 
UN International Narcotics Control program. 
  Lieutenant Colonel Aleksandr Zelichenko, chairman of the 
State Commission for Narcotics Control, said today that $450,000 
were allocated for the 1994-95 period. They will be used for 
providing equipment for subunits engaged in fighting drug 
trafficking and for training specialists. 
  Zelichenko claimed that international organizations are not 
only giving a fitting assessment of the Kyrghyz antidrug 
services, but have also outlined a number of measures that will 
permit the Republic to become integrated in the worldwide 
struggle against drug dealers. 
  Today this is necessary. Via Gornyy Badakhshan and Kirghizia 
drugs from Afghanistan have started spreading across the CIS 
republics. Via Russia, Afghan opium and marijuana wind up in 
Western Europe. This year Kirghizia will be able to reach the 
Kara-Korum highway via China, which will enable Kirghiz freight 
to get to the coast of the Indian Ocean, into India, Pakistan, 
and other countries of this region. But specialists claim that, 
together with economic advantages, the Republic will become the 
object of drug dealers' close attention. Using the new route, 
they will be able to transport narcotics in both directions -- 
into Asia and into Europe. It is this that is compelling 
Kirghizia's law enforcement bodies to attach special importance 
to stepping up the fight against drug trafficking.

  [Text] Today Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev received 
the members of the commission investigating the circumstances 
leading to the shooting down of an Iranian airplane by Armenia's 
Armed Forces near Khankendi [Stepanakert]. Our correspondent 
Sakit Ochaghly reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Ochaghly] The republic's president, 
Geydar 
Aliyev, said during the meeting that immediately after this 
tragedy that has befallen the Iranian people he sent a letter to 
Iranian President Hashemi-Rafsanjani expressing condolences to 
the families of those who died in the military transport plane 
that was shot down by Armenia's Armed Forces and to all the 
Iranian people. 
  The president also noted that soon after this incident, a 
special meeting was held and the relevant organs were instructed 
to provide the necessary help to Iran in investigating the 
incident. 
  (Aghayi Aminian), head of the delegation and of the Iranian 
Foreign Ministry's legal department, thanked President Geydar 
Aliyev for the warm reception accorded to the delegation and for 
his great concern and interest in the incident. The guest noted 
that they left for the site of the tragedy the day after the 
incident. By that time, the burned bodies in the aircraft had 
been taken to Yerevan. According to information from the 
preliminary investigation and from various other sources, the 
Iranian military transport plane was hit by a missile while at 
considerable height. Of course, such missiles are not produced 
in Nagorno-Karabakh. (Aghayi Aminian) also noted that the 32 
passengers in the plane were coming to Iran to celebrate Nowruz. 
The Iranian guests also admitted the fact that the Armenian 
government, and hence the Armenian Air Force, knew the route of 
the military transport plane, which had taken off from Moscow. 
Considering this, why were they unaware of the flight of the 
peaceful passenger aircraft and shoot it down with a missile? 
  (Aghayi Rizvani), the representative of the Iranian Ministry 
of Defense, and General (Aghayi Yusufi) expressed their opinions 
on the incident. 
  Geydar Aliyev indicated that we are unable to go to the site 
of the incident because Daghlyk-Karabakh [Nagorno-Karabakh] and 
Khankendi are occupied by the Armenian Armed Forces, but we are 
ready to do everything to help the investigation and clear up 
the incident. 
  The president also noted that the tragic killing of Iranian 
citizens en route to their homeland to celebrate their greatest 
holiday is barbaric, and the Iranian state cannot remain 
indifferent to such an incident. 
  [Aliyev] I hope that you, as a state, will raise this issue 
with them [Armenians] in a serious manner. I believe you will 
do that, because first of all, we have no aircraft like that one 
in Azerbaijan. Secondly, it would have been a different story 
had they shot down a plane that was bombing their positions, or 
if a plane -- no matter if it belonged to Azerbaijan, Iran or 
any other country -- while it was attacking Khankendi or any 
other place. But in this case the aircraft was on a peaceful 
mission. They should have tracked its course and movements and 
should have shot at it only after it bombed or strafed them. 
But, when an aircraft is not dropping bombs and is known to be 
carrying passengers there is no reason to shoot at it. Is this 
not a barbaric? [end recording]

<F P=106> ["Text" of interview with Lieutenant General Mamedrafi </F>
Mamedov, Azerbaijan defense minister, by Beshir Sherifov; place 
and date not given--recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [Sherifov] We regularly broadcast the Defense 
Ministry's reports every day. But under existing conditions, it 
would be more interesting to hear about the situation from the 
minister himself. 
  [Mamedov] The situation on our borders is favorable at the 
present time. We steadfastly maintain our positions, regardless 
of the agreement we have reached to implement a cease-fire. 
Meanwhile, we have been taking several measures. A state of 
mobilization has been declared in the country. Troops are being 
instructed and trained at all training centers. We wish to 
establish an army. An army has to be established, regardless of 
whether or not there is a war. A strong country and state must 
have a strong and proper army. We are concerning ourselves every 
hour, every day, and everywhere in the Republic with 
establishing our army, regardless of the continuing war. 
  [Sherifov] Is it not the state that is carrying out the 
work? 
  [Mamedov] Yes, the work is being carried out by the state. 
That is our sacred duty. 
  [Sherifov] Lengthy talks have been held on the 
implementation 
of a cease-fire agreement. You have participated in the talks 
in Moscow in your capacity as defense minister. Furthermore, 
the leaders of Azerbaijan and Armenia have held talks on the 
matter. However, a result has not yet been achieved. Can you 
comment on this matter? 
  [Mamedov] The defense ministers of Azerbaijan, Armenia, and 
Russia signed an agreement on 18 February. Paragraph 3 of that 
agreement said that the Armenians must withdraw their military 
forces as soon as a cease-fire agreement came into effect. 
Exchanges of fire were to be halted at 0000 on 1 March and the 
Armenians were to begin withdrawing their military forces at 
1000 in the morning. We acted accordingly and declared a 
cease-fire at 0000. However, they failed to withdraw their 
military forces at 1000 on 1 March. Russia's deputy defense 
minister arrived in Azerbaijan several days later. He did so 
after visiting Armenia. He informed us of the Armenian view that 
we must also withdraw from the front line. However, Paragraph 3 
says that the Armenians must withdraw and leave our territory. 
They must go to Daghlyk Karabakh. They were not interested in 
withdrawing from our territories. That was not what was 
discussed and agreed upon. 
  [Sherifov] The territory belongs to us. 
  [Mamedov] Yes, the territory belongs to us. To where were we 
expected to withdraw? They must withdraw from our occupied 
territory. To where were we supposed to withdraw? 
Consequently, the talks failed to yield a result. 
  [Sherifov] The Armenians violated the provisions of the 
cease-fire agreement, as they have done in the past. 
  [Mamedov] Yes, that is right. They failed to comply with the 
provisions of that agreement. The chairman of the Armenian 
Supreme Soviet called his counterpart several days later. He 
informed him that he wished to meet him. I was there too. 
However, I did not attend the talks that were held between the 
two officials. Later, I heard everything they said in their 
disclosures. We held talks afterwards. The Armenian officials 
said that they agreed to comply with the agreement. They also 
said that they would move to withdraw from our territory within 
20 days. I wish to reiterate that they said within 20 days. 
  However, the chairman of the Armenian Supreme Soviet 
objected 
several days later. Meanwhile, the representatives of the 
Foreign and Defense Ministries of the two countries were working 
in Moscow. They were trying to find a peaceful way to resolve 
the problem. But that is another matter. The Azerbaijan Armed 
Forces must always serve and defend the homeland, regardless of 
whether a peaceful situation or a state of war exists. That is 
our duty. 
  [Sherifov] Do you mean to say that the process of 
establishing the Army is continuing. 
  [Mamedov] Yes, it is. Whether or not peace is established 
makes no difference. The Republic's Army must be established, 
and I am confident that it will be established. The Armenians 
exploited the situation in the past. They reached cease-fire 
agreements only to reassemble their military forces to launch 
new attacks to occupy our territory. The current situation is 
different. They recently tried to attack several times. 
However, they met with strong resistance and were forced to 
retreat after suffering casualties. [Sherifov] Cease-fire 
agreements were violated many times in the past. An effort was 
made to reach a new agreement each time. Do you have confidence 
in cease-fire agreements? 
  [Mamedov] No, but a cease-fire agreement cannot be ruled out 
completely. The effort made to find a peaceful solution to the 
war cannot be abandoned. Therefore, an objection cannot be 
made. The territories that have been occupied through the use 
of armed force have to be liberated in a similar way. However, 
that objective may also be achieved through a peaceful approach. 
That would be appropriate. We do not wish to exploit the 
opportunities, but that does not apply to the Armenians. 
  [Sherifov] Do you mean to say that they conclude cease-fire 
agreements to gain time? 
  [Mamedov] That is right. That is what they did in the past. 
They exploited every opportunity to gain time to reorganize 
their military forces. However, we are aware of all Armenian 
tactics and do not wish to give them any opportunity. Had all 
the people concerned themselves with the war, we would have 
evicted them from Azerbaijan's territory a long time ago.

  [Text] Baku (March 30) TURAN -- Yesterday by majority of 
votes Milli Majlis voted for preliminary approval of the 
resolution "On the events of 20 January." 
  The Chairman of the session, Rasul Guliyev, said that Milli 
Majlis will discuss the final variant of the resolution on 31 
March at 1200. 
  However, the deputies were against this resolution. 
Prime-Minister, Suret Guseynov, was irritated by the position 
of his opponents and said "I feel sorry because last summer I 
did not hang you at Baku's central square." 
  Deputy Etibar Mamedov addressed to President Aliyev: "You 
and your supporters as well as those who headed Azeri government 
in 1990 bear responsibility for the events of 20 January." 
  Under the resolution, only Moscow, the former leadership of 
Azerbaijan and the Popular Front are responsible for those 
bloody events. But President Aliyev's supporters, which 
actively participated there, are not guilty. 
  "The time will pass and those who will come to power in Baku 
will annul this resolution since it does not serve Azerbaijan's 
interests but the interests of the present authorities", said 
one of the deputies to the speaker of Parliament.

  [Text] Baku (March 31) TURAN -- Today's session of Milli 
Majlis is to discuss socio-economic situation in the Republic. 
  According to independent experts, since January 1994 
Azerbaijan's economy was enveloped by hyperinflation. For three 
months of 1994 the inflation totalled 50-60 per cent, prices 
increased by more than three times. State budget has yet to be 
adopted. 
  At the beginning of March, 1994, Milli Majlis adopted the 
resolution to hear the account of the government. According to 
several sources, the Cabinet is not ready to Parliamentary 
hearings.

  [Text] Tbilisi, 31 MARCH (SNARK)--A group of armed 
policemen headed by the general David Zaikidze, top official of 
Tbilisi police headquarters, rushed into the Georgian parliament 
building this morning. This happened after the deputies 
approved Shota Kviraya as the Internal Minister. A part of 
attackers penetrated the conference hall. Fists were put in 
action, as well as insults heard, addressed to deputies who did 
not follow the opinion of police head appearing against Kviraya. 
  After the incident was calmed down, the parliament 
unanimously qualified this action as an attempted coup and 
created a special commission to investigate the incident. 
  As told SNARK the deputy head of Tbilisi police, Mikhail 
Saladze, who took part in the "assault" of parliament, the 
attackers "were governed in their actions by interests of 
struggle with criminals and strengthening of legal order in 
Tbilisi". "This was the only way to make us be heard", told 
Saladze. 
  The 38-year-old major general Shota Kviraya was nominated by 
the head of Georgia as Internal Minister nearly eight months 
ago. However, due to the emergency state in the republic, the 
parliament only today could approve this nomination of the 
former state-security officer.

  [Text] Tbilisi, 31 March (AFP) -- Hundreds of policemen, 
many armed with automatic weapons, stormed into the Georgian 
parliament Thursday to protest the nomination of a new interior 
minister they claimed was unfit for the job. 
  Meanwhile some 3,000 supporters of the late Georgian 
president Zviad Gamsakhurdia marched down the main avenue of 
Tbilisi in a demonstration marking what would have been the 
former leader's 55th birthday. 
  Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze was in the building 
during the occupation and convinced General David Zaikidze, the 
chief of Tbilisi police who led the occupation, to withdraw his 
men from the parliament, officials said. 
  Zaikidze is a political ally of Shevardnadze and officials 
here declined to speculate on his motivation for the protest, 
which took everyone inside the building, including an AFP 
correspondent, by surprise. 
  Deputies subsequently confirmed Shevardnadze's nomination of 
Shota Kviraya as interior minister and strongly condemned 
Zaikidze's action, Marina Mamaladze, a presidential spokeswoman, 
told AFP. 
  ITAR-TASS news agency quoted one of the policemen who 
stormed 
the building as saying that Kviraya was an "unworthy and 
incompetent man suspected of corruption and mafia links," but 
gave no further details. 
  Kviraya was nominated to the post by Shevardnadze earlier 
this year and the Georgian leader had on several occasions 
called on deputies to approve the appointment. 
  The protest initially sparked fears of an attempted coup 
d'etat, but afterwards more closely resembled one of the many 
personality clashes fueled by confrontation between armed groups 
that have plagued the Georgian capital for nearly three years. 
  The tension was defused after Shevardnadze explained to 
Zaikidze that his behavior was "incorrect" and persuaded him to 
lead his men out of the building. 
  The parliament was later sealed off. 
  Marina Mamaladze told AFP that a special parliamentary 
commission would be convened to study Thursday's events. 
  Meanwhile, the pro-Gamsakhurdia protesters, angered by a 
sharp fall in living standards and at Shevardnadze's moves 
toward closer ties with Russia, shouted calls for "independent 
and free Georgia." 
  There were several tense scuffles during the protest march 
and security forces were absent from the streets but the 
demonstration went off largely peacefully and later dispersed. 
  Armed groups loyal to Gamsakhurdia launched an offensive 
against Georgian government troops in the west of the country 
last autumn following the defeat of Georgian forces in the 
separatist republic of Abkhazia. 
  The pro-Gamsakhurdia rebellion was crushed only after 
Shevardnadze appealed for and received military backing from 
Russia. 
  Gamsakhurdia subsequently committed suicide, according to 
his 
wife.

  [Text] Tbilisi, 1 April (AFP) -- Tbilisi police chief David 
Zaikidze has been sacked, the Interior Ministry said Friday [1 
April], a day after hundreds of his men stormed the Georgian 
Parliament. 
  General Zaikidze, an ally of President Eduard Shevardnadze, 
was sacked late Thursday, the ministry said. 
  Hours earlier hundreds of police, many armed with automatic 
weapons, stormed the parliament building to protest the 
nomination of a new interior minister they charged was unfit for 
the job. 
  Shevardnadze, who was present in the legislature at the time 
of the incident, persuaded Zaikidze to withdraw his men. 
  The police chief then blockaded himself in his office at 
service headquarters, demanding the dismissal of new Interior 
Minister Shota Kviraya, whose nomination was confirmed Thursday. 
  Zaikidze, whose dismissal was ordered by Georgia's military 
court and the Interior and Security Ministries, remained 
barricaded in his office Friday morning.

<F P=106> [Address by Eduard Shevardnadze, Georgian head of state and </F>
chairman of the Supreme Council, to the Supreme Council in 
Tbilisi -- live] 
  [Excerpts] I would like to associate myself with the 
general aspiration and mood and general assessments in 
connection with today's incident. It is very regrettable in any 
case, but especially because it happened today [on third 
anniversary of referendum on Georgia's independence]. It is a 
pity that Georgia has once again made itself infamous. I have 
already been told that various versions of events are being 
transmitted on all radio stations: that the authorities have 
been overthrown; the Supreme Council has been imprisoned; and 
what not. I am saying this not only for the benefit of the 
Supreme Council but for the benefit of the people who 
voluntarily or maybe unintentionally participated in this 
incident. I would not say that this could happen spontaneously. 
I do not think it would be honest if I did not say the 
following: I have certain claims against Shota Kviraia, against 
individual leaders, and the collegium of the ministry. You know 
that the minister had been ill for some time before he met the 
collegium. Then the leadership of the ministry went to the city 
police department and an agreement was reached that everyone 
would do his own job. 
  There may be certain foundations for claims put forward by 
Davit Zekidze and then again, there may not. All this requires 
checking. It may be remarkable by itself when it is alleged 
that an operation has been carried out and big money has been 
taken there, but this requires investigation, this should be 
confirmed. These sort of things are said about other people too. 
  Why am I saying this? Whatever the background, whatever the 
nonconformity, whatever the facts in the possession of the head 
of the police department of the capital city or any other, there 
is no justification for what has happened here. Actually, this 
means the ruining of what has been built for years by the 
1,000-strong collective. 
  Any kind of assessment can be given. If we say that this was 
an attempted coup d'etat -- if the Supreme Council says so -- 
the lawyers will try to substantiate this. There may be a 
different assessment, like an attempt to disperse the Supreme 
Council, as Batoni [Georgian polite form of address] Mikheil 
[not further identified] said. Perhaps an armed raid can better 
explain what has happened. Whatever we call it, it is a 
shameful stain in our history. [passage omitted] 
  There has been quite a lot to reprimand Zekidze as well. I 
think it should be sufficient for the chief of the city police 
to be fired, that the city prosecutor was killed, and nothing 
has been revealed so far. The manager of the tobacco factory 
has been killed and the case has not been revealed so far. 
Hundreds of examples like this can be listed -- a lot of 
kidnapping and the like. But on the other hand, this is a 
collective that will have to implement all edicts, and I am sure 
that the young people who came here today, through being misled 
or with some other excuses -- will accomplish any task given by 
the state. [passage omitted] 
  Notwithstanding all the good I have said about the 
activities 
of the city police and its head, I believe the Supreme Council 
has to pass a very serious resolution and a strict assessment. 
Raiding the Council building is absolutely inadmissible. 
[passage omitted] 
  Certain concern has been expressed over the current tense 
situation on Georgian railways. About six or eight weeks ago I 
met a delegation of engine drivers. The meeting was very good, 
humane, friendly. They are having hard times, like everyone, 
although their salary is five and even six times higher than 
that of a worker of any other sphere. The only thing we have 
managed, the only help we have been able to provide, was this: 
Using some income the railway is getting from transporting 
various goods we were able to purchase foodstuffs that we sold 
for coupons to engine drivers and some other leading 
specialists. This is all the state is capable of doing today. 
  I know the railway people are listening to this and I want 
to 
appeal to them. I want to tell them that to go on strike and 
stop transport today means that famine will begin in Tbilisi, 
famine will begin in Kutaisi. I have told you that wheat is 
being delivered to Georgia. We have overcome the most serious 
crisis, but stopping the railway today means dumping the state 
in even a graver situation than now. 
  There is a similar movement in the Metropolitan [subway]. We 
have to help them with everything the city and the state has, 
but we will not be able to give them what we do not have. 
Therefore, I appeal to them myself and on behalf of the Supreme 
Council to cope with the present hardships and not to desert 
their area of work. 
  I cannot help speaking about a very delicate issue. We 
approved a candidacy of the head of our security service 
yesterday. We put our trust in him. I do not know who declared 
or how it was declared that he was involved in some agency 
network. I would like to appeal to everyone. We should not 
speak of anything of which we are not convinced, of which we 
have not seen with our own eyes, or about which we have not 
received any documents about. He was approved by 149 votes in 
the Supreme Council yesterday. I do not know when and how it 
was said, but please do not commit a sin. I am not addressing 
the Council now, I am addressing those who are listening. The 
same sort of thing is very often said; I mean, they say so much 
money has been spent there. Of course, such things happen, but 
as the people say, the one who does commits one sin and the one 
who blames commits a thousand sins. In a country like ours it 
is not necessary to further aggravate the situation by blaming 
each other in excess. 
  Two deputies have strictly put forward an issue of having an 
agents' network, the people involved in the network examined. 
No one is going to conceal its existence. Every state has it. 
The old authorities had it, and they had it deformed, and this 
service apparently still exists today. It exists in every 
democratic state. While a state exists this will be one of its 
attributes, a source of information. If the Council decides, I 
will not object to it at all. However, one thing should be 
taken into consideration. There must be two or three people 
whom we trust most of all, those who will not take the 
information out into the streets. [passage omitted] Those who 
will be chosen for this task should be the conscience of the 
nation and the people. [passage omitted] If these two or three 
people find something that is essential and causes a certain 
suspicion, we will get down to discussing what to do next. 
[passage omitted] 
  I cannot help expressing my gratitude to every one of you; 
to 
everyone who has given a sound assessment to the incident; to 
everyone who expressed their reproofs towards the head of state 
and other structures, because in all this, one subject was 
guiding, the one that showed that we have to be together in 
ordeals like this and always because we are building one 
country, one state. I cannot imagine anyone here who could be 
against democracy, against constructing a democratic state. We 
are united by national and people's interests. 
  We are reminded of the necessity for unity by the Abkhazian 
tragedy. You know very well that we were ruined by the lack of 
true unity and elements of treachery. We are reminded of the 
issue of unity and togetherness by events that took place in 
Western Georgia. These have been becoming manageable lately and 
will hopefully become history soon. We are reminded of the 
issue and the necessity of unity by the hard days we are living 
in now; I mean, the most difficult social situation, the most 
complicated situation, hardships every family is facing. And if 
we remain together we will be able to manage something, we will 
be able to ease the hard fate of these people and come closer to 
the days when Georgia's territorial integrity is restored. I am 
sure this will happen. Whichever road we choose -- this one or 
that one -- it will lead us to this great aim provided we are 
unified. 
  This does not rule out differences in ideas, heated 
discussions in the Supreme Council. We will sometimes feel 
offended or sorry. We can sometimes feel angry. Someone can 
slam the door. All this is not very good but the Council is 
unified in the main and essential thing. We are together in a 
struggle for one, integrated, democratic, and independent 
Georgia and I would like to thank you for this. Thank you.

Tbilisi on Thursday to mark his birthday and three years of 
Georgian independence. 
  A big crowd had also gathered outside his home in the city 
with demonstrators later staging a march along the central

  [Text] Tbilisi March 31 TASS -- Since an unauthorized rally 
staged by supporters of Georgia's ousted President Zviad 
Gamsakhurdia outside his house in Tbilisi and timed to coincide 
with the 55th birth anniversary of the late ex-president, the 
political and social situation in the Georgian capital has got 
aggravated considerably. 
  A crowd up to one thousand demonstrators marched on Thursday 
along the city's central street, Rustaveli Prospekt, passed the 
parliament building without meeting any resistance from 
law-enforcement bodies. 
  Local observers link the march to today's incident in 
Georgian parliament, when city police chief David Zeikidze and 
his officers tried to force their way into the conference hall 
in order to prevent lawmakers from approving Shota Kviraya as 
Georgian interior minister. 
  Major-General Zeikidze is known to be an implacable foe of 
late Gamsakhurdia and his supporters. He has repeatedly used 
force to disperse unauthorized rallies amd demonstrations in 
support of the ousted president. But this time, feeling 
insulted by the actions of the parliament's and Eduard 
Shevardnadze's guards who kept him off the conference hall, he 
pointedly refrained from breaking up the demonstration. 
  Today's protest action by Gamsakhurdia supporters coincided 
with the 3rd anniversary of the national referendum which 
declared Georgia's sovereignty and thus triggered the collapse 
of the former Soviet Union.

"The Georgian-Abkhaz Conflict"] 
  [Text] Yesterday an enlarged session of the Liberation of 
Abkhazia organization was held in Tbilisi, attended by deputies 
of the Georgian parliament elected from the Abkhaz Autonomous 
Republic, as well as by members of the Abkhaz Government and the 
Georgian cabinet of ministers. The session discussed problems 
related to the situation in the Abkhaz Svanetiya and in the 
Zugdidi region (western Georgia), as well as the convocation and 
holding in the near future of a congress of Abkhazia's Georgian 
population forced to leave the zone of conflict (the congress, 
in the opinion of its organizers, is to proceed under the aegis 
of Liberation of Abkhazia, an organization that has been 
operating in Tbilisi for several months now). The session 
stressed the need to take prompt action for the Georgian side to 
retain control of the high mountain villages in the Kodor Canyon 
that have come under massed artillery bombardment by the Abkhaz 
side. The session criticized the activity of the Georgian 
leadership and the government of the Autonomous Republic of 
Abkhazia (the reference is to the Georgian administration of 
Abkhazia, temporarily based in Tbilisi). It was suggested that 
the government of the Autonomous Republic of Abkhazia work not 
in Tbilisi but in Zugdidi, closer to the temporary location of 
tens of thousands of refugees from Abkhazia. The session also 
heard demands for the resignation of the incumbent government of 
the Abkhaz Autonomous Republic based in Tbilisi. Boris 
Kakubava, Liberation of Abkhazia chairman, noted that in the 
view of the organization's council and deputies of the Georgian 
parliament elected from Abkhazia, Georgia's current Vice Prime 
Minister Tamaz Nadareishvili should combine the post of Georgian 
vice premier with the duties of chairman of the Council of 
Ministers of the Abkhaz Autonomous Republic, which, in the 
opinion of the session participants, will facilitate 
coordination of actions aimed to bring Abkhazia back under 
Georgia's jurisdiction and ensure the return of hundreds of 
thousands of refugees.

  [Text] Tbilisi, 31 March (SNARK) -- Clashes between 
Georgian and Abkhazian detachments are going on at the Kodor 
ravine and at the Kvemo Lata village (Abkhazian Svanetia), 
press-service of the Georgian Defense Department told SNARK. 
Last night positions of Georgian volunteers and frontier guards 
were under the shelling of artillery and military hardware. 
Georgian Defense Department informs of the Abkhazian side 
concentrating the man power and military hardware. 2000 
Abkhazian soldiers are attacking the ravine. 
  The authorities are evacuating civil population. 
  Commenting on the situation existing in Abkhazia Georgian 
Vice- Prime Tamaz Nadareishvili told SNARK "the Kodor ravine is 
the strategically important region. Georgians should prevent 
Abkhazian capturing of the ravine. If the ravine is lost, 
Abkhazians will have the direct access to the border with the 
Northern Caucasus. No need in Russian-Georgian border at the 
Psou River."

  [Text] Tallinn, 30 March -- Head of the 3d department of 
Estonian Defence Forces Headquarters Valdo Reiman told ETA that 
state defence departments intended to call about a thousand 
Estonians to the regular military service this spring. 
  Every year there are about 4,000 conscripts in Estonia and 
they are called to join the Army twice a year, in spring and in 
autumn. 
  Less than three thousand conscripts serve in the Estonian 
Defence Forces, the rest being professionals, volunteers, etc. 
  Only Estonian citizens that have become 19 years old can be 
conscribed to military service. 
  Reiman said that a major problem is constituted by men who 
have Estonian citizenship, but whose knowledge of Estonian is 
poor or who do not speak Estonian at all. He added that these 
people amounted to 10-15 per cent of the defence forces, the 
largest number of them in Viru and Kalevi battalions that are 
located at the north-eastern predominantly Russian-speaking 
region. Head of the Kalev battalion Alar Laneman admitted that 
Russians were mostly good soldiers and the authorities have 
tried to distribute them to the units so that they would be 
forced to speak Estonian to learn the language.

  [Text] Tallinn, 31 Mar, BNS -- Participants in a rally in 
front of the Estonian Foreign Ministry today declared their 
support to Estonia's position at the bilateral negotiations with 
Russia. 
  The rally, called by the Decolonization Initiative Center, 
adopted a written appeal to the ministry in which the 
participants demanded that also retired Russian military left 
Estonia. "From the position adopted by Russia it becomes evident 
that the attempt to leave the retired military in Estonia is to 
be dealt with as a continuing for of expansion rather than a 
humanitarian issue. Our security interests require that the 
Estonian Government abstained from bending to the pressure from 
Russia, but remained firm on its so far position. A compromise 
at the cost of Estonia's national interests must not be 
allowed," the document says. 
  Juri Estam, the leader of the Decolonization Initiative, in 
his address to the meeting was critical of the agreement reached 
between Latvia and Russia. He said Swedish Prime Minister Carl 
Bildt was now trying to convince the naive that the agreement 
signed between Latvia and Russia was a big achievement. "We 
don't think so," Estam said. 
  Estam suggested that Estonia at the talks with Russia should 
set additional conditions from its side rather than back down on 
its earlier position. 
  The head of the Estonian Progressive Party, MP [member of 
parliament] Ants Erm, said it was namely the big number of 
retired Russian military rather than the few thousand active 
service troops still in Estonia that posed a major threat to the 
country's security. He called the retired military a Fifth 
Column, whose presence in Estonia Russia now tries to perpetuate 
by means of written agreements. 
  MP Mart-Olav Niklus said occupation in disguise was still 
continuing in Estonia. It ends only after the last Russian 
soldier leaves the country and weapons are confiscated from 
non-citizens, he said.

  [Text] Tallinn, Mar 31, BNS -- Up to eight tons of oil 
have leaked into a nearby ditch from an oil tank in a former 
Soviet military base on the Viimsi peninsula outside Tallinn. 
  The ditch, measuring about 15 by 3 meters, is covered by a 
10-centimeter layer of oil, a spokesman at the Estonian Ministry 
of Environment said. 
  Work to neutralize the pollution must be started at once, 
because the leakage both directly threatens the soil, as well as 
creates the possibility of a later pollution of the underground 
waters, the spokesman said. 
  Russian military at the base, however, have refused to allow 
local environment officials examine the site, because the base 
has not been turned over to Estonia yet. 
  Officials from the local Viimsi commune government, as well 
as the Harjumaa county authorities have received an answer from 
the military that access to the territory of the base can be 
granted only by the leadership of Russia's Baltic Sea Fleet in 
Kaliningrad. 
  According to information obtained by the Estonian ministry, 
the fuel tanks at the base are no longer in military use, but 
have been leased by Petro-N Ltd., a shareholding company closely 
connected with the company N-Terminaal. 
  Russian military have said they will themselves take care of 
the results of the leakage. "But it remains unclear how much 
time this will take and whether also the polluted soil will be 
removed," the ministry says.

  [Text] Tallinn 31 Mar, BNS -- Estonia at present keeps 
about 20 persons under internment, said the country's Minister 
of Justice, Kaido Kama. He said these persons are being held at 
a former prison facility in Maardu, outside Tallinn. 
  The minister said that most of the interned in Estonia were 
Kurds. He added that this was somewhat surprising, for it is 
evident that also people of many other nationalities are staying 
in the country illegally. "Unlike the illegal residents of many 
other nationalities, the Kurds are not dangerous to society," 
Kama said. 
  He said plans to build an internment camp for illegal 
immigrants at Rummu, a small town to the southwest from Tallinn, 
were standing behind money problems. At least a few dozen 
million kroons would be needed to set up the internment camp, he 
said. 
  Kama told BNS that a small number of illegal residents had 
also been expelled from the country. The minister said this was 
possible only in the cases when the country where the immigrant 
had come from could be clearly proved.

<F P=106> [Article by Sanita Upleja: "New Party Established -- </F>
Political Union of Economists"] 
  [Text] Riga, 20 March -- On Saturday [19 March], a group of 
economists of the Saeima [parliament] faction "Concord for 
Latvia," and their supporters gathered at the founding meeting 
of the Political Union of Economists [TPA]. At the meeting, 
the program and statutes of the newly established party were 
adopted. Edvins Kide, leader of the faction, was elected 
chairman of the board. 
  Founders of the new party are members of the election bloc 
"Concord for Latvia -- Rebirth for Economy," "Union of Latvian 
Farmers," "Union of Fishermen," and the "League of Economy," 
along with representatives of small business. On the part of 
the Saeima faction "Concord for Latvia," the initiators of the 
new party were E. Kide, Jevgenijs Zascerinskis, Vilnis Edvins 
Bresis, Leonards Stass, Janis Lucans, Juris Janeks, and Irena 
Folkmane. As DIENA has already reported, from now on instead of 
one Saeima faction, there will be two independent factions. 
  As the new party leader, E. Kide stated at the meeting that 
the new party, in contrast with the ruling coalition which 
represents the interests of big capital and the economic elite, 
will be situated "in the center of the political spectrum with a 
tendency to the left" and will represent the interests of 
mid-sized and small business. E. Kide declared that in the 
Saeima, TPA wants to represent the middle class, tradespeople, 
and intellectuals. Regarding similar programmatic options and 
their position on the political spectrum, TPA has decided to 
cooperate with the Democratic Party [DP], Democratic Labor 
Party, Latvian Social-Democratic Workers Party [LSDSP], and 
trade unions. Also during the municipal elections, TPA will 
create coalitions with LSDSP and the DP. E. Kide and other 
speakers repeatedly stressed that TPA is an economic party 
created on the basis of a club of economists, and that it stands 
for maintaining state property in strategic branches, social 
security, and equal rights for stateless people in the economy. 
  The TPA program declares that the state president should be 
elected in a popular election and endowed with greater powers, 
and expresses the demand to separate legislative and executing 
power by adopting a law which will not permit individuals to 
serve as deputies and ministers at the same time. TPA 
emphasizes the need to achieve mutual understanding among 
citizens and proposes to issue a declaration of concord for 
society. Regarding the problem of citizenship, TPA declares 
that citizenship should be granted to those people who have 
lived in Latvia for the last 10 years and have a command of the 
Latvian language, though the last condition does not apply to 
elderly people and pensioners. In granting citizenship, 
priority should be given to permanent residents born in Latvia, 
except military personnel of foreign armies and their 
descendants, as well as to family members of Latvian citizens. 
  For those who have been residing in Latvia since 4 May 1990, 
a steady quota system should be implemented for achieving 
Latvian citizenship. TPA rejects double citizenship and demands 
the establishment of a law determining that the state president, 
Saeima deputies, members of the Cabinet of Ministers and other 
high-ranking state officials cannot be citizens of other states. 
  Regarding foreign policy, the TPA is orientated toward a 
balance between East and West, emphasizing that our Eastern 
policy should be constructive rather than based on emotions. 
One of the main tasks of Latvian foreign policy, mentioned in 
the TPA program, is to normalize relations with Russia and the 
CIS. As for the security and sovereignty of Latvia, the main 
conditions for their fortification, in the view of TPA, is 
active work within the framework of the United Nations, CSCE, 
and the Partnership for Peace, as well as joining the European 
Union and the Council of Europe. 
  In its program, TPA condemns centralized power and supports 
extending the role of municipal authorities, which should be 
affirmed in the Constitution. TPA demands that municipal 
authorities be given the right to initiate legislative acts in 
parliament. TPA declares that the number of local government 
electors should be expanded by granting voting rights to all 
permanent residents of Latvia.

<F P=106> [Article by Janis Domburs: "Voldemars Selga Was Shot"] </F>
  [Excerpts] Riga, 16 March -- At 2030 on Tuesday, 15 March, 
on Rusanu street in Riga, businessman Voldemars Selga was killed 
after suffering two gunshot wounds -- chief of the Criminal 
Police of the Latvian Ministry of Interior Affairs, Laimonis 
Liepins, reported yesterday. V. Selga died on his way to the 
hospital, without regaining consciousness. 
  Assistant General Prosecutor Rita Aksenoka added that, 
according to police information, the murder took place at a 
garage where V. Selga kept his car. He was attacked by a lone 
assailant who fired twice. "There was one eyewitness to the 
attack, but it must be taken into account that it was already 
dark, and this may make it difficult to get a precise 
description of the murderer," said R. Aksenoka. 
  V. Selga was chairman of the board of the Latvian 
Reconstruction and Development Bank [LRAB], and the owner of its 
control packet, as well as the owner of several Latvian 
companies and joint-ventures. About a year and a half ago, a 
criminal case was lodged against him for large-scale fraud. On 
25 September 1992, V. Selga was arrested and charged with 
cheating in a deal with the confectionery firm "Uzvara," in a 
deal worth 50 million rubles. [passage omitted] 
  A few hours before his death, Selga had called the 
investigating magistrate. 
  "At around 1800 on Tuesday, Voldemars Selga called me and 
asked when I was going to finish the investigation. He told me 
it has been settled with my administration, although nothing of 
the kind has taken place," Maigurs Strikis, the investigating 
officer of the Ministry of Interior Affairs Investigating 
Department, who is in charge of the case, told us yesterday. 
  As for the question of what is going to happen to the case, 
the investigator replied that apparently it will be closed due 
to the death of the accused. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Sergey Knyazkov: "No One Wanted To Give In. </F>
Serious Battles in Latvian Parliament Over Ratification of 
Agreement on Russian Troop Withdrawal"] 
  [Text] As you know, the Russian and Latvian state 
delegations initialed an agreement 15 March regarding the 
Russian troop withdrawal from this Baltic Republic before 31 
August 1994. However, it will be extremely difficult to ratify 
this agreement in the Latvian parliament. Two of the Saeima's 
eight factions -- the Movement for National Independence and the 
"Fatherland and Freedom" Association, holding 21 out of 100 
seats -- are taking a hard-line stance. 
  Deputies from the "Fatherland and Freedom" faction are 
taking 
the most hard-line stance. They are proposing to poll citizens 
29 May -- the day of the local self-government elections -- and 
find out their view of the demand that the Russian radar at 
Skrunde should cease to operate at the same time as the troop 
withdrawal (and not remain in the Republic for another four 
years' work followed by the 18 months allocated for it to be 
dismantled, as envisaged by the agreement initialed by the 
Russian and Latvian delegations). 
  At first glance, there are more people in the Latvian 
parliament who are in favor of a civilized Russian troop 
withdrawal from the Republic, but the methods they are using in 
an endeavor to win public support evoke at the least perplexity. 
Thus, according to RIA, Ludis Pavilonis, deputy head of the 
Latvian Government office supervising the Russian Army 
withdrawal, speaking on national television, said that the pace 
of the Russian troop withdrawal from Latvia has been appreciably 
stepped up of late. The RIA report also claimed, citing the 
Northwestern Group of Forces [NWGF] Press Center, that, owing to 
the success of the interstate talks and mindful of Latvian 
leaders' wishes, the command of the NWGF has allegedly found it 
possible to hand over to the Latvians by 1 April 1994 the 
military airfields at Tukums, Daugavpils, and Jekabpils, along 
with the Riga and Daugavpils aviation-engineering schools' 
stock. Actually, neither of these reports is accurate. I was 
told by Colonel Golin, head of the NWGF Press Center, that there 
is no question of the pace of the Russian troop withdrawal from 
Latvia being speeded up, nor has the press center made any 
statements regarding actions of goodwill on the part of the NWGF 
command in connection with 1 April, if only because all these 
installations...have already been handed to the Latvians either 
prior to 1 March or during the first few days of March.... 
  At the same time, the Latvian Government backed the package 
of agreements with Russia. As its 29 March statement indicates, 
the cabinet of ministers sees the speediest signing of the 
documents and their ratification by the Saeima as the "only real 
guarantee of the Russian troops being withdrawn from Latvian 
territory by 31 August this year."

  [Text] Riga, Mar 31, BNS -- Latvian lawmakers approved 
rules Thursday [31 March] on the use of the media in local 
election race providing that one candidate from a list is 
entitled for free of charge campaign addresses in state radio

  Radio and television management should tell the audience 
before or after each address who paid for the broadcasting time, 
under the law. 
  The regulations do not refer to coverage of facts in direct 
broadcasts and news programs. 
  In addition, the parliament decided that a day before the 
elections and on the election day radio and TV broadcasts should 
not contain results of opinion polls on the popularity of 
political parties and election alliances. 
  The local government elections are scheduled for May 28.

<F P=106> [Article by Vytautas Zimnickas, chairman of the Lithuanian </F>
Seimas Economic Committee: "Key Tasks"] 
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] Reform practices in other 
countries show that the difficulties Lithuania's population is 
facing today are unavoidable during transitional periods. 
However, a stabilization of production and the declining living 
standards is already noticeable. The government managed to curb 
inflation in late 1993 -- the key problem of the developing 
crisis. 
  Therefore, I dare maintain that it is high time to begin the 
restoration and restructuring of the Lithuanian economy. It is 
very important to strengthen economic entities and orient them 
toward production, create dynamic businesses, and an efficient 
stratum of owners in this stage. 
  Currently, important processes are going on in the country's 
economy. 
  The creation of small- and medium-sized enterprises has 
gathered momentum, and they will undoubtedly have an important 
place in Lithuania's economy. However, it would be incorrect to 
think that the chaotic emergence of small and medium-sized 
businesses alone will make the country's priority industries 
competitive on the world market. Therefore, first of all, the 
government must make its choice, one way or another, concerning 
the "Program for Industrial Restructuring and Changing 
Specialization of Large Enterprises," which the Industry and 
Trade Ministry somehow managed to draft. One must immediately 
say, however, that this long-awaited program is only a 
compilation of theoretical statements. The program lacks a 
clear-cut expression. It is restricted to inarticulate 
theoretical postulates and propaganda. I suppose that this 
program must be promptly specified so as to make clear the 
development of which industries and enterprises will attract 
foreign investments, and which of them will be subject to 
protectionism, if you like. We must decide which strategy to 
follow, although the ways of its implementation may run counter 
to the interests of separate social groups. 
  Speaking about other development programs for separate 
industries, which are being prepared or which have already been 
adopted, it must be noted that all of them are being drafted 
idly, as if fearing their execution and, which is even worse, 
the responsibility of their ruination. Judging by the 
conclusions of the preliminary analysis, one can claim that the 
coordination of the aforementioned programs is insufficient and 
the resources necessary for their implementation are not 
balanced. 
  I fully agree with the prime minister's idea expressed in a 
radio program on 2 March, when he said that ministries must pass 
from the direct management of enterprises over to the creation 
of conditions for their activities. They must primarily support 
exporting enterprises. Finally, programs are necessary for 
ministries themselves to understand clearly what and how they 
are doing. I would like to mention the "National Program for 
the Development of Transportation in the Republic of Lithuania" 
adopted by the government as a positive example. Although I 
cannot agree with all of its principles, this program at least 
clearly outlines the position of the ministry and the government 
on this issue. [passage omitted] 
  Speaking about the recently more heated debates on the tax 
system, I must say that Lithuania has accomplished much in 
restructuring its legal system. The laws on the incomes of 
physical persons, general and individual excise duties, customs 
duties, and market-places have been adopted. However, normative 
documents on taxes are constantly upgraded and amended, which 
evokes rightful reprimands for the lack of stability. The most 
prominent example of irresponsible decisions is the law on the 
VAT, adopted in late December 1993. Although the law has not 
yet come into force, its authors and the government are already 
proposing to amend it. Meanwhile, the same remarks were made 
when discussing this draft law. 
  The current key issue in this sphere is the draft law on the 
principles of the tax system and the coordination of all tax 
laws. 
  The package of tax laws is closely linked with investment, 
which is the essential factor for economic development. 
Privileges for duties on imported resources and export products 
should be one of the key factors for promoting exports and 
foreign investments. The policy of loans, guarantees, 
restrictions, tariffs, and, certainly, national currency should 
serve this purpose. The current perceptible tendency is to 
increase taxes, although the latter must be collected more 
efficiently from those who do not pay them at all or conceal 
part of their incomes. 
  The current most important tasks in economic reform are the 
following: 
  -- To immediately conclude the preparation of, correct, and 
adopt development and restructuring programs for all industries; 
to organize the activities of the Executive Branch strictly in 
line with these programs; 
  -- To set up the State Property Agency; the Seimas 
[parliament] has already submitted its draft resolution on this 
issue; 
  -- To discuss the draft law on stock companies in the Seimas 
as an emergency issue; 
  -- To form a socially oriented market (by way of upgrading 
the tax system, the law on bankruptcies, and so on); 
  -- To speed up privatization for investment coupons and 
immediately pass over to a qualitatively new stage in 
privatization; 
  -- To act more energetically in attracting foreign 
investments; to establish the Foreign Investment Agency and the 
banking system to this end; 
  -- To speed up the creation of the legal basis for taxes and 
other related issues; to adopt the law on the principles of the 
tax system in the first place; 
  -- To normalize the economic and financial situation in 
industry, regulate inflation, and support social groups that are 
its greatest victims; 
  -- To upgrade the structure of management and seek its 
greater efficiency; 
  -- To make key production competitive on the Western market; 
  -- To ensure the preservation of people's residential 
environment while restructuring industry; 
  -- To resolve crime problems that are having a negative 
effect on economic reform and halting foreign investments; 
  -- To prepare a program for the provision of resources 
(particularly in the energy system) by projecting their 
alternative sources; 
  -- To work out a program for the development of tourism; 
  -- To create a common Baltic market, remove customs houses 
between the Baltic states, and facilitate the movement of labor, 
capital, and goods among them.

<F P=106> [Interview with Seimas Economic Committee Chairman Vytautas </F>
Zimnickas by Aldona Svirbutaviciute in Vilnius; date not given: 
"Economic Committee Chairman Does Not Intend To Resign" -- 
questions published in boldface; first paragraph is TIESA 
introduction] 
  [Text] Economy Minister Julius Veselka has resigned. Does 
Seimas [parliament] Economic Committee Chairman Vytautas 
Zimnickas intend to follow his example? The chairman has 
explained this in his interview with TIESA. 
  [Svirbutaviciute] You, as well as Minister J. Veselka, voted 
against the law on litas reliability in the Seimas. Do you also 
intend to resign? 
  [Zimnickas] This law was submitted to the Seimas by the 
government. I think that the Cabinet of Ministers had to be of 
a unanimous opinion. This law was supervised by the Seimas 
Budget and the Finance Committee rather than the Economic 
Committee. Certainly, we also discussed and analyzed it. I may 
have had to resign in line with political etiquette, because my 
opinion differed from that of the government and the Seimas 
majority. In general, resigning is no problem. 
  [Svirbutaviciute] Were there any people in the majority 
[Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party] faction who shared your 
opinion that the litas should not be pegged to any currency? 
  [Zimnickas] I suppose that the position of economists in our 
faction is unanimous. None of us approved of this move, and we 
expressed that by voting against or abstaining. We believed 
that currently there was no immediate necessity to adopt such a 
law. The bank performs its functions entrusted to it with 
success. The litas has become stable against other currencies 
for over half a year. It is backed either by gold reserves or 
other convertible currencies. I know that some people are going 
to appeal this law to the Constitutional Court because it 
contains certain contradictions. 
  [Svirbutaviciute] So, the law has been adopted and it must 
now be enacted. 
  [Zimnickas] Of course. Moreover, I voted for separate 
articles of this law and submitted proposals so as to adopt 
optimal decisions. We will have to enact it. That is that! 
  [Svirbutaviciute] Was it really necessary to adopt this law 
now? 
  [Zimnickas] We began to talk about its advantage and 
necessity when the situation was unstable. Certainly, the law 
was essential last fall. However, the discussion has become 
protracted, while the situation in the bank has stabilized. 
  [Svirbutaviciute] How do you imagine Deputy J. Veselka's 
role 
in the Seimas? 
  [Zimnickas] I think that it will be beneficial for 
Lithuania's economy. I wish an opposition emerged in our 
faction. 
  [Svirbutaviciute] You, as well as J. Veselka, came to the 
Seimas as members of the Forum of Lithuania's Future. Some 
hopes concerning more radical moves in the legislature and the 
Democratic Labor Party faction itself are pinned on J. Veselka's 
return to the Seimas. 
  [Zimnickas] I am for constructive work. There are almost no 
politics in our Economic Committee; nor does the opposition 
submit politically biased proposals. We engage in essential 
discussions and often forget about our party membership. We 
argue about cardinal matters. I am pleased that we work in this 
way. I suppose that J. Veselka will also manage to successfully 
join our work and convey his knowledge and experience for the 
benefit of Lithuania's economy.

  [Text] Russia has no legal and historical grounds to return 
to Lithuania archives, which are at present in the Russian 
Federation, and sees no grounds to form a negotiating commission 
to solve this problem, maintains Nikolay Obertyshev, the 
ambassador of the Russian Federation to Lithuania. 
  Lithuanian Deputy Foreign Minister Albinas Januska, who met 
with the Russian diplomat, regards this step by Russia as a 
political ploy and maintains that such stance of the neighboring 
state is completely unacceptable to Lithuania, as it is contrary 
to the agreement between the governments of Lithuania and Russia 
and to the international archival principle that archives must 
be kept where they are compiled. According to Albinas Januska, 
Lithuania reserves the right to raise the issue of the return of 
the archives in negotiations with Russia.

  [Text] The Lithuanian Seimas [parliament] National 
Security Committee has adopted a decision banning any commercial 
activities at the Ministries of National Defense and the 
Interior, except in cases subject to law. 
  This decision was prompted by the proceedings on the 
purchase 
of arms for the National Defense Ministry from Russia instituted 
by the Lithuanian Prosecutor General's Office. With the 
investigation underway, searches were carried out at the 
apartments of former Defense Minister Audrius Butkevicius and 
other top ministry officials. 
  Vytautas Petkevicius, chairman of the Seimas National 
Security Committee, has stated at a press conference that as 
long as the ministries themselves engage in arms purchases, 
corruption will not be prevented. The National Security 
Committee is working on a draft law under which relevant offices 
will be supplied with arms by a special institution -- the 
Lithuanian Arms Fund.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vytautas Petkevicius, chairman of the </F>
Lithuanian Seimas National Security Committee, by Vladimiras 
Zarovskis under the "Secrets of Special Services" rubric; in 
Vilnius, date not given: "Let's Steal the Blueprint. But What 
Shall We Do with It?"] 
  [Text] Vilnius -- Three years ago Vytautas Petkevicius was 
really being threatened, but he was writing his stories and 
novels. Today Petkevicius is chairman of the Lithuanian Seimas 
National Security Committee, and not just a well-known writer 
and storyteller. Vladimiras Zarovskis, our own correspondent in 
the Lithuanian Republic, talked with Vytautas Petkevicius about 
the KGB archives which have disappeared, a little about spies, 
and a little more about corruption and crime in the Army, and 
about the fact that people must not be deceived. 
  [Zarovskis] Why did you exchange a writer's desk for the 
hectic Seimas and a chairman's uncomfortable chair? 
  [Petkevicius] I was one of the initiators of the Lithuanian 
Democratic Labor Party's transformation into an opposition party 
after March 1990. The party won the elections to the Seimas 18 
months ago only because it was an opposition party. Only I did 
not become a deputy on the party list but won in a single-seat 
electoral district. As regards the National Security Committee, 
the work on it is very interesting for me as a writer. At the 
time of the Khrushchev thaw I wrote the novel "Of Bread, Love, 
and the Rifle," which is a first-person narrative about postwar 
Lithuania. My opponents set about proving that its hero -- who 
was myself -- was an employee of the People's Commissariat for 
Internal Affairs, a Chekist, etc. Therefore I had to prove that 
all this was not so. I won that case even in court. 
  [Zarovskis] Right after March 1990 Lithuanian state security 
became the province of right-wingers. How did they greet you, 
who are very left-wing? 
  [Petkevicius] There was no such service. There were three 
or four scatterbrains, with whom it was impossible to reach 
agreement. National security had been broken up. Previously, 
there had been very modern equipment in Lithuania. It was 
squandered. They deliberately destroyed national security from 
March 1990. Incompetent people who did not understand the 
business were set up as leaders. One was a postgraduate 
dropout, another did not even have secondary education, yet 
another was a specialist in land improvement. Lithuania was 
left without cover, and people descended on it and did what they 
liked. Top-class specialists who had been trained to combat 
foreign currency speculators, terrorists, and spies worked in 
the old Lithuanian SSR [Soviet Socialist Republic] KGB. Little 
by little we are vetting them and inviting them to work. 
  [Zarovskis] Your committee also monitors the Army. 
Lithuanian newspapers write about purchases of Russian arms, 
helicopters, and ships for Lithuania's army through some 
Russian-Lithuanian front firms, which have done great harm to 
the Republic. 
  [Petkevicius] I can refute nothing of what Lithuanian 
newspapers have written about thefts, currency machinations, and 
financial speculation in the Army, the Voluntary Territorial 
Protection Service, and national security. Mass searches of 
people engaged in buying weapons, right up to the former 
minister of territorial protection, were carried out in 
Lithuania recently. The parliament of independent Lithuania has 
worked for three years without adopting a single law on the 
Army, just a decision to create it. The Army itself does not 
even have regulations, let alone a military doctrine. Imagine: 
A person is recruited for the Army under civil legislation. If 
he has sold an assault rifle or a pistol for drink, he cannot be 
punished as a soldier or an officer but only as a civilian who 
has lost a production tool. This is why so many weapons have 
flowed into the criminal world. Moreover, even people with two 
or three convictions have gotten into the power structures, 
particularly the Voluntary Territorial Protection Service. We 
have been forced to start recertification, to collect up the 
rifles and carbines that they were keeping at home, and to 
"test-fire" them. According to the rules, it is necessary to 
have two spent cases from each gun in order to verify, if 
necessary, whether it has been involved in a crime. But even 
this has not been done in the three years that the Army and the 
Voluntary Service have existed, and the number of murders 
involving weapons is growing yearly. 
  The necessary civilian control over servicemen is now being 
introduced. We have to combat irregular relationships, 
thieving, and crime in the Army. It is offensive. I traveled 
around the Republic with a commission, and we received Russian 
Army installations which were clean, generally in order, and had 
been prepared for handover, but our people came along, and two 
months later it was impossible to find anything anymore. 
Everything had been looted and smashed, and even the central 
heating radiators had been taken. Is it really possible to do 
this? We want to call these people to order -- and we will. 
  [Zarovskis] Every army has a so-called likely enemy. Does 
Lithuania? 
  [Petkevicius] Ours is a small state, and we do not intend 
and would not be able to fight anyone. The Lithuanian Army 
already exists, and thousands of people serve in it, and it must 
be disciplined and well armed. But it must be of such a size 
that the people will be able to maintain it. It is needed for 
support and the elimination of some conflicts. Our concept of 
military doctrine is the Swiss one: resistance by the whole 
people. If not with weapons, then through disobedience, etc. 
We can be part of the NATO structure, for a company -- no more 
-- to participate in international actions. Lithuania has 
already subscribed to the NATO "Partnership for Peace" program, 
but that is, rather, a political step. 
  [Zarovskis] What about the archives of the former Lithuanian 
SSR KGB? They could be used both by Russia and by Lithuania 
itself. 
  [Petkevicius] Some of the documents were burned in the inner 
courtyard of the "Lithuanian SSR" KGB, and some were taken away 
to Ulyanovsk and Tomsk. Negotiations for their return have been 
going on for more than a year. I do not believe, however, that 
we will live to see the day. Russia will not give up the 
archives, since the state is interested in keeping its agents in 
any republic of the former USSR, including Lithuania. They will 
not be of any special use to us if they do return. In our 
situation the declassification of these files could have most 
dreadful consequences. In the times of Landsbergis' rule the 
entire people shuddered, particularly the intelligentsia: Rogues 
and adventurers had been admitted to the KGB archives, and they 
had stolen their own files, picked up other people's, and then 
started blackmailing them. Ten sacks of documents were stolen 
in the space of two years, but we have found them. An archives 
administration has been set up on our initiative, and a center 
for the study of genocide and a special library for those who 
wish to acquaint themselves with their own file are being set 
up. Those who wish to can now find out the reason for being in 
disfavor with the government, and we give answers to requests -- 
except, of course, for operational information. It will not be 
possible to find out who "ratted" on them. 
  [Zarovskis] How will I be able to show gratitude to my 
"friend"?... 
  [Petkevicius] In Lithuania everyone was rehabilitated at the 
beginning of the nineties, including those who participated in 
mass executions of Jews. We are now ashamed before the whole 
world. The genocide center must work the same way as the 
de-Nazification army in postwar Germany. This must be tackled 
by jurists and historians, because we have had enough of 
politicians poking about in this dirty business. They must not. 
The use of such archives by politicians for political purposes 
is criminal. In all democratic countries there is a deadline 
for releasing documents, otherwise political vengeance is at 
once followed by human vengeance -- which is ruinous for the 
state and the people. 
  [Zarovskis] Are there many Lithuanian spies abroad -- in CIS 
countries, for example? 
  [Petkevicius] Well, there may be some self-styled spies. 
What is more, I will say that we have no such department as 
intelligence at all. What intelligence can be gotten abroad? 
So we steal some blueprint. What are we going to do with it? 
Enterprises may engage in economic espionage, but even then 
hardly at all.

  [Text] Moscow 31 March, TASS -- "The main goal of the 
agreement on civil accord is to preserve the existing elements 
of civil peace," Russian presidential spokesman Vyacheslav 
Kostikov said. 
  Speaking at a press briefing in Moscow on Thursday, Kostikov 
said that President Boris Yeltsin is studying the text of the 
agreement and has already had talks with the chairmen of both 
houses of the Russian parliament on this matter. 
  "The text of the agreement has no form of a finished formula 
yet and is open to discussion," Kostikov said. He did not rule 
out the possibility of publishing the draft agreement. 
  The spokesman drew the journalists' attention to the 
importance of the mechanism of the implementation of the 
agreement. To this end, a conciliatory commission will be set 
up to act as an arbitrator in disputes between various political 
parties or organisations. "This will be an open commission which 
will work also openly," Kostikov continued. The commission will 
seek to "resolve the disagreements on early stages" and 
"introduce and mold the culture of political compromise in 
society." 
  Speaking about the content of the agreement on civil peace 
and accord, Kostikov noted that it consists of 7.5 pages and is 
divided into several sections -- preamble of a declarative 
character and chapters about the ethnic and regional policies, 
spiritual and moral responsibility and terms of the 
implementation of the agreement. 
  Yeltsin hopes to set the process of signing the agreement in 
motion at the end of April. The number of possible participants 
is about 25, but the agreement will be open to anyone wishing to 
sign it afterwards as well, he said.

  [Text] INTERFAX has received the draft agreement on civil 
accord submitted today to the Federal Assembly chambers' 
Chairmen Ivan Rybkin and Vladimir Shumeyko by Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin. 
  The eight-page draft document consists of six sections. In 
part, the draft document obliges the parties to the agreement to 
refrain from introducing constitutional amendments harmful to 
the situation in society. The parties also commit themselves 
not to initiate any political campaigns in favor of early 
elections to federal bodies not mentioned in the Constitution. 
  The participants in the agreement undertake to refrain from 
using violence to settle any kind of problem. Initiators of 
rallies, manifestations and strikes should assume responsibility 
for the peaceful character of such actions. The parties call 
not to use interpretations of the events of August 1991 and 
September-October 1993 as a pretext for further confrontation. 
  The draft document requires the federation's constituent 
members to refuse to change their constitutional status within 
the next two years. 
  A permanent Economic Conference is to be established in 
order 
to coordinate proposals in the sphere of economic policies for 
the period in which the agreement is valid. In accordance with 
the draft, representatives of the president, the government, the 
Russian Central Bank, the Federation Council, the State Duma, 
major trade unions of workers, commodity producers and 
entrepreneurs will participate in the agreement. 
  In accordance with the document, political parties and 
movements and public organizations must under no circumstances 
establish any armed formations. Any attempts to utilize the 
state power structures for support of political programs and 
demands are to be considered as illegal and immoral. 
  The parties believe that a permanent Conference on Security 
could become an efficient instrument for working out coordinated 
proposals in the sphere of security. The State Duma and the 
Federation Council leaders will be included in the Russian 
Security Council in order to shape coordinated state policies. 
  A conciliation commission composed of representatives of the 
president, the government, the Federal Assembly chambers, the 
State Duma factions and well known public activists and artists 
is to be set up in order to work out a mechanism for 
implementation of the agreement. 
  If the agreement is violated, the Conciliation Commission 
will: 
  -- Make a statement in the media; 
  -- Raise the issue of the exclusion of such a participant 
from the list of signatories; 
  -- Make proposals on political accountability of those 
responsible for violation of the agreement going as far as their 
dismissal. 
  In accordance with the draft, the agreement is to be 
concluded for a two-year term and can be extended with the 
consent of the signatories.

<F P=106> [Interview with Duma President Ivan Rybkin by Andrzey Rybak; </F>
place and date not given: "Cock-Crows"] 
  [Text] [Rybak] The traditional question of the Russian 
intelligentsia is: Who is to blame? Who is responsible for the 
current crisis in Russia? 
  [Rybkin] I believe we are all to be blamed for that, but the 
intelligentsia more than others. Even though it started 
perestroyka, it did not present a concrete program for work. We 
have lost nine years with the search for it -- and we have not 
been successful up to now. Why not? Precisely 70 years ago 
even the Bolshevik economic experts managed to stabilize the 
country within a few months! However, they were all shot later. 
  [Rybak] Today the Duma and the president are calling for 
harmony. Does this mean that the various political forces no 
longer want to blame each other? 
  [Rybkin] It costs enormous time and energy to be constantly 
looking for someone to blame. And we do not have any time 
anymore, we must concentrate on overcoming the profound crisis. 
  [Rybak] How do you want to do that? 
  [Rybkin] We must regain control over the economy. The state 
companies must be controlled by the state again -- just as in 
Germany. The private sector must be expanded and its share in 
the overall product must be increased. The Duma should 
primarily prepare laws that are necessary for overcoming the 
economic crisis. Then we need laws that ensure the development 
of a rule-of-law state in Russia: Laws about citizenship, the 
Constitutional Court, the penal code, the election law. 
  [Rybak] You were the driving force behind the Duma's 
decision on amnesty. If the released extremists, like Aleksandr 
Barkashov or Viktor Anpilov once again strive for confrontation, 
as they are already announcing, would you feel personally 
responsible? 
  [Rybkin] If these people once again stage brawls, fighting, 
and all kinds of Russian gladiator games in the streets, to 
amuse other countries, we, the Duma, the president, and I 
myself, will put these people behind bars again. Then nothing 
will help them anymore. 
  [Rybak] Several Duma deputies recently said that deposing 
the president is their roost important goal. Is the call for 
harmony not also to be seen as an admission of helplessness by 
the opposition? According to the new Constitution, the 
president is backed by the Army, the police... 
  [Rybkin] The acceptance of the Constitution on 12 December 
1993 was a vote by the people for the president. Therefore, I 
consider all calls for the ousting of the president as political 
cock-crows. Now we must sit down together and work, even if 
this may be difficult for many people. However, this is 
expected of us in all towns and villages in Russia. There are 
many people who can just shout and not work. This applies both 
to rightist and leftist fringe groups. 
  [Rybak] When the Supreme Soviet was dissolved on 21 
September 1993, Boris Yeltsin announced early presidential 
elections this year. Will the Duma insist on that? 
  [Rybkin] The Duma has no right to do so. In the 
Constitution it says clearly: The president remains in office 
until the end of his term -- and this is 12 June 1996. 
  [Rybak] In Yeltsin's speech on the state of the nation at 
the end of February new tones were heard -- away from the shock 
therapy, turning toward Greater Russian imperialism. Has 
Yeltsin's policy changed or is all this political tactic? 
  [Rybkin] I believe that the president simply analyzed the 
mood in the society and reacted to it. This is done by any head 
of state. 
  [Rybak] The president's administration uses any opportunity 
to humiliate the Duma. Does this not give rise to feelings of 
revanche among the deputies? 
  [Rybkin] I do not share this opinion. The Duma cooperates 
closely with all structures of the president, with the 
government, and with the Federation Council. Possibly, there 
are a few exceptions, people who have not been able to overcome 
the events of the past months and want to put a fire under the 
president's behind again and again. 
  [Rybak] The politicians speak of harmony, the people are 
suffering. Could mass protests not throw the country into a 
civil war? 
  [Rybkin] This danger exists. However, I believe that our 
appeals have a positive effect. The people are fed up with 
these power struggles at the top. They want social peace. The 
energy that is lost in the power struggles is needed somewhere 
else. Among the people it is said: In Russia so much energy is 
wasted for whistling that the locomotive does not start moving. 
  [Rybak] Will the opposition not make use of this explosive 
situation to grab power? 
  [Rybkin] Parties are founded to come to power. Perhaps this 
time again someone will try to grab control of the helm. 
However, I would not advise anyone to do this, because no 
single party would be able to lead the country out of the crisis. 
  [Rybak] A power struggle has broken out between Moscow and 
the regions. Can this lead to national conflicts? 
  [Rybkin] The center must give up part of its power to the 
regions. It is simply impossible to rule such an enormous 
country centrally. In Germany this is understood very well -- 
the laender have a certain independence. We have 89 regions; 
they should elect their governors themselves. Today the 
governors are often hated, the people break out in a rash when 
they just see them.

<F P=106> [From the "Panorama" program] </F>
  [Excerpts] [Announcer] A briefing was given today in the 
Kremlin by the Russian president's press secretary Vyacheslav 
Kostikov. Among the journalists attending was our commentator 
Yuriy Simenov, who is now with us in the studio. What have you 
to tell us, Yuriy Aleksandrovich? 
  [Simenov] [Passage omitted] We journalists were told that 
the 
president's work schedule for April was packed solid, which says 
much about his capacity for work, but the essence of this 
apparently is that April will be a kind of example of a tactical 
change in the political climate in Russia. 
  [Announcer] What does that mean? 
  [Simenov] In the main this means that the president and his 
administration will head toward cooperation with all 
constructive political forces -- including those of the 
opposition -- with all parties and parliamentary factions and 
the leaders of the chambers. Among other things, the latest 
meeting between the president and the speaker of the State Duma 
has taken place. 
  Among other things, the president presented him with the 
draft agreement on civic peace and accord -- that very document 
being talked about so much today. 
  [Announcer] As you know, an alternative draft agreement on 
civic peace and accord signed by our opposition figures has been 
published in the press. Lapshin, Glazev... 
  [Simenov, interrupting] Questions were also put about this, 
too. They said that the opposition is effectively outstripping 
the situation, officially. You know, in so far as the degree of 
responsibility which the opposition bears is a lot less, the 
attitude was quietly negative, so to speak. At any rate, that 
draft, which was prepared by a large group of experts and 
representatives of various parties and political sections will 
clearly be at the base of public discussion. That draft 
document is about seven and a half pages long. It is being 
handed around now for all the main political forces and figures 
to familiarize themselves with it and, on the whole, it is 
already open for discussion. It is no secret that it may be 
published in the press in the next few days. As for signing it, 
if we take into account possible amendments, it is possible that 
this will be somewhere like the end of April. The draft 
document is aimed at being in operation for about two years -- 
until the next presidential elections, it seems. As to the 
monitoring of its implementation, there are plans to found a 
conciliation commission for the period. 
  [Announcer] Who will be in the conciliation commission? 
  [Simenov] The representatives who sign it. At the first 
stage, representatives of roughly 25 parties, factions, and all 
the political forces and others. 
  [Announcer] And that quite obviously includes the hardline 
opposition? 
  [Simenov] Whoever wants to sign it. It is an open document. 
Specialists on international law know what that means. 
  Now for the second important point -- presidential 
elections. 
In the opinion of the press secretary, a number of newspapers 
have been in a hurry to forecast that Boris Yeltsin will decline 
to take part in the coming presidentials. Well, we were told 
that time and the course of events will show that they should 
not be in a hurry. If the opinion of society and the voters 
will be inclined toward the president putting his candidature 
forward again, then the possibility cannot be ruled out. It 
will be determined by his duty and responsibility to the voters. 
As to other candidates -- Rutskoy and Zhirinovskiy were asked 
about, among others... [pauses] there was a very sharp reaction 
on the part of the press secreatry. I wiil quote him without 
any commentary: He said that Russia deserved better than to 
have people voting for political hooligans and foul-mouths. 
That is how he put it. Tough talk. 
  The next point is that I asked Vyacheslav Kostikov on the 
Russian president's attitude to Nazarbayev's proposal regarding 
the creation of a new Eurasian Union. The answer given was 
rather surprising. Yes, it had been talked about. This was 
confirmed, but Boris Yeltsin is for the time being showing a 
restrained interest in this. He will study it, taking into 
account the opinions of other CIS leaders. This will certainly 
be discussed on 15 April at the summit in Moscow. He is against 
hasty decisions in this matter. Perhaps the idea of a new Union 
and the idea at the basis of the CIS may be combined at some 
stage. 
  The next important point is about the passions raging about 
the recent decision by the government on customs duties. The 
opinion of the president, as heard from the lips of his press 
secretary, is that in principle the pluses from taxing certain 
goods being imported into Russia were well balanced, but the 
possible minuses were badly thought out. We know about the 
minuses and about the views of the mayors of the big cities. 
  This roughly means that the policy of some sort of balanced, 
moderate protectionism in relation to Russian entrepreneurs and 
industry will continue. The idea is correct, but specific 
measures will, clearly, be corrected. However, there is no 
friction whatsoever on this issue between the presidential 
administration and the government. Everything is being sorted 
out quietly. [passage omitted]

Anna Melnikova] 
  [Text] Moscow, 31 Mar -- "Those who are constructing a 
scenario for Boris Yeltsin to leave the political scene in 1996 
are disassociating themselves from the mood in society to ask 
the president to put forward his candidacy in the coming 
elections." This was the opinion expressed by the head of 
state's press secretary, Vyacheslav Kostikov, at today's 
briefing in the Kremlin. 
  Asked about the possibility of Rutskoy or Zhirinovskiy 
coming 
to power, Vyacheslav Kostikov remarked on "the amorality of such 
an alternative" to the president in office. Furthermore, he 
stressed, "the very thought of their coming to power lowers the 
hurdles of political morals in Russia because people with the 
mentality of hooligans and foul-mouths should not become 
presidents of a great power." The head of state's press 
secretary expressed regret at the fact that militant appeals 
made recently and being made today by the persons mentioned 
seemed to pass by those set on seeing Rutskoy or Zhirinovskiy 
become president.

  [Text] The leader of Russia's Liberal Democratic Party 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy believes that to expect concrete actions 
from the Russian cabinet "would be madness." He made this 
statement at a meeting with his voters in the Schelkovsky 
constituency where he was elected to parliament. A party 
spokesman in the Duma has quoted him as saying that "the cabinet 
is not working and is paralyzed, functionaries just care about 
their prosperity." 
  "The State Duma has no real levers to influence this 
government. We are reviewing the situation so that our deputies 
and Duma committees can prepare documents for our future 
government and there would be no need for it to start everything 
from scratch," Zhirinovskiy declared.

<F P=106> [SEGODNYA report: "Liberal Democratic Party of Russia </F>
Chairman Called `Paid Informant'"] 
  [Text] Yesterday, addressing a vast throng of journalists, 
a leader of the "Yabloko" parliamentary bloc took revenge on the 
Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR] faction chief, who had 
earlier publicly accused him of collaborating with the CIA. 
"The reason Vladimir Volfovich [Zhirinovskiy] knows so much 
about who is whose agent and who is not is because he was the 
KGB's paid informant and had access to secret documents," Mr. 
Lukin said. "As for me, indeed -- sooner or later one has to 
own up, after all -- I sometimes do hand important information 
over to the U.S. secret services. For instance, recently I 
passed accurate information about the state of Vladimir 
Volfovich's health. So now the CIA knows for sure what all 
others can only guess."

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Tamara Zamyatina and </F>
Anna Melnikova] 
  [Text] Moscow, 31 March -- "The investigation into the case 
of the `versions' of the coup d'etat has thrown up the three 
people who, technically speaking, were the perpetrators of the 
provocation," Russian Presidential Press Secretary Vyacheslav 
Kostikov said at today's briefing in the Kremlin; not to mention 
the fact that the name of the person behind "version No. 1" is 
already known to the public, he recalled, meaning the journalist 
Gleb Pavlovskiy. "The question now is whether there are clients 
behind these people, something the investigation will now 
reveal," Vyacheslav Kostikov said. 
  Replying to a question as to who would benefit from this 
provocation, the press secretary emphasized that neither the 
president nor his team "had gained any dividends from this 
sensational story, which is testimony to the lack of any 
interest on their part in this petty game." 
  In Vyacheslav Kostikov's opinion, those who were interested 
in this provocation are those political forces who have been 
striving "to sound out the level of stability in society and the 
degree of the president's staying-power." He believes that on 
both these criteria, "the result has proved positive. Even the 
extremist political forces have not used the provocation to make 
statements, and the president did not interrupt his holiday, 
although a year ago he would surely have got into an aircraft 
and flown to Moscow." 
  So, Vyacheslav Kostikov concluded, this impartial story has 
nevertheless demonstrated a definite "level of civic accord in 
society." At the same time, the president's press secretary did 
not argue with journalists over the fact that the publication of 
the "versions" of the coup reflected a degree of indifference on 
the part of society to political scandals on the Olympus of 
power.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS commentator Tamara Zamyatina] </F>
  [Text] Moscow 31 March, TASS -- Practical work to create 
Russia's Choice Party begins as of today. Yegor Gaydar, leader 
of Russia's Choice faction in parliament, said in an exclusive 
interview to ITAR-TASS. 
  The main directions of the programme of Russia's Choice 
Party 
have been defined, Gaydar said. He described it as the 
programme for the next stage of Russian reform. 
  Gaydar said the main purpose of Russia's Choice Party is to 
pass on from weak market mechanisms that have just begun to 
function to a steady market system based on private property. 
  Gaydar believes Russia now has two main strategic problems: 
The creation of reliable guarantees for property and the easing 
of the tax policy. He said the simplest truth which the party 
wants compatriots to understand is that the cutting of state 
expenditures is the only way to cut taxes. 
  The leader of Russia's Choice Party is aware that it will be 
very difficult to enlist public support for the implementation 
of what is planned. He has confidence in the interests of 
skilled workers in the increase of capital investment in 
production and of the number of well-paid jobs. The 
intelligentsia is interested in the preservation of democracy in 
Russia, and business people are interested in long-term 
prospects for the activity to form private economy, Gaydar said. 
  He said Russia's Choice Party will have fixed membership, 
broad freedom in debating tasks and rigid discipline in 
fulfilling decisions.

<F P=106> [Interview with Andrey Oligov, Russian Federation Main </F>
Protection Directorate (MPD) official, by Rodion Morozov in the 
"Hello" column; place and date not given: "Vitruk Puzzles the 
MPD"] 
  [Text] Constitutional Court acting chairman Nikolay Vitruk 
told a press conference: The Main Protection Directorate [MPD] 
needs reorganization. He suggested that it ill suits the MPD to 
engage in operational activity and provide material supplies and 
everyday services. OBSHCHAYA GAZETA's correspondent Rodion 
Morozov phoned Andrey Oligov, an MPD representative. 
  [Morozov] How far does MPD jurisdiction extend? 
  [Oligov] Briefly, we are responsible for ensuring the 
security of the president's residence -- the Kremlin (MPD chief 
Lieutenant General Mikhail Barsukov is also Kremlin commandant), 
the president himself, and also a specially defined circle of 
state officials. The MPD also includes the traffic 
[komendantskaya] service, the administrative service, and the 
medical service. The MPD's aggregate strength, including the 
presidential regiment, is approximately 6,000. To compare: In 
the United States the security service numbers up to 33,000 
people. 
  [Morozov] How is the range of persons needing your 
"services" established? 
  [Oligov] The list of these people is prepared in accordance 
with a presidential edict. 
  [Morozov] Are members of the Constitutional Court among 
them? 
  [Oligov] In the past, we also ensured their protection. At 
the same time, certain measures were undertaken to minimize 
threats with respect to the justices: and there were such 
threats. Who ensures the security of the constitutional 
justices, I do not know, but it's not us. In its time the 
Russian Federation Supreme Soviet's Committee on Defense and 
Security drafted a Russian Federation law on state protection of 
Russian legislative and executive power bodies and top state 
officials. It was envisioned that protection of all the three 
branches of power will be entrusted to a single body -- the Main 
Protection Directorate. And then, organized with it should be a 
presidential security department, an executive security 
department, a legislative security department.... But the law 
was never adopted.... 
  [Morozov] How would you respond to the "charge" of engaging 
in operational activity? 
  [Oligov] The operations department has always been organic 
to the MPD; and this is justified. The law on operational and 
investigative activity also extends to the MPD. Otherwise, how, 
without a corresponding operational apparatus, can we possibly 
monitor information about threats with respect to government 
officials? 
  [Morozov] And still, how extensive are the powers of your 
operations department? Do its officers have the right to tap 
somebody's telephone or monitor his apartment or detain a 
suspect? 
  [Oligov] No. If we pursue a plan involving terrorist 
intentions, we do this in "linkage" with the Prosecutor's Office. 
  [Morozov] What about the "provision of material supplies and 
everyday services"? 
  [Oligov] Here, honestly, I find it hard to understand 
Vitruk. The MPD is tasked to maintain order at the 
[presidential] residence. To this end it is necessary to have 
an administrative unit as part of it. There is a team of 
construction workers, naturally civilians, who engage in 
maintenance and modernization of particular buildings and 
premises. Whatever else was meant, I cannot even imagine.

  [Text] In the past three months the government has not done 
anything that could be described as reform. However, during 
this time nothing bad was done, apart from the imposition of 
customs duties. This was stated today by former Finance 
Minister Boris Fedorov. 
  Fedorov does not intend to join the opposition to the 
government and will act in support of the submitted draft 
budget, he stated at press conference. 
  Asked about his attitude to the idea of Kazakhstani 
President 
Nazarbayev about the creation of a Euro-Asian Union with a 
single currency, Fedorov said that he supports that kind of 
proposal if the integration will be of the Western Europe type 
where a supranational currency, the ECU, is current together 
with national currencies.

<F P=106> [Interview with former Russian Finance Minister Boris </F>
Fedorov by Andrzej Rybak; place and date not given: "In July 
Things Will Get Going"] 
  [Text] [Rybak] There are rumors about a coup in Moscow. 
President Yeltsin is shaken. Now he wants to slow down economic 
reforms. What now? 
  [Fedorov] How can Yeltsin slow down something that has long 
come to a halt? The last reform efforts go back to November. 
The government has been passive for months. The only 
consolation: This way they cannot do anything wrong. 
  [Rybak] Prime Minister Chernomyrdin has signed the 1994 
draft budget. The deficit is 62.4 trillion rubles (some 62 
billion German marks). A catastrophe for Russia? 
  [Fedorov] The draft is quite tough, but it is not realistic. 
Earnings have been greatly overestimated. Before I resigned, we 
were estimating earnings at 90 trillion rubles. Today, the 
government is talking of 120 trillion. This is just palliation. 
  [Rybak] Deputy Prime Minister Zaveryukha has demanded 
thousands of billions of rubles for agriculture. The 
military-industrial complex demands public orders. How can 
Chernomyrdin cope with this pressure? 
  [Fedorov] He has to try. We all know that once the deficit 
reaches the 100-trillion ruble mark, a collapse cannot be 
prevented. Hyperinflation will ruin the economy. 
  [Rybak] You have been predicting this since your resignation 
last fall. But inflation is no higher today than it was then. 
Are you a malicious pessimist? 
  [Fedorov] The promised funds still have not flown into the 
economy. I do not expect inflation to rise to 35 percent per 
month before July. 
  [Rybak] What is going to happen then? 
  [Fedorov] No one can turn their back on our reform process 
completely. No one wants to close down the 2,000 new banks, 180 
stock exchanges, or 1,000 insurance companies. But we will lose 
a lot of time. 
  [Rybak] Why is Yeltsin not applying the emergency brake 
immediately? 
  [Fedorov] Because Yeltsin is not sure himself who has the 
best solutions. He wants to give the left-wing directors one 
last chance to try their way of state planning. Only when they 
fail with their centrally controlled economy will Yeltsin step 
in, saying: Now you see what you have done. 
  [Rybak] The government now wants to increase the use of 
nonmonetary methods of economic control.... 
  [Fedorov] What is that? I do not know such a thing. 
Perhaps such a discovery will get the government the Nobel 
Prize. But, seriously: The government should work out a 
uniform course and stick to it. 
  [Rybak] Your policy of shock therapy is said to have brought 
misery to entire groups of the population. Is this blame 
justified? 
  [Fedorov] Real average incomes increased by 10 percent in 
1993. Per capita food consumption also went up. The ruble has 
become a normal currency again. I still get letters from all 
over the country. People say that for the first time they know 
what full shelves in shops are. 
  [Rybak] Forty percent of the population live in poverty. 
You did not succeed in establishing a social network. 
  [Fedorov] For inflation relations, public social expenditure 
has not gone down, but I admit, assistance often went to the 
wrong people. We will have to create a new distribution 
network, pay social benefits also in kind. 
  [Rybak] You are warning against creating a ruble zone with 
Belarus. Why? 
  [Fedorov] You cannot introduce our currency in a foreign 
country. 
  [Rybak] Would economic integration not be beneficial to 
everyone? Two-thirds of the fall in production in Russia goes 
back to the collapse of relations with the former Soviet 
republics. 
  [Fedorov] Real integration begins with a number of political 
decisions. If two countries prefer a different economic course, 
have different tax laws and a different monetary policy, 
introducing a common currency would simply be stupid. 
  [Rybak] You are chairman of the parliamentary commission for 
central bank and credit policy. What do you want to achieve? 
  [Fedorov] The Central Bank and its president, Victor 
Gerashchenko, are largely to blame for the bad economic 
situation. The Central Bank's credit policy has been 
catastrophic and keeps stimulating inflation. We have to put an 
end to it. Gerashchenko is not an economic expert nor is he a 
banker. He does not believe in money.

  The spokesman explained that "loss-making mines will be 
gradually closing down with due regard for the social and human 
factors." According to him, the so-called "miners' problem," 
which is so acute at the moment, stems from the bygone economic 
system which has become completely obsolete. Kostikov also 
reported that President Yeltsin intended to meet the government 
for talks on this issue.

  [Text] An amount equal to 50 Bn [billion] rubles has been 
made available Thursday for the urgent needs of the coal mining 
industry, Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Shokhin told 12 
pickets outside the government headquarters. Another 60 Bn will 
be transferred Friday and in April 300 Bn rubles will be made 
available to the industry every week from state funds. 
  Shokhin emphasized that these payments were made possible by 
predictions of stable revenue next month. There are no such 
predictions for subsequent months and so such a timetable could 
not be outlined. "We don't wish to make promises on which we 
cannot deliver," Shokhin said. 
  He added that he had been appointed Thursday to chair the 
inter-sectoral commission on socioeconomic problems of the coal 
mining communities (this position had once been occupied by 
Yegor Gaydar -- IF) and intended to give much attention to this 
work. 
  Shokhin and senior officials of numerous Russian ministries 
will have a meeting with 500 miners representing various 
communities who picketed the White House on 30 and 31 March. 
Shokhin will also tell them about the steps the government is 
taking to stabilize the coal mining industry. 
  "Local developments will depend on the miners' response to 
these proposals," Vitaliy Budko, chairman of the Russian Coal 
Mining Industry Trade Union, told Interfax following the meeting 
with Shokhin.

  [Text] Russia's Agriculture and Food Minister Viktor 
Khlystun has disclosed that the cabinet had not yet discussed 
the possibility of revising the new custom tariffs imposed as of 
15 March on food and other products, however, debates could 
start in the next few days. Meeting the press in Moscow on 
Thursday, he spoke in favor of preserving the new tariffs on 
food as a means to create a civilized market and safeguard the 
interests of domestic commodity producers. 
  He reported that the cabinet had sent 1 trillion rubles to 
farms for the spring sowing and would provide more credits as of 
early April. This year's state allocations for agriculture will 
total 5 trillion rubles. Khlystun argued that since funds for 
agriculture had been set aside "very late," there had been 
delays with the acquisition of spare parts, fuel and lubricants, 
and pesticides. "The situation regarding sowing is alarming but 
not desperate," the minister said.

"Baykonur No Longer a Bone of Contention. Russia Leases Space 
Launch Facility for 20 Years"] 
  [Text] After the collapse of the USSR, Baykonur suddenly 
became a "bone of contention," a "disputed issue" between Russia 
and Kazakhstan. This immense and extremely complicated complex, 
which occupies tens of thousands of hectares and has 12 launch 
pads, as before, embodies the cutting edge of scientific and 
technical progress. Who would have thought, 40 years ago, when 
they were selecting the site of the "harbor of the Universe," 
that in time the space launch facility would end up on the 
territory of another state? 
  Baykonur was built entirely by the Soviet Union, which 
invested immense material funds in it (and the lion's share came 
from Russia). Many of our present difficulties could have been 
avoided if the separation of the USSR into individual states had 
proceeded, as it were, more smoothly, taking into account the 
complex problems and mutual interests, and if issues of 
fundamental significance for Russia (including Baykonur) had 
been resolved in a calm situation, enlisting experts, on the 
basis of in-depth preliminary development. 
  But history had its own ideas. After the collapse of the 
USSR difficult times befell the space launch facility. The 
ambiguity of its status, the general confusion, the rupture of 
economic ties, the sharp reduction of financing under conditions 
of the severe crisis being experienced by Russia--all this 
placed Baykonur on the verge of ruin. Buildings and roads are 
being destroyed, the spacious installation and testing 
facilities are in need of repair... Not so long ago there were 
100,000 people living in Leninsk--the capital of the space 
launch facility--and today there are no more than 60. 
  It is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain the 
discipline so necessary in the space center. Recently a fire 
was reported in the assembly-testing facility, which previously 
would have been quite impossible to imagine. But, still, more 
than 20 planned launches were carried out from Baykonur last 
year. But this required immense efforts... 
  At the same time Kazakhstan, which had received the space 
gift, had to decide what to do with the space launch facility 
after that. Negotiations with Russia began. And then from 
somewhere came the figure of $7 billion--as much as was 
initially demanded by representatives of Kazakhstan for "damage 
caused to the earth in Kazakhstan" during all the time of 
Baykonur's existence. This is evidence not only of an 
unrealistic approach to the problem but also of a desire (in 
general, understandable) to "squeeze" as much as possible out of 
the situation that had developed. Russia began to think 
seriously about building a new space launch facility near the 
missile compound Svobodnyy-18 in Amur Oblast and expanding the 
Plesetsk space launch facility in Arkhangelsk Oblast. In turn, 
Kazakhstan and Ukraine tried to interest the United States in 
Baykonur, but that turned out to be not so easy... 
  It became clear that deciding the fate of Baykonur could not 
be put off any longer. Recently negotiations have been 
proceeding on a more even-handed, realistic basis. 
Representatives of Kazakhstan were asking hundreds of millions 
of dollars as payment for rent. Before the meeting of Presidents 
B. Yeltsin and N. Nazarbayev, things became especially heated in 
the negotiations among the experts; it was, as musicians say, a 
"crescendo." The specialists met daily including last Friday, 
and Saturday, and Sunday, and sometimes the discussion became 
very bitter. Clarification of disputed issues sometimes dragged 
out until after midnight. 
  Ultimately their positions came closer together, although a 
number of disagreements still remained. The Russians agreed to 
pay $82 million a year for rent. But Kazakhstan was insisting 
on 150 million. The presidents would have to find a compromise. 
And they found it; they settled on the sum of $115 million. 
  Of course, this is a considerable sum. Let us recall that, 
by participating in the creation of the international orbital 
station, Russia will receive $100 million from NASA (United 
States) each year. This, as we can see, is less than the rent 
for Baykonur for a year. Moreover, Russia is bearing the 
immense costs of maintaining the space facility. Last year it 
amounted to R39.6 billion (in last year's prices) and this year, 
according to estimates from specialists, it will take more than 
250 billion. 
  But still, adding up the pluses and minuses, one can say 
with 
confidence that the agreement signed by the presidents of the 
two countries concerning Baykonur is a very important and 
mutually advantageous step which can only be welcomed. Russia 
has neither the forces nor the money to build a new space 
facility today. And linked to Baykonur is the implementation of 
large-scale, long-term international programs (in particular, it 
is planned to have repeated flights of American astronauts to 
Mir within the framework of the project for creating a 
Russian-American orbital station). These programs produce 
considerable currency revenues, without which it would be hard 
for domestic space science to survive. On the other hand, 
Kazakhstan too will receive a great advantage from leasing the 
space facility to Russia. 
  It is especially important to emphasize that, in keeping 
with 
the conditions of the agreement, the rights to ownership of 
movable and immovable property which has appeared since 31 
August 1991 in Baykonur will belong to Russia. That is, now 
Moscow can invest money in Baykonur without fear of losing if 
there is an unfavorable development of events. 
  The agreement specifies that the term of the lease will be 
20 
years with an option to extend it another 10 years. The space 
facility will be serviced by Russian citizens. 
  The agreement signed by the presidents is a "framework" 
agreement. On its basis will be developed a leasing agreement, 
which is to be signed in the near future. 
  And so, after two years of uncertainty, negotiations that 
would become lively and then die down, mutual suspicions and 
reproaches, Russia and Kazakhstan have finally taken a serious 
step toward one another, resolving in a civilized manner one of 
the most difficult and painful issues in relations between our 
countries. A good sign!

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Amounts of Arms Sold by Russia May </F>
not Change"] 
  [Text] Viktor Samoylov, general director of the 
"Rosvooruzheniye" state company, maintains that Russia can 
potentially sell in 1994 $20 billion worth of arms and military 
hardware (nearly $2 billion in 1992). Mr. Samoylov has stated 
that Russia is ready to trade with the traditional partners: 
Middle East countries, India, China, African, and East European 
countries. Also, according to him, deliveries have fallen 
because, beginning in 1991, Russia went over to settlements in 
cash and stopped the granting of credits to its customer 
countries. Besides, Russia lost $10 to $15 billion over the UN 
sanctions against Libya and Iraq. According to him, Russia, 
unlike the Western countries, received no compensation from the 
United Nations and the IMF for the economic ties with them that 
were severed.

  [Text] Samples of sea water and of the sea bed in the 
vicinity of where the nuclear submarine Komsomolets sank in the 
Norwegian Sea showed that radiation levels there stayed within 
normal background values over 10 recent days, the Russian Navy 
press office reported. 
  The report was made public in response to allegations, made 
public on 29 March 1994 in NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, that the 
radiation situation had dramatically deteriorated in the area. 
  The Northern Fleet Press Office emphasized that radiation 
was 
continuously monitored in the area where Komsomolets had sunk. 
Now the research ship Semyon Dezhnyov is staying in the area. 
The instruments it carries and the skill of its personnel make 
it possible to obtain reliable data on the situation.

<F P=106> [INTERFAX report under the "Cooperation" rubric: "Russia </F>
and NATO Are Equal Partners. Vladimir Lukin on How One Should 
Join the `Partnership for Peace' Program"] 
  [Text] Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the State Duma 
International Affairs Committee, at a press conference in the 
lower chamber of the Russian parliament yesterday suggested that 
a number of terms on Russia's joining the NATO "Partnership for 
Peace" [PFP] program should be included in the presentation 
document now being prepared. 
  The parliamentarian thinks that Russia can take part in the 
NATO decisionmaking mechanism only as an equal partner of the 
North Atlantic Treaty. 
  Lukin is also convinced that the process of formalizing the 
"Partnership for Peace" program should take into account 
Russia's obligations in connection with the creation of a 
collective security system of CIS countries. It should also be 
specified how peacekeeping operations are going to be carried 
through, in what way processes are going to be coordinated, and 
what is the role of the Russian command. 
  On the questions of standardization of armaments under the 
"Partnership for Peace" program, Mr. Lukin thought that these 
problems should be solved "with both sides' interests being 
taken into consideration." 
  The parliamentarian suggests a phased system to finance the 
program because, according to him, Russia now would hardly be 
able to participate fully in its financing. 
  Mr. Lukin also underlined that Russia would have to persuade 
China that "we are not joining any military bloc against them." 
Besides, he pointed out, as a Eurasian country, Russia should 
"talk with China about the creation of a security system" which 
is to be bilateral or with the six countries taking part -- 
China, Japan, Russia, two Korean states, and the United States.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Pavel Kuznetsov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow March 31 TASS -- Russia's participation in 
NATO's Partnership for Peace programme "could be useful for 
Russia only under certain conditions", a senior Russian lawmaker 
said. 
  Addressing a news conference on Thursday, Vladimir Lukin, 
head of the State Duma (the parliament's lower house) Committee 
for Foreign Relations, dwelt upon some key issues concerning 
Russia's proposed joining the NATO initiative. 
  Russia agreed last month to enter the Partenership for 
Peace, 
a programme of joint exercises and military cooperation between 
the Atlantic Alliance and the post-communist countries. 
  Lukin deems it necessary to draw up a so-called "document of 
presentation" and send it to NATO before joining the initiative. 
The document is to specify mutual obligations of the 
Partnership's participants. It should also stipulate that 
Russia is ready to take part in the decision-making process only 
as NATO's equal partner. 
  Furthermore, the Partnership should have some relationship 
with the 52-member Conference on Security and Cooperation in 
Europe (CSCE), Russia's favoured forum for European security. 
  "The CSCE has a mandate for maintaining cooperation and 
keeping peace but no mechanism. NATO has a mechanism to impose 
its decisions but has not international mandate", Lukin said. 
  According to him, the above "document of presentation" could 
be best drafted by joint efforts of all the parties concerned: 
the executive branch, the foreign and defence ministries, the 
Security Council and the State Duma, in order to "avoid any 
questions in future". This document should be also brought in 
line with the already existing programmes of CIS collective 
security and take into account Russia's commitments under these 
programmes. 
  The lawmaker assumed that the decision to join the 
Partnership for Peace programme would not require ratification 
by the lower house, but "this is still to be verified", he noted.

<F P=106> [Dmitriy Volkov report under the "Contacts" rubric: "Russia </F>
Studies Alternatives to NATO expansion and Builds Direct 
Contacts With Europe"] 
  [Text] As has been advised by the staff of Russian Deputy 
Defense Minister Andrey Kokoshin, his meeting yesterday with 
French Ambassador to Russia Pierre Morel was devoted to 
international security matters. Mr. Kokoshin and Mr. Morel 
discussed the military-political cooperation of France and 
Russia under the agreements signed by both countries' defense 
ministers. 
  Commenting for SEGODNYA on the range of problems discussed, 
Andrey Kokoshin said that Russia advocates a strengthening of 
European security systems and views with great interest the 
"Balladur Plan" suggested by France, aimed at greater stability 
in Europe. This plan, according to experts, represents an 
autonomous program that does not rely on NATO structures and is 
based on bilateral agreements outside the U.S. sphere of 
control. Russia, incidentally, has stepped up its bilateral 
contacts with leading countries of Western Europe, especially 
with France and Germany, as well as with Great Britain and 
others. 
  Mr. Kokoshin, however, remarked that "alongside this" Russia 
also seeks to interact constructively with NATO, including 
participation in the "Partnership for Peace" program. Russia is 
trying to create a counterbalance of sorts to NATO's possible 
expansion through the accession of former Soviet satellites to 
it. The possibility of proposing to the European community a 
security system not based on a military bloc where the United 
States plays the leading role, but one based on bilateral 
accords, especially with France -- a country that traditionally 
keeps aloof from NATO and is unwilling to follow in the wake of 
American foreign policy -- appears very appealing. 
  According to SEGODNYA's lights, Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev will put before Western European countries a 
Russian concept of European security late in April.

  [Text] A well-informed source in the Black Sea Fleet 
headquarters reported to INTERFAX that in autumn of 1993 ships 
of the Black Sea Fleet headed for Georgia's western coasts only 
to stabilize the situation in the region of the port city of 
Poti. Their second goal, and the main one, was to prevent a 
large group of NATO ships from entering the Black Sea for 
permanent duty. 
  In his words, late October 1993 representatives of NATO 
Joint 
Naval command held a sitting which passed a decision to include 
the Black Sea into the zone of NATO's political interests. A 
8-9-strong group of ships was supposed to be stationed for 
permanent duty in the Black Sea to exert control over this 
region. The source reported that the ships were to enter the 
Black Sea on November 14. 
  This is why the Black Sea command made a decision to gather 
an operative-tactical grouping which departed to the Caucasus' 
coasts. 
  "If we had not done this they would have entered the Black 
Sea," emphasized the source in the Black Sea Fleet headquarters. 
  He also underlined that on the whole, the activity of NATO 
ships in the Black Sea is increasing. As an example, he 
mentioned the fact that last year 15 NATO ships which were 
conducting joint naval maneuvers together with Bulgarians and 
Romanians in close vicinity to Russia's and Ukraine's southern 
boundaries visited the Black Sea.

  [Text] Moscow March 31 TASS -- Kazakhstan President 
Nursultan Nazarbayev's initiative about the creation of an 
Euroasian union, which he put forward during his visit to 
Moscow, was met with "cautious interest" by Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin, his press secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov told a 
briefing in the Kremlin today. 
  Kostikov called the initiative "unexpected," although he 
admitted Nazarbayev could not have made his idea public at a 
meeting with Moscow State University students without having 
discussed it with the Russian president beforehand. 
  Kostikov expressed his opinion that "Nazarbayev's idea has a 
geopolitical logic, but that logic is already contained in the 
CIS formula, so it is hardly necessary to replace one good idea 
with another, but there would be some sense in their mutual 
evolution." 
  The presidential press secretary said that Yeltsin has taken 
a time-out to examine the arguments pro and contra Nursultan 
Nazarbayev's initiative.

  [Text] Washington April 1 TASS -- Secretary of the Russian 
Security Council, Oleg Lobov, ended a series of meetings with 
high-ranking officials of the U.S. Administration. 
  On Thursday [1 April], Lobov met with the presidential aide 
for economic issues, Bowmen Catter, and political adviser of the 
U.S. President for health care, Richard Cronik. 
  Earlier, Lobov thoroughly familiarized himself with the 
structure and functions of the U.S. national security council. 
In particular, Lobov extended an invitation to the presidential 
aide for national security, Anthony Lake, to pay a visit to 
Moscow. The invitation was accepted with gratitude. 
  During Lobov's talks with top-ranking officials of the U.S. 
Administration, the sides discussed, in particular, the U.S. 
stance on the development of relations with Russia. The sides 
pointed out the importance of deepening interaction and 
partnership between the two countries. Considerable attention 
was paid to economic problems which were thoroughly discussed at 
a meeting between the Russian delegation and representatives of 
U.S. business circles. 
  After the talks in Washington were completed, the Russian 
delegation went to Honolulu at the invitation of the governor of 
the state of Hawaii. During a series of meetings with local 
businessmen the sides are expected to discuss possibilities for 
establishing mutually advantageous ties between American 
companies and Russian organisations in the Far East and problems 
of stepping up cooperation in the Asian-Pacific region. This 
subject is expected to be brought up at a meeting with members 
of the council for international affairs in Honolulu.

<F P=106> [Yuriy Popov report under the "Visits" rubric: "Is the </F>
Russian Market Economy Necessary for U.S. Security?"] 
  [Text] The U.S. business delegation which arrived in 
Moscow on Monday is surely the most high-powered ever to come 
here. It is headed by Commerce Secretary Ronald Brown and 
consists of leading figures from the largest U.S. corporations 
and concerns, the export-import bank, and other associations and 
institutions. The purpose of the trip is to carry out an 
on-the-spot study of Russia's economic position and determine 
potential for the further development of economic ties between 
the two countries. 
  The U.S. visitors confirmed this intention during a round 
table meeting of representatives of Russia and the United States 
held at the Slavyanskaya hotel yesterday. The significance that 
the Russian side attaches to the visit is shown by its 
representatives at the meeting: Aleksandr Shokhin, Oleg 
Soskovets, Oleg Davydov, Yuriy Shafranik, Sergey Dubinin, and 
Yuriy Petrov. 
  President Clinton, who announced the mission in Moscow back 
in January, bade the delegation farewell by saying that the 
Russian market economy is vitally necessary to the economic 
security of the United States and the whole world. In his 
opening address at the meeting, R. Brown stressed that the U.S. 
side intends to overcome all the barriers standing in the way of 
the development of Russo-U.S. trade and private enterprise. 
U.S. entrepreneurs, he said, prepared for this mission with 
great enthusiasm and were extremely keen to visit Russia. They 
represent the broadest U.S. business circles -- a fact which 
suggests that we have great potential for expanding mutual 
relations in commerce and trade, investments, and so forth. At 
the same time he expressed the hope that the Russian state will 
take appropriate steps to ensure a basis conducive to the entry 
of foreign investments. 
  Perhaps this is the ultimate task of the visit by such a 
high-powered delegation. That was the main theme in the U.S. 
representatives' comments during the discussion of the items on 
the agenda which has now begun: the economic reform, trade, and 
foreign investments.

  [Text] St. Petersburg April 1 TASS -- Representatives of 
the U.S. business circles, accredited in St. Petersburg, have 
assessed the statement made here at a business luncheon by U.S. 
Secretary of Commerce Ronald Brown as cautiously optimistic 
about the possibility of expanding bilateral economic relations. 
Brown described as not very encouraging the dynamics of the 
development of the Russian market economy. 
  Nevertheless, he believes there are prerequisites for 
stepping up bilateral cooperation in many areas, primarily in 
space exploration, extraction and processing of oil and gas, 
production of medicines, and development of communication 
facilities. 
  Brown said that real chances to "advance to the Urals" had 
appeared after his trip to Yekaterinburg. Offices of American 
companies could be opened there. 
  The agenda of the stay in St. Petersburg of the American 
delegation, which includes the heads of 28 key U.S. 
corporations, is of an obviously business character. Brown had 
a private meeting with St. Petersburg Mayor Anatoliy Sobchak 
today morning.

arrive in Kansas, U.S. in November to take part in joint 
exercises," said Colonel General Eduard Vorobyev, deputy chief 
commander of the Russian land forces. 
  The exercises are designed to upgrade coordination in 
peacekeeping operations. 
  The Russians will participate in the fall exercises after 
their American counterparts take part in the exercises 
code-named Peacekeeper-94, which will take place in Totsk, the 
Volga military district of Russia, from July 6 through 14. 
  Asked about the advisability of such exercises, 
Colonel-General Vorobyev said new peace-keeping methods, based 
on the experience of the best peace-keeping missions of American 
and Russian Armed Forces. [as received] 
  Vorobyev denied the allegations concerning "the preparations 
for the occupation of Russia by American troops". He said one

  [Text] Moscow March 31 TASS -- Russia would like to take 
part in the organisation which will succeed the Coordinating 
Committee on Export Controls (Cocom), which ceases its existence 
as of April first according to a decision taken by Cocom's 
representatives during a meeting held in a suburb of the Hague. 
  Cocom's "death" symbolizes the disappearance of one more 
relic from the "Cold War". Cocom was formed in 1949 by the NATO 
countries with Australia and Japan to establish strict controls 
over the export of strategically important technologies and raw 
materials to the socialist bloc countries. 
  As far as Cocom's "successor" is concerned, it will not be a 
structure similar to its predecessor, but basically a new 
organization which should implement an international programme 
to monitor the movement of arms and dual-use technologies, 
ITAR-TASS learned from reliable sources. 
  The new organization should forestall the purchase of such 
goods for military purposes, but will hopefully not be aimed 
against one state of group of states. 
  Work on an agreement concerning the new organization is due 
to begin in the near future. China, Poland, Hungary, the Czech 
Republic and Slovakia have announced their interest in being 
part of the Cocom-successor organization. So far, a decision 
has been made to found three working groups which will outline 
the main purposes of the future international institution. 
  Consultations on the approaches of various countries to the 
problem of export control will be continued. Russia has already 
taken part in such negotiations and is ready to continue to play 
an active role in them on a partner-like basis. 
  The most important question remains that of working out an 
effective international control mechanism which will replace the 
old principles and help maintain the necessary high level of 
knowledge about the spread of strategic technologies and 
materials.

  [Text] Pskov (Pechora stretch of the Russo-Estonian border) 
April 1 TASS -- A Russian border patrol was fired upon in 
Pechora district of Pskov region, on the border with Estonia. 
  According to preliminary information, received from 
competent 
sources, two violators, who crossed the border from the Estonian 
side, were stopped by a Russian border patrol at 3 a.m. on April 
1st 50 kilometres from the Russia town of Pskov. They were 
approximately 25 and 40 years old. The older man said his name 
was Vladimir Ilyich and that he was an Afghan war veteran, while 
the younger man said he was a pilot of Pskov airport. 
  One of them pulled out a "TT" pistol and started shooting at 
the patrol when the borderguards reported on the incident to 
their superiors and asked for a car to bring the violators to 
the border post. The patrol commander was killed by a bullet in 
the heart and two of his subordinates were wounded. Both 
violators fled to Estonia. They are now being sought by Russian 
and Estonian special services.

  [Text] London, 1 Apr -- Great Britain announced today that 
it is expelling a Russian diplomat. The diplomat has not been 
named. A Foreign Office spokesman said this is in retaliation 
for the expulsion from Moscow of a staff member of the British 
Embassy in the Russian Federation [RF] accused of receiving 
intelligence information from Russian citizens. "The Russians 
asked us to recall a diplomat," a Foreign Office spokesman said. 
"We regret that demand, which is at odds with the bilateral 
relationship we are trying to build. In retaliation, we asked 
the Russians to recall one of their diplomats from London. 
Neither diplomat has been declared persona non grata. We hope 
this matter is now at an end." 
  A Russian Federation embassy spokesman in London said he has 
"no comment" on this question.

<F P=106> [From the "Special Report" program; passages within </F>
quotation marks recorded] 
  [Text] [Unidentified correspondent] Once upon a time this 
office was the heart of the Lubyanka. It was here that Yuriy 
Andropov, the chairman of state security worked. After him, no 
one else occupied this office, and practically nothing in it has 
changed to this day. 
  But plenty has changed in the structure of the Russian 
security services. Names, leaders, and to a certain extent the 
personnel have changed. Russian counterintelligence, as the 
professionals themselves admit, is not having a very good time 
at the moment. Open borders and imperfect legislation do not 
help to catch spies -- and this at a time when Russia remains, 
as she always was, a huge source of new technology -- a fact 
well understood not only by Western secret services but also by 
ordinary commercial companies. 
  [Aleksandr Mikhailov, head of the Federal 
Counterintelligence 
Service, FSK] "There are foreign secret services on Russian 
territory, and they do periodically forget their sense of 
moderation and the fact that they are guests here, and begin to 
act fairly openly in their own interests." 
  [Correspondent] At the most approximate estimate, there are 
about 120,000 foreigners illegally present in Moscow and Moscow 
Oblast at the moment. Of course, not all of them are spies. In 
any case, the greatest damage is caused not by foreign spies but 
by our own ones. We no longer have the concept of a specialist 
who is not allowed to leave the country, practically everyone is 
allowed to go abroad. But practically everyone here earns God 
knows how little, so the market for potential spies here is 
bigger than ever. 
  Vadim Sintsov, alias British intelligence agent Demetrius, 
only worked as a spy for about a year, and was uncovered 
recently and is now testifying from Lefortovo. 
  [Sintsov] "A certain Mr. James Self started working with me. 
After a while he introduced me to his receiving side, that is, a 
communications officer. They met me in other countries, that 
is, not in Russia. But in about the fall, they started to 
develop an option for communicating here." 
  [Correspondent] Sintsov does not know why, of all the 
specialists with access to the information that interested the 
British, they chose him. It might be simply that the British 
secret services got hold of documents that compromised Sintsov, 
and were sure that he would work with them. Sintsov got about 
$12,000 from the British over a year -- not much by Western 
standards. In comparison with the prices for services of this 
kind a few years ago, our spies are getting paid a lot less now. 
But there are still plenty of people wanting to share state 
secrets with foreign powers. Just last year about 20 agents were 
uncovered in Russia. 
  [Mikhailov] "In the West, according to our information, a 
fairly respectable database on our leading-edge technologies and 
our armaments and new inventions has already been formed." 
  [Sintsov] "They were mainly interested in two things, two 
areas where I could offer information due to my official 
activity. The first was Russian arms deliveries to Middle East 
countries, and the second was general issues of the organization 
of arms deliveries here." 
  [Correspondent] It is interesting, however, that science and 
technology may develop, the main methods used by agents from 
various countries have not changed over many years and centuries. 
  [Mikhailov] "The main weapon, as before, is the agents." 
  [Correspondent] Just as before, they use compromising 
material to recruit, hiding places that look like canned food, 
special writing, and even a password when two agents meet. As 
the specialists themselves say, there are intelligence services 
from friendly countries, but there are no friendly intelligence 
services. Incidentally, just yesterday the FSK detained three 
DPRK embassy employees in an attempt to obtain examples of new 
armaments, as well as a diplomat from Africa for other espionage 
activity.

  [Text] Moscow, March 31 (TASS) -- Russia's Gazprom gas 
giant is forced to gradually reduce gas supplies to Belarus from 
April 1, an official of Gazprom's central controlling 
directorate told BUSINESS-TASS. 
  Earlier, Russia cut its gas deliveries to Belarus because of 
huge outstanding debts of the republic's consumers to the 
Russian state-run gas company. But as a result of 
Russian-Belarusian negotiations, gas supplies to the former 
Soviet republic were resumed in the full volume, some 54 million 
cubic metres a day, from March 15. Since then, Belarusia's debt 
to Gazprom has increased by another 100 billion roubles and 
reached 500 billion roubles. Attempts by the Belarusian 
Government to recover debts from the republican gas consumers 
and to repay them to Russian suppliers have been in vain so far. 
  However, the Gazprom official said, in contrast to Ukraine, 
Belarusia has not resorted to syphoning gas intended for Western 
consumers from the pipelines crossing the republic's territory. 
Therefore, gas consumers in Brest, Lithuania, the Kaliningrad 
region and Poland are likely to continue receiving Russian gas 
in the full volume. 
  Ukraine has not yet managed to repay its gas debts to Russia 
either. As a result of the latest Russian-Ukrainian 
negotiations, gas deliveries to Ukraine were resumed in the full 
volume for a month's period, until April 10.

  [Text] Moscow March 31 TASS -- A new strong impulse has to 
be given to attempts at political settlement in the Dniester 
region, Vladilen Vasev, plenipotentiary representative of the 
Russian president told ITAR-TASS in an exclusive interview. 
  He returned the other day from a two-week-long tour of the 
republic of Moldova and Dniester region. 
  Vasev met with Moldovan President Mircea Snegur, Parliament 
Speaker Petru Luchinski, Dniester leader Igor Smirnov and other 
officials. 
  Russia is concerned about the lack of progress at the direct 
talks between Moldova and Dniester, which have been going on for 
about 18 months, he said. 
  On the other hand, Moscow praises Moldova and the Dniester 
region for their readiness to come to a compromise at settling 
the crisis and the fact that they have called on Russia to 
mediate at the talks. 
  Vasev told the Moldovan president and the Dniester leader 
about Russia's concept of a special status for the Dniester 
region, which could form a basis for holding talks and working 
out mutually acceptable decisions. 
  That was the major aim of my tour. The Russian party aims at 
helping to set the dialogue going, since the past talks, in 
which "amorphous parliamentary-and-governmental expert groups 
participated, were ineffective," he emphasized. 
  The Moldovan and Dniester presidents now seem likely to 
confer wide powers to their respective delegations at the 
forthcoming talks, with Russia acting as an intermediary. 
  "Both parties pay due attention to the issue and look for a 
format for a new stage in negotiations," the high-ranking 
Russian diplomat said. 
  "The Republic of Moldova and the Dniester region would like 
to give a strong impetus to the new stage in the talks," he said. 
  Vasev surmised that the two parties will agree upon the 
conditions for providing the impetus at an early date.

<F P=106> [Igor Rotar report under the "Talks" rubric: "Main Problem </F>
is Refugees. Another Stage of Georgian-Abkhazian Settlement"] 
  [Excerpts] Consultations between the delegations of 
Abkhazia and Georgia on a settlement of their conflict were held 
in Moscow yesterday with Russia's mediation. The new 
Georgian-Abkhazian meeting was prompted by a recent appeal by 
the Russian Government expressing concern over the resumption of 
hostilities and calling on the warring sides to sit at the 
negotiating table once again. 
  It was decided not to discuss Abkhazia's future status (the 
sides should only agree on a cease-fire) during these 
consultations, which were intended to focus on the return of 
refugees. 
  Deputy Foreign Minister Boris Pastukhov, personal 
representative of the Russian president, told NEZAVISIMAYA 
GAZETA on the eve of the talks: "I cannot say that we have 
achieved a significant breakthrough, but now the achievement of 
a compromise has finally become a reality. We have conducted 
intensive work with the Abkhazian delegation and now the final 
result depends on the Georgian side." 
  In Pastukhov's view, the Russian side has managed to 
convince 
the Abkhazians to soften considerably their criteria for the 
definition of "refugees to be banned from entry." Initially, 
the Abkhazians insisted on including in this category "all those 
who participate in the hostilities on the Georgian side." Now 
they have agreed that the following categories will be denied 
the right of return: those responsible for military crimes; 
regular criminals; and those taking part in military operations 
or currently undergoing training at special military camps in 
western Georgia. 
  According to Boris Pastukhov, the Abkhazian side was very 
reluctant to agree with the definition of the third category. 
The personal representative of the Russian president said that, 
according to UN military observers' estimates, there are three 
military camps in western Georgia, each of them providing 
training for around 1,000 refugees from Abkhazia. Pastukhov is 
certain that the Georgian side has to accept the current 
definition of the "refugees banned from returning:" "What is 
more important, after all: The problem of 3,000 intransigent 
young people, or the fate of around 300,000 refugees (the figure 
given by the Georgians themselves). If the Georgians really 
want peace, they are obliged to agree to the plan." [passage

  During yesterday's talks, however, the sides never came to a 
definite solution. Despite that, the Russian president's 
personal representative is not losing his optimism: "We have 
achieved considerable success and are steadily moving ahead 
toward our goal. Final conclusions should be drawn after the end 
of the talks, the new round of which is scheduled for 4 April."

  [Text] Russian border guard troops will stay in Tajikistan 
for a long time, the commander of border guard troops, 
Colonel-General Andrey Nikolayev told a news conference in 
Dushanbe Thursday [31 March]. 
  He said that maximum attention will be given to providing 
housing and service facilities for them and that the presence in 
Tajikistan of Russian border guard troops is a recognition of 
Russia's strategic interests in the republic, and the interests 
of Russia and Tajikistan, like all CIS countries, lie in the 
security of the Tajik-Afghan border. 
  Nikolayev said that there is no military way for solving the 
problems of Tajikistan. However, the border guard troops on the 
territory of Tajikistan pursue Russia's foreign policy aims. He 
spoke highly of the results of the military council in Dushanbe 
on March 31. He said they had taken decisions to fulfil the 
tasks of the border guard troops and help their interaction with 
the collective peace-keeping forces and the Tajik Defense 
Ministry. He said that all the problems on the agenda were 
solved. 
  Nikolayev said that all citizens of Tajikistan would study 
at 
Russian military colleges and serve within Russian border guard 
troops deployed in Tajikistan. 
  The general said that additional Russian-Kyrgyz check-points 
will be set up to protect the borders of the Gorno-Badakhshan 
Autonomous region. A Kyrgyz battalion has arrived in 
Badakhshan, said Nikolayev.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Sergey Zhirnikhin and Ivan </F>
Ivanov] 
  [Text] Budapest, 31 March -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin, who is here on an official visit, had a meeting 
this afternoon with Hungarian President Arpad Goncz. 
  The ITAR-TASS correspondent was informed by sources within 
the Russian Governmental delegation that V. Chernomyrdin had 
stated the intention of Russia to firmly adhere to the course of 
developing friendly ties and cooperation, which accords with the 
interests of the two countries' peoples. 
  The head of the Russian Cabinet informed the Hungarian 
president of the main directions of the Russian Government's 
policies, especially in the economic sphere. It was noted that 
a deepening of practical cooperation and the finding of mutually 
acceptable solutions to questions that arise should provide a 
firm and stable basis for the further progress of 
Russian-Hungarian trade and economic links. 
  V. Chernomyrdin said also that Russia highly appreciates the 
level that has been achieved in bilateral relations, which are 
no longer burdened by any fundamental problems and are 
characterized by a fruitful political dialogue and constructive 
interaction between the Russian Federation and Hungary in a 
spirit of genuine equality and partnership. 
  Today Russia occupies second place among Hungary's major 
economic partners. In its turn, Budapest is in sixth or seventh 
place among Moscow's main foreign trade partners, Arpad Goncz 
said. In the view of the Hungarian head of state, there is 
every chance that the economic interaction between the two 
countries can be made even more intensive. The legal and 
juridical base for this has already been created. 
  In spite of the fact that "Western orientation" is 
considered 
a priority in the development of the Hungarian national economy, 
Budapest cannot allow itself not to expand its Eastern European 
links, above all with Russia. It is necessary to work out a 
joint document on the mutual protection of investments and to 
push forward cooperation in the financial sphere and in 
interaction between banks, Arpad Goncz stressed. 
  After meeting the Hungarian president, Viktor Chernomyrdin 
laid wreaths at the monument to Soviet soldiers in Budapest's 
Freedom Square and at the monument in Heroes Square.

  [Text] Russia's Foreign Minister hopes that direct contacts 
between the Federal Assembly and Poland's Seim (parliament) will 
help to get rid of "some faults" in bilateral relations. Andrey 
Kozyrev expressed this view after a meeting with the Polish Seim 
Marshal (speaker of the lower house of parliament IF [INTERFAX]) 
Jozef Oleksy. 
  As Kozyrev said, "a paradoxical friendship is evolving 
between Russia and Poland. The paradox lies in the fact that we 
have good relations resting on a sound legal basis, good 
contacts at the level of presidents, prime ministers, and 
foreign ministers, but then there are some odd press statements, 
especially in the Polish press. We also have extremists, who 
make irresponsible statements from time to time, but they never 
make them officially," Kozyrev remarked. 
  In his opinion, Moscow and Warsaw "need to strengthen the 
legal base of their common interests and remove all faults in 
bilateral ties."

  [Text] Moscow, 31 Mar -- Questions of bilateral cooperation 
and solving difficult problems were the subject of discussion at 
a meeting today between Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev 
and Poland's Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy. 
  Lately, there has been a big upsurge in Russian-Polish 
top-level contacts, Kozyrev said after the meeting. However, 
the Polish press at times carries irresponsible unofficial 
statements that clearly do not help to strengthen bilateral 
relations. The minister expressed the hope that the talks in 
Moscow between the members of the Polish parliamentary 
delegation and Russian parliamentarians and representatives of 
executive power would lead to the elimination of certain 
distortions.

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: By correspondents </F>
Dmitriy Voskoboynikov, Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy, and 
others] 
  [Text] Russia does not pose any potential threat to Poland. 
On the contrary, it would like "to give a hand of friendship 
and cooperation to Warsaw," a high ranking Russian diplomat in 
charge for relations with Poland declared in his interview with 
Interfax. 
  He expressed regret due to the fact that over the last 
period 
of time the Polish press "depicts modern Russia and its future 
in rather dark shades." "This places its own imprint on the 
perception of our country on the part of rank-and-file Poles and 
of many political functionaries. There is practically no 
reliable information from Russian in Poland," said the diplomat. 
  In his words, there "are several actual but not imaginary 
problems in the Russian-Polish relations." We must bring order 
into the system of mutual accounts between two countries, to 
solve the problem of debts, and to coordinate everything what 
concerns the joint project providing for the construction of 
Russian gas pipelines on Poland's territory. This would help to 
increase Russian natural gas shipments both to Poland and to the 
Western European countries," said the diplomat. 
  In his opinion, "the visit of a parliamentary delegation 
headed by Marshall (the lower chamber speaker -- Interfax) of 
the Polish Seimas Yosef Oleksa to Moscow will greatly promote to 
"the warming of Russian-Polish relations." 
  On Wednesday Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin 
received the Polish parliamentarians at their request. On 
Thursday they are to hold "intensive contacts" in the State 
Duma's committees and commissions. They are supposed to meet 
with the speakers of the Federal Assembly's chambers, Ivan 
Rybkin and Vladimir Shumeyko. 
  It is not ruled out that on Friday Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin will receive the Polish delegation.

  [Text] Russia believes that the agreement between 
representatives of Croatia and Krajina's Serbs concluded in the 
Russian Embassy in Zagreb on Wednesday [30 March] will be 
observed. The party which violates it "will challenge the key 
members of the world community. It would be extremely 
unreasonable," the special envoy of the Russian President 
Vitaliy Churkin, Russia's deputy Foreign Minister, declared at a 
press conference on Thursday in Moscow. 
  He also reported that the UN General Secretary Butrus Ghali 
had already addressed the Security Council with a request to 
allocate additional forces to be deployed in the disengagement 
zone. 
  Responding to an Interfax correspondent, Churkin indicated 
that in Croatia there are 800 Russian servicemen in the 
composition of the UN peacekeeping forces. As many as 200 
Russians will go there in the second half of April. 
  Speaking about the political status of the self-proclaimed 
republic of Serbian Krajina, Churkin pointed out that "the 
solution of this problem should come with time. Those Croatian 
Serbs who adhere to unreconcilable positions on this issue are 
actually taking up an anti-Serbian position." 
  In Churkin's words, "the event which occurred in Zagreb is 
of 
great importance because it is a political-diplomatic model 
within which one must work during the next few weeks and months 
to settle the situation not only in Croatia but in Bosnia as 
well. The meeting with the participation of the Bosnian Serbs, 
Croats, and Moslems may take place within the next few weeks if 
not the next few days." 
  Churkin believes that the Bosnian Croats and Moslems who 
have 
concluded an agreement on the creation of the federation must 
coordinate and develop a joint position for the negotiations 
with the Bosnian Serbs. 
  As Churkin said, an active involvement of the 
representatives of the United States, European Union, and United 
Nations is not just "a tribute to politeness." "Russia was and 
will be in favor of the expansion of international interaction 
during the settlement in the former Yugoslavia. We must act in 
agreement with the United States, European Union, and United 
Nations."

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Vitaliy Churkin, Russian special </F>
representative in former Yugoslavia, by RIA NOVOSTI 
correspondent Sergey Gryzunov "especially for ROSSIYSKAYA 
GAZETA;" date and place not given: "Serbs and Croats 
Reconciled"] 
  [Text] The joint efforts of Russian and U.S. diplomacy 
produced the desired result 30 March. The Croats and the Serbs 
who are densely concentrated in the Krajina enclave on the 
territory of the Republic of Croatia, concluded a cease-fire 
agreement. Russia played a crucial role in achieving this 
agreement. Vitaliy Churkin, its special representative in the 
talks on the former Yugoslavia, gave an exclusive interview for 
ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA. 
  [Gryzunov] What further action will you take to resolve the 
Yugoslav crisis? 
  [Churkin] First, our joint actions with the Americans are a 
precedent which will have far-reaching importance. It is 
experience which we can use to resolve other conflicts. 
  As regards the former Yugoslavia, two main areas of work 
have 
now been mapped out for us. They are further steps to normalize 
Serb-Croat relations, specifically in areas protected by UN 
units. Possibly in two weeks' time we will be able to organize a 
new round of talks at the Russian Embassy in Zagreb between the 
Croats and the Serbs from Krajina on economic questions, and 
then we will move on to the most difficult part of the talks -- 
Krajina's political status. 
  We intend to take advantage of the accelerating pace of 
peacemaking efforts in order to complete the settlement of the 
Bosnian conflict. We and our U.S. partners have a clear idea of 
what to do next. 
  [Gryzunov] It is known that some Duma deputies are prepared 
to obstruct the Foreign Ministry in connection with your 
approach to NATO's "Partnership for Peace" program. How will 
you react? 
  [Churkin] From my viewpoint our participation in the program 
is something that speaks for itself. The reaction of a section 
of the Duma did, however, come as quite a surprise to me. In 
this context we have already started to explain our positions 
and approaches. 
  Our reaction is that we will defend our viewpoint. We have 
to dot all the i's and cross all the t's. 
  Therefore, as for myself, when I get back to Moscow I intend 
to participate most vigorously in the upcoming debate on this 
question prior to 21 April, when it is planned that Russia 
should officially join the "Partnership for Peace" program.

Yugoslavia for another six months and strengthen the force with 
3,500 servicemen. Speaking at the session, Vasiliy Sidorov, the

<F P=106> [Yevgeniy Fadeyev report under "World Hot Spots -- </F>
Yugoslavia" rubric: "First Turks, then Germans..."] 
  [Text] Belgrade -- In the "Yugoslavia" hotel, where the 
headquarters of the UN peacekeeping forces is billeted, I met a 
major from a West European country, whom I had met on a number 
of trips, and heard something unexpected: 
  "Naturally, this is not my business, but you have 'set 
yourselves up' again; by agreeing to send 400 Russian 'blue 
helmets' to Bosnia, you have given the Muslims a gift which they 
have long been dreaming about. The Turks will immediately 
arrive in Sarajevo in response...." 
  The very next day, Muslim leader A. Izetbegovic protested to 
all and sundry against the arrival of the Russian "blue 
helmets," who, in his opinion, cannot be neutral, since they are 
the Serbs' allies. And then he asked the question: "If Russia 
has arrived in Sarajevo, why can Turkey not do the same thing?" 
  And so, in violation of the unwritten UN principle not to 
send military subunits from neighboring countries or former 
occupaniers to Bosnia, its secretary general has given the Turks 
permission for this. First it was a question of 200 servicemen. 
Then it was reported: Ankara is sending 2,700 men. 
  The reaction of Belgrade and the Balkan countries was not 
long coming. Here are just a few headlines: "Janissaries 
Again," "Turkey -- Threat to Peace," "Return of the Ottoman 
Empire." 
  The Turkish foreign minister commented as follows on the UN 
decision to allow Turkish troops to be part of the "blue 
helmets": "This is a triumph for Turkish policy." 
  The Bosnian Serbs, Belgrade, Athens, and Sofia do not think 
so. Their opinion is unanimous: Turkey was an occupier for many 
years, and it is not at all appropriate for it to be involved in 
peacekeeping actions in Bosnia since it is a prejudiced force. 
  By and large it is impossible to get rid of the idea that on 
every occasion, as if deliberately, the West and the United 
States think up "solutions" with one aim alone -- to add fuel to 
the smoldering fire. 
  And what about Moscow? The Greek newspaper TA NEA, which is 
close to government circles, writes that only Russia could 
hinder the dispatch of Turkish troops. However, its UN 
representative, Vorontsov, has stated that the Russian 
Government is in agreement with the Turkish proposal.... 
  Naive Athens observers: Moscow has already congratulated 
Athens on its peacekeeping contribution, and, for the purposes 
of balance, is sending another 300 servicemen to Bosnia who 
include representatives of Muslim nationalities. 
  Speaking at a parliamentary sitting, the leader of the 
Bosnian Muslims, touching on the UN decision to involve Turkey 
in its operations, stated in particular: "The conditions for a 
major war are thus being created." If the Turks arrive, he 
said, then the armed forces of Yugoslavia, as a member of the 
United Nations, will enter the Serb Republic. 
  The UN Security Council has adopted the following decision: 
The city of Mostar, which the Croats and the Muslims can in no 
way divide up between themselves, will be under the control of 
the European Union in the next two years. To accomplish this 
its leaders have instructed...Germany. And one of the fathers 
of the city of Bremen has been appointed Governor of Mostar. He 
will bring with him his own administrative officials and police.

  [Text] Moscow April 1 ITAR-TASS -- The Russian Foreign 
Ministry welcomes the accords signed as a result of talks 
between the Government of Israel and the Palestine Liberation 
Organisation, according to the statement received by ITAR-TASS 
today. 
  The negotiations, which centered around security in Hebron, 
ended with the decision to send international observers to this 
city. 
  "Russia as a co-sponsor of the peace process is firmly 
convinced that these accords must be followed by new steps, and 
first of all by the signing of an agreement on Gaza and Jericho 
and its implementation in accordance with the schedule indicated 
in the declaration of principles. This would enable not only an 
easing of tension on occupied territories but also open up a 
path towards the advancement of the entire negotiating process 
aimed at establishing a fair and durable peace in the Middle 
East," the Russian Foreign Ministry said. 
  The Russian ministry expressed the hope that the accords 
reached in the course of the negotiations would be fulfilled to 
provide reliable protection to the Palestinian population and 
normalise the situation on the occupied territories.

<F P=106> [BY ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Boris Krivoshey and </F>
Aleksandr Krylovich] 
  [Text] Moscow, 31 Mar -- The Russian Foreign Ministry [MID] 
has expressed serious concern in connection with the continuing 
incidents of violence on the West Bank of the Jordan and the 
Gaza Strip, as a result of which there has been an increasing 
loss of life. Grigoriy Karasin, director of the Foreign 
Ministry's Information and Press Department, noted at a briefing 
today that these incidents could "deal a blow not only to the 
prospects for achieving accords between the Palestine Liberation 
Organization (PLO) and the Israeli Government, but also to the 
whole Near East peace process." 
  In these conditions, the MID spokesman stressed, "the 
Russian 
co- sponsor for a settlement considers it his duty to once again 
urge both sides -- the Israelis and the Palestinians -- to show 
maximum restraint and calm in order to prevent the fate of the 
peace efforts being handed to [ne otdavat na otkup] 
irresponsible extremist elements." 
  The main thing now, the Russian foreign political department 
believes, "is to do everything to ensure the speediest 
conclusion of an agreement by Israel and the PLO on Gaza and 
Jericho and its practical implementation." "This would signify 
the first real step on the way toward implementing the 
Palestine-Israel declaration on principles, and would give a 
strong boost to the successful advancement of the peace process 
in the Near East," Grigory Karasin stated.

  [Excerpts] The UN Reparations Commission has fixed at $40 
billion the size of the damages Iraq must pay those who were 
affected during its invasion of Kuwait. The amount going to 
affected Russian companies is $2 billion. [passage omitted] 
  As IZVESTIYA was informed at the Russian Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs International Organizations Department, our diplomats 
have already passed on to the UN Reparations Commission almost 
99 percent of all claims on the Russian side. On the whole, 
those who sustained losses were former Soviet foreign trade 
organizations which lost orders in Kuwait as a result of the 
Iraqi invasion. A Foreign Ministry staffer placed special 
emphasis on the fact that the claims issue has nothing at all to 
do with the problem of Iraqi debts to Russia, which will be 
resolved separately and on a bilateral basis.

<F P=106> [Ravil Mustafin report: "Algeria: The Terror Goes On"] </F>
  [Text] This week another name has been added to the tragic 
list of Russian citizens who have died in Algeria. On Monday 
Konstantin Kukushkin, the 41-year old driver of our ambassador, 
was killed in a suburb of the Algerian capital. His wife 
Nadezhda and seven-year old daughter Irina had remained in 
Russia. 
  The dead man was the fifth Russian citizen to have died in 
Algeria at the hands of Muslim fundamentalists in the past six 
months. The solemn tally was opened on 16 October last year, 
when Lieutenant Colonel Vladimir Valezhnyy and Lieutenant 
Colonel Aleksandr Orlov, instructors at an air defense school in 
Laghouat (400 km from the Algerian capital), were killed. 
Lieutenant Colonel Aleksandr Loshchilin was wounded on that 
occasion. In December the fundamentalists gunned down a Russian 
citizen who was permanently resident in Algeria. On 12 February 
this year V. Ovcharenko, a specialist working at a thermal 
electric power station, was killed. Now K. Kukushkin has died. 
  Your ITAR-TASS correspondent has sent the details of this 
tragedy. Kukushkin went to the Algiers suburb to buy essential 
spares for the embassy's Lada cars. Having made the purchases 
he returned to his Toyota minibus which was in a parking bay. 
He got into the driver's seat and turned the ignition key. At 
that moment two gunmen suddenly appeared (some witnesses say 
there were three of them) and opened fire from revolvers aiming 
at Kukushkin's head. Two of the shots proved fatal. 
  In the words of Grigoriy Karasin, director of the Russian 
Federation Foreign Ministry's Information and Press Department, 
the Russian foreign policy department and "other relevant" 
departments are now working out a set of additional measures 
designed to protect Russia's interests and the security of our 
citizens in Algeria. Well, such measures are indeed necessary, 
but in my view they should have been worked out long ago. After 
all, the fundamentalists did not begin waging their war on the 
Algerian authorities just yesterday. 
  To be fair, though, much has already been done. Since 
November 1993 over 1,500 people have been evacuated to Russia. 
The Algerians agreed to reinforce the protection of our 
institutions, and specialists have been transferred away from 
remote locations and housed together. On the other hand, in the 
conditions of what is essentially a civil war, no security 
measures can objectively guarantee the safety of our citizens 
100 percent.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Andrey Varlamov] </F>
  [Text] Tokyo, 1 Apr -- The Liberal Democratic Party of 
Russia [LDPR] advocates cooperation with Japan, and Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy "is not planning any aggressive actions vis-a-vis 
that state." This was stated to ITAR-TASS today by Yevgeniy 
Bolshakov, State Duma deputy from the LDPR, who was the first 
representative of this party to visit Japan at the invitation of 
the Foreign Ministry as a member of the Russian parliamentary 
delegation. The delegation has left for Moscow today after its 
week-long stay here. 
  The deputy said that of all political forces of Japan, the 
LDPR would like to maintain contacts with the LDPR. The program 
of the delegation had included a meeting with representatives of 
that party, which used to be the ruling party in Japan. 
Yevgeniy Bolshakov believes that in the course of this meeting 
"certain mutual understanding of the commonality of partisan 
interests of factions of both parties in their respective 
parliaments" was achieved. "Of course one cannot say that the 
two parties are alike, but it appears that the LDPR and the LDP 
of Japan have common concerns," he believes. 
  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy had extended invitations, via 
Bolshakov, to the leaders of the LDP of Japan to visit the 
congress of the Russian party which begins on 2 April in Moscow. 
However, ITAR-TASS was told in the headquarters of the LDP of 
Japan that no official document inviting party leaders to the 
LDPR forum in Moscow had been received, and doubt was expressed 
as to the feasibility of receiving it before the start of the 
congress. 
  Asked whether the LDPR leader was planning to make a 
personal 
appearance in Tokyo, Yevgeniy Bolshakov said that Zhirinovskiy 
probably intends, in principle, "to take a closer look at 
Japan;" however, there are too many acute problems at home, and 
at least "April and May have been fully booked in his political 
diary."

  [Text] Moscow March 31 TASS -- Russian presidential 
spokesman Vyacheslav Kostikov denied on Thursday [31 March] 
allegations about the existence of a "secret presidential decree 
on the withdrawal of Russian troops from the Kuril islands." 
  The statement to this effect was made by Viktor Ilyukhin, 
head of the State Duma Committee on National Security. 
  Speaking at a press briefing at the Kremlin on Thursday, 
Kostikov said that the decree is not secret and has not been 
published because of it is purely technical nature. 
  The spokesman noted that the decree envisages the withdrawal 
from the Kuril islands of "long-obsolete equipment and the 
maintenance personnel." Additionally, the decree provides for 
better border protection, rather than "surrendering" the islands 
to Japan as the opposition claims.

  [Text] Moscow March 31 TASS -- The Russian Foreign Ministry 
warned Japanese vessels against violating Russia's state border 
and announced its readiness to employ all legal means to prevent 
incidents like that. 
  Addressing today's briefing in Moscow, Foreign Ministry 
spokesman Grigoriy Karasin reported that at 7:30 local time on 
March 30, five Japanese low-tonnage vessels had penetrated for 
5.9 kilometres into Russian territorial waters near the island 
of Anuchin. A patrol ship of the Japanese directorate for 
safety at sea was staying not far off. The captains of the 
Japanese vessels ignored orders to stop given from Russian 
patrol ships and a helicopter. After being chased, the Japanese 
vessels left Russian territorial waters at 9:55. 
  In this connection, the spokesman went on to say, it should 
be recalled that the Russian side has repeatedly drawn Tokyo's 
attention to such violations and pointed to their negative 
effect upon the general atmosphere of Russian-Japanese relations. 
  "Regarding such violations as inadmissible, we insist that 
the Japanese side take necessary measures to prevent them in 
future", Karasin stressed. Russian coast guards will use all 
rights they have under the Russian law "on state border" to 
prevent border violations, he warned.

  [Text] Tokyo March 31 TASS -- The Russian Parliament 
believes that its foreign policy should not be oriented only at 
the West. It should also vigorously develop ties with countries 
of the Asia-Pacific region, specificaly with Japan, Mikhail 
Poltoranin, chairman of the Committee on Information Policy and 
Communications in the State Duma of the Federal Assembly, said 
in an exclusive interview to ITAR-TASS on Thursday [31 March]. 
He arrived in Tokyo at the invitation of the Japanese 
Parliament. 
  Poltoranin said priority in this area should be given to 
contacts at regional level rather than to the development of 
interstate ties where there is more bureaucratism and inertia. 
The initiative of local government bodies should be encouraged 
for which they should be given more rights and greater freedom, 
Poltoranin said. He said there is a need for caution in the 
approach to this process so as not to upset the balance between 
federal structures and local authorities and not to set in 
motion centrifugal forces. 
  Poltoranin told ITAR-TASS that he is to meet Japanese 
Premier 
Morihiro Hosokawa and other Japanese leaders during his visit. 
"I am going to tell the head of the cabinet that it is time for 
Japan to recover form slumber so as not to lag behind other 
states, competitors, that now begin to do business with Russia," 
Poltoranin said. To attract foreign partners, the Russian 
Parliament embarked on drafting a solid legal basis guaraneeing 
protection for foreign investment. A number of draft laws will 
be completed in April or May.

<F P=106> [Interview with W. Hoynck, Secretary General of the CSCE, by </F>
Igor Belov, in Vienna, date not given: "The CSCE: For Security 
from Vancouver to Vladivostok"] 
  [Text] The range of tasks for the first secretary general 
in the history of the CSCE -- 60-year old German diplomat 
Wilhelm Hoynck was elected to the office around a year ago -- is 
quite wide. First and foremost he is expected to provide 
administrative assistance to the chairman of the CSCE Council, 
who is elected for one year from among the member countries' 
foreign ministers. He is empowered to coordinate the 
operations and actions of the peacekeeping missions carried out 
within the CSCE framework and represent the all-Europe structure 
in contacts with other international organizations. On the 
instructions of the CSCE Council chairman the secretary general 
can also put forward political initiatives. 
  Our representative met with Wilhelm Hoynck at the CSCE 
Secretary General's residence in Vienna and asked him to answer 
a number of questions. The first question was this: What are 
the main tasks facing the CSCE this year? 
  [Hoynck] In 1994 we have fundamentally the same aim as last 
year. I have in mind the attempt to make a CSCE contribution to 
the creation of a new degree of stability in the gigantic region 
from Vancouver to Vladivostok. This is a very ambitious 
program, and I think that the CSCE is best suited to show what 
it can do in the sphere of preventing conflicts and in the 
peaceful settlement of crises. But all this must be based on 
the CSCE's efforts to deepen the process of the observance of 
commitments with regard to the human dimension. Only then will 
those structures aimed at ensuring the full respect of human 
rights and basic freedoms and the implementation of the 
principles of democracy and the rule of law really take root. 
This is a great range of tasks in which the CSCE must achieve 
progress. 
  [Belov] How do you assess the new NATO "Partnership for 
Peace" program? Will this program not reduce the CSCE's 
activeness in the efforts to establish a just and lasting peace 
in the general European region? 
  [Hoynck] Assessing the "Partnership for Peace" program is, 
of course, not the prime task of the CSCE secretary general. 
However, I would like to draw attention to the fact that a CSCE 
foreign ministers' joint statement gave the program a 
fundamentally positive assessment. I would also like to refer 
to the statement issued by the NATO countries' heads of state 
and government at their meeting in Brussels at the start of 
January 1994. In that statement the CSCE is again assigned a 
very great role. I want to emphasize that the two documents 
that I cited coincide on the central question. I am talking 
about the principle of the indivisibility of security in Europe. 
I believe this to be of very great significance. It is also 
important that the common concept of security in Europe is built 
on a foundation of cooperation rather than through the buildup 
of countermeasure forces. On this main premise or, if you will, 
philosophical idea it seems to me that NATO and the CSCE adhere 
to the same opinion. In such a system all states will occupy 
the place that suits them and each state individually will be 
able to introduce its own legitimate security interests into the 
system. 
  [Belov] What role might the CSCE play in the matter of 
stabilizing relations among countries within the CIS? How do 
you view the possible participation of Russia's Armed Forces in 
peacemaking missions on former Soviet Union territory? 
  [Hoynck] These two questions are interconnected but have 
different aspects nevertheless. As for the process of 
developing the CIS, it seems to me that it will be stable and 
directed toward the future if all CIS members take greater 
account of the principles elaborated within the CSCE framework. 
There is a wide spectrum of opinions, beginning with the 
catalogue of principles contained in the CSCE's Helsinki Final 
Act. This includes the principles of national sovereignty, the 
inviolability of borders, freedom of the choice of allies or 
freedom not to take part in alliances. I believe that any 
association of states in the region between Vancouver and 
Vladivostok which is founded on voluntary participation and is 
democratically administered would serve to strengthen stability 
in this region. Permit me to emphasize once more: I am 
profoundly convinced that, the more widely the principles of the 
CSCE are applied within the CIS, the firmer and more stable the 
CIS itself will be. 
  Now I should like to talk about the role of the Russian 
Armed 
forces in the peacemaking process. This is a very important and 
very complex question. It is complex for all the participants, 
primarily for those countries where conflicts are taking place 
which those countries themselves are incapable of ending 
independently. This is thus a question of countries which need 
outside help. Without doubt this is a complex question both for 
the Russian leadership, for states which are Russia's neighbors, 
and for all CSCE member countries. It is absolutely clear that 
within the CSCE framework some countries have considerably 
greater potential than others in this respect. It is also clear 
that in the course of conflicts these countries will be dealing 
with a request for help from neighbors near and far. There are 
absolutely obvious examples in this regard. I have in mind 
Georgia and Tajikistan. In both those countries a situation has 
been created which, according to the assessment of those 
countries themselves, could not be resolved without Russia's 
participation. The fact that Georgia and Tajikistan as well as 
the Russian leadership were committed to ensuring that the 
decision to provide assistance did not bear a purely bilateral 
character but was implemented within a multilateral framework 
emphasizes the CSCE's significance. Although from the viewpoint 
of international law help in this aspect could be purely 
bilateral in character. Of course, if such actions are carried 
out within the CSCE framework they must correspond to the CSCE's 
principles. It is also obvious that general powers, a kind of 
carte blanche, cannot be given in this matter but each specific 
opportunity must be examined in specific terms. 
  I am deeply convinced that the real interests of each of the 
states needing help, the interests of Russia and all the other 
CSCE members are best served by the approach in which all such 
measures and events are implemented as part of a multilateral 
process. 
  [Belov] How would you assess relations between the CIS and 
the CSCE? 
  [Hoynck] Mr Ivan Korochen, executive secretary of the CIS, 
recently visited us at our invitation. I would regard that 
visit as one of mutual acquaintance. The meetings between the 
CIS executive secretary and delegations from CSCE countries 
showed that the latter have many questions about the status of 
the CIS and the possibilities of cooperation. The discussions 
showed that the CSCE national delegations understand very well 
that the CIS is a commonwealth of states in development, that 
the commonwealth itself emerged overnight, as it were, in an 
extremely difficult situation for all its members, and that the 
important thing now is that development should proceed in a 
direction corresponding to the principles of the CSCE. I 
believe that such contacts should be developed in the future in 
the interests of "transparency." Then the CIS countries and the 
CIS executive secretariat will have a complete understanding of 
what the CSCE is doing. And the CSCE delegations will deepen 
their knowledge of how matters are developing within the CIS.

  [Text] State Duma's Speaker, Ivan Rybkin, met Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin in Moscow on Thursday. They discussed 
in detail all issues of concern to society, Rybkin told INTERFAX. 
  Rybkin said Yeltsin had given him the draft agreement on 
civil accord in Russia which was still being worked on. Rybkin 
pointed out that no terms had as yet been announced for signing 
the document. He added that there was no reason for hastily 
working out the agreement since it was very important. He 
stressed that a large number of socially significant 
institutions were to sign it -- political parties, religious 
denominations, the government, trade unions, the president and 
the Federal Assembly chambers. 
  Rybkin said the draft agreement would be considered by the 
State Duma's Council next Monday. Thereafter, it is to be 
considered by the parliamentary factions and only then will it 
be submitted at a plenary session of the State Duma. 
  Commenting on the initiative by Kazakh President Nursultan 
Nazarbayev on the establishment of a Eurasian union, Rybkin 
emphasized that the single economic space already provided for 
similar legislation in this sphere. Serious efforts by the CIS 
Parliamentary Assembly are needed to bring the legislation 
together and some new institution like the one which exists in 
the European Union, a kind of common parliament, may be needed. 
  Such a parliament is necessary as a body which will 
coordinate activities of countries seeking closer economic 
cooperation. 
  However, Rybkin believes that the proposal on the 
introduction of a single currency on the territory of the 
Eurasian Union put forward by Nazarbayev is preliminary. Rybkin 
repeated that national currency units existed in the EU 
[European Union] together with the single currency unit -- the 
ECU -- and that this model must not be ignored.

  [Text] Kiev, 31 Mar -- During his visit to Moscow, 
Kazakhstan's President Nursultan Nazarbayev expressed a proposal 
to create a Eurasian union within the framework of which 
supernational bodies would be formed to coordinate economic and 
military policy. Within the framework of this union it is 
necessary to elect a single parliament by way of direct 
elections, to create a council of defense ministers and a single 
defence complex, and also an interstate secretariat, which would 
be appointed by heads of states, Mr. Nazarbayev believes. 
  He stated that the countries, which are in agreement to the 
principles of a Eurasian union, would enter its composition and 
mutual relations would be developed with the other countries of 
the former USSR on a bilateral basis. Nursultan Nazarbayev 
noted that he discussed this issue during talks with Russia's 
President Boris Yeltsin. 
  Commenting on this proposal by the Kazakh president, 
Ukraine's Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko noted: "This is not a 
new idea for us. It has already been put forward. We have 
looked and listened to it closely. However, it if is now an 
official proposal then we should approach it more seriously, 
study it in detail, define our stance, and make an appraisal. 
If this is a Eurasian union, then issues of both a political 
and an economic nature arise as the main factors of future 
cooperation. Therefore, I am not yet ready to give a final 
answer. However, I can say that there should be cooperation in 
the geopolitical space of the former Soviet Union. And this 
cooperation should naturally be initiated on some kind of an 
appropriate basis, but without creating such structures that 
would serve as a supernational body or which would acquire the 
rights of an international subject. One could cooperate on this 
basis. 
  Therefore, Nursultan Nazarbayev's proposal (I think that he 
will make it at the meeting of heads of CIS states on 15 April) 
needs to be studied in more detail."

  [Text] The Belarusian Supreme Soviet has not made any 
decision on the report presented by Alyaksandr Lukashenka, head 
of the temporary legislative anticorruption commission. 
Following examination of the report, none of the proposed draft 
resolutions was adopted. After that, the parliament decided to 
end its session, and the work of Lukashenka's commission as 
well. However, in a conversation with journalists, A. 
Lukashenka stated that the commission will continue to operate 
in spite of the fact that six out of its nine members said they 
no longer want to participate in it. In an interview with a 
BELAPAN correspondent, Belarusian Supreme Soviet Chairman 
Mechyslaw Hryb said that no decision was made with regard to 
Lukashenka's report because the commission failed to present 
deputies with specific evidence proving any wrongdoing on the 
part of officials accused of corruption.

  [Excerpts] Kishinev [Chisinau] 31 March -- The parliament 
of Moldova has today elected Andrei Sangheli, one of the leaders 
of the Agrarian-Democratic Party, which won the parliamentary 
elections, the Republic's prime minister. Voting in favor were 
82 deputies; 15 were opposed. [passage omitted] 
  The new prime minister supports the joining by Moldova of 
the 
CIS and the economic union, as well as restoring and 
strengthening ties with the commonwealth countries since the 
lion's share of Moldovan economy is oriented toward their market. 
  In an interview with an ITAR-TASS correspondent, Andrei 
Sangheli said that the former Cabinet of Ministers had not been 
a team of like-minded persons because it consisted of 
representatives of various parties. In his words, the victory 
of the agrarians in the elections makes it possible to form a 
new government, made up of professionals with a pragmatic 
approach who will speed up the economic reform and bring Moldova 
out of the crisis. 
  The prime minister will submit the list of members of the 
new 
cabinet to the parliament as soon as next week.

  The press service of Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev has

  "I understand that it can become a subject for a serious 
discussion by the heads of state of the Commonwealth

the idea and the proposal which specify the main principles and 
institutions which will underlie the possible formation of the

comprehensive integration of those Commonwealth member-countries 
which wish to join the process of shaping a new inter-state 
formation," Askar Akayev said.

  [Text] Baku, 31 March (TASS) -- The Iranian C-130 military 
cargo plane which crashed over the disputed enclave of Nagorno- 
Karabakh was shot down by two missiles, Iranian senior official 
said. 
  Agai Aminiyan, head of the team of Iranian experts 
investigating the accident, said at a meeting with Azerbaijani 
President Geydar Aliyev in Baku on Thursday that the plane which 
was flying from Moscow to Tehran did not have any serious 
technical flaws which could have caused a crash. It remains 
unclear so far why the plane diverted from the route. 
  Because the planes of this type do not have black boxes, the 
cause may be identified only after deciphering the tapes with 
recordings of the negotiations between the crew and air 
controllers. Iranian experts have already been handed over the 
tapes by Yerevan and Tbilisi and are now seeking to receive 
recordings from Azerbaijan. 
  The Armenian side has not assumed direct responsibility for 
the accident, Aminiyan said. However, it has admitted that its 
troops had taken the Iranian plane for an Azerbaijani craft. 
This can serve as indirect proof that it could have been shot 
down by Armenian troops. Additionally, the Armenian troops do 
not deny that they did not try to get in touch with the plane in 
order to identify it. 
  Aliyev confirmed his readiness to provide the Iranian 
commission with every possible assistance in carrying out the 
investigation.

  [Text] Tbilisi, 31 March (AFP) -- Georgian authorities 
regained control of parliament Thursday a few hours after 
militiamen occupied the building, apparently in protest at the 
appointment of a new interior minister, correspondents on the 
scene said. 
  An inquiry was opened on the reasons for the assault by some 
1,000 protestors, following a call to action by Tbilisi militia 
chief David Zeikidze, with explanations ranging from a personal 
vendetta to a possible coup attempt against President Eduard 
Shevardnadze. 
  A parliamentary spokesman said the protestors, some of them 
armed, were opposing the national assembly's appointment of 
Shota Kviraia as new interior minister a few months after he was 
first named by Shevardnadze. 
  The incident could also be linked to December's fierce fight 
between the ministries of defence and security, when Kviraia was 
acting as deputy minister of security. 
  That conflict sprung from the chaos reigning in the country, 
which is bursting with armed militia, and policy differences 
over the rebel autonomous republic of Abkhazia. 
  According to an AFP journalist in the parliament, 
Shevardnadze was still in the building attending a meeting 
Thursday afternoon. A quarrel broke out in a corridor when the 
president, surrounded by bodyguards, tried to calm Zeikidze and 
his men after they had hit a deputy, the journalist said. 
  Access to the parliament was blocked and security was tight 
throughout the capital Thursday afternoon, the anniversary of a 
1991 referendum on Georgian independence and the birthday of 
former president Zviad Gamsakhurdia, who fled office in January 
1992 and died last December. 
  Demonstrations were expected, in particular around 
Gamsakhurdia's former home on a hill above the capital. 
Security forces were concerned that any protest could spread 
down into the city centre.

Latvian foreign debt up to 31 March of this year has reached 
more than $200 million and not $320 million U.S. dollars, as was

the envisaged foreign country credits not being received during

<F P=106> [BNS report: "World Bank Trusts Lithuanian Government"] </F>
  [Text] VILNIUS, 23 Mar (BNS) -- "The World Bank trusts the 
Lithuanian Government and its policy, even though not everything 
is well there," stated L. (Jeurling), World Bank representative 
in the Baltic states. According to him, the World Bank is 
determined to extend new credits, the first of which will be for 
the restructuring of the banking and finance system. 
  At a press conference on Wednesday [23 March], L. Jeurling 
denied the rumor that the World Bank had ceased the preparation 
of a new loan for the finance sector. According to him, the key 
goal of the bank is to prepare the environment for all foreign 
credits coming into the country. The reorganization of the 
central and commercial banks is a long process, and the World 
Bank has decided not to wait until the entire system changes. 
The World Bank will select a few, in his opinion, most suitable 
commercial banks and participate in lending World Bank finances 
to enterprises. 
  L. Jeurling maintained that the activities of the World Bank 
in Lithuania were the most dynamic among all former USSR 
countries. Currently, the World Bank is actively working on five 
or six new credit projects to finance important efforts in 
agriculture, energy, finance, and environmental protection (a 
water and waste treatment plant in Klaipeda), as well as in 
construction.

  [Text] Moscow 1 April, TASS -- "The agreement on civil 
peace among the main political forces of Russia is planned to be 
signed on 28 April," Russian President Boris Yeltsin told 
ITAR-TASS during the presentation of credentials by several 
foreign ambassadors in the Kremlin today. 
  The president said that the draft text was ready and had 
already been forwarded to the State Duma and the Council of the 
Federation. Now "work will be started with the parties in order 
to reach final agreement on some points." "Not a bad document 
has been drawn up," the president noted. 
  In Yeltsin's opinion, the draft agreement on civilian peace 
would not be published for the time being, because "there may be 
suggestions by this or that party or group." This is why, 
Yeltsin believes, "it would be unethical to publish the document 
now." 
  Yeltsin also said that he would probably discuss the draft 
agreement during his meeting with Yegor Gaydar, expected to take 
place in the Kremlin today.

  [Text] Boris Yeltsin is fully aware of the mood of society 
concerning the possibility of Russia joining NATO's Partnership 
for Peace [PFP] program, the president's press secretary 
Vyacheslav Kostikov said at a briefing in the Kremlin Thursday 
[31 March]. In any case, the president does not intend to be 
hurried and may need six or seven months to make a decision. 
  Kostikov said that special services, the Defense Ministry 
and 
the Foreign Ministry supported the joining of the Partnership 
for Peace program. 
  "The president also recognizes the arguments of the 
opponents 
of this step," Kostikov said. He cited numerous considerations 
which made Yeltsin listen to the views of both the supporters 
and opponents of joining the program. 
  The opponents of the program, said Kostikov, say it does not 
reflect the role played by Russia or its weight in today's 
world. It might result in Russia losing the room to maneuver in 
trouble spots. 
  What is more, the opponents tell the president that Russia 
does not stand to gain anything specific by joining the program. 
  The world community will celebrate the 50th anniversary of 
the landing of allied armies in Europe in World War II this 
year. Russia has not been invited to the opening ceremony. Such 
incidents, Kostikov said, compel Russian opponents of the 
Partnership to press for special conditions to be incorporated 
into the agreement.

  [Text] Moscow, 1 Apr -- According to Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev, Russia will sign the NATO "Partnership for 
Peace" program this month, as planned. 
  Answering journalists' questions at the airport while 
meeting 
UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, Andrey Kozyrev 
indicated that there had been no changes in Russia's stance. 
Referring to the statements made yesterday by the president's 
press secretary to the effect that several months would be 
needed to resolve this issue, Kozyrev said he was probably 
talking about implementing the document rather than signing it.

Anna Melnikova] 
  [Text] Moscow 31 March, TASS -- "For Russia to join the 
NATO Partnership for Peace initiative, a consensus of the entire 
society will be needed. Otherwise, damage will be done to civic 
accord. This process may take six to seven months," Russian 
Presidential Spokesman Vyacheslav Kostikov said. 
  Speaking at a press briefing at the Kremlin on Thursday, 
Kostikov said, quoting President Boris Yeltsin's opinion, that 
the "Partnership for Peace formula does not quite correspond to 
the magnitude and the political and military might of Russia." 
  Joining the alliance will narrow down Russia's possibilities 
for manoeuvering in settling conflicts, Kostikov continued. 
Additionally, Russia's accession to the bloc could limit its 
rights in arms trade. Therefore, the president believes that 
certain conditions should be agreed before Russia joins the NATO 
Partnership for Peace programme in order to determine the pluses 
of such a move for Russia, the spokesman added. 
  Kostikov said the sincerity of the Partnership for Peace 
authors has been called into doubt by the NATO decision to 
celebrate the 50th anniversary of the opening of the second 
front in the World War II without Russia's participation.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Konstantin Pribytkov] </F>
  [Text] Geneva, March 31 (TASS) -- Talks on complete and 
universal nuclear test-ban began "in a good tempo". "Of course, 
we would like to move toward our goal more swiftly, but, since 
this forum is multilateral and positions of all the states have 
to be taken into account, one may say that the start was good 
enough," Grigory Berdennikov, permanent Russian representative 
to the United Nations, commented om the results of the first 
meeting of the annual session of UN conference on disarmament, 
which concluded here on Thursday. 
  Participants in the conference worked out a convention on 
prohibition of chemical weapons in 1992 and in January 1994 
proceeded to prepare a multilateral agreement on complete 
nuclear test-ban. 
  Although the UN General Assembly unanimously supported the 
idea of beginning such multilateral talks in December 1993, 
representatives of 37 member states which participate in the 
conference are fully aware that they will have to face many 
stumbling blocks on their way to mutual accord. Control over 
the would-be agreement poses a most difficult problem. 
  Discussions on total test-ban have been going on for 
decades. 
The treaty banning nuclear-weapon tests in the atmosphere, in 
outer space and under water, signed in Moscow in 1963, was a 
landmark agreement. 
  Russian participants in the Geneva meeting proposed that 
this 
treaty and other international agreements form a basis for 
defining the sphere of application of the would-be agreement on 
complete and universal nuclear test-ban, which should include a 
ban on underground nuclear-weapon tests. 
  They declared for interminable and indiscriminate nature of 
the treaty, for equality of rights and responsibilities of all 
the parties. 
  In Russia's opinion, an effective mechanism of international 
control over the treaty is needed; not only the nuclear powers, 
but also the countries, which are capable of creating nuclear 
weapons, should get involved. 
  Russia declared also for envisaging strict measures to be 
taken against violators, including the sanctions specified in 
the UN charter. 
  How much time will it take to work out the document? The 
Chinese representatives believe, that the work may be completed 
by 1996. 
  "In our opinion, it would be better to accelerate (the 
procedures) and coordinate, at least, major provisions by the 
spring of 1995, that is, before the conference on the treaty of 
nuclear non-proliferation begins," Berdennikov told ITAR-TASS. 
  "So far, there is no standard wording (of the would-be 
agreement). We hope, that it will be worked out in the 
forthcoming sessions. To this effect, however, we shall have to 
pass through the current preliminary stage, when the 
participants state their positions," he concluded. 
  The session of the UN conference on disarmament is to resume 
its work in Geneva next May.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Nursultan Nazarbayev Suggests </F>
Creating Eurasian Union Out of CIS States"] 
  [Text] Kazakhstani President Nursultan Nazarbayev has put 
forward a proposal to create a completely new association out of 
the CIS countries and call it the Eurasian Union. If this idea 
does not meet with extensive support within the CIS, Russia and 
Kazakhstan could form this union, he said during a meeting with 
Moscow State University teaching staff and students during his 
official visit to Russia. 
  The Eurasian Union must be based, according to Nursultan 
Nazarbayev, on totally different principles from the CIS. They 
must be founded on the formation of national bodies with a view 
to coordinating economic, defense, and foreign policy. A 
Council of Eurasian Union Heads of State and Government must be 
set up to discuss strategic issues. The next step would be 
direct elections to a common parliament to coordinate the 
legislative activity of countries within the Eurasian Union. 
The creation of a real military complex necessitates the 
founding of a council of defense ministers, while the 
coordination of actions in the world arena necessitates the 
formation of a council of foreign ministers. A standing 
interstate executive secretariat must also be created for the 
Eurasian Union, whose membership would be appointed by the heads 
of state, comprising representatives of all the union's 
countries. This executive committee should have observer status 
at the United Nations and the CSCE. 
  According to Nursultan Nazarbayev, the creation of a 
Eurasian 
Union entails the introduction of a common identity card or 
citizenship for all countries in the union, mandatory 
formulation of coordinated economic reform programs, and the 
adoption of a supranational currency. 
  The Kazakhstani president went on to develop his idea by 
drawing attention to the need for a single information office 
for the executive secretariat. "Information must not be 
unfriendly; an agreement must be signed within the Eurasian 
Union to this effect," he stressed. A council for education, 
culture, and science must also be set up in order to shape a 
coordinated educational policy and defend and implement the 
rights of national minorities. 
  Membership of the Eurasian Union, Nursultan Nazarbayev 
continued, should not hamper bilateral relations with third 
countries. The union's basic principle is "equality, respect 
for the sovereignty and independence of states, the rights of 
the individual, and the individuality of every state." Everyone 
who shares these principles can be members of the Eurasian 
Union, the Kazakhstani leader said. 
  Nursultan Nazarbayev emphasized that there is no question in 
this case of reviving the old Soviet Union and forming an 
empire. There is no need to be afraid of the word "union," he 
said; there is after all the European Union, for instance. "We 
are all equal and my current visit to Russia marks recognition 
of that equality," the president indicated. 
  Today the Kazakhstani president laid a wreath at the Tomb of 
the Unknown Soldier at the Kremlin Wall.

  [Text] Baku March 31 TASS -- Azerbaijan welcomes any steps 
aimed at reaching a peaceful settlement of the 
Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict, Azerbaijani parliament chairman 
Rasul Guliyev said. 
  The announcement was made at a meeting with a CIS 
inter-parliamentary delegation led by Kyrgyz parliament chairman 
Medetkan Sherimkulov that arrived in Baku on Thursday. 
  Guliyev praised their peace mission seeking to "untie the 
Karabakh knot," adding that Azerbaijan's position remains 
unchanged -- it stands for peaceful solution of all disputable 
questions that have piled up over the years of confrontation. 
  Shirimkulov said that the current visit to Baku is the 
continuation of the extensive mediatory work started in 
September 1993 by the CIS inter-parliamentary assembly. It has 
already organised a meeting between Azerbaijani and Armenian 
parliamentarians in Finland. Another such meeting, this time 
with the participation of representatives of the disputed 
enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, is expected to take place in 
Bishkek in early May. 
  "Our aim is to help the sides bridge the gap between their 
positions and find a way out of the crisis," Shirimkulov said. 
He added that the CIS countries are interested in restoring 
peace in the trans-Caucasus. 
  Early on Friday the delegation will meet with deputy 
parliament chairman Afiyaddin Dzhalilov and will be received by 
Azerbaijani President Heydar Aliyev at noon. After the talks 
the delegation will fly to Stepanakert, capital of 
Nagorno-Karabakh.

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow April 1 TASS -- The NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA 
carries an article entitled "Radical Democrats Have Created 
Their Own Party. Gaidar Hopes To Win Support of President 
Yeltsin and Major Financial Groups", which says that "evidently, 
by holding a news conference devoted to the final stage of the 
creation of the "Russia's Choice" party Gaydar and his allies, 
Anatoliy Chubays, Anatoliy Pristavkin and Sergey Kovalev, 
intended not only to convince all those interested of bright 
prospects of this organisation, but show its present powerful 
organisational and intellectual potential. This has been 
demonstrated by a statement made by founders of the party and 
circulated at a news conference on Thursday, which was signed by 
over a hundred prominent public figures. 
  The newspaper carries an interview with chairman of the 
Georgian temporary committee for emergency situations, Jaba 
Ioseliani, who declared that "Abkhazian claims to create an 
independent state do not conform to existing realities. It is 
unnatural that 20,000 Abkhazians dictate their will to the 
predominantly Georgian population numbering around 500,000. 
This is not the right basis for building up a state, all the 
more so, because 5 million more Georgians are residing in the 
neighbouring state. This is absurd... The results of the 
Georgian-Abkhazian conflict which led to a bloody war suit no 
one today. Naturally, Georgia is not satisfied either... I 
repeat what I said many times before: Georgia's enemies cannot 
be Russia' patriots, they are its enemies ..., destroying what 
was created over centuries for the sake of present-day 
advantages. These people are "temporary", Ioseliani said. 
  The results of an election campaign in subjects of the 
Russian Federation are published on the front page of the 
ROSSIYSKIE VESTI Newspaper. The newspaper Says that "elections 
held in Russia's regions on March 27, showed several tendencies. 
An opinion was confirmed that public and political forces 
centered in Moscow did not show a profound interest in these 
elections. In fact, the struggle for regions between political 
parties has not begun yet," the newspaper said. 
  The TRUD daily carries an article by an academician of the 
Russian Academy of Education, Igor Bestuzhev-Lada, who says that 
"now and then, both branches of the executive power tell us that 
the situation is under control and whatever happens is for the 
better in the best of these worlds. However, we see for 
ourselves that the situation continues to deteriorate and there 
are no real signs of improvement or even stabilisation or 
deterrence of collapse in the foreseeable future. In my 
opinion, civic accord must begin not from a 'non-attack treaty' 
(since politicians who cease to attack each other are no longer 
politicians), but from real political programmes which could 
unite broad enough circles of the population and party forces, 
reflecting their interests," Bestuzhev-Lada said. 
  The VECHERNIY PETERSBURG newspaper writes that a 
coordinative 
council for fighting drug mafia and drug business was set up at 
the St. Petersburg mayor's office. The council was established 
because St. Petersburg is turning into one of European centers 
of drug business since its location is convenient for transit of 
drugs from Asia to Scandinavian countries and the Baltic states. 
The actual number of drug addicts in St. Petersburg varies from 
80,000 to 250,000, interior officials said. 
  The newspaper ST. PETERBURGSKIYE VEDOMOSTI reports that a 
regional branch strike committee was established at a meeting of 
St. Petersburg and the Leningrad region trade union leaders to 
coordinate mass actions of the working people in defence of 
their rights. The first action taken by the committee, 
addressed to the Federal Assembly, the president and the 
government, is a demand to change the course of reforms in the 
interests of economic growth of the country and give a realistic 
figure of the minimum subsistence level of the population.

    [Editorial Report] Moscow Ostankino Television First 
Channel Network in Russian at 1700 GMT on 2 April carries the 
"Novosti" newscast presented by Sergey Medvedev. 
  Over video clips of past CIS summit meetings and President 
Nazarbayev's visit to Russia, Medvedev says President Nursultan 
Nazarbayev's three-day official visit, "did yield one surprise, 
namely the suggestion to set up in place of the CIS, which is 
not working, a new state association with a single parliament, a 
council of defense ministers, common borders, and a 
supranational currency. Evidently understanding that the ground 
had not been prepared for any discussion of these topics in 
Russia and its sovereign neighbors, Nazarbayev described his 
initiative as not a formal proposal, but just an idea. This is 
why it was aired not at the official negotiations in the 
Kremlin, but on the second day of his visit, at a meeting with 
the intelligentsia in Moscow State University -- though 
doubtless Kazakhstan's leader could not but have shared his new 
ideas with Boris Yeltsin during the talks. It is interesting 
why Nazarbayev decided, without mentioning the Russian 
president's reaction, to appeal to public opinion. 
  "The idea has been voiced, and it is giving rise to more 
questions than answers. The Russian Foreign Ministry, for 
instance, is unclear what would happen if a Eurasian Union were 
set up in place of the CIS, which has just obtained the status 
of observer at the United Nations." 
  Medvedev points out the principles underlying the European 
Union cannot simply be transferred to a Eurasian version, and 
the right of veto, which it is suggested each sovereign member 
state would have, is unlikely to meet with acceptance. Given 
the level of the current disagreements in the CIS, such a right 
could paralyze any new collective body, and it would hardly be 
possible to reach agreement on anything. 
  Surveying the reactions to the new proposal for a Eurasian 
Union in CIS capitals, Medvedev switches to an interview with 
President Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine. The idea, President 
Kravchuk said, was discussed when the CIS was set up, and is 
still being developed within the context of the CIS. "But," 
Kravchuk says, "I do not think we should disband the CIS today. 
I believe that if the task of setting up a Eurasian Union is 
set, the CIS should prepare the conditions for this." "All this 
must be studied very attentively" and properly prepared, 
President Kravchuk says. 
  Over a photograph of President Akayev, Medvedev says, 
"President Askar Akayev of Kyrgyzstan was one of the few to give 
immediate support to the idea of setting up a Eurasian Union. 
He regards it as promising." 
  Myacheslaw Gryb, chairman of the Supreme Soviet of Belarus, 
interviewed in the Soviet chamber, said: "I am familiar with the 
proposals put forward by President Nursultan Nazarbayev. We 
find them politically interesting, to a certain degree, and 
without doubt merit attention, a great deal of attention. But 
in this respect I see that we must, first of all, resolve issues 
of economic cooperation, of economic integration between our 
state, the Republic of Belarus, and the member states of the 
CIS, first and foremost with the Russian Federation. This could 
be the second stage, because today, as far as I surmise, we are 
not yet ready to settle this question." 
  "President Islam Karimov of Uzbekistan believes that the 
CIS's potential is far from exhausted, and it is better to 
expend one's efforts on making the existing union work than on 
creating a new one," Medvedev concludes.

  [Text] Moscow April 3 TASS -- Belarus will act as a 
mediator in the settlement of the Karabakh conflict at a meeting 
of Azeri and Armenian parliamentarians scheduled in Bishkek in 
May. The meeting will be attended by chairman of the Belarusian 
Parliament, Mechyslaw Hryb. This was declared at a meeting of 
the Belarusian parliament chairman with a peace-keeping group of 
the CIS intreparliamentary assembly which arrived in Minsk from 
Yerevan on Sunday morning, following trips to Baku and 
Nagorno-Karabakh. 
  "The arrival of the peace-keeping group in Minsk and a 
meeting with the head of the Belarusian parliament was not 
spontaneous," Medetkan Sherimkulov, head of the CIS 
intreparlaimentary delegation and chairman of the Kyrgyz 
Parliament, told ITAR-TASS on Sunday night after the delegation 
returned from Minsk to Moscow. "Belarus is one of active 
participants of the CIS interparliamentary assembly." He said, 
according to Sherimkulov, in order to establish peace in the 
Karabakh region, all CIS countries should be interested in the 
mediatory mission. 
  In Sherimkulov's opinion, Belarus has concrete proposals 
which will be discussed in Bishkek early in May. Commenting on 
the results of the visit by the CIS interparliamentary 
peace-keeping delegation to the Caucasus, Sherimkulov said that 
heads of the Azeri and Armenian Parliaments agreed to take part 
in the Bishkek meeting. Sherimkulov did not rule out the 
possibility of Karabakh officials taking part in the meeting. 
  Shermkulov said that the main condition for the settlement 
of 
the Karabakh crisis is "a total ceasefire in the zone of the 
conflict." Sherimklov said that CIS parliamentarians are 
interested in the solution of the problem of the political 
status of Nagorno-Karabakh, removal of blockade, restoration of 
Karabakh infrastructure, including a gas pipe-line, railways and 
highways and the return of refugees to their homes. 
  Asked by ITAR-TASS about prospects for the participation of 
CIS peace-keeping forces in the disengagement of warring sides, 
Sherimkulov pointed out that "we cannot put the responsibility 
for peace-keeping efforts on Russia alone." "The number of 
peace-keepers and a degree of participation of CIS peace-keeping 
units has not been discussed yet," Sherimkulov said. "What is 
important at the present stage is that all CIS member-states 
express readiness to promote the establishment of peace in 
Nagorno-Karabakh," he added.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Gondusov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 2 Apr -- In the long run there will be no 
groups of Russian border troops in the CIS states. They will be 
replaced with operational groups consisting of a small number of 
officers and specialists whose task will be to help the local 
troops responsible for protecting the border, Colonel General 
Andrey Nikolayev, commander in chief of the Russian border 
troops, told an ITAR-TASS correspondent last night on his return 
from Bishkek. 
  He said the accords signed in Bishkek have created a legal 
foundation for Commonwealth citizens serving in Russia's border 
troops. Over the next few years they will account for 30 to 50 
percent of the personnel. 
  A. Nikolayev said that during his conversation with Kirgiz 
President Askar Akayev questions of training national cadres 
were discussed, along with additional measures for strengthening 
the border between Kirgizia [Kyrgyzstan] and Afghanistan. They 
also worked out a unified border policy. The border troops 
commander stressed that, as before, his views on ensuring 
security on the Commonwealth borders coincided with those of 
President Akayev and other heads of state. 
  A. Nikolayev said that additional measures aimed at 
stabilizing the situation on the Tajik-Afghan section of the 
border would be discussed at a conference of the Commonwealth 
heads of state scheduled for the middle of April. He expressed 
his satisfaction at the fact that a government delegation from 
Tajikistan is to have a meeting in Moscow with opposition 
leaders. However, in the opinion of the border troops chief 
commander, a disruption of the dialogue or reluctance on the 
part of one of the sides to continue it may result in a fresh 
escalation of tension in Tajikistan and on the Tajik-Afghan 
border.

  [Text] Moscow April 2 TASS--ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI singles out a 
draft document "On the Attainment of Civil Accord", handed over 
by President Boris Yeltsin to the State Duma and Federation 
Council speakers on Thursday. 
  In the opinion of presidential press secretary Vyacheslav 
Kostikov, "the principal goal of this agreement among political 
forces" is to preserve the already existing elements of civil 
peace in the country. 
  The newspaper quotes Russian Vice-Premier Aleksandr Shokhin 
as stating that "immediate prospects for Russia's economic 
development are moderately optimistic." 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (Red Star) carries a big article in view of 
the expected signing by government leaders of CIS member-states 
of an agreement on the mutual recognition of the privileges and 
guarantees for world war two veterans and the disabled and 
participants in combat operations on the territories of other 
states, the families of the fallen servicemen and other 
categories of persons. The agreement is expected to be signed 
in mid-April. 
  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA reports that a number of gangs engaging 
in criminal activities connected with the search of privatised 
apartments and their resale have been uncovered in Moscow. 
  About 9,000 Muscovites, who have been reported missing, 
could 
fall victim to those gangs, the newspaper writes referring to 
the data of Moscow police headquarters as of January 1, 1994. 
All missing persons on the eve of their disappearance 
registered documents certifying the privatisation of their 
apartments. 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA (independent newspaper) reports a "boom 
in the illegal production of gold and diamonds" in the country. 
  The newspaper quotes A. Alexeyev, a staff member of the 
Russian Interior Ministry's main department for combatting 
economic crimes, as saying that one can now speak about the 
existence of a veritable industry in Russia for the illegal 
production, processing and marketing of gold and diamonds. 
  Criminals "are busy actively establishing contacts with 
state 
machinery officials and foreign counterparts and arranging 
channels for the 'export'" of Russian valuables", Alexeyev said. 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA reports a statement by U.N. 
Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, who began his five-day 
visit to Moscow on Friday, that he is grateful to Boris Yeltsin 
for the success of Russian diplomacy in settling the Yugoslav 
crisis. 
  At the same time, the newspaper believes, there is no 
"complete mutual understanding" between the sides, considering 
the stand of the U.N. chief, who issued an order to launch 
bombing strikes against the Bosnian Serbs, and the stand of 
Moscow which, acting virtually alone, prevented that". Neither 
is the U.N. secretary-general willing to understand Russia's 
intention to get a U.N. mandate for its peacekeeping force on 
the territory of the CIS, the newspaper pointed out. 
  PRAVDA gives prominence to a report on a new party, Russia's 
Choice, which is being created by former Vice-Premier Yegor 
Gaydar. The newspaper believes that this, in all probability, 
will be the first party of big bourgeoisie, and predicts that 
the new party will suffer a setback at future elections.

<F P=106> [Report by the Press Center of Ukraine's Supreme Council: </F>
"A Meeting With Members of Parliament of the Russian 
Federation"] 
  [Text] Chairman of Ukraine's Supreme Council I.S. Plyushch 
met with the chairman of the Russian Federation State Duma 
Committee for CIS Issues and Ties With Compatriots, K.F. 
Zatulin, and with a member of the Committee for International 
Issues, S.B. Stankevych. They are presently in Ukraine as 
official observers at the new parliamentary elections. 
  During the friendly and open conversation, topical issues of 
Ukrainian-Russian relations and the development of ties between 
CIS countries were discussed. It was stressed that they must be 
based upon the principles of equal partnership and mutually 
advantageous economic cooperation and must promote the 
development of friendship between the peoples of our countries. 
  The chairman of the Supreme Council spoke about the 
situation 
in the country and the course of the political reforms. He 
pointed out, in particular, that the elections of Ukraine's 
people's deputies had been democratic and that the citizens had 
played a full part. There are reasons to believe that, 
following the run-off elections in those electoral districts 
where candidates did not receive sufficient votes, there will be 
a new parliament in Ukraine. 
  The guests asked about the preparation for presidential 
elections and elections to local government. Having explained 
his position on the expediency of holding the elections in 
accordance with the time-table specified by the Supreme Council, 
Plyushch pointed out that the political reforms and the 
democratic processes that are under way will help stabilize the 
situation in society and will promote the country's emergence 
from the crisis. If these processes are hampered, something in 
which some political forces are interested, it will not be for 
the good of the people. 
  An exchange of opinions was also held on the further 
development of interparliamentary ties. 
  Ambassador of the Russian Federation in Ukraine L.Ya. 
Smolyakov also took part in the conversation.

  [Text] Kiev -- A joint news conference by Anatoliy Zlenko 
and Andre Ouellet, the Ukrainian and Canadian foreign ministers, 
took place at Ukraine's Foreign Ministry on 1 April. 
  Andre Ouellett announced a package of Canadian aid to 
Ukraine 
valuing $15 million to support the dismantlement of nuclear 
weapons and ensure nuclear safety. This package is a part of 
Canadian aid to Ukraine. "Canada is taking on a commitment to 
cooperate with Ukraine in strengthening international stability 
and security. This package will help Ukraine, guided by the 
experience of Canadian experts, to dispose of nuclear weapons," 
Andre Ouellett reported. 
  The head of the Foreign Ministry noted that Canada would 
assist in integrating Ukraine into the European Community, would 
help to take the appropriate measures for its accession to the 
GATT, would support Ukraine in cooperation with the IMF, and 
would also demand that the issue of support for Ukraine by the 
international community be examined at a sitting of the "Great 
Seven." As regards Canada's mediation, Andre Ouellett noted 
that "there is no necessity for this, because Ukraine will be 
able to defend itself." 
  Anatoliy Zlenko expressed gratitude to Canada's foreign 
minister for supporting Ukraine in the international arena and 
noted that Canadian-Ukrainian relations have great potential 
possibilities, especially in the field of military-political and 
trade and economic cooperation. "It is important to us to have 
partnership relations with Canada, the prestige of which is very 
influential in the world," he stressed.

  [Text] Kiev, 1 Apr -- The Canadian Government is allocating 
15 million Canadian dollars to assist Ukraine in dismantling 
nuclear weapons and ensuring nuclear safety. This was stated 
today at a joint news conference with Ukraine's Foreign Affairs 
Minister Anatoliy Zlenko by his Canadian counterpart Andre 
Ouellett who is in Ukraine on an official visit. He stressed 
that this aid package is part of the West's efforts to assist in 
ridding Ukraine of nuclear weapons, and of support for its 
adherence to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. 
  "Canada undertakes to cooperate closely with Ukraine in 
strengthening international stability and security," the 
Canadian minister said. This package will help Ukraine to get 
rid of nuclear weapons by introducing the experience of Canadian 
experts in the sphere of such pressing problems as the skillful 
utilization of nuclear waste, the rehabilitation of the 
environment, and the development of civilian nuclear systems 
that are dangerous." Andre Ouellett said that the package of 
assistance in dismantling nuclear weapons is part of the 
Canadian program of technical and humanitarian assistance to 
Ukraine. It has been created to support Ukraine's changeover to 
the market economy, to promote the development of democracy, and 
to expand trade and investment ties between Ukraine and Canada. 
  To date, more than 60 projects in such priority areas as 
environmental protection, public health, strengthening the 
private sector, and the development of democracy have been 
approved. Andre Ouellett also said that he regards his visit to 
Ukraine as extremely successful. Important talks were held with 
Ukraine's President Leonid Kravchuk, Foreign Affairs Ministers 
Anatoliy Zlenko, Oleh Slepichev, external economic relations 
minister, and Economy Minister Roman Shpek. A number of joint 
documents were signed determining the further development and 
expansion of political, economic, and trade relations between 
the two countries. 
  In the course of the visit, several cardinal projects of 
Canadian aid to Ukraine were announced. Their total value is 
assessed at 27 million Canadian dollars. 
  "The history of our relations is an excellent example of an 
international policy of mutual understanding and partnership," 
Anatoliy Zlenko stressed at a news conference. "Ukraine will 
also remember and highly value the fact that Canada was the 
first among the Western countries to recognize independent 
Ukraine and established diplomatic relations with it. We are 
grateful to Canada for its support for our state in the 
international arena. During our conversation Andre Ouellett and 
I discussed a wide range of issues among which: Nuclear 
disarmament, conversion, economic and trade ties, and the 
present-day political situation. It is pleasant to note that we 
reached mutual understanding on virtually all issues. The 
documents signed are proof of our resolve to continue developing 
mutually advantageous relations. For us it is very important to 
have in Canada a reliable partner. That is why we have signed 
perhaps for the first time in international practice a document 
entitled `Declaration on Special Partner Relations Between 
Ukraine and Canada.' We are looking with optimism to the future 
of our relations and believe they will benefit our two friendly 
peoples," Anatoliy Zlenko stated.

  [Text] Members of the European Union Commission have ended 
a fact finding mission to Ukrainian nuclear power plants by 
concluding that Kiev needs assistance in setting up a national 
training center, special literature and equipment for personnel 
training. They recommend that G-7 countries provide appropriate 
technical assistance to Ukraine. 
  The delegation visited nuclear power plants at Chernobyl, 
Zaporozhiye and Rovno and met representatives of the 
Yuzhno-Ukrainsk and Khmelitsk stations. 
  At a final meeting with officials of the Ukrainian state 
committee for nuclear energy (Gosatom), Commission members 
praised the Ukrainian system of personnel training, though the 
training scheme for operational and maintenance staff was based 
on outdated methods and instructions worked out while the former 
Soviet Union still existed. 
  Gosatom deputy head Nur Nigmatulin said that many of the 
mistakes could be avoided if local nuclear power plants had 
"full-scale accident simulators", but there was only one 
simulator, at the Zaporozhiye plant. However, he said the basic 
training scheme was in many ways superior to its western 
counterpart. 
  At the same time, Nigmatulin said that Ukraine was soon 
expected to receive such kits for the Rovno and Yuzhno-Ukrainsk 
plants, largely due to help from the French government. Twelve 
instructors will undergo training this year.

  [Text] Ukraine has fulfilled its obligation before Russia 
to pay by April 1 $100 million for Russian gas supplies, 
Ukrainian Vice-Premier Valentin Landik told the Interfax-Ukraine 
news agency on April 1. He said that the last $15 million were 
remitted on Thursday. 
  Landik noted that from now on Ukraine plans to pay for 
Russian gas once a decade. 
  Landik also said that the Ukrainian president would issue a 
decree soon on setting up the open joint stock company 
Ukrneftegaz with a controlling package of shares belonging to 
Ukraine. He added that Kiev "can consider Russia's stake in 
privatization of Ukrneftegaz not more than 30 percent." 
  According to Landik, Ukraine intends to offer its 
participation in privatization of oil and gas extraction 
enterprises in Russia. "Thus, nobody can reproach us that we are 
selling off Ukraine," he said. 
  Landik said that in April "the government will still be 
warning Ukrainian enterprises about the possibility of cutting 
off Russian gas supplies, and then the Russian Gazprom, not me, 
will cut off supplies." 
  It is expected that talks on gas supplies between the 
government delegations of Ukraine and Russia will resume on 
April 10.

<F P=106> [From 4 April EESTI SENUMID, PAEVALEHT, pp 1,3,5; "News </F>
Bulletin" No. 63/94] 
  [Text] A Russian border guard was killed and two others 
injured near the Koidula border checkpoint on April 1 as they 
attempted to detain two suspected illegal border crossers. 
  The two were stopped on the Russian side of the border at 
03.50 by a three-man patrol, which called a car from the guard 
station. The criminals unexpectedly opened fire and escaped. 
The Russian border guard failed to determine whether they 
crossed the border or remained to the Russian side. 
  The Estonian border guard was immediately informed of the 
incident and closed all roads leading inland. The police, the 
Home Guard and the Defence League were also mobilised in the 
search. 
  The Russian Foreign Ministry called Estonian Ambassador Juri 
Kahn to the ministry and handed over an appeal to the Estonian 
law enforcement agencies for help in finding the killers. The 
Russian side is convinced in a criminal nature of the incident 
and does not consider it a provocation, Kahn announced. 
  President Lennart Meri phoned Russian Ambassador Aleksandr 
Trofimov on April 1 and asked the ambassador to relay his 
condolences to the family of the killed border guard. The 
President also assured the Russian Ambassador of Estonia's 
cooperation in search of the criminals. 
  The Estonian Interior Ministry considers it possible that 
the 
men may have been illegal arms dealers. The pistols used were 
"TT", an outdated Soviet army pistol. Thousands of pistols of 
that make have been imported in Estonia recently and the police 
suspects that the weapons are meant for the Russian underground. 
  The Defence Police announced of the arrest of a 
forty-year-old man connected with an attempt to transport a 
large number of "TT" pistols to Russia.

program] 
  [Text] Yuriy Pikul, general director of the Estonian 
Security Police, accused Russian military unit commanders 
deployed in the territory and senior officers at the Tallinn 
garrison of trading in radioactive materials. He said that at 
least five highly radioactive articles made of metal were sold 
to the West from Estonia. He explained how the command of the 
[place-name indistinct] harbor in Tallinn sold two air-cushion 
vessels for scrap whose engine components emitted 200 roentgens 
per hour of radioactivity. Specialists consider a person's 
unprotected exposure to such a source of radioactivity for three 
hours to be lethal. After the vessels were scrapped, the metal 
was sold to Finland. However, several turbine sections 
containing radioactive cobalt disappeared without a trace. 
  According to the statement made by Viktor Mikhaylovich Krug, 
assistant to the chief military procurator, the Russian 
Federation military procuracy possesses no facts or material 
concerning the sale by the Northern Group of Forces of 
components or other items containing radioactive isotopes. For 
its part, the Russian Federation military procuracy is prepared 
to begin the immediate investigation of such a situation.

  [Text] The Estonian Interior Ministry is interested in 
bilateral cooperation agreements with Russia concerning 
operations against crime, Interior Minister Heiki Arike said. 
But he added that Estonia will not sign agreements concerning 
all CIS states. 
  Arike added that he had discussed the need for continued 
negotiations with Russian Ambassador Aleksandr Trofimov 
recently. He hoped that the talks between ministries will lead 
to an agreement between the governments. 
  Russia had so far favoured only agreements signed within the 
CIS framework and concerning all member states, Arike explained. 
He said that the Interior Ministry is cooperating efficiently 
with Finland, Sweden, Germany, Great Britain and Italy.

<F P=106> [Report attributed to BNS: "L. Linkevicius Withdraws From </F>
Seimas National Security Committee"] 
  [Text] National Defense Minister L. Linkevicius has stated 
that he considers his further presence in the Seimas 
[parliament] National Security Committee "unnecessary." In his 
application to Seimas Chairman C. Jursenas and J. Karosas, 
leader of the Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party faction, the 
minister requests to be removed from the list of committee 
members and expresses the desire to return to the Foreign 
Affairs Committee. 
  L. Linkevicius said in an interview with a BNS correspondent 
that he did not approve of the committee's work methods and the 
understanding of its functions in many cases. The minister 
thinks that the interpretation of the principle of parliamentary 
control is not always correct in Lithuania. "This is not 
leading someone by the hand and adopting decisions for the 
executive sector," said the minister. He admitted that he 
himself had a chance to experience such deputies' ambitions. 
  Concerning his desire to return to the Foreign Affairs 
Committee, in the minister's opinion, his work at the National 
Defense Ministry is closely linked with foreign policy.

  [Text] Vilnius, April 1, ELTA -- Lithuanian Deputy Defence 
Minister Sarunas Vasiliauskas was dismissed from his post at his 
own will. He had occupied this post since the establishment of 
the ministry and had been responsible for the ministry budget 
and provisions. 
  According to Vasiliauskas, no disagreements had been between 
him and the former and present ministers. "I could not do my job 
very good with such small sums of money the ministry had," 
Vasiliauskas told ELTA. 
  Last year, for example, the ministry was allotted 131 
million 
litas to maintain the people. The only way out, according to 
Vasiliauskas, was to diminish the defence system. 
  Vasiliauskas admitted that he did not envy the one who would 
occupy his former post. Vasiliauskas is going to have a private 
job.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Fedor Angeliy] </F>
  [Text] Kishinev [Chisinau], 2 Apr -- A CSCE mission 
believes that if the Republic of Moldova wants to move forward 
in the cause of unity, then it is in its own interests that it 
should build a reputation as a state committed to tolerance and 
bilingualism. Today, the CSCE mission published its report on 
the language problem in Moldova in the republic's press. 
  The document notes that the questions of whether to call its 
official language Moldovan or Romanian, and whether to use the 
Latin or the Cyrillic script lies within Moldova's jurisdiction. 
Moldova is to a large extent a bilingual country. It would, 
therefore, be both a pragmatic step and a magnanimous gesture if 
Russian were made the other official language alongside 
Romanian, the document says. 
  CSCE experts believe that it was pragmatism that prompted 
the 
Moldovan Parliament to give Russian the status of the language 
of interethnic communication. They believe that making 
provisions for the use of the official language and the language 
of interethnic communication throughout Moldova is quite 
sufficient to guarantee the rights of the Russian speakers.

<F P=106> [Report by Semen Matrosov in the "Dniester Region" column: </F>
"The Scandal Around the Local `Cheka' Chief Is Growing"] 
  [Text] Colonel Mikhail Bergman, commandant of the Tiraspol 
garrison of the 14th Russian Army, appeared on the local 
commercial Asket TV channel with charges against General Vadim 
Shevtsov, former security minister and currently chief of the 
Dniester Republic Security Committee. In particular Bergman 
presented a copy of a document on service investigation into the 
case of Major Antyufeyev (Vadim Shevtsov's real name -- 
SEGODNYA) as an officer of the Riga OMON special police force. 
This document, signed by Shteynbrik, then head of the Latvian 
Internal Affairs Ministry, attributes a number of official 
misdemeanors to Antyufeyev. In addition, Colonel Bergman showed 
TV viewers a documentary film about the involvement of the 
Dniester Moldovan Republic's security officers, including 
Shevtsov, in the October 1993 events in Moscow. 
  The reaction from the authorities of the unrecognized 
Dniester Moldovan Republic to the attack by Mr. Bergman, who is 
engaged in a protracted propaganda war with the "corrupt top" in 
Tiraspol, was like lightning. The local press published letters 
by Antyufeyev-Shevtsov's co-officers, including the above 
mentioned Gen. Shteynbrik and former Riga OMON commander Sergey 
Parfenov. Addressing Dniester Moldovan Republic President Igor 
Smirnov, they unanimously defended the honor and dignity of 
their colleague, who was awarded an order in 1990. 
  Observers believe that a new peak of confrontation between 
the Dniester Moldovan Republic leadership and Mr. Bergman, who 
is seen to be a front man for 14th Army Commander Lieutenant 
General Lebed, is the result of a recent reorganization in the 
Dniester Moldovan Republic's power structures. The State 
Security Ministry and the Internal Affairs Ministry were merged 
into a single superstructure -- the Committee for Republican 
Security headed by Vadim Shevtsov (Antyufeyev), former Riga OMON 
officer and chief of the Dniester state security service. Such 
an obvious consolidation in the positions of a person who is 
considered to be a personal enemy of Army commander Lebed and 
Col. Bergman (the latter have been working for the last year and 
a half to get Shevtsov removed from his post and put on trial -- 
SEGODNYA), could not but evoke corresponding reaction from the 
14th Army. 
  Mr. Shevtsov and his structure are the most solid base for 
the current Dniester Moldovan Republic leadership. Shevtsov's 
removal will create favorable conditions for a reshuffle in the 
Tiraspol top echelon and for its penetration by people amenable 
to General Lebed and those standing behind him.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Demidetskiy] </F>
  [Text] Chisinau April 1 TASS -- The Moldovan Parliament 
suspended today a government resolution on certification of 
knowledge of the state language due to begin on April 2. 
  This was done in response to numerous appeals of labor 
collectives, who believe that conditions for language studies 
were not created in some places, Parliament Vice-Speaker Nikolay 
Andronik told ITAR-TASS here today. A parliamentary commission 
has been set up to analyze the situation. Collectives who feel 
themselves ready for certification can start it tomorrow. 
  The certification postponement was initiated by the Moldovan 
Parliament faction of the Socialist Party and the Unity 
International Movement, who think that "the lack of language 
knowledge on the part of the Russian-speaking population is 
often used to remove people from their posts, especially the 
high ones". In the opinion of specialists, one cannot be forced 
to study a language. 
  The Christian-Democratic Popular Front, which stands for 
unification with Romania, and the Bloc of Intellectuals and 
Farmers did not support the postponement and refused to send 
their delegates to the parliamentary commission.

  [Text] Today, a Russian military attache was accredited at 
the Ministry of Defense. His name is Vladimir Konayev, and he 
is a Russian army captain. 
  Latvian Defense Minister Valdis Pavlovskis described the 
occasion as a significant step towards the normalizing of 
relations between Latvia and Russia. Russian Ambassador to 
Latvia Aleksandr Rannikh agreed with the Latvian defense 
minister and said that the new attache would help the Russian 
Embassy in handling different questions related to cooperation 
between Latvian and Russian Defense Ministries. 
  The attache's activities will not be directly connected with 
the withdrawal of Russian troops from Latvia, but he is going to 
involve the embassy in solving of the problem connected with the 
pullout. 
  Konayev, born in 1931, has been on service since 1958. Since 
May 1993 he was performing the duties of military and political 
counsellor at the Russian Embassy to Latvia.

<F P=106> [Article by Janis Kulmanis: "Approximately 7,000 Russian </F>
Soldiers Remain in Latvia"] 
  [Text] Riga, 24 Mar -- According to the Bureau for Russian 
Army Withdrawal Control, there are currently some 7,000 military 
personnel, grouped into 190 military units, still stationed in 
Latvia. The units are located at 242 sites and facilities. 
There are 827 trucks belonging to the Northwestern Army Group, 
which are currently assigned to economic enterprises. At the 
ammunition depots in Cekule, there are 60 freight cars filled 
with explosives, in Garkalne -- 300. 
  In reply to a question from DIENA at a press conference held 
by the Democratic Party on Wednesday [23 March], Ilgonis 
Upmalis, chief of the Bureau for Army Withdrawal Control, 
expressed his anxiety over Russia having not yet submitted a 
timetable for full withdrawal of its troops, which makes it 
impossible to establish commissions to assume control over 
military facilities. Moreover, the agreement, which was 
initialed last week, foresees that the timetable should be 
confirmed by both sides. I. Upmalis stated that the commander 
of the Northwestern Army Group has been asked many times to at 
least show the Latvians the mentioned timetable, but each time 
the answer is negative. As DIENA has already reported, Russian 
Ambassador to Latvia Aleksandr Rannih had affirmed to Latvian 
Foreign Affairs Minister Georgs Andrejevs that the timetable is 
ready, but cannot be supplied before the agreement is signed. 
  I. Upmalis reported that approximately 60 freight cars are 
being withdrawn each month from the ammunition depot at 
Garkalne, so now is the latest time possible for the agreement 
to be implemented, for otherwise it will be impossible to remove 
300 freight cars full of ammunition by 31 August 1994. 
  The Bureau for Army Withdrawal Control has calculated that 
Russian Army units still stationed in Latvia owe a combined debt 
of 9,865,031 lats for unpaid taxes and services already rendered.

<F P=106> [Article by Anita Smolenska: "Cabinet of Ministers Proposes </F>
Changes in the Police Law"] 
  [Text] Riga, 22 Mar -- During its session today, the 
Cabinet of Ministers has accepted changes in the law "On 
Police," granting police the right "to search, under special 
circumstances and with well-founded suspicions, means of 
transportation, their drivers and passengers, with the aim of 
finding and confiscating guns and explosive materials." 
  As is known, the Cabinet of Ministers already once granted 
such powers to the police. It was done during the Saeima's 
[parliament] Christmas break, when the Cabinet of Ministers took 
advantage of Article 81 of the Satversme [Constitution] 
permitting the government to make decisions under the rule of 
law. The Saeima annulled this law when it returned, on the 
basis of a special decision, according to recommendations from 
both the Juridical and the Defense and Internal Affairs 
Commissions. At present, the Cabinet of Ministers has decided 
to conduct the changes in ordinary legislative fashion. "During 
discussions in the Saeima, the government was told that the 
rejection was of a formal nature rather than an essential 
character," Minister of Special Tasks Edvins Inkens stated at a 
press briefing today. "Information from the Ministry of 
Internal Affairs proves that from the moment the police lost 
these rights, criminals have become more impudent." 
  The changes in the law, which were adopted today, also 
foresee that the police will be obliged to take care of people 
who have found themselves in a state of helplessness due to lack 
of means and housing, by bringing them to the institutions of 
the Ministry of Internal Affairs. The police will be 
responsible for them. As E. Inkens explained, this provision 
refers to beggars and homeless people.

<F P=106> [Article by Sanita Upleja: "'Fatherland and Freedom' Submits </F>
Draft Law for a Popular Referendum on Skrunda"] 
  [Text] Riga, 21 March -- The Saeima [parliament] faction 
"Fatherland and Freedom" has submitted a draft law on organizing 
a popular referendum on the issue of the continued operation of 
the Russian military facility -- Skrunda radar station -- on 
Latvian territory. 
  "Fatherland and Freedom" has drafted this law in light of 
its 
belief that the final decision on the continued operation of the 
Skrunda radar station after 31 August 1994 should be made by the 
people of Latvia, and that the signing of the agreement with 
Russia should be delayed until the results of the referendum are 
calculated. 
  The draft law presented by "Fatherland and Freedom" says 
that 
the referendum should be held on 29 May, at the same time as 
local government elections, and that all eligible Latvian 
citizens should participate. During the referendum, voters 
would answer the question: Do you agree or disagree with the 
continued operation of the Skrunda radar station after 31 August 
1994? 
  After the referendum, depending on the results, the Saeima 
will decide whether or not to conclude the agreement with Russia 
on the functioning of the Skrunda radar station, the draft law 
envisions. It also says that the decisions of the Cabinet of 
Ministers on concluding the agreement with Russia, which provide 
for the Skrunda station to continue operations past 31 August 
1994, are not valid. 
  The faction asked to include this issue on the agenda of the 
next plenary session, but the Presidium of the Saeima decided to 
pass it in the usual procedure to the Juridical Commission, 
which will prepare the draft law for examination at the plenary 
session. On Thursday [24 March], the deputies will have to make 
a decision as to whether the draft law will be rejected or 
passed to the Juridical Commission. A special law is necessary 
because the Constitution does not provide for the holding of 
popular referendums on issues related to international 
agreements.

  [Text] Moscow April 2 TASS -- Following President Nursultan 
Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan, who last week suggested creating a 
Euro-Asian Union which would include CIS countries which would 
opt to join it, the Party of Russian Unity and Accord, known 
under the Russian acronym PRES, on Saturday issued a statement 
suggesting that a confederative union of Euro-Asian states be 
established. 
  "Not only the peoples but also many political forces in CIS 
countries are prepared not just to discuss the idea of creating 
such a union but also to tackle specific matters concerning its 
functioning," said the statement signed by PRES leader Sergey 
Shakhray. 
  The PRES suggests setting up an international working group 
to elaborate the text of a confederative agreement. The party 
has stated that it "takes upon itself to provide organisational 
and financial support for such a group's activities".

<F P=106> [Yelena Kolokoltseva report in the "Parliament" column: </F>
"The State Duma Will Hold Budget Hearings on Tuesday. The 
Majority of Factions Have Determined Their Positions"] 
  [Text] On Tuesday, 5 April, the State Duma is planning to 
hold parliamentary hearings on the draft budget, to be attended 
by Aleksandr Shokhin and Sergey Dubinin. In line with the Law 
"On Procedures for Considering and Approving the Budget," 
parliament hearings are not the final stage of parliamentary 
work on the budget. Nonetheless, most of the factions have 
already defined their positions. SEGODNYA reported earlier, in 
issue No. 60, that the 12 December group intends to support the 
budget. 
  The Russia's Choice faction is also ready to accept the 
budget in principle. Its leader Yegor Gaydar said in the Duma 
yesterday that "although it has some comments to make," his 
faction will support the draft. The remarks by Russia's Choice 
mostly relate to the estimated revenue volumes, on which point 
they are at one with Yabloko. Yegor Gaydar also thinks it 
necessary to redistribute appropriations on certain items. "We 
are for increasing allocations for culture, science and 
education, and limiting state expenditures and subventions to 
the territories," the former premier said. 
  Consensus on the revenue part of the budget is the sole 
instance where the positions of Russia's Choice and Yabloko 
coincide. As Aleksey Mikhaylov told SEGODNYA's correspondent, 
Yabloko intends to reject the draft budget. In Duma 
officialese, this means that the draft will be sent back "to be 
clarified by the government" and then a conciliation commission 
will return to its consideration, but not until new amendments 
have been introduced, in its second reading. Mr. Mikhaylov also 
believes that the "three-volume set" presented by the Finance 
Ministry does not correspond to the actual economic situation 
because it is "based on an outdated forecast of socioeconomic 
development." Furthermore, in his opinion, the budget does not 
spell out the revenue and expenditure items; it also lacks the 
requisite appendices. 
  Mikhail Zadornov confirmed his colleague's position in the 
State Duma yesterday. Unlike Mr. Mikhaylov, however, Mr. 
Zadornov, as chairman of the Budget, Taxes, Banks and Finances 
Committee, is in a fairly difficult situation because he is 
forced to confront the need to make a choice. On the one hand, 
he should obey the decision of his faction; on the other, he 
should expedite the passage of the budget through the State 
Duma. The role of an active budget proponent in the lower 
chamber, however, is being played by his deputy, Aleksandr 
Pochinok. Two days ago he held a prolonged discussion on this 
issue with Aleksandr Shokhin. It is not quite clear, though, in 
what capacity the latter acted -- either as a member of the PRES 
faction or as economy minister and vice premier. So far PRES has 
made no final decision but, it appears, in spite of a certain 
unpredictability in Mr. Shakhray's behavior, it is likely to 
make its additions to the budget and not go as far as turn down 
the draft as whole. 
  As for the agrarians, their positions is unequivocal: "No, 
no and never." Mikhail Lapshin, an agrarian faction leader, 
said this in conversation with SEGODNYA's correspondent in so 
many words. The Russian Federation Communist Party and the 
Liberal Democratic Party factions are expected to make a 
decision on this question in the next few days.

  [Text] The meeting of a group of experts from North Ossetia 
and Ingushetia held under the mediation of the head of the 
interim administration in the zone of the state of emergency 
Vladimir Lozovoy was concluded with the signing of a working 
protocol on Friday. 
  The parties agreed to hold a meeting between North Ossetian 
and Ingush presidents Akhsarbek Galazov and Ruslan Aushev on 
April 2 in Nalchik, the capital of Kabardino Balkaria. 
  The issue relating to the implementation of the Russian 
president's decree on the return of Ingush refugees to North 
Ossetia's Prigorodny region is to become the central one at 
forthcoming negotiations between the leaders of two neighboring 
republics. 
  Meanwhile, during the meeting the experts demonstrated 
different approaches of the Ossetian and Ingush parties towards 
this problem. As a result, two drafts of the agenda of Galazov's 
and Aushev's meeting were fixed in the final document. 
  The first draft presented by North Ossetia says that the 
meeting in Nalchik should consider the issues on principles and 
measures to implement Boris Yeltsin's decree stipulating the 
order of refugees and forced settlers return from North Ossetia 
and Ingushetia to the places of their permanent residence. 
  The second draft which was presented by the Ingush party 
stipulates that the meeting should consider the issue related to 
the fulfillment of the Russian president's decree and the 
complete return of refugees and all settlers from North Ossetia 
to the places of their permanent residence. 
  On April 2 Galazov and Aushev are to choose what draft will 
become the subject of their discussion. 
  In his interview with Interfax Lozovoy expressed hopes that 
the negotiations of the working groups held April 1 have given 
an impulse to the implementation of Russian president's decree 
on the return of refugees and forced settlers. 
  Leader of the Russian president's administration Sergey 
Filatov and Kabardino Balkarian President Valeriy Kokov are 
expected to attend the meeting in Nalchik.

  [Text] Vladikavkaz April 2 TASS -- An official meeting 
between the presidents of North Ossetia and Ingushetia, 
Akhsarbek Galazov and Ruslan Aushev, began in Nalchik at 11.00 
on Saturday. 
  It has become known from sources close to the North Ossetian 
president that the situation in the state-of-emergency area is 
under discussion. Special attention will be devoted to the 
enactment of the Russian president's decree on "a procedure for 
the return of refugees and forced migrants to the places of 
their permanent residence on the territories of North Ossetian 
and Ingush Republics." 
  The Ossetian side has prepared a package of important 
documents connected with the implementation of the Russian 
president's decree for the dialogue in Nalchik. The basic 
principle inherent in the document is striving to maintain peace 
and inter-ethnic accord in the North Caucasus.

  [Text] Cheboksary, 1 Apr -- A communique was signed today 
in Cheboksary on the intention to strengthen and develop 
economic and cultural links between Chuvashia and Tatarstan. In 
the opinion of Nikolay Fedorov, the president of Chuvashia, and 
Vasiliy Likhachev, the vice president of Tatarstan, the document 
paves the way for the conclusion of a bilateral treaty of 
friendship and cooperation, which it is proposed to sign in the 
near future. 
  In their discussion of the socio-political and economic 
situation in Russia the sides expressed support for the reforms 
based on the principles of democracy, justice, and law that are 
being implemented. The leaders of the two republics, which are 
parts of the Russian Federation, consider that all contentious 
issues within the territory of the Russian Federation should be 
tackled only on the basis of negotiations. 
  The president of Chuvashia supported a proposal by the vice 
president of Tatarstan that a Euro-Asian international 
cooperation center be set up in Kazan. Both sides also put 
forward an initiative that an international project be developed 
in Cheboksary under the auspices of UNESCO for the purpose of 
preserving and developing the cultures and languages of the 
peoples of the Volga-Urals region.

<F P=106> [Dmitriy Alekhin report in the "Waste" column: "Will the </F>
TNT- 5's Radioactive Cargo Get Into the Sea of Japan?"] 
  [Text] The sensitive issues of radiation security are 
fairly effective in helping politicians build their image. 
Naturally, when local authorities decide to rid their residents 
of an enhanced radiation danger source, the latter react to this 
as manifestation of special care being shown to them. There is 
nothing bad about this, yet it is not always that the best 
possible methods are found to resolve such problems. 
  As RIA Novosti reported, the radiation aboard the TNT-5 
tanker, filled with radioactive waste from Pacific Fleet nuclear 
submarines, has deteriorated. The vessel, moored at the Zvezda 
plant in Bolshoy Kamen Bay, has developed a leak in its 
drainage, pipe, and valve system, as a result of which the 
radiation level in the aft engine room since the previous check 
(on 28 December 1993) has doubled, reaching 1,400 
microroentgen/hr. 
  This conclusion, according to the news agency, was made 
yesterday by a team of specialists created on orders of the 
Maritime Kray administration. Experts believe that in April-May 
the situation could aggravate rapidly; in the end this could 
lead in particular to the shutdown of the Zvezda plant, which is 
engaged in dismantling nuclear submarines under the START II 
Treaty. RIA Novosti also reported, citing Yevgeniy Stomastyuk, 
chairman of the Maritime Kray Environmental Protection 
Committee, that in order to avoid a major ecological catastrophe 
the commission deems it expedient to dump the liquid nuclear 
waste aboard the TNT-5 tanker into the Sea of Japan this May. 
  SEGODNYA's correspondent managed to obtain a comment from 
employees at the State Committee for the Supervision of Nuclear 
and Radiation Safety [Gosatomnadzor], an organization in charge 
of radiation safety on a Russia-wide scale. Gosatomnadzor 
representatives believe that because matters of ecological and 
radiation security come under the jurisdiction of federal 
authorities, such a decision by a local commission can be only 
of a recommendatory character. SEGODNYA's correspondent also 
learned that Gosatomnadzor has decided not to allow the dumping 
of radiative substances into the sea but to pump the liquid 
waste from the tanker to other vessels which are in good 
condition; the TNT-5 itself, after corresponding treatment, will 
be towed to a safe place.

<F P=106> [Yelena Kudrina video report; from the "Dalniy Vostok" </F>
program] 
  [Text] There is and undoubtedly will always be a demand for 
electricity. Here we have a different type of problem: How to 
overcome the region's energy crisis. This was the purpose of 
the recent conference in Khabarovsk which discussed the problems 
of using small-capacity nuclear power plants in the Far East, 
the Far North, and the Baykal regions. 
  We have been discussing the development of nuclear energy in 
the Far East region for a long time. The energy crisis in the 
territory forces us to return to this subject. It has been a 
pressing problem for a quite some time, but because of financial 
difficulties today, it has become even more complicated. If we 
assess the situation using Khabarovsk Kray as an example, it is 
enough to cite two factors to be convinced of the extreme 
complexity that exists in the energy situation. The supply of 
gas from Sakhalin has been reduced twofold. Our own local coal 
supply provides less than 4 percent of the requirement, and the 
rest of the coal is brought in. We are critically short of the 
money needed to buy the coal. [video shows meeting in session, 
then cuts to show V.M. Malich, chief of a department of the 
Vostok-Energo organization, addressing the meeting] 
  [Begin Malich recording] It is necessary to point out that 
there have been no new power-generating capabilities introduced 
in the Far East since 1990. Many of you in the hall here know 
that from 1980 to 1985, we commissioned a little less than 1,800 
megawatts of power. Between 1985 and 1990 it was even less, 800 
megawatts, and since 1990, nothing. That is, currently we are 
not commissioning anything, not even power-generating 
capabilities which could and should cover the capacities that 
are being lost. [end recording; video shows participants in the 
meeting] 
  The power engineers see the solution in the completion of 
the 
TET [heat and electric power plant], the GES [state electric 
power plant], and the GRES [state regional electric power plant] 
projects already begun -- of which there are quite a few in the 
region -- and in the building of small-capacity nuclear power 
plants. [video cuts to show V.T. Lebedenko, general director of 
the combined board of Far East nuclear power plants] 
  [Begin Lebedenko recording] Nuclear power generation began 
to 
develop in the form of draft projects after the government 
adopted decrees on measures to provide the regions with fuel and 
energy resources. As you might recall, the first project was 
for a Far East nuclear power plant, the technical and economic 
substantiation plant, for which was completed and handed over 
for checking by the experts. This year we are faced with 
deciding whether or not this plant is to go into operation. 
This is precisely where Vyacheslav Mikhaylovich [not further 
identified; possibly V.M. Malich] and I have a divergence of 
views, although I will not be adamant. [end recording; video 
shows meeting, a wall map entitled "Electric Power -- Far East 
Economic Region and the Baykal Region"] 
  Power engineers favoring traditional fuels and those 
favoring 
nuclear power have agreed on one thing: Both were satisfied 
with the alternative of building small-capacity nuclear power 
plants in the Far East, the Far North, and the Baykal regions.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Andrey Fomin] </F>
  [Text] Chita April 4 TASS -- A special regime of 
electricity supply was introduced in the Chita region this week. 
Several days ago the management of the territorial branch of 
the Sibenergo energy generating amalgamation threatened to 
disconnect the eastern part of the Baykal region from the single 
power grid of Russia for delays in the payment of debts. 
Partially the threat was put into effect: Electricity supply to 
the Chita region from neighbouring regions was reduced almost by 
three times. As a result of it, a schedule of switching off 
cities and districts one after another began to be implemented 
today. Industrial enterprises are being supplied with 
electricity under an emergency regime. Freight and passenger 
traffic at the trans-Siberian railway line may come to a 
standstill. 
  Commenting on the situation, Valeriy Lomako, first deputy 
head of the regional administration, told ITAR-TASS that the 
local government authorities are trying to prevent a complete 
energy blockade of the area by holding talks with Sibenergo. A 
compromise has not yet been reached, because the region has no 
money to pay the debt, and there are no other sources of 
financing in sight. In the opinion of Lomako, the conflict 
between the region and Sibenergo can hardly be settled without 
the interference of the Russian Government.

  [Text] One of the last remnants of the Iron Curtain which 
Russia inherited from the Soviet Union has fallen. Strict 
control of foreign vessels is no longer being implemented by 
border guards of the Nakhodka independent control and entry 
point. Their squads are no longer being posted on the decks of 
foreign freighters tying up at moorings in Nakhodka and 
Vostochnyy ports. 
  Lengthy round-the-clock watches in any weather monitoring 
foreigners in all Russian ports hardly corresponds with the 
democratic principles of the country's development. Besides it 
was quite costly, so the command of border guards in Maritime 
Kray decided to relinquish the old methods of monitoring 
arriving vessels. Their crews will now carry out their own 
watch on the gangway in accordance with the rules of maritime 
service. They will also decide for themselves who to permit or 
not permit on board. The border guards detachments that carried 
out this work will now be used to guard the state border -- 
their primary task.

  [Text] A B-29 bomber, the famous American World War II 
aircraft better known as the Flying Fortress, has been found in 
the Ussuri tayga. It was found in dense forest by pilots of the 
Russian Dalaero company. How it got there remains a mystery, 
although long-time local residents recall that during the 
forties there were rumors going around the Far East that an 
American aircraft, crippled by Samurai [Japanese] fighters over 
the Sea of Japan, had made an attempt to reach an airfield in 
Maritime Kray but crashed in the tayga. 
  According to Vladimir Safronov, Dalaero director, the 
sensational find was no coincidence. One of the spheres of 
activity of the multifaceted Dalaero Scientific Production 
Association [SPA] is the search for various objects abandoned or 
lost in the vast tayga. During several expeditions the aviators 
have found a Soviet DB-3 long-range bomber; several An-2, a 
Yak-13, and a Yak-18E aircraft; a Mi-1, a Mi-2, and a Mi-8T 
helicopter, and two tractors dating to the beginning of the 
century. One of the tractors was built in 1903. 
  All of this equipment will be restored and displayed in a 
museum which the Dalaero SPA enthusiasts plan to open.

  [Text] On Thursday an anti-submarine patrolling ship was 
launched into waters from a ship-building plant in Chechnya 
located down the River of Terek. Interfax's correspondents 
report that after the opening ceremony with traditional wishes 
for seaworthiness the ship's name was announced: "Ruslan 
Khasbulatov." 
  A personal envoy of the Chechen President Shamsuddi Chimayev 
said at a spontaneous meeting that the decision was taken by the 
republic's government to pay homage to the former speaker of the 
Russian parliament. According to Chimayev, the ship will be 
"the first combat vessel in the newly created naval forces of 
the republic." Interfax's correspondent reports that from now 
on March 31 will be celebrated in Chechnya as the Day of the 
Republic's Naval Force. 
  Khasbulatov, who attended the opening ceremony, thanked 
compatriots for their respect and invited all those present to a 
solemn dinner on the occasion, which will be held in his native 
village of Tolstoy-Yurt on Friday evening. 
  In the meantime, Interfax learned from confidential sources 
that first naval exercises are scheduled for June in the basin 
of Terek. In the course of the exercises, the aviation forces 
together with the combat vessel will be working on their 
interaction in the event of aggression from abroad. The 
exercises will also involve units of the coast guard "Abrek" and 
combat swimmers who will show off the art of building 
anti-infantry positions in the water out of available materials.

  [Text] In Russia, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy has warned Finland 
against joining NATO. According to Zhirinovskiy, membership of 
NATO would turn Finland into an enemy of Russia. Zhirinovskiy 
will arrive in Finland tomorrow together with a delegation from 
the Russian parliament. Correspondent Martti Hosia met him in 
Moscow. 
  [Hosia] Absolutely not -- This was Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's 
reply when asked to give his view of Finland joining the 
European Union [EU] and in time, possibly NATO. He completely 
left aside EU membership, but was more than eager to seize on 
NATO. Keep away from NATO and all military alliances which are 
directed against Russia, otherwise you will turn into enemies of 
Russia and cannon fodder. German and Russian tank divisions 
will be fighting on your territory, Zhirinovskiy depicted the 
scene in his customary style. 
  His party's deputy chairman, Ahmed Khalitov, for his part, 
complained that there is a lot of anti-Russian feeling in 
Finland at present. Weapons are being acquired and hostile 
propaganda is on the rise. The stick has two ends, Khalitov 
warned. 
  Zhirinovskiy and his Liberal Democrat party comrades are 
known for their tough talking. Zhirinovskiy is an opposition 
leader and he does not need to be diplomatic in his choice of 
words. However, Zhirinovskiy does have close links with 
conservative officers in the army; the words have the same tone. 
NATO is still a red rag to the conservative officers here. For 
instance, a retired general who addressed a meeting of Slav 
nations in Moscow today, organized by Zhirinovskiy, was 
seriously of the view that the West's and NATO's peacekeeping 
activities in former Yugoslavia are only a dress rehearsal for 
an occupation of Russia. 
  Against this background, it is understandable that NATO's 
Partnership for Peace project has also aroused severe 
condemnation here. Moscow does not like the fact that NATO 
first approached the East European and Baltic countries as well 
as Sweden and Finland. Russia was left last. In Moscow's view, 
the marching order should have been precisely the opposite. 
  In Russia's official foreign political leadership, NATO's 
Partnership for Peace has caused chaos. In the opinion of 
President Yeltsin's spokesman Vyacheslav Kostikov, it may take 
more than six months to reach agreement on Partnership for 
Peace, while Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev is talking about 
one month. As leader of the opposition, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy 
is happy to spit into this NATO soup boiling in Moscow by 
warning Finland of the dangers of NATO and western leanings in 
general.

<F P=106> [Studio interview with Russian Foreign Minister Andrey </F>
Kozyrev by program announcer Yevgeniy Kiselev; date not given; 
from the "Itogi" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Kiselev] It goes without saying that the changes 
which have taken place over the past six months in the 
disposition of forces on the Russian political stage could not 
have failed to place new emphases in Russian foreign policy, 
too. In this connection, many people draw attention to the fact 
that Russian Foreign Affairs Minister Andrey Kozyrev is no 
longer the person we knew before. 
  In recent years, your position has evolved significantly. 
For example, in 1991, you said that everything concerning human 
rights in Estonia was alright, and you have since changed your 
view quite sharply. At the beginning of 1992 you were in favor 
of civilized relations with post-Soviet states, rejecting the 
need for military pressure, even, one recalls, in the middle of 
1992 you spoke very sharply against the War Party. 
  But once again there are new nuances, such as -- if one 
believes press reports of course -- you once stated that it was 
possible to hold talks with the Tajik opposition only with the 
help of missile salvo's. 
  One way or another, an element of toughness has become quite 
noticeable in your actions. Tell, me, am I right or wrong to 
state that the position of the foreign affairs minister is 
evolving? Or is it not evolving at all? 
  [Kozyrev] Well, I would put it like this -- yes and no. But, 
firstly, some of those quotes you cited are not exactly 
accurate, or have been cited not quite accurately in those media 
outlets, or you, now, for the purpose of abbreviation...[pauses] 
For example, that I had allegedly said in 1991 that, say, human 
rights were not being violated in Estonia, Latvia, and 
Lithuania. I do not recall that, and it cannot be, because if 
you take my speech at the Supreme Soviet as it was, where I 
asserted in Autumn 1990, and not 1991, my first speech, then 
mention is already made there of the need to protect the rights 
of the Russian-speaking population, first and foremost in the 
Baltic states. 
  In other words, we have always said that. It is a mistaken 
notion that the patriotic and nationalist opposition has foisted 
this issue on us. But once again, I do not agree. Today, I am 
most resolutely opposed to the War Party which speaks of 
dispatching troops for the purposes of suppression and that 
thinks that these problems, such as the violation of human 
rights, can be solved by inflicting bomb strikes as Rutskoy 
said, or as Zhirinovskiy says by the Russian soldier's boot or 
something in that vein. This is irresponsibility, and I am 
categorically against the War Party today, too. 
  It is a different matter that all these issues demand 
resolution. Why now? Yes, because of course we would have been 
bad democrats, and I would show disrespect to myself if I never 
heeded the voice of the voters, the voice of the people that was 
heard at the last elections, for example. 
  [Kiselev] You once stated, this was at the very start of the 
reforms, of the Gaydar reforms, that you were a member of the 
team of the reformers and that you would leave it only when they 
left. Now, at the start of 1994, we see that those people who 
have traditionally been associated with the concept of reformers 
in our country have left the government. But you have remained. 
With what is this decision linked? 
  [Kozyrev] Well to put it quite briefly and clearly, since 
you 
use the term team, then, the trainer and the captain of the team 
is the same. Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin. 
  [Kiselev] In Russia, a strong foreign affairs minister is a 
person who defends, who strictly defends the interests of his 
department in its relationship with other departments. In this 
regard, I have this question: To what extent does your 
department, the Russian Foreign Affairs Ministry, control the 
process of elaborating the Russian position concerning such a 
topical matter as the matter of unifying the monetary systems of 
Russia and Belarus, and does the Foreign Affairs Ministry have 
an official position on this problem? 
  [Kozyrev] Without a doubt, we take part in discussing these 
matters, although it is true, of course, that our sphere is such 
a priority as it were -- these are political decisions. In 
political terms there are no doubts that, in this case, it is in 
the interests of Russia and Russia's course, to get as close as 
possible to Belarus. That is a political strategy. 
  But I have to tell you that the question here is of course 
very concrete, it consists in the unification of monetary 
systems, the unification. If it is not a payments union of some 
kind, and so on, or a payments agreement, but unification, then 
this demands the combination, the compatibility of both the 
legislative process and so on, and of all economic activity, 
which is a pretty complex problem of course. 
  I have to say that in the notorious agreement signed by 
Chernomyrdin and his Belarus colleague this is actually stated. 
  [Kiselev] At one time, through the forces of the opposition 
press, of course, the image of the pro-American politician, the 
Russian diplomat of a pro-American bent was established. Do you 
feel that this image has stuck with you and hindered you in your 
work? 
  [Kozyrev] Well, I will tell you that if the opposition, the 
extreme nationalist opposition -- what I call the anti-patriotic 
opposition -- accuses me of being pro-American, then that means 
that we are conducting the correct policy with regard to the 
United States. 
  The opposition wants a relationship with the United States 
and with NATO based on the foe principle. They need the foe 
image, otherwise their whole impracticable and anti-national 
design falls apart, you see. 
  It is a different matter that we have a pretty 
complex...[pauses] New rules, principles, and mechanisms of 
partnership are being worked out now with the United States. We 
are quite open and sometimes even public about this. But for 
the greater part, by means of our specific diplomatic methods, 
we are of course holding discussions with them. 
  [Kiselev] And when they rebuke you for neo-imperialism, what 
conclusion do you draw for yourself? 
  [Kozyrev] Roughly this, irrespective who issues the rebuke, 
if I am rebuked by those whom the independent role of Russia as 
a global power clearly does not suit -- and there are such in 
the West -- then let us not close our eyes, because there are 
forces who really do not want Russia to be a global power. I 
think that this is a good indicator and it means that once again 
we are doing everything right. 
  [Kiselev] And when you are rebuked by our -- shall we say 
radical liberals? 
  [Kozyrev] Well, our radical liberals are at times also 
inclined to such excessive radicalism. But what is there to 
worry about? These are all internal arguments you see, we have 
arguments, there is nothing to worry about. 
  If our extreme nationalists accuse us of listing toward the 
Americans, then once again it means we are doing the right thing 
because if they liked our American policy, then today we would 
not be discussing the problems we are talking about now, but 
would be saying: Okay, there is nothing to eat in the country, 
but the main thing is that there is no nuclear war.

  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [Announcer Sergey Medvedev] Who 
would have thought that after the fighting at the beginning of 
the week, the Georgians and Abkhazians would agree on peace at 
the end of it. But that is what seems to have taken place. 
  Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Boris Pastukhov was able to 
bring representatives of the warring sides to the negotiating 
table in Moscow, and they found a common language. Now, the 
appropriate agreement is expected to be signed on Monday [4 
April], in the presence of Russian and UN officials. Andrey 
Kozyrev, the head of the Russian Foreign Ministry, in a special 
interview for our program, explains what exactly has been 
achieved over the past few days. [video shows Andrey Kozyrev 
speaking to unseen interviewer] 
  [Begin Kozyrev recording] Agreement has been reached on, 
firstly, a cease-fire and no resumption of shooting, which is 
extraordinarily important and of course a condition for talks to 
switch from the language of the gun to that of political 
settlement. 
  Secondly, there is agreement on a complete return by 
refugees. Thank God, a formula has been found that conforms to 
international standards. I do not want this to be famous last 
words, but the formula corresponds to the UN's approach. The 
essence of this approach is that everyone can return, with the 
exception of a very small group of people who could possibly be 
accused of direct participation in and guilt for military 
crimes, and so forth. I think that this will be the first step 
in further progress toward an Abkhazia settlement. 
  The second step could be establishment of economic links and 
solutions to a whole range of other issues, such as confidence- 
building, and so forth. 
  And of course, of course, at some stage the question of 
status and all these legal issues is bound to arise. If you 
look at the agreement you will see that Russia is involved not 
only diplomatically. We will retain our presence and 
participation. A whole range of UN organizations will be 
actively involved in resolving these issues, but I want to 
stress once again that, of course, people can only be convinced 
by their own consciences and their responsibility before their 
nations. [end recording]

<F P=106> [ITAR-TASS report: "Still A Paltry Sum"] </F>
  [Text] "We want cooperation that is real and not just 
symbolic," Russian President Boris Yeltsin stated Wednesday [30 
March] during a Kremlin reception for U.S. Secretary of Commerce 
Ronald Brown who is visiting Moscow. The day before, Prime 
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin urged his U.S. partners "not to be 
afraid but to approach the Russian market more boldly." Has 
there been a real response to these appeals or has nothing been 
done about them? The three days that the U.S. business 
delegation headed by Brown spent in Moscow do not seem to have 
completely clarified this question. 
  On the one hand, four intergovernmental agreements were 
signed between the two countries Wednesday, including statutes 
on the Committee for the Development of Business Cooperation 
between Russia and America and on the creation of U.S. business 
centers in Russia. The joint statement adopted by Russia and 
the United States made special mention of the question of access 
to the U.S. market for Russian goods and to the Russian market 
for U.S. goods. Summing up the results of the U.S. delegation's 
three-day visit to Moscow at the end of the day on Wednesday, 
Brown made a special note of the successes of the delegation's 
representatives from the U.S. private sector and in particular 
the agreements signed with Russian partners by such U.S. 
corporations as McDermott International Inc., (shipbuilding), 
the Halliburton Company of Texas (gas and oil industry), Allen 
and Associates (the pharmaceutical industry), the Westinghouse 
Electric Corporation (modernization and construction of nuclear 
power power stations), and others. 
  At the same time, as the secretary himself acknowledged, 
U.S. 
private capital investments in Russia, which have almost doubled 
in the past year, are still only $1 billion, which is a paltry 
sum by U.S. standards (by comparison, U.S. companies have 
invested $239 billion in West Europe). During the visit Brown 
predicted that U.S. investments in Russia could easily rise to 
$45-$50 billion if the right conditions are created. He cited 
the lowering of Russia's customs tariffs and the easing of tax 
legislation among those conditions.

<F P=106> [Marat Zubko report: "Former KGB Colonel Believes Ames </F>
Betrayed Him"] 
  [Text] Helsinki -- Oleg Gordiyevskiy, former KGB station 
chief in London, who spent many years working for British 
intelligence, stated on Finnish television that he was most 
likely betrayed by Ames, the high-ranking CIA officer. The same 
Ames whom FBI agents recently arrested for spying for Moscow. 
  "I myself was blown in 1985," Gordiyevskiy said in an 
hour-long Finnish television broadcast. "And all these years I 
have been trying to find out who exactly was to blame for this 
happening. When the scandal of Ames' arrest broke I realized 
that he was obviously the one...." 
  How exactly could Ames have known about the former KGB 
colonel's double game if, according to Gordiyevskiy, British 
intelligence did not give his name to the Americans? He said 
that the most important information he passed on to the British 
was sent from London to Washington, but in a "depersonalized 
form." Nevertheless, based on knowledge of these reports Ames 
evidently came to the conclusion that the information was coming 
from a person who at that time was working in London and who was 
previously in Scandinavia. Thus the KGB determined the source 
which was leaking important information. 
  This supposition, Gordiyevskiy believes, is confirmed by the 
following fact. It has now been learned that the Soviet side 
transferred the first major reward to Ames' bank account 18 May 
1985, while Gordiyevskiy, the KGB station chief in London, was 
recalled to Moscow 17 May. In the USSR it became clear to him 
that he had been exposed, but he managed to escape abroad. 
  The former KGB colonel recounted that, as it turns out, he 
was acquainted with Ames. After his flight from Moscow he 
traveled to the United States several times and met with leading 
CIA officers there. Gordiyevskiy now recalls that Ames was 
present at these conversations, during which Ames smiled at him. 
It is clear that the Soviet Union knew everything that was told 
to the Americans. 
  A large part of the interview was devoted to the Soviet 
special services' work against Finland. The KGB colonel 
reported that the main agent network was recruited immediately 
after the war. At that time the country "was on its knees," so 
it was not so very difficult to incline people toward 
cooperation. 
  Agents were recruited from various strata of society. Even 
from among church officials. Not to carry out intelligence work 
but to make, for example, a copy from the church register needed 
by a Soviet Karelian illegal agent concerning his "birth in 
Finland." 
  Gordiyevskiy disclosed that the KGB's strongest positions 
were in the Finnish Center Party, which formed the country's 
government many times. The station later penetrated the ranks 
of the Social Democrats and even of the Conservatives. 
  The KGB station chief in Finland, Gordiyevskiy stated, used 
to receive encrypted messages from Moscow containing the main 
points of comments which were to be put into the mouths of 
eminent Finnish politicians. For instance, he met with former 
Finnish President Urho Kekkonen and spoke to him in roughly the 
following terms: It is desired that during your visit to 
such-and-such a country you could say the following for the sake 
of world peace.... 
  "For your convenience we have even composed the text," the 
station chief would smile and take a sheet out of his pocket 
with the main points typed in Finnish. 
  The former colonel believes that Finland is now being used 
in 
work against the Baltic countries. Gordiyevskiy said that 
Moscow believes that Western intelligence services are actively 
using these states to spy on Russian territory. On the other 
hand, Russia wants to know everything about the intentions of 
the Estonian, Latvian, and Lithuanian Governments. 
  At the end of the broadcast the double agent was asked 
whether the death sentence pronounced on him back in the years 
when the USSR existed had been quashed, and whether he had 
received an amnesty from the State Duma, which released Rutskoy, 
Khasbulatov, Makashov, and others from custody. 
  "No, it has not been quashed," Gordiyevskiy said. "But I do 
not want any amnesty from this Red-and-Brown Duma. The death 
sentence is my reward and my banner...."

  [Text] Moscow April 2 TASS -- "The visit to Moscow by U.S. 
Secretary of Commerce Ronald Brown has shown that there is no 
chill in Russian-U.S. relations," Dmitriy Ryurikov, assistant to 
the Russian president, told ITAR-TASS in an exclusive interview. 
  "The two sides adhere to the policy of partnership, value 
their relations and think how to make them still more productive 
and versatile in the future," Ryurikov said. 
  The U.S. commerce secretary led a delegation of prominent 
representatives of the U.S. business community whose principal 
aim is to "stimulate American private business' interest in 
Russia". 
  "To all appearances, the delegation members saw for 
themselves Russia's interest in cooperation, and the Russian 
leadership's support for big projects and closer contacts", 
Ryurikov pointed out.

  [Text] Moscow April 3 TASS -- "The interests of Russia now 
are primarily economic, trade and humanitarian ones, that is 
absolutely legitimate, normal vital interests of a civilised 
democratic state", Dmitriy Ryurikov, assistant to the Russian 
president, told ITAR-TASS in an exclusive interview. 
  Ryurikov categorically denied assertions that Russia 
manifested imperial ambitions in its foreign policy. The 
presidential aide emphasised that he does not see "anything 
terrible in remarks by Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs 
Andrey Kozyrev who refers to CIS countries as the area of 
Russia's vital interests". 
  "This is really so. Russia has vital interests in CIS 
countries, just as those countries have very serious and vital 
interests in Russia", Ryurikov said. 
  He believes that the vital interests of Russia and CIS 
countries closely interweave. All depends on what is understood 
by the term "interests", the presidential aide pointed out. 
  "Russia has moved away from the former Soviet Union's 
understanding of `interests' as a desire to monitor and 
influence the internal life and foreign policies of other states 
and to declare them to be an area of the Soviet Union's special 
`interests'. If they disagreed, pressure tactics, the dispatch 
of troops, etc. Used to be resorted to," Ryurikov explained.

  [Text] Moscow, 2 Apr -- Three border detachments and the 
Pytalovo and Pechory border checkpoints have been reinforced in 
order to guard the Russian-Estonian border, an ITAR-TASS 
correspondent was informed at the press office of the Russian 
border troops. This is related to the incident that occurred 
there on Friday 1 April when two unidentified persons fired a 
pistol at a border detail. 
  The Russian border troops' press office reports that customs 
checks are being carried out according to special procedures. 
Together with Ministry of Internal Affairs bodies, reserve 
forces of the border troops are searching for the criminals. 
The search staff, which was set up immediately after the tragic 
events, is being led by Lieutenant General Vladimir Vyunov, 
commander of the North-West Border District. 
  An ITAR-TASS correspondent has learned from the headquarters 
of Russia's border troops that the Estonian side has expressed 
its readiness to assist in the search for the criminals, who 
went to ground on the territory of the republic after committing 
their crime.

  [Text] Budapest April 1 TASS -- Trade-economic cooperation 
is a special aspect of the Russian-Hungarian relations, Russian 
Prime minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, currently here on an 
official visit, told Hungarian businessmen today. 
  The importance of trade-economic relations has drastically 
increased now that Russia and Hungary have overcome the past and 
have no serious political problems, said. 
  Geographic closeness of Russia and Hungary and years-old 
traditional bilateral contacts are very important. The two 
countries know each other's conditions, customs and potential 
market abilities and have a developed communications network for 
economic relations. Cooperation reserves are huge, stressed the 
premier. 
  Viktor Chernomyrdin called for encouragement of new forms of 
business cooperation, creation of joint ventures and banks, 
mutual participation in investment processes and privatization 
programs in Hungary and Russia. He thinks that production 
cooperation and direct relations of Hungarian and Russian plans 
are a priority area. There are also reserves of regional 
cooperation. 
  "We value high Hungarian experience in this sphere. Hungary 
has been active in Tatarstan, Bashkortostan, the Komi Republic 
and the Stavropol territory," he said. 
  Speaking of the Russian economic situation, Chernomyrdin 
stressed that Russian market economy has been created and will 
be further developed. 
  "We are determined to follow this path no matter how hard it 
might be. Russian problems cannot be solved at once. Any haste 
can rather spoil the situation, provoke social tension and break 
the economic reforms," noted the Russian prime minister.

  [Excerpt] The Russian-Hungarian treaty on burying processed 
nuclear fuel on the territory of our country is quite 
advantageous for Russia, Viktor Mikhaylov, minister of nuclear 
power engineering, told INTERFAX. Let me remind you that during 
his visit to Hungary Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin signed 
an agreement under which processed nuclear fuel from Hungarian 
nuclear power stations is to be brought to Russia, for which our 
country is to be paid 40 million dollars. Here is a report from 
our correspondent. 
  [Correspondent Yevgeniya Novikova] Russia is still receiving 
radioactive waste from foreign nuclear power stations under 
international agreements once concluded by the Soviet Union. 
This concerns only those stations that were built by the Soviet 
Union on its neighbors' territory, and with which appropriate 
agreements were concluded. According to Greenpeace, processed 
nuclear fuel is currently stored on the territory of combines in 
Chelyabinsk and Krasnoyarsk, where the ecological situation has 
already caused a high incidence of radiation sickness and 
oncological diseases among the population. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Vitaliy Churkin, special representative of </F>
the president on the settlement in former Yugoslavia, by 
correspondent Mikhail Kozhukhov; in the "Panorama" program; 
place and date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Kozhukhov] Vitaliy Churkin, special representative 
of the president on the settlement in former Yugoslavia, has 
once again become a man of the week. With his participation in 
the Russian Embassy, representatives of Croatia and the 
self-declared Serb Krajina have agreed that as of 0900, 5 April 
they will stop killing each other. Vitaliy Ivanovich, the 
agreement between Serb Krajina and Croatia was signed when yiu 
were recently in Zagreb. We saw your happy face on our TV sets. 
But was this happiness not premature? The truce is not the 
peace as yet, you know. 
  [Churkin] Well, I really was very happy because two rounds, 
which lasted for 30 hours -- and the last round of negotiations 
lasted for 17 hours, ending at 0300 on 30 March -- led to the 
signing of one of the most important agreements, I believe. 
This is the agreement on a cease-fire between Serbs and Croats. 
It is very important that this is not only a declaration that 
they do not want to fight each other, but this is also a complex 
military and technical document which includes, for example, 35 
maps with a detailed picture along the whole length of the line 
of contact between Serbs and Croats. It could be around 1,000 
kilometers. That is to say that the implementation of this 
agreement will ensure that even if the sides want to shoot each 
other they will not be able to do so. There is a serious 
control procedure over this agreement on the part of the UN 
troops. That is to say that we are really talking, at last, 
about a line being drawn under the war between Serbs and Croats 
which has lasted for over two years. There have been constant 
fighting and shelling, the peaceful population has been killed 
-- both Serbs and Croats -- and one of the most volatile areas 
of conflict threatened to erupt. And if this happened it would 
for sure bury any hopes of resolving the conflict in the former 
Yugoslavia. So, this is a very serious step. 
  [Kozhukhov] But at the moment, the embers are still burning 
because, as far as I know, Serb Krajina will not agree to the 
status of even a large autonomy within Croatia. 
  [Churkin] Yes, you are right. But in conditions when it is 
impossible to start a war we believe that we can move to the 
second stage -- to arrange economic relations between Serbs and 
Croats in this region. The sides will meet again in two weeks 
on our initiative and under our mediation to discuss the 
economic issues. Then we will move to the third stage, and there 
is wide understanding between the main members of the world 
community as far as this question is concern. This stage will 
be the most difficult, as you mentioned -- to determine the 
political status of the regions where Serbs are living now under 
the protection of the United Nations. 
  [Kozhukhov] Diplomats would rather not make wild guesses. 
Nevertheless, what will happen to Bosnia? 
  [Churkin] We expect to resume the negotiating process in 
Bosnia in the next few weeks. Strictly speaking, it has never 
died away completely. An exchange of opinions continues, in 
particular, between the Americans and us. It is we and the 
Americans who are going to play the leading role now in the 
settlement efforts. 
  I think the sides will have to get in touch again and try to 
resolve, above all, the most difficult territorial issue, how to 
separate territorially the authorities in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
between the three peoples who form the state -- Serbs, Croats 
and Muslims -- and to finally define the position regarding the 
state structure of Bosnia-Herzegovina, whether it will be the 
union of Bosnia- Herzegovina, a federation, or something else. 
A lot has been done already in this respect. One thing is 
necessary though. It is necessary for the sides finally to 
decide that it is time to stop the war and switch to peace. 
Without such resoluteness of the sides, certainly, no efforts 
by international mediators can be successful. 
  [Kozhukhov] You know, I was in Belgrade at the end of last 
year and it seemed to me that, as far as the situation as a 
whole on the territory of former Yugoslavia is concerned, there 
could be no good solutions. The sides hate each other so much 
and they are so unprepared for a compromise that the incredible 
-- Yugoslavia's return within its former borders -- might be the 
best solution. 
  [Churkin] You were absolutely correct to mention this moral 
dilemma which the peoples of former Yugoslavia have to face. 
After the war which has taken place, especially on the 
territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina, any solutions which might be 
evolving now will be morally detrimental. But unfortunately, 
the clocks cannot be turned back and one cannot return 
everything to a state of affairs as it was at the beginning of 
1991. 
  [Kozhukhov] Many people in Russia think that Russia does not 
in reality have interests in Serbia, and that this topic is only 
a card in a domestic political game. What do you think about 
that? 
  [Churkin] I think that we do have interests in the Balkans, 
and we do have interests in former Yugoslavia -- political, 
economic and others; and just as important, is the fact that it 
is impossible to settle this conflict without us. We all became 
convinced of this fact in recent months when we were not 
participating so actively, and a settlement was constantly 
slipping out of reach. But again, you rightly perceive that 
sometimes this question does become the subject of a certain 
domestic political game, and passions are artificially whipped 
up over it. 
  In addition, it seems to me that some of our Serbian 
partners 
who have sensed this are trying artificially to inflate the 
question of Russian-Serbian brotherhood in order to push us into 
positions which would contravene Russia's own interests, and 
which, in the final analysis, would mean unconditional support 
for Serbian extremism. We have never allowed this in our 
position in our diplomatic and political work, and we will never 
allow it. We will implement a balanced and objective policy. 
We will have contact with all three sides, and only in this way 
can we promote a Yugoslav settlement. 
  [Kozhukhov] Do you think personally that the Ames affair was 
indeed revenge for the breakthrough in the Balkans? 
  [Churkin] No, I do not think everything is that simple. This 
is my personal view: I do not deal directly with 
Russian-American relations. But I think there has of course 
been some dissatisfaction among the opposition in the United 
States with the energetic way in which the Clinton 
administration has acted in developing relations with Russia; 
with the fact that the United States has established such good 
relations with the Russian Federation; and with the fact that 
the development of relations with Russia occupies such a major 
place in the policy of the Clinton administration. 
  Maybe Yugoslavia and Bosnia played a certain part here as 
well, but that is probably only one feature in the general 
picture of Russo-American relations.

  [Text] Comrade 'Abd-al-Ghani 'Abd-al-Ghafur, member of the 
Iraq Command of the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party, has relayed the 
greetings of leader President Saddam Husayn to the chairman and 
members of the fifth congress of the Russian Liberal Democratic 
Party [LDP], which began its work in Moscow today. 
  In a speech delivered at the congress, comrade 'Abd-al-Ghani 
'Abd-al-Ghafur said: It pleases me to relay the greetings of 
leader President Saddam Husayn, as well as those of the 
steadfast Iraqi people, and the cadres of the Arab Socialist 
Ba'th Party cadres to the leaders and cadres of your party and 
the friendly Russian people. The Ba'th Party wishes every 
success for the congress in its efforts to achieve the LDP's 
objectives in the interest of Russia and its future. 
  'Abd-al-Ghafur added: The LDP congress is being held under 
complicated international circumstances, in which world peoples 
are resisting all that has been brought by the so-called new 
world order; namely, the U.S. attempts to dominate the world, 
and the double standards employed in handling the issues of 
international legitimacy, democracy, and human rights, and 
abusing these values to interfere in the domestic affairs of 
world peoples and deny them the right to lead the free and 
decent life they deserve, not to mention the use of the United 
Nations to oppress world peoples in violation of the UN Charter 
and international conventions through the enforcement of 
embargoes against world peoples to achieve selfish and rancorous 
political objectives. 
  'Abd-al-Ghafur noted that the Iraqi people have been 
suffering from an unfair and tyrannical embargo for the past 
four years because they are determined to walk the path they 
have chosen, and also because they are opposed to U.S. bids to 
control their resources and undermine their national 
sovereignty. He noted that the enforcement of the embargo 
against Iraq is a form of international dictatorship practiced 
by the United States against the world community and the United 
Nations in order to achieve its objective of domination. 
  'Abd-al-Ghafur called for the lifting of the economic 
embargo 
clamped on the Iraqi people, saying: Iraq has fulfilled all its 
commitments per the relevant UN Security Council resolutions, 
even though they are unfair resolutions, at a time when the 
Council has failed to honor its commitments toward Iraq due to 
U.S. interference. This has been clearly manifest during the 
recent UN Security Council deliberations. For the first time, 
there has been a rift among the UN Security Council members, 
particularly the permanent members. The positions of Russia, 
the PRC, and France were marked by a measure of objectivity. 
These positions marked a departure from the U.S. position, and 
insisted that Iraq be granted some of its rights by way of 
implementing Paragraph 22 of UN Security Council Resolution 687, 
which allows Iraq to export its oil. 
  The Iraqi official hoped that Russia's recent position at 
the 
UN Security Council will be promoted and become more effective 
to help lift the embargo and end the sufferings of the Iraqi 
people. He asked the congress to attach special attention to 
the issue of enforcing embargoes on peoples as a means to 
achieve political objectives to the detriment of these peoples' 
interests. He also urged the conferees to come up with 
decisions and recommendations demanding an end to the embargo 
clamped on the Iraqi people, particularly since Iraq has 
fulfilled all its commitments. 
  The Ba'th official commended the struggle being waged by the 
Russian people to uphold their dignity, sovereignty, and 
independent decisionmaking, as well as their rejection of 
attempts to impose custodianship and domination on them and the 
attempts being made by some international forces that profess 
false concern for them and their future at a time when they seek 
to weaken Russia, because it is not in their interest to see 
Russia reemerge as a powerful country occupying its deserved 
position and standing in today's world. 
  'Abd-al-Ghafur stressed that the Iraqi people will never 
abandon their freedom, dignity, independence, and their right to 
walk the path they have chosen to ensure their livelihood, 
because they are well aware that people who are stripped of 
their dignity, freedom, and independent decisionmaking are 
rendered lifeless. He reaffirmed that the Iraqi people will 
continue their struggle and maintain their support for the 
leadership of His Excellency President Saddam Husayn, given that 
he is the symbol of the struggles waged by the Iraqi people, the 
Arab nation, and humanity against global injustice and 
oppression. 
  This speech by the member of the Iraq Command of the Ba'th 
Party was welcomed by thunderous applause to show solidarity 
with the just struggle waged by the Iraqi people, and with their 
heroic confrontation of the forces of evil and aggression. 
  In an opening speech, LDP Chairman Vladimir Zhirinovskiy had 
earlier asserted his party's total solidarity with the Iraqi 
leadership and people, and its support for the just struggle 
being waged by the Iraqi people to promote their freedom, 
dignity, and independence. He urged the Russian leadership, on 
behalf of the party and its fifth congress, to do whatever is 
necessary to lift all aspects of the embargo clamped on Iraq. 
He reiterated his party's firm position on the issue, and its 
persistent efforts in internal and external forums to achieve 
this objective, and end the Iraqi people's sufferings. 
  Zhirinovskiy urged his party members to close ranks and make 
persistent efforts to promote the great accomplishments the 
party has recently made, the accomplishments that have allowed 
it to enter the Parliament, and that will allow it to win the 
Russian presidency during the next elections. 
  The LDP leader criticized the deteriorating situation in 
Russia, and held the current Russian leadership fully 
responsible for the current situation in the country. He also 
denounced the plots being concocted against his party by certain 
government structures in Russia. He called for enhancing the 
powers of the party leaders. 
  Some 343 delegates and 865 guests, including 14 foreign 
delegations, attended the congress meetings. 
  Among the most important developments seen during the fifth 
congress was a decision to hold the party congress every three 
years, and a decision authorizing the congress to elect the 
party leader, whereas the party leader shall appoint the party 
command members and his close aides.

  [Text] Moscow, 3 Apr (INA)--'Abd-al-Ghani 'Abd-al-Ghafur, 
member of the Iraq Command of the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party, 
met with Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, chairman of the Russian Liberal 
Democratic Party [LDP], in Moscow today. 
  At the outset of the meeting, the Ba'th Party Iraq Command 
member relayed the greetings of His Excellency President Saddam 
Husayn to Zhirinovskiy and the leadership of his friendly party. 
He also informed Zhirinovskiy that his excellency the 
president, the Iraqi leadership, and the Iraqi people appreciate 
the supportive positions Zhirinovskiy and his party have taken 
to enlist support for ending the unfair embargo clamped on Iraq. 
  'Abd-al-Ghani 'Abd-al-Ghafur also informed Valdimir 
Zhirinovskiy that the situation in Iraq is stable, that the 
Iraqi people are rallying around the leadership of His 
Excellency President Saddam Husayn, and that the Iraqi people 
are determined to break the economic embargo through patience, 
jihad, and constant construction. 
  The Ba'th Party official explained the suffering of the 
Iraqi 
people as a result of the continued enforcement of the unfair 
economic embargo clamped on them. He stressed the need for 
friendly nationalist parties, headed by the LDP, to make 
additional vigorous efforts to ensure the lifting of the 
embargo, and the implementation of Paragraph 22 of UN Security 
Council Resolution 687. 
  For his part, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy asked 'Abd-al-Ghani 
'Abd-al- Ghafur to communicate his warm greetings to His 
Excellency President Saddam Husayn. He also expressed his 
thanks for his excellency the president for sending a personal 
envoy, on behalf of the Ba'th Party, to the fifth LDP congress. 
  Zhirinovskiy reiterated the LDP's support for the just 
struggle being waged by the Iraqi people, adding that his party 
will do its best in internal and external forums to bring about 
a total revocation of the economic embargo clamped on the Iraqi 
people. 
  On the sidelines of the fifth LDP congress, 'Abd-al-Ghani 
'Abd- al-Ghafur also met with Vesiline Kuchev [name as 
received], chairman of the Bulgarian Liberal Democratic Party, 
who is attending the work of the congress. 
  During the meeting, they discussed bilateral ties and means 
of promoting them in the interest of the friendly Iraqi and 
Bulgarian peoples. 
  The Ba'th official explained that Iraq has fulfilled all its 
commitments in the relevant UN Security Council resolutions, 
although they are unfair and iniquitous, at a time when the UN 
Security Council has failed to honor any of the provisions 
enshrined in Resolution 687. He urged concerted efforts by all 
honorable forces in the world to launch a front opposed to evil 
powers in the world in order to mobilize efforts to lift the 
economic embargo clamped on Iraq, because it is an embargo 
targeting all liberation forces on the globe. 
  The meeting was attended by 'Abd-al-Razzaq al-Hashimi, head 
of the Foreign Relations Bureau of the Iraq Command of the Arab 
Socialist Ba'th Party and delegation member, as well as the 
Iraqi ambassador to the Russian Federation.

  [Text] Moscow, 2 Apr -- Several staff members of the DPRK 
Embassy in Moscow attempted last Wednesday to unlawfully acquire 
items of military equipment, an ITAR-TASS correspondent has been 
informed by competent sources. It is a matter precisely of 
items of military equipment and not of a list of Russian-made 
armaments, as reported by the Japanese ASAHI newspaper. 
  Contrary to that newspaper's claims, the embassy staff 
members were not arrested, since they enjoy diplomatic immunity. 
  As far as the essence of the incident is concerned, a 
statement is expected on the matter within the next few days 
from the public relations center of the Russian Federal 
Counterintelligence Service.

  [Excerpts] Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev today 
received a delegation from the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly. 
Our correspondent Ramiz Meshelihesenli reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Meshelihesenli] After sincerely greeting 
the delegation headed by Medetkan Sherimkulov, chairman of the 
Kyrgyzstan Supreme Council, Geydar Aliyev provided detailed 
information on Armenia's aggressive war against Azerbaijan and 
on the tragic consequences resulting from it. The Azerbaijani 
president said that to date Armenia has failed to implement 
concrete proposals and agreements worked out during the 
Interparliamentary Assembly meeting in Moscow last September, 
and that these agreements remained on paper. 
  It was reported that the agreements worked out by the 
initiative of the international organizations and Russia for the 
peaceful resolution of the conflict have been derailed because 
of the Armenian side's disregard for them. What is more, 
Armenia is not abiding by any of the four resolutions adopted by 
the UN Security Council; rather, it is organizing new 
large-scale offensives against Azerbaijan and is not putting an 
end to its policy of occupation. Armenia will pursue its 
aggressive aims unless punished by international organizations. 
  Geydar Aliyev also reminded the delegation that it was again 
Armenia that undermined the agreements reached during the 
meeting between the chairmen of the Armenian and Azerbaijani 
parliaments. 
  As additional proof of Armenian aggression, Aliyev noted 
that 
it was Armenians who shot down the Iranian plane over Karabakh. 
  The Republic's president indicated that he is hopeful of the 
new peace initiative of the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly's 
delegation. 
  Medetkan Sherimkulov, who heads the CIS delegation, thanked 
Aliyev for his detailed information on the situation. He added 
that their efforts aim at settling the conflict by peaceful 
means. The delegation proposed that the chairmen of the 
Azerbaijani and Armenian parliaments meet in Bishkek in the 
first ten days of May. 
  The delegation will leave for Yukhari-Karabakh 
[Nagorno-Karabakh] today. 
  When Medetkan Sherimkulov noted the need for the 
representatives of the Armenian community of Yukhari-Karabakh to 
be present at the Bishkek meeting, the Azerbaijani president 
replied: [Aliyev's statement in Russian omitted] 
  [Meshelihesenli] Afiaddin Dzhalilov, deputy chairman of the 
Republic's Supreme Soviet; Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov; State 
Adviser Vafa Gulizade; Deputy Prime Minister Abbas Abbasov; 
Namik Akhundov, chairman of the Supreme Soviet Commission on 
International Ties; Vladimir Kazimirov, Russian special 
ambassador on the Karabakh problem; and other officials took 
part in the meeting. [end recording]

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Sevindzh Abdullayeva, Sergey </F>
Ostanin, and Viktor Shulman] 
  [Text] Baku April 1 TASS -- The idea to hold a meeting of 
Azeri and Armenian parliament members in Bishkek early this May 
was backed by Azeri President Geydar Aliyev here today. He 
announced his decision during a meeting with a delegation of the 
CIS interparliamentary assembly, which arrived in Baku on 
Thursday. 
  At the same time, the head of the Azeri state objected to 
the 
participation of Nagorno-Karabakh representatives in this 
meeting. He said that "Karabakh was part and parcel of 
Azerbaijan, not a state. The structures, artificially set up in 
this region during the conflict, have nothing to do with the CIS 
Interparliamentary Assembly. Aliyev said this question was open 
for discussion. The president believes that the Bishkek meeting 
should be well prepared: it is necessary to achieve definite 
positive changes in the confrontation zone, thereby creating a 
favourable foundation for talks between the parliament speakers 
of the two republics. 
  "In this sense," Aliyev stressed, "I pin great hopes on the 
peace-making mission of the delegation of the CIS 
Interparliamentary Assembly." He noted that its present 
composition differed qualitatively from that of the previous 
delegation, formed last autumn by this supranational CIS 
institution for the purpose of settling the Armenian-Azeri 
conflict. 
  The head of the Azeri state specially noted the need to work 
out approaches to the settlement of the conflict. In his 
opinion, the principle "of equal responsibility of both sides" 
was unacceptable, "because the hostilities are occurring on 
Azeri territory and a considerable part of the republic is 
occupied". The Commonwealth of Independent States, the Azeri 
president stressed, "cannot and must not remain indifferent to 
the fact that two states that are members of the Commonwealth 
and signatories of its collective security treaty are actually 
in a state of war." 
  In the opinion of Medetkan Shirinkulov, chairman of the 
Kirghizian [Kyrgyz] Supreme Soviet, who heads the CIS 
parliamentary delegation, "there are grounds for an important 
conversation in Bishkek". It could be based on the new Russian 
draft document for solving the Karabakh problem, forwarded today 
to the Azeri side by Vladimir Kazimirov, envoy of the Russian 
president. 
  The contents of this draft and details of its implementation 
were discussed behind closed doors. The delegation plans to 
visit Stepanakert today afternoon.

  [Excerpts] According to its schedule, the CIS delegation 
[led by Medetkan Sherimkulov, chairman of the Kyrgyzstan Supreme 
Council] was to go to Khankendi [Stepanakert] from Baku, and 
from there to Yerevan. But for some reason the guests left for 
Yerevan instead of Khankendi. 
  [Begin recording] [correspondent Mehmen Qayibov] The 
delegation left Baku airport for Yerevan. The guests were seen 
off by Supreme Soviet Deputy Chairman Afiaddin Dzhalilov, Deputy 
Prime Minister Abbas Abbasov, and other officials. 
  Before the delegation's departure we interviewed its 
members. 
[passage omitted on Sherimkulov statement in Russian] 
  [Qayibov] Mr. Afiaddin Dzhalilov, certain changes have been 
introduced into the delegation's program. What can you say on 
this? 
  [Dzhalilov] As Mr. Sherimkulov said [words indistinct]. I 
want to state that at first the Armenian side accepted our 
program but later they opposed Mr. Sherimkulov's delegation 
going to Stepanakert, that is Khankendi, via Agdam. Thus, the 
Armenians disrupted the program unilaterally. However, Mr. 
Sherimkulov's personal peace mission is continuing. He will now 
be flying to Armenia. From there he will go to Tbilisi, then to 
Karabakh, and then to Baku again at the invitation of Geydar 
Aliyev. [end recording]

  [Text] Saturday in the village of Berdadzor in 
Nagorno-Karabakh's Shusha region, the peacemaking mission of the 
CIS Inter-Parliamentary assembly and representatives of 
Nagorno-Karabakh authorities discussed the possibility of the 
participation of this self-proclaimed republic in the meeting 
between the heads of the Armenian and Azerbaijani parliaments 
devoted to the settlement of the Karabakh conflict. Interfax 
received this information from well informed sources in Yerevan, 
the Armenian capital. The negotiations between the delegations 
in Berdadzor which is situated at equal distances from Armenia 
and Nagorno-Karabakh were held behind the closed doors and there 
was no official information about the meeting. 
  The negotiations between the parliament speakers of two 
conflicting republics are scheduled for early May in Bishkek, 
the Kyrgyz capital. 
  Our Interfax correspondent who accompanies the mission of 
the 
Inter-Parliamentary Assembly reports that during the meeting in 
Berdadzor the parties spoke in favor of the participation of the 
Nagorno-Karabakh delegation in these talks. 
  Some time earlier Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev spoke 
against participation of Nagorno-Karabakh representatives in the 
negotiations. In his opinion, representatives of the 
parliaments of the Commonwealth's member-countries must 
participate in the talks. 
  On Thursday the peacemaking mission of the CIS Inter- 
Parliamentary Assembly headed by the chairman of the Kyrgyz 
parliament Meditkan Sherimkulov held negotiations in Baku and 
Yerevan. 
  The delegation of the Inter-Parliamentary Assembly is 
expected to return to Moscow in the evening of April 2.

  [Text] The Russian plan of the settlement in Karabakh 
envisages a solution of the Armenian-Azeri conflict in stages, a 
Russian presidential representative at the talks on the 
settlement of the Armenian-Azeri conflict Vladimir Kazimirov 
told journalists in Baku. 
  He said that first it is planned to carry out a gradual 
ceasefire and to separate forces. After that it would be 
possible to start talks on the status of Nagorno-Karabakh. 
"Anyway the principle "peace in exchange for territories" for 
the Karabakh conflict is unacceptable, the diplomat said. 
  Kazimirov spoke in favor of sending peacekeeping forces to 
the region, of which Russian troops could be a part. Only in 
that case, he said, it would be possible to guarantee a 
ceasefire and a lasting peace in the conflict zone.

  [Text] The settlement of the Karabakh problems must be 
based on the principle of Azerbaijan's territorial integrity and 
the inviolability of its borders, Azerbaijani President Gaydar 
Aliyev told the permanent French representatives in the Minsk 
Group. 
  He said that these two principles may lay a foundation for 
talks on ending all combat operations. 
  Azerbaijan lays no claims on foreign territories, including 
the territory of Armenia, he said. He also pointed out that 
Azerbaijan was the victim of Armenian aggression. 
  Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Hasan Hasanov told the French 
representatives that the status of Nagorno Karabakh might only 
be discussed after the liberation of the occupied Azerbaijani 
territories. This problem must become the subject of talks 
between Karabakh's Azerbaijani and Armenian communities, said 
Hasanov.

  [Text] Baku (March 31) TURAN -- Today Musavat Party made a 
statement. It says that on March 29 when the session of Milli 
Majlis [National Assembly] came to an end, the People's Deputy 
and a member of Musavat Party, Adalyat Ragimli, was beaten 
unmercifully by the Adviser of President's State Adviser, Neymat 
Panakhli, in the building of the Parliament. 
  The essential fact is that Adalyat Ragimli criticized the 
policy of the current Azeri government and their attempts to 
shift the blame for the events of January 1990 onto the Popular 
[People's] Front. 
  The Deputy was beaten in the presence of the employees of 
Supreme Soviet, Minister of Internal Affairs and Procurator 
General of the republic. 
  The statement of Musavat Party demands to take necessary 
measures to punish Neymat Panakhli. "Otherwise reconciliation 
between different political forces in the republic will be 
impossible".

  [Text] Negotiators from Georgia and its separatist region 
of Abkhazia have reached a ceasefire agreement, Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev said. 
  He told Interfax and Moscow's Ostankino Television that the 
negotiators, at talks in Moscow mediated by Russian and U.N. 
representatives, also hammered out a solution to the refugee 
problem that conforms to the international law and allows all 
those who have left their homes to come back, with the exception 
of those proved guilty of fanning up the conflict. 
  Some other legal problems, including that of Abkhazia's 
status, are still unsolved and will be tackled at the next round 
of talks, Kozyrev said. 
  A formal Georgian-Abkhazian ceasefire accord is expected to 
be signed in Moscow in the presence of Russian and U.N. 
officials on Monday.

  [Text] Sochi April 4 TASS -- The Georgian-Abkhaz agreement 
signed today "contains an unequivocal and clear recognition of 
Georgia's territorial integrity with guarantees of a broad 
autonomy for Abkhazia", State Duma Committee Chairman Konstantin 
Zatulin said in Sochi today. 
  He explained that for this reason, the agreement suits both 
sides. 
  Zatulin recalled that the agreement signed between Georgia 
and Abkhazia with the participation of the Russian Federation 
and the United Nations contains two documents: "One is related 
to the refugee problems, and the other concerns political 
settlement of the conflict between Georgia and Abkhazia". 
  Zatulin described accords reached in Moscow as "very 
positive, because any other solution would have threatened war".

<F P=106> [Video report from Tbilisiby correspondent Ugza Keresilidze, </F>
including recording of comments by Georgian Head of State Eduard 
Shevardnadze and Boris Kakubava, leader of the Organization for 
the Liberation of Abkhazia] 
  [Text] [Announcer] The Georgian parliament has already 
expressed its opinion about the documents signed in Moscow 
between Georgia and Abkhazia. 
  [Keresilidze] At an unscheduled session today behind closed 
doors, the Georgian parliament discussed the Abkhazian issue and 
determined its position on the agreements reached in Moscow with 
the Abkhazian side, with Russian participation. It was easy to 
judge the level of passion generated by the issue under 
examination by looking at the faces of the deputies coming out 
into the foyer. The parliament has evidently split into two 
camps -- the supporters and opponents of the agreements. During 
the interval Eduard Shevardnadze appraised the agreement reached 
in Moscow like this: 
  [Shevardnadze] I believe that they achieved the maximum 
which 
it was necessary to agree at the present stage, and the minimum 
which is needed for a decision to be taken in the Security 
Council on the introduction of peacekeeping forces into 
Abkhazia. Without the introduction of peacekeeping forces there 
will be no return of refugees. Personally, at the present 
stage, the agreement suits me. Parliament's opinion is 
unimportant. 
  [Keresilidze] The parliamentary opposition has called these 
agreements -- the text of which, incidentally, was not given to 
the deputies -- treason. It demanded that the Georgian 
delegation be recalled from Moscow and the agreements denounced. 
Boris Kakubava, leader of the Organization for the Liberation 
of Abkhazia, the most radically minded as regards the head of 
state's policy, stated: 
  [Kakubava] As long as Shevardnadze is the leader at the helm 
in Georgia, this policy will continue. But this will probably 
not be for long, because the Georgian people will understand 
that Shevardnadze is a leader who works only for Russia. 
  [Keresilidze] Shevardnadze in his turn highly appraised 
Russia's role in achieving the agreement, and noted the positive 
influence of UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, who was 
present at the talks. 
  [Shevardnadze] With his presence the secretary general 
stressed the significance of this stage. I think that we should 
value the true worth of this. I personally am grateful that he 
will agree to participate in this process once again.

  [Text] The head of the CSCE mission in Georgia, Aleksandr 
Tsvetkov, has described the situation in South Ossetia as 
extremely complicated. Since the deployment of peacekeeping 
forces a year ago, none of the parties have taken a step to 
begin a comprehensive settlement of the conflict. He has 
expressed the mission's concern over the trends of ethnic 
confrontation that have aroused lately as well as an 
administrative and political isolation. 
  The head of the mission named the return of refugees to the 
places of their permanent residence as one of the most 
complicated problems. According to the data possessed by the 
CSCE, these include 11,000 ethnic Ossetian refugees staying in 
the territory of North Ossetia and 7,000 ethnic Georgians 
accommodated mainly in the territory of Gori Rayon. 
  Commenting on the issue of elections to the State Nikhas 
[supreme soviet] held in Tskhinvali recently, the head of the 
mission has said that their results have a significance for the 
determination of internal political arrangement of forces in the 
region. According to him, until the newly elected body starts 
to work, it will be difficult to form an opinion whether a 
policy carried out by Tskhinvali authorities toward the Georgian 
leadership since the beginning of the conflict is undergoing any 
changes. 
  We expect both sides to take actions directed toward the 
settlement of the conflict, said the head of the CSCE mission. 
For our part, we can assist in inviting experts of 
international standards on handling ethnic conflicts and 
national problems.

  [Text] Tbilisi, April 1 (SNARK) -- Today Abkhazian forces 
managed to capture Lata, a settlement in the Kodor Canyon. The 
sides were combating for it with variable success during over a 
week. Thus, Abkhazian forces got a real chance to take under 
their control all the Kodor Canyon, which is the last territory 
in Abkhazia under Georgian control. 
  Georgian authorities undertake emergency measures to 
evacuate 
the population by helicopters from the Canyon. 
  Jaba Ioseliani, Head of the Georgian Emergency Committee, 
told SNARK the situation is extremely strained in the Kodor 
Canyon. "Georgian volunteers are struggling against regular 
Abkhazian forces, armed to the teeth". The peaceful negotiation 
he was coordinating failed. Nevertheless, the dialog should be 
continued, said Mr. Ioseliani.

  [Text] Tbilisi, 2 Apr -- Eduard Shevardnadze, as head of 
Georgia and commander in chief of its Armed Forces, who at the 
same time assumed the responsibilities of the country's defense 
minister, held an expanded sitting of the military department in 
Tbilisi today. According to information, alongside organization 
and cadre matters involved in military construction, the 
situation in Abkhazia was discussed. 
  Local observers -- comparing this report with information 
received from Abkhazian sources today that there is an unusual 
concentration of Georgian manpower and combat equipment on the 
Inguri river separating the warring sides -- think it is 
possible that a wide-scale offensive on Sukhumi might be 
launched in the next few days. 
  It is not ruled out that the final objective will be to 
reach 
the border with Russia along the Psou river and take control of 
the whole territory of the Autonomous Republic of Abkhazia.

  [Text] Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze declared that 
the republic has a great potential in order to raise its 
economy. During the meeting with the mission of the 
International Monetary Fund, on a visit in Tbilisi, he also said 
that at present hunger and economy's freezing are the most 
serious dangers threatening the republic. In Shevardnadze's 
words, Georgia will fulfill all recommendations of the 
International Monetary Fund which is expected to grant $60 Mn to 
Tbilisi. 
  For his part, Mohamed Shadman Valavi, head of the IMF 
mission, expressed his opinion saying that the IMF apparently 
should take care of Georgia in order to provide for its support 
on the part of industrial states. 
  Our Interfax correspondents report that during the meeting 
the parties spoke not only about long-term programs of 
cooperation but about the ways to solve Georgia's most pressing 
problems.

  [Text] The Abkhazian Supreme Soviet Chairman, Vladislav 
Ardzinba, told Interfax today that the current non-official 
consultations between representatives of Sukhumi and Tbilisi did 
not mean the renewal of Georgian-Abkhazian negotiations. 
Ardzinba said this would require cancellation of the Georgian 
parliament's resolution on the dismissal of the Abkhazian 
parliament which had in fact broken the negotiations. 
  Ardzinba also expressed his regret due to continuing 
economic 
sanctions against Abkhazia which had been imposed by Russia. 
"The Abkhazian population has suffered from the burden of the 
war and is now restoring the republic. However, it has been 
deprived of the most necessary things. Primarily, this concerns 
the mainly urban Russian-speaking population," Ardzinba stressed. 
  Ardzinba pointed out that Abkhazian society was indignant 
about the Russian sanctions. "Instead of friendly assistance 
they are trying to starve us," Ardzinba said. He suggested this 
was the policy of a certain Russian department which often spoke 
in defense of Russian-speaking populations living abroad. 
However, this did not seem to be being put into practice. 
  Ardzinba stressed that rail transport through Abkhazian 
territory could be renewed in spite of all difficulties. "We 
guarantee the security for the movement of both people and 
goods," he pointed out. 
  Commenting on the situation in the Kodor Canyon and on the 
Abkhazian-Georgian border formed by the Inguri River, Ardzinba 
said it was in general stable. The Georgian military formations 
which had occupied the village of Lata since autumn 1993 had 
been forced to retreat to the mountains. 
  "Abkhazian armed forces control the situation on the Inguri 
River," Ardzinba emphasized. 
  The Abkhazian Press and Information Ministry told Interfax 
that the situation in the Kodor Canyon villages was normalizing. 
  The UN mission of military observers in Abkhazia visited the 
villages of Lower Lata and Upper Lata on March 31 from where 
Georgian troops have been forced. The head of the UN mission 
said in an interview with Interfax that he would inform the UN 
Security Council on the last events in the Kodor Canyon.

<F P=106> [Appeal to the Abkhazian people from the movement "For a </F>
Peaceful Abkhazia!" issued on 20 March; place not given: "We 
Will Be Forced To Oppose Ardzinba's Regime With Weapons in Our 
Hands!"] 
  [Text] Dear Compatriots! 
  The representatives of the movement "For a Peaceful 
Abkhazia!" are appealing to you once again. 
  Our dear brothers and sisters! History will not forgive our 
indifference and passivity in the face of the total catastrophe 
threatening the small Abkhazian nation. Therefore, we appealed 
to the UN secretary general, the president of the Russian 
Federation, and the chairman of the Republic of Georgia 
Parliament-head of state to adopt the most urgent and cardinal 
measures for the most speedy peaceful settlement in Abkhazia. 
In our appeal, we asked them to use all the levers at their 
disposal to force Ardzinba and his grouping to engage in a 
constructive dialogue, abandon their sick ambitions of which the 
Abkhazian people and the representatives of other nations living 
in Abkhazia have become hostages. 
  In our appeal, we warned that, if our voice was not heard, 
we 
would be forced to oppose the Ardzinba regime with weapons in 
our hands because the fate of the Abkhazian people was in danger. 
  Unfortunately, no one, as yet, has responded to our appeal. 
Therefore, we ask all those who hold dear the fate of our fine 
motherland Abkhazia and the fate of our children: Help us so 
that our voice may be heard by the authoritative leaders of 
international organizations and the heads of states and social 
movements who could contribute to the matter of the speediest 
settlement of the conflict. 
  We appeal once more to all the inhabitants of Abkhazia, to 
all who, by the will of fate, found themselves on Abkhazian land 
with weapons in their hands: Enough bloodshed and violence! 
Let the coming spring of 1994 be a spring of hope and peace! 
  Our appeal is not a cry of despair; it is a call from the 
souls of people who realize that we all stand on the edge of the 
abyss. We are ready to turn our weapons on those politicians who 
have lost their sense of reality in order to prevent our people 
from perishing.

<F P=106> [Appeal "To UN Secretary General Batono (Georgian polite </F>
form of address) Butrus Butrus-Ghali, Russian Federation 
President Batono Boris Yeltsin, Batono Eduard Shevardnadze, 
chairman of the Republic of Georgia Parliament-head of state" 
from the movement "For a Peaceful Abkhazia!" issued on 19 March; 
place not given: "The Movement `For a Peaceful Abkhazia' Has 
Declared War Against Separatism and National Chauvinism! If Our 
Voice Is Not Heard...!"] 
  [Text] This appeal comes from representatives of the 
social movement "For a Peaceful Abkhazia!" On behalf of the 
inhabitants of Abkhazia who have been driven to despair, we ask 
you to adopt the most urgent and extreme measures to establish 
peace and harmony on the long-suffering Abkhazian land. As a 
result of the criminal policy of the Gudauta adventurists in 
Abkhazia, genocide is being perpetrated on the entire population 
of this once prosperous and blessed land. Abkhazians, 
Georgians, Armenians, and Russians and the representatives of 
other nationalities are either leaving the Republic or being 
forcibly banished from it. Out of the population of more than 
500,000, little more than 100,000 remain. Unless the United 
Nations becomes immediately involved and the most cardinal 
measures are taken, the continuing genocide against the 
population of Abkhazia could lead to the most irreparable 
consequences. 
  We ask you to use all your authority and all the means at 
your disposal to force the incompetent leaders who have led the 
republic into a blind alley to take constructive steps aimed at 
settling the conflict. Ardzinba and his close associates have 
neither the moral nor the legal right to speak on behalf of the 
Abkhazian people, on behalf of all the peoples of Abkhazia, 
because the majority of the electorate is roaming on foreign 
soil as refugees, forcibly displaced persons, or emigrants. 
  We ask you to hear the voice of the long-suffering people of 
Abkhazia, mothers who have lost their sons in a senseless war, 
old people and children who have been deprived of shelter, and 
men and workers who are longing for creative labor. 
  We ask the Russian president, Batoni Yeltsin, to introduce 
peacekeeping troops into Abkhazia; we believe that Russian 
troops will be able to bring peace and calm to Abkhazia. 
  We appeal to Batoni Shevardnadze to ensure public order in 
Abkhazia by means of Georgian police. 
  We ask for the right to life, peace, and the happiness of 
our 
children. Do not refuse us this. If our voice is not heard, if 
Ardzinba and his close associates are given, as before, the 
opportunity to bury all attempts aimed at a peaceful settlement 
in demagogic ruses, we will be forced to oppose the Ardzinba 
regime with weapons in our hands. The Abkhazians are a small 
nation. We have already paid too high a price for the excessive 
ambitions of these politicians. We will not allow the entire 
Abkhazian nation to be wiped off the face of the earth. 
  The movement "For a Peaceful Abkhazia!"

<F P=106> [Interview with Member of Parliament Boris Kakubava, leader </F>
of the Union for the Liberation of Abkhazia, by Eteri Kakabadze; 
place and date not given: "`I Even Know This Man'"] 
  [Text]The mass media are currently disseminating statements 
from the newly formed Abkhazian movement "For a Peaceful 
Abkhazia" in which there are calls for more radical efforts to 
settle the conflict in Abkhazia and bring about the return of 
refugees to their native homes. 
  It is clearly stated in them that, if politicians are unable 
to agree, the healthy part of the Abkhazian nation will deal 
with Ardzinba's hateful regime by force of arms for all the 
suffering caused and the tears and blood shed by its people. 
Unfortunately, there is, as yet, no reliable information 
regarding the authors of these statements and to what extent 
they represent an influential force. In any case, Vice Prime 
Minister Tamaz Nadareishvili said, in his response to these 
statements, that he pins great hopes on the new movement, 
believing that a serious opposition to Ardzinba and his henchmen 
has appeared. Member of Parliament Boris Kakubava, leader of 
the Union for the Liberation of Abkhazia, holds a different view. 
  In an exclusive interview to our paper, he stated that, in 
actual fact, no movement exists and, at best, it is represented 
by one person and he even knows who this is. Boris Kakubava 
called the movement "For a Peaceful Abkhazia" a one-man show run 
by someone preoccupied with immediate interests. 
  [Kakubava] One can hardly find a dozen Abkhazians today who 
do not feel intense hostility toward Georgians and Georgia. 
This hatred has been nurtured in them for decades and, 
moreover, not without help from the policies being conducted by 
Shevardnadze. From where could such an entire movement appear? 
I believe this movement was not created in Sukhumi, but here in 
Tbilisi with the aim of misleading the people and passing off 
desire for reality. It is possible this has been done with good 
intentions in order to pacify the hundreds of thousands of 
refugees: According to him, a split has already been noticed in 
Abkhazia and, along with this, the chance has appeared for the 
refugees to return to their native villages. I believe that the 
return of Georgians to Abkhazia is in the hands of the Union for 
the Liberation of Abkhazia, that is to say in our hands. No 
other forces will help us in this. 
  [Kakabadze] Do you think that the Geneva negotiations hold 
any prospects or have they already lost their meaning? 
  [Kakubava] All Georgia already knows my views regarding 
these negotiations. I still believe that the series of talks 
that has already taken place will harm Georgia's interests. It 
has come about that the peaceful community has learnt that there 
is an enslaved Georgian country called Abkhazia and that 1 
percent of its population has won a war against the remaining 99 
percent. We are so impotent that we ourselves cannot stand up 
for the integrity of our state and are asking anyone for help. 
We need neither UN troops nor the help of the world community, 
especially Russia, to get Abkhazia back. We need the world 
community and the United Nations for one thing only -- to 
protect us from Russia's interference in our internal affairs. 
This is our main problem; the rest we can do ourselves.

  [Text] Tbilisi, April 1 (AFP) -- The Tbilisi police chief, 
opposed to leader Eduard Shevardnadze's nomination of a new 
interior minister, refused Friday [1 April] to leave his post 
after being sacked and remained holed up in police headquarters 
with armed bodyguards. 
  General David Zaikidze was dismissed late Thursday after he 
and hundreds of his men occupied the Georgian Parliament for 
several hours in protest over the appointment of Shota Kviraya 
as interior minister. 
  In an interview with AFP, General David Zaikidze denied 
rumors he had given Shevardnadze three days to sack Kviraya whom 
he contends is unfit for the job. He said he did not have 
designs on the post himself. 
  "I don't want to be interior minister. We simply claim that 
Kviraya has made many mistakes since he began in the post," 
Zaikidze said. 
  Kviraya was officially appointed Thursday but has been 
acting 
interior minister for the past three months. 
  Prior to the interview, there were loud shouts in Zaikidze's 
office after which a representative of Shevardnadze stormed out. 
  The rebel police chief was holed up in his office in the 
city 
police headquarters in the southern district of Sabordale under 
tight security. 
  Zaikidze said he would not go against Shevardnadze and the 
parliament but said "that they (parliament) must listen to our 
requests and demands and the head of state must also listen to 
us and reach a decision". 
  The atmosphere at police headquarters was tense, with 
Zaikidze bodyguards all carrying automatic weapons. 
  The general commands around 7,000 officers in Tbilisi and 
his 
aides claim that the city police fully back the general.

  [Text] Tbilisi April 1 TASS -- The Georgian parliament 
adopted a resolution on Friday concerning an incident which took 
place in the parliamentary building on Thursday, when the former 
chief of the Tbilisi police, assisted by his colleagues, 
attempted to thwart a procedure of endorsing the Georgian 
defence minister to his post. 
  The document adopted by the Georgian parliament qualified 
actions by Mayor-General David Zeikidze as an attempt to topple 
the parliament by force. 
  It was pointed out that as a result of clashes, a member of 
the government and a member of the Georgian leader's staff were 
seriously injured. 
  The parliament took into account that criminal proceedings 
had been instituted on this incident and instructed the Georgian 
Interior Ministry to take necessary measures to "restore order 
in the city police department."

  [Text] Tbilisi, April 1 (SNARK)--Today Georgian Parliament 
considers the encroachment of the group of armored policemen 
headed by the Tbilisi Police Chief David Zeikidze into the 
building of the Parliament as an attempt of pressure -- to 
influence the decision to appoint Shota Kviraya for the position 
of the Georgian Home Affaires Minister. The only person who 
expressed his "no" to the appointment was Kartlos Garibashvili, 
a leader of the democratic faction of the Georgian Parliament. 
  Meanwhile, Ramin Chelidze, Head of the press-center of the 
Georgian Parliament, told SNARK today Speaker of the Parliament 
and his deputies met with Zeikidze and his supporters. Despite 
the fact that David Zeikidze still speaks for the abolition of 
the decision, the employees of the Georgian Home Affairs 
Ministry are ready to go on with their duties. 
  Today, the mutual session of the Georgian Home Affairs 
Ministry, the Ministry of National Security, the Tbilisi mayor, 
the Office of Georgian Public Prosecutor accepted the decision 
to relieve Zeikidze of his position. Major-General Temur 
Mikadze has been appointed for this position.

  [Text] Tbilisi, April 2 (SNARK)--"If I wished to carry out 
a military overthrow, I would have done it", told in his 
exclusive interview to SNARK today General David Zeikidze, the 
earlier removed commander of the Tbilisi police. 
  As already reported, he rushed in the Georgian Parliament 
building with a group of armed policemen, for which fact he 
found himself later in "off-side" position. 
  Zeikidze announced that, instead of thirty, he could have 
brought the whole three thousand his supporters into the 
parliament on the day of intrusion, who, as he claimed, back up 
Eduard Shevardnadze. 
  "I was removed by the opposition who made Shevardnadze face 
a 
deadlock", said the former commander of city police, adding that 
he will yet utter a sensation. 
  Zeikidze informed he intends to establish his own party and 
engage the active political life.

<F P=106> [Report by Yuriy Kril: "Election of Three Members in the </F>
First Round Means Defeat for the Republican Party"] 
  [Text] Nine of 23 legislative seats are already occupied. 
The "New Wave" Association was the most successful. From now 
on, its five members -- I. Yukhnovskyy, V. Pynzennyk, I. 
Koliushko, and M. Kosiv -- will represent Lvov Oblast in the 
Supreme Council. The Ukrainian Republican Party, however, 
sustained a defeat in the first round of parliamentary elections 
-- none of its candidates won a legislative seat. Also defeated 
was its leader, M. Horyn, who lost to his former colleague S. 
Khmara. Mr. Horyn believes that the fact that only three 
"Republicans" qualified for the second-round election is a 
humiliating defeat for the party. In his words, other parties 
fared better "thanks to the destructive idea of fighting with 
Mafia, employed by Russia's Zhirinovskiy some time ago." 
  The slogan "Strength, Order, and Wealth," trotted out by the 
Ukrainian Popular Army-Ukrainian National Self-Defense during 
its campaign, failed to win much support among the electorate. 
Out of nine candidates proposed by the above organizations, 
only two will continue to fight in the second round. 
  In spite of an aggressive campaign, candidates from the 
so-called Ukrainian National Socialist Party (not registered 
officially, by the way), who ran in almost every electoral 
district, found themselves "off the board." Obviously, the 
electorate was a bit confused by their slightly extravagant 
uniform, including black shirts with swastikas. People could 
have also associated them with the "brown shirts..." 
  Among those who failed to garner a sufficient number of 
votes 
on the first try were L. Skoryk (23.4 percent) and I. Kalynets 
(18.7 percent). A. Holub, member of the Communist Party of 
Ukraine and "Pravda" correspondent, was the only journalist who 
made it to the second round. So far, the most successful Rukh 
members were L. Tanyuk and Ya. Kendzyor. Five more will have to 
brace up for the next round. Their rivals are primarily 
independent candidates and members of the Congress of Ukrainian 
Nationalists. 
  The highest turnout on 27 March was primarily reported from 
rural areas. However, both city and rural residents are anxious 
to know one thing: Will the new legislators justify the hefty 
funds that the state paid -- from taxpayers' pockets, naturally 
-- to stage the elections?

  [Text] Kiev, [no date as received] -- In an interview with 
a UNIAN correspondent on 1 April, Volodymyr Hrynyov, candidate 
for people's deputies at the Radyanskiy Constituency in Kharkov, 
chairman of the association "Nova Ukrayina" [New Ukraine], 
refuted the accusations by his contenders at the election -- 
Henrikh Altunyan and Valeriy Meshcheryakov -- of violating the 
election law of Ukraine. "The preponderance in the number of 
electors' votes in my favor and confident actions by my 
colleagues at the Interregional Bloc of Reforms irritated the 
contenders so much that they resorted to downright falsehoods," 
believes Volodymyr Hrynyov. He reported that on the [election] 
eve, foreseeing such actions, he submitted an appeal to the 
District Electoral Commission with a clear explanation of his 
actions in the election campaign within the framework of the 
law. "Now, when the Central Electoral Commission received an 
official telegram from Henrikh Altunyan with fictitious 
accusations, when Valeriy Meshcheryakov ostentatiously withdrew 
his candidacy `as a sign of protest,' I will be compelled to 
turn to the Central Electoral Commission with a request to 
protect me against the slander on the part of the former 
candidates." 
  As a UNIAN correspondent learned, Volodymyr Hrynyov was 
planning to visit the Central Electoral Commission on 1 April.

  [Text] In his interview with the agency Interfax-Ukraine 
Nikolay Mikhalchenko, leader of the Ukrainian president's 
domestic policy service, said that a corresponding decree of the 
republic determines the functions of the Ukrainian president's 
envoy in the Crimea and Valeriy Gorbatov who was recently 
appointed to this post is to be guided by this decree. In 
Mikhalchenko's words, Kravchuk's corresponding decree just fixes 
Gorbatov's appointment. 
  While explaining the functions of the Ukrainian president's 
envoy in the Crimea at the request of Interfax-Ukraine agency, 
leader of the presidential juridical service Ivan Timchenko said 
that "he (the envoy) will primarily fulfill control functions 
providing for the observance of the Ukrainian legislature and 
Ukraine's Constitution by the Crimean president." Timchenko 
added that the presidential envoy would maintain constant 
contacts between the central power bodies in Kiev and Simferopol. 
  Mikhalchenko explained that the question concerns the 
control 
over the decree On Division of Authorities between Ukraine and 
the Crimea both on the part of the Crimea and Ukraine. "This 
decree should be fulfilled both by the autonomy and the central 
government," underlined Mikhalchenko. 
  In his words, the presidential envoy in the Crimea will not 
be in charge for the Black Sea Fleet problem because this issue 
is to be considered at an inter-state level. "The leadership of 
the Crimean autonomy has only consultative functions in this 
sphere," emphasized Mikhalchenko.

  [Text] The new representative of the Ukrainian president in 
the Crimea Valeriy Gorbatov believes that "the mission of good 
will" and the work aimed "at prevention of any hearths of 
tension in our difficult time" are the main goals of his future 
activity. In his interview with the agency Interfax-Ukraine on 
Saturday he expressed hope that he would be able to help to the 
peoples of the Crimea and Ukraine "to become closer." 
  Valeriy Gorbatov, aged 39, was appointed to the post of the 
Ukrainian president's envoy in the Crimea on March 31. On March 
27 he was elected deputy of Ukraine's Supreme Soviet from the 
Crimea. Until that time he was head of the agricultural firm 
named after N. Krupskaya in the Crimea's Nizhegorsk region. 
  In Gorbatov's words, he intends to build his relations with 
the Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov "on friendly terms because 
we do the same thing." 
  "If he needs my experience and knowledge to implement the 
Crimea's economic policy I would not refuse from my 
participation," declared Gorbatov. At the same time he 
underlined that there are "enough clever and intelligent people" 
who are working in the Crimean government now.

  [Text] Simferopol March 31 TASS -- By supporting the Rossia 
Bloc's programme in the Crimean plebiscite, residents confirmed 
the outcome of the recent presidential elections in the 
peninsula, newly-elected president Yuriy Meshkov told today's 
news conference on the results of the people's vote and Crimean 
parliamentary polls. 
  According to official results, over one million Crimean 
residents came to the polls, of which 78 per cent spoke in 
favour of restoring the provision of the 1992 Crimean 
Constitution stipulating that relationship between the Crimean 
republic and Ukraine should be regulated on the basis of a 
treaty and an agreement. Nearly 83 per cent of those casting 
their ballots in the plebiscite backed the idea of dual 
citizenship. 
  When asked about his further steps, Meshkov said the point 
at 
issue was not Crimea's independence but its economic autonomy.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Efim Schwarzmann] </F>
  [Text] Simferopol April 2 TASS -- The Ukrainian president's 
decree on setting up his office in the Crimea was received with 
discontent in the Crimea. Sources among the presidential staff 
members told ITAR-TASS today that Leonid Kravchuk's decision was 
at variance with the Ukrainian law on the division of powers 
between the bodies of state authorities of Ukraine and the 
Crimean republic, which contains no provision for the setting up 
of a Ukrainian presidential office in the Crimea. 
  According to the same sources, the decree violates a clause 
of Article 14 of the same law, under which Ukraine acts as a 
guarantor of the legal status of the Crimean republic. 
  The decree setting up a Ukrainian presidential office in the 
Crimea met with a negative reaction also in the Council of 
Ministers of the Crimea and in the Presidium of the republic's 
Supreme Soviet (parliament), according to the presidential 
staffer, Vladimir Demin. 
  Demin also said that the Chairman of the Crimean Supreme 
Soviet, Nikolay Bagrov sent a proposal to the Ukrainian 
president for suspending his decree. The Crimean president's 
staff members said the enforcement of the decree would lead to 
destabilisation of the political situation in the Crimea because 
it contradicts the agreement on mutual respectful relations 
between Simferopol and Kiev. 
  Reliable sources told ITAR-TASS that the Crimean leadership 
is planning to make their viewpoint on the Ukrainian president's 
intention to set up an office in the Crimea in a message 
addressed to the presidents of the Russian Federation and the 
United States of America, as guarantors of stability in the 
Crimea, and to the participants in the trilateral Moscow accords 
signed in January during President Bill Clinton's visit to 
Moscow.

  [Text] Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk cancelled the 
resolution of Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov on military 
service of conscripts -- citizens of the Crimea dated March 15. 
  Kravchuk's decree made public on Saturday said that 
Meshkov's 
order contradicts to Ukraine's Constitution and to the decrees 
on the division of authorities between the state power bodies of 
Ukraine and Crimea, on Ukraine's defense and military service. 
  The document points out that "the determination of the arms 
of the service stationed on the republic's territory, training 
and distribution of military personnel "is the competence of 
Ukraine's Armed Forces." 
  The same day Kravchuk appointed Nikolay Hlushko his envoy in 
Sevastopol, having released him from the post of the first 
deputy head of the Sevastopol city administration. 
  Some time earlier Kravchuk submitted Hlushko's candidacy to 
the city council's session for consideration, however, half of 
the permanent commissions of the Sevastopol city council was 
against his appointment.

  [Text] Gradual demilitarization would be the best 
arrangement for the Crimea, the republic's President Yuriy 
Meshkov said at a news conference in Simferopol. He was against 
the situation where, as he puts it, the defense units of two 
countries are stationed on its soil. 
  Meshkov said that he did not press for the independence of 
Crimea. He explained that he wanted the Crimean republic to be 
autonomous in resolving economic issues. 
  According to the president, 1,081,000 out of the 1,087,000 
eligible voters responded to the March 27 poll. Treaty 
relations between the Crimea and Ukraine were supported by 78.4 
percent, dual Crimean-Russian and Crimean-Ukrainian citizenship 
by 82.8 percent, and making the Crimean president's decrees 
binding on issues not yet covered by the Crimean legislation, by 
77.9 percent. 
  Meshkov said that the elections of the Crimean parliament 
"bore out the results of the presidential elections and showed 
that the Crimean population supported the platform of the Russia 
bloc." He described as clumsy the allegations of certain 
politicians that ethnic Russians alone had voted in the 
elections.

  [Text] The Crimean president's military advisor Valeriy 
Kuznetsov believes that it is inexpedient for Ukraine to keep 
such numerous armed forces in Crimea. He told Interfax that 
Ukraine had a 50,000-strong contingent of land troops in Crimea. 
  "Crimea is overly stuffed with land forces," he said. "Given 
this, only the Russian Black Sea Fleet should stay to protect 
Crimea, Ukraine and Russia," he said. He is convinced that 
"Russia is strong enough to maintain a modern, reliable and 
combat-ready Black Sea Fleet." 
  Kuznetsov emphasized that the Crimean leaders were not 
planning to create military formations of their own, because 
they were simply redundant. "Besides that, we simply cannot 
afford them," he said. 
  "There are official bodies, such as the Crimean security 
service and interior ministry, which will maintain order and 
combat crime," said Kuznetsov.

  [Text] Kiev, 1 Apr -- President of Crimea Yuriy Meshkov 
dismissed Valeriy Astakhov, the president of the Krym Television 
and Radio Company, on 31 March, although, according to the 
Crimean Council of Ministers regulation on the Krym State 
Television and Radio Company, approved at the instruction of the 
autonomous republic's Supreme Council, "a candidate for the post 
of president is nominated by the Council of Ministers and 
confirmed by the Supreme Council of Crimea, with the consent of 
the Ukrainian Television and Radio Company [Ukrteleradio], for a 
period of five years." 
  In this connection, Mykola Okhmakevych, the president of the 
Ukrainian Television and Radio Company, filed a resolute protest 
to Yuriy Meshkov. The Krym Television and Radio Company, 
stresses Mr. Okhmakevych in his statement, is a constituent part 
of the Ukrainian Television and Radio Company. According to the 
currently valid resolutions of Ukraine's Council of Ministers, 
Ukraine's Supreme Council and the Council of Ministers of the 
Republic of Crimea, decision-making on personnel issues without 
the involvement of the Ukrteleradio president is a gross 
violation. Mr. Okhmakevych suggested Yuriy Meshkov revise his 
decision.

  [Text] Valeriy Astakhov, the president of the Krym 
Television and Radio Company, has circulated a statement 
entitled: Crimean President's April Fool Joke. It says, in 
particular: 
  On 1 April this year, Mr. Hryshankov, the head of the 
Crimean 
president's administration, familiarized me with Mr. Meshkov's 
decree relieving me of my duties as the president of the Krym TV 
and Radio Company, and the decree appointing another person to 
this post. The reasons for my dismissal are not substantiated, 
while the content of the decree, from the first sentence to the 
last, runs counter to the Constitution of the Republic of 
Crimea, and the current laws of Ukraine and Crimea. The decree 
is unlawful for a number of reasons. 
  Firstly, according to the provision on the Krym State 
Television and Radio Company, its president is appointed by the 
Supreme Council of Crimea for a period of five years, following 
the nomination of a candidate agreed with the Ukrainian 
Television and Radio Company and the Crimean Council of 
Ministers. 
  Secondly, at the time when the decree was signed and until 
today, I remain a people's deputy of the republic's Supreme 
Council, which is still in office, since the new Supreme Council 
of Crimea has not been elected yet. Yuriy Meshkov's decree has 
been contested by Mykola Okhamkevych, the president of the 
Ukrainian Television and Radio Company. 
  Therefore, Valeriy Astakhov stresses, I regard the decrees 
by 
the president of the Republic of Crimea as unlawful and refuse 
to comply with them.

<F P=106> [By UKRINFORM correspondent Lev Ryabchikov for TASS] </F>
  [Text] Simferopol April 1 TASS -- Bread prices have gone up 
by 2.5 times in the Crimea, many enterprises are idle as they 
have supported the lock-out announced by the Crimean Union of 
Businessmen to the Crimean parliament due to its unwillingness 
to lower production taxes. 
  "The Crimea duplicates the situation that has been 
characteristic of Ukraine for several years. The Ukrainian 
leadership fears unpopular reforms," Crimean Vice-Premier 
Yevgeniy Saburov told a news conference here today. 
  "The Crimean Supreme Soviet had kept the bread prices low 
for 
a long time on political reasons. The prices are no longer 
real, and their support has been stopped. Thus, prices went up 
on April 1," he said. 
  In the opinion of Saburov, food prices should not be curbed 
down but they should not jump either. 
  The bread price increase may influence the results of the 
second round of parliamentary elections, and the government 
hopes to ease the situation with reduced taxes on enterprises 
and business structures and improved banking activities and 
currency regulation. These measures have been coordinated with 
the Ukrainian president and do not run counter to the 
legislation, said the vice-premier. 
  Decrees to the effect have been prepared to be signed by 
President Yuriy Meshkov upon his return from Cyprus, where he 
left today. 
  Bearing in mind Saburov's statements, Chairman of the 
Crimean 
Union of Businessmen Aleksandr Dudko told the news conference 
the union will suspend the lock-put for two-weeks in order to 
enable the government to settle the taxation issue.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The Jobless Cyclotron"] </F>
  [Text] The Kiev Nuclear Research Institute at the 
Ukrainian Academy of Sciences is experiencing difficult times, 
as with all science. Our country's only cyclotron, which cost 
us 15 billion karbovantsi, has remained idle for six months. 
There is not enough money for the energy and heating that it 
requires. Just as there is no money at the Academy of Sciences, 
the government is also in no hurry to help the scientists. The 
Institute's financing from the budget is only 40 percent.... 
  As a result, there is not enough money to conduct basic 
studies. It is as though they have become unnecessary. 
Specialists, who even now are not so numerous, are looking for 
other jobs. For example, in Russia, where salaries are higher 
and where there are possibilities for advancement. However, 
perhaps the worst thing about this is that young people are 
leaving the Institute -- commercial structures lure them away. 
In the course of time, Ukraine may find itself without nuclear 
specialists. At the same time, we have 15 nuclear power 
stations, and, by the year 2000, it is envisaged to have at 
least another five units commissioned.

the decisive role in the drama. 
  [Grachev] We have not forgotten those terrible events,

the Army at the time was simply obliged to act decisively and 
show unity and understanding. To this day the military feel and 
sense what happened, possibly more so than anyone else. 
  The sad thing is that the Army had to clean up the mess, 
figuratively speaking, created by political confrontation. 
  Once again, I want to repeat that the Armed Forces at that 
time prevented a civil war. I want to make it clear that the 
Army want to see the maximum amount of accord in society. 
  At the moment, accord is simply essential. Without accord 
there cannot be any reform, not political, economic, or cultural.

  [Text] A tense psychological atmosphere is being stirred up 
around the Russian Army. Attempts are being made to portray it 
as a crushing force, Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev said 
Friday addressing cultural workers. 
  Speaking about the developments in Moscow in October 1993, 
Grachev said that the military would never forget what happened 
then. 
  He said that the military still feels bitterness because it 
was forced to help solve the problems created by political 
confrontation. He said that in the autumn of 1993 the army 
"came to Moscow on the second day of the civil war in Russia." 
  Attitudes may be different to what happened but everyone 
should remember that servicemen bear a special responsibility 
and no-one has the right to split the army for political 
reasons, said Grachev. 
  He said that the well-known thesis "the army is outside 
politics" should not be understood literally as some people are 
trying to present. The minister said that the military, like 
all citizens, cannot be indifferent to the political processes 
going on in society. 
  The army does not serve parties or individual politicians, 
the army serves society, the country, said Grachev. He said 
that now some political forces are trying to take advantage of 
the tense social situation: the media are spreading all sorts of 
rumors aimed at discrediting the leadership of the country and 
the army. 
  Grachev believes that the campaigners want to split the 
people and make them nervous. He said that the army and navy 
command is showing self-control. 
  "I recently held a meeting of commanders of military 
districts and fleets and they said that no one will be able to 
split the army," said Grachev. He said that the army wants 
stability and further changes in society.

  [Text] Moscow April 3 TASS -- Parties and movements of the 
opposition held a meeting and a mourning ceremony in Moscow on 
Sunday in remembrance of those killed during tragic events in 
Moscow in October, 1993. The column of thousands of mourners 
who marched along the Krasnaya Presnya to the Russian White 
House was led by relatives of those killed six months ago. 
  The mourning ceremony continued for about half an hour. 
Before the ceremony began, photographs of the victims of the 
October 1993 tragedy in Moscow were placed on a wall of the 
Krasnaya Presnya stadium. Addressing all those present, 
speakers called for reconciliation in society. 
  Participants in the remembrance ceremony adopted an address 
to the people and authorities, pointing out, in particular, the 
futility of attempts to resolve political problems in Russia by 
means of force. Participants demanded that October 4 be 
proclaimed a day of national mourning and that the parliamentary 
commission for the investigation into the circumstances of the 
October 1993 developments resume its work. 
  Upon completion of the meeting, a religious service in 
remembrance of those killed was held.

  [Text] On Sunday [3 April], after he laid wreaths to a 
makeshift monument to the victims of the October uprising, 
Russia's former Vice-President Aleksandr Rutskoy said that 
instead of being seen as a tragedy of the dissolved Supreme 
Soviet, the uprising was to be seen as a national tragedy. 
According to government counts, 142 human lives were lost in 
the October developments. 
  The leader of Russia's National Salvation Front Iliya 
Konstantinov, a member of the Constitutional Court Valeriy 
Zorkin, the chairman of the Popular party off Free Russia 
Vasiliy Lipitskiy, a member of the State Duma Stanislav 
Govorukhin, members of the dissolved Supreme Soviet Oleg 
Rumiantsev and Gennadiy Sayenko as well as other opposition 
leaders who defended the building of the Russian House of 
Soviets on October 3 and 4, took part in the memorial ceremony 
in front of that building. 
  In Rutskoy's view, more people failed to come to their aid 
in 
October because truthful reports on what was happening were not 
available. Rutskoy said those who defended the national 
parliament were no communo-fascists. Instead, those who opened 
fire on the parliament were fascists. Rutskoy dubbed as 
shameless what Defense Minister Pavel Grachev said in a 
Saturday's appearance on national television. According to 
Grachev, the armed forces were sent in last October to cut a way 
through political debris. 
  The ex-vice-president stood for a long time with a bowed 
head 
and in silence at the monument which was designed as a wooden 
cross with hanging funeral bands and loops of barbed wire. 
Barbed wire entanglements surrounded the building of the 
Russian parliament in October. Asked by journalists what he 
felt at the moment, Rutskoy said "Ask Yeltsin". 
  National Salvation Front leader Iliya Konstantinov told a 
reporter for Interfax he intended to concentrate on 
organizational and analytical efforts. As well as Rutskoy, 
Konstantinov was arrested in the wake of the October uprising 
and released from the Lefortovo investigation cells on the 
Duma's amnesty decision. 
  He said that today the opposition must concentrate on 
preparations for the next elections to the Federal Assembly and, 
especially, presidential elections. He refused to name the 
opposition's choices by saying time would show that. President 
Yeltsin banned both the National Salvation Front and the Working 
Russia movement led by Viktor Anpilov from taking part in the 
parliamentary elections of last December owing to their role in 
the October developments.

  [Text] Moscow April 2 TASS -- The 5th congress of the 
Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR), which opened here on 
Saturday [2 April], has vested party leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky 
with virtually dictatorial intra-party powers. 
  At the leader's request, the delegates unanimously voted for 
an extension of his powers at this post "until April 2, 2004". 
  The delegates also adopted amendments to the party rules. 
  According to the amendments, from now on LDPR congresses are 
to be held once in three years, not annually. They will elect 
only a chairman enabling him to appoint a supreme council of the 
party and other leading bodies, change their composition at any 
moment at his own discretion. [sentence as received] 
  For the interim between congresses, all their powers are 
automatically transferred to the LDPR leader. 
  The delegates also reaffirmed that in the event of a 
presidential election in Russia, Zhirinovsky still remains the 
party's candidate for the presidency. 
  The congress also adopted a resolution on the founding of a 
party television and radio network "Sokol Zhirinovskogo" 
[Zhirinovskiy's Falcon] which is called upon to disseminate "the 
truth about the party" under conditions of a "total news 
blackout".

  [Text] Deputy Chairman of the State Duma Aleksandr 
Vengerovskiy, one of the leaders of the Liberal Democratic Party 
of Russia, declared to INTERFAX that the resolution of the 
Congress on a substantial expansion of the LDPR Chairman 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's authorities would assist in 
consolidation of the party. 
  "We have just conducted cleansing of the party from 
temporary 
people who entered the party to satisfy their private 
ambitions," he noted. 
  Vengerovskiy called assertions stating that the LDPR turns 
into the party of one man as groundless. In his opinion, it is 
necessary to strengthen the role of the party's chairman 
"because the party is on the way to power." To this effect the 
authorities granted to Zhirinovskiy are not excessive ones 
because under the present situation in Russia they are necessary 
for the party's survival, said Vengerovskiy. 
  Vengerovskiy who has just returned from a trip throughout 
the 
former Yugoslavia declared that the present policy of the 
Russian Foreign Ministry does not meet interests of the country. 
"We commit a betrayal with respect to the fraternal Serbian 
people who are experiencing different forms of genocide," said 
he. 
  In his opinion, western special services and those who would 
like to make the Balkans the zone of their century long 
influence are waging the war on the territory of the former 
Yugoslavia. He said that "the most terrible fact is that Russia 
supports the sanctions against the Serbs." Vengerovskiy 
believes that Moscow should strictly occupy the positions of the 
Serbs and recognize the republic of Serb Krajina. 
  Vengerovsky qualifies Russia's joining NATO's Partnership 
for 
Peace program as "a national betrayal of the country."

  [Text] The 5th Congress of the Liberal Democratic Party of 
Russia [LDPR] which was opened on April 2 in Moscow approved 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's proposal to prolong his authorities as 
the party's chairman up to 2004. The delegates also equalled 
the chairman's authorities with the authorities of the Congress, 
reports our Interfax correspondent. 
  In accordance with the changes introduced into the party's 
charter at the Congress, within the next decade till 2004 
Zhirinovskiy himself forms the LDPR supreme council and can 
introduce his personal changes any time he wants. The party's 
chairman also appoints leaderships of its regional organizations. 
  While addressing the Congress, Zhirinovskiy criticized the 
policy of Russia's present government and noted that "the longer 
they stay at power the more votes the LDPR will receive." 
Simultaneously he declared that in case of a radical change in 
the political course of the present administration the party 
could render support to President Boris Yeltsin in the interests 
of Russia. 
  In his words, the CIS has no legal basis and has no future. 
The Liberal Democratic Party of Russia advocates restoration of 
the single Russian state within the borders of the USSR of 1977. 
  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy also asserted that at present all 
largest special services of the world started to struggle 
against the Liberal Democratic Party trying to break its 
leadership in order not to let it come to power in Russia. 
  Zhirinovskiy declared that President Boris Yeltsin should 
refuse from the services of his advisers who had organized his 
meeting with Yegor Gaydar, leader of the party Russia's Choice 
which does not exist yet. "Mr Gaydar should be in a prison but 
not in the Kremlin because he is guilty of the fact that the 
majority of the Russian population is living in poverty for the 
third year already," declared Zhirinovskiy. 
  The Congress also passed a decision to create a TV company 
of 
the Liberal Democratic Party. 
  According to representatives of the LDPR, as many as 343 
delegates from 69 regional organizations and delegations of 14 
foreign parties are present at the Congress. Representatives of 
the party Serbian National Revival, Serbian Radical Party, 
National Front of France, Polish National Front, and German 
Popular Union are among them. 
  A slogan Liberal Democratic Party of Russia on the Way to 
Power is hanging on the scene of the cinema hall of the Central 
House of Tourists where the Congress is being held.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 2 Apr -- The fifth congress of the Liberal 
Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR], which opened in Moscow today, 
has granted practically dictatorial internal party powers to its 
chairman, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. At the leader's request, the 
delegates unanimously voted to extend his powers in that post 
(without reelection) "until 2 April 2004." They also adopted a 
number of amendments to the rules, under which the LDPR chairman 
has the opportunity to appoint personally the party's Supreme 
Council and other leading bodies, and to change their 
composition at any moment he sees fit. The delegates also 
confirmed that Vladimir Zhirinovskiy will remain the party's 
candidate in the event of presidential elections being held in 
Russia. 
  The fifth congress of the LDPR also adopted a resolution on 
setting up the party's "Zhirinovskiy's Falcon" [Sokol 
Zhirinovskogo] Television and Radio Company which is to 
disseminate "the truth about the party" in conditions of "a 
complete information blockade." 
  Asking the congress deputies to grant him additional powers, 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy said that this was out of financial 
considerations and "intrigues by the special services" that are 
doing everything to destroy the party. 
  On the whole, the theme of Russian and foreign special 
services ran throughout the entire one and a half hour speech by 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. According to him these "special 
services" offered him 100 million dollars to "leave politics." 
The LDPR leader is inclined to attribute their efforts to the 
behavior of a number of recent comrades-in-arms and members of 
the LDPR faction in the State Duma who recently announced their 
decision to leave the faction. As is known, several party 
members recently announced their differences with Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy. Viktor Kobelev, until recently head of the party 
apparatus, was among such representatives of the LDPR. Judging 
from Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's speech and by the decisions adopted 
by the congress, it has been decided to put an end once and for 
all to the internal party rebellion. Henceforth, to use the 
words of the LDPR leader, "the rebels will not be able to carry 
out hostile activities by playing their card of election by the 
congress." 
  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, as always, did not mince his words. 
He said that the LDPR's immediate task is to become the ruling 
party, to form a single-party government, and to occupy the post 
of head of state. "The political system of Russia will soon 
receive first aid in the form of the LDPR," he told those 
assembled. "The LDPR's slogan is 'The LDPR on the path to 
power' and we will implement it without fail," he added. "The 
mighty vessel of the LDPR has set sail on the expanses of the 
oceans and all unseaworthy tubs have been left behind," is how 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy described the situation on the threshold 
of the future presidential elections. 
  The LDPR leader unambiguously defined the position of his 
party toward the authorities. "We are the main party in 
opposition to the existing regime," he stated. The government, 
in his opinion, "is incapable of doing anything" and the longer 
it remains in power "the more votes we will receive in all the 
subsequent elections," he stated. The LDPR leader advised the 
president "to give up his advisers and crew who are always 
putting him in an awkward situation." 
  National and state problems occupied quite a big place in 
the 
party leader's speech. As usual, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy 
expressed the readiness "to defend the interests of Russians on 
the territory of the former USSR." He prudently refrained from 
rash statements on "pushes to the south" this time, stating that 
coming to power, the LDPR would act only legally. Nevertheless, 
"the frontiers of the USSR as of 1975, recognized by the world 
community, will be restored and Russian flags will fly over the 
cities of Kazakhstan, Central Asia, and the Transcaucasus, etc," 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy stated. Everybody has a hobby and the LDPR 
leader's, to use his words, "only vice is a weakness for 
frontier posts: For them being in place." "If some unclean 
force" has moved them inside the Russian state, the task of 
Zhirinovskiy's party is to return them to their place, but 
within the framework of the law, he added. 
  Dwelling on the party's financial problems, Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy said that the pre-election campaign on the eve of 
last year's parliamentary elections cost the LDPR 250 million 
rubles and the party had just paid its debts, and in the four 
years of its existence, the party has spent 1 billion rubles at 
current prices. 
  At the congress, besides delegates, there are quite a few 
people from abroad who share Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's views -- 
mainly representatives of various Serb organizations, and also 
of Iraq's ruling Ba'th party, the German People's Union, and 
others.

  [Text] Moscow April 2 ITAR-TASS -- The congress of the 
Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR] today adopted 
resolution on the "impermissibility of use of any forcible 
measures with regard to the republics of the former Yugoslavia". 
  The Zhirinovskiy party declared its intention "to render 
assistance to the peoples of Yugoslavia, and first of all to the 
Serbian people". 
  The LDPR group in the State Duma was instructed to work 
towards the lifting of economic sanctions against the Yugoslav 
republics. 
  Another resolution contains criticism of the "inconsistent, 
passive approach of the Russian ruling circles to Iraq". The 
party's deputies in the parliament were told to "raise the 
question about lifting sanctions against Iraq and secure changes 
in the policy pursued by the Russian diplomacy, including in the 
United Nations". 
  The congress adopted a resolution in support of a single 
monetary system of Russia and Byelorussia [Belarus]. The LDPR 
thinks that "the cost Russia may have to pay is incomparably 
smaller than the strategic benefits from a financial and 
economic alliance with Byelorussia".

  [Text] Moscow April 4 ITAR-TASS -- The archival documents 
containing records indicating that the father of Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy, the leader of the Liberal-Democratic Party of 
Russia, was a Jew, "were fabricated by the special services of 
Kazakhstan, probably on personal instructions from Nursultan 
Nazarbayev". This was announced by LDPR press secretary 
Grigoriy Serebrennikov in response to ITAR-TASS request to 
comment on the report of the ASSOCIATED PRESS news agency. 
  According to AP, Zhirinovskiy appealed to the Alma city 
executive committee for a change of his original surname of 
Eidelstein and was permitted to assume his present surname in 
June of 1964. 
  "Vladimir Volfovich's enemies cannot rest in peace. This 
time they launched a lie about Zhirinovskiy's bearing the 
surname of Eidelstein until the age of eighteen, and that, 
consequently, he is a half-Jew. As evidence, an archival record 
is cited, which must have been concocted by the special services 
of Kazakhstan, maybe on personal instructions from Nazarbayev 
who recently did not allow Zhirinovskiy to come to Almaty to 
attend the burial of his aunt," Serebrennikov said. 
  Any person who is versed in Russian law in the least knows 
that first of all, to change one's name one must submit a 
request in writing. No one has a copy of such a request 
because they do not know whose handwriting to forge, 
Serebrennikov said. Secondly, every Soviet citizen is obliged 
to receive a Soviet passport at the age of 16. Consequently, if 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy changed his surname after graduating from 
school, when was eighteen, he was obliged to get a new passport. 
No archival records of a new passport have been found 
anywhere," he stressed. 
  "In the circulated Xerox copies of a record in the register 
of civil status in Almaty there are many discrepancies. For 
instance, a wrong address is indicated. And in the so-called 
archival reference, the year of birth is wrong". 
  The press secretary of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy said the main 
evidence of the falseness of the document was the fact that 
"three days before the alleged change of name, Zhirinovskiy 
arrived in Moscow to enter a higher school."

  [Text] Russian President Boris Yeltsin gave his backing to 
the establishment of a pro-presidential party during his meeting 
with Russia's Choice leader Yegor Gaydar in the Kremlin on 
Friday. However, Yeltsin does not intend to become a member, 
Gaydar told journalists after the meeting. 
  Gaydar stressed that the new party Russia's Choice would not 
be a party of high officials led by the president. "Boris 
Yeltsin believes that no narrow party of the his supporters must 
be established and that is why he is not going to head it or to 
be a formal member," Gaydar said. 
  Gaydar considered the firm agreement that there would be no 
other presidential party other than Russia's Choice to be the 
most important result of the meeting. "We will coordinate our 
organizational activities with the president. This is necessary 
since there is much misunderstanding between supporters of 
democracy due to different initiatives on the structuring of the 
democratic movement," Gaydar pointed out. 
  Commenting on the correlation between the establishment of 
the president's party and the memorandum on accord, Gaydar said 
the significance of the agreement on civil accord was that the 
document speaks of the unacceptability of violence and tension 
in the society. However, Gaydar stressed that the head of state 
as a politician was not a "sterile being raised in a tube with 
no past or political supporters, no own views or program." He 
must have political allies. 
  Gaydar announced that the Russia's Choice faction would meet 
Yeltsin on Monday. The meeting is to discuss the situation in 
many Russian regions and the threat of administrative 
countermeasures. "We will also discuss issues concerning the 
memorandum on accord and the efficiency of the democratic 
forces' activities in the State Duma," Gaydar added. 
  The Russian president's Press Secretary, Vyacheslav 
Kostikov, 
stated after the meeting that Yeltsin and Gaydar had much in 
common, especially in the fields of economic reform and renewal 
in Russia. However, he stressed that despite this the Russia's 
Choice Party would be independent of the president. They will 
closely cooperate, Kostikov suggested. 
  Kostikov said the coming meeting between the president and 
the Russia's Choice faction was the first one opening a series 
of meetings between the president and representatives of 
different blocs and parties. It was not by chance that the 
first meeting would be held with Russia's Choice. This shows 
that the president's political orientation remains the same, 
said Kostikov.

<F P=106> [Article by Vyacheslav Kostikov, Russian president's press </F>
secretary, under "Politics" rubric: "`Preserving Existing 
Elements of Civil Peace Is Main Aim of Agreement of Political 
Forces,' Russian Presidential Press Secretary Vyacheslav 
Kostikov Believes"] 
  [Text] "Preserving the existing elements of civil peace is 
the main aim of the Agreement of Political Forces," Vyacheslav 
Kostikov, the Russian president's press secretary, believes. It 
is that task which is the main aim behind the draft document "On 
Securing Civil Accord" which Russian President Boris Yeltsin 
gave to State Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin last Thursday. 
Federation Council Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko also received a 
copy of the draft, so all Federal Assembly deputies will be 
familiarized with it. The document is seven-and-a-half pages 
long. It contains sections on the economic, political, 
spiritual, moral, and cultural life of society, on nationalities 
and regional policy, and, lastly, on the terms for the 
fulfillment of the agreement and on the sides' liability for the 
violation of these terms. It would evidently be inadvisable and 
even harmful to envisage tough punitive measures. There is no 
prosecutorial tone in the draft. It is proposed to set up 
conciliation commissions to deal with contentious issues; these 
are to operate openly and submit their opinions and, if 
necessary, their censure of anyone's actions to public verdict. 
It is still hard to talk about a firm date for the signing of 
the agreement. The president would like to start the signing 
procedure in late April and has set a provisional date of 28 
April. With a whole series of provisos he has also set the 
number of possible signatures at around 25, so that more and 
more political forces can subscribe to the agreement as they 
"mature." 
  People who think that Boris Yeltsin's political temperament 
is exhausted are mistaken. That note was struck in the 
assumption that he will only take part in the 1996 presidential 
elections as a voter. The president will not leave the helm 
unless he is sure he is giving it into safe hands. It cannot be 
ruled out that a sufficiently large proportion of the population 
will ask Yeltsin to run. Needless to say it will be the 
president himself who will make the decision, but in the 
meantime I would not be as hasty as some of our media in tossing 
this subject into our heated political life. This will only 
agitate society. A moratorium on political passions would be 
more useful. The agreement must play that role.

  [Text] An agreement on civil peace should be acceptable to 
both sides, and should not contain three or four unacceptable 
conditions, the leader of the Russian Communist Party, Duma 
deputy, Gennadiy Zyuganov, told reporters on Friday. 
  He said that he had not read the text of the agreement 
submitted earlier to the State Duma. Yet he was against 
proposals not to introduce changes in the Constitution and not 
to hold elections. 
  Speaking about the movement known as Accord for Russia, 
Zyuganov said that the movement's leaders meet every week 
coordinating a common platform and main demands for protecting 
the country from a civil war and for warding off territorial and 
social-economic disintegration. Along with the member of the 
Constitutional Court Valeriy Zorkin, the former vice president 
Aleksandr Rutskoy and chairman of the Agrarian Party Mikhail 
Lapshin, he signed the movement's founding declaration. 
  He said that in late-April to early-May a Accord for Russia 
movement congress is planned which will determine its character 
and "attitude to all power structures." Zyuganov said that 
regular contacts are being maintained with Aleksandr Rutskoy. 
Contacts are established with leaders of the 
military-industrial complex, directors of large enterprises and 
leaders of other political movements. 
  Speaking about the current situation in Russia, Zyuganov 
said 
that "the Kremlin poses the main danger," currently and that 
"the only thing left for a hungry man to do is to steal or 
rebel." 
  Answering the question about the changes in the program of 
the Russian Communist Party, Zyuganov talked about the rejection 
of revolutionary leaps and forceful methods for solving acute 
problems, as well as the recognition of the fact that state 
ownership as the main system is inadmissible, and that the 
multi-structured economy is a reality.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow April 1 TASS -- Leader of the Russian 
Communist Party Gennadiy Zyuganov has admitted that his party 
had renounced several important postulates of Marxism-Leninism. 
  Replying to an ITAR-TASS question during a press conference 
in the State Duma here today, he said that in their future 
programme, entitled "From Crisis to Stable Development," which 
is now being discussed, the Russian Communists renounce all 
"revolutionary leaps and forcible methods for settling 
problems," and also the exclusiveness of state-owned property. 
  "We believe that domination of only state-owned property had 
produced stagnation and paralysis," Zyuganov said, noting that 
the theses of the Russian Communist Party recognise multiple 
forms of economy as a reality. The communist leader mentioned 
"popular state patriotism" and social fairness among the bedrock 
principles of his party. 
  Asked about the work that is now being done by masterminds 
of 
the "Concord for the Sake of Russia" movement, Zyuganov said 
that they were daily holding consultations and have already met 
many scientists, heads of major enterprises of the 
military-industrial complex, and leaders of many parties. He 
did not rule out the possibility of the movement's constituent 
congress being held already this may. Zyuganov said that the 
organisational group maintained regular contact with Aleksandr 
Rutskoy and representatives of his party, was actively working 
on the movement's programme. 
  The communist leader spoke much more cooly about the 
memorandum on civil peace and concord, which is now being drawn 
up. Zyuganov said that the Communist Party on the whole backed 
the idea of achieving civil concord in the Russian society, but 
said he doubted that the given draft (about which he could judge 
only from press reports) would contribute to this end. The 
movement towards this goal, according to Zyuganov, should 
proceed "from both sides." If the drawn up draft memorandum 
really stipulates that the Constitution "should not be touched," 
the Russian Communist Party will hardly be able to sign such a 
document, Zyuganov stated.

  [Text] Gennadiy Zyuganov, the leader of the Russian 
Communist Party, held a news conference on 1 April. He is also 
the initiator of the Accord for Russia movement. Over to our 
correspondent Yevgeniy Zherebenkov. 
  [Zherebenkov] The Accord for Russia movement is actively 
engaged in setting up organizations in the localities and is 
preparing to hold a congress, Gennadiy Zyuganov announced, 
adding that Aleksandr Rutskoy is taking part in constant 
consultations with the movement's leaders. Zyuganov said: 
  [Zyuganov] "The leaders of the movement have a weekly 
meeting. The general philosophical principles upon which such 
accord may be reached have been drawn up. Consultations have 
been conducted with all government structures, we are trying to 
find mutual understanding and are formulating our basic demands 
that will bring the country out of civil conflict and war, and 
will halt any further territorial, social, and economic 
collapse. We have held meetings with all those who determine 
the foundations of the genetic development of the nation; with 
representatives of fundamental science and academic science, 
with representatives of the military industrial complex and 
heads of major enterprises, and with leaders of other movements, 
parties, and associations. Many of our representatives, 
including deputies, have gone out to the localities, where they 
are briefing people on the essentials of the movement and 
tackling organizational work. I will not rule out that there 
will be a congress or assembly in May, which will finally work 
out the manifesto and nature of the movement's activities, and 
will define its attitude to all administrative structures, 
including government structures." 
  [Zherebenkov] Speaking about the new party in opposition to 
the Communists which Yegor Gaydar has set up, with the symbolic 
name of Russia's Choice, Gennadiy Zyuganov said the following: 
  [Zyuganov] "From a purely personal viewpoint, I want to tell 
you that the more politicians of Gaydar's type that manage 
various parties, the better for us." 
  [Zherebenkov] As for another opponent, Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy, 
Gennadiy Zyuganov's position in regard to him is like this: 
  [Zyuganov] "He actually exists, he has his own program and 
policy. I repeat for all to hear: Today I will work together 
with anybody, no matter whom, for whom the integrity of the 
country and belief in our state and the welfare of every citizen 
is the highest value." 
  [Zherebenkov] All that is splendid, of course, but Gennadiy 
Zyuganov's desire to work together with anybody, no matter whom, 
puts one on one's guard.

  [Text] Leader of the Liberal-Democratic Party Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy stated in Moscow during the opening of the World 
Congress of Slavic Orthodox and Christian Peoples that a union 
of Eastern European Slavic states might make the 21st century an 
age of Slavic civilization. 
  He said that Western Europe had always feared the 
unification 
of Eastern European Slavic states and made efforts to prevent 
them from creating a union. "The time has come to stop taking 
instructions from Paris and London," he said. 
  He believes that the Balkan war was the catalyst of the idea 
of a Slavic union and that Russia must form up a 
military-political alliance in Eastern Europe. 
  "If the Russian troops come to the Balkans, they will never 
tolerate humiliation of the Slavic peoples. We shall send as 
many divisions to the Balkans as our Slavic brothers will ask," 
he said. 
  He emphasized at the same time, that Slavs would never 
become 
aggressors. 
  Leader of the Russian National Congress Aleksandr Sterligov 
said that the economic crisis in Russia was evolving into a 
catastrophe. This can be judged, he continued, from the 
unprecedented industrial recession and from the incompetence and 
inefficiency of the authorities. 
  Sterligov demanded that the events in Moscow last October be 
investigated and that their actual organizers not be allowed to 
evade punishment. 
  He said that the democrats were preparing for a civil war 
and 
were forming up armed units. 
  He urged the opposition to do everything they can to prevent 
Russian-American military exercises in the Urals. 
  In his opinion, the U.S. wanted to obtain information about 
the Russian army's combat capability so as to become better 
prepared from the occupation of Russia. 
  He said that public committees should be set up to organize 
actions of protest against Russian-American military exercises. 
  The World Congress of Slavic Orthodox and Christian Peoples 
is being held on the initiative of the Liberal-Democratic Party 
which claims that the event is being attended by delegations 
from Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Serbia, Bulgaria, 
Ukraine and Belarus.

  [Text] On Saturday the Working Moscow movement declared 
that President Yeltsin's proposals for accord and civic peace 
were a propagandistic piece of demagoguery and that the 
president made a new attempt to disorient the people. 
  The statement by the Working Moscow was delivered to 
Interfax. It says civic peace will be unattainable in Russia 
without the restoration of Soviet power. 
  The Working Moscow was willing to join efforts to draw up an 
agreement for civic peace but different classes and social 
groups could reach accord only if they obeyed the provisions of 
constitutional law. 
  In the Working Moscow's view, what Yeltsin said contradicted 
his own constitution. 
  The Working Moscow quotes several provisions of 
constitutional law violated by Yeltsin. First and foremost, 
Yeltsin violated the national constitution last fall by signing 
Decree 1400 which did away with Soviet rule and provoked many 
civilian casualties.

<F P=106> [Ilya Bulavinov report: "Chamber Chairmen Get Invited to </F>
Security Council. President Takes on Two Unwhacked Guys To 
Replace Two Who Have Been"] 
  [Text] Security Council personnel completed the 
preparation of materials yesterday for a session that is 
supposed to discuss the situation in the zone of the 
Ossetia-Ingushetia conflict and the question of the Cossacks. 
It has been tentatively set for 6 April. This session is likely 
to be special because informed sources inside the Council do not 
rule out that the chairmen of both Federal Council chambers will 
be invited to attend it for the first time. 
  For the time being two seats remain vacant in the Security 
Council which are intended, under the law "On Security," for a 
vice president and first deputy Supreme Soviet chairman. It is 
the vacant seats that Boris Yeltsin obviously had in mind when 
he told Vladimir Shumeyko that the chairmen of the parliament 
chambers could take part in the Council sessions. 
Interestingly, the president had so far felt no urgent need to 
fill the vacancies in this body. More, as KOMMERSANT-DAILY has 
come to learn, its sessions have never before decided on any 
question by voting: the views of today's Council members always 
coincided with that of the president. 
  The president, nevertheless is prepared to expand the circle 
of like-minded people by bringing in representatives of the 
legislative authority. Observers believe this is not just a 
tribute to political decency, but is also a demonstrative 
gesture by the president confirming his readiness for 
cooperation with deputies. The snag is in which way the speakers 
become Council members. If the president brings them in by his 
edict, that would reduce their status to that of federal 
ministers and they would only have the right of consultative 
voice. The deputies would hardly like it. 
  The only alternative is to alter the law "On Security" by 
striking from the list of permanent members the no longer 
existing state positions and adding new ones. During the 
debates, the names of Aleksandr Rutskoy and Yuriy Voronin would 
surely surface, which would inevitably bring back memories of 
last fall. This has already been the case with the president's 
draft decree on amnesty. It is even not ruled out that as a 
result, the deputies would after all set up their own commission 
to probe into last October's events, with all the ensuing 
consequences. 
  In the meantime, as KOMMERSANT-DAILY has come to learn, it 
has also been recognized as expedient, in the draft agreement on 
national accord, to include the parliament heads in the Security 
Council. It also recommends that representatives of 
parliamentary committees be drawn into the work of the Council's 
interdepartmental commissions. For the time being, according to 
KOMMERSANT-DAILY's lights, Vladimir Shumeyko and Ivan Rybkin 
will be invited to the first session of the Council as guests of 
honor with no right to vote.

  [Text] Attorney Dmitriy Shteinberg of Russia's former 
Security Minister Viktor Barannikov has accused the country's 
acting Prosecutor-General Aleksey Ilyushenko of a biased 
approach to Barannikov's case. In Saturday's interview with 
Interfax, he said he intended to raise objections to the 
appointment of Ilyushenko as legal officer monitoring the 
Barannikov process. 
  In defiance of the State Duma's amnesty decision and its 
acceptance by Barannikov, the criminal case against the man has 
not been dropped. According to Shteinberg, cases have been 
dropped against all the other defendants in the October case in 
line with the Duma decision. 
  Shteinberg said that Ilyushenko had already indicated his 
approach to the case was personal and negative. 
  If justice was not restored soon, the attorney would have to 
use the media to request President Yeltsin as the chief 
guarantor of the citizens's rights and to the State Duma that 
they take emergency action to protect the former minister's 
constitutional rights and freedoms. 
  And, Shteinberg intended to brief influential Russian and 
international human rights organizations on the unfair treatment 
of Barannikov by the Prosecutor-General's Office.

  [Text] Valeriy Eksuzian, Director General of the Russian 
Airlines (RAL), told Interfax that the crew of the A-310-300 
airliner was not to blame for the crash in the vicinity of 
Mezhdurechensk on March 22. Nevertheless, Eksuzian emphasized, 
it would be premature to make any final conclusions. What 
happened immediately before the crash could not be determined 
before the "black boxes" are completely decoded. That 
information must be brought from Paris to Moscow by members of 
the investigating commission. 
  Eksuzian believed that two or three days might be needed to 
have the full story known and determine the cause of the crash. 
What data was available now suggested that the situation was 
highly complicated. 
  From the analysis of the radio exchange, "the plane started 
to act in ways which were not programmed into the autopilot. 
Judging by their exclamations, the crew was initially greatly 
surprised." Then the plane suddenly turned left and continued 
spontaneous maneuvers which resulted in an abrupt plunge and the 
eventual crash. 
  The whole chain of events took two minutes and 13 seconds. 
The navigation equipment did not allow for sudden left turns of 
the plane. Eksuzian said, however, that no conclusions could be 
made at this moment. He said that the investigation had been 
joined by test pilots of the Gromov Institute in the town of 
Zhukovskiy, Moscow Region. It is not until the conclusions made 
by the test pilots and the investigation commission members are 
compared with the decoded data of the "black boxes" that a final 
judgement could be made. Eksuzian described as crude 
falsification the report of the French TF-1 channel which had 
quoted an anonymous witness as saying that none of the crew 
members had been present in the cockpit immediately before the 
crash. Eksuzian also said that a chemical analysis of internal 
organ and brain tissues of the crew had shown a high, about six 
percent, content of carbon monoxide. The gas had also been 
found in three or four passengers. The causes of this remained 
unknown, Eksuzian said. 
  As of today, 45 out of the 63 bodies of passengers have been 
identified. A total of 75 passengers and crew were killed in 
the crash of the plane en route from Moscow to Hongkong.

  [Text] Moscow, 2 Apr -- The press service of the Russian 
Government has today made public a statement by the government 
commission on the progress of the investigation into the 
circumstances of the crash of a A-310 plane near the city of 
Novosibirsk. It says: 
  "The government commission chaired by the Russian minister 
of 
transport continues investigating the accident. Experts from 
France and the United States have been invited to take part in 
the investigation as advisers. 
  "The debris of the plane has been evacuated from the site of 
the accident and is now being analyzed. Its black boxes have 
been sent to Paris where their decoding is being completed. 
According to preliminary reports, no information has been 
obtained suggesting that there were any defects in the aircraft, 
its engine, or equipment, but a final conclusion will be drawn 
when all analyses are completed. When the cockpit voice 
recorder was replayed, it was found that unauthorized persons 
had been present in the cockpit during the flight. Experts have 
started identifying the voices and analyzing the crew's behavior 
during the flight and while the accident situation was 
developing. 
  "The government commission is taking the necessary measures 
to help the families of those who died, organize the funerals, 
and provide compensation for the damage caused."

  [Text] The publication of the newspaper Sovietskaya Rossiya 
has been suspended from March 31. INTERFAX was told by a 
spokesperson for the newspaper's editorial board that the Pressa 
Publishing House refuses to accept orders from the newspaper 
which is dubbed "Sovraska" referring to its debt to the printing 
shop. The paper sought subsidies at the Russian Committee for 
the Press to no avail. The newspaper's management does not know 
when the paper is likely to be printed again. 
  In March the newspaper's circulation totaled 450,000 copies 
while only 255,000 subscribers received it. In April it was 
planned to increase the circulation up to 500,000 and 270,000 
copies correspondingly. 
  Following the tragic events on October 3-4, 1993, the 
Russian 
Ministry for Press and Information suspended the newspaper's 
publication. The Russian Court of Arbitration said the decision 
was illegal. The damage sustained by the editorial board was 
over 1,300 Mn rubles. The paper says it did not receive 
compensation so far. 
  The Communist and Agrarian factions of the State Duma 
appealed to the subscribers and the supporters to grant the 
newspaper relief aid "to prevent the people's voice from being 
muffled."

<F P=106> [Interview with SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA Chief Editor Valentin </F>
Chikin by Aleksandr Golovenko; date, place not given: 
"SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA Suspended"] 
  [Text] The "Pressa" Publishing House stopped printing 
SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA as of 31 March. This is what its chief 
editor, Valentin Chikin, said: 
  [Chikin] The pretext for the stoppage is financial. It 
appears that we owe the publishing house for printing work. At 
the same time we have not of course forgotten that the editorial 
office incurred losses of over 1.3 billion rubles -- without a 
kopek's compensation -- as a result of actions, deemed illegal 
by the court, on the part of the Ministry of the Press and the 
selfsame publishing house to close the newspaper in 
October-December 1993. 
  The opposition public, electoral associations, and State 
Duma 
deputies' factions have a permanent platform in SOVETSKAYA 
ROSSIYA. It has repeatedly confronted the country's president, 
head of government V. Chernomyrdin, his deputy O. Soskovets, and 
the leadership of the press department with the issue of 
protecting the newspaper from unlawful persecution, creating the 
basic conditions for it to publish, and safeguarding the mass 
readership against insults to its human rights and political 
views. These appeals seemed to have met with understanding. 
But time passes, words remain just that, and there is still no 
compensation for the losses, no subsidies for the subscriber, 
and no concrete assistance for the editorial office. 
  Now, when we are all talking about civil peace and social 
accord, when the quest for ways of mutual understanding is under 
way, the closure of a popular opposition newspaper is tantamount 
to a stark demonstration of unwillingness to hear the voice of 
the people.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Ivanova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow April 4 TASS -- There were no political 
reasons for suspending the publication of SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA. 
The reason was purely economic: the editors owe the Pressa 
publishing house 250 million roubles for printing services and 
newsprint, Pressa director Vyacheslav Leontiev told ITAR-TASS. 
  He explained that the newspaper had been published 
practically without payment since the beginning of the year. 
Since that time SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA received four written 
warnings, but failed to pay its debt to the publishing house. 
This is why its publication was suspended last Thursday [31 
March]. Similar warnings were sent to the editors of PRAVDA and 
KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA, which managed to pay their debts. 
  According to Leontiev, warnings will be sent today to other 
debtors -- EKONOMIKA i ZHIZN (its debt amounts to 165 million 
roubles), KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA (42 million), NEUES LEBEN (11 
million), SELSKAYA ZHIZN (6 million) and KULTURA (3 million). 
If the editorial boards do not pay their debts soon enough, the 
publication of those newspapers may also be suspended.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Tigran Liloyan and Sergey </F>
Ostanin] 
  [Text] Yerevan, 2 Apr -- Ambassador at Large Vladimir 
Kazimirov, personal envoy of the president of Russia, told the 
ITAR-TASS correspondents at the meeting that took place in 
Yerevan on Friday evening that "the CIS Interparliamentary 
Assembly delegation discussed the state of affairs in the 
Nagorno-Karabakh settlement process and some concrete practical 
questions connected with the continuation of work on the basis 
of the Russian project -- the agreement on ending the conflict 
and on eliminating its consequences." 
  Can one suppose that the Russian initiative has become the 
dominant one in settling the situation in Karabakh? In reply to 
this question, Ambassador V. Kazimirov said that there should be 
no rivalry between the peacekeeping initiatives. What has been 
done is much more important than who did what. 
  The diplomat said that "the agreement plan proposed by 
Russia 
provides first of all, for a cease-fire and for a halt to combat 
actions, a mechanism guaranteeing that the possibility of them 
resuming is reduced to a minimum. This is to be followed by the 
transition to the next phase -- the elimination of the main 
consequences of the armed conflict. That is the withdrawal of 
forces from the territories captured during battles, the 
resumption of the operation of transport and energy 
communications in the conflict region, and the return of 
refugees to rayons and populated areas that they have left, and 
also the continuation of the talks' process." 
  The Russian diplomat explained further the mechanism of the 
settlement initiative. "First of all," he said, "it is 
reinforcing the end of combat actions -- the separation of 
troops by a large distance, especially of heavy armaments, 
beyond the reach of fire." The ambassador noted that 
disengagement forces may be in the region but this requires the 
agreement of all the warring sides and most importantly, the 
readiness of states to allocate forces for disengaging the 
opposing sides. There are no such states yet. Russia is ready 
to take part in such a multilateral operation provided that it 
is acceptable for all the warring sides without exception.

  [Text] Yerevan, 2 Apr -- Because of thick fog this morning, 
the CIS interparliamentary assembly's peacemaking group on 
achieving a Karabakh settlement was unable to fly to 
Stepanakert, as had been scheduled the previous day. Only a few 
members of the group left in automobiles for southeast Armenia. 
Their meeting with Nagorno-Karabakh leaders will be held either 
in Armenia's border areas or in a Nagorno-Karabakh village close 
to the Lachin corridor. The ITAR- TASS correspondent learned 
this at the Armenian Supreme Soviet press center. 
  It will probably take the parliamentarians 10 hours to 
travel 
there and back. There is a shortage of seats so no journalists 
are involved in the trip. 
  The CIS interparliamentary assembly delegation plan to 
return 
to Moscow this evening.

  [Text] The position of Armenia on a settlement in Nagorno 
Karabakh remains the same. Armenia stands for stable guaranteed 
armistice, lifting of the blockade of communications and only 
after this negotiations on the political status of Nagorno 
Karabakh, the Armenian Supreme Soviet's Chairman, Babken 
Ararktsyan, stated after the meeting between Armenian President 
Levon Ter-Petrosyan and the CIS Inter-Parliamentary Assembly's 
mission. The CIS mission is led by Kyrgyz Parliamentary 
Speaker, Meditkan Sherimkulov. 
  Ararktsyan was satisfied with the negotiations with the CIS 
mission held by the Armenian president and the Armenian Supreme 
Soviet. 
  Ararktsyan stressed that it was to give any evaluations to 
the negotiations first before the working groups finished 
discussion on the issue. 
  Ararktsyan suggested that the mission's activities in 
Nagorno 
Karabakh would be of great importance. The mission will leave 
for Nagorno Karabakh on April 2. The final stage of the 
mission's activities provides for trilateral negotiations 
between Armenian, Azerbaijani and Nagorno Karabakh 
representatives. Ararktsyan did not rule out that the issue 
might also be discussed at the CIS summit in Moscow planned for 
April 15. 
  Sherimkulov told journalists on his way to Yerevan that the 
meeting with Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev in Baku on 
Friday morning had justified his expectations. "I hoped for a 
frank conversation and we had it," Sherimkulov emphasized. 
  Commenting on the changes introduce to the schedule (the 
mission had intended to leave Baku for Stepanakert), Sherimkulov 
announced that the Karabakh party had failed to guarantee 
security for the mission when crossing the line of 
Armenian-Azerbaijani confrontation. 
  Sherimkulov said the mission would try to go to Karabakh 
from 
Armenia.

Deputy Prime Minister Vigen Chitechyan paid a two-day official 
visit to Krasnodarskiy Kray. The aim of the visit was to 
regulate the trade and economic ties between Armenia and 
Krasnodarskiy Kray, and solve the problem of air freight flights 
that were canceled two months ago following the crash of a plane 
flying from Krasnodar to Gyumri. 
  The delegation held a number of official and business talks 
with the leadership of the kray and with the representatives of 
various departments and organizations. 
  Three agreements were signed on the principles of trade and 
economic cooperation for 1994, on cultural, educational and 
scientific cooperation, and on [words indistinct] freight 
transportation by air. 
  The Armenian delegation also met with representatives of the

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tigran Liloyan] </F>
  [Text] Yerevan March 31 TASS -- An Armenian opposition 
leader urged the republican parliament to ratify the soonest 
possible the treaty on the legal status of Russian troops on 
Armenian territory, which was ratified by Russia's former 
Supreme Soviet a year ago. 
  Addressing today's meeting of representatives of Armenian 
political forces, focused on relations between the two 
countries, leader of the Ramkavar-Azatakan Party Ruben 
Mirzakhanyan called upon all political forces to join efforts in 
pressing for ratification of the treaty. This is much more 
important than to come up with declarations about friendship 
with Russia, he stressed. Mirzakhanyan recalled that his party 
had recently suggested putting the ratification issue on the 
agenda of the Armenian parliament's session, but this proposal 
failed to win support from lawmakers. 
  The opposition leader labelled as "outrageous" the fact that 
Armenia does not yet have its embassy in Moscow and is 
represented just by a permanent mission. The Armenian Embassy 
is to become the most important political institution, which 
will immediately engage in promotion and coordination of 
bilateral relations between Russia and Armenia, above all in the 
sphere of inter-state relations, Mirzakhanyan pointed out.

<F P=106> [Video report from Yerevan by "Mir" Television Company </F>
correspondent Nune Sarkisyan; from the "Mir" Television Company 
segment of the "Utro" program] 
  [Text] A military delegation headed by Colonel General 
Nikolayev, commander of the Russian Federation Border Troops, 
has visited Yerevan. The main goal of the visit was to sign an 
agreement with the Armenian military in accordance with which 
Armenia's state border [not further specified], which is about 
300 km long, will be defended by Armenian troops and Russian 
border troops. The agreement is the result of repeated meetings 
and talks between the two sides, and it gives a legal basis to 
the real state of affairs concerning the border troops. [video 
shows scenes from the talks, Col. Gen. Andrey Nikolayev being 
interviewed] 
  [Begin Nikolayev recording] It is very important for the men 
in uniform, the Russian border guards, and Armenian citizens 
that they will now be fulfilling this task together, although 
frankly I would like to say that we began doing this work 
earlier but that we did not have a sufficiently firm legal basis 
for this. 
  Today we also examined the question of the material and 
technical provision and the financing of the groups of border 
troop units, (?including) the Armenian group. [end recording] 
  The commander added that despite the critical situation in 
the republic, the Armenian Government is doing everything 
possible for the normal functioning of the border guards in 
terms of providing the necessary electric power, fuel, and food.

  [Text] Armenian Vice President Gagik Arutyunyan chaired a 
regular meeting of the State Commission on Coordinating 
Armenian-Iranian Ties on 31 March. 
  The meeting heard a report on the work carried out by the 
authorized commissions into the circumstances leading to the 
crash of an Iranian C-130 military transport plane over 
Nagorno-Karabakh on 17 March, and on the assistance provided by 
the Armenian authorities for discovering the causes of the 
tragedy. 
  In expressing deep regret over the unfortunate incident and 
human losses, it was noted that Armenia provided and is 
providing unreserved assistance to the experts from Iran and the 
authorized commission from the CIS Interstate Aviation Committee 
for the detailed study of all the circumstances surrounding the 
crash of the plane. 
  The transportation of the victims of the tragedy from 
Stepanakert to Yerevan and then to Tehran was organized on an 
appropriate state level. 
  It was also noted at the commission's meeting that the 
disinformation carried by some [word indistinct] news agencies 
and presumptive assessments of the incident are turning this 
tragic incident into a subject of political exploitation. 
  It was also stressed that many problems still needs to be 
finally resolved. It is evident from the testimony of the 
Iranian experts that the C-130 plane did not have a black box. 
It was also clarified that after flying for 50 minutes from 
Moscow, the plane's airtight seal was disrupted. As a result, 
it dropped 2,400 meters. But the crew decided not to return to 
Moscow airport and instead to continue the flight. The studies 
show that, in general, the plane did not enter Armenia's 
airspace and did not establish contact with Yerevan air-traffic 
controllers, despite the fact that at the initiative of the 
latter an attempt was made to establish contact with it through 
the No. 954 flight of a Russian plane. And Yerevan controllers 
learned from Georgian air controllers that the plane deviated 
from its air route and that they too lost contact with it. 
  It is not clear why the plane sharply deviated from its 
flight path after leaving Georgian territory, entered deep into 
Azerbaijani territory, and flew some 4,000 meters lower. The 
meeting expressed the hope that it will be possible to find 
answers to all questions after a comprehensive study of the 
incident by the experts and authorized commissions. 
  Underlying the vital necessity of establishing stability and 
peace in the region, the meeting also expressed concern that 
Azerbaijan's derailment of initiatives for the peaceful 
resolution of the Karabakh problem is causing tragedy not only 
for the sons of Armenians and Azerbaijanis, but also unwittingly 
for the friendly Iranian people. 
  The commission also examined a number of problems related to 
Armenian-Iranian economic ties.

  [Text] Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk referred to the 
initiative by President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev 
concerning the formation of a Eurasian Union of the CIS 
countries as premature. Speaking before journalists in Kiev, 
Kravchuk said that this idea needs to be studied in-depth. 
However, he added, this should be done not by the CIS heads of 
state but by way of referendums. He underlined that he was 
against the dissolution of the Commonwealth of Independent 
States which, in his opinion, has not yet exhausted itself. 
Vladimir Shumeyko, speaker of the upper chamber of the Russian 
Parliament, earlier supported the initiative by the Kazakhstani 
president on setting up a union of CIS countries on a new basis. 
President of Kirghizia [Kyrgyzstan] Askar Akayev also approved 
of this idea. The official press of the other Central Asian 
republic -- Uzbekistan -- gives it a negative assessment.

  [Text] Tallinn, 1 April -- A soldier of the Russian Border 
Troops was killed on Friday [1 April] morning on Estonia's 
border with Pskov Oblast. 
  As BNS has learned at the Estonian Border Guard Information 
Department, on 1 April around 0400, three soldiers of the 
Russian Border Troops detained two unidentified individuals. 
During an identity control, one of the detained individuals 
pulled out a gun and opened fire on the soldiers, killing one of 
them and wounding two others. Following this, the unknown 
individuals escaped. 
  The Russian Border Troops put all its reserves on alert, and 
are currently searching for the criminals. Also participating 
in the search are local units of the Interior Ministry Troops, 
the Militia, and the Counterintelligence Service. 
  On Friday, Estonian Ambassador to Moscow Juri Khan was 
summoned to the Russian Interior Ministry, where he was given an 
appeal to the Estonian law enforcement authorities to render 
help in searching for the criminals. According to Khan, the 
Russian side believes that the suspects can be hiding on 
Estonian territory. 
  Khan has told BNS that the conversation at the Russian 
Interior Ministry was very "friendly," and that he was assured 
that the Russian side does not regard the accident as a 
provocation. According to Khan, the Russian leadership does not 
have any doubts that the incident was of a criminal nature. 
Khan also reported that, according to the Russian side, the 
criminals spoke Russian without a foreign accent. 
  The press bureau of the Russian Border Troops has neither 
confirmed, nor denied the report that the criminals spoke fluent 
Russian, or that they hid on Estonian territory. A press bureau 
official has also said that the Russian side regards the 
incident as a criminal offense. 
  The duty officer at the Pskov Border Troops Unit has refused 
to reveal to BNS any information about the incident, explaining 
that everybody is busy searching for the criminals.

<F P=106> [Report by Djordje Milosevic] </F>
  [Text] Between Yugoslavia and Belarus -- two brotherly 
Slavic countries -- there is full understanding and a readiness 
to establish diplomatic relations and develop the most 
comprehensive cooperation in all spheres. This is what FRY 
Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic stated in Minsk today after 
meeting with Belaraus Foreign Minister Petr Kravchanka. 
Jovanovic also briefed the Belarus minister on our view of the 
Yugoslav crisis and how the situation is developing, especially 
in Bosnia. Kravchanka said it was of the utmost importance to 
establish peace, make efforts to end the conflict in Bosnia as 
quickly as possible, and abolish the sanctions against 
Yugoslavia. Both sides agreed that the sanctions are unjust and 
counterproductive. 
  The Belarus minister stated that the visit by Vladislav 
Jovanovic will contribute to the development of bilateral 
relations. He voiced expectations that Belarus will soon pass a 
decision to establish diplomatic relations with Yugoslavia at 
the embassy level. Vladislav Jovanovic in this way ended a 
series of talks with Belarus officials. He previously held 
talks with Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich and the deputy 
president of the Supreme Soviet, Vladimir (Rusiakov). Both 
sides stressed the significance of this visit and its 
contribution to the development of cooperation between the two 
friendly nations now and especially after the abolition of 
sanctions against Yugoslavia. 
  The Yugoslav minister visited Belarus at the invitation of 
the country's leadership. This fact also suggests a desire by 
both sides to promote cooperation. It is also worth mentioning 
that Belarus partners expressed support and solidarity with 
Yugoslavia, as well as their disapproval of the sanctions and 
their tightening and the international isolation of Yugoslavia.

  [Text] Moscow March 31 TASS -- Ingush President Ruslan 
Aushev called on Russian President Boris Yeltsin, Prime Minister 
Viktor Chernomyrdin and the chairmen of both houses of Russian 
parliament to "take urgent and effective measures to normalise 
the situation and restore law and order in the region" in order 
to "prevent a new and more bloody conflict between the peoples." 
  The appeal said that in March 1994 the situation in the zone 
of the Ossetian-Ingush conflict had worsened sharply and 
continued to deteriorate. The Ingush leadership blames the 
Ossetian side and believes that the work to "heighten tension in 
the region is well organised and guided." 
  A crowd twice stopped an Ingush funeral procession which 
headed for the cemetery in the village of Krasta in the Prigorod 
district of North Ossetia on Wednesday. The arrival of Vladimir 
Lozovoy, head of the temporary administration, and four generals 
did not stop them from attacking the procession with stones. 
Many were injured, several cars were damaged. 
  Meanwhile, the North Ossetian parliament extended on 
Thursday 
the state of emergency in the Prigorod, Pravoberezhniy and 
Mozdok districts for another two months. No decision to this 
effect has been adopted by the Russian president or the 
Federation Council, the upper house of Russia's parliament, so 
far.

  [Text] The Russian-mediated Georgian-Abkhazian 
consultations, underway in Moscow, have produced a joint 
political declaration and a draft agreement on the repatriation 
of refugees. If nothing happens to interfere, both documents 
are to be signed next Monday. President Yeltsin's emissary for 
Abkhazia, Deputy Foreign Minister Boris Pastukhov, made this 
statement in an exclusive interview with Interfax Friday. 
  The Georgian delegation is led by a special representative 
of 
the Georgian head of state, the Chairman of the Committee on 
Ethnic Minorities Issues and Human Rights Aleksandr Kavsadze, 
and the Abkhazian - by a special representative of the chairman 
of the Abkhazian Supreme Soviet Andrey Djerghenia. 
  Pastukhov also said that on Sunday the UN 
Secretary-General's 
emissary for Abkhazia Eduard Brunner would be expected to arrive 
in Moscow to play a role in the negotiating process. 
  The consultations were very complicated because, said 
Pastukhov, the delegations made phone calls to their leaders to 
coordinate positions almost every other minute. But they had 
made substantial progress and the repatriation agreement would 
hopefully be signed as early as next Monday. 
  In addition to Georgia and Abkhazia, Russia and an emissary 
of the UN High Commissioner on Refugees are to sign the 
agreement. Russia gave has seen the inflow of many refugees from 
Abkhazia.

<F P=106> [Report on news conference by President Leonid Kravchuk with </F>
UNIAN and other unidentified correspondents at UNIAN office in 
Kiev on 2 April] 
  [Text] Kiev -- [Correspondent] Judging by the results of 
the 27 March voting, can you forecast the outcome of the runoff 
election to the Supreme Council? What will your actions be, if 
less than 126 deputies are elected, if their number is between 
126 and 300, and in the third option, over 300? 
  [Kravchuk] This is the first election in Ukraine as an 
independent state. That is why one cannot expect it to display 
the top hallmark of democracy, but the election did take place 
and was quite democratic. There were no serious conflicts in 
the process. There were instances of unethical conduct, but no 
complications in terms of rallies or strikes. 
  Of course, one wished the Supreme Council to be elected 
right 
away. This did not happen because of the large number of 
candidates. The "left" prevails among the 49 elected people's 
deputies, but not too greatly. The western region was the most 
active, electing a higher percentage of deputies than, for 
example, the eastern region. If you look at the next round, 
everything points to the dominance of the "leftist" trend. I do 
not wish to interpret the "left" with a minus and the "right" 
necessarily with a plus. We know from the experience of the 
current parliament that when important issues were tackled, they 
united intelligent and responsible people irrespective of which 
bloc they belonged to, "left" or "right." 
  I would wish for one option only -- to see a Supreme Council 
elected and for the new Supreme Council to take the following 
steps: First of all, pass two constitutional laws which we no 
longer can live without, namely, on the local bodies of power 
and their area of competence, and the law on the president in 
accordance with the Constitution of Ukraine. If these two laws 
are approved, the [presidential] election will take place on 26 
June. 
  [Correspondent] Who do you think can defer the presidential 
election of 26 June, the new Supreme Council, or can the 
president do it under certain circumstances? 
  [Kravchuk] It would be best for the Supreme Council to do 
it, 
because this would be a legitimate step... But in order to do 
that, it has to be elected, and that is the most important 
problem. 
  [Correspondent] Experts remark that all the moves by Kiev 
aimed at confirming Crimea's status as an autonomous republic 
within the composition of Ukraine are used by Yuriy Meshkov to 
step up his rating on the wave of confrontation. With a view to 
this, it would be interesting to know which specific 
instructions did you give to Valeriy Horbatov, the newly 
appointed president's representative in Crimea? What influenced 
your choice of this man for such an important post? 
  [Kravchuk] I do not believe that Meshkov will be able to 
exploit for a long period of time our attempts at accord and 
cooperation. The most important thing is whether the reforms in 
Crimea will be a success, who will do this and in what manner, 
and who will assume responsibility for this. It is these very 
issues that we were discussing with Crimea's Vice Prime Minister 
Yevgeniy Saburov. The main thesis of the conversation was this: 
The leadership of Ukraine, aware of the situation in Crimea and 
its specific nature and guided by the law on the delimitation of 
plenary powers between Crimea and Ukraine, is ready to agree to 
a vast economic autonomy of Crimea. We shall be looking, on the 
edge of our plenary powers, how far one could step either right 
or left, if this serves the cause. But there will be no 
political or military plenary powers which Crimea would like to 
assume. The popularized idea that Crimea should join some 
international structure and become a subject of international 
law will not be supported under any circumstances. 
  The decree on the appointment of Valeriy Horbatov was due to 
a number of circumstances. However, he is not a president's 
representative like, for example, in Donetsk or Lugansk Oblasts. 
There, the president's representative and the administration 
perform the functions of the executive power. That is to say, I 
created a mission of the president of Ukraine and appointed a 
permanent representative with an entirely different status. 
  I outlined three groups of issues for him. Firstly, control 
over the fulfillment of the constitutional laws, decrees, and 
decisions made in Ukraine and which are mandatory on the entire 
territory, including Crimea. Secondly, assistance to Crimea in 
carrying out control over the fulfillment by the central 
government of its decisions in relation to Crimea. Thirdly, the 
permanent representative in Crimea is authorized to carry out 
control and render assistance in relations between Crimea, as 
part of Ukraine, and international organizations. 
  For example, the European Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development is allocating money for the construction of projects 
in Crimea. Not a single international bank, not a single 
international organization will allocate money without Ukraine's 
consent to this. The entire financial aid to Crimea will be 
channeled via Ukraine, its president, and its government. If 
Ukraine gives consent and the money goes to Crimea, the mission 
will tackle this issue. Any official perception of Crimea by 
other states as a subject of international law is out of the 
question. This is why the permanent representative can fulfill 
such instructions as visits to the officials of foreign states 
for clearing up the problems which need solution. 
  The task of the mission will be to [ensure] accord, peace 
and 
quiet between the people of Crimea and Ukraine, so we will not 
allow any conflicts to happen. 
  As far as the appointment of, specifically, Valeriy 
Horbatov is concerned, it took place because he is an 
experienced person, dedicated to the cause and the state and he 
is not splitting the state into pieces. He is a patriot of the 
land on which he lives and this he has proved by his work. 
  [Correspondent] Experts believe that Belarus is going down 
the road of losing its state sovereignty which can mark the 
beginning of the restoration of the Soviet Union. How will it 
affect Ukraine's stand in relation to the CIS? 
  [Kravchuk] I will begin with two important theses. First, 
the Soviet Union can no longer be restored. The second theses 
is that the CIS was not formed as a union, and it is impossible 
to convert the CIS to a union on the basis of the founding 
documents which we signed. The CIS was the first step towards 
the civilized disintegration of the Soviet Union's empire. 
  The president of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev, has 
proposed dissolving the CIS and forming a Eurasian Union. Steps 
towards a Eurasian Union should not be rash and ill-considered, 
since Ukraine, Russia, and many other countries have now joined 
some European structures. Our foreign minister initialled a 
document on partnership and cooperation with the European Union. 
All of the [former Soviet] states have followed this road. 
There would be a conflict: First, we join the European Union, 
then a Eurasian Union emerges. The CIS charter allows CIS 
membership along with membership in any European or world 
political and economic structures. This is a matter of 
formality, but if you look deeper, it is a very serious issue. 
The members of the European Union took 35 years to reach it, 
and we think we can do it in a single decision. You cannot. 
Without preconditions, no mechanisms or structures will work. 
My opinion is that we must now utilize the potential of the CIS 
and the potential of the relations between the states. 
Decisions on the next steps must be taken only in consultation 
with the people, with parliaments. 
  [Correspondent] How will the implementation of the 
Ukrainian-American agreements be affected if the government 
preserves the fixed karbovanets-dollar rate in Ukraine's system 
of currency regulation, which the National Bank of Ukraine and 
the International Monetary Fund are opposed to? 
  [Kravchuk] We are not talking about a fixed rate, but 
rather, 
a regulated rate. It will be agreed with the National Bank and 
can vary according to the situation. I think such regulation is 
temporary and will not be our permanent policy. I do not think 
a regulated rate is an obstacle to investments promised to 
Ukraine in the USA. 
  [Correspondent] What is your attitude toward the statement 
by 
People's Deputy of Ukraine Leonid Kuchma to the effect that the 
new policy in Ukraine should be made by people "with clean 
hands?" 
  [Kravchuk] I read this statement. The analysis of the 
situation made by the former prime minister, currently the 
president of the Ukrainian Union of Industrialists and 
Entrepreneurs, was made proceeding from the realities of life. 
However, I see a moral problem here, which the answer to the 
question has led to. Attempts to shift the entire blame onto 
the government, the president, and other executive structures 
are made by the man who was in the government and who applied 
his efforts to what we have today. 
  During the "rule" of Leonid Danylovych [Kuchma] prices 
soared 
dozens of times, the correlation between the consumption fund 
and the accumulation fund was upset. The largest cataclysms and 
strikes took place at that time. The decrees by the Kuchma 
government upturned everything. Today I am signing guarantees 
to foreign firms which, for example, wish to build a terminal. 
After those decrees, they do not believe our laws and the most 
awful thing is to lose investor's trust. 
  One of the latest statements by Leonid Kuchma sets the aim 
of 
removing Kravchuk's "party of power" from leadership. When 
Vyacheslav Chornovil says this, I understand this (although he 
also belonged to the "party of power" being head of the Lvov 
Oblast council). However, the "party of power" was a "cradle" 
for Leonid Kuchma. The production association "Pivdenmash" 
[southern machine plant in Dnepropetrovsk] is a state within a 
state. Such a post gave everything one could get: Kuchma was a 
member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, a 
deputy, a director, and a secretary of the Party committee. 
Even now Kuchma belongs to the "party of power," as he heads 
the Ukrainian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs. Does 
he have any moral right to call for the removal of the "party of 
power?" It is not by chance that people say: "And who are the 
judges themselves?" 
  When Kuchma decided to leave the post of prime minister, we 
agreed that normal relations should remain between us. All of a 
sudden, Leonid Kuchma probably forgot he was talking with me. I 
have never seen anything like this happen in this world, when a 
man who left the post, would stir up such a "wave"... I 
expressed my opinion; I was silent, and now I have said this. 
And I will say more, if need be. [end Kravchuk] 
  In reply to a question by REUTER on the possibility of a 
split or even territorial dismemberment of Ukraine (a 
possibility discussed by certain political circles in Russia), 
Leonid Kravchuk said: 
  [Kravchuk] These prospects have been discussed for a long 
time. We are holding on, and I think, will hold out. I am 
mostly hoping for internal stability and, first of all, for 
economic measures. Secondly, I know from experience when a 
nation faces the problem to be or not to be, it does not take an 
irresponsible attitude. Donbass has voted for federalism, for 
the CIS (I am referring to the poll), but they did not vote for 
immediate action. This has to be done in a legitimate way. 
  For example, back in Soviet times, the Ukrainian SSR passed 
a 
law on languages recognizing Ukrainian as the state language and 
Russian -- the language of interethnic communication. 
  My opinion is this: Ukraine will not lose from having two 
official languages. It will not cease to be an independent 
state. The time will come when the ground will be prepared, 
teachers will be trained and textbooks, literature will be 
published, but we will not accomplish anything in one or two 
years. I would not even raise this issue, or raise it in this 
aspect only. [end Kravchuk] 
  Commenting on the statement made by Supreme Council Chairman 
Ivan Plyushch at the poll saying that only he who is unsure of 
his strength is afraid of elections, Leonid Kravchuk said: 
  [Kravchuk] You will not make me quarrel with Ivan 
Stepanovych. He and I have shared and continue to share a common 
view on the constitutional processes. Once the Supreme Council 
is elected, it must pass two laws: On local power bodies and on 
the president... [end Kravchuk] 
  Leonid Kravchuk responded favorably to the question about 
the 
need for the president to have his own political party which 
would command a majority in parliament. In particular, Kravchuk 
said: 
  [Kravchuk] I agree with those who say that one should run in 
the presidential election having one's own party. If the "left" 
wins the Supreme Council election, it is clear that this will 
call for a president who supports the "left" forces. Otherwise, 
the president will be unable to work, haunted by various rumors 
and unbearable moral pressure. This is confrontation. That is 
why I am emphatically in favor of the idea that the president 
must have his own party in order to win, must a majority in 
parliament and work for the interests of Ukraine.

<F P=106> ["Lviv Oblast: Seven Parties Can Count on Winning Seats. </F>
Communists Striving To Join This Group"] 
  [Text] The elections on 27 March have once again confirmed 
that Galicia is distinct even from its neighboring Western 
Ukrainian oblasts. While voters in Zakarpattya, Bukovyna 
[Chernivtsi Oblast], and Volyn, elected only one deputy in each 
of these oblasts in the first round, and not a single deputy was 
elected in Rivne Oblast, Lviv [Lvov] Oblast has already elected 
nine deputies in 23 districts, Ternopil Oblast -- four in 10 
districts, and Ivano-Frankivsk -- a total of six in 12 districts. 
  However, there are differences between these three oblasts 
as 
well. In Forecarpathia [Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast], a conclusive 
victory over Rukh members has been scored by the "Volkovetskyy 
team" -- a group of prominent Kiev "Vikings" (V. Pylypchuk, V. 
Mulyava, P. Movchan, Ye. Pronyuk), invited to run here by the 
chairman of the oblast council of people's deputies [Stepan 
Volkovetskyy] (who has long been battling the local supporters 
of [Vyacheslav] Chornovil, entrenched in the oblast state 
administration). They were joined by Stepan Volkovetskyy himself 
and the leader of the local Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists 
[KUN]. On the other hand, in Ternopil Oblast, each of four 
parties (Rukh, Ukrainian Republican Party [URP], KUN, and the 
Ukrainian National Assembly [UNA]) have so far won one seat each. 
  The situation in Lviv Oblast is somewhat more complicated. 
So 
far (as anticipated), those forces that put their stakes on 
well-known public figures have been most successful -- namely, 
Rukh and the New Wave [Nova khvylya] Union. Outright victories 
were scored by the well-known deputies and Rukh members Les 
Tanyuk and Yaroslav Kendzyor, Viktor Pynzenyk from the New Wave 
Union, and Mykhaylo Kosiv and Ihor Yukhnovskyy, who cooperated 
with both political currents. Also in this group are Stepan 
Khmara, the leader of the Ukrainian Conservative Republican 
Party [UKRP], who won overwhelmingly over his long-time 
opponent, Mykhaylo Horyn, head of the URP, as is Ivan Bilas, 
member of KUN and a well-known military historian. The exception 
here was an independent candidate -- Yevhen Zherebetskyy, an 
associate of the Academy's Institute of Ukrainian Studies, who 
was one of the founders of the Lviv organization of Rukh in 1989 
and then lay very low in political terms for the next five years 
(colleagues new to this job asked this author in amazement "Who 
is this man?"). Another event that created a sensation was the 
lightning-quick victory of Ihor Koliushko, a young politician 
from the New Wave Union (who was also active five years ago). 
  However, there were losses even among the leaders. Left 
behind in the first round were the New Wave's Ihor Hryniv, 
heretofore a people's deputy, and several other of this union's 
favorites. The Lviv organization of Rukh lost its leader, Yuriy 
Klyuchkovskyy; Lyubomyra Boychyshyn of recent fame; the young 
and promising politician, Ihor Derzhko; yet another of its 
celebrities, Volodymyr Chernyak (the latter ran in Lviv Oblast 
against the will of the regional organization of Rukh); and a 
few other candidates. KUN lost General Oleksandr Rol. 
  Still, the "New Wave" can take comfort in the fact that 
People's Deputy Taras Steckiv made it to the second round, 
running ahead of his rival (33.9% as against 
18.7%), People's 
Deputy Iryna Kalynets. Rukh can count on victories by People's 
Deputy Dmytro Chobit, deputy Rukh chairman Oleksandr 
Lavrynovych, and two more of its candidates. Running in the 
second round from KUN will be Serhiy Zhyzhko, head of the KUN 
secretariat, and five of his comrades-in-arms. Among those 
continuing to battle it out in the electoral marathon are 
people's deputies of Ukraine Larysa Skoryk (All-Ukrainian Rukh 
[VNRU] and Orest Vlokh (DemPU). Meanwhile, their independent 
parliamentary colleagues, Ivan Makar and Ihor Derkach, have left 
the race. 
  The URP also finds itself among the outsiders. After the 
defeat of its all- Ukrainian leader, its main hope lies with the 
economist Oleksandr Shandryuk, who fell short of outright 
victory in the first round in Lviv's Shevchenkivskyy electoral 
district by a mere 0.37%. This district serves as a 
perfect 
example of what the fragmentation of democratic forces leads to: 
Due to the large number of democratic candidates (which included 
many well-known figures), the electorate split the vote to such 
a degree that the Communist Oleksandr Holub was able to make it 
to the second round with a paltry (but guaranteed) number of 
votes (7.7%), while a Republican was unable to gain an 
outright 
victory in the first round. 
  In addition to Shandryuk, those still in the fight include 
Oleh Pavlyshyn, head of the oblast organization of the URP, and 
two other members of this party. 
  The UNA has good chances in Lviv Oblast. In his district, 
Oleh Vitovych, the regional commander of the Ukrainian National 
Self-Defense Force [UNSO], is leading (38.5% versus 
24.5%) 
against Mykola Horyn, the chairman of the oblast council of 
people's deputies, while Yaroslav Ilyasevych, chief of staff of 
the same team, is leading against Zoreslava Romovska, a law 
professor (48.9% against 11.3%). In contrast, even 
the name of 
his legendary father, the commander of the Ukrainian Insurgent 
Army [UPA], did not help Yuriy Shukhevych, the leader of the 
UNA, in the elections. Presumably, voters were stopped by the 
candidate's age and poor health. Andriy Shkil, a young and 
promising politician known for his eloquence, who heads the 
oblast committee of the UNA, could have won in many districts of 
Lviv Oblast, but not in the Pivdennyi district, where he ran 
against the unrivaled Viktor Pynzenyk. But, based on the results 
of the first round in Ternopil Oblast, the UNA can count on at 
least three seats. 
  The electoral campaign of the other ultra-right party -- the 
Social- Nationalist Party of Ukraine [SNPU] -- produced almost 
zero results. It is unseemly to count other people's money, but 
judging by the number of leaflets bearing a symbol resembling a 
swastika (to be sure, the SNPU claims that the symbol represents 
a combination of the letters "I" and "N" -- "national idea," the 
number of huge yellow banners bearing the same symbol that 
covered Lviv's most important buildings, and the number of 
evening hours bought on the local television program "Mist," one 
can imagine how much money was spent on the campaign by the 
Social-Nationalists. Nevertheless, not a single one of the 
SNPU's 21 candidates (including its leaders) made it to the 
second round -- apparently their unusual emblem, black shirts, 
and their name, which evokes certain associations, made a 
different impression on the voters than what the SNPU expected. 
All that the Social-Nationalists are left with is taking comfort 
in the victory of their ally, S. Khmara, and the hope that their 
other ally, Iryna Kalynets, wins.

  [Text] More than 5,000 men and women are reported to have 
taken part in a memorial rally that was held on Saturday [2 
April] some 150 meters off the building that used to house 
Russia's dissolved parliament and is currently housing the 
Russian Government, in Moscow. A number of opposition parties 
and movements, including the Russian Communist Workers' party, 
the Working Russia movement, the Army Officers' Union and the 
Women for the USSR movement, held the rally to pay tribute to 
the memory of those who were killed on October 3 and 4 in armed 
clashes in Moscow. 
  The rally declared the October butchers should not expect 
forgiveness. A member of the standing presidency of the 
Congress of Soviet People's Deputies Sazhi Umalatova, Komsomol 
leader Igor Maliarov and the leader of the Liberal-Socialist 
party Valeriy Skurlatov attended the event. 
  A list of the fallen was read out loud and wreaths were laid 
to a symbolic grave at Moscow's White House. 
  INTERFAX reporters heard no speaker make anti-semitic slurs 
although many of those who attended the rally talked about the 
need to purge the country of free masons and Jews". 
  Graffiti on a wall near the White House said Jews were a 
criminal organization, and not an ethnic minority.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with UN Secretary General Butrus </F>
Butrus-Ghali by unidentified RIA-NOVOSTI correspondent, 
commissioned by ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA; date, place not given: 
"Butrus Butrus-Ghali: I Am Inspired by the Active Efforts of 
Russian Diplomacy"] 
  [Text] UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali arrived on 
an official visit in Moscow yesterday. He plans to meet with 
President Boris Yeltsin, the leadership of the Russian 
Federation Federal Assembly State Duma and Federation Council, 
the foreign and defense ministers, and also with Aleksiy II, 
patriarch of Moscow and All Russia. 
  Butrus Butrus-Ghali pointed out that he visited Moscow many 
times while he was Egyptian foreign minister. This is the 
second time that he has been to the Russian capital in his 
capacity as UN secretary general. He said that one of the main 
aims of his visit to the Russian Federation is to "strengthen 
direct ties with the country's leadership" and also to help 
"boost Russia's contribution to UN activity." 
  Before his arrival he gave an exclusive interview for 
ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA. 
  [ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA] Do you support the idea that Russia's 
efforts to avert and resolve conflict situations on the 
territory of the former USSR should receive international 
status? To what extent and in what way is the United Nations 
Organization prepared to take part in peacekeeping efforts in 
places like Nagorno-Karabakh, Abkhazia, Tajikistan, and the 
Dniester Region? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] As for the conflicts that have been unleashed 
in certain independent states on the territory of the former 
Soviet Union, the United Nations and the CSCE have agreed on a 
division of labor with a view to preventing duplication of 
effort. In accordance with this formula the CSCE has assumed a 
peacekeeping role in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, in Moldova, 
and in Georgia -- South Ossetia. While the United Nations, on 
the other hand, has taken the lead with regard to the conflicts 
in Tajikistan and between Georgia and Abkhazia. You may be 
aware that the United Nations opened a small mission in 
Tajikistan in late 1992. My new special envoy to Tajikistan, 
Ambassador Piriz-Ballon [name as transliterated], recently got 
the parties to the conflict to agree to meet in Moscow. 
  A UN observers' mission in Georgia was opened by the 
Security 
Council last August. This is the first operation of its kind on 
the territory of one of the former Soviet republics. My special 
envoy in Georgia, Ambassador Brunner [name as transliterated], 
has held several rounds of political talks with representatives 
of the Georgian Government and the Abkhazians. The Russian 
Federation is acting as mediator in the Georgian-Abkhazian peace 
process and my special envoy has received vigorous support from 
[Russian] Deputy Foreign Minister Pastukhov, President Yeltsin's 
special envoy in Georgia. We are continuing our efforts to seek 
an all-embracing solution to this conflict. 
  [ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA] Whenever questions of the former USSR's 
Baltic republics are examined, the United Nations only places 
emphasis on the Russian troop withdrawal, while Russia 
underlines its concern over the violation of ethnic minorities' 
political and civil rights in the Baltics. Do you think that 
this problem exists and merits the attention of the United 
Nations? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] The General Assembly has extended my 
mediator's mandate with regard to the troop withdrawal from the 
Baltic republics. Last year my special envoy, Ambassador Tommy 
Cox, visited Moscow and the three Baltic countries and I 
reported back to the General Assembly on his information and 
findings. I am inspired by the recent Latvian-Russian agreement 
and I hope that the talks between Estonia and Russia, which are 
expected to resume early in April, will also be completed 
shortly. 
  I know that 25 million Russians have ended up outside Russia 
as a result of the breakup of the former Soviet Union. What is 
more, I know about the difficulties which Russians living 
outside their homeland, including in Estonia and Latvia, are 
experiencing. 
  [ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA] The moves to form a Muslim-Croat 
federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina to some extent contravene the 
peace plan that was agreed with the participation of the UN 
special envoy, a plan which presupposed creating a confederation 
of three ethnic states in Bosnia, precisely indicating their 
territories and borders. Does the United Nations intend to 
formulate a new initiative for an all-embracing settlement in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and in the former Yugoslavia as a whole? How 
do you see Russia's role in resolving the Yugoslav conflict? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] I welcome the recent agreement between the 
Bosnian Muslims and the Bosnian Croats regarding the formation 
of a federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The cochairmen of the 
Steering Committee of the International Conference on the Former 
Yugoslavia also welcomed this accord. At the same time I very 
much hope that representatives of the Bosnian Serbs will take 
part in the talks to find a settlement to the conflict in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina in the near future. The Conference on the 
Former Yugoslavia will continue its work since it is the 
Security Council's approved means of securing an all-embracing 
settlement to all the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia. 
  I am inspired by Russian diplomacy's vigorous creative 
efforts with regard to the former Yugoslavia. In particular, I 
welcome the recent talks between representatives of Serbian 
Krajina and the Croatian Government that took place in Russia's 
embassy in Zagreb under the auspices of Deputy Foreign Minister 
Churkin. I am grateful to Russia for its help for the UN 
Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] in unblocking Tuzla Airport and for 
Russia's willingness to send an extra 300 servicemen to the 
UNPROFOR.

  [Text] Moscow April 1 TASS -- Negotiations of Russian 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and United Nations 
Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, currently here on an 
official visit, were held today at the Russian Foreign 
Ministry's residence to discuss peace-keeping operations of the 
United Nations and Russia. 
  "It was a specific business-like conversation and I am 
grateful to the United Nations secretary-general for it," the 
Russian foreign minister told a news conference here today. 
  The minister described Butrus-Ghali as a diplomat who heads 
the world's leading organization and a person who has made a 
colossal contribution to the solution of international problems, 
including settlement of armed conflicts around the globe. 
  In his turn, Butrus-Ghali said that Russia has played a most 
important diplomatic role on the world scene within the past few 
weeks. The Russian diplomacy helped to find a solution to the 
Sarajevo and Tuzla problem, which was an important contribution 
to peace-making efforts in former Yugoslavia. 
  The secretary-general expressed the hope that Russian-U.N. 
cooperation will bring peace to Georgia and Tajikistan and 
thanked Russia for the assistance to the consolidation of the 
U.N. role. 
  The meeting of Kozyrev and Butrus-Ghali lasted for over an 
hour.

  [Text] Moscow April 1 TASS -- United Nations Secretary 
General Butrus Butrus-Ghali told a news conference upon the 
completion of his meeting with Andrey Kozyrev here today he is 
optimistic about a possibility of U.N.-Russian cooperation in 
peace-making around the globe, including Georgia and Tajikistan. 
  Asked by ITAR-TASS about the Russian peace-making role in 
former Soviet republics and a possibility of these efforts' 
integration with the United Nations global peace-making 
operations, Butrus-Ghali said this was discussed with the 
Russian foreign minister. 
  In his words, the U.N. secretariat is very interested in 
cooperation with Russia and its participation in peace-making 
contingents in various areas. At the same time, a resolution of 
the United Nations Security Council to the effect is necessary, 
which will entail certain financial difficulties. 
  The U.N. peace-making budget has increased from 500 million 
dollars to 3.6 billions within two years, and this is an 
obstacle to be overcome in order to expand cooperation with 
Russia in this sphere, said Butrus-Ghali.

  [Text] Moscow April 2 TASS -- United Nations Secretary 
General Butrus Butrus-Ghali praised Russian diplomats for their 
contribution to the peace settlement in the former Yugoslavia in 
his speech at the Moscow State Institute of International 
Relations. 
  The U.N. secretary general said that the solution to the 
problem of Sarajevo and Tuzla was found thanks to Russian 
initiatives. 
  As concerns the participation of a Turkish contingent in the 
international peacekeeping mission in the former Yugoslavia, 
Butrus- Ghali said it would play no negative role in the region. 
The United Nations is an international organisation, and its 
peacekeeping forces must also be international, he said. 
  Asked about the international community's role in the 
Middle- 
East peace process, the secretary general pointed to the mission 
of the U.N. peacekeepers in the conflict zone. He welcomed any 
initiatives designed to promote the peace process in the 
Middle-East. 
  Butrus-Ghali said the international community is interested 
in expanding the presence of the United Nations and Russia in 
the peacekeeping operations on the territory of the former 
Soviet Union. He noted that the main pitfall on this path was 
financial, as the budget of the U.N. peacekeeping efforts has 
increased considerably in the past two years.

<F P=106> [Studio interview with UN Secretary General Butrus </F>
Butrus-Ghali and with Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev by "Itogi" 
program announcer Yevgeniy Kiselev; in English with superimposed 
Russian translation -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Kiselev] It is a well known fact that in its 
aspiration to play a key role in resolving the Georgian-Abkhaz 
conflict, Russia has long been exerting diplomatic efforts with 
the aim of gaining the status of peacekeeping forces for the 
Russian Federation troops in that region. Issues relating to 
the peacekeeping operations, in which, on the one hand, Russia 
and, on the other, the United Nations are involved, were the 
main subject of the negotiations in Moscow between Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev and UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali. 
Our interview with them focused on this very topic. 
  Mr. secretary general, as everyone knows, the UN 
peacekeeping 
forces must not include servicemen from countries which are in 
one way or another involved in the conflict or whose territories 
neighbor on the conflict. Russia would today wish, on the one 
hand, to widen the UN participation in peacekeeping operations 
in the post-Soviet space, but on the other hand, it does not 
want to refuse to get involved itself in resolving conflicts 
near its borders, nor, indeed, can it refuse to do so. A very 
contradictory situation is thus created. Where do you see the 
way out of this, if there is one? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] Of course there is a way out. Take former 
Yugoslavia, for instance. The United Nations, the European 
Community and, finally, NATO are all taking part in the efforts 
to establish peace in this region. I see no obstacles to 
Russian forces taking part in peacekeeping operations on the 
territory of the former USSR under the Russian Federation flag. 
But at the same time, independent peacekeeping operations would 
be taking place there in close cooperation with Russia, 
involving UN observers, for example. This sort of approach has 
not been adopted previously. 
  Previously, for the United Nations, it was an indispensable 
condition that the entire command of any peacekeeping operation 
remain in UN hands. However, now we do not have enough forces 
for everything. Only recently, the United Nations never had 
more than two or three peacekeeping operations on the go at the 
same time. Today 17 such operations are being condutcted around 
the globe at the same time. The annual budget of the UN 
peacekeeping forces was at one time $500-600 million, whereas 
now it is up to $3.6 billion per year. In this situation, we 
cannot do without additional assistance from the UN member 
countries, and also from various regional organizations. 
  [Kiselev] Nevertheless, if I understood you correctly, you 
rule out the possibility of Russian Federation troops operating 
under the UN flag in the capacity of peacekeeping forces in the 
Transcaucasus or in Tajikistan, for example. 
  [Butrus-Ghali] Yes, it is impossible because the United 
Nations Organization can carry out a peacekeeping operation only 
from the very start, the same way a surgeon will not agree to 
operate on a patient starting mid-way. But if you have already 
started an independent peace-making operation, the United 
Nations Organization can give you assistance and work side by 
side with you. There is another option which is to include 
Russian troops in a broader international peacekeeping 
contingent, under UN command, though. 
  [Kiselev] What countries can send their servicemen to 
participate in such a contingent, for instance, in Georgia, 
Abkhazia, or Tajikistan? Is it at all feasible to form such a 
contingent? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] It is feasible if a relevant agreement is 
attained and if the UN Security Council is convinced that this 
is necessary, because all this has to be paid for but the 
Security Council is not always willing to do this. Many of its 
members are disappointed by the fact that not all recent UN 
peacekeeping operations have been successful, such as Somalia 
and former Yugoslavia. So I repeat, Security Council members 
have yet to be convinced, talks with them are needed. At the 
same time, there are conditions stipulating an international 
nature of the peacekeeping contingent, that is, Russian 
servicemen will account for no more than 20-30 percent of its 
total number while the remaining 70 percent will be made up of 
servicemen from five or six other countries. Only in this case 
will the United Nations defray the cost of the operation and, 
again, on the condition of retaining the political leadership of 
the operation. 
  [Kiselev] So you discussed all the above with our Foreign 
Minister Kozyrev? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] Yes, we did. 
  [Kiselev] And what was the result: sharp disagreements or 
mutual understanding? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] No, on the contrary, I hope that an accord 
will be attained within the next few days, and on its basis we 
will later discuss at the Security Council the issue of 
dispatching UN peacekeeping forces or UN observers to the areas 
of conflict in the former USSR. 
  [Kiselev] But you must agree that UN observers and 
peacekeeping forces are not the same. 
  [Butrus-Ghali] You are right. However, if we do not get the 
Security Council's consent to dispatching peacekeeping forces we 
will still be able to obtain a mandate to dispatch observers. 
  [Interview cuts to Foreign Minister Kozyrev without 
introduction or question from Kiselev] 
  [Kozyrev] Yes indeed, the role of observers is slightly 
different. They are not troops. Therefore, they are taking 
part. But this is useful. We would indeed like our contingent 
to be granted the status of a UN contingent. Incidentally, this 
option is being discussed. We are proposing this option for 
Karabakh, and also for Abkhazia. But the problem once again is 
this: if our contingent officially becomes a UN contingent, ie 
if our servicemen literally don blue helmets, then the United 
Nations has to pay for this in full. But unfortunately this is 
what they do not want to do. Moreover, the United Nations has 
to share with us political responsibility for these efforts. 
Here again, as I have already mentioned, there is a budget 
deficit, and there is also what I would call a deficit of 
political courage and will. But the secretary general cannot 
solve this question on his own. This question has to be solved 
by the UN Security Council. Hence this question is not in the 
hands of the secretary general, but in the hands of, above all, 
permanent members and also other member states of the Security 
Council. 
  Another aspect that we often forget is that the United 
Nations operates on precedents. If the United Nations directly 
agrees to involvement by a neighboring state in some conflicts 
directly on its behalf -- I mean on behalf of the United Nations 
-- one can imagine that in other conflicts, in other regions, 
some other states would demand a similar mandate from the United 
Nations. And here certain difficulties may arise. I will not 
give any examples, but one can easily imagine this. Moreover, 
it may well be that we ourselves will be very much concerned if 
a particular neighboring state starts conducting operations in 
its neighboring state under the UN flag, as it were. 
  [Butrus-Ghali] Security Council members' hesitations are not 
just about you -- though I know that people in Russia do think 
that the United Nations does not want to embark on peacekeeping 
operations particularly in your case, on the territory of the 
former [Soviet] Union. But this is not so. For example, we 
would undoubtedly like to send 600 blue helmets to Mozambique. 
We have been discussing it for six months, but not one of UN 
member states shows any willingness to designate its servicemen 
to be part of this contingent. So I have to go to various 
capitals as a petitioner: please do send you soldiers to 
Mozambique. But after all, UN members have to bear 
responsibility to each other. Suppose tomorrow the United 
Nations asks Russia to send 2,000 Russian servicemen to Angola. 
Public opinion in your country will certainly start buzzing: 
why should we send 2,000 of our soldiers to Angola? Why Angola? 
Where is this Angola anyway? Why should my son risk his life 
in Angola? Preparing public opinion is a huge problem. Say, if 
you want Argentina or Chile --two weeks ago there was 
negotiation about the possibility of those two countries 
allocating some of their servicemen to be sent to Tajikistan in 
the future. So you have to be prepared, in turn, to send your 
servicemen, say, to Angola, however unpopular this measure might 
be. One of my tasks is precisely this. I am telling Russia: I 
know that you have many internal problems at home, but don't 
forget about the United Nations.

  [Text] Moscow April 4 TASS -- A meeting between President 
Boris Yeltsin and U.N. Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali has 
begun in the Kremlin. Greeting his guest, Yeltsin said that the 
world situation had changed during the past two years. Blocs 
ceased to exist, and for this reason "the role of the United 
Nations organisations became absolutely different." The 
president explained that "the U.N. has become more active of 
late, and its role in settling some controversial problems has 
been enhanced." 
  Yeltsin intends to discuss with Butrus Butrus-Ghali the key 
problems dealing with the functioning of the U.N. and with the 
work of the Security Council. They may touch upon other 
problems, including a peaceful settlement of the Bosnian crisis.

Tyssovskiy] 
  [Text] Moscow April 4 TASS -- U.N. Secretary-General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali has described as constructive and positive his 
talks with Russian Defence Minister General Pavel Grachev. He 
thanked Russia for its contribution to the U.N. peace-keeping 
efforts in various parts of the world and expressed hope for the 
continuation of that cooperation in the interests of peace. 
  In his turn, Pavel Grachev thanked the U.N. 
secretary-general 
for that high appreciation and pointed out that it was 
especially important today, when Russia is being accused of some 
"imperial aspiration" by some forces. According to Grachev, 
Butrus-Ghali came up with proposals on Russia's participation in 
a number of peace-keeping operations from the point of view of 
their engineering, rear and technical support. "We agreed to 
those proposals, and shall prepare corresponding units," the 
Russian minister said. 
  Responding to the question of ITAR-TASS whether the granting 
of a U.N. status to our peace-keeping force was discussed at the 
talks, Grachev said that such suggestions were made to 
Butrus-Ghali, and he is going to examine them. He stressed that 
a positive settlement of those problems is connected with the 
problem of financing U.N. peace-keeping operations. The U.N. 
budget envisages two to three such operations a year, while at 
present 17 peace-keeping operations are under way. 
  The Russian side suggested as well the renovation and 
upgrading of the collective security mechanism. Russia 
suggested to the U.N. to bear part of the expenses on the 
transportation and deployment of peace-keeping forces. It is 
also important for us that the armaments and military hardware, 
used by peace-keeping forces, should not be taken into account 
during the calculation of the maximum level of armaments under 
the treaty on the limitation of conventional armaments in 
Europe, Grachev said.

<F P=106> [Interview given by UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali </F>
to IZVESTIYA; date and place not given: "Butrus-Ghali: UN Does 
Not Exist To Punish People. UN Secretary General Answers 
IZVESTIYA's Questions"] 
  [Text] [IZVESTIYA] In what way does the United Nations 
hope to reconcile the principle of noninterference in other 
states' internal affairs with its efforts aimed at asserting 
human rights and democracy worldwide? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] The definition of human rights is contained 
in international treaties to which states accede on a voluntary 
basis. After the treaties are ratified, states assume 
international pledges to respect the spirit and letter of these 
agreements. As a result, the international community of nations 
acquires the powers to monitor and observe how states observe 
the pledges they have entered into. Moreover, existing 
international law sees major human rights violations as 
legitimate grounds for alarm. 
  [IZVESTIYA] How do you plan to combine the right of 
self-determination and the principle of the inviolability of 
state borders? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] Although the term "self-determination" has 
not yet been clearly defined, the international community 
recognizes that all peoples have the right of self-determination 
and are free on that basis to choose their political status and 
to implement their economic, social, and cultural development. 
Implementation of the right of self-determination should not 
infringe the territorial inviolability or political independence 
of any state. 
  [IZVESTIYA] What methods of punishing states which violate 
UN principles are currently under consideration? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] The United Nations does not strive to 
"punish" states which violate its principles. 
  But if the Security Council considers it necessary, it can 
call on parties to a dispute whose continuation could pose a 
threat to the maintenance of international peace and security to 
resolve that dispute through negotiation, investigation, 
mediation, reconciliation, arbitration, judicial examination, or 
an appeal to regional organs. 
  The Security Council can also call on UN members to break 
off 
economic relations or rail, maritime, air, postal, telegraph, 
radio, and other forms of communication with the state violating 
international norms, as well as breaking off diplomatic 
relations with it. 
  [IZVESTIYA] How does the United Nations rate the prospects 
for the use of armed forces for peacekeeping purposes? Practice 
has shown that even the operations in Cambodia failed to produce 
the expected results. 
  [Butrus-Ghali] The establishment of peace is primarily tied 
in with the utilization of armed forces against those who use 
force to violate a peace agreement. This approach is laid down 
in the rules governing peacekeeping operations. But the main 
question is different -- will the United Nations have enough 
military resources to carry out such measures, and will it have 
enough political will to see them through? If the answer to 
both questions is in the affirmative, then it may be possible to 
establish peace. [Butrus-Ghali ends] 
  UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali arrived on a 
five-day official visit to the Russian capital Friday. The VIP 
guest's first statement to journalists on Russian soil was

  [Text] Russia is not trying to avoid cooperation with the 
UN, Deputy Russian Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov, who 
specializes in relations with the UN and other international 
organizations, told Interfax. Lavrov is expected to leave for 
New York as the Russia's permanent ambassador at the UN. 
  Lavrov said issues on peacemaking activities, including on 
CIS territory, and on strengthening of the UN as an organization 
capable of uniting efforts of all states and of helping them to 
define the basis of the new system of international relations, 
would be discussed during the visit of the UN Secretary General 
Butrus-Ghali to Moscow (on April 1-5). 
  Lavrov did not rule out a discussion on reorganization of 
the 
UN Security Council and the UN in general. He stressed that the 
issue was being considered by a specially established working 
group which was discussing criteria for possible enlargement of 
the UN Security Council. Possible candidacies were also 
discussed, including Germany, Japan, India, Nigeria, Egypt, 
Indonesia and other states. However, this does not mean that the 
candidacies will become a full member of the UN Security 
Council. Consensus was required to resolve the issue, primarily 
in the regional groups. 
  Lavrov said enlargement of the UN Security Council must be 
balanced not only from the point of view of the industrially 
developed countries but also from the point of view of 
geographical regions. He suggested that the parties concerned 
would have to discuss this issue for a long time. There were 
proposals to finish the work on the issue by the fiftieth 
anniversary of the UN (1995). However, they were not accepted. 
The anniversary was not the main criterion for the work. 
  Russia is prepared to consider the issue on limited 
enlargement of the UN Security Council. However, the efficiency 
of the Security Council must be preserved or even increased.

  [Text] Russia's Defense Ministry is well aware of the fact 
that the Partnership for Peace program is one of the concrete 
demonstrations of NATO strategy aimed at the alliance's 
adaptation towards the modern geopolitical realities, Russian 
Defense Minister Army General Pavel Grachev declared during his 
meeting with cultural figures on Friday. 
  Having qualified the geopolitical and military-strategic 
situation as unfavorable for Russia, Grachev pointed out that if 
the Russian Federation abstains from joining this program it 
"will lose the initiative and will end up in self-isolation." 
  "Today Russia strives to receive a status which is adequate 
to its weight and role including partnership with NATO and the 
United States," said Grachev. At the same time he underlined 
that the Russian Federation "would not restrict its activity 
within the framework proposed to it but would focus its 
attention on further development of bilateral relations with 
NATO's leading members." 
  According to Grachev, "nobody questions Russia's integration 
into NATO's military structures, we see the need in cooperation 
and integration with NATO for the sake of peace in Europe and in 
the whole world." 
  As Grachev indicated, under the present situation strategic 
nuclear forces are the real guarantor of Russia's security. "We 
give priority to the development of these forces given this 
fact," said Grachev. 
  In his words, taking into consideration the country's 
economic opportunities the Defense Ministry does its utmost to 
make the troop reduction process go smoothly. "There is no need 
to maintain a 4-5 Mn strong army but we cannot cut it down to 
1.9 Mn people under any conditions either," noted Grachev. 
  The Defense Ministry has prepared proposals to make more 
concrete and to develop new decrees. It primarily concerns 
changes and supplements to the decrees on defense, military duty 
and military service, on the status of the servicemen, and on 
pensions. The ministry also intends to develop new decrees on 
military state, military militia, and on military courts. 
  As Grachev declared, recently "we managed to lower the 
sharpness of military discipline." Compared with 1992 the total 
amount of crimes in 1993 reduced by one fourth, there were 17 
percent less crimes related to arms and ammunitions robbery, the 
number of crimes connected with unauthorized relations has 
reduced by 22.3 percent. Nevertheless, the problem of 
servicemen's death as a result of suicides still remains 
pressing.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Mikheyev report: "Process of Russia's Joining </F>
NATO Postponed. Until Fall, as President's Press Secretary 
Said, Or Forever?] 
  [Text] The pent-up storm potential of criticism of the 
"marriage contract" the Americans have drawn up with former 
members of the Warsaw Pact, known as the "Partnership for Peace" 
program, has been eased by a statement by the president's press 
secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov, who declared that Yeltsin will 
not rush to join Russia to the Atlantic alliance. 
  Before making a final decision the president will hold 
consultations with all political forces. The process of joining 
NATO has been put on hold for six or seven months. 
  Establishing partnership relations with NATO of an 
indeterminate quality and unclear status constitutes a 
"political step" for Russia, Kostikov said, and therefore 
"public consent" has to be reached first. 
  The document prepared within the bowels of NATO fails to 
mention key problems, Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the State Duma 
Committee for International Affairs, has said. Who will defend 
whom? In what circumstances? On what terms? 
  It is not clear how equal the command of this complex 
international organism will be. What if Moscow objects to any 
joint actions planned in Brussels, but which have to be carried 
out by all members? Will Moscow have a voice that will be 
heeded? 
  The scope of the enlarged NATO's powers also remains 
unclear. 
Will it be confined to "peacekeeping" operations or might there 
be a question of operations "to establish peace," that is, 
coercive measures using armed force? 
  How does the NATO sphere of interests tie in with the 
process 
of European cooperation within the CSCE framework? The CSCE has 
an internationally recognized mandate to ensure security and 
stability but at the same time it has no mechanism for 
peacekeeping activity. NATO on the other hand has no such 
mandate, but it does have force of arms. 
  What is to be done with the slowly developing CIS collective 
security structure? Russia is not pressing for the dissolution 
of NATO, but it cannot predict how this alliance will behave 
toward the CIS. 
  The sixth question concerns a demand common to all the 
bloc's 
members -- to arrive at uniformity in the armaments system. How 
far will standardization undermine the positions of Russian 
manufacturers of military hardware? 
  Lastly, the financial situation -- amid industrial decline 
and inflation will Russia be able to bear the burden that will 
be asked of it? 
  There is every indication that the postponement decision was 
viewed with understanding in the upper echelons of NATO.
