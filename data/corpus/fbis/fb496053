<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Shvedov] </F>
  [Text] Delhi, 1 Apr -- The Government of Pakistan will 
allocate Tajikistan $20 million in payment for purchasing 
Pakistani consumer goods. This is one of the results of the 
visit to Pakistan by an official delegation from Tajikistan 
headed by Supreme Council Chairman Emomali Rakhmonov. During 
the course of the talks held in Islamabad, the parties agreed to 
study the possibility of carrying out a joint project worth $500 
million to erect a powerful electric power station in the south 
of Tajikistan. According to the plan, Pakistan should receive 
power from the station across the territory of Afghanistan. 
  At their meeting, the Tajik leader discussed with Pakistan's 
President Faruq Leghari and Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto a wide 
range of international issues concerning, among other things, 
the situation in central and southwest Asia. The head of the 
Pakistani government said, among other things, that the unstable 
situation in neighboring Afghanistan and Tajikistan was having a 
negative effect on the situation throughout the Central Asian 
region. Bhutto expressed the hope that the strife in these two 
countries would be ended as soon as possible. She also stressed 
that the use of military force to solve controversial problems 
was unacceptable both for the Tajik and Afghan peoples. 
  In turn, Rakhmonov said that with the start of talks in 
Moscow between the Tajik leadership and the opposition, the 
situation in the republic would undergo serious alterations 
toward normalization. Tajikistan will soon come out of its 
political and economic crisis, he declared. 
  Another important result of the talks held in the Pakistani 
capital was the signing by Tajikistan and Pakistan of a protocol 
on developing amicable relations between the two countries as 
well as an agreement to expand bilateral economic cooperation.

  [Text] Dushanbe April 2 TASS -- Tajikistan Parliament Chief 
Imomali Rakhmonov has described the results of his three-day 
visit to Pakistan as highly productive. A whole package of 
documents and first of all a treaty of friendship and 
cooperation between the two countries was signed during the 
talks, he said. 
  At a news conference on Saturday, Rakhmonov emphasised that 
the Tajik delegation had found understanding and interest on the 
part of the Pakistani side on all matters discussed. The Tajik 
leader devoted special attention to economic aspects of the 
talks, pointing out that the Pakistani Government favours closer 
economic cooperation with his country, particularly in 
hydropower engineering and road building. 
  The discussion of the inter-Tajik problem figured 
prominently 
during the meetings between the heads of state, the Tajik leader 
said. The Pakistani side welcomed Dushanbe's initiative 
concerning a peaceful settlement of the conflict and forthcoming 
talks in Moscow with representatives of the opposition with the 
participation of Russia and the United Nations organisation, and 
measures to repatriate Tajik refugees as soon as possible. 
  "We stated that we are prepared to launch a dialogue with 
any 
sober-minded opposition forces that are sincerely interested in 
the termination of the armed confrontation," Rakhmonov said. 
  "We do not put forward any pre-conditions except putting an 
end to provocations on the Tajik-Afghan border and to terrorist 
acts inside the country and allowing an unhindered repatriation 
of Tajik refugees," he said. 
  Speaking about the initiative proposed by Kazakh President 
Nursultan Nazarbayev to establish a Euro-Asian union, Rakhmonov 
pointed out that the idea merited attention.

  [Text] Dushanbe April 2 TASS -- Tajik opposition militants 
are carrying on tactics of armed provocations on the 
Tajik-Afghan border. On the night of March 31 to April 1, 
unidentified attackers fired from automatic weapons from a rear 
area on a border post of the Kazakh battalion of the 
peacekeeping force in Tajikistan in the sector of border picket 
no. 1 of the Khorog border-guarding detachment, a spokesman at 
the press centre of the Russian border troops in Tajikistan told 
ITAR-TASS on Saturday morning. The border guards returned the 
fire after which the attackers fled upon wounding a Kazakh 
serviceman. 
  On Friday afternoon, in the sector of border picket no. 3 of 
the Panj border-guarding detachment, Tajik opposition militants, 
who had infiltrated from the territory of Afghanistan, fired on 
a border patrol. There were no casualities among border guards. 
  The situation on the Tajik-Afghan border remained relatively 
calm on Friday night and Saturday morning.

  [Text] Riga, Apr 04, BNS -- The Latvian Saeima 
(parliament) Presidium decided Monday [4 April] to convene an 
extraordinary session on April 15 to discuss security policy and 
the initialed Latvian-Russian agreements on troop withdrawal. 
  The initiative came from President Guntis Ulmanis and Prime 
Minister Valdis Birkavs in compliance with the 20th article of 
the Latvian Constitution. 
  Under the agreement, Russia operates its radar facility at 
Skrunda in Latvia for four years and has 18 months to dismantle 
it. Latvia also guarantees the social protection of retired and 
serving military personnel on its soil. In return, Russia 
pledges to get all its troops out of the Baltic country by 
September. 
  So far, the deal has met with fierce protest by Latvia's 
opposition parties and political organizations claiming that the 
signature and ratification of the agreement would mean 
legalization of Latvia's occupation by the Soviet Union in 1940.

  [Text] Riga, Apr 04, BNS -- The Russian military attache 
to Latvia, Capt. Vladimir Konyaev, was accredited April 1 at the 
country's Defense Ministry. 
  The event was "a substantial step toward normalization of 
relations between Latvia and Russia," Defense Minister Valdis 
Pavlovskis told reporters after the accreditation. 
  Russian Ambassador Aleksandr Rannikh agreed to the 
minister's 
words saying that the appointment of Russian military attache to 
Latvia would promote contacts between both countries' defense 
structures. 
  The activities of the newly accredited attache would not be 
directly connected with the process of Russian troop withdrawal 
but he is expected to engage the Russian embassy in tackling 
withdrawal problems.

  [Excerpt] Tallinn, Apr 04, BNS -- The next round of 
intergovernmental talks between Estonia and Russia is to be held 
near Moscow on Tuesday [5 April] and Wednesday. 
  Ago Tiiman, secretary of the Estonian delegation for the 
talks, in his comments to BNS today said the new round was to 
deal with the four traditional series of topics -- humanitarian, 
economic, military and border issues -- and that no substantial 
changes were expected when compared to the previous rounds. 
  Also to be discussed is the issue of taking out nuclear fuel 
from two reactors located at a Russian naval base in the 
Estonian small town of Paldiski. It is possible that a 
technical protocol on the issue will be signed, after which work 
on taking out the fuel from the two reactors can begin, Tiiman 
added. 
  The main obstacle on the way to progress in the talks is the 
issue of retired Russian army officers, who Russia wants must be 
granted guarantees that they will get permanent residence 
permits in Estonia. 
  Estonia's chief negotiator for the talks, Vaino Reinart, 
told 
BNS the main controversy between the two sides in the talks was 
that Russia wants to fix the categories of persons who will 
start applying for residence permits in Estonia, whereas Estonia 
insists that the circle of these persons is not to be 
established in the agreement. Estonia says the document should 
just establish the rules under which the retired officers will 
receive their pensions and pay for medical services in Estonia.

  [Text] Tallinn, Apr 04, BNS -- Participants in a picket in 
front of Russia's naval headquarters in Tallinn today urged that 
the country's delegation for talks with Russia must not go to 
any political or moral concessions at the upcoming round of 
talks, due to begin Tuesday [5 April]. 
  The picketers addressed an appeal to the delegation. 
  The Estonian people have enough strength and patience to 
wait 
until the Russian army leaves Estonia. "Go back to your homeland 
so you will at least be able to watch Ostankino," said Viktor 
Niitsoo, head of the National Independence Party faction in the 
Estonian parliament, referring to protests by Russians about 
Estonia's decision to finish airing the broadcasts of the major 
Russian TV station in Estonia. 
  Ulo Ojatalu, a former political prisoner, spoke about the 
remaining Russian army units' alleged connections with organized 
crime in Estonia. "Army in a foreign country turns into a den of 
thieves," he said. 
  Pickets in protest against the presence of Russian troops in 
Estonia are held in front of the Russian naval headquarters a 
few hundred meters from the Estonian parliament and government 
building each Monday. The Estonian National Independence Party 
has called on people to continue the weekly pickets until the 
last Russian soldier has left the country's soil.

  [Text] Estonia will make no concession to Russia at 
bilateral negotiations another round of which will open 
tomorrow, vice chairman of Estonia's parliament said on Monday 
[4 April]. 
  "Estonia has adopted the Law on Aliens under which we can 
meet with humanitarian requests, but Estonia will not retreat in 
main issues," Tunne Kelam said at a traditional Monday afternoon 
picket before Russian military headquarters in Tallinn. 
  The Estonian National Independence Party (ERSP) held the 
picket for the eight time to press for complete and orderly 
troop pullout by the August 31 deadline. Another issue they 
press for is that retired Russian military should not be allowed 
to stay in Estonia. 
  "We have enough patience and as long as ERSP stands in the 
ruling coalition, there will be no concessions to Russia," MP 
Viktor Niitsoo said. 
  One of the slogans carried was "Latvia's washout is a 
warning 
to Estonia" referring to Latvia's consent to allow residence of 
the retired military. 
  All Estonian higher officials, including Defence Minister 
Juri Luik, have said that Estonia would make no concessions. 
  Prime Minister Mart Laar said on Monday that Estonia could 
not possibly follow Latvia's Way as Estonian and Latvian laws 
are different and in order to agree to documents similar to 
those initialed between Russia and Latvia, Estonia would have to 
change its legislation which the present government would not do. 
  Laar also expressed his regret that cooperation between 
Estonia and Latvia in foreign policy was not good enough.

<F P=106> ["News Release"] </F>
  [Text] Tallinn, April 4 -- On Monday [4 April] 
oppositionist factions of the parliament proposed to form a 
committee to investigate the incident over the second-biggest 
Estonian daily RAHVA HAAL that has lasted for two weeks already, 
leading to the situation where the former staff of RAHVA HAAL is 
denied access to staff rooms. 
  Rural Party faction and Coalition Party faction bill 
prescribes formation of a committee, the members of which would 
be appointed by parliament factions and which would have to 
clarify how the activities of the board of RAS Rahva Haal, that 
issues the daily, have limited freedom of press and how much 
financial damage has been caused to the state by this. 
  The Centrist faction presented another bill according to 
which a temporary committee be formed to solve the incident over 
RAHVA HAAL. The bill proposes to stop the activities of the 
board of RAHVA HAAL till the end of investigation, abolish 
contracts with AS Hommikuleht and demand that the latter return 
money paid to them by the state. 
  Turmoil over the daily started already in May last year when 
Estonian Privatization Agency decided to privatize the 
state-owned newspaper. Head of the Privatization Agency Liia 
Hanni has admitted later that in the course of the 
privatization, the result of which is, that two applicants, one 
of them AS Hommikuleht, to the daily gave the matter to the 
court, the Agency acted in disagreement with existing laws. At 
present the matter has reached the Supreme Court and the 
privatization of the daily has been stopped. 
  In October last year the board of the daily was changed with 
majority given to representatives of the government coalition. 
On March 18, the board adopted a decision to change the 
statutes of the company, abolishing the institution of 
editor-in-chief and creating a new institution of 
publisher-in-chief. Majority of the staff of the paper, in 
protest to the decision, resigned and decided to join AS RH, 
formed by the RAHVA HAAL staff last year to participate at the 
privatization. Editor-in-chief Toomas Leito was dismissed by 
the board "for loss of trust" and not preserving political 
balance of the paper. Toomas Leito told ETA that the decisions 
of the board of RAS Rahva Haal had been of "purely political" 
nature. 
  After the staff of RAHVA HAAL had left to AS RH, they 
started 
to publish their own paper EESTI SONUMID. RAHVA HAAL was 
published by RAS Rahva Haal in cooperation with AS HOMMIKULEHT, 
another Estonian daily. 
  On Monday, Estonian Ministry of Culture and Education sent a 
letter to the managing director of AS Ajakirjandusmaja that 
administers the Tallinn Press Building where most of the biggest 
newspapers are located, demanding that in 24 hours "outsiders" 
(meaning the former staff) leave the 5th floor rooms rented to 
RAS Rahva Haal. 
  Managing editor of EESTI SONUMID Tiit Lehiste told ETA that 
from Monday morning EESTI SONUMID staff has not been let into 
their rooms in the 5th floor, with security guarding the door. 
The staff was let into the rooms only in pairs to fetch their 
private things. Also phones were switched off and door locks 
changed. 
  Chairman of the board of AS RH Ester Sank told ETA that on 
Thursday, before the Easter holidays, AS RH had had an agreement 
with the chairman of the board of RAS Rahva Haal Veiko Jurisson 
according to which half of the rooms on the 5th floor could be 
kept by AS RH till April 21. The decision was for some reason 
changed during the holidays, she said. 
  Monday evening, managing director of AS Ajakirjandusmaja 
Juri 
Kriisemann told ETA that an agreement has been reached with two 
companies that they would temporarily, for about one month, give 
up their rooms at the Press Building in favor of AS RH, a 
decision that has also been accepted by Ministry of Culture and 
Education. 
  EESTI SONUMID has sent a letter to Riigikogu [parliament] 
introducing the situation and asking MPs' position and support 
in the matter in order the conflict not to reach an incident 
with tragic results. The letters says that in Estonia 
"precedent has been created where a civil dispute is solved with 
force with the support of the executive authorities", calling it 
"states violence with political colouring". 
  Estonian Press Complaints Board discussed the problems 
around 
RAHVA HAAL/EESTI SONUMID, on Monday, and made a statement saying 
that the state as the owner of RAHVA HAAL "has not acted in 
accordance with state of justice norms of the end of 20th 
century", and what has taken place in relation to the staff of 
the paper was to be considered as "limitation of the freedom of 
press". 
  RAHVA HAAL is the biggest daily distributed all over Estonia 
that belongs to the state. Its circulation is 47.6 thousand at 
week-days and 50 thousand at Saturdays. EESTI SONUMID, 
according to their own data, have reached almost the same.

discussion the personal issue of Mart Laar," Made said, 
mentioning that he had stopped short of calling it an issue of 
no-confidence. 
  He said it was the government's attempt to submit the RAHVA 
HAAL newspaper directly to the government's control that may 
cause raising the issue in the parliament. 
  Made and another opposition MP, the Centriat Party's Andra 
Veidemann, visited RAHVA HAAL's editorial premises in the Press 
House, Tallinn, today. The premises were taken under guard in 
the early morning today by a security company hired by RAS Rahva 
Haal, the state company that still owns the newspaper's 
trademark, but has lost most of the former staff in a conflict 
that led to the emergence of EESTI SONUMID, a new title 
published by RAHVA HAAL's former staff. 
  The security guards, apparently acting under instructions to 
prevent possible takeover of the premises by ex-staffers who 
enjoy massive support by the newspaper's subscribers, today let 
the former employees in only in groups of two to take their 
personal belongings from their once places of work. 
  Made also said he had been surprised to see that RAHVA 
HAAL's 
editorial premises were guarded by a security company owned by 
Agu Kivimae, one of the owners of the company Maag Ltd. that 
took part in bidding for RAHVA HAAL in the newspaper's 
privatization last year. The privatization authorities adopted 
a decision in favor of Maag, but the issue finally ended up in 
court after protests from Maag's competitors. 
  Veidemann referred to the possibility of a legal offense, 
saying the blocking of RAHVA HAAL's premises had taken place 
without a court order. 
  She said a court must now decide whether the steps taken by 
the state company's leadership were legitimate. 
  The two MPs said they had seen no evidence in support of 
some 
recent allegations that the ex-staffers had stolen some of the 
property belonging to the state-owned newspaper. 
  Security guards hired by the ex-staffers today called off 
their agreement and left the premises of the editorial office.

  [Text] At parliamentary hearings on the pace of land reform 
in Russia, the Federation Council's and the State Duma's 
Agrarian Committees rejected the program on agricultural reform 
for 1994-1995, endorsed by the government on March 31. 
  In the opinion of participants in the debates, the plan 
drawn 
up by the agriculture and food ministry "could at best be an 
agricultural policy concept as it falls short of specific 
recommendations for better farm production." 
  They argued that an agricultural development program last 
"at 
least until 2000" and indicate not only guidelines and stages of 
reform but also "concrete results" that Russian farmers could 
achieve if the plan succeeded. 
  A statement adopted at the end of the parliamentary hearings 
recommends that the National Agricultural Academy and 
agriculture and food ministry put the final touches to a federal 
program on measures to carry out agrarian reform, restore and 
develop agro-industrial production by the year 2000, worked out 
by a group of experts led by ex vice-president Aleksandr Rutskoy 
in early 1993. 
  The cabinet was asked to submit the rehashed variant of this 
program for debate in the parliament's lower and upper houses by 
May this year.

Ingushetia and North Ossetia" -- ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA headline] 
  [Text] We Federation Council deputies, concerned with the 
quest for a peaceful solution to the protracted conflict between 
Russians living in the Ingush Republic and the Republic of North 
Ossetia, urge the Ossetians, Ingush, and representatives of all 
nationalities living in these republics to lay down their 
weapons and resolve the problems that have built up over a long 
period by peaceful means. 
  Stop, people! Brothers! Fathers! Men and sons! Give your 
land peace! Give your mothers, sisters, and daughters peace! 
Give your peoples a chance to be constructive! The mountain 
people have always been respected for their wisdom, honesty, 
dignity, and tolerance. You have lived side by side and 
together found a way out of the most difficult of situations 
while respecting one another. Have the mountain people really 
lost these qualities today? 
  We appeal to the women of Ingushetia and North Ossetia. 
Mothers! We ask you to hold your sons back from the awful brink 
of going on with interethnic war. There have been enough wars 
and devastation! There have been enough tears and suffering! 
Your land can no longer bear so much pain. It will curse 
everyone who sheds people's blood. 
  We appeal to you, veterans! Esteemed wise veterans! You 
traveled the terrible roads of the Great Patriotic War under 
fire. You drained the cup of grief. You have learned the wisdom 
of life. So stand up straight and bar the way to a war that may 
destroy the land of your forebears and annihilate your sons! 
  We appeal to the clergy, to all believers. God gave all 
people the same right to life. And no one has a right to 
violate the main commandment in the Koran and the Bible -- do 
not kill! Help cool hot heads and calm people's hearts. It is 
time to start the work of mutual reconciliation and forgiveness, 
remembering that it is not they who are to blame for this 
tragedy but the totalitarian Stalinist regime and politicians of 
various stamps. It is intolerable for ancient peoples to still 
be political hostages. You cannot live in the past. There has 
been enough destruction. You must revive and construct your 
homeland. And everyone needs peace to do that. 
  Peoples of Ingushetia and North Ossetia! We believe in your 
wisdom and common sense. We support you in the cause of 
reconciliation and construction.

<F P=106> [Report by Raimonda Rameliene: "Foreign Affairs Committee </F>
Complains of Information Shortage"] 
  [Excerpts] "Work in our committee could be much more 
flexible, and we could achieve better results if we received 
more information from persons who construct foreign policy at 
the President's Office and the Foreign Ministry," stated Foreign 
Affairs Committee Chairman K. Bobelis at yesterday's press 
conference in the Seimas [parliament], speaking about the work 
of its Foreign Affairs Committee. He regretted the failure to 
execute the Seimas resolution, adopted back in December, 
authorizing the Foreign Ministry to prepare a foreign policy 
concept and cooperate with the Foreign Affairs Committee in the 
closest possible manner. There is also a lack of cooperation 
with the president's "foreign policy design" office which 
provides no information at all. K. Bobelis said that "members 
of the committee do not approve of the isolationist policy 
conducted by J. Paleckis [presidential foreign policy adviser]. 
The information deficit evokes unnecessary differences of 
opinion in the committee. 
  K. Bobelis said that the committee was currently considering 
a number of international agreements that would be submitted to 
the Seimas for ratification. The free trade agreement with the 
European Union that is being prepared by four ministries is of 
particular importance. The Foreign Affairs Committee has not 
yet seen the draft of this document. 
  According to K. Bobelis, the committee approves of President 
A. Brazauskas' initiative to set up a Baltic Council of 
Ministers for cooperation between the Baltics and the 
Scandinavian countries according to the formula 3 + 5. At the 
same time, the speaker expressed his regret that even though 
both the Swedes and the Danes with whom he has talked welcome 
this idea, they believe that Lithuania is still to immature to 
undertake such an endeavor. "Everyone looks at us as an inferior 
and underdeveloped state. I do not know why," admitted K. 
Bobelis. 
  The committee chairman reported that Lithuania would shortly 
open its embassies in China, Japan, and Egypt, and later in 
Canada. Discussions are continuing on whether an embassy or a 
consulate should be opened in Turkey. The committee believes 
that consulates in Kaliningrad and Seinai [Polish border town] 
must be set up immediately. 
  Asked whether he had a chance to read the Lithuanian-Polish 
treaty, K. Bobelis replied that he saw the latest version before 
taking it to Warsaw. "This document is beneficial for Lithuania 
and it does not inflict any harm." However, the committee 
chairman does not approve of the Foreign Ministry's position not 
to show the treaty. [passage omitted] 
  Summing up the work of Lithuanian politicians at 
international organizations, K. Bobelis said that they should 
participate both in the EC and UN structures more actively. 
Moreover, it is necessary to preserve the continuity of 
political activities, in other words, to create possibilities 
for members of the delegations to work a longer period of time 
rather than just one year. In K. Bobelis' opinion, as long as 
the current situation continues, casual participations in 
international events will be nothing but trips and a waste of 
money.

  [Text] The Lithuanian Government has adopted a decision to 
join the agreement on patent cooperation signed on 19 June 1970 
in Washington. As of 11 March this year, there were 67 states 
that are members of this agreement. 
  By joining this agreement, Lithuania will have to upgrade 
its 
rules of patent preparation and its system of classification and 
appraisal. From now on, information about patents issued by the 
Lithuanian State Patent Bureau will be provided to the 
headquarters of the patent cooperation agreement in Geneva. The 
State Patent Bureau will work mostly with foreigners who seek 
protection for their technological innovations on Lithuania's 
territory.

<F P=106> [Report by Raimonda Rameliene: "Litas' Exchange Rate Will </F>
Be Set by Lobbyists"] 
  [Text] Following a longer break, V. Landsbergis, leader of 
the right-wing opposition, held a press conference at the Seimas 
[parliament] yesterday. He spoke not about politics but about 
economic and financial issues which, in his opinion, were almost 
forgotten by journalists who became fascinated with the recent 
sensations. The speaker commented on two new laws adopted by 
the Seimas -- on the litas' viability and land which were 
"accompanied" by statements from the Homeland Union (Lithuanian 
Conservatives). 
  According to the professor, the news that international 
organizations and banks are suspending credits for Lithuania 
could mean that "the Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party [LDDP] 
has run into a deadlock." Thus, the perspective, certainly, if 
it is not changed by some political decisions, looks quite 
somber: Being deprived of Western credits, the LDDP may resolve 
to borrow from Moscow. Incidentally, "Russia has indirectly 
sucked in the large part of all loans received by Lithuania 
until now, because credits have been extended for enterprises 
which produce goods for the Russian market and sell them at 
lower prices." This way, Russia has received additional 
assistance from the West through Lithuania. "Later on, Russia 
will probably buy Lithuania for Western credits." 
  Since the litas' exchange rate will be determined by the 
government from now on, the gate for corruption will become even 
wider. The conservatives' statement reads that "seeing the 
corrupt goals of the LDDP government, such a monetary policy 
when LDDP leaders will be able to agree on the litas' exchange 
rate in advance will develop into hard currency speculations 
among a "group of comrades" by profiting from other businessmen 
and bankers who are not "comrades" and who will have no access 
to the party money market or will have to yield to the monopoly 
of LDDP banks despite their wishes." V. Landsbergis specified 
that the "litas exchange rate will be set by lobbyists who have 
access to the president." He also reported that the opposition 
was planning to appeal the law on land to the Constitutional 
Court. It would even request to review this issue as a priority 
(certainly, after the president's decision). 
  Asked whether the Homeland Union would support the 
nationalists' proposal to hold elections to the Seimas and 
self-governments in fall, V. Landsbergis replied: "Homeland 
Union's definite position is that the Seimas elections should be 
held simultaneously with the elections to self-governments. 
There may be different ways to achieve this. Thus far, 
preparations for a possible referendum have been under way." He 
also added that in a normal democratic state, such a bankrupt 
government as the Lithuanian one would itself express the desire 
for early elections and announce them. 
  Asked about his expectations concerning the meeting of the 
three presidents in Palanga, the professor replied that he 
wished A. Brazauskas would warn the Latvian and Estonian 
presidents against engaging in any discussions on occupation and 
annexation, which Russia wants to impose as an issue worthy of 
attention. "We have Russia's recognition and the condemnation 
of that annexation. The Lithuanian president has a good chance 
to remind his colleagues that they could follow Lithuania's 
agreement with Russia because the situation is absolutely 
identical," said V. Landsbergis.

  [Text] The newspaper Narodnoye Slovo, official organ of 
Uzbekistan's Supreme Soviet and Cabinet of Ministers, sharply 
criticized the idea of Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev to 
create a Euro-Asian Union. The article headed "Spring. 
Restless politician is gambling" says, in particular, that the 
words "Euro-Asian Union" are "for simpletons." 
  "Uzbekistan is still to grow up to Europe's level where the 
states can allow such an extravagance -- unification without the 
fear to appear under a foreign dictatorship," said the article. 
  In the opinion of the author, there exists a real threat to 
appear under an alien dictatorship in the post-Soviet time. The 
article underlined that "the essence of the idea to create the 
Euro-Asian Union is the same -- to revive the former Soviet 
Union and this cannot be assessed in any other way but as a pure 
delirium." 
  This publication in the official press is the first reaction 
of the Republic towards Nazarbayev's initiative. The article 
was handed over to the newspaper by the national information 
agency.

<F P=106> ["Text" of a letter from President Husni Mubarak to </F>
President Geydar Aliyev; date not given, read by announcer] 
  [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, and compassionate. 
President Geydar Aliyev, I have received your letter of 14 
January 1994. You focused significant attention on bilateral 
relations and the perspectives and opportunities for cooperation 
between our two countries in various fields to benefit our 
peoples. Our people have been bound together by historic and 
cultural ties, which have helped [words indistinct] flourish. 
  Egypt contributes toward the effort made to establish a just 
and durable peace in the Middle East. It also contributes to 
the effort made to establish peace in the Caucasus. We regard 
as our guidelines the principles that the occupation of 
territories through the use of force is inadmissible, that 
territorial integrity must be respected, and that international 
relations must be maintained in a peaceful way and in accordance 
with the UN Charter's principles and objectives. 
  Egypt has closely followed the dispute in Daghlyk Karabakh. 
It has condemned the occupation of Azerbaijan's territory 
through the use of force and called for the complete withdrawal 
of Armenia's occupying forces. Egypt has outlined on various 
platforms that it approves of the international effort aimed at 
ending the dispute and supports the CSCE Minsk Group's 
initiatives, which are in line with the UN Security Council 
resolutions. 
  Egypt hopes that the destructive war will end and financial 
resources will be channeled toward maintaining the effort to 
realize economic reform. That complies with the region's 
interests. 
  Mr. President, I am truly very happy to have been invited to 
visit Azerbaijan. I am pleased to invite you to visit Egypt. 
The date of the visit will be established through diplomatic 
channels. 
  I conclude by wishing progress and happiness to Azerbaijan's 
peaceful people. I also wish you sound health and happiness.

satisfaction with the results of their meetings with

  Asked about a meeting between Azerbaijanian, Armenian 
parliamentaries and representatives of Nagorno-Karabakh slated 
to be held in Bishkek next May, Sherimkulov said, "it is 
premature to say whether the meeting will differ from other 
meetings in principle. If it takes place, it will be held at due 
level, and major interests of all the parties will be taken into 
account." 
  The delegation flew in Yerevan on the same day to meet with 
members of the presidium and deputies of the Armenian Supreme 
Soviet (parliament). 
  According to Parliament Speaker Babken Ararktsyan, "a new 
constructive approach to the Nagorno-Karabakh problem is 
beginning to show in Russia's initiatives." 
  One can hardly overvaluate the significance of Russian 
initiatives, he noted. The involvement of the CIS 
Interparliamentary Assembly will contribute to a peaceful 
solution of this problem. 
  Ararktsyan confirmed that the Bishkek meeting between the 
parties involved in the conflict would take place. 
  The delegation is to meet with Armenian President Levon 
Ter-Petrosyan on Friday night and to leave Yerevan for 
Stepanakert in the morning on Saturday.

  [Text] Baku (April 2) TURAN -- Yesterday there was the 
session in Nakhichevan Supreme Majlis. Natiq Gasanov, was 
appointed a new Chairman of Supreme Majlis of Nakhichevan 
Autonomous Republic. Earlier he was the chief of the 
Administrative Department of Supreme Majlis. The Chairman of 
Supreme Soviet of Azerbaijan, Rasul Guliyev, attended the 
session as well. 
  Since June 1993, when the former speaker of Nakhichevan's 
Supreme Majlis, Geydar Aliyev, took the office of the President 
of Azerbaijan, the post of the speaker in Nakhichevan remained 
vacant. 
  The tension in Nakhichevan mounts. There were a series of 
rallies of the members of the opposition in Ordubadskiy and 
Dzhulfinskiy region. The local powers of those regions support 
Abulfaz Elchibey. 
  Deepening socio-economic crisis in Azerbaijan lessen Baku's 
control over Nakhichevan. Obviously, after the elections 
Azerbaijan will increase pressure on Nakhichevan.

  [Text] The Government of Azerbaijan intends to sack the 
National Bank chairman, Galib Agayev, "because of his failure to 
conduct monetary and crediting policy satisfactorily and observe 
the existing banking legislation." As Interfax learned from the 
chairman of the standing governmental commission for economic 
policy, Tofik Azizov, the issue of Agayev's resignation has been 
submitted to Azerbaijan's president. 
  In March a special governmental commission checked up the 
work of the National Bank, as a result of which gross violations 
of legislation on banking activity were revealed, he said. For 
instance, Azizov stressed, throughout last year the National 
Bank issued credits totalling 292 billion rubles, and 
subsequently sold those funds as credit resources, 
notwithstanding the fact that they had not returned from 
circulation yet. This brought about unfounded credit emission, 
which, in its turn, caused higher inflation, Azizov concluded. 
  Last year the level of inflation made up 1080 percent, and 
in 
the first two months of the current year 200 percent. The 
national monetary unit, manat, was put into circulation in 
August of 1992, however in 1993 the National Bank made 
settlements only in Russian rubles. 
  The chairman of the governmental commission also said that 
last September, on instructions from Agayev, the National Bank 
closed all the correspondent accounts of local commercial banks. 
Such an action, Azizov pointed out, considerably complicated 
interbank settlements as well as settlements with foreign 
countries, CIS members among them. 
  According to Azizov, the ill-advised policy pursued by the 
National Bank chairman brought about debt claims presented to 
Azerbaijan by a number of countries, including Russia -- for 
81.5 million dollars, Kazakhstan -- for 6 million dollars and 
Turkmenistan -- for 9 million dollars, and resulted in 
"unprecedented bribery on the part of commercial banks during 
the receiving of cash, as well as in the forming of another 
circle of monetary circulation which is beyond the National 
Bank's control."

  [Text] Yerevan, April 4 (SNARK)--Levon Zurabyan, acting 
press-secretary of the Armenian president declared today 
Armenian-Iranian relations are still normal. Iranian Government 
hasn't apply any sanctions on Armenia, despite the recent 
declaration of Iranian Foreign Ministry, blaming Armenia for the 
crash of the plain C-130 in Karabakh, said Mr. Zurabyan at a 
briefing in Yerevan. He mentioned the incident hasn't influence 
on the whole the relations between Armenia and Iran. 
  At the same time, he reported that the Iranian commission of 
experts and a similar commission from CIS, having a mandate from 
UN haven't made any official conclusion on the reasons of the 
air-crash. 
  According to the available data the plane's flight through 
the territory of Azerbaijan and Karabakh lasted 15 minutes more 
than it should be by the schedule. 
  All the communication with the plane was interrupted after 
it 
had appeared in the air-space of the Azerbaijani airport Ganja. 
Its flight was hence controlled by the Azerbaijani Air-Defence 
forces. 
  All this data is given to the Iranian side, said Mr. 
Zurabyan.

  [Text] Yerevan April 4 TASS -- Armenia has agreed to stop 
hostilities in the disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, but put 
forward several conditions. 
  Those include the disengagement of the warring sides, the 
deployment of peace-keeping troops and observers in the 
demilitarised zone, equal participation of Nagorno-Karabakh in 
the settlement process and recognition it as "one of the warring 
sides." 
  The announcement was made by Armenian Presidential Spokesman 
Levon Zurabyan on Monday. 
  Zurabyan said that Azerbaijan is the only country which 
"does 
not want to reconcile with the political reality -- the 
existence of Nagorno-Karabakh." "Azerbaijan must recognise this 
reality, sit down at the negotiation table with Nagorno-Karabakh 
as Moldova did with the Dniester region and Georgia with South 
Ossetia," he said.

the concept at the heart of the (?Russian) peace plan and CSCE 
program for a settlement to the Karabakh conflict, which 
envisages discussion of Nagorno Karabakh's status after a

withdrawal by forces from occupied territory, the acting press 
secretary for the Armenian president, Zurabyan, told a briefing 
in Yerevan. 
  He said that Azerbaijan also agrees to this approach, but at 
the same time is not recognizing Nagorno Karabakh as an equal 
party in the negotiations and thus not accepting the political 
[word indistinct]. Zurabyan stressed that Armenia believes that 
the CIS can considerably influence a Karabakh settlement. The 
best guarantee of peace in Karabakh will be troops and observers 
to supervise demarcation, who should be deployed in the conflict 
zone.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The Country's Concern for the </F>
Citizen and the Citizen's Concern for the Country. The First 
Congress of the Union of Georgia's Citizens"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] On 18 March, the first 
congress of the Union of Georgia's Citizens [UGC] was opened 
ceremoniously by the eminent Georgian scientist Aleksandr 
Javakhishvili in the large concert hall in the Tbilisi 
Philharmonic building. [passage omitted] 
  The congress outlined concrete tasks aimed at bringing the 
country out of the political and economic crisis and an action 
program. In particular, great attention was devoted to 
questions regarding privatization, the development of 
entrepreneurship, the improvement of the taxation system, and 
the boosting of industry and agriculture. 
  The union adopted a program document and rules. 
  The attention of the deputies was focused on the problem of 
Abkhazia. Zurab Erkvania, Zaur Chanchibadze, Vakhtang Kobalia, 
and others delivered speeches during examination of this 
question. It was said that the UGC, unlike other political 
organizations, had assumed responsibility for the country's 
fate. "In this Union, we see a strong organizational force for 
the return of Abkhazia. No further state development in Georgia 
is possible while the Abkhazian question remains unresolved." 
The speakers gave a positive assessment of the decisions 
adopted by the Georgian authorities regarding Abkhazia and their 
attempt to regulate Russian-Georgian relations. [passage 
omitted] 
  Head of State Eduard Shevardnadze delivered a long speech at 
the congress. Then, elections were held. 
  By secret ballot, the congress's delegates elected Eduard 
Shevardnadze as chairman of the Union. 
  Zurab Zhvania was elected its general secretary, Gia 
Zhorzholiani speaker of the consultative body, and Revaz 
Chkheidze chairman of the auditing commission. 
  The congress elected members of the auditing commission, the 
Union's main council, and its consultative body. 
  The UGC once more confirmed that its ideology was evident 
from its name. The country's concern for the citizen and the 
citizen's concern for the country is the guarantee for the 
political, social, and economic strength of Georgia.

<F P=106> [Letter from Jaba Ioseliani, head of the Georgian delegation </F>
at the Geneva negotiations on the Abkhazian conflict, to UN 
Security Council Chairman Jean-Bernard Merimee (name as 
published); place and date not given: "To Batoni (Georgian 
polite form of address) Jean-Bernard Merimee"] 
  [Text] Dear Mr. Chairman! 
  First of all, I would like to express my gratitude for the 
big contribution that you are making to the matter of the 
peaceful settlement of the conflict in Abkhazia. 
  I note with great satisfaction the extremely objective and 
constructive character of your speech. It clearly points out 
those counteractions that are hindering the achievement of 
substantial progress at the Geneva negotiations, which is the 
fault of the Gudauta grouping. 
  I would like to emphasize that this grouping does not want 
to 
see a successful conclusion to the Geneva negotiations and, 
primarily, the introduction of UN troops into the region, which 
should ensure the dignified and safe return of refugees and 
displaced persons to their homes. The separatists want to 
maintain the existing situation and transform the democratic 
structure, which has been changed by force, into an irreversible 
phenomenon. I would like to point out also that, if we need UN 
troops to ensure the security of the refugees and displaced 
persons, the aim of the Gudauta grouping is to use them to 
violate the territorial integrity of Georgia and camouflage the 
filtration of refugees and displaced persons. 
  It was pointed out at the session of the Security Council 
that the introduction of UN troops into the region and the 
return of refugees and displaced persons are interrelated issues 
and humanity demands that these problems be resolved in the 
shortest period of time. It is also significant that, in its 
Resolution 901 of 4 March 1994, the Security Council requests 
that the secretary general submit to the Council by 21 March a 
report on "any progress" achieved at the Geneva negotiations and 
on the existing situation in the area, with particular attention 
paid to those circumstances that could be used as a basis for 
the deployment of peacekeeping troops, and on the forms for the 
creation of these troops (Paragraph 2; there is an English text). 
  We believe that, in accordance with existing rules, in order 
to deploy these troops, both the agreement of the two sides and 
the achievement of progress at the talks are necessary. 
  In the memorandum on mutual understanding and the 
communique, 
both sides involved in the conflict request that the UN 
introduce peacekeeping troops. Thus, the first condition has 
been satisfied. 
  As regards the second condition, the situation here, as you 
know, is very complex: What can be considered as "any progress" 
on the path toward a full-scale settlement?! 
  At the third round of negotiations held in Geneva and New 
York, two documents were the focus of attention: The joint 
statement and the quadrilateral agreement on the voluntary 
return of refugees and displaced persons. 
  We believe that the point that stipulates the creation of a 
standing committee for the elaboration of proposals on the 
political and legal status of Abkhazia is of particular 
significance. 
  In order to guarantee the preservation of both the 
distinctiveness of a small nation and Abkhazia's statehood, we 
are ready to give them the following rights: 
  1. The territorial supremacy of Abkhazia's state power (or 
the impossibility of changing the territory of Abkhazia without 
its agreement). 
  2. The right to have its own constitution. 
  3. The right to have its own state language (or languages). 
  4. The right to have its own state symbols. 
  5. Representation in the highest body of state power in the 
Republic of Georgia. 
  6. Respect for the rights of the entire multinational 
population of Abkhazia. 
  7. Broad local self-administration. 
  Apart from the aforementioned, we are ready to guarantee the 
possibility of Abkhazia's self-organization within specific 
limits in accordance with the Republic of Georgia Constitution 
and the Law on Abkhazia, which implies: 
  1. The right to determine its own system of supreme and 
local state bodies; 
  2. The right to determine its own administrative and 
territorial division; 
  3. The right to have its own legislation; 
  4. The right of legislative initiative in the Republic of 
Georgia's supreme state bodies; 
  In order to raise Abkhazia's political and legal status and 
impart real and specific substance to its jurisdiction, we are 
ready to implement the division of the objects and powers of 
administration between the supreme state bodies of the Republic 
of Georgia and Abkhazia, for which purpose the following has to 
be determined: 
  1. Abkhazia's exclusive jurisdiction; 
  2. The Republic of Georgia's exclusive jurisdiction; 
  3. Joint jurisdiction. 
  The list of specific objects appertaining to each of these 
points will be determined during the course of the negotiations. 
We support the maximum expansion of both the jurisdiction of 
Abkhazia and the joint jurisdiction of the center and Abkhazia 
within the limits established by world constitutional practice. 
  As regards the mechanism for legitimizing the agreements 
adopted on the division of the objects and powers of 
administration, I believe this should be implemented by means of 
a law on Abkhazia. I think this law should be adopted either by 
a special constituent body created by the sides involved in the 
conflict or by the whole population of Abkhazia in a referendum 
and then approved by the Georgian Parliament. 
  In order to ensure the protection and implementation of the 
adopted agreements, it is desirable to have international 
guarantees from the UN and the CSCE. 
  As regards the agreement on refugees and displaced persons, 
the provision that is being proposed to us by the Abkhazian side 
is unacceptable since it prohibits a large number of the 
refugees from returning home peacefully. Almost all family 
members have been fighting with weapons in their hands for the 
territorial integrity of their motherland. Many of them belong 
to armed formations even today. However, all of them are 
awaiting a peaceful settlement of the conflict and are ready to 
lay down their weapons and return peacefully to their native 
homes. 
  The groundless demand of the Abkhazian separatists was 
rejected by the Security Council that, in its Resolution 896 
(1994), recognizes the right of the refugees and displaced 
persons to return without "any prior conditions." 
  Hence, the Geneva negotiations were deadlocked on account of 
the position adopted by the Gudauta grouping. In our view, UN 
troops should be deployed in Abkhazia immediately and talks on 
the organized return of refugees continued. Otherwise, hundreds 
of thousands of desperate people will spontaneously enter the 
region, which will make it impossible to preserve peace. 
  The deployment of UN troops in Abkhazia will bring about a 
change in the atmosphere of anarchy and terror and will force 
the separatists to fulfill the obligations that are recognized 
on the basis of the memorandum and communique. All these 
formations and people who entered the region to take part in the 
armed conflict should be disarmed and expelled. 
  In this way, taking into account these views, we consider it 
possible to return once more to a discussion of both documents 
but, if the Abkhazian side again wrecks the conclusion of the 
quadrilateral agreement, of the two variants of the joint 
statement proposed by us, one should be enough for the adoption 
of the decision on the deployment of UN troops by the Security 
Council. 
  As regards the assertion by representatives of the Abkhazian 
side that the decree adopted by the Georgian Parliament on 10 
March of this year has ostensibly hindered the continuation of 
the process of negotiations, this does not correspond to the 
truth. I would like to explain that Point 2 of this decree 
states that the Supreme Soviet of the Abkhazian Autonomous 
Soviet Socialist Republic in its present composition has been 
disbanded, without referring to Abkhazia's autonomous statehood 
as such. We have always conducted negotiations (and will 
continue to do so) with our opponents from Gudauta in their 
capacity as a side that is participating de facto in the 
conflict and not as the legitimate power in Abkhazia. This 
cannot be otherwise as a body of power, in whose work exactly 
half (32) of the 64 elected deputies have not been participating 
for almost two years now and are resident outside its borders, 
cannot be viewed as being legal. All the more so as, owing to 
the quotas established by an apartheid electoral law, it is 
precisely that half of the deputies who have been banished that 
represents the largest part of the Abkhazian population -- 
300,000 people, whereas the other half can be viewed as 
representing at best the 160,000 inhabitants left in Abkhazia 
(30 percent of the prewar population). 
  There is no time to be lost. Mr. Chairman, what is needed is 
a swift response. It is now clear to everyone that local hot 
spots and aggressive separatism are bringing us to all-out war. 
I hope that you will take into account the arguments outlined 
above and will do everything to ensure a peaceful end to the 
conflict in the shortest possible time.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent] </F>
  [Text] Moscow April 4 TASS -- The Georgian-Abkhazian 
agreements signed in Moscow on Monday are regarded by diplomats 
as the initial real attempt to begin political settement of the 
long-drawn regional conflict. The agreements open an 
opportunity for the stationing of U.N. peacekeeping forces in 
the region. Still, an appropriate decision of the U.N. Security 
Council is required for this, experts believe. 
  The problem of refugees return will be resolved in stages, 
ITAR-TASS learned. At initial stages, refugees will return to 
places of their permanent residence in Galiy District. 
According to diplomatic circles close to the Georgian 
delegation, the question of refugees return to Sukhumi and Gagry 
is not yet raised. This problem is to be solved at future 
negotiations. 
  The agreements do not apply to refugees who participated in 
hostilities against the Abkhazian side. This provision has been 
included in the document on Abkhazia's insistence, but in a 
milder form then intially planned, according to the same sources. 
  Another important point of agreements invisages 
consultations

  [Text] Georgia's chief negotiator at the talks with 
Abkhazia, Jaba Ioseliani, declared upon his return to Tbilisi 
from the Georgian-Abkhazi line of confrontation Thursday night 
that it is time "to do away with the situation where Georgian 
militiamen are in the hiding out in the zone of the conflict." 
"It is war time now, and those who evade their duty, primarily 
youth and refugees, must be expelled from Georgia," he stressed. 
  In his words, "a critical situation has come about" in the 
Kodor gorge. Georgia's Defence Ministry has "taken no steps to 
help the local residents, whose squad numbers only 150 men," he 
said. "The militiamen lack weapons, most of them are untrained 
soldiers, however, despite that, they have been holding the 
gorge and have been resisting the nearly 2000-men-strong Abkhazi 
unit mainly thanks to the mountainous terrain," Ioseliani noted. 
  On the incident in parliament on March 31 and a rally of 
advocates of the late ex-president Gamsakhurdia, he declared 
that "he was shocked by the site." "What rallies can be held 
and what birthdays of the traitor-president can be celebrated 
today? All his followers should be isolated, and that will be 
done to restore order to the country without law, where everyone 
does as he pleases", Ioseliani emphasized.

  [Text] On 1 April, the Supreme Soviet Presidium held a 
session chaired by Mechyslaw Hryb. The session discussed 
questions related to the election of the Belarusian president. 
A. Abramovich, chairman of the internal [as received] electoral 
commission, presented a report to the session. A resolution on 
organizing measures for preparing and holding presidential 
elections was adopted. The Cabinet of Ministers as well as 
executive committees of oblast councils were charged with the 
task of immediately securing facilities, equipment, 
transportation, and means of communication, which are necessary 
for the normal work of electoral commissions. The Ministry of 
Culture and Publishing should publish within a 10-day period a 
mass edition of a brochure with the law on presidential 
elections. The media founded with the participation of state 
bodies, organizations, and institutions, as well as the media 
partly sponsored by the state, were instructed to provide 
presidential candidates with equal access for electoral 
addresses and to widely inform the public about the electoral 
campaign. In order to handle the organizational problems 
emerging during the preparation for the presidential elections, 
a working group was created, for which Vyacheslav Kuznyatsow, 
first deputy chairman of the Supreme Soviet, was appointed head. 
The Supreme Soviet Presidium approved the proposals of the 
Cabinet of Ministers to appoint Deputy Prime Minister Syarhey 
Linh as minister of economy of the Republic of Belarus; 
Alyaksandr Stalyarow as chairman of the State Committee for 
Broadcasting; Anatol Butevich as minister of culture and 
publishing; and A. Darafeyew as minister of natural resources 
and environmental protection. Other issues were also discussed.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Andrey Varlamov] </F>
  [Text] Tokyo 2 April, TASS -- President Nursultan 
Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan is of the opinion that a Euro-Asian 
Union (EAU) which he suggests and which, in his view, could be 
more effective than the structure of the Commonwealth of 
Independent States (CIS), should be patterned after the European 
Community. Nazarbayev said this in an interview given in Alma 
Ata [Almaty] to the Japanese newspaper MAINICHI on the eve of 
his forthcoming official visit to Tokyo. The visit begins on 6 
April. 
  The EAU idea, MAINICHI quotes Nazarbayev as saying, is based 
on the recognition of only full membership of states, with each 
of them undertaking to abide by jointly adopted decisions. 
  "More than 300 joint documents have been adopted over the 
period of the CIS existence. However, no results are seen, 
because a number of states partially reject some of them, 
interpreting the contents of agreements in their own interests," 
Nazarbayev explained. 
  Touching upon his forthcoming trip to Japan, the president 
of 
Kazakhstan emphasised that he intends to discuss aid to people 
who suffered from nuclear tests in the area of Semipalatinsk and 
expects a positive response from the Japanese leadership. 
  In addition, Nazarbayev is to call on Japan to take an 
active 
part in a Kazakhstan-suggested international conference on the 
fate of the Aral Sea, a likely disappearance of which threatens 
with a tremendous damage to the environment, and not only to 
that of the Republic.

  [Text] Russia's first payment to Kazakhstan for the 
Baykonur cosmodrome will be $1.25 Bn (the size of Kazakhstan's 
debt to Russia -- INTERFAX). This fact was disclosed at a 
Monday news conference in Alma-Ata [Almaty] by the Kazakh Deputy 
Prime Minister for Science Galym Abilsiitov. 
  He said Russia will also pay a monthly rent of $115 Mn 
partly 
in cash and partly through mutual settlements. 
  Abilsiitov said the head of administration in Leninsk where 
the cosmodrome staff lives will be appointed jointly by the 
presidents of the two countries and the chief of the cosmodrome 
by the Russian head of state with the consent of his Kazakh 
counterpart. A special envoy of the Kazakh president is 
supposed to be present at the cosmodrome. 
  Abilsiitov said that Kazakhstan and Russia should work out 
the contract on the cosmodrome in three months. The Kazakh 
government shall act as lessor and the Russian as lessee. 
Abilsiitov will head the Kazakh side of the commission. In his 
opinion the work has only begun and will be quite difficult. 
  The deputy prime minister also said that the national 
aerospace agency will be moved to Leninsk from Alma-Ata. 
  Commenting on Abilsiitov's statement one of the drafters of 
the agreement on Baykonur told INTERFAX that the size of 
compensation for the use of the facility has not been approved, 
while under the agreement it should not exceed the size of 
Kazakhstan's debt to Russia. He said he could not understand 
what compensation can be in question, "as Russia has actually 
covered all the spending on the maintenance of the cosmodrome 
alone." In his opinion, "if Russia had stopped spending on 
Baykonur two years ago, there would have been nothing to rent 
today."

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Demidetskiy] </F>
  [Text] Chisinau 5 April, TASS -- A round of talks begins in 
Chisinau today between Russia and Moldova on the status and 
withdrawal of the Russian 14th Army from Moldovan Territory. 
  According to observers, this round is unlikely to produce a 
breakthrough because the sides differ too much on this issue. 
Chisinau insists on the prompt withdrawal of the Russian troops, 
while Russia and Transdniestria believe that the withdrawal must 
be conditioned on granting a special legal status to the 
left-bank regions of Moldova. The final say should belong to 
the parties concerned. 
  "The Russian delegation intends to discuss an agreement on 
the legal status, procedure and the time table of the presence 
of our troops on Moldovan territory. We have brought along a 
number of interesting proposals and hope that the Moldovan 
delegation will heed them," the Russian delegation head, 
ambassador at large, Vladimir Kitayev told ITAR-TASS. 
  "Chisinau's position with regard to the 14th Army remains 
the 
same -- it must leave the Republic," said Moldovan delegation 
leader, the ambassador of Moldova to Russia, Anatoliy Tsaran. 
This question will be central in our negotiations. The 
original deadline named by the Moldovan side for the withdrawal 
of the Russian Army -- 1 July 1994 -- will certainly need 
revising since no agreement on it was reached during the 
preceding rounds. 
  "We also hope to agree on the problems of jurisdiction and 
property of the Russian Army and Moldova's contribution to the 
necessary arrangements for its accommodation in the new area", 
the Moldovan ambassador said. 
  Anatoliy Tsaran expressed the hope that the Transdniestrian 
position with regard to the withdrawal of the 14th Army will not 
be as tough as before after the recent parliamentary elections 
in Moldova. 
  Transdniestria's Vice-President Aleksandr Karaman told 
ITAR-TASS that Tiraspol objects to the withdrawal of the Russian 
14th Army before the Dniester problem is settled. 
  "Chisinau and Tiraspol are now studying the Russian 
proposals 
about granting a special legal status to the left-bank regions. 
We find these proposals highly constructive," Karaman said. "We 
have long since proposed to Chisinau to make the republic a 
demilitarised zone and disband military formations on the both 
banks of the Dnepr. This move would ease the tension in the 
region and permit the withdrawal of the 14th Army from Moldovan 
territory without apprehension," he said.

<F P=106> [Responses by Russian President Boris Yeltsin to written </F>
questions from Pilar Bonet; date, place not given: "I Will 
Leave Russia in Safe Hands"] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [Bonet] Is the political system 
of the republic set out in the new Constitution a transition 
model or is it designed to be a permanent solution tied to the 
specific conditions of Russia? 
  [Yeltsin] The processes developing in Russia today cannot be 
considered as having been "defused." The changes are coming 
thick and fast, and in these conditions it is difficult to make 
any long- term predictions. Moreover, with the adoption of the 
new Constitution we have determined the basis and the main 
parameters for the development of the political system for the 
next 10 or 15 years. Despite the various and even contradictory 
points of view of the new parties and political blocks, we are 
seeing increasingly clearly the formation of a national 
consensus based around a strong power. This is a response as 
much to historical tradition arising out of the dimensions of 
the state itself and the complex national make-up of society as 
to the needs of the current stage of transition from 
totalitarianism to democracy. Naturally, a strong power does 
not mean unlimited power, a lack of control, or 
authoritarianism. Moreover, the arbiter and supreme guarantor 
of the free development of Russia will be the expression of 
popular will, in democratic elections. 
  [Bonet] If you do not stand at the 1996 elections, what 
guarantees are there that a strong presidential power will not 
end up in the hands of a person with authoritarian or even 
neofascist tendencies? 
  [Yeltsin] For me it is not a problem of whether I stay or 
go. 
The problem is leaving Russia in safe and democratic hands. 
These hands must be capable of holding Russia's helm steady in 
a stormy sea. I believe that one of my main accomplishments by 
1996 will have been to create the guarantee that prevents the 
country from falling into totalitarianism. 
  [Bonet] What are the conditions enabling the president and 
the new Russian parliament to maintain constructive relations? 
  [Yeltsin] It is necessary, firstly, to have political 
maturity in the main state institutions. There is no cure for 
the lack of a political culture -- we need time. However, there 
are already good foundations for cooperation between the 
president and the parliament: the new Constitution stabilizes 
the principle of a clear division of powers. I also believe 
that we will learn our lesson from the dramatic outcome of the 
events of 3 and 4 October last year (the storming of the Russian 
parliament -- LA REPUBBLICA editor's note). For my part, I have 
already learned the lesson and am in favor of dialogue and 
cooperation. Our shared duty is to isolate the extremist forces 
in parliament. 
  [Bonet] How do you intend to dissipate the growing fears in 
the countries of eastern Europe, including the former Soviet 
republics, faced with the dangers arising from the advancement 
of the radical nationalists in Russia? 
  [Yeltsin] These fears are unfounded. Russia cannot be 
transformed into a flourishing and stable country if it is a 
threat to its neighbors. If we had other intentions or ulterior 
motives we would not have withdrawn our troops. We had 
sufficient possibilities for staying put. Unfortunately, the 
politicians in the various countries are artificially 
exaggerating their fears and have brought a rain of complaints 
down on the international organizations. In general, these fake 
concerns hide concrete economic and political calculations -- 
for example, obtaining rapid integration into NATO or using the 
scare tactics of the "Russian threat" in their internal 
struggles for power. Those who speculate on Russia's return to 
an imperialist doctrine are basing their fears merely on 
statements made by specific political extremists who are far 
from being able to formulate our country's foreign policy. 
  [Bonet] What is the state of relations between Russia and 
Ukraine? 
  [Yeltsin] Relations with Ukraine are complex. Its 
independence has posed many difficult problems. However, I am 
not going to dramatize the situation. We need to be less 
emotionally involved and take fewer hasty decisions. History 
cannot be undone: economic, social, demographic, and cultural 
needs will in time do the work that is impossible for 
politicians to do. I can see the prospect of a deep, 
multilateral integration, simply because there is no other 
solution. I am also convinced that we will manage to find a 
solution to the problem of the Black Sea Fleet based on the 
formula drawn up in Massandra at my meeting with President 
Kravchuk. 
  [Bonet] Is the Atlantic Alliance the best-suited collective 
security system for Russia? If so, why has Moscow not asked for 
membership of the organization? If it is not, what is the best 
system? 
  [Yeltsin] For decades, NATO has guaranteed security in West 
Europe at a time when there was a severe East-West confrontation 
between totalitarianism and democracy. However, at the same 
time, no one can ignore the radical changes that took place in 
Europe after the triumph of the democratic tendencies in Russia. 
It is uncomfortable to pretend that we are sitting in a chair 
that no longer exists. Today Russia does not threaten the world 
or Europe. In these conditions, it is counterproductive to 
retain intact a powerless system directed toward stiff 
opposition with the enemy. We must find new security formulae 
based, naturally, on the fact that NATO has useful experience 
and institutions that must be put to the best use. Russia must 
be able to participate in the same conditions and with the same 
security guarantees. We have ceased being rivals but we must 
learn how to be partners. The mechanical enlargement of the 
block with specific countries can only revive old fears and 
suspicions. 
  [Bonet] How do you think the countries of the West can 
contribute to supporting democracy and benefiting the success of 
economic reform in Russia? 
  [Yeltsin] We have gone through a phase of overoptimism. On 
the one hand, we ourselves overestimated the possibilities 
offered by the West, which today is experiencing difficult 
economic times and does not want to take any risks. Secondly, 
it is now clear that no one can really help Russia, given its 
economic contradictions and its specific characteristics 
inherited from the socialist regime. Our task today consists of 
creating normal economic and legal conditions for major 
investment. However, now is also the time that the West should 
stop feeling as a donator to Russia, and should start behaving 
like a clear-thinking businessman acting in his own interests. 
Russia must become one of the most profitable places in the 
world for capital investment. 
  [Bonet] Why until now has the fight against corruption in 
Russia yielded no results? 
  [Yeltsin] We must not look at things as if corruption were a 
specifically Russian phenomenon. Even in the most democratic 
country, there are those who profit from their positions as 
state employees, and wealthy people trying to profit from the 
greed of the civil servants for their own ends. We fight 
against this as we fight against any other type of crime or 
antisocial activity. However, in a number of cases the 
corruption has taken on threatening dimensions in Russia. We 
must not rely on the state being able to defeat them using 
solely repressive means. Just a short time ago, I signed a 
decree on state service that should serve to create an 
unfavorable social climate for corruption. We also need to 
create a system of social and material guarantees for state 
employees that give them a suitable standard of living and that 
then frees them from the need to look for other ways in. In 
short, we must try and create the conditions in which it will no 
longer be profitable for them to safely agree to corruption.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>
  [Text] Moscow April 4 TASS -- Spokesman of the Russian 
president Vyacheslav Kostikov denounced former Vice-President 
Aleksandr Rutskoy for becoming a "mouthpiece" of extremists "who 
try to kill the sprouts of civic accord" in Russia. 
  "The mourning ceremonies were used for the sake of rude 
historical falsification", Kostikov said in a statement on 
Monday referring to opposition rallies held over the weekend to 
mark the six-month anniversary of the October 3-4 armed revolt. 
  "People who had nearly unleashed a civil war in Russia, 
including the recently freed rebels, tried to pose for innocent 
victims, moreover, for judges accusing the president", Kostikov 
said. 
  Hopes that the amnesty to anti-Yeltsin rebels would sober 
them up do not come true, according to Kostikov. "In this 
connection it is especially urgent to consolidate all sound 
political forces around the unifying idea of the agreement on 
civic accord. Extremism must be stopped", the statement reads.

in the Federal Assembly too, and there will be such on the 
streets and squares. 
  It is essential to seek civil accord by all possible means 
which exist in society. There have been enough attempts to 
"rock the boat." Otherwise the future of Russia, the future of 
our people, will be jeopardized. Unless we try to halt 
political emotions now, we are threatened with a repetition of 
the sorry and tragic experience of Georgia and Tajikistan, where 
blood is now being shed. Preventing bloodshed -- that is the 
main aim of the conclusion of civil accord. 
  It is finally time our society realized and considered what 
happened 3 and 4 October. Those to blame for those events, 
those who called for violence, are now acting almost as judges. 
God forbid that an inversion should take place in public 
awareness whereby the innocent are called the guilty and the 
guilty avoid trial. That is dangerous for the moral climate of 
society. The guilty must be punished individually, they cannot 
be allowed to turn into defenders of justice. There is a kind 
of dialectic under way -- the combination of appeals for peace 
and accord on the one hand and on the other the refusal to 
accept under the slogan of accord those who want to live in a 
normal society, a society of civil accord.

  [Text] Today Russian President Boris Yeltsin met 
representatives of the Russia's Choice faction in the Kremlin. 
Russia's Choice leader, Yegor Gaydar, told Interfax that issues 
on domestic policies and the situation in different regions had 
been discussed during the meeting. 
  Russia's Choice representatives informed Yeltsin about 
difficulties linked to legislative activities in the State Duma. 
They said from the point of view of legislation the State Duma's 
activities were not as yet efficient. The issue concerning 
coordination of the work of the president and deputies in order 
to make the State Duma more efficient was also discussed during 
the meeting. 
  Yeltsin stressed that he shared the political position of 
the 
Russia's Choice Party and that he would closely cooperate with 
it. 
  Gaydar said that Yeltsin also stated that Russia's Choice 
was 
the party on which he would back in his activities. However, 
Yeltsin emphasized that this did not mean that he would ignore 
positions of other factions and public organizations. 
  Gaydar announced that Yeltsin would try to find contacts 
with 
other Russian political forces since he was the president of all 
Russians, and would meet representatives of other parties and 
blocs in order to work out mutually beneficial decisions and to 
achieve accord in society. 
  The Russian president's press service said Yeltsin was 
satisfied with the good productive relations he had with State 
Duma Speaker, Ivan Rybkin.

  [Text] Vyacheslav Marychev, elected to the Russian State 
Duma on the party ticket of Liberal-Democrats, has been expelled 
from the party. This was reported to the press on Monday by 
Marychev himself. He said he was notified by the party leader 
Vladimir Zhirinovsky just before the 5th congress of 
Liberal-Democrats held in Moscow last Saturday. He also said 
that security guards did not let him into the Central Tourists' 
House where the congress was held even though the convention was 
open to everyone. 
  Marychev said his expulsion had been caused by a number of 
speeches in which he actively resisted the so-called imperative 
mandate being given to party groups. It would give groups the 
right to strip members of the State Duma elected on party 
tickets of their mandates. 
  During a visit to St.Petersburg before the congress 
Zhirinovsky repeatedly declared that Marychev who used to lead 
the local branch of the Liberal-Democratic Party accepted 
bribes, in particular from Russia's Choice, for making 
statements directed against the leader. 
  Marychev said he was ready to sue Zhirinovsky for libel if 
the conflict is not settled. However, in reply to a question 
from Interfax he said he was not disappointed in Zhirinovsky as 
a person. He said he still considers the party leader a talented 
politician. 
  The decision of the congress to make Zhirinovsky the party 
chairman till 2004 and grant him absolute power between 
congresses contradicts party rules, said Marychev. 
  Members of the State Duma Vyacheslav Marychev, Viktor 
Kobelev 
and Alexander Pronin expelled by Zhirinovsky from the 
Liberal-Democratic Party are planning to hold a news conference 
at the State Duma on Wednesday.

  [Text] Moscow April 4 TASS -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin met with Acting Chief Justice Nikolay Vitruk on Monday 
to discuss the draft law on the Russian Constitutional Court 
finalised by a conciliatory commission. 
  The commission included members of the State Duma Committee 
for Legislation and Judicial Reform, presidential 
representatives in the parliament, experts from the presidential 
state and law department and Constitutional Court judges. 
  Yeltsin gave a positive assessment to the work done, noting 
that no one who could have done it better than the 
Constitutional Court. He stressed that from the very outset he 
had considered disputes about the Constitutional Court's right 
to initiate legislation as groundless. 
  Yeltsin told Vitruk that he will instruct his representative 
in the State Duma to convey his assessment and proposals to the 
deputies. 
  The president and Vitruk also discussed candidates for 
judges 
in the Constitutional Court. Yeltsin regretted that the 
suggested list practically does not represent subjects of the 
federation. 
  He stressed that the final list to be approved by the 
Federation Council, upper house of Russia's new parliament, can 
be submitted only after the adoption of the law on the 
Constitutional Court which will determine the requirements for 
judges, including age limit, terms of office and others.

  [Text] Moscow April 4 TASS -- Architect of Russian reform 
Yegor Gaydar and ultra-nationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy 
have signalled the beginning of the presidential race over the 
weekend thus marking two different poles in the campaign. 
  On Friday Gaydar announced the creation of a pro-Yeltsin 
party -- the "Russia's Choice", while Zhirinovskiy was confirmed 
as a presidential candidate by the congress of his Liberal 
Democratic Party held on Saturday under the motto "LDPR to 
Power". 
  Gaydar is representing the democratic-reformist movement, 
while Zhirinovskiy -- the "neoimperial" one. 
  The space between them is occupied by all other politicians 
-- moderate reformer Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, supporter of Russian 
regions Sergey Shakhray, former Vice-President Aleksandr Rutskoy 
and communist Gennadiy Zyuganov. 
  However, Boris Yeltsin may himself join the race if he sees 
no worthy successor. He said that in an interview to the 
Spanish "EL PAIS" newspaper. 
  The outcome of the two-year long presidential race depends 
mostly on the results of economic policy of the president and 
the government. Gaydar clearly understands that and lists three 
priorities of the economic programme -- tax reform, investments 
into economy and legal guarantees of private property. 
  Zhirinovskiy's main ideas is to protect Russians in the CIS 
and Slavs in the world at any cost, to restore Russian borders 
of 1975 and create a one-party government. He complained that 
Yeltsin is now dealing only with the Russia's Choice and ignores 
the Liberal Democratic Party which came first in December 
parliamentary elections. 
  It is not a secret that the president prefers the "Russia's 
Choice" and this puts additional responsibility on the party. 
It has to learn lessons from the last election campaign when it 
lost to Zhirinovskiy despite all predictions of a landslide 
victory. 
  Democrats then only limited themselves to general 
discussions 
on TV, but failed to create grass-root organisations across the 
country and offer concrete economic measures to improve life. 
It seems that Gaydar is well aware of the mistakes and realises 
that hard everyday work is necessary to ensure success in 1996.

<F P=106> [Sergey Chugayev article: "When Choosing Between Reforms </F>
and Power, Politicians Usually Choose Power"] 
  [Text] Last week's statement by the president's press 
secretary that B. Yeltsin might participate in the next 
elections for head of state not as a voter but as a contender 
has sparked a succession of statements from prominent 
politicians that they have no ambitions for the presidency. F. 
Fedorov and V. Chernomyrdin, in particular, have told the public 
so. 
  Meanwhile, at Saturday's fifth congress of the LDPR [Liberal 
Democratic Party of Russia] V. Zhirinovskiy was declared as the 
party's presidential election candidate. At the same time, the 
Liberal Democrat chairman received virtually unlimited powers 
from his comrades in arms and now has the opportunity to 
personally decide all party problems, including those which are 
the exclusive responsibility of the congress. "When we say the 
leader we mean the party, and when we say the party we mean the 
leader," V. Zhirinovskiy stated. 
  The LDPR congress graphically demonstrated that a vigorous 
aggressive political force is rapidly taking shape in Russia and 
that the opposition's main problem, as a result of which it has 
constantly been defeated in the struggle against the president, 
seems to have been resolved. And this in turn is creating the 
preconditions for attracting into the LDPR's orbit not only an 
increasing number of rank-and-file supporters but also 
additional social groups and political movements. The presence 
of V. Achalov, who recently left Lefortovo, on the congress 
platform and of A. Lukyanov and Sterligov on the platform of the 
Congress of Slav Peoples is ample illustration of this. In 
brief, the congress slogan "The LDPR -- Heading for Power" 
should be taken extremely seriously. 
  The political situation currently developing in Russia is 
beginning to increasingly resemble the situation which existed 
in the USSR in mid-1991. Now, following the adoption of the new 
Constitution, the president has finally moved from being a 
leader of the populist, democratic type to being the leader of 
the nomenklatura. He has become this both in his 
(constitutional) capacity as head of state and in his (de facto) 
capacity as head of the executive. But, despite everything, the 
state apparatus remains the most powerful political and economic 
force alike in our country. Thus, the president does not need 
his own party, talk about which is now into its second year. If 
B. Yeltsin enters the next elections, he will do so as the 
leader of the party of the nomenklatura. And it is no 
coincidence that the main theme of his message to parliament was 
the problem of strengthening the state. And the steps we are now 
seeing to strengthen and bolster the state apparatus are the 
logical continuation of his report. 
  But it is at this point that an inevitable contradiction 
arises. The more powerful the state nomenklatura, the greater 
its leader's apparent chance of winning the election. But the 
strengthening of the nomenklatura constrains a civil society, 
which in this situation is bound to move across to opposition to 
it. You see, as we all remember, B. Yeltsin won precisely as 
the leader of the anti-nomenklatura opposition, and on the road 
to victory he had to pursue a policy aimed at weakening the 
nomenklatura and, as a consequence, weakening the state machine. 
  Furthermore, since in our country the state is still more 
powerful than civil society, it is the head of state who bears 
the responsibility for the state of affairs in the country, and 
first and foremost the state of the economy. And although it is 
well known that the state of the Russian economy reflects the 
state of society as a whole and is largely independent of the 
president and that the present crisis is inevitable, and that 
one of the main reasons for it is Russia's shortage of skilled 
cadres capable of working actively in market conditions, it is 
nevertheless B. Yeltsin who will have to carry the can. 
  The greatest likelihood, therefore, is that unless there 
are some real changes for the better in the country's economy 
before the next presidential elections, B. Yeltsin will find 
himself in the same situation as M. Gorbachev in 1989-1991, 
while a rival will find himself where B. Yeltsin was at that 
time, since his future rival will speak out against the state 
machine, which, furthermore, is much weaker than it was under 
the first president of the USSR. This is another reason why the 
hints from the top echelons of power that they will not allow an 
undesirable figure to come to power look somewhat unconvincing. 
Just how can you prevent the legitimate winner of presidential 
elections coming to power? Another attempted putsch? There is 
little reason to believe that if such an attempt failed in 1991, 
when the putschists had all the power of the empire available, 
it would be successful now. 
  By announcing through his press secretary the possibility 
that he might participate in the next presidential elections B. 
Yeltsin has put himself in a pretty difficult position. On the 
one hand, the intensification of nomenklatura power lessens his 
chances of winning the election. But on the other, the 
weakening of this power leads to the weakening of his party. 
The president therefore has an extremely difficult task to 
resolve: How to regain the status of a political leader while 
also remaining the leader of the nomenklatura. There appears to 
be only one possible solution: Going into the elections as 
leader of all the democratic movements while at the same time 
gambling not on strengthening the state but on reducing the 
state apparatus to the optimum size, democratizing it, bringing 
the apparatus into line with the requirements of a market 
economy and the new conditions taking shape in the regions, and 
reforming local self-government (including the holding of 
elections of leaders of local administrations). That is, 
following the path of strengthening a specifically democratic 
state, which means strengthening those state institutions which 
are based on a civil society. 
  At the same time the developments currently taking place in 
the state apparatus provide grounds for concluding that what we 
can see there is, on the contrary, an intensification of the 
trend toward restoring the administrative system which existed 
in Russia for decades -- a rigidly centralized executive 
hierarchy. But in general this is natural if you consider that 
state apparatus cadres consist mainly of members of the party 
and soviet nomenklatura. They have moved up from the number 
three or number four jobs to the top jobs. But their psychology 
and mentality are still the same. There is a perfectly obvious 
desire to transform the President's Administration into an 
analog of the CPSU Central Committee and recreate an 
administrative model of the Central Committee-oblast 
committee-rayon committee type, relying in the regions on 
governors linked tightly to the center. 
  This model is already beginning to come into conflict with 
Russia's embryonic civil society. Maritime Kray Governor Ye. 
Nazdratenko fired the legally elected mayor of Vladivostok. 
Soon after this, Mayor D. Bednyakov of Nizhniy Novgorod, who 
had every chance of making the transition from an appointed to 
an elected mayor, found himself removed from his post. The head 
of St. Petersburg is demanding Moscow's permission to put 
military patrols on the streets. Here they all invoke the need 
to establish iron discipline. 
  All the indications are that the state apparatus is 
approaching the limit of its potential for simultaneously 
resolving -- as it has been doing these past two years -- the 
two tasks of implementing reforms (taking account of its own 
interests, of course) and strengthening its own power. The 
contradictions are becoming unsurmountable, and a choice has to 
be made: reforms or power. Taking account of the fate of all 
Russian reforms this century -- Stolypin's, the New Economic 
Policy, Khrushchev's -- it is not hard to guess what the choice 
will be.

<F P=106> [Interview with Sergey Stepashin, director of the Federal </F>
Counterintelligence Service, by Aleksandr Gamov and Vladimir 
Murashkin; date and place not given: "Sergey Stepashin: We 
Have Caught, Are Catching, and Will Continue to Catch Spies. 
New Lubyanka Boss Gives KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA His First 
Interview"] 
  [Text] [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] Sergey Vadimovich, whenever 
the special services were mentioned in the past, people would 
first recall the spies which our agents had caught. Now the 
concept of "economic security" has entered the vocabulary. To 
what extent is this area a priority for the Foreign 
Counterintelligence Service [FCS]? 
  [Stepashin] Well, first, we have been catching spies and we 
will continue to do so -- we are tasked with that function by 
the statute on our service published 30 March in ROSSIYSKAYA 
GAZETA and ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI. Incidentally, I wrote to Sergey 
Aleksandrovich Filatov, the leader of the Presidential 
Administration, asking him to remove the "for official use" 
classification from the document and have it published in the 
press. People should know what we do. 
  We tackled economic security issues in the past as well, but 
this applied more to security measures at defense enterprises, 
nuclear power stations, and other strategic installations. All 
that remains, but, at the same time, new areas have emerged. In 
general, many departments should safeguard economic security, as 
should the "producers" themselves -- the banks, say. We are 
looking at our participation in this from the standpoint of 
combating corruption in financial, lending, and banking 
structures, other state and commercial organizations, and 
various investment funds. Moreover, we are helping the Central 
Bank of Russia to carry out credit and other operations, and 
major enterprises to conclude contracts with foreign firms. 
  Economic security issues account for two of the FCS' five 
basic directorates. To be blunt, it is quite an important force. 
  [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] Doesn't it strike you that the threat 
to our economy today comes not so much from abroad as from 
inside the country -- a proposition which was raised quite 
recently? 
  [Stepashin] Indeed, in the past the economic security issue 
was interpreted one-sidedly -- that is, it was linked solely to 
external factors. I am thinking of the restrictive policy of 
the industrially developed states and the IMF, which placed bans 
on lending to the USSR, on the supply of goods and advanced 
technology, and so forth. 
  Domestic factors helping to undermine the economy were not 
profoundly studied or were often simply hushed up. But their 
destructive effect on all spheres of the national economy has 
been far greater in scale and longer-term. Society has suffered 
immense damage, for instance, from the denial on ideological 
grounds of the existence of a corruption problem in the top 
echelons of party and state power, or of the presence in the 
country of a ramified black market system. 
  Today the impact of internal "time bombs" undermining the 
economy has not only not been halted but is actually growing 
stronger. Just take the problem of economic ties. In my view, 
this is now the main destabilizing factor. 
  Needless to say, the main role in preventing these threats 
is 
played by the top organs of state power -- the government and 
its structures -- since they are the people who shape economic 
policy and define the mechanism for its implementation. As for 
FCS subunits, we see our task -- along with those already 
mentioned -- as being to ensure that top state administrative 
organs have accurate and timely information on negative trends 
in basic sectors and spheres of the national economy and on 
emergencies, and to provide forecasts of the possible 
consequences. 
  [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] Does this mean that the FCS is now 
mainly just a forecasting and analysis body? 
  [Stepashin] No, of course not. Counterintelligence 
operatives are above all men of action. And if the discussion 
of our work to safeguard Russia's economic security were to 
continue, I could mention a lot of specific cases. Because of 
space constraints in your newspaper I will quote just a few of 
the most typical. 
  In the course of the joint "Trawl" operation with organs of 
the Ministry of Internal Affairs [MVD], the Customs, and the 
Prosecutor's Office, our territorial subunits managed to uncover 
around 270 criminal structures specializing in the illegal 
export of strategic raw materials and licensed products. In 
total over the past year we have put a stop to more than 1,200 
such illegal acts, giving rise to almost 300 criminal cases. 
The illegal export from the Russian Federation of more than 
636,000 tonnes of oil and oil products, 100,000-odd tonnes of 
metals -- including 44,000 tonnes of nonferrous and rare-earth 
metals -- as well as timber, lumber, and other products worth 
around 150 billion rubles [R] in total has been prevented. 
  Federal security organs conducted the "Barrier" operation at 
16 airports around the country and put a stop to the illegal 
export from Russia by air of more than 400 kg of electronic 
components containing gold, around 30 kg of gold and silver 
bars, as well as 237 cutting tools with diamonds of up to two 
carats worth R58 million. 
  As a result of the measures taken on the basis of 
information 
supplied by FCS organs more than 400 major disasters and the 
preconditions for them were successfully prevented in 1993 -- 
including 54 at nuclear power generating installations. 
  Incidentally, a great many examples could be quoted of 
Russian slackness, waste, and blatant stealing from the country. 
And work in this area is terra incognita for our 
counterintelligence agents. 
  [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] Does this mean that we are harming 
ourselves and that the West is just helping us? 
  [Stepashin] Things are not that simple. Foreign firms, 
exploiting the situation in our country, are striving to expand 
scientific and technical links with Russia to their own 
advantage. They are trying to organize an intensive outflow of 
Russian scientific ideas, high technology, and advanced arms and 
military equipment systems. 
  In the United States, France, Germany, Brazil, Israel, 
China, 
and South Korea these actions are supported at state level. We 
know that the range of theoretical and practical scientific 
results in Russia that are of interest to foreigners extends to 
space and aviation equipment, biotechnology, new materials, 
nuclear physics, laser equipment, metallurgy, and high-tech and 
defense sectors of industry. 
  Information reaching the Russian FCS on this problem shows 
that in the very near future our country could lose its leading 
position in the development of basic and applied research, be 
deprived of many scientific schools and highly qualified cadres, 
and suffer considerable and essentially irreparable material 
damage. Calculations done by specialists from the Russian 
Federation Ministry of Science and Technology Policy using UN 
methods show that the country loses around $300,000 for every 
specialist that goes abroad. Russia could suffer potential 
damage of around $20 billion annually through emigration. 
  [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] Sergey Vadimovich, could you describe 
the work of the Western special services to safeguard their 
countries' economic security? 
  [Stepashin] The United States devotes a great deal of 
attention to strengthening the activity of counterintelligence 
organs in preserving and strengthening America's leading 
position militarily and economically. In the Americans' 
opinion, the strategic threats to U.S. interests persist under 
present-day conditions. In this connection intelligence 
community experts are pointing out that Russia and the other CIS 
countries are still the priority targets for the special 
services. 
  Moreover, insofar as we are aware, the intelligence 
community 
is fully tasked with the function of economic counterespionage 
-- and the special services are being told to be "more 
aggressive" when conducting counterintelligence operations. 
  According to the available information, the special services 
of the East European countries are also becoming an important 
tool in implementing their leaderships' "eastern" policy. Their 
priority effort is concentrated on infiltrating leading 
structures in the CIS states in order to obtain not only 
economic but military and political information. 
  We know that special organs from the East European states 
are in close contact with the NATO special services, which give 
them financial, material, and technical support. 
  [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] According to calculations by 
specialists, several tens of billions of dollars are taken out 
of Russia every year. Can't this outflow of foreign exchange be 
sealed off? 
  [Stepashin] Of course it can -- but not only and not so much 
with the help of the special services. In this area we have to 
work in conjunction with the tax service, the tax police, the 
MVD, and the Customs. We plan to set up several such joint 
groupings under the auspices of the Prosecutor's Office. But 
this is not enough. Our administrative law and code of criminal 
procedure have long become obsolete, and we are working under 
the conditions of the former political and economic system. We 
have plenty of material, but we cannot act on it. The facts we 
have to hand are not being used for investigations -- much less 
for instituting criminal proceedings and court cases. 
  [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] What about simply legalizing activity 
that is currently deemed criminal? Maybe then our "dealers" 
would not send their dollars abroad? 
  [Stepashin] Far too much has been legalized as it is! And 
money is going abroad because of the unstable political 
situation. Many people are scared to invest their capital here 
-- they fear for their future. Moreover, some of the radical 
opposition is gripped with the idea of the expropriation of the 
expropriators, and the experience of 1917 is not such ancient 
history for them. Consequently, it is only when we have a normal 
political atmosphere that we can talk about stopping the flight 
of capital. Needless to say, I do not choose people who are 
indifferent to the interests of our country and its people. 
These people have always been with us, are with us, and always 
will be -- and if they commit crimes they need to be combated, 
using special service methods if necessary. 
  [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] We talk so much about corruption! 
You get the feeling that we are on top of it, when the opposite 
is true.... 
  [Stepashin] This phenomenon has been brought about primarily 
by the current position in the economy and by the lack of 
legislation on the civil service. We are discussing corruption, 
but from the standpoint of the criminal code the subject of our 
complaints essentially does not exist. We do not have any 
clear-cut framework to guide civil servants*at all levels -- up 
to and including government members -- about what they are 
forbidden to do and what they are responsible for. That is why 
people are lobbying for the most fantastic agreements. 
  Exploiting their important position, certain officials are 
making approaches to foreign firms, selling them our 
enterprises' products at considerably reduced prices, and taking 
bribes in return. The most interesting point is that most 
corrupt people do not think of themselves as such -- they claim 
to be just entrepreneurs. We are currently investigating the 
"Neftalmazinvest" Foundation. High-ranking officials from the 
State Committee for the Management of State Property are 
involved in this major affair. 
  There is a very alarming situation with oil. It is currently 
monopolized by several structures. This strategic raw material 
is going abroad without any controls. Ukraine has not paid 
Russia for oil received throughout all of last year and the year 
before, and it is still receiving oil. Who took how many bribes 
for that? Why are products with different octane ratings 
flowing through the same pipeline? 
  In other words, corruption now affects many of the most 
important spheres -- privatization, the credit and financial 
sphere, banking, investment and foreign economic activity.... 
According to available information, the degree to which the 
economy has been affected by this "bacillus" is quite 
considerable and is continuing to increase rapidly. 
  [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] Sergey Vadimovich, be frank -- do you 
believe your work will be successful (I am thinking of the fight 
against corruption)? 
  [Stepashin] If everything depended on us alone.... Today 
you can often hear voices claiming that the FCS should be 
disbanded -- with one directorate being given to the Finance 
Ministry, another to the Justice Ministry, and so forth. You 
get the impression that people either don't know what the 
Finance and Justice Ministries do, or they are deliberately 
raising the question of scrapping the FCS. 
  This talk is coming up now that we have started active 
work, particularly in opposing foreign stations. We now have 
very serious approaches to a number of economic structures and 
have once again gone on the attack. Certain newspapers 
specialize directly in this. There are no prizes for guessing 
that there are people who find counterintelligence a big problem 
when it gets "too close" to them and their machinations. 
  And this is not just a question of the foreign "agents of 
influence" to whom we often refer. Some of our 
pseudocampaigners for democracy and justice are also attacking 
the special services. And these actions are deliberate and by no 
means the fruit of a sick fantasy run riot in the spring. 
  I would like to recall the words of Boris Nikolayevich 
Yeltsin during our recent meeting -- Russia, the state, and the 
president need a strong special service that can work 
effectively in all areas. 
  [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] But won't the FCS, in actively 
dealing with economic security, leave other "sections of the 
front" exposed? 
  [Stepashin] No, that is ruled out. Everyone does his own 
job. For instance, this year we have already arrested British 
and German spies, and we caught them "clean" -- in other words, 
red-handed. The other day we also caught red-handed three 
staffers from the North Korean Embassy attempting to buy 
state-of-the-art technology, as well as a BND (FRG intelligence) 
agent trying to recruit a Russian officer in the Western Group 
of Forces. Of course, such results raise the morale of 
counterintelligence officers and enhance their sense of their 
own worth. Military counterintelligence has become more active. 
We are recording many recruitment approaches from the German 
special services to the contingent of Russian troops being 
withdrawn from Germany. 
  Means have also now been taken to improve the work of our 
information and analysis subunits. In the last two weeks alone 
we have sent the president 25 analytical materials on a wide 
range of security problems -- including "hot" spots, foreign 
special services' aspirations, and economic issues.... 
  [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] Can the reorganization of the special 
service responsible for the state's security now be said to be 
complete? 
  [Stepashin] I think so. The fundamental reform has been 
completed, but we will be constantly improving our structure. 
  [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] What is the renewed profile of the 
Lubyanka now? 
  [Stepashin] We have gotten rid of certain militia functions 
-- put it that way -- which are alien to the special service. 
We have also lost the Border Guards and our investigative 
subunits. We have somewhat reduced our central apparatus -- 
particularly our administrative apparatus -- and changed our 
organizational and staffing structure. The FCS has become more 
compact. 
  I should note that these reorganizations did not begin 
solely 
as a result of the president's edict -- they were a call of the 
times. Back in September 1993 we independently started 
reforming the Security Ministry. The Russian president then 
received the first note from the Security Ministry Collegium, in 
which we proposed a number of new approaches. These were 
subsequently implemented in the 5 January 1994 presidential 
edict setting up the Russian Federation FCS. 
  We have completely recertificated our staff -- from 
operatives to the deputy director of the FCS. But we have not 
carried out any kind of "purge" -- much less one for political 
motives. Certain workers were dismissed for being 
professionally unsuited to the job, while some have left for 
reasons of age and other reasons. I think that what we are left 
with are the best -- at least from the standpoint of 
understanding the need to conscientiously serve the fatherland.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Vasilyev report: "Peasant's Right To Choose"] </F>
  [Text] V. Khlystun, Russian minister of agriculture and 
food, held a news conference Thursday [31 March] on the results 
of a government presidium session which examined, in addition to 
other matters, the draft program for agrarian reform in 
1994-1995. 
  The presidium approved the draft program and instructed 
interested ministries and departments to finalize it in due 
course and submit it to the Federal Assembly for final 
ratification. The program assesses the results of the first 
stages of agrarian reform involving the transformation of 
property relations with regard to ownership of land and the 
means of production and the reorganization of agricultural 
enterprises. A considerable proportion of the program is 
devoted to the development of a market infrastructure with 
wholesale markets, market information, and everything necessary 
for a multisectoral agrarian economy. A mechanism is also 
envisaged to provide agricultural producers with state support. 
  An important part of the program is the introduction of a 
civilized land market, which will enable the owner of a plot of 
land to sell it and a buyer to purchase it. But, the minister 
stressed, this cannot totally escape state regulation. Nowhere 
in the world is there a land market without certain 
restrictions. And Russia has them too. 
  First: Agricultural land must not be taken out of 
agricultural use as a result of a sale and cannot be used for 
other purposes. Second: A maximum area is established for a 
plot of land that a physical person can privately own. Third: 
Agricultural land can be acquired only by a person who has the 
ability and opportunity to work the land himself, predominantly 
by using his family, and who lives in the given area.

  [Text] Tokyo April 5 TASS -- One dollar will be exchanged 
for approximately 10,000 rubles by the end in the year in 
Russia, and the pace of inflation will heighten considerably 
unless the Russian Government takes appropriate measures, Boris 
Fedorov, chairman of the parliamentary subcommittee on the 
monetary policy and the activity of the Central Bank of Russia, 
former Russian finance minister, told ITAR-TASS. Today he left 
Japan where he was staying for several days at the invitation of 
the Japanese foreign minister in the composition of the "Union 
of December 12" group of deputies. 
  Fedorov said that due to the lowering of the rate of 
inflation in Russia to 9.8 per cent in February and 8 per cent 
in March, the Russian Government now has a unique chance to 
bring inflation under control and complete successful efforts of 
many months for financial stabilisation. The Cabinet of 
Ministers now has an opportunity to capitalise on the emergent 
results on the policy pursued by the previous government", 
Fedorov said. "However, the Chernomyrdin government has not 
taken in the three and a half months a single step that could be 
described as that of a reformer cabinet, and this gives rise to 
concern". 
  If the present government continues to adhere to this stand, 
the roll back form the economic milestones reached will become 
inevitable in the weeks ahead", Fedorov believes. He said that 
the initial sign of this will be the granting of large subsidies 
to state-owned enterprises and the allocation of approximately 
3,000 billion rubles to agricultural enterprises planned for 
April. This step will thwart the opportunity of making in 
Russia the most painless financial stabilisation in world 
history, the opportunity which is real now, Fedorov said. 
  Fedorov expressed the opinion that the Chernomyrdin 
government may remain in office no longer than autumn of this 
year unless it switches from a passive policy to an active 
course at reform. "If the cabinet does not take real actions by 
autumn, the government will be at least reshuffled", the former 
Russian finance minister said. He expressed the readiness to 
enter a cabinet again if the necessary powers are granted.

have no money to buy fuel and carry out maintenance work 
although they are highly profitable, TASS was told on Tuesday by 
Vladimir Kashkin, chairman of the strike committee which 
organised a protest action at the Russian Government building on 
Tuesday. "If the problem is not solved the nuclear power plants 
will simply shut down", he warned. Three-month delays in wage 
payments are also a reason of the protest, although not the 
major one, according to Kashkin. 
  "Our objective is to be heard by the government. A special 
meeting is necessary on problems of nuclear and fuel 
production", said Kashkin who is also deputy chairman of the 
trade union of nuclear industry workers. 
  After the Chernobyl catastrophe nuclear reactors had to be 
modernised, however the lack of finances stalled the work. "We 
know too well what this is fraught with", Kashkin said. The 
government reportedly owes the indstry 600 billion roubles. 
  Some 60 people from eight nuclear power plants are picketing 
the government building instead of expected 150.

<F P=106> [Article by Anatoliy Belousov: "Military Councils Change </F>
Work Style. What Is New About It?"] 
  [Excerpts] Military councils have always existed. Or, at 
least, they have existed since the olden days. In all wars, 
there have always been occasions when military leaders have 
deemed it necessary to submit their plans for upcoming battles 
for discussion with their commanders. But right until the 
17-19th centuries, commanders and commanders-in-chief only 
convened military councils occasionally. Remember, for example, 
the famous military council convened by M.I. Kutuzov in Fili 
[village outside Moscow] in 1812. [passage omitted] 
  In accordance with the Russian Federation president's edict 
dated 1 September 1993, which ratifies the Statute on Military 
Councils, these have been given the status of permanently 
operating consultative organs. They are formed in the Armed 
Forces, the Border Guard, Internal, and Railroad Troops, and 
government communications troops. In addition to commanders of 
the relevant formations, whose deputies belong to the councils 
ex officio, and also other officials from organs of military 
administration, the Russian Federation president includes 
representatives of state structures in them. 
  One of the main tasks of the present-day military councils 
is 
to elaborate recommendations in spheres such as maintaining the 
troops in combat and mobilization readiness, strengthening 
organization and discipline, and the selection and placing of 
personnel. But after all, even in the past these questions were 
frequently reviewed at sittings of military councils. So what 
has changed? Let us look at practice. 
  The Strategic Missile Forces which, incidentally, started to 
elaborate a state-of-the-art concept of the activity of military 
councils even before the decree currently in force was issued, 
carefully analyzed their work in formations, and then turned to 
the archives and discovered an interesting detail. The same 
shortcomings were revealed as had existed three, five, and even 
10 years ago. The basic spheres of the work of the military 
councils in the operational echelon were determined from above 
by circulars. The standard set of mandatory questions moved 
from one plan to the next, and decrees were adopted on them. 
But the main point is that when attempts were made to find 
traces of their practical implementation in the relevant 
services, these were not discovered. That is, the same 
"collective responsibility" stamped its mark on everything -- in 
reality, collective irresponsibility. 
  In order to break the vicious circle, the attitude to the 
planning of the military councils' work needed to be changed 
first and foremost. Of course, programmed areas of the troops' 
activity exist, and their examination may be recommended from 
above. But the main point is that the commander, like the 
chairman of the military council, should have a free hand, 
because he knows his formation's problems better than other 
people do. 
  The actual sittings, the majority of which are visiting 
sittings, have also started being prepared in a new way. They 
are held directly in divisions and units. Practical studies on 
the questions being discussed are being conducted in parallel 
with commanders and chiefs of services. Urgent measures to back 
up combat training and the troops' vital activity are also 
adopted on the spot. 
  But it is known that even the best decisions may remain on 
paper only if a mechanism for their implementation is not worked 
out. That is why the orders and directives being issued on the 
results of the work of military councils and being sent to the 
appropriate services and Strategic Missile Forces directorates 
also contain provisions enabling the adopted decisions to be 
implemented. 
  A constructive attitude to work is also characteristic of 
the 
military council of the Ground Forces. Let us take the problem 
of protecting the lives and health of the personnel. The 
measures being adopted in the troops have made it possible to 
reduce the number of injuries among the personnel by 39 percent 
last year, and the number of deaths by 28 percent. However, the 
military council was not satisfied with this. At its recent 
sitting, it elaborated specific recommendations for the 
accident-free use of equipment and weapons in order to reduce 
injuries to people. The question of ensuring the safekeeping of 
weapons and ammunition, which is directly linked to this, was 
also examined. With the great shortage of manpower, there has 
been reliance upon the more intensive commissioning of security 
equipment and facilities at military installations and weapons 
dumps. 
  However, military councils' tasks in the present conditions 
are not just limited to internal problems in the troops. Every 
military formation is stationed on the administrative territory 
of a specific republic or kray, and the implementation of 
Russian Federation normative acts and the social and legal 
protection of the servicemen depends in many respects on how 
well the work of the military councils with the local 
authorities is organized. Measures such as the organization of 
the defense of the territories, the region's communications, 
mobilization, and the draft to military service, and military 
training courses cannot be resolved by either local authorities 
or military formations on their own. And what about strictly 
everyday questions?! A kray or oblast counts on the military's 
assistance in the gathering of the harvest, and the latter, for 
their part, ask for housing to be subsidized.... The list of 
problems which must be resolved by both is long, but the whole 
question is how resolvable they are at all amid the current 
shortage of everything -- both for the military and for the 
local authorities. 
  Nevertheless, it turns out that if the will is there you can 
achieve a lot. The activity of the military councils of the 
Moscow, Volga, North Caucasus, Urals, and certain other 
[military] districts confirms this. The coordinated work of the 
councils with the organs of representative and executive power, 
as well as -- and this is also very important -- good personal 
contacts, make it possible to settle a lot of vitally important 
questions. This is not just limited to mutual services, if you 
can put it like that: We give you apartments, you give us a 
work force. Concern for invalids and veterans of war and labor, 
the establishment of ties of sponsorship between enterprises and 
military units, the military-patriotic education of young people 
-- these things are classed as state-level. 
  Of course it is six months since the military councils have 
been working the new way, which is not a very long period of 
time, but it seems that this is long enough for the first shoots 
of the new work to be seen. Experience suggests that a military 
council should specifically be a council of the military, as it 
was conceived at the very beginning. As such it will raise the 
prestige of the commander and will make it possible for his 
personality to be revealed, and it will strengthen the positions 
of one-man command. As such it will be in a position to 
elaborate genuinely necessary recommendations on all important 
spheres, ranging from the practical implementation of military 
policy in the troops and fleets, to ordinary everyday concerns.

  [Text] The Liberal Democratic Party of Russia and its 
faction in the parliament unequivocally oppose Russia signing 
NATO's Partnership for Peace [PFP] program, the party's leader 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy declared during his meeting with the 
adviser of the Canadian Embassy to Moscow Ferry de Kerckhove van 
der Varent [name as received] on Friday [1 April], held at the 
request of the diplomat, reported the press service of the LDPR 
faction in the State Duma. 
  The Canadian diplomat himself showed interest in 
Zhirinovskiy's attitude towards this problem and enumerated his 
own arguments in favor of signing the document, reports the 
press service. Zhirinovskiy expressed the opinion that joining 
the Partnership for Peace program would mean Russia's 
involvement in NATO in a concealed form, pursuing NATO's 
interests, and consequently the interests of the United States.

  [Text] Helsinki April 4 TASS -- Russia's Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy criticised on Monday the idea of his country 
joining the Council of Europe. 
  "We do not need your Council of Europe. We do not ask for 
it. On the contrary, it is you who need us", leader of a 
powerful faction in the russian parliament told reporters on 
arrival in Helsinki. A delegation of Russian lawmakers is due 
to take part in a parliamentary seminar here on prospects of the 
Russian membership of the Council of Europe. 
  Zhirinovskiy stressed that his party (ultra-nationalist 
party 
misleadingly called Liberal-Democratic) "has nothing against 
Finland". He complained that Finnish journalists lack true 
information, apparently referring to local media reports 
repeatedly calling him an advocate of Finland's re-joining 
Russia.

heading "In Brief"] 
  [Text] 2 Apr -- The DPRK has to all intents and purposes 
made a negative assessment of Russia's proposal to apply a 
multilateral approach in discussing the North Korean nuclear 
problem. A representative of the Republic's Foreign Ministry, 
answering questions today from a correspondent of KCNA, the 
official North Korean news agency, pointed out that "we make a 
positive assessment of the fact that Russia opposes sanctions 
and pressure and intends to find a solution to the problem 
around the political consultation table. But we are concerned 
that Russia's proposal for multilateral negotiations may 
complicate the problem."

    [Editorial Report] Paris AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI in Arabic on 1 
April publishes on pages 34-36 an approximately 3,500-word 
report from Moscow by Pavel Davidov on the proliferation of 
weapons of mass destruction in the breakaway republics of the 
former Soviet Union and on sales of these weapons and 
sophisticated technology to Third World and other nations. The 
report cites dangers threatening many nations as a result of the 
Soviet Republics' lack of control over their nuclear arsenal. 
It says the Russian intelligence and security agencies are 
incapable of protecting the world from the risks inherent in the 
proliferation of nuclear bombs, radioactive agents, missiles, 
and other weapons of mass destruction. 
  The magazine publishes highlights of a "secret report" 
submitted by the Russian Counterespionage Service to Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin "a few days ago." This classified 
report contains a "clear warning that it is impossible to 
prevent thefts, smuggling, and secret trade, which is on the 
rise in military plants and sensitive laboratories. The report 
also points out that the states that broke away from the Soviet 
Union are also unable to protect the dangerous installations 
they have inherited. These states are selling the installations 
to dealers who come from Iran, Pakistan, Iraq, and other 
nations, or to trade firms that specialize in gunrunning. 
Sometimes, plants are being sold, along with all their 
equipment, weapons, and experts. The report gives evidence that 
900 thefts from military and nuclear plants and 700 thefts of 
secret technology were reported only during the second half of 
1993, including nuclear weapons to Iran and Pakistan." 
  The report says that as a result of the unplanned 
reorganization of security agencies in Russia and the defects in 
the new structure of Russian security, Russian military 
institutions and plants, science institutes, and important 
laboratories have been deprived of the protection of the 
official security agencies. No special security agencies were 
established to protect those installations due to "lack of funds 
and the general deterioration in the country." 
  The report adds that what makes the situation even more 
difficult is that the newly independent republics do not know 
how to handle or get rid of the military and other plants on 
their territory. The leaders of those republics think the best 
way to remove these weapons and plants is by selling them to the 
highest bidder. 
  The report cites examples of the selling of weapons of mass 
destruction to other nations. In November 1993, a ship carrying 
40 families of Russian refugees arrived in the city of Isterkhan 
from Turkmenistan, including six families whose parents had 
worked in a secret workshop of the ammunition depot that belongs 
to the former Soviet war naval fleet. In this workshop, nuclear 
containers for torpedoes and sea mines were tested and most of 
them were sent to the Black Sea fleet. Following the 
disintegration of the Soviet Union, Turkmenistan decided that it 
did not need the containers, so the entire depot was sold within 
a year. The buyers were Iranians and Pakistanis. Also, a 
powder plant was sold in Uzbekistan when this republic saw that 
it no longer needs the plant and could not turn it into civilian 
production. The report adds: "We can give dozens of examples of 
this kind. The weapons of mass destruction spread all over the 
Third World from all the republics of the former Soviet Union 
because of the lack of control and protection exercised in the 
past by the KGB. These weapons can easily fall into the hands 
of irresponsible adventurers." 
  The report gives another example of the disappearance of a 
secret laboratory for scientific research in the area of 
chemical weapons and laser technology in a city in Kyrgyzstan. 
The buyer is unknown. 
  The report goes on to say that none of the republics of the 
former Soviet Union exercises state control over nuclear 
security, except for Russia which has a government committee to 
monitor nuclear activities. Even this committee has limited 
tasks. 
  The report devotes a chapter to the future of scientists, 
specialists in military industries, and nuclear experts. It 
discloses that "more than a third of the scientists and 
specialists in the nuclear field and highly sophisticated 
technology, who total 3,000 people that used to work in the 
Soviet Union, have left the country and now work at major 
scientific institutions in the United States, Japan, Germany, 
France, Britain, and Sweden."

<F P=106> [Vladimir Skosyrev report: "Chinese Diplomacy Frustrates </F>
Approval of Tough Resolution Against Pyongyang"] 
  [Text] Beijing -- The statement on North Korea that the UN 
Security Council approved 1 April was the result of a compromise 
between the United States and its Western supporters on the one 
hand and China on the other. Thus the PRC once again 
demonstrated that the West will not succeed in forcing Pyongyang 
to open up its nuclear installations for inspection without its 
consent. 
  What is more, the New York debate enabled Beijing to display 
the consistency of its policy. It has after all from the very 
start of the crisis claimed that methods of pressure and diktat 
are unacceptable. 
  But whereas Chinese diplomacy can enter a point in its 
favor, 
military strategists hardly have cause to be delighted. As long 
as the nature of the DPRK's nuclear program remains a secret and 
as long as Pyongyang continues to violate its nonproliferation 
treaty pledges there is still a threat to the security of all 
Korea's neighbors, including China. 
  Why then are they doggedly opposing attempts to include even 
a reference to sanctions in the UN ruling? Are they afraid of 
an unpredictable response from Kim Il-song and his offspring if 
things reach the point of an economic blockade against North 
Korea? That is unlikely. This state's leaders are not crazy, 
and they will not risk their own annihilation by unleashing 
another war on the peninsula. 
  Some foreign observers in Beijing are saying that the 
Chinese 
leadership is not united on the North Korean problem. Army 
representatives are alarmed not just by the nuclear ambitions of 
China's former ally in the socialist camp, they are afraid that 
Tokyo may follow Pyongyang with nuclear rearmament. 
  However, the army establishment is opposed by party 
ideologists, who are convinced that economic sanctions must not 
be allowed. They would after all ultimately bring about the 
collapse of another communist regime, which would be bound to 
affect Chinese Communists' morale. Moreover, the success of 
sanctions against the DPRK would create a bad international 
precedent. We would remind you that the United States is 
threatening economic repression against China itself in an 
effort to secure concessions from it in the human rights field. 
  There is also another viewpoint: Chinese intelligence is 
fairly well informed on the progress of nuclear research in the 
DPRK and believes that this country is incapable of 
manufacturing a bomb on its own. That is why Beijing is not 
inclined to overdramatize the conflict.

highly-enriched uranium obtained through dismantling nuclear 
warheads will arrive in Ukraine from Russia in the next few 
days. He said in an interview with INTERFAX on Monday that it 
is planned to send another train to Ukraine in April with 
nuclear power plant fuel. Altogether Russia is to supply 100 
tonnes of highly-enriched uranium to Ukraine as a compensation 
for the removal of nuclear warheads from that republic.

  [Text] Moscow 4 April, TASS -- President Yeltsin received 
U.N. Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali in the Kremlin today. 
They had a constructive and businesslike discussion of a wide 
range of problems dealing with world politics, and tasks in the 
sphere of consolidating world security. 
  Butrus-Ghali told Yeltsin about the steps taken for the 
purpose of making the work of the U.N. more quick and efficient. 
The Russian side supported the strengthening of the U.N. and 
the taking of measures for improving its work, so that it will 
be able to tackle topical problems of the 21st century. Yeltsin 
stressed Russia's interest in cooperation with the U.N. in 
connection with the advance of the Russian reform. The U.N. 
secretary-general said this was in line with his intentions and 
actions. 
  They discussed in detail problems of peace-keeping 
activities 
and humanitarian diplomacy. The sides were unanimous in their 
opinion that those spheres of the U.N. activities, which are 
becoming central in world politics, should be given greater 
attention and considerable resources. 
  Special attention was devoted to conflict situations on the 
CIS territory and the observance of human rights in the former 
USSR republics. Yeltsin stressed Russia's openness to 
cooperation with the U.N. for purposes of ensuring peace in the 
hotbeds of tension, situated on the CIS territory. Butrus-Ghali 
praised Russia's peace-keeping role and reiterated the U.N. 
intention to actively promote the attaining of a durable 
political solution to the crises, specifically in Georgia and 
Tajikistan. 
  Butrus-Ghali asked President Yeltsin to attend a summit 
meeting on social problems, due to take place in March 1995, and 
to address the U.N. General Assembly within the framework of 
preparations for the 50th anniversary of the United Nations 
Organisation. The invitations were accepted, ITAR-TASS learned 
from the press service of the Russian president.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Sergey Babkin </F>
and Aleksandr Krylovich] 
  [Text] Moscow 4 April, TASS -- Visiting U.N. Secretary 
General Butrus Butrus-Ghali highly appreciated the level of 
interaction between the Russian diplomacy and the world body in 
solving problems of maintaining peace in the territory of the 
former Soviet Union and peacekeeping operations in other areas 
of the world. Ghali was addressing a press conference in the 
Russian Foreign Ministry press centre today after his meetings 
with Russian officials. 
  According to the secretary general, Russia is one of the 
founders of the U.N.O., a permanent member of the U.N. Security 
Council and a super power. That is why the U.N. is interested 
in that Russia should play an important role in international 
affairs. Ghali assured that the U.N. will provide maximum 
possible help to Russia to overcome temporary transitional 
difficulties. He expressed the hope that this transitional 
period will be quite short. 
  The U.N. secretary general recalled that the international 
organisation is going to celebrate its 50th anniversary next 
year. In this context he spoke about intentions of the U.N. to 
organise three international conferences. A summit meeting on 
questions of social development will be held in Copenhagen in 
March 1995, a conference on problems of population and family 
planning will be organised in Cairo in September, and finally, 
the third international conference on problems of women will be 
held in Beijing, he said. Butrus-Ghali said that he had 
received support from the Russian leadership in organising U.N. 
golden jubilee celebrations.

  [text] Prime Minister of Czechia Vaclav Klaus is at the 
start of a two-day visit to Moscow, the first such visit to 
Russia by a Czech head of government. The two countries are 
expected to sign an agreement on investment protection and 
possibly, a protocol on this year's bilateral trade, a senior 
Russian diplomat told INTERFAX on Monday. 
  He said the two papers were almost ready for signing though 
some technicalities remained in the second draft but "these will 
have been resolved." 
  The diplomat spoke of no painful issues in relations between 
Moscow and Prague. He described them as good though admitting 
to some problems as well including the former Soviet Union's 
debt to ex-Czechoslovakia. "The trouble is both of them do no 
longer exist, but this is not to say the problem is insoluble," 
he said.

  [Text] As you already know, Czech Prime Minister Vaclav 
Klaus started his visit to Russia today. He was welcomed at 
Vnukovo-2 airport in Moscow by representatives of the Russian 
Government and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian 
Federation. Our special correspondent David Stahlavsky has 
phoned in: 
  [Stahlavsky] The Czech prime minister is accompanied in 
Moscow by representatives of the Ministries of Industry and 
Trade, Finance, and Foreign Affairs. This indicates the main 
aim of Vaclav Klaus' visit: namely, to solve the current 
economic problems in Czech-Russian relations, no doubt burdened 
by the state debt of Moscow to the value of $3 billion and a 
direct customer debt of $185 million. In view of its problematic 
solvency, Moscow is offering, as a relatively viable solution, 
deliveries of Russian goods to our market. The Czech condition, 
however,is concluding a clear and realistic agreement. 
  According to Deputy Finance Minister Vladimir Rudlovcak, who 
is accompanying Vaclav Klaus, the principles of this agreement 
should be assessed during the current visit of the Czech prime 
minister to Moscow. 
  Another of the visit's priorities is an agreement on 
problem-free deliveries of oil and gas for a longer period than 
hitherto; that is, for longer than one year. We are also 
considering possible capitalization of our claims, but thorough 
research of the enterprises offered is necessary for that. 
Finally, there will also be talks about the property of the 
former Council for Mutual Economic Assistance.

  [Text] The Czech Republic's Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus has 
said that the former economic cooperation between his country 
and Russia has become a thing of the past. 
  Addressing students of the Russian Government's Finance 
Academy in Moscow on Monday, he voiced doubt that his country 
would act toward any East European economic integration. "We 
favor a free market with our partners in Poland and Hungary, and 
in this sense are open to East and West alike." 
  He reported that at a meeting with Russia's Premier 
Chernomyrdin on Tuesday he would sign a treaty on mutual 
investment guarantees and one of the topics for discussion with 
Chernomyrdin will be Russia's debt to Czech enterprises. 
  In his speech before academy students, Klaus focused on the 
consistence with which his cabinet had proceeded from the 
administrative command economy to a market-oriented economy. As 
a result, the Czech kron has for 40 months now been a model of 
stability not only for the post-communist states but also for 
some western democracies. He pointed out that the Czech 
Republic, unlike neighboring East European countries, is trying 
hard to halt relentless western investment. 
  He claimed that the transition to a market economy should 
start primarily with macroeconomic transformations and a 
deficit-free budget. "There must be a man who can say "no" 
without fear of attack from the opposition and newspaper 
lampooning but who should be in close touch with society through 
the press," Klaus said. He described as a delusion the desire 
to attract western capital by all kinds of privileges. There is 
nothing more important for a government in a transitional 
period, according to Klaus, than to pave the way for economic 
recovery by curbing inflation, liberalizing prices and foreign 
trade, and privatizing property as soon as possible. 
  Klaus is paying an official visit to Russia.

  [Text] Moscow April 5 TASS -- The intergovernmental talks 
between the Russian and Czech delegations led by the heads of 
two governments, Viktor Chernomyrdin and Vaclav Klaus, ended 
here today with the signing of an agreement on encouragement and 
mutual protection of investments and a protocol on mutual 
supplies of goods in 1994. 
  After the ceremony of signing these documents, Viktor 
Chernomyrdin told journalists that during the talks "we were 
very much interested in the reforms which are being conducted in 
the Czech Republic, their mechanism and results. We are also 
following a path of reform, and I think there are many things we 
in Russia can adopt from the Czech experience". 
  The Russian prime-minister said economic relations between 
the two countries are now taking shape on a new, market basis 
and stressed that it is necessary to build up trade and economic 
ties. 
  Chernomyrdin expressed satisfaction with the talks and said 
that the two delegations also considered the rescheduling of the 
Russian debt to the Czech Republic, which Russia has "inherited" 
from the former USSR. 
  "We identified the mechanism of debt repayment and 
instructed 
experts to prepare the required document for signing before May 
30," Chernomyrdin said. 
  Vaclav Klaus said he was pleased with his talks with the 
Russian prime-minister and particularly stressed the solution to 
the problem of the Russian indebtedness. He said the new 
document, which the two countries are planning to sign soon, 
will contain a specific time-table of the debt repayment. 
  Klaus said that Chernomyrdin and himself also discussed 
Czech 
investments in the Russian economy.

  [Text] Moscow April 5 TASS -- Former socialist countries 
and former Soviet republics are beginning to spy on Russia, 
director of the Federal Counterintelligence Service Sergey 
Stepashin warned on Tuesday. 
  "The danger of spying has considerably increased today and 
can inflict major damage to independence, defence capability, 
scientific, technical and economic potential of the country", he 
told a conference on "Security of Individual, Society, State and 
Russian Special Services". 
  The director added that secret services of former Warsaw 
treaty member states and of former Soviet republics also get 
involved in the spying activities. 
  "This tendency calls to strictly determine the notion of the 
threat to Russian security", Stepashin said and added that 
counterintelligence bodies should be strengthened. 
  "A strong democratic Russia should have strong security 
bodies. As any other state, it has the right to resort to 
adequate measures to protect its national interests", he said. 
  Stepashin also voiced concern over increased attempts of 
foreign special services to ensure access to commercial 
information. 
  Dwelling on anti-crime fight in the country, he warned that 
mafia is actively trying to penetrate into the bodies of power, 
also by intimidation and terror. 
  New concepts of ensuring the national security are necessary 
and the Russian security council is working on them, the 
director said.

  [Text] Russian Defense Minister Army General Pavel Grachev 
answered a question from our correspondent and gave his 
assessment of the Georgian-Abkhaz documents signed today. 
  [Begin Grachev recording] The fact that Georgia and Abkhazia 
have now signed inspires optimism, because the Georgian 
leadership has started acknowledging that the Abkhaz leadership 
does exist. 
  But, once again, one can sign as many documents as one 
wants, 
provided there is enough paper. But the important thing is 
practical implementation. I personally have occasionally acted 
as a peace-broker at the request of Armenia's and Azerbaijan's 
defense ministers, to settle the Karabakh problem. While they 
are at the negotiating table, everything looks fine: I bring 
them together, they kiss and shake hands, have lunch together -- 
but when they get back to their countries, everything starts 
anew. I have tried three times, and I have told them not to 
expect me to do it the fourth time round. After all, I am not a 
peace-maker, I am a defense minister. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev in </F>
Bucharest by RIA NOVOSTI correspondent Vyacheslav Samoshkin 
specially for ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI; date of interview not stated: 
"Pavel Grachev: Romanian Partners' Position Has Changed"] 
  [Text] Bucharest -- In late March Russian Federation 
Defense Minister Pavel Grachev headed a Russian military 
delegation in Romania on an official visit during which an 
agreement was signed on cooperation between the two countries' 
defense ministers. At the end of the visit he gave an exclusive 
interview to your RIA NOVOSTI correspondent. 
  [Samoshkin] Pavel Sergeyevich, are you pleased with the 
trip's results? 
  [Grachev] My very first talks with our Romanian partners 
dispelled doubts as to the expediency of our visit. They 
stressed that despite the stagnation in our relations over 
several years they are ready and will seek to develop equal and 
mutually advantageous relations along military channels so that 
they can be as strong as at the time of the Warsaw Pact. At my 
meeting with Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu this thought was 
a leitmotif. At talks with prime minister Nicolae Vacaroiu and 
President Ion Iliescu I was fully convinced that Romania has now 
fundamentally revised its attitude toward Russia. I was frankly 
told that Romania will seek cooperation with Russia on all 
salients. 
  [Samoshkin] Romania officially sees the "partnership for 
peace" program as its first step toward integration into NATO 
structures. Russia has a rather different view of this program. 
In that case how can they really find a common language? 
  [Grachev] Yes, indeed, Romania was the first to accede to 
the "partnership for peace." But President Iliescu expressed an 
interesting position. Yes, he said, we are for the partnership 
on an equal basis with all states, including the NATO states. 
In his opinion partnership for security should be implemented 
by all countries, which fully accords with our approaches too. 
And he also stressed the idea that, yes, we are seeking to be 
integrated into NATO but simultaneously, all together, including 
Russia. He sees NATO's transformation from a military-political 
alliance to a political and peacekeeping one. President Iliescu 
puts foremost partnership not in the military field but in the 
economic field, that is first economic partnership for peace and 
only then all its other aspects. 
  [Samoshkin] Abroad, including in Romania, the thesis of 
Russia's special role in NATO and in the "partnership for peace" 
has given rise to various interpretations. What do people have 
in mind here? 
  [Grachev] All East European countries view the concept of 
"partnership for peace" as an initial, transitional stage toward 
integration in the NATO system. That will happen gradually, as 
the military weapons we produce go out of commission, as new 
military cadres are trained -- according to the NATO system -- 
and, of course, as the countries emerge from the economic crisis 
to pay money for new weapons. Right now they are simply not 
ready for this integration. And this stage will last 8-10 
years. Our special role is that we will never simply be 
integrated into NATO structures because our strategic missile 
forces and nuclear weapons on ships in the air force mean that 
we have a great army with powerful modern weapons. So that in 
contrast to other neighboring countries for us the "partnership 
for peace" is not a transitional stage. 
  [Samoshkin] Until recently Romania officially voiced 
itself in favor of the withdrawal of the 14th Russian Army from 
the Dniester region. How do you explain the fact that during 
your visit this question was not touched on in any way by the 
Romanian side? 
  [Grachev] I see in this a certain change in the approach 
toward our bilateral cooperation. Why have our relations 
declined? Because of the conflict situation in Moldova. You 
remember that I was criticized here when I said that arms 
deliveries were being sent from Romania to Moldova and the 
Romanians accused us of supporting the Dniester region people. 
On the basis of this conflict in Moldova our relations were 
frankly destroyed. But now the position of our Romanian 
partners has changed in that none of our interlocutors tried to 
link our relations with the situation in Moldova, in particular 
in the Dniester region. The implication is that they believe 
this is the problem of a third country, that is Moldova....

<F P=106> [Elmar Guseynov report: "Last 15 Israeli Policemen Remain </F>
in Jericho To Hand Over City to Palestinian Security Forces. 
Russian Diplomats Deliver Special Messages from President 
Yeltsin to Damascus and Amman"] 
  [Excerpt] Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and 
the Russian president's special representative Viktor Posuvalyuk 
brought Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad a personal message from 
Boris Yeltsin. The Russian diplomats are keeping the text of 
the message a secret. 
  The outcome of the Palestinians' peace talks with Israel 
depends on Syria' stance. It was owing to Syria's and Jordan's 
refusal to continue the talks following the Hebron massacre that 
the Arab-Israeli negotiating process ran into delay five weeks 
ago. 
  What is more, it has not proved possible to organize 
bilateral talks between Syria and the Jewish state, prompting 
Russia -- as one of the two sponsors of the Near East settlement 
process -- to pay particular attention to President Hafiz 
al-Asad. 
  Following his visit to Damascus I. Ivanov returned to Moscow 
while V. Posuvalyuk went on to Amman to hand the King of Jordan 
a message from Yeltsin. 
  The high-ranking Foreign Ministry staffers' visit to 
Damascus 
and Amman obviously marks a fresh attempt by Russian diplomacy 
to preserve its role as one of the patrons of the Near East 
negotiating process after Moscow's recent peace initiative 
failed to meet with support from the parties to this process. 
  The boost to Russian foreign policy in the region is 
occurring amid the resumption of the peace process. Talks 
between the Israelis and the PLO have continued in Cairo.

member of the Iraq Command of the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party, 
met here today with Mr. Boris Kolokolov, deputy foreign minister 
of the Russian Federation. 
  They discussed Iraq's fulfillment of all the obligations 
specified by UN Security Council resolutions and the need for 
the council to fulfill its obligations as stipulated by 
Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687 and to lift the economic 
sanctions. 
  'Abd-al-Ghafur noted the positive development in the 
attitudes of some permanent members of the Security Council, 
including Russia. He called for the Russian stand to be 
developed to a more effective footing so as to end the blockade 
and the hardships endured by the Iraqi people. 
  The Russian minister told 'Abd-al-Ghafur his country was 
eager to develop its ties with Iraq in the best interests of the 
two friendly nations. 
  The session was attended by Mr. 'Abd-al-Razzaq al-Hashimi, 
director of the Ba'th Party's Foreign Relations Bureau, and 
Russian Foreign Ministry officials.

  [Text] Tel Aviv 5 April, TASS -- Prime Minister of Israel 
Yitzhaq Rabin received Russian presidents' special envoy on 
Middle East settlement Viktor Posuvalyuk in Jerusalem on Monday. 
The Russian envoy arrived in Israel from Jordan, where he had a 
meeting with King Husayn. Prior to this, Posuvalyuk had 
participated in talks with President of Syria Hafiz al-Asad. 
  Posuvalyuk said that his mission is aimed at providing the 
maximum possible assistance to move ahead the Middle East peace 
process, help renew and complete talks between participants in 
this process within the framework of the active line followed by 
Russia. According to him, using its confidential ties with 
states and also with political leaders of the region, "Russia 
induces interested sides to implement all that has been 
contemplated at Madrid and what was agreed at Oslo, Washington 
and Cairo, without wasting any time." 
  "The tragedy at Hebron has laid bare the absolute truth that 
opponents of the negotiations are trying to take advantage of 
falling out of step and pauses in the negotiation process. This 
threatens a roll back and poses danger to all achievements of 
the peace process," the Russian envoy said. 
  "Main political forces, society and public as a whole in 
Russia are in favour of such an active and single-minded stand 
on the Middle East problem, the neighbourhood region for us, 
where today there exist and will exist in the future great 
interests of our state," Posuvalyuk concluded. 
  According to diplomatic sources, a meeting between the 
Russian representative and Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on 
Peres is to be held on Tuesday morning.

  [Text] At present Pavel Grachev, Russian defense minister, 
does not see prospects for setting up joint armed forces for the 
Commonwealth republics. According to the minister, such forces 
can be set up only if CIS states form a closer political and 
economic union. In addition, Defense Minister Pavel Grachev had 
a meeting with Butrus Butrus-Ghali, UN secretary-general, today 
and said after the meeting that Russian peace-keeping forces 
would be able to carry out their operations in the CIS under the 
UN aegis. According to the minister, Butrus-Ghali supported 
this position wholeheartedly.

  [Text] The Estonian Government categorically opposes the 
granting of a peacekeeping mandate to Russia, Estonian Foreign 
Minister Juri Luik told Interfax. 
  He said that only the UN and the CSCE had such a mandate. 
The granting of this mandate to any individual country is a 
gross violation of international norms and peacekeeping 
principles, said Luik. 
  "Russia has the right to participate in peacekeeping 
operations within the framework of the UN and does not need any 
additional mandate," he stated. 
  He also pointed out that Estonia was against giving 
individual countries a "carte blanche" and would insist on the 
observance of this principle.

  [Text] Tashkent -- A newspaper published by Uzbekistan's 
parliament and government, NARODNOYE SLOVO (THE PEOPLE'S WORD), 
has sharply criticized Kazakhstan President Nursultan 
Nazarbayev's proposal for a Eurasian Union. One of the issues 
of the paper carried a story headlined "Spring Has Come. The 
Indefatigable Politician Is Buzzing Around," which says the 
phrase "Eurasian Union" is aimed at "simpletons." 
  "Uzbekistan still has a long way to go to reach the level of 
Europe, where states can afford the luxury of unification 
without being afraid to find themselves under somebody else's 
dictatorship," the story says. 
  "The essence of the Eurasian Union idea is not new. It 
pursues the aim of restoring the Soviet Union, which is nothing 
but gibberish," the story says. 
  Such was the first reaction in Uzbekistan to Nazarbayev's 
idea. The newspaper received the story from the Republic's 
national news agency. 
  Kiev -- Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk, in comments to 
journalists, called Nazarbayev's initiative "premature," but 
said it "needs serious study." He said the final decision on it 
should not be the prerogative of the heads of state of the 
countries concerned but ought to be based on referendums in them. 
  Kravchuk said he objected to the dissolution of the CIS, 
which, he said, had not yet exhausted its potential.

  [Text] The situation in the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic [NKR] 
has been relatively peaceful during the past few days. The 
Armenian Defense Army headquarters has revealed that the 
disputing sides have refrained from intensive combat operations. 
But the Armenian defense positions in Askeranskiy Rayon were 
fired on from military bases in Egerli and Kemerli in Agdamskiy 
Rayon with large-caliber machine guns in the morning of 31 
March. Firing resumed at about 1500 on the same day. Ashagy 
Akhmedli in Fizulinskiy Rayon and Matavis and Magavus in 
Mardakertskiy Rayon were also fired on on 31 March. No one was 
hurt. 
  NKR military experts have linked the lessening tension in 
NKR's front line with recent defeats suffered by the Azerbaijani 
Armed Forces in several areas. 
  The NKR Defense Army headquarters has refuted a disclosure 
by 
the Azerbaijani Defense Ministry that the Azerbaijani military 
forces have placed new positions under their control in 
Agdamskiy Rayon. A high-ranking NKR military official has 
described the disclosure as an effort to divert attention from 
the failure of the Azerbaijani Armed Forces' large-scale 
onslaught in the eastern front line and the large number of 
casualties they have suffered. That is quite true. The 
Azerbaijani military forces have lost many men and a large 
quantity of military equipment from December 1993 to April 1994. 
Dozens of enemy officers and men have been captured, over 
10,000 Azerbaijani troops have been killed, and some 30,000 men 
have been wounded. 
  The Armenian Defense Ministry Information Center has 
reported 
that the situation on Armenia's border was relatively peaceful 
on the night of 30 March and on 31 March.

<F P=106> [Regular weekly interview with Georgian State Council </F>
Chairman Eduard Shevardnadze by Nato Oniani in Tbilisi on 4 
April -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Passage indistinct] [Oniani] Tbilisi subway 
engine drivers were on strike and returned to work yesterday. 
The railway was also on strike. What do you think this is? Is 
this a result of their social conditions, I mean a social mutiny 
certain circles have been threatening us with? Or is this an 
action planned in accordance with certain political forces' 
desire to come to power? 
  [Shevardnadze] I think both. I am not going to elaborate on 
this. I simply want to express my attitude. I am thankful to 
the railway personnel, whom I have always relied on, and the 
personnel of the subway. They experience great difficulties and 
despite this, they have demonstrated a high civic awareness, 
acknowledged our difficulties, and taken into consideration the 
difficulties of the country and every citizen of the country and 
returned to work. I am thankful to the deputies who visited the 
strikers. They had thought that something unlawful was taking 
place. I cannot say that they appealed to them to return to 
work, but they assured themselves that the law had not been 
violated there and they did not provoke the continuation of the 
strike. [passage omitted] 
  Now a few words about strikes in general. Strikes make sense 
in two cases. First, when the state or a private entrepreneur 
has possibilities and resources that are not used for the 
benefit of the employees. As a result, the employees suffer 
economic losses and feel insecurity in some other spheres. 
  The state and the citizens are well aware what Georgia 
possesses today. They will not be able to gain much from their 
strikes. [passage omitted] An increase of salaries in coupons 
can eventually have a reverse effect. A better result can be 
achieved if it is found possible to bring in goods so that they 
are purchased for coupons. This could help, but the state does 
not have a lot of big resources or reserves. Of course, we can 
issue a large number of additional coupons and distribute them, 
but this will not be of any help. So, in this case, a strike is 
not a good tool to improve your own economic conditions and the 
economic conditions of your enterprise. 
  Another time is when you consider it necessary that the head 
of state quit, the government be replaced, and so on. [passage 
omitted] My actions have repeatedly proved that no violent 
forces or strikes are required for this. I reiterate that I 
have always been ready for this if it is beneficial for our 
deeds. But I want to declare that while I am doing my job, I 
will do it as my conscience allows me and as my knowledge and 
experience, as well as physical possibilities, allow me to. 
Keep in mind that there cannot be more than 24 hours in a day. 
Hence, the physical possibilities of those who give all their 
power and sense of responsibility to their work are limited. 
Therefore, at present, there are no grounds for a demand that 
the authorities quit. I mean that a strike is not a means to 
save the state today. On the contrary, a strike will 
practically be directed against families, children, and our own 
country. 
  [Oniniani] Certain positive changes have been observed 
lately in talks with the Abkhazia side in Moscow. Will these 
promote the deployment of peacekeeping forces in Abkhazia? 
Another question. The day before yesterday, you spend most of 
the time in the Ministry of Defense. What is being done to 
achieve the aim you planned when taking up the leadership of the 
ministry, I mean the establishment of a new Georgian army? 
  [Shevardnadze] If signed this morning, the text of the 
agreement will be both a maximum and a minimum. The work on it 
still continues in Moscow, and I am not ready to comment on 
every paragraph of it because changes were being introduced 
during the past two days. It is a maximum of the present 
possibilities and a minimum for the UN Security Council to make 
a decision on the deployment of international peacekeeping 
forces. You remember their precondition that certain progress 
should be made during the talks, a cease-fire should be 
implemented, fighting should be stopped, and only after this the 
United Nations would make a decision to have international 
forces deployed. Therefore, when signed, this agreement will 
have an essential importance. As for the formula mentioned by 
Kozyrev, it will be amplified this morning, and I think it must 
be acceptable in principle. There is a little exception there. 
An armed person should not enter Abkhazia. Neither should 
those who are in the military service, in military units today. 
They cannot enter Abkhazia as servicemen. This has nothing to 
do with about 98 percent of the population, and only the case of 
about 2 percent should be elucidated. I know what will follow 
the publication of the agreement. There will be questions about 
what the other side is doing and how will the issues of 
demilitarization, disarmament of the units present there be 
handled. All this comprises the second stage. 
  At the moment, the principal thing is to create conditions 
for the deployment of international peacekeeping forces. And I 
want everyone to understand this well. 
  As for the Ministry of Defense, serious work has started 
there. [passage omitted] A lot is yet to be done. We have 
discussed all this at the meeting of the collegium and made 
certain decisions. We shall speak about the decisions later. 
  [Oniani] Batono [polite form of address] Eduard, what do you 
think can be the reason of a virtually unanimous approval of 
your nominees to the Cabinet of Ministers? I am asking this 
question because before this process began, there was rather a 
strong opposition to them. 
  [Shevardnadze] Do not hurry. About the unanimity. There 
have been difficulties. What can be said about the case with 
Mr. Mindia Ugrekhelidze? It is an absolutely incomprehensible 
case. This man is a living image of conscience and honor, one 
of the best experts on law. I have a deep respect for him as a 
lawyer and an individual and I cannot imagine anyone who does 
not respect him. An amazingly positive person, and I believe 
this was a result of some misunderstanding. But it happened 
anyway, and this is a difficulty. 
  We are facing a crucial day tomorrow. The fate of 10 
ministries will be decided. I believe that the parliament will 
stick to its good standards. 
  Now, you are asking me what the motive is and why it has 
been 
happening like this. I would like to give the following 
explanation. A sense of responsibility is dominant in the case. 
This happened when the parliament demonstrated its unity as the 
police forces intruded into the building. I believe that the 
majority of the parliament, I do not mean the official majority 
but actually most of the deputies are well aware of the 
situation the country can find itself in if a government crisis 
continues. In fact, we are witnessing a crisis now because a 
person has been sitting in the parliament for weeks waiting for 
his turn to be approved. The ministries are at a virtual 
standstill at the moment. I reiterate, this is a sense of 
responsibility. 
  [Oniani] And finally. In his TV interview, Security 
Minister Igor Giorgadze forecast that the current tensions would 
culminate on 9 April [on this day in 1989, 20 people died when 
Soviet troops dispersed a rally, and in 1991, the Georgian 
parliament adopted an Act on the restoration of Georgia's 
independence]. Was this the reason for the postponement of your 
visit to Israel? 
  [Shevardnadze] Generally, before my foreign visits something 
always takes place. The same has happened now. I mean strikes, 
the incident that happened here [the police raid on parliament], 
which has not been completely settled yet, and yet another 
expected event Mr. Giorgadze spoke about. So, I summoned the 
Israeli ambassador and informed him with anguish that my leaving 
the country was not expedient at the moment. 
  I would say that I am doing this to be on the safe side. So, 
I have put off a visit that is so important for our country and 
especially for the economic prospects of the country. Some 
people think that these visits are simply visits and excursions 
and nothing else. You yourself have witnessed what hard work is 
done during these visits. Everyone who is involved is extremely 
busy. And every visit has a certain effect on Georgia. We have 
not become rich, but the fact that we can take a breath and we 
exist is a result of these visits. 
  U.S. President Clinton announced that he was allotting about 
$70 million in aid. Later, as a result of our delegation's 
activities there, the sum increased to about $80 million. Some 
more sums will be added to this from other sources and 
foundations, some from previous years, and eventually Georgia 
will have $140-$150 million for the current year. There would 
have probably been certain assistance even without this visit, 
but the visit played its role. Thus, it is not entertainment, 
and when a visit is on the agenda, we have to back up one 
another because this is so essential for Georgia. Thank you.

  [Text] A drastic restructuring of the republican television 
and radio has started in Kazakhstan. In accordance with a 
decree signed by President Nursultan Nazarbayev today, the state 
Kazakhstan TV and Radio Broadcasting Company is to be closed 
down and a republican corporation of Kazakhstan's television and 
radio is to be set up instead. 
  The head of state says his decision has been caused by 
objective necessity: It is obvious that the state broadcasting 
company has lost the struggle for the radio audience to the 
numerous commercial studios and stations in Kazakhstan, as well 
as to programs broadcast from Moscow. It is no coincidence that 
(Leyla Beketova), head of a commercial TV channel, has been 
appointed president of the new corporation. 
  At the same time, one can clearly see that the Kazakhstan 
head of state is striving to increase his own influence on the 
Republic's television and radio broadcasting. For instance, the 
top official of the corporation will be directly subordinate to 
him. The president of the Republic has also appointed a senior 
official from his press service as his permanent representative 
in the new structure.

  [Text] Russia can sell 3,000 tonnes of natural uranium per 
year on the American market for the next two years. This 
amendment to the anti-dumping agreement for uranium has been 
adopted by Moscow and Washington. However, the present 
amendment has a number of restrictions. In particular, the 
Russian side has the right to sell only 50 percent of the volume 
indicated in a contract. The remainder of the supplies are 
carried out by American producers. In addition to this, Russia 
can sell 500 tonnes of natural uranium on the U.S. market per 
year at a price of not less than $13 a pound. At present the 
price of natural uranium on the American market is approximately 
$10.

the immediate future to practice cooperation between the 
internal troops and militia in emergency situations. 
  The authorities do not draw a line there. They intend to go 
to Muscovites and residents of areas around Moscow in a bid to 
recruit another 6,000 people to the Moscow militia. As in the 
good old days, plans call for the selection of personnel from 
those proposed by work collectives, or for recruiting them from 
among men on active duty in the army and navy.

  [Text] Elections were held in Magadan Oblast yesterday. 
This is what our correspondent Gennadiy Ovchinnikov reports: 
According to the latest information, 27.2 percent of registered 
voters in Magadan Oblast took part in the voting, though 
elections were held in only 10 of the 17 electoral districts. 
Thus, only one more deputy is required to make up the minimum 
necessary for the Oblast Duma to commence work. 
  Presently, the Oblast Electoral Commission is preparing a 
recommendation for the oblast administration of what to do in 
such a situation. Whether to conduct additional elections or to 
seek a solution in the Central Electoral Commission's 
contradictory and rather hazy edicts, statutes, directives, and 
interpretations, which allows a broad reading of the election 
results. The final decision is expected to be adopted within 
five days.

<F P=106> [Article by Deputy Chief Editor L. Kozin: "The Communists </F>
Have Won. And This Is No April Fool's Day Hoax"] 
  [Text] The Supreme Council elections were, generally, 
conducted six weeks ago by the newspaper AKTSENT; 73.14 percent 
of the participants in the "I and the Elections" poll expressed 
an intention to take part in the ballot. The turnout on 27 March 
was 73 percent. 
  Kiev sociologists from the Democratic Initiatives center, 
who 
conducted a poll at the start of March, maintain that 18 percent 
of the participants supported capitalist relationships in 
Ukraine. The responses of the participants in our poll, on the 
other hand (just 2 percent of them see capitalism as the 
country's future), were borne out by the election results. Among 
the seven people's deputies elected in the first round, four are 
communists. Among the 81 candidates who have gone on to the 
second round, there are 32 members of the Communist Party, six 
members of the Socialist Party, four of the Labor Party, two of 
the Ukraine Citizens' Congress, one of the Peasant Party, and 
one of the Liberal Party. Among those who will be competing for 
the seat of deputy is a sizable number of red directors and 
whose who, while not formally members of any party of an 
anticapitalist focus, have, nonetheless, shown themselves to be, 
in fact, their fellow travelers. The colossal success of the 
extreme left and left-wing forces has confirmed the clear 
orientation of the workers and peasants of the oblast toward 
socialism. Impressive proof of this was the imposing victory of 
P. Simonenko, first secretary of the Communist Party Central 
Committee, who is today receiving the congratulations of his 
comrades. There were 45,430 votes for him in Krasnoarmeyskiy 
District 150 against fewer than half as many. 
  After we had published the results of the "I and the 
Elections" poll, the newspaper heard many accusations to the 
effect that we had laid it on thick, having declared in the 
headline that the oblast's working people said "Yes to 
socialism!" and "No to nationalism!" and that the mood in the 
proletarian stronghold was, in fact, different. But we were 
merely strictly recording at that time the opinions expressed by 
the electorate, which were subsequently borne out on 27 March. 
  As anticipated, candidates of a nationalist persuasion 
failed 
totally. In Leninskiy Electoral District 114, Oleynik, the 
representative of these forces, mustered 707 votes (against 
51,083), and the results achieved in this district by 
Biletskiy--2,895 (against 48,895)--were not much better. As a 
counterweight to them, the communist Shapovalov won the 
affections of 12,693 voters of District 114, and Deputy Prime 
Minister Landik was credited with even more votes--22,354. Both 
have gone on to the second round. In Kievskiy District 110, some 
1,458 votes were cast for Talymonchuk, representative of the 
nationalist forces, whereas 21,218 were cast for Buyko, leader 
of the oblast's communists, and 20,490 for acting Prime Minister 
Zvyahilskyy. In Budennovskiy District 107, a palpable defeat was 
sustained by Ratnikova, only 2,343 votes were cast for her. V. 
Shcherban, deputy chairman of the city council executive 
committee, amassed 23,400 votes here, and Communist Party member 
Kolombet, 5,064. The nationalists were unable to offer their 
political opponents any in any way serious competition in other 
districts either. If these figures are not astonishing, 
Charodeyev's defeat in Donetsk's Proletarskiy District 116 was 
sensational. It is striking that in this part of Ukraine 
Charodeyev's views are shared by many people (to which the 
results of an oblast consultative poll conducted on the same day 
as the elections point also), but the personality of the 
individual professing such views was not attractive to many 
people. Some 6,741 votes were cast for him. For Fedorenko and 
Ampilogov, who have moved into the second round, 15,953 and 
11,795 respectively. 
  A defeat comparable, perhaps, only to a political coma was 
sustained by the Liberal Party. One of its leaders, Tokarev, had 
forecast in mid-February (precisely at the time AKTSENT was 
conducting its poll) that his party "could be victorious in no 
fewer than 35 districts" out of the 47. Seventeen persons had 
been nominated as party candidates, and what is more, 46 members 
of the Liberal Party had been registered as candidates, 
according to the member of the leadership of the LPU [Liberal 
Party of Ukraine]. The people and forces that created this party 
drove the LPU into a corner by having called it liberal. On the 
one hand it cannot garner a harvest of votes from the thin, 
genuinely liberal and democratic stratum of society inasmuch as 
this stratum has a dubious attitude toward the sincerity of 
yesterday's party and Communist Youth League nomenklatura, which 
is the backbone of the party leadership. On the other, for the 
communist majority of the electorate and for this region in 
general the very word "liberal" (even if authentic) is an 
abusive, "bourgeois" word. The absence of a base for a growth of 
its influence plus the absence of teams operating in modern 
fashion, inexpressive election programs, and a number of other 
aspects led to just one person for the entire oblast getting 
through to the second round from the ranks of "pure" members of 
the LPU. It is becoming obvious that the sole correct move made 
by the leadership of the LPU prior to the elections on 27 March 
was the non-nomination of its leader as a candidate. 
  So the first round is behind us. The second lies ahead. The 
East is unfurling the red banners. The West is hoisting the 
yellow and blue banners even higher. A three-color rainbow hangs 
over Ukraine. There are no other colors in this country, it 
seems.

<F P=106> ["Joint Statement by the Russian Foreign Ministry and </F>
Defense Ministry": "Actions, Not Declarations Are What Is 
Needed"] 
  [Text] Of late, statements by certain politicians in 
foreign countries, items in the foreign mass media, and debates 
at international forums have sometimes voiced the idea of the 
"ambiguity" of Russia's peacekeeping mission on the territory of 
a number of CIS countries. Talk of Russia's "neoimperial 
ambitions" is becoming increasingly current. No matter what 
form these recriminations take, they invariably boil down to one 
thing: Russia is allegedly stepping up strong-arm pressure on 
its neighbors and demanding the right to "interfere" in their 
internal affairs on the pretext of peacekeeping activity -- 
virtually bypassing universally recognized norms of 
international law, moreover. At the same time what is being 
perpetrated is not just an arbitrary interpretation of the facts 
but also the impudent or unwitting distortion of these facts. 
  The idea that Russia is allegedly "unilaterally" sending 
troops to unstable regions is the main argument used by people 
who take that kind of view of Russian peacekeeping in 
neighboring states. It is thence concluded that involving the 
world community in peacekeeping efforts to settle conflicts on 
the territory of the former USSR should consist in supervising 
Russia's actions. 
  We do not want to exaggerate the importance of this line 
being taken in certain political and social circles in West and 
East. Most countries' leaders demonstrate a responsible and 
sober approach, acknowledging Russia's positive role in curbing 
and settling crisis situations. Russia would like to see a more 
lasting, true partnership founded on equality, mutual trust, and 
respect established in the field of peacekeeping in the CIS 
countries in actual fact and not just in declarations of intent. 
  To this end we consider it timely to draw attention to a 
number of fundamental political and international-legal elements 
of Russia's involvement in peacekeeping activity in the CIS. 
  Russia's actions are designed only to stop armed clashes in 
a 
number of the new independent states, stabilize the situation 
there, and create conditions for a long-term lasting settlement. 
We take pride in the fact that, thanks to the presence of 
Russian peacekeeping forces in "hot zones," far more numerous 
civilian casualties have been avoided. 
  Our efforts are being mounted against the backdrop of the 
dramatically complex economic and financial situation in Russia 
itself, diverting considerable funds into peacekeeping: In the 
last 10 months alone this expenditure has totaled around 26 
billion rubles (notwithstanding the difficulty of precise 
calculations and our peacekeepers' inadequate supplies compared 
with the UN "blue helmets"). There are over 15,000 Russian 
servicemen in hot spots on the territory of the CIS states. 
  Peacekeeping in the Commonwealth countries is not a "Russian 
initiative." In all cases without exception our actions are 
being conducted at the request and with the consent of the 
appropriate states and warring parties. Peacekeeping 
contingents are sent on the basis of bilateral and multilateral 
agreements that accord with the norms of international law. 
This fully squares with the provisions of the UN Charter, 
whereby the possibility of resolving questions of peacekeeping 
on the basis of agreements between the interested states is not 
only entertained but even welcomed (Article 52 of the UN 
Charter). The only exception being coercive operations, which 
must be carried out under the leadership of the Security Council 
in accordance with Article 53 of the UN Charter. However, all 
the current peacekeeping operations on the territory of what was 
the USSR do not fall under that provision since they are not 
coercive but are being conducted with the consent of all the 
warring parties. The United Nations and the CSCE are regularly 
briefed on the progress of all these operations. 
  Russia consistently advocates very extensive UN and CSCE 
involvement in settling conflicts in the CIS countries. But 
there is no need for any UN and CSCE "permission" for the 
operations involving Russia and its neighbors that are being 
carried out on the basis of the above criteria. These 
operations are being conducted on the basis of the sovereign 
rights of the corresponding states as enshrined in the UN 
Charter and need no further legitimization. The fact that 
cooperation with the United Nations and the CSCE and their 
active, thorough support for the peacekeeping efforts made by 
Russia and its neighbors could really help to settle the 
conflicts more effectively and rapidly is another matter. We 
also advocate this by asking the United Nations and the CSCE to 
cooperate with the peacekeeping operations in the CIS countries 
in various forms, including by sending missions, observers, 
advisers, etc. Russia will also be willing to take part in UN 
and CSCE peacekeeping operations on the territory of the former 
USSR if the parties to a particular conflict ask these 
organizations to set up such operations there and if it is 
decided to carry them out. 
  However it must be stated that reaction to the CIS 
countries' 
repeated appeals to the United Nations and CSCE for support (in 
particular with regard to the conflicts in Abkhazia and 
Tajikistan) is being dragged out. Therefore agreements between 
Russia and its neighbors, along with mechanisms set up within 
the CIS framework, remain the main peacekeeping instruments in 
the region. It is thanks to them that the tasks of maintaining 
international peace and security, an inalienable part of 
ensuring global stability, are now being resolved. The world 
community should recognize that objective reality and move on to 
to closer cooperation with Russia and its neighbors. That would 
incidentally help all "doubters" to see the "transparency" of 
these peacekeeping operations and the unfounded nature of the 
suspicions on this score. 
  In firmly pursuing a policy of ensuring peace and stability 
around its borders and meeting its pledges under agreements with 
the corresponding countries and within the CIS framework, Russia 
is not pitting its efforts against anyone whatsoever. We do not 
demand a special status for ourselves or an exclusive role, but 
nor are we evading our responsibility for the situation in what 
is a key region for Russia. We are prepared for constructive 
cooperation on these matters with the United Nations, the CSCE, 
and the world community as a whole.

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow April 5 TASS--NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on the 
visit of U.N. Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali to Moscow: 
  "The U.N. chief's three main meetings with President Boris 
Yeltsin, Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and Defence Minister 
Pavel Grachev were notable for an abundance of gratitude 
lavished by the sides on each other. The deservedness of such 
lavishness cannot conceal a certain difference in their points 
of view on approach to peacemaking problems". 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA quotes Russian Defence Minister Pavel 
Grachev 
as saying that "Articles 51-55 of the U.N. Charter, in 
particular, allow peacemaking activities on a regional scale. 
If the conflict in Rwanda is being settled by the United 
Nations organisation, the one in Haiti by the Organisation of 
American States, why not legalise the activities of a collective 
peacemaking force of the countries that are parties to a 
collective security treaty within the CIS framework?". 
  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI quotes the U.N. secretary-general as 
saying 
that "Russia is a great power and a permanent member of the U.N. 
Security Council. We hope that it will contribute to enhancing 
the role of the United Nations in the international arena 
subsequently as well". 
  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI reports that a white paper about the 
October 1993 events in Moscow is being prepared for publication. 
It is a question of selecting materials about both the events 
on the October days proper and the preceding developments--the 
meeting of the Supreme Soviet (parliament), the last congress, 
official decrees... 
  "Work on a documentary version of the book has been almost 
completed. This version will be put out in a small print run 
intended mainly for scientific workers. 
  "A documentary-and-publicistic version of the book is still 
in the works and will have a much larger print run". 
  PRAVDA carries an interview with former Russian 
Vice-President Aleksandr Rutskoy who makes an estimate of the 
October 1993 events. In response to correspondents' questions, 
Rutskoy made it clear once again that he does not intend to quit 
the political stage. 
  "To quit politics now would mean to betray first of all 
those 
people who believe me," Rutskoy emphasised. 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA runs an interview with Federal Council 
Speaker Vladimir Shumeyko. 
  Touching upon the possibility of creating a community or a 
union on confederative principles on the territory of the former 
Soviet Union, Shumeyko pointed out as follows: "I consider it 
possible to establish an integrated community of states, which 
can be done on the basis of the existing CIS institutions, not 
to recreate the Soviet Union as it was prior to perestroyka." 
  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA carries an interview with director of 
the Federal Counterintelligence Service Sergey Stepashin. 
Touching upon the outflow of scientific ideas, high 
technologies and advanced systems of armaments and military 
hardware from Russia, Stepashin said "the country in the near 
future may lose its lead in the development of fundamental and 
applied research, lose many scientific schools and highly 
skilled personnel, and suffer considerable and, in point of 
fact, irreplaceable material damage." 
  "Calculations done by Russian Science Ministry according to 
U.N. methods indicate that if a specialist emigrates, the 
country loses about 300,000 U.S. dollars. Russia may suffer a 
potential damage of about 20,000 million dollars every year as a 
result of emigration." 
  TRUD frontpages an article about the supply of substandard 
and quite often tainted foodstuffs to the Russian market from 
abroad. 
  "In the first quarter of the year alone, the state trade 
inspectorate rejected almost 60 percent of examined meat 
products and sausages, more than 70 percent of alcoholic drinks, 
and over 40 percent of tea and coffee. 
  "The inspectorate checked and found unfit for consumption 
all 
imported dairy products that were on sale in Tula and Orenburg 
regions, Maritime territory, and the republics of Mariy-El and 
Tatarstan".

<F P=106> [By Oleg Padenko; from the "Pacific Ocean" program] </F>
  [Text] Vladivostok today has other problems. After our 
bothersome winter, the city needs cleaning and piles of rubbish 
removed before they become the cause of dreadful epidemics. 
This work has already begun and, as a matter of fact, quite 
intensively; however, the Sanepidstantsiya [Sanitation and 
Epidemiology Station] has not ceased to sound the alarm. 
  The problem of environmental pollution does not only concern 
the Vladivostok authorities. The Governments of Russia, South 
Korea, and Japan are quite concerned with the level of pollution 
in the Sea of Japan. The Russian scientific research vessel 
Okean, in the Japanese port of Niigata this week took aboard 
Korean and Japanese scientists, as well as an International 
Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] expert, and sailed for the first 
radioactive waste dump site. Journalist Oleg Padenko will now 
give you a more detailed report. 
  [Begin recording] [Padenko] This expedition was approved by 
the governments of the three countries whose shores are washed 
by the Sea of Japan. It is also being financed by these three 
countries and that is why it is equipped with modern equipment 
that will be taken aboard the scientific ship Okean in the 
Japanese port of Niigata, and where the Russian scientists will 
be joined by researchers from Japan and South Korea. Besides 
them, representatives of the Pacific Fleet -- the culprits of 
the piece -- as well as an observer from the IAEA will also take 
part in the research voyage. The reason for the expedition is 
known: the dumping of low radioactivity liquid wastes into the 
Sea of Japan by the Pacific Fleet in October last year, although 
our maritime neighbors have also solved such problems near their 
shores in the same way. 
  As was clarified later, our Navy dumped the polluted water 
legally, that is, with the permission of the Russian Ecology 
Ministry and in compliance with IAEA requirements. The 
radioactive waste dumping operation was observed by the 
environmental organization's vessel, Greenpeace. However, as 
they say, every cloud has a silver lining, since it served to 
make everyone once more raise the quite urgent and 
more-than-just-topical issue of environmental protection. And 
here, it is important to unite the efforts of all the sides 
concerned. The first step has been taken. To work out 
recommendations, the joint expedition aboard the Okean will 
collect samples of the sea bottom, take water samples at various 
depths, and carry out a quick analysis using a full range of 
tests to detect pollution in the sea. Well, what do the 
scientists expect from this joint work? Yuriy Nikolayevich 
Volkov, expedition leader and director of the Far East 
Hydrometeorological Institute, explains. 
  [Volkov] I am hoping for positive results from this 
expedition. That is, that the radioactivity level will be no 
higher than normal background levels; however, the experiment 
will give us the final proof. 
  [Padenko] It is apparent that you have already mixed 
somewhat with your foreign colleagues, namely the South Korean 
and Japanese specialists; tell us what do they have to say on 
this matter? What is their opinion about this voyage and the 
problem in general? 
  [Volkov] They recognize that the problem is an important one 
and that this expedition must basically reassure the public that 
the sea is ecologically clean so that ordinary folk, who watched 
television and saw the dumping of the liquid radioactive waste, 
would not be afraid to buy fish -- because it is on household 
tables daily. Nevertheless, knowing how the dumping was done 
and what level of radioactivity there was, I and, of course, the 
other scientists also think that there are no consequences. 
  [Padenko] Nevertheless, the expedition is still going? 
  [Volkov] Of course, all this is being done at the highest 
level and in compliance with international standards, so that 
all the people understand that generally there is no danger to 
people's health. Although, I reiterate that it is better not to 
dump in the first place, so that we will not have to investigate 
later. [end recording]

Khutaranskiy stating that Sverdlovsk-44, a previously secret 
town in the middle Urals, is to be renamed Novouralsk. Instead 
of defense industry products, the town has gone over to 
supplying goods for nuclear power stations at home and abroad. 
In an interview, Leonid Penskikh, head of the town's 
administration, complained that bureaucrats forced this name on 
the town's residents who wanted it to be called Verkhnevinsk as 
it is located on the river Neva. He described the communal and 
sports facilities currently being built in the town and stressed 
that all the enterprises in the town are still operating.

<F P=106> [Correspondent Andrey Shishov report: "Nizhniy Novgorod </F>
Gets New Mayor"] 
  [Text] Nizhniy Novgorod -- The new acting head of Nizhniy 
Novgorod City Administration has been named as Ivan Sklyarov, 
the kray's vice governor. The directive appointing him was 
signed by Boris Nemtsov. 
  Sklyarov replaces Dmitriy Bednyakov, whom President B. 
Yeltsin relieved of his duties for refusing to implement 
Nemtsov's instruction to cancel the referendum on Nizhniy 
Novgorod's draft charter, which, in the governor's opinion, led 
to the destabilization of the situation in the city and oblast 
and discredited the organs of power. 
  Nemtsov stated at a press conference that it had become 
impossible to work with Bednyakov. There must be strict 
discipline in the executive organs of power. Asked by 
ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA about a threat to democracy in Nizhniy 
Novgorod Oblast, the governor stressed that a threat exists, but 
to order and stability rather than democracy. It is necessary, 
Nemtsov added, to give comprehensive support to the kray's 
recently elected representative organs of power, above all the 
Oblast Legislative Assembly, in which the main attributes of a 
rule-of-law democratic society must be improved. 
  The head of Nizhniy Novgorod Administration also noted the 
need to hold a future election of the head of the self-governing 
entity of Nizhniy Novgorod in which, of course, Bednyakov can 
participate. According to Nemtsov, he is prepared to help find 
a job for Nizhniy Novgorod's former leader if Bednyakov 
approaches him with such a request. 
  Sklyarov, the new mayor of Nizhniy Novgorod, stressed that 
there will be no cardinal change in the policy of reforms, but 
adjustments will be made to them. It is necessary to restore 
everyday services to the population, which were destroyed during 
privatization. He added that he will be appearing regularly on 
television and will generally seek wider contacts with the press.

  [Text] Moscow, 4 Apr (ITAR-TASS) -- The press service of 
the Russian Federation president has sent ITAR-TASS the text of 
Boris Yeltsin's edict "On the Introduction of a State of 
Emergency on some territories of the Republic of North Ossetia 
and the Ingush Republic". The following is its full text: 
  In connection with the continuing tense situation in a 
number 
of rayons of the Republic of North Ossetia and the Ingush 
Republic, the incidence of acts of terrorism and violence, and 
the necessity of ensuring the implementation of the Russian 
Federation president's edict dated 13 December 1993 No. 2131 "On 
the Procedure for the Return to the Places of their Permanent 
Abode of Refugees and Displaced Persons on the Territories of 
the Republic of North Ossetia and the Ingush Republic," and the 
implementation of a range of measures to eliminate the armed 
conflict, endorsed by a decision of the Russian Federation 
Government dated 9 March 1994 No. 185; in connection with 
requests by the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of North Ossetia 
and the president of the Ingush Republic concerning the 
necessity for federal assistance to prevent terrorist acts, 
protect the rights of citizens and national economy facilities; 
in order to safeguard state and public security, and also in 
accordance with Article 88 of the Russian Federation 
constitution, the Russian Federation law "On the State of 
Emergency," and the Russian Federation law "On Security" I 
herewith decide: 
  1. From 1400 hours on 31 March 1994, the state of emergency 
should be revoked on the territories of Mozdokskiy rayon and 
Prigorodnyy rayon and the adjacent localities in the Republic of

rayon, and adjacent localities in the Republic of North Ossetia, 
and in Molgobekskiy and Nazranovskiy rayons in the Ingush 
Republic (hereinafter referred to as the Provisional 
Administration). 
  The Provisional Administration remains the legal successor 
of 
the provisional administration on the territories of Mozdokskiy 
rayon, Prigorodnyy rayon, and the neighboring areas of the 
Republic of North Ossetia, and of Malgobekskiy and Nazranovskiy 
rayons of the Ingush Republic, which was introduced as a special 
form of rule by the edict of the president of the Russian 
Federation No. 231 of 31 January 1994, entitled "On Extending 
the State of Emergency on the Territories of Mozdokskiy Rayon, 
Prigorodnyy Rayon, and the Neighboring Areas of the Republic of 
North Ossetia, and Malgobekskiy and Nazranovskiy Rayons of the 
Ingush Republic." 
  4. For the duration of the state of emergency: 
  -- Special rules for entering and leaving the affected area 
and special rules for travelling around should be established, 
which include checking citizens' documents; in cases when 
information has been received suggesting that citizens may be in 
possession of weapons, the rules also provide for a search of 
their personal belongings, living quarters and vehicles; 
  -- The safeguarding of public order and the protection of 
installations vital for the normal life of the population should

  -- Strikes should be banned; 
  -- Arms sales should be banned; firearms and other 
offensive weapons, ammunition, toxic and explosive substances

state of emergency, at their own expense; 
  -- Following a preliminary warning, the activities of 
political parties, public organizations, and mass movements 
hampering the normalization of the situation should be suspended; 
  -- Preliminary censorship on coverage of the events in the 
zone of the state of emergency, involving the right of seizure 
of printed material, should be introduced; 
  -- Depending on the circumstances, a curfew should be 
imposed, in other words, citizens are prohibited to remain on 
the streets and in other public places unless they have been 
supplied with special passes and documents proving their 
identity, at the established time of the day or night. 
  5. The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian 
Federation, the Federal Counterintelligence Services of the 
Russian Federation, and Defense Ministry forces of the Russian 
Federation attached to the provisional administration should 
take measures to prevent armed clashes between the opposing 
sides, to ensure the protection and safety of citizens, and to 
ensure absolute compliance with the state of emergency 
procedures. 
  6. The joint forces of the Defense Ministry of the Russian 
Federation, the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian 
Federation, the Federal Counterintelligence Services of the 
Russian Federation, and the Federal Border Services -- the Main 
Command of the Border Troops of the Russian Federation -- and 
the Federal Agency for Government Liaison and Information under 
the president of the Russian Federation, which are attached to 
the provisional administration, should be made subordinate in an 
operational sense to the head of the provisional administration. 
  7. It should be established that the instructions and orders 
of the provisional administration are binding for the execution 
of their duties by the bodies of executive power, the internal 
affairs bodies, the counterintelligence bodies, troop units, 
enterprises, organizations and establishments, and also 
officials and citizens on the territory where the state of 
emergency is in operation. 
  8. The Government of the Russian Federation: 
  -- Should ensure that the measures connected with the regime 
of the state of emergency, including financing, are implemented; 
  -- Should finance in good time and in full the measures to 
resolve comprehensively the problem of refugees and displaced 
persons; 
  -- Should ensure the continuation of talks to settle the 
conflict; 
  -- Should continue, through the provisional 
administration, to extend financial and economic assistance to 
the Republic of North Ossetia and the Ingush Republic in keeping 
with federal programs; the procedure for the extension of the 
aforementioned assistance is dependent on the progress of the 
negotiating process between these republics and the 
implementation by them of measures to have the conflict 
resolved; 
  -- Should adopt decisions to make the armed formations of 
the Republic of North Ossetia and the Ingush Republic correspond 
with their prescribed strength and also to reduce the issue of 
arms and combat equipment to the bodies of the ministries of 
internal affairs and directorates of counterintelligence of the 
Republic of North Ossetia and the Ingush Republic; 
  -- Should in April 1994 hear the accounts of the 
government of the Republic of North Ossetia and the government 
of the Ingush Republic on the work done to implement the edict 
of the president of the Russian Federation dated 13 December 
1993 No. 2131. 
  This edict comes into force upon signing. In accordance with 
Article 102 of the constitution of the Russian Federation, this 
edict is to be forwarded to the Federation Council of the 
Federal Assembly to be endorsed. 
  President of the Russian Federation B. Yeltsin.

  [Text] North Ossetian President Akhsarbek Galazov was 
pleased with the first round of Ossetian-Ingush talks that were 
held in the Kabardino-Balkarian capital Nalchik last weekend. 
He said in an Interfax interview that the talks had been held 
in a business-like atmosphere and that the two sides agree on an 
agenda and on the main lines of the final document 
  Galazov said that when the talks resumed in Nalchik on April 
13 and 14 the two sided will concentrate on the principles, 
specific steps and deadlines for carrying through the Russian 
president's decree on return of the refugees and displaced 
persons to their homes which they had been forced to leave 
during the fall 1992 hostilities. 
  Galazov added that the joint statement on mass media and the 
appeal to the people of Ingushetia and North Ossetia denouncing 
terrorism and hostage taking were virtually the first documents 
ever signed by presidents of two Russian Federation's members 
engaged in a conflict. 
  At a news conference at the end of the talks, Vladimir 
Lozovoi, head of the provisional administration in North Ossetia 
and Ingushetia, emphasized the importance of the fact that a 
final agenda had been adopted at the end of two days of 
discussion because the agenda "built in the principles, 
deadlines and steps to implement the Russian president's decree" 
while "the draft of the final document which was accepted on the 
whole recognizes the positions of the two sides." Lozovoi 
emphasized the peace brokering efforts made by Kabardino- 
Balkarian President Valery Kokov. 
  For his part, Kokov emphasized that the origins of the 
Ossetian- Ingush conflict were so deep-rooted that the conflict 
could not be resolved overnight. 
  Vyacheslav Mikhailov, Russian deputy minister of 
nationalities and regional policy, said at the news conference 
he was confident a treaty between North Ossetia and Ingushetia 
would be signed.

  [Text] Ingushi President Ruslan Aushev assessed with 
restraint the Ossetian-Ingushi summit in Nalchik last weekend. 
The talks continue and it is premature to speak about their 
results, he told Interfax Monday. 
  Deputy Russian Minister for Nationalities and Regional 
Policies, Vyacheslav Mikhailov, who took part in the talks, 
believes that the main result is in the recognition by both 
sides of the fact of human rights violations in the zone of the 
Ossetian-Ingushi conflict. In an interview with Interfax he 
said that the first step towards the solution of the problem was 
made. 
  Currently Aushev and President Akhsarbek Galazov of North 
Ossetia arrived in Moscow where the State Duma on Monday debates 
the draft address to the leaders of both neighboring republics 
due to the situation in the region.

  [Text] Deputy registration was conducted at the regular 
meeting of the oblast electoral commission for elections to the 
oblast soviet of deputies. The entire list of 34 deputies was 
considered and officially registered. 
  The next issue on the agenda was to schedule the dates for 
the elections in those 15 districts where they had not been 
held. Commission members had various proposals. Having weighed 
all the pros and cons, they decided upon the date of 30 October 
of this year. More candidates will be nominated, signatures 
will be collected, and there will be registration. Campaigning 
will begin on 1 October. 
  The district commissions could possible have the same 
members; the statute on elections allows this. When solving the 
problem of district commissions all circumstances will be taken 
into account. It cannot be ruled out that the composition of 
several of them will be changed. 
  Complaints from candidates and their authorized agents (not 
a 
single voter sent a written complaint to the commission) 
received after the election were considered at the meeting. A 
number of complaints were dismissed since they had already been 
thoroughly discussed. On that day members of the commission 
began to check out several statements. In the opinion of those 
who were asked, with respect to one or two districts the oblast 
electoral commission might possibly have to make an additional 
decision, that is, the elections could be declared null and void.

<F P=106> [Article by A. Zharinov: "We Have 34 Deputies, We Shall </F>
Elect the Rest in the Fall"] 
  [Text] The overall results of the elections to the 
Novosibirsk Oblast Soviet of Deputies were made public by the 
chairman of the oblast electoral commission, L.N. Ustinova, on 
Wednesday at a news conference. 
  She reminded the journalists that 202 candidates had been 
registered for 49 deputy positions. On 27 March 662,996 voters, 
or 33.6 percent of those included on the lists, expressed their 
attitude toward the contenders for the deputy mandate. In the 
rayons of the oblast 47 percent of the voters voted, and in the 
cities under oblast jurisdiction (Berdsk, Iskitim, Kuybyshev, 
Tatarsk, and Barabinsk)--31.6 percent, including 
Novosibirsk--25.1 percent. 
  The overall number of invalid ballots (incorrectly filled 
out, damaged, etc.) was 54,697. A total of 69,113 people voted 
against all the candidates. 
  Where were the elections held and who earned the confidence 
of the voters? The elections were declared to have been 
conducted in 34 single-mandate districts. These were mainly 
rural districts. In 15 districts of Novosibirsk the elections 
were not held because of low voter turnout. Let us mention these 
districts: Nos. 22 and 25 (Dzerzhinskiy Rayon), No. 28 
(Zheleznodorozhnyy Rayon), No. 33 (Kalininskiy Rayon), Nos. 35, 
36, and 37 (Kirovskiy Rayon), Nos. 38, 39, 40, 41, and 49 
(Leninskiy Rayon), Nos. 42 and 44 (Oktyabrskiy Rayon), and No. 
47 (Sovetskiy Rayon). Repeat elections were scheduled for 30 
October in these rayons. 
  And so, the new representative power in the oblast is 
embodied by 34 deputies so far. What is the social, political, 
and occupational portrait of the new deputy corps? They are 
mature people who have learned from life's experience. As can be 
seen from an official questionnaire, they are "up to 55 years of 
age." Undoubtedly there are young ones as well. But the fact 
that altogether they are "up to 55" inspires hope and promise. 
Incidentally, of those who were elected, 11 are former people's 
deputies of the oblast soviet, which creates continuity in the 
activity of the representative organ. 
  The elections confirmed the misgivings on the part of 
political parties and public movements concerning the desire of 
representatives of executive structures to enter the oblast 
soviet. Twelve heads of local administrations became deputies 
(almost one- third of the deputy mandates) and, naturally, they 
will basically determine the fate of any particular resolution 
considered by the soviet. Added to them are 10 leaders of 
industrial and agricultural enterprises who will probably defend 
departmental interests in the soviet. 
  Among the other deputies, one represents public health and 
four-- public education, VUZ's [higher educational 
institutions], and scientific institutions. Notice that there is 
not a single worker, kolkhoz worker, or construction worker 
here. Just as there is not a single specialist with a higher 
legal education or representative of culture or business. This 
could cause some harm to the composition of the deputy corps, 
which may not represent the interests of many social groups. 
Suffice it to say that among the 34 deputies there is only one 
woman--chief engineer of the Suzunskaya Furniture Factory, V. 
Usova. There were considerably more of them in the last soviet. 
  And, finally, about the political preferences of the voters. 
Only three representatives of political parties and movements 
earned deputy mandates: two (V. Kuznetsov and V. Karpov)--from 
the CPRF [Communist Party of the Russian Federation], and one 
(N. Krasnikov)--from Russia's Choice. It turns out that it makes 
no difference to the voter whether the candidate is "red" or 
"white." As long as he is a good person. 
  But still the main thing should be emphasized: Elections to 
the oblast soviet of deputies did take place. And in keeping 
with the law on the kray and oblast soviets, the kray and oblast 
administration: "The soviet shall function if two-thirds of the 
deputies have been elected to it." We have that number of 
deputies and they can hold a session at which they will elect a 
chairman and a deputy, working organs, and commissions. 
Apparently this will take place in the near future. 
  More detailed information about the results of the voting 
and 
the elected deputies will be published in the next few issues of 
SOVETSKAYA SIBIR.

  [Text] Irkutsk, 5 Apr -- All 45 deputies to the Irkutsk 
Oblast legislative assembly have been deemed elected following 
the 27 March elections. This was made possible only after the 
Russian Central Electoral Commission provided an explanation of 
the elections, according to which the ballot is deemed valid if 
no fewer than 25 percent of voters turn out. 
  Irkutsk used to have an electoral statute, according to 
which 
the figure -- set by the Siberians themselves -- was 35 percent. 
If that had been the case, the 27 March elections would have 
had to be declared invalid in several constituencies.

  [Text] Runoff parliamentary elections were held in 34 
Ukrainian precincts where over half of the voters came to the 
polling stations Saturday and Sunday. 
  In 27 precincts the voting results were made known to 
INTERFAX-Ukraine by the election commissions, 17 independents, 
six communists and one socialist were elected. The list of new 
deputies includes Agriculture Minister Yuriy Karasik and prime 
minister's adviser Viktor Suslov. 
  No candidate obtained more than half the votes in three of 
these precincts. Another round of elections will be held there. 
  Out of the 73 new members of parliament 18 are communists, 
three socialists, two are members of the Peasants' Party and 12 
represent national democratic and national radical 
organizations. The remainder campaigned as independents. 
  Runoff elections will be held in the remaining 367 Ukrainian 
precincts on 9 and 10 April.

  [Text] Renewed elections to the Ukrainian parliament were 
held in 29 out of 33 electoral districts at the weekend. Latest 
counts indicate that the Communists and Socialists have won 
eight and two seats respectively with 19 other mandates going to 
independent candidates, officials of the district election 
commissions told INTERFAX-Ukraine. 
  However, a fresh election is to be held in the four 
remaining 
districts where none of the candidates has managed to get 50 
percent of the vote needed to qualify. 
  By now 78 candidates have gained mandates to the new 
parliament, 20 of them Communists, four Socialists and two of 
the Peasants Party. This brings to 26 the number of left-wing 
candidates who have won seats to the country's new legislature 
compared with about 15 seats won by members of the nationalist 
groups. Other winners claim to be independent. 
  A new round of voting to the country's 450-seat parliament 
will be held in the remaining 368 districts on Saturday and 
Sunday.

<F P=106> [Interview with Serhiy Osyka, Ukrainian deputy minister for </F>
external economic relations, by Volodymyr Skachko; place and 
date not given: "Ukraine and the International Market: How To 
Build Bridges" -- first paragraph is HOLOS UKRAYINY 
introduction published in italics; questions published in 
boldface] 
  [Text] Since the time when Ukraine was proclaimed an 
independent state and immediately recognized as such by Western 
states, the first delights caused by these events should have 
been replaced by more day-to-day concerns. However, it should 
be admitted that these problems have not diminished since then, 
but, as it seems, have only been aggravated. Nonetheless, 
according to competent people, possibilities for the 
normalization of Ukraine's external economic relations have not 
yet been exhausted. We have asked Serhiy Osyka, Ukraine's 
deputy minister for external economic relations, to tell us 
about current economic relations between Ukraine and the West. 
  [Osyka] Let us look at things objectively -- many problems 
facing Ukraine's gaining a strong foothold in Western markets 
are caused not by economic factors, but by political ones. 
  I will give only one example, but an exponential one. If one 
were to analyze the course of events connected with the problem 
of assets and liabilities of the former Soviet Union, one may 
discern an essential unbalance between Western countries' 
positions on this issue. 
  This past year's decision by the Paris Club to defer the 
debts of the former USSR, in general, took into account only 
Russia's interests. The point is that the assets of the former 
USSR are still working only for Russia. However, these assets 
belonged formerly to all republics of the Union, including 
Ukraine. To assess more clearly how this affects our state 
interests, let us recall that these assets include the debt 
obligations of many countries of the former USSR (amounting to 
almost $100 billion), which may be used as stocks and bonds on 
international share markets; they also include a great deal of 
immovable property abroad, as well as know-how and technology, 
primarily in the branch of precision machine building; lastly, 
they include trademarks and brands, which bring in many millions 
[currency not specified] in income. 
  A few more concrete examples. 
  As a result of Ukraine's undergoing the routine of controls 
over space technologies, according to many politicians, the 
situation has become inequitable. A package of Russian 
agreements related to the joining of an international space 
program are being implemented to a large extent (practically 80 
percent) by Ukrainian industry. First of all, these are such 
systems as "Zenith" and "Tsyklon," which are being produced in 
Ukraine. 
  The second example: The Plodimport foreign trade association 
of the former USSR has automatically become Russia's foreign 
trade association. However, at one time in the past, the 
Plodimport production association sold the exclusive rights to 
use its trademark to the Pepsico company for a period of 20 
years. This is an asset, too. 
  Stolichnaya vodka has been produced with the significant 
participation of Ukrainian enterprises. Its trademark is one of 
the assets of the former USSR, as well. By now, this trademark 
is used by Russia only -- this means that we are cut off from 
this particular export market. However, annual profits for this 
export are measured in the billions. 
  One more example: In 1992, President Yeltsin authorized 
sales of the Topaz-2 satellite system. The world was astonished 
by both this resolution and the ridiculously low asking price. 
Notwithstanding the fact that all the enterprises of the Topaz 
association are located in Ukraine, the Paris Club regarded 
their production as an asset of the former USSR. In this way, 
Ukraine is being cut off from markets which provide profits of 
many billions for goods and technology produced by generations 
of Ukrainian citizens. 
  These are very essential limitations placed on the markets, 
from which Ukraine could draw money for its own work, instead of 
resolving its financial problems solely by means of credit. 
  Thus, as you see, the worsening of the country's internal 
situation is connected with rather essential international 
factors, even though I do not exclude such reasons for our 
crisis as our legislative mistakes and many other problems which 
have been widely reported. However, without overcoming these 
negative external political factors, no resolute actions by the 
government and no new laws, on their own, will help us resolve 
this heap of problems. 
  [Skachko] Serhiy Hryhorovych, these reasons, of which you 
has just spoken, cannot be easily managed. However, there are 
various internal problems in Ukraine, which are connected with 
exports and imports, are there not? 
  [Osyka] One of the principal factors influencing the 
financial sphere and the stability of hard currency exchange 
rates is the following: The export capacity [eksportoyemnost] 
of Ukrainian industry and economy is much lower than our import 
capacity. Up to 1991, as you know, this problem was resolved at 
the expense of the USSR's export capacity. 
  Our exports today are only a part of Ukraine's full export 
potential. They are practically incapable of securing our need 
for hard currency to upkeep the stable exchange rate of our 
currency; in addition, they secure our import needs only to the 
lowest degree, even in their most vital part. Ukraine's 
traditional exports are ferrous metals, chemical products, 
textile fabrics, and certain other goods. However, these very 
exports are faced with a sharp increase in production costs, 
which brings practically to naught the hard currency 
profitability of these products. 
  For instance, fertilizer. The production of one tonne of 
carbimide or ammonia requires about one tonne of gas. Gas is 
priced at least at $65-70 per tonne, while carbimide is sold, 
depending on the season, at $75-100 per tonne. It is quite 
obvious that this product is becoming unprofitable. At the very 
best, output can be equal to input. Taking into account the 
energy-consuming production of metals (gas and coke are also 
involved), we see that the picture is much the same. 
  Many products of the machine-building industry, especially 
new technologies as well as many products connected with 
machine-building services and installations, either are not 
allowed to enter external markets due to political reasons, or 
are again being considered as part of the former USSR assets. 
  It should be no surprise to you that innumerable Ukrainian 
enterprises had been included in the closed production and 
technology cycles of the USSR. What was a production 
cooperative earlier, now must be restored by Ukraine on trade 
basis. It is, mind you, trade with imports. 
  The consequence of all these factors is very simple: The 
export capacity, which is much lower that the import capacity, 
implies a hard-currency deficit. Due to such a situation -- 
regardless of whether mechanisms for regulating currency 
exchange rates include the policy of stock exchange sales -- the 
demand for hard currency always surpasses supply. This 
difficult situation makes it impossible to maintain a stable 
exchange rate by traditional methods (for instance, by National 
Bank interventions). We need a stabilization fund exceeding the 
demand for hard currency in a traditional situation to make use 
of Ukraine's full economic potential. Due to this situation, it 
is vitally important that we resolve a number of political and 
legal problems, in other words, to create a new legal area for 
the activity of Ukrainian entrepreneurs. Believe me, we are not 
sitting idly by. 
  One of the principal directions is our active movement 
toward 
joining the GATT. Professionals, who are working on this 
endeavor (I am one of the heads of this group), assess the 
situation realistically. 
  [Skachko] Serhiy Hryhorovych, you headed Ukraine's 
delegation to last year's GATT talks. What were the results of 
those talks? 
  [Osyka] At that meeting, the GATT Council of Representatives 
approved a resolution on the creation of a working group for 
preparing a memorandum on Ukraine's joining GATT. Work on this 
document is still continuing. What kind of document is it? 
First of all, it is a detailed description of Ukraine's 
legislation connected directly or indirectly with various forms 
of foreign economic activity; in the first place, it is related 
to issues of foreign trade, administrative stages, custom 
duties, and tariffs. This is not simply a description of our 
laws; the memorandum is to include not only legislative bases, 
but also sublegislative [pidzakonny], departmental acts which 
constitute four-fifths of our legislative foundation. However, 
it is not all, either. The GATT document is to include a 
detailed analysis of the legislative situation in general, as 
well as, if necessary, additional explanations from individual 
points of view. 
  We are asking GATT to grant us preferential status [rezhym], 
that is, the status of a country with a transforming economy. 
The memorandum is to supply the foundation underlaying a GATT 
resolution on our country. In fact, regardless of the talks on 
joining GATT, work on the memorandum is a good opportunity for 
ourselves to become familiar with the particulars of the 
law-governed state which we have today. Ukraine's second step 
toward joining GATT is in bringing its legislation in line with 
world standards, even if only to a minimal degree. It is a 
necessary condition for us to be equal trading partners with the 
world. There is a great mass of legislative work which must be 
carried out on a highly professional level. I would like to 
believe that a new parliament will include professionals who 
will be up to this task.

With the United States Which Is Unfavorable for Ukraine"] 
  [Text] According to People's Deputy Vitaliy Polyakh, chief 
agricultural adviser to the Ukrainian president, Agriculture and 
Food Minister Yuriy Karasyk signed an "unfavorable for Ukraine 
contract for $20 million" during his visit to the United States. 
According to this deal, Ukraine will receive 70,000 tonnes of 
soya at a considerably higher price than in Europe. Vitaliy 
Polyakh believes that Ukraine will have to repay $20 million 
over some seven years. "Instead of buying technology and 
equipment, we are following the path of banana republics," said 
Vitaliy Polyakh.

Apr 94] 
  [Text] A consortium of US firms (TFPS) is reported to have 
drafted a comprehensive program for US industrial applications 
of Paton-designed electronic-beam vapor-coating spray 
technologies. This technology is said to be a dual-purpose one 
allowing both civilian and military applications. 
  The program is divided into two parts, each embracing a 
two-year period, and provides for acquisition of Paton 
technologies through the agency of the US University for Unified 
Research Partner Relations. 
  The Ukrainian Institute's technology is preliminary 
evaluated 
at 10 million dollars. Its application financial effect on 
seven branches of the US national economy, as American experts 
believe, may be in excess of 7 billion dollars within a decade 
with total implementation costs estimated at 10 million dollars. 
  The impressive project's implementation is supposed to 
require establishment of several joint ventures for promotion of 
Paton's technology in the US engineering, shipbuilding, 
aerospace and automaking industries, as well as in the nuclear 
power and medical industries and sport accessories manufacture. 
  In April 1993, the Paton Institute signed an agreement with 
Pratt &amp; Whitney (United Technology Corp.'s division) to set 
up a 
joint venture [jv] for space manufacture of metals and ceramics, 
which is hardly feasible under the earth conditions. The jv's 
aggregate authorized fund is stated at one billion US dollars 
with each party's 50 per cent share in it. The Ukrainian 
party's contribution is expressed in its specialized equipment, 
production areas and intellectual property. 
  Pratt &amp; Whitney, whose main speciality is aircraft, 
particularly, Boeing, engine design and construction, supplied a 
part of the equipment and did the bulk of financing. 
  Within the project's framework a research center will be set 
up in Kiev to develop new space material manufacture 
technologies based on the processes underlying electronic-beam 
vapor-coating spraying. Originally the US side contemplated its 
participation in the center's work during a five-year period. 
After it scrutinized the center's R&amp;D the US party signed an 
agreement in February 1994 extending the period to another five 
year term. 
  In January 1994, the jv's R&amp;D center, which employs 
about 30 
fellow researchers in Kiev, was complemented with a pilot 
production facility staffed by over 50-strong personnel, which 
is a former workshop of a special electric metallurgical 
factory, Mikhail Koklyuchenko, jv C.E.O., disclosed in an 
interview to UKRINFORM. 
  This pilot facility has embarked on specimen manufacture of 
some materials intended for spraying metallic and ceramic 
durable coatings. 
  According to Mr. Koklyuchenko, their serial production will 
start in 1994 to continue in several years to come. As he 
maintains, they will find broad and versatile applications in 
both Ukraine and the USA, in view of which the jv expects 
numerous contracts to be signed shortly for their supplies. 
  The Yevgeniy Paton Arc Welding Institute under the Ukrainian 
Academy of Sciences was founded back in 1924, and has been among 
the world's leaders in this field ever since. 
  The electron-beam technology has been developed and improved 
for over two decades by now. 
  In addition to its numerous and broad fundamental studies 
the 
Institute has performed minor applied researches in arc welding 
engineer, as well as equipment and material manufacture for its 
multitudinous domestic and foreign customers. 
  The Paton Institute's ramified substructure includes the 
Institute per se, which focuses on major research and 
fundamental theoretical studies, a pilot plant for arc welding 
equipment manufacture and specimen trials, a pilot plant for 
welding materials and technology testing, a pilot plant for 
special electric metallurgical engineering applications, a 
design and technological bureau with a pilot facility, and six 
engineering centers. 
  Initially, the jv's authorized fund amounted to about 60,000 
dollars with each party's share of 50 per cent. 
  Patonweld experts suggested four marketing directions to 
sell 
Ukrainian technologies internationally. In late 1993, AT&amp;T 
made 
and delivered specifically ordered 18 tons of powder for 
tear-resistant coatings to the partners. 
  To implement the jv's projects the Ukrainian party resorted 
to the services of the Torez factory of fusion coatings in the 
Donetsk region. (There were only two such factories in the 
former Soviet Union. The other one was located in Russia's Tula 
near Moscow). 
  Presently, Patonweld is said to have manufactured 40 tons of 
special powders. 
  However, as Petr Kuznetsov, the jv's spokesperson, tipped 
off 
to UKRINFORM, recently changed export procedures and 
introduction of the so-called specifically designated exporters 
hamper powder shipment to the jv's customers abroad. Averaged 
world market prices for such powders based on high-carbon 
compounds are about 1,200 USD per ton. 
  As Mr. Kuznetsov tends to believe, the jv's future activity 
will hinge on precisely exports of domestically designed and 
manufactured materials and products.

Apr 94] 
  [Text] In accordance with the President's Decree of 
October 1993 "On State Contract and State Order for 1994" the 
Ministry of agriculture and foodstuffs of Ukraine, together with 
other involved ministries, departments and agencies, drafted 
schemes and mechanisms for forming the state's stock's of 
agricultural products and raw materials in 1994. 
  The State Contract envisages procurement of 14 million tons 
of grain, 1.56 million tons of oil crop seeds (basically, 
sunflower seed), 25 million tons of white beet roots. Under the 
state's agreements with agricultural growers and producers the 
state's centralized fund is to stock 703,000 tons of meat and 
meat products, 1,960 million eggs, 4,140,000 tons of milk and 
dairy products, 636,000 tons of potatoes, 434,000 tons of 
vegetables, other products and raw materials. 
  To make the State Contract materialize, the producers should 
be paid 38.8 trillion karbovanets. 
  As Nikolay Solodki, chief of the Ministry's Main Agency for 
food resources, disclosed at a Collegium meeting, as of March 28 
contracts were concluded with Ukraine's agricultural producers 
(collective and state farms) to the tune of 32 trillion 
karbovanets. 
  Under the contracts' terms 25 per cent of the 
contract-specified sums are payable within 10 days. However, 
the farms were paid only 4.2 trillion karbovanets including 2.5 
trillion karbovanets in short-term (up to 90 days) credits, 
which cannot but have a braking effect on the vernal sowing 
campaign's progress. 
  Ukraine's state stocks of agricultural products are 
estimated 
currently at 4.2 trillion karbovanets. However, their 
realization domestically or marketing abroad are hampered by too 
high prices, which exceed twofold the world market's averaged 
ones, which questions earning the required sums. 
  Ukrainian Minister for agriculture and foodstuffs Yuri 
Karasik attributes these too high agricultural product prices to 
unwarranted fuel price raises, particularly in 1993's second 
semester, when Ukrainian fuel prices exceeded the world market's 
averaged ones fivefold (at about 18 million karbovanets per ton 
of oil), allegedly due to the Ukrainian oil refineries' low 
performance in deep processing of crude petroleum. 
  This year, however, the Ukrainian government is reported to 
have solved the problem of purchasing a part of necessary fuels 
abroad at prices not exceeding 140 USD per ton. 
  No state loans are envisaged in 1994 and no credits will be 
granted to support the State Order, Nikolai Golub, 
vice-president of the "Ukraina" agrobank, said speaking at the 
Agricultural Ministry Collegium's session.

Apr 94] 
  [Text] Since December 1993 NBU [National Bank of Ukraine] 
has invariably succeeded in keeping its major pledge for 
inflation monthly rates under 20 percent, NBU president Viktor 
Yushchenko said at a press conference on 1 April, though, as he 
had to admit the goal's attainment involved non-monetary moves 
on the government's insistence, aimed at ruling out the 
inflation effect of monetary emissions by the National Bank of 
Ukraine. 
  Meanwhile, the inflation rate under 20 per cent a month 
automatically makes NBU's refinancing rates (at 240 per cent 
annual interest rate) positive, which Mr. Yushchenko considers 
the most beneficial factor under the present circumstances. 
  As NBU vice-president Igor Mityukov noted, the bank's major 
objective in the monetary regulation domain has been to create 
the essential prerequisites for evolving a real currency market 
in Ukraine, since presently this market is absolutely 
centralized. 
  However, as Mr. Mityukov further noted, Ukraine's financial 
structures were technically able to function in an absolutely 
decentralized currency market environment back in August 1993. 
  Since then the government has taken a series of rigid 
administrative moves tightening its grip on currency 
regulations. These included, in particular, imposition of a 
mandatory sale by exporter enterprises of 50 per cent of their 
hard currency earnings at the NBU-fixed rates, as well as 
suspended hard currency trading by the Interbank Currency 
Exchange and the Ukrainian karbovanets fixed rate. 
  Despite inflation, NBU has to work under the fixed 
karbovanets rate conditions, which results in multiple rates for 
the Ukrainian karbovanets. Thus, to prop up the engineering, 
coal-mining industries and agriculture their relevant ministries 
will be allowed to purchase hard currency earned through exports 
of their enterprises' products at the 30,000 krb.:1 USD rate 
instead of the official rate of 12,610 krb.:1 USD. 
  Meanwhile, hard currency acquisition through tenders and 
auctions (Ukraine's sole legal source of non-cash currency 
purchases), will be allowed, same as before, only for purposes, 
which the government's officers deign to consider as expedient 
(purchasing fuels, timber, medicines, for instance). 
<H5>  Relations with International Financial Institutions </H5>
  Granting credits by the World Bank, IMF and other 
international financial institutions involves Ukraine's strict 
observance of certain commitments and requirements, primarily 
its economic reform's efficacy. 
  In Mr. Mityukov's opinion, this agreement allows the West to 
indefinitely and rather arbitrarily delay credit granting to 
Ukraine, though such credits could be very helpful in creating 
the stabilization fund for Ukraine's new monetary unit. 
Meanwhile, Ukraine's economic stabilization would allow the 
nation to apply foreign credits to other than pressing needs, 
purposes. 
  As Mr. Mityukov disclosed, an agreement was reached with IMF 
experts on the correctness of the national monetary unit's 
regulated rate vis-a-vis absent currency exchange operations, 
necessary to define it. However, they remain adamant in their 
demand to abolish multiple karbovanets rates. 
<H5>  Relations With Russia </H5>
  Ukraine has not abandoned hope for settling with Russia the 
sensitive issue of sharing the late USSR's assets and 
liabilities. 
  Negotiations to this effect have not been successful, so 
far, 
with Russia having declared itself the USSR's sole legal 
successor and denying Ukraine's right to use the USSR's assets 
and service its debt. 
  According to Mr. Mityukov, by the time the USSR 
disintegrated its assets were composed of 74 billion foreign 
currency rubles (one such ruble was roughly equal to 1.5 USD) in 
credits granted to developing nations, 47 to 48 billion rubles 
in debts of the former COMECON nations, 3.5 billion rubles in 
realty and property abroad, and 295 tons of gold. 
  The USSR's gross debt amounted to 81 billion dollars and 
17.3 
billion rubles to COMECON nations. 
  In addition to the problem of sharing the former USSR's 
assets and liabilities Ukraine has been trying to push Russia to 
extinguishing internal currency indebtedness, which in Mr. 
Mityukov's opinion, should be the Russian Finance Ministry's 
responsibility and task. 
  According to NBU estimates, the Soviet Vneshekonombank owes 
400 million dollars to Ukrainian natural person-citizens, while 
other banks of the former USSR owe 81.5 million dollars for 
exported Ukrainian grain plus 25 million dollars in Ukrainian 
collective farms' means. 
<H5>  Foreign Banks' Operations in Ukraine </H5>
  Igor Mityukov tends to believe that foreign banks' activity 
in Ukraine cannot significantly improve the national financial 
system. Foreign bank affiliates in Ukraine employ predominantly 
Ukrainian personnel, and their operations are executed within a 
very narrow field. 
  The only bank, out of eight foreign banks established in 
Ukraine, whose presence is tangible on the Ukrainian market , is 
the First Ukrainian International Bank. However, it utilizes 
sizeable state capital. 
  Thus, as the NBU vice-president asserts, the National Bank's 
decision to limit the foreign banks' scope of activity to only 
non-residents, was a justified and well-grounded one.

<F P=106> [From the "Business News Weekly" feature No. 14, 28 Mar-3 </F>
Apr 94] 
  [Text] According to a press release by the Ukrainian 
Ministry of statistics, dated 28 March 1994, Ukraine's national 
income in 1993 is tentatively estimated at 98.4 trillion krb. 
Its absolute growth amounted to 94.5 trillion krb. with the 
nominal growth in factual prices versus 1992 exceeding 25 times, 
exclusively due to the price factor (wholesale and retail price 
growths for commodities and tariffs growths for services). 
  The price factor also affected the structure of national 
income in factual prices. Thus, the share of net produce in 
total industrial output increased from 49 per cent in 1992 to 
52.2 per cent in 1993, while the same parameter in agriculture 
dropped from 19.7 to 16.4 per cent. Industrial commodity prices 
grew 41-fold versus a 32-fold growth for agricultural products. 
  In comparable prices, national income's branch structure 
break-down appears different with industrial products' share 
having diminished from 49 to 48.8 per cent and that of 
agricultural products having increased by 3.3 points to amount 
to 23 per cent. 
  In 1993, national income decline rates somewhat decelerated, 
and amounted to 15 per cent versus 18 per cent the year before. 
Basically, this was due to decelerated reductions in 
construction, agricultural production and lower material 
consumption by certain branches of Ukraine's national economy. 
  Industrial net product output's reductions (by 15.6 per 
cent) 
were particularly adverse for national income, which were caused 
by a 7.6 per cent reduction in total industrial output and 
increased by 3.7 per cent material consumption. Beginning with 
1993's second semester over a half of Ukraine's industrial 
enterprises reduced their production. 
  Over the entire year, the bulk of these had to work under 
the 
very unfavorable conditions created by growing fuel and energy 
shortages. Thus, almost all the industrial branches reduced 
their production. 
  In 1993, construction and mounting works dropped by 9 per 
cent, which resulted in the construction industry's reduced 
total output by 8.7 per cent. Since material expenditures and 
costs reduced at a slower pace (by 8 per cent), the industry's 
net produce dropped by 9.2 per cent. 
  Total agricultural output reduced by 1.5 per cent with 
specific consumption of materials having dropped by 1.4 per 
cent, which resulted in net product output reduced by only 0.6 
per cent. 
  Negative processes were aggravated by steeply raised fuel 
prices and undersupplies of imported fuels in December 1993. 
GNP and national income over this period versus 1992 were as 
follows (in comparable prices, per cent).

<F P=106> ["Commonly Shared Problems of Ukraine's and Russia's Gas </F>
Industry Alleviate Russian Gas Supply Problem" -- UKRINFORM 
headline; From the "Business News Weekly" feature No. 14, 28 Mar 
- 3 Apr 94] 
  [Text] According to official information released by the 
Ukrgazprom (Ukraine's Gas Industry) concern, over the last week 
both the Russian and Ukrainian sides fully met their commitments 
involving natural gas supplies. 
  Ukraine's gas piping agencies are reported to have made more 
orderly Russian natural gas exports to Europe, while Russia's 
gas suppliers were similarly punctual in supplying natural gas 
to Ukraine both for themselves and for Turkmenistan to 
compensate for the latter's discontinued supplies. 
  For some objective reasons, the issue of suspended natural 
gas supplies by Russia to Ukraine has been deleted from the 
agenda. Or, more specifically, no emphasis is placed on the 
major underlying reason, which is Ukraine's fuel indebtedness. 
At least, now it has become obvious that the Russo-Ukrainian 
controversy, which the media used to interpret as the fuel 
indebtedness problem, lies in the status of major gas and 
petroleum pipe-lines, which have largely fallen within Ukraine's 
jurisdiction after the former Soviet Union's disintegration, 
though this fact is not at all tantamount to division of the 
formerly integral pipe-line system and Russia's tacit agreement 
with this. So, while persistently and actively overstating its 
warnings about natural gas supply suspension the Russian side is 
well aware of its virtual inability to make the threats 
materialize, Ukraine's unpaid fuel debt to Russia 
notwithstanding. 
  Since the latest Moscow agreement, under which Ukraine had 
to 
start repaying its debt and at least pay for the 1994 first 
quarter's supplies with hard currency, Ukraine has factually 
repaid about 46 million dollars, which is less than a half of 
the sum subject to payment, according to Russia's Gazprom 
sources. 
  The Ukrainian government's subsequent March decision on 
lists 
of enterprises and amounts of commodities they should supply to 
Russia by way of repaying Ukraine's fuel debt, as well as the 
endorsed scheme for settling, may be viewed as just another 
palliative resolution among a series of five, which the 
Ukrainian Cabinet approved over the past six months. As 
analysts believe, it will be as inefficient, as its predecessors 
were. 
  Ukraine's, or more specifically, the Ukrainian State 
Committee's for oil and gas, major headache is the problem of 
internal non- payment. The above decisions, as well as the 
imposed rule of pre- payment starting with April 1, have all 
invariably threatened to discontinue natural gas supplies to 
debtor consumer-enterprises. To a certain extent, such threats 
can be carried out by Ukrgazprom and Ukrgaz against Ukrainian 
consumer enterprises. At least, Ukrzarubezhneftegaz 
spokespersons (this agency is in charge of control over mutual 
settling in line with the latest governmental resolution) hope 
that the threats, coupled with other administrative moves, which 
are provided for by the resolution, will succeed in repayment of 
the debt's major portion. 
  All the administrative pressure notwithstanding, Ukraine's 
metallurgical and chemical enterprises are reported as highly 
reluctant to comply with the government's strict order to remit 
their currency accounts to only the state-owned Export-Import 
Bank. The government's stratagem is too transparent and provides 
for imposing the state's total and rigid control over export 
enterprises' hard currency incomings with a view of channeling 
them to repayment of Ukraine's fuel debt. 
  The Ukrainian State Committee for oil and gas is said to pin 
its hopes on imposition of a rigid mechanism of payments for 
imported fuels to extinguish the internal debt, which may be 
implemented by the newly established Ukrneftegaz (Ukraine's Oil 
and Gas) National Joint-Stock Company of the holding type. 
Assuming the status of though state-run, yet monopolist in the 
field of fuel supplies, the National Joint-Stock Company is 
largely expected to realize its claims. 
  However as the Russian Gazprom association's experience may 
suggest, the hope is hard to materialize, since Russia's Gazprom 
has been acting in a similar manner toward intra-Russian gas 
consumers and under conditions, very much similar to those of 
Ukrgazprom. 
  The Russo-Ukrainian "debts should be repaid" dispute (as 
Ukraine's acting prime-minister Zvyagilski once put it) has 
ripened enough to assume the form of mutual proposals and 
compromises. For objective reasons, Russia cannot drastically 
curtail its natural gas supplies to Ukraine. Gas exports to 
West Europe have shrunk with spring's onset, firstly. The 
supply schedule for Ukraine, though it virtually exceeds the 
domestic requirements, will not be a weighty argument, since 
these gas supplies are basically intended for piping them to 
underground storages. 
  Russia's natural gas extractors cannot significantly curtail 
their extraction, either, purely for technical reasons, which 
makes them look for ways to dispose of the extracted natural gas 
somehow. 
  Besides, reduced natural gas piping may further compromise 
the already deteriorated major gas pipe-lines, which the Russian 
side has to admit. Ukraine's formal ownership of the pipe-lines 
does not relieve Russia of troubles involved in maintaining them 
technically operational. Ukraine is similarly interested in 
their good operational condition. Thus, Russia has to share the 
burden of operational costs involved in maintaining Ukraine's 
segment of the gas pipe-line system, which links Russian gas 
exporters with their West European customers. 
  In view of this one cannot but admit as quite rational 
Russia's bid to own a part of the vital gas export 
infrastructure, which is located in Ukraine. The latter, while 
not rejecting Russia's claim outright, appears in no hurry to 
meet it. Probably, this fact could be attributed to Ukraine's 
domestic economic troubles and its petroleum and gas industry's 
restructuring. 
  The Ukrainian side has apparently been doing its best to 
postpone the final decision on Russia's co-ownership having 
repeatedly promised Russia to sell stocks to be issued by 
Ukrainian gas and oil industry enterprises, which are supposed 
to undergo conversion into joint-stock societies, to Russian 
related enterprises. However, these promises may be rendered 
void by the privatization process, if it follows the pattern, 
which is supposed to be approved for the Ukrainian oil and gas 
industry. 
  Meanwhile, the CIS integral gas distribution system remains 
operational with the bulk of it in Russia's possession. So, it 
is Russia, who bears the burden of its operational costs. In 
late March Moscow was the venue of a sitting convened by 
Gazprom's Council for R&amp;D and technologies, which discussed 
progress made in implementing the Highly Reliable Piping 
Transport Program. Academician Boris Paton, director of the Ye. 
Paton Arc Welding Research Institute, made a major speech. 
This fact and Ukraine's great contribution to this and other 
projects involving gas piping, may unambiguously and eloquently 
testify to both commonly shared by Ukraine and Russia problems 
and the integral quality of the major gas pipe-line 
infrastructure. 
  The above Program was adopted in 1991 by the then Union 
government. Its practical implementation started a year later. 
  The now independent governments of Russia and Ukraine 
articulated their support for it as an intergovernmental 
project. However, Ukraine had to drastically reduce its 
financing, though R&amp;D efforts continued. The Program is said 
to 
contain nine major R&amp;D directions. However, their 
implementation is now jeopardized. The Ukrainian party is 
reported as intending to complete and implement on its own the 
Program's Ukrainian section, which is but too logical 
considering some most recent international projects in this 
field. 
  Under the former USSR since the late 1960s about 22,000 to 
26,000 km. of gas pipe-lines were annually commissioned 
including some 15,000 km. of major gas pipe-lines. 
  According to the Gazprom Council, in the late 1970s-early 
1980s annual gas extraction increments of 40 billion cu. m. and 
more dictated construction of a high-capacity and superlong 
major pipe-line. Thus, high-pressure 1,420 mm. diameter gas 
pipe-lines were constructed. Over 50,000 km. of these were 
constructed in the Russian Federation alone. 
  The CIS major gas pipe-line system is 220,000 km. long with 
compressor stations' aggregate power of 50 million kW. 
  According to Russia's Gazprom, Russia operates 138,500 km. 
of 
major gas pipe-lines, 48,000 km. of major oil pipe-lines under 
the Transneft Company, and 13,000 km. of major petroleum product 
pipe- lines under the Transnefteprodukt company. 
  Many of these are used to pipe up to 250 billion cu. m. of 
natural gas a year from West Siberian fields to Europe. Some of 
these pipe as much as over 340 billion cu. m. of gas. Major 
pipe-lines cross railroads and highways in 15,000 cases, and 
water arteries in 2,000 cases, which makes their reliability and 
safety problem a vital and obvious one. 
  Their wear and tear poses great environmental pollution 
risks, since 25 per cent of gas pipe-lines have been operational 
for over 20 years, 38 per cent for between 10 and 20 years and 5 
per cent have surpassed the limit of 33 years. 
  According to Gazprom, in 1993 there were 30 cases of 
pipe-line destruction. Compared to most developed nations, the 
number is not great. However, the pipe-lines' aging and failure 
to meet the European standards coupled with inadequate control 
over their technical safety may adversely affect the unified CIS 
- West European gas supply system.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ukrainian Ambassador to Russia Volodymyr </F>
Kryzhanivskyy by Viktor Tkachuk; place and date not given: 
"Volodymyr Kryzhanivskyy: `If You Do Not Start Controversy 
Around Our Russians, Nobody Will Harass Them'"] 
  [Text] [Tkachuk] Perhaps it is easier for you, living 
there, to tell whether Moscow is ready to annex the Crimea if 
the poll there gives a positive result? 
  [Kryzhanivskyy] I will frankly say that Moscow is absolutely 
not ready to annex our territories, since this would be a 
violation of the tripartite statement [on nuclear disarmament]. 
You must understand that this would lead to an unpredictable 
confrontation between us and Russia. 
  [Tkachuk] Have Ukrainian-Russian relations warmed up since 
the tripartite statement was signed? 
  [Kryzhanivskyy] I would not term this warming. The 
situation is simply forcing us to meet each other half-way. 
Moscow is aware of the creeping tensions in our relations. 
Verbally, everyone supports improvement in our relations. 
Although our side has taken a great deal of open steps aimed at 
warming the climate in relations between our states, everything 
is hampered by certain things. You understand, all those 
statements about protecting the Russian-speaking population... 
I am simply appealing to Russian diplomats and politicians: 
Exclude 12 million Russian-speaking people living in Ukraine 
from the total number of 25 million who live outside Russia! 
Nobody will harass them in Ukraine. I have already told them 
that they can negotiate this issue with other CIS countries, but 
not with us, because there is nothing anti-Russian in Ukraine. 
Mr. Filatov, one of the closest advisers to Yeltsin, for 
example, has recently admitted in a private conversation with me 
that the Russian-speaking population is not oppressed in 
Ukraine. As you see, there are reasonable politicians in Russia 
who understand us. 
  [Tkachuk] Mr. Ambassador, do you believe that our foreign 
policy toward CIS countries, and primarily toward Russia, is 
active enough? 
  [Kryzhanivskyy] However the president and the prime 
ministers are always willing to improve relations between our 
countries, the parliament must also be taken into account. I 
believe that the new Supreme Council, even if it is headed by 
[current Supreme Council Chairman] Plyushch, will change its 
policy toward Russia. I think that the new legislators will 
understand the importance of establishing good relations between 
our countries. 
  [Tkachuk] Currently, Ukrainian and foreign analysts are 
pointing to the increasing influence of pro imperial factors in 
Russia's foreign policy. Can Ukraine become a factor of 
deterrence for its neighbor? 
  [Kryzhanivskyy] Gaydar [former Russian deputy prime 
minister] recently told me that if the Ukrainian, Belarusian, 
and Russian economies are united, there will be only one result 
-- a complete collapse of the Russian economy. I would like to 
emphasize that no reasonable politician who is today in power in 
Russia, counts on a union between Ukraine and Russia. 
  [Tkachuk] What is Russia's attitude toward President 
Clinton's "Partnership for Peace" initiative? 
  [Kryzhanivskyy] The attitude is rather interesting. Russia 
wants to join this program, however, not in the same manner as 
other countries such as Ukraine or Moldova. Russia wants to 
obtain a special status. It is impossible to wink at the fact 
that Russia is a huge state. Moreover, it is not only huge but 
also nuclear. 
  [Tkachuk] To what extent is Yeltsin's situation stable 
today, taking into account the new Duma and the recent amnesty? 
  [Kryzhanivskyy] I do not expect any political changes in 
Russia in the next five months. The current alignment of forces 
seems to satisfy everybody, even communists and nationalists.

<F P=106> [From the "Business News Weekly" feature No. 14, 28 Mar - 3 </F>
Apr 94] 
  [Text] By now, Ukraine's Minister for communication Oleh 
Prozhyvalskyy has made several amendments to the tenor of his 
Ministry's license issued to Utel (Ukraine's Communications). 
  Their gist may be reduced to Utel's loss of its exclusive 
right to operate transnational telephone links in Ukraine, which 
the joint venture enjoyed since 1992. 
  The Minister is also said have specified that licenses to 
other operators may be issued on condition they promise to 
invest a portion of their incomes in development of Ukraine's 
telecommunications. 
  Formally, the Utel case was initiated by the Ukrainian 
Anti-Monopoly Committee. 
  The latter is said to be currently drafting its judgement on 
the problem, which has thus arisen. The Justice Ministry is 
scrutinizing Utel's statute documents with a view of making the 
necessary amendments. 
  A Cabinet decision on the Utel jv [joint venture] is 
believed 
to follow within a week. 
  The Utel jv was set up in 1992. The Ukrainian party, which 
is represented by 13 out of Ukraine's 25 regional communication 
agencies and the Ukrtekh and Kievelektrosvyaz associations, owns 
51 per cent of its capital. The remainder is divided among the 
US AT&amp;T, Germany's Deutsche Telecome (19.5 per cent each 
party) 
and the Netherlands' PTT Telecom (10 per cent of the jv's 
authorized capital). 
  As experts believe, Utel-2, which is supposed to unite the 
other 12 regional communication agencies, which are not among 
Utel's co-founder's can materialize if only some major Western 
company takes part in the project. France's Alcatel and 
Canada's Teleglobe are currently mentioned as having displayed a 
certain degree of interest to Ukraine's telecommunication market. 
  Since Utel's strategy relies primarily on land-based lines, 
rather than satellite communication links, UKRINFORM asked 
Andrey Zhalko-Titarenko, deputy director-general of the 
Ukrainian National Space Agency, to comment on changes in 
Ukraine's telecommunication market. 
  Says Mr. Zhalko-Titarenko: "Elimination of the US AT&amp;T's 
monopoly on Ukraine's communication market by way of the 
Netherlands' AT&amp;T's participation in Utel is a major step 
toward 
a market economy in Ukraine". 
  The gist of arguments, which Utel's opponents resort to, is 
AT&amp;T's allegedly unreasonably high proceeds due to the 
so-called 
disbalanced traffic on account of the number of incoming calls 
exceeding that of made from Ukraine, since world telephone 
tariffs cannot be paid by the bulk of Ukraine's citizens. As 
satellite communication proponents have to admit, though, 
satellite communication tariffs can hardly be expected any 
lower, at least in the initial project implementation stage.

and television protested against [Crimean President] Yuriy 
Meshkov's decree discharging Krym Broadcasting Company President 
Valeriy Astakhov from his duties. Participants in today's

  [Text] Kiev April 5 TASS -- A group of international 
experts visited the Chernobyl nuclear power station to check 
whether facilities of the nuclear power station meet the 
required safety standards. 
  Taking part in the inspection, organised by the 
International 
Atomic Energy Agency, were experts from Spain, Sweden, Great 
britain, the United States, Russia and a representative of the 
coordinative secretariat for nuclear security under the European 
Union in Brussels. 
  Experts studied the construction of the station from the 
point of view of safety requirements, the level of its 
maintenance and detected a number of faults. Among factors 
affecting the safety of the nuclear power station, experts 
mentioned the exodus of highly-qualified personnel, the shortage 
of modern equipment and spare parts and a technical condition of 
the "ukritie" (cover) installation covering the damaged reactor 
of the fourth block. 
  IAEA director, Hans Bliks, pointed out that the Chernobyl 
nuclear power station does not meet safety standards and 
suggested that the countries concerned convene a conference to 
work out measures to improve the condition of the Chernobyl 
nuclear station. "The IAEA is prepared to render assistance in 
arranging this conference in Vienna in the second half of 
April," the IAEA director said.

  [Text] Kiev -- Ukraine has recently become an attractive 
spot for the most diverse people from the furthest corners of 
the globe. It has been receiving tourists, businessmen, 
missionaries, merchants, intelligence agents.... 
  The special services are particularly interested in the 
Dnepropetrovsk region, where Ukraine's considerable scientific 
and industrial defense potential is concentrated. In a 
published statement Lieutenant General V. Slobodyanyuka [name as 
transliterated], chief of the Dnepropetrovsk Oblast Security 
Service, states that last year staffers from the Ukrainian 
Security Service administration monitored the unofficial 
presence in the region of more than 30 career foreign 
intelligence agents under different covers, as well as a large 
number of people suspected of involvement with foreign special 
services. 
  Attempts to set up two [intelligence-gathering] stations in 
the oblast were blocked by the counterintelligence department. 
Hostile operations on the part of a number of European 
countries, as well as the United States, China, and Near East 
countries have been uncovered. Foreign professionals, as the 
general put it, are making active use on the region's territory 
of the entire known arsenal of subversive intelligence work -- 
from recruiting local citizens and gathering information through 
legal sources (the press) to the most sophisticated means of 
electronic espionage.

  [Text] Lvov April 4 TASS -- Russia delivers almost twice as 
much natural gas to Ukraine than planned, according to the 
concern Ukrgazprom's dispatcher service. The Russian deliveries 
since March ten include a 80 per cent compensation for the 
terminated supplies of the Turkmen natural gas. Turkmenistan 
suspended deliveries of natural gas to Ukraine until the latter 
repays its debt. 
  According to Ukrgazprom, Russia is keeping its word. On 
April 10, negotiations between Russia and Ukraine will continue 
to specify the schedule of mutual payments. The leadership of 
the Russian giant gas supplier Gasprom had set specific terms 
which have not been disclosed to the public. But ITAR-TASS has 
learned that the Cabinet of Ministers in Kiev is now considering 
the possibility of meeting the demands of the chief supplier of 
natural gas. 
  Although Ukraine receives enough gas to meet its needs at 
present, Ukrgasprom reports that the consumption of natural gas 
in the republic has dwindled. This is due not only to the 
coming of warm spring but also to the measures taken by the 
government to save energy resources. 
  Nonetheless, the temporary stabilisation of gas deliveries 
is 
not durable. The main reason is the lack of money to pay for 
the already consumed energy resources, and the huge internal 
debt owed by Ukrainian consumers to the domestic suppliers.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report] </F>
  [Text] Following a visit by U.S. Secretary of Defense 
William Perry and NASA specialists to Ukraine, talks between the 
two countries' space agencies are expected to intensify in the 
near future. 
  Volodymyr Horbulin, director general of the National Space 
Agency of Ukraine [NKAU], believes, however, that the talks 
between NKAU and NASA will not concern cooperation in the 
production of rockets. The reason behind this is Ukraine's 
refusal to join the Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT]. Volodymyr 
Horbulin noted that Ukraine, which has unique rocket-building 
technologies, having refused to sign the NPT, has wasted one 
year, during which Russia has managed to establish comprehensive 
cooperation in the space industry with the United States. 
  NKAU and the Ministry of External Economic Relations are 
currently making considerable efforts to encourage Ukraine's 
joining the NPT. 
  During upcoming talks with NASA, NKAU will discuss the 
possibility of cooperation in conducting remote-controlled 
probes of earth from space and developing satellite 
telecommunication systems. The Ukrainian side is going to offer 
NASA a radar to study the ocean's surface, developed by the 
Pivdenne design bureau, and technology for electric welding and 
construction assembling in space, developed by the Paton 
Institute. 
  With the collapse of the USSR, Ukraine's space industry has 
suffered considerable losses such as, for example, the fact that 
the Pivdenne design bureau has lost 3,000 employees over the 
last two years. Volodymyr Horbulin refused to reveal how many 
people are currently employed by the Pivdenne design bureau, 
stating only that the number of people who have left the bureau 
"is huge." The director general of NKAU, however, emphasized 
that all the specialists who left the bureau are still working 
in Ukraine.

  [Text] Radio broadcasting to Ukraine of programs by the 
radio stations Mayak, Rossiya-1 and Radio Moscow was stopped 
today from 15:00. 
  Well-informed sources from the Ukrainian Communications 
Ministry suggested in an interview with Interfax-Ukraine that 
this was due to Russia's debt for relaying of the radio programs. 
  The same sources said the debt of Russia amounted to 2.3 Bn 
rubles. 
  The Ukrainian Radio and TV Company's Vice President, Aleksey 
Karpenko, sent a telegram to Moscow today saying that the 
broadcasting would not be renewed until the debt was paid.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vadim Byrkin] </F>
  [Text] Moscow April 5 TASS -- A meeting of the Commonwealth 
Council of Border Troop Commanders set up a coordinating service 
here today. 
  The meeting was for the first time attended by 
representatives of all commonwealth states to discuss 
interaction of border troops, meeting participants told a news 
conference. They have also met Russian Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin. 
  Commander-in-chief of the Russian Border Troops Colonel 
General Andrey Nikolayev told correspondents they also dwelt on 
the future concept of protection of the commonwealth outer 
borders to include purely military issues and a system of mutual 
obligations in provision of commonwealth security. The concept 
will be submitted for discussion by fall 1994. 
  The meeting discussed stabilization of the situation at the 
Tajik-Afghan border and supported proposals of the Commonwealth 
Council of Defence Ministers of March 16 on measures to 
stabilize the situation at the commonwealth southern border. It 
was decided to take urgent measures in order to prevent 
uncontrolled migration in the commonwealth, as well as drug and 
arms trafficking. 
  The Russian side informed the meeting participants of 
preparation of bilateral agreements on border protection with 
the commonwealth states, which have not signed corresponding 
documents. 
  The Russian delegation held bilateral negotiations with 
Commander of the Ukrainian Border Troops General of the Army 
Valeriy Gubenko on preparations of a memorandum on cooperation 
in the protection of borders of Belarus, Russia and Ukraine. 
Asked about joint protection of borders with some commonwealth 
states, Nikolayev said the border with some states, including 
Armenia, is considered common due to the coincidence of 
strategic interests. 
  Nikolayev told ITAR-TASS upon the news conference 
completion, 
the new agreements provide for open borders within the 
commonwealth despite a number of limits. Joint check points may 
be set up on major areas on the border with Ukraine. 
  The border with Azerbaijan provokes concern, as 42 border 
trespassers, including 15 citizens of third states (Iran, 
Pakistan, the United States, Canada and others) were detained at 
the border within three days of March alone, together with the 
contraband and unlicensed cargo worth of some 60 million rubles. 
  There are positive changes in negotiations with Azerbaijan 
on 
a possibility of joint protection of both domestic and outer 
borders, he said. 
  The border with the Baltic states is being equipped, 
although 
it costs about one billion rubles to equip one kilometer of the 
border. 
  Nikolayev said there are no Russian border guards in the 
Chechen republic but they are ready to protect the Chechen 
border with Georgia and Azerbaijan as soon as corresponding 
documents are signed. 
  Ukraine for the first time signed documents on border issues 
and it is a positive result of today's meeting, said Nikolayev.

  [Text] St. Petersburg April 6 TASS -- "It is very important 
that not only Russia but also the entire Commonwealth of 
Independent States should participate in the effort to solve the 
problem of Nagorno-Karabakh", believes Mikhail Krotov, chief of 
the secretariat of the Council of the Interparliamentary 
Assembly of the CIS. "Participating in the negotiations, CIS 
member-countries assume the responsibility for the decisions to 
be taken, and this creates additional political guarantees that 
the arrangements reached will be implemented". 
  A delegation of the Interparliamentary Assembly of the CIS 
countries, headed by Speaker of Kyrgyzstan Parliament Meditkhan 
Sharimkulov, has just returned form the zone of the conflict. 
The delegation met with leaders of Armenia, Azerbaijan and 
Nagorno-Karabakh. The trip was made on the decision of the 
fourth plenary meeting of the assembly. The request for the 
assembly to continue a peacemaking mission was made by both 
sides participating in the conflict. 
  The plan for settlement, known as the Russian plan, although 
it coincides with the CSCE plan in many aspects, has been 
discussed at the negotiations. Both sides want an earlier 
settlement of the conflict, but each fears that agreements can 
be broken and that the opposing side may take advantage of the 
ceasefire and troops disengagement, Krotov told a briefing. 
Parliamentarians' purpose is to create an instrument for 
reliable political guarantees and to dispel distrust. 
  The main purpose is to end bloodshed. At the stage of 
settlement of the conflict, much depends on the executive 
authorities, Krotov said. On April 15 the Council of Heads of 
State and the Council of Governments of the CIS countries will 
be held in Moscow, and the problem will be tackled at the level 
of presidents and prime ministers. Matters of political 
settlement will be considered at the subsequent stage. The role 
of parliament will increase. The chief purpose of the Council 
of the Interparliamentary Assembly of the CIS at present is to 
create an atmosphere favourable for negotiations, Krotov said. 
This in the aim of another meeting of parliamentarians to be 
held in Bishkek.

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow April 6 ITAR-TASS --- No single topic is 
highlighted by the Russian national press on Wednesday. "The 
rejection of illusions is characteristic of Russia's foreign 
policy," NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA (independent newspaper) writes 
today. Chairman of the State Duma's Foreign Affairs Committee 
Vladimir Lukin believes that "Russia has begun to treat 
seriously its national interests which have acquired a new 
significance, and it tends to defend these interests more 
persistently. In short, this process normalizes the Russian 
foreign policy which is being pursued in a democratic manner on 
the basis of public opinion, political discussions and 
consensus. A new trend has become evident in Russian-American 
relations. It would be wrong to overlook this or delay even for 
a short time the familiarization of the general public with the 
latest developments, to say nothing about blacking this out. It 
would be wrong both in the foreign and domestic political 
contexts". 
  "It is quite clear, and (Kazakhstan's President Nursultan) 
Nazarbayev (who recently called for the creation of a Euro Asian 
union to replace the former Soviet Union) knows that with 
Yeltsin in Russia and Kravchuk in Ukraine no union will be 
created (the belowezhskaya pushcha syndrome). But Nazarbayev is 
looking ahead, to the future not of one or another president, 
but to the future of Russia and Kazakhstan. And in this 
respect, he sees farther ahead than the Kremlin. In addition, 
Nazarbayev has another good thing going for him--he did not 
participate in the liquidation of the USSR and in forming an 
emasculated commonwealth out of its shapeless fragments. And 
then Almaty does not have a sore western Ukraine which Kiev has, 
and it does not have the sick thirst for power next to God's 
(who does not exist in Yeltsin's atheistic educational 
background), which the Russian president is suffering from. [no 
closing quotation mark as received] 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA reports on the Tajik-Tajik dialogues in 
Moscow, it comments: "The pre-history of these negotiations 
makes it clear that they will not proceed easily. At least in 
the first round, the parties (the official Government of 
Tajikistan and the opposition) are hardly likely to achieve 
serious results". The same newspaper declares that "Washington 
is unhappy about the plan for restarting the Armenian nuclear 
power station". "Whereas Washington is striving to help Yerevan 
with bread supplies, its stance with regard to the intention of 
the Armenian Government to revive the nuclear power station is 
directly opposite". 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA carries an interview with the former 
deputy chairman (in charge of intelligence and 
counterintelligence) of the committee for the protection of the 
Soviet state border Lieutenant- General Boris Agapov, who is now 
vice president of the Ingush Republic. Agapov says that 
(Russia's) border troops are unable to ensure due protection of 
the border. For this purpose there exist border units of the 
land forces." 
  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI focuses on the country's national economy. 
"In a normal market economy, the trader is usually the first to 
give in by reducing prices and ensuring profits by stepping up 
turnover. When this mechanism begins operating in this country, 
it will be possible to say that another important component of a 
civilized market has taken root. But for the time being, it is 
impossible to do without an active intervention on the part of 
the state. This applies above all to the reorganization of 
loss-making enterprises". 
  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA published an interview with General 
Aleksandr Lebed, commander of the 14th Russian Army stationed in 
Moldova. "If you ask me whether it is normal for an army of one 
state to be located on the territory of another, I will reply: 
No, it is not normal. Should it be withdrawn? Undoubtedly. 
But when this should be done is another question. As soon as 
political and economic conditions are created for the 
withdrawal". 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (Red Star) carried an interview with a 
Russian Orthodox Church dignitary, Metropolitan Pitirim of 
Volokolamsk and Yuriyev. The metropolitan says: "In any 
situation we should set ourselves specific tasks that can be 
accomplished with a view to upgrading the dignity of the 
individual. A war is now underway not between the ideas of 
believers and their flesh and blood, but against the forces of 
darkness in this century. The individual is being depraved by 
all available means of economic, moral, technical and propaganda 
influence. The aim is to reduce man to the level of unthinking 
satisfaction of his vital needs and in contravention to the laws 
of communal living". 
  PRAVDA publishes an interview with Vasiliy Vershinin, 
chairman of a State Duma subcommittee, who predicts that "one 
half of all collective and state farms is doomed to collapse, 
there will be a sharp drop in food supplies. The intervention 
of western economies in our agrarian sector will grow. We shall 
have to spend huge resources to purchase food and finance 
foreign farmers. There will no longer be any need for the army, 
missiles and submarines. What are they good for? If the West 
suspends food supplies for two or three weeks, we shall 
surrender without resistance".

  [Text] The first round of direct talks between the 
representatives of the Tajik Government and the opposition was 
held in Moscow this afternoon, under UN auspices and attended by 
representatives of the Islamic Republic of Iran. 
  A few minutes ago, in a telephone conversation, we asked our 
country's ambassador in Moscow about the manner in which the 
session had been held. He said: 
  [Begin recording] The talks -- which started in Moscow today 
between the Tajik Government and the opposition -- were held in 
a very amicable atmosphere, in the presence of (Pierre) Ballon, 
the representative of the UN secretary general. First he called 
on the two sides to proceed with the talks without expressing 
their opposing stances in detail and, in the meantime, to 
present their proposals to him. 
  As host and overseer, Kozyrev expressed the wish that the 
talks should definitely achieve a positive result. He declared 
his support for the talks and that of his government. Then 
Zuhurov, the Tajik labor minister, who is the representative of 
the Tajik Government, made a speech. He expressed the hope 
that, since the people of Tajikistan have suffered hardship 
during this period and are very much in favor of peace, the 
talks will lead to peace as desired by the people. 
  Latifi, as the representative of the opposition, then began 
to speak. First he thanked all countries which have helped and 
received refugees, including our country, Iran. While declaring 
his readiness for the talks, he stressed that any agreement 
reached at the talks should be in accordance with UN principles.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Abarinov report under the "Diplomacy" rubric: </F>
"Russia Does Not Need any Authorization for Peacekeeping in CIS. 
They Think in Moscow That the Operations Are Fully Legitimate"] 
  [Text] The UN headquarters has distributed as a UN General 
Assembly and Security Council document a joint statement by the 
Russian Federation Defense and Foreign Ministries saying that 
Russia carries out peacekeeping operations in CIS countries 
fully in accordance with the UN Charter and that it needs no 
"authorization" from the community of nations or the CSCE to 
carry them out. The document, the text says, is a response to 
statements made by some politicians and publications in foreign 
mass media regarding the "ambiguity" of the Russian Federation's 
peacekeeping mission on the territory of countries that are part 
of the CIS. 
  Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov commented on 
the joint statement at the request of your SEGODNYA 
correspondent. He said that Moscow has never raised the 
question of legitimizing its peacekeeping operations on CIS 
territory, but it has asked and is still asking the United 
Nations for support. Financial considerations are not the least 
important factor here: Russia has been contributing large sums 
of money to finance peacekeeping forces, whereas its own 
operations in the CIS have been seen by the international 
community as something that does not fall under the definition 
of "peacekeeping." We think, however, Sergey Lavrov continued, 
that they are part of a general effort to ensure global 
security. Russia believes that its peacekeeping activity is in 
no way at odds with the UN Charter -- on the contrary, the 
Charter encourages regional agreements to participate in the 
settlement of conflicts. There are just different kinds of 
operations, Mr. Lavrov explained. One of them is an operation 
under a UN flag, authorized by the Security Council. In this 
case the peacekeeping forces must be multilateral, and expenses 
involved must be shared in accordance with the specified amounts 
of contributions. Another type is an operation on the basis of 
regional agreements, something that is taking place in Liberia. 
The UN secretary general, the deputy foreign minister said, 
fully shares this point of view and has no doubts as to the 
Russian actions' legitimacy.

  [Text] A Russian military official has denied Western media 
allegations saying Moscow was violating the CFE [Conventional 
Forces in Europe] agreement. "Though the CFE deal became valid 
from July 17, 1992 its clause on flank restrictions, which is of 
NATO's specific concern, comes into force in 40 months' time, 
i.e. after November 16, 1995," head of the international 
department of the Russian Armed Forces' General Chief of Staff 
Georgiy Pavlodyuk told INTERFAX on Tuesday. 
  He said Russia's current strength in conventional weapons 
was 
slightly in excess of what is envisaged by the treaty and that 
"we have a further 18 months" in which to comply with CFE terms. 
  Pavolodyuk said international inspections carried out in 
Russia had confirmed that Moscow was meeting its schedule of 
conventional weapons cuts. 
  He thinks the flank restrictions were damaging to Russia's 
interests. Under the treaty, Moscow is entitled to deploy on 
its Leningrad and North Caucasian flanks only 700 tanks, 580 
APCs and 1,280 artillery pieces. 
  Pavlodyuk said the Russian president had called on other 
signatory states for a review of the flank restrictions clause 
in respect to Russia. The move follows Moscow's concern about 
national security as well as economic and social problems 
arising from troop withrawals from Eastern Europe and the Baltic 
states. "We want those restrictions to be lifted at least for 
some time before those problems have been resolved. However, 
there has been no positive response from our partners yet," 
Pavlodyuk said. 
  He made it clear that the Russian government was not wanting 
to act unilaterally. 
  The CFE agreement was signed by 28 European states as well 
as 
the United States and Canada.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Abarinov report under the "Security" rubric: </F>
"Americans Insist on Observance of Conventional Forces. Moscow 
Intends To Work for Higher Quota in Caucasus"] 
  [Text] NATO will decline all of Russia's attempts to alter 
the terms of agreement on conventional forces in Europe that 
limit Russian military presence on the Northern and Southern 
flanks. This was stated on Sunday by U.S. Defense Secretary 
William Perry in the NBC "Meet the Press" program. He advised 
that he had discussed this topic with the leaders of countries 
which the possible changes may affect most, and met with no 
support. 
  Limits on arms under the Conventional Forces in Europe 
treaty 
go into effect next November. Under the document, Russia is 
entitled to keep on its Northern (Leningrad military district) 
and Southern (Caucasus) flanks not more that 580 armored 
personnel carriers, 700 tanks, and 1,280 artillery pieces per 
flank. Moscow, however, is pressing for a revision of the flank 
quotas so as to be in a position to increase its military 
presence in the Caucasus region. According to THE NEW YORK 
TIMES, Russia does not agree to make up for the strengthening of 
the Caucasus grouping by making corresponding cuts in the 
Northern flank. The newspaper also reports with reference to 
sources in the American intelligence service that Russia would 
like to get its Southern quota increased by 2,000 armored 
personnel carriers, 400 tanks, and 500 artillery pieces. 
  Oleg Sokolov, head of the Russian Federation Foreign 
Ministry 
defense department, to whom your SEGODNYA correspondent turned 
for clarification, stated that the question of flank quota 
revision is still on the agenda. He pointed to the circumstance 
that the conventional arms treaty was signed in 1990 during a 
standoff between the military blocs. Today the situation in 
Europe has radically changed. We count, Mr. Sokolov said, on 
understanding of our concern and will continue consultations 
with those parties to the treaty who have to do with solving the 
question. Precedents of these kinds of exceptions already 
exist, the diplomat pointed out.

<F P=106> [Report by TURKMENPRESS-TASS correspondent Anna Kurbanova] </F>
  [Text] Ashgabat 5 April, TASS -- The government of 
Turkmenia [Turkmentistan] held bilateral talks with delegations 
of Iran and Russia in Ashgabat on Tuesday within the framework 
of the international consortium on transportation of Turkmen 
energy resources to the world market. 
  As a results of the talks two intergovernmental agreements 
were signed: The one with Iran -- on the construction of an oil 
pipeline as far as Tehran which will ensure delivering 6 million 
tons of Turkmen oil to Iran, and the other with Russia -- on 
cooperation in the development of fuel and power complexes. 
  "This document shows that Russia is interested in export of 
Turkmen oil and gas to the world market," Yuriy Shafranik, 
member of the interstate council of the consortium and minister 
of fuel and power engineering of Russia, told TURKMENPRESS. 
  "We will try to help Turkmenia by consulting and in the 
construction of the oil pipeline itself. The interaction in 
this direction will allow both states to cooperate on the 
European market in the future without infringing upon mutual 
interests. We will also back other routes of Turkmen energy 
resources," Yuriy Shafranik pointed out.

  [Text] An agreement was signed in Ashgabat on the 
transportation of natural gas from Turkmenistan via pipeline 
through Iran and Turkey to Europe. 
  According to TRT correspondent Yavuz Kocak, the relevant 
ministers of the cosignatory countries attended a committee 
meeting this morning under the chairmanship of Turkmen President 
Saparmurad Niyazov. Representing Turkey at the committee was 
Energy and Natural Resources Minister Veysel Atasoy. The topics 
discussed and decisions made at the committee were later relayed 
to representatives of organizations and firms, which will 
undertake the project, during a consortium meeting chaired by 
Niyazov. 
  According to the agreement, which was signed among Turkey, 
Turkmenistan, Iran, and Russia, the section of the 
Turkmenistan-Europe natural gas pipeline extending up to the 
Turkish border will be undertaken by Iran. The section through 
Turkish territory will be constructed by Botas [Pipeline and 
Petroleum Transport Corporation] and the firms in the 
consortium. The construction of the Turkmenistan-Europe natural 
gas pipeline, which is expected to cost approximately $9 
billion, will take five years. 
  Atasoy said that with the conclusion of this project and 
agreements to be reached with other countries, Turkey will be 
consuming 40 billion cubic meters of natural gas in the 2000's. 
Pointing out that efforts are under way to increase the natural 
gas imported from Russia, Atasoy said the following to TRT: 
  [Begin Atasoy recording] In addition to this, we want to 
purchase natural gas from Iran. We may receive natural gas from 
Iran in a short time. Negotiations to this effect will be 
conducted with the Iranian minister this afternoon. Moreover, 
the arrival of natural gas from Turkmenistan will take at least 
five years. This will enable us to supply our industrialists in 
Kayseri, Adana, and Icel with natural gas. With the realization 
of the projects on natural gas from three main sources, namely 
Turkmenistan, Iran, and Russia, we will have diversified our 
natural gas sources. This will allow Turkey to consume 40 
billion cubic meters of natural gas in the 2000's. In other 
words, natural gas will occupy a more important place in our 
energy policy. A significant part of the power stations we are 
planning will consequently depend on natural gas. [end 
recording] 
  It was reported that this subject was discussed during the 
meeting held between Atasoy and Iranian Petroleum Minister 
Gholam Reza Aqazadeh-Kho'i in Ashgabat this afternoon.

  [Text] Tbilisi, April 5 (SNARK)--"The quadripartite 
agreement, signed in Moscow between Georgia and Abkhazia with 
the participation of the UN and Russia, promises swift entrance 
of the peacemaking forces into the conflict's zone and refuges' 
return to their places". Lorik Marshania, First Vice Prime 
[Minister] of Abkhazia informed of it SNARK today. 
  He said peace in Abkhazia will set in only provided with 
unreserved execution of the reached agreement by the sides. 
  Georgian Vice Prime [Minister] Tamaz Nadareishvili is of the 
same opinion. He told SNARK the agreement gives a good 
opportunity for 250 thousand refuges to return to their places. 
  Meanwhile, a radical Georgian deputy Boris Kukubava consider 
the signed agreement to be an adroit using of the international 
authority of "capitulator" Shevardnadze to acknowledge de-facto 
Abkhazian state.

  [Text] The Georgian parliament continued on April 5 
debating the documents on a peaceful settlement to the conflict 
in Abkhazia signed earlier in Moscow. 
  Just like at the closed session on Monday, a large group was 
formed of those deputies who oppose the documents. For example, 
Nodar Natadze, leader of the Georgian People's Front, accused 
the parliamentary majority backing Eduard Shevardnadze of 
betraying the national interests. The opposition suggested 
debating the issue on the powers of the Georgian delegation 
currently staying in Moscow. The Abkhaz deputies in the Georgian 
parliament opposed the documents. 
  Leader of the parliamentary faction called The National 
Democrats, Irina Sarishvili, told Interfax that the signed 
documents are "humiliating for Georgia." She believes they mean 
for Georgia the loss of Abkhazia. 
  Sarishvili said it appears that the Georgians who fought for 
their land in Abkhazia were posed as aggressors, while the 
Abkhaz as fighters for the freedom of their Motherland.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report under the "Former Soviet Union" rubric: </F>
"Shevardnadze Complains about United Nations and South Ossetia"] 
  [Text] Eduard Shevardnadze has criticized the way UN 
observers are performing their mission in Abkhazia in connection 
with events there. The observers' presence there, he remarked, 
is futile because, when the new stage of confrontation began, 
they not only failed to raise their voice over the escalation of 
the conflict but did not even issue a statement in response to 
it. According to Shevardnadze, no peace will be achieved in 
Abkhazia unless there is real Russian support in securing a 
peaceful settlement of the conflict. 
  This most acute headache suffered by the Georgian president 
has been augmented by yet another: Elections to the 
representative organ of South Ossetia -- the State Assembly -- 
have been held. According to provisional figures, there was a 
70-percent turnout; 21 of the 36 seats have been taken, 17 of 
them by Communist Party deputies. Fifteen candidates, including 
current State Assembly Chairman Lyudvig Chibirov, will take part 
in repeat elections on 10 April, as they failed to win the 
requisite number of votes. 
  Official Tbilisi has reacted to the holding of these 
elections in a sharly negative way, regarding them as unlawful. 
The South Ossetian autonomous formation was abolished by the 
Georgian Supreme Council back in December 1990, in the wake of 
which ethnic conflict broke out in the region. 
  Commenting on the elections, Vazha Khachapuridze, chief 
state 
counsellor-coordinator for the leader of Georgia on questions of 
defense and national security, stated that they are an unlawful 
attempt to detach Shida Kartli -- as the Georgian side calls 
this region -- from the Republic of Georgia.

  [Text] Yerevan, April 5 (SNARK)--A three-month assembly 
(the second one in this year) started in Armenia. It is 
supposed to involve the medium-rank staff of the Ministries and 
State Departments. This is the assertion of the Armenian State 
Minister for Defence Vazgen Sargisyan. Speaking on television 
he declared that such assemblies will be carried out constantly 
from now on, and all the Armenian citizens liable for call-up 
will take part in them. 
  The State Minister confirmed that after a short military 
training the participants of the assembly are usually sent to 
the Armenian- Azerbaijani frontier. However, they serve not at 
the front line, but in rearguard.

<F P=106> [Valeriy Aydinyan report: "Armenian Nuclear Power Station: </F>
What's Going on in and Around It?"] 
  [Excerpts] Yerevan -- The agreement signed between the 
Russian and Armenian Governments on the demothballing and 
industrial utilization of the Armenian nuclear power station 
[AES] remains one of the most important events of recent times. 
The AES' significance in the republic's life is so great that 
the agreement has both political and even psychological and 
moral repercussions. It will be a while -- at least a year -- 
before the power station comes on stream, but this represents 
both a real deadline and a real hope, which will make it 
possible to withstand yet another dark and cold blockade winter. 
[passage omitted] 
  A visiting session of the republic government was held at 
the 
Armenian AES recently. Opening it, President Levon 
Ter-Petrosyan spoke highly of the agreement signed by the 
Russian Federation Government. The political and technical 
problems have been solved, he said. Work is now underway on 
settling the financial problems. After demothballing, the power 
station will be producing 400 megawatts of electricity, which 
will make it possible to meet the republic's minimum 
requirements and escape the damage caused by the blockade. The 
Sevan River, whose water resources are currently being 
overexploited, will be saved from silting up. 
  As for the power station's safety, this is one of the main 
points of the Russian-Armenian agreement. Furthermore, for 
months now a group of experts representing various countries and 
international organizations has been studying the situation at 
the AES. They also think that the station can be commissioned if 
a number of measures are taken. The president described the 
opening of the station as a priority task, and the decisions 
which have been adopted show that these are not just words -- 
the government is serious about this. 
  In order to insure an inflow of skilled personnel, wages 20 
times above the minimum wage in the republic are being set for 
the power station's workers. This is much more than the 
highest-ranking state officials get. Provision has been made 
for large sums to provide free food for the workers. Repairs to 
the AES' rest home will be completed this year. 
  So the first steps have been taken. Yet reactions to the 
demothballing of the AES have been far from unequivocal. The 
United States makes no secret of its negative attitude, and 
Turkey, Azerbaijan, and Georgia are sharply opposed to the 
nuclear power station resuming operation. But for all this 
Turkey and Azerbaijan are not prepared to lift the blockade, and 
Georgia is still incapable of ensuring the protection of the gas 
pipeline and the railroad. Admittedly the United States has 
allocated in the form of aid a large consignment of kerosene, 
which is being distributed among the socially vulnerable strata 
of the population. But this humane act cannot influence the 
situation in the economy. Neighbors' views have to be taken into 
account as far as possible, of course. But this desire must be 
mutual. Moreover, some countries' attitude betrays not so much 
ecological worries as concern of a strictly political nature. 
  The Armenian and Russian sides spent a long time working on 
the draft and, one assumes, also gave careful consideration to 
the possible international reaction to the opening of the AES. 
And there is one other curious detail. Commenting on the 
agreement, observers -- manifestly without collusion -- have 
concluded that Russia is coming back. This sounds somewhat 
strange, particularly in Armenia, which Russia has never 
seriously left. Its troops are stationed here and its border 
guards protect the border. Not so long ago a document was 
signed under which there will be twice-yearly drafts in Armenia 
of young people for service in the Russian Border Troops. The 
whole point, probably, is that the troops can be moved in or out 
in a short space of time. But the demothballing and joint 
operation of the AES is a matter calculated for decades ahead, 
and the agreement once again confirms the seriousness of 
Russia's intentions. At the time, the closure of the AES 
coincided with the start of destructive processes in the 
economy. Might its demothballing mark the beginning of the 
restoration of destroyed ties, of a destroyed economy? It would 
be nice to believe so.

<F P=106> [Report by Ekmat Baybakpayev under the "Kirghizia" rubric: </F>
"What He Seeks in Distant Parts"] 
  [Text] According to the data of the Kirghiz [Kyrgyzstan] 
Committee for Statistics, approximately 144,000 people left the 
Republic last year. This was 60 percent more than the previous 
year. 
  More than 70 percent of those who left chose Russia as their 
permanent place of residence, while others emigrated to Ukraine, 
Belorusia [Belarus], Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan. Almost all the 
Germans left for Germany. 
  Today economic difficulties have been added to the problem 
of 
ignorance of the state language, which previously was the chief 
reason for migrating. The sharp drop in the volume of 
industrial production gives rise equally quickly to a reduction 
in staff. As is known, the Russian-speaking part of the 
population forms up to 90 percent of working people in the 
Republic's industry. 
  The average wage in Russia, to where inhabitants of 
Kirghizia 
[kirgizy] mainly head, is four or five times higher than in the 
Republic. Let us add that the minimum consumer budget of one 
inhabitant of Russia amounts to one-third of the wages of the 
inhabitant of Kirghizia.... 
  As a result of the activation of migration processes, the 
size of the Republic's population has fallen for the first time 
since the war....

<F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Ardayev: "Kazakhstani Peasant Could </F>
Become Owner. Sovkhoz Director Becomes Kulak Right Away"] 
  [Text] Alma-Ata [Almaty] -- Government documents aimed at 
implementing radical reform in Kazakhstan's agriculture were 
published in the Republic press in March. There are now 
distinct prospects that private owners could finally emerge in 
the agrarian sector. 
  The Cabinet of Ministers ratified the provisional statute on 
the sale of state agricultural enterprises into the private 
ownership of citizens (first phase). In accordance with this 
statute, labor collective members and persons retired on pension 
from a given enterprise and residing on its territory, as well 
as social sphere employees, have the right to buy out 49 percent 
of the redeemable part of the property subject to the property 
shares assigned to each. 
  An "outside" buyer -- a citizen of the Republic of 
Kazakhstan 
having an agricultural education and a record of practical work 
in agriculture of not less than five years -- can acquire 20 
percent. He buys sovkhoz property at a closed commercial 
tender, paying in installments with a mandatory initial payment 
of not less than 31 percent of its cost. The remaining 31 
percent of the state property is also transferred to the buyer, 
but for temporary use for a period of not more than five years. 
He can also receive for temporary use for a maximum of two 
years the remaining unsold part of the agricultural enterprise's 
state property. 
  The distribution of standard-size tracts of land (lots) is 
carried out according to the same procedure as governs the 
distribution of the property. 
  However, President N. Nazarbayev has issued a special edict 
allocating 10 percent of the redeemable part of sovkhoz property 
free of charge to a sovkhoz director who has worked in this post 
for not less than 20 years. The director can acquire a further 
10 percent for temporary use for a period of up to five years. 
If the farm increases its efficiency and attains stable levels 
of agricultural production and improves its socioeconomic 
indicators, the director can acquire this share free of charge 
over the following five years. Thus the sovkhoz director 
becomes the biggest property owner: Only the remaining 80 
percent of the redeemable part of the property will be 
distributed between labor collective members and "outside" 
buyers. Kolkhozes have been recommended to use this sovkhoz 
method. 
  Therefore, property owners could emerge in the Kazakhstani 
countryside in the near future, but, once again, not property 
owners in the full sense -- no constitutionally enshrined 
institution of private ownership of land exists in Kazakhstan to 
this day. Land shares can be transferred to citizens only on 
long-term leases for a period of up to 99 years, with the right 
of inheritance.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondnet Vladimir Akimov] </F>
  [Text] Alma Ata [Almaty] 5 April, TASS -- The personnel of 
the Mangyshlak nuclear plant (fast-neutron reactor) asked the 
presidents of Russia and Kazakhstan for urgent aid as the plant 
is about to be stopped. 
  The open letter of the collective published by local press 
says that because of the blockage of payments between the two 
countries. The plant just as an energy complex of which it is 
part, cannot provide itself with nuclear fuel and reserves of 
technological equipment. The situation is aggravated by the 
fact that many workers and employees get a discharge and leave 
for Russia as civic, language and other problems of skilled 
personnel are not being solved. 
  Nuclear specialists believe that the stoppage of the plant 
threatens to paralyse enterprises of the eastern Caspian Basin. 
The supply to cities and villages of technical and drinking 
water received by desalination will be stopped. The very 
stoppage of the fast-neutron reactor can lead to unpredictable 
consequences. There are no effective projects for its stopage 
and conservation.

  [Text] The eighth round of talks started in Chisinau 
Tuesday on the status and withdrawal of the Russian 14th Army. 
The previous round was held last November. 
  The Moldovan chief negotiator, ambassador to Moscow Anatol 
Taran, told Interfax that the deadline for the withdrawal of the 
Russian Army remained the only unresolved issue. In his words, 
"all other problems have been practically resolved" and the 
draft treaty "nearly ironed out." 
  "If this round of talks succeeded in determining the 
deadline 
for the withdrawal of the army, this would make a significant 
progress," Taran said. Thus far, he said, "the two sides hold 
their ground and it would be difficult to work out a compromise." 
  Taran also said that the two sides discussed the 
contribution 
Moldova could make to the housing of the army following its 
withdrawal. The Moldovan delegation agrees to raise the cash 
from two sources, selling the flats of leaving Russian officers 
and auctioning some of the army's realties. 
  Taran said that the Russian delegation wanted Kishinev 
[Chisinau] to add a third source, money from the Moldovan state 
budget. Moldova, permanently hard up, said it could not afford 
it. 
  Taran also said that his country had invited members of the 
CSCE permanent mission members in the Republic to be present at 
the talks as observers. The Russian negotiators did not think 
their presence essential and suggested that the mission could be 
informed on the results of the talks when they ended. 
  The two sides had agreed thus far that Transdniestria 
representatives would be present at the talks as observers.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Demidetskiy] </F>
  [Text] Kishinev [Chisinau] 5 April, TASS -- The 14th 
Russian Army withdrawal from Moldova before settlement of the 
Trans-Dniester problem may destabilize regional situation, 
deputy 14th Army commander for personnel Colonel Alexandr 
Baranov told ITAR-TASS today, commenting on the eighth round of 
negotiations on the 14th Army status and term of its Moldovan 
stay. 
  "The Russian military helped to stop the bloodshed inspired 
by extremist-minded politicians in summer 1992," said the 
colonel. "So, no matter what they say the 14th Army remains a 
stabilizing factor in the region and its presence cools hotheads 
on both banks of the Dniester River." 
  In the opinion of Baranov, the troops pullback in 1994, as 
it 
is suggested by the Moldovan side, is unreal. Re-location of 
the Army is difficult and costly. The more so, the 
trans-Dniester region is a native land of many officers, many of 
them have families, relatives and housing in the region. 
  "Hasty and poorly-considered decisions on the army pullback 
may result in undesirable consequences. I hope this is 
understood both in Moscow and Kishinev," stressed the colonel.

  [Text] At the House of External Economic Relations today, 
UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali held talks with 
Belarusian Foreign Minister Krawchanka. In the course of these 
talks, various aspects of international life were discussed, as 
well as issues concerning Belarusian participation in the 
activities of this authoritative international organization. 
Given that the talks were held behind closed doors, I asked the 
officials for a short interview. 
  Could you brief us on the essence of your conversation? 
  [Begin recording] [Butrus-Ghali, in English fading into 
Belarusian translation] We have had a very constructive and 
positive meeting with the Belarusian minister of foreign 
affairs. We discussed the activities of the United Nations, the 
disaster at Chernobyl, and the possible participation of 
Belarusian peacekeeping forces in various operations around the 
world. We will have a second round of discussions, during which 
we will continue with the agenda of different items agreed for 
the exchange of information. 
  [Krawchanka] I have presented [Butrus-Ghali] with two 
concrete drafts -- not mere declarations, not just general 
words, but two documents. The first project, worth 
approximately $12 million, provides for radiological and 
ecological monitoring on Belarusian territory. We hope that the 
UN Headquarters will find funds for this endeavor. The other 
project, which is worth $8 million, is aimed at building a 
factory to produce ecological baby food for Chernobyl children. 
We take quite an active part in many international activities, 
and the arrival of Secretary General Butrus-Ghali is proof that 
the international community recognizes the complex problems 
facing our motherland. [end recording] 
  Later today, the UN general secretary held a meeting at the 
CIS Executive Secretariat. CIS Executive Secretary Ivan 
Karatchenya expressed gratitude to Butrus-Ghali for finding time 
to visit the CIS Headquarters in Minsk. He thanked the guest 
for the resolution passed by a UN session and the UN Secretariat 
on granting the CIS observer status in the United Nations. This 
will undoubtedly increase the prestige of the CIS as a regional 
international organization. The executive secretary also 
briefed Butrus Butrus-Ghali on the structure of the coordinating 
bodies of the CIS, as well as their tasks and goals. These 
include the reduction of conflicts on CIS territory and 
multifarious activities in the sphere of economic integration. 
  Secretary General Butrus-Ghali, in his turn, pointed out 
that 
granting the CIS observer status in the United Nations is just 
the first step toward recognizing the CIS as an entity of 
international law. The United Nations is closely observing the 
activities of the CIS, and is interested in increasing the 
latter's peacekeeping and humanitarian role. According to Mr. 
Butrus-Ghali, the UN Secretariat is ready to closely cooperate 
with the executive bodies of the CIS in various spheres. 
  At the end of the first day of his visit, Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali 
visited the UN mission in Belarus. Incidentally, this is the 
first UN mission opened in a CIS state.

Hryb by ZVYAZDA correspondents Yan Kamotski and Natallya 
Talkanitsa, under the "Parliamentary Diary" rubric; place and 
date not given: "`Alyaksandr Lukashenka Began His Election 
Campaign'"] 
  [Text] As is known, on 31 April, the Belarusian Supreme 
Soviet did not adopt a resolution to dismiss four government 
members and the National Bank chairman, as was proposed by 
People's Deputy Lukashenka. ZVYAZDA correspondents have asked 
Supreme Soviet Chairman Mechyslaw Hryb to comment on the 
parliament's discussion of this issue. 
  [ZVYAZDA] How do you estimate the fact that the parliament 
has not adopted any resolution on proposals put forward by the 
commission headed by Alyaksandr Lukashenka? 
  [Hryb] I think that the reason for this was the lack of any 
documents which could substantiate charges against each of the 
individuals. In my opinion, it was necessary for people's 
deputies to have at their disposal both documented evidence and 
explanatory statements by the ministers. As became clear today, 
the commission has not spoken with any of them. It is 
impossible to adopt a resolution on the basis of such one-sided 
material. 
  [ZVYAZDA] Thus, you believe that the commission simply 
failed to convince people's deputies of the guilt of government 
members? 
  [Hryb] Absolutely. Even the opposition's representative, 
People's Deputy Malashka, said that he would like to see the 
government dismissed, but would not vote in favor of anyone's 
dismissal without having documented proof of their guilt. 
  [ZVYAZDA] Do you think Alyaksandr Lukashenka used this 
opportunity to begin his election campaign? 
  [Hryb] It is hard to say. He may be the best person to 
answer this question. However, judging by all appearances -- 
yes, he has.

  [Excerpt] Moscow, 6 Apr -- Yuriy Meshkov, president of the 
Republic of Crimea, returned to Simferopol from a business trip 
to Cyrpus nearly eight hours late. An ITAR-TASS correspondent 
has been told by a member of staff on duty at Yuriy Meshkov's 
office that the delay occurred when Turkey, over whose territory 
the Crimean president's plane was due to fly, unexpectedly 
closed its airspace. As a result of the incident, which the 
member of staff believes to have been caused by a 
"misunderstanding," the plane landed in Simferopol at about 
0200. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Moscow, 5 Apr -- A group of Ukrainian military 
leaders, including Minister of Defense Vitaliy Radetskyy, will 
arrive in the Crimea today. The ITAR-TASS correspondent learned 
this from informed sources at the headquarters of the Black Sea 
Fleet. The purpose of the Ukrainian generals' coming to the 
peninsula is not known either to the administration of the 
Crimea or to the command of the Black Sea Fleet. 
  This same source reports that the group also includes Chief 
of the Intelligence Administration of the Ukrainian Armed Forces 
Major-General Vehunnikov, commander of the Air Force, 
Major-General Antonets, chief of staff of the National Guard 
Mokhov, and Chief of the Second Counterintelligence 
Administration Major-General Kravchenko. All of the said 
generals are coming to the peninsula in the course of today 
separately, by different means of transport, without preliminary 
agreement with the local authorities, and this has provoked a 
protest from the leadership of the peninsula. 
  President of the Crimea Yuriy Meshkov is to return to 
Simferopol after a business visit to Cyprus at 1800 today.

  [Text] On 3 April 1994, Admiral Eduard Baltin, commander 
of the Black Sea Fleet, was brought to the Sevastopol Navy 
hospital with a bullet wound to the thigh. Due to the fact that 
the Black Sea Fleet has issued no official communique on this 
accident, various rumors have started to circulate. To avoid 
this, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry Press Service reports that 
as has become known, Admiral Baltin was wounded at his summer 
house as a result of careless handling of his gun.

  [Text] Russia has sent a shipment of fuel for Ukrainian 
nuclear power plants and thus, started to fulfill part of its 
commitments. With regard to the U.S. payment of $60 million to 
Russia, this issue has also been resolved. This was stated 
today by Ukrainian Deputy Foreign Minister Borys Tarasyuk. He 
underlined that the United States has created an impressive 
legal footing and outlined the directions for assisting nuclear 
disarmament in Ukraine. According to the deputy foreign 
minister, the sum of $350 million will be subject to corrections 
depending on real needs and possibilities. Borys Tarasyuk 
underlined that an agreement has been signed with Japan on 
granting Ukraine tens of millions of dollars worth of 
assistance. Discussions are being held with Italy on aid in the 
form of new technologies. The deputy foreign minister expressed 
hope that the new legislature will positively resolve the issue 
of Ukraine joining the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.

<F P=106> [TIDNINGARNAS TELEGRAMBYRA/SVENSKA DAGBLADET report: </F>
"`Chernobyl Reactors Highly Dangerous'"] 
  [Text] New York/Moscow -- The International Atomic Energy 
Agency, IAEA, views with great concern the risk of a new 
catastrophe at the Chernobyl nuclear power station in Ukraine. 
  "The two reactors still in operation are highly dangerous," 
said IAEA head Hans Blix in an interview with TIDNINGARNAS 
TELEGRAMBYRA. 
  The reactors should really have been shut down by now, but 
last fall Ukraine reversed this decision. The reason given was 
that the country could not afford to do without them. 
  A group of inspectors from the IAEA, a UN agency, visited 
Chernobyl a few weeks ago, and on Thursday [30 March] IAEA 
headquarters issued a statement highly critical of the power 
station. The group found that there was much to be criticized 
at the nuclear power station. 
  "During the inspection several shortfalls in the field of 
safety were discovered at the two units still in operation at 
the power station," the announcement states. 
  "Trained personnel have left and there is no money for spare 
parts," Blix said. 
  "I have recently informed Ukrainian President Leonid 
Kravchuk 
that the Chernobyl reactors are completely unsatisfactory from 
the safety viewpoint," he added. 
  Hans Blix also offered to arrange a meeting in Vienna to 
discuss with Ukraine how the safety crisis at Chernobyl can be 
resolved. According to Thursday's statement from the IAEA in 
Vienna, President Kravchuk has responded positively to the offer. 
  A 70-page report on the visit to Chernobyl by the group of 
inspectors is being put together, but an IAEA spokesman said 
that it is still too early to be able to say whether the 
inspectors' conclusion will be that Chernobyl should be shut 
down completely. 
  The IAEA's negative criticism of safety at Chernobyl was 
received with mixed feelings in Ukraine, SVENSKA DAGBLADET's 
Moscow correspondent reports. 
  "If there were any real danger we would be ordered to shut 
down the installation. I view this simply as a call that we 
continue to improve our work in the field of safety," said 
Mikhail Umanets, the man chiefly responsible for Ukraine's 
nuclear power industry. 
  But there were other voices that agreed completely with the 
IAEA's criticism. Valentin Kupnyy, who is responsible for the 
safety zone around the installation, said that "the sooner the 
installation is shut down, the better it will be for Ukraine and 
the country's neighbors." 
  Valentin Kupnyy also said that those who today support the 
continued exploitation of Chernobyl are more interested in the 
enormous amounts of money that have already been invested than 
in safety improvements. 
  "The IAEA did nothing more than note the facts and this is 
something we have to accept, whether we like it or not," Kupnyy 
said. 
  There are plans to reopen the third reactor, which was 
damaged by fire in 1991, next year. However, the authorities 
have still not reached a decision on a new vault around the 
fourth reactor, which caused the 1986 catastrophe. 
  "I have received information that the protective covering 
that exists today has already begun to crack. We are sitting on 
a time bomb and a frightful catastrophe could occur," Yuriy 
Bagrov, the president of the fund to help the victims of 
Chernobyl, told SVENSKA DAGBLADET during a visit to Kiev a 
little over a month ago. 
  It was the economic crisis in Ukraine that prompted the 
authorities -- despite international protests -- to reopen 
Chernobyl. Ukraine had suddenly been forced to pay world market 
prices for gas and oil from Russia -- something for which there 
was no money. Nuclear power provides 40 percent of Ukraine's 
electricity supplies and in order to reduce dependence on Russia 
Ukraine is intending to bring another three new reactors into 
service over the next 18 months.

  [Text] Under the former regime there were defects in our 
Republic's foreign policy and our country faced a number of 
problems because a balanced policy was not developed on 
relations with neighboring and far away countries. After 
Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev came to power, concrete 
steps were taken to forge good relations with the most developed 
countries, particularly neighboring states. 
  As a result, now Azerbaijan's just voice is being heard more 
clearly in the world and foreign countries are taking reciprocal 
steps to establish bilateral and multilateral ties with our 
Republic. 
  A number of countries are closely following the conflict in 
Nagorno-Karabakh and are condemning the forced occupation of 
Azerbaijani territory, calling for the full and unconditional 
withdrawal of the Armenian occupationist forces. 
  Egypt is one of these friendly countries. 
  Recently, Egyptian President Husni Mubarak invited the 
Azerbaijani president to visit his country whenever convenient. 
  Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov is leaving for 
Egypt today at the invitation of the Egyptian foreign minister. 
The purpose of the visit is to broaden the ties between the 
foreign ministries of the two countries and to examine the 
possibilities of formalizing relations. 
  [Begin recording] [Correspondent Akif Mecidoglu] Honorable 
minister, what is Egypt's place in the foreign policy of the 
newly independent Azerbaijan? 
  [Gasanov] Egypt is one of the states that first recognized 
Azerbaijan. A large Egyptian delegation arrived here soon after 
Azerbaijan gained its independence. All this time, Egypt was 
one of those states that supported and showed an interest in 
Azerbaijan. This is not our first visit there; The Azerbaijani 
foreign minister paid a visit to Egypt during which a number of 
agreements were concluded. It is believed that there is a need 
for this visit to reconfirm and ensure the continuation of these 
agreements. 
  Egypt also very firmly supports Azerbaijan at the United 
Nations in a number of areas and once issued important 
statements on the Azerbaijani-Armenian conflict. All this shows 
that this visit will be the logical conclusion to these efforts. 
  Our aim is to define clear lines in Azerbaijani foreign 
policy, such as the one on members of the UN Security Council, 
CIS countries, and European states. This is a new line being 
forged: Azerbaijan's policy towards Arab states, or Islamic 
states. We will hold very serious talks there and exchange 
views. Husni Mubarak invited Azerbaijani President Geydar 
Aliyev to pay a visit to Egypt in the near future. Mubarak's 
letter was made public. During my talks we will also prepare 
the groundwork regarding which problems to discuss during 
Aliyev's visit to Egypt and in what (?ways) to further our 
relations. 
  [Mecidoglu] I wish you success. 
  [Gasanov] Thank you.

<F P=106> [By AZERTAC correspondent Djamilya Kuliyeva for TASS] </F>
  [Text] Baku April 5 TASS -- Participants in the press 
conference called today in the Academy of Sciences of Azerbaijan 
(ASA) described the forthcoming restarting of the Metsamor 
nuclear power plant as an ill-considered step which will 
threaten hundreds of thousands of people with radioactive 
contamination. 
  ASA President Eldar Salayev and Chairman of the Republic's 
State Environmental Committee Arif Mansurov, who signed a 
petition to this effect to the U.N.O., all international 
organizations, ecologists of contiguous states and foreign 
embassies in Azerbaijan, said that a request to protect the 
region from the danger of radioactivity is also contained in 
resolutions adopted at more than 30 meetings held in Azerbaijan. 
Participants in the meetings also regard this step as a method 
of exerting political pressure on Azerbaijan. 
  According to Eldar Salayev, Armenia's location in a 
seismologically dangerous zone and the lack of conditions for 
burying radioactive waste within its territory will be conducive 
to accidents at the plant, which has been constructed according 
to an out-of-date design. Contamination of such unique 
reservoires as the Caspian Sea by waters of rivers flowing 
through Armenia can also prove fatal for human beings, he said. 
  The ASA president recalled that representatives of Turkey 
and 
Georgia had also expressed their negative views at a meeting of 
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) held last year, 
when the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development 
was openly prepared to finance the repair of the nuclear power 
plant. At that time scientists of Armenia, who also spoke of 
the impossibility of restarting the nuclear power plant, had put 
forward similar arguments after the earthquake in Spitak in 
1988, he said.

  [Text] The State Committee on Ecology and Environmental 
Protection and the Academy of Sciences held a joint press 
conference today. Our colleague Menzere Sadiqova reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Sadiqova] At the very time when the 
ecological (?balance) has already been gravely disrupted, no 
state can remain indifferent to an attempt by a neighboring 
country to use nuclear power. Therefore, the agreement signed 
between Armenia and Russia on the reopening of the Metsamor 
nuclear power plant has raised serious concerns. The reopening 
of the nuclear plant, which poses a danger not only to the 
Caucasus but also to all Caspian Sea countries and which was 
built to operate for a limited duration, will cause radioactive 
waste to travel through Azerbaijan and then to the Caspian Sea 
via rivers. The reopening of this plant, which was planned to 
withstand a seven-point earthquake on the Richter Scale but is 
located in a seismic region susceptible to 9-point earthquakes, 
might amplify the tectonic processes in the Caspian Sea and 
cause yet another Chernobyl tragedy at the very time when the 
level of the Caspian Sea is rising. 
  Arif Mansurov, chairman of the Azerbaijan State Committee on 
Ecology and Environmental Protection, provided detailed 
information on these issues during the news conference. He 
assessed this decision by Armenia and Russia as a lever for 
political pressure. 
  In his statement, Academician Eldar Balayev, president of 
the 
republic's Academy of Sciences, said that the Metsamor nuclear 
plant generates more than 14,00O waste [measurement not 
specified] each year and added that there are many Armenian 
nuclear experts working in various nuclear centers; the 
reopening of this plant might enable them to gather in Metsamor 
in the future and allow them to make use of atomic power for 
nonpeaceful purposes. 
  The news conference was held in Russian and English because 
foreign reporters were also taking part. 
  We are currently in a state of war with Armenia. Do you 
think that by reopening the nuclear plant they could make use of 
it for military purposes? 
  [Mansurov] At present, Armenian politicians are in a bind 
and 
could resort to anything. They could also make use of the waste 
from the nuclear power plant. [end recording]

  [Text] Baku (April 5) TURAN--The Russian oil company Lukoil 
intends to develop the Caspian offshore oil-field "Kyapaz". 
  State Oil Company of Azerbaijan [SOCAR] told Turan that 
Lukoil intends to develop this oil-field either in the framework 
of the consortium of western oil companies or independently. 
  In exchange of that the Russian company is ready to give up 
its share in the consortium or to refuse its participation in 
the development of "Azeri" and "Chirag" oil-fields together with 
western companies. 
  In March 1994 Lukoil and SOCAR signed the agreement. Under 
the agreement, the Russian company has to get the share of 10 
per cent from the participation in the consortium of western oil 
companies. Lukoil has to get one third of Azeri oil explored 
from two oil-fields. That time, official Baku did not conceal 
that this agreement signed with Russian oil company is of 
political character. "Kyapaz" offshore oil-field located 
135-140 km to the coast, close to Guneshli oil-field. Its 
reserves total 25 million tons of oil. Local geologists drilled 
three wells on "Kyapaz". Two of them are gas-bearing and one is 
oil-bearing one. According to SOCAR's specialists, geological 
researches presently conducted are not sufficient to estimate 
reserves of this oil-field exactly.

  [Text] Moscow, Apr 05, BNS -- Estonia is ready to initial 
the draft agreement with Russia on troop withdrawal, said Raul 
Malk, deputy chancellor of the Estonian Foreign Ministry. 
  He said Estonia's position is that the document is "ripe 
enough" for signature. 
  Malk said Estonia now also had more grounds to expect that 
Russian troops will be pulled out from the country by Aug. 31, 
1994. "It seems to me that after the past round of talks at 
Lohusalu the Russian side is more definitely expressing the 
final deadline for the withdrawal as Aug. 31," the Estonian 
diplomat said. 
  Russia, however, insists that the troop withdrawal agreement 
must be initialed together with an agreement on social 
guarantees for its retired officers living in Estonia, similar 
with the document initialed between Russia and Latvia. 
  The head of the Russian delegation, Vasiliy Svirin, in an 
interview with BNS ahead of the talks said that if no agreement 
on the retired military is signed, the deadline of Aug. 31 will 
lose its actuality and the withdrawal will continue under a 
timetable to be determined unilaterally by Russia. 
  Malk in his far more optimistic remarks said that Moscow 
authorities recently had taken a more clearly defined stance in 
their assessment of the foreign policy of the Soviet Union of 
the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact era. 
  Attempts are in evidence, however, he said, not to 
acknowledge the legal aspects of how Estonia became a part of 
the Soviet Union. Therefore, if Russia wishes to become a full 
member of the Council of Europe, she ought to read the rulings 
of this European body on the topic of Estonia's annexation into 
the Soviet Union. He said these rulings contained clear 
formulations which Estonia's position on the issue was based 
upon. 
  Speaking about the border dispute, Malk said work on the 
issue was currently in a stage of a very difficult exchanging of 
opinions. He added that he saw the solution for the problem as 
also an "optimistic" one.

<F P=106> ["Foreign Ministry Press Release" from 6 April EESTI </F>
SENUMID, PAEVALEHT, POSTIMEES, p.1; "News Bulletin" No. 65/94] 
  [Text] Estonia has not changed its positions concerning 
the retired Russian military and the troops withdrawal, Prime 
Minister Mart Laar told the news conference yesterday. Laar 
hoped that Russia will assume constructive views and claimed to 
rely on the Russian leaders' common sense. "Russia is the only 
country whose interests are harmed by the continued troops 
presence in Estonia," he explained. 
  Foreign Ministry vice-chancellor Raul Malk announced that 
Estonia is ready to initial the troops withdrawal agreement and 
claimed that the Russian troops will leave by August 31. He 
also pointed out that Russia's views on the Hitler-Stalin pact 
had been clarified lately, although differences concerning the 
legal aspects of Estonia's annexation still exist. 
  However, head of the Russian delegation Vasily Svirin 
declared in Moscow that the August 31 troop withdrawal deadline 
will be "no longer current" if an agreement on "social 
guarantees" to the retired military will not be signed. 
  A Foreign Ministry press release of Tuesday, April 5, 
announced that Russia had linked the troops withdrawal date with 
two additional conditions. Amendments to Estonian legislation 
were still demanded, as well as the granting of automatic 
residence permits to all retired or reserve officers, regardless 
of the legality of their residence. The demands for the 23 
million dollars to construct housing for the officers being 
withdrawn were also reiterated.

  [Text] The Estonian Prime Minister Mart Laar has told 
INTERFAX that his country will block Russia's full membership in 
the Council of Europe. In connection with the current Helsinki 
seminar of the council on preparing new members which is 
attended by a group of Russian deputies Laar said "the strong 
interest of our neighbor in the East in membership can be viewed 
from a positive angle." 
  However, the prime-minister said, the organization is 
opposed 
to the presence of foreign troops on the territory of a country 
without consent. "Consequently, before becoming a full member of 
the Council of Europe Russia should pull out its troops," Laar 
said. 
  "If any European country wishes to revise the provision, the 
Estonian delegation will be consistent on this question," he 
added. 
  The question of admitting new members to the council is 
decided on the basis of consensus.

  [Text] Tallinn, April 5 -- Russia cannot become member of 
the Council of Europe unless it pulls its forces out of the 
Baltic countries, Estonian Prime Minister Mart Laar told a news 
conference on Tuesday [5 April]. 
  Laar said that Russian MPs have been very active at a 
parliamentary seminar in Helsinki on Russia's chances of 
becoming a member of the Council which "demonstrates 
extraordinary interest in obtaining the status of full member", 
Laar said. 
  "Such interest is very positive from our standpoint as the 
Council of Europe has unanimously accepted an attitude that 
Russia cannot become a full member before its troops are 
withdrawn from the Baltic states completely and without 
conditions," Laar stressed. He also added that even if a member 
country should make any amendments to the stipulation, Estonia 
would not change its views. 
  "It has been clearly said in the Council of Europe that as 
long as Russia continues talking about seizing other countries 
and pursues the near-abroad policy, Russia's becoming a member 
of the Council is hopeless," Laar said while adding that as any 
decision needs to be passed under consensus, "even one is a 
soldier on the battlefield". 
  Only today, the Russian ultra-nationalist Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy who is a member of the Russian delegation said that 
Estonia would soon be reabsorbed by Russia, REUTERS reported 
from Helsinki.

  [Text] Hain Rebas, former defence minister, held a lecture 
in Tallinn yesterday on the influence of the military-industrial 
complex on the Russian home and foreign policy. 
  Rebas announced that he had started to gather information on 
the subject after resigning from the minister's post. The 
conversion of the military industry in Russia has never been 
more than a propaganda move, he claimed, adding that modern 
weaponry is constantly being produced in addition to existing 
stockpiles or armament. The military industry has suffered 
relatively less from the industrial decline than the 
non-military production, Rebas told the audience and added that 
the development and production of biological and chemical 
weapons is going on, despite high-level denials. 
  The ex-minister stressed the influence of the 
military-industrial complex on the Russian politics, mentioning 
the organisations joining the defence industry, their 
representatives in the government circles and in the parliament. 
Russia has given priority to the military industry and adopted 
expansionist foreign policy, Rebas said. He warned that the 
people in Russia are willing to adopt aggressive ideas and 
stressed the need to explain the situation more efficiently in 
the Western countries.

  [Text] Tallinn, April 5 -- After a meeting of Estonian 
agricultural leaders on Tuesday [5 April] at the Ministry of 
Agriculture on export and import of food products, the spokesman 
of the Ministry Valdur Telliskivi told ETA that Russia's 
"discriminatory tariffs policy towards Baltics" has lead to 
tensions, considerably decreasing the export of food products to 
Russia. 
  Telliskivi added that if in February Russia's part of 
Estonia's export of food products had constituted about a half, 
increase in tariffs for about a half made it economically 
senseless to export food products to Russia. 
  Minister of Agriculture Jaan Leetsar, however, said that 
when 
Russia raised tariffs, it was not an economic war against 
Baltics but a Russian "domestic problem", adding that the 
Russian new parliament was strongly influenced by agricultural 
leaders that aimed at protecting domestic producers and reducing 
profits made by the mediators. 
  Leetsar has been continuously advocating protection of 
domestic producers, saying that otherwise the Estonian 
agricultural producers, who are in great economic difficulties, 
would not survive the pressure of cheap subsidized food products 
from foreign countries. 
  New tariffs were applied by the State Customs Office of the 
Russian Federation on March 15 to all states that do not have 
most favoured nations status agreements with Russia, thus 
causing the Baltic states, that do not have such an agreement, 
to pay twice as high tariffs as the rest of Europe. Tariffs on 
export of Russian goods were not raised. 
  Leetsar said that a way out of the situation was for 
Estonian 
farmers and agricultural producers to form export associations, 
that would coordinate the export activities. Director of 
Tallinn Meat Factory Lembit Kivisild said, however, that the 
farmers and producers had so many other problems that it was too 
early to found such organisations.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Opposition Politician Fears Plot </F>
Between Russia and Israel Behind Estonia's Arms Purchase From 
Israel"] 
  [Text] Tallinn, Apr 05, BNS -- Purchasing of arms from 
Israel has caused Estonia major foreign political difficulties 
because a collusion between Israel and Russia lies behind the 
deal, says Estonia's opposition politician Hardo Aasmae. 
  "When the secret arms deal was enacted, our friends in the 
West were interested that Estonia's governing circles wouldn't 
completely fall through this into the Israeli-Russian sphere of 
influence. Therefore also many secret services started trying to 
find out who and how much earned from that deal at (the 
government residence of) Toompea," Aasmae said. 
  He said Israel and Russia were not interested in the success 
of Estonia's foreign policy, since the principles that the 
Baltic country's foreign policy is based upon may negatively 
affect the interests of Russia and Israel. In Aasmae's words 
Israel had also gained a certain lead on the weapons market 
before the Western countries, especially the United States, who 
only recently lifted its arms sales embargo on the Baltics and 
three Balkan states. 
  "There have also been reports that Russian banks are buying 
up the bills of exchange issued by the Estonian side to cover 
the cost of the arms deal, and which Russia can use as an 
argument against Estonia at the talks," the Estonian opposition 
politician said. 
  Aasmae said both Russia and Israel are likely to have 
certain 
common interests on the international arena in prospect, because 
also Israel will have to start defending the interests of its 
settlers in its so-called near abroad, in view of the 
possibility that Palestine may gain its independence. 
  Aasmae also pointed out common features in the development 
of 
the town of Sillamae in Estonia and the Israeli settlements on 
the occupied territories. 
  Taking into account the whole background of the arms deal, 
we 
can state that this became the nail in the coffin of the 
Estonian foreign policy, he said. 
  The Estonian Government signed the 60 million U.S. dollar 
arms deal with TAAS Israel Industries Ltd. on Jan. 7, 1993.

  [Text] Tallinn, Apr 05, BNS -- The Bank of Estonia predicts 
that earnings into the state budget for the first half of this 
year may well exceed the original estimates by as much as 
160-180 million kroons. 
  The more-than-predicted income may even exceed 200 million 
kroons if earnings from the corporate income tax and profits 
from state-owned companies reach the original estimates, the 
macroeconomics department at the Estonian central bank says. 
  The central bank says, however, that the total balance 
depends on the discipline of taxpayers and on the work of the 
tax department. 
  The report says a higher than predicted earnings level in 
all 
sections of the state budget will become a reality only if 
taxpayers attach equal importance to all their obligations. It 
cannot be ruled out that money will be lacking in some regions 
because of big regional differences in the payroll fund. 
  The higher than expected budgetary income is expected to 
have 
a big positive effect so that Estonia could be able to start 
paying higher pensions without the introduction of additional 
taxes. 
  The government departments directly involved in distributing 
budget funds have called increasing the pensions at the current 
tax burden level a too risky step.

<F P=106> [From 5 April EESTI SENUMID, HOMMIKULEHT, pp. 1,3 ; "News </F>
Bulletin" No. 64/94] 
  [Text] Members of Edgar Savisaar's cabinet met in Toompea 
and in Maardu manor on Sunday [3 April] to celebrate the forming 
of independent Estonia's first government four years ago. 
Besides Savisaar, Siiri Oviir, Gennadi Golubkov, Tdnis Kaasik, 
Olev Laanjirv, Ants laos, Jaak Leimann, Vello Lind, Rein Loik, 
Rein Miller, Juri Raidla, Aleksander Sikkal, Jaak Tamm, Raivo 
Vare, Tiit Vihi and Harri Eunapuu attended the meeting and 
signed a joint statement. President Lennart Meri (foreign 
minister in Savisaar's cabinet) also attended the meeting. 
  The statement pointed out that the actions of a government 
have effect only after some years and declared that only history 
will judge the actions of the present government. Estonia's 
freedom is not yet irreversible and the necessary national unity 
is being undermined by the deepening rift between the poor and 
the wealthy, the former cabinet members warned. 
  Twelve ministers, including Savisaar and Vihi, held a news 
conference yesterday. Savisaar called for democratic society, 
systematic work and the involvement of competent specialists in 
the government. He also pointed out that politics has 
degenerated into petty squabbling between different forces. 
  Tiit Vihi declared that his cabinet did not differ 
principally from that of Savisaar. Both ex-premiers rejected 
suggestions that they may be forming a new alliance, but assured 
that they are both ready to dedicate themselves to Estonia's 
progress.

  [Excerpt] Riga, April 5 (LETA) -- Summit meeting of 
Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis and Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin has been scheduled to be held on April 20, according to 
a spokeswoman of the Latvian president. She said that the date 
had been suggested by the Russian ambassador here, Aleksandr 
Rannikh, on behalf of his government. The report has also been 
confirmed by the Foreign Ministry of Russia. 
  The spokeswoman said that talks at the governmental level 
were also set to be held during the visit in Moscow, which means 
that the Latvian delegation would include also Latvian Prime 
Minister Valdis Birkavs and several members of his cabinet. 
During his stay, President Ulmanis also plans to visit the city 
of Krasnoyarsk and its community of ethnic Latvians residing 
there. 
  Sergey Zotov, chief Russian negotiator at the 
Latvian-Russian 
talks, said that a meeting of the two delegations was expected 
to be held in the Latvian seaside resort city of Jurmala next 
week, before the forthcoming summit meeting of the two 
presidents, in order to finalise the agreements which had been 
initialed in Moscow last month. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Riga, Apr 05, BNS -- Russia is neglecting the June 
2, 1993, agreement with Latvia on the use of the Latvian 
airspace by Russian military aircraft, officials said. 
  Moreover, Russia proposed the Latvian Communication Ministry 
to sign a new agreement which provides for free use of the 
airspace and airport services, said Ilgonis Upmalis, head of the 
Latvian bureau monitoring the Russian troop withdrawal. 
  The Russia-proposed agreement also foresees free movement 
for 
aircraft that brings its troops out of Germany. 
  Under the earlier, neglected document, Russia must pay 
Latvia 
for services in accordance with the Communication Ministry 
tariffs. In total, Russia owes more than 25,500 lats to the 
Riga airport and 251,500 U.S. dollars to the Latvian Air 
Communication enterprise. 
  Russia wants to start all calculations of arrears starting 
with the day when the new agreement is signed. Latvia, however, 
insists that the issue of payments be tackled regardless of any 
further agreements. 
  Under the draft agreement, Russia will operate free flights 
in the Latvian airspace to maintain and repatriate Russian 
troops in the Baltic states and Germany. But, Upmalis said, it 
would be impossible to detect which flights are actually needed 
for these purposes. 
  The Latvian Communication Ministry is unlikely to sign up to 
the Russian proposal and it will also demand the repayment of 
the debt, said Uldis Petersons, a spokesman for the ministry. 
  On the other hand, the new agreement is necessary because 
the 
1993 document was only a purpose agreement, Petersons noted.

  [Text] Riga, April 5 (LETA) -- It is completely out of 
question not [as received] to sign one separate accord out of 
the number of agreements which have been initialed in Moscow in 
early March, for the agreements made a whole inseparable 
package, said Edvins Inkens, the Minister of Special 
Assignments, in a statement which was to be understood as the 
government's reply to an appeal submitted to President Guntis 
Ulmanis by a nationalist parliamentary faction "Tevzemei Un 
Brivibai" ("For Fatherland and Freedom"). The faction demanded 
canceling of the agreement on issues concerning social 
protection of retired Russian militaries and their families, 
initialed by the Latvian delegation at Latvian-Russian 
intergovernmental talks. 
  The opposition faction claims that the agreement would pave 
the way for retired Russian militaries to stay and keep living 
here safely, as it was earlier demanded by the union of war 
veterans' rights protection. 
  The Presidium of the Saeima [parliament] on Tuesday [5 
April] 
decided to include the debates on the appeal of the opposition 
faction into the agenda of an extraordinary session of the 
parliament due to be held next Friday.

  [Text] The Latvian Government must still adopt a resolution 
on participation in the Cocom [Coordinating Committee for 
Multilateral Export Controls] organization, the multilateral 
strategic export control coordination committee (?to) monitor 
the export of weapons, strategic resources and technology to 
former countries of the Warsaw Pact and other communist lands. 
It would be in Latvia's interests to accept this system, 
because it would stimulate foreign trade and access to 
investment, chiefly in such fields as electronics, computer 
systems, and high technology, says a press statement from the 
Latvian Foreign Ministry. The member states of the Cocom have 
changed their strategy of activity, to promote the recovery of 
the market of the former communist countries, at the same time 
maintaining control over the investigation... [pauses] the 
spread of weapons, strategic materials, and technology. The 
situation since the end of the Cold War has changed; that is why 
the creation of a new organization is planned.

  [Text] Riga, Apr 06, BNS -- Latvia should decide on 
joining to a new organization which will be formed on the basis 
of the Coordinating Committee For Multilateral Strategic Export 
Controls (COCOM), said Foreign Ministry official Iveta Sers, who 
participated in a COCOM conference in the Hague. 
  The conference stated that the international political 
situation underwent cardinal changes during the last years and 
the cold war was over. 
  Consequently, COCOM states decided to alter their strategies 
to sooner master the markets of ex-communist countries. But 
they also intend to retain the control over the distribution of 
weapons, strategic substances and technologies to the former 
Warsaw Pact foes. 
  The old COCOM restrictions will remain in place until 
September when the foundation of the new organization is 
scheduled. Russia was mentioned among the main founders of the 
new structure, Sers said. 
  The Latvian government has to decide on the participation in 
this new organization yet, the Foreign Ministry said in a 
statement Tuesday [5 April]. 
  Latvia would be interested to join if the system promoted 
its 
foreign trade and foreign capital investment in high-tech 
spheres like computer technologies and electronics. 
  Latvia should create its own system of exports control until 
June in a bid to monitor exports of chemical, biological and 
other strategic materials to prevent their abuse in military 
purposes. 
  The implementation of the anticipated plan may be 
commissioned to the Latvian Development Agency.

  [Text] Riga, Apr 06, BNS -- Latvia's Cabinet passed for 
parliament consideration Tuesday [5 April] its proposals for 
land reform and privatization laws, the Government Information 
Agency reports. 
  Under the proposed amendments, legal persons registered in 
Latvia may become owners of land beneath buildings and 
constructions they acquired as a result of privatization and 
land that is needed to build such buildings and constructions. 
  Physical persons who own land should be allowed to sell it 
to 
legal persons, the government said. 
  The above regulations could be operative until the adoption 
of a special law on the use of land. 
  In addition, the government sent the Saeima (parliament) its 
considerations regarding waivers for public transport users. 
The new regulations cut the number of eligible passengers 
considerably. 
  The group also commissioned the Latvijas Nafta 
state-operated 
enterprise to reduce by 4.6 million lats the debt of farmers for 
fuel supplied in the 1992 spring and autumn season. 
  The government proposed the Saeima to fine 100 lats to 250 
lats for neglect toward rules of non-cash transactions. 
  Finally, the Cabinet allowed the forestry service to auction 
10,000 cubic meters of timber from state-owned felling sites. 
The acquired resources would be used to reconstruct the Ligatne 
paper mill.

<F P=106> ["Agreements on Reaching Civic Accord in Russia /8 </F>
Blocks-Pages/ Draft/ Version 1/ 27.03.94" -- ITAR-TASS headline] 
  [Text] Russia now needs civic accord as never before. The 
tasks ahead are too complicated and difficult to squander the 
strength of society in political confrontation. There will be 
no victors in an irreconcilable struggle. There can only be one 
result of such struggle -- the destruction of Russia and 
suffering of millions of Russian people. 
  There are no such problems in Russia which cannot be 
resolved 
without intensifying tension in society or resorting to violence 
or riding rough shod over the laws and common sense. Dialogue, 
consultations and negotiations, the search for meeting points 
and common positions and sensible compromises should become the 
fundamental norm of public and political life. 
  Civic accord should be reached on the basis of respect for 
various world views, political convictions, national and 
cultural traditions, and the dignity of the individual. 
  In order to reach civic accord the president of the Russian 
Federation, the Federal Assembly, the goverment, the constituent 
parts of the Russian Federation, political parties, trade unions 
and other public organizations conclude this agreement. 
<H5>  I. Political Life in Society </H5>
  1. In their activities the sides pledge to adhere strictly 
to the principles of democracy, civic society, federalism, 
law-governed state, the separation of powers and the priority of 
human rights and liberties. 
  The sides view the Russian Federation Constitution in force 
as the foundation of Russia's legal system and statehood. 
Emphasizing the necessity to observe the constitution, the 
sides will make use of the multilateral conciliation procedures 
to study and disseminate the experience of its application and 
to coordinate the elaboration of constitutional amendments. 
  In order to ensure civic accord the sides pledge to refrain 
from introducing into the Constitution such amendments as would 
destabilize the situation in society. 
  2. The sides regard as the foremost task a joint elaboration 
of electoral laws, the law on parties and the law on referendum. 
The sides take upon themselves the obligation not to initiate 
political campaigns in order to carry out early elections of 
federal bodies of power not provided for in the Constitution 
currently in force. 
  3. In all their activities, including political activities, 
the sides pledge to renounce violence in all its forms as a 
means of resolving problems that emerge in society. The sides 
pledge not to appeal for violence, nor to kindle social, 
national or religious strife, nor to suppress or oppress those 
of dissenting views nor to incite citizens to it. Those who 
organize rallies, demonstrations or strikes assume 
responsibility for a peaceful nature of these events and for 
staging them in strict compliance with the laws. 
  The sides regard it as their duty to prompt all forces in 
society to get involved in the process of ensuring there is calm 
in the country and that a spirit of cooperation is created. 
  4. The sides pledge to refuse to use the mass media in an 
uncivilised or an incorrect manner in order to further their 
political interests. 
  5. With due consideration for the grandeur of Russian 
history, its heroic and tragic pages, the contribution of the 
generations of our citizens who gave their strengths to serving 
the Fatherland, the sides will avoid offensive assessments of 
the past and mud slinging. The sides appeal not to use 
assessments of the events in August 1991 and in September and 
October 1993 as reasons to deepen confrontation and opposition. 
<H5>  II. Regional policy </H5>
  1. The sides regard it as necessary immediately to take 
measures to: 
  - Strengthen the unity of Russia's economic, political and 
legal space; 
  - coordinate the activities of regional authorities in the 
solution of tasks which go beyond the remit of individual 
regions; 
  - establish a single labor market on the basis of an 
unswerving observance of the code of labor laws, conventions and 
recommendations of the International Labor Organization 
throughout the country; 
  - to compensate the regions from the budget for the 
consequences of the decisions by the federal state bodies in 
such cases when regional interests have been made to suffer in 
the process of pursuing statewide interests. 
  2. the sides agree that it is necessary to adopt the 
following federal laws: 
  - On the general principles of organizing representative and 
executive power in the components of the federation; 
  - on the principles of the demarcation of powers and areas 
of authority between the federal level and the components of the 
federation; 
  - on the principles of local self-government. 
  3. The parties recognize the need to widen the economic 
independence of the components of the federation by means of 
strengthening the taxation base of their budgets and federal 
guarantees of the per-capita minimum of the region's budget 
through the federal subsidy fund. At the same time the 
responsibility of the power bodies of the components of the 
federation for collecting federal taxes on their territories is 
being enhanced. 
  4. The parties emphasize that implementation of the rights 
of the components of the federation is possible only if the 
country's state integrity and its political, economic and legal 
unity are guaranteed. To this end the components of the 
federation agree to refrain from altering their constitutional 
status in the course of two years. 
  The constitutions, charters and other legislative acts of 
the 
subjects of the federation will be drawn up in accordance with 
-- and elaborated anew in strict accordance with -- the federal 
Constitution. 
  The federal and regional power bodies declare a moratorium 
on 
the signing of bilateral treaties between them on the 
demarcation of areas of authority and powers until the adoption 
of a federal law on the principles of the demarcation of powers 
and areas of authority between the federal and regional bodies 
of state power. 
  5. The parties emphasize that, with the objective of 
strengthening local self-government, a package of federal laws 
should be elaborated and adopted in the first half-year, 
envisaging as follows: 
  - The general principles of the organization and functioning 
of bodies of local self-government; 
  - the guarantees of the independence of local 
self-government bodies in solving local issues; 
  - the provision by local self-government of an independent 
taxation base and the right to establish the normatives of 
payments into their own budget, with guarantees of a budget 
minimum on the part of the state; 
  - the rights of local self-government bodies to 
participate in solving problems common to the regions and to 
Russia as a whole. 
<H5>  III. Ethnic Policy </H5>
  1. The sides pledge that they will abide strictly by the 
principle whereby the source of power in component parts of the 
federation is their multi-ethnic population; representatives of 
no ethnic community have the exclusive right to assume control 
over the territory, institutes of power or resources. 
  2. The sides will support various specific forms of 
self-organization in the ethnic communities, excluding those 
which are destructive to state unity and territorial integrity 
of the Russian Federation. The sides think that national 
associations [natsionalnyye assotsiatsii], unions 
[ob'yedineniya], fellowships [zemlyachestva] and other types of 
national-cultural unions are in need of a special state support 
scheme. 
  3. The sides stress that the carrying out of social and 
economic changes in the areas inhibited by small peoples and 
ethnic groups should be accompanied by a complex of measures 
aimed at retaining their traditional lifestyle. 
  4. The sides think that it is necessary to reinforce state 
and public supervision of the observance of human rights as far 
as nationalities' matters are concerned, not to allow and to 
avert any manifestations of ethnic, racial or religious 
discrimination. 
  5. The sides call upon national movements and parties to 
declare a moratorium on demanding border changes and the 
established administrative and territorial division. 
  6. The sides acknowledge their obligation to protect 
actively the rights and interests of Russians living in other 
states, and to receive and make provision for compatriots 
resettling in Russia, providing them with all-round support. 
<H5>  IV. Socioeconomic Policy </H5>
  The sides agree that their joint efforts should be directed 
toward overcoming the socioeconomic crisis and continuation of 
the economic reform in the interests of Russia's population. In 
order to stabilize the socioeconomic situation in 1994 the 
following urgent problems must be solved: 
  - Achieving a steady, predictable and controllable level of 
inflation; 
  - overcoming the nonpayments crisis; 
  - ensuring the necessary level of social protection, the 
efficiency and precise targeting of social aid; 
  - stopping the general decline of production levels before 
the year ends; 
  - starting the positive structural transformations and 
increasing investment activity; 
  - strengthening economic cooperation within the CIS 
framework; 
  - strengthening the country's position in the world market. 
  The sides believe that a standing economic conference should 
be set up in order to elaborate the agreed proposals in the 
sphere of economic policy for the period this agreement remains 
in force. Those attending it should be representatives of the 
president, the government, the Central Bank of Russia, the 
Federation Council, the State Duma, the main professional 
associations of the working people and the associations of 
manufacturers and entrepreneurs. 
  Over the next two months the economic conference is to 
prepare specific proposals on current problems in economic 
policy, which will be submitted to the president and the 
Federation Council. 
  For the duration of the economic stabilization measures: 
  1. The trade unions, their associations and organizations of 
their members undertake not to carry out and not to take part in 
organizing strikes for the purpose of redistributing budget 
finances or allocating subsidies or benefits from state credits 
or taxation to individual industries or territories, or for 
other purposes having nothing directly to do with wages, working 
conditions or saving jobs. 
  2. Associations of manufacturers and entrepreneurs and their 
members undertake to refrain from unjustified stoppages of 
activities and production, the breaking of commitments to 
suppliers and customers, to the budget and banks, and the misuse 
of state investment resources. 
  3. Organs of state power, associations of manufacturers and 
entrepreneurs and their members undertake to attend conciliation 
procedures for the settlement of labor disputes, to provide the 
trade unions with sufficient information about the state of the 
relevant budgets and the position of enterprises, and to ensure 
that the trade unions have the organizational back-up for their 
statutory activities. 
<H5>  V. The Security of Citizens and the State </H5>
  1. The parties consider the guarantee of the individual 
security of the citizens and the fight against organized crime 
and corruption to be the most important task. The parties 
pledge to provide the necessary legal base to solve the problem 
of crime and to carry out the reform of the law-enforcement 
bodies. 
  2. The parties pledge to prevent: 
  - The irreversible technological lagging behind and 
isolation 
of the country's economy from the world economy; 
  - the social regression and disintegration of society and 
the destruction of the environment; 
  - the reduction in defense capability and the weakening of 
the social protection of military servicemen, persons discharged 
to the reserve and members of their families. 
  3. The parties oppose the creation of any kind of armed and 
militarized formations by political parties and movements and 
public and commercial organizations, and should they be so 
created to call for their immediate disbandment. 
  4. The sides consider attempts to draw the state's military 
structures into supporting political programs and demands to be 
illegal and immoral. 
  5. The sides consider the reform of the army and navy an 
urgent task facing the state and society. The sides undertake 
to ensure the elaboration of the concept for the armed forces' 
move to a professionally based service. 
  6. The sides support the participation of political parties, 
movements and public organizations in the elaboration of the 
concept of national security during the transition period. 
  7. The sides undertake to help achieve the cessation of 
armed conflicts and support stability in the states bordering 
Russia. 
<H5>  VI. Spiritual, Moral, Ethical and Cultural Values </H5>
  The sides emphasise that the love for the Fatherland, 
freedom 
and the moral duty to the country and society, religious and 
humanistic values and creative work should become the basis for 
the resurrection of Russia. To reassert these values tirelessly 
is a matter not just for every member of society, but for the 
state. The sides pledge: 
  1. To restore and propagate Russia's ancient spiritual and 
moral traditions, to assert by words and deeds the norms of 
moral conduct in politics, the economy and social life. The 
mass media and educational, scientific and cultural 
establishments and religious organizations, the efforts of which 
should meet with state and public support, have a special role 
to play in this process. 
  2. To pursue agreed policies in the area of the moral, 
spiritual, cultural, patriotic and aesthetic upbringing of 
children and young people. To identify potential to stimulate 
children's and young people's creativity, physical education and 
sport, to organize leisure time for children and adolescents, 
for which purpose the relevant activities by public, religious 
and other organizations should be encouraged. 
  3. To facilitate the preservation of the system of free 
basic, specialized secondary and vocational technical education 
and also to prevent a decline in the existing level of financing 
of higher education. To encourage the establishment of 
non-state establishments affording general access to higher 
education to prepare specialists for vitally important areas of 
the economy, public life, science, culture and education. 
  4. To identify resources to finance cultural and scientific 
establishments at a level commensurate with developed countries. 
In subsidizing these establishments, preference is to be given 
to structures which implement priority state programs and which 
do not have alternative sources of financing that would ensure 
the survival of these structures. 
  5. To provide a taxation policy on favorable terms with 
regard to scientific, cultural, educational and health 
establishments. With the help of corresponding taxation benefits 
to encourage the provision of charitable assistance to 
educational, scientific and cultural establishments and 
religious organizations. 
  6. To assist the creation of a common national fund for 
supporting Russian talent, this work to be financed by the state 
and public, economic, commercial and other structures. 
<H5>  The Conditions and Mechanisms for Implementing this Agreement </H5>
  The parties are united in that reaching civic accord in 
Russia should be taken as a process in which all the forces of 
society adhering to the principles of the present agreement are 
invited to take an active part. 
  To elaborate a mechanism for implementing the provisions of 
the present agreement a conciliation commission is being formed 
from the plenipotentiary representatives of the Russian 
Federation president, the government, the chambers of the 
Federal Assembly, factions of the State Duma and also a number 
of prominent public and cultural figures. 
  In order for the conciliation commission to work through 
specific issues, conferences, round tables and temporary working 
groups are being organized. 
  The parties stress that the implementation of the present 
agreement should be carried out in strict compliance with the 
Constitution currently in force and the laws of the Russian 
Federation. 
<H5>  The Responsibility of the Parties to the Agreement </H5>
  The parties who have signed this agreement are aware of 
their 
responsibility toward society and history for their failure to 
fulfil the obligations which they have undertaken. 
  The conciliation commission monitors the compliance with the 
provisions enshrined in the agreement and establishes facts of 
violation of the provisions of the agreement by one or several 
parties. 
  If facts of violation of the agreement are established, the 
conciliation commission: 
  - makes a relevant statement in the media; 
  - raises the issue of expelling the corresponding member 
from the number of signatories to the agreement; 
  - presents a proposal on measures of political 
accountability of the persons guilty of violating the provisions 
of the agreement, up to relieving them of their high official 
posts or revoking their powers as deputies. 
  The media are to ensure the possibility of open public 
control over compliance with the agreement. 
<H5>  Duration of the Agreement and Conditions for Accepting New </H5>
Parties 
  The agreement is concluded for two years and can be extended 
provided there is consent of the parties who have signed it. 
  The agreement is open for signing by new parties while it 
remains in force. 
  The parties address Russia's constructive forces with a 
proposal to sign the agreement.

  [Text] On Wednesday morning President Boris Yeltsin might 
have a meeting with the chairmen of the two chambers of the 
Russian Federal Assembly Vladimir Shumeyko and Ivan Rybkin. The 
draft agreement on civic accord is expected to be the main item 
of discussion. 
  On Monday evening the document was reportedly sent by the 
president to the State Duma. The draft has been circulated 
among parliamentary groups for discussion. 
  The text submitted to the State Duma does not in fact differ 
from the version Yeltsin [submitted] to the speakers of the 
houses last Thursday. The only amendment made by Yeltsin was the 
exclusion from the section on the social and economic policies 
of the recognition of the need to raise salaries and wages with 
due account to inflation, to guarantee their timely payment, to 
hold back the prices of key food stuffs, to take steps to 
guarantee employment and to help territories where the threat of 
unemployment is the greatest. 
  Interfax has been informed of Rybkin writing a letter to the 
president requesting to replace the section on the security of 
individuals and the state by a more detailed version approved in 
advance by the working group that drafted the document.

<F P=106> [Yuriy Kononenko article incorporating interview with </F>
presidential aide G. Satarov; place and date not given: 
"Kremlin Hopes for Success of Peace Agreement. Immoderate 
Opposition Continues To Gamble on Confrontation"] 
  [Text] The Agreement on Civil Peace in Russia is expected 
to be signed on 28 April. By then, in addition to "Russia's 
Choice" representatives, all leaders of State Duma factions will 
have been to the Kremlin. The president's next consultation 
will be with representatives of parties of a centrist 
persuasion. B. Yeltsin will then hold a second meeting of the 
working group, which will determine the procedure for signing 
this document and the mechanism for implementing it. In 
addition, he is also expected to meet with heads of 
administration and the leaders of the Russian republics, who 
will evidently also participate in signing the agreement at the 
second stage (it is envisaged that at the first stage the 
document will be signed by the approximately 25 main political 
forces in Russia). 
  Since the text of the document is still being kept secret, 
numerous questions arise. Including: Can it be acceptable to 
political forces with diametrically opposed ideologies? And the 
recent report, citing I. Rybkin, that the State Duma will not 
examine the proposed version of the agreement pending the 
preparation of a new one has caused confusion and a wave of 
speculation. It was immediately interpreted as a rejection by 
the State Duma of the ideas and provisions embedded in the 
document. This report drove presidential aide G. Satarov to 
telephone I. Rybkin. His answer was unexpected: "It's a fake. 
I said nothing of the kind," I. Rybkin stated. 
  I assumed that I would hear from G. Satarov about clashes in 
the course of the work on the document, but the president's aide 
was upbeat. He has already consulted with many factions in 
parliament -- both those of a democratic persuasion and those on 
the opposite flank. As yet he has not had occasion to hear any 
terms or ultimatums expressed. 
  Such a constructive approach by parliamentarians, including 
from the opposition camp, who only recently were stirring up 
society with their decision to amnesty the participants in the 
October putsch, puts you on your guard. But the explanation for 
this phenomenon in the presidential entourage is as follows: 
The opposition sees the agreement as a guarantee of the 
stability which it needs to implement its long-term plans -- to 
attempt to come to power in the 1996 elections in a calm 
atmosphere by constitutional means. 
  But it is obvious that the immoderate opposition is 
continuing to gamble on confrontation. This is confirmed by A. 
Rutskoy's PRAVDA interview. "What accord? And with whom.... 
These games involving consensuses and agreements must be 
stopped...." 
  "What is the current state of readiness of the Agreement on 
Civil Peace?" I asked G. Satarov. 
  [Satarov] I sent the latest version to the State Duma 4 
April. It has already been distributed to committees for study 
and further work. It has proved possible to work out a scheme 
which promises to make the document viable. I am talking about 
a permanently operating mechanism for building accord. Such 
accord is only possible when specific problems in public life 
are singled out. In this connection the document provides for 
the creation of a conciliation commission, which is called upon 
to keep the situation in the country under review. If conflicts 
emerge "roundtables" will be held to conduct a collective 
analysis, and ways to solve the problems which arise will be 
sought by a working group involving all interested parties. 
  Disputes and conflicts on the path toward seeking accord 
could arise if someone attempts to "reconcile" various 
ideologies in this document or to incorporate elements of party 
programs in it. 
  To date not one of the parties represented in parliament has 
opposed the inclusion of measures of prohibition in the 
agreement. And they are indeed present; in particular, there is 
a provision for prohibiting political parties, movements, and 
commercial structures from creating any kind of armed formations 
and for the renunciation of illegal attempts to involve the 
power structures in supporting political objectives.

  [Excerpt] On the instructions of President Boris Yeltsin 
the official text of the draft agreement on civic peace in 
Russia he signed was sent to the media on Tuesday evening. 
  According to a well-informed source in the presidential 
administration, the document was simultaneously submitted to 25 
potential sides to the agreement -- political parties and public 
movements. The same source said a working group which drafted 
the agreement is expected to hold a session on April 18-20 
chaired by Yeltsin. It will discuss proposals and amendments 
suggested by political groups and individuals to work out the 
final version. Earlier the president named April 28 as the 
possible date for signing the agreement. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Boris Yeltsin said it was premature to raise the 
question of whether he intends to be a candidate in the next 
presidential elections. In an interview for an INTERFAX 
correspondent, the president said that in the course of the two 
remaining years before the elections, he saw his main task as 
being the establishment of stable mutual relations between the 
executive, legislative, and judicial authorities. 
  He said that new relations were already beginnig to take 
shape with the Federation Council and the State Duma. The 
president said the second task was to strengthen Russia's unity. 
Acknowledging that the process of the establishment of federal 
relations was at times painful and tense, Boris Yeltsin replied 
that this process was, as a whole, under control. 
  The president regards the economy as the third priority 
area. 
He expressed the hope that in the coming two years, the 
numerous ills of our economy would start to vanish and that we 
would all feel better for that.

  [Text] Every possible effort to prevent a tragedy like the 
October events in Moscow should for any politician of Russia be 
the paramount aim, the main requirement both of himself and of 
his comrades-in-arms. Russian President Boris Yeltsin stated 
this in an interview to the INTERFAX agency. 
  There should be only one road to achieving one's political 
aims -- elections, the president noted. In his view, we are 
assimilating the lesson of the October tragedy, albeit with 
difficulty. Boris Yeltsin named as evidence of this the 
drafting of an agreement on civil peace. which an ever broader 
circle of parties and organizations are voicing the wish to join. 
  Yet another lesson of those dark days is the vital necessity 
for the strengthening of the state, the president declared. 
Nobody should be allowed to destroy state buildings, mount 
assaults upon television, and form armed detachments. 
  In the words of Boris Yeltsin, there is now the necessary 
minimum for strengthening the state. The Constitution has been 
adopted by the vote of all the people. The president noted that 
the new basic law had put an end to dual power and opened up a 
peaceful, civilized road to the resolution of contradictions.

<F P=106> [Report by Pavel Anokhin: "President Begins Series of </F>
Meetings With Representatives of Parliamentary Factions"] 
  [Text] Russian President Boris Yeltsin had a meeting 4 
April, at his initiative, with a delegation from the "Russia's 
Choice" parliamentary faction headed by Yegor Gaydar. The 
conversation touched on the consolidation of democratic forces, 
the threat of fascism, and the task of improving the legislative 
base for the continuation of reforms. The writer Alla Gerber, 
who took part in the meeting, shared her impressions of the 
exchange of opinions, in an interview with ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI's 
correspondent. She said that the Russian president gives the 
impression of being a perfectly healthy and calm person who 
responds sensitively to his interlocutor and knows how to listen 
and to hear. 
  "Boris Nikolayevich came out against the creation of any 
kind 
of presidential party," Alla Gerber stressed, "but promised to 
support the democrats and the party of which `Russia's Choice' 
is the initiator...." 
  In the opinion of the writer and deputy, in the regions 
there 
is great interest in Gaydar's emerging party, but people have 
certain misgivings about victorious communists being in power. 
Developing the topic under discussion, the "Russia's Choice" 
representatives advised Boris Yeltsin to address the Russians 
more often, to participate in democratic actions more actively, 
and to define more clearly and precisely both his own positions 
and those of his entourage. "The unclear, unspecific nature of 
certain pronouncements and actions by the presidential team is 
confusing people's perception of Boris Yeltsin's intentions and 
his allies," Alla Gerber said. 
  The problem of legal backup for further Russian reforms was 
touched on. The cornerstone of this, in the general opinion, 
should be the urgent adoption of laws on joint-stock companies, 
securities, and stock exchanges. It goes without saying that 
the "Russia's Choice" delegation proposed tougher legal norms 
regarding the kindling of interethnic hostility and fascist 
propaganda. The delegation called on the president to take the 
threat of fascism in Russia seriously and to act openly and 
resolutely in this regard. Boris Yeltsin expressed approval for 
the "Russia's Choice" initiative on holding parliamentary 
hearings in the near future on the danger of fascism in Russia. 
  It was the mutual opinion that the discussion took place in 
a 
calm and constructive atmosphere and demonstrated yet again that 
one old friend is better than two new ones. The president 
promised the legislators that he would hold similar meetings 
with deputies from the other parliamentary factions in the State 
Duma. 
  Whether the meeting will be the starting gun for a new 
rallying of democrats, time will tell. But one thing is clear 
today: Rumors that Boris Yeltsin has lost the political 
initiative were patently exaggerated. And suggestions that he 
intends to run in the next presidential elections once again as 
leader of all democrats are apparently not without foundation.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Search for Way to Rapprochement"; </F>
followed by text of Draft Confederative Agreement submitted by 
Sergey Shakhray, leader of Party of Russian Unity and Accord] 
  [Text] The proposals which Nursultan Nazarbayev advanced 
recently on a search for new forms of integration of independent 
states and on the creation of the Eurasian Union attracted the 
wide attention of various political forces and elicited 
ambivalent comments. 
  Sergey Shakhray, leader of the Party of Russian Unity and 
Accord [PRUA] and Russian Federation minister of nationalities 
affairs and regional policy, in turn issued a statement in 
support of the idea of a confederative union of Eurasian states 
and passed to the editorial office the draft Confederative 
Agreement which he advanced in 1992, which was announced in 
the PRUA election platform, and which is published below. The 
party's statement says, in particular, that "not only the 
peoples but also many political forces in the CIS countries are 
already prepared not just to discuss the idea of creating such a 
union but also to work out specific questions of its activity." 
  We advance, the PRUA declares, the idea of forming an 
International Working Group comprising representatives of 
countries which wish to conclude the Confederative Agreement or 
of political and public organizations which share this desire. 
We are also prepared to take on the resolution of 
organizational-technical and financial questions relating to 
ensuring this group's activity. 
  The draft Confederative Agreement, the statement reads, 
should be regarded as a conceptual base for a future interstate 
treaty. The simultaneous elaboration of a package of necessary 
treaties and agreements directly associated with the idea of a 
Eurasian confederation is proposed. 
  (Draft) Confederative Agreement 
  The Russian Federation, 
  acknowledging the historical significance and 
effectiveness of the interstate relations achieved within the 
framework of the CIS, 
  striving, in the name of the interests of the peoples of 
the High Contracting Parties, for further integration and 
effective cooperation on economic, sociocultural, and defense 
questions, 
  confirming that none of the provisions of this agreement 
is directed or can be interpreted to the detriment of the CIS or 
of the treaty relations and other relations of each of the 
contracting parties among themselves or with other states, and 
preserving the independence and the inviolable sovereign rights 
of the states that are party to the agreement, have [as 
published] agreed on the following. 
  I: The High Contracting Parties conclude the Confederative 
Agreement, whose contents and the ways to implement which are 
defined by this document and by treaties signed on its basis. 
  II: The High Contracting Parties have agreed to the creation 
of the Confederative Economic Community (CEC) as the 
basis of the Confederative Agreement. 
  The CEC ensures: 
  the revival and development of a common market of the 
Confederative Agreement member countries as a single economic 
area without customs borders and not hindering free cooperation 
among business subjects or the circulation of commodities, 
services, and capital within the Community, 
  the creation of a common currency system and banking 
system based on the preservation of the national currencies of 
these states and on agreed principles of credit and monetary 
regulation, 
  the implementation of a concerted customs and 
export-import policy in respect of states which are not parties 
to the Confederative Agreement,

  [Text] Moscow -- Yuriy Baturin, the Russian president's 
national security aide, has announced that the Statute of the 
Federal Counterintelligence Service actually marks the end of a 
series of constant transformations of the special services. 
This structure, necessary for society and the state, Yu. 
Baturin pointed out, will be protected "from emotional, 
incompetent, and time-serving changes" so as to create 
corresponding conditions for normal work in the new situation. 
In this connection, the Russian president's aide dismissed 
attempts by certain foreign circles "to influence the leadership 
of Russia with the aim of radically reforming Russian special 
services."

  [Text] Moscow, 5 Apr -- "According to the information we 
have from the flight recorder, it has been established that the 
son and the daughter of a member of the crew, who were flying as 
passengers, were on the flight deck. Contrary to the 
regulations, he had been demonstrating and explaining the 
principles of flying the aircraft". This sensational, and 
unfortunately, very sad, news about the reason why the airbus 
A-310 fell from the sky was confirmed in an exclusive interview 
for an ITAR-TASS correspondent at the public relations 
department of the Russian Ministry of Transport. These findings 
were based on a first study by members of the government 
commission on 4 April of the results of the decoding of 
parametric information registered by the on-board recorders. 
  The Moscow-Hong Kong flight SU-593 of the A-310 aircraft 
came 
to a tragic end on 22 March near Mezhdurechenck in Kemerovo 
Oblast. Seventy-five people died in the crash. 
  It has been established that the flight from Moscow to 
Novokuznetsk was going according to schedule. There were no 
indications of any malfunctions of the aircraft, its engines or 
systems. 
  Four minutes after passing Novokuznetsk, as a consequence of 
what happened on the flight deck, the airbus "banked to the 
right more than it should have done, causing it to descend 
steeply and to strike the ground." 
  A document presented to ITAR-TASS this evening points out 
that the actions of the crew and the disaster situation 
procedures are being investigated by highly qualified 
specialists. 
  The commission is continuing its work.

  [Text] Moscow April 6 TASS -- Yet another State Duma member 
announced on Wednesday he is quitting the faction of the Liberal 
Democratic Party [LDPR] of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. Vladimir 
Novikov followed suit of Vladimir Borzyuk protesting against the 
"populist policy" of Zhirinovskiy. However, deputy chairman of 
the party Aleksandr Vengerovskiy played down the event saying 
there is nothing dramatic about it. 
  "There were a lot of fellow-travellers among LDPR members", 
he told TASS. "The LPDR was, is and will be the decisive 
political factor in Russia" in the coming two years and even 
longer, he added. 
  "Some party members used to scare us that a coup would take 
place at the LDPR congress and that Vladimir Zhirinovskiy would 
quit the party. But this did not happen", Vengerovskiy said 
adding that people are "free to unite in any groups".

  [Text] Vladimir Borzyuk, who is head of the Orel 
organization of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR], 
and Vladimir Novikov, chairman of the Udmurt regional 
organization, have today announced their departure from the Duma 
faction of the LDPR. This was reported by INTERFAX and 
ITAR-TASS agencies. 
  Vladimir Borzyk said his decision was made because he 
disagreed with the populist actions of LDPR leader Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy, who was inflicting damage not only on the party 
itself but also on the principles of morality and ethics common 
to all mankind. At the same time, Vladimir Borzyuk noted that 
he stll considered himself an adherent of the LDPR Charter, and 
in his future activity as a deputy outside the faction he would 
pursue the program with which the LDPR had gone to the elections 
on 12 December last year and from which, in his opinion, 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy had deviated.

<F P=106> [ITAR-TASS report: "AP on LDPR Leader Vladimir </F>
Zhirinovskiy's Family Tree"] 
  [Text] New York -- Civil records attest that until he was 
18 years old Vladimir Zhirinovskiy used the name Eydelshteyn, AP 
reports. The documents in question were discovered by a 
journalist cooperating with AP and CNN TV in four archives in 
Alma-Ata [Almaty], the city where the current LDPR [Liberal 
Democratic Party of Russia] chairman was born. 
  The birth records register Zhirinovskiy under the surname 
Eydelshteyn. It transpires that his father was called Volf 
Isakovich Eydelshteyn. According to Zhirinovskiy, who is 
renowned for his anti-Semitism, neither he himself nor his 
father were Jews and his father's name was Volf Andreyevich 
Zhirinovskiy. 
  The Alma-Ata archives illustrate that no one with that name 
ever lived in Alma-Ata. AP says that the name of the LDPR 
leader's father is in actual fact a combination of the names of 
the first and second husbands of V. Zhirinovskiy's mother -- 
Aleksandra Pavlovna. Her first husband -- Andrey Vasilyevich 
Zhirinovskiy -- died of tuberculosis in August 1944, 18 months 
before the future LDPR leader was born. Her second husband was 
Volf Isakovich Eydelshteyn, who married Aleksandr Pavlovna five 
months before Vladimir was born. 
  The documents found in the archives also attest that the 
18-year old Zhirinovskiy asked the Alma-Ata City Executive 
Committee to change the name Eydelshteyn to his current name and 
received permission to do so in June 1964. He signed the 
application using his real name, Eydelshteyn. 
  LDPR Press Secretary Grigoriy Serebrennikov said in Moscow 
that these documents "are forgeries." When asked by AP 
journalists for a meeting with Zhirinovskiy himself, his press 
secretary demanded $5,000 for a half-hour conversation with the 
LDPR leader. The question of Zhirinovskiy's nationality, AP 
points out, is of political significance and casts doubt on the 
LDPR leader's sincerity owing to the latter's constant attacks 
on Jews.

local mafia was killed today, a reliable source told ITAR-TASS. 
Kvantrishvili was shot at 20:30 today when he was leaving 
prestigious Krasnopresnenskiye baths and died while being 
transorted to hospital. The baths were reportedly included in a 
zone of his clan's control.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Podzharskiy report: "Chernomyrdin Wants To Be </F>
Economically Secure. MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS Has Sparked a 
Witch-Hunt in Government"] 
  [Text] An extremely intriguing government document marked 
"Not for the Press" has found its way into the hands of 
MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS. The directive issued by Chernomyrdin as 
early as last March sets forth fairly ambiguous things that 
could not but elicit our curiosity. 
  What is hidden behind the trite words about "The 
Fundamentals 
of a Strategy To Ensure the Economic Security of the Russian 
Federation?" And why did Viktor Chernomyrdin task the Economy 
Ministry and the Security Council's Interdepartmental Commission 
on Economic Security with drawing up within two weeks (!) the 
requisite organizational-methodological documents? As I 
understand it, the organizational-methodological documents are 
just as needed for drawing up a state's general strategy as an 
umbrella is for a fish. What is the meaning of a provision 
instructing the Finance Ministry to finance scientific 
developments? Scientific developments are one thing, money is 
quite another. 
  According to MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS information, apart from 
this ambiguous paper Chernomyrdin has signed another two 
documents marked "Top Secret" and "Of Special Importance" that 
are written in much more specific language. Bearing in mind 
Mirzayanov's sad fate, we only know that they deal with the 
creation of an Economic Security Service at the Economy Ministry 
(that it will be part of the Economy Ministry is clear even from 
our paper, which obliges federal agencies to submit their 
proposals to it by 1 May). Do you see the difference -- 
fundamentals there and a security service here? 
  Then everything comes into focus. Including provisions 
stipulating that a democratic order be maintained in any 
conditions (although this is at odds with the Constitution -- a 
state order is to be chosen by the people, not by Mr. 
Chernomyrdin) and that the production capacities of the defense 
sector be preserved in those same any conditions. The Economic 
Security Service, carefully hidden behind a veil of secrecy for 
some time to come (otherwise why make its creation such a 
mystery?) will defend the interests of the government to the 
last man. A downright economic surveillance. And this despite 
the fact that we already have economic counterintelligence as 
part of the Federal Counterintelligence Service [FCS], although 
we have learned that the Chekists have also been directly been 
involved in the effort. But the security of the state is one 
thing, that of the government quite another. Down with 
conversion and democracy! Long live democracy under V.S. 
Chernomyrdin! 
  P.S. Valentin Sergeyev, chief of the government's press 
service, having failed to answer any of our questions, was 
completely bewildered and long tried to find out where 
MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS obtained the secret document. The next 
day he said that the staffer who had given us the directive (?!) 
was identified and would be severely reprimanded. There you are 
-- the first case for the fledgling service.

<F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>
  [Excerpts] By the end of the year, the rate of inflation in 
Russia is due to be seven to eight percent per month, while the 
budget deficit will be no more than 10 percent of gross domestic 
product. The dollar-ruble exchange rate is expected to reach 
3,000 rubles to the dollar by the middle of the year and 4,000 
to 4,500 rubles by the end of the year. This forecast was given 
by Vladimir Petrov, first deputy minister of finance, at today's 
hearings on the draft state budget at the State Duma. [passage 
omitted] 
  The government is proposing a tight financial policy. The 
main priority is to quickly suppress the inflationary process 
and to achieve financial stabilization. The principal methods 
are to cut state spending, to be strict about granting credit, 
and to extend the deadline for repayment of debts. In this 
context, the government intends to continue looking for 
investment resources, to increase centralized capital 
investment, and to attract resources accumulated in the private 
sector. There will also be tight monitoring of the effective, 
well-targeted use of state resources. It is expected that as 
long as an active policy of economic stabilization is 
implemented, the population's real monetary incomes will not 
fall by a significant amount. 
  The government and parliament are organizing working groups, 
which are planning to complete work on the budget by the end of 
May. In the same month, the parliament and government will begin 
working together on the 1995 budget. In other words, one may 
conclude that the conditions have been created for constructive 
cooperation between the two estates without conflict.

  [Text] The Economics Ministry has two major limits in its 
work this year -- and the 8 to 10 percent level of monthly 
inflation by the end of the year, and the 80 percent limit to 
the fall in industrial production, the Economics Minister, 
Aleksandr Shokhin, told the State Duma at Tuesday's hearings on 
budget estimates. His ministry, he said, has already worked out 
a program for selective support for industries and a mechanism 
for mobilizing private investment under government guarantees to 
help support a number of industries, such as aircraft-building. 
  With reference to the budget estimates the deputy premier 
said that the evaluations of the Economics Ministry are in line 
with the indexes stipulated in the budget. According to 
Shokhin, the main task is to create strict boundaries for the 
use of budgetary funds in accordance with the planned goals. 
  With reference to the unification of Russian and Belarusian 
monetary systems Shokhin said that a formula for such 
unification has not been defined yet, and therefore the final 
documents are not likely to be signed in the near future.

  [Text] Moscow April 5 TASS -- "As a result of slowing down 
rates of inflation, the development of small-scale business, 
farming, farmers' personal subsidiary plots, the revival in 
branches of the consumer sector of the economy and the 
implementation of social programs, we count to stabilize the 
living standards of the main part of the Russian population by 
the end of 1994," Yakov Urinson, first deputy minister of 
economics of Russia, stated on Tuesday speaking at parliamentary 
hearings on the draft of Russia's federal budget for 1994. 
  According to Yakov Urinson, the draft budget envisages the 
conducting of a moderately rigid financial policy with a 
balanced approach to the settlement of current and medium-term 
tasks. This approach implies a selective state support for 
highly efficient productions and the implementation of 
investment projects which are quickly repaid, as well as the 
expansion of sources of financing in social spheres. 
  The first deputy minister of economics believes that in 1994 
workers' incomes and their minimum wages will increase. The 
ratio of the growth of the minimum wage and consumer prices is 
expected to be 85-90 per cent. The size of wages with due 
account for the expected subsistence wage will rise 4.9 times by 
the end of 1994. On the whole during the year real cash incomes 
of the population will decrease insignificantly in the course of 
the implementation of an active policy of economic 
stabilization, Yakov Urinson promised.

  [Text] Although conditions for a market economy were 
created in Russia last year, economic restructuring was 
virtually ineffective. This is evident from a report, entitled 
"Comprehensive Analysis of the Situation in Russia and 
Developments Forecast," drawn up by the Center for Social and 
Strategic Studies and presented at a news-conference in Moscow 
on Tuesday. 
  The report says that scientific research and high technology 
development has shrunk by 73 percent over the last two years 
while industry has been increasingly oriented on raw material 
output. The percentage of fuel, energy, metal, and chemicals in 
industrial production costs soared to 50 percent in 1993 from 30 
percent in 1989-1991 whereas the share of machinery and consumer 
goods dwindled from 44 percent to 28 percent. 
  "Industrial decline is underway with an explicitly one-sided 
trend toward raw material production," the report underlines. 
  The government's economic policy last year is described as 
"the continuation of reforms without macroeconomic 
stabilization." The cabinet's strategy to bridge the budget 
deficit through reduced state expenditures proved ineffective. 
  Although efforts to keep the budget deficit within 10 
percent 
succeeded this year, in fact this gap has proved larger than the 
officially announced deficiency since some profits and 
liabilities, like foreign loans and payment of interest on state 
debt, have been inaccurately declared. 
  Experts believe that there can be no talk of any national 
development unless the ruling political elite consolidates 
itself. 
  At the same time, they point to the problem of political 
terror in Russia. In their opinion, last year's series of 
murders of bankers was politically motivated.

<F P=106> [Report based on data from the Russian Federation </F>
Government's Center for Economic Conditions: "No Comparison 
Between Taganrog and Magadan"] 
  [Text] The Russian Federation Government Center for 
Economic Conditions has summed up the results of the month. 
Judging by the operational figures revealed by weekly price 
monitoring, the inflation rate in March was slightly down on 
last month at 8.7 percent (9.9 percent in February, 22 percent 
in January). 
  Foodstuffs increased in price by 6.2 percent over the month, 
while nonfood goods were up 11.3 percent, and paid services to 
the population rose by 14.6 percent. 
  The springtime vitamin deficiency and inflation have done 
their job -- in March the most tangible price rises were for 
vegetables (up 24 percent). Bakery, groats, and pasta products 
were up 13-14 percent. Fish, dairy products, and fruit were up 
10-11 percent. Prices for these products were slightly higher 
than the average growth in the price of foodstuffs -- 6.2 
percent. But salt was out in front even here. It increased in 
price almost by a third in March. Prices for animal and 
vegetable fat rose insignificantly (by 4-5 percent). Prices for 
sugar and eggs were virtually unchanged. Vodka prices fell by 4 
percent on average. 
  The biggest food price rises over the month were in the 
Northwest and East Siberian regions -- by 12 and 10 percent 
respectively. On the other hand, foodstuffs in the Urals and 
Central Chernozem regions increased by just 3 percent. 
  Prices for foodstuffs as a whole have increased by 40.6 
percent since the start of the year. The biggest rises have 
been for dairy products, vegetables, and salt -- up 80 percent. 
Bakery products are up 60 percent. 
  Looking at the basket of 19 of the most important 
foodstuffs, 
its average cost has increased by 7.3 percent over the month and 
by 44 percent since the start of the year to stand at 44,300 
rubles [R] on a monthly basis. The basket cost R42,700 at store 
prices, and R56,900 at market prices. The spread between the 
maximum and minimum cost of the basket in different cities of 
Russia increased from a factor of 3.4 to 3.6 compared with the 
previous month. The most "expensive" area for the basket 
continues to be the Far East region at R79,200. The average 
cost of the basket in the Central Chernozem region (which was 
the "cheapest" in late March) was R33,100. 
  The cost of the basket of 19 of the most important 
foodstuffs 
in Moscow increased by 5.7 percent in March to stand at R48,000. 
The basket increased by 15.4 percent over the month in St. 
Petersburg to stand at R49,200. On the list of cities surveyed 
Moscow ranks 39th most expensive (it was 33d a month ago), while 
St. Petersburg has leapfrogged Moscow to take 34th place (as 
opposed to 47th). 
  During March prices for nonfood goods rose twice as fast as 
food prices. As was the case in February prices rose by 2 
percent on average every week. As was to be expected, fuel 
prices in March were out in front -- up more than 30 percent, 
and 43 percent for coal. There was a significant rise in the 
price of wallpaper -- up 26 percent -- medicines, and synthetic 
detergents (up 24 percent). The smallest increases were for 
tobacco products and footwear (up 4 and 7 percent respectively). 
  Among Russia's economic regions the increases in nonfood 
goods were more noticeable in the Volga and East Siberia 
regions. But prices increased at different rates within the 
regions. Thus, for instance, over the past month prices for 
televisions in the Volga region and Kalmykia (which is part of 
that region) increased by 70 percent, wallpaper was up 30 
percent, and the overall increase for nonfood goods was 23 
percent. Yet in Saratov Oblast (in the same region) price rises 
for these goods did not exceed 7 percent. 
  The industrial goods boom has left the Volga-Vyatka region 
virtually untouched. Nonfood goods there were up 7 percent. 
  There continue to be considerable differences in the price 
of 
the same goods in different Russian cities. Thus, in late March 
prices for tobacco products differed approximately by a factor 
of five, and by a factor of 15 for analgin [type of analgesic]. 
Whereas a packet cost R56 in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, the price was 
R810 in Yakutsk.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Viktor Petrenko] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 5 Apr -- The approach of spring field work 
has not changed the situation in Russia in industries working 
for the the agroindustrial complex; their enterprises are 
continuing to reduce their output. Agriculture Ministry experts 
believe that the drop in effective demand is the main reason 
holding back production of output for the agricultural sector of 
the economy. Prices for industrial products which are purchased 
by the agroindustrial complex are rising more quickly -- 11.4 
times last year -- than the prices for agricultural produce, 
which rose only 8.4 times. 
  Since the beginning of the year many plants have virtually 
been inoperative. According to Russia's State Committee for 
Statistics, in January production of mineral fertilizers was 
halted by the Belorechensk "Minudobreniya" association and the 
Uvarovo chemical works, and the manufacture of flax harvesting 
combines ceased even earlier at "Bezhetskselmash," the only 
manufacturer of this equipment in the country. Things are no 
better in the workforces which are continuing to work. For 
instance, at the start of the year the "Rostselmash" association 
produced only 0.6 percent of the January 1993 level of grain 
harvesting combines. 
  A no less alarming situation has arisen in the production of 
components and subassemblies which are used for making up 
complete units and in repairing equipment. A lack of spare 
parts has resulted in the fact that in the past year the number 
of tractor and combine engines repaired at enterprises of the 
Ministry of Agriculture of the Russian Federation fell by 
one-quarter, of tractors and grain harvesting combines by 
one-third, and of potato harvesting combines by half.

<F P=106> [Yelena Arakelyan report: "Harvest in Russia Ripens Faster </F>
Than the Laws"] 
  [Text] Our agriculture is planning to get out of the 
crisis. Last week the government presidium approved the latest 
program for agrarian reform in Russia -- for 1994-95. 
  The government intends to use different methods to save the 
countryside. First and foremost, to recognize the peasants' 
legal right to private, joint-stock, and cooperative ownership. 
Admittedly, our private owners will only be able to exercise 
their right of land use under state control -- so as to prevent 
any exploitation. 
  The government plans to protect the peasants not only from 
exploiters but also from competitors. The program contains the 
well-known demand for difficulties to be placed in the way of 
foreign food producers entering the Russian market. 
  Naturally, farmers will continue to be helped out 
materially. 
Specific sums are not mentioned in the program (clearly so as 
not to frighten representatives of other sectors at the outset) 
but it is proposed to provide "selective support" for 
stockraising and crop farming, as well as a number of other 
"infusions." Admittedly, a few innovations are planned. As of 
the second half of the year loans will, clearly, be issued to 
the agro-industrial complex not on the basis of their promised 
repayment, but on the basis of security -- land, real estate, 
and so forth. 
  It is as yet hard to say to what extent all these plans and 
intentions will be carried out. Agriculture Minister V. 
Khlystun claims that 39 normative acts will have to be adopted 
for the program to work -- including a new land code and a law 
on agricultural production sharing. And it is well known how 
such documents are adopted in our country. The fate of the 
agrarian program itself is a graphic example -- the current 
version is the sixth. 
  One thing can be said for sure. The latest program, like all 
the preceding documents, does not answer the main question being 
asked by the peasants and all Russians -- how does the state 
intend to protect (and not just restrict) the declared right of 
private land ownership? And will investments made by today's 
"private owners" be lost in a future "dekulakization" 
[expropriation of rich peasants] campaign? 
  The latest agricultural season will be starting in most 
areas 
in a couple of weeks. For the umpteenth time peasants will have 
to sow without knowing exactly what awaits them.

  [Text] Moscow April 5 BUSINESS-TASS -- Russia is going to 
reduce the output of coal by 20 to 35 million tonnes in 1994 to 
275 million tonnes, according to the Economy Ministry's 
forecast. One of the main problems facing the sector, according 
to experts from the Economy Ministry, is the continuing 
deterioration of the production assets in the mines, which 
increases the cost and the risk of mining.

<F P=106> [Pavel Felgengauer report under the "Trade" rubric: </F>
"`Rosvooruzheniye' Is the Best Friend of the Military-Industrial 
Sector. But One Should Not Expect To Earn $20 Billion"] 
  [Text] Last week, the INTERFAX news agency reported: 
"Viktor Samoylov, general director of the state-owned 
"Rosvooruzheniye" company, believes that Russia could 
potentially sell $20 billion worth of arms and military hardware 
in 1994." General Samoylov has said in an interview for 
SEGODNYA, however, that "he was quoted not quite accurately." 
In 1993, arms exports amounted to around $2 billion, so a 
drastic ten-fold increase in exports is impossible in 
principle." "The signing of a military-technical export 
contract usually requires a few years of preparatory work, 
whereas our company has just been set up." 
  In 1994, the "Rosvooruzheniye" state company expects to 
achieve better results than it had in 1993, but not to increase 
exports "ten-fold." Gen. Samoylov also stressed that "Russia is 
by no means going to violate UN sanctions against Iraq, Libya, 
and Yugoslavia. Any such statements, whoever might make them, 
will only undermine faith in Russia as a trade partner." 
  A drastic reduction in state military orders has been 
prompting defense industry managers to demand that they be given 
a free hand in foreign trade. Many arms manufacturers have been 
conducting talks with various foreign middlemen for a number of 
years already, but not a single large contract has reached the 
signing stage. 
  Gen. Samoylov said that "`Rosvooruzheniye' has perfect 
relations with all the main arms manufacturers. As for the 
claims that the state company is a monster that may stifle the 
military-industrial sector, they come from those whom the 
presidential edict on setting up the `Rosvooruzheniye' state 
company has prevented from carrying out their effectively 
semi-criminal activity -- attempts to export state-of-the-art 
weapons in small consignments or in single pieces."

Admiral Eduard Baltin has been taken to hospital due to Sunday's 
wound in his right leg's tissue. The wound was caused by "a 
malfunction of his gun," head of the Black Sea Fleet press 
center Captain 1st Class Andrey Grachev told ITAR-TASS today 
over the telephone. 
  In the words of Grachev, "the wound is not dangerous, the 
commander feels well and will return to his duties in the near 
future". While Baltin is at hospital to undergo wound treatment 
and annual medical examination, his first deputy Vice-Admiral 
Vitaliy Larionov is temporary in charge of the Black Sea Fleet.

`The Fall Is To Be Considered the Spring!'"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Minister Not Waiting 
for "Demobilization" Order. He Is in No Hurry 
  The main event of the past week did not happen -- Pavel 
Grachev did not sign the latest order for the discharge to the 
reserve and the new military draft. It was noted at the Defense 
Ministry Collegium session that it was only thanks to the fact 
that the "fall '93" draft had been extended through spring 1994 
that it had finally been possible to achieve an 80-percent level 
of manpower acquisition for the Army. It is not being ruled out 
that in the future the trivial division of the year into spring, 
summer, fall, and winter may be marked by an order from the 
military department. That is nothing surprising if we are 
allowing ourselves to arbitrarily wind the hands of the clock on 
the Spasskaya Tower backward and forward. 
  The explanation of the draft situation given to us at the 
Defense Ministry was that an edict had not yet been issued by 
the commander in chief. But the secretariat of the commander in 
chief -- who recently returned from Sochi -- replied that all 
the documents are being prepared as before by the military 
department.

  [Text] Last month Russian border guards detained 250 
persons for illegally crossing the border. The total figure 
since the beginning of the year exceeds 900. This was disclosed 
in a Tuesday interview with INTERFAX by the chief of the 
information department of the Russian Border Force Major-General 
Aleksandr Manilov. He said that last month together with 
customs officials border guards seized over 120 kilos of drugs 
and 100 firearms in seven instances. 
  Manilov said the situation remains worst on the Tajik-Afghan 
border where 18 attempts by militants to break through were 
foiled last March. Frontier posts and pickets came under fire 
11 times, in three cases from the territory of Afghanistan. 
  The general expects a rise in the activeness of militants on 
the border, primarily on the Pyandzh, Moskovsky and Horog 
sections, and a simultaneous rise in terrorism on the Tajik side 
of the frontier. 
  If the talks between the Tajik Government and opposition 
fail, Manilov said, the so-called government in exile will 
evidently launch coordinated actions in the areas of Kalai-Hum, 
Horog and Ishkashim. 
  Manilov described the situation on other sections of the 
border as "relatively stable".

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Roman Zadunaiskiy] </F>
  [Text] Moscow 5 April, TASS -- The arrival of Ukrainian 
supreme military officials and special units in Sevastopol, the 
main base of the Black Sea Fleet, without any coordination with 
the Crimean leadership and notification of the Fleet Command 
aggravated the Crimean situation today. 
  Some 30 servicemen of special units of the Ukrainian 
National 
Guard and the Ukrainian Interior Ministry arrived in the base 
this morning on board the plane of the deputy head of the 
Ukrainian armed forces general staff, military sources in 
Sevastopol told ITAR-TASS. The servicemen settled at the 
Slavutich ship of the Ukrainian Navy Department. 
  Another 500 special unit servicemen settled at the Nakhimov 
navy school in Sevastopol. The Black Sea Fleet Command is ready 
to put the fleet on the alert in case of a conflict. 
  There is no reports about movement of Ukrainian troops 
stationed in the peninsula. According to the Russian military, 
the Ukrainian troops stationed in the Crimea increased from 
18,000 to 51,000 men within the past two years. 
  Well-informed sources told ITAR-TASS Crimean President Yuriy 
Meshkov failed to return to the Crimea at 1800 today as it was 
planned since Turkey closed its skies to the presidential plane 
without any announced reasons. Meshkov is expected to return to 
Simferopol at 0100 on 6 April. 
  In the opinion of observers, the developments are not 
accidental. A decree of Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk was 
made public in the absence of Meshkov to announce the 
introduction of a post of Kravchuk representative in the Crimea, 
which was followed by the arrival of the Ukrainian military 
officials and special units. 
  Observers think President Kravchuk may explore the ground 
for 
the introduction of a special rule in the Crimea and 
subordination of Yuriy Meshkov to his representative.

  [Text] Simferopol, 5 Apr -- Ukraine President Leonid 
Kravchuk has assured Crimean Government Vice Prime Minister 
Yevgeniy Saburov that in the future, visits by representives of 
the leading departments of the Ukraine and the Crimea will be 
made with his knowledge and be agreed upon with the leadership 
of the Crimean Republic. The ITAR-TASS correspondent was told 
this by Valeriy Grishankov, head of the Crimean president's 
staff. 
  It was reported earlier that a large group of top officials 
of the leading ministries of the Ukraine -- the ministries of 
defense, national guard, and internal affairs -- led by Anatoliy 
Lopata, chief of staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, had 
suddenly arrived this afternoon in the Crimea from Kiev. 
  The head of the Crimean president's staff also said the 
reason for such a mass and unexpected visit by the top military 
brass to the Crimea was explained by officials of the Ukrainian 
president's staff as being a coincidence, since it turned out 
that each of the generals had his own plans for the peninsula.

    [Editorial report] Kiev Ukrayinske Radio First Program 
Network in Ukrainian at 1200 GMT on 5 April carries in its 
"Nezalezhnist" [Independence] program a 40-minute live interview 
with Ukrainian Supreme Council Chairman Ivan Plyushch, conducted 
by Serhiy Omelchuk. 
  Omelchuk first asks about relations between Ukrainian 
President Leonid Kravchuk and Plyushch, which lately seem to 
have become "somewhat strained." He says: "Mr. Kravchuk 
recently said: Ivan Stepanovych and I do not disagree in 
principle. Do you share this opinion of the president?" 
  Plyushch replies: "First of all, I would sincerely like to 
say that I completely share this opinion and believe that not 
only do we not disagree in principle, but Leonid Makarovych and 
I have virtually never had any strategic differences about who 
we are and where we are going. Leonid Makarovych and I have had 
tactical differences." 
  Answering a question on forecasts of the run-off 
parliamentary election outcome, Plyushch says: "I would like to 
say, you know that this is no longer a forecast but almost 
reality. It was a forecast when I met European and world 
representatives who came to observe our elections. I then said 
I was convinced that elections would take place in the majority 
of constituencies. I am happy -- I did not expect it and I am 
also pleasantly surprised -- that elections took place in all 
450 constituencies." He goes on: "It is now my deep conviction 
-- which was also demonstrated by the experience of the 34 
constituencies where the elections were held on 2-3 April, when 
29 out of 34 constituencies did elect their people's deputies -- 
this is why I have every ground to believe that a viable Supreme 
Council of Ukraine will have been elected (?some time) by 10 
April." 
  Having praised the political wisdom of the people of 
Ukraine, 
Plyushch reiterates that the election will produce a capable 
team coming to the newly-elected legislature. 
  Asked how soon he thinks that the new parliament will be 
convened, Plyushch replies that, after the final run-offs on 10 
April, he expects the results to be known on 12-13 April. He 
continues: "According to the law, the Central Electoral 
Commission has 10 days to verify the validity and legitimacy of 
elections. Thus, ideally, we will have the final results by 20 
April. Then someone, probably the Supreme Council Presidium, 
which will meet on 12 April, has to make a decision on the 
convocation of a new session, the first session of the 
newly-elected Supreme Council. The law says it should take place 
within two months of the election. Imagine, two months from 10 
April is 10 June. I think it would be proper to act in 
accordance with the situation in society. This situation, I 
believe, requires the soonest possible convocation of the first 
session of the new parliament, and I think a decision will be 
made to convene it within a fortnight." 
  Considering the number of public holidays in early May, May 
Day, Orthodox Easter,and Victory Day, he suggests that the new 
parliament session should start around 12-15 May. 
  Omelchuk then asks what the parliament speaker believes the 
future status of the Ukrainian Republic will be -- presidential, 
parliamentary, or a mixed one -- and where he feels the 
parliament's preference lies. 
  Plyushch replies: "As a citizen and a deputy of the new 
parliament, but not more than that, I believe our Republic so 
far has been neither presidential, parliamentary, nor a mixed 
one. It has been too jumbled up. I don't want you to think I 
am blaming the Supreme Council, the president, the presidium or 
anyone else. This is the way that society has been. I think we 
did the right thing to introduce the presidency, and the fact 
that Leonid Makarovych Kravchuk was elected the first popular 
president was the best option, but then the president had to 
take over executive power and establish order. The law on local 
self-government that was adopted made it difficult because it 
did not allow him to directly control the regions. That's why 
the president wanted to set up vertical structures to implement 
legislation, and we passed the law on presidential 
representatives. Some would say it was redundant, but I don't 
think so." 
  Discussing further the problems of the power structure, 
Plyushch points out that, although necessary at the time, 
presidential representatives ran into conflict with the law on 
regional self-government and interfered with the powers of local 
councils. "We need a clear-cut system of executive and 
representative power in the regions, from the village to the 
oblast, before we deal with the Republic." To that effect, he 
says, the Supreme Council has passed three laws, on the 
formation of local bodies of power and self- government, on the 
status of local council deputies, and on local council 
elections. "What is taking place is a political reform through 
which the people, from the village to Kiev, will receive full 
power. The Republic's legislature plus local executive bodies 
will provide the people with full power. As for the president, 
he is already popularly elected." 
  Omelchuk then asks: "Some politicians believe that it is 
expedient to hold the election of the president of Ukraine after 
the new constitution of Ukraine is adopted. What is your 
opinion?" 
  Plyushch replies: "Well, first, there is nothing new about 
this view, you know. There is a variety of opinions, you know. 
Some believe that the fundamental law -- the Constitution -- 
should be adopted first and then other laws should be adopted. 
This is the (?lawyers') opinion. There is another one 
affirming that it cannot be done. 
  "I say that it is good that there are opinions. We, 
however, have worked on all these opinions jointly with the 
president. You known that we have been working as cochairmen of 
the constitutional commission for two years. For the last two 
years now, we have been working as cochairmen and have been 
trying to do everything to bring about the Constitution as soon 
as possible. We submitted it for consideration in its first 
reading, however, and received 70,000 comments and proposals. 
How could we not discuss them? By the time we had systemized 
them, the Constitution looked entirely different. We published 
it for consideration in its second reading. Already we have 
received over 10,000 comments and proposals on the latest 
version that was published. 
  "That is why one cannot be in a hurry with the constitution 
and I believe that this Supreme Council's deputies did the right 
thing in that they initiated and worked up the draft and passed 
it to the next (?Supreme Council). That is, our constitution 
will already have been worked on by the Supreme Councils of two 
convocations. Otherwise, had it been adopted by that Supreme 
Council, people would have said it was adopted by the 
procommunist Supreme Council. Now, this will be a Supreme 
Council elected in the independent, democratic Ukraine and this 
Supreme Council will see whether it is expedient to present 
separate provisions in the constitution to a referendum. This 
will be decided by the Supreme Council. 
  "In other words, I am not a supporter of those linking the 
presidential election with the new Constitution." 
  The focus of the interview then switches to the economy. On 
the devaluation of the population's savings, Plyushch states: 
"Once we are delimiting functions, one should clearly realize 
that this devaluation was caused by the situation, rather than 
by the Supreme Council. I could not even say this was done by 
the government. Regardless of who did this, however, this is 
sheer robbery of the population of Ukraine by the power 
structures and by the existing situation." He continues: "The 
government must exclude from privatization and estimate that 
part of state property and means of production which are subject 
to privatization, so as to sell them and pay some money into 
people's savings accounts and index-link their deposits so that 
they will correspond with the purchasing power of the value of 
the money that was in their savings accounts on 1 January 1992 
when we became a state." 
  Asked to say when the people's living standards are likely 
to 
improve tangibly, Plyushch responds: "I believe that the people 
will see an improvement in their economic well-being as the 
national economy rises, while the national economy is impossible 
to run without introducing national currency and regulating the 
financial and credit system." 
  He adds: "I believe the new Supreme Council will need a 
maximum of one month to form a new government and it will take 
the new government until the second half of this year to look 
round and present its stabilization program and a program which 
would provide for the introduction of our own currency. It is 
then that stabilization will be perceptible." 
  Omelchuk's next questions concern the situation in Ukraine's 
southern and eastern regions, following plebiscites in Crimea, 
Donetsk, and Lugansk on their status in Ukraine. Asked to 
comment on the legislative confrontation between Kiev and 
Crimea, Plyushch says: "Nobody can blame the Russian-speaking 
population in Crimea who came to live there and who now say that 
economic integration with Russia is the only way, and nobody can 
blame the 30 percent of Ukrainian speakers in Northern Crimea. 
President Boris Yeltsin and a Supreme Council delegation signed 
an interstate agreement on 16 November 1992, and a trilateral 
statement has been signed by presidents Kravchuk, Yeltsin, and 
Clinton recognizing the states' existing borders without any 
territorial claims. At the interstate level, Crimea is not an 
issue. It is an issue in Crimea itself, and among certain 
political forces in Russia. I believe that this issue will be 
resolved in Ukraine's favor only when Ukraine's national economy 
will be more helpful to Crimea's economy." Efforts have already 
been made to assist Crimea with the spring sowing campaign. 
  Plyushch continues: "The Crimean population can see it for 
themselves: If they do join Russia tomorrow, then what? Russia 
has its own problems. Even the famous ZIL, the Likhachev 
automobile plants, closed down yesterday. Will it come and open 
a plant in Crimea? Only Meshkov can think so, because he is 
promised financial aid from certain chauvinist forces if he 
rules the right way. We'll see in a year what kind of aid he 
gets. I would be only pleased if some kind of aid comes to 
Crimea from Russia, at least in the way of oil. 
  "How can we make Crimea comply with the law? Well, if 
someone does not comply with the law, than legal measures have 
to be taken. If the president of Ukraine has issued a decree and 
this decree is not obeyed, then the president's next step should 
contain measures against the one who did not obey." 
  Commenting on the issue of dual citizenship and two state 
languages, debated in east Ukraine, Plyushch says that a state 
cannot have two emblems, two citizenships and two languages. 
"This would only contribute to confrontation between our 
regions. If we continue with these referendums, then we will 
end up with one emblem in west Ukraine, another emblem in 
Lugansk, and what will the state emblem be in Kiev? Something 
else? 
  "People need a good life. If we had a good life, I am deeply 
convinced, there would be no questions about the language, the 
emblems, and the citizenship. We have failed to provide this 
kind of life, and people feel uncertain." 
  Asked about the prospect of Ukraine joining the ruble zone 
in the CIS, Plyushch replies: "There will be no ruble zone ever 
again. Forget it. There are not enough rubles to go around in 
Russia. They promised to cook up a ruble zone for Belarus, six 
months have passed, and nothing has happening. If Belarus is 
part of the Russian banking system, Belarus will be a branch of 
the Russian Central Bank, but I don't think Belarus will agree 
to this. Maybe only certain forces in Belarus, but not the 
country on the whole, because that would be the end of a nation. 
  "But if you mean the single economic space, we never left 
it. 
Ukraine, thank God, already has a surplus of butter, meat, and 
other products. Why not sell them to Russia or Uzbekistan? 
They have to be paid for, but neither Ukraine nor Russia has 
the means to pay. And that's a different matter altogether." 
  In conclusion, Ivan Plyushch thanks Ukrainians for voting in 
the first round of elections and urges them to come to the polls 
to elect the rest of the parliament on 10 April for the sake of 
reform and stabilization.

  [Text] Kiev 5 April, TASS -- The press service of the 
Ukrainian Defence Ministry denied reports that Minister Vitalyy 
Radetskyy was to arrive in the Crimea today. 
  "Radetskyy is in Kiev now and planned no trips for today 
including to the Crimea," the press service told ITAR-TASS. 
  However the source has confirmed that a group of the 
Ukrainian top military consisiting of Intelligence Chief 
Vegunnikov, Airforce Commander Antonets, Chief of Staff of the 
National Guard Mokhov and Counterintelligence Chief Kravchenko 
has arrived in the Crimea today "separately and by different 
means of transport." 
  According to reliable sources in the Crimea, the aim of 
their 
visit to the Crimea was not immediately known either to the 
Crimean administration or the command of the Black Sea Fleet. 
  The arrival of high-ranking officers without preliminary 
notification, has evoked protest on the part of the Crimean 
leadership.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Special Services Have Not Lost </F>
Interest in the Dnieper Region"] 
  [Text] In a conversation with a UKRINFORM correspondent, 
the chief of Ukraine's Security Service Administration in 
Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, Lieutenant General Volodymyr Slobodenyuk, 
pointed to a considerable increase in interest that foreign 
special services are showing in the Dnieper region. Last year, 
officers of the administration kept under their control the 
unofficial presence in the region, under various covers, of more 
than 20 trained foreign intelligence agents. The 
counterintelligence department thwarted attempts to create two 
intelligence cells in the region, including one representing the 
interests of one of the Near Eastern countries. Hostile actions 
on the part of a number of European countries, the United 
States, and China were also uncovered, recorded, and discarded. 
  The interest on the part of foreign firms and informers on 
their payroll in the Dnieper region, where Ukraine's powerful 
scientific and industrial and defense potential is concentrated, 
is not accidental. Many unique technologies, designs, and 
samples of technology and materials that have not yet been used 
anywhere else in the world are being created there.

  [Text] Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin held 
a news conference for Russian and foreign journalists at the 
foreign ministry's press center. The conference was devoted to 
the Partnership for Peace program and Russia's participation in 
it. This is part of what the deputy minister said: 
  [Begin Churkin recording] For us, the issue is whether the 
Partnership for Peace program fits our own ideas and our own 
concept of pan-European partnership. I'd like to recap on the 
two possibly fundamental elements of our idea of pan-European 
partnership. 
  First, development of Euro-Atlantic interaction through the 
transformation of the CSCE into an effective pan-regional 
political organization, and the North Atlantic Cooperation 
Council into a structure for military-political cooperation that 
is independent but closely linked to the CSCE. The aim is to 
coordinate the efforts of NATO, the European Union, Council of 
Europe, West European Union and CIS towards strengthening 
stability and security, peacekeeping and protection of national 
minorities' rights in Europe. Second, growth of cooperation 
under North Atlantic Cooperation Council auspices, enlisting the 
neutral states of Europe, including to put into effect the 
Partnership for Peace program, on the basis of equal rights and 
conversion of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council into an 
independent body with a small secretariat. 
  The North Atlantic Cooperation Council could become a pan- 
European laboratory for peacekeeping, greater military openness, 
and conversion of military industries. 
  I wish to point out that our concept is broader. In our 
view, and this is explained by our positive opinion of the idea 
behind Partnership for Peace, it fits fairly well into our own 
Russian concept of how pan-European partnership should develop 
and in which directions the process to strengthen European 
security should move. 
  What isn't the Partnership for Peace program? It is not a 
new international treaty imposing new obligations on its 
members. When Russia joins the program, it will not be 
accepting any new legal obligations in respect of NATO, just as 
NATO will not be taking on any new obligations in respect of 
Russia. Therefore, the question sometimes asked of whether this 
will drag us into something we don't want can be very simply 
answered: since there are no obligations we cannot be pulled 
into anything against our will.

<F P=106> [Dmitriy Gornostayev report in the "Details" column: "Two </F>
Sides of Partnership for Peace. Kozyrev and Kostikov Have Meant 
Different Things"] 
  [Text] By the end of last week Russia's top officials gave 
the press cause to talk about confusion within the state 
structures on a foreign policy issue currently being given much 
prominence: Russia's joining the Partnership for Peace program. 
Or rather, about the time frames mentioned last Friday [1 Apr]. 
  As is known, during U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry's 
visit to Moscow in mid-March his Russian colleague Pavel Grachev 
stated that the Russian Federation will sign the Partnership at 
the end of March. On Thursday, 31 March, Russian Federation 
presidential press spokesman Vyacheslav Kostikov announced that 
the process of acceding to the Partnership could take between 
six to seven months, thereby shifting, as it seemed, the date 
for joining the program at least until September-October. 
Citing Boris Yeltsin's opinion, Kostikov attributed this to the 
fact that the "Partnership for Peace formula does not quite 
correspond to the scope of Russia's political and military 
power." Next day, Friday, Russian Federation Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev told journalists that Russia will accede to the 
Partnership as early as April. 
  It turned out, however, that the presidential press 
secretary 
and the head of the Foreign Affairs Ministry were speaking about 
different things. Subsequently Kozyrev's supposition that 
Kostikov was misunderstood was also confirmed. 
  Commenting Saturday, at the request of NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA's 
correspondent, on the current situation, Russian Security 
Council Deputy Secretary Valeriy Manilov said that "everyone who 
has commented on the Partnership for Peace has meant different 
things: First, the intention to join the framework agreement," 
which is only a statement of intent and does not impose any 
obligations on the signatory. This was also what Andrey Kozyrev 
meant. Second, there is also "another aspect: a representative 
[prezentativnoye], individual agreement with NATO defining 
specific terms on which the state intends to cooperate with this 
bloc within the Partnership for Peace framework." 
  Owing to its strategic importance, the resolution of this 
question, as it appears, is not the domain of separate 
departments. In the very near future, the Partnership -- its 
substantive, not declarative, part -- will be considered by the 
Russian Security Council, which will task the corresponding 
structures to develop and substantiate Russia's position on 
Partnership for Peace which would not be detrimental to its 
national interests. After this the Russian Federation president 
will make a decision in the shape of an edict or his approval of 
the Security Council protocol. Then, according to Valeriy 
Manilov, "I suppose that this decision will be presented to 
parliament for ratification." 
  Yesterday Pavel Grachev stated that his department's and the 
Foreign Ministry's views on Partnership for Peace coincide. In 
addition, he said that he does not see any disagreements on this 
issue between the government and presidential structures, 
referring to his talks with Yeltsin.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anna Melnikova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 5 Apr -- "A decision has to be made on 
Russia's participation in the NATO `Partnership for Peace' 
program, not only at the level of executive power; agreement is 
also necessary with the legislative power." This was stated 
today in an exclusive interview with the ITAR-TASS correspondent 
by State Duma deputy, Minister for Affairs of Nationalities and 
Regional Policy Sergey Shakhray. 
  According to him, "this is such a conceptual step in the 
development of the country that it is necessary to debate it at 
all levels, including the parliament." The Russian leadership 
must "exercise the maximum of coordination in its approach to 
decisionmaking, because the State Duma will have to ratify this 
agreement later." 
  Sergey Shakhray would view Russia's participation in the 
Partnership for Peace program as an "obvious advantage" and he 
even compared it to "overcoming the iron curtain." 
  As a disadvantage, he mentioned the fact that "after the 
disintegration of the Warsaw Pact Russia should have thought 
about setting up a new security system." "One must remember that 
Russia is a Eurasian state, and it is still unclear how its 
participation in the NATO initiative will reflect on its 
relations with other CIS countries and its Eastern neighbors, 
for example China", he said. "We are also worried that our 
country might lose markets for weapons." 
  Sergey Shakhray agreed that if Russia were to join the 
Partnership for Peace program, it could have a special status. 
The minister believes that "it is necessary to debate this 
matter at the Security Council, then at the Federation Council, 
and to make a final decision once all positions have been 
coordinated." 
  Speaking about a possible timetable for Russia's joining the 
Partnership for Peace program, Sergey Shakhray said that "this 
process will probably take one or two months."

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Sychev article: "Russia Will Sign Up to NATO </F>
Program Anyhow, But It Needs Further Work"] 
  [Text] There has been no split in the Russian leadership 
over the "Partnership for Peace" program proposed by NATO, 
Defense Minister Army General Pavel Grachev stated. 
  Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, as previously assumed, 
plans 
to visit Brussels in mid-April and perform the formal act of 
Russian accession to the partnership program, which has already 
been signed by 14 countries of Eastern Europe and the former 
USSR. 
  The subject of the existence of sharp differences in the 
Russian leadership arose in connection with contradictory 
statements by presidential press secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov 
and Defense Minister Pavel Grachev. Kostikov told journalists 
that it could take Russia six or seven months to adopt a final 
decision on the partnership program. Whereas the defense 
minister, answering a question from journalists following his 
meeting with UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali, who is in 
Moscow, stated that the government's position has not changed. 
The Ministries of Defense and Foreign Affairs have prepared a 
joint document which has been supported by the president. 
  Answering an IZVESTIYA question about the explanation for 
such divergent viewpoints expressed within the space of only a 
few days, the president's press service answered that at the 
famous briefing Kostikov had been "spelling out the president's 
position at that moment." 
  It was suggested in the Defense and Foreign Ministries that 
when he mentioned six or seven months Kostikov had in mind the 
fact that it could take that long for talks to be held with NATO 
on clarifying and amplifying the program's provisions. At the 
Foreign Ministry it is not ruled out that this work could take 
even longer. The "Partnership for Peace" program is seen in 
Moscow as a framework document to which substance must be added. 
As for Russia's joining the program, this question has been 
decided, as President Yeltsin has repeatedly stated.

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: By diplomatic </F>
correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboinikov, Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy 
Trubetskoy and others] 
  [Text] Russia believes that North Korea should honor all 
its commitments under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, said 
the Director of the Russian Foreign Ministry's press and 
information department, Grigoriy Karasin, at Tuesday's briefing 
in Moscow. 
  According to him, Moscow welcomes the statement by the 
chairman of the U.N. Security Council, which urges Pyongyang to 
allow the International Atomic Energy Agency to conclude its 
inspections in North Korea in accordance with the agreement 
reached between them on February 15th. 
  "Russia views the statement, which was adopted by consensus, 
as a timely action reflecting the world community's concern 
about the situation connected with the North Korean nuclear 
problem. We hope that Pyongyang will pay due attention to the 
recommendations given in the statement," he said. 
<H5>  ...AND DISMISSES THE ALLEGATIONS THAT LARGE CONSIGNMENT OF </H5>
RUSSIAN TANKS WAS DELIVERED TO CHINA 
  As Karasin said, "the allegations that a large consignment 
of 
T-80 tanks was delivered to China from Russia are absolutely 
groundless." 
  According to the diplomat, "the development of military- 
technical ties between Russia and China is a normal component of 
their relationship." Such ties "are effectuated through state 
structures and under appropriate control." 
  "In the area of military equipment deliveries to China, 
Russia observes the generally-accepted principles of 
transparence, including the despatch of the necessary data to 
the U.N. Conventional Weapons Register," said the spokesman for 
Russia's Foreign Ministry.

termination of combat operations in Nagorno-Karabakh are 
absolute priorities of the Russian concept of Karabakh 
settlement, head of the Russian Foreign Ministry's Information

have no solution without these conditions, he added. 
  Bearing in mind some unclear mass media reports, Karasin 
specified the Russian concept of Karabakh settlement and said 
the second stage of the settlement shall include troops pullback 
from the territories occupied in combat operations, resumption 
of the functioning of communications and the return of refugee 
to places of their permanent residence. 
  Political negotiations on the legal status of 
Nagorno-Karabakh will be expedient only at the third stage and 
under more favourable conditions, stressed Karasin. He said 
this idea is supported by all the conflicting sides, who "think 
that the Karabakh future status should be established on a 
compromise basis through negotiations".

  [Text] Moscow April 6 TASS -- Specialists of the Russian 
natural gas supplier Gasprom are cautiously optimistic about the 
forthcoming negotiations with Ukraine on April 11 and 12 on the 
repayment of Ukraine's debt for the delivery of Russian natural 
gas. Their caution is due to the slow fulfillment of the terms 
stated in the protocol Gasprom signed with its Ukrainian 
counterparts on March 10. 
  In March, the Ukrainian negotiators pledged to solve the 
main 
problems relating to the debt within one month. The Ukrgasprom 
representatives who visited Moscow in early April confirmed 
their determination to comply with the terms of the document 
signed in March. 
  Nonetheless, out of the promised amount of 100 million 
dollars, Ukraine has remitted to the Gasprom account 96.5 
million dollars, and has not identified terms for the Russian 
participation in joint ownership of the underground storage 
facilities on Ukrainian territory. These include two 
underground reservoirs near the western border. Russia has 
already handed over to the Ukrainian colleagues a draft 
agreement between the two countries on this matter. 
  Since the debt owed to the Russian supplier by Ukrainian 
consumers has reached 1.5 trillion roubles and its is doubtful 
that they will be able to mobilize sufficient resources soon, 
Gasprom experts believe that the problems should better be 
resolved at the inter-state level.

<F P=106> [Mekhman Gafarly report under the "Turkmenistan" rubric: </F>
"Russian Border Guard Arrested on Charges of Misuse of Office"] 
  [Text] According to INTERFAX, last weekend the Turkmen law- 
enforcement agencies arrested Andrey Titov, commander of the 
13th border post of the 3d border unit of the Russian Border 
Troops operations group in Turkmenia [Turkmenistan]. The 
Turkmen Military Prosecutor's Office has brought a criminal 
lawsuit against the officer under Article 240 of the Turkmen 
Criminal Code (misuse of office). The circumstances of the case 
are still uncertain, the sole report saying that the officer's 
arrest was preceded by the suicide committed by Private 
Geldyyev, a Turkmen citizen, upon being exposed as a thief by 
fellow soldiers. 
  Andrey Titov is currently being held in an investigatory 
cell 
in Ashkhabad [Ashgabat]. The Russian side thinks the arrest and 
legal action against Titov by the Turkmen law-enforcement 
agencies to be unlawful and plans to insist that the criminal 
case and the defendant himself be turned over to it. 
  In accordance with the Russian-Turkmen treaty on the joint 
protection of Turkmenia's state border and also on the status of 
the Russian Federation border troop servicemen on the territory 
of the republic, all military crimes committed by Russian border 
guards fall under Russian jurisdiction and must be considered by 
Russian law-enforcement agencies. 
  It should be recalled that in 1993 the Turkmen authorities 
attempted to start legal proceedings against 15 Russian 
servicemen. The Russian side, however, managed to make sure that 
their cases were turned over to it to be tried in Russia.

  [Text] Moscow, April 6 (AFP) -- Four hardline deputies who 
recently visited the Serb enclave of Krajina, in Croatia, and 
Serbia called Wednesday [6 April] for a military alliance with 
the Serbs and said Moscow should set up a naval base off the 
Adriatic coast. 
  "We must recognise on a diplomatic level the republic of 
Serb 
Krajina and establish a military and political union with that 
state," said Deputy Speaker Vladimir Vengerovskiy, a member of 
the ultranationalist Liberal Democratic Party. 
  "Russia's traditional interests in the region lie with the 
Serbs and we must join them in a political and military union," 
Communist Deputy Vitaly Sevastionov told a news conference. 
  The call for a closer alliance with the Serbs came as 
Russian 
diplomats were attempting to broker a peace agreement between 
Croatian officials and Serbs in Krajina. 
  The delegation said that Serb leaders in Krajina and 
Belgrade 
were prepared to offer land on the Adriatic coast to Russia for 
a naval base and said that up to 200,000 Russians would be 
welcome to live there. 
  "They could be refugees from ethnic conflicts in the former 
Soviet Union or military leaders who lost their posts because of 
the pull-outs", Sevastionov said. 
  The deputies said the Serb leaders would make an official 
proposal on establishing a naval base in the near future. 
  They also said that the State Duma would discuss in the near 
future lifting UN sanctions against the former Yugoslavia, 
stating that the measure amounted to the "genocide of the 
Serbian people" in the Balkans. 
  The news conference was held hours before a rival 
parliamentary delegation led by reformist Deputy Viktor Sheinis 
was to meet journalists to discuss its separate visit to the 
former Yugoslavia.

  [Text] Moscow, April 6 (AFP) -- The reformist Yabloko 
faction of the Russian parliament supports gradually lifting UN 
sanctions against the former Yugoslavia, a senior member of the 
bloc said Wednesday at a news conference. 
  Deputy Viktor Sheinis, who returned from a visit to the 
former Yugoslavia, said his faction considered UN sanctions as 
"unfair and one-sided". 
  "The Serbs are not the only side responsible for the tragic 
situation in the former Yugoslavia," Sheinis said, adding that 
sanctions on imports of energy and raw materials should be the 
first to be lifted. 
  Sheinis however stressed that "it was in Russia's strategic 
and national interests to avoid transforming the Yugoslav crisis 
into a pretext for a break in relations between Russia and the 
West." 
  He said that any decision concerning lifting sanctions 
should 
be taken in conjunction with the United Nations Security Council. 
  Sheinis was joined on his visit to the former Yugoslavia by 
reformist deputy Mark Feygin, a member of Russia's Choice, who 
said that his faction had yet to decide on the issue of lifting 
sanctions. 
  Earlier, four hardline deputies denounced UN sanctions as 
"genocide of the Serbian people" in the Balkans and said in a 
separate news conference that they would vote in favor of 
lifting the sanctions during an upcoming debate at the State 
Duma (lower house of parliament). 
  The hardliners who recently visited the Serb enclave of 
Krajina, in Croatia, and Serbia called for a military alliance 
with the Serbs and said Moscow should set up a naval base off 
the Adriatic coast. 
  "We must recognise on a diplomatic level the republic of 
Serb 
Krajina and establish a military and political union with that 
state," said Deputy Speaker Vladimir Vengerovskiy, a member of 
the ultranationalist Liberal Democratic Party. 
  "Russia's traditional interests in the region lie with the 
Serbs and we must join them in a political and military union," 
said communist deputy Vitaly Sevastionov at a news conference. 
  The call for a closer alliance with the Serbs came as 
Russian 
diplomats were attempting to broker a peace agreement between 
Croatian officials and Serbs in Krajina. 
  The delegation said that Serb leaders in Krajina and 
Belgrade 
were prepared to offer land on the Adriatic coast to Russia for 
a naval base and said that up to 200,000 Russians would be 
welcome to live there. 
  "They could be refugees from ethnic conflicts in the former 
Soviet Union or military leaders who lost their posts because of 
the pull-outs", Sevastionov said. 
  The deputies said the Serb leaders would make an official 
proposal on establishing a naval base in the near future.

    [Editorial Report] Moscow Radio Rossii Network in Russian 
at 1000 GMT on 6 April carries a report by correspondent 
Svetlana Pankratova on a Russian-Finnish seminar on Russia 
joining the Council of Europe. The seminar was held in Helsinki 
and attended by members of parliament from both countries. 
  Pankratova reports that Oleg Lukin, head of the 
international 
affairs committee of the Russian parliament, said the meeting in 
Helsinki "would accelerate the resolution of the issue of Russia 
joining the Council of Europe." Finnish members of parliament 
would also like Russia to join the Council, for otherwise the 
process of European integration would not be complete. 
  Pankratova says that Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of 
Russia's Liberal Democratic Party, LDPR, took part in the 
seminar, but refused to meet journalists at a general meeting 
and preferred to convene his own news conference in a Helsinki 
hotel. 
  Pankratova continues: "At his news conference, Vladimir 
Volfovich lectured the Finns on how they should conduct their 
affairs with Russia. Do not touch the Baltic states, for they 
are a part of Russia, warned Zhirinovskiy. Otherwise you will 
have a third world war. The LDPR leader thinks that this third 
world war is already being waged in Tajikistan, Armenia, and 
Azerbaijan. It is obvious that the LDPR leader's extremist 
utterances not only do not facilitate any further strengthening 
of trust between Russia and Finland, but on the contrary, do 
much to devalue the results of the constructive dialogue which 
took place between members of parliament from both countries." 
  Pankratova continues: "The report that following the news 
conference, the LDPR leader visited one of Helsinki's best known 
fleshpots, not among the best, either -- the erotic night-club 
King-Sex Cockatoo -- had a truly shocking effect on the Finnish 
public."

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Roman Zadunaiskiy] </F>
  [Text] Moscow April 5 TASS -- The deadlines and schedule 
for the withdrawal of Russian troops from Estonia are in the 
focus of the regular 18th round of Russo-Estonian talks, which 
today began at a Foreign Ministry rest-house in Chkalovskaya, 
near Moscow, ITAR- TASS was told by a counsellor of the Estonian 
Embassy here. The talks will last two days. 
  In expert opinion, this regular round of talks will not be 
easy, because the sides have still not ironed out their 
differences on the problem of social guarantees to military 
pensioners (about 11,000), now residing in Estonia, and to 
members of their families. This problem has always been a 
stumbling block in Russo-Estonian negotiations. 
  The previous round of talks, which ended in Tallinn on March 
2, has not yielded any positive results. The agreement on the 
withdrawal of Russian troops remained unsigned. The sides 
expressed dissatisfaction with the progress of negotiations. 
According to Ambassador Vasiliy Svirin, leader of the Russian 
delegation, the Estonian side is ready to approve the draft 
agreement on the complete withdrawal of troops, but would do it 
only after it gets an exact schedule of the pullout. "The 
Russian side has such a document," Svirin said, "but it will be 
handed over to the Estonian side only after it promises to grant 
all the needed social guarantees to the military pensioners and 
members of their families, now residing in Estonia." However, 
the Estonian delegation still objects against the linking of the 
pullout problem with the question of military pensioners. It 
moved to discuss the letter separately, but also on condition 
that it should first get the pullout schedule. 
  It is common knowledge that Russia, without any agreement or 
schedule, has already withdrawn from Estonia 90 per cent of all 
its troops and now pledges to repatriate 2,500 remaining 
officers and men by August 31, 1994. 
  Commenting on the results of the 17th round of talks, Svirin 
said that the Russian delegation was disturbed by Estonia's 
deviation from the earlier achieved agreements to renounce 
mutual claims: Russia is to turn over to Estonia 4,900 military 
establishments on the territory of the republic, while the 
latter is not claim any compensation for the caused ecological 
damage. Moreover, in accordance with an earlier reached 
agreement, Estonia was to allocate 23 million U.S. dollars for 
building housing facilities for the Russian troops withdrawn 
from the republic. The ambassador said that if Estonia 
backpedaled on these agreements, Russia would be compelled to 
withdraw the remaining troops according to its own, unilaterally 
fixed schedule. 
  Speaking on the local television a short while ago, Estonian 
Foreign Minister Juri Luik said that "Estonia does not want to 
make any compromises on social guarantees to Russian military 
pensioners now living in the republic". However, he stressed 
that he hoped the agreement on the withdrawal of troops, which 
Estonia was ready to accept a month ago, would be finally 
initialled.

  [Text] The Russian Federation Ministry of Environmental 
Protection and Natural Resources categorically objects against 
burying glass-enclosed radioactive waste from Hungary on the 
territory of Russia. The opinion of the ministry as well as the 
stance of the Russian Federal Committee for Oversight of Nuclear 
and Radiation Safety and the Russian Federation Foreign Ministry 
had not been taken into account, despite official reports, at 
the time a draft protocol on this matter was agreed. 
  The Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural 
Resources will be insisting on an immediate correction of the 
document because the protocol directly violates the law "On the 
Protection of the Natural Environment."

into account her professional interests. Ugglas will meet city 
leaders to discuss problems of regional cooperation, including 
projects financed by Sw6den, and take part in a bank seminar, 
seminars on export technique and a seminar entitled "Journalism 
and Democracy."

  [Text] St. Petersburg, 5 Apr -- St. Petersburg Mayor 
Anatoliy Sobchak today received Swedish Foreign Minister 
Margaretha af Ugglas, who arrived in Russia today on a working 
visit. 
  In conversation, the sides touched upon questions of 
strengthening regional economic ties, the implementation of 
joint programmes to be financed by the Swedish side, and also 
illegal immigration and cooperation between law-enforcement 
bodies. In Margaretha af Ugglas' opinion, the setting up of a 
House of Sweden in the city on the Neva would contribute to the 
deepening of bilateral contacts, including cultural exchange. 
  At a meeting with Russian and foreign journalists she said 
that in Pskov she intended to discuss with Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev the problem of the withdrawal of Russian 
troops from the Baltic republics. Sweden's position, Margaretha 
af Ugglas stressed, is that they should be withdrawn as soon as 
possible. Replying to a question from an ITAR-TASS 
correspondent on Sweden's attitude to the "Partnership for 
Peace" program, she said that her country will be joining this 
program. And it would very much like Russia to join this 
process, too. "Sweden intends to build a new Europe together 
with Russia, and not against Russia. Russia needs to take 
reciprocal steps," the minister said.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Iraq Left Without Mustard Gas"] </F>
  [Text] R. Ekeus, chairman of the UN Security Council 
Special Commission for Disarmament, has confirmed that the bulk 
of Iraq's chemical weapons have now been destroyed and the 
requisite barriers erected to prevent Baghdad manufacturing 
these categories of arms. 
  In total 28,000 tonnes of chemical shells, warheads, and 
bombs and a sizable quantity of components for the production of 
mustard gas have been destroyed in Iraq under UN supervision. 
  By and large, Grigoriy Karasin, director of the Russian 
Foreign Ministry Press Department, believes that this can be 
seen as confirmation of Baghdad's readiness to cooperate with 
the United Nations. Such actions on Iraq's part should be 
encouraged, Russia's permanent representative to the United 
Nations said in New York during the latest examination of the 
question of sanctions against Iraq. 
  Among the problems that the UN special commission still has 
to resolve, Grigoriy Karasin cited the task of preventing the 
restoration of Iraq's military potential in the future. To this 
end, diplomats in Moscow believe, a mechanism for long-term 
international supervision of disarmament must be launched as 
soon as possible and a new "trial period" begun. 
  If Baghdad passes the test, the sanctions may be lifted.

  [Text] During a press conference on Tuesday 
Director-General of the International Kurdish Cultural Center 
Tariel Broyev accused the Russian Government of "terrorism 
against the Kurdish people and of trying to mend the Russian 
economy at the Kurds' expense." 
  To quote Broyev, the Kurds of the Middle East and the CIS 
countries will go on a hunger strike to demand that Russia 
change its policy in relation to the Kurds. 
  Broyev told Interfax that his decision to end a 16-day 
hunger 
strike did not mean that he had given up his campaign. "The 
strike has been terminated at the request of political 
organizations of Kurdistan and the Middle East," he said. 
  On March 15, Broyev went on a hunger strike in protest at 
political and economic pressure put on the Kurdish center and on 
him personally by the Russian Government. Broyev demanded that 
Russia change its attitude to the Kurdish problem and help 
Kurdish refugees in the Middle East and the former Soviet 
republics. 
  Broyev also told Interfax that two attempts had been made on 
his life after he ended the strike. He laid the blame for his 
attempted assassination on the Russian special services. He 
also stated that he would seek political refuge for his family.

  [Text] Moscow April 6 TASS -- "Russia is ready to take an 
active part in the reconstruction of iron and steel mills in 
Turkey," Russian First Vice-Premier Oleg Soskovets said here 
today during a meeting with Turkish Minister for Construction 
and Settlements Onur Kumbaracibasi. 
  Soskovets regards the petroleum and gas industry as one of 
the most promising areas of Russo-Turkish cooperation. He moved 
to set up an international consortium for building a pipeline 
between Russia and Turkey with the participation of Azerbaijan, 
Kazakhstan and Armenia. He said that Russia had efficient 
technologies for the production of pipes and could help train 
highly skilled specialists. 
  Taking into account Russia's rich experience in power 
engineering, Soskovets offered the Turkish side to build a new 
atomic power plant in Turkey. "Russian nuclear power plants 
have dependable safety systems," he said. "Moreover, they are 
much cheaper than the world prices". 
  Kumbaracibasi went on record for the construction of a new 
pipeline for transporting petroleum from the former USSR to 
Turkey. He said this would partially help solve the problem of 
the passage of tankers through the Bosphorus. 
  Russian Minister for Foreign Economic Relations Oleg 
Davydov, 
who took part in the talks, drew the Turkish delegation's 
attention to the "prospects of cooperation in marketing Russian 
special technologies". He said a 95 million U.S. dollars 
contract had already been concluded. "This will help Russia 
settle its debt to Turkey in the Paris Club within three years," 
he stressed.

hurried to explain that the rejection of budget appropriations 
for the second quarter of 1994 "should not be assessed as a 
contraposition to the State Duma or the Russian president". 
  Its press service said in a statement on Tuesday that only 
10 
lawmakers of the upper chamber were categorically against the 
document, while 82 were in favour of it. "The overwhelming 
majority voted to create... a conciliatory commission jointly 
with Duma members and edit certain articles of the document", 
the statement said. 
  "Such a principled position of the Federation Council is 
more 
important for the state than an automatic adoption of all 
lawbills submitted to the upper chamber without their thorough 
study", the document reads.

  [Text] Moscow April 5 TASS -- The Federation Council voted 
down today the federal law "on procedure to publish and 
introduce federal constitutional laws, federal laws and bills of 
the Russian Federal Assembly's chambers" adopted by the State 
Duma due to the "inadmissibility of its certain articles and 
items". 
  This is the second law submitted by the parliament's lower 
chamber to the upper one in accordance with the Constitution. 
The first law, on budget financing of spending in the second 
quarter of 1994, was approved today in repeated voting. 
  "There is nothing dramatic about this," believes Federation 
Council Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko. In his opinion, "this 
proves that the Federation Council takes its work seriously". 
  In accordance with the Constitution, a conciliatory 
commission to include members of both parliament chambers will 
be set up to settle the differences.

<F P=106> [Yevgeniy Spiridonov (ADS) report in the "Military </F>
Industrial Complex" column: "The State Defense Industry 
Committee (Goskomoboronprom) Warns That Defense Is Weakening. 
Enterprises Do Not Want To Fill Military Orders at Their Own 
Expense"] 
  [Text] If the government allocates a mere 5.5 trillion 
rubles [R] for defense, arms, and military hardware production 
while at least R28 trillion is required to maintain Russia's 
defense capability, a decision should be made to abolish the 
military order in principle because the funds allocated will 
barely be enough to cover defense enterprise debts, and will 
secure standby status for the space and nuclear forces. This 
was announced by Yuriy Glybin, Goskomoboronprom's first deputy 
chairman, at a joint session of Goskomoboronprom and the State 
Duma's Committee on Industry, Construction, Transport, and Power 
Engineering leadership held at the defense industries 
headquarters on 4 April. 
  Mr. Glybin complained that in order to offset the cost of 
arms and military hardware production, unpaid by the Defense 
Ministry, defense industry enterprises have to seek credits from 
commercial banks and repay them out of their profits received 
from marketing civilian goods. Last year, for example, no more 
than 30 percent of enterprises in the defense sector were 
solvent, mainly because, Yuriy Glybin believes, they had to pay 
R400 billion from their profits to repay commercial credits on 
defense orders. The Defense Ministry still owes the enterprises 
R870 billion. Naturally the enterprises are refusing to credit 
state defense expenditures, and by the end of March, for 
instance, they have signed merely 35 percent of contracts sought 
by customers. 
  Vitaliy Vizirov, chief of Goskomoboronprom's Main Science, 
Technology, and Conversion Directorate, said in particular that 
in the military aviation sector only 17 aircraft are to be 
manufactured -- half of an annual production program of one 
enterprise. Last year, he said, not a single new military 
equipment or weapon prototype was developed. A mere 3 to 7 
percent of the requisite funds is allocated to continue the 
building of warships, so they will take some 20 years to 
complete. Armor production capacities are also operated at 8 to 
10 percent. 
  Yelena Novikova, chief of Goskomoboronprom's General 
Economic 
Directorate, stated that with the defense expenditures 
envisioned under the 1994 draft budget, one should think not 
about filling the military production order but about closing 
and converting, in a civilized way, nearly one-third of defense 
enterprises so as not to leave 1.4 million people without the 
means of livelihood. 
  The meeting closed without any specific decisions or 
political statements although some parliamentarians were ready 
to raise the question of whether the situation within the 
military industrial complex has not come about a result of high 
treason on the part of the executive branch. At any rate, the 
parliamentarians promised the defense industry their support in 
discussing the draft budget in the State Duma on condition that 
the latter "put an end to political inaction."

<F P=106> [Interview with Sergey Glazyev, chairman of the State Duma </F>
Committee for Economic Policy, by Yelena Tokareva; place, date 
not given: "I Am for Order in the Economy and Finance"] 
  [Text] Sergey Yuryevich Glazyev, age 33, chairman of the 
State Duma Committee for Economic Policy. Doctor of economic 
sciences. Author of 100 works on questions of the economic 
development of Russia and the USSR. Since the early nineties he 
has been working on problems of the structural crisis in the 
country's economy. Author of the monograph "Theory of the 
Long-Term Technical and Economic Development of Russia and the 
USSR." Less than a month ago, S. Glazyev organized 
parliamentary hearings in the State Duma on questions of the 
crisis in our economy and programs for emerging from it. These 
hearings were attended by virtually all the authors of programs 
for emerging from the crisis: from Academicians Shatalin and 
Petrakov to Urinson, first deputy minister of the economy, and 
Saburov, now premier of the Republic of the Crimea. 
  [Tokareva] Sergey Yuryevich, you act like a man who knows 
his way in a fog. Could you formulate briefly and comprehensibly 
your amendments to the recent economic course which we know by 
the name of "shock therapy"? 
  [Glazyev] The amendments have been generally recognized. 
They were in evidence at the parliamentary hearings. And in the 
president's message. First -- the need to pursue an active 
structural policy. In our conditions, where there is a 
technological, mixed economy in which hopelessly outdated 
production facilities exist alongside new ones, while the latter 
are oriented toward state demand, it is impossible to achieve 
market equilibrium quickly. Without an active state policy of 
conversion to a modern, high-tech industry, the modernization of 
obsolete production facilities, and incentives for the growth of 
new facilities, it will be impossible to clamber out of the 
spiral of recession. Market equilibrium will be achieved at the 
cost of the destruction of the scientific and technical complex 
and the loss of potential for future economic growth. 
  Second. The imposition of order in the state sector of the 
economy. Today, with a view to reducing the budget deficit, 
items of expenditure on science, education, and health care, on 
which our society's future is directly dependent, are being 
axed. Yet nobody is worried about efficiency in the utilization 
of state property or the income from its privatization. 
  Third. The imposition of order in state finances. I do not 
believe a single country with a market economy has experienced 
such a voluntarist approach to regulating the money supply. 
This also applies to the cavalier treatment of the state 
budget, where mistakes in the correlation between income and 
expenditure amount to several orders of magnitude, and a balance 
is achieved through self-interested manipulations involving the 
arbitrary sequestration of expenditure and the control of credit 
emissions for the refinancing of commercial banks. 
  Unless these obvious gaps and shortcomings in the 
government's economic policy are eliminated, it will be 
impossible either to halt the decline in production or to get 
inflation down. Whether by orthodox methods of macroeconomic 
regulation, or by heterodox methods involving price regulation. 
Although either of these could prove productive in combination 
with an active policy in the three above-mentioned areas. 
  Let me explain. An active economic policy is called active 
precisely because it makes provision for purposeful actions. In 
particular, it may use such instruments as the state order, 
targeted federal programs, and, where necessary and possible, 
price regulation. If such a policy is not pursued, we must 
reconcile ourselves to living with galloping inflation, rapidly 
destroying production, which cannot develop in conditions where 
price correlations are constantly changing. It should, however, 
be borne in mind that price regulation may be successfully 
applied by the state only when the purpose of the regulation is 
clear. When the period for which it applies is clearly defined. 
And when the consequences are reliably predicted. A temporary 
price freeze may be used as one component in a wide package of 
measures in the event that a policy of drastically reducing 
inflation is chosen. 
  It is obvious today that the style of combating inflation 
used over the past two years is not producing the desired 
results. We can see that the task set at the beginning of the 
year, of achieving a reduction in inflation to a level of 3-5 
percent a month, cannot be achieved by using only the 
instruments of limiting the state budget deficit and regulating 
credit emissions, and the inflation rate is hovering around 20 
percent a month, a level we are now accustomed to. The reasons 
for this are also clear. The toughening of monetary and credit 
policy in the aforesaid two parameters provokes stubborn 
resistance at microeconomic level, as manifested in the 
nonpayments crisis and pressure from the regions and commercial 
banks with a view to obtaining ever more credits. A periodical 
and tough monetary policy is supplanted by a constant stream of 
credits and state expenditure. 
  As a result, instead of the desired 3-5 percent inflation a 
month, we are seeing inflation hovering between 10 and 25 
percent a month. There is no sign of a clear dependence between 
credit and monetary policy and the inflation rate. For more 
than two years now we have been in a rut, pursuing one and the 
same goal, which appears unattainable. It is time to wise up. 
  [Tokareva] What is the alternative? 
  [Glazyev] There are several tried and tested means of 
combating inflation. For instance, an agreement on rigorous 
discipline and self-restraint on income by the economic agents. 
It is necessary to seek a rationalization and clarification of 
the Central Bank's credit policy and to have a budget based on 
reliable forecasts and a properly functioning state sector, both 
of which should play an important stabilizing role in the 
economy. If, of course, we really want to suppress inflation 
quickly. 
  [Tokareva] And after that? Although, to be honest, I do not 
believe in quick methods. Inflation has been building up for 
five years. It will take five years to cure it, too. 
  [Glazyev] After that, if we succeed in reducing inflationary 
expectations, we can reduce the interest rate on credits from 
200 percent to 15-20 percent, carry out a de-indexation of 
incomes, ensure compliance with contract discipline, and 
stabilize the macroeconomic situation. 
  [Tokareva] Why has this path not been taken? 
  [Glazyev] Because it requires major efforts. An enormous 
effort by the entire state apparatus. The policy that has been 
pursued requires no effort at all. That is simpler and, strange 
as it may seem, more profitable. Though not, of course, for the 
state. 
  [Tokareva] During the discussion of the president's message 
in the Duma, you said that the Cabinet is rejecting all 
amendments to the current course. 
  [Glazyev] Not rejecting, but not accepting. The prime 
minister has formally adopted the president's message for 
execution. And the existing government program formally accords 
with the president's message. The problem is that there is a 
huge gulf between the government program of August, the recent 
government statements which we have heard, and actual practice. 
Programs exist, you can read them and rejoice in the authors' 
good intentions, but reality goes on in its own sweet way. 
  [Tokareva] Maybe the executive hierarchy feels rather weak 
and is therefore not embarking on great deeds? 
  [Glazyev] Of course, executive discipline is lacking, as are 
qualifications and political will. Therefore we continue to 
insist on a clear action plan. We are glad that the president's 
message coincided with our recommendations on questions of 
economic policy. But we need a plan consisting of measures for 
implementation by specific persons. Accountability. A time 
scale. Only thus will words become deeds. 
  [Tokareva] But nowadays we do not have a party that can use 
fear to call its members to account. 
  [Glazyev] The president has sufficient levers to make the 
government implement the domestic policy he has proclaimed.

<F P=106> [Report by Raimonda Rameliene: "The Vilnius Echo of the </F>
Meeting"] 
  [Excerpts] At yesterday's press conference, President A. 
Brazauskas briefly surveyed the results of the summit meeting of 
the three Baltic presidents in Palanga and replied to 
journalists' questions. 
  Asked why the Palanga meeting did not set up the Council of 
the Baltic Presidents, A. Brazauskas replied: "Presidents' 
meetings and contacts should not be squeezed into a fixed and 
regulated framework." The experience of the Nordic countries 
also confirms this. Therefore, all the three presidents came to 
the conclusion that it was inexpedient to establish such an 
institution. 
  The free trade agreement among Latvia, Estonia, and 
Lithuania 
comes into effect as of 1 April. Did not the meeting discuss 
other inter-state agreements and the possibility of creating a 
Baltic bloc? According to A. Brazauskas, there was no mention 
of any blocs. [passage omitted] 
  As usual, journalists wanted to hear the president's opinion 
on some pressing domestic policy issues. 
  Asked whether he, as the chief commander of armed forces, 
has 
sanctioned the searches in the national defense system, A. 
Brazauskas replied: "I as the commander-in-chief of the armed 
forces deal with the latter rather than with matters of criminal 
persecution or searches." The state has institutions that must 
perform this work, although it is sometimes very unpleasant and 
difficult. 
  The searches were approved by the Prosecutor General's 
Office, and the prosecutor general is responsible for this move. 
"Certainly, it is unpleasant when politics is confused with 
crime," said the president. Normal persecution should be 
conducted in line with the Penal Code, while no one should look 
for sanctions where they should not be. At the same time, the 
president expressed his discontent with the fact that 
"television and other mass media want to adopt the role of the 
prosecutor's office. According to the speaker, "no case can be 
resolved on the television screen." Such attempts only arouse 
unnecessary human emotions, "many hints, illusions, reflections, 
rumors, and so on." 
  In the president's opinion, such political moves are "too 
conceited and picturesque, but with no content." It is the 
latter that law enforcement institutions must find and assess 
calmly, with skill and responsibility, and without turning it 
into a show. 
  A. Brazauskas called the statement by the association 
"Selma," which threatens to suspend the construction of housing 
for the Russian military in Kaliningrad and demands the release 
of association President V. Laurinavicius, a political challenge 
and a shot into the air. "They have an agreement and must 
execute it. Judicial institutions will establish whether their 
president is guilty or not," said the state leader. 
  Commenting on the conservatives' statement concerning the 
construction of the oil terminal, the president did not want to 
agree that it was delayed. The key decisions have already been 
adopted, and the government should announce the winner of the 
competition shortly. The issue of financing is urgent. The 
business plan should be ready by late March, which "will be a 
good basis for talks with large financial organizations and 
foreign banks that would undertake to subsidize this endeavor." 
  Asked about the law on land recently adopted by the Seimas 
[parliament], A. Brazauskas said that he had received it only 
that Monday [28 March]. Thus, "the clock has begun counting 10 
days and nights" since yesterday, within which time the 
president must study and discuss the law. The president said 
that he knew the emotional and even unhealthy reaction that the 
adoption of the document had caused in the Seimas. Before 
signing (or rejecting) the law, the president promised to study 
it thoroughly along with specialists.

  [Text] Vilnius, Apr 05, BNS - A special group of experts 
has been set up to the Lithuanian working group for talks with 
CIS to recover Lithuanian archives kept in Russia. The group is 
headed by Gediminas Ilgunas, director general of the Lithuanian 
State Archive. 
  The Lithuanian Foreign Ministry has sent a note to Russia 
requesting to set up a similar commission. 
  The return of archives was discussed March 31 at a meeting 
between Nikolay Obertyshev, Russia's ambassador to Lithuania, 
and Albinas Januska, Lithuanian deputy foreign minister. The 
ambassador reportedly said that Russia has no legal or historic 
grounds to return archives to Lithuania and sees no purpose to 
create a commission for talks in order to deal with the problem. 
Januska said Lithuania reserves the right to negotiate the 
matter at interstate talks. 
  In an interview with the RESPUBLIKA newspaper, Ilgunas said 
the Russian ambassador's statement contradicts the international 
principles of archiving, according to which, archives must be 
kept where they are created. 
  Ilgunas said Russia began taking out Lithuanian archives in 
the times of the czarist empire. In his words, a collection of 
legislative acts of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and documents 
of Lithuania's provinces were taken out before 1915. Lithuania 
archives were also taken out after the Soviet occupation in 
1940. The Soviets took a number of documents of the pre-war 
Lithuanian republic, the archives of the president's office, 
including the Feb. 16, 1918 Independence Act. Archives were 
last taken out in 1989-1991 from the KGB building in Vilnius. 
  KGB criminal and filtration files of the 1940's were 
recovered in 1992. Russia later said that the files were used 
against persons mentioned in them, but Ilgunas declined to 
comment on these allegations.

<F P=106> [Interview with LDDP Deputy Chairman Viktoras Kovsovas by </F>
Gintautas Kniuksta in Vilnius; date not given: "Government -- 
Not Only the Prime Minister and Ministers..."] 
  [Excerpts] [Kniuksta] [Passage omitted] Late March 
marks the first anniversary of A. Slezevicius' government. How 
do you assess your colleagues' work? In your opinion, what did 
they manage or fail to accomplish? It is easier for you as a 
person who does not hold any office in the executive sector to 
notice what should be corrected immediately. 
  [Kovsovas] A year is a short period of time, but social 
hostility has decreased and political tensions have subsided. A 
community of citizens is being created, even though with 
difficulty and contradictions, and quite often with mistakes and 
scandals. I suppose that this is a large contribution of A. 
Slezevicius' government. 
  Let us not forget that this government curbed inflation, 
introduced the litas, hit a blow to organized crime, and had the 
Russian Army withdrawn. I think that many people notice other 
smaller or greater deeds. However, I also see things that, in 
my opinion, are being done improperly. 
  First of all, the government is not only the prime minister 
and ministers. I have heard repeated reprimands that good deeds 
or plans often stall and "die" in the middle level of 
ministries. It is the government's task to ensure that each 
employee values his or her job and strives after results, and 
that good and unselfish work is properly rewarded. 
  [Kniuksta] You often tour regions. How do people in 
the province assess the activities of the Lithuanian Democratic 
Labor Party [LDDP]? Do you write a diary or like to make 
predictions, for example, concerning the elections to local 
councils, after such trips? By the way, what results do you 
expect from these elections? 
  [Kovsovas] LDDP activities are assessed in different ways -- 
from categorical negation and politicized appraisals to moderate 
approval. I have the impression that most people are well aware 
of the difficult economic situation and possibilities, they 
advise us to be more courageous and resolute. [passage omitted] 
  [Kniuksta]Regarding economic stability, some people say 
that the LDDP should overcome the crisis in Lithuania over 1994 
and 1995. At the same time, there are people who shout that the 
LDDP is incapable of ruling the state and demand new elections 
to the Seimas [parliament]. 
  [Kovsovas] Economic stability can be assessed from different 
aspects, depending on the criteria we choose. I think that the 
rate of economic decline is falling, which means that positive 
changes are inevitable. There will be many reasons responsible 
for the nature of the latter and the time of their emergence. 
One of them is stability in the political situation and 
government activities. Talk about LDDP's incompetence in 
governing the country or even its damaging rule only 
demonstrates the reluctance or inability of political opponents 
to see the real situation. 
  The LDDP and its leaders have not discussed early elections 
to the Seimas. I suppose that the constant propaganda of this 
idea is one of the methods for trying to disseminate 
uncertainty, indefiniteness, and doubt. This implies that one 
should not communicate, help, or show effort, but must condemn 
and hate. Such principles are not beneficial for our small 
country. 
  [Kniuksta] [Passage omitted]Currently, many political 
parties are inclined to accuse the LDDP for not adhering to its 
electoral promises. For example, Social Democrat A. Sakalas 
remembers in one of his interviews that after learning the 
results of the elections, your colleague G. Kirkilas [LDDP first 
deputy chairman] held his head in the hands saying: "What are 
we going to do now?" Are not such explanations similar to the 
desire to cool one's tea, although it will cool off by itself 
over time. 
  [Kovsovas] I will not hide the fact that the results of the 
Seimas elections partly exceeded our predictions. We can only 
advise that those who accuse us of failing to implement the 
program take and read it. The program does not contain many 
items of which we are often accused. However, it reads that we 
will put an end to social opposition and instigation, and seek 
to stabilize the economic decline. 
  Unfortunately, politics is not a class or a school 
[reference 
to Kovsovas' former occupation as a school teacher]. The 
student and sometimes also the teacher must think about the 
possibility of correcting the committed mistake. Political 
mistakes often affect thousands of people. Constituents at 
least authorize other people to correct mistakes committed by 
separate politicians and political forces. 
  [Kniuksta]As for a coalition with other parties, the 
same man A. Sakalas has stated that the Social Democrats cannot 
form a coalition with the LDDP because the latter is not a 
homogeneous party today. According to Mr. Sakalas, it is a 
compilation of people with three or four views: Nomeklatura, 
the prosocial democratic university group, old functionaries, 
and quite a large group representing big capital. What would be 
your reply? 
  [Kovsovas] One could really not reprimand the Social 
Democrats for a lack of attention to the LDDP. We are grateful 
for this. I do not know a single homogeneous party in 
Lithuania. Each political organization, and the press has also 
reported on the Social Democrats, is based on different people. 
  Reflections about the composition of other parties only show 
that one assumes to know more about the party in question. The 
use of such words as "functionaries" and "nomenklatura" reflects 
the desire to belittle and humiliate someone. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Vilnius, April 5, ELTA -- Lithuanian trade unions 
attempt to introduce to Lithuania tripartite social agreement 
system based on the western patterns. The problems related to 
the establishment of the system were discussed at a news 
conference on Tuesday [5 April]. Members of the association of 
trade unions participated in the news conference. 
  One of the participants, Roma Dovydeniene, said that social 
partnership existed in Lithuania only on the theoretical basis. 
According to her, none of 42 international working union 
conventions were ratified by Lithuania with the exception of a 
few ones which had been ratified before the war. 
  Trade unions have been seeking that a tripartite agreement 
on 
the cooperation in the job market should be signed among 
employers, Government and trade unions since November, 1993. 
According to the participants of the news conference, the 
employers -- businessmen and industrialists -- were not ready to 
sign such agreement. Thus trade unions consider possibilities 
of signing the agreement with Government. 
  Leaders of the trade unions regretted that Seimas 
[parliament] had not approved amendments of the draft law on 
trade unions and labour. Trade unions demanded that a certain 
procedure should be legalized according to which the employee 
could not be dismissed from the job without the approval of 
trade unions. 
  Seimas also rejected the demand that members of trade unions 
could not be dismissed from their jobs without the approval of 
trade unions. No approval was given to the demand to supplement 
the law on trade unions with a provision which would oblige the 
employer to allot money for the education and further 
qualification of members of trade unions. 
  So trade unions appealed to the president with the request 
not to approve the amendments of the laws on job contract and 
trade union. 
  Dainius Paukste said that estimations showed that trade 
unions united 25-30 percent of working people in Lithuania. 
  The association of the Lithuanian trade unions unites nine 
trade unions with 81 thousand members.

  [Text] Vilnius, Apr 06, BNS -- 3,500 men will be called up 
for mandatory service in the Lithuanian armed forces during this 
year's spring conscription. 
  Major Gediminas Jurciukonis, assistant head of the Voluntary 
Defense Service headquarters, said some 11,000 men aged above 19 
could be called up but only 30-40 percent of recruits are fit 
for military service. 
  The conscription will not affect university students, men 
aged above 27, clergymen of registered religious communities, 
persons sentenced to jail terms of over three years, fathers of 
two or more children and men who are the only bread-winners in 
their families. 
  Jurciukonis said over 60 percent of recruits are expected to 
report to call-up commissions this year. The major said 57 and 
49 percent reported to call-up commissions during last year's 
fall and spring conscriptions respectively. 
  Those who will not report to call-up commissions will be 
fined 106 lits. 1,600 men were fined last year but only half of 
them paid the fines. Those who do not report to a commission 
repeatedly may face legal action. 
  This year, recruits are examined by medical boards at local 
hospitals, which should make the selection better, Jurciukonis 
said. In his words, 5 percent of the recruits called up last 
year were later pronounced unfit for military service.

  [Text] Moscow, 6 Apr -- Pending the release of an edict by 
the Russian president defining special regulations for 
privatizing property on the territory of the capital and the 
approval of a municipal program of privatization for 1994, 
Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov has suspended denationalization of 
real estate by his own instruction. 
  The document says: "To suspend temporarily the privatization 
of buildings and nonresidential premises unless they are to be 
part of the company capital of joint-stock companies set up by 
transforming state enterprises in accordance with the existing 
legislation." The mayor declined to entrust anyone with 
supervising the implementation of instruction and reserved the 
supervision for himself.

  [Text] Vladikavkaz 6 April, TASS -- "The Russian 
president's decree on extending the state of emergency had a 
positive response among the North Ossetian population on the 
whole, since there is a threat of another conflict now," North 
Ossetian Vice-Premier Georgiy Kozayev told ITAR-TASS here on 
Wednesday. 
  "Therefore, the extension of the state of emergency in some 
areas by another two months is a necessary measure. Russian 
peace keepers are the main guarantor of security in the conflict 
zone," he added. 
  Kozayev noted that the North Ossetian leadership is very 
concerned over the safety of machine operators engaged in spring 
sowing: Several cases were registered when tractor drivers were 
blown up by mines. 
  The temporary administration and the republican Interior 
Ministry came forward with an initiative to station mobile 
patrols in localities, which now exercise control over spring 
sowing in areas bordering Ingushetia. 
  According to Kozayev, the key issue for the republican 
leadership is the comprehensive solution of the problem of 
refugees as well as their housing. He said that a residential 
area out of prefabricated houses mushroomed in the village of 
Zavodsky in a Vladikavkaz suburb. 
  It will house refugee families from the Prigorodnyy district 
(it is divided between North Ossetia and Ingushetia), Georgia, 
the Chechen Republic and Tajikistan. The list of future 
residents was determined by a commission of the industrial 
district administration together with the republican migration 
service. 
  The migration service now works on the lists of refugees to 
be housed in the Mozdok, Sovetskiy and Leninskiy districts of 
the Republic.

  [Text] Elista 5 April, TASS -- The constitutional assembly 
of Kalmykia, a steppe republic in southern Russia, has abolished 
its Constitution on Tuesday and adopted a new one called the 
"Steppe Charter." 
  "Kalmykia has raised to a new level in its development. A 
new historic step was made. Only unity can help us survive," 
President Kirsan Ilyumzhinov stated. 
  Ilyumzhinov had earlier announced his intention to abolish 
the republican constitution, which caused a mixed reaction in 
Moscow. 
  According to the Russian Constitution, republics within the 
Federation have their own constitutions, while regions and 
territories have their charters. The status of a subject of the 
Russian Federation can be changed only upon agreement with the 
Federation.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Sergey Balyutskiy: "The Winner Was </F>
Kaliningrad's Biggest Party -- the Electorate"] 
  [Text] Kaliningrad Oblast -- Compared with other regions 
of Russia the elections in its Westernmost Oblast -- Kaliningrad 
Oblast -- proceeded almost smoothly. They will have to be held 
again in one of the 21 electoral districts. That is the 
quantitative aspect, as they say. 
  As for the qualitative aspect, here there are only enigmas. 
After all, today no one here can answer a seemingly simple 
question like who, what political force, will call the tune in 
the oblast duma? The actual ban on running on party lists and 
the considerably simpler registration procedure for independent 
deputies than for deputies from political parties and 
associations (the former had to submit a protocol from a voters' 
meeting in which at least 30 people took part!) have led to the 
point where all elected deputies will represent themselves. Nor 
have the bureaucrats had any luck. Even Kaliningrad Mayor V. 
Shipov lost his round to the doctor G. Petrachenko. 
  Indifference was the dominant feeling among the Kaliningrad 
people. That is borne out by the number of those who came to 
vote -- two-thirds of the voters registered on the lists stayed 
at home that day.

<F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Pozdnyakov in the "Embarrassment" </F>
column: "Half the St. Petersburg City Assembly Has Been Elected. 
`Strange People' Have Beaten Election Blocs Leaders"] 
  [Text] Although, according to some reports, a mere 18 
percent of the electorate turned out, the second round of 
elections to the St. Petersburg City Assembly has taken place. 
The results have shaken the major election blocs. Their 
leaders -- Aleksandr Belyayev, former chairman of the St. 
Petersburg City Council and Federation Council deputy 
(Democratic Unity of St. Petersburg); and Viktor Kharchenko, 
former chief of the Baltic Shipping Company (Working St. 
Petersburg) -- failed to get into the City Assembly. Mr. 
Belyayev was unexpectedly defeated in his own constituency by 
Aleksandr Shchelkanov, the former first democratically elected 
mayor of Leningrad who ran as an independent candidate, and Mr. 
Kharchenko was left far behind by Sergey Andreyev, leader of the 
For Justice movement, known for his participation in all 
election campaigns in the city. 
  As of now, Vice Mayor Vyacheslav Shcherbakov and the mayor's 
chief adviser Vatanyar Yagya, who are in opposition to City 
Mayor Anatoliy Sobchak, will sit in the new City Assembly. The 
representative power body of Russia's second largest city will 
also include the "doctors'" candidate Leonid Petrov, who swore 
to introduce stable bread prices; and Valeriy Selivanov, who, in 
addition to that, promised regulated prices for major 
foodstuffs. None of the blocs obtained not only a majority in 
the future City Assembly, but even a sufficient number of seats 
to produce any influence on its activity. 
  It can be concluded that the St. Petersburg electors have in 
their majority voted "against moneybags," which manifested 
itself especially graphically in the defeat of Mr. Kharchenko 
and Ilya Baskin, a well-known entrepreneur from the Democratic 
Unity of St. Petersburg bloc. Observers are worried most by the 
victory of obviously fringe individuals like Mr. Andreyev (who 
won notoriety for forging signatures and stealing seals in all 
organizations where he worked initially and then registering the 
International Institute for Baltic Studies as a public 
organization in which he eventually turned out to be the sole 
member -- its "director"). Commentators note that the 
democratic forces, after the first round of the elections, 
hastened to take comfort in the defeat of the 
"Zhirinovskiy-ites", communists and nationalists, and, a result, 
victory went to candidates like Mr. Andreyev. 
  It is not known how the election blocs will behave after 
their devastating surprise defeat. Possibly, by joining their 
efforts, the blocs will be able to have the election results 
annulled, especially given that the Mayor's Office, having ended 
up with only half the City Assembly, partially reminiscent of a 
chamber of curiosities, may not uphold the legitimacy of its 
decisions with its previous fervor. In any event, the City 
Assembly cannot start working before fall owing to a lack of a 
quorum, and it is not ruled out that the election blocs leaders, 
drawing a lesson from the mistakes of the first election round, 
will be able to avenge themselves at least partially in the fall 
race for mandates.

opposed. He previously chaired the former regional soviet. 
  Tuleyev, 50, is a Federation Council member. In the 1991 
presidential elections he won the fourth, last but one, place. 
Now he is in opposition to Federal Authorities. 
  In its address to the local population, the Kemerovo 
legislature declared its willingness to continue the

<F P=106> [Unattributed report under the "Elections" rubric: "A. </F>
Tuleyev's Supporters Win"] 
  [Text] Siberia is one of the last Russian regions to sum 
up the results of the March elections to organs of 
representative power. According to the electoral commission's 
data, 30 deputies out of 35 hopefuls were elected to the 
Kuzbass' oblast representative organ of power, the legislative 
assembly. An unprecedentedly low voter turnout was noted -- 
approximately one-third of registered voters went to the polls. 
  Approximately two-thirds of seats in the legislative 
assembly 
were won by supporters of Aman Tuleyev, former chairman of 
Kemerovo Oblast Soviet, who is vigorously campaigning for a

<F P=106> [Article by VLADIVOSTOK correspondent Sergey Bulakh: </F>
"Ecological Catastrophe in Bolshoy Kamen Is Perhaps Two Months 
Away"] 
  [Text] As we have already reported, the commission headed 
by Yevgeniy Stomatyuk, chairman of the kray administration 
committee for natural resources, worked in Bolshoy Kamen on 
Wednesday with a group of journalists. It visited the Vostok and 
Zvezda plants, where nuclear submarines are dismantled and 
radioactive waste stored. 
  As a result of eight hours of work at the city and plant 
administration offices and an examination of the facilities 
where liquid radioactive waste is kept, the commission prepared 
a protocol which states unequivocally that the situation in 
Bolshoy Kamen is fast approaching critical. The main conclusion: 
"We should expect an emergency situation involving TNT-5 to 
develop in April-May." 
  The liquid radioactive waste problem is increasingly often 
associated with the Far Eastern plant Zvezda. According to the 
commission's estimate, about 2,253 cubic meters of it is kept 
here, with total radioactivity exceeding 30 curies. It is all 
kept in seven tankers, which are moored at the plant's piers. 
Two tankers -- TNT-5 and TNT-27 -- acquired notoriety around the 
world after the liquid radioactive waste dumping in October of 
last year, and the third--TNT Pinega -- is just beginning 
service in this capacity. 
  TNT-5 is currently in the most critical situation. The 
vessel, built at the beginning of the 1960's and decommissioned 
two years ago, now represents the main danger. Its tanks hold 
794 cubic meters of liquid radioactive waste with a total 
radioactivity of 0.776 curies. Over the past three months the 
radiation level in the stern and engine compartments increased 
threefold and now measures 1,400 microroentgen an hour. Because 
of malfunctioning systems and equipment, up to 10 cubic meters 
spilled from the tanks into the vessel's body over this time. 
Analysis of radionuclides in the tankers and samples of soil at 
the pier under the mooring area show that radioactive waste may 
leak not only into the tanker's body but also into the bay's 
aquatic area. 
  The opinion of the commission, which consisted of 
representatives of various agencies, as well as those of Bolshoy 
Kamen, the plant, and the Pacific Fleet administrations, is 
unanimous: Tanker TNT-5 has to be urgently hauled outside 
Bolshoy Kamen bay and the content of its tanks dumped. 
  These and many other conclusions may remain on paper, 
however. 
  "The problem is that radioactive waste is stored on the 
territory of the Zvezda plant, but does not belong to it," the 
enterprise's chief engineer Yuriy Shulgan said at the meeting 
with the commission. "The owner is the Pacific Fleet." 
  "After the Government of Russia banned liquid radioactive 
waste dumping, the fleet also has been unable to resolve this 
problem," emphasized the Pacific Fleet deputy commander, Rear 
Admiral Nikolay Lysenko. 
  The facility for storage and processing of radioactive 
waste, 
including liquid, which existed in the 1960's at the Sysoyev 
Cape was closed down temporarily by the Pacific Fleet more than 
20 years ago; in the opinion of specialists, it is unlikely that 
this facility could be restored. 
  Construction of a new facility, regardless of which design 
and whose money was used, cannot be accomplished in less than 
six to nine months. Meanwhile, the tanker, despite the fleet's 
energetic efforts to keep it afloat, may, if not sink, at least 
begin seriously leaking radioactive waste. 
  "Right now we are only talking about the waste stored in the 
tanker, but this is only part of the problem," emphasized 
Dmitriy Gichev, deputy chief of the Vladivostok consolidated 
inspectorate for nuclear and radioactive safety. "Over 30 years 
of active exploitation, the TNT itself has become a source of 
radioactive contamination. Even if we pump the contents out of 
it, there remains the equally serious problem of dismantling the 
tanker itself." 
  The commission's protocol is as alarming as it is hopeless. 
Maritime Kray is unable to solve a problem whose roots are in 
Moscow. Neither the plants, nor the fleet, nor the 
administration received any reply to their numerous appeals to 
Moscow. Just as there is no federal financing for the program of 
improving radiation safety drafted by the Government of Russia 
in August last year. The issue of building a radioactive waste 
processing facility in Maritime Kray was to be resolved under 
the provisions of this program. 
  Moreover, from the faraway offices of the Moscow military 
brass an order arrived at the fleet to prohibit access to 
military facilities to anyone whatsoever. Therefore, the kray 
commission had to go to Moscow to obtain permission to examine 
the decommissioned TNT-5. Journalists were not permitted on 
board this "classified military facility" (which, I repeat, was 
decommissioned from the Pacific Fleet two years ago). 
  Compared to other enterprises (the Urals Mayak plant, for 
instance, is in need of reprocessing liquid radioactive waste 
with a radioactivity level of 500 million curies), Bolshoy 
Kamen's 30 curies may look like a drop in the bucket, but it is 
our ocean, as it is our land on which we live and the products 
of which we consume. Why should we all remain hostages to a 
government that is trying to maintain a good image in the eyes 
of the world at the expense of our health and safety? 
  By the way, in the opinion of specialists, if a catastrophe 
with TNT-5 does occur in Bolshoy Kamen, because of the 
specificity of underwater currents the main victim will be 
Vladvostok. Specialists already note a higher radioactivity of 
bottom-layer sediment in Shamora and Tavaiza bays as a result of 
work with nuclear submarines at the Zvezda plant. 
  So far the situation in Bolshoy Kamen is relatively calm. 
The 
plants were promised a 200,000 ruble advance for February, 
provided there is enough cash. Another nuclear submarine has 
arrived for repairs. On the one hand, it is work for thousands 
of people; on the other, new cubic meters of radioactive water, 
which may become the last drop that will cause the cup of 
radioactive equilibrium to overflow -- and then we will have an 
ecological catastrophe. The bureaucrats in Moscow refuse to see 
this, however.

  [Text] [No dateline as received] -- The Georgian Parliament 
today debated yesterday's signing in Moscow of a package of 
Georgian-Abkhaz documents on a peaceful settlement to the 
conflict. During the debate, radically different opinions were 
expressed about a number of clauses in the agreement, including 
those depriving the refugees who fought against Abkhazia -- and 
who are at present members of armed units ready to enter its 
territory -- of their rights to be repatriated. 
  Georgian Deputy Prime Minister Tamaz Nadareishvili, and 
former deputy chairman of the Supreme Council of the Autonomous 
Republic of Abkhazia, gave a sharply negative assessment of the 
documents signed in Moscow, and stressed that they deprive 
thousands of deported Georgians who had fought for the 
territorial integrity of their country of the right to return to 
their homeland. Tamaz Nadareishvili proposed three acceptable 
ways to settle the conflict in Abkhazia, one of which envisages 
an armed solution of the problem. Nadareishvili is convinced 
that the two other ways, which are based on peaceful, political 
principles, will not be accepted by the Gudauta government, 
which readily disregards with impunity any peace agreement. 
  Nodar Natadze, the leader of the People's Front of Georgia, 
and a member of parliament, described the documents signed in 
Moscow as Georgia's "unconditional surrender" to the 
separatists. He noted that such a "sacrifice" is totally 
unjustified, since it did not serve any long-term aims favorable 
for Georgia. 
  Irina Sarishvili, a leader of the National Democratic Party 
of Georgia, in her assessment of the signing of the 
Georgian-Abkhaz documents in Moscow, said that in their most 
important part concerning the return of refugees, the documents 
are a "political and psychological warning" to the Georgian 
population of Abkhazia, depriving them of the right to express 
any protest or disagreement with the activities of the Gudauta 
clique. Irina Sarishvili expressed the opinion that if, under 
the agreement, a "battle-worthy" population returns to Abkhazia, 
it will be crushed there. Georgians who are not "battle worthy" 
will "reregistered as Abkhazians," thereby increasing the number 
of votes which Abkhaz leader Vladislav Ardzinba needs to hold a 
referendum on Abkhazia's secession from Georgia. 
  The debate on the issue of Abkhazia continued at the evening 
session of parliament.

States regards the Crimea as an integral part of Ukraine and 
sees the resolution of the peninsula's problems in the economic 
sphere. The ambassador underlined that assistance granted by 
the United States to Ukraine for the implementation of joint 
projects, is also meant for businesses in the Crimea. The sides 
also discussed the issue of assisting Ukraine in resettling 
Crimean Tatar emigrants and resolving problems related to the 
Chernobyl catastrophe. A wide range of issues concerning 
agricultural cooperation were also tackled. The meeting was 
attended by Yuriy Karasyk, Ukrainian minister of agriculture and 
food.

  [Text] Tallinn, Apr 05, BNS -- Estonian officials 
dismissed rumors today about a radiation leak having taken place 
at the Russian base of Paldiski, where Russia is scheduled soon 
to start dismantling two nuclear reactors in its former 
submarine crew training facility. 
  The rumors were spread after a Russian-language radio 
station 
aired reports of an accident at the reactor facility today. 
  Estonian Rescue Department officials were dispatched to the 
site to check the radiation level around the base. Radiation 
near the reactor building was no higher that the background of 
the previous days and is lower than the maximum allowed by the 
norms, said Juri Tikk, the Estonian Government's representative 
at Paldiski. Also Estonian police who observed the site found 
no signs of a possible nuclear accident, Tikk added. 
  "I'm absolutely sure everything is all right at Paldiski," 
he 
said. 
  Tikk said rumors had spread in the morning of a black cloud 
forming above the reactor building. He said the rumor had been 
taken so seriously in some places that people were ready to 
start evacuation of schools and kindergartens. 
  "I suppose the rumors may have arisen from earlier 
suppositions by some Estonian officials that the taking out of 
nuclear fuel from the reactors is going to start on Apr. 5," 
Tikk said. 
  Estonian authorities are now trying to find out who started 
the rumors. 
  Also in Paldiski, rumors spread late last month about 
Estonian authorities registering the residents in the town in 
preparation of a massive deportation.

  [Text] The peace agreement that Georgia and Abkhazia signed 
in Moscow on April 4 can be used as the basis for sending U.N. 
peacekeepers to the region, Georgian envoy Aleksandr Kavsadze 
believes. The agreement provides for the return of Georgian 
refugees and displaced persons to their homes in Abkhazia. 
  Speaking at the Georgian Embassy in Moscow on Tuesday, 
Kavsadze said the two sides had agreed on further measures aimed 
at bringing a negotiated settlement to the conflict. 
  The four party commission (Georgia, Abkhazia, Russia and the 
U.N.) is to hold its first session to discuss the refugee issue 
in Sochi on April 8, Kavsadze said. 
  The negotiators are expected to decide on whether to send 
peacekeepers to the region at the next round in Geneva on April 
12. 
  The future of Abkhazia will be the subject of discussion in 
Geneva on April 19. International lawyers will also attend.

<F P=106> [Report by Boris Vinogradov: "Russia Takes On Mission as </F>
Chief Peacemaker in Georgian-Abkhazian Conflict"] 
  [Text] Two Georgian-Abkhazian agreements have been signed 
in Moscow, inspiring hope of the long-awaited end to the 
conflict. 
  Russia's peacemaking role in securing these accords has 
received an unequivocally high rating. Moscow is still pressing 
for the UN Security Council to confer on Russia the status of 
international peacemaker. Butrus Butrus-Ghali seems not to be 
opposed to this. He cautiously confirmed that possibility. But 
only in theory, in other words if multilateral forces are sent 
to Abkhazia at any time and the Russian Army might be involved 
in these forces and total 20-30 percent of the entire 
contingent. At the same time Butrus-Ghali agreed that Moscow is 
the most feasible force capable of influencing policy in the 
"nearby foreign countries" and it holds the keys to a settlement 
of the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict. 
  Therefore the prospects of Russian citizens trying UN blue 
helmets for size in the immediate future are hardly brilliant. 
Experiencing financial difficulties as it is, the world 
community is simply unwilling to literally pay for peace in the 
former Soviet empire. Russia will obviously have to perform 
this mission itself in one way or another. It is no coincidence 
that Eduard Shevardnadze, who pinned so many hopes on UN forces 
and observers, described their activity as passive and futile 
when there was fighting under way in Abkhazia last week and 
people were dying. 
  The first document pertaining to a settlement in Abkhazia 
constitutes pledges on a cease-fire and refraining from using 
force. The second represents the terms for the return to 
Abkhazia of over 200,000 refugees who have gathered on the 
Georgian bank of the Inguri River. The signing ceremony was 
attended by UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, his 
personal representative Eduard Brunner [name as transliterated], 
and Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev. Such lofty 
patronage ruled out any possibility of either side pulling out 
at the last minute as has happened repeatedly, and at the same 
time creates guarantees for the implementation of the accords. 
  In an interview with IZVESTIYA, Eduard Brunner particularly 
noted the peacemaking efforts made by Russian diplomacy, thanks 
to which, he said, a major step has been taken toward solving a 
very complex situation in one of the regions of the Caucasus. 
  The Moscow agreements were largely the result of compromise 
and concessions on Tbilisi's part. They resolve current 
problems and lay the foundation for talks on the main issue -- 
the political status of Abkhazia. Georgia lost the political 
initiative with its edict dissolving the parliament in Sukhumi. 
During recent combat operations it suffered another defeat. 
And now Tbilisi has been forced to accept the kind of wordings 
that it refused to hear of previously. 
  So, for the first time, the agreements do not mention 
Georgian territorial integrity -- a fundamental principle at all 
the previous talks. Russia and the United Nations nevertheless 
underline their commitment to this principle. Andrey Kozyrev 
once again confirmed that Russian foreign policy is still based 
on recognition of Georgia as a unified state. 
  Tbilisi has also renounced its previous demand for all 
refugees without exception to return freely. This agreement 
does admittedly stipulate terms for admitting those who have 
laid down their arms and have promised not to take them up 
again, even if they fought on Georgia's side. Only those 
formations and field commanders that are continuing the war are 
barred from crossing the Inguri River. Presumably, the 
repatriation mechanism will be finalized still further with the 
participation of UN observers at local level and the Russian 
military. A schedule has not yet been drawn up. The 
international commission for refugees is to convene in Sochi. 
Then there will be peacekeeping forces on the banks of the 
Inguri River. The operation is expected to begin within the 
next few days in order to give people a chance to carry out 
spring field work. In the prevailing situation battalions of the 
Russian Group of Forces in the Transcaucasus are the main 
guarantor of stability.

  [Text] Moscow April 5 TASS -- "I am convinced that the 
agreement on civic accord In Russia is possible and necessary 
for all of us, both politicians and Russian citizens," says a 
message of Russian President Boris Yeltsin sent today to the 
parliament speakers, possible signatories to the agreement and 
mass media bodies. 
  "The agreement shows that our new political system is 
consolidating, we are turning more powerful and sincere and 
political ambitions and interests have less power on us. 
  "However, the improvement, adoption and implementation of 
the 
agreement can be hampered: Mutual mistrust and striving for 
victories at the expense of the opponent are still great. This 
cannot be forgotten, if we really want to achieve accord and 
civic peace in Russia," stressed the message.

<F P=106> ["Boris Yeltsin: Toward Concluding Agreement on Achieving </F>
Civic Accord in Russia" -- ITAR-TASS headline] 
  [Text] [No dateline as received] -- The first stage of work 
on the text of an agreement on achieving civic accord in Russia 
has been concluded. While preparing it, the possibility of 
joint constructive (?work between) various branches of power, 
parties and trade unions has become apparent. The text prepared 
by the working group is being distributed for publication and 
general discussion. But no less complex and important stages lie 
ahead. In this connection I want to share my thoughts about the 
idea of civic peace and accord and further possible measures. 
<H5>  Need for Agreement </H5>
  The Agreement on achieving civic accord in Russia arises 
from 
what has happened in the political life of the country -- no 
matter how contradictory it may seem -- and from the need to 
ensure political stability in society and to encourage the 
shoots of civic peace. Not a single serious problem of economic 
and social change can be solved without this. 
  The agreement would help to protect the emerging Russian 
democracy against political extremism. So far we, in fact, have 
only one democratic instrument to protect society and the state 
-- the new Constitution. This is not enough. Besides the Main 
Law, democratic traditions and a culture of dialogue, compromise 
and partnership are needed. 
  The recent elections in March showed how justified is the 
concern expressed in the address of the Russian president 
regarding the alienation of society from power and the 
population from politics. Only by proving to people that 
politicians, parties and state institutes can come to an 
agreement, find common positions and effectively solve important 
public tasks can one hope to overcome this alienation. 
<H5>  The Possibility of an Agreement </H5>
  Skeptical voices are heard saying that in the present 
condition of society an agreement is impossible. This point of 
view leads down a blind alley. I consider that the adoption and 
implementation of an agreement are realistic. Society is tired 
of confrontation, it is demanding civic peace, consensus, 
stability (not, however, the stability of immobility, but the 
stability of movement, economic and political reformation). 
  The people's need is sensed by the politicians, and this is 
clearly heard in the individual statements and declarations of 
the most varied political forces. 
  An agreement is furthermore possible because it reflects and 
consolidates mechanisms of consensus that have already started 
to operate, which is attested by the examples of joint work by 
the representatives of different branches of power on specific 
problems. 
  The whole population, the majority of political parties and 
a 
considerable proportion of the corps of deputies have an 
interest in consensus and political stability. With what 
political explosions are fraught is clear to all. At the same 
time -- and this is fully justified -- many are counting on 
legal mechanisms of obtaining power, which work only amid 
political stability. 
<H5>  Main Tasks of Agreement </H5>
  The tasks of the agreement on achieving civic accord in 
Russia arise from the interests of the overwhelming proportion 
of the population. I would formulate them briefly as follows: 
  1. To ensure political stability by bringing into play the 
mechanisms of accord to be used permanently, in order to help 
resolve contradictions at early stages without them resulting in 
a confrontation, and in order to create in society and among the 
political elite an atmosphere of rejecting and denouncing 
extremism; 
  2. to form new political traditions and a new political 
culture; 
  3. to overcome the alienation of society from power by 
demonstrating real accord and the effectiveness and openness of 
politics; 
  4. to make the structures of civic society more active by 
involving them in discussing and tackling important problems; 
  5. to stimulate and speed up the adoption of laws 
necessary for extricating Russia from the economic crisis; 
  6. to create a favorable social atmosphere: A feeling of 
stability, confidence in power and an understanding of it. 
<H5>  What is Most Important in the Agreement </H5>
  The most important thing is that the agreement on achieving 
civic accord in Russia should set in motion a permanent 
mechanism of accord and maintain it. 
  For this it is proposed (in accordance with the existing 
text) to set up a conciliation commission from representatives 
of the parties. Its main function is to create and maintain the 
work of permanent round tables for the main directions: Social 
and economic policy, security, culture, national problems and so 
forth. 
  These round tables will analyze the situation, single out 
important specific problems and set up temporary working groups 
from representatives of the interested parties to discuss them 
and to elaborate recommendations. 
  The strength of such groups lies in the fact that the 
recommendations drawn up by them will emphasize key 
contradictions at an early stage and will find agreed ways of 
solving them precisely because it is easier to come to an 
agreement on specific issues. 
  I am sure that this agreement will be achieved if we can 
maintain such conciliatory procedures for specific problems and 
make use of their results. 
<H5>  Completing Work on the Text of the Agreement </H5>
  To complete work on the text of the agreement it is proposed 
to set up a working group, which would include two 
representatives from the following parties: - the Russian 
president, the Federation Council, the State Duma, the Russian 
Government, the Public Chamber, religious organizations, trade 
unions, associations of entrepreneurs and industrialists, 
creative associations. 
  I should regard it as useful to adopt a procedure whereby 
each of the parties could veto the inclusion of any of the 
proposed candidates in the group. This would enable a 
composition to be achieved that could work smoothly and make 
decisions by consensus. In that case, the text of an agreement 
that had had the finishing touches applied to it by the group 
could be signed without any further discussion. 
  The text of the current draft agreement as published in the 
press should be discussed, and recommendations, proposals and 
amendments should be drawn up and then sent to the president's 
administration for forwarding to the working group that is now 
operating. 
  Then, one day in the second half of April, a further working 
conference can be convened, attended by representatives of the 
above-mentioned parties to the agreement and leaders of 
parliamentary groups in the State Duma. The purpose of such a 
conference is to endorse the composition of the group working on 
the text and (to endorse) the signing procedure. 
  After this meeting, the newly formed group will be given no 
more than seven days to complete its work on the text, so that 
the signing may take place on 28 April. 
<H5>  Signing of the Agreement </H5>
  I imagine that the parties from the above-mentioned list 
must 
decide for themselves which of them will be delegated for the 
ceremonial signing of the text of the agreement. I daresay 
there may be proposals to broaden the group of signatories by 
means of regional or wider political representation (this may be 
a topic for discussion at the next conference). 
  The delegations of the parties sign the text of the 
agreement. It is then published with an appeal by the parties to 
accede to the agreement. Following publication of the text, the 
body set up in accordance with the adopted agreement (in the 
current text, that is the Conciliation Commission) is given the 
powers to organize an open signing of the agreement. This may, 
for example, take the form of decisions to accede to the 
agreement adopted and sent in by various organizations. A list 
of such organizations may be published regularly in the 
newspapers by the Conciliation Commission. 
  I am sincerely confident that the agreement on achieving 
civic accord in Russia is both possible and necessary today for 
all of us -- the politicians and citizens of Russia. The 
agreement will demonstrate that our new political system is 
strengthening and maturing, that we are becoming stronger and 
more responsible and that political ambitions and speculative 
interests are taking hold of us less frequently. 
  But the process of completing, adopting and implementing the 
agreement can easily be wrecked; mutual mistrust and the 
tendency to achieve victories at the expense of one's opponent 
and not together with him is still great. We must never forget 
this if we sincerely believe in our desire for accord and civic 
peace in Russia.

  [Text] As a top Black Sea Navy officer has reported to 
INTERFAX, tension is mounting in the Crimea. 
  He linked this primarily to the Crimean President Yuriy 
Meshkov's current unofficial visit to Cyprus, where he has been 
kept from returning. As he explained, the presidential plane 
cannot leave Cyprus because the Turkish authorities have not 
given permission for its flight over their air space. The most 
likely reason for their refusal is that the flight has been 
requested later than is stipulated by Turkish legislation. 
  As a spokesman for Meshkov's administration has reported, 
presidential aides in Simferopol have asked Russia's Foreign 
Ministry to help settle the affair. 
  "Meshkov's plane was registered in Ukraine. This means that 
no one but the Ukrainian authorities should interfere," a senior 
Russian Foreign Ministry official explained. The authorities 
could easily do so since the Ukrainian Embassy in Ankara has 
been functioning for two years now, he added. 
  Meanwhile, Ukraine's Defence Minister Vitaliy Radetskiy, 
accompanied by a unit of national guards, arrived in Simferopol 
without any preliminary agreement with the presidential 
administration. Some other Ukrainian generals are now in the 
Crimean capital. Among them -- a deputy chief of staff and 
senior security and intelligence officers. 
  The Chief of the Ukrainian Air Force Headquarters Anatoliy 
Lopata is in Sevastopol for inspection. The Ukrainian 
President's Military Adviser Vladimir Petenko is also in the 
Crimean port.

  [Text] Moscow April 6 TASS -- Russian Premier Viktor 
Chernomyrdin and a delegation of U.S. congressmen discussed a 
broad range of issues of Russian-American relations at a meeting 
on Wednesday, above all in the economic sphere. 
  Valeriy Grishin, deputy head of the Russian Government's 
press service, told journalists after the meeting that 
congressmen expressed support for reforms conducted by the 
present Russian Government. 
  The sides also discussed how to settle the conflict in 
former 
Yugoslavia and the participation of Russia and the United States 
in peace efforts. 
  Congressmen expressed satisfaction with rates of economic 
reforms in Russia. For instance, Republican minority leader 
Robert Michael said that he plans to make a statement, after his 
return to the U.S., on the need for more active participation of 
U.S. businessmen in Russian investment projects. 
  Chernomyrdin said during the discussion of the recent 
decision by the International Monetary Fund to appropriate the 
second part of the systematic credit to Russia that the Russian 
Government did not and does not bank on western aid and intends 
to earn money on the world market on its own. 
  In this connection, the premier pointed to the need for 
lifting unjustified Western restrictions containing Russia's 
access to world markets.

  [Text] Moscow April 5 TASS -- "Deputies of the State Duma 
are thoroughly analyzing the draft agreement on civic peace in 
Russia and think it can be concluded," Duma speaker Ivan Rybkin 
told today a visiting U.S. Congress delegation headed by 
Congress democratic majority leader Richard Gephardt. 
  Despite press reports claiming the Duma's unwillingness to 
consider the "intermediate document", the upgraded draft was 
submitted to the Duma by presidential structures on April 4 and 
has been analyzed by committees, commissions, factions and 
deputy groups, head of the duma press service Viktor Cheremukhin 
told ITAR- TASS. 
  In his words, the U.S. congressmen were inspired by Rybkin's 
words that the civic peace agreement will be concluded by 
representatives of the three power branches and party leaders 
and remain open to all political forces of society.

  [Text] Moscow, 5 Apr -- "Because of the unacceptability of 
certain points," deputies of the Federation Council rejected 
today a federal law adopted by the State Duma "On Financing 
Federal Budget Spending in the Second Quarter of 1994." 
  In accordance with the Russian Federation Constitution, in 
this situation, chambers "can set up a conciliatory commission 
in order to overcome the differences." Deputies have instructed 
the budget committee to start negotiations with the State Duma 
regarding forming such a commission and preparing a new version 
of the two points of the law, which the Federation Council has 
rejected. 
  This decision was made five minutes before the lunch break 
in 
the chamber's day session. Sergey Aleksashenko, deputy finance 
minister, informed deputies that because there was no federal 
law on financing in the second quarter, the ministry will stop 
"as of tomorrow morning all financing operations, starting with 
the salary of the Russian Federation president." He explained 
that the Finance Ministry needs a law entitling it to spend 
money. However, there was no reaction from deputies rushing out 
for lunch.

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, April 7 (ITAR-TASS) -- Under the headline 
"To Achieve Civil Accord in Russia", the ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI 
newspaper features the full draft of the appropriate agreement 
(version 1) of last March 27. 
  The newspaper also singles out a decision by President Boris 
Yeltsin on setting up Russian military bases in the countries of 
the Commonwealth of Independent States as well as in Latvia to 
ensure security of the Russian Federation and the above states 
as well as to test new weapons and combat materiel. 
  Deputy Director of the Institute of Europe Sergey Karaganov, 
D.Sc. (History), describes in an interview with the same 
newspaper President Yeltsin's programme of a Spanish visit which 
will start on April 11. It will be the first official visit by 
a Russian president to Spain. 
  According to Karaganov, the forthcoming talks in Madrid "can 
be described as a timely step of the two sides towards each 
other against the background of the latest trend of West 
European countries' certain aloofness from Russia". 
  This aloofness, he continues, was caused above all by 
dissatisfaction of many European states with the solution of 
their general domestic problems. The deputy director expresses 
confidence that the visit will yield positive results for the 
two countries in the political, economic and cultural spheres. 
  Under the title "Black Sea Fleet is a Political Notion Now", 
the KRASNAYA ZVEZDA newspaper carries an interview with the 
fleet commander, Admiral Eduard Baltin. 
  Noting that "Russia and Ukraine should equally appropriate 
funds" for the needs of the Black Sea Fleet in compliance with 
the Yalta agreement, the admiral states that "Russia has been 
virtually fully maintaining the fleet since the end of 1993". 
  The admiral stresses that "the two sides should take into 
account, above all, military need and economic expediency" while 
shaping up their relations with regard to the Black Sea Fleet. 
"In that case, relations will be good-neighbourly," Baltin adds. 
  The same newspaper runs a statement by Commander of Russian 
Border Troops Andrey Nikolayev to ITAR-TASS which is entitled 
"Russia will not put up with pillage". The newspaper writes 
that the press reports all the time about violations of Russian 
territorial waters by Japanese fishing vessels for illegal 
fishing. 
  In this connection, a decision was taken to launch a special 
operation on the eve of the fishing season to stop illegal 
fishing by foreign ships in the Pacific region, starting from 
April 20. It will be carried out gradually till next October. 
  Today's Moscow press singles out reports on the Komsomolets 
nuclear-powered submarine which sank in the Norwegian Sea as a 
result of a fire five years ago. It carried, apart from the 
nucler reactor, two torpedoes with nuclear warheads. 
  The tragedy tolled 42 lives. In this connection, the 
NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA newspaper, taking into account that the 
komsomolets was not decontaminated due to incompetence of people 
responsible for this case, calls on Russian authorities to take 
urgent measures to prevent a possible radiation disaster in the 
region of the submarine's wreckage. 
  The same newspaper runs information that the upper chamber 
of 
the Russian parliament did not accept on Wednesday the 
resignation of former Russian Prosecutor-General Aleksey 
Kazannik. 
  Byacheslav Nikonov, chairman of the lower house subcommittee 
on international security and arms control, examines in 
NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA a decision by Russian authorities to join 
NATO's programme "partnership for peace". 
  He notes that the existence of the programme does not depend 
on Russia's decisions. The programme will operate. "We could 
influence its implementation by participating in the programme. 
  "by obstaining from the programme, Russia would lose every 
chance to participate and will gain nothing, apart from 
glamorous self- isolation from the rest of Europe," Nikonov 
notes. 
  The TRUD newspaper describes "a veritable war against spring 
elements of nature" and the emergency situations which have 
developed in European Russia as well as in Siberia and the Far 
East. 
  Over 200,000 hectares of land are now flooded, the newspaper 
writes. "When do we learn lessons, at long last, from this war?" 
the newspaper asks.

<F P=106> [Report by Omar Uzarashvili: "Lvov Mayoralty Will Cooperate </F>
With U.S. Government"] 
  [Text] Vasyl Shpitser, chairman of the Lvov City 
Administration, and Emmy Osborn, first secretary of the U.S. 
International Development Agency [IDA], have signed a memorandum 
on mutual understanding between the agency and the Lvov City 
Administration. As Vasyl Shpitser noted, the mayoralty has 
reached a new level of cooperation and assistance to the city. 
Since IDA is subordinated directly to the U.S. Government, it 
can be said that the Lvov Administration has begun cooperation 
with the U.S. Administration. 
  Cooperation with the Lvov Administration will proceed 
according to a drafted program. The project "Municipal Finances 
and Management" is to be implemented first. As project director 
Eric Chatwind stated, the project includes several programs. 
The agency's permanent adviser is to arrive in Lvov, and will 
assist the Lvov Administration for two years. Moreover, also 
expected are advisers on specific issues who will arrive during 
the implementation of the project. Lvov specialists will attend 
special courses in the United States, and scientific seminars 
will be held in Lvov. In the near future, the U.S. side will 
grant to the Lvov Administration $2 million to purchase 
computers and other equipment necessary to ensure regular 
operation of the mayoralty. Additionally, the agency will help 
the Lvov Mayoralty to receive a considerable 17-year loan from 
the World Bank, which will be used for municipal needs. I 
promise the mayor that we will bring with us all the knowledge 
in municipal management that exists in the United States, and 
that we will share this knowledge with you, Eric Chatwind 
pledged. 
  Lvov has won the right to implement the U.S. project in a 
tough competition among such cities as Kiev, Odessa, Mykolayiv, 
or Ternopil.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Ukrainian Deputy Foreign Minister </F>
Oleksandr Makarenko by Yuliya Mostovaya; place and date not 
given: "Reforms, Reforms, and Once Again Reforms"] 
  [Text] Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko initialed 
an agreement "On Partnership and Cooperation With the European 
Union [EU]" in Brussels today. Ukraine thereby became the first 
CIS state to initial this document with the EU. 
  What we have managed to do so far, said Deputy Foreign 
Minister Oleksandr Danilovich Makarenko after returning from 
Brussels, even according to their estimates, represents a 
revolutionary breakthrough. The point is that formally this is 
an agreement "On Partnership and Cooperation With the EU," while 
in essence this is an agreement on associate membership in the 
EU. Similar agreements have been signed with Poland, Hungary, 
the Czech Republic, and Slovakia. The difference between our 
agreement and their's is that their negotiations on setting up a 
free-trade zone with the EU will be finished in eight years, 
while similar negotiations with Ukraine will begin on 31 
December 1998. 
  Nevertheless, according to Oleksandr Danilovich, all 
quantitative and qualitative restrictions on trade between 
Ukraine and the EU have been lifted. Though there are some 
exceptions on a group of goods including textiles, metals, and 
nuclear material. These restrictions will be valid until 31 
December 1998, and they will later be rescinded. It is up to us 
how far we should be able to move forward in signing separate 
accords. Negotiations on agreements for textiles and metals are 
approaching their conclusion, and we believe that we will 
conclude them in the immediate future. 
  [Mostovaya] However, Oleksandr Danilovich, the export of 
metals is of a priority for Ukraine.... 
  [Makarenko] You are right. However, Europe has never been a 
priority market for selling our metal. There are other markets 
in the world, and they are rather vast. I refer of course to 
the states of Southeast Asia, where we could export 3-4 million 
tonnes of steel a year. [end Makarenko] 
  Next, Oleksandr Danilovich said that the document was 
initialed after four rounds of talks, the first of which was 
held in March of last year and the last one -- in March of this 
year. Russia has already held eight rounds of talks, but the 
text of the agreement is not yet ready. At the same time, we 
have managed to enlarge the scope of our mandate. Moreover, the 
preamble states that the EU supports the sovereignty and 
territorial integrity of Ukraine because this will promote 
stability in both Central and East Europe, and on the continent 
in general. This represents very valuable and timely political 
support from the states of West Europe. By the way, the clause 
on political consultations between the EU and Ukraine has been 
considerably expanded. All disagreements over mutual 
cooperation in transportation and sea navigation have been 
surmounted. 
  It is impossible to overestimate the importance of 
initialing 
this document, said O. Makarenko. We managed to refute the 
viewpoint of those who were skeptical about cooperation with the 
EU, as well as Europe's interest in cooperating with us. We 
have many such people, including those at the top. The fact 
that this agreement was initialed in its present form gives us 
the answer to the question: Where should Ukraine move? Toward 
our past in the East, or our future in the West? We are facing 
a choice: Either to speed up reforms and take advantage of the 
West's proposal, which opened its doors to us, or forget about 
this agreement, put it aside, face the East and move eastward. 
In my opinion, there are strategical and tactical issues that 
cannot be confused. From a strategical point of view, Ukraine 
is by all means a European state. Therefore, according to the 
Rome Declaration, it has every reason to unite with free and 
democratic Europe. We understand that this is a lengthy and 
difficult path, but we have to do it. When Franco died in 
Spain, nobody thought that Spain would ever become an EU 
member.... From the viewpoint of tactics and the survival of 
our state, we should restore economic relations with Russia. 
However, our goal should be staunch. 
  [Mostovaya] Do you think that Ukraine -- stemming from 
tactical considerations -- should sign the CIS economic pact? 
  [Makarenko] I participated in every round of negotiations on 
this issue. The Foreign Ministry and I are convinced that 
Ukraine should become an associate CIS member, because full 
membership would delay our EU membership. 
  [Mostovaya] Well, in general, can Russia let Ukraine out of 
its sphere of influence? 
  [Makarenko] Everything depends on how strong willed we are, 
on how a new government will be committed to our sovereignty and 
independence. We should think about this already today, on the 
eve of Supreme Council elections, because a voter should decide 
with what he is concerned: Either go forward toward Europe or 
backward toward the empire.

should be pleased with the results of the negotiations. At this

  [Text] [No dateline as received] -- Deputies of the 
Georgian Parliament resumed today their examination of the 
package of Georgian-Abkhaz documents signed in Moscow. The 
session of the country's supreme legislative body was held in an 
atmosphere of heated debate and demonstrated radically different 
approaches to this problem. 
  A number of members of opposition parties and factions gave 
a 
sharply negative assessment of the latest Georgian-Abkhaz 
document, putting emphasis on a clause relating to the 
restricted return of the refugees to their original places of 
residence, which is conditional on their nonparticipation in 
hostilities and nonmembership of military formations ready to 
enter the territory of Abkhazia. 
  In the opinion of the opposition, this, being a disguised 
method of "filtering out" the deported people, is incompatible 
with the Georgian side's position. Some radically-minded 
parliamentarians even raised the issue of no confidence in the 
Georgian head of state and his personal representative at the 
Moscow talks, Aleksandr Kavsadze, who had signed the 
controversial package of documents on behalf of Georgia. 
  A large proportion of members of the parliamentary majority 
welcomed the signing of the Georgian-Abkhaz quadrilateral 
agreement. They believe that this step was necessary in the 
current situation. They see it as the only chance to allow the 
return of the refugees to their homeland and to influence the UN 
Security Council to take a decision to deploy peacekeeping 
forces in the conflict zone.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature no. 66 (556) </F>
compiled by Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy and edited by 
Vladimir Shishlin] 
  [Text] On Wednesday the Georgian parliament continued the 
discussion of the documents on a settlement in Abkhazia signed 
in Moscow last Monday. On Tuesday the debate produced no 
results. 
  According to a correspondent for Interfax, the opposition 
working against the Moscow agreements failed to make 
constructive proposals that would offer an alternative to the 
agreements. Boris Kakubava even tried to raise the question of 
confidence in the head of state Eduard Shevardnadze. However, 
the proposal did not win support from the majority. 
  The chairman of the provisional committee for the state of 
emergency Jaba Ioseliani asked the opposition: "What do you 
want then? If you want war, say that openly, but it you want 
peace, it should be approached step by step, for instance 
through such documents as those signed in Moscow." 
  Shevarndnadze's personal representative Aleksandr Kavsadze 
thinks that the Georgian-Abkhaz agreement signed in Moscow on 
the return of refugees and displaced persons is going to become 
a foundation for resolving the main question: the sending of a 
UN peace-keeping force to Abkhazia. According to him, the two 
sides agreed on further steps to continue settling the conflict 
by political means. On Friday Sochi will host the first session 
of the four-sided commission (Georgia, Abkhazia, Russia and the 
UN) for the return of refugees. The session is expected to 
continue in Geneva on April 12. The final decision should be 
made then on the sending of a peace-keeping force. On April 19 
in Geneva the status of Abkhazia should be discussed by 
international experts and lawyers. 
  In the opinion of the head of the Abkhazian parliament 
Vladislav Ardzinba, the Moscow accords open up prospects of a 
peace settlement. He thinks that the main thing now is the 
observation of the agreements by all the sides. In an interview 
with Interfax he said Abkhazia would observe the agreements. 
  He is convinced that with an unstable situation in Georgia 
only the deployment of a peace-keeping force on the dividing 
line between Abkhazia and Georgia can guarantee peace. 
  Meanwhile, the head of the Georgian security force Igor 
Georgadze has told a news conference in Tbilisi that there are 
no hostilities at the moment in Abkhazia. However, he could not 
say whether this can be accounted to the Moscow accords. 
  He did not rule out the possibility that the recent acts of 
terrorism in Tbilisi were related to the war between criminal 
clans that amassed fortunes on the hostilities in Abkhazia. 
According to the security chief, the investigation of all the 
cases will be completed in the nearest future. Georgadze said 
security forces have proofs of links between high-ranking 
officials who were in charge of the military policy in Abkhazia 
with the looters who operated there. He said all the ties are 
being investigated. 
  Answering a question from Interfax whether Georgia is 
conducting intelligence activities in other countries Georgadze 
said: "He have our hands full with our own problems in this 
country."

<F P=106> ["Statement by the Republic of Georgia State Committee for </F>
the Investigation Into and Publication of Materials Regarding 
the Policy of Genocide and Ethnic Cleansing Conducted Against 
the Georgian Population in Abkhazia and the Presentation of Such 
Materials to the International Tribunal on 15 February 1994"; 
place and date not given] 
  [Text] For one and a half years, the Abkhazian region has 
represented a region in which the most tragic events of the end 
of the 20th century have been taking place. 
  Fascist-minded separatists, who have encroached upon the 
territorial integrity of Georgia, have provoked an armed 
conflict that has been maintained to a significant degree by 
external forces. Having temporarily achieved a military victory 
in the region, the separatists set about conducting operations 
aimed at the elimination of the Georgian population in Abkhazia, 
while violating the elementary norms of international 
humanitarian law and carrying out the practice of genocide and 
ethnic cleansing. World opinion, however, has not given a 
proper assessment of these facts. 
  A special state committee was established and entrusted with 
gathering materials testifying to the fact that the policy of 
genocide and ethnic cleansing is continuing to be implemented. 
  The process of gathering facts has already begun. This 
special investigative body attached to the General Procurator's 
Office, which is now conducting a criminal investigation into 
facts of genocide and ethnic cleansing against the Georgian 
population in Abkhazia, has carried out a huge amount of work. 
The materials that have been collected contain proof that 
genocide against the Georgian population carried out by 
Abkhazian separatists and their associates was planned in 
advance. 
  There exists convincing evidence of a deal between the 
organizers and perpetrators of these heinous crimes and their 
accomplices, whose ultimate aims are violation of the 
territorial integrity of the Republic of Georgia and the 
elimination of thousands of innocent people who have been 
condemned to this terrible fate only because they are Georgian 
by nationality. 
  In spite of convincing evidence to the contrary, certain 
sides are stubbornly continuing to deny that genocide is taking 
place in Abkhazia and are vainly asserting that it is a question 
of the "usual cruelties of war." Such an assessment of this 
concrete phenomenon is nothing other than an attempt to deceive 
the world community. 
  There exists a multitude of evidence indicating that 
preparations for carrying out ethnic cleansing in Abkhazia had 
been going on for many years. The Abkhazian mass media, 
scientific journals, and other sources had been constantly 
accusing the Georgians of artificially reducing the size of the 
local Abkhazian population. It became all too obviously clear 
that the Georgian population was doomed to annihilation. 
However, who was to fill that huge vacuum formed as a result of 
the expulsion of a group of people numbering more than 200,000? 
The answer was received during the course of the conflict when 
Mr. V. Ardzinba [leader of the rebel Gudauta grouping] and his 
associates publicly proposed to the inhabitants of the North 
Caucasus and adjoining countries to the east that they join 
their side and fight against the Georgians, promising them as a 
reward "a place to live and citizenship." 
  As a result of this treacherous plan, hundreds of thousands 
of Georgians were banished from their homes and became the 
victims of indescribable physical and moral suffering and 
blatant outrages: Their homes and property were destroyed and 
their cattle and cars stolen. The treatment to which the 
Georgian population was subjected made it impossible for them to 
live any longer in Abkhazia as they were facing the threat of 
physical elimination. 
  The results of the current investigation will provide 
irrefutable evidence to all the interested parties that the 
ethnic cleansing conducted in Abkhazia was premeditated. 
  Almost immediately after the fall of Sukhumi on 27 September 
1993, hostilities between the opposing sides ceased. However, 
the investigation has established that the extermination of 
noncombatants continued on a large scale even after the 
cessation of combat operations; it has proof of this. 
  There exists convincing evidence that cynical monstrous 
crimes are continuing to be committed against the peaceful 
population: A great many women have been raped and savagely 
tortured and there have been cases of women having their breasts 
cut off while still alive. Even these terrible facts would 
already be sufficient to press charges. However, one cannot 
refrain from saying that it has not only been women, but also 
children and teenagers who have become the victims of these 
atrocities. The nipples of victims collected by the 
perpetrators of these monstrous crimes in matchboxes are the 
terrible trophies of these heinous deeds. Greeks, Armenians, 
Russians, and people of other nationalities, along with 
Georgians, are raising their voices as testimony to these 
actions and I am making a statement with full responsibility 
regarding these facts. 
  In order that the world has a clearer idea of the aims of 
the 
Abkhazian fascists and has a true picture of the tragedy brought 
about by their actions, it is necessary, as a matter of urgency, 
to direct the attention of international organizations to these 
facts in all their cruelty. 
  According to the testimony of witnesses, there have been 
many 
cases of innocent people who have been killed having the 
following inscription carved on their bodies: "Don't eat so 
much, Georgians. Don't get fat. It's difficult dragging your 
corpses." 
  It is impossible to read without a shudder the testimony of 
witnesses regarding the agony experienced by the Georgians who 
remained in Sukhumi after it was captured by Abkhazian 
separatists. 
  Listen to the fate of engineer Nugzar Dzhimsheleyshvili who 
worked in the Council of Ministers. His father Varlam 
Dzhimsheleyshvili was captured. His house was destroyed and his 
grandmother, Babutsa Pipiya, and mother-in-law, Mziya Kalandiya, 
were tortured and then killed. 
  Listen to the fate of the helpless L. B. (for 
understandable reasons, I am only using his initials) who was 
brutally murdered. One of his students buried him. This 
student, whose nationality was Russian, suffered the same fate 
simply because he had buried a dead person in the proper manner. 
  Listen to the fate of 60-year old V. Moniya who hid in his 
neighbors' house; he was found and killed. 
  It is beyond the scope of this document to relate the tragic 
fates of M. Mirtsklava, the married couple Kvaratskheliya, V. 
Argobliani, A. Gadeliya, T. Gegechkori, Yu. Kvartskheliya, D. 
Dgebuadze, S. Kakuberi, and T. Kakuberi-Gvakhariya. All of them 
were Georgians and neighbors on Tsereteli Street and, to their 
misfortune, remained in Sukhumi after its fall; no one now knows 
where they lie. 
  What about the fate of other Georgian residents of Sukhumi 
-- 
D. Darchemeliya, the Zakradze brothers, S. Karchava, Ye. and Z. 
Abramiya, F. Kalandiya, T. Shariya, V. Kvachakhiya, A. 
Kintsurashvili, D. Kopeliani, and M. Kvirchkhaya? 
  Behind each name is a person who, at the end of the 20th 
century, encountered the surge of fascism and who was shown no 
more mercy than the victims of fascism at all other times. 
  According to the testimony of witnesses gathered during the 
course of the investigation, official representatives of the 
Government of the Abkhazian Autonomous Republic became the 
victims of isolated and group murders. It should be emphasized 
that there are a great many such cases of which there is 
documentary proof. 
  Materials relating to the murder of Zhiuli Shartava, 
chairman 
of the Council of Ministers, and his aides are also relevant to 
the question under examination. The evidence gathered during 
the course of the investigation has enabled us to establish that 
Mr. Shartava and his aides were seized in Sukhumi and subjected 
to particularly cruel torture. A postmortem examination has 
revealed that, before being murdered, they were tortured in a 
monstrous way. 
  The murder of Shartava and many other senior employees in 
the 
apparatus of the Abkhazian Council of Ministers was sanctioned 
by the same group that provoked the armed uprising against the 
Georgian state and its citizens. 
  The policy of genocide and ethnic cleansing continued to be 
resolutely implemented even during the period when negotiations 
were proceeding in Geneva. Although the aim of these 
negotiations has been to find an acceptable peaceful settlement 
to the conflict, they have served only as a smoke screen for the 
Abkhazian side, hiding behind which they have continued to 
implement their barbarous policy. Instead of supporting the 
peace process, the Abkhazian side is continuing to create an 
atmosphere of fear in order to hinder the safe return of 
displaced persons and refugees to their homes. This is borne 
out by the events that took place quite recently in Gali rayon 
in Abkhazia. 
  On 2-3 February 1994, Abkhazian forces, supported by heavy 
artillery and tanks, launched an offensive against villages in 
Gali rayon. During the following 10 days, all buildings in 
Okumi, Mikhumi, Tsarche, Pirveli, Gali, Rechkhi, Tskhiri, 
Gumprishe, Konstitutsiya, Kokhora, and other villages were razed 
to the ground. According to information in our possession, the 
modern "Grad" artillery system was used and poisonous gas was 
used in the village of Gumurishi. More than 800 houses were 
destroyed and hundreds of people taken hostage. The killing and 
intimidation of the peaceful population forced people to abandon 
their villages and seek refuge in the mountains. Thousands of 
women, children, and elderly persons attempted to escape the 
terror: They fled along snow-blocked paths, leaving behind them 
mothers frozen to death along with their children and old men 
and women who were unable to endure the severe conditions 
created both by nature and man. More than 2,000 exhausted 
people managed to avoid death and find refuge in Zugdidi, 
Tsalenjikha, and other towns in western Georgia; many of them 
were taken to hospital suffering from frostbite. 
  We are witnesses to the implementation of the typical policy 
of ethnic cleansing that is one form of genocide. 
  It should be pointed out that the Gudauta separatists did 
not 
allow UN observers based in Sukhumi to visit the region where 
the repressions took place. 
  Are these brazen actions not an open challenge to the UN 
that 
is conducting peace-making efforts and even to the whole 
civilized world? 
  During the course of this investigation, the identity of 
those who, under the patronage of the Abkhazian separatists, are 
carrying out genocide against the peaceful population has been 
clearly established. The materials gathered testify to the fact 
that the tragedy in Abkhazia constitutes a crime against 
humanity. 
  [Signed] Committee Chairman Professor Levan Aleksidze 
This letter was distributed as an official document in the 
UN Security Council.

  [Text] The Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze told 
parliament in Tbilisi that the return of refugees and displaced 
persons to Abkhazia was the main point of the agreement signed 
in Moscow. If they return, Abkhazia will effectively stay 
within Georgia, he said. Even though the document was not ideal, 
Tbilisi had to compromise because there was no other way to win 
the lost war. 
  Shevardnadze said that unless the refugees returned, "a 
confederation with Abkhazia will remain a dream. Any 
opportunity to have the refugees return to Abkhazia should be 
seized. Without this there is no point in talking about 
Abkhazia's status or a political solution of this issue...They 
will not have another chance to return." 
  Following Shevardnadze's speech the opposition withdrew its 
proposal that the agreement should be denounced and that a vote 
of confidence in Shevardnadze be taken. Shevardnadze himself 
demanded that such a vote be taken once the government is 
approved. 
  The Georgian parliament will resume the debate on the 
government composition on April 7.

<F P=106> [Report by Boris Vinogradov: "Tajiks Sorting Each Other Out </F>
in Moscow"] 
  [Text] A UN-sponsored and Russian-brokered dialogue 
between two Tajik delegations began in Moscow 5 April. 
  The civil war in that country has been continuing for almost 
two years. Tajik society is split by not only political, but 
also clan enmity. Having sat them down around a table, the UN 
secretary general's personal representative, the Uruguayan 
Ramirez Piriz-Bollon, noted the historic significance of the 
moment and voiced the hope that they will quickly find mutual 
understanding. 
  Russian diplomats have succeeded for the first time in 
bringing the warring Tajiks together and giving them the 
opportunity to communicate. The two sides are not setting prior 
conditions, but it clear from statements made previously that 
the path to agreement will be difficult. 
  The head of the delegation from Dushanbe -- Tajikistan 
Minister of Labor and Employment Shukurjon Zuhurov -- suggests 
starting with the refugee problem, regarding it as the most 
pressing. 
  The oppositionists, who are headed by former kazikalon [as 
transliterated] (supreme spiritual judge) Hoji Akbar 
Turajonzoda, who is currently living in Tehran, have brought 
their own package of broader ideas. They are demanding the 
resignation of Emomili Rakhmonov, head of the parliament, the 
creation of a state council involving all political 
organizations, the formation of a coalition transitional 
government, and the introduction of UN peacemaking troops into 
Tajikistan. 
  Matters are further complicated by the fact that the Tajik 
opposition is not homogeneous in terms of its views and demands. 
It can be divided into three categories: democratic, 
pro-Islamic, and implacable. Turajonzoda himself admits that he 
cannot speak on behalf of absolutely everybody who disagrees 
with the current state of affairs and would like a change of 
political system in Tajikistan. A number of opposition leaders 
abroad claim a special role in the leadership and do not 
recognize the current delegation's authority. 
  Taking account of the "delicacy of the matter," none of the 
mediators will venture an assessment of the sides' positions or 
predictions. Piriz-Bollon pointed out that the first step 
toward reconciliation must be an agreement on a cease-fire on 
Tajikistan territory and the Tajik-Afghan border. Everybody is 
in agreement with this wish.

<F P=106> [Report by Anatol Awcharenka] </F>
  [Excerpts] The first half of Butrus-Ghali's second day in 
Belarus was devoted to Chernobyl problems. The UN secretary 
general and members of his delegation began their working day 
quite early. At 1000, they met with Deputy Prime Minister Ivan 
Kenik, chairman of the State Committee for Problems of 
Consequences of the Chernobyl Catastrophe. Different kinds of 
assistance rendered to Belarus by the world community were 
discussed. Both sides also spoke about the coordination of 
efforts to study and alleviate the radiological, medical, 
socioeconomic, ecological, and psychological consequences of the 
Chernobyl disaster. In my opinion, Mr. Butrus-Ghali very 
precisely pointed out that Chernobyl is a symbol of both 
international solidarity and security. 
  The secretary general was then received by Belarusian Prime 
Minister Vyachaslaw Kebich and Supreme Soviet Chairman Mecheslaw 
Hryb. International experts drafted projects for developing 
industries in the Chernobyl zone, and this issue was also 
discussed in the course of the meetings. Belarus requested that 
the United Nations allocate membership fees to finance those 
projects. [passage omitted] 
  Mr. Butrus-Ghali was startled by the fact that although the 
disaster had occurred on Ukraine's territory, 70 percent of the 
radioactive fallout affected Belarus. One in every five 
Belarusian citizens is suffering from the aftermath of the 
Chernobyl accident. Meanwhile, the corresponding figure in 
Ukraine is one in every 30 citizens.[passage omitted] 
  The secretary general underlined: Belarus will receive my 
support so that the issue of Chernobyl is not removed from the 
UN agenda.[passage omitted]

  [Text] The Slavic Assembly Belaya Rus wrote a letter to UN 
Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali who is staying in Minsk in 
which it expressed its concern over the fact that the UN is 
being transformed from a peacekeeping organization to a world 
judge and gendarme. It has become common for the UN to use a 
dual approach toward resolving international conflicts, the 
letter reads. The UN is becoming a conductor of wishes of a 
narrow group of states with the United States at the top. The 
Slavic Assembly demanded that violent interference in the life 
of the peoples of Yugoslavia be halted. The letter [passage 
indistinct] an aggression against Iraq and murder of Somalia 
citizens were initiated. [words indistinct] Military 
interference with the affairs of some states and indulgence to 
other states become key mechanisms of the UN activities.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 66: Compiled </F>
by Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy, edited by Vladimir 
Shishlin] 
  [Text] The CIS Executive Secretary Ivan Korotchenya said in 
an interview with INTERFAX on Wednesday that he has no intention 
of running for the presidential post in Belarus. Korotchenya 
explained his reluctance to ballot with the fact that "currently 
the most important for him is to focus attention on work in the 
executive secretariat." 
  "Undoubtedly, I am grateful to those who trust me as a 
potential head of state, but I am convinced that the most 
prepared man for this post among the candidates is the present 
Belarussian Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich," Korotchenya said. 
In his opinion, Kebich, "an experienced manager and predictable 
politician, pursuing the consecutive policy oriented to an 
economic union with Russia, has big chances to head the country." 
  Korotchenya said that tonight he leaves for Moscow to meet 
with Chairman of the Council of Heads of CIS States Boris 
Yeltsin. It is expected that the two men will specify the draft 
agenda of the Moscow summit scheduled for 15 April. Besides, 
Korotchenya plans to report to Yeltsin about the fulfillment of 
his order to prepare the Moscow summit of presidents of 
Azerbaijan, Armenia and Russia on the settlement on the Karabakh 
crisis. IF Note: As a member of the CIS Interparliamentary 
Assembly's peacekeeping group, Korotchenya visited Baku, 
Yerevan and Nagorno-Karabakh from 31 March to 2 April. In his 
words, "the leaders of both sides involved in the conflict 
agreed in principle" to discuss the document on ceasefire and to 
hold talks on the final settlement of the Karabakh problem. 
  The subject of peacekeeping efforts of the CIS 
parliamentarians was raised at a meeting between Korotchenya and 
UN Secretary-General Butrus-Ghali on Wednesday. Butrus-Ghali 
proposed to register the Commonwealth Charter in the UN 
Secretariat in the next few days. Ghali said that this will 
enable "all countries of the international community to learn 
better the principles, goals and tasks of the CIS, and its 
structure." Ghali linked the need for the registration with 
recent giving the observer status at the UN General Assembly to 
the CIS. 
  Commenting on the results of the talks, Korotchenya informed 
about the agreement "to establish stable business contacts 
between coordinating structures of the Commonwealth and the UN 
Secretariat." In Korotchenya's opinion, "Butrus-Ghali's 
proposals open good opportunities for studying and using the 
experience of the UN in the activities of the CIS."

  [Text] According to BELAPAN, in the office of Alyaksandr 
Lukashenka, chairman of the Supreme Soviet Provisional 
Anticorruption Commission, the door lock has been changed and 
the door itself sealed. This was done because the Belarusian 
leadership believes that the commission has fulfilled its task. 
Speaking at a conference of law enforcement agency chiefs, 
Supreme Soviet Chairman Mechyslaw Hryb, in particular, pointed 
out that the work of the commission had in fact been completed. 
However, Alyaksandr Lukashenka has a different opinion. 
Dmitriy Bulakhov, chairman of the Supreme Soviet Legislative 
Commission, voiced his concern in an interview with BELAPAN, 
saying that there can be attempts to stop financing the 
Anticorruption Commission, close its mouth, and hold activities. 
The only thing that the commission has so far managed to 
accomplish is Stanislaw Shushkevich's resignation from the post 
of Supreme Soviet chairman. The resignation was prompted by 
claims that Shushkevich had failed to pay several hundred rubles 
to the government's construction and repairs department.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS-KAZTAG] </F>
  [Text] Tokyo 7 April, TASS -- Kazakhstan stands for 
creating a unified economic space of all former Soviet republics 
in which, as "it is taking place in the European Community, the 
states would help each other, and our similar economies would 
carry out reforms jointly," Kazakh President Nursultan 
Nazarbayev, who is in Japan on an official visit, said on 
Thursday. 
  "I have already made a relevant proposal for creating the 
economic union, and now it largely depends on the leaders of the 
Commonwealth of Independent States," Nazarbayev said at a 
meeting in the federation of Japan's economic organisations, 
refferring to his idea of an Euro-Asian union. 
  He believes that the new structure can "help CIS states at 
least during modernization of their economies." Goods, which 
are produced now in the former Soviet Union, are competitive 
only on the domestic markets of CIS because of their low 
quality." 
  Nazarbayev pointed out that he had always stood for economic 
integration, and expanding of relations but not for their 
elimination, which finally led to the economic collapse in the 
former Soviet Union. "What the politicians made was like cutting 
off arms and legs from a living organism, lives of millions of 
people become worse," he said. 
  Two years ago, the creation of the Commonwealth of 
Independent States was essential to promote a relatively 
peaceful separation within the framework of the former Soviet 
Union, though some states failed to avoid victims, according to 
Nazarbayev.

  [Text] In accordance with the law of the Republic of 
Kazakhstan of 10 December 1993: On temporary delegation of 
powers to the president of the Republic of Kazakhstan and heads 
of local administration. With the aim of further developing 
livestock breeding in the private sector, providing it with 
forage reserve, and a network of procurement and processing 
plants, I decree: 
  1. To set the annual tax on agricultural livestock in 
private 
ownership irrespective of its age, on the basis [of the data] on 
1 December of the previous year amounting to:

  [Text] A new round of Moldovan-Russian negotiations 
regarding the status of the 14th [Russian] Army began yesterday 
in Chisinau. The talks were attended, in the status of invited 
party, by the representatives of the self-proclaimed Dniester 
Moldovan Republic. Our correspondent reports that the observers 
of the CSCE mission to the Republic of Moldova are not attending 
the negotiations. 
  According to a statement made by the leader of the Moldovan 
delegation, Anatol Taranu, the previous rounds resulted in the 
elaboration of a number of documents that could serve as a solid 
base for the establishment of the status of the 14th Army. 
  The positions of Moscow and Chisinau diverge regarding the 
deadline of the pullout of that army, Radio Moscow reports, 
adding that the Russian party considers that the pullout could 
be carried out solely after the Dniester region is granted a 
special status. According to the same source, the leadership of 
the secessionist [Dniester] republic fears that Moldova might 
eventually unite with Romania. 
  According to a report broadcast by Radio Moldova, the 
situation of the [Ilie] Ilascu group [imprisoned by the 
authorities of the Dniester republic] has become alarming. Ilie 
Ilascu has been put under an informational blockade, as he is 
not allowed to receive newspapers or possess a radio set, while 
his wife has been again denied access to the prison. According 
to the same source, the personal safety of the other four 
members of his group is endangered, as other detainees have 
access to their prison cells and they are assaulting them. The 
health condition of the entire Ilascu group is also precarious.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Cristian Nita from Chisinau] </F>
  [Text] The eighth round of Moldovan-Russian negotiations 
on the statute of the 14th [Russian] Army, and on ways and terms 
for this Army's withdrawal from the territory of the Republic of 
Moldova was concluded in Chisinau today. 
  This afternoon, the leaders of the two delegations held a 
news conference. I would like to mention that this is the first 
news conference since the beginning of negotiations between the 
Republic of Moldova and the Russian Federation on the issue of 
the 14th Army's withdrawal. 
  Summing up the results of this eighth round of negotiations, 
the leaders of the delegations, that is, Ambassadors Anatol 
Taranu and Vladimir Kitayev noted the importance of continuing 
negotiations and emphasized the constructive attitude of both 
sides toward finding optimal solutions regarding the terms of 
the 14th Army's withdrawal. The sides appreciated the presence 
in the negotiations of the representatives of the 
self-proclaimed Dniester Republic as a favorable element. The 
leaders of the two delegations announced that they have 
initialed the draft accords on granting judicial assistance on 
issues connected with the temporary stationing of the 14th Army 
on the territory of the Republic of Moldova as well as on 
granting social guarantees and pensions to former soldiers and 
members of their families. 
  Military experts signed a document drafted jointly on 
technical requirements for the withdrawal of the 14th Army and 
on the issue regarding the transportation of the military 
property of the Russian Federation from Moldova. 
  Unfortunately, the sides could not overcome disagreements 
regarding the terms for the withdrawal of the 14th Army. The 
sides presented new variations to Article No. 2 of the basic 
accord, which includes the withdrawal of the 14th Army and 
agreed to continue discussions on this issue during the ninth 
round of negotiations to be held in mid-May in Moscow. 
  In connection with the presence of the CSCE observers in 
these negotiations, Ambassador Vladimir Kitayev declared that 
Russia respects the activities of this international body, but 
since it has not been specified how the negotiations should be 
followed, the Russian side considers it reasonable to inform the 
CSCE at the end of each round of negotiations. 
  Ambassador Anatol Taranu stressed that on this issue the 
Republic of Moldova continues as before to express the opinion 
that the presence of the CSCE observers in the negotiation would 
make a constructive contribution to the unfolding of the 
respective negotiations. 
  Regarding the synchronization of the withdrawal of the 14th 
Army with the granting of a special legal status to Dniester, 
the Russian side continued to support this idea. The leader of 
the Moldovan delegation, however, expressed the view that if 
this condition were accepted, the negotiations would virtually 
have not made one single step forward. Therefore, it would be 
reasonable to reactivate the previous four-party mechanism to 
solve this problem.

Wednesday. After the end of the meeting Hasanov described the 
atmosphere at the talks as "excellent". "We discussed a whole

seeks in every way to develop relations with "fraternal Egypt", 
he added. 
  Hasanov conveyed to Husni Mubarak an invitation of Azeri 
President Heydar Aliyev to visit Baku. In his turn, the 
Egyptian president invited Aliyev to pay a visit to Egypt. 
  The sides agreed to continue consultations and the 
coordination of actions within the U.N. framework and the 
Islamic Conference. They discussed as well the problem of 
Azerbaijan's joining of the Non-Aligned Movement. 
  The Azeri foreign minister told Husni Mubarak about the 
latest developments connected with the Armenian-Azeri conflict 
and about the efforts, exerted for settling it. He urged all 
Arab countries to support his country in the sphere of the

<F P=106> [Report by Sokhbet Mamedov of IZVESTIYA: "Azerbaijan </F>
Opposed to Creation of Russian Military Bases on Its Territory"] 
  [Text] Baku -- The statements by certain Russian generals 
that they "are planning to site a military base in Azerbaijan" 
and Moscow's obvious desire to send its peacemaking forces into 
the Karabakh conflict zone have evoked an extremely negative 
reaction in the republic. 
  Many Azerbaijanis say that "the republic's authorities are 
unable to withstand the tough pressure from the Russian generals 
and have been forced to agree in principle to the fulfillment of 
their demands." 
  Azerbaijan today is the only CIS republic with no Russian 
troops on its territory, aside from the small number of 
specialists serving the Gabalinskaya radar station. 
  The last Russian Army units peacefully and freely left 
Azerbaijan in early 1993. This event, which took place during 
the presidency of Abulfaz Elchibey, is regarded by his People's 
Front comrades in arms as one of their main achievements. How 
did they succeed in reaching agreement with Moscow? This is 
still a mystery to many people. At the same time most observers 
note some inconsistency on the part of the Russian leadership. 
Having completed the hasty redeployment of its troops from 
Azerbaijan to the North Caucasus a year ago, today Moscow is 
seeking opportunities to bring them back. 
  "Officially Russia has made no such proposal to us," Gasan 
Gasanov, head of the republic's foreign policy department, told 
IZVESTIYA. President Heydar Aliyev was also categorical about 
this: "So long as I am head of Azerbaijan, there will be no 
foreign bases on the republic's territory." 
  The situation with regard to peacemaking forces is rather 
different. Russia, so an informed source from the republic's 
Foreign Ministry told IZVESTIYA, is pressing for exclusively its 
own military subunits to take part in the process of settling 
the conflict in the mountain part of Karabakh under the auspices 
of international organizations. But Azerbaijan, displaying 
natural caution, is proposing that a mixed contingent of CSCE or 
UN peacemaking forces be stationed along the entire 
Armenian-Azerbaijani border. While politicians are seeking 
mutually acceptable solutions, opposition forces in the republic 
have intimated that they will not tolerate the return of Russian 
soldiers to Azerbaijan in any form. "The very fact that this 
issue has been raised is fraught with great danger to the 
republic's sovereignty and independence," the People's Front has 
stated. The "Musavat" party, headed by Isa Gambar, former 
speaker in the republic's parliament, holds a similar view. 
"Moreover," Etibar Mamedov, leader of the National Independence 
Party, the most influential opposition party, stressed in 
conversation with your IZVESTIYA correspondent, "I would not 
envy the republic leader who ventured to take the responsibility 
of turning Azerbaijan into a military test range for any foreign 
state. He would be bound to be held in general contempt."

  [Text] Russia continues to set new additional conditions on 
Estonia for a troop withdrawal. This is stated in an Estonian 
Foreign Ministry statement disseminated in Moscow today. 
  During the 18th round of Estonian-Russian interstate talks, 
which began yesterday in Moscow, the Russian side set a 
condition that Estonia should amend its legislation to enable 
all retired servicemen to qualify for residence permits, 
regardless of [words indistinct] they have lived in Estonia. 
[Words indistinct] to pay the $23 million as compensation 
toward the building of housing for the withdrawing servicemen on 
active service. 
  The Estonian Foreign Ministry is puzzled by the Russian 
statement (?that it is unaware of international support given to 
Estonia). 
  The Estonian side hopes that the negotiations today will be 
more constructive than they were yesterday and that Russia is 
prepared to hold talks over issues which are not in conflict 
with the existing Estonian legislation.

<F P=106> ["News Release"] </F>
  [Text] On Wednesday [6 April], Russia removed the clause in 
the draft Russian-Estonian troop withdrawal agreement obligating 
Russia to pull its troops out of Estonia by 31 August 1994, 
saying the final date would reappear in the draft agreement if 
Estonia altered its legislation on military retirees, Estonian 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed ETA. In essence this move, 
which came on the second and final day of the 18th round of 
bilateral negotiations, in Moscow, set talks back to last 
August, before Russia had proposed a final withdrawal date, the 
Ministry says in its statement. 
  After last month's round when Russia announced that the 
already agreed upon final withdrawal date of 31 August 1994 was 
"no longer current", numerous states and international 
organizations, including NATO, the European Union, the CSCE, the 
Nordic prime ministers and the United States, publicly expressed 
their support for the Estonian position and urged the Russian 
Federation to keep the final date. In the wake of this 
overwhelming support for Estonia, top Russian Federation 
leaders, including Defence Minister Pavel Grachev and Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev, reiterated that 31 August 1994 was 
still in force. 
  On this background Estonia came to the current round of 
talks 
in good faith expecting to initial the withdrawal agreement 
which was ready to be initialed in last round, the Ministry 
states. "However, by continuing to link troop withdrawal to 
additional and irrelevant conditions today, Russia clearly 
signalled that it did not in fact intend to keep the final 
withdrawal date," the statement stresses. 
  According to the Estonian Foreign Ministry, Russia linked 
the 
final withdrawal to two additional conditions. First, Russia 
heightened demands on demobilized former Soviet military 
officers, insisting that "Estonia deem all its relevant 
legislation null and void," the Ministry says. Second, despite 
numerous offers of Western aid, the Russian side called on 
Estonia to pay the Government of Russia 23 million U.S. dollars 
directly. 
  In addition, the manner and tone of the Russian side 
suggests 
that Russia has hardened its position, the Ministry states. For 
the duration of the round, Russia "presented its positions in a 
more or less ultimatum style", introducing its own proposals as 
"non-negotiable", the statement goes on. For instance the 
Russian side told the Estonian side outright that the final date 
would reappear in the draft withdrawal agreement as soon as 
Estonia agreed to alter its legislation on military retirees. 
  Progress in the three remaining baskets of 
negotiations-economic, border and humanitarian 
questions-remained stalemated as the Russian side waited for 
progress in the military group, the Ministry informs. 
  This round marked the second anniversary of Russian-Estonian 
negotiations. The Estonian side remains hopeful that during the 
next round, proposed by Estonia for next May in Tallinn, Russia 
will bring a more constructive approach to the talks and will 
both signal its clear intention to pull out its troops as well 
as come to Tallinn prepared to negotiate practical solutions not 
contradictory to existing Estonian legislation, the statement of 
Estonian Foreign Ministry concludes.

  [Text] Brussels, April 7 TASS--Visiting Estonian Foreign 
Minister Juri Luik said at a press conference here on Wednesday 
that negotiations on the withdrawal of Russian troops from 
Estonia have reached a dead end "because of the Russian side's 
excessive demands". 
  The minister is in Brussels for talks on strengthening ties 
between Estonia and the European Union. He said the two sides 
are going to sign an agreement on Estonia's associated 
membership in the European Union in autumn of this year. An 
agreement on free trade between them can come into force from 
January 1, 1995. The minister said Estonia's ultimate aim was 
full membership of the European Union. 
  "We are ready, everything now depends on Brussels' 
decision," 
the minister said. ITAR-TASS learned from sources in the 
European Commission that the question about the further 
expansion of the European Union will be considered only in 1996. 
  While in Belgium, the Estonian minister held talks with 
officials of the West European Union. According to Minister 
Luik, he was assured that the Baltic countries would soon be 
able to establish closer ties with the WEU policy.

  [Text] Tallinn, Apr 06, BNS -- The Russian delegation at 
talks with Estonia today announced that Russia won't withdraw 
troops by Aug. 31, 1994, the Estonian Foreign Ministry says in a 
statement issued after the ending of the 18th round of 
negotiations between the two countries in Moscow today. 
  Russia officially withdrew the article in the draft agenda 
on 
troop withdrawal that set Aug. 31 as deadline for the pullout. 
  The Estonian Foreign Ministry says that because of Russia's 
position, the talks by now have fallen back to the situation 
that existed before last August when Russia first said it will 
pull out its forces by next Aug. 31. 
  Estonia's chief negotiator Vaino Reinart told reporters that 
Russia at the latest round of talks had set ultimative demands. 
Also the statement by the Estonian Foreign Ministry terms the 
"manner and tone" of the Russian delegation at the past round 
as ultimative. 
  "This gives proof of the positions of the Russian side 
having 
become more rigid," the statement reads. 
  The Aug. 31 deadline was first disputed by Russia's chief 
negotiator Vasily Svirin at the 17th round of the talks in 
March, when Svirin said the deadline was "no longer actual." In 
the latest step, the Russian delegation at the Moscow round on 
Tuesday [5 April] set a demand for Estonia to change its laws 
and give all retired Russian military living in the country 
permanent residence permits, regardless of whether their staying 
in Estonia in legal or not. Russia also again took up its 
earlier demand that Estonia must pay 23 million USD to build 
houses for the repatriated military in Russia. 
  Russian representatives today said their country was ready 
to 
withdraw troops if Estonia, as they put it, will resolve the 
issue of residence permits for the retired military and of 
ensuring their social security. 
  Both heads of delegations at a press conference today said 
the parties had failed to reach any "constructive cooperation" 
at this round of the talks. Russia's Vasily Svirin reminded 
that not a single draft document under discussion has been 
initialed during the four latest rounds of the talks. 
  The Estonian Foreign Ministry in its Tuesday's statement 
pointed out that a number of foreign countries and international 
bodies, including NATO, the European Union, CSCE, the Nordic 
prime ministers, and the United States, after the March round of 
Estonian- Russian talks publicly expressed their support for 
Estonia and suggested that Russia withdrew its troops by Aug. 
31 this year. 
  Reinart said Russia's demands to grant permanent residence 
permits to all its retired military in Estonia, a step that 
needs changing Estonian legislation, was in contradiction with 
resolutions by international organizations that press for a 
speedy, orderly and unconditional withdrawal of Russian troops 
from the Baltics. 
  The head of the Estonian delegation explained to BNS that a 
big number of the retired Russian military in Estonia were quite 
young and that many of them also had served in the Soviet 
military intelligence, KGB, or special task force units. 
Therefore, he said, some of the military pensioners are a 
jeopardy for Estonia's security. 
  His Russian counterpart quoted data at the press conference 
that only some 1,600 of the 10,000 retired Russian military in 
Estonia were under 50 years of age. 
  "The overwhelming majority of them simply want to live their 
lives to the end peacefully, and we are asking our Estonian 
partners -- let's provide them the possibility to do this," 
Svirin said. 
  Both heads of delegations said the countries despite 
everything had no plans to break off the talks. 
  Reinart told BNS Estonia had taken the issue of breaking off 
the talks "off from the agenda". The country after the 17th 
round considered suspending the negotiations or changing the 
set-up of its delegation. 
  At the same time Reinart added that Estonia continued to 
deliberate the possibility of calling in mediators. The head of 
the Russian delegation in his comments said his country was not 
opposed to the prospect of mediation by a third party, but added 
that in such a case the talks would no longer be bilateral. 
  The Estonian delegation proposed to convene for the next 
round of the talks in Tallinn in May, and expressed hope that 
Russia then would agree to discuss issues that are not in 
contradiction with Estonian legislation.

  [Text] The Estonian Foreign Ministry has voiced serious 
concern over the order issued by the Russian Federation 
president on 5 April of this year, on setting up Russian 
Federation military bases on the territory of CIS states and the 
Republic of Latvia, with the aim of both ensuring security in 
those states and testing military equipment. 
  Estonia shares the Latvian Government's concerns that the 
above order constitutes an immediate danger to the independence 
and security of a sovereign state. The Estonian Foreign 
Ministry finds that setting up military bases on the territory 
of one or another country is determined by the will of the 
people in that country, and not by any orders from the Russian 
leadership. This particular case is a dangerous example of the 
Russian foreign policy's great-power ambitions [words 
indistinct]. The Estonia Foreign Ministry holds the position 
that the relations between Russia and the Baltic states can 
develop only in the spirit of mutual respect, on the basis of 
international standards.

  [Text] Tallinn, Apr 06, BNS -- The men who shot a Russian 
border guard and wounded two on the Estonian-Russian border on 
Apr. 1 supposedly fled to Russia, said the head of the Estonian 
Border Guard Department, Tarmo Kouts. 
  But he added that this was only what the investigators say 
most likely happened, and that there were several other versions. 
  Kouts said the suspects had not been caught yet. Russian 
border guards say the shooters were two men who spoke Russian 
without foreign accent. 
  The incident happened when a Russian patrol unit of three 
about 3.50 stopped two men some 300 meters from the border with 
Estonia. The men opened fire from their TT pistols and fled 
when a patrol car called from the Russian cordon approached the 
site. One member of the Russian patrol was killed and two were 
taken to a hospital with serious bullet wounds. 
  Estonian Ambassador Juri Kahn was called in by the Foreign 
Ministry in Moscow the same day, where he received an appeal 
addressed to the Estonian law enforcement bodies to help find 
the criminals. Kahn said the Russian side had no doubts that 
the incident was of a criminal character. 
  Kahn said he had been made clear that the Russian Foreign 
Ministry leadership did not regard the incident as a provocation.

  [Text] Tallinn, Apr 06, BNS -- Estonia must step up its 
activity from present in the United Nations and try to push 
through a resolution that would declare it inadmissible to carry 
out wide-scale state supported programs aimed at changing the 
demographic situation in occupied and annexed territories, 
opposition politician Hardo Aasmae said. 
  After such a resolution is adopted, all accusations against 
Estonia concerning the country's law on aliens and citizenship 
law would have no more sense, Aasmae said in an interview. He 
said chances were high that such a resolution would be passed in 
the United Nations in a simple majority vote if Estonia's policy 
before that was active enough. 
  The opposition politician says Estonia must hurry with its 
efforts toward the adoption of the resolution, because the 
country will be left with one good argument less in support of 
its campaign after the Russian troops have left. 
  Aasmae predicted support for Estonia's move from a number of 
Islamic countries, who are interested in positively resolving 
the issue of the West Bank territories occupied by Israel. 
  "It is quite probable that support for us will also come 
from 
Japan, who has interest in resolving the problem of the annexed 
South Kurils, as well as from many countries who are interested 
in the unity of Cyprus. Also the overwhelming majority of 
European countries and the United States would find it difficult 
to vote against that resolution, since they have mostly always 
denounced occupation and annexation," Aasmae said.

  [Text] Estonia's parliament, the Riigikogu, on Wednesday 
[6 April] approved a law regulating the transit and export of 
strategic goods. 
  "Undoubtedly, this is of no special interest to Estonia -- I 
think that during next decades we are not planning to supply us 
with such weapons," Estonia's Environment Minister Andres Tarand 
said on commenting the new law. 
  The law, however, enables Russia or some other foreign 
country sell missiles or other weapons to other countries 
through Estonian ports, Tarand said. 
  The law initiated by Estonian government regulates export 
and 
transit of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, Tarand said 
while adding he did not approve transit of such environmentally 
hazardous materials. Such activities, however, provided 
international rules are observed might bring Estonia economic 
benefits.

  Joining Vienna and Paris conventions entitles Estonia also

  [Text] Tallinn, Apr 06, BNS -- Estonia must try to 
re-channel its farm exports from Russia to other countries as 
much as is possible, Agriculture Minister Jaan Leetsar said in 
his comments on a meeting of farm unions and producers 
associations, held on Tuesday [5 April]. 
  Russia has introduced imports tariffs on products from the 
Baltics, effective from Apr. 15, two times the level at which it 
tariffs goods from most other European countries. 
  Estonia's exporters should become organized and step up 
activity in the countries outside Russia's borders, as well as 
on Estonia's own domestic market, Leetsar said. 
  The Agriculture Ministry together with the Foreign Ministry 
are now trying to start negotiations with Russia on cutting down 
the tariffs to an equal level with other European countries, the 
minister said. 
  The meeting on Tuesday also discussed possible introduction 
of tariff barriers to protect the domestic market in Estonia, 
but since the market is not completely saturated with 
Estonian-made products and there is no political readiness for 
such a step, no move was made past discussion, he added.

  [Text] Ukrainian Defense Minister Vitalyy Radetskyy in a 
national radio interview on Wednesday said he would fly to 
Crimea on business whenever needed without asking for any local 
authorization. "Crimea is part of Ukraine and it is the 
Ukrainian Armed Forces but not the Black Sea Fleet [BSF] which 
is responsible for its defenses", he said. 
  The minister's statement follows yesterday's report saying 
that a group of senior military officials including Radetskyy 
would descend on Crimea without any prior arrangement with the 
regional administration or BSF command. 
  Radetskyy denied both the report and media speculations 
alleging that he and a group of senior Army officials had flown 
out to the peninsula to block local airports to prevent Crimean 
President Yuryy Meshkov's return from Cyprus. 
  The minister said no armed units had been sent to Crimea and 
that he himself had worked at his office in Kiev throughout 
Tuesday. 
  "Crimea is part of Ukraine, said Radetskyy, as defense 
minister, I am responsible for defenses of the state as a whole. 
That is why I do not have to ask for anyone's permission 
whether or not to fly to Crimea and what I must do there. I 
take orders from the commander in chief who approves plans for 
carrying out the tasks according to the country's defense 
doctrine." 
  In the meantime, a defense ministry spokesman told 
INTERFAX-Ukraine that Deputy Chief of Staff Gennadyy Gurin and 
his aides went on a scheduled trip to Crimea on Tuesday. Among 
other things, they visited the headquarters of the Ukrainian 
navy in Sevastopol. 
  For his part, deputy head of the ministry's press office 
Anatolyy Murakhovsky described as a blatant lie one report 
alleging that a Ukrainian commando unit had been sent to the 
Black Sea Fleet.

  [Text] Kiev, 6 April (AFP) -- Ukrainian special forces and 
senior military officers have arrived unexpectedly in Crimea 
while its separatist leader Yuryy Meshkov is abroad, officials 
in his office said on Wednesday. 
  About 3O men of the interior ministry special forces took up 
station on a warship after arriving here on Tuesday, ITAR-TASS 
news agency said. It said top generals from army intelligence, 
the air force, counter-espionage and the national guard had also 
come. 
  The return of Meshkov from a visit to Cyprus had been 
delayed 
for eight hours because Turkey had closed its airspace, the 
agency said, quoting a member of the crew on Meshkov's plane. 
  The Crimean chief's press attache Igor Azarov told AFP that 
a 
link between the delay of the flight home and the appearance of 
the Ukrainian special forces "cannot be ruled out." 
  Meshkov held a referendum last month at the same time as 
Ukraine's general election and won overwhelming backing for 
closer ties with Russia. Russians comprise 67 percent of the 
population in Crimea, which the then Soviet leadership 
transferred to Ukraine in 1954.

  [Text] [Announcer] According to a report by our 
correspondent in Simferopol, Yevgenyy Nurikov, Crimean President 
Yuryy Meshkov gave a statement on television on the evening of 6 
April addressed to the Republic's citizens. Among other things, 
he said: 
  [Begin Meshkov recording] We have all been notified that by 
decree of the president of Ukraine a presidential mission to the 
Crimean Republic has been set up in the Crimea. I am unable to 
see this step as anything other than a simple political 
provocation. [end recording] 
  [Announcer] Meshkov laid all responsibility for the possible 
consequences of this provocation on the highest leadership of 
Ukraine. The Crimean president expressed the hope that new 
politicians would come to power in Ukraine as a result of future 
presidential elections with whom the Crimean leadership would be 
able to hold a constructive dialogue. Yuryy Meshkov added that 
he did not intend to enter into contact with the Ukrainian 
president's representative, Valeryy Gorbatov, who had arrived in 
Simferopol. 
  Our correspondent, Ilya Kapelevich, managed to contact by 
telephone Crimean Deputy Prime Minister Yevgenyy Saburov in 
Simferopol: 
  [Begin recording] [Kapelevich] Please tell us what has 
happened and what the situation is now. 
  [Saburov] Ukraine has broken its own law. It has broken 
resolutions by the Supreme Soviet of the Crimea and has 
introduced the institution of governor general to the Crimea. 
The governor general has said he is going to deal with all of 
Crimea's external links, that his functions are political, that 
he is going to be the father of the people, and that he has been 
called on to lead our dim-witted [malorazumnyy], colonial people 
to a bright, communist future under the guidance of, so to 
speak, the Ukrainian leadership. The reaction in the Crimea to 
this, how should I say, joke of a step is extremely negative. 
  [Kapelevich] You met Leonid Kravchuk and you thought that it 
was quite a positive dialogue. Indeed, Leonid Kravchuk reacted 
positively after the personal meeting. Did he not warn you or 
notify you at all of his subsequent actions? 
  [Saburov] The conversation was, of course, quite serious and 
profound. Some of our economic proposals were given a positive 
reception straightaway, some with caution. On the whole, there 
was a lot of fear, I could see, but the conversation was fine. 
And then right after this new decree appeared. 
  [Kapelevich] What do you know about the deployment of five 
Ukrainian Navy warships, of an additional contingent of 
Ukrainian special forces? 
  [Saburov] All sorts of rumors are going around and I do not 
have any reliable information regarding whether Ukrainian 
soldiers have landed or have not landed. I do not know what the 
aim was if they did. Maybe just to stretch their legs or 
inspect something or other? The fact that they did all this 
when President Meshkov was away is probably just another 
coincidence -- or maybe it is not. On the whole, this manner of 
operating on the sly is quite widespread here, and although 
Ukraine is supposedly closer to Europe than Russia, scratch the 
surface and it is more like Asia. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS corrrespondent Lyudmila Perkina] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 6 Apr -- Crimean President Yuryy Meshkov has 
described recent events on the Crimean peninsula as a flagrant 
political provocation by the Ukrainian authorities and an 
attempt to carry out a coup. 
  In an exclusive interview to an ITAR-TASS correspondent, he 
said this evening that "the Ukrainian authorities intend to 
carry out a partial removal of the president of the Crimea, to 
restrict his powers, and reduce them to the level of a local 
administrative officer, thus abolishing the results of the 
Crimean presidential elections." 
  According to the Crimean president, this was done 
deliberately in his absence during a business trip to Cyprus, 
where Yuryy Meshkov had been dealing with matters of an economic 
nature. 
  [Moscow ITAR-TASS in English at 1715 GMT on 6 April carries 
a 
similar report, which adds the following at this point: "On 
Tuesday a large group of Ukrainian top military officials 
arrived in the Crimea, bringing in more than 500 special task 
force troops. The simultaneous arrival of ukrainian supreme 
military, security and interior officials accompanied by 
deploying additional special task forces in the Crimea has 
aggravated the situation in the peninsula. Some 30 servicemen of 
special units of the Ukrainian National guard and the Ukrainian 
interior Ministry arrived in Sevastopol on board the plane of 
the deputy head of the Ukrainian Armed forces General Staff. 
Another 500 special unit servicemen had been settled at a navy 
school in Sevastopol. The Black Sea Fleet Command announced it 
was ready to put the fleet on alert should a conflict break 
out."] 
  Yuryy Meshkov expressed gratitude to Russia for the fact 
that 
it had ensured the flight of his aircraft from Cyprus to the 
Crimea. Yuryy Meshkov believes that the flight from Nicosia to 
Simferopol was allowed only with the authority of the Ukrainian 
president and the Foreign Ministry. Such decisions, he noted, 
are made solely at the very highest level. As is known, the 
authorities in Turkey, through whose territory the presidential 
airliner had to fly, closed their airspace without giving any 
reason. 
  The Crimean president is convinced that "all of the efforts 
of the Ukrainian administration are designed to provoke general 
indignation, to wreck the second round of elections to the 
Crimean Supreme Soviet, scheduled for 10 April, and to prevent 
the victory of the "Russia" bloc, which includes the president, 
and for whom 80 percent of the people of the peninsula cast 
their vote." In his opinion, Kiev can see that the process of 
creating statehood in the Crimea is being completed, but it does 
not wish to build relations on new economic principles. 
  In the situation which has been created, Yuryy Meshkov 
stressed, it is also calculated that the Crimean president would 
take the events "badly" and adopt tough measures. "However, I 
am not going to do that. We will be tough, but within the 
framework of the constitution," Yuryy Meshkov stated. 
  To a question what his reaction was to Leonid Kravchuk's 
decree appointing the Ukrainian president's representative in 
Crimea, Yuryy Meshkov said: "The people are indignant. It could 
ignite the situation in Crimea, and it is a dangerous situation 
with unpredictable consequences. This representative is a 
foreign body. We will not have contacts with him." 
  The Crimean president sees his main task as preventing a 
possible explosion, and he intends to do everything he can to 
ensure this. "The situation is under control, we have the trust 
of the people and I will rely on it," Yuryy Meshkov said.

  [Text] Kiev, April 6 (AFP) -- Both Ukraine and Crimea on 
Wednesday played down a visit by senior Ukrainian military 
officers to Crimea while its separatist leader Yuryy Meshkov was 
abroad, with Meshkov's spokesman stating "no coup d'etat" was 
underway. 
  The visit Tuesday had sparked speculation in the Russian 
press about a possible challenge by Kiev to Crimea's Russian 
nationalist leader, who defied Ukraine with a referendum on the 
peninsula last month that won overwhelming backing for closer 
ties with Russia. 
  But Viacheslav Lebedev, the head of Mechkov's press service, 
said Wednesday that "nothing extraordinary was happening in 
Crimea and that there was no coup d'etat underway." 
  Vladimir Petenko, an aide to Ukrainian President Leonid 
Kravchuk, said the visit Tuesday had been "planned" beforehand. 
  He also said a report by Russian central television saying 
it 
was an unexpected visit by some 30 special forces and several 
generals "did not correspond to reality." 
  The chief spokesman for the Ukrainian Defense Ministry, 
Aleksandr Kluban, meanwhile said eight officers of the Ukrainian 
chief of staff were sent to Sebastopol with "a single general" 
and that "no member of the special forces" had taken part in the 
trip. 
  He said the officers had met with the commander of the Black 
Sea Fleet, Admiral Eduard Baltin, who he said had accidentally 
wounded himself a few days ago with his own service weapon. 
  Some Russian press reports had announced Tuesday that 
Ukrainian Defense Minister Vitalyy Radetsky himself had gone to 
Crimea, but the Defense Ministry spokesman said Radetsky and his 
chief aids had been in meetings all day Tuesday in Kiev. 
  ITAR-TASS news agency was among those that had said about 30 
special interior ministry forces had taken up station on a 
warship after arriving in the Ukraine on Tuesday. It said top 
generals from army intelligence, the air force, 
counter-espionage and the national guard had also come. 
  The return of Meshkov from a visit to Cyprus had been 
delayed 
for eight hours because Turkey had closed its airspace, the 
agency said, quoting a member of the crew on Meshkov's plane. 
  Russians comprise 67 percent of the population in Crimea, 
which the then Soviet leadership transferred to Ukraine in 1954.

  [Text] Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov held a news 
conference today devoted to the latest events in Crimea's 
political and economic life. He negatively commented on the 
introduction of the office of the Ukrainian president's 
representative in Crimea, describing this step as a political 
provocation aimed at hindering the second round of elections for 
the Crimean Supreme Council. Regarding presidential 
representative Valeriy Horbatov, Yuriy Meshkov said in a 
televised interview yesterday that Crimean interests are 
Horbatov's least concern, and that a honest man who cherishes 
these interests will not shake his hand. At the news 
conference, Meshkov added that the Republic of Crimea has lost 
one of its citizens. In a sharp and even offensive tone, 
Meshkov spoke of the Ukrainian leadership which, in his opinion, 
prevents the Crimea from dealing with its economy, provokes 
confrontation, and creates tensions on the peninsula. The 
presence of military subunits saturated -- as he put it -- with 
nationalistic spirit not only does not guarantee Crimean 
security, but also threatens it. 
  Many questions from journalists concerned relations between 
Yuriy Meshkov and Crimean Deputy Prime Minister Yevhen Saburov. 
Meshkov stated that he corrected Saburov's mistakes by issuing 
another decree. Effective today, the previous low prices for 
bread are reinstated in the Crimea. The Crimean president does 
not share the concern that Saburov might be dismissed, which is 
being voiced behind the scenes.

  [Text] I adhere to the idea that the regions of Ukraine 
should have the broadest possible economic independence. 
Ukraine's President Leonid Kravchuk said this at a meeting with 
journalists at the Market Reforms Press Club in Kiev. As far as 
political federalization is concerned, the president believes it 
is premature, although he does not rule out its introduction in 
future. Today, according to Leonid Kravchuk, this is 
unrealizable due to objective reasons, and could endanger 
Ukraine's independence and the progress of the economic reform. 
  In addition, the president termed as dangerous the policy 
which the president of Crimea has been conducting of late. 
Leonid Kravchuk emphasized that not a single decree on economic 
issues has so far been issued by Yuryy Meshkov and no economic 
decisions have been made toward that end.

  [Text] In an interview with INTERFAX the Crimean 
president's military adviser Valeryy Kuznetsov declared that 
Ukraine "has substantially increased its military presence in 
the Crimea," thus unilaterally violating Crimea's Constitution 
and decree on the division of authorities between Ukraine and 
Crimea. These stipulate that all changes in the stationing and 
strength of military units should be coordinated with the 
corresponding Crimean structures. 
  He reported that at present two mechanized brigades had been 
formed within the 32d Army corps. One of them, about 2000 in 
number, is deployed in the village of Perevalnoe, the second 
brigade is in Kerch and Feodosiya. In addition air mobile 
forces to be stationed in the city of Saki are being formed, 
said Kuznetsov. 
  "This is being done without the knowledge of the Supreme 
Soviet and Crimean president. We have sent a request to 
Ukraine's Defense Minister and commander of the 32d Army corps 
and are waiting for an answer," said Kuznetsov. 
  He also expressed perplexity due to the fact that the 
Ukrainian Army had taken control of several military 
installations, some of them crucial to the country's defenses. 
These are deteriorating due to the absence of appropriate funds 
in Ukraine. As an example he reported that the training base 
for the pilots of the aircraft carrier aviation is located in 
the disposition of Ukrainian servicemen. Meanwhile, Ukraine has 
no aircraft carriers.

  [Text] Emergency rule should not be imposed in Ukraine 
unless this is done to prevent bloodshed, Ukrainian President 
Leonid Kravchuk told the press club of market reforms in Kiev 
Wednesday. 
  Answering an INTERFAX-Ukraine question about the Crimean 
situation, Kravchuk said that "flexible policy should be used in 
Crimea. We could regard Crimea as an economic experiment 
provided that the economic autonomy of Crimea was brought into 
line with the Ukrainian legislation." 
  Kravchuk said that "thus far, the Crimean president has not 
issued a single economic decree. Moving the hands on the clock 
will not make the economy work for reforms." (INTERFAX Note: 
The Crimea switched to Moscow time as of March 27). 
  In Kravchuk's view, "the Crimean president flagrantly 
violates the legislation of both Crimea and Ukraine. Meshkov 
believes that there is nobody between himself, the people and 
God. This policy is dangerous and I am waiting for it to come 
to an end." 
  In Kravchuk's view, Meshkov's entourage "continuously 
provokes the Crimean president against Ukraine." 
  Kravchuk was confident that experience will show the lie in 
the speculations that Kiev obstructed progress in Crimea. 
  The president emphasized that regions should enjoy the 
largest possible economic latitude. He did not rule out the 
possibility that political institutions might result from an 
economic experiment in the four Donets-Dnieper regions. 
  Kravchuk thought, however, that "full-fledged 
federalization" 
would be premature because it would threaten the unity of the 
state. 
  He said that hopes for a fast solution to all problems was 
the biggest folly since independence. 
  Kravchuk thought that there was "no Zvyagilsky government as 
such because it was the government inherited from Prime Minister 
Leonid Kuchma. I am not ashamed of this government because it 
has just started specific economic reforms such as privatization 
and monetary reform." 
  Kravchuk thought that the monetary reform was dependent on 
the availability of a currency stabilization fund and on the 
help of the International Monetary Fund. 
  He thought that foreign countries could have provided more 
aid to Ukraine.

  [Text] Simferopol, Crimea -- According to some reports, a 
slight increase in the contingent of the Ukrainian Defense 
Ministry's special forces has been observed in Crimea. 
Representatives of the Republic of Crimea's presidential 
administration told UNIAN they have information that the 
Ukrainian president is preparing a directive introducing a state 
of emergency in Crimea. Interviewed by a UNIAN correspondent on 
6 April, Vasyl Rudenko, the official in charge of the Ukrainian 
president's service for territorial matters, denied rumors of a 
state of emergency being introduced on the peninsula, said they 
are totally groundless and are being spread by members of Yuryy 
Meshkov's team. 
  Vasyl Rudenko also pointed out that a body representing the 
Ukrainian president was set up in Crimea and that "under the 
legislation of Ukraine, relations between the autonomous 
republic and Ukraine are based on the law delimiting powers 
between their authorities." 
  Interviewed by journalists on the same day, Yevgenyy 
Saburov, 
Crimean deputy prime minister, did not rule out a possibility of 
leaving that post in the situation that was arising. 
  Interviewed by Crimean TV on 5 April, Mykola Mykhalchenko, 
head of the Ukrainian president's domestic policy service, who 
now is in Crimea, stated: "Many decrees being passed in Crimea 
surprise and genuinely distress me. A directive may contain two 
to three clauses and yet violate not only five to six Ukrainian 
laws, but also provisions in the Crimean Constitution." This, 
in his view, is "an example of disrespect for Crimea's own laws 
and is legal arbitrariness." 
  The head of the Ukrainian president's domestic policy 
service 
also said the main task of the newly appointed representative of 
the Ukrainian president to Crimea would be encouraging political 
stabilization in the region and harmonizing political and 
economic relations between the governments of Crimea and 
Ukraine. "This is a very important task without which things 
will be bad both for Ukraine and Crimea," Mykola Mykhalchenko 
added. 
  On 6 April, Crimean President Yuryy Meshkov met Valentyn 
Nedryhaylo, Ukrainian deputy internal affairs minister, who is 
on a planned working trip to the peninsula.

  [Text] On 5 April, Crimean mass media carried a statement 
by Valeryy Horbatov, newly appointed representative of the 
Ukrainian president in the Republic of Crimea. Here is an 
excerpt from that statement. 
  [Begin Horbatov recording, in Russian] In accordance with 
the Ukrainian president's edict, I am assuming the duties of the 
Ukrainian president's permanent representative in the Republic 
of Crimea. Here, at the beginning, I want to point out that the 
main, primary goals of this endeavor are political. These goals 
include peace and political stability in the Crimea; control 
over the observance of Ukrainian law and the Constitution on 
Crimean territory, as envisioned by the Law on the Division of 
Powers Between State Bodies of Ukraine and the Republic of 
Crimea; control over the observance of Ukraine's commitments to 
the Republic of Crimea; and representation of the Crimea on the 
international level. I want to say that I am deeply convinced 
that there are a sufficient number of educated, experienced, and 
knowledgeable specialists in the Crimea to carry out concrete 
economic work. I am positive that we will not have any problems 
in terms of economics. Our primary task and main goal is to 
make the combined potential of the Crimea and Ukraine work for 
the benefit of our people, to eliminate from our lives the still 
existing ambiguous issues of contention and confrontation, as 
well as problems of nationalism. Our lives are too complicated 
to be aggravated further by artificial factors. Let us all 
unite our efforts for one goal, that is the well-being of our 
people. Let every person remember that he lives only once. We 
should live our lives in such a way as not to feel ashamed in 
the face of those who will come to replace us. I [words 
indistinct] that we will have no friction with the Crimean 
government. I am sure that our cooperation will be harmonious 
and agreeable, because we have a common goal of making the lives 
of the Crimean people better. [Words indistinct] to attain peace 
and accord. [end recording]

  [Text] Crimean Internal Affairs Minister Oleksandr Plyuta 
has asked the Crimean president to not consider him as a 
candidate to head the Crimean Ministry of Internal Affairs [MVS] 
when a new government is formed. This is how the minister 
reacted to an interview Meshkov held with INTERFAX, in which he 
accused the Crimean MVS and its leadership of corruption and 
inability to effectively fight crime. 
  At a time of distrust, when the press, your team, and you 
personally are spreading mass fabrications and rumors that the 
MVS and its leadership are connected with criminals; when legal 
nihilism and the lack of control came into being under your 
administration, it is practically impossible to work -- thus 
reads a letter written by Oleksandr Plyuta to Yuryy Meshkov.

  [Text] Sevastopol -- On 5 April, the Coordinative Council 
of the Black Sea Fleet Officers' Assemblies received a letter 
from the Russian Government's interdepartmental commission for 
social matters relating to servicemen and members of their 
families. In particular, it expresses concern regarding the 
fate of the Black Sea Fleet both by ordinary Russians, who are 
their Motherland's true patriots, and representatives of the 
Russian Federation's every branch of power. 
  The letter states that the question of the Black Sea Fleet 
was addressed at an interdepartmental conference in February, 
attended by officials from Russia's Social Security Ministry, 
Foreign Affairs Ministry, and Defense Ministry, whose proposals 
on a settlement of the issue of the Black Sea Fleet were 
forwarded to Russian Federation Government Chairman Viktor 
Chernomyrdin on 9 March. The interdepartmental commission also 
noted that under the Massandra protocol of 3 August 1993, the 
preparation of an agreement between Russia and Ukraine was 
continuing. 
  The letter points out: "It makes provision for the whole of 
the Black Sea Fleet and all its infrastructure in Crimea being 
used by the Russian Federation and having Russia's insignia, 
with the Russian side making appropriate payments for the half 
of the Black Sea Fleet, including its infrastructure, that under 
the previous accords was not to be transferred to Ukraine."

28,744,296 people, or 75.61 percent, took part in the voting. 
  The electors were most active in Ternopol Oblast -- 91.62 
percent, Ivano-Frankovsk -- 88.47 percent, Lvov Oblast -- 80.56 
percent (87.56 percent). Less active were the electors in Kiev 
-- 59.74 percent, the Crimea Republic -- [words indistinct]. 
The elections took place in all the 400 [as heard] 
constituencies. People's deputies were elected in 49 
constituencies. Among the newly elected deputies, five are the 
leaders of collective agricultural enterprises, four are 
entrepreneurs, six are employees of councils at all levels, four 
are education workers, three are employees of public 
organizations, and 16 are people's deputies of the current 
Supreme Council. 
  Twelve representatives of the Communist Party, four 
representatives of the People's Movement of Ukraine [Rukh], two 
representatives of the Ukrainian Republican Party, two 
representatives of the Peasants' Party of Ukraine, two 
representatives of the Socialist Party of Ukraine, two 
representatives of the Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists, and 
one representative of the Ukrainian Conservative Republican 
Party were elected people's deputies on 27 March. 
  As far as nationalities are concerned, 41 Ukrainians, seven 
Russians, and one Adygey were elected to the Supreme Council. 
[end recording] 
  [Tatarenko] The chairman of the Central Electoral Commission 
also reported that in the 400 constituencies where more than two 
candidates were running in the election of people's deputies of 
Ukraine and none was elected, run-off elections were scheduled 
for 2, 3, 9, and 10 April 1994 in compliance with the election 
law and by decisions of the district electoral commissions. The 
run-off elections took place on 2 and 3 April in 34 
constituencies, pointed out Ivan Yemets. 
  The Central Electoral Commission then considered the issue 
of 
preparations for the election of the president of Ukraine, which 
is to take place on 26 June 1994. Viktor (Pohorilko), deputy 
chairman of the Central Electoral Commission reported on the 
estimated expenditures for preparing and holding the election of 
the president of Ukraine. 
  [Begin (Pohorilko) recording] There are comparisons 
available. The estimated expenditure for the election of 
people's deputies was the amount of 1 trillion 154 billion 
karbovantsi. This sum has not yet been received in full, 
although the financing was taking place, as a whole, within the 
appropriate terms. The estimated expenditure for holding the 
election of the president are somewhat higher, in the amount of 
1 trillion and more, about 600 billion karbovantsi -- 657 
billion, or 618 billion karbovantsi according to verified data. 
[end recording] 
  [Tatarenko] Proceeding from the report by Ihor Tseluyko, the 
secretary of the Central Electoral Commission, a resolution was 
passed on the rules of checking how the requirements of the law 
on the election of the Ukrainian president are abided by -- as 
far as the collection of signatures in support of a contender 
for candidate for the president of Ukraine is concerned. 
  At the sitting of the Central Electoral Commission, they 
considered and approved the text of recommendations of the 
commission to district electoral commissions regarding specific 
issues of preparing and holding the election of the president of 
Ukraine with the provisions of the new election legislation 
taken into account. 
  Having considered the application and other documents 
submitted by the Socialist Party and the Social Democratic 
Party, the Central Electoral Commission -- in compliance with 
the law on the election of the president of Ukraine -- 
registered them as those who expressed their intention to 
nominate their candidate to run in the election of the president 
of Ukraine. 
  Some other issues connected with the preparations for the 
election of the president were also considered.

<F P=106> [Report attributed to UNIAN] </F>
  [Text] On 29 March, Ivan Yemets, head of the Central 
Electoral Commission, held a press conference on the results of 
the elections to the Ukrainian Supreme Council. He confirmed 
the following: 
  The elections took place in all 450 electoral districts. In 
the first round, 49 deputies were elected, of which 11 are 
engineers, 13 education system workers, three lawyers and 
economists. 
  In terms of party membership, the break-down of deputies is 
as follows: 12 members of the Communist Party of Ukraine, four 
members of the Rukh, two from the Ukrainian Republican Party, 
Ukrainian Peasants' Party, and Socialist Party each, while other 
24 were independent deputies. 
  In the words of Ivan Yemets, most of the parties retain 
their 
positions in the second round of elections. In the first place, 
this applies to Communists, Socialists, and national democrats. 
Ivan Yemets expressed confidence that the "second round will 
give Ukraine a new legislature." 
  Asked how many deputies are required to make the new 
Ukrainian parliament work, Ivan Yemets responded: The present 
legislation has some discrepancies regarding this question. 
This is why it will clear up later whether 226 or 301 deputies 
will be necessary." 
  Speaking on the Crimean referendum, Ivan Yemets declared 
that 
the Central Electoral Commission had nothing to do with it. 
This is solely the business of the Crimean president. It was 
announced that most of the electoral commissions set the 
second-round election for 10 April. In this connection, Ivan 
Yemets called on the press representative to explain to the 
population the need to elect a new parliament. 
<H5>  Rukh Garnered 12 Percent </H5>
  Of 49 deputies elected on 27 March, 11 represent the Rukh or 
were supported by it. They include the organization's activists 
Vyacheslav Chornovil, Les Tanyuk, Mykhaylo Kosiv, Yaroslav 
Kendzyor, Serhyy Holovatyy, Andryy Mostyskyy -- all were members 
of the previous Supreme Council. 
<H5>  The Election Results Were Fabricated </H5>
  Levko Lukyanenko, honorary chairman of the Ukrainian 
Republican Party [URP] and cochairman of the Democratic Bloc 
"Ukraine," noted: "The outcome of this election is not the 
result of the electorate's preferences, but the result of the 
struggle conducted by the party in power with democratic forces. 
We are dealing here not with the real popular choice, but the 
documentation of the actual balance of forces. The party in 
power used its structures and exerted an immense influence on 
the electorate, resorting to intimidation, forgery, and blatant 
violation of the electoral law. In many places, fearful of 
losing their jobs, people refused to be observers. The 
electorate is scared, in particular, the part that we counted 
on. The elections took place in an atmosphere of a flagrant 
violation of law and intimidation," Levko Lukyanenko emphasized. 
The cochairman of the Democratic Bloc "Ukraine" cited the 
following facts: In Lugansk Oblast, instead of distributing 
ballot papers, they made lists indicating who voted for whom. 
In Tarashchanskyy Electoral District, where the URP's candidate 
Petro Borsuk ran, a truck crashed into Borsuk's car in the 
evening of 27 March. After the truck's driver was hospitalized 
with a concussion, rumor spread that it was Borsuk himself who 
was in the hospital. 
  Asked to comment on the defeat of the URP leader, Mykhaylo 
Horyn, in the election delivered by Stepan Khmara, Levko 
Lukyanenko noted that there are two reasons for this. First, 
some disservice was done by discontent with Horyn's brother, 
Mykola, who is head of the Lvov Oblast Council. Second, Stepan 
Khmara deliberately ran in the same district with Horyn to 
demonstrate his hostility to the URP, and used all of his 
eloquence to deceive uneducated social groups. "However, 
Mykhaylo Horyn," Levko Lukyanenko noted, "was not knocked off 
his feet. He still has his energy, and will continue to work 
for Ukraine." 
<H5>  Negative Opinion </H5>
  Serhyy Holovatyy, the newly elected deputy and head of the 
Ukrainian Legal Foundation, spoke critically about the results 
of the first-round election to the Supreme Council. He stated 
that "presidential representatives, who have already inflicted 
heavy damages on Ukraine," will sneak through rural electoral 
districts. In his words, the Ukrainian people will feel the 
negative consequences of their choice for a long time to come. 
<H5>  Communists' Performance [subhead] </H5>
  In the headquarters of the Socialist Party of Ukraine, we 
were told that their candidate, Oleksandr Bozhko, qualified for 
the second round in the Pecherskyy Constituency of Kiev City. 
However, the Socialists declined to say how many of their 
candidates made it to the second round of the election, asking 
us to wait until official announcement of the election 
  In the headquarters of the Communist Party of Ukraine, we 
were told that the party's 173 candidates won in the first round 
in 22 Ukrainian oblasts, including Oleh Hrachov, Oleksandr 
Bondarchuk, and Volodymyr Martynyuk. 
<H5>  Performance of the Greens </H5>
  The 31 members of the Green Party that were put forward by 
working teams, and not by the party, were not successful. In 
particular, the party's leader Vitalyy Kononov, an independent 
candidate at the Gagarin Electoral District, did not get to the 
second round of the elections. 
<H5>  "New Ukraine" and Liberals] </H5>
  The Secretariat of the "New Ukraine" said that their two 
members, Volodymyr Hrynyov and Volodymyr Filenko, who ran from 
Kharkov, qualified for the second-round election. According to 
the party's Donetsk-based organization, four Liberal Party 
members, including its vice president Yuryy Baskakov, entered 
the second round. 
<H5>  Mass Agitation in the Crimea </H5>
  The Crimean National Movement Organization [OKNR], the 
Crimean organization of the URP, the Ukrainian Civilian Congress 
of the Crimea, and the Committee "Crimea With Ukraine" made 
public a declaration emphasizing serious violations of law in 
the elections that have just taken place. The "statement by 
Yuryy Meshkov, the highest official in the Republic, made on the 
eve of the election" is called one of the grossest violations. 
The documents also points to the fact that according to 
preliminary findings, the poll did not result in an overwhelming 
approval -- it was ignored by the Crimean Tatars, a considerable 
part of Ukrainians, and representatives of other nationalities. 
"We are confident," the declaration's authors stated, "that the 
poll's results will be fabricated." In this connection, the 
OKNR and other Crimean pro-Ukrainian organizations announced 
their intention of coordinating their activities regarding the 
issues of "preserving Ukraine's territorial integrity." 
  Leaders of the Ukrainian Civilian Congress, the Committee 
"Crimea With Ukraine", and the OKNR held a press conference, 
where Ihor Banakh, deputy chairman of the Committee "Crimea With 
Ukraine," discussed "numerous violations during the Crimean 
election." In his words, there were cases in which one 
individual could vote for several candidates. In one of the 
electoral districts of the Krasnoperekopsk District, the militia 
detained a group of people encouraging people to vote for the 
"Russia" Bloc. Members of electoral commissions removed posted 
information on pro-Ukrainian candidates. Ihor Banakh expressed 
his personal hope that official Kiev will pursue tougher 
policies with regard to manifestations of the Crimean separatism.

<F P=106> [Interview with Stepan Khmara, chairman of the Ukrainian </F>
Conservative Republican Party, by Viktor Shapoval; place and 
date not given: "Stepan Khmara Was Elected to the Parliament. 
It Is Cloudy in Ukraine"] 
  [Text] [Shapoval] First of all, let me congratulate you 
for your victory. What was your first thought, when you learned 
the results of voting? 
  [Khmara] I always believed in victory. I did not have any 
doubts about it, and I was simply interested in numbers. I 
would like to thank all the people, particularly, my voters, who 
trusted, supported, and helped me during the electoral campaign. 
Although we did not have money for the campaign, we proved that 
it is possible to win without it. It once again came to me that 
our people are able to achieve a lot. Without the help of the 
people, I would not have had the chance of dealing with 
politics. Despite all the efforts undertaken by our enemies, 
and despite the incompetence of authorities, the voters made 
their choice. 
  [Shapoval] What was the reason behind your success? 
  [Khmara] I would not like to boil everything down to 
politics. What led me to politics and always determines my 
behavior is the desire to leave a humane trace on this sinful 
earth. I want to do good for our Ukraine and my people. The 
truth has won. It is said in the Bible: You will find the 
truth and the truth will set you free. People link Khmara to 
decency, honesty, and diligence. Khmara and the voters have 
become a whole. A deputy must always remember that a 
legislative seat is not his property, but the voters'. 
  [Shapoval] You are often accused of populism. How would you 
respond to these accusations? 
  [Khmara] What does populism mean? If populism means to be 
with the people and defend their interests, I will always 
endorse it. After all, only the support of the people allows me 
to be accomplished in politics. 
  [Shapoval] In the elections, you confirmed your renown and 
achieved success. Viktor Pynzenyk and Ihor Yukhnovskyy also 
won. Is it possible for you to cooperate? 
  [Khmara] When Viktor Pynzenyk was in the government, I 
always tried to cooperate and help him. Unfortunately, this did 
not yield any results. I am skeptical toward him. This man 
fulfills the will of people who are behind the scenes. 
  Ihor Rafayilovych [Yukhnovskyy] is a master of dodging. 
Once, 12 people's deputies had a bitter conversation with him. 
We seriously warned him against destructive activities. This 
relates to [Ukrainian President] Leonid Kravchuk's decree on 
commodity bonds totalling $10 billion. Ihor Rafayilovych 
zealously defended the decree. He consciously fulfills someone 
else's will. 
  [Shapoval] How do you assess the results of the first round 
of the elections? 
  [Khmara] When it comes to Halychyna, I am very pleased: 
There are already five, perhaps six, people in Khmara's team in 
Lvov, Ternopil, and Ivano-Frankivsk Oblasts. This is a serious 
force. The second round is still ahead, however, in which our 
people will stand pretty good chances, not only in Halychyna, 
but also in other regions. 
  [Shapoval] Do you want to form your own group in the 
parliament? 
  [Khmara] Yes, I want to form a group of hardworking, decent, 
and dedicated people who would resist any temptations. A group 
of 20-30 single-minded people can significantly influence the 
political atmosphere. Now, it can be said that such a group 
will exist. Our expectations have partially come true. One 
cannot think of a party or faction majority -- which is often 
voiced by [Rukh leader] Vyacheslav Chornovil -- without irony, 
because those people are so polarized, and their principles are 
not defined. Vyacheslav himself has not always been consistent 
either. He has rather played the role of a destructive 
politician in both Lvov and Kiev. Rukh can only blab. Who are 
these people? What are they able to do? 
  Of course, the situation in Odessa and Donbass elicits 
certain concern. A powerful industrial Mafia, which has been 
enjoying the most favored status granted by President Leonid 
Kravchuk, still remains there. How could he [Kravchuk] allow 
for these polls? Our president is completely unable to perform 
constructive state- building work. The elections of the Crimean 
president were absolutely illegal. Instead of annulling the 
decree on elections and pronouncing them illegal, President 
Leonid Kravchuk solemnly received the illegal president. For 
this alone, Leonid Kravchuk should be removed from power and 
brought to account. 
  [Former Prime Minister] Leonid Kuchma, who also was elected 
deputy, is another person very dangerous for Ukraine. He could 
be easily neutralized, and I have recently offered my services 
with this regard to [Supreme Council Chairman] Ivan Plyushch. I 
heard Kuchma saying that Lobov is a man he trusts. Leonid 
Kuchma offered to Lobov the office of Cabinet of Ministers 
minister which is one of the key offices. Currently, Lobov 
lives in France. He stole what he could and left the country. 
I demanded that a criminal case be opened against him, to 
recover at least a part of the money he stole. People should 
know of this, since Leonid Kuchma is running for the 
presidential seat. 
  Generally, I would like to see as many decent people with 
common sense in the new parliament as possible. 
  [Shapoval] The second round of the elections is approaching. 
What would you like to say to the voters? 
  [Khmara] Let them follow the people about whose decency they 
are completely sure. If they trust Khmara, let them vote for I. 
Kalynets, D. Chobit, O. Hudyma, and V. Dzera. I have political 
experience, knowledge, and analytical skills, which have been 
confirmed in practice. I, therefore, want the voters to do 
precisely that. It is not necessary for Khmara; it is necessary 
for Ukraine.

<F P=106> [Interview with Leonid Kuchma, president of the Ukrainian </F>
Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, by unidentified 
reporter; recorded by V. Zhilin: "It Is Impossible To Cooperate 
With Today's Authorities. What They Are Doing Is Not for the 
Good of the People"] 
  [Text] Last week Leonid Kuchma, president of the Ukrainian 
Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs (USPP), made a brief 
visit to Donetsk. He met with members of the oblast association 
of leaders of enterprises and organizations. This visit from 
the ex-prime minister of Ukraine was no accident: On 14 April 
there will be a special congress of the USPP at which the 
critical condition of our Republic's economy and industry will 
be discussed. 
  On that same day Leonid Kuchma met with journalists and 
answered their questions. 
  In particular, the AKTSENT correspondent asked Kuchma the 
following questions: 
  [AKTSENT] The present elections have shown that it is 
practically impossible to win without a powerful political 
organization. Will the present congress of industrialists and 
entrepreneurs not be the congress where a new political party is 
born? 
  [Kuchma] I agree with you that without a strong party it is 
impossible to expect anything significant in the future. When I 
visited the Baltic countries, Estonia, and Lithuania, I was 
convinced of this once again because Brazauskas himself came to 
power precisely because his party had a majority in parliament. 
This is also why they could form their own government. In that 
kind of situation, it is possible to speak of something serious 
regarding questions of reforming the economy. But if there is 
no support in parliament, all your good intentions will remain 
on paper. I agree that we should think seriously about a party, 
but we are not ready for this yet. We do not plan to discuss 
this question at the congress. 
  [AKTSENT] How do you evaluate the current makeup of the 
parliament today? 
  [Kuchma] The tendencies of the new parliament are not very 
promising so far. It is quite probable that, on the one hand, 
the parliament will be too far to the right and, on the other, 
too far to the left. Of course, you know my viewpoint--people 
should not be included in the new parliament according to their 
political convictions, they should not be representatives of any 
particular party, but they should be people who can 
professionally work not so much in politics as in the economy, 
which today is on its last legs and is not working. 
  [AKTSENT] Leonid Danilovich, you know that in Donetsk and 
Lugansk Oblasts a referendum was held on a number of questions 
with which you are familiar. If you had voted in the Donbass 
how would you have responded to them? 
  [Kuchma] My position on these issues is known. I have always 
been open and was one of the initiators of the alliance with 
both Russia and the CIS states, and I stand on that. I am not 
recanting even now. Regarding the Russian language, my position 
is this: I think there should be one state language, Ukrainian, 
but there should be two official languages--Russian and 
Ukrainian. What is an official state language? It is the 
language of diplomacy and laws. Everything else is in official 
languages, taking into account local conditions and 
peculiarities. I also support the land-federative structure. I 
am a proponent of having obligations and responsibility 
regarding many issues shifted to the regions... 
  [AKTSENT] Does Ukraine need an industry that lives for 
itself 
and works for itself? 
  [Kuchma] I have said and will say that we do not need that 
kind of industry, but we are not to blame for this, since we 
received fragments from the overall system of the former Soviet 
Union. It is impossible to restructure it in a single day. 
Structural rearrangement of industry takes time and money. At 
the same time we cannot simply close down the enterprises and 
throw the people out in the street... 
  [AKTSENT] And if the enterprises are not making it? 
  [Kuchma] Declare them bankrupt. I have expressed my opinion 
about this position many times in parliament. An analysis of 
the enterprises must be conducted in each branch. Enterprises 
that are operating at a loss or are unprofitable must be closed 
or reprofiled. Today the following situation has been created 
at many plants and mines in our country--here it is better to 
pay them the average wage than to pay to have them operate some 
how and produce products for which there is no demand. Today I 
have already given you the example of the Donbass. Here the 
coal industry was headed toward closure, dying out. It was 
planned to operate at a loss since immense coal deposits had 
been discovered in the Kuzbass where they use the open-pit 
method. But now coal is your future. But it takes investments 
to construct a modern new mine. Again I emphasize that we will 
not survive alone, the more so in our enclosed space. 
  [AKTSENT] Do you have a program you are planning to bring to 
the new parliament as a people's deputy of the new convocation? 
  [Kuchma] It is practically impossible to cooperate with our 
present executive branch because it does what it does not for 
the good of the people but for the opposite. I have already 
spoken about its program previously... 
  [AKTSENT] Still what would you suggest as immediate steps to 
emerge from the crisis? 
  [Kuchma] I think that today we must solve the problems that 
lie on the surface. Namely, we must finally determine which 
enterprises Ukraine needs and which it does not. This has to be 
done in order to understand who is who. Second, of course, we 
cannot change the situation without working capital. How can we 
solve this problem? Already, that is a different question. 
Third, is currency regulation. It too must be solved 
immediately since now the fixed exchange rate of the karbovanets 
to the dollar makes it so that all our products are exported at 
a loss. And, undoubtedly, we must consider a number 
of other questions as well, including taxation. 
  [AKTSENT] When speaking in parliament, you have frequently 
repeated the question: Where is Ukraine going? So where is 
Ukraine going today? 
  [Kuchma] Do you mean to ask what we are now building? I do 
not think there is either pure socialism or pure capitalism in 
the world today. Still capital has taken various of our 
achievements from the former Soviet Union and successfully 
applied them at home. Including a planned economy -- precisely 
planned. 
  [AKTSENT] There has now been talk about the inexpediency of 
holding presidential elections. What is your opinion? 
  [Kuchma] There is a law here and the law must be obeyed. 
Therefore, the presidential elections must take place. Here I 
fully share the opinion of Ivan Stepanovich Plyushch. There are 
no grounds for not holding them. 
  [AKTSENT] Ukraine also has an acute problem of nonpayments. 
Is there a program for this? 
  [Kuchma] There is only one way out -- offsetting through 
bills of exchange and determining which enterprises are 
bankrupt, with all the consequences that ensue from this. 
  [AKTSENT] How do you envisage the mechanism for the 
formation 
of the budget? 
  [Kuchma] It must be formed from below, that is, begin with 
the regions so that they are interested in the distribution of 
productive forces. Now we have everything the other way around 
-- the main thing is not who works and how, but that everything 
is divided up per capita. This approach is absolutely 
incorrect. Here I think we must have a single principle for 
all: He who works better must also live better. 
  [AKTSENT] Radio Liberty broadcast a report to the effect 
that 
there were various violations in the electoral precincts of your 
district, where you ran as a candidate people's deputy and won a 
victory. What do you have to say? 
  [Kuchma] I never put out a single additional leaflet or 
uttered a single offensive word against my opponents. At the 
same time my opponents brought in mountains of various kinds of 
paper "garbage" and distributed it throughout the district. It 
would have been better for them to give notebooks and textbooks 
to the school children than to get involved in something like 
that.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Drop in Production Continues"] </F>
  [Text] According to the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast Statistics 
Department, the volume of production in January-March 1994 
decreased by 45 percent compared with the corresponding period 
last year. The decline in production particularly affected 
construction materials, black metallurgy, and machine-building. 
More than half of enterprises in the oblast reduced the 
production of consumer goods. 
  There are, however, certain positive aspects of the 
production slump, as ATN admits. Industrial enterprises emitted 
to atmosphere 18 percent less harmful substances compared with 
the parallel period last year.

  [Text] Compulsory certification of output is being 
introduced in Ukraine from 1 July 1994. Any goods designated 
for export must have a certificate authenticating their quality 
and bearing the relevant safety and ecology requirement. 
Ukraine's biggest trading partner, Russia, has already 
undertaken compulsory certification of export goods since the 
beginning of this year.

  [Text] Kiev -- As UNIAN has already reported, the president 
of Ukraine on 23 February this year signed a directive "On 
urgent steps to develop nuclear power engineering and complete 
the nuclear fuel cycle in Ukraine." It provides for the 
launching of four new reactors, relaunching the second 
generating unit at the Chernobyl nuclear power station, which 
caught fire in 1991, and completing the nuclear fuel cycle. The 
directive caused disquiet among Ukraine's Ministry for 
Protection of the Population from the Chernobyl Aftermath, the 
Health Ministry, the Environmental Protection Ministry, and the 
State Committee for Safety Inspection in Atomic Energy, who have 
demanded that the directive be canceled and further work be done 
on it. 
  On 5 April, a news conference was held to announce the 
institution of a public committee uniting the Ukrainian Supreme 
Council's Standing Committee for Matters of the Chernobyl 
Accident, the National Commission for the Protection of the 
Population against Radiation under the Ukrainian Supreme 
Council, Ukraine's Greenpeace, the Green Party of Ukraine, and 
the Ukrainian Peace Council. An appeal to Ukrainian President 
Leonid Kravchuk was signed, demanding the invalidation of this 
directive, which, in the view of lawyers, breaks the law, 
violates the human right to ecological, radiation, and nuclear 
safety, and does not comply with the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights. 
  Interviewed by a UNIAN correspondent, Serhyy Kurakin, 
representative of the Ukrainian Greens Party, said the priority 
development of nuclear power engineering, as recorded in this 
directive, would mean greater capital investment in the industry 
without yielding the desired result.

  [Text] Dangerous plans of nuclear industry officials must 
be put to an end; that was the conclusion made by 
representatives of public, political, and [word indistinct] 
organizations gathered at a round table meeting initiated by 
Green Peace during a press conference for national and foreign 
journalists. During the conference, the situation and problems 
of the nuclear power engineering were analyzed. It was noted 
that its development, according to the old concept of fuel and 
energy complex management, will not only fail to improve the 
situation in [words indistinct], but will also deepen economic 
disproportions and result in unjustified losses of natural 
resources. Deputy Volodymyr [name indistinct], member of the 
legislative subcommission for scientific, social, and legal 
issues related to the Chernobyl catastrophe and nuclear power 
engineering, pointed out the parochial attitude toward problems 
of power engineering and narrow-sighted industry management 
system among factors that aggravated the condition of power 
engineering sector in 1993-94.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anna Melnikova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 7 Apr -- President of the Ingush Republic 
Ruslan Aushev today told an ITAR-TASS correspondent about the 
possibility of his leaving the session of the Federation 
Council. He made this statement at the end of a closed session 
of the upper chamber of parliament on ratifying the Russian 
president's decree extending the state of emergency in part of 
the territory of the Republic of North Ossetia and of the Ingush 
Republic for another two months. 
  Ruslan Aushev explained this "disagreement with the approach 
to the resolution of the problem of settling the conflict in the 
territories of North Ossetia and Ingushetia." In his opinion, 
"in drafting the President's decree on extending the emergency, 
the opinion of the component parts of the Federation should be 
taken into account." "This especially concerns those instances 
when questions are being tackled connected with change of the 
territories to which the force of the emergency is extended," he 
stressed. The Ingush president said the position of his 
republic remained as before: "It is necessary to give power to 
the interim administration in the conflict zone and disarm all 
the military formations." 
  President of North Ossetia Akhsarbek Galazov refrained from 
commenting on the content of the President's decree, and limited 
himself only to the statement that "it is necessary to move 
towards peace, stop shooting, and start working."

  [Text] The mayor of St. Petersburg has sent a letter to the 
government chairman, Viktor Chernomyrdin, which reports the 
critical situation of financing the city economy. Revenues in 
the first months of this year as compared to December last year 
have fallen by 40 percent. Today the debt owed by the mayor's 
office to budget-funded organizations is 110.607 billion rubles. 
To prevent the further development of critical phenomena in the 
city, Anatoliy Sobchak is asking the Russian Government to 
allocate a grant of 40 billion, provide compensation for the 
expenditure on increasing wages for workers in budget-funded 
organizations, and to preserve the amount allocated to the city 
budget from VAT at the 1993 level. In accordance with a 
presidential decree the tax was reduced from 50 percent last 
year to 25 percent this year.

<F P=106> [Report by Yuriy Nikiforenko, deputy of Orenburg Oblast </F>
Legislative Assembly, under the "Elections in the Regions" 
rubric: "Compromising Materials Did Not Help Either"] 
  [Text] Orenburg Oblast's electoral commission for the 
results of the elections in the Orenburg region has confirmed 
the mandates of 36 deputies. This is absolutely adequate to 
form the leading organs of representative power. 
  The voters supported the leaders and activists of the 
"Against Poverty, Unemployment, and Corruption" bloc of the 
peoples' patriotic forces, which included representatives of the 
Communist Party of the Russian Federation, the Russian Communist 
Workers' Party, the Agrarian Party of Russia and the Agrarian 
Union, the Union of Commodity Producers, the "For Social 
Justice" electoral association, the trade union of the 
agro-industrial complex, the "Officers Union," and other 
organizations. They also refused to vote confidence in 
representatives of "Russia's Choice," "Democratic Russia," and 
the social democrats. 
  The "democrats" conducted themselves in a very nervy manner 
right through the campaign, and their unofficial supervisor V. 
Shapovalenko, who holds the post of presidential representative, 
attacked the left-wing forces' candidates in radio and 
television broadcasts and violated the statute on the elections, 
which forbids officials of state organs of power to campaign. 
  On election day, Shapovalenko conducted himself in a very 
tempestuous manner at the polling stations, striking fear in the 
hearts of commission members and verbally abusing communist 
candidates. The oblast electoral commission was forced to send 
the president an official statement about his improper behavior. 
He is now interpreting the election results loosely and is 
dissatisfied because practical men representing the working 
people's interests have been elected to the oblast legislative 
assembly. 
  The compromising materials which the presidential 
representative prepared against candidates who were not to his 
liking and with which he hit television viewers a day before the 
elections, also failed to work. It is no accident that many 
Orenburg residents doubt whether the position of presidential 
representative is necessary.

  [Text] A meeting between N. Fedorov, president of the 
Chuvash Republic, and V. Likhachev, vice president of the 
Republic of Tatarstan, was held on 1 April 1994 in Cheboksary. 
Having discussed the state of economic, cultural, and scientific 
and technological relations with one another, the parties 
reached the conclusion of the need for their reinforcement and 
development by way of conclusion of a bilateral friendship and 
cooperation treaty. 
  During discussion of the social and political and economic 
situation in the Russian Federation the parties supported the 
reforms based on the principles of democracy, justice, and law 
that are being implemented. The role of the treaty between the 
Russian Federation and the Republic of Tatarstan of 15 February 
1994 and the [line illegible] and reform of Russia was 
emphasized in this connection. 
  The parties believe that all contentious matters on the 
territory of the Russian Federation should be resolved 
exclusively by peaceful methods, on the basis of negotiations. 
The president of the Chuvash Republic supported the proposal of 
the vice president of the Republic of Tatarstan concerning the 
creation in Kazan of a Eurasian Center for International 
Cooperation. 
  In their examination of humanitarian issues the parties 
observed that the official policy being pursued in the Republic 
of Tatarstan and the Chuvash Republic was geared to 
unconditional respect for human rights in accordance with 
international standards. The president of the Chuvash Republic 
and the vice president of the Republic of Tatarstan presented an 
initiative for the elaboration in Cheboksary under the aegis of 
UNESCO of an international project aimed at the preservation and 
development of the cultures and languages of the peoples of the 
Volga-Urals region. 
  V. Likhachev, vice president of Tatarstan, invited N. 
Fedorov, president of the Chuvash Republic, to pay an official 
visit to the Republic of Tatarstan. The president of the Chuvash 
Republic invited M. Shaymiyev, president of Tatarstan, to pay an 
official visit to the Chuvash Republic. The invitations were 
gratefully accepted. 
  The meeting was held in an atmosphere of friendship and 
mutual understanding. 
  The text of the communique was drawn up in Chuvash, Tatar, 
and Russian.

<F P=106> [Report by Yuriy Makhrin: "Soviet Power in Krasnaya Presnya"] </F>
  [Text] The city of Moscow's Krasnopresnenskiy Rayon Soviet 
presidium has adopted a decision to resume the activities of 
this organ of power. The decision notes that using his 
unconstitutional edicts, Yeltsin abolished the lawfully elected 
organs of representative power. The elections to the municipal 
soviets were fixed for March, then June, and now it is planned 
to put them off until the fall. But local self-government has 
been put entirely in the hands of an army of bureaucrats. You 
get the impression that this has been done on purpose. 
  The decision says that having become defenseless, Krasnaya 
Presnya residents are appealing for help from their deputies 
whose powers remain effective until 1995. In connection with 
this, the rayon soviet's activities resumed as of 28 March. It 
will hold consultations for Muscovites on legal questions and 
questions of housing, defend people's rights in the courts, and 
publicly monitor the executive branch's doings which are at 
present unchecked. 
  A public office for the rayon soviet has been set up. 
Sessions of the rayon soviet and its inner soviet should resume 
work in the space of a month. It has been decided to halt their 
activities only after the election in Moscow of the municipal 
soviets. 
  It has been reported to the editorial office that Rayon 
Soviet Chairman Aleksandr Krasnov has already been summoned to 
the city prosecutor's office, where there is concern about the 
rayon soviet's having resumed its activities.

"Tatar Nationalists Unite in the Face of Common Danger"] 
  [Text] A plenum of the "moderate" wing of the Pan-Tatar 
Public Center [PTPC] was held in Kazan on 2 April. 
  The "moderates" and "Radicals" from Tataria's biggest 
national organization now sit separately while it is still not 
clear which of them after all has the more right to be called 
the PTPC. Judging from the moods in the plenum, the positions 
of former comrades-in-arms have again begun to converge on the 
basis of an extremely negative attitude to the treaty between 
Russia and Tataria signed in February. Even the "moderate" PTPC 
has altered its critical stance, to one of direct confrontation 
with the republic's leadership. 
  The plenum expressed a vote of no confidence in the 
republic's leadership, which "has betrayed the Tatar people's 
interests," and stated that the PTPC demands early elections for 
president, Supreme Soviet, and heads of administrations. 
  In the opinion of local observers, the Tatar 
national-patriots now have a chance to have a new leader capable 
of uniting the different trends. Rafael Khakimov, adviser to 
the Republic of Tatarstan president and a former PTPC 
ideologist, may become one such leader. The address at the 
plenum made it clear that he, too, has come to oppose the 
leadership and is likely to hand in his resignation soon. 
  Should Mr. Khakimov really come to lead the national 
movement, the other leaders would have only a union to support 
because there now exist no differences between them save 
personal ones.

<F P=106> [Republic of Tatarstan Supreme Soviet Press Center report: </F>
"Sitting of the Republic of Tatarstan Supreme Soviet Presidium"] 
  [Text] A sitting of the Tatarstan Supreme Soviet Presidium 
was held yesterday. 
  In his introductory remarks at the opening of the sitting F. 
Mukhametshin, chairman of the Supreme Soviet, dwelt on a number 
of the priority problems confronting Tatarstan. 
  He emphasized that the treaty concluded between Tatarstan 
and 
Russia legally enshrined the path trodden by the Republic 
following the proclamation of state sovereignty. The results of 
the ballot on 13 March were a kind of vote of confidence by 
Tatarstanis in the policy chosen by the Republic. 
  Now, F. Mukhametshin said, it is necessary to immediately 
begin formulation of the strategy of the political and economic 
development of Tatarstan under the new historical conditions. It 
is necessary to get right down to filling sovereignty with real 
content, assimilate to the maximum the possibilities that have 
been acquired, and engage as quickly as possible the mechanisms 
of realization of the central provisions of the treaty. It is 
necessary to formulate an official program specially for this. 
It is a question of painstaking work geared to confirmation of 
the durability of sovereignty. 
  This means an intensification of the work [line illegible]. 
It is necessary to critically review the state of affairs in all 
sectors of the economy, analyze the financial, tax, and credit 
policy pursued by the government, and closely examine the 
priorities of economic support proposed by the president of the 
Republic of Tatarstan in his budget message for 1994. It is 
essential to revitalize the government's manifestly inadequate 
work on the search for internal reserves and possibilities of 
Tatarstan for imparting new impetus to the economic reforms, for 
a way out of the crisis, and for support for small and medium 
business. 
  His speech noted particularly that an appreciable adjustment 
of the law-making activity of the Supreme Soviet and its 
Presidium was required under the new conditions. The Supreme 
Soviet should by political and legal means support the 
realization of the treaty and the state sovereignty of the 
Republic. New laws actively influencing the progress of the 
economic reform and laws ensuring the social protection of the 
populace are needed. It is necessary to accelerate the 
preparation of bills on a reform of the representative and 
executive organs of state power of Tatarstan. The obsolete forms 
are clearly holding back development here, F. Mukhametshin said. 
  The chairman of the Supreme Soviet called attention to the 
need for an all-around analysis of the progress of privatization 
in the Republic and to the activity of the enterprises that have 
been converted into joint-stock companies and their relations 
with the treasury. Preparation for the spring field operations 
was cited as being among the priority areas of work today. The 
problem of the fight against crime must not disappear from the 
field of vision. 
  With the participation of members of the government and 
deputy chairmen of city and rayon soviets of people's deputies 
of the Republic, the sitting then examined the question of the 
progress of realization of the basic provisions of the Law "On 
Languages of the Peoples of Tatarstan" in Zelenodolsk and 
Zelenodolskiy Rayon. The decree on this matter was assumed as a 
basis. 
  The Presidium adopted the decision to continue the business 
of the Supreme Soviet 19th session on 16 April and to submit for 
its consideration the budget message of the president of the 
Republic of Tatarstan for 1994 and also a number of other 
supplementary questions. 
  The sitting also examined other questions of the Republic's 
state life. M. Sabirov, prime minister of the Republic of 
Tatarstan, his deputy F. Khamidullin, and Finance Minister D. 
Nagumanov took part in the business of the Presidium and spoke. 
The sitting was chaired by F. Mukhametshin.

<F P=106> [Report by Nikolay Volynskiy: "Most Illegal"] </F>
  [Text] In Russia's entire history there has perhaps been 
no other state measure conducted with so many violations of 
morality and law as the 20 March through 3 April elections to 
the St. Petersburg city assembly. 
  As we have already reported, in most of the districts not 
even a miserly 25 percent of voters went to the polling stations 
20 March. Matters were saved by the servicemen, whom A. Sobchak 
had first deprived of electoral rights and then later granted 
again. He used his own authority to extend the elections by a 
further 24 hours. The soldiers and cadets were led in orderly 
fashion to the ballot boxes but.... 
  A few days later the city electoral commission announced the 
figures: How many voters were on the lists and how many had 
gone to vote. It emerged that in approximately half the 
districts slightly more than 25 percent of citizens had turned 
out and consequently the second round of voting would be held 
here. Meticulous journalists nonetheless did a recount -- and 
did not get 25 percent. A day later the city electoral 
commission produced different, "improved," figures. Then 10 
electoral blocs, movements, and parties issued a joint statement 
demanding that the elections be considered invalid. 
Incidentally, the elections were "valid" almost exclusively in 
districts where members of the "Democratic Unity" bloc (a 
pseudonym of "Russia's Choice") were running and it was they 
who came out ahead. 
  The city prosecutor's office meanwhile lodged a protest at 
the results and Mayor A. Sobchak admitted on television that the 
elections were invalid but... immediately scheduled the second 
round of voting for 3 April. The city awaited with interest the 
decision of the city court, to which the city prosecutor's 
office had appealed, demanding that A. Sobchak's directive on 
extending the elections be repealed. The case seemed clear: 
The mayor had no right to extend the elections since the 
Russian president had authorized him to scheduled just one 
single day for them. In turn the mayor's side asserted: If he 
issued the statute on elections himself then he can make any 
amendments to it. The mayor's lawyers avoided the question of 
whether these amendments might contradict the president's edict. 
  The court decided they could. And it rejected the 
prosecutor's office's claim. The prosecutor's office lodged an 
appeal with the Russian Supreme Court. 
  Meanwhile the start of the second act had been announced. 
But a turnout of 25 percent at the polling stations was by no 
means compulsory 3 April. As the newspaper NEVSKOYE VREMYA 
wittily noted, in theory just one person could go to the polls, 
that would be enough. It cited interesting statistics from 
which it emerged that the overwhelming majority of St. 
Petersburg's population was quite unable to support the present 
authorities. 
  Thus the St. Petersburg authorities have done everything to 
ensure that the results of the elections, given a more serious 
attitude toward them on the part of the law enforcement organs, 
can be annuled at any moment.

  [Text] After the seminar held by the Cabinet of Ministers 
on the national programs, an extraordinary government session is 
due to be held at Jurmala this evening, at which an official 
statement by the Latvian Government will be adopted regarding 
the decree of Russian President Boris Yeltsin on creating 30 
military bases. As Latvian Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs stated 
at a news conference this evening, this step by Russia seizes on 
the intention not to allow the conclusion of a Latvian-Russian 
treaty on troop withdrawal. The premier explained that this 
action by Russia makes it practically impossible to conclude 
this treaty. 
  Such a step was to be expected from Russia, as the package 
of 
agreements is favorable to Latvia and guarantees Latvia's 
membership of Europe and the European Union, which is what 
Russia dislikes most of all. The Latvian premier believes that 
the document was adopted in the interests of Russia's 
conservative circles and under their influence, which, as is 
evident, concur with the interests of national radicals in 
Latvia. Birkavs explained that such action by Yeltsin is also 
unacceptable from the viewpoint of international law. Latvian 
Defense Minister Valdis Pavlovskis expressed the view that no 
military bases are in any sense necessary for Latvia. 
  Martins Virsis, leader of the Latvian delegation in the 
Latvian- Russian interstate talks, also said that this action by 
Yeltsin is contrary to documents already signed, and no such 
thing was envisaged in the text of the agreement. This is a new 
stance in Russian foreign policy, or it could also be viewed as 
pressure from Russian radical forces on the president of Russia. 
Virsis said he had consulted Zotov, leader of the Russian 
delegation, but at present not even he has access to any more 
precise information. Virsis also reported that consultations are 
being held with representatives of those countries that 
advocated concluding such a Latvian-Russian treaty. At present 
it can be predicted that if this decree is not revoked, then the 
Latvian-Russian treaty cannot be signed and ratified.

  [Text] Here is a comment from Foreign Minister Georgs 
Andrejevs on the news received today that Russia is trying to 
keep its military bases in our country. 
  [begin Andrejevs recording] At this time, after getting 
acquainted with this document, and discussing this document in 
the government, as well as talking with representatives of one 
or two other countries' governments, the impression arises that 
President Yeltsin has given in to the influence of more 
conservative forces in Russia, which have evidently come through 
the Ministry of Defence, putting forward such demands, or 
proposals, let us say for the present, knowing beforehand that 
they are not acceptable to Latvia, absolutely incompatible with 
either the letter or the spirit of the draft treaties, 
agreements, worked out long and hard, which have been initialled 
in Moscow, so that their signing will not take place at all 
[sentence as heard]. 
  That is how we have to interpret it, and all three essential 
things are included in (?the first line of) this order, namely: 
the establishment of military bases; the testing of new types 
of armaments on their territory; and the guaranteeing of the 
security of these countries mentioned, including the Republic of 
Latvia, to be undertaken by Russia; so, for all three of these 
announcements the Latvian Government makes its explanations. 
  We have never agreed to the development of these military 
bases in Latvia, as at present none of the military units has 
the status of a military base in Latvia. We have never allowed 
the testing of new types of Russian armaments. And we have not 
delegated to Russia the right to provide us here with security 
for this country in the event of another country's attack. 
  All this is mentioned in the statement adopted by the 
government, which will be read out in full on television as 
well. Tomorrow it is to be introduced to the envoys of 
countries accredited here, and of course in the press the full 
text will be [words indistinct]. [end recording]

  [Text] The government of the Republic of Latvia 
categorically states that it has not agreed, does not agree, and 
never will agree to the creation of a military base by the 
Russian Federation, nor to the testing of new armaments and 
military technology on Latvian territory, and it rejects any 
possibility of discussion on these issues, says a statement 
adopted at the extraordinary session of the Cabinet today 
concerning the decree signed by Russian President Boris Yeltsin 
on 5 April on the creation of Russian military bases in the CIS 
states and Latvia. 
  The statement says that the order of the Russian president 
sharply contradicts the draft treaties prepared by the Latvian 
and Russian delegations, initialled on 15 March, on troop 
withdrawal, and the order can be regarded as Russia's 
unwillingness to sign these treaties. The Latvian Government 
views this order as blatant bowing to pressure from the 
reactionary imperialist circles in Russia&gt;  It demands an 
explanation from the Russian Federation concerning this order, 
and it also demands again the withdrawal, without reservation, 
of all the Russian troops and military personnel who are 
illegally on Latvian territory. 
  Latvian State President Guntis Ulmanis also says in a 
statement that Yeltsin's announcement creates justified fears 
for the intended meeting of the Latvian and Russian presidents 
and the possible development of political dialogue. It does not 
testify to the stability of Russia's internal and external 
politics, and it reduces faith in Russia as a partner in 
treaties. In the past few hours Ulmanis has tried to talk with 
Leonid Mayorov, commander of the Baltic Military District, and 
the Russian president's administration, but he has received no 
reply. This proves a certain evasiveness about offering an 
explanation, the statement says. Latvia will never allow the 
creation of a Russian military base on its territory, Ulmanis 
says.

  [Excerpt] Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs has disclosed that 
on Wednesday he had a telephone conversation with Swedish Prime 
Minister Carl Bildt, in which the Swedish leader was cautious 
about the order from Russian President Boris Yeltsin [on 
establishing military bases], and expressed the supposition that 
Russia could revoke the document, as has repeatedly happened 
with Russian statements. At a news conference Birkavs said that 
recently Russia has adopted resolutions testifying to its 
unwillingness to normalize relations with Latvia: For example, 
it has decreed very unfavorable customs tariffs for mutual 
relations and high levies for the use of roads. [passage

  [Text] Riga, Apr 06, BNS -- Latvian Foreign Ministry 
demands that Russian Ambassador Aleksndr Rannikh gave by April 7 
explanations to Russian President Boris Yeltsin's April 5 order 
to set up military bases in several countries, including Latvia. 
  The Latvian Foreign Ministry protests against Russia's 
intentions to set up Russian army military bases in CIS states 
and Latvia to guarantee the security of the above mentioned 
states and Russia, as well as to test new arms and military 
equipment. Russia's decision contradicts with the agreement, 
reached during the Latvian-Russian interstate talks. 
  Yeltsin has ordered Russian Defense Ministry and other 
interested institutions to start talks with the CIS states and 
Latvia on signing the appropriate documents. 
  The Latvian Cabinet plans to hold an extraordinary meeting 
Wednesday [6 April] evening in Jurmala to adopt an official 
governmental announcement on Yeltsin's above mentioned order.

  [Text] As you know, a decree signed by the president of the 
Russian Federation, in which Boris Yeltsin agrees with a 
proposal from the Russian Defense Ministry to create military 
bases on the territory of CIS member states and in the Republic 
of Latvia, became known yesterday. The aim of the proposal is 
to ensure security of the Russian Federation and the 
above-mentioned countries, as well as to carry out tests for new 
kinds of armaments and military equipment. 
  Commenting on this reasoning, Latvian Foreign Minister 
Georgs 
Andrejevs stressed that at least on the part of Latvia nobody 
has asked for such a security guarantee and that the Russian 
Federation has no right to willfully take responsibility for 
Latvia's security. 
  The decree instructs the Russian Foreign Ministry, together 
with the Defense Ministry, to hold talks on this issue with the 
Republic of Latvia and to enshrine reached agreements in 
corresponding documents. 
  According to Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis, this decree 
contradicts the treaties initialed at the talks between the 
government delegations of the two countries and casts doubt on 
the Russian delegation's true intentions in the process of 
preparing the treaties. According to the state president's 
office, the Russian side's move is causing anxiety about a 
meeting scheduled to take place between the presidents of the 
two countries. 
  In a telephone conversation with [Latvian Prime Minister] 
Valdis Birkavs, Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt gave a 
cautious assessment of the Russian president's decree and voiced 
the assumption that Russia may rescind the document, as has 
already been the case many times with Russian statements. 
  A session of the security council took place at the 
Maikapara 
House this morning. At this moment, the Russian Embassy in 
Latvia is holding a news conference.

  [Text] Replying to a request from the Latvian Foreign 
Ministry for an explanation of Russia's intention to set up 
military bases in CIS member states and the Republic of Latvia, 
Aleksandr Rannikh, Russian ambassador to Latvia, said the 
Russian side is acting in accordance with the fact that all the 
issues related to the withdrawal of its troops from the 
territory of the Republic of Latvia, as well as the status of 
and the conditions for temporary functioning of the Skrunda 
radar station, were resolved in documents coordinated and 
initialed on 15 March this year. 
  According to the above-mentioned agreement, the Skrunda 
radar 
station is a Russian military facility under civilian control 
and cannot be regarded as a military base. 
  Commenting on President Yeltsin's decree of 5 April this 
year, Mr. Rannikh apologized, explaining that the text is due to 
a technical mistake.

  [Text] Riga April 7 TASS -- "There was a misunderstanding 
due to a technical error" and "this instruction has nothing to 
do with Latvia," said Russian Ambassador in Riga Aleksandr 
Rannikh, bringing his apologies to the Latvian side for 
technical errors, as a result of which wrong interpretation was 
made of the Russian president's instruction. 
  The ambassador stressed that "Moscow is guided by the fact 
that all issues connected with the withdrawal of troops from 
Latvia and with conditions of temporary operation and the status 
of the radar station in Skrunde, were settled in the documents 
initialled by the two countries' delegations on March 15". 
  The documents lay down that the radar station is a Russian 
military establishment, under civil control, and cannot be 
regarded as a military base. 
  At the same time, the ambassador expressed surprise that a 
xerox copy of the instruction saying about an alleged 
establishment of Russian military bases in Latvia, reached the 
Latvian Foreign Office quicker that the Russian Foreign Ministry. 
  "Such efficiency prompts some considerations," Rannikh said. 
Moscow will examine the incident, since it "is detrimental to 
our relations, which we regret," the ambassador stressed. 
  According to Rannikh, the incident which provoked a sharp 
reaction in Latvia, prompts a conclusion on the need for the 
earliest signing of the documents agreed in mid-March. 
  The Russian president's press secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov 
also made explanations at a news conference on Thursday. 
According to the press secretary, "the Russian side does not 
raise the question of deploying any bases in Latvia. The radar 
station in Skrunde cannot be regarded as a base. 
  "All issues connected with the withdrawal of Russian troops 
from Latvia were already settled in the Russian-Latvian 
agreement which was recently initialled."

responders asked whether the Saeima [parliament] should ratify 
the troop withdrawal agreement with Russia or not, 38.8 percent 
found it a necessity, 22.3 percent said it is possible, 13.5 
percent are against it and 25.4 percent of responders failed to 
answer. The comments upon the poll said the results promise 
vague hopes for the opponents of the agreement. Besides the 
support of ratification of the agreements among the native 
population is higher than that of the Russian-speakers.

  [Text] Riga, Apr 06, BNS -- The Latvian capital, Riga, 
will be cut off from heating and hot water supplies for four 
hours April 4 unless the local governments cover part of their 
debt to the Latvenergo enterprise by that date, Latvenergo 
President Gunars Koemecs. 
  The decision was taken in compliance with a resolution by 
the 
previous government, Koemecs said. 
  The heating supply won't be suspended to kindergartens, 
schools and nationally important institutions. 
  In total, local governments owe Latvenergo 19 million lats 
for the 1993-1994 heating season. In addition, local 
governments fixed lower heating tariffs (0.20 lats per square 
meter of floorspace) than the Board of Electric Energy and 
Heating Tariffs 0.38 lats per square meter of floorspace). 
  Latvenergo plans to meet with local leaders on April 12. 
  The enterprise has already cut heating to 63 consumers, hot 
water to 65 consumers and 359 consumers have been warned of the 
measures. 
  Latvenergo owes the Latvijas Gaze (Latvian Gas) enterprise 
60 
million lats for natural gas supplies. 
  Latvijas Gaze itself owes Russia 34.2 million USD. Russia 
has already warned the enterprise's management that its Gazprom 
consortium will stop pumping gas into the Latvian Incukalns 
container unless Latvijas Gaze covers the debt until May 1. 
  Latvijas Gaze plans to cover part of the debt with a 
23-million-dollar Japanese credit. Another 11 million USD could 
be collected from debtors, the enterprise's management said. 
Local consumers owed Latvijas Gaze 42.5 million lats on March 
20.

  [Text] Vilnius, Apr 06, BNS -- A successful development of 
economic relations between Lithuania and Russia is obstructed by 
political problems, the Lithuanian ambassador to Russia told the 
Vilnius-based Lietuvos rytas newspaper. 
  Romualdas Kozyrovicius said the main stumbling block in the 
development of economic relations is Russia's failure to ratify 
an agreement according to which the two countries would 
reciprocally grant the most favored nation trade status to each 
other. The agreement was signed in Vilnius last November. 
  The ambassador said a major political problem is that Russia 
links the ratification with the signing of a package of 
agreements concerning the Kaliningrad region. 
  Kozyrovicius emphasized that Lithuania still pays double 
export taxes to Russia which automatically leads to higher 
retail prices for Lithuanian goods. "This damages the interests 
of both states," the Lithuanian diplomat said. 
  Commenting on Russia's plans to ratify the treaty after a 
package of "Kaliningrad agreements" is signed with Lithuania, 
Kozyrovicius said the fact "causes worry" because no such 
conditions were made when Lithuanian and Russian premiers signed 
the treaty in Vilnius. "How can we speak about other agreements 
with Russia when it changes the terms so rudely." 
  The ambassador said a bilateral agreement on transit is 
under 
preparation, but Russia also wants to sign an agreement on 
military transit. In Kozyrovicius' view, there is no need to 
sign a military transit agreement because respective agreements 
would then have to be signed with Belarus, Latvia and even 
Poland. 
  The ambassador said the best solution for Lithuania would be 
to adopt a law on transit and to sign an agreement on 
settlements and payments. But Russia insists on a bilateral 
military transit treaty, he said. 
  In Kozyrovicius' words, Lithuania is concerned about the 
increasing concentration of military force in the Kaliningrad 
region. But the ambassador emphasized that the region 
rightfully belongs to Russia and Lithuania has no territorial 
claims. 
  Kozyrovicius said "observing how servicemen move to 
Kaliningrad from the Baltics, Germany and Russia," Lithuania 
will continue efforts to demilitarize this Russian enclave.

  [Text] Lithuanian-Russian economic relations are impeded by 
political reasons, Lithuanian Ambassador to Russia Romualdas 
Kozyrovicius maintains. 
  Russia has not yet ratified the treaty on trade and economy 
signed last fall granting the most favorable trade regime. In 
an interview to the daily LIETUVOS RYTAS [MORNING OF LITHUANIA], 
Kozyrovicius maintains that Russia does not intend to ratify 
this treaty until a packet of agreements on the Kaliningrad 
region have been signed. 
  According to the ambassador, when last fall the Russian and 
Lithuanian prime ministers signed the inter state economic 
treaty, there was no condition raised to Lithuania that the 
agreement coming into force was directly linked with the 
political agreement on the Kaliningrad region. 
  Speaking about new treaties with Russia, the draft treaty on 
transit through Lithuania to Kaliningrad was singled out by the 
Lithuanian ambassador. According to the ambassador there was no 
need to have such a treaty at all. He believes that it would be 
best if the Lithuanian Seimas could adopt a law on transit, 
which would embrace all the conditions. 
  Speaking about the agreements on the Kaliningrad region, 
Kozyrivicius stressed that the treaty should be of an inter 
state and not a geographical nature. At the same time the 
ambassador pointed out that the continuing militarization of the 
Kaliningrad region caused concern to Lithuania. He also 
stressed that Lithuania recognized all Russia's rights to this 
territory and that Lithuania had no claims.

<F P=106> [Vladas Burbulis report on interview with Lithuanian Prime </F>
Minister Adolfas Slezevicius; date and place not given: 
"Tallest Premier Wants To Be Self-Critical"] 
  [Text] March 31 marks a year since the day when the 
Lithuanian Seimas approved the program submitted by the 
country's sixth government. The 48-year-old Adolfas Slezevicius 
was then charged with heading the cabinet. Introducing him to 
their readers, the newspapers joked that the new premier and, 
consequently, the new Lithuania is just two centimeters short of 
complete happiness (Slezevicius is 198 cm tall). 
  The "boy" and his government have been in power for a year. 
What has been accomplished and what has not been? This 
ITAR-TASS correspondent put that question to the prime minister. 
  The premier preferred to be self-critical this time. We have 
been forced, he said, to make unpopular decisions. For 
instance, we could not keep buying gas from Russia at double the 
price at which it is sold in Lithuania, since our debt was 
snowballing. The same thing has been true of electricity, in 
order to ensure that its prime cost does not exceed the retail 
price. 
  [Burbulis] Has the current government made any mistakes 
which it has later had to correct? 
  [Slezevicius] Yes, it has taken a number of wrong steps 
which have damaged the economy and people. One of the most 
important and worrying problems is that of settlements between 
economic players, and mutual debts -- which currently stand at 
around 900 million litai (approximately $200 million). 
  [Burbulis] For the first time Lithuania's prime minister is 
also the chairman of the ruling party -- the Lithuanian 
Democratic Labor Party. How are these two jobs being combined? 
  [Slezevicius] I think that this is the democratic Western 
model for running a country -- when the party which wins the 
election forms the cabinet.

  [Text] Vilnius, April 6, ELTA -- Lithuanian Prime Minister 
Adolfas Slezevicius and Agricultural Minister Rimantas Karazija 
discussed the agricultural situation in Lithuania during a radio 
programme on Wednesday [6 April]. 
  They informed the listeners that there were about 110 
thousand farmers in Lithuania. A half of the total try hard to 
take maximum advantage of their land, others are waiting for the 
time when they will be able to rent or to sell their land at 
high price. 
  There are 200 thousand people who want to get their land 
back. There are 3 thousand agricultural enterprises. 
Unfortunately not all of them are economically strong, 11 
percent of them will fall apart by the end of the spring. 
  The officials warned that part of the land might remain 
unseeded this year. This firstly concerns the land which has no 
owners and there is nobody who could rent it. 
  According to the estimations made by Agricultural Ministry, 
the fuel for the seeding period alone will cost 100 million 
litas. Extra money should be raised to liquidate the debts of 
industrial enterprises. The sugar-refineries owe 46 million 
litas. It is believed that the agricultural plague will be 
reduced by the council for purchase and coordination of produce.

<F P=106> [Article by Juris Tubinis: "Lithuania: Kindred Spirits"] </F>
  [Text] Zhirinovskiy's brothers live in Lithuania. We are 
not talking about blood relatives, of course, but a kind of 
spiritual tie. Certain Lithuanian politicians are full of 
utterances which in essence are close to Vladimir Volfovich's 
ideas. These painfully familiar thoughts and ideas are 
obviously marked with the ethnic "quality stamp." And that is 
not all: Vladimir Volfovich's words reverberate because they 
carry from vast Russia, while similar utterances connected with 
the special interests of certain Lithuanian politicians are 
mainly well-known only within the borders of the tiny republic. 
  Fortunately, so far the ideas of the youth organization 
"Jaunoji Lietuva," for example, that "measures must be taken" to 
change the ethnic composition of the inhabitants of Vilnius, 
where Lithuanians account for only 52.5 percent, have not 
attracted any state support. The proposals made by "Jaunoji 
Lietuva" are as follows: In the near future, to give up the 
broadcasts in Russian and Polish which are relayed on Lithuanian 
state radio, to stop the immigration of Russians to Lithuania, 
and to adopt measures to ensure that university lectures are not 
read in Russian. All these ideas were voiced at a meeting with 
the republic's President A. Brazauskas. 
  But there is a topic that may cause as much of a stir as 
Zhirinovskiy's speeches, because it concerns something that is 
complex and important for the region's European policy -- the 
Russian enclave of Kaliningrad Oblast. Kaliningrad, which local 
"patriots" only call by its Lithuanian name, Karaliaucius, is 
one of the trump cards of the republic's national-radicals. At 
the meeting with the president, the youth organization's 
spokesman L. Antanavicius stated that....recognizing that 
Kaliningrad belongs to Russia creates danger for the Lithuanian 
state and a threat to the security of the Lithuanian nation. 
  A lot of people just smile at this: What can you expect from 
the spokesman of a youth organization? They are young, green, 
and irresponsible. But faint similar notes can be heard 
increasingly often in what serious Lithuanian politicians have 
been saying. Philosopher and Seimas Member R. Ozolas, for 
instance, believes that since the USSR has passed away, it has 
yet to be decided whether Russia should control this region.... 
  It is evidently no accident that the OPPOZITSIYA 
[Opposition] 
newspaper has also paid attention to the "Zhirinovskiy 
phenomenon in Lithuania," specifically owing to claims to an 
inalienable part of Russian territory. There are a lot of 
Zhirinovskiy's in Lithuania, the newspaper wrote with alarm. 
The young Lithuanians' appeal, "We Will Not Calm Down Until We 
Get Karaliaucius," was much publicized, particularly in Kaunas. 
The newspaper focused its attention on the fact that S. 
Lozoraitis, A. Brazauskas's former rival at the presidential 
elections, was supported by the majority of Lithuanian parties 
and movements, and, after all, it was specifically he who talked 
about "Lithuania's interests in Kaliningrad Oblast." 
  The republic's official authorities have gradually changed 
their stance in respect of the oblast from a neutral one -- let 
the process develop naturally, they said -- to a prejudiced one: 
They started saying traditional things at international level 
about the danger apparently emanating from Kaliningrad Oblast in 
connection with the Russian troops that are there. 
  But Zhirinovskiy's kindred spirits in Lithuania are not 
diplomatic at all. OPPOZITSIYA reported that a brochure written 
by someone by the name of J. Ramanauskasis is being circulated 
at enterprises and organizations in the city of Kaunas, and it 
expounds the policy tenets of the "Party of the Revival of the 
Forefathers." This party will strive to unite Lithuanians, 
Latvians, and Prussians (a nationality which disappeared several 
centuries ago) into a single nation by means of campaigning to 
unite all the lands of the forefathers from Karaliaucius to the 
Estonian border, from the upper reaches of the Daugava River and 
the Neman to Naugardukas and Brasta. 
  "Is he not a Lithuanian Zhirinovskiy?", the newspaper 
exclaims. "He does not ask the Latvians, or the hundreds of 
thousands of Belorussians, or the Russians in Kaliningrad." 
  "The musical [zamuzitsirovavshiysya] leader of the 
opposition 
is unable to refrain from making statements that Russia has no 
rights to Kaliningrad Oblast, while another similar politician, 
who has gone over the top in his philosophizing and who has 
moved from the center to the right, explains that the oblast 
should be divided up between Lithuania and Poland," OPPOZITSIYA 
cites these words from a letter from one of its readers. 
Another author draws attention with alarm to the fact that such 
notes can also be heard in speeches by an eminent politician 
from the party that is currently ruling in Lithuania, Seimas 
Member B. Genzialis. 
  According to an OPPOZITSIYA reader, whose opinion the 
newspaper cites in full, it is precisely because of such 
daydreams by certain Lithuanian politicians that the Kaliningrad 
YANTARNYY KRAY newspaper once expressed its opposition to the 
monument to Gerkus Mantus, leader of the uprising by the 
vanished tribe of Prussians against the crusaders, which has 
been erected. The reader believes that this reaction is not 
surprising if you recall the speeches that have recently been 
heard in Lithuania about "'the reunification' of Prussia"... 
  The Lithuanian Zhirinovskiy's do not understand how they are 
harming Lithuania, OPPOZITSIYA writes. As one of the letters 
says, "in a normal state the authors of such provocative 
statements and others like them would be taken to court if they 
were of sound mind, or they would be put into a psychiatric 
hospital if not." In the opinion of the newspaper, though, they 
are not that dangerous to the world, but they could bring a lot 
of misfortune on Lithuania....

  [Text] As of 1 April this year, Lithuania had 68,000 job 
seekers registered. Among them, unemployed people accounted for 
more than 28,500. Forty-four percent of the unemployed were 
recorded in big cities, while the remaining quota -- in the 
province. The rate of unemployment remained unchanged in 
comparison with last month -- 3.2 percent. Unemployed people 
included mostly workers and women. There were about 20 people 
competing for each job vacancy. 
  Specialists from the Lithuanian Labor Exchange claim that 
the 
official statistics do not reflect the actual situation on the 
labor market. According to them, it would be naive to believe 
in such a low unemployment rate when production turnout has 
dropped by 60 percent in the country over the past three years, 
and the previously prosperous enterprises producing machines and 
electronics have been moribund. For example, the hidden 
unemployment is masked when thousands of workers go on long 
unpaid leaves.

  [Text] ITAR-TASS reported Wednesday that "President Boris 
Yeltsin endorsed the proposal made by the Defense Ministry and 
cleared with the Foreign Ministry on the setting up of Russian 
military bases in CIS member states and in Latvia for the 
purpose of maintaining the security of the Russian Federation 
and the countries in question and testing for new military 
hardware." The agency said its source was the president's order 
to which it had obtained access. 
  Foreign Ministry spokesman Grigory Karasin told Interfax 
that 
to the best of his knowledge his ministry had had nothing to do 
with the preparation of that document. 
  Still, he said, the ministry would not be able to respond 
properly before the document mentioned in the ITAR-TASS report 
was thoroughly studied. 
  He placed special emphasis on the fact that "all military 
issues in the relations with Latvia were settled in the 
Russian-Latvian agreements that were initialed recently." 
  Under the agreements on the withdrawal of Russian troops 
that 
were initialed in Moscow in mid-March the Russian strategically 
important radar station in Skrunda will effectively remain "a 
Russian military establishment under civilian control" for a 
term of five and a half years and cannot be regarded as a 
military base. 
  Officials in the Defense Ministry's Press and Information 
Department told Interfax that Chief of General Staff Mikhail 
Kolesnikov had given no interview to ITAR-TASS and "could not 
talk about the setting up of a Russian military base in Latvia, 
as reported by that agency."

  [Text] Well-informed sources in Moscow say that the phrase 
about the formation of Russian military bases in CIS countries 
and Latvia was a result of an ambiguous expression that was 
later included in a Defense Ministry document and then copied to 
appropriate presidential statements. 
  "This technical mistake is being corrected", the source in 
the Kremlin said adding that "there is no hidden political 
meaning behind it."

president said on Thursday that Russia plans to build no 
military bases in Latvia. 
  "The issue of deploying any Russian bases on the territory 
of 
Latvia was not raised and does not exist. The radar station in 
Skrunda cannot be viewed as a military base. All issues 
connected with the withdrawal of Russian troops from Latvia have 
been solved in the Russian-Latvian agreement which has been 
initialled", Kostikov said in a statement. 
  On Wednesday a document received by TASS from the 
presidential administration said President Boris Yeltsin had 
okayed the proposal of the Defence Ministry to have nearly 30 
military bases in CIS countries and Latvia. 
  Kostikov said "explanations about a technical mistake, as a 
result of which Latvia was mentioned in the wrong context, will 
be provided by diplomatic channels".

  [Text] Pskov, 7 Apr -- The so-called "decision" on building 
Russian military bases in CIS states and Latvia came as a 
complete surprise for the Russian foreign political department, 
Andrey Kozyrev, head of Russian diplomacy, said here today. 
Nobody had agreed it with the Foreign Ministry. Andrey Kozyrev 
arrived in Pskov to meet Swedish Foreign Minister Margaretha af 
Ugglas, who is in Russia on a working visit. 
  According to the head of the Russian Foreign Ministry, the 
above document had caused a similar astonishment in the Defense 
Ministry, as well. "We do not need any bases in Latvia," he said 
quoting Pavel Grachev, defense minister, with whom he had spoken 
this morning. "There is an installation in Skrunda but it is not 
a military base, but a radio relay station for space monitoring."

  [Text] Representatives of the president and Defense 
Ministry have stated that the creation of Russian military bases 
on Latvian territory is not planned. As for the instruction of 
the Russian head of state, according to the explanations, a 
technical error crept into its text. 
  We remind you that this error provoked a loud reaction in 
Riga. Latvian officials have accused Moscow of imperial 
ambitions. 
  Meanwhile, according to an Interfax report, Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev, who came to Pskov today, has stated that the 
circumstances of the appearance of the said instruction of the 
president were strongly reminiscent of the so-called version No. 
1. 
  Kozyrev gives the assurance that neither he nor Defense 
Minister Grachev know from whence the instruction was taken or 
who agreed it with whom. 
  In the foreign minister's opinion, it is an attempt to set 
the president, government, Foreign Ministry, and Defense 
Ministry at loggerheads.

  [Text] As already reported, another diplomatic 
misunderstanding has arisen between Latvia and Russia in 
connection with the ITAR-TASS report of Russia's alleged desire 
to set up military bases in adjacent states including the 
Baltics. It turns out that the Russian Foreign Ministry has 
nothing in the least to do with this report. We contacted by 
telephone special envoy Sergey Sergeyevich Zotov, head of the 
state delegation at the talks with Latvia. This is what he said. 
  [Begin Zotov recording] At the state talks, the Russian side 
has never posed the question of keeping military bases in Latvia 
and we are not planning to pose such a question. The state 
delegation is working exclusively under the mandate of the 
president of the Russian Federation, and in keeping with this 
mandate we have finished the practical discussion of the whole 
set of questions connected with the withdrawal of troops. 
  Among the drafted and already initialed documents there is 
an 
agreement which concerns the legal status of the Russian radar 
station in Skrunda. But I want to stress that our radar station 
in this state agreement, which has already been approved by our 
country's president, is regarded as a military institution under 
civilian control. There can be no question of any bases. 
  Questions with Latvia in this regard have been fully settled 
between us and are determined by the texts of interstate 
treaties and agreements which have been drafted and are 
incidentally ready for signing at the highest level. [end 
recording] 
  [Announcer] To the question as to why absurd sensations of 
this kind appear in the press from time to time, the special 
envoy answered that this is due to bad, illiterate work by 
individual officials of the state apparatus, and it is their 
incompetence that leads to such misunderstandings in interstate 
relations.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Vladimir Taranov and Andrey </F>
Urban] 
  [Text] Moscow, 6 Apr -- "At the Russian-Estonian talks the 
work of the delegations of the two sides has stalled." This 
appraisal of the 18th round of the talks was given by Vasiliy 
Svirin, Russian Federation ambassador-at-large, who heads the 
Russian delegation. 
  "Numerous draft agreements and treaties are 'wandering' from 
one round of talks to another," he explained. "This means that 
a basis of relations, in the legal form of a treaty, between our 
states remains in embryo." 
  Vasiliy Svirin said the only positive outcome of the round 
in 
Moscow was the Estonian delegation's consent to resume 
discussion of the draft treaty on questions of citizenship. He 
said that Russia is hoping that the discussion of this document 
at subsequent rounds of the talks would be more dynamic. 
  The 18th round of Russian-Estonian talks was significant in 
that the Russian side extracted from the draft treaty on the 
withdrawal of troops from the republic's territory the date for 
the final withdrawal of the contingent of troops -- 31 August, 
without giving new timetables. This was stated today at a 
briefing at the Russian Foreign Ministry by Vaino Reinart, 
ambassador-at-large, head of the Estonian delegation at the 
talks. 
  "We cannot allow the final date for the withdrawal of troops 
to be linked with the signing of an agreement on social 
guarantees for pensioners from among the former Russian 
servicemen," the head of the Estonian delegation said. He 
stressed that during the course of the 18th round of talks 
Russia took a tougher line regarding its demands on the position 
of the Russian "military pensioners" in Estonia. These demands, 
he believes, were put in the form of an ultimatum and there was 
virtually no businesslike discussion to seek compromises.

  [Text] Moscow April 7 TASS -- The Russian Government has 
approved a draft agreement between the Russian and Latvian 
Governments on the social security of officers of the Russian 
Armed Forces, the Russian frontier guard troops and their 
families, staying temporarily on the territory of the Latvian 
Republic, until their complete withdrawal. The draft agreement 
was submitted by the Russian Foreign Ministry after being 
coordinated with the Russian Defence Ministry, the Federal 
frontier guard service and other ministries and institutions 
concerned, and was analysed in a preliminary way jointly with 
the Latvian side. 
  The Russian Foreign Ministry was assigned to sign the draft 
agreement on behalf of the Russian Government at the talks with 
Latvia after the two sides reach accord, and was allowed to make 
changes and amendments in it, which are not of principled 
importance.

<F P=106> [Video report by correspondent Aleksandr Khabarov; including </F>
recorded comments by Vasiliy Svirin, Russian envoy to the 
Russian-Estonian talks] 
  [Text] Today's round of talks between Russia and Estonia 
almost ended in a diplomatic squabble. Vasiliy Svirin, the head 
of the Russian delegation, maintains that the Estonian diplomats: 
  [Svirin] ...tried to accuse the Russian delegation of 
artificially seeking some kind of reasons that would allow 
Russia not to withdraw its troops from Estonia. The invention 
and groundlessness of such conclusions, I am convinced, are 
well-known. 
  [Khabarov] Russia really is refusing to give Estonia a 
detailed schedule for the withdrawal of its troops, but only 
because the Estonian side is not prepared to simultaneously sign 
an agreement on the social security of military pensioners 
remaining in Estonia. The talks are also barely making progress 
on other issues as well. 
  [Svirin] Today we were unable to initial a single document. 
  [Khabarov] The Estonian delegation was once again asked to 
begin discussions on the land border with Russia. If this does 
not happen Moscow intends to unilaterally reinforce its borders. 
Russian Foreign Ministry representatives would like to hear a 
reply to this warning at the next, 19th round of talks. 
  According to preliminary information the next meeting 
between 
Russian and Estonian diplomats will take place at the beginning 
of May in Tallinn. So, if this round of talks has finished like 
the majority of the others in failure, then the Russian 
diplomats can be sure of one thing at least -- that rooms have 
already been booked for them in a Tallinn hotel.

Ministry Andrey Kozyrev will not only sign the basic document on 
Russia's joining NATO's Partnership for Peace program but will 
submit the so called presentation document. Russia will present 
its point of view regarding cooperation and partnership with 
NATO and will point out concrete directions of this cooperation, 
Director of RF [Russian Federation] Foreign Ministry's European 
Cooperation Department Yuriy Ushakov declared in his interview 
with Interfax on Wednesday. 
  Ushakov explained that out of all 14 countries which 
expressed their willingness to join the Partnership for Peace 
program only Poland had presented such practical documents. 
"Other countries have not submitted any presentation documents 
because they are probably not ready yet," said Ushakov. 
  In his words, Russia's cooperation with NATO in the 
frameworks of the Partnership program should be "of a special 
character." "It should take into consideration Russia's role on 
the international arena and our military might as a nuclear 
power," explained Ushakov.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Kuznechevskiy report under the "Visit" rubric: </F>
"Economic Pragmatism Proves Stronger"] 
  [Text] The UN secretary general's almost week-long stay in 
Moscow ended with certain political wishes of the Russian 
leadership being met, but it did not settle a question which was 
one of the main ones as far as the hosts were concerned: 
Butrus-Ghali refused to back Moscow in its endeavor to gain the 
status of UN peacemaking forces for the Russian Armed Forces on 
the territory of the former USSR. 
  About two months ago, the heads of the Russian Federation 
foreign policy and military departments, who had hitherto more 
often been competitors and rivals in determining the state's 
foreign policy priorities, expressed a joint position on an 
important question, and were also able to sway the president, 
who is more used to them arguing with each other, to their side. 
The issue concerned the desire to give the status of UN 
peacemaking forces to the Russian military units stationed on 
the territory of the former Union republics of the USSR. 
  You might think: Why is this celebrated status, which in 
principle changes nothing, so needed, given the essence of the 
matter? Even without the approval of the United Nations, 
Russian troops have defused the bloody strife between Kishinev 
[Chisinau] and Tiraspol, prevented marauding groups from 
destroying the population of South Ossetia, are restraining 
Afghan aggression in Tajikistan, are ready to stop the shooting 
between Tbilisi and Gudauta, and so on. Especially since both 
the United Nations and the U.S. Administration are in theory 
already inclined toward recognizing the greater part of the 
expanse of the former USSR as a sphere of Russia's vital 
interests. 
  Meanwhile, a problem does exist, and indeed a fairly 
substantial one. 
  First of all, of course, there are the political dividends. 
It is one thing to recognize the geographic area around Russia 
as a sphere of its vital interests de facto, and entirely 
another to do the same thing de jure. In practical terms, this 
would mean to actually revive Russia's great power status with 
all the ensuing consequences (I will not get involved in 
decoding this thesis now). 
  Second, there is another reason, a purely economic one. 
Operations in the former USSR republics cost the Ministry of 
Defense rather a lot. And the military department's budget is 
already being cut by the government and the Federal Assembly 
from one year to the next. Announcing UN status for the Russian 
peacemaking forces would in many regards remove this problem, as 
payment for these operations would be subsidized to a 
significant extent by the UN budget. Thus Pavel Grachev's 
department has an obvious interest in settling the question. 
  But the Russian Federation foreign policy department is 
equally interested in settling this question. During 1994 
Russia has run up a debt of $68 million to the basic UN budget. 
Apart from that, debts for previous years run to 442 million, 
and there is also the 49 million owed to the budget for 
peacemaking operations for 1994. In all, according to 
Butrus-Ghali, Russia's total debt runs to $628 million, which 
makes it the second largest debtor after the United States. 
  All the indications are that Andrey Kozyrev's department has 
assumed that if it proved possible to put into practice the idea 
of giving Russian peacemaking forces in the former USSR 
republics the status of UN forces, then part, and indeed a 
significant part, of the Russian Federation's debt to the United 
Nations would be paid off in this way. 
  Judging by everything, Butrus-Ghali is also perfectly well 
aware of this, and so all he decided to do during the talks in 
Moscow was to recognize the fact that Moscow may participate in 
peacemaking operations in the aforementioned regions without 
special coordination with the United Nations and in parallel 
with UN actions, and even to link its troops with UN forces in 
hot spots; but no more than that. 
  Thus, for the time being, Moscow has failed to improve its 
financial affairs at the United Nations' expense. It can only 
be hoped that the last word has nevertheless not yet been said 
in the discussion on this subject, and that the Russian Foreign 
Ministry and Ministry of Defense will nevertheless find 
additional arguments in favor of a solution to the 
aforementioned problem which may satisfy both sides.

  [Text] Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin has 
reaffirmed his government's intention to press for Russia's 
incorporation into the Group of Seven (G7) to make it a "Group 
of Eight." 
  Russia will raise the matter at the next G7 summit in 
Naples, 
Chernomyrdin told a U.S. congress delegation in Moscow on 
Wednesday, government spokesman Valeriy Grishin said. He said 
the American delegation, headed by Republican minority leader 
Richard Gephardt, had expressed support for Russia's plan. 
  Chernomyrdin also said his government was not putting all 
its 
hopes on foreign loans. He said the $1.5-Bn credit the 
International Monetary Fund had recently agreed to give Russia 
was mainly a political matter. He said there were those in the 
United States who sought to restrict Russia's access to the 
world market and undermine its role there. What Russia wants is 
not easy terms but equal partnership in trade, he said. 
  Grishin said that at the meeting, held behind closed doors, 
the U.S. delegation had expressed support for the Chernomyrdin 
government's policy of reform and that Gephardt had promised to 
make a public appeal to America's business community "not to be 
afraid to invest in the Russian economy."

  [Text] Moscow April 6 TASS -- Russian Prime-Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin today met the leaders of the United Technologies 
Company, U.S. to discuss aspects of a series production of the 
Russian wide-body airliner IL-96M with American Pratt &amp; 
Whitney 
engines. 
  The discussion centered around the organisation of joint 
Russian-American enterprise on the basis of AO Permskiye Motoriy 
(Perm Engines Joint-Stock Company) for the mass production of an 
aviation engine. The new engine, based on the Russian PS-90 
will be installed on the IL-96M liners capable of carrying 380 
passengers and on other new Russian aircraft. 
  The Russian-American engine will be built using the best 
technologies designed in the two countries. Ten IL-96M 
airliners equipped with jointly produced engines have already 
been ordered by 10 foreign and 30 Russian airlines. The new 
engines are expected to be considerably cheaper and 
technologically more advanced than the Pratt &amp; Whitney 
engines.

<F P=106> [Undated letter from Candidate of Historical Sciences Ivan </F>
Bondarev, followed by editorial office note, under the "Reader's 
Response" rubric: "Is It Not Worth Our Generals' While Holding 
Exercises in the State of Iowa?"] 
  [Excerpts] In the 20th century the United States has 
repeatedly tried to get a foothold on Russian territory. 
[passage omitted] 
  Why recall the past?, you may ask. Whoever recalls the 
past.... Unfortunately, there are grounds for reminders. The 
mass media are reporting on preparations for military exercises 
in Orenburg Oblast for Russian troops with U.S. troops 
participating. The preparations are in full swing. Brigadier 
General Leonard Holder Jr., commander of the U.S. 3d Infantry 
Division, has already visited Orenburg in the role of 
quartermaster. Russian and U.S. Defense Ministers P. Grachev 
and W. Perry have met in Moscow. It is not hard to guess what 
was discussed. 
  Specialists are arguing over how many U.S. military 
personnel 
are coming to Russia and what hardware they are bringing with 
them. Meanwhile it is quite clear that the generals will be 
accompanied by an army of advisers, umpires, interpreters, and 
support personnel. 
  First, there are many facilities in the South Urals and 
Volga 
Valley region where the gaze of outsiders is undesirable. 
"Friendship is friendship, but it's every man for himself when 
it comes to tobacco," according to the Russian proverb. 
Furthermore, the Americans make no secret of the fact that 
their foreign intelligence service is operating even in their 
allies' states. 
  Second, Russians have to receive and accommodate the U.S. 
generals with their vast retinue. Meanwhile we are experiencing 
a shortage of everything. It is said that the Americans will 
pay for everything. This is suspicious. They are so keen to 
get into Russia that they are not counting the cost. 
  It has been announced that the purpose of the exercises is 
to 
rehearse collaboration between the two states' armies in the 
event of an attack by a third force. But who is threatening us? 
Where is this third force which the Russian Army would not be 
able to oppose independently? There is something else at work 
here. 
  Representatives of Russia's military department are 
hurrying. 
It is is not understood exactly why: Whether they are afraid to 
be late in joining the world community's "Partnership for Peace" 
or whether they cannot count on winning in the event of another 
storming of the White House. The Pentagon's generals are also 
hurrying. The interest is mutual. Which is why it would have 
been advisable to hold the joint exercises in the United States, 
where society is more stable and where there is a better supply 
of food and petroleum oils and lubricants. But as far as is 
known the question of holding the exercises on U.S. territory 
has not been raised or discussed by anybody. Is this an 
accident? I think not. 
  At one time the United States supplied Russia with canned 
stewed meat and corn seeds and gave advice on how to develop 
Russia, credits, and aid. Of course, it gave all this not for 
nothing but on an interest basis, and bought up shares in the 
most profitable sectors of the economy. In short, U.S. 
ownership started to appear on Russian territory. The problem 
of protecting this ownership arose. The Americans' desire to 
stick their bayonets into and raise their flag in the most 
vulnerable area of vast Russia cannot be explained any other way.

  The article by Major General (Retired) V. Chudov entitled 
"Our Strategists Are Too Unsophisticated" (PRAVDA, 16 March 
1994) provoked an avalanche of letters to the editorial office. 
The general impression is that the decision on joint 
Russian-U.S. command and staff exercises is hasty and 
ill-considered and dangerous for Russia's future. 
  Maj. Gen. Chudov's viewpoint is shared by the author of the 
published letter, as well as by readers I. Batsik, P. Borisov, 
V. Goryachev, A. Babenko, S. Kuznetsov, and others.

<F P=106> [Stanislav Kondrashov article: "United States' `New </F>
Approach' to Russia in Light of Ukrainian Elections"] 
  [Text] Next year over one-half of all U.S. aid earmarked 
for the "heirs" of the USSR will be going not to Russia as it is 
now, but to other members of the CIS. Although this is economic 
aid, this shift is dictated by politics, the rudiments of a 
different U.S. strategy that has not as yet been formulated 
clearly enough. 
  The "new approach" to Russia that has been developing since 
last December concerns both the situation within Russia and its 
behavior in the "post-Soviet area." The aspirations nurtured by 
some of the U.S. establishment to act as trailblazers en route 
to the market economy of the future have virtually vanished into 
thin air, and U.S. aid -- if you compare it to the extent of the 
crisis in Russia and the tasks that lie ahead -- is paltry. But 
Washington remains Moscow's main strategic interlocutor outside 
the CIS, and the "new approach" needs scrutiny especially since, 
even in the early stages, it appears to be flawed due to 
inadequate understanding of the situation whereby trends toward 
integration are confused with imperialism. If this confusion is 
not avoided in time, the "new approach" will have to be adjusted 
like the old one. 
  So, within Russia the Clinton administration has distanced 
itself from Gaydar's radical-democrat school, ceased to 
associate the future of economic reform and Russian democracy 
with him and him alone, and to all intents and purposes 
acknowledged Premier Chernomyrdin as a reformer and leading 
contender for the post of president. While maintaining all the 
necessary relations with the Russian head of state, it is 
stealthily performing the delicate task of ensuring continuity 
of the new-type U.S.-Russian relations in the post-Yeltsin era. 
There is every indication that people in Washington are growing 
accustomed to the idea that this time is not far off. 
  Another aspect of the "new approach" concerns the U.S. 
attitude to the nearby foreign countries. Here too, relatively 
speaking, they have stopped putting all their eggs in the 
Yeltsin basket. The "counterbalance" of U.S. economic aid is the 
response to the stepping up and tightening of Russia's policy in 
neighboring countries -- the former Soviet republics. This is 
eliciting more and more questions and growing misgivings in the 
United States. That which all politicians in Moscow across the 
board, including the foreign minister, call Russia's legitimate 
"special interests," is generally qualified by people in 
Washington as recurrences of "imperial ambitions." People there 
would like to warn Russia by paying additional signs of 
attention to those post-Soviet states which are the targets of 
"imperial ambitions." This too is an extremely tricky 
diplomatic task -- these signs must be noticeable otherwise they 
become pointless, but not provocatively noticeable so as not to 
further rouse Moscow "imperialists." 
  Mindful of this, official Washington received the leaders of 
Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Georgia in February and March. 
Likewise, Clinton gave Shevardnadze the go-ahead for the idea 
of deploying UN peacekeeping forces in Abkhazia...on condition 
that an agreement is concluded between the Georgians and the 
Abkhazians and that U.S. servicemen are categorically excluded 
from these forces. William Perry, the new U.S. secretary of 
defense, carried out a tour under the slogan of a new "pragmatic 
partnership," starting in Moscow and then visiting Alma-Ata 
[Almaty], Kiev, and Minsk, announcing an increase in U.S. aid, 
primarily for nuclear disarmament. 
  Despite the cautious nature of the "new approach," one 
initially glimpses a failure to understand certain fundamental 
and seemingly obvious things. That is to some extent excusable 
since it was inspired by the Russian side. 
  People are talking, for instance, about the end of the 
"honeymoon" between Russia and the United States. But was there 
one at all? If you think about it, there was not a "marriage" 
with the United States but a "divorce" between Russia and the 
USSR, the Russian leadership and the Union leadership, and the 
"divorce" went hand in hand with a "romance" with the United 
States since Yeltsin and the democrats used the West's political 
backing against Gorbachev and against preserving the "imperial" 
union. 
  The "honeymoon" lasted as long as the amnesia over our own 
national interests. It is not the "honeymoon" that is now over, 
but the amnesia. In fact, it is impossible to divorce ourselves 
from the fundamental geopolitical realities of Russian existence 
in Eurasia and in this regard Russia is bound to inherit some of 
the interests of the Soviet superpower and the Russian empire 
especially since the main material justification for Russia's 
great power status -- nuclear weapons -- was also the legacy of 
the Soviet Union. 
  Tens of millions of people have been plunged into a new 
historical era and they are behaving not quite or not at all as 
the politicians who did the plunging would like. The people 
formulating the "new approach," leaving aside this basic fact, 
should look at the democracy of the ballot box, which now seems 
different from that of the speeches made by politicians elected 
previously. 
  The latest example being the Ukrainian elections, where 
inhabitants of eastern oblasts and the Crimea voted by an 
overwhelming majority in favor of union with Russia. So are 
they voicing solidarity with Moscow's "imperial ambitions"? Who 
else but Washington should realize that general democratic 
elections are the main act and irrevocable verdict of democracy 
(until the next elections take place). Unlike presidents, 
ordinary people speak rarely but, when they do, what they say is 
to the point and weighty, based not on speculative concepts but 
on their own future. 
  However, the CIA guessed this result, predicting in a recent 
secret report the possibility of Ukraine breaking into two 
states over the dispute between the western part geared to the 
West and the eastern oblasts with their leaning toward Russia. 
And it did not ascribe this to Moscow's machinations. 
  Needless to say, it would be the height of folly for Moscow 
to promote the worsening of the intra-Ukrainian confrontation 
but surely Kiev's politicians are primarily responsible for 
finding a peaceful and constructive solution to the situation 
through Ukrainian federalism, say, and closer links with Russia? 
  In a recent programmatic article in the FOREIGN AFFAIRS 
journal, Zbigniew Brzezinski declared that a U.S.-Russian 
partnership would be premature and suggested an alternative 
policy of "geopolitical pluralism," which means curbing Russia's 
imperial instincts by developing relations with the "new 
independent states." Brzezinski came up with a "simple but 
indisputable axiom: Russia can either be an empire or a 
democracy but it cannot be both." That is an example of the 
rigid rule that is easily construed by an outsider. The 
well-known conceptualist even sees Russia's confederative 
relations with Ukraine as a roundabout victory for Russian 
"imperialism." But the sentiments voiced during the elections 
in eastern Ukraine and the Crimea illustrate that democracy 
Brzezinski-style is a procrustean bed for millions of people 
even if they opted to lie on it by voting in favor of Ukrainian 
independence in the 1991 referendum by a majority. 
  Former President Richard Nixon is more of a pragmatist than 
a 
conceptualist and is not that keen on rules. During his recent 
10th visit to Moscow he found the claims that Russia is once 
again becoming an "imperialist power" "exaggerated." In Nixon's 
opinion most Russians and their leaders are opposed to "fresh 
adventures" and are unwilling to even "take economic 
responsibility for the other new independent states." 
  At the same time he warned that any attempts by Moscow to 
"destabilize" Ukraine will have "destructive consequences for 
Russian-U.S. relations" since "Ukrainian stability is in the 
U.S. strategic interests." 
  Indisputably such attempts would also be ruinous for Russian 
stability, placing an intolerable burden on its already 
extremely frail shoulders. But here too it is no good failing 
to take life's complexities into consideration. Are the 
Ukrainian elections part of Moscow's attempts to destabilize 
Ukraine? Will the Kiev leadership's disregard for the results 
of these elections, which revealed mass resistance to severing 
the close economic, cultural, and human ties with Russia, be in 
the interests of Ukrainian stability? This notwithstanding, can 
U.S. "strategic interest" in Ukraine be ensured? 
  I think that Nazarbayev, if not Kravchuk, has already 
answered these questions -- as regards Kazakhstan. He used his 
stay in Moscow to proclaim his vision of the future from the 
Moscow State University rostrum -- a Eurasian union throughout 
the post-Soviet area apart from the Baltic countries (or at 
least covering Russia and Kazakhstan) with a common parliament, 
single citizenship, joint armed forces, and close economic 
coordination. In the different Soviet conditions the idea of a 
Eurasian union was advocated by Andrey Sakharov, if you recall, 
as an idea for the democratic transformation of the totalitarian 
superstate. It is now being revived amid the chaos, ashes, and 
disorder of devastation. 
  As a politician who is better aware of our common realities 
than the Americans, Nazarbayev does not absolutize the concept 
of independence. Reasonable interdependence can be a guarantee 
of reasonable, democratically sufficient independence and 
stability. Nazarbayev the dialectician opposes dual citizenship 
but is in favor of single, common citizenship. He is in favor 
of U.S. cooperation in the running of Baykonur in order to 
haggle over leasing the cosmodrome...with Russia. 
  But by the strictest criteria the Kazakhstani president 
needs 
good relations with the power on the other continent in order to 
regulate and strengthen good relations with his immediate great 
neighbor with the common destiny and to force this neighbor to 
get a move on. And this is no paradox but the call of 
geopolitics. 
  On the other hand, if stability, above all nuclear stability 
(what else?) is primarily the U.S. strategic priority in the 
post-Soviet area the "new approach" should have its supertask. 
The avowed counterbalance of aid for Russia's neighbors ("over 
one-half") is politically justified if it helps find a 
reasonable measure and link between independence and 
interdependence and places confederative (or federative!) 
relations between the former republics, with Russia, and with 
the center (not the imperial center!) in the form of Russia on a 
new voluntary footing. Only then can lasting partnership 
relations between Russia and the United States have a future.
