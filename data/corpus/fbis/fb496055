  [Text] Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk today took part 
in the second round of the election to the Supreme Council of 
Ukraine. After taking part in the election, the head of state 
granted an interview to representatives of the Ukrainian and 
foreign mass media. You are invited to listen to a report filed 
by our correspondent Eduard Kotenko. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified journalist] Leonid 
Makarovych, as head of our state and its citizen, how do you 
envisage the newly elected Supreme Council, if it is elected 
today? 
  [Kravchuk] There is such a notion in statistics and in 
sociology as insufficiency of data required for analysis. 
Because sociologists take either 1,000 or 1,500 respondents 
[pauses] ... It has its own laws. 
  Well, 90 deputies have been elected by now. At the previous 
election we elected, as far as I remember, five out of 33 and 
now we have elected four out of 16. Well, they failed to elect 
approximately 25 percent of candidates altogether, 20 to 25 in 
all. If we apply this figure to the coming elections, 25 percent 
is not the kind of figure that would enable one to say that the 
Supreme Council will not be elected. At present, we should 
speak not about whether or not the Supreme Council will be 
elected, but what will be the first steps of the new Supreme 
Council, so as to create law-governed and responsible 
authorities. 
  And I think the Supreme Council should gather, and the 
deputies, because it is they who are responsible [words 
indistinct], should adopt at least three laws: On the status of 
the president, on delegating plenary powers, and on a mechanism 
of subordinating lower-ranking bodies of the executive power to 
higher-ranking bodies of power [words indistinct]. 
  Then the election, if it does take place and if those laws 
are adopted [pauses] ... People will know whom they elect and 
what [words indistinct] enjoy. If we fail to do this at once, 
we will create a source of conflict between the representative 
bodies of power and the elected president. He will then say: 
Good people, I was elected legitimately as head of state and 
head of the executive power. And on which grounds are you 
depriving me of these plenary powers? This often happened to 
me: First I was granted powers, then I was deprived of them. 
  Well, we somehow managed to find a common language. But if 
everything boils down to confrontation, we will again begin with 
what we finished up and we will produce nothing new. This is a 
question of principle, a question of principle, indeed. I only 
want a legitimate, law-governed Supreme Council to be elected, 
based on laws, responsibility, reason, and the real situation. 
I would like it to be an authority which assumes control and 
works for reforms, for democracy, and for our independent state, 
and that it will work on the basis of the law and not on good 
wishes only. [end recording] 
  [Announcer] That was an interview Ukrainian President Leonid 
Kravchuk granted at his polling station during the second round 
of the election to the Supreme Council of Ukraine. The report 
was filed by correspondent Eduard Kotenko.

<F P=106> [Statement by the Ukrainian Presidential and Cabinet of </F>
Ministers Press Service] 
  [Text] The Ukrainian president receives appeals from 
believers of different faiths saying that at present, especially 
during the Supreme Council elections, various political forces 
seek to use the authority of the church for their own purposes. 
This inevitably leads to an exacerbation of the situation, 
complicated as it already is. 
  In this regard, the Ukrainian president expressed his point 
of view on this issue. 
  Now, when the Ukrainian people are building their 
independent 
and unified state under extremely difficult political and 
economic conditions, each and every citizen must realize that 
the state-building process should be conducted based on 
democracy and normal human relations, regardless of convictions 
or creed. 
  The state guarantees equal rights and freedoms to all 
citizens, regardless of their religious beliefs. According to 
present Ukrainian legislation, interference on the part of any 
state institutions or political groupings in the internal 
affairs of the church is inadmissible. Particularly dangerous 
for all of society are attempts by illegal military groups to 
resolve interfaith problems using violent methods. 
Unfortunately, such cases were reported in the past and 
included among others, forcible takeovers of temples and their 
property. This kind of illegal action should be controlled by 
relevant state institutions responsible for applying resolute 
actions to head off and stop conflicts. 
  One should understand that the church performs very special 
functions which cannot be performed by any other state or public 
institution. It instills the most fundamental human values -- 
spirituality, compassion, sensitivity, and love for our fellow 
man. This is what its unique role in society is all about. 
  The present religious strifes, kindled by certain political 
forces, destabilize the situation in Ukraine. And all this is 
happening at an historic time, when we are in so much need of 
unity, consolidation of all patriotic forces, and civil accord. 
  This cannot help but worry the president, because peace 
among 
religions is an important condition for peace in society and a 
successful state-building process. Relations between church and 
state should be based on present Ukrainian laws and take into 
consideration the canonical teachings of all churches. 
  The president instructed local executive bodies to ensure 
strict compliance with all Ukrainian laws regarding the church, 
and held them responsible for the consequences of any illegal 
actions on the part of separate individuals and political 
groupings that stir up religious strife and increase tensions in 
society.

  [Text] Ivan Plyushch, chairman of the Supreme Council of 
Ukraine, voted today at his polling station in the Tsentralnyy 
electoral district in Kiev. At journalists' request he answered 
several questions, in particular, those dealing with the urgent 
tasks facing the new parliament of Ukraine and the future of the 
Commonwealth of Independent States. 
  [Begin Plyushch recording] Urgent steps should be taken to 
form a government which will take upon itself full executive 
power and get down to what we call the stabilization of our 
socioeconomic situation. 
  The urgent task, therefore, is to elect the head of the 
government, to determine that he will be head of the executive 
power -- I am in favor of a prime minister being head of the 
executive power -- and charge him with forming his team within 
the shortest possible period of time and getting down to 
fulfilling his duties. 
  If this is done in parliament, the next issue will be to 
introduce amendments into the law on the president, and 
determine what kind of president Ukraine will need in future. 
After that it will be necessary to pass the law on the plenary 
powers of local bodies of power, in other words, the law 
delimiting powers between the central executive power bodies and 
local bodies; work toward that end is already being done by the 
standing commissions of the current parliament. That is to say, 
the next step should be to solve the issue of local regional 
self-management and self-government. People in all oblasts have 
already understood that there must be no dyarchy, and they want 
and dream that the coming election in June will allow the 
formation of representative executive bodies and make 
territories controllable and manageable. 
  The CIS is necessary. From the very first day, Ukraine has 
been within the CIS and today remains within the CIS. The CIS 
will work as a Commonwealth of Independent States only when all 
states want it to. For Ukraine alone to wish this would be far 
from enough. If we had examples to show, as it probably seems 
to some, that Ukraine has no full confidence in this 
Commonwealth and hence the results in Ukraine [as heard], why 
are there no results in those states which do have full 
confidence? Take Kazakhstan and Russia, for example. They have 
so much faith in each other that they consider themselves to be 
in the closest possible [word indistinct]; however, the results 
are the same. 
  This is why I favor the idea that [pauses] ... For example, 
you remember that when we considered this issue in parliament I 
read out a letter, an appeal to the Ukrainian parliament, from 
[Yuriy] Shafranik, Russian minister of fuel and energy. There 
has been little change since then. Specific steps are being 
taken on the part of Ukraine, and you know that our Ukrainian 
Construction Ministry has concluded agreements according to 
which about 50,000 Ukrainian builders will work in Russia, 
primarily at the Yamal and Surgut deposits. Our builders have 
gone further; they will work not only at those deposits but have 
already reached Krasnodar and Stavropol regions. And they 
already have advantageous options. 
  Generally speaking, when they say that the construction 
complex is ruined [pauses] ... In reply to a question, the 
construction minister told me that 16,000 people have left their 
concerns over the past two years, but 500,000 are ready to 
fulfill any programs. That is to say, money is needed. 
  I believe the CIS is necessary as a commonwealth. We should 
not lose the market under any circumstances. As for the 
question of integration, it must be brought to a higher level, a 
cut above. In the construction complex this is normal. There 
are other (?industries) as well. Otherwise, people in Surgut, 
Yamal and other northern regions of Russia would be concerned, 
because they have no work there already. And if they have no 
work there, they will come back to Ukraine. And where can you 
immediately find work here? You know that in such localities, 
like Zhovtnevyy and others, 40, 50, or even 60 percent of the 
population are Ukrainians. 
  Therefore, for a whole number of reasons the CIS is 
necessary, and I know that in the near future there will be 
another meeting at chief of state level, and our president, 
Leonid Makarovych [Kravchuk], is going there with a whole 
package of proposals concerning the further integration of our 
national economy complex with the other countries. [end 
recording] 
  [Announcer] You have been listening to an interview by Ivan 
Plyushch, chairman of the Ukrainian Supreme Council, which he 
granted at his polling station. In reply to requests by 
journalists, he answered several questions, in particular, those 
concerning the urgent steps of the new parliament of Ukraine and 
the future of the Commonwealth of Independent States.

  [Text] Kiev April 10 TASS -- As of 19:00 local time (20:00 
Moscow time) on Sunday, Ukraine's parliamentary elections can be 
declared valid in nearly all regions of the republic. 
  Apart from 21 regions and the Crimean peninsula, where 
turnout proved to be far above 50 per cent, the required number 
of eligible voters came to the polls in the Khmelnitskiy and 
Cherkassyy regions. Thus, the validity of today's polls remains 
undecided only in the Odessa region, Kiev and Sevastopol, 
according to UKRINFORM news agency. 
  Election results will be available after preliminary 
counting 
of votes. For the Ukrainian parliament to function normally, at 
least 300 deputies should be elected to the 450-seat supreme 
legislature.

since it comprises a constitutional majority. 
  Deputies elected in the second round of voting include 
Ukraine's Acting Prime Minister Yefim Zvyahilskyy, Deputy Prime 
Ministers Mykola Zhulynskyy and Valentyn Landyk, and well-known

  [Text] Over 54 percent of the electorate voted in the 
runoffs held in Kharkov. Elections were invalid in Vyzovskiy, 
Moskovskiy, and Saltovskiy constituencies due to a low turnout. 
In Dzerzhinskiy constituency neither of the candidates received 
the required number of votes. The elected deputies include 
Volodymyr Hrynyov (Inter-Regional Bloc of Reforms), Mykola 
Koshlyakov, secretary of the oblast Communist Party committee, 
Oleh Dyomin, vice president of the UkrSibInkor association, 
Oleksandr Karpov, a lecturer of the city's State University, and 
Oleksandr Chornousenko, head of the Kharkov Oblast branch of the 
Security Service. 
  Elections were valid in all of the 17 Zaporozhye Oblast 
constituencies. In Zhovtnevyy and [name indistinct] 
constituencies of Zaporozhye city, the winners are Yuriy 
Syzenko, a worker of Zaporozhye electric wagon repair plant, and 
Viktor Ponedilok, a scientist of Zaporozhye Technical University. 
  Our Chernigov Oblast correspondent reports that elections 
were valid in all of the oblast's constituencies. The average 
turnout in the oblast was 73 percent, while in Chernigov city it 
was just over 50 percent. 
  In Vinnitsa Oblast, people's deputies were elected in 11 out 
of 16 constituencies which held runoffs yesterday. They include 
Hryhoriy Nedvyha, an engineer of the locomotive depot, Yevhen 
Smyrnov, a stage director at Narodnyy Theater, Mykhaylo 
Parasunko, deputy minister of agrarian policy and foodstuffs, 
and Oleksandr Stoyan, chairman of Ukraine's Federation of 
Independent Trade Unions. 
  Our Odessa correspondent reports that over 62 percent of the 
electorate voted in the oblast. In Odessa, the highest turnout 
was in Zhovtnevyy constituency (62 percent) and Malinovskiy (60 
percent). Unfortunately, in some constituencies, such as 
Leninskiy and Tsentralnyy, the turnout was only 48 percent. In 
the countryside, the highest turnout was in Tatarbunarskiy, 
Filiyskiy, and Razdelnyanskiy rayons. 
  Our Poltava correspondent reports that all of the 15 Poltava 
Oblast constituencies have reported a valid election. The 
highest turnout was in the countryside. Thus, in Orzhitskiy, 
Velikobagachskiy, Zenkovskiy, Mirgorodskiy, and other rayons, 
the turnout was over 90 percent of registered voters. Somewhat 
lower was the turnout in Kremenchug and Poltava itself. We are 
unable to name those elected yet, but there is every confidence 
that the number of Poltava representatives will be larger this 
time. 
  Finally, results in the Ukrainian capital. Our presenters on 
10 April were unable to quote even preliminary results, saying, 
however that elections were valid in about eight of the 
capital's constituencies. Here are the preliminary results of 
elections in Kiev that we know so far. Out of the 23 
constituencies, eight reported a valid election. The elected 
deputies include Myroslav Horbatyuk, Ivan Zayets, [Minister of 
Environment] Yuriy Kostenko. I will remind you that people's 
deputies elected in Kiev on 27 March were Volodymyr Lanovyy and 
Les Tanyuk. [sentence as heard] All of the Kiev deputies named 
here are supported by the Ukraina Democratic Association. We 
have no results yet as to the runoff in Artemovskiy constituency 
No. 1 where the contenders were lawyer Viktor Medvedchuk and 
[ex-Minister of Defense] General Kostyantyn Morozov. In two 
constituencies, Pecherskiy and Podolskiy, neither of the 
deputies received the required number of votes.

  [Text] Kiev April 11 TASS -- The results of the elections 
in Ukraine, whose second round was held in 350 constituencies 
last Sunday, remain to be specified. It is already clear, 
however, that the elections did take place, and as a result of 
them a new Ukrainian parliament was elected. It will replace 
the previous one contrary to the opinion of many politicians and 
sociologists, who forecast the apathy of the electorate and, 
consequently, the failure of elections. 
  On Sunday the elections were recognised as valid in 324 
constituencies. According to preliminary information, which was 
available on April 11 in the morning, 222 legislators, elected 
during the second round, will be added to 90, elected during the 
first one. Many of the newly elected deputies were members of 
the previous parliament; specifically, its speaker Ivan 
Plyushch, chairman of the Ukrainian Socialist Party Aleksandr 
Moroz, ex-prime minister Leonid Kuchma, chairman of Ukrainian 
RUKH Vyacheslav Chornovil, ex-vice speaker Vladimir Grinev, 
acting prime minister Yefim Zvyagilskiy, first deputy chairman 
of the Supreme Soviet Vasiliy Durdinets and ex-prime minister 
Vitaliy Masol. The majority, however, are newcomers. 
  The results of the elections and the make-up of the new 
parliament are sure to be analysed by specialists. It is 
obvious, however, that it will have a large group of 
professional economists and lawyers, who can quickly analyse 
complex situations and find optimal solutions.

  [Text] Ukraine's Popular Rukh [Ukrainian People's Movement 
for Perestroyka] will manage to form up its own faction in the 
Ukrainian parliament, said RUKH leader Vyacheslav Chornovil, 
after voting in a Kiev polling station. 
  He expressed fears, however, lest the national democrats 
might fail to secure the required one third of the votes and 
block the left-wing forces' attempts to ruin the Ukrainian state 
system. 
  Asked by Interfax-Ukraine if he was planning to run for 
presidency (Chornovil took part in the previous presidential 
elections - Interfax), he stated that it would be inexpedient 
to hold presidential elections on June 28, 1994, because the 
alignment of forces was not in favor of the Ukrainian state or 
the national-democratic forces. He also announced that RUKH 
would determine its position on the presidential elections 
during its congress on April 16. 
  In his opinion, the victory of Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma 
was not ruled out. He remarked, however, that Kuchma is an 
incompetent person, so it would be a crime to let him run the 
state. 
  He also denied the possibility of cooperation between the 
national-democrats and the extreme left-wing and right-wing 
factions, and described Stepan Khmara, the leader of the 
Ukrainian Conservative Party popular in Western Ukraine, as the 
Ukrainian Zhirinovskiy. 
  Commenting on the situation in Crimea, he said that 
following 
the signing of the tripartite statement, Russia would not 
complicate the situation in Crimea. He noted, however, that 
this statement did not quite suit Ukraine. 
  Until recently, Ukraine had neither a strategy nor tactics 
in 
relation to Crimea, he said. Instead of overly exaggerating the 
problem, one should pursue a firm state policy in relation to 
Simferopol which absolutely depends on Kiev economically, he 
added. This does not mean, though, that troops should be sent to 
Crimea, said Chornovil.

  [Text] Kiev, April 11. RIA - Leader of the People's Rukh of 
Ukraine Vyacheslav Chornovil holds the view that the 
national-democratic forces have suffered a defeat at the 
elections to the Supreme Soviet of Ukraine. In an interview 
with RIA he said that by the middle of April 10 it became clear 
that the frankly pro-communist forces will have at the minimum 
one-third of the seats in the new parliament of Ukraine. 
  However, it is too early for the communists to celebrate a 
full victory, he went on to say. In his opinion, they will not 
have one half of the seats in the parliament, and the question 
what political force will dominate in the Supreme Soviet will be 
resolved somewhat later, when it becomes clear whom the numerous 
independent deputies and centrists will side with. 
  In Chornovil's view, the RUKH movement will be able to form 
parliamentary group, but the national-democratic forces will 
hardly win more than one third of the seats. The RUKH leader 
has stated that he has documents proving the numerous violations 
of the electoral legislation. The respective documents will be 
turned over to the Supreme Court of the republic.

<F P=106> [RUKH-PRESS report: "Another Hypothesis"] </F>
  [Text] The abduction of Mykhaylo Boychyshyn was 
perpetrated by the Russian special services, claims Stanislaw 
Husak, deputy chairman of the United Party of Belarus [ADPB] and 
member of the Belarusian Popular Front Council [BNF]. 
  As everybody knows, the second international conference on 
the Baltic-Black Sea oil collector (BChNK) was to be held in 
Kiev on 29-30 January of this year. The conference's initiating 
group elected Mykhaylo Boychyshyn chairman of the organizational 
committee. All documents concerning the preparations and course 
of the conference disappeared with him. The conference was to 
be attended not only by specialists and government economists 
from Latvia, Lithuania, Belarus, and Ukraine, but also private 
bankers and entrepreneurs who had previously voiced their 
readiness to establish the Regional Bank of Development. The 
bank is expected to finance all design and assembly work 
connected with the implementation of the idea behind the BChNK. 
  As Stanislaw Husak, author of the BChNK concept, notes, the 
implementation of this idea would diametrically change the 
geopolitical situation in the Baltic-Black Sea region. If the 
collector is built, Russia will lose its monopolistic status in 
the four countries' raw materials markets, and, perspectively, 
also Estonia's. Such a situation would contradict with Russia's 
aspirations. Therefore, Stanislaw Husak believes, the Russian 
special services might have kidnapped Mykhaylo Boychyshyn to 
hinder the conference. All the more so, since such a conference 
held two months before the elections could have significantly 
influenced the course of elections and bolstered the authority 
of Rukh as a political organization. 
  Although Stanislaw Husak sent a report to Belarusian Prime 
Minister Vyachaslaw Kebich on the BChNK project as early as the 
spring of 1993, he has never received any response. The ADPB 
and BNF leadership decided therefore that it is necessary to 
support the project through politics. The Belarusian opposition 
applied to the Peasant Party of Latvia, the Lithuanian Sajudis, 
and the Ukrainian Rukh for assistance. In the summer of 1993, 
the first international BChNK conference was held. The high 
level of the conference was confirmed by the participation of 
Ints Jansons, director general of the Latvian conglomerate 
Latvijas Nafta; Arimantas Dragunevicius, Lithuanian Government 
adviser for energy issues; Fedor Molochko, director of the 
Belarusian Thermal Power Engineering Institute; and Stanislav 
Ivanytskyy, deputy engineer general of the Ukrahazproekt 
Institute. A feasibility study on the idea of BChNK was 
conducted during the conference. The invited specialists in 
design, assembly, and operation of oil pipelines confirmed the 
feasibility of the project. Members of delegations representing 
the governments of participating countries supported the idea of 
building the BChNK. 
  The Latvian and Lithuanian authorities have recently 
established committees to support the BChNK project. Despite 
the mysterious disappearance of Mykhaylo Boychyshyn, the 
initiating group is preparing the second international BChNK 
conference in Minsk. The timing of the conference is currently 
being discussed, and the necessary documents are being 
reconstructed. Stanislaw Husak has been elected chairman of the 
organizational committee.

  [Text] Moscow April 8 TASS -- Russian nationalist leader 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy on Friday created another scandal in the 
Russian State Duma. During a coffee-break he beat up lawmaker 
Vladimir Borzyuk who, earlier this week, had quit Zhirinovskiy's 
faction in protest against his extremist policies. 
  Alla Gerber of Russia's Choice told TASS she saw 
"Zhirinovskiy striking Borzyuk's head against the wall." Then, 
according to the eyewitness, Vladimir Volfovich turned his anger 
against a passing journalist, seized his tape-recorder and broke 
the journalist's glasses. 
  The Russia's Choice faction proposed to set up a special 
commission to investigate the incident, but the Duma turned the 
proposal down, saying the case was within the competence of the 
Duma's procedural committee. 
  Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin told reporters he would file 
public 
prosecutor a report on the incident by Zhirinovskiy's victim, 
journalist Andrey Pyatkovskiy of the "STOLITSA" magazine.

  [Text] [Aleksey Venediktov] At the suggestion of the 
Russia's Choice faction, the evening session of the State Duma 
returned to the incident between Vladimir Zhirinovskiy and 
Deputies Vladimir Borzyuk and Valeriy Borshchev. The State Duma 
received a statement signed by STOLITSA magazine journalist 
Aleksey Pyatkovskiy, whose dictophone and glasses were broken 
and trampled upon by Zhirinovskiy. State Duma Chairman Ivan 
Rybkin instructed the committee on the internal organization of 
the Duma to investigate the incident. Rybkin stressed that he 
would personally hand over the journalist's statement to the 
bodies of the democratic state which is being formed together 
with the State Duma. 
  [Announcer] When asked by our correspondent where the 
Chairman of the State Duma would send the assaulted journalist's 
statement, the State Duma chairman said: 
  [Rybkin] I will definitely -- it is my duty -- pass the 
paper from your colleague Pyatkovskiy to the procurator general.

Accord. Political confrontation has been exhausting. 
Constructive cooperation for the sake of Russian revival is the 
best way out. None but we will settle our problems. We should 
be wise enough to accept and understand each other," says a 
statement of the Russian president's public chamber circulated 
here today. 
  "Acknowledging our responsibility for the future of our 
motherland and considering its interests to be superior to 
class, corporative, party and group interests, we, 
representatives of political, trade union, women's, veterans', 
youth and other public organizations, who have diverse political 
outlook and social interests, voice our support to the 
initiatives of citizens, public associations, political parties, 
the Russian president and the State Duma on the achievement of 
Civic Accord in Russia," says the document. 
  Members of the public chamber called for the maximum broad 
use of conciliatory mechanisms in solution of political, social 
and economic issues. They offered the working group for 
preparation of the draft agreement on Civic Accord in Russia to 
take into account proposals voiced during the draft discussion 
at the public chamber.

  [Text] Moscow April 9 (TASS) -- "The accord on civic peace 
and concord" should be promulgated into law by the State Duma, 
approved as such by a Federation Council and finally signed by 
the president," Russian Vice Premier and PRES [Party Russian 
Unity and Accord] Leader Sergey Shakhray said at a meeting of 
the public chamber under the president in the Kremlin today. 
  The accord will then facilitate the achievement of peace and 
concord in society and provide for a political respite which can 
be used to implement economic reforms. 
  Shakhray called on all leaders of political parties willing 
to sign the accord to join in finalizing the draft so as to 
avoid any misunderstanding. Some State Duma deputies have 
complained that they had taken no part in working out the draft 
accord. Shakhray also called for the signing of the accord as 
soon as possible. "We have already has a war of laws, then a war 
of sovereignties and we must no longer permit yet another war to 
break out -- a war of agreements on peace," he said.

  [Text] Moscow April 11 -- A new situation is forming in 
Russia after the December elections. A new professional and 
social base takes shape. Gennady Burbulis, member of the State 
Duma, president of the Humanitarian and Political Sciences 
Centre "Strategia" (strategy), said in an interview to ITAR-TASS. 
  He said that the new political reality is "the part of the 
pragmatically-minded population that for various reasons kept 
from engaging in active politics, but on whose specific activity 
the stability, meaningfulness and constructiveness of all 
undertakings in Russia will depend in future." 
  Regarding his quitting Russia's Choice faction, Burbulis 
said: "I have not as much quitted Russia's Choice as I meet 
halfway the new reality. I objects to its being overlooked." 
  Burbulis believes there is no need to cling to slogans and 
ideological values that have been used for three years now. "The 
activity of Russia's choice is quite justifiable, but it risks 
to go into a dead alley unless the changed situation is taken 
into notice," he said. 
  Burbulis regards as a new political force, first of all, the 
December 12th group in the duma. He said there are also quite a 
few deputies in other factions upholding the same positions. 
  Regarding his political career, Burbulis said he is not 
going 
to become a leader of the new political force. "I shall be 
pressing for its recognition and unification on a constructive 
basis and I shall be promoting the emergence of new leaders," he 
said.

  [Text] Moscow April 9 TASS -- "Yeltsin's candidature for 
presidency in the next elections is quite possible, given a few 
conditions," president of the humanitarian and political science 
centre "Strategy" Gennadiy Burbulis told journalists in the 
Kremlin today. 
  He pointed out three conditions for Yeltsin's success in the 
race, which, judging by all appearances, has already begun in 
Russia. "Yeltsin must realize the new political style and 
appear to the people not only as the leader of reforms but also 
as the person capable of reunifying the nations in the remaining 
18 months. He will also need a reliable political and civic 
structure on which to rely for support and which he does not 
have now. He must run as a man acting on instructions from such 
a civic and political structure which can propel him to the 
post. Thirdly, society needs to know clearly who make up the 
presidential team, who are his comrades in arms and who are his 
possible successors. 
  If these three conditions materialize "I will back Yeltsin 
proceeding from the fact that the president is now one of the 
main guarantors of stability in society," Burbulis said. 
  He also pointed out that the accord on civic peace is not a 
lull between the branches of power but an expression of 
society's urgent need for stability. Burbulis called on all 
political parties to defend their positions within the frame of 
law.

<F P=106> [Interview with V.F. Shumeyko, chairman of the Russian </F>
Federation Federal Assembly Federation Council, by Petr 
Karapetyan; place and date not given: "The Army Must Have All 
It Needs -- and as a Matter of Priority"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Karapetyan] Vladimir 
Filippovich, I would like to ask the following question: Moscow 
Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov is constructing a 100-apartment block in 
Sevastopol for Russian seamen. In turn, you said during a trip 
to Kaliningrad Oblast that the Federation Council would act as 
sponsor of the destroyer Nastoychivyy and the naval garrison in 
Baltiysk. Sponsorship assistance for the Army is a 
long-standing, essential Russian tradition. Absolutely no doubt 
about that. But it is no substitute for a clear-cut, thoroughly 
thought-out state program for the Army. Do you sense the need 
for one? 
  [Shumeyko] Of course. State social policy in Russia in 
general, and in relation to the Army in particular, is based on 
a plethora of uncoordinated legislative acts, working directly 
or indirectly, so to speak, to provide social security. This is 
clearly not enough. We need a social code, and I talked about 
this with the president. Boris Nikolayevich suggested that 
consideration be given to creating it. We in the Federation 
Council are now preparing proposals that are basically aimed at 
protecting those strata of the population which are dependent on 
the budget. And I will insist on a separate chapter in the code 
on state social policy in the Army. After all, it must be 
clearly recognized that the Army is a state institution, so who 
is going to look after it if not the state? I am firmly of the 
opinion that the military must always be socially provided for 
and as a matter of priority. Incidentally, the Federation 
Council is 67 percent representatives of regional authorities. 
And, believe me, their approach to this question is 
statesmanlike. 
  [Karapetyan] Now you say that the Army must have everything 
it needs. It would be difficult to find in Russia a statesman 
who would not endorse what you say. But when it comes to 
practical action, the left hand forgets what the right hand was 
doing. In the corridors of power there is constant talk to the 
effect that it would not be a bad idea to strip the military of 
their privileges. In my opinion, this is no big deal. What 
privileges are we talking about, anyway! The need for a state 
program to construct housing for servicemen is being called into 
question; they are trying to save energy resources at our 
expense.... Yet the Russian military earn their daily bread in 
Sarajevo, Tajikistan, the Dniester Region, South Ossetia, and 
the Ossetian-Ingush conflict zone, as well as in the quiet 
provinces and the capital. Permanent danger and hardship. 
Indeed, the Russian Army deserves to be treated differently by 
the state. 
  [Shumeyko] The state cannot exist without the Army and I 
believe it is a waste of time to debate the subject. So I will 
try to set out my own viewpoint as briefly as possible. Of 
course, the Army's interests will have to be taken into account 
when the state budget is discussed and approved, and it goes 
without saying that one should be guided by the principle of 
defensive sufficiency, rather than the residual principle. 
There are 10 committees in the Federation Council working on 
the budget, including the Defense and Security Committee. 
Obviously any committee is going to assert its own positions, 
but we will not allow the Army's interests to be undermined. 
Although I will allow a serious debate. The Army must be fully 
provided with budget money and the policy in this case must be a 
rigorous one. 
  [Karapetyan] There is something else the Army desperately 
needs, as well as a budget. I am talking about political 
stability in Russia. But society is in turmoil again. This time 
as a result of rumors about a plot, about a new coup... 
  [Shumeyko] All this I regard as an attempt to rock the boat. 
As for the situation in the country, it seems to me more stable 
than last year. Efforts to destabilize the situation through 
rumors and provocations were fine once, so to speak. But they 
will not work today. 
  [Karapetyan] Nonetheless, Vladimir Filippovich, the 
political background to the economic reforms remains rather 
complex. Take, for instance, the results of the local 
elections. Is the nomenklatura on its way back? 
  [Shumeyko] Since you have broached the subject of elections, 
I will say that they were marked by a low level of political 
activity by voters and a high level of activity by politicians. 
Take St. Petersburg, for instance. There were 750 candidates 
for 50 deputies' seats there. That is a very large number. The 
elections were "prolonged," of course, by country dwellers. In 
the cities people are tired of democracy, I would say. 
Democracy means elections all the time. People do not see 
results, so they do not go to cast their votes, they become less 
politically active. In St. Petersburg again the organizers of 
one particular rally were expecting to attract 15,000 people. 
Some 22 people turned up in the square. As for the return of 
the nomenklatura, I must welcome it, in the sense that the 
people returning are experienced people, people who know what 
they are at. 
  [Karapetyan] But what influence will they have on the 
conduct of the reforms? 
  [Shumeyko] Local self-government implements laws adopted at 
the top. A simple formula and, you will agree, a pretty 
reliable one -- it guarantees that reform remains a factor in 
Russia's development. 
  [Karapetyan] But the problem of accord in Russian society is 
there nonetheless. By all accounts, work is almost completed on 
the agreement "On Achieving Civil Accord." How do you see this? 
  [Shumeyko] I am familiar with the text. If we carry on 
refining it, it will never be signed. There is a principle: 
"Excellent is the enemy of good." As it stands, it is a 
well-tuned document and I see no reason why it should not be 
adopted. 
  [Karapetyan] Vladimir Filippovich, you recently said you 
support the idea of reestablishing the USSR, although not in its 
previous form. President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan 
talked about creating a Eurasian Union comprising CIS states. 
Does this not indicate the possibility of creating a 
Commonwealth or Union on the basis of confederative principles 
on the territory of the former USSR? 
  [Shumeyko] My vision is of the reestablishment of an 
integrated commonwealth of states, rather than the 
reestablishment of the USSR in its pre-perestroyka form. We do 
not want rigid borders, we must try to meet one another halfway. 
We should be airing this idea right now. I would not describe 
the CIS as the optimal form of a commonwealth. Something of the 
order of 400 decisions have been adopted in its context and 
barely one-fourth has been implemented. The states choose which 
they will sign and which they will not. That is not the way to 
go about it. We have to get together in a union, and I am not 
frightened of the word. Two or three states for a start, say. 
The rest are then bound to follow. 
  [Karapetyan] In the event of integration, what picture do 
you have of the commonwealth's armed forces? 
  [Shumeyko] Even now we could be preparing the ground for the 
creation of unified armed forces. But we must at least begin by 
instituting a council of the commonwealth countries' defense 
ministers. So Russia is compelled to keep 15,000 people on the 
territories of sovereign states, including the trouble spots. 
It is difficult, it is not good.

  [Text] Murmansk, 9 Apr -- An ITAR-TASS correspondent has 
just been informed at the Northern Fleet's press center about an 
incident that is terrible in terms of its cruelty and 
pointlessness. A serviceman who is serving in a military 
counter-intelligence subunit of the Federal Counterintelligence 
Service, killed four Northern Fleet sailors and wounded three 
last night. The criminal has taken four crew members of a 
vessel hostage and is now on board the vessel. Representatives 
of the Fleet's command and of the Federal Counter-Intelligence 
Service are negotiating with him.

  [Text] Murmansk, 9 Apr -- The ITAR-TASS correspondent has 
managed to find out the details of the emergency which occurred 
early this morning at one of the military cantonments of the 
Northern Fleet. 
  Press center workers and fleet staff officers said that 
armed 
sailor Dmitriy Pulkin, who is serving under contract in a 
counterintelligence sub-unit of the Federal Counterintelligence 
Service, killed four people and injured three sailors. At 0355 
hours he switched off the signaling in the armory room and stole 
two submachineguns with six full drum magazines and five 
pistols. Then he went down into the quarters of the duty 
officer for a large unit of submarines and shot him with the 
submachinegun. Next, he entered the quarters where the 
submariners were resting and opened fire on them. One sailor 
was killed and two were wounded. Seizing the unit commander's 
driver, the criminal forced him to take the wheel. The latter 
managed to get away for a few minutes into the barracks where he 
reported the emergency to the duty officer of the naval 
headquarters. Realizing his mistake, the criminal himself took 
the wheel and set off for the military town. However, by that 
time, the road was blocked by two fire engines, and Captain 
Dudakov of the counterintelligence services drove towards him. 
He tried to detain the criminal who opened fire with a 
submachine gun and killed both the officer and his driver. 
  Breaking away from his pursuers, Pulkin reached a torpedo 
retriever boat on which a seaman from his own district of 
Pereslavl-Zalesskiy was serving. The criminal shot him dead and 
took the other four members of the crew hostage. All Pulkin is 
demanding from the representatives of the naval command and the 
counterintelligence services, who are talking to him about his 
surrender, is vodka and cigarettes.

  [Text] Murmansk April 9 (TASS) -- Sailor Dmitriy Pulkin, 
who took hostage four servicemen and found shelter on board a 
small cutter after killing four and wounding three people last 
night, has been detained by a counter-intelligence officer and 
two members of a special interior unit. 
  Before the detention Pulkin demanded that representatives of 
the Russian Federal Counter-intelligence Service and the 
Northern Fleet give him spirits and cigarettes. The demand was 
satisfied. A hostage made use of Pulkin's intoxication and 
seized his automatic rifle. The counter-intelligence officer 
and the policemen disarmed Pulkin and brought him to the 
investigation ward. The incident is being investigated. The 
content of Pulkin's note left at his working place has not been 
made public. 
  Although the crime was committed on the territory of a 
Northern Fleet naval base, it has nothing to do with the fleet, 
since the unit Pulkin was in belongs to the Russian Federal 
Counter- Intelligence Service. Pulkin, 21, was a contractual 
servicemen of a military counter-intelligence unit stationed in 
the settlement of Vidyayevo, the Murmansk region, from December 
28, 1991, through April 1, 1994.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "A Few Words to Our ITAR-TASS </F>
Colleagues"] 
  [Text] The commentary "Dangerous Fishing in Black Sea of 
Disinformation Threatens To Aggravate Russian-Ukrainian 
Relations," published in IZVESTIYA 7 April, elicited a pointed 
reaction from our ITAR-TASS colleagues -- a reaction which, in 
general, is understandable. The point is that the article, 
which speaks of the danger of an information war, contains a 
reference to a report by the agency's correspondent on Ukrainian 
Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy's flight to Crimea. The 
correspondent referred to information received at the Black Sea 
Staff. The information had not been confirmed, which fact 
ITAR-TASS at once reported, but the agency tape did not reach 
our observer's desk. It did not have time to. This is why, in 
denying the information on the Ukrainian defense minister's 
trip, he cites not ITAR-TASS but reports by our correspondent in 
Crimea and other sources. 
  We know that ITAR-TASS staffers work to a rigid real-time 
regime. Information which is received is passed on instantly. 
The editorial office really did not wish to cast even a shadow 
of suspicion on the agency, whose materials it readily uses. 
  Even without us there are enough people ready and willing to 
shift onto journalists the responsibility for inaccurate 
information received from trustworthy sources. For example, a 
"technical error" gets through in an official report, and they 
call journalists to account, although it was prepared by 
politicians. Meanwhile the agency was merely fulfilling one of 
its important functions -- that of acting as middle-man between 
the public and the organs of power.

<F P=106> [Interview with Anatoliy Chubays by Sergey Razin; date and </F>
place not given: "The Voucher Has Served Its Purpose and May Go"] 
  [Text] There are less than 100 days to go before voucher 
privatization comes to an end. Feelings are running high. The 
State Duma intends to hold a hearing on this key problem in the 
near future. Will the State Committee for the Management of 
State Property be able to defend its approach to distributing 
state property? 
  [Razin] For many, the public conflict between Chubays and 
Luzhkov has been like a bolt from the blue, in my opinion. Do 
you accept that it could just be a personality clash? 
  [Chubays] Initially, I too thought that the experienced 
economist was irritated by the vigorous actions of the "Chicago 
boys in pink trousers." But that illusion was soon shattered. 
  By attempting to torpedo the voucher, Luzhkov wants to place 
the sale of shares under bureaucrats' control and make it so 
expensive that, in the end, privatization will drag on for 
decades -- to the satisfaction of all who cherish the hope of 
returning Russia to the era of "developed socialism." 
  [Razin] Are you not being too harsh in your judgments? 
  [Chubays] Why is it then that major investment funds like 
"Alfa-Kapital" have invested only 3 percent of their resources 
in the privatization of Moscow enterprises? 
  The reason is simple: Privatization in Moscow and a number 
of regions is being blocked by local authorities. 
Unfortunately, while he does not have the power to abolish 
vouchers, Luzhkov is in a position to slow down the process. 
But the State Committee for the Management of State Property 
has sufficient levers to enable Muscovites to invest their 
checks in the capital's most promising ventures. I think the 
State Committee's plans will get massive support from below.... 
  [Razin] In my opinion, the voucher's main purpose is not to 
effect nationwide privatization, but to create the conditions 
whereby the state sector can be transferred to commercial 
structures' private ownership as quickly as possible.... 
  [Chubays] All world experience shows that no more than 10-15 
percent of the population may become efficient owners. Where 
are we to find these enterprising people capable of transforming 
loss-making plants into profitable firms? There is only one way 
to solve this problem: Through natural selection. 
Consequently, at the start of the voucher marathon we 
deliberately placed everyone on equal terms, without dividing 
them into partocrats and democrats, conservatives and reformers. 
Everyone was given a voucher and told: Do with it what you 
will! Sell it, rip it up, buy another 100 or 1,000, get 
interested in macroeconomics and investments.... It very soon 
became clear that the vouchers were being amassed by people who 
can and want to work with them. We estimate that the desired 
10-15 percent of efficient owners have been found. They will 
probably include former Union ministers, directors of state 
enterprises, and young entrepreneurs, who head more than 600 
check investment funds, incidentally. Of course, not all these 
funds will be able to stand up to the competition: Some of them 
may go bankrupt. But, as a whole, it is quite clear that a 
market mechanism, which will absorb financial resources and pump 
investments into industry, has been created in Russia in just 
12-18 months. 
  [Razin] But where are these fabulous investments going to 
come from? There is no sign of them at present.... 
  [Chubays] You should look more closely. The Volga Motor 
Vehicle Plant hit upon the idea of collecting colossal amounts 
of money to fund the AVVA project. This is one version of the 
breakthrough: Citizens' savings are drawn into industry via the 
mechanism of expanding joint-stock companies' authorized 
capital. Another, no less well-known example is "Olbi-Diplomat." 
These are intelligent people who basically collect billions of 
rubles for television advertizing alone -- money which, if it 
were not invested in the economy, would simply lie idle. These 
two examples point to a chain reaction of even more attractive 
projects, including some which involve Western capital. 
Hundreds of investment funds and thousands of joint-stock 
industrial enterprises are destined to engage in this kind of 
business; even now, they are finding mutual benefit in 
cooperation at check auctions. 
  [Razin] But check auctions will "die" with the voucher on 1 
July, which is less than 100 days away.... 
  [Chubays] Check auctions will be succeeded by money 
auctions, which will allow enterprises to attract even more 
investments for their development by means of selling shares. 
  [Razin] Is it not the case that the mafia will simply buy up 
the most profitable enterprises with its easy money? 
  [Chubays] On completion of check privatization, enterprises' 
fixed capital will have a much higher value. It goes without 
saying that labor collectives which are dragging their heels 
over selling shares risk losing many of the current benefits and 
waking up one morning to a new owner in the shape of a 
commercial bank or fund. 
  [Razin] Is that why giants like "Gazprom" and a number of 
leading petroleum extraction companies have started rushing into 
check auctions? 
  [Chubays] Whatever, it is certainly no accident that 
"Gazprom" has collected several million vouchers from all over 
the country to take part in its own auction. After 1 July, 
shares which can now be bought with these checks will be 10 
times more expensive.... 
  [Razin] Suppose voucher privatization ends successfully in 
100 days time. Will all its pluses not be concealed by 
financial-industrial groups, which officials of all colors have 
suddenly begun to discuss? Is this venture not a trick to keep 
bankrupt enterprises afloat? 
  [Chubays] I am skeptical of attempts to unite quite 
different enterprises on orders from above. Economic councils 
like these will collapse under pressure from internal conflicts. 
But this idea could forge a path for itself if shareholders 
from various sectors and commercial structures want to combine 
their efforts to stabilize financial and industrial ties. I 
think we will hear of such examples quite soon. 
  [Razin] I would very much like to share your optimism. But 
I am not convinced by predictions or promises, only by hard 
facts. The voucher privatization stage has been completed in the 
Czech Republic and Slovakia. What is the situation there with 
investments in industry? 
  [Chubays] The Czech economics minister told me during a 
recent meeting that the Czech Republic has been flooded with so 
many investments -- both from within the country and from abroad 
-- that the government no longer knows what to do with them. 
The total capital exceeds all conceivable limits. The 
population is also convinced of the success of voucher 
privatization, as the dividends from investing coupons (the 
Czech equivalent of our vouchers) amount to more than three or 
four months' wages, and wages in the Czech Republic are 
comparable to those received in the West. I am convinced that 
the Czech Republic had the highest industrial growth rate of all 
the European countries last year. 
  Admittedly, this success was made possible not only by 
optimum privatization, but also by financial stabilization. 
They are two sides of the same coin. In conjunction, these two 
factors have an astounding effect. 
  [Razin] Will we soon see something similar in Russia? 
  [Chubays] The Czechs began their reforms 18-24 months 
earlier than us. So Russia still has everything ahead.... 
Recently the prime minister publicly lambasted some heads of 
laboratory who allegedly confused Russia with a racing car: 
They drove it around for a while and then abandoned it. 
Something similar can be seen in readers' letters: Surely 
Gaydar has not abandoned the reforms? Gaydar has been criticized 
with unconcealed hatred on all sides. But many people treat him 
with understanding, because he was not cunning and took all the 
flak. However hard life may be for Russians, in the past two 
years the reforms have reached the "point of no return" and 
become irreversible. You must agree that it is nevertheless 
better to live in Russia at present than in Ukraine, say, where 
they have tried to boost the economy with "other, nonmonetarist 
methods".... 
  Gaydar resigned because he did not like playing the role of 
whipping boy in the government. But he did not abandon the 
reforms when he resigned: He has remained in politics. Our 
main task now is to complete privatization and create a broad 
class of owners: The middle class that will serve as a firm 
social foundation for the economic reforms. Only on this basis 
will it be possible to form a strong political party capable of 
shaking the Russian economy out of its comatose state. Strictly 
speaking, with no real support from below, even under the 
president's wing it will be impossible to contain lobbyist 
storms for long.... 
  [Razin] Do you not think that the reformers have gone too 
far with their tough financial policy? Is this not the reason 
why you recently had to be appointed vice premier over the prime 
minister's head? The president has had to show his fist in 
order to defend check privatization.... 
  [Chubays] I do not agree that the presidential edict on my 
appointment was signed over the prime minister's head. This 
document was drawn up with Chernomyrdin's consent. It just 
happens that my appointment was passed separately from the 
general list.... 
  [Razin] It looks as if Yeltsin has thereby made it clear to 
anyone interested that voucher privatization will be taken to 
its logical conclusion. 
  [Chubays] That was probably the intention. 
  [Razin] Sorry, but are you sure you will be able to complete 
voucher privatization? You are rather out on a limb in the 
present government, and it is strongly rumored in the State Duma 
that you will soon be removed altogether.... 
  [Chubays] A year or 18 months ago, I found these questions 
difficult. Virtually every day began with the feeling that I 
only had a week left. Breaking through the redoubts of the old 
parliament was like crossing a minefield. 
  The situation has now fundamentally changed. Even fierce 
opponents of check privatization -- such as Luzhkov, for example 
-- blame the State Committee for the Management of State 
Property for the fact that directors have become our allies. 
This is absolutely true. First, we have made the process of 
selling shares extremely simple by removing the armada of 
officials. Second, we have given state enterprises the chance 
to use their vouchers to buy a major shareholding without being 
robbed by a revaluation of their fixed capital. 
  That is why Luzhkov's version has not been adopted. The 
Moscow mayor has tried to increase the cost of state enterprises 
hundreds of times over, abolish check auctions, and hold only 
money auctions in their place. If this were to happen, Luzhkov 
would have some serious explaining to do with workers at the 
Likhachev Plant, the Volga Motor Vehicle Plant, and thousands of 
other enterprises: They would want to know why shares had become 
400 times more expensive and why they could no longer be bought 
with vouchers, but only with cash -- of which there is not 
enough even to pay wages. I would like to see the results of 
these talks.... 
  Of course, opposition to privatization is still very strong. 
But centers of sabotage now only remain in the corridors of 
power: The voucher is opposed by the former party-economic 
nomenklatura, big lobbies of officials, and a number of 
political parties which act as a mouthpiece for their interests. 
Some will lose a very great deal from the real redistribution 
of property in favor of economic efficiency. 
  But it is no longer officials who call the shots: It is the 
person with the voucher. Try and take it away from him, and you 
will be in real trouble! When the affair with the 
"Tekhnicheskiy Progress" Joint-Stock Company came to light, its 
shareholders became a seething mob prepared to sweep aside 
anyone in their path. 
  That is why I am convinced that no forces or shady 
structures 
now have the power to stop the process of privatization....

<F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Kucherenko: "Central Bank Prepared To </F>
Reduce Rates for Centralized Credits"] 
  [Text] Central Bank Chairman V. Gerashchenko has made a 
sensational statement in the State Duma to the effect that in 
the very near future he will reduce commercial banks' credit 
rates. 
  The exact figure is not yet known and the Central Bank of 
Russia is not interested in making it public, to avoid 
destabilizing the interbank credit market. But experts are 
citing a figure between 180 and 200 percent per annum by the end 
of April. Let us recall that the present rate is 210 percent 
  According to Gerashchenko this is being done because 
inflation rates have declined considerably. And if the 
government keeps its word and brings its average monthly rates 
down to 7-9 percent by the end of the year then the Central Bank 
will correspondingly lower the bank rate to 110-120 percent per 
annum. 
  We have found out from competent sources in the Central Bank 
of Russia that this has been talked about for a long time. But 
there is a long way from talk to implementing that intention. 
It will all depend on how far the cabinet of ministers succeeds 
in keeping the budget deficit within the calculated limits and 
also on whether the government approves the monetary and credit 
policy concept sent to it by the Central Bank. Its thrust, 
according to V. Smenkovskiy, chief of the Central Bank research 
and information department, is that the Bank of Russia has set 
limits and volumes for the credits granted, which must be sent 
to specific enterprises and for specific projects. But which 
projects these will be is to be determined by the government 
program of "targeted" support for industry. 
  It is entirely possible that the Central Bank of Russia's 
decision to embark on reducing the base rate was influenced by 
the results of auctions to which centralized credits were 
submitted. The feeble activity of the banks at the auctions 
showed that loans have become excessively expensive and the 
market has been saturated and the time has come to reduce the 
cost of money, so to speak.

<F P=106> [INTERFAX report: "Finance Ministry Opposed to Indexation </F>
in Budget-Financed Sphere"] 
  [Text] The Finance Ministry does not deem it advisable to 
index the earnings of personnel in the budget-financed sphere 
during the second quarter of this year. 
  Acting Russian Finance Minister Sergey Dubinin disclosed 
this 
at a meeting with journalists. He explained that indexation of 
the earnings of workers in this category during the first 
quarter was 90 percent while the level of inflation over this 
period was 36 percent. "What happened was over-indexation." 
Moreover, according to Dubinin, the 2 trillion rubles for 
indexation during the second quarter have already been allocated 
in order to satisfy the coal miners' economic demands within the 
budget framework. "Any victories by strikers with regard to 
meeting their demands mean somebody else loses out," S. Dubinin 
stressed.

reorganization is nearing completion in the Air Defense Troops. 
The number of personnel has been cut here, as in other arms of

    [Editorial Report] Moscow Ostankino Television First 
Channel Network in Russian at 0600 GMT on 10 April broadcasts in 
its "Test Range" program a two-minute report, entitled "Who will 
defend the skies?," on the financial problems facing Russia's 
air defense forces. The video shows a series of shots of radar 
equipment and SAM missiles. An announcer says that the air 
defense troops now receive only 30 percent of the fuels and 
lubricants they require, with the result that fighter pilots 
spend only 25 to 40 hours in the air instead of the recommended 
150. Air crews get to fire training missiles once every two 
years. Officers and warrant officers regularly experienced 
delays with their pay. There are also rumors that the troops 
are to be disbanded. 
  The report includes an interview with Commander in Chief 
V.A. 
Prudnikov by an unidentified correspondent. Prudnikov says: 
"Yes, we really are being reduced in size. We are being 
reformed, but the process has been well thought out. We are 
removing hardware equipped with obsolete equipment and weapons, 
but retaining the most recent technology, the antiaircraft 
missile troops, the 300 complexes [as heard], our Air Force, the 
MiG-31 and Su-27, and our latest radar systems. And, you are 
also aware that the space missile defense troops have been 
attached to the air defense troops. We are trying to perform the 
basic tasks assigned to us and carry out reforms in order to 
maintain quality."

  [Text] [Oleg Padenko] The fact that yet another nuclear 
submarine is being dismantled at the Zvezda Works was 
immediately known in the Maritime Kray. After all, the question 
immediately arose as to what to do with the water from the 
submarine, polluted with radiation, since the notorious TNT-5 
tanker, like others, is full to overflowing with 
life-threatening waste. This is in the center of the Bolshoy 
Kamen town, quite near to Vladivostok. Nor is there any 
protection against the impending disaster. Local projects to 
treat the waste are unrealistic and the Japanese assistance is 
hanging in the air. 
  It is precisely for this reason that the interdepartmental 
commission working at the Zvezda Works made a sensational 
decision on the necessity to discharge the liquid radioactive 
waste into the Sea of Japan, as was done before, because nothing 
else can be done. Ahead is the dismantling of a further number 
of nuclear submarines, more than 40.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Veronika Romanenkova and </F>
Vladimir Rogachev] 
  [Text] Moscow April 8 -- Russian non-piloted spacecraft 
programs will be cut due to scarce finances, deputy general 
director of the Russian Space Agency Yuri Milov told ITAR-TASS 
here today. 
  Only three-four projects in each area will be supported from 
amongst the current 22 communications satellite projects and ten 
proposals on space distant earth probing systems. The Almaz 
interesting and costly project is in question, as its financing 
would mean termination of other earth probing programs. The 
mars program can hardly be financed as well. At the same time, 
the space agency does not give up promising research and 
development. 
  As for non-state financing sources, Russian commercial 
structures do not want to invest in works to bring benefits in a 
few years. Several commercial projects of communications 
satellites are all Russia now has. 
  The world space market is not eager to welcome Russia, 
despite the fact it has a unique set of reliable 
rocket-boosters, including proton, which are able to put a 
satellite on any orbit even the most exotic, said Milov. The 
space agency is open to international cooperation. It has three 
contracts to launch foreign satellites with Russian 
rocket-boosters, Russian satellites are equipped with foreign 
machinery, exchange of satellite information is underway, 
flights of foreign cosmonauts on board the Mir station are 
profitable, same as the lease of satellite channels by foreign 
clients.

  [Text] Moscow April 8 TASS -- "We are not able to boost 
Russian troops withdrawal from Estonia. This problem should be 
settled through negotiations," Estonian Ambassador Extraordinary 
and Plenipotentiary Yuri Kahn told a news conference here today. 
  In his words, the Russian delegation to the bilateral 
negotiations now wants to settle the withdrawal and military 
pensioner problems in one treaty while the Estonian side favors 
separate solution of these problems. 
  "Estonia and Russia are looking for solutions. The problem 
of Russian troops withdrawal from Estonian territory remains the 
most serious," said Kahn. "In our opinion, the troops withdrawal 
treaty is ready for signing, but there are certain conditions 
put by Russia that hamper the process". 
  "We understand the need for demarcation of the 
Russian-Estonian border. Estonia has not laid any territorial 
claims on Russia and it will hardly lay ones. The border line 
issue should be settled in correspondence to international norms 
of the Estonian-Russian treaty of 1920," stressed the ambassador. 
  In his opinion, the Russian side is determined to build and 
equip the state border with Estonia. 
  Kahn hopes the upcoming meeting of the chairmen of the 
Russian and Estonian parliament committees for international 
affairs will help to find a way out from the complicated 
situation.

<F P=106> [Report by Dmitriy Zhdannikov in the "Diplomacy" column: </F>
Estonia Still Hopes for a Summit"] 
  [Text] "The incident involving the killing of a Russian 
serviceman on the border with Estonia shows once again the need 
to resolve questions concerned with the border regime and 
ensuring provisions to border areas," Juri Kahn, Estonia's 
ambassador to the Russian Federation, said in an interview with 
SEGODNYA. Meanwhile, according to information in SEGODNYA's 
possession, Russia is ready to go ahead with a unilateral 
demarcation of its borders in the northwest. 
  In spite of the failure of the latest, 18th, round of talks, 
when Russia finally refused to pull out its troops before 31 
August 1994, stating that this time frame is unrealistic because 
the question of ensuring the rights of military retirees and 
pensioners has not been settled yet, Ambassador Kahn stressed 
that Estonia is ready to continue the negotiations at the level 
of interstate delegations but only if the Russian Federation 
observes the international obligations it has assumed. "We 
believe that many problems could be resolved by a summit of 
Presidents Yeltsin and Meri. The Russian Foreign Affairs 
Ministry, however, with a persistence we cannot understand, 
rejects the idea of a summit, saying that it is possible only 
after the entire package of documents has been signed." 
  True, Mr. Kahn noted, such meetings are becoming less and 
less probable, a case in point being the refusal by Latvian 
President Guntis Ulmanis to visit Moscow on 20 April in response 
to President Yeltsin's decision to create military bases on the 
territory of the CIS and Latvia.

  [Text] Estonia is ready to start the dismantling of the 
nuclear reactors belonging to the Russian Navy Education Center 
in the Estonian city of Paldiski, Advisor from the Estonian 
Foreign Ministry and head of the military working group for 
negotiations with Russia Agu Tiiman announced at a press 
conference today. 
  Tiiman stressed that the dismantling could be completed 
within three years. Earlier, the Russian party had proposed 
that the work be completed by 1999. 
  The first stage of the dismantling, considered the most 
dangerous, consists of the withdrawal of fuel bars and can be 
started in the next few days, Tiiman said. This stage is 
expected to be finished before June 31, 1994. During the second 
stage Russian specialists will withdraw the secret technical 
equipment of the reactors after which the last stage begins. It 
consists of the dismantling of the walls of the reactors. 
  Tiiman spoke against temporary or permanent conservation of 
the reactors' bodies in Estonia. He pointed out that all of 
them must be withdrawn to Russia. 
  In accordance with the Russian-Estonian agreements Russia 
will carry out all the work on dismantling and Estonia will be 
responsible for security in the city and its outskirts and will 
participate in possible emergency works. Russian 
representatives at the international conference in Stockholm 
earlier this year agreed to let foreign observers to the last 
stage of the work.

  [Excerpts] Tallinn, Apr 08, BNS -- The Estonian government 
on Thursday [7 April] accepted the resignation of Col. Ants 
Laaneots, the chief of the country's defense forces' general 
staff. The Cabinet expressed hope that the Estonian Defense 
Forces "will not be deprived" of Laaneots' services. 
  Laaneots tendered his resignation March 24 and Defense 
Forces 
chief, Maj. Gen. Aleksander Einseln accepted it a week later. 
  President Lennart Meri will make the final decision on 
Laaneots' resignation. [passage omitted] 
  The Tallinn-based EESTI EKSPRESS weekly claims in its latest 
issue that many of Laaneots' fellow officers and superiors in 
the Soviet Army were not aware that his father in 1944 fought 
against Russians in a border guard regiment formed by the 
Germans and after the Red Army invaded Estonia joined the 
so-called "forest brethren" (partisans) in the southwest 
Estonian Parnu region.

  [Text] The Union of Russian Federation Citizens of Tallinn 
[Soyuz Rossiyskikh Grazhdan Tallinna] was formalized on 9 April 
at an inaugural assembly in the Estonian capital. Yuriy 
Kotenkov, one of the founding members, told an RIA correspondent 
that the union intends to defend the rights, freedom, and 
sovereignty of the 400,000 Russians in the republic. As a last 
resort to accomplish their goal, Kotenkov said, the organization 
reserves the right to rise up in revolt against tyranny and 
oppression.

  [Text] Tallinn, Apr 08, BNS -- The Estonian Statistics 
Department reports that the consumer price index [CPI] rose by 
8.9 percent in March compared to the previous month. The 
figure, which is one of the biggest in the post-currency reform 
period, exceeded even the most pessimistic forecasts. 
  Goods and services went up by 5.2 percent in January and by 
5.5 percent in February. 
  Viktoria Trasanov, head of the Statistics Department's price 
statistics service, told BNS the increase in the CPI is first 
and foremost attributable to the rising of rents and communal 
transport and telephone tariffs. 
  Services went up by 15.5 percent in March and goods, by 5.3 
percent. Food prices rose by 7.5 percent and manufactured 
goods, by 1.5 percent. Goods and services cost last month 50.5 
percent more than in March 1993. 
  Housing expenditures grew last month the most, by 18.5 
percent. Milk and eggs rose by 13.3 percent; transport and 
communications cost 9.7 percent more; meat and fish went up by 
8.2 percent; and flour and cereals, as well as fruit and 
vegetables, rose by 8 percent. Outlays on health dropped by a 
negligible 1.1 percent. 
  The March inflation rate exceeded the Bank of Estonia 
forecasts of a rise of up to 5.68 percent. Trasanov said the 
central bank built its forecast on an up to 10-percent increase 
in rents, but actually the rents redoubled early in the month. 
  Inflation hit record high in Estonia in November 1992, when 
it reached 9.5 percent.

  [Text] Latvian State President Guntis Ulmanis, speaking 
today at the meeting of heads of local authorities at Kuldiga, 
announced that he has put off for an indefinite period the visit 
to Russia he planned to make on 20 April. During the visit he 
was to meet the Russian president and possibly sign the 
agreements initialled by Latvia and Russia. Ulmanis explained 
that the reason for this decision was the edict by Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin on the creation of military bases in the 
CIS states and Latvia. Moreover, immediately after receiving 
the report, Ulmanis had proposed a talk with the Russian 
president. Yet he has still not received a reply. Ulmanis also 
has been trying unsuccessfully for two days to talk to Leonid 
Mayorov, commander of the Russian Army's Northwestern Group of 
Forces. Ulmanis has the impression that Mayorov is deliberately 
avoiding talking. Ulmanis does not rule out the possibility 
that Yeltsin's decree might have come about in connection with a 
power struggle in Russia and disagreements between the Foreign 
Ministry and military corps in Russia. Ulmanis is also planning 
to present a proposal to the presidium of the Saeima on Saturday 
to cancel the extraordinary plenary session on 15 April, in the 
belief that at present there is no sense in discussing powers to 
sign the initialled agreements because in such a situation as 
this the signing of the agreements is not possible.

  [Text] Riga, Apr 07, BNS -- The current Latvian foreign 
policy promotes the strengthening of Russia's influence in 
Latvia, Saeima (parliament) Deputy Speaker Andrejs Krastins said 
Thursday [8 April] at a conference in the Academy of Science. 
  The initialed agreements on troop withdrawal is only one of 
the examples of the tendency, Krastins said. 
  The world community is unlikely to help Latvia substantially 
if Russia uses military force against it and this will be a 
result of the present Latvian foreign policy, Krastins noted. 
To prevent this, Latvia should distance itself from Russia both 
economically and politically because "Russia is our sole 
potential enemy," Krastins said. Unfortunately, Krastins said, 
many Latvian politicians fail to understand this truth partly 
because of inertia and party because of exaggerated liberalism. 
  Krastins described the initialed Latvian-Russian agreements 
as intentions of the ruling coalition to attribute all merits 
for Russian troop withdrawal to itself. 
  Russian President Boris Yeltsin's decision to build military 
bases in the CIS and Latvia and the following excuses with "a 
technical error" stand "just another ordinary sample" of 
Russia's foreign policy, Krastins said. 
  On the other hand, the incident convinced part of the 
Latvian 
community that Latvia needs the troop withdrawal agreement with 
Russia to avert the setup of Russian bases here, Krastins said. 
  The Skrunda radar station, however, is and will remain a 
military base though there are attempts to call it differently, 
Krastins added. 
  Krastins summed up his address saying that Latvia vitally 
needs to integrate into Europe. 
  Krastins is one of the leaders in the oppositionary Latvian 
National Independence Movement. 
  The meeting was organized by the Baltic Center for Strategic 
Studies and the Academy of Sciences.

<F P=106> [Article by Eriks Matulis: "LNNK Formulates Demands in </F>
Talks with Russia"] 
  [Text] Riga, 26 Mar -- At a board meeting of the Movement 
for Latvian National Independence [LNNK] on Saturday [26 March], 
a mutual resolution of the LNNK and its parliamentary faction 
was accepted on "interstate negotiations with Russia." The 
resolution states that the agreements with Russia were initialed 
"contrary to the CSCE declaration and the UN resolution on 
complete and unconditional troop withdrawal." LNNK is of the 
opinion that initialing these agreements means including Latvia 
in the sphere of Russian influence, as well as endangering 
Latvia's sovereignty and the Latvian nation's possibilities to 
survive. The resolution reads: "By accepting the initialed 
agreements, Latvia does not resolve the problems connected with 
troop withdrawal, because Russian Army units remain in Skrunda, 
as well as in Estonia and Abrene." 
  Therefore, the LNNK board asks the president not to sign the 
agreements. In addition, the Saeima [parliament] is requested 
to pass -- in the first place -- a law on the status of 
foreigners and stateless people, as well as appoint a new 
delegation to the talks with Russia, which would resolve not 
only the problem of troop withdrawal, but also such issues as 
repatriation, emigration, the return of Abrene to Latvia, and 
compensation for Latvia from Russia, as the legal heir to the 
USSR. 
  The resolution also requests that the Saeima accept the 
submitted draft law on a popular referendum, to which a question 
should be added concerning citizens' opinions on the issue of 
granting guarantees of social protection to Russian military 
pensioners. 
  If the Saeima does not satisfy these demands, LNNK will 
propose a popular ballot for special parliamentary elections. 
  At the LNNK board meeting, candidates for the Riga municipal 
authorities elections were also chosen. In all, there were 61 
candidates confirmed. Their names were not conveyed to the 
press. As DIENA was told by LNNK Board Member Mirdza Vitola, the 
decision was not yet final.

  [Text] Riga, Apr 08, BNS -- President Guntis Ulmanis 
questions the necessity for the April 15 extraordinary session 
of the country's parliament which had to decide on the signature 
of the Latvian-Russian troop withdrawal agreement. 
  Ulmanis pledged to make up his mind in few days and inform 
the parliament presidium about his decision. 
  Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs claims that the plenary 
session 
would be "useless." In his opinion, Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin's April 5 decree on the setup of military bases was "a 
deliberate action" that excludes the option of immediate 
signature of the initialed agreement. 
  As reported, the extraordinary plenary session was proposed 
by Ulmanis and Birkavs. 
  Ulmanis also told BNS he was not satisfied with the 
apologies 
by Russian Ambassador Aleksandr Rannikh who called the incident 
as "a technical mistake." 
  In Ulmanis' words, rush decisions should be avoided because 
the situation in Latvia is highly complicated. "I need at least 
24 hours to reason it all," he said.

  [Text] Geneva April 9 TASS -- U.N. Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali met on Saturday Latvian Prime Minister Valdis 
Birkavs at his request to discuss Russian troops withdrawal and 
guarantees of national minorities' rights in Latvia. 
  After the 45-minute meeting Birkavs told an ITAR-TASS 
correspondent that his visit to Geneva was caused by a "new 
situation" called forth by the April 5 instruction by the 
Russian president stipulating, in particular, creation of 
military bases on Latvian territory. In his words, this 
situation "has brought about an extremely high political 
tension" and requires an "utterly new assessment and additional 
international support". The Latvian prime minister believes 
this document should be officially withdrawn "at the highest 
level". 
  Birkavs gave to understand that the instruction had 
complicated the signing of an agreement with Russia on troops 
withdrawal. However, Latvia is ready to sign such an agreement, 
he said. 
  According to Birkavs, Another subject for discussion during 
the meeting with Butrus-Ghali was the "so-called violations of 
human rights" in Latvia. "I would like to say that in its turn, 
upon troops withdrawal, a law on citizenship which will take 
into account many recommendations of the Council of Europe and 
the CSCE high commissioner for national minorities will be 
adopted", Birkavs said.

<F P=106> [Article by Eriks Matulis: "Problems With Puduri Station </F>
Arose Due to Uncertain Latvian-Russian Border"] 
  [Text] Riga, 24 Mar -- Today, in compliance with a 
proposal by the "Fatherland and Freedom" faction, the Saeima 
[parliament] conveyed a request to Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs 
asking him to clarify the circumstances under which the Puduri 
railway station situated on Latvian territory, at the village 
Baltinava, was turned over to Russian administration, and what 
steps the government intends to take to resolve problems 
connected with this issue. 
  In Autumn 1991, the structure of "Soviet Railways" was 
liquidated. It was then that "Baltic Railways," which was part 
of the old system, turned the Puduri railway station over to 
Russia. The board of "Baltic Railways" made this decision 
without discussing the matter with the Latvian Government, 
Robert Milbergs, head of the parliamentary Commission on 
Investigation, told DIENA. 
  As Vladimirs Zacharovs, chief of the Latvian Prosecutor's 
Office Transport Department, who is investigating the case, told 
DIENA today, after the annexation of the Abrene district by 
Russia in 1946, the border dividing the two states was not 
precisely delineated. It was only mentioned that the border 
follows the river, but the river course has changed after 
drainage operations. 
  A high-ranking official of the joint stock company "Baltic 
Railways," who did not want his name mentioned, stated that he 
thinks the "Fatherland and Freedom" request is baseless, as in 
1991 the administrative borders clearly showed that Puduri 
station is situated on Russian territory. This can be confirmed 
by simply looking at a map. 
  The Saeima will investigate the controversy over Puduri 
station and all problems related to the borders, during its 
spring session, after it receives clarification from the Cabinet 
of Ministers.

Ulmanis, who also heads the country's voluntary paramilitary 
organization, the Home Guard, met Friday [8 April] with its 
Kuldiga branch Commander Egons Granatskis and discussed 
cooperation opportunities between Home Guard and police. 
  Granatskis told Ulmanis that the recent directives that 
demand strict coordination of all Home Guard actions with state 
institutions make quick actions impossible. 
  Commenting on financial issues, Ulmanis said that he and 
Staff Cmdr. Juris Eihmanis would decide on the distribution of 
state budget funding for the needs of the Home Guard. Home 
Guards should be allowed to perform private guarding orders in 
addition to their direct service duties, said Granatskis. 
  Ulmanis said he planned to tour all Latvian Home Guard 
battalions soon to acquaint himself with the work and problems 
of Home Guards.

  [Text] Riga, Apr 08, BNS -- Latvian Interior Minister 
Girts Kristovskis, commenting on an open letter by the Press 
Publishers and Editors Association and the Media Foundation, 
said Friday [8 April] that his ministry is ready to put guards 
in the Press House in case of necessity. 
  The letter to Kristovskis and Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs, 
published by several day newspapers recently, complained of 
attempts by organized criminals to control the press. 
  Last month, people were beaten up publicly in the Press 
House 
and offices of newspapers and the Press House administration 
threatened, according to the letter. 
  The authors of the letter demand that the Interior Ministry 
ensures the security of the 20-storey Press House, which houses 
offices of numerous editions, as well as a large printing 
office. Kristovskis said that he had heard about the events in 
the Press House but received, so far, no claims as a minister. 
In addition, the publication of the open letter may have create 
wrong impression that the Interior Ministry refuses to perform 
its duties, Kristovskis said. Kristovskis says he read the 
letter only in newspapers but never received it himself.

Latvia. It is completely cleared up until 1 June this year, when 
possibly the issue of the Russian state budget and the ability 
of Ostankino to pay for the relay of its programs to the Latvian 
Radio and Television Center will be solved. Until 1 June 
Ostankino will be relayed at its present extent, on condition 
that losses incurred by the relays not paid for will not be 
covered from the Latvian state budget. Likewise, the Latvian 
Radio and Television Council maintains the right to deploy free 
broadcasting time to other programs. The Council resolved to 
announce a competition for free air time on Latvian television 
networks. It will decide separately on the terms of the 
competition.

  [Text] Vilnius, Apr 08, BNS -- The Lithuanian parliament 
on Thursday [7 April] adopted a law on excises and passed 
several amendments to the value-added tax law. Both laws come 
into effect May 1. 
  The size of excises will be determined by the government. 
According to the new law, excises will be imposed on beer, 
chocolate, cocoa, liquors, tobacco, jewelry, gasoline, diesel 
fuel, luxury cars, as well as publication of erotic or violent 
nature. Excises will not be applied to coffee and electric 
energy. 
  Finance Minister Eduardas Vilkelis told Lithuanian TV that 
the excises law should not strongly affect prices, although some 
goods may become more expensive. 
  The value-added tax will replace the currently existing 
18-percent general excise tax. The new tax rate is also 18 
percent. The value-added tax will be imposed on all import, 
including energy. 
  The amendments adopted Thursday create slightly more 
favorable conditions for local producers. Payment of the tax 
may be put off to enterprises that import much material 
resources. The parliament also extended the term of paying the 
tax. 
  According to various estimations, the value-added tax will 
increase prices by an average of 8 to 10 percent. But Vilkelis 
said a package of documents on compensations for the price-leap 
will soon follow. The minister said the government intends to 
raise pensions and budget salaries by no less than 10 percent 
May 1.

  [Text] Vilnius, Apr 08, BNS -- Some 100 to 150 people in 
Vilnius may be related to communists and Russian 
ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's party, the LIETUVOS 
RYTAS newspaper reported with reference to the Lithuanian 
National Security Service. 
  The newspaper said several members of the underground in 
Vilnius and some other Lithuanian towns are constantly watched. 
The security service knows secret addresses and routes used to 
deliver underground communist publications to Lithuania from 
Belarus and the Kaliningrad region, LIETUVOS AIDAS [as received] 
said. 
  According to the report, the communist underground and 
Zhirinovskiy's supporters became especially active when coup 
leaders were amnestied in Russia. 
  Leaflets claiming that Lithuania is a historical territory 
of 
Russia and that Lithuanians are assimilated Slavs appeared in 
some parts of Vilnius in late March. 
  LIETUVOS AIDAS said the security service sees no need to 
detain any members of the underground yet because their 
activities pose no major threat and it is better to watch them 
in order to reveal the whole system. 
  The newspaper pointed out a connection between the communist 
underground and the recently created Socialist Party of 
Lithuania, whose program was published in an underground 
communist newspaper.

<F P=106> [Report by Audrius Baciulis: "A Very Heated and </F>
Confidential Meeting"] 
  [Text] The meeting of the Lithuanian Democratic Labor 
Party [LDDP] Presidium, which began at 0700 on Thursday [31 
March], was only concluded this morning. According to 
information obtained by RESPUBLIKA, the six-hour discussion on 
national defense problems was very heated. The meeting was 
attended by Prime Minister A. Slezevicius, National Defense 
Minister L. Linkevicius, leaders of the LDDP and its faction, 
members of the Seimas [parliament] National Security Committee 
[NSC] who belong to the LDDP faction, and V. Juskus, chairman of 
the Seimas Commission for Investigating Economic Crimes. 
  Participants in the meeting decided not to provide any 
information to the press and restrict themselves to an official 
report (by doing this they deprived the press of the chance to 
present objective and overall information) which was circulated 
yesterday by the government rather than the party spokesman. 
According to the information, the meeting heard L. Linkevicius' 
report entitled "National Defense: Condition and Perspective," 
discussed the overall concept of defense, the upgrading of the 
national defense system, and closer cooperation among the 
National Defense Ministry [KAM], the government, and the NSC. 
  According to RESPUBLIKA information, the larger part of the 
meeting was devoted to the clarification of relations between 
the KAM and the NSC. The meeting drew the conclusion that there 
were no contradictions in principle and proposed to resolve the 
existing mutual claims. According to one participant in the 
meeting, who wished to remain anonymous, the failure to do so 
"can mean trouble." According to the words of another 
participant, the meeting demanded the L. Linkevicius toughen up 
order in the Army so officers do not discuss whether the Army 
needs a commander or not. Participants in the meeting also 
insisted on an investigation into the fate of the property of 
the [former Soviet] Society for Assisting Army, Air Force, and 
Navy. Explanations concerning this issue should be provided by 
former National Defense Minister A. Butkevicius and current 
Deputy Minister J. Gecas. 
  NSC members were reprimanded for violating the law and 
providing secret information to the press. As the third person 
who wanted to remain anonymous said, if NSC members continue to 
violate the law, "relevant conclusions will be drawn." Some 
representatives of the LDDP faction demanded that the NSC not 
admit journalists to its meetings in the future. 
  The fourth participant of the meeting, who did not want to 
be 
named, said that V. Juskus, chairman of the Seimas Commissions 
for Economic Crimes, had stated with determination that as long 
as he headed the commissions, the national defense case 
[reference to arms deals] would be investigated to the very end. 
J. Juskus demanded that some LDDP faction members did not hang 
around the prosecutor's office and interfere with the 
investigation. [LDDP faction chief] J. Karosas denied this 
information. He told RESPUBLIKA that neither he nor the other 
four faction members impeded the investigation of the national 
defense case, but only inquired to the prosecutor's office 
whether "this matter was not forgotten." 
  According to information from the editorial office, the next 
meeting may address the fate of L. Linkevicius. There were also 
proposals to demilitarize the KAM by placing all servicemen and 
the counterintelligence service under the Army commander, and to 
reduce the staff at the ministry and its International Relations 
Department.

<F P=106> [From "News Bulletin" No. 474] </F>
  [Text] Vilnius, April 8, ELTA -- Seimas [parliament] 
opposition leader Vytautas Landsbergis commented a statement 
signed by five factions of opposition "On tensions in national 
defence structures". 
  Authors of the statement -- elders of the Motherland's 
Union, 
Christian Democratic, Lithuanian Nationalists, Democratic and 
Freedom factions -- have said that various facts including 
searches in flats of military officers violating the 
Constitution are showing artificially created tensions. 
  The document said that "one of basic sources of the tension 
is the present activity of Seimas National security committee 
and its leading group, the wrong way chosen to exceed powers of 
parliamentary control and to take on functions of executive 
power." That is why "distrust in the chairman of the committee 
grew up as well as the necessity to change the composition of 
the committee," the opposition said. 
  Landsbergis told the news conference the committee, instead 
of preparing documents for the programme "Partnership for 
Peace," national security concept and other strategic documents, 
was seeking to take over the management of the whole national 
defence system. 
  Asked by journalists Landsbergis said the Motherland's Union 
was not approving the procedure of non-confidence in the present 
government launched by social-democrats. "We are for moral and 
political interpellation to the ruling Democratic Labour Party 
(LDDP) but not to the government of Adolfas Slezevicius", he 
explained. 
  He also said he did not see any "reserves for ruling party 
to 
form a better government". He hinted that "Motherland's Union 
plans to make a very clear and concrete step concerning 
political future of Lithuania next week."

<F P=106> [From "News Bulletin" No. 474] </F>
  [Text] Vilnius, April 8, ELTA -- Lithuanian radio and TV 
board has appealed to the government asking to allot money to 
re-transmit "Ostankino" TV and "Mayak" radio programmes in 
Lithuania. The board chairman Gediminas Ilgunas confirmed this 
in a news conference on Friday [8 April]. 
  If the government approves the offer, "Ostankino" programme 
would be seen shorter than previously: daily from 18.00 until 
the end or 45 hours a week. It would cost about 800,000 Lt 
[litas] a year, Ilgunas said. 
  Programme of "Mayak" radio is suggested to broadcast only in 
ultra-short range daily from 7.00 to 24.00. 
  Shortening of the programme or refusing it is determined by 
the fact that "Ostankino" company that had earlier paid for 
re-transmission of its programmes in Lithuania now refused to do 
that. At the moment, the company is heavily indebted to 
Lithuanian communication services. 
  Free time of the 2nd TV channel where only "Ostankino" 
programmes had been shown is planned to lease for private TV 
companies in a competition.

  [Text] Chechnya has appealed to all countries to denounce 
the actions by the Russian leadership aimed, as it believes, at 
destabilizing the political situation in the Chechen Republic. 
The statement by the Chechen Foreign Ministry spread in Groznyy 
on Friday describes as a flagrant interference into the affairs 
of an independent state the Russian Federal Assembly's decision 
"On the Political Settlement of Relations between the Federal 
Bodies of Power and the authorities in the Chechen Republic." 
  The decision envisages the holding of free elections to the 
top power bodies of the Chechen Republic as a condition for the 
continuation of the talks aimed at signing a Russian-Chechen 
Treaty. 
  The actions of different power bodies of the Russian 
Federation point to a new stage in aggravating the situation 
around the Chechen Republic, says the statement. It expresses 
readiness to continue the talks aimed at settling the relations 
with Russia on a civilized basis and in accordance with the 
principles of international law.

  [Text] Moscow April 11 TASS -- An aide of Chechen President 
Dzhokhar Dudayev was wounded in a gangland shootout and placed 
into the central hospital in Groznyy, CRIME-PRESS learned on 
Monday from Chechen opposition members from the Nadterek region 
of the southern republic who are currently staying in Moscow. 
  The sources added that R. Labazanov, who is Dudayev's aide 
on 
most important issues and a close friend of the rebel president, 
is being guarded by over 200 armed people. 
  According to the sources, Labazanov is heading a gang of 500 
gunmen whose major business is kidnapping of girls who are then 
sold as prostitutes to Central Asia, the Middle East or northern 
Africa. The girls are reportedly smuggled out via Georgia and 
Azerbaijan. 
  The sources said that the Labazanov's gang is especially 
active in the Nadterek region which is known for its resolute 
opposition to Dudayev. They try to intimidate the people by 
violence, robberies and murders and thus establish control over 
the region, they added.

"Republic of Ingushetia"] 
  [Text] In a press conference yesterday, Republic of 
Ingushetia President Aushev related his impressions of his 
participation in a 7 April private session of the Federation 
Council of the Russian Federation that looked at the situation 
in the Ossetia-Ingushetia conflict zone and confirmed an edict 
of the Russian Federation president on extending of the state of 
emergency on part on the territories of the Republic of North 
Ossetia and the Republic of Ingushetia. The Ingushetia 
president is known to have walked out, stating that the edict 
took no account of the Ingush side's wishes regarding the 
narrowing of the state of emergency zone down to Prigorodnyy 
Rayon, the scene of hostilities in October-November 1992, and 
the placing of the rayon governing bodies under the Provisional 
Administration. None of the points in the Russian Federation 
president's edict had been agreed on with the Ingush side, 
whereas the remarks of the Ingush "vis-a-vis" from Vladikavkaz 
had been reflected in the text of the edict. 
  Insisting on his own version that Russia and, in particular, 
Sergey Shakhray, its vice premier and minister for the affairs 
of nationalities and regional policy of the Russian Federation, 
remain guilty for the conflict that continues between the 
republics of the Federation, Ingushetia President Aushev doubted 
the wisdom of Ingushetia's remaining in the role of Russian 
Federation component if this does not find practical expression.

  [Text] Head of the nuclear safety research center of the 
Socio- Environmental Union Vladimir Chechetkin has expressed 
fears about a possible leak of liquid nuclear waste pumped into 
underground streams at a nuclear facility outside Krasnoyarsk 
named Krasnoyarsk-26. 
  In an interview with Interfax, he said that no thorough 
geological study of the area had been conducted though the 
underground nuclear waste storage at the Severny test site had 
been in use for 30 years. 
  Chechetkin does not rule out that the nuclear waste is not 
leaking out onto the surface through cracks. The test site is 
about five kilometers away from the Yenisey River, a fact 
causing particular worry by Russian environmentalists. 
  He also spoke of as many as 10 contaminated spots being 
found 
along the main pipeline through which the waste is pumped from 
the facility to the site, with radiation levels 200 times higher 
than normal background radiation. Among other substances, the 
waste contains plutonium whose half life is 24,000 years. 
  Experts fear that contamination may spread over a larger 
area. This raises particular dangers in as the plant management 
obtained a licence for collecting wild berries, mushrooms and 
herbs there. 
  Chechetkin said that plans were under way to put up a new 
facility for reprocessing nuclear fuel and that the project 
provided for the burial of tritium at the Severny site. He 
warned about dire implications from the continued pumping of 
liquid nuclear waste underground.

Temryukskiy, and Slavyanskiy Rayons have sent an "open letter" 
to the kray administration chief, the head of the internal 
affairs administration, and the atamans of the all-Kuban and 
Kuban cossack troops issuing a tough ultimatum. 
  "Our patience is at an end," the cossacks stated, protesting 
at what in their opinion is the planned settlement of Kuban by 
Caucasians. "And we resolutely inform you that to avoid an 
ethnic explosion in our rayons you must take urgent steps to 
expel those who, having arrived in Kuban, are stirring up 
trouble, sowing interethnic hostility, and making the Kuban 
people hostage.... Unless you take resolute steps we retain the 
right to raise the people to a public tribunal against the 
Caucasians who are violating our traditions and customs."

  [Text] Chita April 11 TASS -- The military seem to have 
lost patience with the crisis of non-payment and the 
dictatorship of the monopoly energy suppliers in Russia. 
Informed sources in the administration of the Chita region have 
told ITAR-TASS about two cases of army units seizing power 
installations in eastern Trans-Baykalia in the first ten days of 
April. 
  The first incident was reported in the Borzinsk district, 
where the power suppliers cut electricity supplies to one of the 
military units which failed to pay for the earlier supplies. 
The army reacted promptly by occupying an electricity 
substation. 
  Some days later a similar case was reported in the 
Chernyshevsky district. Both conflicts were settled only after 
state authorities intervened. 
  The army units stationed on the territory of eastern trans- 
Baykalia have not been adequately financed for some time already 
and owe the electric power sector about five billion roubles 
(2,822 million dollars)

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Kuzmenkin, VECHERNYY NOVOSIBIRSK </F>
political observer: "City Something..."] 
  [Text]The city electoral commission started to work 
right away, and several days after the elections to the 
Novosibirsk City Deputy Assembly we have an opportunity to learn 
about the results of the voting in each of the 25 electoral 
districts. The dry figures lead to interesting 
speculation--there will be more about them a little later; 
first, the main thing. 
  The main thing is that Novosibirsk residents elected only 10 
of the 25 deputies to the city Assembly. These 10 of the 
people's elect will soon receive temporary certificates, but it 
is still too early to say anything definite about the organ we 
elected, or even simply to state whether it exists or not! The 
fact is that there simply are no regulatory documents--they 
apparently forgot to write them. So SOMETHING exists in 
Novosibirsk, but we can say nothing about the details. For now 
the mayor has added some clarity: Viktor Tolokonskiy stated that 
the deputies must begin their work and that he personally will 
do everything necessary to make sure that this happens as 
quickly as possible. 
<H5>  1. ONLY ONE OUT OF FOUR VOTED... </H5>
  Of the 1,065,304 registered voters, 267,977 were not too 
lazy 
to come to the electoral precincts. This is only 25.2 percent of 
the overall number of voters. And if that were not bad enough, 
some of our compatriots preferred either to destroy their 
ballots or take them for souvenirs, as a result of which the 
electoral commissions, to their regret, found in the ballot 
boxes (the word is somehow fitting) an even smaller 
percentage--22.8 percent. But the rayons voted in different 
ways. For example, residents of Zayeltsovskiy Rayon contrived 
to elect all three of their deputies and the residents of 
Pervomayskiy and Tsentralnyy Rayons elected their one each. 
That was the maximum, and then came: Kalininskiy--two out of 
three, Dzerzhinskiy--one out of two, Sovetskiy--the same, 
Oktyabrskiy--one out of three. Three rayons were left out of 
the game: Residents of Zheleznodorozhnyy Rayon were unable to 
elect their one deputy; Kirovskiy residents elected none of 
their three deputies; and voters of Leninskiy Rayon failed to 
elect even one out of five.... 
<H5>  2. DEPUTIES </H5>
  Be that as it may, we did manage to elect 10 deputies. We 
have published the lists so there is no point in repeating them; 
let us note only the most interesting details. In the first 
place, 11 deputies from the former city soviet were vying for 
mandates at the same time: the largest number--three--in 
Kalininskiy Rayon, and not a single one in Pervomayskiy, 
Tsentralnyy, or Zheleznodorozhnyy. Only one of them was 
ultimately successful: Vasiliy Krivoshchekov was elected in 
Kalininskiy Rayon. 
  Second, only three of the deputies were nominated by voter 
associations. That same Krivoshchekov was nominated by the Club 
of Deputies and Voters, Georgiy Chulinin--Russia's Choice, and 
Aleksandr Mankov--Working Novosibirsk. 
  Third, the city's mayor confirmed his authority and a good 
deal of popularity: Viktor Tolokonskiy in competition with three 
opponents was able to win 51.7 percent of the votes. 
  Let us note also that Nadezhda Boltenko in Zayeltsovskiy 
Rayon was able to pass up two former city soviet deputies at 
once: She won more votes than both of the aforementioned 
deputies together. Aleksandr Mankov also won over two former 
deputies, but in Kalininskiy Rayon. And in general the voters 
preferred to see in the city Assembly people who are removed 
from the political battles: Many of them work in production. 
<H5>  3. GEOGRAPHY </H5>
  Political geography is an extremely curious thing. Take, for 
example, Dzerzhinskiy Rayon: In three districts communists 
solidly gathered 22-32 percent, holding second places. In 
Zheleznodorozhnyy Rayon the one with the largest number of votes 
was the representative from the Yavlinskiy bloc, Gennadiy Popov, 
and in Zayeltsovskiy preference was given to independent 
candidates. Quite diverse people won in Kalininskiy while the 
administration chief, Vladimir Afanasyev, won easily in 
Kirovskiy, garnering more than 40 percent of the votes. In 
Sovetskiy, on the contrary, administrators met with complete 
defeat and the chief of the administration and his deputy lost. 
Oktyabrskiy Rayon made an interesting decision; here the 
general director of the Novosibirsk directorate of 
Mosbiznesbank, Anatoliy Zvyagin, became a deputy, and in another 
district the leader was Vasiliy Vereteno, who was nominated by 
the Siberian branch of the International Association of 
Enterprise Leaders. 
<H5>  4. SYMPATHIES </H5>
  An interesting picture emerges here too. True, it is 
necessary to do one thing: We will count those who gathered the 
most votes in their district but still did not become deputies 
because of a confluence of circumstances (voter apathy, poor 
positioning of the stars, etc.) but simply the winners. This 
simplifies things considerably: Ultimately the discussion can be 
only about 
sympathies. 
  Well, let us publish, as they say, the whole list. The 
anti-Yeltsin opposition had a serious stake in the elections to 
the city Assembly. Although, true, they still could not reach 
agreement among themselves. As a result the communists would 
put up one person, Working Novosibirsk--two, and Homeland--one. 
The oblast organization of the Communist Party of the Russian 
Federation ran seven candidates--one took first, three took 
second, and three failed. Working Novosibirsk received two 
firsts, two seconds, and again three failed. Homeland's 
indicators are not as good: one first, one second, and five 
"zilch." Representatives of the National Salvation Front and 
the Novosibirsk people's assembly lost solidly.... The Liberal 
Democratic Party, which intended to install three of its members 
as deputies, suffered a painful defeat--all of its candidates 
did badly, and the leader, Kirill Volobuyev, in his own 
electoral district received half as many votes as his only 
opponent. 
  Now let us look at the other side. Democrats received five 
first places: two for Club of Deputies and Voters, and one each 
for Russia's Choice, Yavlintsy, and Forum. Only the candidate 
from Democratic Russia won no laurels. Russia's Choice gained a 
first and a second place. The ones that looked weakest were the 
candidates from the Forum voter club: one first place and two 
failures. Note that the SOTSPROF trade union failed: a second 
place and two "zilch" and the same fate befell the only 
candidate from Unity. And for the Club of Deputies and Voters 
the indicators are these: two first places and an equal number 
of failures. 
  As for the administrators, here not everything is so simple. 
The mayor won quite confidently, the head of the administration 
was also on top, but the head of the administration of Sovetskiy 
Rayon lost by a mile to his only opponent. As for their 
deputies, one out of the four took second place. 
  In general there are stable sympathies for the center and 
the 
people who were able to convince the voters that they were the 
"movers and shakers." If all the deputies had been elected, the 
two administrators would have been joined by 12 independent 
(from whom?) deputies, six representatives of democratic blocs, 
and four from the opposition. 
  Now a little about the details. In face-to-face 
confrontations between supporters of the current reforms and 
representatives of the opposition the former won six times and 
the later won four times. Seven times the opposition kept itself 
from winning. The Communist Party, Working Novosibirsk, and 
Homeland frequently battled against one another, apparently 
remaining true to the old ideological principle: "And who the 
hell are you?" Another interesting detail: Young leaders of the 
LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] and RCWP [Russian 
Communist Workers Party] (nonetheless already the top people in 
their parties) ran in two districts--the chairman of the 
Novosibirsk branch of the former, Kirill Bolobuyev, and the 
secretary of the oblast committee of the latter, Sergey 
Krupenko. Both suffered serious defeats and both lost to women: 
a teacher and a physician. Women, incidentally, came in first 
in seven out of 25 cases. 
<H5>  5. CONTINUATION FOLLOWS </H5>
  There will apparently be nothing to report on the 
Novosibirsk 
Assembly itself in the near future, but we will definitely try 
to tell you about the deputies and their work.

TASS] 
  [Text] Minsk, 8 Apr -- "The campaign to elect our first 
president, which is now under way, is being accompanied by a 
stepping up of political and media tension around the Army and 
its daily activities," according to a statement issued today by 
the Collegium of the Belarus Defense Ministry. The statement 
points out that "the Armed Forces of Belarus, which are intended 
for the armed defense of their country and the protection of its 
sovereignty and state integrity, must not be an arena for 
political confrontation by any political parties and 
sociopolitical movements whatsoever." 
  The statement declares that all attempts to destabilize the 
political neutrality of the Army and its loyalty to the laws of 
Belarus will be decisively nipped in the bud. At the same time, 
the document states, "we will preserve restraint and good sense, 
we will not allow ourselves to be drawn into political battles 
and propaganda actions."

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 68 (558): </F>
Compiled by Nikolai Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy, edited by 
Vladimir Shishlin] 
  [Text] Speaking at a first meeting of the new government of 
the Republic, President Mircea Snegur noted that he started his 
activities "in a very difficult period." In this connection, he 
singled out four main factors of the future activities of the 
Cabinet. 
  First, organizational. "It is not enough when the government 
gets corresponding authorities from the parliament. It should 
be efficient, functional, take decisions in time, suggesting 
draft laws, necessary mechanisms and implementing them," the 
president said. 
  Second, time factor. In Snegur's opinion, the reorganization 
of ministries and departmeent should be carried out quicklu and 
with a considerable reduction of their personnel. The president 
said that in the past four years the share of state clerks in 
the total number of employed grew four times, state budget 
spendings for maintainance of the personnel rose from 0.8 
percent in 1989 to 3.2 percent in 1993, and their salaries 
exceeded the average ones in the republic twice. 
  In the opinion of the president, this tendency is 
characteristic for the controlling bodies. Snegur spoke in 
favor of their reduction, pertinent to the need for the merger 
of the state control bodies and the existing controlling bodies 
attached to ministries and departments. 
  The president named the third priority: the preparation by 
the government of its program for the next two-three years. In 
his opinion, this program can be worked out by 1 July. The 
president thinks that it should envisage acceleration of 
restructuring and moderniation of the national economy, 
activization of privatization and social support for the 
population. 
  The president said the fourth priority is the personnel 
issue. In his opinion, now "exact selection and professional 
training of top executives" are important. 
  The government decided at its first meeting to recommend the 
parliament in the near future to ratify the signed agreements on 
Moldova's entry in the CIS and the Economic Union. At the moment 
of the Presidential Bulletin's publishing, it was announced that 
the parliament ratified on Friday the agreement on the creation 
of the CIS with amendments proceeding from the republic's 
legislation, as well as the treaty on the creation of the 
economic union. The changes concern in particular the 
non-alignment of the republic to military agreements, and 
non-participation in setting up unified armed forced and the 
ruble zone.

  [Text] An extended meeting of the Kyrgyz Government took 
place in Bishkek yesterday. It was chaired by Prime Minister 
Dzhumagulov, and was attended by leaders of ministries, 
departments, and enterprises. The meeting discussed how to 
raise industry out of crisis. 
  The situation is very serious. In March, 65 enterprises 
ground to a halt. The production capacities of the remaining 
ones are half used. Warehouses have a surplus of goods in 
stock. Light industry alone is overstocked with goods to the 
value of 63.6 million soms and the level of indebtedness exceeds 
700 million soms. 
  A resolution was adopted on this issue and steps have been 
specified aimed at lifting the country's industry out of crisis.

<F P=106> [Interview with Tajik Supreme Council Chairman Emomali </F>
Rakhmonov by RIA-NOVOSTI correspondent Andrey Pravov in 
Islamabad, under the "Diplomacy" rubric; date not given: 
"Emomali Rakhmonov: All Constructive Forces in the Region Are 
Interested in Peace...." -- first paragraph is introduction] 
  [Text] A delegation from the Republic of Tajikistan headed 
by Supreme Council Chairman Emomali Rakhmonov is visiting 
Pakistan in an official capacity. Here we offer our readers an 
interview he gave to Andrey Pravov, RIA-NOVOSTI's correspondent 
in Islamabad. 
  [Pravov] In your view, Mr. Chairman, what role could 
Pakistan play in resolving the issue of settling the situation 
in Tajikistan? 
  [Rakhmonov] We regard Pakistan as a friendly state. 
Islamabad is keen to offer assistance in resolving problems 
relating to a peace settlement in Tajikistan. We welcome any 
initiatives on this issue, which is of vital importance to us, 
wherever they originate -- from the United Nations, Moscow, 
Tehran, or Islamabad. We are being offered help and we 
gratefully receive it. 
  Quite apart from anything else, this approach has an 
entirely 
pragmatic basis. Central Asia, and Tajikistan in particular, is 
an inexhaustible market for Pakistani products of every kind, 
including industrial goods. Pakistani businesspeople are also 
attracted here by the richness and diversity of our raw material 
resources. On the geographical level, moreover, Pakistan may be 
viewed as an extremely important transit route for shipment of 
goods from Central Asian states to the sea. 
  [Pravov] But, of course, in order to establish such 
extensive ties, surely you will have to settle the situation in 
Afghanistan first of all? 
  [Rakhmonov] This is true, of course. The continuing war in 
Afghanistan is an extremely serious problem for both our states. 
But, as far as a land transit route from Tajikistan to Pakistan 
and back is concerned, it may be realizable in the not too 
distant future. Basically, our two countries' borders are just 
19 km apart in Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Oblast's 
Ishkashimskiy Rayon. The most likely route linking our two 
countries across Afghanistan is probably the so-called Vakhan 
Corridor. This is the gateway to the Karakoram triangle -- the 
area where the borders of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India meet. 
  [Pravov] Do you think that land transit toward the Arabian 
Sea could be established even if hostilities continue? 
  [Rakhmonov] Afghanistan must resolve this problem in any 
case. If it does not, we are unlikely to see any trade or 
economic projects materializing in the region as a whole. 
Moreover, the conflict is also dangerous because the 
conflagration of war could spread across state borders, not just 
those of Tajikistan. It seems to me that Pakistan is just as 
well aware of this as we are. 
  [Pravov] However, from time to time we see hints in the 
press that certain circles in Pakistan are supporting the armed 
Tajik opposition in Afghanistan and are even encouraging its 
actions on the border. How do you view these reports? 
  [Rakhmonov] If such circles in Pakistan exist, they are 
irresponsible circles. Attacks by detachments of gunmen on our 
border posts represent a clear manifestation of terrorist 
activity. The problems that exist between various political 
forces in Tajikistan cannot be resolved by force of arms. We 
are relying on negotiations. This is one of the reasons why we 
came to Pakistan and I clearly note that we have found complete 
understanding here. Moreover, what is happening in Afghanistan 
cannot be approached with double standards. It is clear to 
everyone that the groupings of gunmen on this country's 
territory answer to nobody. They constitute a real danger not 
just for Tajikistan. This sort of behavior is dangerous for 
everyone in the region. 
  [Pravov] Mr. Chairman, since we have already spoken about 
the situation on the Tajik-Afghan border, I would like to dwell 
on this problem in more detail. Do you think it likely that the 
coming spring will bring new and more serious problems for the 
border posts guarding this border? 
  [Rakhmonov] Some time ago the armed opposition spoke about 
its intention to launch a spring offensive against our border. 
But it seems to me that their plans are unrealistic. The armed 
detachments of Tajik oppositionists do not have sufficient 
strength for this. And the groupings of Afghan mojahedin that 
support them will soon be embroiled in fighting one another -- 
seizing territory and carving it up into spheres of influence. 
Moreover, our border, thanks to the common efforts of certain 
CIS countries, has been reliably reinforced; it is also being 
defended by military units from other former USSR republics, now 
independent states, which rightly understand that the 
Tajik-Afghan border remains our common border and that we must 
defend it together. 
  [Pravov] From time to time we see articles in the press 
indicating the dangers of Moscow getting "embroiled" in 
Tajikistan. It is alleged that in many ways Russia's actions 
are a repetition of the former USSR's mistakes in Afghanistan. 
Indeed, some points of similarity can already be seen. What do 
you think about these parallels? 
  [Rakhmonov] I see fundamental differences in the two 
situations. First and foremost, unlike the USSR and Afghanistan 
in the early 1980's, until quite recently Russia and Tajikistan 
were part of the same country, and we have extremely close ties 
to the Russian people. It is not just a matter of extremely 
close economic and cultural ties. There are many mixed 
marriages. There are a number of Russians living in Tajikistan. 
Our states have now gone their separate ways. But many Tajiks, 
and Russians too, continue to believe we are still part of a 
whole -- whether it be with Russia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, or 
Uzbekistan. And all of us still have a common southern border 
-- that of the former USSR. Another radical difference from the 
Afghan situation is this: If you remember, once Soviet troops 
had been sent into Afghanistan, neither Kabul nor Moscow showed 
any intention of meeting with the leaders of the mojahedin 
groupings or holding talks with them. They relied on force. 
However, we favor resolving our problems with opposing forces 
of a different political orientation by peaceful means. And in 
this respect Russia fully supports us. 
  [Pravov] Do you think the issue of finding a settlement to 
the situation in Tajikistan is making any headway? 
  [Rakhmonov] Undoubtedly. First and foremost, the need for a 
peace settlement in the country is accepted by practically all 
our neighbors. And they are prepared to help the Tajiks talk to 
one another. We realized this once again during our present 
visit to Pakistan. It is clear that today everyone in the 
region is keen to see peace in Tajikistan, and there is no 
military way of resolving our problems.

  [Text] Before his departure for Madrid, Boris Nikolayevich 
Yeltsin gave a press interview at the [Vnukovo-2] airport. He 
described his visit to Spain as important and emphasized the 
serious preparation of the documents, including the treaty on 
friendship and cooperation. 
  [Begin Yeltsin recording] These documents which are to be 
signed give the green light to a rapid development of 
cooperation between our countries. So far it has been, one must 
say frankly, slow, though our two countries have great potential 
both for developing bilateral relations and for influencing the 
policy in Europe and in the world. [end recording] 
  Asked about Russia's stand regarding the NATO air strike 
against the Bosnian Serbs and about his conversation early this 
morning with U.S. President Clinton, Boris Yeltsin said: 
  [Begin Yeltsin recording] Everything must be in accordance 
with the decisions of the United Nations. He did not answer my 
question this morning about whether the UN secretary general had 
given the go-ahead for this. We advocate discussion of this 
issue in the Security Council -- without doubt. Speaking to 
Clinton, I insisted again and again that it is impossible to 
make decisions on such issues without prior consultations 
between the United States and Russia. It is impossible, and 
that will be our stand. [end recording] 
  [Moscow ITAR-TASS in English at 0604 GMT on 11 April adds, 
in 
a report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Anna Melnikova on the 
Yeltsin-Clinton phone conversation: "The Russian president 
pointed out that he had a telephone conversation with U.S. 
President Bill Clinton `at six in the morning today.' According 
to Boris Yeltsin, `Bill Clinton was unable to reply whether the 
U.N. Secretary-General gave a go-ahead to the strikes.' Boris 
Yeltsin is convinced that `all problems should be resolved 
strictly in accordance with U.N. decisions." Yeltsin said 
"Russia favours discussing this issue in the U.N. Security 
Council.'] 
  [Moscow INTERFAX in English at 1120 GMT on 11 April adds: 
"Before flying to Spain on an official visit Yeltsin told 
journalists that Clinton had not said whether the UN secretary 
general had given his go ahead to the NATO air strike against 
Bosnian Serb positions in the vicinity of Gorazde. `This is 
important to know because the air strike took place at night. 
Such actions should not be taken unless authorized by the UN,' 
Yeltsin said. `It is also important to know what targets were 
destroyed. If only two tanks, it's one thing; if the civilian 
population suffered, it's another. In any case this incident 
has to be debated by the UN Security Council. I insisted that 
such decisions should not be made without Russia. This is our 
firm position.']

  [Text] Moscow, 8 Apr -- "Relations between our two 
countries have good prospects. The Russian leadership, and not 
extremist circles, is a good and reliable friend of the 
leadership of the Serb Republic," Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev said today during the talks with Radoman Bozovic, 
chairman of the Chamber of Citizens of the Federal Assembly 
(parliament) of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. It is 
possible to reach such a settlement which could be implemented 
in practice, the Russian minister said. 
  "The settlement in Bosnia is not possible without the Serbs. 
The Russian side advocates lifting the sanctions, which have 
already become an anachronism, as soon as the agreement on the 
settlement in Bosnia has been signed," the Russian minister 
said. Andrey Kozyrev appreciated Belgrade's goodwill to 
continue a political dialogue in Bosnia.

  [Text] Yerevan April 9 TASS -- A statement of the Armenian 
Government was made here today in connection with last night's 
explosion of the Tbilisi-Yerevan passenger train which claimed 
the lives of three people and wounded 15. 
  The explosion occurred when the train was passing the 
Georgian Marneuli region mainly populated by the Azeris. The 
statement says trains and engineering railroad facilities have 
been blasted 20 times and the gas pipeline - 12 times in the 
area since last year. 
  Acts of sabotage staged against Armenia on territory of that 
region and terrorist acts against civilians, this time against 
train passengers, leave no doubts as regards the aims and forces 
organizing the actions, stresses the document. 
  Violating all international legal norms, the Azeri side 
chose 
the Georgian region populated by Azeris for fulfilment of its 
goals in order to involve Armenia and Georgia in the conflict, 
says the statement. In the opinion of the Armenian side, 
international terrorism, which has grown into barbarity, must be 
stopped. At the same time, the Armenian Government will take 
all measures to ensure safety of its citizens and protect 
national interests. In that case all the responsibility for 
further aggravation of the situation will rest on the Azeri 
side, says the statement. 
  The Armenian Government hopes the Georgian authorities will 
take measures to ensure safety of communications to Armenia via 
Georgian territory.

  [Text] Today, the Georgian Parliament continued discussions 
and confirmation of nominees to the Cabinet of Ministers. 
  During the sitting, some representatives of the minority 
again put forward an issue of the authority given to Aleksandr 
Kavsadze, the head of state's personal envoy and chairman of the 
Committee for Human Rights and Ethnic Relations, who had signed 
a package of documents on the Abkhazian problem on behalf of the 
Georgian side. Head of state Eduard Shevardnadze took a stand 
and made a speech, during which he emphasized that while 
exercising special authority as a leader of the country, he had 
the right to take independent decisions on the candidatures to a 
delegation participating in the Abkhazian-Georgian talks.

  [Text] The Ukrainian Naval Command today accused the Black 
Sea Fleet of illegally removing radio-navigational and 
hydrographical equipment from the port of Odessa. A statement 
by the Ukrainian Navy's press service says that the 
hydrographical vessel Cheleken left the port of Odessa overnight 
and is at present heading for Sevastopol. The press center says 
that Ukrainian border guards were prevented from boarding the 
ship by armed Russian sailors who had allegedly been ordered to 
open fire in the event of any action measures by the Ukrainian 
side. 
  Interfax asked the Black Sea Fleet headquarters to clarify 
the situation. The headquarters said that the incident is 
linked to the fact that Ukraine has stopped financing the 
navigational services in the Black Sea and, since by treaty they 
are meant to be funded by Kiev as well by Moscow, Russia cannot 
and does not intend to finance the services at its own expense.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report under "INFORM" rubric: "Chernobyl </F>
Running a Fever"] 
  [Text] In the opinion of IAEA [International Atomic Energy 
Agency] inspectors who have been working at Chernobyl AES 
[Nuclear Electric Power Station], the sarcophagus is in a 
critical state. The IAEA director general has proposed (and 
Leonid Kravchuk has agreed) calling an international conference 
on Chernobyl AES in the second half of April because the 
station's safety level does not meet international standards. 
Malfunctions have also been discovered in its operating units. 
  There are many reasons -- a shortage of skilled personnel 
and 
modern equipment, arduous working conditions. It is dangerous 
to operate the Chernobyl AES. But as we know, under a decision 
by the Ukrainian parliament, which was facing an energy crisis, 
the station resumed work last October.

  [Text] Kiev, 10 Apr -- "I think that today, despite the 
imperfection of the law on elections which is a relic of the 
former Soviet system, we will elect a new parliament which, 
guided by the law, will take government into its hands and will 
work for reforms, for democracy, for an independent state," 
Ukraine President Leonid Kravchuk told journalists at a polling 
station today immediately after voting. 
  Speaking of the presidential elections on 26 June, Leonid 
Kravchuk noted that he is personally not against them being 
held. However, laws on the status of the president, on his 
powers, on the structure of bodies of power must be adopted 
first. Leonid Kravchuk stressed that unless these legislative 
acts are adopted, he will not stand for the post of head of 
state. He noted, moreover, that if only representative 
functions are delegated to the president, then, in his opinion, 
such a head of state is not necessary.

with Viktor Chernomyrdin, will apparently introduce some 
adjustments into the cabinet's activity. This was announced 8 
April by presidential press secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov. In 
particular, according to him, adjustments are possible in the 
sphere of tax and customs policy. Mr. Kostikov stressed that 
the president and the prime minister have a good relationship

  [Text] Moscow April 8 -- Representatives from Russia's 
radical opposition are hardly likely to put their signatures to 
Yeltin's memorandum on Civic Accord. 
  The executive committee of the "TRUDOVAYA ROSSIYA" (LABOR 
RUSSIA) movement told ITAR-TASS that it recently adopted its own 
version of the agreement on accord in Russia. The movement is 
ready to sign the memorandum only if it accomodates their 
demands. Among those demands are: to immediately and 
unconditionally halt the "course on the restoration of 
capitalism in Russia, to restore the power of the Soviets 
everywhere, to immediately and unconditionally freeze and then 
lower prices on the main food products, to outlaw and prosecute 
speculating, and to restore the buying power of bank deposits as 
of the 1 January 1990 status." 
  Georgy Gusev, the executive secretary of the "Civil Accord" 
committee, which was formed about three years ago, thinks the 
idea of an agreement on civil accord in Russia is good, however 
all the sides will hardly be able to reach a consensus on 
concrete points of the agreement. Overall, he said, the work on 
the draft agreement reminds one of the work on the 1991 union 
treaty and, therefore, may share the treaty's sad fate. The 
signing of the union treaty was prevented by the 1991 August 
attempted coup, then the agreement simply fell behind events.

  [Text] Estonia deplores the linkage by Russia of its troop 
withdrawal by August 31 with a decision that would guarantee the 
rights of 11,500 military pensioners and ethnic Russians in that 
Baltic republic. This is said in a statement, released in 
Tallinn by the President Lennart Meri's Chancellory, and signed 
by him as well as by the Premier Mart Laar and the State 
Assembly's Chairman Yulo Nugis. 
  Moscow declared at the last round of bilateral talks that it 
would keep the date for the pullout of troops from Estonia blank 
until Tallinn ensured residence and other social guarantees for 
the retired Russian army officers and other ethnic Russians in 
Estonia. 
  Nonetheless, as the statement says, Estonia "is ready to 
continue negotiations in good faith to surmount all 
difficulties." 
  "At the same time, Estonia regards the Russian president's 
instruction of April 5 on the creation of military bases in CIS 
and Latvia as going back on earlier pledges, international 
accords and principles," says the statement. 
  Estonia's representatives abroad "have been instructed to 
remind Russia at every opportunity of its international pledge 
to move its troops out of Estonia and Latvia by August 31 
quickly and orderly, as has been repeatedly stressed in 
international accords," the document notes.

goes to Kuwait April 9 for a two-day visit. 
  At a press conference in Vilnius Thursday [7 April], 
Slezevicius said he intends to sign a bilateral agreement on 
investment protection and to hold talks on credits for Lithuania. 
  Slezevicius said a Kuwaiti foundation supporting economic 
development in some countries has already offered a preferential 
50-million-dollar loan to Lithuania. The premier said the money 
would be used for various energy projects, including 
construction of new gas pipelines and renewal of gas networks in 
several Lithuanian towns. Slezevicius said part of the loan may 
be used to finance the Lithuanian oil terminal project. 
  The Lithuanian premier said Kuwait is one of the biggest 
financial donors of the World Bank. Hence, he said, if the 
first credit is used properly, further financial support can be 
expected.

  [Text] Moscow April 12 TASS -- President Boris Yeltsin's 
current visit to Spain, NATO bombing raids on Serbian positions 
near the Bosnian city of Gorazde, and the Cosmonautics Day which 
is marked in Russia today are the leading topics in Moscow-based 
newspapers. 
  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI on President Boris Yeltsin's visit to 
Spain. The newspaper points out that the Spanish journalists, 
upon the arrival of President Boris Yeltsin in Spain on Monday, 
drew the attention of their Russian counterparts to the fact 
that a Russo- Spanish treaty of friendship and cooperation would 
be signed in Moncloa Palace where the Moncloa Pact had been 
signed. The pact "made it possible to take Spain out of the 
crisis and lay foundations of civil peace". 
  We hope, they said, that an agreement on achieving civil 
accord in Russia, which is to be signed in Moscow on Yeltsin's 
initiative, "also has a chance to go down in the history of the 
motherland". 
  RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA on the bombing of Serbian positions in the 
area of Gorazde by U.S. F-16 jetfighters: "As Russia begins to 
play an increasingly active diplomatic role in the Balkans, the 
Western countries' attitude to the Serbs grows tougher. "This 
time Russia has been confronted with an acomplished fact, for 
fear, probably, that a military conflict would be prevented 
diplomatically with her help. "Some people do not like, 
apparently, that Russia ceases to be an obedient executor of 
Western countries' decisions and tries to play solo in the 
diplomatic orchestra". 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA (Independent Newspaper) on Russia's not 
being consulted about air strikes in Gorazde area. "The failure 
to consult with Russia prior to the delivery of an air strike 
fits quite well into an increasingly distinct new U.S. attitude 
towards her. Nevertheless, no one, it seems, is in a hurry to 
write off her role in a settlement of the Balkan conflict". 
  TRUD and PRAVDA quote Yeltsin as saying at Vnukovo Airport 
prior to departure for Spain that "I insisted and continue to 
insist that such matters as the bombing of Serbian positions 
should not be decided upon without prior consultations between 
the United States and Russia".

  [Text] Chiefs of the Ukrainian, Russian, and Belarusian 
border protection agencies approved in Kiev today [word 
indistinct] of memorandum and a joint declaration by the leaders 
of those countries regarding cooperation in border protection, 
which is to be signed in Moscow on 15 April. The documents were 
drafted by the following experts: Lieutenant General Yevgeniy 
Bocharov, commander of the Belarusian Border Troops; Colonel 
General Andrey Nikolayev, commander of the Russian Border 
Troops; and Army General Valeriy Hubenko, commander of the 
Ukrainian Border Troops. 
  The experts were received today by Ukrainian President 
Kravchuk. He praised the work of the border troops commanders 
and emphasized that at this point, no country is in a position 
to resolve on its own problems connected with the protection of 
people and territory, not to mention the fight against illegal 
contraband. This can only be accomplished by combined efforts 
of the special services of all three states.

KOLOBOK"] 
  [Text] The pilot issue of the first official CIS weekly 
SNG: OBSHCHIY RYNOK [CIS: Common Market] was published today. 
The decision to publish it on the basis of OBSHCHAYA GAZETA was 
made by the Council of Heads of Government of the 12 states at 
the meeting held in Ashkhabad [Ashgabat] 23 December last year. 
  The economic weekly's start-up money comes from equal 
contributions paid in by the copublisher-states. The total sum 
for the current year is 950 million rubles and $200,000 (the 
foreign currency is for equipment). From next year the 
newspaper is to be a self-financing operation. 
  The editorial office of OBSHCHIY RYNOK, which finds itself 
in 
straitened circumstances (three desks and one phone for four 
people, which are shared with the magazine KOLOBOK), 
nevertheless decided not to postpone publishing a proper version 
but to make the pilot issue as close to the real thing as 
possible. It carries articles from all 12 states and devotes 
pages to policy statements. The new publication's journalists 
think that they will be able to start regular publication in the 
very near future.

Lyudmila Aleksandrova, Nikita Yermakov, Yuriy Sizov, and 
Vladimir Shekhovtsov] 
  [Text] Madrid, 11 April -- Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev said that he spoke from Madrid today to U.S. Secretary 
of State Warren Christopher on the situation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The head of the Russian Foreign Ministry said he expressed 
his profound concern that the world may be engulfed in a very 
perilous situation of an exchange of blows and urged him to 
display utmost restraint. We believe that all the sides must 
renounce any use of force. 
  This equally applies to the Muslim side, which, 
unfortunately, provoked the Serb side in some localities. But 
of course we regard the shelling of towns by artillery as 
impermissible. At the same time, air strikes can have different 
results from those intended; that is, an escalation of the 
conflict instead of its suppression. 
  We are worried by the fact that the decision was made in a 
hurry, without taking into consideration possible consequences, 
the minister continued. Unfortunately, the UN Security 
Council's permanent members were not consulted. The 
responsibility for the grave consequences that can be expected 
rests, therefore, with those who took this decision. 
  All this is especially annoying because by last Saturday we 
already had signs of a possible political settlement, stressed 
Kozyrev. Russian representative Vitaliy Churkin is now in Pale, 
where he arrived after talks in Belgrade. 
  The foreign minister called on all sides to refrain from all 
military actions, including air strikes. He recalled that 
Russia and Spain are members of the so-called `Yugoslav Five' 
within the UN Security Council. They have now agreed to act in 
close cooperation. Andrey Kozyrev ended by expressing hope that 
this critical situation will be overcome. 
  To make a decision on air strikes without Russia was "a big 
mistake and a great risk," the Russian minister added. In his 
words, he would not like to aggravate the situation, but he 
would like his words "to be understood correctly and taken very 
seriously." 
  Andrey Kozyrev recalled that Russia was the initiator of the 
practice of UN operations aimed at maintaining peace and of the 
principle to protect the peacekeeping forces by all possible 
means. We are not against using force to protect "the blue 
berets." It is a vitally important issue for Russia, the head 
of the Russian diplomacy stressed, and explained that many of 
our servicemen are participating in the peacekeeping forces in 
various conflict zones. We cannot allow them to be turned into 
hostages or targets for the conflicting sides. That is why we 
are firmly adhering to the position that the peacekeepers will 
be protected reliably. 
  It is a different matter as to what extent in this specific 
case there was now no other way out in Bosnia but to deliver an 
air strike and to what extent this was an optimal decision, the 
minister noted. That is why, in his opinion, consultations were 
needed, and even more so, they are being envisaged by the 
resolution of the UN Security Council. If we proceed from the 
fact that consultations should be held only when we wish to hear 
"yes," then what is left of the concept of consultations and 
cooperation?

<F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>
  [Excerpts] [Announcer] For the second time in the past two 
days NATO aircraft have bombed Bosnian Serb positions near the 
town of Gorazde. [passage omitted] Our correspondent Vladimir 
Solovyev spoke to Vitaliy Ivanovich Churkin: 
  [Begin recording] [Solovyev] Vitaliy Ivanovich, did Moscow 
know about the forthcoming airstrikes against Serb positions? 
  [Churkin] All last week we were following closely the 
situation around Gorazde, especially when it became aggravated. 
But in the crucial hours we did not know about any aggravation. 
The UN people explain this by the fact that everything happened 
very quickly. Two hours passed between General Rose's first 
warning that he was going to ask for air support and the actual 
air strikes. In this situation we have certain complaints about 
UN people, and Bosnian Serbs, for that matter, because when in 
the last few days we drew their attention to the impermissible, 
very dangerous and critical aggravation of the situation, their 
response was rather slack, they kept saying that nothing special 
was going to happen there and that they did not have any 
military plans for Gorazde. 
  I think that if Russia had been invited to tackle this 
crisis 
spot at the fateful moment, we could have directed the events in 
a different channel. [end recording] [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Russian Foreign Ministry is carefully examining 
the situation related to the second bombardment of Serb 
positions near the city of Goradze carried out by the NATO air 
forces this afternoon. "Russia is observing the UN Security 
Council's resolution on Bosnia and Herzegovina. However, if it 
is found out that the bombardment could be avoided the reaction 
of Moscow will be tough," a high-ranking Russian diplomat told 
INTERFAX today. 
  He said that although it could not be affirmed with 100 
percent certainty there was an impression that the NATO strikes 
had been dealt in order to frighten Bosnian Serbs. 
  "This aim has nothing to do with the peaceful settlement of 
the conflict. Moreover, the attacks against them make Bosnian 
Serbs unwilling to negotiate. However, there is no doubt that 
Moslems have provoked the recent military action in Goradze. 
Serbs did not respond appropriately. The response of the UN 
forces for the defense of former Yugoslavia applied to the NATO 
air forces might turn out also to be inappropriate," the 
diplomat suggested. 
  He emphasized that the NATO air attacks against the Serb 
positions must be discussed by the UN Security Council. "Moscow 
will not accept being informed on decisions to utilize force in 
ex-Yugoslavia as a fait accompli. Russia is not a banana 
republic but a permanent member of the UN Security Council. We 
are convinced that all decisions on the use of force in former 
Yugoslavia must be considered by the Security Council. There is 
no reasonable alternative. Any other way may lead to a 
catastrophe," the diplomat said. He added that after two more 
such blows the peaceful settlement in Bosnia and Herzegovina 
would be disrupted.

    [Editorial report] Moscow Russian Television Network in 
Russian 1609 GMT on 11 April carries a 10-minute "Details" 
program, presented by Vera Kuznetsova, examining the chain of 
events leading to the NATO air strikes against Bosnian Serb 
military positions, featuring interviews with Defense Minister 
Pavel Grachev and Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. 
"Details" program regular announcer Sergey Dorenko is shown 
among other journalists at a news conference given by Andrey 
Kozyrev in Spain today following NATO's second air strike. 
  Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov points out 
that 
"according to the UN Security Council's resolution, the UN 
secretary general should be making such a decision in 
consultations with members of the Security Council. No such 
consultations were held with Russia." Russian Defense Minister 
Pavel Grachev says: "Although it seems that all is correct from 
the legal point of view -- there was a UN sanction, there were 
UN consultations in accordance with the UN resolution -- 
everything is correct here. But from the moral, human point of 
view we believe that there was no need for these strikes. There 
are no peacekeeping forces there and no one to defend. There is 
one Ukrainian company, 93-strong, deployed 12 kilometers away in 
the southwest and only 12 UN representatives in Gorazde itself, 
who are no danger there. Moreover -- knocking out two tanks -- 
frankly, we can say that this was just a demonstration of power." 
  Answering Kuznetsova's question on whether Russia is being 
bypassed in the Yugoslav peace process, Lavrov says that this is 
an exaggeration. "When the Russian president has said for the 
first time that the Yugoslav problem cannot be solved without 
Russia's participation, you may recall that it was followed by 
Russia's success in easing the situation around Sarajevo. So, 
at that time no loss of Russia's prestige was suffered -- rather 
the opposite." He goes on to say: "When the Russian president 
stated this today, for the second time, I think it was for the 
same reason -- that our partners simply have not yet mastered 
the kind of partnership which we are trying to negotiate with 
them." 
  Pavel Grachev, in an "exclusive interview" to "Details" says 
that in his opinion the air strikes were not necessary from the 
political or from the military point of view. "U.S. Defense 
Secretary Perry has asked me to consult with him in the future 
for the sake of the Partnership for Peace program." 
  Dorenko then presents a fragment of Kozyrev's news 
conference 
in Madrid where he is shown among other journalists standing 
next to Kozyrev. Kozyrev says: "I had a conversation with U.S. 
Secretary General Christopher right here about one or two hours 
ago in which I expressed concern about the world being dragged 
into an extremely dangerous chain of exchanges of blows, and I 
asked the secretary of state to show maximum restraint. We 
believe that all sides should now immediately stop all military 
actions. This also means the Muslim side which, regrettably, is 
provoking the Serb side in a number of locations. Of course, we 
consider air strikes against the cities as being unacceptable, 
just as we do any threats against the UN forces. At the same 
time, it is most likely that the air strikes will bring results 
quite different from those that are probably expected from them. 
The responsibility for the possible grave consequences of these 
strikes -- which, most regrettably, we are still awaiting -- 
lies with those who made this decision."

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Boris Sitnikov] </F>
  [Text] United Nations April 12 TASS -- It has been learned 
here from sources within U.N. lobbies that Russia's permanent 
representative on the United Nations Yuliy Vorontsov expressed 
profound regret, during a consultative meeting of the Security 
Council, that Russia was informed "post factum" on the decision 
to use military aircraft in the area of the Bosnian town of 
Gorazde. The Russian delegate called for an urgent report of the 
U.N. secretary-general to the Security Council on the details of 
the event. 
  The Russian side insistently demands explanations from the 
U.N. Secretariat on the practical implementation of the 
procedure for using military aircraft, envisaged by the 
council's decisions, including the need to hold consultations 
with its members. It wants to know what concrete targets were 
subjected to air strikes and what were the results of these 
blows, etc. The Russian side also wants to know whether there 
were victims among the civilian population. 
  Vorontsov stressed the impermissibility of violating the 
resolutions adopted by the Security Council on "safety enclaves" 
in Bosnia and Herzegovina, noting that, at the same time, it was 
wrong to connive at Muslim provocations, which were repeatedly 
recorded by U.N. representatives. He referred to the Security 
Council's call to all the sides involved in the conflict to stop 
provocations, contained in the latest statement by the council 
chairman, released on April 6. Vorontsov called for urgent 
measures in the Gorazde area -- the deployment there of U.N. 
troops, withdrawal of Serb units from their present positions, 
demilitarisation of this "safety enclave", including the 
disarmament of Muslim units now active there. 
  Vorontsov stressed that the Russian side believed it was the 
duty of the Security Council to actively contribute to the 
achievement of these goals. He noted that Russia, as a direct 
and active participant of the Bosnian settlement, wanted to 
prevent the escalation of this conflict and expected more 
vigorous efforts by the world community to indicate the way to 
peace to all the sides involved in the conflict.

  [Text] Moscow, 12 Apr (TASS) -- Russia will never be 
reconciled to the role of "a younger partner", who is informed 
after the event about such vital decisions as the use of armed 
force. Grigoriy Karasin, the director of the Information and 
Press Department of the RF Ministry of Foreign Affairs, made 
this statement today at a briefing for Russian and foreign 
journalists. 
  "We are opposed to the practice of Russia being consulted 
only in order to get an affirmative `yes' from us," the diplomat 
said. "We have naturally reached the appropriate conclusions 
from what occurred on 10th and 11th April in the region of 
Gorazde."

  [Text] The leader of Russia's Unity and Concord faction in 
the Duma, Deputy Premier Sergey Shakhray has spoken out against 
bombing Serb positions at the Bosnian town of Gorazde. Talking 
to newsmen on Monday, he suggested that such actions are very 
dangerous and only lead to resentment and indignation. He is 
convinced that in making such a decision, the mechanisms 
envisaged by the UN Charter should be set into motion, which 
necessitates a Security Council resolution. 
  This is not the way to settle conflicts, the issue would be 
only aggravated by a decision to bomb, Shakhray said. In his 
assessment an air strike would slow down the process of 
negotiations with the Bosnian Serbs, and everything would have 
to be started all over again. 
  [Moscow Radiostantsiya Ekho Moskvy in Russian at 0800 GMT on 
12 April adds: "Those who decided to call in air strikes bear 
personal responsibility for the breakdown of the peaceful 
settlement through a process of negotiation, Sergey Shakhray, 
leader of the Party of Russian Unity and Accord, said to an Ekho 
Moskvy correspondent. He said that bypassing Russia to act is a 
slap in the face to the Russian president. Shakhray believes 
that the air strikes hit not only Serb positions but the 
internal political situation in Russia as well. He does not 
rule out that the latest events in Bosnia could also affect the 
process of reforms at home."]

The military losses and the number or existence of civilian 
casualties have not been reported. But the new facts, 
testifying to attempts to again fan up the conflict by means of 
armed force, have resounded with pain in the hearts of the 
Russian people. 
  The arising situation gives food for various aspects of 
alarm: NATO has easily ignored not only the view of Russia, but 
also the achieved agreements; this threatens to ruin the process 
of the peaceful political settlement of the bloody knot of 
problems in Europe, begun with such hard efforts by the world 
community. Moreover, preventive blows, when people are killed on 
the grounds that a dangerous situation could have otherwise 
arisen, can far from always be justified from the moral point of 
view. 
  The State Duma of the Russian Federal Assembly, vested with 
the people's trust and expressing the view of the majority of 
the Russian nation, does not intend to assume the stand of a 
passive onlooker in the situation, which has arisen on the 
territory of the former Yugoslavia. 
  We demand an immediate end to the unilateral, unsanctioned 
use of military force by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation 
and urge the parliaments of all the states of the world to 
actively contribute to the process of achieving a peaceful 
political settlement of the Yugoslavian crisis.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Andrey Krasnoshchekov] </F>
  [Text] Strasbourg, 12 Apr--The NATO decision on air strikes 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina, at the very moment when ways to resolve 
the Bosnian conflict have just emerged, is very unfortunate, 
badly timed, and therefore causes disappointment, Vladimir 
Lukin, chairman of the committee for international affairs of 
the State Duma, told ITAR-TASS. He is in Strasbourg with a 
Russian parliamentary delegation, which is taking part in the 
regular session of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of 
Europe here. 
  First, procedural and legal aspects of these actions are 
unclear, Lukin said. As we know, the UN Security Council has 
decided that such actions are possible, as long as they are 
sanctioned by the UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali 
following consultations with the Security Council and are to 
achieve tangible, definite goals. That is why I believe that one 
should convene the Security Council and find out whether these 
actions are in line with the adopted resolution. I seriously 
doubt it though. Besides, they were undertaken without 
preliminary consultations, including those with Russia. 
  Lukin also stressed the other serious aspect of this 
problem. 
Such actions had been attempted for the first time in Sarajevo, 
but they had then been blocked--mainly because of the active 
efforts of Russian diplomacy--he recalled. Following that, a 
special envoy of the Russian Federation president made some 
effective steps, and the crisis around Sarajevo was thus 
resolved. The same happened in the Serb Krajina. One would 
think that a way has been found to defuse such critical 
situations that imminently occur in a civil war. 
  "Therefore, when the situation in Gorazde aggravated 
again--and here I admit that the Serb side, some Serb 
commanders, may have been at fault--it was necessary to take 
additional steps in order to give an immediate boost to the 
peace process. That is exactly what Russia has done," Lukin 
said. 
  A special Russian Federation presidential envoy sent to 
Belgrade held very serious and intensive conversations there. 
Exactly at the same time, the blow--not agreed with anyone--was 
dealt. This looks very much like a provocation. Such an air 
strike will unavoidably complicate the situation and excite the 
right wing of all hues--both Serb, Muslim, and foreign, Lukin 
concluded.

  [Text] Zagreb, 12 Apr (ITAR-TASS) -- The second round of 
talks between representatives of the Croatian authorities and 
the Republic of Serb Krajina [RSK] in Croatia, which were to 
have been held at Russia's diplomatic mission here today, have 
been postponed. This has been disclosed by the Russian Embassy 
in Zagreb, which added that the specific reasons for the 
postponement would be given at a news conference to be held 
today by representatives of Russia, the United States, and the 
European Union -- the mediators in the conflict. 
  Local diplomatic circles link this postponement directly to 
the recent NATO air strikes against Bosnian Serb positions on 
the outskirts of the city of Gorazde, which has led to a serious 
deterioration in the situation throughout former Yugoslavia. 
  As we know, the first round of talks between the Croats and 
representatives of Serb Krajina, in which Vitaliy Churkin, the 
Russian president's special representative, played a direct 
part, successfully culminated in the signing of a truce. The 
truce came into force on 4 April and has been strictly observed 
up to now. It had been expected that a number of important 
questions consolidating peaceful coexistence between Krajina and 
Croatia -- above all the restoration of trade and economic ties, 
which have been more or less severed -- would be discussed 
during the second round of talks.

<F P=106> [Video report by correspondent Yuriy Zinchuk on </F>
demonstration at U.S. consulate in St. Petersburg] 
  [Text] At 1800 this evening, representatives of virtually 
all opposition parties with branches in St. Petersburg gathered 
outside the U.S. consulate. The aim of the picketing was to 
protest against U.S. actions against Serbia. 
  [Unidentified demonstrator] It is a slap in the face. It is 
like some kind of childish babble. Clinton did not give a 
warning; it was not agreed. This should be decided by the UN 
Security Council. What kind of action is that -- bombing? 
  [Zinchuk] The workers in the U.S. consulate were quite calm 
about the protest. Having read the posters of the pickets with 
curiosity from the window, they all returned to their work. The 
opposing side is more resolutely minded. As the organizers of 
this protest stated, they intend to put pickets under the Stars 
and Stripes of the U.S. consulate every day from 1800 to 2100 
until the Russian Foreign Ministry issues a protest note to the 
U.S. Government. [Video shows about 100 demonstrators, some 
holding banners reading "American! Leave alone Slavonic earth" 
[in English], "The USA -- Satan's nest. Yankee -- go home", 
"Hands off Serbia", "The Russian National-Republican Party is 
against NATO bombings in Bosnian Serbia", "Yankee! Dont't stick 
your nose into Slavonic countries", and "The United States is 
the world gendarme, Clinton is a murderer"]

<F P=106> [Yuriy Solton commentary on 10 April Bosnian air strike] </F>
  [Text] U.S. F-16 fighter planes under NATO's command 
attacked Serb positions in the suburbs of the Bosnian city of 
Gorazde on Sunday. Yuriy Solton comments on the situation 
there, and this is what he writes: 
  Heavy fighting has lasted for about two weeks around 
Gorazde, 
declared by the United Nations as one of the securiy areas in 
Bosnia. The lives of 60,000 civilians and United Nations 
personnel there are in danger. At the request of the United 
Nations Protection Force commander General Rose, who referred to 
previous United Nations Security Council resolutions, NATO 
aircraft have bombed Serb positions for the first time in two 
years. United Nations Secretary General Butrus-Ghali was 
notifed of the measure. 
  A bombing of the Bosnian Serb positions has seriously 
worsened the situation in Bosnia. President Boris Yeltsin has 
voiced serious concern. At six o'clock on Monday morning Moscow 
time he discussed the situation with President Bill Clinton. 
And this is what President Yeltsin said before leaving for 
Spain: 
  There are several fundamental principles one must always 
bear 
in mind. Firstly, all measures must be taken in strict 
compliance to the United Nations resolutions. We are for 
discussing that question in the United Nations Security Council. 
I told Mr. Clinton more than once that such measures can't be 
taken without prior consultation between United States and 
Russia. And we insist on this. 
  On the eve of the attack the warring Serb and Muslim 
factions 
in the area of Gorazde signed a 24-hour cease-fire agreement. 
The Serb community leader, Radavan Karadzic, has suggested 
making the agreement universal, spreading it to the whole 
Serb-Muslim frontline in Bosnia. The Muslims dismissed the 
proposal. And this was followed by NATO's air raid. 
  The developments in Bosnia are at a crossroads. At this very 
moment it's being decided whether the Bosnian Republic will 
choose the road of peace or the road of war. That hasty 
military action without prior discussions in the United Nations 
Security Council is pushing the country into a war. The leaders 
of the Serb community have described the air strike as 
aggression. All contacts with the United Nations Protection 
Force have been broken. The peace talks between the warring 
factions have been suspended. In the meantime NATO's 
headquarters has warned there may be more air strikes. 
  Armed intervention from outside will fail to bring either 
party to the negotiating table. And it's only negotiations that 
can produce a political solution. 
  The special Russian presidential envoy, Vitaliy Churkin, is 
holding negotiations in former Yugoslavia. His meetings with 
political leaders there are expected to clear up the situation 
and find a peaceful way out, as it was the case with the lifting 
of the siege of Sarajevo and opening Tuzla airport to United 
Nations forces.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Igor Rostovtsev; From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] This air strike has become the 
first occurrence of using NATO combat airplanes against 
ground-based targets in Bosnia. Though in purely military terms 
this operation can be described as small-scale, its political 
reverberations have been far stronger. It was stated that the 
United Nation's priority was to ensure the safety of the 
international forces stationed in the crisis area; however, 
there were civilian casualties. The Serbs will not be 
intimidated, they reserve the right to defend themselves using 
all the weapons at their disposal, says the statement of the 
high command of the Serb republic. 
  Can this attack mean the start of a wide international 
confrontation with the Bosnian Serbs? No doubt the decision to 
strike or not to strike, as, incidentally, it is the case in 
adopting any other tough measures, is within the competence of 
the United Nations. 
  That is why one is bewildered by the fact that such actions 
are being implemented without a proper agreement with all its 
members. How else can one interpret the fact that no 
consultations had been held before the bombardment between 
Russia and the United States -- the two countries that should of 
course act in consensus in order to restore peace in former 
Yugoslavia.

<F P=106> [Leonid Mlechin report: "Bloodshed in Bosnia Will Continue </F>
Because It Is Not a Religious or an Ethnic War but a Battle for 
Land"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The Serb offensive on 
Gorazde, the NATO aerial bombardment, and the Bosnian Serbs' 
refusal to deal with the United Nations have dealt Belgrade's 
diplomacy a grave blow. A delegation from the lower chamber of 
the Yugoslav parliament has just been to Moscow and left taking 
with them the most optimistic impressions. 
  "The main Duma factions promised us support on what is the 
main issue for us -- the lifting of sanctions," Radoman Bozovic, 
chairman of the Yugoslav parliament's lower chamber, told 
IZVESTIYA. "Russian deputies realize that sanctions were 
introduced simply to punish the Serbs." 
  The Belgrade politician also thinks that Russian diplomats 
have changed their approach to Yugoslavia's problems: 
  "Minister Andrey Kozyrev and his deputy Vitaliy Churkin told 
us that they consider the lifting of sanctions an inalienable 
part of the peacemaking process. Following the December 
elections, Russian diplomacy has taken a more realistic stance 
on Yugoslavia." 
  Radoman Bozovic gave IZVESTIYA an interview in the 
half-empty 
Yugoslav Embassy building in Moscow, where there are just a few 
diplomats left owing to the sanctions and where Kozyrev, the 
Vatican, and the Americans are cursed and tales told about the 
genocide of Serbs. Politicians and professional propaganda 
personnel speak significantly and only too often about Slav 
unity, which people in Belgrade only recalled after sanctions 
were introduced against Serbia. The main task facing Belgrade's 
diplomacy is to pit Russia against the West. 
  The representatives of Yugoslavia against which the UN 
sanctions have been imposed are not very well received 
worldwide. The 41-year old Radoman Bozovic, who used to teach 
the theory of economic development, was elected chairman of the 
parliament's lower chamber a year ago and this is his first 
official visit abroad. 
  "We told Kozyrev and Churkin that the Bosnian Serbs and Serb 
Krajina (an enclave on Croatia's territory) must have the same 
right to self-determination as the other peoples of the former 
Yugoslavia," Radoman Bozovic said. "If the Bosnian Muslims or 
the Croats can have their own state, then why should the Bosnian 
Serbs be denied that?"

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Lyudmila Aleksandrova, Nikita </F>
Yermakov, Yuriy Sizov, and Vladimir Shekhovtsov] 
  [Text] Madrid, 11 April -- Today Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin expressed satisfaction that "Spain will figure strongly 
in Russian foreign policy." He spoke at an official dinner 
given in his honor by the Spanish King Juan Carlos I, in the 
Palacio de Oriente. 
  According to the Russian leader, the present visit "will 
become a turning point in the history of relations between the 
two countries." Prospects for the stable development of 
Russian-Spanish cooperation, which is a long-term one and is not 
affected by political considerations, are becoming clearer. 
  Boris Yeltsin noted that a treaty on friendship and 
cooperation between Russia and Spain, which will be signed in 
Madrid on 12 April, will become the legal basis for this new 
stage in bilateral cooperation. This fundamental document "will 
open wide horizons for interaction between our countries in 
various spheres." 
  For a long time the peoples of Russia and Spain were forced 
to live under systems of dictatorial state power that were 
hostile to each other. Numerous obstacles and bans were put on 
the path toward mutual rapprochement. "The Treaty on Friendship 
and Cooperation is the result of the triumph of democracy both 
in Russia and Spain," the president said. 
  In his opinion, the unique experience that allowed Spain to 
be transformed into a stable, law-based, democratic state with a 
developed economy is very valuable for Russia. Now Spain is 
integrated into the European system. It plays a noticeable role 
in the European processes and occupies a worthy place in the 
world community. 
  He welcomed the involvement and active role of Madrid in 
international affairs and expressed readiness to join efforts in 
order to "jointly take part in tackling difficult international 
problems." 
  Boris Yeltsin stressed that the new Russia is becoming a 
full-fledged member of the community of democratic states. "We 
want," he continued, "this process to meet our national 
interests and the goals of building a new order based on mature 
strategic partnership to a greater degree." 
  Having noted the difficulty of Russia's integration into 
world economic relations, the president stressed that this 
process will require "mutual adaptation -- a political, 
economic, and psychological one. We count on the fact that 
leaders in the West have the political courage to do what is 
necessary to resolve this." 
  A mutually beneficial dialogue between the leadership of 
Russia and Spain on most topical issues of modern times has 
become traditional, the head of the Russian state said. He 
expressed confidence that the establishment of a direct line of 
communications between the Kremlin and the Moncloa Palace -- an 
agreement on which was signed today by the foreign ministers of 
the two countries -- will allow it to be given a greater sense 
of urgency and regularity. "We will be able to cooperate more 
closely and constructively in the sphere of international 
relations, both in building a peaceful, unified, democratic 
Europe and in establishing a new world order." 
  Boris Yeltsin reported that a grand monument to Columbus, 
"which will be soon erected in Seville according to a design by 
our sculptor Tsereteliy," will be a sign that Russia recognizes 
Spain's eternal contribution toward the formation of a modern 
civilization.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Vernikov and Vasiliy Kononenko report: "Boris </F>
Yeltsin Will Be Doing His Job in Spain, Not Visiting the Doctor"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- The Russian president's first official 
visit to Spain will be brief, businesslike, and with a 
relatively small delegation -- the foreign minister and the 
minister of foreign economic relations. 
  Yeltsin's main tasks are to reinforce the political mutual 
understanding between our countries and to get economic 
cooperation moving. He will meet with King Juan Carlos and 
Premier Felipe Gonzalez and will sign the Treaty of Friendship 
and Cooperation that was initialed in Moscow back in April 1992. 
  But this relates to the political side of the visit; as for 
economic relations, these will boil down to the expression of 
good intentions. According to every indicator, the level of 
mutual trade -- which was not distinguished by any great 
achievements in any case -- simply collapsed last year. Russian 
exports were almost entirely made up of raw materials, and sales 
of machinery and equipment fell. At the same time, Russian 
imports from Spain -- with foodstuffs predominant -- almost 
doubled. Over the past year trade turnover between our 
countries has fallen 46 percent. 
  According to the Russian delegation members, Boris Yeltsin 
will not be raising the question of "unfreezing" the unused part 
of the $1.5-billion Spanish loan granted to the USSR in 1990. 
By early 1993 Moscow had not repaid its debt on the half of 
this sum that has already been "consumed." Moreover, the 
Spanish Government has no spare cash. So in practice Oleg 
Davydov, minister of foreign economic relations, has very little 
room for maneuver on achieving a breakthrough in the development 
of trade relations with Spain. 
  On other point: The Russian president, contrary to the 
considerable speculation about his health, will not be 
undergoing medical treatment at the Barcelona hospital where he 
underwent an operation in 1990. He will not even be visiting 
it. But Yeltsin will meet at his residence with the doctors who 
treated him.

  [Text] The news conference of the Russian and Spanish

Gonzalez spoke about the development of relations between our 
two countries and about the documents they had signed. They 
also answered questions from journalists. Among other things, 
Boris Yeltsin was asked about his health. Here is what the 
Russian president replied. 
  [Begin Yeltsin recording] I would like to wish every person 
to be as healthy as I am at my age. Can someone who constantly 
plays tennis very hard for an hour and a half at a time -- and 
mind you, playing against masters of sports and honored masters 
of sports; someone who swims in the Black Sea in March, with the 
water temperature at four degrees; can someone who does all this 
be in poor health? Someone who works 16 to 18 hours a day, 
virtually without any days off. You have got to envy me! 
Here's what I told the doctors: This year, let us arrange a 
24-hour health check, to be attended by all journalists who so 
desire. Any lab, you know, blood test, come on then, whatever, 
so much urine [Yeltsin laughs]; and so on, for 24 hours, so that 
not just Russia but the whole world may know what I've got 
inside me. [end recording]

  [Text] Madrid April 11 TASS -- Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev and his Spanish counterpart Javier Solana held 
talks in Madrid today. 
  At the end of the talks, the heads of foreign ministries of 
the two countries signed a package of Russian-Spanish documents, 
which included a treaty on social welfare, an agreement on 
cooperation in the sphere of culture and education, an agreement 
on cooperation in the social and labour sphere, an agreement on 
environmental protection. Under one of the agreements, Russia 
and Spain will establish a hot line between the Kremlin and the 
Moncloa Palace, the residence of the Spanish prime minister. 
  Javier Solana expressed his satisfaction with the meeting 
with Andrey Kozyrev. We signed five agreements, the minister 
said. Russian-Spanish meetings will be viewed as a positive 
factor in bringing bilateral relations to new heights when a 
basic Russian-Spanish treaty and the sixth agreement are signed 
on Tuesday. 
  The two sides exchanged views on the situation in former 
Yugoslavia, relations between Russia and NATO, the situation in 
the Middle East and the role of the United Nations. The Spanish 
foreign minister noted the importance of the talks which 
revealed the common position on many problems. The Russian 
foreign minister agreed with this assessment made by his Spanish 
counterpart.

Nikita Yermakov, Yuriy Sizov, and Vladimir Shekhovtsov] 
  [Text] Madrid, 12 Apr (ITAR-TASS) -- An agreement on 
economic and industrial cooperation was signed by Oleg Davydov, 
Russia's minister for foreign economic relations, and Javier 
Gomez-Navarro, minister of commerce and tourism of spain, today. 
  This document envisions specifically that the sides will 
facilitate contacts between enterprises, organizations, and 
individuals from the two countries. It has been decided to 
devote particular attention to dealing with the problems of 
small and medium-sized enterprises and to encourage events such 
as fairs, specialized exhibitions, and symposiums. 
  An intergovernmental mixed commission on economic and 
industrial cooperation is being set up under the agreement. It 
will assemble no less than once a year, in Russia and Spain by 
turn. 
  Commercial and economic relations between the two countries 
have been curtailed recently, to a considerable extent because 
of Russia's debt to Spain. However, Russia has a positive trade 
balance with Spain. The raw materials drive in Russia's exports 
is being maintained, most of which is oil. Russian imports from 
Spain still consist of vehicles, equipment, and foodstuffs. 
  The Spanish side notes the interest of the country's 
business 
community in operating in the Russian market, but also notes 
their caution on this. This is connected to the instability of 
Russian legislation and the lack of proper guarantees for 
foreign investors. 
  According to EL PAIS newspaper, Spanish businessmen are 
hoping first and foremost for the provision of reliable 
conditions for capital investment in Russia and a stable customs 
policy. 
  Of 74 registered Russian-Spanish mixed enterprises, less 
than 
ten are actually operating. However, the experience of those 
who are already functioning in Russia demonstrates that there is 
great potential for cooperation in the economic sphere.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Russia Intends To Join European </F>
Union"] 
  [Text] At talks in Moscow with a delegation of U.S. 
parliamentarians headed by Richard Gephardt, leader of the 
Republican minority in the U.S. Congress, Russian Federation 
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin reaffirmed the Russian 
Federation's intention to seek the G-7's transformation at its 
next summit in Naples into a G-8 with Russian participation. 
Reporting on the conversation held behind closed doors Valeriy 
Grishin, first deputy leader of the Russian Federation 
Government's Press Service, said that the statement by the head 
of the cabinet was met with understanding and support by the 
U.S. parliamentarians. 
  V. Chernomyrdin also stressed that the Russian Government 
has 
not counted on foreign credits, and is not doing so. In this 
context he noted that the question of the allocation to Russia 
by the IMF of the second part of the system credits, worth $1.5 
billion, "largely bears a political character." The head of the 
cabinet remarked that there are forces in the United States 
which are attempting to restrict the Russian Federation's access 
to, and undermine its role in, world markets. The premier said 
that Russia is not interested in privileges, but in equal 
partnership opportunities in trade. 
  In V. Grishin's words, the U.S. congressmen expressed 
support 
for the course of reforms being carried out by V. Chernomyrdin's 
government. 
  The statement by Russian Federation Government Chairman 
Viktor Chernomyrdin that Russia is ready to submit its 
application for membership of the European Union [EU] provoked 
animated discussions at EU headquarters in Brussels. This 
statement from the Russian premier at a press conference on the 
results of his visit to Budapest was interpreted here as 
sensational. 
  A press relations aide to European Commission Member Hans 
van 
den Broek noted in an interview with an ITAR-TASS correspondent 
that right now the union has no answers to a whole range of 
questions linked to EU expansion. This is attested by the 
difficulties over the accession of Austria, Finland, Sweden, and 
Norway. He recalled that Cyprus, Turkey, and Malta have long 
been waiting in line for EU membership. Talks on the further 
expansion of the EU will hardly begin before 1996, when a 
conference on bringing the union's institutions into line with 
realities arising subsequent to the Maastricht agreements is 
scheduled. 
  As for Russia, the EU representative stressed, it has 
completely different dimensions to any other European country. 
An agreement on EU cooperation with Russia should undoubtedly 
be concluded. But the accession to the union of such a big 
country with a mighty and extremely specific economy is hard to 
envisage even in the long term. Even if the EU does somehow 
manage to "swallow" Hungary and Poland, in the case of Russia 
the question arises: "Who is to join whom?"

  [Text] Moscow April 8 TASS -- "When speaking of 
military-political cooperation and the Russian joining of NATO's 
Partnership for Peace program, we cannot abstract ourselves from 
economic factors and the Russian striving to join the `Great 
Seven'," Presidential Press Secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov told a 
briefing here today. 
  "You know that Russia wants to join G7. Why shouldn't these 
two problems be linked? If we are invited to cooperate in 
political and military spheres, why shouldn't this be expanded 
to economic cooperation?," he said. Kostikov said it is a 
prerogative of the Foreign Ministry to decide who will sign the 
document on Russian joining of the Partnership for Peace program 
-- whether it will be Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev or it will 
be signed at a "lower level". 
  "Bearing in mind unclear content and consequences of the 
`Partnership' program, the State Duma has suggested to sign the 
framework agreement at a lower level to have more space for 
manoeuvre," said Kostikov. He said his task is to spare the 
president and the State Duma of confrontation related to the 
discussion or ratification of the Partnership for Peace program. 
In this connection, Kostikov said that press reports on the 
program concept are useful as they help to make the topic more 
open.

  [Text] Strasbourg April 11 TASS -- NATO air strikes on 
Bosnian Serb positions in Bosnia-Herzegovina cannot be justified 
at this point, Russian Federation Council Chairman Vladimir 
Shumeyko said. Shumeyko is in Strasbourg as head of the Russian 
delegation attending a session of the Council of Europe 
Assembly. Shumeyko stressed that the U.N. decision allowing 
NATO to decide on the use of force in the war zone remains in 
effect. But the decision was adopted several months ago and the 
situation has changed considerably since then, he said. 
  The latest actions cannot be justified by the need to 
protect 
civilians in Bosnia-Herzegovina, he continued. Additionally, 
Russia's involvement in Bosnian settlement has brought certain 
results and opened up ways for continuing the search for a 
compromise satisfying all sides. He believes the United States 
should not have openly shown support for one side, while 
"punishing" another. 
  He stressed that from the military point of view the 
effectiveness of air strikes is also in question. "As a result 
of air strikes only one tank was destroyed, but civilians died. 
No tank can be worth a human life," he said. 
  Shumeyko noted that the NATO actions cannot facilitate the 
peace process. Time will show if they have not caused further 
escalation of the conflict in the region, he concluded.

  [Text] Strasbourg April 12 TASS -- "The Zhirinovskiy party 
is a party of one individual, and no one empowered him to speak 
for millions of Russian people," Federation Council Chairman 
Vladimir Shumeyko, who is leading the Russian delegation to the 
parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe, said commenting 
on the address of the leader of the Liberal-Democratic Party of 
Russia, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy to the parliamentary assembly 
session. 
  Shumeyko told journalists that Zhirinovskiy "is adroitly 
using the national idea" to reach his own political ends. He 
said that after the disintegration of the Soviet Union many 
Russian people found themselves beyond Russia's boundaries and 
are extremely sensitive to the situation. 
  In his address, Zhirinovskiy declared that "Russia has its 
own idea of democracy and the majority of Russians are against 
the country's participation in the Council of Europe and NATO". 
He stressed that Russia needs no "teachers of democracy" and 
added that "we have our own standards and we will not permit the 
West to experiment with Russia". 
  Zhirinovskiy shocked the audience by saying, "NATO flyers 
are 
now bombing Bosnia, but it is not ruled out that a time may come 
when other pilots will bomb other targets". 
  Before the beginning of the plenary session, Zhirinovskiy 
was 
so active in attracting the attention of reporters and cameramen 
to his own person that the chairman had to ask him to leave the 
room. He added that "the Council of Europe is not Hollywood, 
thank God". 
  Zhirinovskiy's speech was repeatedly interrupted by 
outbursts 
of indignation, and when he finished the chairman of the State 
Duma's international affairs committee Vladimir Lukin said the 
other members of the Russian delegation do not share 
Zhirinovskiy's views.

  [Text] Strasbourg April 11 TASS -- Russian nationalist 
leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy said on Monday that NATO military 
bases in Italy should be bombed in response to air strikes 
against Bosnian Serbs in Gorazde. 
  Zhirinovsky arrived in France with a Russian parliamentary 
delegation to attend the spring session of the parliamentary 
assembly of the Council of Europe. 
  The leader of the largest one-party faction in the Russian 
lower house said NATO's air-strike had been aimed "against 
Russia, against Slavs." "If I were the president, we would bomb 
those bases in Italy... They bomb one town, we bomb another 
town," he told reporters. 
  Zhirinovskiy said that he favoured the peaceful settlement 
of 
the Yugoslav crisis, adding that it was NATO who initiated the 
aggression. NATO's action "is against Russia. For the most 
part, it serves the interests of Germany in the Balkans. It is 
against Christians, against the Slav people," the leader of the 
Russian Liberal Democratic Party stressed.

  [Text] Strasbourg Apr 11 (CNA) -- Nationalist Russian 
leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy expressed unreserved support for 
the independence of Cyprus and the withdrawal of Turkish troops 
form the island. 
  In a statement to CNA, Zhirinovskiy, who arrived here Sunday 
amid controversy over his anti-French statements, said the 
20-year Turkish occupation "is a violation of international law". 
  "The Turkish-occupied part of Cyprus has never been Turkish 
and Turkey, although a member of the council of Europe, is an 
aggressive country", he told CNA. 
  The Russian politician, who stressed to CNA that he speaks 
for the majority of the people of Russia, said "your island must 
be independent, either an independent state of Cyprus or part of 
Greece but not a part of Turkey". 
  Turkey invaded Cyprus in 1974 and despite numerous U.N. 
resolutions calling for respect for the island's independence, 
and for the withdrawal of all foreign forces, it continues to 
have 35,000 troops occupying the island's northern third. 
  Referring to Sunday's bombing by NATO forces of Serbian 
positions, Zhirinovskiy said he opposed war and violence and 
called on the Council of Europe to take a stand on the matter 
and indicate its support for aggression or non-aggression. "I 
will not only protest but I will warn the Council that one day 
we are going to take responsive measures against those countries 
which bombed on Sunday", he told CNA. 
  Replying to another question, the Russian politician said he 
opposed the dispatch of Turkish troops to former Yugoslavia as 
peacekeepers because, as he explained, "the population there 
opposes the presence of Turkish troops". Zhirinovskiy dismissed 
suggestions that the dispatch of Turkish troops was decided to 
balance the presence of Russian peace-keepers. 
  Zhirinovskiy, leader of Russia's liberal democratic party, 
made the statements to CNA on arrival at the Palais de l'Europe, 
where later this afternoon the parliamentary assembly starts.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Andrey Shtorkh] </F>
  [Text] Paris, 9 Apr -- The French Foreign Ministry has 
today granted a "limited entry visa" to Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, 
leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR], who 
intends to take part in the session of the Parliamentary 
Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE), which opens next week 
in Strasbourg, Catherine Colonna, deputy to the official 
spokesperson of the French Foreign Ministry, told ITAR-TASS. 
  The limitations pertain to both the validity of the visa in 
terms of duration -- it has been granted for the five days of 
the session -- and in terms of place of stay -- Zhirinovskiy has 
no right to leave Strasbourg. Thus, this is only a permission 
to be on French territory, rather than to visit France, 
Catherine Colonna pointed out. 
  According to a spokesperson from the diplomatic department, 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy will arrive in Strasbourg as part of a 
Russian parliamentary delegation at the invitation of the 
Council of Europe. In accordance with the agreement between 
France and the EEC, Paris does not have the right to refuse 
anyone invited to the Council of Europe an entrance visa, C. 
Colonna explained. 
  The deputy of the official spokesperson of the French 
Foreign 
Ministry said that Vladimir Zhirinovskiy had been notified of 
all restrictions connected to his stay in Strasbourg. The LDPR 
leader was informed that all general requirements made of 
foreign citizens visiting French territory apply to him. 
Furthermore, V. Zhirinovskiy was reminded that all his 
activities during his stay in France had to be in character with 
the mission with which he was arriving in Strasbourg, that is, 
they have to relate exclusively to the PACE session. 
  "We do not intend to give Mr. Zhirinovskiy an entrance visa 
for visiting France as the republic's Foreign Minister Alain 
Juppe has already frequently pointed out," C. Colonna stressed.

test-range," said Major-General Anatoliy Sidyakin, commander of 
the 27th Division of the Russian Army, at a news conference in 
Totsk. Sidyakin said it was symbolic that the Totsk military 
test-range, which saw the first cloud of a "mushroom" of a 
nuclear explosion going up on September 14, 1954 as a sign of 
the times of the Cold War, has been turning into an arena of 
close peaceful cooperation between Russian and American troops. 
  Nevertheless, the general expressed concern over the fact 
that joint military Russo-U.S. exercises scheduled in July have 
encountered strong resistance from the mass media in the 
Orenburg and the Volga region. The general pointed out that one 
might get the impression that the very possibility of the 
presence of American servicemen there arouses the indignation of 
some representatives of parties and movements. 
  "The scope of the upcoming exercises stand no comparison 
with 
exercises regularly held on our test-range," the general said. 
"Shots are permanently fired and explosions are made in the 
neighborhood of Totsk, showing that full-scale military 
exercises are underway there. The upcoming exercises are not so 
big in comparison because the main goal of these exercises is to 
teach organisation and planning the activities of peace-keeping 
forces," the general said. 
  He pointed out that the main purpose of the exercises is to 
work out with the U.S. side a common approach to conducting 
peace-keeping operations. "These operations are of a non-combat 
character, but rather exercises in the disengagement of warring 
sides and the establishment of a regime of safety in the 
disengagement corridor," the general said, adding that the 
exercises would be held with the single aim of ensuring 
political, non-military settlement of a conflict. 
  The general pointed out that no shots are planned and 
expected on the test-range, since "this is not necessary and was 
not specified by a U.N. Security Council mandate." The general 
pointed out that taking part in the exercises will be 50 
armoured carriers, adding and that no "phantom tanks" can 
possibly damage the Orenburg soil. 
  Asked about the U.N. role in organising the exercises, the 
general pointed out that "the exercises will be held under the 
U.N. auspices which might send its representatives to the 
exercises. In future, the exercises might be held with the 
participation of "blue helmets" and other states. "Thus, the 
exercises would be multilateral," the general said. 
  In conclusion, the general pointed out that the process of 
the U.S. and Russia getting closer together and cooperation 
between them have become irreversible.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Shalnev report: "`Situation Room' Will Also Be </F>
Set Up in Moscow"] 
  [Text] Another sphere of cooperation has emerged in 
Russian-U.S. relations -- between the National Security Council 
in Washington's White House and the Russian Federation National 
Security Council. 
  The "Memorandum on Cooperation in the Sphere of National 
Security," the draft of which Security Council Secretary Oleg 
Lobov has submitted to the [U.S.] White House, and of which we 
have a copy, notes that the following will be considered 
top-priority areas: "National security in the economy, ecology, 
and in the sphere of preserving the health and gene pool of the 
nation, and the fight against crime, international terrorism, 
and the drugs mafia." 
  If Washington finds the draft acceptable, the memorandum 
will 
be signed within the next few months during a return visit to 
Moscow by Anthony Lake, assistant to U.S. President for national 
security affairs. 
  The memorandum, which typically contains at least two 
references to the fact that the implementation of the 
cooperation programs will depend on the availability of 
sufficient funding in rubles and hard currency, regrettably does 
not give a clear idea of how specifically these programs will 
supplement those already being implemented by the Foreign 
Ministry and the Department of State, the defense ministries, 
and other U.S. and Russian departments. 
  Oleg Lobov's delegation was impressed by the so-called White 
House Situation Room, where the U.S. top leadership convenes in 
crisis situations and where, in ordinary situations, information 
about events in the United States itself and abroad is amassed 
and systematized. It emerged from a conversation with the 
Russian National Security Council secretary that there are 
already plans to set up a similar situation room in Moscow in 
one of the former Central Committee buildings on Staraya 
Ploshchad. 
  "How much will the project cost?" 
  "There are no figures as yet regarding cost," Oleg Lobov 
replied, "but the expenditure will undoubtedly pay off." 
  The expenditure will presumably be considerable, given that 
the room will be equipped with the same computers and other 
modern equipment as that in Washington -- if not better.

  [Text] Moscow April 8 TASS -- The command of the Black Sea 
Navy has asked the Ukrainian Defence Ministry to pay before 
April 10 all the debts of the Ukrainian military units which 
consume electric power through the Black Sea Navy, as well as 
the debts of Ukrainian Defence Ministry customers to the 
building department of the Black Sea Navy. 
  The telegram, addressed to Ukrainian Defence Minister 
General 
Vitaliy Radetskiy, says that on March 28 the debts of Ukrainian 
units to the Black Sea Navy amounted to 4 billion karbovanets 
for the consumed electricity, and 16,709 billion karbovanets for 
the completed construction jobs. 
  The cable says that if the debt was not paid before April 
10, 
"the Black Sea Navy Command will be compelled to consider the 
question of stopping all building and assembly works, carried 
out by the Black Sea Navy construction department for the 
Ukrainian Defence Ministry, and of switching over all the 
Ukrainian units, consuming electric power through the Black Sea 
Navy, to their own power sources". 
  "The Black Sea Navy Command holds," the cable says, "that 
the 
Ukrainian Defence Ministry has breached the summit agreements on 
the joint financing of the Black Sea Navy and is trying to solve 
its own problems at the expense of the Russian Navy".

  [Text] Speaker of the State Duma (the lower house of 
parliament) Ivan Rybkin in a letter to the Ukrainian leadership 
has protested at Kiev's seizure of the Black Sea Fleet's group 
of warships deployed at Odessa and the detention of the group 
commander, officers and men. 
  The letter requests the immediate release of the detainees 
in 
the name of long-running friendly relations between Russia and 
Ukraine. 
  Head of the parliamentary committee for CIS affairs 
Konstantin Zatulin told reporters in Moscow that soon after 
receiving an INTERFAX report about the incident on Monday, the 
Duma Council had held consultations with Chief Commander of the 
Russian Navy Feliks Gromov and Russian chief negotiator in talks 
with Kiev Yuriy Dubinin. He said the two officials would fly to 
Kiev late on Monday and that the "incident will be resolved and 
servicemen released". 
  Zatulin expressed the hope that the incident was caused by 
misunderstanding rather than being a deliberate act intended to 
strain bilateral relations. If the detainees are not set free, 
he said, the Duma will have to resume discussion of the issue on 
Wednesday and adopt a special resolution. Zatulin did not rule 
out a souring of relations between the two countries and their 
parliaments. 
  At the same time, the Russian official said the incident 
might have been planned as a way of causing friction between 
Moscow and Kiev. Zatulin believes that tension is being fuelled 
in Ukraine in a bid to cancel presidential elections in June and 
impose presidential rule in the country.

<F P=106> ["The Command of the Black Sea Fleet has issued a protest to </F>
Ukraine's Military Department (Ministry of Defense) in 
connection with the Seizure of a Fleet Division in Odessa" -- 
POSTFACTUM headline] 
  [Text] The press centre of the Black Sea Fleet has today 
circulated a statement concerning the events in Odessa. The 
statement says: 
  "Ukrainian servicemen have committed yet another illegal act 
in relation to the Black Sea Fleet. From 2100 to 2300 on 10th 
April, the anniversary of the city's liberation from the German 
fascist aggressors, around 120 members of Ukraine's armed 
forces, acting in the best traditions of the SS divisions, 
attacked a division of mothball ships of the Black Sea Fleet in 
Odessa. 
  "The Ukrainian raiders handcuffed the division's commander, 
Captain 1st Rank Oleg Feoktistov, the division's chief of staff, 
Captain 2nd Rank Aleksandr Zelenko, and the commander of the 
base support unit, Captain 2nd Rank Dmitriiy Starikov. The 
other officers and warrant officers, with their families, are on 
the unit's territory, under the guard of Ukrainian 
special-purpose troops. Windows were broken in offices, and 
people were wounded, some of them children. The unit's civilian 
staff were beaten up and removed to the village of Chabanka, 
near Odessa. 
  It is also important to observe that the Commander of the 
Ukrainian Navy, Vice Admiral Vladimir Beskorovaynyy was then in 
the port of Odessa, on board the "Slavutich" ship belonging to 
the Ukrainian Navy administration. 
  The Black Sea Fleet command is voicing its resolute protest 
to the Ukrainian military department in connection with the 
capture of the fleet division, and regards actions such as this 
to be a bandit attack which has gone beyond the control of 
military formations. 
  Besides, two vehicles with commandos are reported to have 
been sent to Odessa to the location of hydrographic units of the 
Black Sea Fleet. These units are also being blockaded by up to 
40 commandos".

evacuated today due to the unpredictable situation in the

  [Excerpts] Moscow, 12 Apr -- Russia firmly condemns the 
pointless bloody slaughter carried out in Kigali and the killing 
of the prime minister and other state figures, a representative 
of the Africa Department of the Russian Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs said in an interview for the ITAR-TASS correspondent. 
[passage omitted] 
  At present the situation in Rwanda is continuing to 
deteriorate. The aborted cease-fire talks produced no result. 
The events in Rwanda have dealt a serious political blow to the 
Arusha peace process and the United Nations' peacekeeping 
operation has been put in jeopardy. 
  Russia calls on the opposing sides to halt hostilities 
immediately and to resume a constructive dialogue with the 
participation of all the country's political forces in order to 
settle the domestic political conflict in Rwanda as soon as 
possible on the basis of the Arusha accords and the relevant UN 
Security Council decisions, said the representative of the 
Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

Kolesnikov, chief of the General Staff of Russia's armed forces, 
who is currently here on a four-day visit, has held talks with 
his Chinese counterpart, Colonel-General Zhang Wannian. 
  The two military leaders discussed the course of 
negotiations 
on a reduction in armed forces in the area of the 
Russian-Chinese border, confidence-building measures in the 
military field and matters connected with exchanges of 
delegations between the two countries' defence ministries. 
Kolesnikov set out the main provisions of Russia's military 
doctrine. 
  On Tuesday Kolesnikov had a meeting with Liu Huaqing, member 
of the standing committee of the Political Bureau of the Chinese 
Communist Party Central Committee and deputy chairman of China's 
Central Military Council. 
  The two sides expressed satisfaction with the development of 
contacts between the armed forces of the two states, which 
promotes stronger friendship, good-neighbourliness and trust 
between Russia and China, and peace in the Asia-Pacific region 
and throughout the world. 
  Kolesnikov visited the guards division of Beijing garrison 
where he familiarised himself with the combat training of 
Chinese servicemen. On Tuesday afternoon the Russian general 
left by air for Shanghai for a meeting with the command of

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Grigoriy Arslanov] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 12 Apr -- Russo-Chinese consultations on 
bilateral and international issues were held in Beijing on 10-12 
April. The Russian delegation was headed by Russian Deputy 
Foreign Minister Aleksandr Panov and the Chinese delegation by 
PRC Deputy Foreign Minister Dai Binggau. Igor Rogachev, Russian 
Federation ambassador to the PRC, attended the consultations. 
The head of the Russian delegation was received by Qian Qichen, 
vice premier of the State Council and PRC foreign minister. 
  The sides held an in-depth exchange of views on a wide range 
of issues in bilateral and international cooperation. Practical 
preparations for the visit to the PRC by Viktor Chernomyrdin, 
chairman of the Russian Federation Government, were started. 
Prospects for the further expansion of high-level exchanges and 
contacts between Russia and China were discussed. Both sides 
expressed a wish to develop good-neighborly, friendly relations 
between the Russian Federation and the PRC, which are an 
important factor for stability in the Asian-Pacific region and 
the world as a whole. 
  There was a constructive discussion of international issues 
of interest to both sides, with the accent placed on the 
situation in the Asian-Pacific region and the Korean peninsula 
in particular. The sides agreed to continue close consultations 
on these and other bilateral and international questions. 
  In an interview with an ITAR-TASS correspondent, Panov said 
that relations with China were unquestionably one of the 
priority areas in Russian foreign policy. It is very 
gratifying, he said, that an intense, high-level summit dialogue 
will take place this year. It is also pleasing that our new 
parliament has begun to pay a great deal of attention to China. 
State Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin plans to visit the PRC. 
Parliament will hold hearings at the end of April on 
Russo-Chinese relations. 
  So active are the high-level contacts that, for Russian 
diplomacy, this year will be the year of Russo-Chinese 
relations, as it were. Panov said that this scale of bilateral 
contacts is not planned with any other country. This truly is 
very important for us, since China is not only a neighbor, but 
also Russia's partner in economic matters and in the 
international arena. For this reason, it is extremely important 
for us to synchronize watches and positions on the main aspects 
of bilateral and international relations. He noted that this 
will enable us to plan our further moves more confidently. 
  During the second meeting with Minister Qian Qichen and at 
the consultations, Panov said, we had a detailed discussion 
about North Korea's nuclear program. The Russian Federation and 
the PRC agree that this problem must be solved, first and 
foremost, through talks, without pressure, without exacerbating 
the situation. Both sides advocate that the Korean peninsula 
should be nuclear-free and that the military confrontation 
should be reduced. Our aims in this respect are identical. At 
the present stage, the Chinese side believes that priority 
should be given to talks among four partners: the United States, 
the DPRK, the Republic of Korea, and the IAEA [International 
Atomic Energy Agency]. However, the leadership of the Chinese 
Foreign Ministry does not rule out the possibility that an 
international conference, as proposed by Russia, could play a 
role at some stage in the future. 
  We also believe in trying out various different channels for 
resolving this problem, the Russian diplomat stressed. If the 
problem cannot be resolved bilaterally, we believe that the 
international channel could be used, Panov said.

  [Text] Yesterday Radio Moldova, quoting sources in 
Tiraspol, informed its listeners about the presence in Moscow of 
General Aleksandr Lebed, the commander of the 14th Army of the 
Russian Federation. General Lebed had held meetings with 
President Boris Yeltsin and Russian Defense Minister Pavel 
Grachev. The same sources said that during the meeting, they 
approached issues related to the future situation of the 14th 
Army, and especially, the partial transportation to Russia of 
its military patrimony and the turning of the 14th Army into a 
Russian military base on the territory of the Republic of 
Moldova, BASAPRESS news agency informs. 
  According to the same news agency, the Tiraspol command of 
the 14th Army was attributed the status of military police. At 
the same time the number of the personnel of the former command 
was increased by placing under its subordination the battalion 
of military police set up by former employees of the Tiraspol 
[Dniester Republic] juridical bodies. Its military command was 
taken out of the jurisdiction the command of the 14th Army and 
transferred to that of Russia's Interior Ministry.

<F P=106> [Boris Vinogradov report: "Pavel Grachev Creating Special </F>
Region in Kaliningrad. Lech Walesa Alarmed"] 
  [Text] Polish President Lech Walesa has called the number 
of Russian troops in Kaliningrad Oblast an "alarming 
phenomenon." He does not understand why it is necessary to 
maintain such a powerful grouping in peacetime, and has called 
on Western politicians not to close their eyes to this 
"excessive militarization." 
  While in Riga recently, Walesa expressed concern at the fact 
that there are around 100,000 Russian troops in the Kaliningrad 
area. His position is shared by Lithuania, which has a common 
border with the oblast. Vilnius began to be particularly 
insistent in demanding explanations after Pavel Grachev, who 
visited Baltiysk in mid-March, announced that Russia intends to 
set up a "special defense region" in Kaliningrad Oblast. 
  The new term used by the minister came as a surprise both to 
military strategists and to diplomats. At any rate, the Russian 
Foreign Ministry could tell us nothing instructive on this 
score. With a view to its geopolitical uniqueness we can guess 
what makes the region "special." It is harder to understand 
whom it is necessary to provide a defense against. Against a 
potential aggressor on sea or land, according to Grachev. 
  Vilnius and Warsaw are on their guard. Germany and the other 
NATO countries are being tactful. The British General Hardy 
Johnson, commander in chief NATO Forces, Northern Europe, who 
visited the Baltiysk naval base the other day, said that he 
respects Russia's right to have near Kaliningrad the army it 
considers necessary. As long as its size does not go beyond the 
framework of the Europe-wide CFE treaty. 
  Under the treaty, the Defense Ministry explained, Russia 
could keep 3,800 tanks and one-third of all its Armed Forces in 
the enclave. Thus, as far as "militarization" is concerned, 
this quota has by no means been used up. But this does not mean 
that the grouping will be increased. 
  Meanwhile, Lithuania continues to propose that NATO and the 
CSCE elaborate a special regime for Kaliningrad which, it 
claims, will lose its status of "Russian enclave" by the year 
2000 in accordance with the Potsdam agreements. Admittedly, the 
idea met with no support from the Western states, which are 
proclaiming the principle of the inviolability of postwar 
borders. 
  Vilnius itself is taking steps toward "demilitarization," 
placing obstacles in the way of military trains crossing 
Lithuanian territory, making detachments [komandy] disembark, 
and not allowing the transit of combat hardware into Kaliningrad.

<F P=106> [Report by Aleh Hruzdilovich: "Butrus-Ghali: `Chernobyl Is </F>
a Symbol of International Solidarity'"] 
  [Text] As expected, the second day of UN Secretary General 
Butrus-Ghali's visit to Belarus was devoted to Chernobyl issues. 
At any rate, Chernobyl problems prevailed during his meetings 
with Supreme Soviet Chairman Mechyslaw Hryb, Prime Minister 
Vyacheslaw Kebich, and Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Kenik who is 
also chairman of the State Committee for Dealing with the 
Aftermath of Chernobyl. They were also the focus during his 
visit to the radiation medicine clinic in Aksakawshchyna. Mr. 
Butrus-Ghali has received sufficient information to fully 
realize the scope of the Chernobyl catastrophe aftermath. 
During a meeting at the Supreme Soviet, he promised his 
personal support for keeping Chernobyl issues alive on the UN 
agenda. 
  The results of the two-day talks held by the UN secretary 
general in Minsk were assessed by Foreign Minister Pyotr 
Krawchanka as follows: "Mr. Butrus-Ghali fully supported our two 
Chernobyl projects. The first one, amounting to $12 million, 
concerns the carrying out of permanent radiation monitoring of 
the Republic. The second one, whose cost can be evaluated 
approximately at $8 million, concerns devising a project to 
build a plant manufacturing organic food for children. 
Butrus-Ghali indicated that the UN budget has no provision for 
financing these projects, and proposed looking for sponsors -- 
firms and various international funds, to which he promised all 
kinds of support." 
  Regarding other issues discussed during the talks, Pyotr 
Krawchanka informed that they were primarily devoted to 
relations between Belarus and the United Nations (great progress 
has been achieved in that area), as well as to the issue of 
nonproliferation of nuclear weapons. Our side confirmed its 
intent to fulfill the agreements on the nonproliferation of 
nuclear weapons, which were signed earlier for the period until 
1995, as well as the possibility of prolonging them for a new 
period, or giving them a set character. 
  The issue of Belarus' participation in various UN 
peacekeeping actions was also discussed. The Belarusian side 
highly estimated these international efforts and expressed its 
support in principle for activities leading to the suppression 
of existing conflicts. Regarding the direct participation of 
Belarus in such peacekeeping actions, it was stated that these 
issues are under the jurisdiction of the Belarusian Supreme 
Soviet. Concrete proposals from the United Nations to assist 
Belarus with disarmament were also discussed. 
  During the meeting of UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali with 
Prime Minister Kebich, issues of economic cooperation of the 
Republic with the international community were discussed in 
detail along with the difficulties facing Belarus on the path 
toward reforms. Later in the day, Butrus-Ghali laid a wreath at 
the Peramoha monument and delivered a speech at the Belarusian 
Academy of Sciences. This afternoon, his visit is coming to a 
close, but on the eve of his departure a news conference should 
be held, after which we will be able to give our readers more 
details about the results of UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali's 
visit to Belarus.

Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy; edited by Vladimir 
Shishlin] 
  [Text] The chairman of parliament Mechyslaw Hryb has told 
voters in the regional capital Vitebsk that legislators will not 
ratify the treaty with Russia on the unification of monetary 
systems, if the government signs the document on Russian terms 
which implies the closure of the National Bank of Belarus and 
the unification of the budgets. The speaker is convinced that 
the agreement must not undermine the sovereignty of his country. 
  He still thinks that before the treaty is signed the 
banknotes of the National Bank should remain the only legal 
tender in Belarus. He is alarmed by the fact that during the 
five months of waiting for the unification trade, industry and 
mutual settlements have frozen. Hryb said Belarus should get 
full clarity on the matter as soon as possible because every day 
of uncertainty "brings us closer to disaster." 
  Hryb sees the future of the country in a mixed 
socially-oriented economy with a sufficiently strong role of the 
government. In his opinion the economy can stabilize only on 
condition of the revival of a common production space primarily 
with Russia. 
  (INTERFAX Note: The parliament has ratified the treaty of an 
economic union with Russia. Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich 
finds it necessary to back the move by a public vote on 23 June 
simultaneously with the first presidential elections. During 
the vote the attitude of the nation to economic integration with 
Russia could be defined. Quoting public opinion polls the prime 
minister claims that the absolute majority of Belarusians 
support a union with Russia. In the opinion of Kebich the 
referendum would be an important instrument of strengthening 
political stability in the country. Local experts view the 
proposal of Kebich as an important political move by one of the 
strongest candidates for presidency.) 
  Meanwhile, Hryb has not decided whether he is going to join 
the race. "I must frankly admit that I am afraid of assuming 
such a burden because I realize the responsibility it implies," 
he told voters in Vitebsk. Answering the question why the 
constitution was approved by the parliament, not through a 
public vote Hryb said that a referendum is the most uncivilized 
way of approving the constitution because far from all citizens 
could express a competent opinion of the fundamental law, while 
the Belarusian Constitution was carefully examined by experts of 
all levels for two and a half years.

Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy; edited by Vladimir 
Shishlin] 
  [Text] The main purpose of a recent tete-a-tete meeting 
between Moldovan President Mircea Snegur and the leader of the 
Republic's separatist mainly Russian-speaking region of 
Dniester, Igor Smirnov, was "to provide conditions for 
negotiations on the status of the Dniester Region," said 
Snegur's adviser Nicolae Osmochescu. In an exclusive interview 
with INTERFAX, Osmochescu said the two leaders had also dealt 
with a set of economic and financial problems, such as reviving 
ties between enterprises in Moldova and Dniester and restoring 
destroyed communications. 
  Osmochescu said Snegur and Smirnov had agreed that the talks 
should be based on a report by a mission of the Conference on 
Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), which proposes 
extensive autonomy for Dniester, implying the separation of 
powers between central authority in Kishinyov [Chisanau] and the 
Dniester government, Dniester's exclusive jurisdiction over 
certain matters and joint jurisdiction over others. 
  The adviser said Snegur and Smirnov had decided that all 
future negotiations would be mediated by the CSCE mission and 
Russian representatives. They also agreed that, at the next 
meeting, Moldova and Dniester should be represented by 
delegations rather than by their two leaders and that teams of 
experts should be formed to draw up a package of accords, mainly 
an agreement on Dniester's legal status. 
  Smirnov congratulated Snegur on the ratification by the 
Moldovan Parliament of Moldova's membership in the CIS and in 
the Commonwealth Economic Union, Osmochescu said. IF Note: The 
ratification was welcomed both by Dniester and by Gagauzia, 
another independent-minded region in Moldova. Dniester State 
Secretary Valeriy Litskay told INTERFAX it made possible a new 
dialogue between Moldova and Dniester, and at a new level too. 
The leaders of Gagauzia, where the majority of the population 
speaks Gagauz, a Turkic language, take the same view. According 
to its president, Stepan Topal, Gagauzia, which unilaterally 
proclaimed itself a republic, has been pressing for the 
ratification of Moldova's membership in the CIS and its economic 
union for the last two years. Topal told INTERFAX he expected 
the policy of the Agrarian Democratic and Socialist Parties, 
which the last general elections brought into power, to provide 
a good basis for resuming Gagauz-Moldovan talks and putting it 
at a new level. 
  Osmochescu said the meeting between Snegur and Smirnov had 
been held in "favorable and constructive atmosphere" and had 
been marked by "both sides' desire to throw off the old burden 
of mutual resentment and base their decisions on today's 
reality." The meeting broke the deadlock in the talks between 
Moldova and Dniester, Osmochescu believes. 
  "Now everything depends on the level of the teams formed to 
draw up the package of documents. It is important that the 
people who are included in them should also wish to break the 
impasse. The delegations appointed by Dniester in the past were 
doing their best to obstruct the negotiations by casuistical 
disputes," Osmochescu said. 
  He said the Dniester side agreed that the teams should 
include new, realistically-minded politicians ready for 
"reasonable compromise." Provided Dniester was willing to 
cooperate, the talks could be completed within the next six 
months, Osmochescu said. "I see two alternative solutions to 
the problem. The first one is to pass a law on the legal status 
of Dniester before the Moldovan constitution is adopted. Then 
the law would be incorporated into the constitution. The other 
is to formalize a special status for Dniester in the 
constitution," Osmochescu said, adding that he favored the 
former option.

<F P=106> [KAZTAG report: "To Sharply Accelerate Economic Reform"] </F>
  [Text] President Nursultan Nazarbayev held a conference on 
the issues of speeding up the implementation of economic reform 
in the Republic. Among the participants were Vice President Erik 
Asanbayev, deputy prime ministers, state advisers and other 
members of the government, top officials from the National Bank 
and the National Academy of Sciences, and high-ranking staff of 
the president's and the Cabinet of Ministers' apparat. 
  In his address at the conference, Nursultan Nazarbayev 
emphasized the urgent need to accelerate the corrections to the 
government's program of action in reforming the economy, as well 
as improving the organization of this work and corresponding 
mechanisms. 
  Since the time of introducing the national currency, the 
heads of state and the government have issued more than 200 
edicts, decrees, and directives of a normative-prescriptive 
nature on the matters of development and intensification of 
economic reform. Thereby a number of serious problems of a 
legislative nature have been resolved, and the normative base 
considerably updated. 
  However, noted the president, a system approach and 
purposefulness are still lacking in the implementation of the 
entire complex of envisaged measures; there is insufficient 
coordination in the activities of ministries and government 
apparat offices in the preparation of normative-prescriptive 
documents and the organization of their implementation in 
practice. There are also disjointed actions between the National 
Bank and the Cabinet of Ministers in conducting a single strict 
financial-credit policy. Nor has the principal task of creating 
within the framework of the government and its structures an 
effective executive mechanism been resolved. 
  As a result, the process--from the moment documents are 
adopted to the point of their practical implementation--is 
stretched out impermissibly long and most normative acts are 
left hanging in midair. Moreover, some of them are consciously 
sabotaged. This is especially typical of those acts that involve 
changes in the administrative structure in industrial sectors. 
Operational decisions and measures adopted by ministries and the 
National Bank often are not correlated with one another or they 
contradict the program line. 
  For the purpose of streamlining this work, as well as 
preparing the Program of Anticrisis Measures and Economic 
Stabilization for 1994-95, a republic commission was set up by 
the president's decree in January of this year. However, it 
still has not completed the draft of this important document and 
incorporated in it existing alternative proposals, in which 
there are also healthy nuggets of wisdom. Such procrastination 
is unacceptable, and it is not accidental that it causes 
resentment among the economic public and in the mass media. The 
commission should finally determine, urgently and clearly, which 
parts of alternative programs may be used for the benefit of the 
business at hand, and what should be discarded for the lack of 
constructive contents, and make the results public, thus putting 
an end to idle talk. 
  Unenviable fate also befell the latest plan of government 
actions--for the implementation of economic policy in 1944. The 
control functions had been assigned to the Ministry of the 
Economy, which itself is not succeeding in the execution of this 
document. In addition, some ministries, bypassing the Ministry 
of the Economy, petition the government to move the time frame 
for the implementation of one or another part, or revise them. 
This cannot go on any longer, said Nursultan Nazarbayev. 
  In connection with the current situation, he brought up a 
number of cardinal proposals aimed at accelerating development 
of a program to intensify the reform. 
  The main emphasis, in the president's opinion, should be 
placed on increasing authority and dramatically improving the 
activities of executive power structures and state organs of 
administration. The measures necessary for this have been 
outlined; they are to be conducted within several areas. 
  The first is the legal base for the reform. The normative 
base with respect to main economic spheres and direction of the 
reform, created by the president's and government's decisions 
since the introduction of the national currency, should be 
systematically organized and evaluated to provide a sufficient 
base, and where additional development of normative acts is 
needed. 
  The next area is effective use of aid provided by the world 
community. All channels of financial aid from international 
organizations and foreign countries going through the government 
need to be merged within directions, economic sectors, and the 
Republic's social sphere. It is also important to work out the 
main principles and mechanisms of its utilization, including 
program support, state structures and other institutions 
responsible for project implementation, and the use and 
repayment of credits and loans received for such use. 
  Next, development of individual spheres of domestic economic 
policy. In this area it is necessary to fully evaluate the real 
structural transformations that have been accomplished in the 
national economy. Large-scale projects of national significance 
and ones that are ready for implementation need to be selected, 
and the measures of support in corresponding decisions be 
drafted. It is also necessary to define economic spheres and 
sectors that will be developing along the lines of separate 
programs--entrepreneurship, insurance operations, defense and 
other complexes--and set strict deadlines, as well as designate 
those responsible for the preparation of real programs. 
  Among other subjects mentioned were the expedience of 
drafting five-year plans by indicators, beginning with 1995; 
further support for privatization processes and holding 
structures, giving them greater freedom of action; facilitating 
development of consumer goods production; increasing the volume 
of processing of agricultural products; reorganizing the work of 
the state statistics system, which in many respects still 
operates in the old mode; and other current problems. 
  The decisive factor in achieving the goals set is good 
organization of the work of state organs and the entire 
executive apparat. This means that distribution of powers and 
functions between ministries and other government organs must be 
analyzed and revised, and as a result the responsibility for 
implementation of a specific area of economic policy clearly 
assigned to each. It appears that in this respect it will be 
necessary to eliminate the still-existing duplication of effort, 
which will require structural changes with sensible staff 
reductions. 
  Among those who participated in the subsequent exchange of 
opinions were First Deputy Prime Minister Akezhan Kazhegeldin, 
Deputy Prime Minister Zhanybek Karibzhanov, and the State 
Antitrust Policy Committee Chairman Petr Svoyikh. Deputy Prime 
Minister Sergey Kulagin reported on the progress of preparation 
for the spring sowing campaign. 
  It has been decided to complete preparation for the program 
for activation of implementation of the economic reform within a 
compressed time frame and to discuss it immediately afterwards. 
The president also intends to consider in the nearest future the 
issues associated with denationalization and privatization, 
adjustments to the program of social protection of the 
population, housing policy, and intensification of suppression 
of crime.

<F P=106> ["Decree of the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan On </F>
Further Improvement of Land Cadastre"] 
  [Text] [no dateline as received] On the basis of the law of 
the Republic of Kazakhstan on temporary delegation of additional 
powers to the president of the Republic of Kazakhstan and heads 
of local administrations, in order to ensure economic regulation 
of land relations while effecting various transactions with the 
rights for life-long inherited ownership and for use of land, I 
decree as follows: 
  1. Heads of local administrations, within the scope of their 
authorization for allocating land plots defined by the Land Code

gifts, lease and mortgage their right for life-long inherited 
ownership on land to other individuals and legal entities. 
Legal entities, excluding state-owned agricultural enterprises, 
which receive plots of land for use or rent, can sell, lease, or

  [Text] [no dateline as received] Bakyt Ospanov, chairman of 
the State Committee for Land Cadastre and Tenure, comments as 
follows on the presidential decree on improvement of land 
cadastre: 
  Land is Kazakhstan is only owned by the government, but when 
people sell their individual houses or gardens, they virtually 
sell the land on which these gardens or buildings are located. 
The government is losing a lot of money thereby as it does not 
participate in these transactions. This new decree gives us a 
simple solution that does not affect the constitutional legal 
basis. In accordance with this decree, heads of local 
administrations do not sell the land which belongs to the state, 
but sell the right for using this land during one's life time 
and for leaving it to be used by one's heirs. In other words, 
ownership on land is separated from ownership on life-long 
inherited right for using this land. This means that land 
relations are included in the market turnover, thus creating 
conditions for accumulation of additional mortgage means on 
banking accounts. The government becomes the main regulator of 
land relations and receives profit in the form of dues from 
these transactions.

  [Text] In Kyrgyzstan President Askar Akayev has spoken of 
the need to strengthen all levels of government in the country. 
He said the deepening of economic reforms is the prime concern 
of the authorities. He spoke on Monday at a closed session of 
the cabinet attended by the heads of local administrations. 
  The presidential press secretary Iman Rysaliyev told 
INTERFAX 
that the president pointed to the need for strengthening the 
akimat -- community of heads of local administrations. He also 
stressed that the current decline in production should not be 
linked to a crisis in government structures. He said that 
despite the difficulties in economic restructuring certain 
achievements have been gained primarily in monetary policy. 
Last month inflation dropped to a 5-percent level and prices 
stabilized. The main task is to reorganize the economy so that 
it would operate to 90 percent on local raw materials. 
  The president also spoke for stopping all political rhetoric 
concerning gold and gold mines. He thinks the government should 
take steps in the nearest future so that foreign companies, in 
particular from Canada and the United States, would finally 
begin gold mining in Kyrgyzstan.

  [Text] The inter-Tajik talks to stabilize the situation in 
Tajikistan are continuing in Moscow. This was told to a 
correspondent of the Khovar news agency by Rahim Hasanov, a 
spokesman of the Tajik Embassy in Russia, yesterday. On the 
second and third days of the talks, the sides continued the 
discussion of the agenda with the mediation of Ramiro 
Piriz-Ballon, the UN secretary general's special envoy. The 
issues related to achievement of a cease-fire and stopping the 
acts of provocation on the Tajik-Afghan border were entered on 
the agenda by proposals of the Tajik Government delegation. 
  Shukurjon Zuhurov, the head of the Tajik Government 
delegation, proposed that a joint declaration to put an end to 
hostilities, especially on the Tajik-Afghan border, be adopted 
in the course of talks as a top priority task. Issues related to 
repatriation of refugees, disarming illegal bands, and involving 
all citizens of Tajikistan -- in particular those citizens 
living outside the territories of the Republic -- in discussion 
of a draft of a new constitution, are among the issues raised by 
the sides. 
  The sides are going to thoroughly study each point of the 
agenda. Today, the sides are going to consult with experts. The 
representatives of the United Nations, the Foreign Ministries of 
Russia, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan, and the 
representatives of the Embassies of Iran, Afghanistan, and 
Pakistan are attending the talks as observers.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Gridneva] </F>
  [Text] Dushanbe 11 April, TASS -- The People's Party of 
Tajikistan, a new socio-political organisation, would like to 
actively assist the process of political, economic, and 
religious renewal of the Tajik society. 
  The party's rules and programme were published in Sunday's 
newspapers. The programme's strategic goal was named as being 
"the union of all Tajikistan citizens, regardless of their 
nationality, native language, political beliefs, and 
professional and ethno-cultural orientation, for the sake of 
building a law-based, democratic, secular state." 
  Further, the programme called for Tajikistan's "active 
participation in a civilized transition to a market economy with 
the maintenance of state-provided education, health care, 
cultural programmes, social security for the underprivileged, 
and other social programmes." 
  In their statements, the party's founders do not try to hide 
their desire to come to power by nominating their 
representatives to posts in state and governmental structures 
and by receiving a majority of deputy mandates in the new 
parliament. However, they categorically condemn any attempts to 
achieve such goals through violence. 
  At the same time, note independent observers, the new party 
does not need to win power, since the idea of organising the new 
political structure originated in the highest governmental 
structures themselves. Chairman of the new party's 
organisational committee is First Deputy Chairman of 
Tajikistan's Supreme Soviet Abdumadzhi Dostyev. 
  The social make-up of the new party is likewise easy to 
foresee. Many heads of local councils and administrations, as 
well as a majority of the Republic's industrial managers' corps, 
have already declared their intention of joining the new party.

  [Text] The leader of the Tajikistan's Political and 
Economic Renovation Party (TPERP), Mukhtor Bobokhonov, told the 
party's first official news conference in Dushanbe Friday that 
no opposition to the government was acceptable in Tajikistan at 
the moment. "It may cause an allergic reaction among the 
people," he was quoted as saying. At present, the TPERP is the 
first officially registered party in Tajikistan since January 
1993 when all political parties and movements, except for the 
Communists, were banned. 
  According to Bobokhonov, the TPERP basically encompassed 
young entrepreneurs, scientists and economists. The party's 
main goal is to promote the economic revival of Tajikistan and 
the establishment of peace in the republic. To achieve this 
goal, the new party will cooperate with all social and political 
forces of the Republic, Bobokhonov said. Asked about the party's 
economic program, Bobokhonov said its top priority was to create 
a nongovernment pension fund to protect all layers of society. 
He hoped the Tajik leadership would support this initiative. 
Commenting on the presence of Russian troops in Tajikistan, 
Bobokhonov said it was necessary at the moment to guarantee 
peace and security in the region.

  [Text] Stepanakert, April 10 (SNARK)--Today at dawn 
Azerbaijani units, supported by a large number of tanks and 
other military hardware, went over offensive. The offensive was 
assumed in the north part of Karabakh front in the direction of 
Tonashen settlement (Mardakertskiy region). SNARK was informed 
of this in the Karabakh Defence Army Headquarters. 
  Before the attack the Karabakh Forces defending that part of 
the confrontation line had been shelled. 
  At 10 a.m. hard fights took place here. The Karabakh Defence 
army units manage to repel the massed attacks of the Azerbaijani 
units. 
  The Karabakh leaders are of the opinion that the official 
Baku is deliberately increasing tension in the conflict zone 
just before the summit talks being prepared by the Russian 
Foreign Affairs Ministry, and a new meeting of CSCE Minsk group, 
which starts today in Prague. Baku still relies on force 
methods, once again defying the World Community, which makes 
efforts to settle the problem by peaceful means.

  [Text] The day's important news item is that the situation 
is again exceedingly aggravated in the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic 
[NKR]. We have not yet received further details to add to the 
report already transmitted by my colleagues. For those who have 
not heard our previous newscast, let me say that according to 
the press service of NKR Defense Army headquarters, the 
Azerbaijani Army launched a large attack in the north of NKR's 
Mardakertskiy Rayon yesterday. The large aggressive action was 
launched on the eve of the upcoming high-level talks on the 
settlement of the Karabakh conflict. Those talks were prepared 
by the Russian Foreign Ministry. The attack came a day before 
the opening of the CSCE Minsk Group talks on Nagorno-Karabakh in 
Prague today. 
  The Azerbaijani Air Force subjected NKR's peaceful cities 
and 
villages to massive air strikes yesterday. Three residents were 
killed and nine were injured only during the bombing of 
Stepanakert's residential quarters. Most of the victims are 
women and children. A number of residential buildings in the 
city were destroyed. There are victims in the NKR's other 
settlements, which also came under air attack. 
  The Azerbaijani warplanes tried to launch air strikes 
against 
civilian objects today. In the meantime, battles are continuing 
in the northern sector of the front where the Karabakh forces 
are halting the enemy's attacks. 
  The NKR leadership believes that in exacerbating the 
situation on the Armenian-Azerbaijan conflict zone, Baku is as 
usual relying on brute force and is again challenging the 
international community which is exerting efforts for the 
peaceful settlement of the conflict. They reported from 
Stepanakert that because of the air strikes classes were 
canceled in educational institutions. 
  As regards the situation on Armenia's borders, the Defense 
Ministry press service reported at 1600 that a relative calm has 
prevailed since last night.

<F P=106> [Statement by the Armenian Republic Supreme Council; place </F>
and date not given--read by announcer] 
  [Text] Having violated the airspace of the Nagorno-Karabakh 
Republic [NKR] on 10 April 1994, the Azerbaijani Republic's Air 
Force then bombed a number of NKR communities far from the 
fronts, including the capital Stepanakert. The main target of 
the attack was the crowded market, where there was an enormous 
amount of destruction and many casualties, mostly women and 
children. 
  Regrettably, the international community has not yet paid 
appropriate attention to the policy of bombing peaceful 
communities that the Azerbaijanis have followed since 1992, 
which has given the Azerbaijani authorities free rein to 
continue such operations with impunity. 
  By such savage operations, Azerbaijan is reiterating that it 
has not foregone its policy of state terrorism against the 
people of the NKR, the aim of which is to annihilate the 
civilian population in gross violation of international law, 
particularly the Geneva Convention. This policy is designed to 
expand the conflict and undermine the recently instituted peace 
initiatives. 
  The Armenian Republic's Supreme Council declares that the 
Azerbaijani side will bear full responsibility for any such 
operations. It calls on the UN secretary general, the CSCE, the 
CIS Interparliamentary Assembly, the Europarliament, and the 
parliaments of the world to strongly condemn these military 
operations against civilians and to take effective and urgent 
measures as envisaged by international law to prevent the 
further bombing of communities and to end the unacceptable 
behavior by the Azerbaijani Republic.

<F P=106> [Article by Shamiram Agabekyan: "Armenia on the Threshold of </F>
Voucherization. Prime Minister Bagratyan Predicts Our Fate"] 
  [Text] As has already been reported, participating in the 
discussions in the office of the Ramkavar-Azatakan of Armenia 
Party were not only representatives of sociopolitical 
organizations, members of parliament, and specialists, but also 
Prime Minister of the Republic of Armenia Grant Bagratyan. 
  As for the political forces represented in the discussion, 
all of them were, to put it mildly, extremely skeptical both of 
the reforms and of their authors and supporters. This is 
apparently why the discussion amounted to only conceptual 
criticism. Thus in the view of the Agrarian-Democratic Party, 
the economic transformations are lacking an ideological concept, 
they do not have a social base, and the do not go beyond solving 
purely technical problems (Mels Mkrtchyan). And the 
Constitutional Law Union thinks that the theory of Jeffrey 
Sachs, a professor at Harvard University in the United States, 
is being deliberately transplanted to Armenian soil. But our 
shock therapy is also being carried out with local 
peculiarities: Instead of obedience to the law on property, we 
have a proliferation of clans usurping spheres of the economy. 
Instead of the idea of forming a national bourgeoisie 
proclaimed by the government, we have primitive polarization of 
society. 
  In the view of the representative of the Ramkavar-Azatakan 
of 
Armenia Party, Gagik Galstyan, it is wrong to speak of the 
establishment of a market economy in Armenia because a 
transition to private property does not mean the establishment 
of the market. Different principles are required: In particular, 
competition and the corresponding pricing system, which we do 
not have, but still there has been a dispersion of resources, 
leakage of capital and cadres... 
  Leonid Akonyan, representative of the Communist Party of 
Armenia, thought that for some reason the organizers and 
implementers of the reform equate destatization with 
privatization, while reforming the economy of the former GDR in 
Germany lasted for 10 years, and hundreds of billions of marks 
were allotted for these purposes. Such speedy and random 
privatization, in L. Akonyan's view, is merely a repetition of 
[word illegible] experience of voucher reforms, and that is all. 
  While advising acceleration of privatization as a whole, 
quite a few critical remarks were directed against the 
government by a member of the Union of Merchants, Manuk 
Gasparyan. I think there will be an opportunity to return to 
his speech in one of the next few issues of GOLOS ARMENII, but 
now I shall discuss the speech of Prime Minister of the Republic 
of Armenia Grant Bagratyan--helmsman of the Armenian version of 
the reforms and a passionate champion of them. 
  Grant Bagratyan, while recognizing that dozens of mistakes 
have been made during the process of reforming the economy, 
still sees the overall trend as positive. The prime minister 
did not deny the possibility of mistakes in the future because 
this is not a repeated process but one-time actions, and actions 
that affect the interests of the socium, which break down its 
customary way of life. The government perceives this as a 
natural pattern. 
  Whether slowly or quickly, privatization will take 
place--the 
government sees as its main task making sure that this process 
is controllable. For a random and uncontrolled outcome caused 
by too much haste specifically in industry will lead to the 
appearance of a mass deprivatization war. With such a turn of 
events not only Armenia but any other state would fail to hold 
up on the financial or social, or moral, or political plane. 
  Incidentally, this could be avoided if the labor collectives 
were certain that the changes that were made corresponded 
completely to the spirit and letter of the law. Well, what 
about the law itself? In Bagratyan's view, the legal vacuum is 
broad. To this day we have not defined what property is and 
what property is considered to be. To this day we have no law on 
citizenship, on deposits, on bankruptcy, we have not determined 
the status of public and private joint-stock companies, we have 
not decided the fate of productions operating at a loss.... 
With the reality being like this, property will be distributed 
and rights will be granted without determining responsibilities. 
  As the prime minister stated, privatization is not an end in 
itself but the creation of a field for effective activity. And 
the elimination of state property is the only means. As 
corroboration for what he said he gave this example: When the 
government was analyzing budget incomes and expenditures it 
became clear that each year 1,700,000 tonnes of garbage are 
taken from the capital alone. And only 10 percent of the cost is 
paid from local funds and the rest comes from the budget. But 
this quantity of garbage does not physically exist. 
  The prime minister was referring to the fact that the 
parliament absolutely does not take into account these 
government services-- maneuvering and balancing with state 
property under conditions of free prices. So during the 
discussion of the budget, with whose professional level Grant 
Bagratyan was extremely dissatisfied, they did not even raise 
the question of how, for example, the construction of a building 
is financed or how the cost of the shipment of that same garbage 
is determined... 
  As the prime minister said, when creating a state it is 
necessary on the move to turn over the layers of a whole epoch. 
A pedantic, bureaucratized government could reject the process 
of privatization altogether, claiming, if nothing else, that it 
does not know to whom it should distribute the certificates. 
Incidentally, there are many "buts" of this kind. 
  Even with successful privatization of 80 percent of the 
enterprises, the distribution of the limited centralized 
resources will be extremely problematic because of the lack of a 
mechanism for this. Take just electric energy and water... On 
the one hand it is necessary to proceed from the effectiveness 
of the output. But we must not cast privatized enterprises to 
the caprice of fate. Just because, say, Armelektromash is 
privatized this does not mean that its problems are 
automatically solved, and at least the supply of metal must be 
regulated at the state level, that is, through the efforts of 
the government. 
  With all this, measures are also being taken to render 
assistance to privatized enterprises. Thus a club of 
entrepreneurs is being created and it will have the opportunity 
to meet regularly with the government in order to solve problems 
jointly. 
  Grant Bagratyan included purely organizational problems in 
another group of measures. Within two or three weeks the 
republic will receive all kinds of vouchers. At the same time 
the tax and customs services are being technically re-equipped, 
which, in particular, will help to avoid negative occurrences in 
the customs system. It will also be necessary to revise the 
structure for administration of the economy. 
  In general and on the whole the prime minister considers it 
realistic to begin the privatization of small facilities in May 
and enterprises in June, and also to complete some of the unpaid 
privatization by the beginning of September. 
  The prime minister did not deny that there have been and 
will 
continue to be omissions here because it is not at all easy to 
draw up a list of 15,000 facilities... But he assures us that 
the plan that has been chosen, the alternatives, and also the 
laws that have been adopted will create better conditions in 
Armenia than are found in Russia. In April of last year the 
"Armenian" version was discussed in the Hague with the 
participation of the World Bank, and it gained approval. This 
has to do with privatization of enterprises under the conditions 
of the notorious 20 percent. This has to do also with the fact 
that the "Armenian" version to a certain degree precludes the 
sad Russian experience when, for example, the president of a 
joint-stock company, deciding to earn $2 million, sends the 
company's funds abroad. 
  The unpreparedness of the corps of directors causes the 
prime 
minister to have misgivings. Nor do we have the corresponding 
socium, which would bring pressure to bear on the leaders of the 
joint-stock companies, forcing them to function effectively. In 
the prime minister's view, no ideology, even the very best, can 
provide for development of minds--this takes time. And he is 
afraid that this time will also provide more occasion for 
criticism, and it cannot be ruled out that there will be 
political blackmail of the government as well. 
  But Grant Bagratyan, following Chubays' example, intends to 
say nothing since he is confident that he is carrying out a 
mission of historic significance and he must not stray from the 
path, for under conditions of free prices the state sector of 
the economy can be controlled only by political methods which, 
as he stated, will be manifested in one way or another. 
  And difficulties are inevitable when establishing a market: 
Some enterprises will stay afloat and others will not. Even 
today it is possible to tell which productions and organizations 
will "stay afloat" and which will not, because from many signs 
it is already obvious who has behaved how under the conditions 
of free prices and the transition to the market. The Institute 
of Physics provides an extremely clear example. Having found a 
practical application for its accelerator, the institute 
received an order for $2 million. Other institutes have shown 
that they have been marking time all these years and merely 
reproducing outdated developments. Of course they are doomed. 
  There is the fear that everything will be attributed to 
privatization. Moreover, against this background it is possible 
that there will be a large wave of antiprivatization, for 
everything that today is concealed from people's eyes by the 
so-called state status will come to the surface. Then it will 
be possible to see who is good and who is bad, who is able to 
work and who is not, who is stealing, who is trading, and who is 
speculating. 
  There is also the danger of the appearance of the so-called 
"Vietnam syndrome." After the end of a military confrontation 
several tens of thousands of people may make claims against the 
society: We were in the trenches and you were dividing up the 
property. We must keep an eye out for a solution to this 
problem as well. And not only on the ideological but also on 
the material plane. In any case the property owner must be 
prepared for a year or two or more to compensate, to pay for the 
costs of those who are in the mountains today, who have been 
wounded, who have become disabled... 
  The problem of the diaspora is not the least of the prime 
minister's concerns. It should not have its property rights 
encroached upon, and division into "akhtsarov" and natives must 
not be allowed. But the diaspora will have to make its way 
through moral and psychological discrimination and overcome a 
multitude of other obstacles. 
  In other words society is faced with a harsh but necessary 
transformation through which it must pass. And the more 
quickly--the less painfully. This is why with the distribution 
of vouchers the government will insist parliament allow them to 
be bought and sold, for from now on it will be simply dangerous 
to adopt half-way decisions. 
  Incidentally, with the establishment of the market, in the 
view of the prime minister, political passions will abate. And 
civil accord will be established because the new economic force 
will require stability, laws, and concrete actions. 
  Privatization will also have a favorable effect on the 
formation of the financial market and the stabilization of the 
exchange rate of the dram because a new, convertible commodity 
will be put into circulation: the property of productions--be it 
territory, machine tools, equipment... 
  Being in the best initial positions for privatization and 
having the best production potential, the republic, in 
Bagratyan's view, will soon establish itself in the region as 
completely successful. But under the condition that the natural 
course of economic transformations will not be hampered by 
powerful artificial factors in the form of escalation of the 
confrontation with Azerbaijan, etc. 
  ...Oh, those buts! Were it not for all of them, and 
not only in the form of external factors, the future would look 
bright ahead, would it not? Alas, against the background of the 
current reality it is possible at least to say: Oh, it is hard 
to believe!...

  [Text] Yerevan, April 11 (SNARK) -- Today Vazgen Sargisyan, 
the Armenian State Minister on Defense, speaking in the 
parliament session-hall called two deputies Ashot Bleyan and 
David Vardanyan traitors. These deputies come out against 
forced ways of drafting reservists for three-month assembly. 
  Mr. Sargisyan said after the session's end "these traitors 
must be first to be drafted", while some deputies demanded to 
stop arbitrariness and violence of rights in the course of 
organizing military assemblies. 
  Speaking at the parliament session, Mr.Sargisyan said that 
all who deviate from the draft will be strictly punished. He 
said "We arrest and will arrest them either in the streets or in 
the markets or in the parliament".

<F P=106> [Report by Sergey Bablumyan: "Armenians in Uniform Were </F>
Sought All Over the CIS"] 
  [Text] Yerevan -- Soldiers and officers of Armenia's Armed 
Forces have quite a short time left in which to wear out the 
uniform of the former Soviet Army -- until next fall. However, 
the replacement of one uniform by another is by no means the 
hardest stage on the way to creating a national army. 
Particularly when it is being formed under conditions of an 
undeclared war and a solid transport blockade which is 
paralyzing practically all industry in the republic. 
  "If we could have established a lull on the border with 
Azerbaijan, even for about eight months, but still better for a 
year, we would already have at our disposal the army that we 
need," Major General Mkrtich Abramyan, Armenian deputy minister 
of defense, maintains. 
  The republic's Ministry of Defense maintains that Armenian 
officers in the former Soviet Army were surpassed in numbers 
only by Russians, Ukrainians, and Belarusians. Armenians in 
uniform -- from lieutenants to colonels -- were sought 
throughout the territory of the former Union, but by no means 
all were attracted by service in a republic experiencing the 
incredible difficulties of a blockade. No more than 5-7 percent 
of Armenian officers responded to the call to continue their 
service in Armenia -- which, of course, could not resolve the 
cadre problem. Then it was necessary to appeal to officers who 
had been transferred to the reserve five, 10 or even 15 years 
ago. 
  Armenia needs its own military school, maybe more than one. 
But there are no instructors. Unwise steps in respect of 
Armenia's Russian-speaking population have caused a considerable 
number of experienced military instructors at Yerevan's higher 
educational institutions to leave the republic. Thus, just six 
of the 30 officers who were working recently in the military 
department of the capital's Polytechnical Institute are left. 
The Defense Ministry has sent a certain number of students to 
study in Russian and Belarusian military schools, but this is 
very costly. 
  Another equally important problem is being resolved with 
considerably more success than the process of forming the 
officer corps -- the problem of drafting people for active 
service. The last draft, which was completed last fall, was 105 
percent fulfilled. 
  Gen. Abramyan resolutely refuses to regard Azerbaijan as a 
possible enemy, since Yerevan has not had and does not have any 
territorial claims on Baku. As regards neighboring Turkey, the 
warming of the international situation and also the ongoing 
process of rapprochement between military blocs provide no 
grounds for treating this NATO member country as a military 
enemy either, Mkrtich Abramyan believes. 
  "The skies over Yerevan, as well as Armenia's entire 
airspace, incidentally, are reliably protected by air defense 
facilities. We can see an aerial enemy from afar and are 
capable of hitting him at any altitude," I was told at the 
Defense Ministry. 
  Combat operations have been going on for approximately two 
years now all along the perimeter of the land border with 
Azerbaijan. Many Armenian officers are amassing knowledge and 
experience on company, battalion, and regiment exercises being 
conducted by Russian Army subunits stationed in Armenia. Since 
all the combat and technical facilities in Armenia's arsenal 
were inherited from the former Soviet Union, Russian military 
specialists are teaching their colleagues how to competently 
store, repair, and operate complex combat hardware. 
  Apart from the arms handed over to the republic by the 
command of the former Soviet Army, Armenia does not purchase or 
acquire anything else.

  [Text] Stepakanert, April 11 (SNARK)--An independent 
Russian-language paper "NAGORNY KARABAKH" began publishing in 
Karabakh. Its first issue cited the declaration of Arkadiy 
Gukasyan, Karabakh foreign minister: "Karabakh is now 
independent de-facto and nobody can deny this fact". 
  Marsel Petrosyan, founder and commercial director of the 
paper, told SNARK the main readers of the paper will be those 
Armenians in the CIS, who would like to be aware of the real 
events in their mother land. The circulation of the paper is 
5,000 copies. 
  It is planned to publish "NAGORNY KARABAKH" in English too.

<F P=106> [By ARMENPRESS correspondent Garriy Galustyan for TASS] </F>
  [Text] Yerevan April 11 TASS -- The situation in 
Nagorno-Karabakh has once again worsened. Starting this morning 
Azeri Air Force planes have attempted attacks on civilian. [as 
received] Classes in educational institutions in Stenpanakert 
have been suspended. According to reports received by 
ARMENPRESS from the Nagorno-Karabakh army defence headquarters, 
fighting continues in the northern sector of the front and the 
Mardakert area. Karabakh forces are reported to be repulsing 
enemy attacks. 
  The Nagorno-Karabkah leadership holds the view that by 
inflaming the situation in the Karabakh-Azeri confrontation 
zone, Baku is once again using brute force and challenging the 
international community, which is making efforts to find a 
peaceful solution to the conflict. The Azeri Army is engaging in 
large-scale offensives on the eve of forthcoming high-level 
peace talks for which the Russian Foreign Ministry is making 
preparations, and on the eve of the next regular meeting of the 
conference on security and cooperation in Europe (CSCE) Minsk 
group on Nagorno-Karabakh, which is opening in Prague today.

  [Text] Taking advantage of the peace prevailing for some 
time now, the Armenian armed formations resumed their extensive 
offensive in the north of Karabakh. As always, the enemy again 
used the talks on a temporary cease-fire to revive its spent 
forces, and by misleading the international community it greatly 
strengthened its troops for a new round of offensives. 
  Employing some 2,000 troops and armored cars, the Armenians 
launched an attack against Gulistan in Geranboyskiy 
[Shaumyanovskiy] Rayon and Talish [in northeast of Mardakertskiy 
Rayon] yesterday morning. The enemy temporarily gained the 
initiative in certain places during the battles. 
  Following a fierce artillery barrage today, the Armenian 
infantry troops launched an attack against our army's positions 
along the Terter-Agdam line at 0630. According to reports, the 
battles are continuing. The border settlements in our republic's 
Tauzskiy and Kazakhskiy Rayons came under artillery shelling 
today from the military bases in the Armenian Republic.

Aliyev visited Imishli, Beylagan and Barda regions of the 
republic. The goal of the trip was to gain an up-to-date 
understanding of the present situation of refugees and the 
over-all social and economic situation in those regions. During 
the visit, President Aliyev met with commanders of units located 
in those front regions. 
  Towards the end of the visit he has with local regional 
heads, law enforcement bodies and military personnel the town of 
Beylagan which is the regional center of the region with the 
same name. During meeting President Aliyev said that all levels 
of leadership should coordinate their efforts in dealing with 
the refugees' problems. He mentioned that the front regions are 
the primary grape and cotton producing regions in Azerbaijan. 
President Aliyev said that the presence of refugees in the 
region must not be used as an excuse for the fall in production.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: Compiled by </F>
Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy, edited by Vladimir 
Shishlin] 
  [Text] President Geydar Aliyev who continued Monday an 
inspection trip to the zone of the Karabakh conflict, said 
meeting with the commanders of the republic's armed forces, that 
he was sure that Azerbaijan was able to defend itself with its 
own forces, without relying on the assistance from the outside. 
  The president said he was interested in the "peaceful 
outcome 
of the war, unleashed by Armenia". He said that "the liberation 
of the occupied lands is the sacred duty for each soldier". IF 
Note: The visit by Geydar Aliyev to the frontline zone started 
last Sunday. According to a spokesman for the defense army of 
Nagorno-Karabakh the day was marked by the intensification of 
the offensive by the Azeri Army in the zone of conflict. The 
spokesman said that Azeri air raids against the capital of the 
self-proclaimed republic, Stepanakert, three persons were killed 
and nine wounded [sentence as received]. A source in the Azeri 
Defense Ministry said that yesterday Armenian units attempted to 
attack at the southern part of the front in the Fizuli and 
Beilagan areas of Azerbaijan. Reports from Baku say that the 
offensive was stopped and the Armenians retreated to the initial 
positions. 
  Baku observers say that Aliyev's schedule indicates that the 
Azeri leadership does not stake exclusively on the military 
solution of the problem. It is expected the subject of the 
political settlement of conflicts in the region will be one of 
the central ones during the visit of the Azeri leader to Tbilisi 
scheduled for Tuesday. 
  The agenda of the talks between Aliyev and Eduard 
Shevardnadze is expected to include the forthcoming Moscow 
summit of the CIS leaders on April 15. It is likely that in 
discussing the problem of a regional safety different versions 
of the implementation of the CIS collective security treaty may 
be under discussion. Earlier, Aliyev spoke much about the 
document's inefficiency within the context of the continuing 
hostilities in the zone of the Karabakh conflict which provided 
grounds for speculation on the republic's possible withdrawal 
from the CIS. 
  A reliable source in the president's administration called 
those suppositions groundless. He said that Baku intended 
shortly to urge that the CIS mechanism for curbing external and 
internal aggressors be put into action.

  [Text] Baku (April 11) TURAN -- "Nobody can force us to 
agree on the locating of foreign military bases on the territory 
of the republic if it [the placement of bases] is not in the 
interest of Azerbaijan", said Azerbaijan's Defense Minister, 
Mamedrafi Mamedov. 
  Mamedov opposes the placement of Russian border troops on 
the 
Azerbaijani-Iranian and Azerbaijani-Turkish frontier. 
"Azerbaijan can protect its own southern borders without 
external help", said the Defense Minister. 
  Earlier, Russian Defense Minister, Pavel Grachev, said that 
Russia intends to place one military base on Azeri territory 
Azerbaijan and representatives of Russian military commandants 
have repeatedly stated that they are interested in deploying 
Russian border troops in the southern region of Azerbaijan. 
Sources in the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs told Turan 
that Moscow is dissatisfied with Azerbaijan's refusal. A 
Russian diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, told a 
Turan correspondent that "if Baku refuses, relations between 
Russia and Azerbaijan will worsen. This will cause serious 
economic difficulties in Azerbaijan that will lead to further 
dissatisfaction among the population".

<F P=106> [Regular weekly studio interview with Georgian State Council </F>
chairman Eduard Shevardnadze by journalist Nato Oniani -- live] 
  [Text] [Oniani] Batono Eduard, the past week was rather 
busy. A quadripartite agreement on the return of refugees and 
displaced people and a declaration on the measures to settle the 
Abkhaz- Georgian conflict peacefully reached in Moscow have 
become the subject of parliamentary discussions. You have 
already voiced your stance on these documents but I still want 
to ask you: Do you think the internationalization of the 
conflict has produced any positive effect? And what effect 
could have been expected had the documents been denounced in the 
parliament? 
  [Shevardnadze] Only now can we speak about a real 
internationalization of the settlement and general handling of 
the conflict. Before this, everything was at the level of 
resolutions, as it were. However, resolutions passed by the UN 
Security Council, statements made in various states and the like 
comprise a very significant stage leading to the present 
situation. Favorable conditions have come about for 
international forces to be involved in settlement of the 
conflict. Russia's political role, mentioned repeatedly by the 
Russian leadership and the president, has become more clearcut. 
Our friends have embarked on more active work -- I mean the 
United States, France, England, the FRG, and the CSCE, which is 
also involved in the issue. 
  Negotiations will begin in Geneva tomorrow on the deployment 
of international forces in Abkhazia. The first round of talks 
about the return of refugees ended in Sochi yesterday. A special 
commission has been established in connection with these issues. 
A meeting will be held on the 19th. A very important meeting 
will also be held in Geneva on the 19th which will be mainly 
dedicated to a discussion of various aspects of Abkhazia's 
political status. Thus, a long-expected process has started. 
And it started relatively smoothly. 
  I would like to single out two issues again and again for 
everyone's attention and especially for the attention of our 
brothers, our friends, sisters and mothers -- I mean the 
Abkhazian refugees. The principal aim and task we have assigned 
ourselves during the process of negotiations is the return of 
refugees to their homes. The return must be secure and 
honorable, which will only be when they are met there by joint 
international forces who will have been given adequate rights by 
the United Nations. 
  I cannot avoid repeating that it is regrettable that some 
politicians demonstrate not simply critical or even negative 
attitudes, which are acceptable, but an unexplained 
aggressiveness toward the changes for the better and I would say 
even resentment and fury toward a tendency which has more or 
less shaped as a reassuring one of late. They seem to be 
putting up obstacles against their own country and their own 
people. This cannot provoke a resentful reaction in me. I just 
want to read out, to understand the reasons for such conduct. 
  I believe that a power struggle is behind all this. This is 
also understandable. But in times of present difficulties 
hardly ever experienced by a rich country, we all should think 
of consent and unity and seek ways of overcoming this most 
difficult test for the state and ways of easing the movement 
toward peace and stability, unity and the restoration of 
territorial integrity. 
  I believe that these outbursts in the parliament and 
elsewhere are temporary. Everything depends on how the events 
will develop at negotiations and various meetings and, 
eventually, what decision will be taken by the Security Council. 
If all this develops in a positive way, and decisions are taken 
in conformity with our government's requirements, it will die 
away of its own accord and we all will forget it. 
  [Oniani] Batono Eduard, you have requested the parliament 
to discuss two issues referring to the demands by the 
opposition. One was an issue of the denunciation of the above 
documents and the other was an issue of vote of confidence in 
the authorities. The opposition has withdrawn the demand. Will 
you raise the question of confidence again, say at tomorrow's 
sitting or later? And how justified do you consider raising 
this issue taking into consideration the current complicated 
critical situation? 
  [Shevardnadze] The issue of denunciation was raised but, I 
would say, they lacked the courage to defend their position 
because they were not confident in their correctness and the 
logic of their activities. This position appeared to be mostly 
a pose, I could say a lie or they were probably securing their 
position. In case what has been decided and planned does not 
come true, they will say: Look, we have been warning you about 
all that. 
  That is why I really wanted this issue to be raised and 
voting on the issue to be put on the agenda. And the history 
would retain the names of who was for and who was against. This 
has not happened and I do not worry about it any more. At 
least, the parliament did not share an opinion about the 
denunciation of the agreement and practically consented to what 
we had agreed on in Moscow. As for the vote of confidence, I 
have stated that after the Cabinet of Ministers is established 
we will have to return and consider this issue. Regrettably, 
the Cabinet of Ministers has not been confirmed yet. 
  I have already expressed my stance about the parliament's 
failure to endorse the minister of education. I have expressed 
my opinion about Mr Tamaz Kvachantiradze and a certain sorrow. 
The session will probably be resumed tomorrow and I do hope 
that the issue of establishing the government will be settled in 
a few days. 
  As regards to the next stage, of expressing confidence in 
the 
authorities and the head of state, definite regulations exist in 
motions for a no-confidence vote. The opposition can take a 
motion by getting over 50 votes. Fifty-one votes are required 
to get the issue on the agenda. If the opposition fails to get 
those or does not dare do this, I will find another way to have 
the parliament and the people discuss the issue. The discussion 
will lead to a decision. Because an end should be put to a 
situation when the authorities or the name of the head of state 
or a figure of any other rank are constantly sullied; there 
should be an end to talks about something anti-national, 
anti-state, unjustified, criminal, and various other things 
which are commonplace in parliament. This must be finished one 
way or another. 
  If the state is governed by criminal elements or by inept or 
rather incapable people, and I know who is usually meant and 
this does not require deciphering, we cannot simplify it or shut 
our eyes to it or plug our ears or swallow it just like that. 
That would demonstrate recklessness and incompetence. Neither 
the head of state, not the parliament nor the people can adapt 
to this. If it is close to the truth, a healing mechanism must 
be found. Either remaining or quitting. But whichever it is 
should be deserved. 
  [Oniani] Batono Eduard, I would like to return to the 
Abkhazian issue. Some politicians say that you went to the 
United States to request the deployment of NATO troops in 
Georgia. How do you view the assumption that a head of state 
goes to the United States with a proposition like that? How 
true is this? 
  [Shevardnadze] I would like to say one thing as regards to 
the deployment of U.S. troops or NATO troops and so on. 
Political debates are essential. Nothing can be done without 
them if we want the truth to be achieved. However, generally, 
we have to exclude illegal holds, as sportsmen say, or rather 
lies and arbitrary handling of lies and rumors in politics. A 
lot of lies are said and then the person who is to answer has no 
time and opportunity first to study all these lies and then to 
expose them. 
  For instance, here is a lie that Shevardnadze requested the 
United States to deploy their armed forces and his request was 
refused. In fact, this would be a failure. If you asked 
something and it was the sole purpose of your visit and it was 
turned down, that would be a failure. This was said just like 
that, as if in the course of a conversation. I 
  telephoned the television center and asked them to broadcast 
a reminder that I had not made a request like that while in the 
United States. I requested support for taking a decision on the 
deployment of peace-keeping forces and financing this action, 
because this is one of the most difficult and serious problems. 
[words indistinct] 
  A Western newspaper allegedly said that Shevardnadze' 
request 
was turned down. If it is true, if you really read something 
like this, please do us a favor and name the source, the 
newspaper, the article, and the author who offered a version 
like this. This is an elementary rule. It is an elementary 
rule to cite a person, an author, a work which you are quoting. 
This just said that Shevardnadze was turned down and nothing 
happened. 
  Luckily, I had the television on and I heard this. 
Otherwise, there would have been no reaction and the idea would 
have gained a hold that the head of state went on a visit 
without having studied the issue well in advance and his request 
was turned down. I am talking of only one example. This is a 
false idea wrapped in rags, which has nothing to do with the 
truth. Then they demand that you prove something that cannot be 
proved. However, they speak so convincingly that inexperienced 
people find it difficult not to believe. 
  We have to learn this culture of discussions, arguments, and 
political debates. There should always be commitments during 
discussions. Without commitments the opposition will not be 
able to gain the stand and image to which it aspires. I really 
want to have an opposition, an opposition which can seriously 
argue with the majority or the authorities or whoever. But 
using correct arguments. If we all learn this we will have a 
real opposition. 
  As regards to troop deployment, we have two variants. One is 
being discussed at the moment. This is the deployment of 
international peace-keeping forces. It is not easy but outlines 
of a decision can already been seen. Or the other hand, there 
could be a completely Russian contingent. This will be easier 
to implement. Easier, because both President Yeltsin and I have 
given our consent to this in principle. 
  [Oniani] But not under the UN flag, only Russians ... 
  [Shevardnadze, interrupting] Certainly, only under the UN 
flag. And they support this idea. However, at the present 
stage, the issue of international troops is being discussed. 
These forces will include a certain number of Russian troops. 
They may comprise 20 percent or 30 percent maybe. I do not 
think it matters much. A few countries have applied to the 
United Nations expressing readiness to participate in the 
peace-keeping mission. I do not know how sufficient this will 
be. This must be elucidated. 
  [Oniani] We have to point out, Batono Eduard, that we speak 
of peace-keeping forces rather than the deployment of NATO 
troops in Georgia. 
  [Shevardnadze] Indeed. Perhaps some time later, when we sign 
certain documents and start cooperation with NATO, this issue 
will be topical. But I do hope we will need neither NATO troops 
nor Russian troops. However, NATO forces could take a definite 
part in our [word indistinct] 
  [Oniani] Soon a summit of the CIS countries will be held in 
Moscow. What can our country expect from this meeting regarding 
two problems most acute for us, I mean Abkhazia and our economy? 
  [Shevardnadze] I will not elaborate on this issue. In the 
coming two days I will probably speak to our listeners and TV 
viewers. At present, work is being done on documents sent by 
various countries. We have our opinion. A definition of a frame 
for economic cooperation will be the main issue under 
discussion. A scale and conditions for this will also be 
discussed. It is natural that issues of conflicts will be 
considered, as well. As I have said, a serious work is being 
done in all the ministries, agencies and the Cabinet of 
Ministers and soon I will be able to share my opinion with the 
listeners and TV viewers. 
  [Oniani] Batono Eduard, recent operations by the Interior 
Ministry, Defense Ministry, and Security Ministry have produced 
certain changes for the better. These are the first effects and 
maybe they cannot be well noticed by the population. We are 
coming closer to the establishment of order such as exists in 
our neighbour, Azerbaijan. 
  Last week, railway cars were blown up in Sadakhlo. On 9 
April 
a device was exploded on the premises of the SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA 
newspaper. Facts like these have accumulated. 
  [Shevardnadze] Everyone will obviously agree with me that 
order has improved a little. This is probably a result of a 
better implementation of a decree on this issue by the 
law-enforcement bodies. [words indistinct]. Now, the 
law-enforcement bodies have to turn their whole attention to 
revealing the crimes. Criminal cases like the explosion in 
Sadakhlo or the explosion in the SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA building 
must not be closed without investigation. I would like to voice 
my great hopes that the law-enforcement bodies will work 
efficiently on these cases. 
  In any case, the trend toward general improvement can be 
seen 
and all efforts should be directed toward establishing law and 
order in the country. These are real prospects today rather than 
those of the future. We have begun our work in this direction 
and will lead it to a conclusion. 
  [Oniani] Finally, five years have passed since the tragic 
day 
of 9 April. The 16th anniversary of the events that took place 
on 14 April 1978 will be marked this week. One is considered a 
day of national unity and the other is considered a day of the 
Georgian language. April seems to be eventful. 
  [Shevardnadze] I have a request in this connection. Any 
anniversary related to a sorrowful event is used by one part of 
the population only with one aim, I mean, not to allow the 
country to calm down, to have instability continued and to press 
the authorities to resign, as it was demanded on 9 April. Such 
a mood cannot receive a positive assessment. I sometimes wonder 
what these people want. Do they want good for the country and 
its unity or destruction? [passage indistinct]. 
  In this connection I would like to say that they will fail 
because Georgia is not and will never be what it used to be. 
The people will not follow dark forces and no one will take 
them to the dark and the mire.

  [Text] Sochi April 11 TASS -- "First the United Nations 
Security Council must adopt a resolution on the introduction of 
the peacekeeping force to the area along the line of 
confrontation between the Georgian and Abkhazian forces on the 
Inguri river, and only after the peacekeepers are stationed, the 
refugees can begin to return," said First Deputy Chairman of 
Abkhazia's Council of Ministers Leonid Likerbaya. 
  He was commenting in an interview with ITAR-TASS on the 
statement of the quadrilateral commission for the return of 
refugees and displaced persons to Abkhazia, which was signed in 
Sochi on April 9. 
  "We must make people understand that the process will be 
long. It may take several years," said Lakerbaya. He expressed 
confidence that it would do no good to try and artificially 
accelerate the process, which could only provoke new clashes and 
a new exacerbation of the situation. More, it is not ruled out 
that the introduction of peacekeeping forces can extend in time, 
leaving all decisions of the return of refugees "suspended in 
midair". 
  "There is no need to out the cart before the horse. Let 
documents be prepared thoroughly, so that they are fully ready 
by the time the U.N. Security Council passes the required 
resolution", Leonid Lakerbaya said.

<F P=106> [Report by Aleksey Aleksandrov: "Moscow As Guarantor of </F>
Stability in the Caucasus, or Why People at the Georgian Embassy 
Prefer a Swiss Bottle Opener to a Russian One"] 
  [Text] At last! That is the only way to react to the 
signing in Moscow of two agreements between Georgia and Abkhazia 
which have inspired hope, on both banks of the Inguri, of a 
long-awaited peace. 
  Eduard Bruner [name as transliterated], personal 
representative of the UN secretary general, particularly 
stressed the peacemaking efforts by Russian diplomacy, as a 
result of which a major step has been taken toward peace in an 
explosive region of the Caucasus. 
  A press conference was held on this topic at the Georgian 
Embassy in Moscow. The significance of the event was confirmed 
by the number of journalists, who virtually filled the 
conference hall at No. 6, Paliashvili. 
  Aleksandr Kavsadze, personal representative of the Georgian 
head of state and leader of Georgia's official delegation to the 
talks, noted at the press conference that the success of the 
Moscow meeting was determined largely by Sukhumi's flexible 
stance, and also by a compromise and a series of concessions by 
Tbilisi. 
  He stressed that the agreement on the return of refugees to 
Abkhazia is an amnesty for those who did fight but have laid 
down their arms and promised not to take them up again. 
However, according to Aleksandr Kavsadze, it does not apply to 
those who committed atrocities or acts of robbery and looting, 
or to those who are today entertaining plans to resume 
hostilities. 
  The view was also expressed at the press conference at the 
Georgian Embassy that those people -- in both Georgia and 
Abkhazia -- who are responsible for kindling a fratricidal civil 
war and who have profited by this dirty business, should suffer 
the criminal punishment they deserve. 
  The remarks at the press conference by Vakhtang 
Rcheuleshvili, vice speaker of the Georgian Supreme Council, 
struck me as original, to put it mildly. After demonstrating 
from the stage his unsuccessfull attempts to open a bottle of 
Borzhomi [Georgian mineral water] with a Russian bottle opener, 
he then, with one graceful movement, opened the bottle with a 
similar, but Swiss-made, tool. That is how it is at the talks, 
the vice speaker observed with irritation. And then he 
explained: All the agreements between Georgia and Abkhazia 
where Russia was present at the signing as intermediary, led to 
no positive results -- on the contrary, they culminated in 
bloody armed actions and military defeat for the Georgian side. 
But the participation of Swiss citizen Eduard Bruner, the UN 
secretary general's personal representative, in the Moscow talks 
produced, he said, the long-awaited success. To be fair, it 
must be noted that Mr. Rcheuleshvili, on failing to observe a 
rapturous reaction to this nice little "joke" among the Russian 
and foreign journalists present, did say, in conclusion, that 
the Georgian side is grateful to Russia for the attainment of 
the agreements.... 
  Thank you for that. We are long accustomed to see Russia's 
successful peace initiatives received with irritation outside 
Russia's borders. The recent success for Russian diplomacy in 
the Balkans is the most graphic illustration of this. Although 
it should be noted that not a word was said aloud about this. 
The artistic performance with the Borzhomi at No. 6, 
Paliashvili, and the unequivocal remarks by the vice speaker of 
the Georgian Supreme Council prompt the thought that some people 
in Tbilisi would prefer to see Western representatives at the 
talks in the role of peacemaker, rather than Russia. Here it 
must be noted that the opposition in the Georgian Supreme 
Council, according to recent reports from Tbilisi, greeted the 
signing of the peace agreements in a generally hostile fashion. 
  Being a peacemaker is certainly a thankless task: When two 
people are fighting, they are never happy with a third. 
However, I would like to point out to Mr. Rcheuleshvili that if 
aliens from another planet were to appear at the negotiating 
table in the role of intermediaries, even they could not act as 
unshakable guarantors of peace in the Caucasus. It all depends 
primarily on the two warring parties and their true desire to 
reach an agreement and a peace. 
  On the same day I met with Sergey Bagapsh, first deputy 
chairman of the Abkhaz Council of Ministers. He expressed 
satisfaction with the results of the Moscow talks and stressed 
the beneficial influence of Russian diplomacy in arriving at the 
two Georgian-Abkhaz agreements that have been signed. Without 
Russia's participation the CSCE and UN representatives could not 
have achieved this important task, he concluded. 
  For my part, let me note that I did not notice a Swiss 
bottle 
opener in the hands of the first vice premier of Abkhazia. Nor, 
incidentally, a bottle of Georgian Borzhomi.

<F P=106> [Article by Besik Urigashvili: "Expectations for Summer </F>
Vacation Season in Abkhazia Somewhat Premature Even in Light of 
Diplomatic Victories"] 
  [Text] Tbilisi -- The outbreak of optimistic forecasts 
brought about by the signing of the Georgian-Abkhazian 
agreements should not overshadow the real obstacles in the way 
of finally settling the conflict. Boris Pastukhov, personal 
representative of Russia's president and deputy foreign 
minister, believes that there may be a repeat of the Abkhazian 
tragedy unless resolute actions are taken by Russia and the 
United Nations. Other equally important elements should be 
considered in the current alignment of forces. 
  Despite the start of the summer vacation season in Abkhazia, 
which has been widely advertised by the mass media, every 
sensible person realizes that there will be no season. And the 
statement that sunworshippers on the beach at Pitsunda and tour 
buses on the road to Lake Ritsa will be protected by riflemen is 
simply laughable if, of course, you forget how much blood and 
tragedy is behind all this. 
  However, you cannot forget. Nor do the agreements that have 
been signed bring oblivion either. Whereas you can somehow 
understand naive working people nostalgic for the sunshine of 
Gagra, you cannot understand those who call themselves 
politicians. 
<H5>  Country Cornered </H5>
  A different -- gloomy and cheerless -- picture arises behind 
the glossy advertising mirage. Even a cursory analysis of the 
situation provides convincing evidence that a fresh bloodbath is 
inevitable if the peacemaking process breaks down once and for 
all (once again, you cannot forget that the agreements on 
Abkhazia have been wrecked six times). 
  Following Georgian leader Shevardnadze's recent visit to New 
York, where the Security Council, having given him a sympathetic 
hearing, effectively then refused to carry out a peacekeeping 
operation under its auspices in Abkhazia, the bulk of the 
Georgian public, primarily refugees from there, questioned the 
head of state's foreign policy course and his efforts to settle 
the conflict peacefully. 
  There is drama behind Shevardnadze's reserved response to 
the 
new agreements. "Unless we unravel the Abkhazian knot, our 
country has no future," that is the opinion of Nodar Natadze, 
Shevardnadze's political adversary, extremely radical leader of 
the Georgian People's Front, and a parliamentary deputy, an 
opinion shared by virtually all Georgian politicians and public 
figures today regardless of their views. 
  "The point is not only that Georgia has lost a considerable 
part of its age-old territory and living space," Givi Lominadze, 
former Abkhazian minister of internal affairs and now chairman 
of the Committee for the State of Emergency in Western Georgia, 
said. "If the Abkhazian problem is not settled, I have 
difficulty picturing a solution not only to the political but 
also primarily to the economic crisis. After all, the most 
convenient and virtually the only rail and road routes linking 
Georgia and Russia, routes that are crucial and vitally 
important, pass through Abkhazia. Everyone has now forgotten 
that it was the threat to these routes, a noose around Georgia's 
neck, that made it necessary to take emergency measures to 
protect them in August 1992. Separatist leaders in Abkhazia and 
their patrons in Russia used this as an excuse for war. Now 
that control of the routes has been lost we are threatened with 
being totally cut off." 
  According to statistics, the average wage in Georgia is 
around 20 U.S. cents. Notwithstanding what are virtually world 
prices for essentials, barring bread. The birth rate is falling 
disastrously. All industry is virtually at a standstill. 
People spent the whole of last winter without heat and light. 
The crime rate is still threateningly high. And as a result in 
the last six months alone, according to various estimates, 
between 500,000 and 800,000 people, over one-third of them 
ethnic Georgians, moreover, have left the country. Some 99 
percent of the emigres, regardless of ethnic origin, are not 
leaving the country on political grounds. 
  Mafia clans are infiltrating top state spheres. According to 
Igor Georgadze, head of the Georgian security service, the drugs 
mafia has stepped up its activity of late. 
  "We have information from which it emerges that Georgia is 
already one of the main transit routes for the international 
drugs mafia. Drugs going West via Georgia mainly come from 
Azerbaijan, Central Asia, and the North Caucasus. Severe 
pressure from local clans, which often operate via structures of 
authority, and, paradoxically enough, the conflict in Abkhazia, 
which diverts our best forces, are preventing us from 
effectively resisting this. Deprived of firm foundations the 
authorities are sometimes forced to close their eyes to the 
human detritus in their corridors where incompetence goes hand 
in hand with unscrupulousness." 
<H5>  On the Other Side of the Inguri River </H5>
  The way is barred to your correspondent. However, the way is 
not barred to information crossing the Inguri River via informal 
communications channels, the press, and eyewitnesses who 
disagree with the Gudauta regime. 
  The simple formula of "the Abkhazian people's great victory 
over the Georgian aggressor" prevails in the mass consciousness 
there today, acting as an ideological foundation for mass purges 
and the deportation of the Georgian people. However, the 
euphoria of victory is giving way increasingly noticeably to a 
sobering up process. North Caucasus "volunteers" are demanding 
payment -- homes, apartments, plots of land. Their demands are 
being bolstered by weapons. Banditry, robbery, and looting -- 
the accompaniments of "victory" -- are keeping pace with the 
exacerbating struggle for power between family and mafia 
structures. 
  Winning the war and relying on powerful allies outside 
Abkhazia enable Vladislav Ardzinba to take a politically radical 
and uncompromising approach. However, his Abkhazian opponents 
believe that this policy is fatal for the Abkhazian people. 
  One of them, who once held a fairly high position in the 
Abkhazian political establishment, told me: 
  "He is bound to realize that this is a Pyrrhic victory but, 
being a charismatic leader, he is continuing to sail on the tide 
of events. However, in the course of the war the Abkhazians 
have already lost over one-third of their gene pool. A people 
numbering just 80,000 is threatened with physical degeneration. 
Moreover it is clear that Georgia will never put up with the 
loss of Abkhazia." 
  In the opinion of my interlocutor, a crucial factor in the 
Abkhazian military success is the domestic political situation 
in Russia and in Georgia itself at the time the conflict started. 
  "Were it not for Gamsakhurdia and Russia's equivocal policy, 
I don't know how it all would have ended," he said. 
  Nevertheless Ardzinba still has firm support -- the enemy 
image in the shape of Georgia completely holds sway in the mass 
consciousness. However, Abkhazia's leaders, perfectly well 
aware of the danger they are in, are trying to take preventive 
security measures. This is illustrated by the escalation of 
military operations in Abkhazia's Svanetia at the end of March. 
  This operation, which Abkhazian sources themselves admit was 
planned in advance, was allegedly aimed against Georgian 
subversive groups. However, it is well known that the current 
Abkhazian leadership is holding talks with regard to driving a 
six-kilometer road tunnel to directly link Abkhazia and the 
North Caucasus. With its commissioning Abkhazia would obtain a 
direct outlet to the North Caucasus bypassing Krasnodar Kray. 
One small point is causing problems however: This route lies 
through villages in the Kodorskoye Gorge where the Svanetians 
live and which are controlled by their people's militia. 
  After the agreement was signed 4 April, these people 
communicated the following from their positions: "Are we now 
outlawed then? Are we, the defenders of our own homes and 
villages, not entitled to live in our own homeland?" -- these 
questions in one form or another are being asked by virtually 
all refugees, most of whom have taken part in the fighting and 
very many of whom have died. 
<H5>  Another War? </H5>
  Imagine a crowd of thousands of refugees among whom amputees 
predominate. Shaking their arm stumps they are yelling: "We 
have all fought! Fought for our land! Who is not allowing us 
to go home?" In the opinion of these people, and you cannot 
help but take it into account, the agreements signed in Moscow 
do not resolve the problem of a peace settlement in Abkhazia. 
And the vaguer the prospects of such a settlement, the stronger 
the militarist sentiments. The most radical section of the 
refugees from Abkhazia has formed the Abkhazian Liberation 
Union. Its leader Boris Kakubava believes: 
  "Neither the United Nations nor Russia nor the Lord are 
helping us. I do not know of a single case of territory being 
returned by means of talks. We have one option -- to get our 
homes back with weapons in hand." 
  Needless to say, by no means everyone hews to such radical 
positions, but there is tremendous skepticism regarding the 
chance of resolving the problem through talks. And although the 
most farsighted politicians are still banking on Russia, the 
following view does prevail: Until the political squabbling in 
Russia has subsided, one should not expect salvation. 
Ultimately, many people think that the Abkhazian problem will 
be resolved as Russia wants. 
  A great deal was done in Moscow to ensure that talks resumed 
between the Georgians and Abkhazians. "Some kind of progress at 
least" has been made thanks to Russia's efforts. Staggering 
progress in terms of the negotiating table. But it looks 
extremely shaky in the eyes of yesterday's shepherds and tea 
growers, unwilling war veterans, whose road home is barred today.

<F P=106> [Studio interview with Eduard Shevardnadze, Georgian head of </F>
state, chaired by Andrey Skryabin; from the "Live Dialogue" 
program; Shevardnadze participates from the Tbilisi studio -- 
live] 
  [Excerpts] [Skryabin] Good day, esteemed television 
viewers, today's TV hook-up in the Live Dialogue program links 
Tbilisi with the Ostankino studio. Eduard Amvrosiyevich 
Shevardnadze, Georgian head of state, is there in the Georgian 
capital. Good day, Eduard Amvrosiyevich! 
  [Shevardnadze] Good day! 
  [Skryabin] Taking part in our program today are Lyudmila 
Telen, MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI observer, and Givi Bakradze, Georgian 
television journalist, and I am Andrey Skryabin, Ostankino 
television observer. [passage omitted) 
  Permit me again to welcome Eduard Amvrosiyevich 
Shevardnadze, 
the head of state of the Republic of Georgia, and -- can you 
hear us, Tbilisi? It seems that we do not yet have 
communication with Tbilisi. [passage omitted] 
  [Bakradze, speaking from Tbilisi studio] Andrey 
Georgiyevich! 
  [Skryabin] Yes, I am here. 
  [Bakradze] We have had some problems with the sound. We are 
now informed that it is ready for use. 
  [Skryabin] Let us then get started immediately. In the six 
months that have elapsed since the time of our last meeting, 
Eduard Amvrosiyevich, there have been many changes. If you 
please, what is your assessment of the political and 
socio-economic situation in Georgia? 
  [Shevardnadze] Thank you very much. My greetings to you, 
Andrey Georgiyevich and Lyudmila Olegovna. We are already old 
partners. The political situation at the present stage in 
Georgia is complex, but since our last meeting I can confirm 
that it has to some extent been improving. At least the main 
threat that the country was facing, the threat of an unleashing 
of civil war -- and in effect we were on the verge of civil war 
-- has been removed. It is now possible to speak of some 
healthy trends in political life and a certain consolidation of 
Georgian society. It is possible to speak of some positive 
trends, including an improvement in the crime situation. There 
are also some other encouraging trends. However, as far as the 
economy is concerned -- and it impossible to divorce the economy 
from politics -- the economy remains in a state of profound 
crisis. We have had a severe winter and have remained in effect 
at a minimum level of fuel and energy resources. Industrial 
enterprises and agricultural organizations have not in effect 
been functioning. For this reason the social situation of 
people is very burdensome and in this respect it is possible to 
speak about great social tension, although despite the hunger, 
so to speak, and the cold, people are nevertheless showing 
understanding regarding the problems now being faced by our 
country. 
  [Skryabin] Thank you very much. Let us have your question, 
Givi. 
  [Bakradze] Eduard Amvrosiyevich, as far as I see it, my 
counterparts in Moscow are mostly interested in politics. I 
would say that we in Georgia are also interested in the economy. 
Recently we had strikes by rail workers and metro drivers. 
They were brought about, let us be frank, by the calamitous 
situation of people. It is at the present time practically 
impossible to buy anything with coupons. Other sections of the 
population, including the budget- funded workers, are in a 
similar position. Could you tell us, please, whether the state 
and the republic's leadership are planning any measures of 
social protection in the near future? 
  [Shevardnadze] One can speak of some measures, 
inconsiderable 
ones at ths stage, since the resources of the state are 
exhausted. It is true that an almost total devaluation of the 
coupon has taken place. Unfortunately, when we introduced these 
coupons, we stated at the time that it was a forced measure and 
that there was no other solution. In effect we had not through 
our own wish left the rouble zone. This was, so to speak, at 
the start of last year. Therefore one obviously cannot at 
present speak seriously about a sharp improvement in living 
standards. Therefore in respect these strikes by the rail 
workers and metro workers and in respect of the discussion in 
metallurgical labor collectives of the possible calling of a 
strike, I think that one cannot solve problems by striking. 
When we explain all this to the people, I must say that people 
are showing understanding and are starting to realize what the 
present-day state can provide and what it cannot. 
  Therefore, literally two or three days after our contacts 
with the railway and subway workers, the strikers went back to 
work and that enterprise is now operational. 
  [Skryabin] Thank you. Over to you. 
  [Telen] Mr. Shevardnadze, unfortunately we haven't had any 
communication with Tbilisi yet. Andrey Skryabin and I have 
spoken a lot about an understanding being signed recently on 
settling conflicts between Abkhazia and Georgia with the 
participation of Russia and the UN. This is really one of the 
most acute themes concerning people, not just in Georgia but in 
Russia and other CIS republics. In a Russian television 
interview you said that this was the result -- I'm not quoting 
it exactly of course, but the sense of it was this -- that this 
was the result of concessions both by the Abkhaz and Georgian 
sides. Tell me, please, where do the limits of possible 
concessions, and of compromises generally lie, for it is known, 
your political opponents have accused you already of making 
unilateral concessions to the Abkhaz side? 
  [Shevardnadze] There have been many reproaches and 
accusations. The debates in the parliament of Georgia during 
which literally all the theses and clauses of the agreement 
reached in Moscow were discussed were rather stormy. But we 
must be realists and, in the end, the members of parliament came 
to understand that there was no other solution. There are two 
ways of resolving the issue: either a military solution, which 
is unacceptable to us, to the Abkhaz people, and to the world 
community -- if you want to put things in a wider context, and 
for Russia, too, that would be the most undesirable option; but 
there is also the peaceful way -- it is difficult, complex, but 
the only true and right path. It seems to me that the 
understanding, the documents which were signed in Moscow, meet 
the interests of both sides, both the Abkhaz and the Georgian 
side to a certain extent. It's true that it's not ideal -- from 
the point of view of Georgia's state interests -- but one must 
bear in mind that it is just the first stage of a solution, a 
peaceful solution with the involvement, the mediation of Russia, 
the United Nations Organization and practically all members of 
the Security Council. It seems to me that if we, all those 
participating in that process of reconciliation continue to 
display enough will and persistence, then in the end, one will 
be able to speak of the establishment of peace in Abkhazia and 
in Georgia as a whole. 
  [Skryabin] Thank you. Eduard Amvrosiyevich, I have already 
received a large number of questions from television viewers. 
[passage omitted on towns and cities from which questions have 
come in] The gist of these questions is connected with quite a 
specific thing - connected with the Georgian-Abkhaz documents 
which were adopted - questions such as: Who will decide who can 
return? The present leadership of Abkhazia? A quadripartite 
commission? Who will decide this question? 
  [Shevardnadze] This is a key question of the settlement. I 
have to say that after these documents were signed in Moscow, a 
commission sat yesterday... [pauses] the day before 
yesterday... [pauses] no yesterday, on the problems of the 
return of refugees to Sochi, and an understanding was reached in 
principle that a special commission would be set up in which the 
parties to the conflict would participate -- the Georgian side; 
the Abkhaz side; and naturally, the Council of Europe 
commission; the Russian side; the United Nations Organization, 
in particular the Commission on Refugees will also participate, 
so -- the CSCE, representatives of the CSCE will be present as 
observers -- so that this quadripartite commission should draw 
up and determine the terms for an unconditional, safe and 
dignified return of the refugees. 
  There are some restrictions on a small number of people - we 
will probably work that out together -- but the main bulk should 
return. So, this commission now exists, and yesterday, the day 
before yesterday it set about real work. 
  [Telen] Mr. Shevardnadze, these documents mention 
peacekeeping forces to be used in settling the conflict. Could 
you tell us whether this means the use of the Russian contingent 
alone, or is it possible that other countries will be involved? 
  [Shevardnadze] There are various options. So far, at this 
stage, we've been discussing the question of using international 
peacekeeping forces. This means representatives from various 
countries' armed forces, naturally including Russia. What the 
proportion will be, whether the Russians will constitute 20, 30, 
or 50 percent, will probably be determined at a sitting of the 
Security Council. We would like Russia to participate very 
actively and, as it were, impressively in the peace process, 
with the necessary involvement of its armed forces, just as it 
participated in the talks. [passage omitted] 
  [Bakradze] I'd like to ask about the sorest point. Do you 
think, Eduard Amvrosiyevich, that it will be possible to restore 
a demographic status quo ante in Abkhazia? 
  [Shevardnadze] Well, it's probably hard to say right now. 
But when we said that the commission, the Security Council, the 
peacekeeping forces and naturally Russia too have to ensure safe 
and dignified return of the bulk of the refugees, naturally this 
meant that the demographic situation has to be restored. 
  [Bakradze] But isn't it the case that newcomers, fighters, 
mercenaries, are now living in the homes of the refugees? What 
will they do? Will they stay or will they go? After all, it's 
crucial. 
  [Shevardnadze] Well, I think that after all there aren't 
that 
many of them. At least the Abkhaz leadership has issued 
repeated statements to the effect that there are relatively few 
of them. That's the first point. The second point is that the 
documents we signed with Russia, both in Moscow and in Sochi -- 
we actually signed documents of that nature three times -- in 
principle they are still valid. Russia undertook certain 
responsibility to ensure that the fighters and those who had 
settled unlawfully would help both Abkhazia and Georgia, in the 
sense that they have to be driven out of Abkhazia. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Shevardnadze] This quadrilateral commission, which is to 
deal with the problems of the return of the refugees, will 
discuss all those specific problems. At present it is very hard 
to say what the decision will be regarding a particular family 
and a particular flat. But all these problems have to be 
resolved in the work of this commission. 
  [Telen] Eduard Amvrosiyevich, during our last "Live 
Dialogue" 
we discussed plans for a federal structure in Georgia, and we 
recalled that a draft constitution was being prepared. At the 
time you said it was too early to speak about a federal 
structure in Georgia, but the issue would be resolved in the 
process of drafting the constitution and in the subsequent 
nationwide referendum on this draft. I remember that you said 
then the text of the draft would be ready by December. Could 
you tell us how things stand now? Is the text of the 
constitution ready, or have some problems arisen that prevent it 
from being brought to a stage when it is ready in a preliminary 
form? 
  [Shevardnadze] In principle, as far as the draft 
constitution 
is concerned, the constitutional commission has prepared such a 
draft. But we are at present in no hurry to submit it to be 
examined in parliament, let alone to a referendum. This is 
because in the framework of the peace process -- I mean with 
regard to Abkhaz settlement, and there are also problems with 
the Tskhinvali zone, I mean the former South Ossetia region -- 
appropriate formats for conducting talks have been defined. 
  In particular, a special meeting of the working group will 
be held in Geneva on 19 April to deal with problems related to 
Abkhazia's political status, that is, this problem has been 
internationalized, too, in fact. The same process is likely to 
cover the problems of the Tskhinvali zone, the former South 
Ossetian autonomous oblast. So in my view it would not be very 
sensible to rush things now with adopting the constitution. The 
political status ought to be defined, in principle; I have in 
mind Abkhazian autonomy, or maybe there will be a different name 
for it, and only then should a comprehensive decision be adopted 
on the constitution, on the state and territorial structure of 
the Georgian State. [passage omitted] 
  [Skryabin] I have a question, too. I have here a document, a 
statement on measures for political settlement to the 
Georgian-Abkhazian conflict. Its Clause 6 says: Abkhazia has 
its own constitution and legislation and appropriate state 
symbols - an anthem, a coat of arms, and a flag. I wonder, it 
does not mention anywhere that Abkhazia is part of Georgia. 
Could it be that this wording in the statement lays down a 
future independent sovereign state of Abkhazia with the same 
rights as Georgia, as it were. Do you understand the question? 
  [Shevardnadze] Yes I do. I have been asked similar questions 
in the parliament and in public discussions of the document more 
than once. It should be borne in mind that this is an initial 
stage of political settlement, so all problems and issues, 
naturally, could not be included in the document. The most 
important thing here was to attain a certain degree of progress 
at the talks. Our delegations have agreed to put off the 
problems which are causing controversy and on which we have not 
yet come to full understanding; they will be discussed at the 
next stage. As regards our idea of Abkhazia's political status, 
I said at a meeting of the Security Council that the Georgian 
leadership and our state on the whole is prepared to solve this 
problem in accordance with the highest international and 
European standards. Maybe it will be an autonomy or have 
another name. 
  In essence, I stress, we will solve this problem and we will 
do all we can to resolve the problem, taking into account the 
most up-to-date European and international requirements. As 
regards territorial integrity, we did not insist now that 
Abkhazia is a part of the Georgian state, we did not insist on 
including this clause, this provision because, naturally, we 
imply that Abkhazia is a constituent part of the Georgian state. 
One should keep in mind that all the document which we signed 
in Moscow with Abkhazia's participation and in Sochi and the six 
or even seven resolutions by the Security Council which have 
been adopted recently state that Abkhazia is an integral part of 
the Georgian state. 
  I believe therefore that at the current stage there was no 
pressing need to stress this once again. We imply that there 
can be no other decision. 
  [Skryabin] Esteemed colleagues, if you don't mind, I think 
that the topic of Abkhazia has been pretty much exhausted. Let's 
move on to the topic of Russian-Georgian relations. In this 
respect I want to ask Eduard Amvrosiyevich what, in real terms, 
has changed in these relations since the signing of the major 
interstate treaty? 
  [Shevardnadze] At present it is probably difficult to speak 
of real changes inasmuch as not so much time has passed since 
the signing. What has changed is that the treaties have in fact 
been signed. That's the main thing, and at present we are not 
speaking of stagnation in our relations as it were. We are 
speaking of it being necessary to renew and to revive all that 
was best as it were and the traditions in the sphere of the 
economy, politics, culture, science and so on, in all spheres, 
which we built over the decades and centuries. 
  To be more specific, in principles such talks are already 
being conducted at governmental level. Many interim 
understandings, as it were, have been prepared, interim treaties 
and agreements in part of the economy by sector. Naturally we 
won't get an immediate return so to speak, but the main thing is 
that the contractual and legal basis already exists for the 
development of our relations, and for the construction of new 
relations between the two states, and that we have commenced 
practical work. 
  [Skryabin] It may be said that gradually the work ... 
  [Shevardnadze, interrupting] Work, gradual work is under 
way. 
  [Telen] Mr. Shevardnadze, I would like to return to the step 
taken by Georgia in joining the CIS. Several months have 
elapsed since that time. Tell us please, has this step 
justified the hopes, or do you have any dissatisfaction with 
Georgia's position in the CIS, and in general with the 
cooperation between republics within the framework of the CIS. 
  [Shevardnadze] Perhaps I will rephrase your question. It 
would probably be correct to put the question this way: are the 
hopes which we had, as it were, being justified? I think yes. 
  But if we have not immediately received a return, then I 
have 
to say that there really is a certain disappointment among the 
people, when people are in need, when people are starving so to 
speak, and much else, and naturally they want there to be a 
quick effect. So far we have not had such an effect, but one 
has to bear in mind that this very unification, the commonwealth 
itself, is not yet so firm, I would even say stable. 
  So we all, members of this commonwealth, have to make 
efforts 
to make it more effective - and for it influence the situation 
in all the states which joined this commonwealth more 
effectively and at a faster pace. 
  [Telen] And one further question directly linked with this. 
What is your attitude to the initiative of Nursultan Nazarbayev 
on creating a union of Eurasian states? 
  [Shevardnadze] You know, I am aware of many initiatives by 
President Nazarbayev. I was in Kazakhstan and we held very 
interesting and substantive talks. This was several months ago, 
and Nursultan Abishevich never mentioned this idea in principle. 
  I think that this is a very interesting idea which deserves 
attention. But at present it is on the level of an idea, and 
for this reason it is difficult to answer immediately as it 
were, without serious discussion, inasmuch as the idea in itself 
is progressive and interesting - the formation of a new Eurasian 
economic or even monetary space as it were and so on - all this 
is very promising. But for me to give a specific answer to 
these questions I think that dialogue is necessary, and a 
meeting is necessary with the author of this proposal and with 
other colleagues who are currently members of the Commonwealth 
if Independent States. 
  [Skryabin] Many thanks. Eduard Amvrosiyevich, may I ask 
another question which is perhaps not easy for you. Here it 
is. In your country, Georgia, the opposition consider you to be 
a person of a pro-Russian bent. In our country, in Russia, a 
certain section of Russian people feel that you are a person of 
a nationalist bent. Tell me, what sort of person do you consider 
yourself? 
  [Shevardnadze] Let me just add, in Russia many think I am 
pro-Western or something of that kind. I have always wanted to 
be a politician thinking in realistic terms. I want, and it is 
my dream, to build good, friendly, new relations with the great 
Russia. I have always looked for friends both in the West or in 
the East - a small country cannot exist otherwise; and the same 
is even more true of a leader of a small country such as 
Georgia. We must look for friends - look for them and find them 
all over the world. And naturally, we must seek them first and 
foremost among our close neighbors, we must seek friends in 
Russia and in other states. [passage omitted] 
  [Bakradze] Eduard Amvrosiyevich, during your visit to the 
United States you included in your itinerary a meeting with Ivan 
Rybkin, chairman of the State Duma of the Russian parliament. 
Was this a chance meeting or does this to a certain extent 
reflect your position with regard to the Russian parliament? 
  [Shevardnadze] You know, it was both accidental and 
deliberate - because Ivan Petrovich Rybkin was in Washington. 
It was at his initiative and he thought it necessary to have a 
meeting with me. I was very glad to speak to him because this 
conversation took place in an extremely constructive and warm 
atmosphere. I think we built quite a good foundation for 
cooperation between our parliaments. I had not known him before 
and he produced a very good and pleasant impression on me. This 
is the first point. And second, I would even say there was 
something symbolic in the fact that our meeting took place in 
Washington. Since you mentioned my visit, I know that reactions 
to it have not been unequivocal in some circles both in Russia 
and in Georgia. The theme of all my speeches and all the 
conversations I had there was this: that in the present 
conditions a revival or recurrence of the cold war was 
inadmissible, or of any kind of confrontation between the West 
and East, any confrontation between Russia and the United 
States. Ivan Petrovich Rybkin and I discussed this theme, and I 
also discussed this with the Administration and with President 
Clinton, I talked on this subject in my public addresses in the 
Congress and the Senate. 
  [Skryabin] Thank you. Eduard Amvrosiyevich, a propos your 
visit to the United States. We know that you paid considerable 
attention to the need for support by the West for democratic 
reforms in Russia. You had conversations on this topic. What 
conclusions did you draw from your talks with senators and 
congressmen? 
  [Shevardnadze] I spoke mainly about the need for support for 
Georgia, for democratic transformations inside Georgia. But 
since the subject of Russian-U.S. relations is very topical at 
the moment, perhaps the most important topic at the present 
stage, of course I said that the West should continue its 
current policy of supporting reforms and large-scale, 
deep-going, global transformations in Russia which your country 
has started now. And I must say that in this respect my 
comments have always been met with understanding by my U.S. 
partners and interlocutors.

<F P=106> [Address "To the Peoples, Political Parties, Parliaments, </F>
Governments, and Heads of States of the Former USSR" from the 
Political Council of the Social-Democratic Party of Georgia; 
place and date not given: "CIS -- A Eurasian Community?"] 
  [Text] As has become known to SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA, the 
Political Council of the Social-Democratic Party of Georgia has 
adopted an address to the states of the former USSR in which it 
proves the necessity of transforming the CIS into a "more solid" 
association -- the Eurasian Community. As can be seen, Georgia 
wants also here to be in the vanguard of political 
processes. We present the text of the document to our 
readers. 
  The former USSR represented a communist empire in which the 
rights of all peoples, including the Russians, were restricted. 
The peoples of the former Soviet Union should have been 
liberated not by means of the collapse of the former USSR but by 
its evolutionary transformation into a democratic community of 
independent states. 
  Unfortunately, this did not take place. This time as well, 
the struggle for power overshadowed general state interests. 
Politicians and the bodies of state power bear personal 
responsibility for the consequences of the spontaneous 
disintegration of the former USSR. 
  As regards the CIS, it does not properly reflect the level 
of 
actual integration of the states of the former USSR. Therefore, 
the CIS must gradually transform itself into a more solid 
association -- the Eurasian Community (EC). The mechanism for 
its formation could include the achievement of the following 
agreements by the subjects of the former USSR: 
  1. The CIS member states will change the name of the CIS to 
the Eurasian Community (EC) by adopting the corresponding 
declaration. 
  2. In order to coordinate external, economic, and defense 
policy, the EC member states will conclude treaties on a 
diplomatic, economic, and defense union. 
  3. The treaty on a diplomatic union will strengthen the 
mechanism of coordinating international policy, while preserving 
the rights of all the EC member states to participate 
independently in international organizations, conclude 
international treaties, and establish diplomatic and other 
relations with foreign states. 
  4. The treaty on an economic union will strengthen the 
formation of a common market, the diversity and equality of all 
forms of ownership, and the implementation of an economic policy 
also in the financial, transport, power engineering, and 
information spheres. A common currency for all EC member states 
will be introduced and a banking union will be created. 
  5. The defense union will be built according to the 
principles of defense sufficiency. Strategic forces and border 
troops organized on a professional basis will form the EC's 
common armed forces. 
  6. Taking into account the multiethnic nature of the EC 
states, a council for interethnic relations will be formed. 
  7. The Eurasian Parliament (similar to the European 
Parliament) and the Council of the Heads of EC States will form 
the supreme governing bodies of the EC. 
  8. The Eurasian Parliament will approve the EC 
president-coordinator, [who will be appointed] in turn from the 
members of the Council of the Heads of States for a one-year 
term, and also appoint the presidents of the EC Diplomatic 
Union, Defense Union, and Union for Interethnic Relations 
according to the principle of equal representation from each EC 
member state. 
  A court of arbitration and a consultative socioeconomic and 
ecological council and a fund for the elimination of the 
consequences of natural disasters and catastrophes will be 
created in the community. 
  These bodies will form boards according to the principle of 
equal representation from each EC member state and will have an 
apparatus formed on a professional basis. 
  9. The EC's governing structures will be financed on a 
coordinated basis. 
  10. The Eurasian Community will be open to new members. 
  The transformation of the CIS into the Eurasian Community 
will help all the states of the former USSR to unite, states 
which, in the course of their mutual interconnection over many 
centuries, have elaborated a common system of valuable 
orientations. 
  We express the hope that the peoples, political parties, 
parliaments, and governments and heads of states of the former 
USSR will view our address with understanding and will undertake 
effective steps to elaborate rules for living together in the 
Eurasian Community that will be acceptable to each state. 
  The Political Council of the Social-Democratic Party of 
Georgia

<F P=106> [Report by Besik Urigashvili: "Bombers' Games in Tbilisi"] </F>
  [Text] Tbilisi -- The terrorists continued their bloody 
games 9 April when all Georgia was honoring the memory of the 
people who died on that day five years ago when Soviet troops 
broke up a peaceful rally. 
  Early in the morning three people died at Sadakhlo Station 
on 
the Armenian border when a bomb planted under a Tbilisi-Yerevan 
passenger train exploded, and a few hours later an explosion 
rang out at the SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA editorial building, which 
also houses the IZVESTIYA office. This time fortunately there 
were no casualties, but I would like to go into this in a bit 
more detail. 
  Toward around 1300 hours, when a procession of excited 
supporters of ex-president Zviad Gamsakhurdia was moving down 
Rustaveli Boulevard, Besik Tskhoroguzli, a colleague of mine 
from SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA, and I decided to watch the 
demonstration from his office balcony, which directly overlooked 
the boulevard. 
  About 10-15 minutes later when the crowd of demonstrators 
had 
almost passed our observation post we heard the creak of a door 
opening and almost immediately a sound like the crack of a 
starting pistol. We immediately dashed into the room but at 
that moment we were deafened by a powerful explosion. We were 
thrown back onto the balcony by the force of the blast and 
covered with fragments of glass. When we came to our senses 
some time later and went into the room thick smoke was pouring 
from a sofa by the entrance to the balcony and plaster was 
falling from the ceiling. 
  Police and security personnel appeared on the scene in a 
matter of minutes. The surprise came later. On arrival the 
officers feverishly inspected the room but, instead of taking 
any action to seal off the exits from the building, began 
hysterically cross-examining us while we were still in a state 
of shock from the explosion. And each of them, moreover, 
confidently came up with his own version of events without 
taking any notice of our testimony. It was only at the end a 
few hours later, when Georgiy Shalutashvili, an investigator 
from the security service's investigation department, who 
listened to us fairly attentively, took over the case, that he 
said. "You were lucky, had the grenade not landed on the sofa 
you would have been done for."

  [Text] Kiev, 11 April -- Reports by the Black Sea Fleet 
press center on the course of events in Odessa on 10 April 
accuse Ukraine of an armed attack on Garrison 318 of a fleet 
division belonging to the Black Sea Fleet conservation which, as 
the Black Sea Fleet press center stresses, was in the "best 
traditions of the SS Galicia division." 
  The press service of Ukraine's Defense Ministry states that 
the reports of the Black Sea Fleet are a provocation and an 
outrageous lie. There was no "attack" in Odessa. In reality, a 
group of officers was detained: Oleg Feoktistov, Dmitriy 
Starikov, and Aleksandr Zelenko, but they were detained for 
unlawful actions during an incident concerning the piratical 
seizure from Odessa of valuable navigational equipment on 9 
April by the Black Sea Fleet hydrographic vessel Cheleken. 
Apart from refusing to heed an order from a senior naval 
officer, the abovementioned officers called on their 
subordinates, who had arrived on board the Cheleken, to "aim 
their weapons at the Ukrainian seamen; to prepare to fire; and 
to fire at will." The statement from the Ukrainian Ministry of 
Defense press center states that such actions by the officers 
led to the emergence of a real threat to the security in the 
port of Odessa. 
  The actions of the command of Garrison 318 were directed at 
provoking an armed conflict between the servicemen of the Black 
Sea Fleet and officials of the port of Odessa, the border 
guards, and the personnel of the Ukrainian Navy. Officials of 
the Ukrainian Defense Ministry and law enforcement bodies are 
investigating the circumstances of the incident, which could 
have caused the deaths of the personnel. All the actions are 
taking place in accordance with the current legislation of 
Ukraine. There were no cases of violence in relation to the 
division's personnel and none whatsoever in relation to members 
of their families. 
  The statement says that there is no doubt that it was a 
planned provocation aimed not only at seizing valuable equipment 
but also designed to disregard Ukrainian laws. The press 
service of Ukraine's Ministry of Defense categorically rejects 
the untrue information that is being circulated by Russian mass 
media. Not only does it not conform to reality, but it also 
undermines trust and sows hostility between the friendly peoples 
of neighboring countries. Ukraine has proposed that Russia's 
Ministries of Defense and Foreign Affairs send their 
representatives to take part in investigating the incident.

Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskyy; edited by Vladimir 
Shishlin] 
  [Text] As INTERFAX has learned from a well-placed source in 
Kiev, Ukraine's President Leonid Kravchuk had a telephone 
conversation with Russia's Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin on 
Monday. The two leaders discussed an incident, involving an 
attack by Ukrainian special troops on an Odessa-based division 
of Black Sea Fleet ships put into reserve and the arrest of 
three naval officers. (INTERFAX Note: As the Black Sea Fleet's 
Spokesman Andrey Grachev has reported to Interfax, about 120 
Ukrainian servicemen assaulted Odessa's division of Black Sea 
Fleet ships on Sunday. They arrested the Division Commander, 
Captain First Class Oleg Feoktistov, the Coast Base Commander, 
Captain Second Class Dmitry Starikov, and the Division's Chief 
of Staff, Captain Second Class Aleksandr Zelenk. These officers 
were hand cuffed and have been held in custody without any 
charge. The other servicemen and their families have been 
locked in their compound by special forces.) 
  Although a Russian government spokesman has confirmed 
Chernomyrdin's telephone conversation with Kravchuk, he has 
declined to divulge its substance. 
  Meanwhile, the Russian cabinet has resolutely protested to 
Ukraine's government at the latest attack and the previous use 
of force against the Black Sea Fleet's ship "Cheleken" at Odessa. 
  It released a statement in Moscow on Monday, describing 
Kiev's actions as a crude violation of the agreements reached by 
the presidents of the two countries to refrain from one-sided 
actions toward the Black Sea Navy and respect all bilateral 
accords. The document also says that the actions trampled upon 
the international law and human rights and were undoubtedly 
deliberate. 
  The Russian Government demanded that the servicemen and 
members of their families be set free immediately, the rules on 
naval facilities that existed before the provocation be restored 
without delay, an investigation be conducted, and all necessary 
measures be applied to those who are to blame. The Russian 
Government stressed that Moscow had always sought to promote 
friendship and cooperation with Kiev. 
  The Duma Council on Monday asked Ivan Rybkin, the chairman 
of 
the Russian parliament's lower house, to send Kravchuk a cable 
concerning the seizure of Russian ships in Odessa. In an 
interview with INTERFAX, a Duma member Sergey Shakhray, a deputy 
premier has blamed the incident on the absence of operational 
procedures for Russia and Ukraine in regard to the Black Sea 
Fleet. (INTERFAX Note: President Kravchuk has described the 
Massandra accords on the Black Sea Navy (on its transfer to 
Russia) as a protocol rather than a decision. No one has 
revoked the fleet-sharing agreements reached in Yalta and 
Zavidovo, Kravchuk declared.)

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspsondent Yefim Shvartsman] </F>
  [Text] Odessa 11 April, TASS -- The Ukrainian defence 
minister issued an order to reorganise the beleaguered 318th 
Division of the Black Sea Fleet into a unit of the Ukrainian 
Navy. 
  The move followed the incident that involved a Black Sea 
Fleet research ship, Cheleken, which on the night of 9 April 
sailed to Sevastopol with the division's Mars radar system 
aboard in spite of the prohibitions issued by the Odessa navy 
authorities. 
  The ship refused to produce transportation documents. 
Vyacheslav Voronkov, head of the press centre of the Odessa 
Military District, said the Ukrainian side is likely to 
institute legal proceedings. Three division senior officers -- 
Division Commander Oleg Feoktistov, Chief of Staff Aleksandr 
Zelenko and Logistics Officer Dmitriy Starikov -- were taken to 
the Odessa military prosecutor on the night of 11 April, but 
were released after questioning. Voronkov failed to explain why 
they were summoned to the prosecutor's office at night and could 
not say where they are now since none of them could be reached 
either at home or at work. 
  The division's personnel were offered to take the Ukrainian 
military oath of allegiance on Monday morning or quit army 
service. So far about 50 officers have agreed to switch sides. 
The press centre of the Odessa Military District said that 
about 75-80 per cent of the division's officers and warrant 
officers are ready to take the Ukrainian oath of allegiance. 
  The Ukrainian Defence Ministry called on the Russian foreign 
and defence ministries to send representatives to Ukraine to 
settle the conflict, Ukrainian television said.

  [Text] Our correspondent Yevgeniy Novikov was told by the 
Black Sea Fleet's press center that as a result of talks between 
representatives of the fleet command and Ukraine's naval forces, 
the arrested Russian officers and civilians were released 
yesterday evening. They were seized by Ukrainian special 
purpose troops at the fleet's reserve division near Odessa. 
However, the division remains under the control of 60 Ukrainian 
special purpose commandos who are preventing representatives of 
the Black Sea Fleet command from approaching the division's most 
important facilities.

  [Text] On 11 April Colonel General Anatoliy Lopata, chief 
of the General Staff of Ukraine's armed forces and first deputy 
minister of defense, and Deputy Defense Minister Col. Gen. Ivan 
Bizhan held a briefing for diplomats accredited to Kiev 
concerning the incidents in Odessa 8-10 April. The generals 
cited facts and documents proving that from the very beginning 
Ukraine's Defense Ministry made every effort to avoid a 
conflict. In particular, General Lopata sent a telegram to the 
leaders of Russia's Defense Ministry in which he pleaded with 
them to keep the ship in Odessa until the situation had been 
clarified. Ukrainian Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy made a 
number of unsuccessful attempts to contact his Russian 
colleague, Pavel Grachev, by telephone. The minister then sent 
a telegram to Grachev, in which he explained the main points of 
the affair and the position of Ukraine's Ministry of Defense. 
The reply from Russia's minister of defense revealed that he 
was totally uninformed about the situation in Odessa and 
deliberately ignored the facts. 
  Vitaliy Radetskyy said that the arbitrary actions taken by 
the leadership of the Black Sea Fleet will be stopped in the 
appropriate manner. He invited a competent commission to Kiev 
which will ascertain all the issues relating to the Black Sea 
Fleet. This commission has arrived in the Ukrainian capital.

  [Text] Bonn 12 April, TASS -- Replying to a question as to 
who controls nuclear weapons deployed on Ukraine's territory, 
the Republic's Defence Minister V. Radetskyy, who was addressing 
a press conference at the end of his visit to Germany, said that 
at present there is a bilateral control on such weapons. But it 
is ordered by Ukraine, as "it is her property, the minister 
emphasised. A tripartite agreement on nuclear weapons was 
signed and a time-table of its withdrawal and destruction was 
approved this year in Moscow through the U.S. mediation. "The 
Ukrainian side is consistently and sincerely observing" this 
time-table, he said. According to him, until now two train 
loads of nuclear warheads have been despatched to Russia. In 
exchange Ukraine was supposed to receive fuel for its nuclear 
power plants from Russia. But Russia has not fulfilled this 
condition for the time being. That is why we have been obliged 
to suspend the time-table of withdrawal, to clarify it and make 
it binding on Russia to honour its commitments," he said.

  [Text] The Ukrainian People's Rukh leader, Vyacheslav 
Chornovil, suggested that the new Ukrainian parliament would not 
be better than the previous one. He emphasized that the Rukh 
must join with the national democratic forces and people who did 
not call for an empire and whose activities were aimed at 
strengthening Ukraine's statehood. 
  Chornovil said two people had very much wanted to gain from 
these elections. Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk would gain 
if the elections failed and former Supreme Soviet speaker Ivan 
Plyushch could have extended the powers of former deputies if 
the elections failed. Everything was arranged in order that the 
elections be invalid, Chornovil suggested. He added that these 
plans had been broken by the Ukrainian people. 
  When asked whether he will run for president, Chornovil 
pointed out that it could not be discussed since the president's 
powers had not as yet been defined. 
  Meanwhile, a member of the former Supreme Soviet's 
presidium, 
Les Tanyuk, said at a press conference in Kiev that the 
Communist majority in the new parliament did not mean their 
complete victory. Tanyuk believes that leftist politicians, most 
of who are about 60 years old, will not be capable of 
influencing decisionmaking in the parliament. "The victory of 
Communists does not signify a victory of the Communist idea," 
Tanyuk stressed. 
  When commenting on the early results of the parliamentary 
elections, a leader of the Inter-Regional Reform Bloc, former 
deputy chairman of the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet, Vladimir 
Grinev, emphasized that nothing unexpected had happened. 
"Certainly, it will be difficult with the Communists. However, 
we have lived with them for all our life, we can live with them 
a little more," he said. Grinev said his movement could join 
with the left in the parliament on some issues. 
  Grinev told INTERFAX-Ukraine that he had not as yet decided 
whether he would run for the coming presidential elections in 
Ukraine. He remarked that it was necessary to analyze the 
results of the elections to the Supreme Soviet. 
  Grinev said he could decide on his participation in the 
presidential elections on 12 April after his meeting with 
ex-premier Leonid Kuchma in Kiev. Kuchma is also leader of the 
Inter-Regional Reform Bloc.

  [Text] Vyacheslav Chornovil, leader of the Rukh, held a 
press conference today devoted to the results of the 
second-round legislative elections. The conference aroused so 
much interest that Mr. Chornovil jokingly said it was not a 
conference, but another meeting with the electorate of which he 
conducted more than 200 during his campaign. The main result, 
according to Vyacheslav Chornovil, is that the elections took 
place, and the Ukrainian people should be credited with this 
fact. The Rukh faction held its ground in the new parliament. 
In the elections, Rukh positioned itself in the center of the 
political spectrum, rejecting both far- right and far-left 
slogans. Vyacheslav Chornovil said that Rukh tried to handle 
its rivals and opponents in a correct manner, which cannot be 
said about them. The elections showed that our democratic and 
national movement has a long way to go yet before achieving 
unity. Those forces, Mr. Chornovil stated, did not participate 
in the elections as a united front. For example, divisions 
between Rukh and the Ukrainian Republican Party deepened, and a 
similar tendency is visible in the case of the Congress of 
Ukrainian Nationalists, which diverges the principles of 
democratic nationalism, on which its cooperation with Rukh was 
based. 
  Mr. Chornovil then focused on the flawed Ukrainian electoral 
legislation and violations reported during the recent voting. 
One could see that particular concern of the Rukh leader was 
aroused by the fact that Kiev is left without its legislative 
core. The elections here were simply torpedoed. Vyacheslav 
Chornovil stated that Rukh will not allow this to happen in the 
next, third-round elections, and will vigorously fight for every 
vacant seat in the parliament so that Kiev is represented by 
democratically oriented deputies. Democracy cannot do without a 
lobby in parliament. 
  [Begin Chornovil recording] There are quite a few 
independent 
democrats, or candidates whose independence have not yet been 
established. Some were in the power structures, and thus stayed 
out of parties. I think the uniting of democratic forces will 
be considered, unless some of the hot-headed national democrats 
shatter this unity. There have already been such attempts. By 
the way, I would like to see the newly elected Supreme Council 
carried away by political discussions, which is probably 
something that our communists will seek. It will be a bad thing 
if we start squabbling over national symbols or some other 
political issues. Perhaps we will have to look for [words 
indistinct] to resolve the serious problems with which Ukraine 
is presently faced. [end recording]

  [Text] Crimea -- Viktor Alsufyev, head of the Crimean 
Central Electoral Commission, held a news conference at 0900 on 
11 April which was devoted to the results of the second round of 
elections to the Supreme Council of Crimea and the Supreme 
Council of Ukraine. Forty-nine people's deputies of Crimea were 
elected in 49 electoral districts. Thus, the elections in 
Crimea are valid. Out of 98 seats in the parliament, 94 have 
already been occupied and the Supreme Council of Crimea has a 
real possibility to begin its work. In the words of Viktor 
Alsufyev, the Russia bloc won 64 mandates (57.4 percent of those 
elected); the Communist Party of Crimea will have two deputies; 
the Party for the Economic Revival of Crimea will have one; the 
Kurultay of the Crimean Tatars, 14; the Russia Party, one; and 
the Union of Officers of Crimea, one (who is Vice Admiral 
Oleksandr Frolov, deputy commander of the Black Sea Fleet). As 
Viktor Alsufyev said, seven deputies were elected from the old 
Crimean parliament. 
  According to the current Constitution of the Republic of 
Crimea, the first session of the Supreme Council of Crimea will 
be held on 10 May, that is, 30 days after the end of the second 
round of elections. [passage indistinct]

<F P=106> [Report by N. Zubkova: "On Behalf of the Parties"] </F>
  [Text] And elections yet again. And not the last. But the 
fate of the Supreme Council of Ukraine and the parliament of 
Crimea will have been decided by Monday, 11 April. It is in our 
hands. This page is devoted to it -- directly or indirectly. It 
is an appeal of the electorate to those who have already been 
elected, an attempt to analyze the results of the first round, 
and an introduction of the candidates who have made it through 
to the second round. In a word, think for yourselves. 
  KRYMSKIYE IZVESTIYA has received a statement of the SPRK 
[Socialist Party of the Republic of Crimea] Political Council, 
which says, in part, that the stage of the election campaign 
which has been negotiated "was accompanied by violations of the 
law of the Republic of Crimea `On Elections of the Supreme 
Council of Crimea' and was conducted under conditions impeding 
in a number of cases the free expression of the citizens," which 
was a violation of articles 38 and 39 of the law, "and there was 
frequently concentrated pressure on the electorate by activists 
of the Russia bloc." 
  The party believes that the president interfered directly in 
the election process by means of his initiative pertaining to 
the organization of a poll of citizens of the Republic 
simultaneously with the elections. 
  The party experienced direct threats and blackmail on the 
part of the supporters of other political parties--this was 
possible thanks to the policy of implacability toward different 
political views: "I. Khodykin, candidate for deputy and member 
of the SPRK Political Council, was subjected to armed assault 
and battery, and the appearances of the SPRK candidates on radio 
and television and in the press, obligatory by law, were 
frequently aborted. All this culminated in the president's 
appeal in his speech on television on 25 March for people to 
shun the ballot for elections to the Supreme Council of Ukraine 
and to vote only for his associates, which should be considered 
a direct violation of the constitution and the Election Act." 
  In this connection the SPRK Political Council deemed it 
necessary to insistently demand that the Central Election 
Commission "consider the elections null and void and, in 
accordance with Article 64 of the law `On Elections of the 
Supreme Council of Crimea,' schedule new elections within the 
established timeframe." 
  In respect to the first demand the party is prepared to 
present the Central Election Commission with all the necessary 
papers confirming the instances of violations. 
  A statement of similar content was addressed by the Crimean 
Tatar National Movement to the presidents of Crimea, Ukraine, 
and Russia and the news media. The CTNM [Crimean Tatar National 
Movement] evaluates the elections to the Supreme Council of 
Crimea as "an act of the greatest outrage against the will of 
the Crimean Tatar people." 
  As the statement says, "the three years of the fooling of 
the 
people by the state-run news media together with the most 
flagrant violations of the Election Act... ensured the 
co-optation into the Supreme Council of Crimea of the 
"Kurultay-Majlis" cohort. 
  Consequently, the information working group of the CTNM 
concludes, the imperial "Crimea without the Crimean Tatar 
people" policy is hereby continued, and it places the 
responsibility for the further development of events on the 
leaders of the above-mentioned states. 
  The appeal of the Russia bloc says that it thanks Crimeans 
for the support of President Yu. Meshkov and the candidates of 
the Russia bloc in the first round of the elections. "This 
support is very palpable: Of the possible 14 seats by party 
slate, the Russia bloc obtained 11, that is, 78.57 percent. 
  "In addition, from the 66 single-seat districts in the first 
round of voting, 12 deputies were elected from the Russia bloc, 
and 48 candidates have gone on to the second round. The 
elections were not held in four districts, unfortunately." 
  The Russia bloc called on the electorate to once again 
support its candidates "so that the new parliament can begin 
work and so that President Yu. Meshkov can obtain a legislative 
base for realization of the program of the Russia bloc."

<F P=106> [Report by Anatoliy Polynskyy] </F>
  [Text] The word resident means to vote in the Crimean 
language -- so joked a journalist at a briefing at the Central 
Electoral Commission devoted to the second round elections. 
There is indeed some truth in this joke. Although the Crimeans 
have already gone to the polls four times since the beginning of 
this year, it is still too early to summarize the elections. 
The election results for the Ukrainian Supreme Council are 
particularly unsatisfactory, despite the fact that they were 
held in all 23 constituencies. The majority of candidates for 
people's deputy did not manage to reach the so-called 20-percent 
threshold set by Ukrainian legislation, meaning that less than a 
quarter of registered voters voted for them. Of course, it is 
sad, but the Crimea, nonetheless, elected 11 deputies to the 
Ukrainian parliament, including five women. The remaining 12 
deputies will have to be elected in repeat elections which are 
to be within the next six months. 
  The Crimean parliament, however, has been virtually formed. 
Moreover, the first session of the Crimean Supreme Council has 
already been scheduled. According to legislation of the 
Autonomous Republic, the first session is supposed to be held 30 
days after the elections -- on 10 May. The final decision, 
however, is to be made by the former Supreme Council Presidium. 
Who won seats in the new parliament? There should be 98 
deputies, 94 of which have already been elected, including 55 
representatives of the "Rossiya" bloc. Eleven deputies have been 
reelected to the Supreme Council. 
  It must be noted that the current elections confirmed the 
complete collapse of the communist idea on the peninsula. In 
the Supreme Council, the Communist Party will be represented by 
only two deputies. An additional two deputies were elected from 
the Party of Economic Revival of the Crimea, and one deputy was 
elected from the Russian Party. By the way, Serhiy Shuvaynikov, 
leader of the Russian Party, was again defeated. He was elected 
neither president nor deputy. The voters did not put their 
confidence in Valeriy Averkin, leader of the Russian-Speaking 
Movement of the Crimea and manager of the scandalous Impex 55 
Krym association. Nevertheless, there will be enough people in 
the new parliament to deliver speeches, debate, and fight 
against Ukrainian nationalists. Oleksandr Kruhlov, the organizer 
of countless meetings in Sevastopol, is one of them. There will 
be enough people to support this restless fighter for the 
historic truth and victory of the Russian idea in the Crimea. 
The number of orators elected to the new parliament is 
impressive -- Viktor Mezha, Borys Kozyryov, Yuriy Rozhonyuk, 
Lidiya Kovalenko, Tatyana Ryabchykova. Time will tell, however, 
if the new parliament will be able to work constructively and 
adopt laws needed for economic reforms.

<F P=106> [President Leonid Kravchuk statement in the "Without </F>
Protocol" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] I hope that the elections will be valid. I am 
analyzing yesterday's round -- 12 deputies were elected from 16 
constituencies. It is preliminary information that has to be 
checked [pauses]... Thus, we already have 90 deputies. Today, 
over 350 will be elected. [passage indistinct] However, it 
seems to me that the new Supreme Council will face a need 
[pauses]... a need to determine its attitude toward the 
elections on 26 June [presidential elections]. The problem is 
not in holding or not holding the elections -- I have never 
[words indistinct]. We have agreed to it, and adopted laws that 
the elections must be held. However, in my opinion, the main 
point is to elect an authoritative and strong power built on a 
distinct legal basis. This is the main point. [pauses] In 
order to explain this thesis, I will use one example regarding 
the presidency. Having finally adopted a law on local 
authorities, the [Supreme Council] session -- we will say it 
openly -- restored a Soviet form of state management. We do not 
need to discuss now whether this is good or bad. This is not 
essential. [The session] has restored it -- it is a real fact. 
Further, [the session] has ruined -- if the elections are to be 
held under this law without any adopted amendments -- the 
executive presidential power. Thus, at a local level, executive 
presidential power already does not exist. If we are to elect a 
president with the powers that he has today as head of state and 
executive power, we will institute at the beginning -- on the 
election level -- contradictions and a conflicting situation. 
The president is being elected as head of executive power, but 
there are no structures for executive power. Therefore, it is 
not incidental that after the president had been elected, the 
issue of the creation of presidential structures at local levels 
emerged. The Soviet form of power was built distinctly -- 
lower-ranking bodies of power were subordinated to 
higher-ranking ones without any restrictions; moreover, there 
was also the Communist Party which, like a pivot, determined the 
entire structure of subordination. Where the Soviet form of 
distinct subordination did not exist, there was a distinct party 
subordination. That is to say, it was a thought-over structure 
[words indistinct] Now, this is ruined. If so, a question 
emerges: Why elect a president as head of executive power if he 
already has no structures -- to make him head of the Cabinet of 
Ministers? But the Cabinet of Ministers is to be headed by the 
prime minister, is it not? [unidentified voice answers -- 
Undoubtedly] Undoubtedly. Thus, the Supreme Council has to 
determine which president must be elected. It is indispensable. 
Without this, it will be an unnecessary waste of money and 
[pauses] effort, which will not be followed by real 
consequences. If the president is only the head of state, with 
limited powers, because the Soviet form of power has already 
been created [pauses]... In the Soviet form of power, 
presidential executive [power] does not exist, and cannot exist. 
It follows from polls [as heard] whether we have to elect a 
president in nationwide elections. Why does it follow? But has 
he been elected in nationwide elections? It was for the purpose 
of confirming a strong executive power. By now, you see, we do 
not have [this power] anymore. One more question. Let us take 
the same law. You will see that it provides [pauses]... These 
are representative bodies of power. However, they are delegated 
with state authority -- at the local level, I mean. Rayons, 
cities, and oblasts are delegated with state authority. What 
authority and how much -- there is nothing about this issue. It 
has been written that this will be determined by a separate law. 
Then, such a question emerges: What percent [of the powers] 
will be delegated -- 20 percent, or 30 percent? What percent 
will be left to the government? If 70 percent of the state 
powers are delegated, the government will be left with 30 
percent. A question emerges: What kind of government must be 
created -- with 40 ministries, or with 15? What powers will the 
government have if the current structure is unnecessary due to 
the delegation of state powers to rayons, oblasts, and cities? 
I do not say that this is bad. Perhaps, it is good. However, 
the Supreme Council must adopt a law on the delegation of powers 
to the local authorities. It is written there that they will be 
delegated by a separate law, but there is no such law. However, 
the law on local self-government is in force. In accordance 
with this law, lower-ranking bodies of power do not subordinate 
to higher-ranking ones. Again, from the first days, there is no 
legal and political clarity on how these bodies will work. The 
last thing. I have even read it in a paper, or have seen it on 
television that the law provides that the head of the executive 
power may be dismissed by the Cabinet of Ministers. There is no 
such provision there. This was in the draft. Someone has read 
the draft. It is written there that if the head [of the 
executive power] infringes, he may be dismissed from the post in 
accordance with the law. Again, there is no law on it. This 
way, it is necessary for the new Supreme Council to adopt, if we 
do not want to be laughed at, I want to say it quite openly 
[pauses]... I do not address it to someone personally, this is a 
state building. Having resolved at the Supreme Council to build 
a state according to Soviet [word indistinct] This is the right 
of the Supreme Council. However, one need all institutes 
[pauses]... all issues must be determined in accordance with 
this structure, with regard both to the president and to the 
Cabinet of Ministers, as well as to the powers delegated to 
these bodies of power. If the Supreme Council convenes in late 
April or in early May -- it is a realistic term -- and if all 
these laws are adopted, then the Supreme Council will be able to 
determine whether one needs to lose trillions for nationwide 
presidential elections, or whether the president will be only a 
representative figure, and there is no need for nationwide 
presidential elections. That is why those who today are 
considering running for the presidency have to ponder what 
presidents they will be if the laws are not adopted. With 
regard to my person, to my position, I do not want -- excuse my 
words -- to discuss this issue until these laws are adopted.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The President is a Guest of the </F>
Press Club"] 
  [Text] At a meeting of the press club for market reforms 
Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk answered reporters' 
questions. The reporters asked many questions in both the 
political and economic domains, and in a future issue of our 
paper we will carry an extended report on the meeting. The 
media representatives could not, of course, refrain from asking 
questions about the situation in the Crimea. In answering them, 
the Ukrainian president stated that from the very beginning he 
was in favor of granting the Crimean Republic most extensive 
economic powers (incidentally, like the Ukrainian oblasts), but 
not a single edict dealing with the economy has been adopted in 
the Crimea. He said the power structures there are engaged in 
political bustle, adopting decisions on various referendums, the 
dismissal of the head of Crimean television and radio, and 
moving the clocks forward. However, the Ukrainian president 
emphasized, the present budget of the Crimean Republic has been 
approved completely in accordance with Crimea's wishes. 
Therefore, the Crimean authorities themselves will have to be 
answerable for their mistakes before the people. I can move the 
clock even now, Kravchuk concluded. However, this will not 
improve the economic situation.

<F P=106> [Article by Yu. Koltsov, candidate for people's deputy of </F>
Ukraine for Electoral District 34: "And, As a Result, What?"] 
  [Text] The president of Crimea appeared on Crimean 
television two days prior to the elections on 27 March 1994, 
splitting his speech into two parts: an official part and, 
appended to it, "the position simply of a citizen of Crimea." 
  The official part expressed hostility toward elections in 
Crimea of people's deputies of Ukraine, and he said plainly in 
the "unofficial" part that he would not participate in this 
ballot and would take his ballot paper away with him. This was 
what 18 percent of the electorate did in Feodosiya, following 
the president's example. 
  And, as a result, what? 
  These events are quite serious and wide-ranging. It is 
impossible to step over them without making an attempt to 
comprehend this. 
  Unfortunately, the president does not see the need for the 
creation of a "support group" of deputies from Crimea in the 
Ukrainian parliament. A candidate for deputy of Ukraine from 
Sevastopol, who had come from the Baltic, points out directly in 
this connection that the "Russian speakers" also decided there 
formerly to boycott the parliamentary elections and paid a cruel 
price for this. 
  A powerful "counterrecoil" on the part of the western 
oblasts, where 85-90 percent of the population goes to the polls 
and elects at the first attempt fierce supporters of a 
strengthening of Ukraine's "independence" who see Crimea's 
policy only as "separatism that needs to be suppressed," can be 
seen at the present elections in Ukraine. 
  In this atmosphere in the parliament of Ukraine, does Crimea 
not need a "first line of defense" in the form of its own 
deputies, who would oppose the adoption of extreme decisions? 
  The president of Crimea quite recently supported the 
Kuchma-Grinev bloc uniting antinationalist forces in Southeast 
Ukraine. The bloc, which assembles judicious social forces in 
Ukraine, is being countered by Kiev officialdom, which is why a 
complex situation is taking shape. And under these difficult 
conditions the president of Crimea in fact changes his former 
position and does not consider it necessary to form a cohesive 
group of Crimean deputies in the parliament of Ukraine 
reinforcing the Kuchma-Grinev bloc. 
  I am inclined to think that in this case the president of 
Crimea has occupied a mistaken position, and it was not 
supported at the elections: 80 percent of people voted and did 
not carry their ballots away with them. 
  The president's mistake can still be rectified at the second 
stage of the elections of deputies of Ukraine, activists of the 
Russia bloc being oriented toward support for the candidates for 
deputy of Ukraine--participants in the Interregional Reform Bloc 
(IRB)--of the Kuchma-Grinev bloc: It is the authors of the 
mistaken position who should be rectifying it. Otherwise the 
situation will get worse. The president of Crimea could, 
perhaps, need 23 Crimean deputies in the parliament of Ukraine 
more than as many additional deputies of "his" in the parliament 
of Crimea: It is simpler for him to sort things out at home. 
  I consider it necessary to point all this out not on account 
of a desire to "force my way into power": The prospect of 
participation in the gloomy squabbles of the parliament of 
Ukraine is not particularly inspiring. 
  But the truth is dearer....

<F P=106> ["Communists Planning To Put Their Opponents Against the </F>
Wall"] 
  [Text] On 31 March, the Communist Party candidates for the 
office of deputy to the Supreme Council of Ukraine who made it 
to the second round of elections in Kharkiv Oblast held a press 
conference. Among those appearing at the conference were 
Anatoliy Sereda, leader of "Working Kharkiv," Anatoliy 
Perepylytsya, head of the "Union of Communists," and Alla 
Alyeksandrovska, second secretary of the oblast committee of the 
CPU. 
  The results of the first round of voting were described as a 
victory for the CPU, and they stated that they expected to win 
the elections. 
  Responding to a question regarding what he would do in 
parliament if elected, A. Sereda said that he would "be in 
charge of repressions and work in the Cheka." He did not specify 
against whom these repressions would be carried out, but a shout 
rang out from the audience: "The first people we will put up 
against the wall will be Khmara and Chornovil, then ravchuk and 
Plyushch, and all speculators, businessmen, and you 
correspondents." Following this shouted remark, most journalists 
left the press conference. 
  Ivan Latin, docent of the agricultural institute and a 
candidate for the office of deputy to the Supreme Council of 
Ukraine, answering a question from one of the few remaining 
journalists regarding whether repressions against businessmen 
would not result in increasing the number of beggars in Ukraine, 
replied: "The more beggars there are in Ukraine, the more 
communism and socialism there will be."

  [Text] Tallinn, Apr 11, BNS -- Estonian Prime Minister 
Mart Laar returned Sunday [10 April] from a working visit to 
Norway, the government's press service told BNS. 
  Laar met on Friday with his Norwegian counterpart Gro Harlem 
Brundtland. The two premiers discussed the development of 
Estonian-Norwegian cooperation, the situation at 
Estonian-Russian negotiations, integration of the Baltic states 
into Europe, Norway's talks with the European Union, Norway's 
assistance to Estonia to develop the Partnership for Peace 
program and to set up the Baltic peacekeeping battalion, and the 
construction of a Baltic gas pipeline. 
  Brundtland expressed support for Estonia's demand that 
Russian troops must promptly and unconditionally leave Estonia 
in keeping with the international obligations Moscow has assumed. 
  The two premiers said they were satisfied that the relations 
between their countries were becoming closer, and that the links 
would be further promoted by the opening of the Estonian Embassy 
in Oslo. "We must go out into the world more, speak about who we 
are," Laar said, "then the world, too, will take more interest 
in us." 
  The Norwegian premier also gave her backing to the steps 
Estonia and the other Baltic states have been taking to forge 
closer ties with Europe. 
  Laar addressed on Saturday a congress of the Norwegian 
conservative Hoyre party. He spoke about Estonia's path to 
Europe and the Nordic states' role in the process. Estonia 
takes a road to Europe similar to that of the Nordic countries, 
the premier said, starting with economic cooperation with 
European countries and then proceeding to political negotiations. 
  The Estonian premier had meetings with the Hoyre party's 
leaders and with members of the parliamentary foreign affairs 
and national defense commissions. The meetings attached great 
importance to the Baltic states remaining outside the East's 
sphere of influence as one of guarantees for Norway's security.

  [Text] Tallinn, Apr 11, BNS -- Estonian Prime Minister 
Mart Laar met today with Vice President Basil Kovalsky and other 
leaders of the World Bank, the government's press service told 
BNS. 
  The meeting focused on issues related to the Baltic 
investment conference the World Bank arranges in May in Paris. 
The goal of the conference is to introduce the course of the 
Baltic states toward a market economy and investment openings in 
those countries to the governments, economy experts and 
entrepreneurs of the G-24 countries. 
  The World Bank representatives praised Estonia's 
development, 
emphasizing that the government has, despite pressure, not taken 
the road of populism. They regarded the recent rise in 
inflation level as inevitable and natural. The Bank of Estonia 
and the government can take some steps to put brakes on 
inflation, the visitors said, but on the whole they advised the 
country to stick to its chosen course. The World Bank 
representatives met today also with Economics Minister Toivo 
Jurgenson.

  [Text] Estonia will urge the world community to back its 
demand for the Russian troops' withdrawal by August 31, 1994, 
Estonian Foreign Minister Juri Luik told the newspaper 
Hommikuleht on Monday. 
  He said that the west supported this demand. It is extremely 
important, he went on to say, that by the time the 19th round of 
the Estonian-Russian talks begin, the western states' position 
become clear to Russia. He pointed out that Estonia would raise 
this question in international organizations, including the 
Western European Union, the European Union and NATO. Estonian 
representatives will also discuss this problems with the 
parliament of some states and with inter-parliamentary 
organizations, he said. 
  He announced that during his last week's visit to Brussels, 
he addressed the European Parliament's commission for foreign 
affairs, after which some of the parliamentary factions proposed 
that the European Parliament adopt a resolution supporting the 
demand for the withdrawal of the Russian troops from Estonia by 
August 31 without additional terms. 
  During the latest round of the Russian-Estonian talks in 
Moscow, Russia stated that the 2,500 Russian servicemen still 
staying in Estonia would not be withdrawn from Estonia by August 
31, if Estonia did not provide Russian military pensioners with 
social guarantees. Estonia refused to do so, saying that this 
move would go against the national legislation.

  [Text] Tallinn, Apr 08, BNS -- In the 18th round of the 
Estonian-Russian negotiations, the parties almost reached 
agreement on the dismantling of the Paldiski nuclear reactors, 
Ago Tiiman, secretary of the Estonian delegation for the talks 
and head of the military issues working group, said at a press 
conference today. 
  Tiiman told reporters Estonia put forward an "entirely new 
idea" for dismantling the reactors at Paldiski, which the 
Russian side is now studying. "The proposal differs from the 
earlier ones," Tiiman said. "Our position is that the rods must 
be removed from the reactors by the end of June, and the rest of 
the jobs, such as dismantling the reactors and removing nuclear 
wastes, completed as quickly as possible." 
  Tiiman declined to disclose the details of the idea, but 
declared Estonia's new plan would be optimal in costing the 
country less than 10 million U.S. dollars. The dismantling of 
the reactors takes place in three stages. Tiiman said in the 
first stage nuclear fuel is removed from the reactors and taken 
out of Estonia; Russia will remove "military secrets" from the 
reactors during the second stage; and, lastly, the reactors and 
nuclear wastes will be transported to Russia. Should Russia 
agree to Estonian proposals, the complete dismantling of the 
nuclear reactors in Paldiski will take roughly three years. 
  Juri Tikk, special representative of the government in 
Paldiski, earlier said the first stage of dismantling is 
expected to begin in the second half of April. Russia will not 
allow even Estonian experts to attend the second stage of the 
operation, Tikk said, because they claim the reactors contain 
secret equipment. 
  Rescue Department Director Harry Hein said a special rescue 
squad of over 300 men and 100 machines has been formed to ensure 
security during the dismantling operation. The unit comprises 
fire, rescue, medical, law and order enforcement, evacuation, 
and other task forces, he said.

  [Text] The government supports in principle the forming of 
an ad hoc parliamentary commission to study the case of the 
daily RAHVA HAAL and wider aspects of the privatisation of 
state-owned media, government spokesman Ain Saarna said on 
Friday [8 April]. Thursday's cabinet session had discussed the 
draft laws submitted by the Centre faction and the Coalition 
Party-Rural Union factions. The factions recommended that the 
activities of the board of the state-owned company "Rahva Haal" 
be suspended and the agreement with the company "Hommikuleht" on 
the publication of the RAHVA HAAL be terminated. Saarna 
commented that the government does not support nor wish the 
approval of these draft laws in their present form. The forming 
of the ad hoc parliamentary commission will only be possible 
after a ruling coalition faction or Riigikogu [parliament] 
member should propose it, he explained.

  [Text] Tallinn, Apr 11, BNS -- The Estonian Rural Center 
Party [ECRP] and Pro Patria agreed in the course of talks today 
to sign the inter-party agreement on Thursday [14 April], ERCP 
chairman Ivar Raig told BNS. 
  Raig said the two parties still haven't reached agreement on 
exempting farmers and other individual producers from the income 
tax and on reforming the government. If compromise isn't 
achieved on Wednesday when the negotiations continue, Raig said, 
the differences will be established in additional protocols, 
which most probably will be concluded in May. 
  If agreement isn't reached, the ERCP may still leave the 
ruling coalition, Raig claimed. He added the decision will be 
made at the party's annual conference early in June. 
  The preliminary text of the agreement contains proposals 
concerning regional policy, the property and the land reforms, 
taxation and financing of agriculture, protection of the 
domestic farming produce market, government reform, and 
establishment of an agricultural scientific, educational and 
consulting system.

<F P=106> [Report by Yuriy Stroganov: "There Will Be No `Baltic </F>
Bloc.' Not Yet...."] 
  [Text] Vilnius -- The meeting of the presidents of Latvia, 
Lithuania, and Estonia in Palanga has caused journalists to 
start talking about the creation of a "Baltic bloc." However, 
A. Brazauskas has stated that there was no talk of creating any 
kind of "bloc." All that is happening is that multilateral 
treaties will be concluded which take into account the three 
Baltic states' joint actions, he noted. 
  On 1 April, for example, the treaty on free trade among the 
Baltic countries went into force. An agreement on social 
guarantees for citizens of any Baltic state working or studying 
in another Baltic state will be prepared at government level. 
  The strengthening of ties among the Baltic countries as well 
as their contacts with neighboring regions will shorten the path 
toward European integration, the Lithuanian president noted. 
  Considerable attention was paid to cooperation with the 
so-called Visegrad group of states -- Poland, the Czech 
Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary. Lennart Meri, for example, 
proposed that the concept of a "North-South axis" be launched, 
which would mean using the formula "five plus three plus four" 
(the five Nordic countries, the three Baltic states, and the 
four Visegrad states). 
  The conference stressed the importance of Ukraine's decision 
on joining NATO's "Partnership for Peace" program. This is 
because Ukraine, in the opinion of the Baltic presidents, will 
play an increasingly important role in the long-term guarantees 
of security and stability in Europe and in particular near to 
the Baltic Sea region. Clearly this is being done in the hope 
of creating a Baltic-Black Sea alliance, which is supported by 
politicians both in Ukraine and the Baltic countries. In this 
light the recent visit to Lithuania by Romanian President Ion 
Iliescu does not seem surprising. He also confirmed his support 
for the creation of such an alliance. 
  In the view of the presidents of Latvia, Lithuania, and 
Estonia, this will also be helped by the bilateral treaties 
recently signed between Ukraine and Lithuania and between 
Ukraine and Estonia. 
  The Palanga meeting paid special attention to questions of 
the withdrawal of the Russian troops from Latvia and Estonia. 
In a joint statement the presidents confirmed their conviction 
that Russia's entire Armed Forces must be withdrawn before 31 
August 1994. They urged the international community to continue 
monitoring the situation to ensure that this deadline is 
observed. The Lithuanian and Estonian presidents welcomed the 
troop withdrawal agreement reached during talks between Latvia 
and Russia. They also hope that a similar accord will be 
reached between Estonia and Russia. 
  The Skrunda radar station, on which Latvia and Russia have 
apparently already reached agreement, was again in the sphere of 
attention of the heads of state. They stressed the need for the 
participation of international organizations in ensuring the 
strict observance of the use of the Skrunda station to ensure 
that the population of this zone does not suffer any adverse 
consequences and that the equipment is not used as a military 
base and does not present a threat to Latvia's sovereignty. 
  The presidents also expressed the wish that international 
specialists take part in the dismantling of the nuclear 
equipment at Paldiski. They also believe that the process of 
strengthening political and economic relations with the European 
Union [EU] should move toward the conclusion of treaties on free 
trade with the EU. They expressed the hope that a treaty on 
associate membership will be concluded no later than the end of 
1994. 
  The presidents agreed among themselves on the holding of the 
so-called "three presidents' sessions" at least twice a year. 
The aim of their meetings is to develop closer cooperation 
between the Baltic states and to coordinate strategy on 
questions of security and foreign policy. 
  But the idea of creating a Baltic Council did not meet with 
support. The point is that such a council, by analogy with the 
Nordic Council, should embrace broader -- parliamentary and 
government -- structures. The presidents were not prepared for 
that. But everything has its day.

  [Excerpts] Vilnius, April 11, ELTA -- If Russia tried to 
check the reaction of the Baltic countries and the whole region 
by its last political steps, it became aware of the position of 
the Baltic states on the issue, Seimas [parliament] Chairman 
Ceslovas Jursenas told a news conference on Monday [11 April]. 
  Jursenas noted that the reaction to Russia's intention to 
establish new military bases in Latvian territory of each state 
as well as of the whole region was "adequate, correct and 
effective". 
  Jursenas emphasized the importance of the joint statement 
made by the three presidents of the Baltic states and the 
support for Latvia and Estonia expressed by Lithuanian Foreign 
Ministry. 
  During the visit of Jursenas to Estonia on April 6-8 a lot 
of 
attention was given to the issues of the foreign policy of the 
Baltic countries and its coordination. [passage omitted] 
  Jursenas also emphasized that, despite the hostile Russian 
policy, neither Latvia nor Estonia shut the doors for the 
negotiations with this country.

  [Text] Vilnius, Apr 11, BNS -- The International Monetary 
Fund on Friday [8 March] approved a USD 36 million preferential 
loan to Lithuania under the so-called systemic transformation 
facility, the IMF office in Vilnius said. 
  This is the second equal part of a credit that was approved 
Oct. 22, 1993. Under the systematic transformation facility, 
assistance is provided to post-communist countries encountering 
balance of payments problems that mainly appear when a country 
stops using government-controlled prices in trade. Lithuanian 
Finance Ministry officials said the first part of the credit was 
used for investment projects and energy needs. 
  Lithuania joined the IMF in April 1992 and has already 
received around 123 million dollars from it. A number of 
political forces in Lithuania criticize the government for the 
country's increasing external debt, but Prime Minister Adolfas 
Slezevicius rejects all criticism saying the per capita debt is 
quite small and that the Lithuanian economy cannot be rebuilt 
without foreign loans. 
  The IMF approved its first USD 77.6 million loan to 
Lithuania 
in the fall of 1992. The loan was given for six years and was 
used to stabilize Lithuania's national currency. 
  Peter Cornelius, IMF representative in Lithuania, said 
Lithuania has already used up possibilities to receive loans 
under the systematic transformation facility. There is also a 
28-million dollar stand-by credit that Lithuania may receive if 
it successfully carries out its current economic policy 
memorandum. Cornelius said all the necessary information about 
the first quarter of this year should be available by mid-April 
and Lithuania can expect the first quarter of the 28 million in 
mid-May. 
  In its press release, the IMF said Lithuania aims at keeping 
its financial deficit below one percent of the GDP, in part by 
adopting an 18-percent value-added tax that comes into effect 
May 1. The fund said the establishment of a currency board is 
expected to help curb inflation, cut interest rates and to carry 
out a strict fiscal policy. 
  The IMF loan supposedly served as one of the principal 
arguments for adopting the litas reliability law that provides 
for the establishement of a currency board and pegging the litas 
to a foreign currency. The law came into effect April 1. 
  Discussing the economic situation in Lithuania, the IMF said 
privatization, which has already covered around half of all 
large and small enterprises, has been proceeding smoothly. 
According to the press release, the government seeks to 
accelerate the process of privatization by removing all 
preferential treatment for employees and managers in the 
privatization process, and by lifting restrictions on share 
ownership in agricultural processing enterprises. 
  The report said the bankruptcy law is in force, although a 
clear bankruptcy procedure is still absent. Discussing trade, 
the IMF said the Lithuanian Government now plans to introduce a 
uniform 10-percent import tariff. 
  As regards efforts to soften the effect of economic reforms 
on social life, the IMF said the Lithuanian Government intends 
to carry out a broad package of pension reforms on Jan. 1,1995, 
including an increase in the retirement age. 
  The IMF said signs that the private sector in Lithuanian 
flourishes "give grounds for cautious optimism that the recovery 
is underway in Lithuania. The recovery remains fragile, 
however, and the authorities must be vigilant in their efforts 
to foster a stable and predictable environment for economic 
activity if growth is to be sustained."

<F P=106> [Statement by the Lithuanian Socialist Party "On the </F>
Attitude Toward the Ruling LDDP" issued on 26 March 1994 in 
Vilnius] 
  [Text] People's disillusionment with the destructive 
policy of the right-wing radicals was responsible for the 
victory of the Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party [LDDP] in the 
Seimas [parliament] elections. Moreover, the social democratic 
principles in the party program also influenced this victory. 
  Assuming power, the LDDP managed to slightly normalize the 
political situation in the country and partially halt the 
dangerous confrontation among political forces. 
  Unfortunately, due to its inherent faults (an eclectic 
theoretical approach, the lack of political will, the infinite 
syndrome of remorse, and so on), the ruling party failed to 
introduce essential changes in Lithuania's situation or offer 
more serious resistance to the destructive right-wing forces. 
  Pressured by these right-wing forces, the LDDP Seimas 
majority adopted a number of extremely equivocal decisions: On 
the undifferentiated litas' exchange rate, on joining NATO, and 
on free arms trade. 
  It is already obvious today, however, that LDDP actions have 
become more dynamic. Work of law enforcement institutions has 
been strengthened. More attention and money are being devoted 
to the resolution of social problems. LDDP's foreign policy has 
become more active and constructive. 
  If these tendencies prevail in future LDDP activities, the 
Lithuanian socialists will support the moves of the ruling 
party. Such positive actions really help overcome the crisis in 
Lithuania, prevent political instability, and serve the 
interests of the entire population. The Socialist Party 
sincerely admits this. 
  We are determined to point out the government's mistakes in 
a 
good-natured manner in the future as well. In contrast with the 
absolute majority of the right parties, however, we respect the 
constitutional right of the LDDP to govern Lithuania until the 
next Seimas elections. 
  [Signed] Lithuanian Socialist Party Council 
  [Dated] 26 March 1994, Vilnius.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "A Law for an Illegal Owner"] </F>
  [Text] The law on land has long been awaited by everyone. 
The problem of transferring or exchanging land, which is being 
resolved with such difficulty today, may not have existed, if 
this law had been adopted alongside the laws on land reform and 
"On the Procedure and Terms for Restoring the Citizens' Right to 
Preserved Real Estate." The latter may have been simpler and 
shorter, because the current land law could have regulated many 
issues. If the nation decided to restore the former preserved 
property to everyone, it should have done so without such delay, 
and immediately adopted this law on land which regulates land 
ownership and grants its owners the right to sell, lease, 
mortgage, or exchange it. Owners themselves would have 
regulated this issue much faster than the state. The latter 
began to move land from the owners' former place of residence to 
their current one. The state transferred the land for some 
owners, but did not have the chance to do so for others. 
Protectionism emerged: Those who were smarter managed to get 
their land from the bureaucrats, while those who did not have 
access to them remained behind. People were set against each 
other, and those who believed in the return of justice became 
disillusioned. The further we go, the more injustice we have. 
The state has decided to buy land from those owners to whom it 
allegedly has no possibility of returning it. The area of land 
that cannot be returned is increasing each year, while the state 
is promising to buy it at market prices. What market? Who 
knows the price, if the land market did not exist then? 
Finally, it is clear even to a child that a market is possible 
only between two sides that make a deal. Did any former owners 
ask the state to buy their land of their free will? They are 
placed in such a situation because otherwise they would not 
regain their land all the same. Even compulsory leasing has 
emerged. 
  Amendments to this land reform and the law "On the Procedure 
and Terms for Restoring the Citizens' Right to Preserved Real 
Estate" have been sitting at the Constitutional Court for a long 
time. Are they covered with dust? It may make no sense to 
annul these amendments later, because the new law on land 
adopted by the Seimas will make that injustice even more 
profound. 
  Yes, the land law itself does not seem so bad -- the sale of 
land exists throughout the world and is regulated by the law. 
However, who is this owner possessing those rights? Apart from 
real owners, the state also owns land. Article 4 of this law 
indicates what land belongs to the state. The law seems to be 
correct because it states that land under state ownership is 
that which is necessary for common interests: Land for roads, 
railways, national parks, recreation areas, and land containing 
waters of state importance, cultural and historical 
monuments.... However, the law further details the sale of 
state land for private ownership. What land will the state 
sell? The land indicated in Article 4 which cannot be sold to 
private persons? The goal is stated in the third part of the 
law: Land that has not been returned to owners also belongs to 
the state. Why was it not returned? Why can the state have it 
while the owner cannot? Moreover, the law also recognizes as 
owners such people who bought or acquired land free of charge 
from the state. It follows that without restoring land to some 
owners (the previously adopted laws grant such a right), the 
state will sell it to others. This law allows state 
institutions and their employees to do so. That is why owners 
are against this law, and the opposition is urging the president 
not to sign it, threatening to appeal to the Constitutional 
Court. What can the Constitutional Court do? Does the law on 
land create this injustice? It only follows the tail of its 
predecessors. 
  Meanwhile, the "good" opposition had better keep silent now. 
Who prevented it from adopting the land law on time? During 
its former rule, the opposition also transferred the procedure 
of land restoration to state institutions rather than owners 
themselves. It is said that the time for adopting the law on 
land was not right. Land would have allegedly fallen into the 
hands of a few rich people who had acquired their wealth in a 
slightly dishonest manner. Do we have fewer rich people today? 
Did they earn their wealth in a more honest way? 
  Neither the current opposition nor the ruling force cared 
much about this justice, as well as about real land owners and 
users. Some of them wanted to make exceptions to a small group 
of owners. This is exactly what happened. Who regained land 
successfully and without any problems during the rule of the 
current opposition? Others, however, are concerned with a 
handful of officials. If the latter were short of state assets 
they could distribute, redistribute, or "carve off" a few bits 
for themselves, now they will have them. These assets have been 
legalized.

  [Text] Moscow, Apr 11, BNS -- Russia holds the opinion 
that the incident over President Boris Yeltsin's order to 
establish military bases in Latvia was exhausted with Moscow's 
official apology. The Latvian side, on the other hand, is 
determined to achieve that the text of the executive order will 
be changed. 
  "We've given the necessary explanations and see no reason 
why 
we should once more return to a closed issue," Sergei Prikhodko, 
a Foreign Ministry official in charge of Baltic affairs, said 
Monday [11 April] in a telephone interview to BNS. "Also, we've 
not been officially informed by Latvia that it holds a different 
view," he said. 
  Latvian officials, however, state that the case hasn't been 
closed yet. The Latvian Foreign Ministry declared after 
Russia's explanations that, in view of Moscow having already 
partly acknowledged the error of Yeltsin's order, "a logical 
step would be to either revoke or amend it." 
  "Under Russian laws, the order takes effect on April 13, 
with 
which Latvia of course cannot agree," Peteris Vinkelis, first 
secretary of the Latvian Embassy in Moscow, told BNS. 
  Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis announced on Friday that he 
indefinitely postpones his visit to Moscow originally set for 
April 20. The two countries planned in the course of the visit 
to sign a package of bilateral agreements on the withdrawal of 
Russian troops from Latvia. Ulmanis also said the initialed 
agreements are "unfavorable for Latvia." 
  BNS has information that the Russian side intends to work 
out 
an altered version of the executive order. Changing the text of 
the order is linked with difficulties, however, since the heads 
of the country's defense and foreign political departments as 
well as the president are absent from Moscow. 
  The presidential staff are also determined to find out the 
reason for the mistake in the executive order. Sergei 
Krasavchenko, deputy chief of the president's office, even 
conjectured in an interview with the ITAR-TASS news agency that 
"the mistake was not technical but a political act with the aim 
of foiling the meeting between the two countries' heads of 
state."

  [Text] Russian officials consider that with the apology for 
the incident that has arisen from President Boris Yeltsin's 
order on the creation of military bases in Latvia, the conflict 
has been resolved. However, Latvian officials' views are 
different, and Latvia intends to request the alteration of the 
text of the presidential order. Immediately after Russia's 
explanation the Latvian Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that, 
as Russia has already partly withdrawn Yeltsin's order, it would 
be logical to repeal or alter it. This was told to the Baltic 
News Service [BNS] by (Peteris Inkelis), first secretary at the 
Latvian Embassy in Moscow, today. According to Russian 
legislation, the published order will come into force on 13 
April, which is obviously not acceptable to Latvia. 
  According to information at the disposal of BNS, Russia 
intends, nevertheless, to draft an altered version of the text 
of Yeltsin's order. Though the alteration of the text is 
difficult, because neither the head of the Defense Ministry nor 
the Foreign Ministry nor Yeltsin himself are in Moscow at the 
moment. The Russian president's structures also intend to 
ascertain reasons for the error creeping into the presidential 
order. Sergey Krasavchenko, deputy head of the Yeltsin 
administration, even deems it possible that that was not a mere 
technical error, but rather a political act aimed at the 
disruption of the meeting between the Russian and Latvian 
presidents.

<F P=106> [Article by Eriks Kulis: "Explosions Heard in Ammunition </F>
Depots at Liepaja Military Seaport"] 
  [Text] Liepaja, 25 Mar -- In accordance with the timetable 
for Russian Army withdrawal from Liepaja, Army Unit No. 1331 
emptied its artillery ammunition depots, but unfortunately did 
not finish the job. At three depots, boxes containing outdated 
detonators for infantry mines and artillery missiles (the latter 
contain approximately 300 grams of explosives), as well as long 
powder sticks were left behind. This oversight was immediately 
taken advantage of by youngsters, who took away everything that 
caught their eye, and over the next few days the area around the 
seaport shook with loud explosions. Thank Goodness, until now 
the "taking over" of the depots has not inflicted a toll in 
human life, but teachers at a nearby school are often shocked 
when they have to run after first-grade students carrying enough 
explosives to blow up the entire class. Naturally, the rest of 
the inhabitants feel as if they are on the front line. 
  "I am ashamed to report on this example of 
irresponsibility," 
the military prosecutor of the Russian Army in Liepaja, Vitalijs 
Pobedonoscevs, told DIENA during an interview. "Along with 
evacuating the ammunition depots, the armed guards were also 
removed, leaving only an emergency fire brigade, but no one at 
the headquarters knew that explosives have been left there. The 
fact was overlooked by officers responsible for transporting the 
ammunition. The result was that over four or five days, the 
depots could be entered by anyone who so desired. Presently, a 
criminal investigation is being conducted, supervised by the 
commander of the garrison, Valerijs Stalevs." 
  V. Pobedonoscevs also stated that it is now necessary to 
form 
a unit of explosives experts, because it is not possible to hand 
the depots over to municipal authorities in such a state. 
  With regard to these events, head of the Liepaja Police 
Department, Janis Lidaks, told DIENA the following: "This is an 
example of extraordinary irresponsibility. If military 
personnel were ordered to evacuate the ammunition depots, they 
should have been in full control of the operation. Presently, 
we are catching the boys, but this really only represents a 
fight against the consequences of the action. Actually, we have 
traced a few boxes, but this is nothing in comparison with the 
great amount of explosives that have already been spirited away 
from the depots. Of course, we have warned the National Guard, 
as well as the municipal police. But it is not within our 
capabilities to guard the 60 hectares on which the depots are 
situated. Surely, Russian armed sentinels have been placed 
there now, but according to unofficial reports, some soldiers 
are ready to close their eyes for a pack of cigarettes and let 
anyone in, if somebody would like to see what is inside the 
depots." 
  J. Lidaks is of the opinion that an intense trade in the 
explosives can now be expected, and whoever is interested will 
be able to purchase them freely.

  [Text] The Latvian and U.S. ambassadors to Russia, Janis 
Peters and Thomas Pickering, discussed relations between Latvia 
and Russia in Moscow today. Ritums Rozenbergs reports about 
these talks over the telephone from Moscow. 
  [Rozenbergs] A meeting between Latvian Ambassador to Russia 
Janis Peters and U.S. Ambassador to Russia Thomas Pickering was 
held at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow on Monday afternoon. The 
main topic of the talks was the present state of relations 
between Latvia and Russia, especially in the wake of the 
Latvian-Russian treaties initialled on 15 March as well as the 
Yeltsin order on military bases published on 6 April. 
  During the talks with Pickering, Mr. Peters stressed that 
signing the package of agreements should in no way contradict 
the interests of the Latvian people. Pickering confirmed 
Washington's readiness to grant $2 million for the dismantling 
of the Skrunda radar station. The ambassadors discussed the 
possibility of granting vouchers to Russian military pensioners 
who express the wish to move to live in Russia, to obtain 
apartments. The United States is not yet ready to specify the 
amounts of money which it is to earmark for such vouchers. A 
serious discussion was held on the possibility of attracting 
foreign capital to a Skrunda fund.

begin the dismantling of a new building of the Skrunda radar 
station as early as this year, according to a letter submitted 
to the Latvian Ministry of Foreign Affairs by the U.S. Embassy

  In the letter, the United States has expressed readiness to 
also promote the involvement of other countries in this 
international action. The agreement between Latvia and Russia 
initialled on 15 March provides that the dismantling of the 
unfinished radar station will be carried out by Latvia using its 
own money and that it may commence immediately after the signing 
of the agreement.

<F P=106> [Article by Baiba Melnace: "Russian Customs Tariffs Will </F>
Impede Production in Latvia"] 
  [Excerpts] Riga, 31 Mar -- The new, higher import customs 
duties, introduced by Russia, will have a negative effect on 
Latvian manufacturers who export their products to Russia. 
According to statistics, approximately 36 percent of the total 
Latvian export goes to Russia. Olgerts Pavlovskis, minister of 
state for trade and European Union Affairs, does not think that 
the increasing of import customs tariffs on Russia's part means 
economic pressure on the Baltic states. However, the Estonian 
Government, as DIENA has already reported, is of the opinion 
that by introducing new customs tariffs Russia has started an 
economic war against the Baltic states. 
  According to O. Pavlovskis, an increase in customs duties is 
not a special political act aimed at the Baltic states alone, 
because the tariffs are higher also for other countries. 
Nonetheless, the fact that the Russian parliament avoids -- for 
more than one year -- ratifying the most favored nation clause 
for trade with Latvia could be regarded as political pressure. 
Consequently, the import tariffs for Latvian goods are twice 
the so-called basic import tariffs. 
  At present, Russia has granted the most favored nation 
clause 
to 125 countries and organizations, for example, to the European 
Union, and basic import tariffs are being applied to goods 
arriving from these countries . Among the developing countries, 
104 can supply their goods paying only half of the basic import 
tariffs, and 46 countries are not obliged to pay any customs 
duties at all. The rest of the countries, including the Baltic 
states, have to pay a customs duty for their goods that is twice 
as high as the basic tariff. Since 15 March, customs tariffs in 
Russia were increased for all agricultural products, and were 
applied also to those that were customs free until now. For milk 
and milk products, as well as for meat, the new basic tariffs 
are 15-20 percent of the value of the product, but for Latvian 
products, as was said before, they are twice as high. Among 
industrial goods, the highest raise was set for vans -- from 5 
to 30 percent. For motorbikes it has risen up to 20 percent, 
for cosmetics -- about 5 percent, for textiles -- about 10 
percent. The average customs duty for Latvian goods amounts to 
40 percent of the value of the manufactured article. [passage 
omitted] 
  Andrejs Runcis, director of the trade department in the 
Ministry of Economy, pointed out that the reason for the 
problems with the export of Latvian products to Russia is the 
lack of a main trade agreement between Latvia and Russia. He 
told DIENA: It is absolutely clear that the new tariffs create 
obstacles for Latvia in trading with Russia. At the same time, 
the behavior of Russia is illogical -- if the customs duties are 
rising, the prices are rising too. The big cities in Russia 
wish to conclude direct trade agreements with Latvia on food 
supplies, in order to lower the prices. [passage omitted]

  [Text] State President Guntis Ulmanis has begun his visit 
to the Western countries of Denmark, France and Great Britain. 
Today, the president met Danish Foreign Minister Niels Helveg 
Petersen and Prime Minister Poul Rasmussen, as well as making a 
private visit to the Queen of Denmark, Margrethe II. Harvijs 
Baumanis reports from Copenhagen: 
  [Begin Ulmanis recording] The world's countries need to 
create for us the opportunity to set up in Latvia a certain 
support fund, which would have several aims. It can even be 
said that this is the main reason for our visit to Denmark, 
Britain and France, and these issues will also be raised in 
France and Britain. They have already been discussed in Denmark. 
  The main objectives of such a fund would be, first, to 
eliminate the consequences of the Skrunda radar functioning in 
Latvia. Without doubt, money from this fund would also have to 
be used to tackle social problems in Latvia. It would also be 
necessary to promote the return of military pensioners to 
Russia, if they want this themselves. The Danish side has 
decided to participate in a fact-finding mission at Skrunda, 
working together with British experts. The aim of such a 
mission would be to determine the negative influence on the 
environment of the work of the Skrunda radar and how it affects 
people. 
  Denmark once again underlined that the Yeltsin order of 5 
April was unacceptable for Denmark and European countries, and 
that it has in no way improved the international climate -- 
rather it did the opposite. [end recording] 
  Ulmanis left later for Paris, where meetings with French 
Prime Minister Eduard Balladur and Foreign Minister Alain Juppe 
are scheduled for tomorrow. After that Ulmanis intends to go to 
London where he will meet British Prime Minister John Major and 
Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd.

<F P=106> [FINSKA NOTISBYRAN report: "Swedish Publisher To Close </F>
Latvian Newspaper?"] 
  [Text] Stockholm -- Swedish newspaper DAGENS INDUSTRI's 
Latvian business daily, DIENAS BIZNESS, has been the target of 
Russian mafia threats in Latvia. 
  "We do not intend to come to terms with the mafia. If the 
threats are escalated there is only one thing to be done -- 
close the successful newspaper in Riga," said Hasse Olsson, 
chief editor of DAGENS INDUSTRI and chairman of the board of the 
Latvian newspaper. 
  The threats against DIENAS BIZNESS began a few weeks ago. 
Three Russian-speaking men offered the newspaper "protection in 
return for free advertising peace in the newspaper." Chief 
editor Juris Paiders rejected the offer. A few days later his 
wife and two small children were threatened with a knife by 
unknown men. One of the newspaper's cars has also been damaged. 
  "You can never feel secure," Paiders said, despite the fact 
that his Swedish financial backer, the Bonnier group's 
Affarsforlaget which also publishes DAGENS INDUSTRI, has 
provided him and his family with bodyguards. Hasse Olsson not 
only refused the blackmailers advertising space. Yesterday he 
published an article revealing the threats. 
  "The reason why we are publishing the article here and in 
Latvia is that we want to create a body of public opinion which 
we hope will make the Latvian Government understand that we 
cannot have things like this," he said. 
  "The alternative is to continue to live under this pressure 
with every growing numbers of security guards. There would 
never be any end to such a situation. Paiders and I are agreed 
that it is best to give publicity to the whole affair. Now that 
the matter has been made public I think that not even the mafia 
will dare to do what they otherwise would have done," he said. 
  And nothing will make the publishers come to terms with the 
mafia, not even an escalation of the threats.

"Chelyabinsk Residents in Luck"] 
  [Text] The results of a sociological survey commissioned 
by the city administration and carried out in Chelyabinsk by 
specialists from the Urals branch of the Center for the 
Improvement of Labor Organization, Production Management, and 
Social Development, caused a near sensation. 
  The sociological survey showed that the status of people in 
Chelyabinsk, compared with 1992, the year of the collapse, had 
improved in terms of all indicators: They are materially better 
off, the housing situation is less acute, basic living standards 
and the quality of food have improved and are now above average 
for the region, and the level of prosperity and social 
protection has risen. The point is that a system of social 
protection has started operating this year. Thus, expenditure 
on food now accounts for 49 rather than 70 percent of the family 
budget, as it was last year.

results of the second round of elections to the St. Petersburg 
City Assembly. 
  Only 18.76 percent of the overall number of registered 
voters 
participated in the voting. Elections were held in 24 electoral 
precincts. The social composition of the deputies is curious: 
eight were managers, five were teachers, four were businessmen, 
three were scientific associates, three were representatives of 
public organizations, and one, an office employee. Not a single 
worker was among the candidates who were elected. Among the 
deputies there is not a single representative of the fairer sex. 
All five women who entered the second round suffered defeat by 
their male competitors. 
  The deputy chairman of the city electoral commission, R.G. 
Malova, noted that the situation was calmer in the second round 
of the elections. There were no serious complaints or 
grievances. In Rita Grigoryevna's opinion, the voters made 
their choice, which was significantly different from the results 
of the first round, on the basis of television and radio 
debates, which helped the Petersburgers to get to know the 
candidates directly. 
  According to observations of the state electoral commission, 
it was mostly the older generation who voted and there were 
practically no youth at the precincts except a certain number of 
students and military servicemen. 
  A very strange situation developed in the 39th electoral 
district of Oktyabrskiy Rayon. As we know, the state electoral 
commission kept an eye out for violations when the results of 
the first round of voting were being summed up. According to 
information from the chairman of the city electoral commission, 
V.I. Fomichev, only 20,030 people voted here during 20-21 March, 
while there are 80,875 voters registered in Oktyabrskiy Rayon. 
Thus, the necessary 25 percent did not participate in the first 
round of voting. On these grounds the city electoral commission 
declared the first round of elections in the 39th district to be 
null and void. But the city's mayor, A.A. Sobchak, subsequently 
overrode the decision of the city commission, and on 3 April 
there was a repeat vote in this district as well. But the city 
electoral commission did not intend to take these results into 
account. 
  V.I. Fomichev thinks that the city acted in keeping with the 
Statute on Elections to the City Assembly within the limits of 
its authority and that no official has the right to override its 
decision. This can be done only though the courts. 
  Thus another has been added to the many points of confusion 
regarding the past elections.

<F P=106> [Article by Viktoriya Rabotnova: "Shall We Begin at the </F>
Beginning?"] 
  [Text] The Council of Electoral Associations has confirmed 
its statement of 21 March, which discusses the illegality of the 
spring elections to the City Assembly. The council continues to 
insist on conducting in 1994 truly democratic elections to the 
deputy corps, combining the voting with a poll of the population 
concerning confidence in the mayor of St. Petersburg. 
  It is worth noting that the petition was signed not only by 
those who lost but also by the "City We Love" movement, whose 
candidates won in five districts, and also the "Our City -- Our 
Home" and "Unity for Progress" movements, which also achieved a 
certain amount of success. As we know, Aleksandr Shelkanov has 
not changed his opinion about the illegality of the elections, 
but the representatives of "Democratic Unity," "Business St. 
Petersburg," and "All St. Petersburg" still hold the opposite 
viewpoint. 
  Incidentally, the leaders of "Democratic Unity" are now in 
Moscow--the question of the elections in our city is expected to 
be discussed at today's session of the State Duma.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yevgeniy Nazdratenko, governor of Maritime </F>
Kray, by Yelena Belykh; place and date not given: "Extricating 
Ourselves From the Captivity of Dead Schemes"] 
  [Text] Despite all of life's burdens which fall to the lot 
of the "average" Maritimer, one virtue of existence in the 
province by the sea is indisputable -- things are tranquil here. 
The political battles in the capital roll down to us in gentle 
waves, fortunately. But the social peace is fragile. 
  In terms of per capita income the Maritime area is in last 
place in the region. The gap between rich and poor is growing. A 
bank employee receives 2.5 times more than a worker, three times 
more than a teacher, and four times more than a peasant. The two 
minimums -- wage and subsistence -- differ from one another tens 
of times over. How to beat back the wave of growing social 
tension and prevent the eruption of a "rebellion senseless and 
pitiless"? Our correspondent took this question to a surgery on 
personal matters at the residence of Ye. Nazdratenko, governor 
of the kray. 
  [Belykh] Yevgeniy Ivanovich, on her resignation Ella 
Pamfilova, minister of social protection, told the press that 
she could not deceive people. The government was adopting 
another decree, as a result of which a quantity of watermarked 
notes would be printed. They are distributed to the poor, but 
frequently only when prices have exceeded the posted price many 
times over. What is there for needy Maritimers to hope for? 
  [Nazdratenko] The realism of government decrees is a painful 
subject. Is there, say, a decree on privileges for the 
casualties from the accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power 
Station? Yes, and very handsome it is. Has the government 
allocated the region money? Not one ruble. People are coming to 
us, to the administration, for help--there is no money. Is there 
a decree on officers discharged into the reserve, on apartments 
being built for them? Yes. And there is inflation, which is 
devouring the funds which were at one time allocated. One 
apartment instead of five--that's the arithmetic. The list could 
be continued ad infinitum. Take if only the first edict of the 
president on education and the way it has been fulfilled. 
  All this cannot fail to stoke the people's exasperation. 
This 
runs counter to my inner convictions, incidentally. Remember one 
of the numerous promises of Gaydar--the favorite of young people 
and the West, the personification of progressive thinking? "Only 
bikers will feel the increase in the price of fuel." It has been 
felt by retirees--the most defenseless group of society. We, the 
kray, have been able to cover them, reduce the prices, and allow 
gasoline benefits. We are posting the militia, we are posting 
the Special Militia so that the elderly individual may fill up 
in peace and not be humiliated by the "leather" boys. He rides 
away, and half a kilometer further on that same junior mafioso 
stops him and siphons off the gasoline. Who is to blame? 
  [Belykh] Nazdratenko, naturally. When people voted for the 
new constitution, for continuation of the reforms, they voted 
for you also. 
  [Nazdratenko] I am not sure that if a ballot were conducted 
now, I would collect as many white balls, but I would ask people 
to believe in one thing--the sincerity of my motives when I 
attempt to do something. We are working on a decree on the 
economic status of the kray. We are not demanding direct 
financial infusions into a moribund economy, but release us from 
the captivity of dead schemes born of anonymous government 
officials somewhere in Moscow! Afford us an opportunity to 
manage preferential quantity regulation and licensing! The 
Yaroslavskiy Mining and Concentrating Works is at a 
standstill--people have no earnings, the community is dying. 
Grant it the opportunity to sell products in a profitable 
manner, and people will have money. Money, not "compensation 
payments." The infrastructure would be restored, the social 
sphere would revive. 
  [Belykh] The same hopes were placed in Government Decree 
1001. 
  [Nazdratenko] True, but who torpedoed this decree? It was 
buried here, in the Maritime region, by Bytov and Cherepkov. I 
was accused of blackmailing the government. The same thing will 
probably be repeated with the decree. According to the 
principle: "If a man exists, you can pin something on him." The 
business of the tanker filled with radioactive waste. 
"Nazdratenko is lobbying a Japanese company!" Very well, you 
don't want a cleanup by the Japanese for free, within 20 days? 
Accept the alternative--18 months of construction for over $2 
million. But the kray would not pay this. I have no intention of 
taking crumbs from pensions and children's compensation to pay 
some firm in Moscow for secretaries and private residences. 
  Yes, I am a lobbyist. I lobby for the interests of the 
Maritimers. Only not those who roll around in Mercedes and talk 
with competitors in the language of lampoons and grenades. The 
interests of normal working people, who bring their troubles to 
my surgery. Whom we, the authorities, are required to provide 
with a normal peaceful life.

  [Text] The government of the self-styled Republic of 
Transdniestria [Dniester] supports the idea of setting up a 
Russian military base on the basis of the Russian 14th Army, 
Transdniestrian state secretary Valeriy Litskay told INTERFAX on 
Monday. However, there has been no official proposal from 
Moscow yet, he said. 
  Litskay stressed that the base question and the future of 
Transdniestria could be discussed in parallel at bilateral talks 
with Moldova. The latest round of talks on 9 April gives the 
chance for settling the dispute, Litskay said. And he added 
that the emergence of a Russian Army base in Transdniestria 
could help resolve many controversial issues.

<F P=106> [Report by Boris Bronshteyn: "Tatar Oilmen on the Verge of </F>
Bankruptcy"] 
  [Text] Kazan -- A financial crisis has arisen in the 
Tatneft Joint-Stock Company. Consumers' debts, which totalled 
197 billion rubles [R] at the beginning of the year, have 
reached R343 billion. The Tatneft leadership has been forced to 
take extraordinary measures. 
  IZVESTIYA's correspondent was told in Tatneft's public 
relations department that the work of drilling teams, teams for 
the underground and capital repair of wells, and of production 
facilities and shops not directly engaged in the extraction and 
preparation of oil was suspended for six weeks from the 
beginning of April. Employees of the production facilities, 
which have been halted, are being granted administrative leave 
with payment of the minimum wage. 
  The situation is exacerbated by the fact that sulfur-bearing 
oil has entirely ceased to be pumped to Kremenchug Oil Refinery 
owing to uncertainties in relations between Ukraine and Russia. 
This has made it necessary to halt all extraction of 
sulfur-bearing oil, which was being extracted from 5,300 wells. 
  The 50th anniversary of the opening of the first oil field 
on 
the Republic's territory was celebrated in Tataria [Tatarstan] 
last fall. This is only the third year that Tataria, which 
proclaimed the underground wealth to be its own property, has 
been independently exporting oil (within the quota agreed with 
Russia). The stake on petrodollars was very high when 
formulating and realizing the ideas of the republic's 
sovereignty. The proceeds from oil sales helped to soften the 
entry into the market for Tataria's inhabitants. But today, the 
oil sector's indicators are simply joyless. Suffice it to say 
that oil extraction in the first quarter of this year fell by 
1.8 million tonnes compared with the same period last year. 
  Oilmen believe that only concerted action by Tataria and 
Russia can ensure a way out of the grave crisis.

<F P=106> [Report by I. Mikhaylov: "In the Sea of Japan, For All </F>
That!: That's Where Our Liquid Radioactive Waste Will End Up, It 
Would Seem"] 
  [Text] Journalists of Vladivostok and also foreign 
correspondents accredited in the kray center satisfied 
themselves of this once again at a news conference conducted by 
Ye. Stomatyuk, chairman of the Natural Resources Committee of 
the administration of the kray. It is he, incidentally, who was 
head of the kray interdepartmental commission inspecting the 
state of radiation safety in the handling of radioactive waste 
at the Zvezda Plant, which was in the city of Bolshoy Kamen on 
30 March of this year. 
  Quite a lot has already been written about this problem 
(KRASNOYE ZNAMYA of 17 February, "Nuclear Scrapes," and of 31 
March, "Large Dollar Sum for Moscow," and a mass of publications 
in the local and central papers), and I will emphasize merely 
that the above commission reached yet again the conclusion 
concerning the impossibility of the storage of liquid 
radioactive waste in the current tanks in direct proximity to a 
center of population. The situation has deteriorated 
particularly at TNT-5, at which leaks were discovered. A real 
threat of radioactive contamination hangs over the waters of the 
Gulf of Ussuriysk and Bolshoy Kamen Bay, especially since the 
development of an emergency situation is expected in April-May 
with the arrival of settled warmth. 
  The commission recommended in May that the liquid 
radioactive 
waste be dumped in the Sea of Japan at the points determined in 
the 1980's. It had not been considered possible doing this 
earlier on account of the fact that the liquid radioactive waste 
had frozen to a thickness of 60-70 cm. And, second, the urgent 
building of repositories and an industrial plant for 
decontaminating and reprocessing the liquid radioactive waste. 
  The first recommendation could be canceled if in the very 
near future Moscow either allocates the funds for the designated 
construction or permits Japanese firms to embark on the 
realization of their own proposals. In this case the tankers 
would temporarily be taken to a place presenting no danger to 
people's lives. 
  Journalists had attempted to take part in the work of the 
commission, incidentally, but the Pacific Fleet representative 
barred them from the liquid radioactive waste storage sites. And 
the question at the news conference as to whether the Pacific 
Fleet would submit to a decision of the administration on the 
dumping of liquid radioactive waste in the Sea of Japan if such 
were adopted was not inappropriate in this connection. According 
to the Constitution, the fleet is required to submit inasmuch as 
local authorities are entitled, when it comes to questions of 
the environment, to adopt independent decisions, but Russia has 
yet to act so rectilinearly in accordance with the law. It is 
not known what Moscow will tell the Pacific Fleet. 
  The work force of the Zvezda Plant and the population of the 
city of Bolshoy Kamen will have something to say also, for that 
matter. I believe that their opinion cannot be relegated to the 
bottom of the pile.

  [Text] Madrid April 12 TASS -- Russia so far does not link 
the Bosnian situation with the Russian joining of NATO's 
Partnership for Peace program, Russian President Boris Yeltsin 
told a news conference here today. However, Russia does not 
hurry to sign the program. 
  Speaking of relations with the Serbs, the president noted 
the 
most important now is to prevent them from greater confrontation 
and further combat operations. Yeltsin said they are working in 
this sphere and Russian representative Vitaliy Churkin is 
permanently staying in the conflict zone. As need be Russian 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev may leave for the conflict zone 
on Thursday. 
  If greater confrontation is prevented and the crisis is 
discussed at political negotiations, there will be no more 
bombing. A political way out of the situation should be found 
through negotiations; "force will not solve the problem, it will 
be an eternal war. Those who did the bombing will be 
responsible in case of aggravation," stressed the president.

  [Excerpts] The news conference in the Moncloa palace given 
by Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez and Russian leader Boris 
Yeltsin, has just ended. [passage omitted] The situation in 
Bosnia and the allied air strikes were obvious subjects dealt 
with by Felipe Gonzalez and Boris Yeltsin. Angel Garcia reports 
from the Moncloa Palace: 
  [Garcia] Boris Yeltsin made clear reference to the situation 
in Bosnia-Herzegovia. Yeltsin expressed his discontent and 
disagreement to U.S. President Bill Clinton and he also said 
that only a negotiated solution could be considered and he ruled 
out the use of force in Bosnia. At the same time he said that 
if the conflict escalated, responsibility would fall on those 
who have carried out these attacks. However, according to 
Yeltsin, the most important factor in the situation in 
Yugoslavia is to keep the Serbs away from the military 
confrontation. 
  [Begin Yeltsin recording in Russian with superimposed 
Spanish 
translation by Garcia] Our envoy Vitaliy Churkin is already 
there, Yeltsin says, and perhaps it will be necessary to send 
Foreign Minister Kozyrev there the day after tomorrow to ensure 
that the Serbs stay away from the military confrontation. [end 
recording] 
  [Garcia] Yeltsin also referred to NATO's peace association 
and he said that they were in no hurry to sign that document.

spoke in favor of bringing to the conflict zone additional 
ground troops for peacekeeping. Pavel Grachev noted at the same 
time that the conflicting sides should retreat to their previous 
positions, so that a demilitarized zone could be created.

  The results of the visit consist in a number of economic 
pledges undertaken by Japan: Tokyo has promised to give money 
for Kazakh disarmament measures ($11 million) and announced the 
opening of two credit lines for Kazakhstan (to a total value of 
$220 million in the form of yen credits), as well as the 
possibility of providing $70 million in the future for the 
development of railroads and $55 million to combat atmospheric 
pollution at Ekibastuz. In addition, Japan has decided to 
allocate funds to insure Japanese firms' trading operations in 
Kazakhstan (a reference, in particular, to Karaganda, where the 
Japanese are involved in metallurgical projects). 
  The list appears impressive, but the trouble is that the 
Japanese have given Alma-Ata [Almaty] only what they wanted to 
and not what Kazakhstan was asking for. Although the Kazakh 
president spoke hopefully of a series of contacts and talks with 
representatives of the business world here on a number of major 
economic projects in the Republic, large-scale Japanese 
participation in Kazakh economic affairs is perceived at present 
only as a remote prospect. According to statistics, last year 
Kazakhstan's trade with Japan amounted to a modest $37 million, 
and the number of projects in which real Japanese investment is 
involved is in single figures -- three. The Kazakhstani side's 
appeals for investment flows to be increased met with 
understanding in Tokyo, but at the same time the Japanese 
explained to the guests that it is necessary to improve the 
investment climate in the Republic, improve legislation, and 
carry out other routine work. 
  Nazarbayev defined the building of economic "bridges" with 
Japan as the chief task of his trip. At the same time political 
aspects were also touched on during the talks -- the situation 
in the CIS and in Central Asia and relations with Russia. 
Nazarbayev pointed out at a meeting with reporters that the 
origins of the present desperately complex situation in the 
former Soviet republics must be sought in the political mistakes 
made earlier -- when the Belovezhskaya Forest agreements were 
being prepared, and during the collapse of the ruble zone. The 
Kazakh president mentioned this with bitterness, placing the 
main emphasis on the desire to maintain stability and to see the 
present reforms to a successful fulfillment. At the same time 
he emphasized that the Russian reforms' successes are important 
above all else. "In Russia," Nazarbayev said, "it is necessary 
to support the reforms and stabilization, not individual 
politicians. It is important for the whole world that the 
processes of democratization and economic transformations 
triumph in Russia." 
  Tokyo tried to establish what the leader of Kazakhstan had 
in 
mind when he advanced the concept of creating a Eurasian Union 
in place of the CIS. It turned out that Nazarbayev had nothing 
"in mind" -- according to him, it was an idea which had not yet 
been developed and which was spoken aloud at a meeting with 
Moscow State University students.

  [Text] Uzbekistan's President Islam Karimov has withdrawn 
Russian banknotes from circulation and banned their acceptance 
as payment as of 15 April. The decree he signed on Monday aims 
at better money circulation and greater purchasing power of the 
sum-coupon, the national currency. In the meantime, anyone, 
regardless of what he or she owns, will be able to sell goods or 
provide services for hard currency, provided they have cash 
registers. 
  As of 15 April, the exchange rate of the sum-coupon to 
foreign currencies will be fixed at the end of regular 
republican currency auctions. So far, this rate has been 
modelled on data from Russia's Central Bank. 
  In line with the decree, a chain of currency exchanges will 
be set up across the Republic, and individuals will be allowed 
to trade money by a central bank license. 
  All enterprises, private and state-owned alike, will have to 
sell to the Central Bank 30 percent of their currency revenues, 
of which 10 percent must be purchased by the Finance Ministry 
for the Republic's monetary fund and 5 percent by the government 
of Karakalpakia (an autonomy within Uzbekistan) and by regional 
administrations for their local monetary funds. 
  As of 1 May, accounts with enterprises in former USSR 
republics will be settled exclusively on a clearing basis or in 
hard currency. Currently in Tashkent one ruble trades to 10-11 
sum-coupons and one dollar to 20,000-22,000 sum-coupons.

  [Text] Three people were killed and nine wounded as a 
result of an Azerbaijani bomb attack on Karabakh's capital of 
Stepanakert on April 10, the press service of the Karabakh 
Defense Army told Interfax. Three bombs hit the center of the 
city. A woman and her two children -- a 7-year-old boy and 
12-year-old girl -- were killed. Many buildings were ruined. 
  On the same day, bombs were dropped on other populated areas 
of Nagorno Karabakh. The number of casualties is being 
verified. The air-raid warning was sounded seven times in 
Stepanakert on April 11, but no bomb attacks were carried out by 
Azerbaijani forces. Informed sources in Stepanakert report that 
bombs might have been dropped on other populated areas. 
According to the press service, fierce fighting has continued 
for two days now in the north of Karabakh's Mardakert Region, 
where the Azerbijani forces launched a large-scale offensive on 
April 10. 
  Meanwhile, a source in the Azerbaijani Defense Ministry 
reports that Armenian formations tried to launch an attack 
yesterday in the southern section of the front, in the Fizuli 
Region and on the border with Azerbijan's Beilagan Region. Baku 
says the attack was checked and Armenian units were forced back 
to their initial positions.

  [Text] Kiev, 9 April (AFP) -- Russian sailors arrested the 
Ukrainian Navy's number two after his coastguards were prevented 
from boarding a survey vessel of the disputed Black Sea Fleet, a 
Ukrainian Navy spokesman said Saturday. 
  The Navy's Deputy Commander in Chief, Nikolay Zhibarev, was 
held overnight Friday [8 April] when he boarded the ship as it 
left the Ukrainian port of Odessa for Sevastopol, the Fleet's 
base in Crimea, with a Russian Navy crew at the helm, the 
spokesman said. 
  The vessel was fitted with ocean survey and radio-navigation 
equipment valued at 10 million dollars, the spokesman said. 
  Ukrainian coastguards tried to board the vessel because it 
had been "illegally" moved from its berth, but Zhibarev was 
arrested by Russian sailors called as reinforcements from 
Odessa, the spokesman added. 
  The same source added that the Russian sailors had been 
ordered to shoot if necessary to retain control of the ship. 
  At Sevastopol, top officials of the Fleet, which is based in 
the autonomous Ukrainian republic of Crimea but under the de 
facto control of the Russian Navy, said they had no information 
on the arrest of Zhibarev. 
  Fleet spokesman Andrey Grachev added that the ship "was not 
examined by the coastguards because it was operating within a 
Fleet deployment zone and was travelling from one Ukrainian port 
to another." 
  Grachev said Ukraine had not paid for the survey equipment, 
which had therefore needed to be returned to Sevastopol.

  [Text] Kiev, 10 Apr [date as received] -- Ivan Plyushch, 
chairman of Ukraine's Supreme Council, has spoken on television. 
He said, in particular: 
  "...The new parliament's priority is to form a government 
that will assume full executive power and work to stabilize the 
socioeconomic situation, elect a head of government, decide 
whether he should be the head of the executive power branch (and 
I adhere to the view that the prime minister should be the head 
of executive power) and instruct him to form a working 
government within the shortest possible period of time. 
  "Another priority step would be to amend the law on the 
president. We need to decide what the president of Ukraine 
should do, and then pass a law on the powers of local power 
bodies dividing powers and functions between the central and 
local executive power bodies..." 
  In reply to a question on Ukraine's relations with the CIS, 
Plyushch said: "A summit of CIS heads of state is due to be 
held soon, and Leonid Makarovych Kravchuk will go there with a 
whole package of proposals on the integration of our economic 
system with other countries."

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: Igor Porshnev, </F>
Vitaly Trubetskoi and others] 
  [Text] The Russo-Latvian summit, scheduled for April 20, is 
out of the question until Russian President Boris Yeltsin 
formally disavows his order on the setting up of military bases 
in Latvia, that country's Foreign Minister Georgs Andrejevs told 
Interfax. He added that even contacts of state delegations were 
impossible. 
  Latvia cannot be satisfied with the explanations provided by 
Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev or Defense Minister Pavel 
Grachev who did not write the order or even know of its 
existence, Andrejevs emphasized. 
  In his words, Latvia's painful response to the incident is 
largely attributable to the domestic political situation in the 
country. Andrejevs said that the Russian authorities had to be 
aware of the fact that the document on military bases in Latvia 
had fueled the Latvian radical opposition which had been taking 
a dim view of the agreements between the two countries. Now 
President Guntis Ulmanis had to do his best to have the passion 
calm and find the best possible solution. 
  Andrejevs said that it would never be late to hold a summit 
and sign the initialed agreement on withdrawal of Russian troops 
from Latvia. He admitted that even though the incident with the 
presidential order had not contributed to better Russo-Latvian 
relations, Latvia had no alternative to moving forward to 
signing an agreement with Russia.

<F P=106> [Report by Valeriy Orlov under the "Regional Elections" </F>
rubric: "The People of the Volga Have Expressed Support for `The 
Party of Power'"] 
  [Text] Niznhiy Novgorod -- Election fever has been raging 
for almost two months in Nizhniy Novgorod. With what outcome? 
The City Duma elections were declared valid in just 16 of the 
34 districts. The enthusiasm of the city's inhabitants was 
dampened by the postponement of elections for the mayor of 
Niznhiy Novgorod and the referendum on the city's charter. 
  The results of the formation of the oblast parliament are 
more indicative and objective. There were 206 candidates 
running for 45 seats. The overwhelming majority of them were 
not affiliated to any party. But, among the candidates as a 
whole, quite a different affiliation, not registered anywhere, 
"appeared" of its own accord -- the "party of power." It is 
made up of officials from the executive structures: rayon and 
city administration heads and department and administration 
staffers. 
  One noticeable aspect of the Nizhniy Novgorod elections was 
the appearance of the "Spring" Alliance. This association of 
young entrepreneurs backed a large group of its colleagues to 
run as candidates. The "Spring" Alliance, sparing no expense, 
tested the suitability of Western standards of political 
advertising on the Nizhniy Novgorod public. The entire election 
campaign conducted by "Spring" was like a carnival. Air 
balloons were launched, bright posters displayed, and "star" 
concerts organized, and the opportunities offered by local radio 
and television were used extensively. 
  The overall results of the elections for the Oblast 
Legislative Assembly read as follows: 32 deputies out of 45 
were elected. Of these, 19, or 42 percent, were administration 
heads and their deputies ("party of power"); 7, or 16 percent, 
were economic managers; and 6, or 13 percent, were journalists, 
scientists, and trade union officials. People are tired of 
fruitless political rhetoric. They want to live normal lives, 
and pin their hope on people exercising actual power and 
experienced in economic management, and it is for them that the 
people of Nizhniy Novgorod voted.

  [Text] The Russian parliament's Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin 
group said it would vote against the draft budget for 1994, 
"since it fails to meet our priorities in economic and social 
policy." 
  Explaining the reasons for the decision in a statement 
issued 
on Sunday, the group says the budget would increase taxes, 
contains no provision for measures to stop the decline of 
production, for structural reforms, for support for private 
business enterprise, for the reorganization of insolvent 
enterprises, for any changes in industrial policy, for 
demonopolization, for a better social policy, for any measures 
to improve the situation in the armed forces, or for the 
insufficient financing of public education and preschool health 
care, but would increase administrative expenditure. 
  The economic policy guidelines that the draft budget lays 
provide no basis for further reforms or for solving Russia's 
acute problems, the group says. It says it is going to propose 
that the government amend the budget within the next month and 
put it before parliament every quarter to make it possible to 
adjust it to new developments.

not covered by some of the social guarantees granted in the 
presidential decree of 23 September 1993. 
  The list includes those former deputies who had not stopped 
attending the sessions of the former Supreme Soviet before 3 
October and participated in mass disturbances on 3-4 October or 
who incited those disturbances. 
  The head of the presidential administration recalled that 
the 
presidential decree of 6 October 1993 instructed him personally 
to "establish which persons are not to be covered by the present 
decree..., to make decisions single-handedly in the event of any 
disputes." 
  Filatov said that the persons on the list would not receive 
the lump-sum allowance amounting to a yearly salary, calculated 
on the basis of the monthly salary at the moment when the 
deputies' powers were terminated. In his words, it is a 
question of 3 to 4 million rubles to be allocated to each deputy 
out of the state budget, out of the people's money. As for 
transferring accommodations in Moscow to the ownership of former 
deputies, this issue will be dealt with on an individual basis, 
the head of the presidential administration said. 
  He also stressed that "Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov is not a 
man to give away municipal apartments for free", each worth 
between 60,000 and 70,000 dollars at market rates. "Otherwise, 
it will be difficult to explain to Muscovites why we are 
allowing those who incited a civil war to retain their 
accommodations," Filatov said.

<F P=106> ["Statement No. 2 of the Appeal Court for Information </F>
Disputes under the Russian Federation President Concerning the 
Publication of So-Called `Scenario No. 1' in OBSHCHAYA GAZETA" 
-- ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA headline] 
  [Text] On 19 March, OBSHCHAYA GAZETA published the 
so-called "Scenario No. 1" concerning an alleged coup d'etat in 
preparation. The document caused public excitement and prompted 
a torrent of articles in the newspapers, broadcast reports, and 
also statements by officials. The Russian Federation Committee 
for the Press officially warned OBSHCHAYA GAZETA (founder and 
chief editor Ye.V. Yakovlev) that "its actions are perceived as 
a deliberate step aimed at destabilizing society and undermining 
constitutional authority." 
  The Appeal Court has started receiving requests from 
citizens 
and the media asking it to speak out on the publication of 
so-called "Scenario No. 1" in OBSHCHAYA GAZETA and assess 
whether it was, on the one hand, freedom of expression or, on 
the other hand, an abuse of mass media freedom. 
  The Appeal Court examined the case of the publication of 
"Scenario No. 1" by OBSHCHAYA GAZETA and the subsequent items in 
various publications and statements by officials and saw fit to 
make the following statement: 
  OBSHCHAYA GAZETA had rather substantial grounds for 
publishing "Scenario No. 1" of an alleged coup d'etat in 
preparation. The promulgation of this material was preceded by 
a statement by a number of well-known politicians concerning the 
threat of a "palace coup," to the effect that "signs of a coup 
are already in evidence" and that "analytical memoranda are 
circulating and various coup scenarios are being discussed." 
All this was causing agitation in society and giving rise to 
rumors and conjecture. It was in these conditions of social 
tension that the OBSHCHAYA GAZETA editorial board decided to 
publish "Scenario No. 1." The subsequent reaction shows that it 
did not destabilize society, but defused the political 
situation. Even supposing that actions were actually being 
prepared, they were prevented to some extent by the publication 
of the "Scenario." The world has known of cases where a leak of 
information has prevented state upheavals, while dismissal of 
information has resulted in tragedy. 
  The Appeal Court believes that by publishing "Scenario No. 
1" 
OBSHCHAYA GAZETA did not break the Law on the Mass Media. The 
newspaper was right to inform citizens of actions in the offing 
or of insinuations about such actions. 
  Nor can the publication of "Scenario No. 1" be seen as 
sensation-seeking, whereby information authenticity would be 
sacrificed. An editorial note plainly states: "Most likely 
what we have here is an obvious hoax, a 'letter of incitement.'" 
In other words, the editorial board's attitude toward 
publication was a balanced one. This is also indicated by the 
unsensational way in which the material was presented. 
  Criminal proceedings have been instituted over the 
publication and an investigation is in progress, the results of 
which are not yet known. So far it has not been established 
whether the "Scenario" is a letter of incitement or instance of 
political hooliganism, or if it has a real basis. Thus, the 
Appeal Court has refrained from drawing any hasty conclusions 
about the authenticity of the publication. In this connection, 
the Appeal Court also regards as premature certain assessments 
of the actions of the OBSHCHAYA GAZETA editorial board, and in 
particular the taking of administrative action against it. 
  [signed] Appeal Court Chairman A. Vengerov 
  [dated] Moscow, 4 April.

<F P=106> [Article by Valeriy Zorkin: "Concerning the Accord </F>
Agreement. Valeriy Zorkin: `The Most Important Question Is the 
Effectiveness of the Authorities Themselves'"] 
  [Excerpts] The publication in recent days of various texts 
designed to raise to a formal level the idea of national accord 
which is now prevalent in society is in danger of turning into a 
regular race around Sadovoye Koltso for the National 
Reconciliation Prize. This idea, which has enormous 
constructive potential, is for some reason being deliberately 
steered away from broad public discussion, and because of the 
vagueness, formalism, and incomprehensibility -- to ordinary 
people -- of the proposed "memorandums," it is becoming the 
subject of haggling among just a small group of politicians. 
[passage omitted] 
  If this or that draft agreement is not to become just 
another 
ideological one-day wonder, the following must be borne in mind. 
A national accord is a kind of social contract, a public 
agreement on certain principles or measures capable of pulling 
the country back from the brink of the abyss. It is not a deal 
made by the political elite behind the people's back, but a 
compromise among the main political forces expressing the 
people's own vital interests. And it should not be an agreement 
between robber and robbed, but a broad public understanding that 
without the immediate implementation of concrete priority 
measures the country cannot be prevented from drifting into 
national disaster. And the role of the authorities in this 
compromise is a distinct and, I would say, subordinate role. 
  The authorities do not impose their own terms from above, by 
means of a decree, on the basis of their own selfish, narrow 
party interests; they face the people with an admission of their 
mistake in leading society into an impasse, at the same time 
proposing a carefully thought-out change of political course in 
order to implement priority anticrisis actions. If the 
authorities are not prerpared to take this fundamentally 
important step, any agreement naturally becomes, for them, a 
"mandate" to further plunder and ruin the country. 
  To avoid the abyss, harsh measures are needed, but measures 
based on strict compliance with the law and on society's 
consent. This latter is no less important in that without that 
consent any strong-arm solutions, including a state of 
emergency, will be futile and ineffective in a huge country like 
Russia. 
  The most important question now is the effectiveness of the 
authorities themselves; without this, it is impossible to 
restore order in the country. The first steps toward an 
agreement on national reconciliation and society's consent for 
these authorities specifically to implement anticrisis measures 
should be rigorous discipline in the state apparatus and a curb 
on corruption and arbitrary bureaucratic rule. 
  The second key question on which an accord has already 
developed in society is that of halting the wave of crime 
involving "shoot-outs" among mafiosi groups in public places, 
causing mass casualties among innocent people, even children. 
Society itself is prepared for a redistribution of the meager 
resources available in the country in order to create a 
protective environment and curb the rampant crime which is 
encouraged by the chaos that prevails in the power structures. 
But in that case, one wonders, what use are ineffective 
authorities to a society that is forced to act on its own 
account? 
  The third key question should be that of an accord on urgent 
economic measures. It is necessary to prevent the economic 
bankruptcy of the state, with all the ensuing economic and 
social problems (such as the nonpayments crisis, the shutdown of 
industry, the lack of resources for agricultural operations or 
for wages). A fourth problem on which a national accord has 
already formed is that of resolute actions to restore the 
destroyed links between the former Union republics, as well as 
translating to a practical plane the work of recreating a new 
union statehood on a strictly voluntary basis. Especially since 
initiatives in this direction come not only from Moscow, but 
also from Alma-Ata [Almaty], Minsk, and the capitals of other 
former republics. 
  Naturally one can speak of the existence of a social 
consensus on questions of preventing the destruction of Russia's 
intellectual potential, support for enterprise geared to the 
national interest, etc. Concrete proposals have been in 
existence on all these matters for a long time. All that is 
needed is the desire on the part of the authorities and the 
existence of the will, the capacity to fulfill them. 
  All in all, accord is possible only on the basis of a change 
in the catastrophic course imposed by the radical "democrats."

<F P=106> [Interview with former General Prosecutor Aleksey Kazannik </F>
by Stanislav Bartnikas under the "Reporting the Details" rubric; 
date and place not given: "It Was Recommended That I Send 
Khasbulatov and Rutskoy to the Firing Squad. Latest Revelations 
by Former General Prosecutor Aleksey Kazannik"] 
  [Text] [Bartnikas] Did anyone put pressure on you during 
the discussion of the question of the general prosecutor in the 
Federation Council? 
  [Kazannik] I think that everyone had already realized that 
it was impossible to put any pressure on me. To buy me off or 
offer me positions. But when I was general prosecutor, they did 
try. For instance, they said: So you have got yourself an 
apartment; why waste your time, let us furnish it for you for 
free. I refused. But in the present case no one pressurized 
me. On the other hand, I know that the president's 
administration worked at the highest level with many deputies 
and tried to persuade them to vote only for the dismissal of 
Kazannik. But I wish it to be noted that deputies are more 
law-abiding than the president and his team. And in the vote 
two motives prevailed -- the purely legal, and the moral. 
  [Bartnikas] Yes, but after all, the question of the general 
prosecutor was by no means closed by your dismissal.... 
  [Kazannik] Agreed, a far from straightforward situation will 
arise. The point is that there is no provision for an acting 
general prosecutor either in the Constitution or in the Law on 
the General Prosecutor. Only the general prosecutor's deputies 
can perform his duties in his absence, and only in accordance 
with the general prosecutor's own directives. An outsider 
simply cannot do this. But this is evidently no obstacle for 
the president, although difficult legal problems arise here. 
For instance, supposing it is necessary to extend a period of 
detention in custody to 18 months -- that is the exclusive 
prerogative of the general prosecutor. Suppose that Ilyushenko 
extends this term; then any lawyer will state that it is 
illegal. And the accused will be immediately released from the 
detention center. 
  [Bartnikas] Do you think that the disputes over the general 
prosecutor are linked primarily with a desire on the part of the 
president's team to have a puppet Prosecutor's Office, or is it 
simply a matter of personal dislike? 
  [Kazannik] I think that they have one wish -- to be able to 
telephone the Prosecutor's Office and say: Don't do this or 
that. And I am sure that, had Ilyushenko been general prosecutor 
during the amnesty period, he would have released no one. After 
all, he obeys not only Yeltsin's orders, but even Kozhakov's 
(chief of the Russian Federation president's security service -- 
editor's note). And after all, the president's entourage put 
very strong pressure on us. For example, immediately following 
the October events, the Prosecutor's Office received from the 
president's administration instructions on how the investigation 
should be conducted. These instructions ran more or less as 
follows. No political trials should be conducted. No 
investigation team should be set up, but rather just five or six 
investigators should be assigned. The October events should be 
investigated within three to four days, everyone should be 
charged under Articles 102 and 17 -- that is to say for 
complicity to murder -- and the cases should be handed over to 
the military collegium for criminal affairs. The trial should 
last two to three days, and everyone should be sentenced to the 
death penalty. These documents were unsigned. But imagine what 
another prosecutor would have done in my position who might have 
said: It must be done; how simple everything is. I did not 
allow this. 
  [Bartnikas] Are you not sorry to leave your post? 
  [Kazannik] Yes, I leave with regret. The post is not the 
point, nor are the privileges. I thought that I would be able 
to deal a serious blow to crime, including organized crime. But 
the latter cannot exist without corruption of the state 
apparatus. After all, how come that people in the MVD [Ministry 
of Internal Affairs] say: We know the location of around 15,000 
bands, but we do not possess more detailed information. I am 
curious to know how it can be that people know the ringleaders 
by sight, they know their aliases and so forth, but they are 
still at large. And therefore I planned to check how the law on 
operational investigations activity is observed in all regions. 
I think that we would have determined why the MVD does not have 
the relevant information or does not want to have it. In 
addition, I wanted to reform the General Prosecutor's Office -- 
I wanted to reduce the central apparatus by one-half; after all, 
we have many departments where people are worn out through 
having nothing to do. However, I think that it would not have 
been possible to have remained an honest prosecutor. 
  [Bartnikas] And one last question -- have you handed in your 
credentials? 
  [Kazannik] Not yet. Incidentally, Acting General Prosecutor 
Ilyushenko fired me as long ago as 15 March -- either he has a 
poor grasp of legislation, or he was fulfilling an order from 
the Kremlin. In the near future I will take all my documents 
from the Prosecutor's Office, but I will be obliged to hand over 
the Russian general prosecutor's credentials.

  [Text] Russian President Boris Yeltsin's book, entitled 
"Notes of a President" is being prepared for publication. It 
will come out in Russia and have more than 400 pages with the 
text and 90 pages with illustrations. The book consists of 10 
chapters: 
  "A Normal Country. Russia in May to December 1990." 
  "Independence. January 1991." 
  "The Collapse of the Empire. September to December 1991." 
  "After the Putsch." 
  "Russia and the World. January to August 1992." 
  "The Shock Therapy. September 1992 to March 1993." 
  "Run of Bad Luck. April to July 1993." 
  "The Dramatic Summer. August and September 1993." 
  "The Dramatic Autumn." 
  "Premature Results." 
  The final chapters, which contain Yeltsin's story about how 
the plan for the neutralization of the White House was conceived 
and developed, are particularly interesting today. The author 
writes that Russian fascists idolizing Hitler and his idea, 
fought their first battle near the walls of the White House. 
  "The White House sent out signals which were pushing people 
to the most horrible things: arsons, murder and plunder. Here 
in the White House, a Russian rebellion - senseless and 
merciless - was provoked, prepared and meticulously planned 
under the cover of the lofty title 'political opposition'." 
  "No one was forcing officer Rutskoy, or Professor 
Khasbulatov, who consider themselves politicians with high moral 
principles, to use the neo-fascists' services," writes Yeltsin. 
  The author also gives a detailed account of the conference 
in 
Staroye Ogaryovo (a village in a Moscow suburb) on September 12, 
1993, during which Yeltsin informed his power ministers Grachev, 
Kozyrev, Golushko and Yerin of the draft decree on the dismissal 
of the congress and parliament, and on early parliamentary 
elections. The draft decree was approved, while Kozyrev remarked 
that such a decree should have appeared a long time ago. The 
foreign minister was sharply aware of the dangers posed by the 
parliament, of Russia's falling prestige and of growing mistrust 
in the world, writes Yeltsin. He also says that Viktor 
Chernomyrdin resolutely put his signature under the decree, 
already signed by the four ministers. The book also gives 
details of the conference on the eve of October 4, when Yeltsin 
instructed Pavel Grachev to run the military operation against 
the rebels.

  [Text] Mirny (Murmansk region) April 11 TASS -- "Russia is 
neither producing nor testing nuclear weapons", ITAR-TASS was 
told by Lieutenant-General Yuriy Zhuravlev, head of the state 
testing area under Russia's Strategic Missile Command. 
  On Monday, a large group of journalists from various 
publications, information agencies, and radio and tv stations 
arrived at the top secret garrison in Mirny. They will be able 
to acquaint themselves with some of Russia's latest military 
technology, in particular, with the "Topol" experimental missile 
system which is expected to become part of the armed forces in a 
couple of years. 
  The journalists' arrival corresponded with celebrations of 
Cosmonaut's Day. In Mirny, this holiday is widely celebrated, 
since much has been done here for progress in space. 
  "We have no secrets to hide from Russians and the world 
community, but our openness does not hinder our responsibility 
for the security of Russia", Yuriy Zhuravlev declared.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Mikhail Karlov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 8 Apr -- Accidents are possible at any 
nuclear power station. Not for technical reasons, either, 
although the state of many stations does indeed give rise to 
anxiety among specialists, the ITAR-TASS correspondent learned 
today from Valeriy Sorokin, head of the Main Administration for 
Radiation Catastrophes (formerly Roskomchernobyl) of the Russian 
Ministry for Civil Defense, Emergencies, and Natural Disasters. 
  There are a number of reasons for potential accidents, the 
specialist believes. Equipment works as well as the people who 
operate it. At present the professional level of nuclear power 
station staff has fallen sharply. Previously, many 
highly-qualified nuclear workers wanted to work at stations 
because of the financial and social privileges -- these have not 
been in evidence for the last three or four years. Top class 
nuclear power workers are leaving for commercial organizations. 
It is frightening when nuclear power station workers go on 
strike because for several months they have not been paid their 
wages, averaging about 100,000 rubles. Many left under pressure 
of public opinion when Chernobyl started to be linked with 
nuclear power workers. Some believed nuclear stations should be 
eliminated. 
  Sorokin is of the view that there is a lack of due 
supervision at stations. Gosatomnadzor [State Committee for 
Supervision of Nuclear and Radiation Safety] -- which grew from 
the former Ministry of Medium Machine-Building -- essentially 
runs itself. At all nuclear power stations practically all its 
representatives are former staff of the stations themselves and 
are to a great degree dependent upon the management there. 
  Things are hard for Russia today. But it must choose the 
priority areas of life and the problems that must be solved 
first of all.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Mikhail Karlov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow April 9 TASS -- Now that almost eight years 
have passed since the Chernobyl catastrophe, mortality rate has 
exceeded birth rate in Central European part of Russia. 
  Situation in the Bryansk region mirrors that in other 
regions, which were exposed to the Chernobyl fallout, said Petr 
Kuzmin, head of the radiological medicine department of the 
public health board under the Bryansk regional administration. 
Almost 500,000 inhabitants of the Bryansk region live in the 
territory polluted with radionuclides. Since 1990, mortality 
rate has exceeded birth rate by six persons per 1,000 (in some 
districts, by 10 persons per 1,000). General morbidity has 
grown markedly over the years - a fact related to undermined 
immune systems. 
  Complications registered at pregnancy and childbirth have 
increased threefold, and the number of congenital anomalies and 
malignant tumors have doubled over the past five years. The 
incidence of the thyroid gland cancer has increased fivefold. 
Before 1987, there had not been a single case of a child 
suffering from the disease on record in the region, whereas at 
present local endocrinologists and oncologists are dealing with 
20 such cases. In expert opinion, the incidence of oncological 
and hereditary diseases will continue to grow over the next 
10-15 years.

    [Editorial Report] Moscow Ostankino Television First 
Channel Network in Russian at 1550 GMT on 11 April carries the 
"We" magazine program presented by Vladimir Pozner, in which 
Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev answers questions from a 
studio audience. Pozner begins by asking Grachev why he thinks 
young people are generally so unwilling to join the Army. 
Grachev answers that the country's political leaders have 
changed their attitudes to the Army and the Army has been left 
to fend for itself. Second, the Army has "opened up" and all 
the Army's troubles are known to everyone. The Russian Army is 
still a young one -- only two years old next month. When he 
became defense minister, Grachev says, the first thing he felt 
was that the legislative base of the Army had to be changed. He 
points out the moral and physical attributes required to serve 
in the Army. Pozner then opens the discussion to the floor. 
  A young man asks why an Army is needed in a country where 
"three main chiefs gathered together and destroyed a single 
state at Belovezhskaya Pushcha" [reference to meeting in Brest 
between President Boris Yeltsin, Belarusian Supreme Soviet 
Chairman Stanislav Shushkevich, and Ukrainian President Leonid 
Kravchuk announced the end of the USSR], and why, contrary to 
the law, it is trying to recruit students from the new 
humanitarian university? Grachev replies that the Army is an 
instrument of the state and its main job is to ensure the 
security of the state. As far as students are concerned, they 
are called up only from places that do not have military 
departments. 
  Pozner then asks: "Pavel Sergeyevich, does the Defense 
Ministry give recommendations on the call-up? In particular, 
did you present your point of view to anyone?" 
  Grachev replies: "You... [pauses] Many people are acquainted 
with the law on defense. The former Supreme Soviet adopted a 
law on defense in which it determined the strength of the Armed 
Forces, which, it said, should comprise one percent of the 
overall population. At the present moment we have about 150 
million. That means we must have an Army of 1.5 million. And 
where do we get it from? Here's a simple example. The spring 
call-up is now upon us. We have 1,472,000 young people subject 
to military law. In order to bring the Army's strength up to 
about 78 percent, in such a way that the units are operationally 
efficient, in this call-up we need to recruit a minimum of 
500,000 men, not taking other departments into account. We have 
come to the conclusion that this spring we can recruit not only 
for the Armed Forces but also for all other departments only 
216,000 men. That's the second reason, and, naturally we are 
making recommendations." 
  Grachev is asked next whether a Russian citizen has the 
right 
to serve outside Russian territory. He says yes, in accordance 
with a Supreme Soviet decision, he has such a right if he 
expresses such a personal wish after six months' service, in 
consultation with his parents. 
  Grachev clarifies his remark earlier about the Russian Army 
being only two years old; it has hundreds of years of previous 
history. A woman representing a group of servicemen's mothers 
wonders about the cost of the best brains of our young people. 
This is very high, he says, and a young man's profession is 
strictly taken into account when he is called up. 
  Answering charges of discrimination against Muslims in the 
Army, Grachev says this is indeed a problem, and it has become 
especially evident over the past year. An agreement was 
concluded with the Orthodox Church that Muslims should be able 
to confer with priests of both churches prior to call-up. As 
far as their diet is concerned, that's another matter that is 
virtually impossible to solve. 
  Grachev assures another young man that reductions in the 
Army 
are not a whim of the defense minister or the military command. 
"Anyone who follows what I do closely knows that I am in favor, 
at least, of an Army of 2.1 million. At the moment we have 2.3 
million. This is the optimal composition of an Army that can 
work and defend its fatherland." He goes on: "We are conducting 
a planned discharge of the officer corps, first and foremost 
those who have served 20 years or more and are entitled to a 
pension; second, those officers and warrant officers who have 
unblemished records -- and there are quite a number of them; 
and, third, those officers and warrant officers who have simply 
not got used to present-day conditions, i.e. those people who 
still carry political views and support certain political 
parties and currents. We have pursued another path. The Army 
has been depoliticized and de-ideologized and it's job is to 
defend its fatherland and not to serve one particular party, of 
whatever hue. Unfortunately, it is proving difficult to solve 
this question at the moment." 
  Pozner recalls that Grachev said that he believes the ideal 
strength to be 2.1 million. "That is more than one percent of 
the population." "Of course", Grachev replies. Pozner goes on, 
"You consider that one percent is a small amount?" Grachev 
points out that people forget that Western countries are highly 
developed and their strategic position is different from that of 
Russia with its huge area, and, therefore, to guarantee the 
country's security with just one percent of the population is 
not enough. 
  A questioner from Volgograd complains about the waste of 
life 
and lack of justice in the Army. Pozner interrupts with some 
statistics on deaths in the Army: In 1994, about 2,500 people 
have died for various reasons. Grachev agrees, people are being 
killed. "The statistics are these -- first, your figures are 
insufficient. If you want to be objective, in 1993 1,349 people 
were killed or died. Fifty percent of those died as a result of 
auto, air, and other disasters. Something like 25 percent took 
their own lives, about 20 percent lost their lives during 
exercises or servicing combat equipment," and another 2 percent 
died as a result of bullying. 
  Answering a question about pacifism, Grachev believes this 
is 
an "anti-state" matter. To another question he regrets that 
some people who have the money are able to buy themselves out. 
  Pozner presents video clips with the voice-over pointing out 
apathy and lack of discipline in the Army and delay in paying 
wages. The video shows men operating tanks, on patrol, on naval 
vessels, etc. Pozner says he is disheartened by what he hears 
and asks Grachev if there is a way out of these difficulties. 
  "The way out is there if our elected deputies and our 
leaders 
in the government correctly realize that the Army is not 
striving for ideals and is not asking for money just for its own 
needs. Let the viewers understand that the Armed Forces still 
pays for 60 percent of the overall number of Russia's 
enterprises. We are financing the staff of military factories. 
Therefore, our sums are realistic, and I emphasize again that 
the sum now being discussed and endorsed is clearly insufficient 
even to maintain servicemen's pay and the wages of its 
employees." 
  Regarding another question from Pozner about reductions in 
the Army, Grachev reminds him that it costs much more to lose an 
officer than to it does to keep him on. Grachev then supplies 
figures about the number of women serving in the Army. He 
discusses with Pozner the number of female defense ministers in 
the world -- in fact there are only two. 
  Pozner winds up the program with a series of brief 
questions. 
Grachev replies: He supports a professional army in principle, 
but it would need a huge budget, and: He would prefer that the 
Defense Ministry be engaged in purely political administrative 
functions, but we are so used to it being run by the military 
that we are not yet ready for a civilian minister.

  [Text] The president, the prime-minister, the Defence 
Ministry and both houses of the Federal Assembly are very 
alarmed by the position of the Russian Armed Forces as a result 
of the current economic situation. The statement was made by 
the speaker of the State Duma Ivan Rybkin during his Monday 
visit to the Chief Staff of the Strategic Missile Force. He was 
accompanied by the Deputy Defence Minister Andrey Kokoshin. 
  Addressing the personnel of the staff Rybkin stressed that 
the repetition of the 1959 situation should not be permitted. 
Then 1,200,000 military men were actually thrown out into the 
street as a result of cuts in the armed forces. The speaker said 
he agreed with the former American president Richard Nixon who 
told the press after a recent visit to Russia that the world is 
complicated and no one wants any "last breaks to the south" 
anymore. 
  Rybkin said that in questions related to the army one should 
be careful with harsh, radical expressions. In his opinion if a 
pattern of change is chosen, it should not be revolutionary but 
gradual. 
  Rybkin said that reforms are irreversible but spoke for 
tighter measures against those whose "grabbing instincts are 
extraordinarily developed, who take enormous credit for making 
giant profits." Rybkin stressed that if the president, 
government, parliament and other political forces act resolutely 
and revenue will grow irrespective of the way in which the State 
Duma approves the budget - in parts or for the whole year at 
once.

  [Text] Moscow April 13 TASS -- President of Kazakhstan 
Nursultan Nazarbayev will not attend the CIS summit opening in 
Moscow on Friday, TASS learned from reliable sources on 
Wednesday, The Kazakh delegation will be headed by 
Vice-President Yerik Asanbayev. 
  Although official reasons are not announced, sources in Alma 
Ata [Almaty] said the decision of Nazarbayev was caused by his 
dissappointment with the CIS. 
  During his recent visit to Moscow Nazarbayev voiced an idea 
of creating an Euro-Asian Union instead of the CIS. Later, 
during a visit to Japan, he said the Commonwealth of Independent 
States has played its role and again advocated the idea of the 
new union. 
  Nazarbayev believes that the CIS has ensured a more or less 
stable transformation of former Soviet republics into 
independent states. Now the states which are ready for close 
ties should think about the Euro-Asian Union, according to the 
president of Kazakhstan. 
  [Moscow Mayak Radio Network in Russian at 0700 GMT on 13 
April carries the following report: "Kazakhstani President 
Nursultan Nazarbayev's initiative to set up the Eurasian Union 
will be one of the main subjects for discussion at the Moscow 
meeting of CIS heads of state scheduled for 15 April. Among the 
tasks of the Eurasian Union is the drawing up of agreed economic 
reform programs."

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow April 13 ITAR-TASS -- Russian newspapers 
comment extensively on the NATO airstrike at Bosnian targets 
near Gorazde. 
  "The strikes in Gorazde were made without consulting Moscow, 
but Moscow is again expected to display activity to bring the 
Serbs back to the negotiating table", NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA says 
today. "This means that no one counted on the success of the 
airstrikes. The question is: What was the objective. In the 
military context the entire result of the operation is a couple 
or two smashed tanks and APC's (armoured personnel carriers)", 
the newspaper says. 
  "Can the fragments of the Bosnian settlement be collected?" 
ROSSIISKIYE VESTI queries. It publishes a survey of views on 
the NATO operation by officials of the Russian foreign and 
defence ministries, a parliament member and a scholar. State 
Duma subcommittee chairman Vyacheslav Nikonov said that "as a 
result of NATO unilateral military action Russian found itself 
practically excluded from the process of decision-making about 
the settlement of Bosnian crisis. This can exert a negative 
influence on the development of relations between Russia and the 
West and strengthen the position of those political forces in 
Russia which are against Russia's participation in the 
Partnership for Peace programme and the nationalist forces 
within Russia who criticise the present government's foreign 
policy". 
  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA recalls that "53 years ago today, 
several hundreds of German planes dropped 360 tonnes of bombs on 
Belgrade. Airstrikes continue today. The Balkans, where the 
First World War began, are being bombed. Prominent historians 
utter fearful but just words: "The Balkans are a convenient 
place for unleashing world wars". 
  "Bosnia: Fewer Chances for Peace" is a title in KRASNAYA 
ZVEZDA. "The situation in Bosnia has once again demonstrated two 
approaches to the settlement," the newspaper says. "Russia is 
committed to reason, to difficult, albeit slow negotiations. 
The United States and NATO relay on military force." 
  PRAVDA carries an article by its special correspondent 
Nikolay Krivomazov from the area of NATO combat activities in 
the Balkans, "where for the first time after the Second World 
War foreign planes are bombing slav lands. Here in Sarajevo one 
becomes particularly aware that the First World War began in 
this place. Will the fuse in the Balkans set aflame by the 
Kremlin perestroyka set off a bomb that will shake the world?". 
  TRUD singles out the view of Sergey Shakhray, vice premier 
and the leader of the Party of Russian Unity and Accord: "The 
airstrikes hit not only Serb targets but also the internal 
political situation in the Russian Federation: Nationalists are 
the only force that stands to gain from them in Russia". 
  An interview with Belarussian parliament chairman Mecheslav 
Grib is published by KRASNAYA ZVEZDA. Asked whether the 
republic's sole orientation towards Russia threatens its 
sovereignty, Grib said: "It is a question of an economic 
alliance, of which there are many in the world. As concerns the 
alleged threat to our sovereignty from a political alliance, I 
must say that no talks on this subject have been or are being 
conductive. Russia does not encroach on Belarus's independence 
-- I am saying this with full confidence. The item on the 
agenda now is economic alliance between our countries. The 
unification of the monetary systems of Russia and Belarus must 
be the first step towards it. Unfortunately, the process has 
been drawn out for too long.

free sale and purchase of land, among other things, meets all 
key provisions in the legislation on land, for instance limiting 
the term of private land tenure to 49 years. 
  Akayev denied "rumors being spread in the press and society" 
that the decree allows land to be sold to foreigners. It gives 
the right to buy land to citizens of Kyrgyzstan only, he said. 
  At a government meeting on Tuesday, he reaffirmed that more 
radical economic reforms were his government's main task. 
  He also urged stronger government at all levels. As one of 
the measures to achieve that purpose, the president, according 
to his spokesman Iman Rysaliyev, proposed strengthening akimat, 
the system of local government bodies headed by akims 
(governors). 
  Akayev denied that there is any connection between the 
falling production and the crisis of the political system in 
Kyrgyzstan. He said that, despite all the difficulties the 
economic reforms had brought about, some achievements had been 
made, primarily in monetary policy. Thus, last month the 
inflation rate went down to 5 percent and the prices stabilized. 
  Akayev said the main economic goal was to produce within 
Kyrgyzstan at least 90 percent of the raw materials the 
country's industry needs. 
  He also called for an end to political speculations about 
Kyrgyzstan's gold industry. He insisted that the government 
take urgent measures to ensure that foreign companies, notably 
Canadian and American, at last start developing the country's 
gold fields. IF Note: The Kyrgyz Government, on Akayev's 
instructions, recently approved a gold industry program spanning 
a period until the year 2010. The program, called The Gold of 
Kyrgyzstan, gives technical and economic information on more 
than 60 gold deposits, 16 of which are ready to be developed. 
Development of more than 60 percent of deposits is to be funded 
by investment made by joint ventures to be formed with companies 
both from former Soviet and other countries.

  [Text] Today, President Nazarbayev met with members of the 
government to discuss the development of the alternative economy 
and social insurance for the low-incomed population. 
  Speaking of the need to accelerate privatization and to 
render all-round support for entrepreneurship, in order to boost 
the formation of a civilized market and overcome the economic 
crisis, the president stressed that this help, at the expense of 
the awaited foreign credits, will be targeted first at those 
nongovernmental structures that manufacture consumer goods, 
which are in great demand, and other products. In order to make 
this government support for private enterprise more regular and 
targeted, a relevant plan will be worked out in April with the 
participation of many representatives of Kazakhstani businesses 
who attended today's meeting. Nazarbayev signed a decree to 
form a state commission for support of entrepreneurship. 
  Discussing additional measures of social protection of the 
population, it was noted that those who really need such support 
will receive it, namely the disabled, war and labor veterans, 
families with many children, the lonely, and the sick. Taking 
account of the interests of all these low-income groups, during 
the meeting the head of state signed a decree increasing minimum 
wages and pensions up to 100 tenge as of 1 April. In this 
connection financial compensation instead of former allowances 
will be increased. War veterans and people of similar status 
will receive a further 330 tenge a month; war veterans -- 280; 
labor invalids of the 1st and 2d groups -- 230 and 220 tenge. 
The salaries of many categories of workers will also be 
increased.

  [Summary] A news conference was given by President 
Nursultan Nazarbayev at the national press-center in Tokyo. He 
said he is satisfied with the results of his first official 
visit to Japan. He emphasized the importance of the joint 
Japan-Kazakhstan committee for cooperation that unites 32 
leading Japanese companies. Missions of 16 Japanese companies 
have opened in Kazakhstan. President Nazarbayev expressed hope 
that their number will increase after his visit to Japan. 
Nazarbayev spoke about prospects for future cooperation with 
Japan. According to him, the most promising areas for 
cooperation are the oil and railway industries, mainly in the 
Asiatic region. 
  An unexpected resignation by Japanese Prime Minister 
Hosokawa 
will not affect the implementation of agreements and treaties 
that were signed between Kazakhstan and Japan, said Nazarabyev. 
The leader of Kazakhstan was not taken by suprise at Hosokawa's 
decision to resign. "Whenever you have a coalition with a great 
number of participants it is always accompanied with 
complications."

<F P=106> [Report by Sergey Bunin: "`Help the Reforms, Not the </F>
Politicians.' Results of Kazakhstani President's Visit to 
Japan"] 
  [Text] Tokyo -- The first $120 million of Japanese 
Government aid and a "high assessment" of Kazakhstan's efforts 
in dismantling the nuclear arsenal, establishing market 
procedures, and democratizing society -- that was the chief 
result of President Nursultan Nazarbayev's first visit to Japan. 
  "Russia without the territorial issue" -- this is the 
frequently heard unofficial Japanese view of Kazakhstan, hinting 
at the country's immense natural resources and industrial 
potential. The two years that have elapsed since the 
establishment of Japanese-Kazakhstani diplomatic relations have 
been marked by a rapid blossoming of mutual contacts. Alma-Ata 
[Almaty] has become a Mecca for Japanese businessmen. The red 
carpet has been rolled out regularly for Kazkah visitors to 
Tokyo, where they have been given a very attentive hearing in 
the highest reaches of the business world. This is all boils 
down to the fact that between 20 and 30 percent of the world's 
entire stocks of many valuable types of fuel, chemical raw 
materials, and nonferrous and rare-earth metals, largely 
undeveloped, are on Kazakhstan territory. 
  But almost immediately there energed some intractable 
problems, although bilateral trade has actually increased, 
reaching the as yet not very impressive figure of $37 million. 
The first and biggest obstacle is that Kazkahstan has no 
independent access to the sea and transit communications are 
difficult. The second problem is the quality of deliveries. It 
is still well short of world standards. According to one 
Japanese businessman, who had already failed in that area of 
business, the future of trade with Kazakhstan remains illusory 
until these two problems are resolved, and this requires massive 
capital investment in the infrastructure and in the renovation 
of enterprises. 
  But President Nazarbayev was optimistic when he reported to 
journalists on the results of his three days of meetings and 
conversations in Tokyo. There will be Japanese investment. The 
Kazakhstani leader was able to secure in a very short time 
credits worth $220 million from the Japanese export-import bank 
-- they will finance numerous private joint projects on the 
territory of Kazakhstan. The biggest of them is the 
construction of the West Kazakhstan oil refinery, costing $1 
billion. A consortium involving the Mistubishi, Mitsui, and 
Toya corporations won the construction contract. Agreement was 
also reached on the free financing of geological surveys of gas 
deposits in the Aral Sea area by the Japanese national oil 
corporation. In the future, the president announced, we are 
talking about laying a gas pipeline to the shores of Japan. 
Finally, there was a promise of comprehensive financial 
assistance to develop railroad transport, including the laying 
of a "Friendship" track passing through China and terminating at 
the East China Sea. 
  As far as one could judge from the president's words and 
from 
pronouncements by high-ranking hosts, another contributory 
factor in Japan's very favorable attitude toward business 
cooperation is Kazakhstan's specific steps to shed the burden of 
nuclear weapons. Japan intends to allocate an immediate $110 
million for the dismantling of the nuclear arsenals that have 
built up over the past 40 years, following hard on the heels of 
the United States. 
  We have never made a secret of the fact that we came here to 
resolve the main questions, economic questions, Nazarbayev said 
at the final news conference, and we are very satisfied with the 
accords that have been reached, since they "pave the way ahead" 
and impart "powerful new impetus to our relations in all 
spheres." 
  Should Japan switch to helping the former republics of the 
USSR in view of Russia's recent great-power behavior toward its 
former dominions? -- a question from the floor. "Russia must be 
helped, not for what individual politicians say, but in order to 
support the process of reforms and democratization. This is 
necessary not only for Russia but for us too, and for you, who 
are Russia's neighbors."

<F P=106> [Article by Boris Lysenko: "Germans Pack Up and Leave </F>
Kazakhstan"] 
  [Text] Berlin -- According to official figures, there are 
700,000 Germans living in Kazakhstan. Many have already left -- 
300,000 people did so in 1993 alone. Even more are planning to 
leave. 
  One-half of the 17-million population of the [world's] ninth 
largest state are members of ethnic minorities, and ethnic 
tension is on the rise. 
  There are varying reasons for potential conflict. Konstantin 
Erlikh, chairman of the Republic's "German Rebirth" Society, 
explains why people want to leave Kazakhstan. It is not only a 
case of economic necessity, but also of the "Kazakhization of 
the country," which does not promise ethnic minorities a 
political future. This is also compounded by the problem of 
citizenship. 
  In a country rich in fuel resources people are freezing and 
suffering for want of food. Anyone who is able to leave is 
doing so, heading for Germany in particular. The number of 
mixed-marriage families among the emigres has risen appreciably 
as Germans persuade their partners of a different nationality to 
try for happiness in the West. 
  With the adoption of the Constitution on 28 January 1992, 
Kazakh was officially declared the state language. Anyone who 
wants to remain in state service has to speak Kazakh and such 
people are very few and far between among the local Germans and 
Russians. The result is that the number of representatives of 
the ethnic minorities in leadership structures and the 
ministerial apparatus has dropped noticeably in a short period, 
representatives of "German Rebirth" say. According to them, 
anyone who does not have influential members of their ethnic 
minorities in very important positions will find it incredibly 
difficult to combat all-powerful officials in the corrupt morass 
in which God forbid you utter a "foreign" word. 
  By the end of 1995 every non-Kazakh will have to say whether 
he wants to become a Kazakhstani citizen or not. Anyone who 
decides to obtain a Kazakhstani passport must bear in mind that 
it will be even harder to leave the country then. Anyone who 
takes the reverse decision will find themselves without 
citizenship in Kazakhstan after 1995. 
  In line with legislation, Germany allows a maximum of 
230,000 
emigres from the former Soviet Union to enter its country each 
year. At the same time the federal government is trying to 
contain [soderzhat] immigration by providing Kazakhstan with 
economic aid. Since 1990, around 80 million German marks have 
vanished into Kazakhstan. 
  The ethnic minorities' only hope is President Nursultan 
Nazarbayev, who has officially assured them: "We do not want to 
divide our people into them and us." Kazakhstan will hardly be 
able to manage without Russian Germans or Russians, otherwise 
its development will come to a standstill. The departure of 
45,000 Russians in 1992 was a serious blow to Kazakhstan, 
particularly if you consider the fact that the bulk of the 
Russians were members of the intelligentsia. The Russian 
Germans are also very essential. They are diligent artisans and 
peasants. 
  However, aid is going no further than official declarations 
since in reality there are hardly any traces of it to be found. 
Why for instance is there still no Goethe Institute in Alma-Ata 
[Almaty] although the money has long since been provided? And 
why, lastly, are representatives of the ethnic minorities 
disappearing from important state positions if they are 
nonetheless essential, Germans wonder as they pack their bags?

  [Text] Chisinau, ROMPRES, 11/4/1994 -- President Snegur 
has met this afternoon with members of the Parliamentary 
Commission for settling the problem of insuring the conditions 
for performing the deputy duties by Ilie Ilascu and releasing 
the other detainees of the so-called "Ilascu group," states a 
Presidential Press Service communique. Snegur said during the 
meeting that he met Saturday [9 April] with Igor Smirnov to 
discuss in particular the fate of the political detainees. 
According to the President, only unusual solutions could lead 
to a breakthrough in this problem. According to him the problem 
is in the center of the public attention, because "things went 
too far." Snegur mentioned that he will do everything possible 
to release the patriots. But he was also "confused with the 
fact that the weekly TARA [the country], Christian Democratic 
Popular Front of Moldova publication, often aggravated the 
situation by publishing articles that oppose the pursued 
objectives." President Snegur appraised that the problem could 
be settled "only by means of reasonable compromises and 
expressed his hope that all progressive forces will realize this 
fact," concluded the communique.

  [Text] Moldovan Prime Minister Andrei Sangheli believes the 
creation of a single monetary system of the members of the CIS 
Economic Union is senseless. In an interview with INTERFAX in 
Kishinev [Chisinau] he called the ruble zone "a bluff" and 
categorically objected to Moldova's entry to it. 
  In his opinion, "today it is unrealistic to talk about the 
unification of monetary systems. On the contrary, it is 
necessary to accelerate the process of stabilization of national 
currencies in all former Soviet Republics." 
  Sangheli pointed out that the rate of the Moldovan national 
currency, the lei, thanks to financial support from the IMF and 
the World Bank, is sufficiently stable, and its fall from 3.85 
to 4.12 lei to $1 in the past five months was due to inflation. 
According to preliminary estimates, the level of inflation in 
March reached 20 percent.

<F P=106> [Report by Heorhiy Vorotnyuk from Odessa: "A New Competitor </F>
on the Danube?"] 
  [Text] According to the Moldovan mass media, the 
government of that country does everything possible to promote 
the creation of its own merchant fleet on the Danube. For that 
purpose, not only are negotiations conducted with the CIS 
countries on the fair division of the former Union's fleet, but 
possibilities are also sought to purchase, build, and charter 
vessels. A shipping company -- "Moldova Shipping Company" -- 
was recently created there. It already has seven vessels at its 
disposal: three passenger ships, three freight vessels, and a 
barge. All of them have been chartered from Romanian ship 
owners and are, for the time being, kept in the Romanian port of 
Constanta. However, in the near future, our neighbors will 
start building a port on the Danube, where the Moldovan 
territory is adjacent to the river. 
  It looks like the Ukrainian Danube Shipping Company will 
have 
yet another competitor. At any rate, it will take care of the 
cargo from Moldova itself.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: Compiled by </F>
Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy; edited by Vladimir 
Shishlin] 
  [Text] In a recent exclusive interview with INTERFAX 
President Islam Karimov described as the biggest problem of his 
country the forced transition to a local currency. He claimed 
that Uzbekistan resisted the withdrawal from the ruble zone for 
a long time. He said the worst consequence of the change was 
the spiritual separation of two million ethnic Russians from 
their native land. He favored a discussion by interested members 
of the CIS of the formation of a common monetary system with 
Russia. 
  Meanwhile, observers say the president is taking additional 
steps to stabilize the local currency. Karimov signed a 
government resolution stopping all transactions with Russian 
banknotes as of 15 April. 
  The purpose of the decision is to strengthen the circulation 
of sum coupons and increase their purchasing power. The 
document permitted all legal entities (public and private) as 
well as individuals to sell goods and offer services for hard 
currency on condition that all transactions are registered. 
  In keeping with the decision after 15 April the exchange 
rates of the sum will be determined through regular trading at 
the Uzbek Currency Exchange. So far exchange rates have been 
set by the Central Bank of Uzbekistan on the basis of the data 
supplied by the Central Bank of Russia. 
  The document provides for the formation of a network of 
exchange outlets for the public and allows private individuals 
to exchange currencies provided they have a licence from the 
Central Bank. 
  Under the decision after 15 April all companies must sell to 
the Central Bank 30 percent of their foreign currency returns 
out of which 10 percent will be purchased by the Ministry of 
Finance for the Uzbek currency reserve and 5 percent by the 
government of Karakalpakia (an autonomous republic of 
Uzbekistan) and regional administrations for the formation of 
local currency reserves. 
  After 1 May in keeping with the decision settlements with 
companies in other former Soviet republics will be conducted 
only on clearing basis or in hard currency. 
  IF Note: At the moment in Tashkent the Russian ruble sells 
for 10-11 sums and $1 for 20,000-22,000 sums.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Konstantin Pribytkov] </F>
  [Text] Geneva April 13 TASS -- Georgia and Abkhazia 
disagree on the conflict areas where U.N. peace-making troops 
should be deployed. 
  ITAR-TASS has learned about these differences from 
participants of the Tuesday meeting in Geneva, attended by the 
Georgian and Abkhazian delegations, as well as representatives 
from the United Nations and Russia. 
  The Georgian delegation moved to deploy U.N. peace-making 
units and inspectors along the entire parameter of the conflict 
zone in Abkhazia, in particular, along the Psou river (the 
border with Russia) and the Inguri river (the border with 
Georgia), on mountain passes, along the littoral and at the 
airports of Sukhumi and Bombara. It believes the "blue helmets" 
should prevent the resumption of hostilities and should put an 
end to the delivery of weapons and manpower to the conflict zone. 
  The Abkhazian side believes that U.N. peace-makers should be 
posted only along the Inguri river, which now separates the two 
conflicting sides, and that the "blue helmets" should ensure the 
disengagement of the conflicting sides, should prevent the 
infiltration of their troops into the 6-10-kilometre wide 
disengagement corridor. 
  The discussion will be continued in the course of further 
consultations on Wednesday and possibly on Thursday. The U.N. 
experts are expected to outline their views during these 
consultations, which will not adopt any decisions. However, the 
exchange of views will help Eduard Brunner, the U.N. secretary- 
general's special envoy, who is presiding over the meeting, and 
then the secretary-general himself to formulate the U.N. 
Security Council's proposals. The council is to decide whether 
it is worth sending U.N. peace-makers to the region and how many 
men should be dispatched there if a corresponding decision is 
adopted.

  [Text] At the Georgian-Abkhazian talks in Geneva on April 
12 on the deployment of a peacekeeping force in Abkhazia the two 
sides failed to agree on sites for the stationing of such forces. 
  Chief negotiator Djaba Ioseliani told the Georgian radio on 
Wednesday that the Georgian plan envisages the deployment in the 
zone of conflict of up to 2,500 UN servicemen. They are to take 
under control the Russian-Abkhazian border along the Psou River, 
all mountain passes connecting Abkhazia with the North Caucasus. 
Peacekeepers are also to be deployed in Sukhumi, Gudauta, 
Leselidze, the Kodori canyon and along the Inguri River. The 
Georgian side plans to locate the UN headquarters in Sukhumi. 
  Meanwhile, the Abkhazian side, said Ioseliani, continues 
insisting on the deployment of peacekeepers along the 
confrontation line on the Inguri River. 
  I do not know how the talks will proceed, but our plan was 
approved by the UN and Russian representatives, said Ioseliani. 
  He also said that according to the Russian side the 
deployment of 2,500 peacekeepers would not be an adequate number. 
  The talks in Geneva continue on April 13.

  [Text] In an interview with a SAKINFORMI correspondent, 
Georgian head of state Eduard Shevardnadze made the following 
statement in connection with the bombing by NATO planes of 
Bosnian Serb positions near the town of Gorazde: 
  This operation can be viewed not only as an isolated 
incident 
but also as the first serious attempt to counter the phenomenon 
of war with force. This was a serious test for the principle of 
establishing peace by force. The incident should serve as a 
lesson to all aggressive and irresponsible parties, be it a 
nationalist or separatist force. 
  It is necessary to honor obligations undertaken by an 
agreement, especially if international organizations are 
involved. In the event of the opposite happening, in the world 
today there is a more powerful and just force, such as the 
United Nations and NATO, which is capable of neutralizing an 
aggression such as this. 
  It must be noted that in planning and carrying out such 
major 
operations, the practice of political consultation with leading 
states, especially, the permanent members of the UN Security 
Council, should not be ignored.

  [Text] We have learned from reliable sources that the 
situation in Zugdidi Rayon has been aggravated recently by a 
campaign conducted in Gali Rayon by Abkhaz separatists. The 
Abkhazians are trying to persuade the local population to 
influence their relatives, who fled to Zugdidi and neighboring 
areas, to return to Gali Rayon. They say the tragedy which took 
place in Gali Rayon was just a misunderstanding between the 
Abkhazians and Mingrelians and that it is necessary to restore 
traditional kinship ties between them. 
  At the same time, the Abkhazians promise to introduce the 
Mingrelian language [spoken by Georgians in Mingrelia and 
Abkhazia] in Gali Rayon schools and to register the local 
population as Mingrelians. Refugees who have returned to Gali 
Rayon were issued with a so-called registration card, giving 
their nationality as Mingrelian. 
  It seems that the agreements on the return of the refugees 
and on a peaceful settlement of the problem of Abkhazia reached 
at the recent talks have caused anxiety among the most extreme 
Abkhaz separatists. Therefore, they resorted to the dirtiest 
trick of all and decided to pit the population of Mingrelia 
against the rest of Georgia.

  [Text] Tbilisi April 12 TASS -- Georgian Cabinet of 
Ministers has declared a spring draft in the Armed Forces of the 
country. It will be held from April 20 to July 1 and citizens 
from 18 to 25 years of age, who do not have a right to delay 
their recruitment, will be recruited. 
  According to an inter-governmental agreement, about 600 
draftees will serve together with Russian border guards on the 
Turkish border. They join on a voluntary basis the "Georgia" 
armed group of the Caucasian special district of Russian 
border-guard troops on the Turkish border. 
  The special district was created in March, this year, 
following a decree by Russian President Boris Yeltsin. It 
includes the relevant armed groups in the Transcaucasian region: 
"Georgia", "Azerbaijan" and "Armenia". 
  As against Russian conscripts, Georgian draftees will be 
administered not to an oath, but to a solemn obligation.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report under the "INFORM" rubric: "All Quiet </F>
at the MORG [Republic of Georgia Defense Ministry]"] 
  [Text] In its three years of independence the Georgian 
Army has fallen short of 300,000 draftees. People in the 
republic use any methods to evade service, and the most 
widespread of them is bribery. Plus desertion, which is not 
subject to any record-keeping at all. Even the Republic of 
Georgia Defense Ministry headquarters is 15-20 percent 
undermanned. 
  Nevertheless, Major General Guram Nikolayshvili, chief of 
the 
General Staff, yesterday delivered a statement abolishing the 
drafting of reservists for service. According to him the 20,000 
personnel at the Defense Ministry's disposal are quite 
sufficient to solve any problems of this department and the 
country as a whole.

information of the Black Sea Fleet [BSF] press center, 
Lieutenant General Shkidchenko, commander of the Odessa Military 
District, arrived at the BSF mothball division stationed in 
Odessa on 12 April. He read to the unit's personnel a directive 
of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry on disbanding the division and 
setting up on its basis the 1st Division Brigade for protecting 
the Ukrainian Navy's waters. According to the BSF press center, 
in violation of the Russian-Ukrainian agreement on the BSF, the 
officers and warrant officers of the division were declared 
private individuals. After this, Ukrainian servicemen broke 
into office premises and seized the division's secret 
department. In the afternoon, a group of military constructors 
of the Ukrainian armed forces arrived at the unit in order to 
remove the traces of the break-in. 
  A POSTFACTUM correspondent has learned from sources close to 
the command of the Russian Navy that for the time being the 
Ukrainian special troops have released only Aleksandr Zelenko, 
captain second rank, chief of staff of the division. Oleg 
Feyoktistov, captain first rank, commander of the division, and 
Dmitriy Starikov, captain second rank, commander of the mainland 
base, are still in custody.

  [Text] Odessa -- Lieutenant General Volodymyr 
Shkidnychenko, the Odessa military district commander, has met 
personnel of the 1st Ship Brigade for the Protection of Odessa 
Water Area and introduced the newly appointed commander, Captain 
Second Rank Volodymyr Marchenko. The military district 
commander's press secretary, Colonel Vyacheslav Voronkov, told 
UNIAN that the former commander of Ship Division 318, Captain 
First Rank Oleg Feoktistov was transferred on 11 April from the 
guest room of the Odessa military commander's office to the 
district hospital and was diagnosed as suffering from "acute 
alcoholic poisoning -- chronic alcoholism." His deputies, 
Captains Second Rank Aleksandr Zelenko and Dmitriy Starikov, are 
staying on the territory of the former 318th Division of the 
Black Sea Fleet which has been transformed into the Ukrainian 
1st Brigade for the Protection of Odessa Water Area, but have 
been relieved of their duties. 
  According to Vyacheslav Voronkov, not only the majority of 
the former Russian Black Sea Fleet division, but also six Navy 
officers and 14 junior officers have to date submitted a written 
statement of their wish to serve in the Ukrainian Navy. 
  Col. Voronkov said that the consequences of the 
"pirate-style 
dismantling" of the hydrographic navigation equipment worth at 
least $10,000 and its transfer from Odessa to Sevastopol was a 
very serious matter. "The radar station RLS-5 Mars would provide 
for the nonstop operation of seven lighthouses in the western 
part of the Black Sea," he said. "Its absence can completely 
halt navigation from Odessa to the Zmeinyy island, as sailing 
safety would be at risk. In order to prevent this, the military 
district command has decided to assemble and operate the reserve 
units of the lost hydrographic navigation complex." Voronkov 
also said that the ship brigade for the protection of the water 
area is joined in a 24-hour watch by the marines of the 
Ukrainian control ship Slavutych which had arrived in Odessa to 
take part in the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the 
city's liberation from the Nazi occupiers. 
  Col. Voronkov denied Russian media allegations of "hostile 
actions" against Russian sailors and their families in Odessa, 
adding, however, that the Odessa military district prosecutor's 
office is contemplating criminal proceedings against the former 
command of the 318th Conservation Division of the Black Sea 
Fleet previously deployed in Odessa.

  [Excerpt] Kiev -- Yuriy Serheyev, head of the Foreign 
Ministry information department, confirmed at a ministry 
briefing on 12th April that Ukraine's Foreign Ministry handed a 
note of protest to the Russian ambassador's adviser, Anatoliy 
Kovalyov, on 9 April in connection with the situation in Odessa 
port on which UNIAN reported before. The note says, in 
particular, that the hydrographic navigation equipment based on 
the territory of Ukraine remains Ukraine's property until the 
division of the Black Sea Fleet. The Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs regards the acts of the Russian side as unlawful and 
emphasizes that they are a violation of international law. 
Ukraine demands that Russia return the equipment and discipline 
the people involved in the action. "It can be qualified as overt 
terrorism," commented Yuriy Serheyev. 
  Today's Ukrainian-Russian relations are complicated also by 
the fact that, according to some media reports, Russia intends 
to deploy military bases in former USSR republics. "Such a 
mechanism of deploying military bases on foreign territory is 
indeed used around the world, but only given the willingness of 
the country where the bases would be deployed," Yuriy Serheyev 
stressed. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Kiev -- Ukraine and Russia have resumed 
negotiations on the future of the Black Sea Fleet with the two 
delegations meeting at Ukraine's Ministry of Defense on 12 
April. As UNIAN already reported, the Russian delegation is led 
by Yuriy Dubinin, the Russian president's ambassador-at-large 
and includes Feliks Gromov, the Russian Navy commander. 
  "We have long been offering to return to the Black Sea Fleet 
negotiations," Ukraine's Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko told 
UNIAN, "and today these negotiations have been resumed. It is 
in our interests and those of the Russian side to find a 
solution to this issue in order to prevent the Fleet problem 
from setting off unexpected developments. Right now, everything 
happening around the Fleet is out of control, and the Odessa 
incident is an example of that. If we manage to find a solution 
soon to the Black Sea Fleet problem on the basis of mutual 
interest, we would decrease the probability of unforeseeable 
consequences in future. We need to find such solutions that 
will not harm the Black Sea Fleet and at the same time satisfy 
the interested parties. These solutions must be based on the 
Massandra, Yalta, and Zavidovo accords.

  [Text] Kiev, 12 April (AFP) -- Ukraine said Tuesday [12 
April] it had dismantled a disputed Black Sea fleet unit based 
at Odessa and placed its personnel under the control of its own 
armed forces in response to the wishes of fleet servicemen there. 
  The announcement was made by Ukrainian Deputy Defense 
Minister Ivan Bijan and reported by INTERFAX-UKRAINE news agency 
as Russian and Ukrainian delegations met in Ukraine to discuss 
the dispute. 
  "It's up to Russia to decide how to react to this 
resolution," the agency quoted General Anatoliy Lopata, chief of 
staff of the Ukrainian Army, as saying. 
  A spokesman for the Russian Navy told AFP that the Ukrainian 
move was made unilaterally but said it "means nothing" as the 
future of the fleet would have to be resolved through 
negotiations. 
  A Russian delegation led by Admiral Felix Gromov, commander 
of the Russian Navy, held talks with Ukrainian officials in Kiev 
Tuesday regarding the dispute, but the negotiations ended 
without agreement, INTERFAX reported. 
  The Ukrainian move came a day after Russia accused Ukrainian 
special forces of storming the base at Odessa, wounding 
servicemen and arrested three Russian naval officers. 
  Bijan said the three officers had been released following 
demands from the Russian Government. 
  The decision to place the Odessa division under Ukrainian 
control was taken because "a considerable number of the men who 
serve in the division expressed their desire to serve in the 
Ukrainian Armed Forces," Bijan stated. 
  The Odessa unit is a submarine maintenance division 
consisting of only several dozen servicemen, a shipyard and 
basic communications facilities, informed sources said. 
  Details surrounding the attack on the base Sunday were still 
hazy, but naval officials suggested that it occurred when 
Russian sailors defied Ukrainian orders and left Odessa with a 
ship carrying expensive naval equipment. 
  Control over the fleet, based at the Crimean port of 
Sevastopol, has been a crucial point of contention between 
Russia and Ukraine, which officially exercise joint command over 
it. 
  The fleet was to have been divided into two equal parts 
under 
a 1992 accord but this has been delayed due to reluctance by the 
mainly Russian officer corps to be under Ukrainian command. 
  Ukraine has also said it would give up its half of the fleet 
in lieu of payment of its multi-billion dollar debt to Russia, 
but this plan also has so far not been implemented. 
  Bijan said Ukrainian servicemen were "breaking Ukrainian 
law" 
by serving in the fleet, but gave no further explanation. 
  Separately, Ukraine agreed Tuesday to pay back its huge debt 
for gas deliveries with cash payments and by offering to Russia 
part ownership of pipelines and other facilities on its 
territory, officials said here. 
  The head of Russia's giant Gazprom company, Rem Vyakhirev, 
said following talks here with a Ukrainian delegation that Kiev 
would pay 600 million dollars by June. 
  Ukrainian Deputy Premier Valentin Landik said that Kiev 
would 
privatise gas pipelines, port facilities in Odessa and other 
installations to allow Gazprom to buy stock in the 
newly-privatised companies. 
  Details of the plan however have yet to be hammered out and 
the two sides agreed to establish working groups to determine 
how the shared ownership would be implemented. 
  Russia and Ukraine have been at odds over payment for gas 
deliveries and the dispute forced Moscow drastically to cut the 
gas flow to Ukraine in March. 
  Gazprom has maintained that part ownership of the pipelines 
would allow it better to control deliveries to its European 
clients including France, Italy and Germany.

  [Text] Kiev -- UNIAN has learned that the 12 April 
Russian-Ukrainian negotiations on the future of the Black Sea 
Fleet ended in failure. The Russian side took a firm stand 
refusing to agree to an inventory of the Black Sea Fleet against 
its state in December 1991, which was insisted on by the 
Ukrainian delegation led by First Deputy Minister of Foreign 
Affairs Borys Tarasyuk. The sides failed to reach agreement on 
the issues discussed. 
  The other issue was an inquiry into the causes of the 
incident involving the Black Sea Fleet ship Cheleken on the 
night of 8 April in the Odessa port. A high-ranking official of 
Ukraine's Ministry of Defense who asked not to be identified 
said it was very likely that the hydrographic ship Cheleken 
carried a commercial cargo, which, had it been discovered, could 
have led to an undesirable argument. According to the same 
source, Black Sea Fleet ships have recently been performing 
unsupervised commercial trips to foreign countries in the Black 
and the Mediterranean seas. 
  After the end of the interstate negotiations, 
Ambassador-at-Large Yuriy Dubinin, who led the Russian 
delegation, and Russian Navy Commander Felix Gromov met the 
president of Ukraine. Asked by UNIAN to comment on the talks 
and the meeting with Leonid Kravchuk, Yuriy Dubinin said he and 
the president of Ukraine had agreed not to disclose their 
content in the media.

  [Text] Elections in Ukraine were held in an atmosphere of 
democracy and law. Insignificant violations recorded in a 
number of constituencies did not influence the general situation 
during the elections. These conclusions of international 
observers were presented today at a briefing with Ukraine's 
Foreign Ministry. 
  The briefing also informed of the stance of Ukraine's 
Foreign 
Ministry regarding NATO air attacks on Serbian positions. 
Ukraine's Foreign Ministry expresses its regret that the 
developments in Bosnia and Herzegovina have led to the use of 
force. Political regulations has proved unsuccesful in this 
case. UN peacekeeping forces, including the Ukrainian 
battalion, have been put in jeopardy. The Ukrainian side 
understands the situation which developed in connection with 
this, but is displeased with the fact that necessary 
consultations were not held with Ukraine. Ukraine hopes for a 
peaceful resolution of the conflict in the Balkans through 
political means.

  [Text] Kiev 12 April, TASS -- The Ukrainian Foreign 
Ministry laments over the fact the Bosnian developments entailed 
the use of force, a briefing at the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry 
was told here today. 
  Political settlement brought no results, the U.N. 
peace-makers, including the Ukrainian battalion, were 
jeopardized. The Ukrainian side understands the situation but 
is dissatisfied with the fact no one consulted Ukraine before 
the air-strikes. Ukraine hopes for a peaceful political 
settlement of the Balkan conflict, said speakers at the briefing. 
  Commenting on the recent Ukrainian elections, the speakers 
said they were held in the atmosphere of democracy and 
lawfulness. Inconsiderable violations registered at some polling 
stations did not influence the general atmosphere, they noted 
referring to estimations of international observers.

  [Text] Kiev 12 April, TASS -- UKRINFORM News Agency sent a 
report to ITAR-TASS about Ukrainian frontierguards showing 
vigilance on borders with Russia and Belarus. "Units of the 
State Committee for State Border Protection reliably guard 
Ukrainian borders," the report says. 
  The report notes that in the first months of the new year 
Ukrainian frontierguards in interaction with custom offices and 
the interior bodies prevented the smuggling out of Ukraine of 
various products surpassing five times last year's indexes. 
They prevented the smuggling of nearly 5 kg of gold, 15 kg of 
platinum and alloys, 12 kg of silver, 339 tonnes of rare earth 
metals and 81 articles of antiques. More than 90 per cent of 
this contraband was arrested on the stretches of the state 
borders with Belarus and Russia. Certain "transparency" of 
frontiers is taken advantage of by smugglers, UKRINFORM notes. 
  Skilfully manoeuvring mobile units and supported by 
aviation, 
frontierguards control 1,500 roads and paths leading to former 
union republics, the Ukrainian news agency notes. At the same 
time commandos specialising on contraband become more active. 
They cross the border, try to bribe frontierguards or put them 
to pressure.

  [Text] Kiev, 13 April (AFP) -- Ukraine has received from 
Russia a first shipment of nuclear fuel from its dismantled 
warheads in line with a U.S.-Russian-Ukrainian agreement reached 
in January, Deputy Foreign Minister Boris Tarasyuk told AFP 
Wednesday [13 April]. 
  Tarasyuk said the first convoy of fuel, which will be used 
to 
run power plants in the southern city of Zaparozhnye, arrived 
Monday. 
  Defence Minister Vitaliy Radetsky told a news conference 
during a visit to Germany earlier this week that Ukraine would 
stop dismantling the weapons because of Russia's failure to 
provide the fuel. 
  Tarasyuk, who returned from talks in Moscow, said he had 
received assurances from Russian officials that they would 
fulfill their obligations under the agreement signed by U.S. 
President Bill Clinton, Russian President Boris Yeltsin and 
Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk. 
  "Ukraine will not raise any obstacles in the implementation 
of this trilateral agreement if all parties involved fulfil 
their commitments," Tarasyuk said. 
  Ukraine was the last of the four nuclear states of the 
former 
Soviet Union to agree to dismantle its nuclear weapons under the 
agreement that provided Ukraine with at least one billion 
dollars in financial compensation and nuclear fuel shipments to 
run the country's power stations.

  [Text] Moscow 12 April, TASS -- Ukraine will pay off its 
debt to Russia for gas supplies within the second quarter of the 
year. The Ukrainian delegation headed by Vice-Premier Valentin 
Liandik reaffirmed the intention here on Tuesday during its 
meeting with officials from Russian gas giant Gazprom. 
  At present the debt amounts to more than 600 million 
dollars. 
The bulk of it is for supplies in 1993. Liandik said it will be 
paid off in accordance with a scheme worked out in March 1994. 
50 per cent of it will be paid off with financies and 50 per 
cent with equipment, mainly pipes and compressors. 
  During the negotiations, the parties signed an accord on 
storage of 10 billion cubic metres of Russian gas in two 
underground depots in Ukraine. It will allow to have enough gas 
reserves for export in winter. Another accord specified that 
Russian natural gas will be dried on the Ukrainian territory to 
meet export qualifications. 
  The parties agreed to set up working groups within next 
months. The groups will work out terms of privatising Ukraine's 
undeground depots, sections of pipilines and seaport facilities. 
  The next meeting of the delegations is scheduled for 10 May 
in Kiev.

  [Text] Russian President Boris Yeltsin ordered including 
support of Sevastopol into the Russian national budget, the city 
council Chairman Viktor Semyonov said at a news conference on 12 
April. 
  On a visit in Moscow on 5-10 April Semyonov handed Yeltsin 
an 
estimate of the city's needs in supporting the infrastructure 
and social sphere of the Black Sea Fleet. 
  According to the Sevastopol Statistical Agency, nearly 
33,500 
Black Sea Fleet officers and warrant officers resided in the 
city. The fleet supported 75,000 employees and their families. 
In effect, every fourth Sevastopol resident was directly 
dependent on the Black Sea Fleet. 
  Semyonov believed that it was Russia's duty to contribute to 
the city's infrastructure and social sphere. 
  According to Sevastopol economists, Russia must allot the 
city 1,072,912 Mn [million] karbovantsi, or about 52 Bn 
[billion] rubles. 
  Semyonov said that talks with Yuriy Dubinin, Russia's chief 
negotiator on the Black Sea Fleet, convinced him that Russia 
stood by the protocol of the Massandra summit. 
  Semyonov believed that a Ukrainian-Russian commission on 
evaluating the assets of the Black Sea Fleet should be composed 
of civilian defense industry engineers because personal 
rivalries between military officers of the two countries made 
this task impossible. 
  Semyonov said that the Moscow City government would allocate 
Sevastopol 500 Mn rubles to finance the festivities marking the 
50th anniversary of liberating the city from the Nazis.

<F P=106> [ITAR-TASS observer Lyudmila Yermakova report, especially </F>
for ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA: "Respecting Private Rights. What Will 
the Civil Code Be Like?"] 
  [Text] Of the draft laws which the Russian Federation 
president intends to submit to the State Duma as part of his 
legislative initiative, he is putting the Civil Code to the 
fore. Justice Minister Yuriy Kalmykov has reported that the 
first section of the document, which lawyers are describing as 
the market economy code, has already been prepared for 
consideration. 
  Civil law specialists consider this new collection of laws 
second in importance to the Constitution, since "it is designed 
to lay the legal foundations for civilized market relations in a 
country undergoing reform in all spheres of its life." It 
should replace the virtually obsolete 1964 RSFSR [Russian Soviet 
Federated Socialist Republic] Civil Code. 
  The draft is being created by a working group of lawyers set 
up at the government's behest from the Private Law Center, the 
Justice Ministry, several institutes, and the Supreme Court of 
Arbitration. The Court, incidentally, is very interested in the 
adoption of the code, which will "make it possible to streamline 
the legal regulation of economic relations that have developed 
with the transition to the market," Vasiliy Vitryanskiy, a 
member of the group and deputy chairman of the Court, explained. 
  He stressed that the compilers of the plan are "proceeding 
on 
the basis of the constitutional provisions on civil legislation 
as an area under the jurisdiction of the Russian Federation on 
the unity of the economic area throughout its entire territory, 
and on the free movement of goods, services, and finances." He 
called the "recognition and equal protection of private, state, 
and municipal property, and freedom of economic activity" the 
most important provision of the document. 
  Particular attention is being devoted to the legal 
regulation 
of the creation and activity of economic companies and 
partnerships, which are becoming the main participants in 
entrepreneurial activity. A special chapter is devoted to the 
state's role in civil legal relations. It is envisaged that it 
will take part in such relations on an equal basis with other 
parties and is responsible for its commitments. 
  Many of the document's concepts go back to the classic 
provisions of private law. The draft consistently implements 
its norms, which are based on "the quality of the sides building 
the relations, and on their right to independently resolve 
matters without interference from others, including state 
organs." By granting citizens an opportunity to exercise their 
rights as they see fit, the draft obliges them to "act 
conscientiously, reasonably, and fairly, observing the demands 
of the law, moral principles, and the rules of business ethics," 
Vasiliy Vitryanskiy pointed out. 
  There are three sections in the draft of Section One of the 
code, including a section on the right of ownership. This 
fundamental document contains 450 articles. It has been 
discussed by the Russian Federation Government Presidium. A 
working group with the participation of representatives of the 
State Committee for the Management of State Property, the 
Ministry of the Economy, and the banks has also examined 
proposals from Russian Federation components and several dozen 
interested institutions. The draft has had expert scrutiny from 
world-famous civil law scholars in the Netherlands, the FRG, the 
United States, Italy, and France. Its adoption will "ensure the 
stability of civil legislation, without which the economy cannot 
develop normally."

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Viktor Petrenko] </F>
  [Text] Moscow April 12 TASS -- The Russian Government has 
made the first practical step towards the settlement of its 
drawn-out conflict with the country's miners: On its 
instructions, the Central Bank of Russia today remitted 300 
billion roubles to local branches to pay the delayed wages in 
the mining regions. This is the first of the weekly batches to 
be forwarded to the mining regions during this month. 
  A wave of miners' strikes first swept the country in the 
middle of last year - the colliers protested against delayed 
wage packets and lack of state support for the industry which 
was fighting for survival. The situation repeated itself in 
March of 1994, this time around it culminated in the picketing 
of the houses of government at the end of the month. The miners 
demanded an immediate repayment of the budget debt for the last 
quarter of 1993 and the first quarter of 1994, which by that 
time had amounted to 800 billion roubles. They also demanded 
that the customers pay off their accumulated debt of more than 
one trillion roubles. 
  As a result of negotiations between the colliers' labour 
union and the government it was decided that Moscow would pay 
the industry 300 billion roubles a week beginning on April 13. 
  "It will take a few days before the money reaches the 
miners," said Vitaliy Budko, chairman of the Rosugleprof Labour 
Union. This will add tension to the already grave situation in 
some mining areas. For example, forty miners refuse to come up 
from the Mayskaya mine in Chelyabinsk region, demanding that 
they be paid wages for work done in January, February and March.

  [Text] The Russian Federation Social Security Ministry has 
confirmed that from May Day, implementation will be continued of 
President Boris Yeltsin's decree on raising the previously fixed 
retirement pensions, which started on 1 April. This statement 
was distributed today in connection with the appearance in some 
mass media of a so-called denial by Russia's Pension Fund 
regarding the indexation of pensions on May Day. In short, 
pensions will go up -- that is the most important thing.

<F P=106> [Interview with Girgoriy Yavlinskiy, economic expert, Duma </F>
deputy, and chairman of the "Yabloko" reform party, by Gemma 
Poerzgen in Germany; date not given: "Russia's Change Must 
Begin at the Roots"] 
  [Text] [Poerzgen] You are a deputy of the new Duma, the 
Russian Parliament. What can you achieve there in political 
terms? 
  [Yavlinskiy] We have no election law, no civil code, no 
economic law, and no penal code. We have to create all this. 
This has the utmost priority. And as long as this is the case, 
work is very difficult. Sometimes this looks a bit wild and 
exotic to the West. 
  [Poerzgen] In what respect is the new parliament different 
from the old Supreme Soviet? 
  [Yavlinskiy] It has greater legitimacy. However, it is 
nevertheless a transition parliament, rather a constitutional 
assembly. Its role primarily is to amend the Constitution. In 
short, our Duma must solve a number of basic tasks. 
  [Poerzgen] You are in Germany for a week to present your 
book "Reform From Below -- Russia's New Future," which has now 
also been published in German. In this book you write that an 
era of reform has come to an end in Russia. The reform from 
above must not be followed by reconstruction from below. What 
does this mean specifically? 
  [Yavlinskiy] Reform begins only when the people's lives are 
changing. The economic system, which we created 80 years ago, 
is rooted very deeply. Thus, if we really want to change this 
system, we must begin at the roots. If we bring about changes 
there, we can also solve the bigger tasks. Russia is an 
enormous country, where very different people live, and they 
have very different ideas of success and of how one should live. 
If we really want to achieve something, these people must be 
permitted to act as they consider right. Moscow cannot answer 
all these questions. 
  [Poerzgen] This means that the Russian Federation needs 
stronger decentralization and regionalization? 
  [Yavlinskiy] Moscow must look to the regions and listen what 
the people there want and help them to do what they want. If 
one region wants to implement reform in this own way, it must be 
supported in this. And if other regions take different paths, 
Moscow must help there, too. This is very important regarding 
the entire legislation, for instance. It is impossible that 
someone in the capital city thinks up the laws. They should be 
shaped in such a way that they take the interests of those 
people who have to live with these laws into consideration. The 
central power is needed to implement the laws as soon as they 
have grown from below. It must take care that they are indeed 
observed. This would then be a rule- of-law state with a reform 
from below and control from above. 
  [Poerzgen] Another point that clearly distinguishes from 
other reformers is the importance that you attribute to social 
security. 
  [Yavlinskiy] As long as the people do not have the 
possibility to earn their living themselves, this is 
unavoidable. We can take a more liberal economic course only to 
the extent to which we manage to give the people the opportunity 
to earn their living. Just imagine for a moment what would have 
happened if eastern Germany had not had western Germany. The 
government would have been deposed and it would have been said: 
Do what you want: laissez faire. And what would have 
happened? No system can work in this way. Liberalism must 
include the people are able to earn their living. If a country 
has been structured like one big single enterprise for 80 years, 
one cannot turn it into a market economy overnight. 
  [Poerzgen] Now you are trying to implement your approach of 
a different reform policy in the region of Nishniy Novgorod? 
  [Yavlinksiy] In Nishniy Novgorod we have set ourselves a 
very specific task. We have changed the system of social 
safeguards and, at the same time, we have begun with 
privatization. Thus, in Russia there are, for instance, a large 
number of apartments that are administered by the enterprises. 
The enterprises must use 90 percent of their profits to 
maintain the apartments, for kindergartens, and for other social 
tasks. Such an enterprise cannot develop, no one is going to 
invest in it. If such a company is closed down, the entire town 
is closed down. 
  In Nizhniy Novgorod we take the money that has so far been 
used to maintain the apartments and channel it into the people's 
income. At the same time, we give them housing. Interestingly 
enough, the costs immediately go down to one-third. And 
therefore one must not frighten the people. One must not tell 
them that the apartments are privatized, but it is better that 
one calls them housing cooperatives. That is something that the 
people understand. As soon as the cooperative has been 
established, the people find it possible to rent certain rooms 
and can afford craftsmen for repairs. And this continues to 
develop. If many of these cooperatives develop, they can become 
shareholders, for instance in the gas sector or waste disposal. 
In this way it is possible, bit by bit, to take social services 
out of the enterprises. This is what I call the conversion of 
social infrastructure. 
  [Poerzgen] Do you find support for your ideas in the 
government? 
  [Yavlinskiy] Somehow, no one is really against it. But no 
one does anything for it, either. Everyone talks more about how 
high the dollar exchange rate is than about the budget deficit. 
Of course, this is very important, but we will never achieve a 
normal dollar exchange rate and an acceptable budget deficit as 
long as we do not put the institutional framework of our 
national economy in order. 
  [Poerzgen] What kind of support do you expect from the 
West? 
  [Yavlinskiy] The most important thing is intellectual and 
moral support. For us it is primarily important that the West 
understands the problems that we have to solve. 
  [Poerzgen] Do you find this understanding? 
  [Yavlinskiy] Unfortunately no. First, it is probably not 
easy. Second, politics in the West has long become a show in 
many respects. Fortunately, most people in the West live and 
work far removed from politics. However, the principles of this 
show are also applied in the relationship with our country. 
Therefore, times of ardent love for Russia are again and again 
replaced by times of hysterical cooling down. Perhaps this is 
good for Western policy. We, on the other hand, need a calm and 
sober look at what we are doing. We do not want do be praised 
to high heaven, nor do we want to be damned. We need calm and 
sober cooperation that remains independent of personal political 
ambitions. We would want the West not so much to be oriented 
toward individual persons, but to look more at the processes. 
Then our cooperation would be more solid. 
  Regarding financial aid, I am, first, of the opinion that we 
must repay our debts. Second, it is not the scope of aid that 
is most important but specific projects. For instance, I would 
prefer seeing $100 million spent on providing farmers with 
technical equipment, for instance mini-transporters. This is 
better than getting billions of dollars so that the government 
uses them for stabilizing the ruble. I think that it is more 
important for the stabilization of the ruble that the farmer is 
able to take his potatoes to the shops. 
  [Poerzgen] How do you assess the work of Western advisers in 
this connection? 
  [Yavlinskiy] First of all, I am grateful to all who help 
Russia. However, I would like to recall that, in 
pre-revolutionary Russia, engineers who built bridges stood 
under them when the first train went across. After all, the 
lives of many people are involved. One must be aware of this 
responsibility.

<F P=106> [Sergey Chugayev article: "Is There Any Chance of Accord </F>
When the Political Struggle Is Intensifying?"] 
  [Text] The publication of the draft memorandum of civil 
accord proposed by the president, and the start of its 
discussion should undoubtedly be recognized as the most 
significant event in Russia's domestic political life last week. 
This document seems all the more important because it has 
emerged at a time when it is becoming increasingly clear that 
the political struggle in Russia is intensifying. The series of 
events that occurred last week is graphic confirmation of this. 
  The draft memorandum has dispelled the previously current 
doubts about the president's political views. In it B. Yeltsin 
convincingly proved that he is a firm advocate of the democratic 
model of the state's development and has not abandoned the idea 
of economic reforms. 
  This was also confirmed by the president's meeting with the 
leaders of the Duma faction of "Russia's Choice," in the course 
of which an obvious rapprochement took place, as distinct from 
the eve of the 12 December elections, when Yeltsin 
demonstratively distanced himself from the democratic movements. 
The decision by "Russia's Choice" to allow a number of its 
deputies to leave the faction so as to enable the "12 December" 
group to become a faction -- a decision which followed that 
meeting -- shows that at the meeting in the Kremlin an agreement 
was reached on strategic cooperation, in the course of which the 
president is reckoning on securing support for himself in the 
Duma in the form of three right-wing factions: "12 December," 
"Russia's Choice," and "Yabloko." 
  At the same time Prime Minister V. Chernomyrdin, who on the 
eve of the December elections, as we recall, followed the 
president's example and distanced himself from the Party of 
Russian Unity and Accord, which was sympathetic to him, has 
promoted S. Shakhray, the party's leader, to the rank of vice 
premier. This gives grounds to conclude that the premier is 
also seeking support in the Duma. 
  Ultimately it has to be noted that the president and the 
premier have recently been becoming increasingly independent. 
Each of them now possesses not only his own independent 
apparatus but also his "own" parliamentary factions. This is 
perfectly natural if you consider that Russia is entering a new 
stage of the reforms -- a period of mass bankruptcies and 
growing unemployment. In this situation both the president and 
the government need the support of political forces in the Duma 
which would be capable, in particular, of exerting influence 
when considering the question of the government's resignation. 
  The chief problem here is how far this independence will go 
and whether it will lead to the rupture of the alliance between 
the president and the premier. As the experience of recent 
months shows, the preservation of the alliance between Yeltsin 
and Chernomyrdin would be the very best option for the country, 
since it guarantees the monolith of the executive and, 
ultimately, stability. 
  The natural preconditions for disagreements, however, must 
also be taken into account. Above all, there is the objective 
possibility that, in the event of a deterioration in the 
socioeconomic situation, the president might sacrifice the 
government. Finally, we should not forget such a serious factor 
as the rivalry and the acute contradictions that exist between 
the apparatuses of the president and the government. 
  In this connection informed sources draw attention to the 
fact that Shakhray's appointment coincided with a weakening of 
the positions of one of his chief opponents in the president's 
entourage -- V. Ilyushin -- and in the absence of S. Filatov, 
another opponent. As far as is known, Shakhray's appointment is 
viewed in apparatus circles as a victory for the government's 
apparatus over the president's. 
  Meanwhile the apparatus of the top organs of state power 
demonstrated its potential as graphically as can be during the 
scandal that erupted last week over the president's directive on 
military bases. The fact that, as S. Krasavchenko, deputy 
leader of the president's administration, reported, a serious 
investigation has been launched into this incident concerning 
the president's directive makes it possible to assume that 
Yeltsin attached greater significance to the incident than to a 
simple technical error, and maybe he is already fed up with 
being constantly deceived by his entourage. 
  As we know, this was by no means the first instance when 
unexpected documents, to put it mildly, have appeared bearing 
the president's signature. Take, for example, the case of the 
publication of the presidential edict on the transfer of the 
"Lefortovo" Detention Center from the jurisdiction of the 
Ministry of Internal Affairs to the system of the General 
Prosecutor's Office, as stated by former General Prosecutor A. 
Kazannik in an interview in TRUD 29 March. This was the edict 
which resulted in the rapid release of the Lefortovo inmates. 
It has become known that an investigation was conducted into 
that fact, during which it was ascertained that the text of the 
edict was slipped onto the president's desk by one of his 
closest aides, who was involved in a purely interdepartmental 
intrigue and did not contemplate that his actions would have 
such far-reaching political consequences and would strike a 
painful blow at the president himself. 
  In the case of the Skrunda radar station, if we rely on 
available information, it really is a question at present of a 
technical error. It is hard, however, to rid yourself of the 
impression that the error occurred at the most suitable time for 
the president's opponents -- on the eve of the signing of the 
Russian-Latvian agreement, with the result that serious damage 
was done both to the president's prestige and to Russia's. 
  Opponents today accuse the president of imposing an 
agreement 
on them from a position of strength and demanding concessions 
while not wishing to concede anything himself. It can be 
assumed that, if the tendency not to want to make compromises 
continues, then the memorandum of accord will go the same way as 
the similar decree of the Seventh Congress of People's Deputies. 
  Russia is entering the final and most complex, most 
dangerous 
period of the reforms -- the period of mass bankruptcies and 
unemployment. If it can get through it without losses and 
without breaking up the alliance between the president and the 
premier, if it is possible to preserve political stability in 
the country and not slide into taking over the opposition's 
slogans -- not to form a new external enemy, not to begin an 
imperial flexing of muscles -- then Russia might secure what is 
probably its only real chance to start climbing out of economic 
depression. In this case the possibility of an opposition 
victory will be insignificant.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS observer Lyudmila Yermakova: "Money </F>
Likes Accounting"] 
  [Text] The Russian Federation Central Electoral Commission 
has created a special control and auditing service which has 
engaged in checking accounts and expenses during the election 
campaign. A report on the expenditure of funds has been sent by 
the Central Electoral Commission to the State Duma, which will 
decide what to do about violations and violators. The Central 
Electoral Commission has no "punitive powers" in that sense and 
does not have the right to draw legal conclusions. 
  According to the financial reports, 4.68 billion rubles [R] 
including R1.3 billion from the Central Electoral Commission 
went into the electoral associations' election funds. Of that 
sum R4.62 billion were spent. The remainder was returned to the 
current account of the Central Electoral Commission, which has 
channeled it into local elections. 
  For instance, according to the all-Russia state television 
and radio broadcasting company, the "Noris" enterprise paid over 
R5 million for air time supplied to the Liberal Democratic Party 
while the "Premyer" firm paid over R33 billion for "Russia's 
Choice." Similar facts were discovered with regard to the 
payment for air time supplied by the "Ostankino" company. Thus 
the "Mars" enterprise paid over R62 million for political 
advertizing for the Democratic Party of Russia and the "Folium" 
firm paid about R18 million. Payment of nearly R75 million was 
made for the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia by the "Sokol" 
leisure center. The Sverdlovsk branch of "Kedr" financed the 
election campaign, only to the tune of R11,000, it is true, 
without crediting the money to the association's electoral fund. 
  It was discovered that in contravention of the statute on 
elections, donations to electoral associations by corporate 
bodies with the participation of foreigners were allowed. An 
additional check of these cases is now under way.

<F P=106> [Yuriy Kovalenko report: "Aeroflot Passengers Forced To </F>
Play `Russian Roulette'"] 
  [Text] Paris -- Dutch pilot Bart Bakker, president of the 
International Federation of Airline Pilots Associations, arrived 
in Russia 11 April to meet with Alfred Malinovskiy, head of 
Russia's pilots organization, and other officials to warn them 
of the need for urgent measures. 
  In turn the International Airline Passengers Association 
[IAPA], whose headquarters is in Washington, warned of the risk 
to life to which citizens from Western countries are exposing 
themselves by flying on our aircraft over Russia. It also 
called the territory of the former Soviet Union one of the two 
most dangerous areas in the world for air passengers. 
  I would also point out that many French firms are 
confidentially banning their staff from flying Aeroflot on 
business from Paris to Moscow, never mind using our domestic 
routes. The Swiss newspaper LE NOUVEAU QUOTIDIEN recently 
published a report eloquently headlined: "Aeroflot Passenger 
Plays `Russian Roulette.'" 
  Russian aircraft are in a disastrous state, the author 
writes. Airports are like hostile jungles. No one is 
responsible for them any more -- or for passengers. The 
journalist sees the "crazy privatization" of the air sector as 
the main reason for the prevailing unimaginable chaos. 
  At the same time as Bart Bakker's visit to Moscow, IAPA 
published a new report painting a gloomy picture of the 
situation in CIS countries' civil aviation. "We are extremely 
concerned by the state of affairs in Russia," IAPA Director 
David Stempler said in an interview with THE EUROPEAN. "Our 
report cites specific examples and gives advice to travelers. 
Russian airline safety is rapidly deteriorating. It will not 
come as a surprise to anyone if Russia shortly descends to 
China's level in this respect."

<F P=106> [Russian Federation President's Court of Appeal for </F>
Information Disputes Statement No. 1 "On I. Andronov's 
Publication in the Newspaper ZAVTRA"] 
  [Text] The Russian Federation President's court of appeal 
for information disputes, having examined the content of several 
items published in the mass media, television programs, and 
other information items, considers it necessary to issue the 
following statement. 
  While Russian Federation President B. Yeltsin has advanced 
and is implementing the nationwide unifying idea of civil peace 
and accord, the consolidation of the Russian state on this 
basis, and the promotion of reforms and democracy -- an idea 
which is encountering increasing support in society -- some mass 
media have adopted a drastically destructive stance. 
  The use of rumors, stories, and reports based on unverified 
facts and leading to the fueling of tragic interethnic 
conflicts, overt immorality, the groundless and unproven 
defamation of Russia's institutions of statehood, and as a whole 
the abuse of freedom of speech have unfortunately become the 
trademark of several publications and television and radio 
programs. 
  These items aimed at destabilizing the sociopolitical 
situation in Russia include I. Andronov's article "Secrets of 
the Kremlin" published in the newspaper ZAVTRA, issue no. 11 for 
16 March 1994. 
  The author tries to discredit, diminish, and hurt the 
Russian 
Federation president with profoundly immoral and malicious 
speculations on the subject of his health and, not spurning the 
basest methods, is seeking to introduce into the public 
consciousness the idea that the head of state is an incapable 
and incapacitated politician. 
  I. Andronov adorned his article with numerous quotations, 
unfounded and taken out of context, from various sources, mainly 
foreign ones, and mixed them with rumors and conversations known 
only to himself, providing the whole with his own unseemly 
comments. 
  Taking advantage of the fact that the press services of 
federal state organs do not always promptly cover the work and 
state of health of Russia's top statesmen and do not promptly 
deny various insinuations in this field, the author voice 
completely unfounded speculations, spreads absurd stories, and 
draws far-fetched historical parallels -- and all this to sow 
alarm and lack of confidence, to pile up obstacles on the path 
to civil accord. 
  But for his own highly dubious publicity he uses cock and 
bull stories which obviously have nothing to do with the author 
about his importance, the attempts made on his life, and similar 
"detective thriller" stories. 
  Assessing I. Andronov's item, the court of people realizes 
that, of course, it is futile to reason with and appeal to the 
conscience of the editor of a newspaper of the "spiritual 
opposition," which prints such items. At the same time it would 
also be wrong to leave them unheeded and unassessed, and that 
includes the odious item produced by I. Andronov. 
  A legal barrier should be erected against flagrant, 
shameless, and unjustified attacks on Russia's institutions of 
statehood and on their leaders and representatives and here 
ethical values should be used. 
  The court of appeal believes that I. Andronov's article 
"Secrets of the Kremlin" is an abuse of the free mass media and 
violates article 4 of the law on the mass media and universally 
accepted ethical norms and serves as justification for warning 
the chief editor that the newspaper ZAVTRA could cease 
publication. 
  The court of appeal is sending its statement to the Russian 
Federation Committee for the Press for the adoption of the 
measures stipulated by the law against the newspaper ZAVTRA. 
  [Signed] A. Vengerov, chairman of the court of appeal, 4 
April 1994, Moscow.

<F P=106> [Address by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin to audience </F>
at concert in the Kremlin Palace in Moscow on Cosmonautics Day 
-- live or recorded] 
  [Excerpts] Dear participants in the celebrations, dear 
veterans, scientists, cosmonauts, engineers, designers, people 
who have taken part and are taking part today in the creation of 
unique systems, I must first of all pass to you -- all of you 
who work in this sphere -- warm greetings and congratulations 
from the President of Russia Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin. 
[passage omitted] 
  Things are difficult today, yes. More difficult than ever. 
But I can tell you one thing -- despite all the difficulties 
this government will not be the last government, the one under 
which people will cease talking about cosmonautics. We will do 
all we can. I would not like to be the last premier, the one 
who stopped progress in the sphere of cosmonautics. 
  Today this really is one of the very few branches of 
Russia's 
national economy which is continuing to bring glory to and do 
great things for our country confidently, calmly, and with 
certainty. I think that the program which Russia has before it 
today -- the program before our fatherland and cosmonautics -- 
will always continue, today and tomorrow and in all the years to 
come. The things which we are doing today, the fact that we are 
creating unique systems jointly with other states, including the 
United States of America and with the countries of Europe, this 
once again uniquely testifies to the fact that Russia, the 
scientists of Russia, the techniques, and the techology created 
in Russia exists and will exist for centuries to come. [passage 
omitted] 
  Once again, dear friends, I wish you success, health and 
patience on our national festival. Thank you. [applause]

  [Text] Mirny, Arkhangelsk Region, April 12 TASS--The Topol 
(Poplar) missile complex, which has no analogues in the world, 
is not only operational with Strategic Missile Forces (SMF) to 
ensure Russia's worthy parity but is also used for peaceful 
purposes, Lieutenant-General Yuriy Zhuravlyov, chief of the 
state test site of the SMF, told ITAR-TASS on Tuesday. 
  The launch of a "Start" communicaitons satellite 
demonstrated 
the Topol's unique resources in the peaceful uses of outer 
space. A heavy-duty communications satellite is to be launched 
soon, Zhuravlyov said. 
  Within the framework of Russian defence-industry conversion 
to civilian uses, experts consider the possibility of using the 
test site facilities for participation in commercial launchings, 
in which many countries show interest. If only initial funding, 
which will subsequently bring in revenue quickly, is essential 
for implementing conversion programmes. The allocation of funds 
for the needs of the state test site of the SMF has been now 
reduced to the minimum, Zhuravlyov lamented.

  [Text] An expert of Russia's Social-Ecology Union Marina 
Khotuleva told newspeople in Moscow that the radiological 
situation in different areas of the Russian Federation was 
complicated owing to the continued operation of the state 
nuclear complex facilities. More specifically, the 
environmentalists are worried about the situation at the 
chemical plant Mayak in the Chelyabinsk Region of the Urals. 
  According to the Social-Ecology Union, Mayak produces daily 
up to 100 Mn [million] curie [Ci] of radioactive waste and dumps 
more than 1 Mn Ci into the lakes Karachai and Staroye Boloto. 
The two lakes are responsible for the contamination of the 
region's underground waters. 
  Mayak operates in a zone of high seismic activity where 
earthquakes of up to 7 points on the Richter scale can take 
place, at the same time a number of man-made lakes with a total 
of some 400 cu m [cubic meters] of liquid radioactive waste in 
them have been dug out in the main flow of the Tech River. 
  The large amount of radioctive waste in the Chelyabinsk 
Region explains why there are 60 percent more cases of 
children's leukemia in Chelyabinsk-65 and Chelyabinsk-70, where 
Mayak operates, than in other industrial centers. The 
Social-Ecology Union feels the region must be declared an 
ecological disaster zone.

<F P=106> [Tamara Smirnova report: "Buran's Creators Have Become </F>
Watchmen"] 
  [Excerpts] Only fanatics are left here now. Each morning 
they pass through the gate of their strict-regime enterprise and 
head along winding, echoing corridors to the shops and 
departments. It is hard to believe, looking at the shrouded 
instruments and the immobile bulks of machine tools, that quite 
recently everything here was humming, blinking, and vibrating -- 
in short, life was in full swing. People were working in three 
shifts, as though possessed, not requiring a rest. There was 
something fantastic in the hush-hush Science-and-Production 
Association of Automation and Instrument Building, commonly 
known as the "Pilyugin firm." [passage omitted] 
  "My shop manufactured 42 instruments for Buran," Boris 
Kurochkin, leader of precision mechanics, said. "They control 
the craft from lift-off to landing. We take a month to 'lick 
into shape' a single component. Whereas it is possible to train 
a fitter in a year or two, it takes 10-15 years to 'perfect' an 
assembler-fitter in precision mechanics. The shop is unique. 
It produces unique instruments. For comparison: In the past 
there was one Faberge, but we have several. An attempt was made 
to adapt our Faberges to flow production. The result was 
lamentable: They all skedaddled. One is in roofing, another 
guards a warehouse, yet another serves in a store. The 
explanation for all this is simple -- no wages. In the 
capitalist world a specialist of such caliber has earnings at 
the level of a banker. Here he makes less than a cleaning 
woman. How is it possible to keep an ace of precision mechanics 
on 40,000 rubles? Talk with the workers yourself...." 
  The shop where gyrostabilizer platforms are assembled and 
regulated. Here the need for cleanliness is as in an operating 
theater -- specks of dust are counted per liter of air. 
Assemblers have to wear special cambric clothes. Even the 
cloths that are technically necessary to wipe surfaces are made 
of the same very fine fabric. 
  But this was in the past. This is how it was. Today there 
are no components on the work table of team leader Zinaida 
Bakhtina -- just a ball of wool and knitting needles. 
  "Have you taken up knitting to while away the time?" 
  "Yes, unfortunately. There are no orders. Out of 22 work 
days we are employed for three or four, God willing. 
Specialists have gone into commerce. I am not suited for it. 
My soul does not accept what is going on in the country. A 
complete breakdown...." 
  Valentin Bykov, chief of the testing and diagnosis 
department, is still harsher in his views: "The democrats are 
lying when they say we squander money. Russian technology is 
exceptionally economical -- it bears no comparison with U.S. 
technology in terms of expenditure. Our engineer is more 
qualified and competent. He lets only a perfected article take 
off. In retrospect, we have had considerably fewer failures 
than the United States. But what are we forced to engage in 
now? Some businessmen came to us with their problem: They said 
they had bought equipment to counterfeit fashionable jeans but 
were afraid to install it on the second floor of a dry-cleaning 
establishment. Were the machine tools too heavy, and would the 
building suddenly collapse? We carried out their instructions 
and received money. But this is hack work! I am ashamed." 
  There is a lot of argument in the firm about conversion. In 
principle, the science-and-production association has never 
avoided tackling national economic tasks. It has been making 
medical equipment for more than a year. Designers are drawing 
up a system for the control of nuclear stations. They are 
racking their brains over a ground-effect machine, a huge 
transport craft capable of flying over the sea at low altitudes. 
Or take an instrument to predict earthquakes. Using complex 
algorithms and taking 21 indicators into account, the apparatus 
"paints" a portrait of the elements and predicts shocks long 
before they happen. But there has never been a demand for the 
method. The country is not creditworthy. It cannot afford the 
latest technologies. There can be no question of scientific 
developments for the long term. 
  No, it will not be a joyous festival for the creators of 
automatic space equipment. Rendered lifeless by 
poverty-stricken funding, the sector is withering day by day. 
But it is not even the beggarly existence that oppresses its 
creators but the lack of demand for their very lofty intellect. 
The country is losing its priorities in the world. The 
beautiful Buran has already been set up in Gorkiy Park to amuse 
the crowd. What will it be turned into -- a sideshow or maybe a 
bar? A bird that was born to fly has had its wings clipped. Is 
not the same fate being prepared for Russia?

<F P=106> [Dmitriy Kholodov report: "What Did You Bargain For After </F>
All, Men? Baykonur in Prostration Again"] 
  [Text] Presidents Yeltsin's and Nazarbayev's signatures had 
hardly dried on the Baykonur treaty when Kazakhstan Vice Premier 
Galym Abelsiitov stated: The $115 million mentioned as the rent 
to be paid for the space center is payable by Russia on a 
monthly basis. In the interpretation of the Kazakh leaders, 
this is implied in Article 4, Item 2 of the Treaty: "The 
Russian Federation shall pay to the Republic of Kazakhstan rent 
for the use of Baykonur totaling $115 million. Part of the rent 
can be paid annually on a compensation basis subject to 
agreement by the governments of the two sides." In Moscow they 
are making a helpless gesture -- we thought we were agreeing to 
pay on an annual basis! The Russian annual budget, too, calls 
only for 135 billion rubles (about $80 million). 
  It appears that the high contracting parties were only 
trying 
to agree on the sum. The basis on which it is to be paid has 
yet to be "finalized." 
  In the meantime, tomorrow is the launch, "according to the 
new rules," of the first "Proton" rocket carrying three 
satellites of the GLONASS navigation system adopted by Russia on 
24 September 1993, which enables orientation with an accuracy of 
100 meters.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Rogachev] </F>
  [Text] Moscow April 11 TASS -- Russia and the United States 
have embarked on a new stage of cooperation in outer space. 
During this stage interplanetary stations are to study the sun 
and reach Pluto, the outermost known major planet of the solar 
system. Scientific delegations on space exploration of the 
United States and Russia discussed this bold idea and a number 
of other projects for cooperation in the exploration of the 
universe. Their meeting ended on Saturday. 
  Under the programme a U.S. probe will carry a Russian 
optical 
module to the sun. A complicated trajectory of the flight has 
been charted. With the use of a highly-reliable Russian carrier 
"Proton" the probe will be put on a trajectory of a flight to 
Jupiter. When the probe is near Jupiter, the gravitation field 
of the huge planet will turn it, and it will be directed to the 
sun. Close to the sun, the Russian module will be separated and 
will collect information about the solar atmosphere and surface. 
  Another joint flight is planned for the beginning of the 
21st 
century. It will be the flight to Pluto and its satellite 
Charon. The main planets of the solar system, except for Pluto 
and Charon, have already been studied by Russian and American 
interplanetary stations. So the planned flight is of vast 
scientific interest. During the flight the Russian probe will be 
separated from the apparatus and will reach either Pluto or its 
satellite. Experts believe much promise is offered by the idea 
of using a U.S.-made small-size apparatus with new instruments 
and a large-capacity Russian booster-rocket and a Russian-made 
descendable probe meant for measurements in the atmosphere and 
surface photography. Aside from other advantages, this 
cooperation will make it possible to reach the remotest planet 
of the solar system in less than ten years. 
  Exploration of Mars is planned to be continued. Two 
spacecraft carrying Russian and American scientific equipment 
are planned to be launched to Mars in 1998 and 2001. 
  Plans for cooperation in astronomy and astrophysics were 
also 
considered. Experts believe that spectro-roentgen-gamma project 
will make it possible to create an orbital observatory to try 
unravel space mysteries such as black holes, neutron stars, 
pulsars, novas and supernovas and to study the universe. There 
is also an interesting project for an orbital radio observatory, 
Radioastron. 
  The final document of the meeting was signed by Wesley 
Huntress, a chief of NASA, the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration, and Yuriy Milov, deputy general director of the 
Russian Space Agency.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Pavel Kuznetsov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow April 12 TASS -- "We are passing over from 
voucher privatization to the financial and investment one," 
chairman of the Russian State Committee for Property and Russian 
Vice-Premier Anatoliy Chubays told parliamentary hearings "on 
results of privatization and control over state property in the 
Russian Federation" at the state Duma here today. 
  In the words of Chubays, the main thing about the new stage 
of privatization is the upcoming reconstruction of joint stock 
enterprises. Their reconstruction is impossible without 
considerable investments in the Russian economy, said Chubays. 
That is why, the fact "millions of U.S. dollars and billions of 
rubles have been invested in privatized enterprises to ensure 
their high-efficiency and stability" was the most important 
result of the voucher privatization. 
  He said the committee is creating a net work of special 
funds 
to ensure investment support of privatized enterprises. Another 
result of voucher privatization is privatization of 70 per cent 
of small ventures. He said this process will be completed by 
fall 1994. At the same time, 15,000 out of the 19,000 large and 
medium enterprises have been turned into joint stock societies, 
which means "large privatization" has begun. 
  In the opinion of Chubays, "privatization vouchers created a 
single property space in Russia," and voucher auctions have 
proved their efficiency. Some 650 voucher investment funds are 
working in Russia, they are absolutely necessary element of the 
financial market and efficient market economy, said Chubays. In 
his opinion, the funds will make the core of the non-state 
system of investments in the Russian economy. 
  At the same time, privatization has its costs. Speaking of 
crimes related to privatization, Chubays said his committee has 
"established close contacts with the federal 
counter-intelligence service" and this cooperation has brought 
results.

<F P=106> [Article by State Duma Deputy Boris Fedorov: "Budget </F>
Federalism or Russia's Collapse?"] 
  [Text] During the recent presentation of the budget, 
representatives of the government complained of the behavior of 
individual republics inside Russia which have failed to pay 
enormous sums into the federal budget. They complained and, to 
judge by press reports, went to create one more economic 
security service or to repeal the latest unconsidered decision 
such as increasing import tariffs. 
  Can you imagine a situation in which some state, prefecture, 
province, or even canton in another state ventured to withhold 
state taxes? Only in a nightmare. It simply does not happen, 
since it means the collapse of the state. 
  But in our country right now a single-channel system has in 
fact been introduced for the collection and transfer of taxes by 
Russian Federation republics like Bashkiria, Tataria, and 
Chechnya. Yakutia, Karelia, and other components of our 
Federation are making claims on the revenue earmarked for the 
federal budget. 
  The authorities' reaction? In the majority of cases it is a 
strikingly passive indifference. Last year attention was 
successfully drawn to this issue and the president's edict on 
sanctions for nonpayers was published. Separatist agreements 
between the center and the components of the Federation were not 
undertaken. 
  You form the impression that many of our eminent politicians 
have confused federation and confederation. 
  What separate agreements can there be, what ownership of 
land, the subterranean depths, resources, and property by 
components of the federation, and what single-channel budget can 
there be? All this is a direct path to Russia's collapse. The 
people will hardly agree to that without objecting. 
  The legal assignment to components of such rights for 
components within the framework of some agreements or additions 
to the Federation Treaty is intolerable. It is already clear 
that it was the center's weakness which led to the adoption of 
an incomplete Federation Treaty, to the issue of countless 
benefits and privileges on a purely political basis in exchange 
for alleged support. It is characteristic that the more 
unjustified the concessions, the less respect for the center. 
Everything has been turned upside down. 
  Any recognition of the legitimacy of the single-channel 
system for collecting taxes and of the special rights of 
republics inside Russia leads to similar demands from the 
oblasts. A number of them are already raising these questions 
officially. Ideologists of the Ural Republic and other similar 
plans are well represented in the Federation Council. 
  The principle of budget federalism -- the separation of the 
budget and taxes and a precise revenue base for the center and 
the components of the Federation -- has successfully been 
included in the new budget system elaborated by the Ministry of 
Finances last year. If this system is adopted by the Federal 
Assembly we have a chance of resolving the problem peacefully. 
  We desperately need a tough political solution which would 
ideally contain the following points: 
  -- unity of status and equal rights and powers for all 
components of the Federation; 
  -- the categorical rejection of any forms of a 
single-channel budget system and of the adoption of the 
principle of the property of components of the Federation; 
  -- the rejection of the Center's separatist agreements 
with individual components of the Federation which infringe on 
Russia's interests as a unified state, of endless subisidies to 
the regions for political reasons, and of attempts to isolate 
"national" banks in the republics; 
  -- the banning of any attempts to discriminate against the 
republics' nonindigenous population; 
  -- the toughest sanctions against those who have violated 
the principles of the federation. 
  What has been said does not mean that it is necessary to 
continue the separation of the powers of the levels of power, to 
decentralize the budget system, develop a two-channel taxation, 
or expand the rights of the components of the Federation in the 
economic field. 
  But delay in this field is like death. The state's 
strikingly unprofessional and impotent policy in this field is 
surprising. History will not forgive us the collapse of Russia, 
it must be halted.

<F P=106> [Natalya Varnavskaya, Valeriya Ochinyan report in the "New </F>
Tax System Debated" column: "Yekaterinburg Is For a New Reform"] 
  [Text] Addressing a conference of heads of oblast and 
republic administrations in the Urals region on 9 April, Sergey 
Glazyev, chairman of the State Duma Economic Policy Committee, 
stated that the existing "tax system of Russia is a direct 
threat to the country's economy." In this context the 
Yekaterinburg-based association Russia's Taxes has been tasked 
within a month to work out and present to the State Duma a 
basically new tax system because without reforming the tax 
legislation "it is impossible even to start discussing the 1995 
budget." Experts, however, doubt the feasibility of tax reform 
"Glazyev style." 
  The Russia's Taxes association favors the idea of reforming 
the tax legislation in effect since 1992. The proposed concept 
was approved by sessions of the Sverdlovsk Oblast Council and 
the Russian Government. Nonetheless up to now it has not been 
viewed as a serious alternative to the existing taxation system. 
  According to information in possession of KOMMERSANT-DAILY, 
the Yekaterinburg concept envisions a reduction (value-added tax 
from 20 percent to 13 percent) or full abolition (profit and 
income taxes) of those taxes which at present constitute the 
bulk of budget revenues, and also increasing the rate of 
resource and property taxes. It is proposed also to abolish the 
tax for exceeding the wages fund and basically to revise 
procedures for taxing enterprise property (exclude the 
enterprises' monetary assets from the tax base). The plan is to 
tax funds used for consumption; to impose a tax on the export of 
capital, the franchise to produce minerals, and "on ecology." 
According to estimates by the concept's authors, if their 
system is adopted, the taxation level for enterprises in the 
processing industry will constitute not more than 25 percent 
(instead of 44 percent at present). Moreover, increasing the 
tax on property will lead to its more effective and rational use. 
  According to KOMMERSANT-DAILY's experts, in spite of the 
fact 
that it is supported by a wide circle, the adoption of the new 
tax program promoted by Sergey Glazyev is unlikely -- because 
the idea of such a reform in the tax legislation is opposed not 
only by influential factions in the State Duma led by Gaydar 
(Russia's choice), Nikolay Medvedev (New Regional Policy), and 
Boris Fedorov (12 December), and representatives of the Finance 
Ministry and the State Tax Service but also representatives of 
the presidential administration. Thus, Yevgeniy Yasin, chief of 
the administration's analytical center, stated at a recent 
Interaction club meeting that "if the government does something 
`Glazyev style,' it would be a catastrophe."

rise in the number of people living below the poverty line. 
That was stated by Russian Federation Vice Premier Yuriy Yarov 
at a press conference in Moscow. Labor Minister Gennadiy 
Melikyan, who was also there, announced that according to the 
figures for February, 16.7 percent of Russians were living below 
the poverty line. "This is the lowest figure since 1991," he 
noted. At the same time, Vice Premier Yu. Yarov noted that a 
sharp increase in the number of unemployed is expected this year.

<F P=106> [Gleb Cherkasov report under the "Employment" rubric: </F>
"Labor Minister Fear Mass Unemployment and Hopes for Sensible 
Government Policy"] 
  [Text] Gennadiy Melikyan, minister of labor and employment, 
and Fedor Prokopov, head of the Federal Employment Service, 
yesterday briefed journalists on the general situation on the 
Russian labor market, presented data on today's level of 
unemployment, and tried to forecast the immediate future. 
  According to Mr. Melikyan and Mr. Prokopov, as of today 
employment services have registered 1 million unemployed while 
another 3 million people did not wish to solve the problems of 
their employment with the aid of official structures and are 
looking for jobs on their own. The number of partially employed 
is approximately 4 million people, but Mr. Melikyan underlined 
that it was virtually impossible to do a precise count of those 
affected by "hidden" unemployment. Speaking about prospects of 
unemployment's growth, Mr. Melikyan and Mr. Prokopov differed 
somewhat in their assessments. According to the minister, the 
number of unemployed will amount to around 3 million by the end 
of 1994, while the employment service head thought that as many 
as 3 million would apply to his agency alone with the total 
number of unemployed being considerably higher. As for "hidden" 
unemployment, according to the Ministry of Labor's rough 
estimates, it will amount to between 4-8 million people by the 
end of 1994. Explaining the reasons for such a wide spread in 
the forecast figures, Mr. Prokopov pointed out that the Ministry 
of Labor and the Employment Service are to a certain degree 
"hostage to the government course," and that if a "tough" 
financial policy is followed, the number of evident and hidden 
unemployed may exceed the projected figures. Gennadiy Melikyan 
also stated that unlike many Western European countries, Russia 
would not be able to bear a 25-percent unemployment level "owing 
to peculiarities of the national character." 
  According to Mr. Prokopov, the unemployment problem is 
especially acute in Ivanovo Oblast, Ingushetia, and in the Far 
North. As for hidden unemployment, this ailment affects most 
regions where the defense industry is predominant. Speaking 
about measures the Labor Ministry is taking regarding retraining 
of the unemployed, Mr. Prokopov stated that the structures that 
had done that in the past are in ruins and that "serious 
financial injections" are necessary to restore them. 
  At the same time, in Mr. Prokopov's opinion, finding a job 
is 
not that difficult, but the existing vacancies mainly offer a 
stable job at low pay (working in the state sector), or high pay 
in the absence of the usual labor guarantees (new economy). 
  Touching on the question of possible competition for jobs 
from refugees and economic immigrants to those who live in 
Russia, Mr. Prokopov pointed to the fact that their pressure on 
the labor market is insignificant. 
  Speaking about current migration processes, Mr. Melikyan 
pointed out the existence of two main processes: an outflow of 
the population from the Far North to the European part of 
Russia, and a partial outflow of the urban population to rural 
areas. Having noted the irreversibility of the depolicization 
process, the minister recognized the economic objectivity of 
mass migration from the areas of the Far North and stated that 
his agency is preparing a federal program designed to facilitate 
social adaptation of resettlers.

year fell in comparison with the same period of last year by 
nearly 25 percent. A year ago the analogous index amounted to 
only 19.3 percent. About 5,000 enterprises were forced to 
suspend production in the first quarter in the majority of cases 
because of problems with the sale of output. INTERFAX notes 
that at the beginning of last year the analogous stoppages 
occurred for lack of components, fuel, and raw materials.

  [Text] In the first quarter of 1994, industrial production 
went down by 24.9 percent in Russia compared to the same period 
in 1993 -- the highest index since reforms began. A year ago, 
industrial decline stood at 19.3 percent. Russia's State 
Statistics Committee told Interfax that the rate of industrial 
decline had increased from 23.1 percent to 24.1 percent in 
February, and to 27.4 percent in March. In experts' estimate, 
volumes of production are being increasingly determined by 
demand, not by the availability of resources which was typical 
over the previous couple of years. 
  Production stoppages occurred at almost 5,000 enterprises. 
However, whereas at the beginning of last year stoppages were 
mostly due to shortages of components, raw materials and fuel, 
in the first quarter of 1994 stoppages were caused by the 
absence of demand. In the consumer sector, for instance, it is 
difficult to sell products because of the population's 
re-orientation to imported goods. 
  The fuel and energy branches have reduced the production of 
oil and coal by 9-15 percent (the production of gas remaining 
stable), machine-building and light-industry enterprises have 
cut down production almost two times, the chemical industry by 
25-30 percent, steel industry by 20-25 percent and food industry 
by 10-20 percent. In the first quarter of the year, Russia 
produced 75.7 Mn [million] tonnes of oil, which is 15 percent 
down from the volume produced during the same period last year.

<F P=106> [Arkadiy Nikiforov report in the "Power" column: "Boris </F>
Yeltsin Supports Yuriy Skokov's Proposals. Viktor Chernomyrdin 
Has Been Tasked With Promoting Collaboration With the Russian 
Commodity Producers Federation"] 
  [Text] As has become known, Boris Yeltsin recently 
considered and approved proposals by the Russian Commodity 
Producers Federation [CPF] urging prompt measures to salvage 
domestic industrial and agricultural production. As 
NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA reported earlier, the message by CPF 
Chairman Yuriy Skokov to the Russian president presented 
proposals on organizing a system of interaction between the 
federation and the government to map out and undertake concrete 
joint actions. Boris Yeltsin tasked Viktor Chernomyrdin with 
setting up contacts with the CPF in the interests of overcoming 
the catastrophic production decline and slowing down the growth 
in unemployment. 
  Interestingly, the CPF's initiatives are meeting with 
approval not only in the Kremlin but also abroad. During Yuriy 
Skokov's visit to Germany in March and to France in April, 
representatives of government and business circles in those 
countries accepted the CPF's proposal to conclude agreements 
with the major employers' associations of these countries. Such 
agreements should make up the foundation for a system of 
nongovernmental interaction between Russian and foreign 
commodity producers which is expected to resolve a whole number 
of complicated problems of international economic cooperation 
and collaboration. 
  Practical activity to create a system of basically new 
interrelations between Russian manufacturers and their own 
government and foreign partners is a real step toward forming a 
complex market infrastructure, without which a free enterprise 
system cannot work effectively. In this context Yuriy Skokov's 
activity finds understanding not only among large Russian 
businesses but also, for example, in U.S. financial and banking 
circles. Thus, a member of the U.S. delegation led by the U.S. 
commerce secretary who visited Russia at the end of March stated 
that the period of reform "from above," associated with the name 
of Yegor Gaydar, has passed. Today reforms will produce an 
effect only if the painstaking efforts by Skokov and others to 
create viable elements of a modern market economy, based on 
Russia's specifics, are a success. 
  Next to Yuriy Skokov's declared intention to contest the 
1996 
presidential elections, the tactics and strategy of his actions 
appear peculiar. Unlike other potential presidential 
candidates, he has practically given up active self-promotion in 
the mass media, apparently believing that the best advertising 
is his strongly consolidated position as a leader in domestic 
financial-industrial capital.

  [Text] In 1994 the majority of graduates from grades nine 
to 11 in general education schools and from higher educational 
establishments in Russia will swell the ranks of the unemployed. 
This was stated by Fedoro Prokopov, leader of the Federal 
Employment Service, addressing the second session of the Russian 
Academy of Social Sciences. 
  According to forecasts of specialists from the Federal 
Employment Service and the Russian Federation Ministry of 
Education, in the fall of 1994, 0.5 million school graduates and 
about 100,000 young people with higher education will be thrown 
onto the open labor market. In all, about 700,000 people will 
be left with no chance of finding work in the sphere of the 
traditional economy.

  [Text] President Geydar Aliyev has concluded his visit to 
the country's southwest. Our correspondent Ramiz Meshedihesenli 
reports: 
  [Begin Meshedihesenli recording] On the second day of the 
visit to the southeast region, on 10 April, Azerbaijani 
President Geydar Aliyev -- who was accompanied on his tour by 
Defense Minister Mamedrafi Mamedov; state advisers Gabil 
Guseyinli and Arif Rehimzade; AZERTAC director Vagif Rustemov; 
the chairman of the State Television and Radio Broadcasting 
Company, Babek Guseyinoglu; and other officials -- left for 
another hot spot on the front. 
  The land was under the treacherous enemy's occupation until 
the end of last year. After the call made by Azerbaijani 
President Geydar Aliyev, the brave youths threw themselves into 
the battle and forced the enemy to withdraw some considerable 
distance. Even now, they are waging a life and death battle to 
liberate our land. 
  The supreme commander familiarized himself closely with the 
troops' ability to use military hardware, their combat 
readiness, and defensive ability. The Azerbaijani Army's 
fighters in this sector assured the Republic's president that 
they will not withdraw one step in the face of the enemy and 
that now that they have gained experience they have the power 
and ability to oust the Armenians from the occupied land. 
  Aliyev was interested in our troops' social conditions, 
concerns, and problems. He awarded the rank of captain to a 
promoted soldier. With fighting taking place just a few 
kilometers away, the supreme commander gave advice to the troops. 
  Later, Aliyev and his entourage left for the fronts in 
Agdamskiy, Agdzhabedinskiy, and Khodzhavend Rayons. Just a 
month ago, the enemy was forced to withdraw some considerable 
distance thanks to the talent of the brave soldiers. Now our 
troops here can open fire and silence the enemy's firing 
positions. Here too, Supreme Commander Geydar Aliyev 
familiarized himself with the combat readiness of our troops. 
He said he was proud of these fighters who are ready to 
sacrifice their lives to clear our land of the Armenians. He 
donated watches to soldiers who killed many enemy soldiers. 
  Before leaving the hot spot, officers and soldiers asked 
that 
they be pictured with Supreme Commander Geydar Aliyev. 
  On the afternoon of 10 April, President Aliyev arrived in 
Bardinskiy Rayon. The people received our Republic's president 
with roses and flowers and applause. The representatives of the 
community gathered in front of the local administrative building 
and noted that we could extricate ourselves from the current 
critical situation and war conditions only with Aliyev's 
guidance. 
  In his sincere talks with the rayon's population and 
refugees' representatives, the president issued concrete 
instructions to government officials, ministers, and regional 
leaders on the solution of the problems raised. 
  Aliyev also addressed the Barda population. 
  Later a meeting was held with the participation of the 
leaders of the nearby rayons, law enforcement organs, and 
fighters. It was reiterated that the country cannot be 
extricated from its grave situation alone and that everyone must 
unite and fight the enemy on the front. 
  The speakers touched upon the difficulties being faced in 
connection with the military call-up and exchanged views on 
removing the obstacles before [words indistinct] workers. 
Instructions were issued to the rayon leaders on the refugees' 
problems. Azerbaijani President Aliyev summed up the meeting 
[end recording].

<F P=106> [Stanislav Chekalin video report from Kaliningrad; from the </F>
"Utro" program] 
  [Text] The case of the Lithuanian Selma Construction 
Association has become a strange, almost detective story. It 
was building housing in Kaliningrad for families of officers 
being withdrawn from the Baltic states. 
  We have often talked about Vladis Laurinavichius, director 
general of Selma, who concluded a private contract with the 
Russian Defense Ministry to develop a residential area of 2,000 
apartments and about the impressive construction site that he 
began near Kaliningrad that provided work for several thousand 
Lithuanian construction workers. The Russian Defense Ministry 
in turn was a reliable contractor and by agreement turned over 
part of the Baltic Fleet's property, money, and oil as barter to 
the Lithuanian side. In return it was to receive quality housing. 
  It would seem that one could ask for nothing more, that a 
mechanism for a civilized and mutually beneficial solution to 
the troop withdrawal problem had been found. This was precisely 
what permitted the redeployment of units from Lithuania in a 
short period of time. However, it seems that this situation was 
not to the liking of representatives of the opposition, who are 
longing for power. 
  And then the Lithuanian special services unexpectedly 
arrested Vladis Laurinavichius for allegedly storing explosives 
in his apartment, on the very day he was planning to go to 
Kaliningrad to meet Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev. 
  [Video cuts to show Russian Defense Minister Grachev talking 
to camera] 
  [Begin Grachev recording] He, Vladis, was told that I am 
carrying a directive from the prime minister in which the 
payment terms were stipulated. In other words, I have brought 
the barter goods for them. We were supposed to settle with him 
with oil as we had envisaged. So, as you can see, I have the 
directive in my briefcase but I cannot hand it to the director 
general nor can I thank him. [end recording] 
  So it looks like a detective story, does it not? However, I 
think it has been written in a rather clumsy way and not in the 
best traditions of this style. One may ask: Why does a major 
businessman who deals with money totalling billions need to 
store explosives in his apartment? None of the representatives 
of Lithuanian Sejm deputies who arrived at the construction site 
could answer this question. However, they showed obvious 
eagerness to continue the Selma Association's work, however, in 
such a way that the profits would not go to the association but 
to designated government functionaries. 
  This position did not find any support among the Baltic 
Fleet 
command, which concluded the agreement with Laurinavichius and 
was confident of his responsibility, nor did it find support 
among Lithuanian construction workers. They declared that they 
are stopping work until their leader returns. This is what 
happens when politicians meddle in a normal and mutually 
beneficial business, said former Lithuanian Defense Minister 
Audrius Bytkiavichius, who defended Selma in several press 
articles. 
  In the meantime, the construction site is at a standstill 
and 
if some goodwill gestures are not forthcoming from the 
Lithuanian side, the conflict may unnecessarily complicate 
relations between the two states. 
  [Video cuts to shot of Grachev] 
  [Begin Grachev recording] Of course, I consider this to be a 
misunderstanding, moreover, because our relations with the 
Lithuanian leadership are not bad. This concerns the withdrawal 
of troops and the issue of the residence of the Russian-speaking 
population. Of course, this unpleasant moment will not benefit 
Russian-Lithuanian relations. [end recording]

  [Text] Vilnius, Apr 12, BNS -- The head of the Lithuanian 
working group for talks with the CIS, Virgilijus Bulovas, 
disagrees with Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius that a 
dialogue between Lithuania and Russia has been ruptured. 
  The prime minister expressed such a view at a press 
conference in Vilnius last Thursday [7 April]. 
  Allegations that talks with Russia broke off are unfounded, 
Lithuanian TV quoted Bulovas as saying Monday. 
  The negotiator said Lithuanian and Russian experts, dealing 
mainly with transportation problems, will be working in 
Kaliningrad all this week. At the same time, an agreement on 
employment of foreign citizens is being drafted and the 
restoration of border between Lithuania and the Kaliningrad 
region is underway. The sides also continue work on determining 
the boundaries of economic zones in the Baltic sea, Bulovas said. 
  But Slezevicius said there has been no reply to any of his 
letters to Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and all 
attempts to arrange a telephone conversation failed. 
Lithuania's primary concern is a reciprocal agreement on the 
most favored nation trade status, which is yet to be ratified by 
Russia. 
  The Lithuanian premier said Russia carries out an aggressive 
policy with respect to the Baltics. In his words, the new 
Russian import-export regulations, which came into effect March 
15, are "discriminatory." 
  The prime minister said Lithuania may respond with adequate 
measures, which would primarily affect the Kaliningrad region. 
Slezevicius said a possible retaliatory measure would be to 
impose limitations on the supply of Lithuanian electricity to 
the region.

<F P=106> [Report by Terese Staniulyte: "The Americans Will Design </F>
the Oil Terminal. The Search for Builders Continues"] 
  [Excerpts] TIESA has already reported that the government 
announced the U.S. firm "Flour Daniel Williams Brothers" the 
winner in the competition for designing the oil terminal in 
Butinge. We are acquainting the readers with the results of 
this competition in greater detail. [passage omitted] 
  The winner was expected to emerge in the first round of the 
competition in early February. However, the government decided 
then to continue negotiations with the first three winners: The 
U.S. firm "Flour Daniel Williams Brothers" which scored 91.5 
points, the Italian company "Snamprogetti" (82 points), and 
"Techint" from Argentina (80.7 points). The same proposal also 
came from the consultants of the European Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development and the London-based Rothschild 
Bank. 
  The Butinge oil terminal will be designed to import and 
export oil and its products -- the total of 12 million tonnes a 
year. Its construction was estimated at approximately $170-200 
million in February. If Lithuania had announced one winner, the 
latter could have dictated its own terms, which was 
unacceptable. Lithuania expected to reduce the costs of 
construction by extending negotiations. 
  A. Vazgilevicius, representative of the oil terminal 
construction management in Vilnius, has explained to TIESA how 
negotiations were arranged, and whether it was expedient to hold 
them if the winner was the same company as in the first round. 
  According to him, the three companies received packages of 
questions, while their responses were assessed by the same 
commission of government experts. The firms had to repeatedly 
specify some financial and technical terms of the terminal 
construction. Moreover, they had to indicate how they intended 
to use local building materials, labor force, to study the 
possibility of assembling the floating system at the Klaipeda 
shipyard, and to provide conclusions whether an additional port 
for service boats was necessary in Butinge. 
  As has already been said, all comparisons were made with the 
aim of reducing construction costs, which is important both for 
our state and the company that will design and build the oil 
terminal. After assessing the layout of the port, the subsidiary 
facilities, storages, and other criteria, "Flour Daniel" again 
emerged as the winner. In the opinion of the commission of 
experts, this company presented the best project and devoted the 
most attention among all firms to the employment of our building 
companies. 
  Attempts to "knock down" the price were also successful. 
Although A. Vazgilevicius could not tell the exact price, which 
is understandable, according to him, however, the costs 
"approximate $135-140 million" with a few-million-dollar error. 
The sum will be specified with design work under way. 
  On 11 April, "Flour Daniel" representatives are coming to 
Lithuania to prepare and sign a contract. A. Vazgilevicius 
stated that this work might take about a week. The text of the 
contract is as yet nonexistent, and it will take shape during 
negotiations by coordinating every issue. Although the 
Lithuanians have no experience in drafting such large projects, 
however, they are not afraid of this. According to A. 
Vazgilevicius, "we have official consultants of the British 
Government and support from other companies consulting on energy 
issues and working on the preparation of such typical 
contracts." Thus, the Lithuanians are not expected to lack 
competence. 
  Lithuania is also planning to invite a foreign engineering 
company that will examine proposals of design work. Asked by 
TIESA to explain the meaning of this assessment, A. 
Vazgilevicius replied that experts hired for small payment, who 
work in the sphere of supplies and building materials, will 
establish whether the prices offered by "Flour Daniel" are not 
overly high. Although these prices were linked with European 
costs, it might be possible to reduce them even more by way of 
negotiations. [passage omitted] 
  At a press conference last Thursday [31 March], Prime 
Minister A. Slezevicius said that the possibility of oil imports 
is the most important for Lithuania. Therefore, the first stage 
in erecting the oil terminal will be the construction of the 
floating platform in the sea and the laying of oil pipelines 
and, maybe, of one for oil products to Mazeikiai. This work 
will cost around $70 million. The second stage will be the 
construction of storage facilities for oil and gas products on 
the sea coast and in Butinge, and the creation of facilities for 
the export of oil products. 
  The prime minister confirmed that construction will have to 
begin in the middle of this year and will last for a year and a 
half. 
  `Flour Daniel' intends to prepare the design documentation 
in 
four months. Thus, it should be ready by August. Asked by 
Tiesa whether any construction work will be performed over those 
four months, A. Vazgilevicius explained that he could not answer 
this question. "It will depend on our agreement with `Flour 
Daniel'," he said. "It might happen that excavators will arrive 
in May and that an agreement will be reached to do something. 
Everything will become clear after representatives of the U.S. 
"Flour Daniel Williams Brothers," which will design and build 
the oil terminal in Butinge and perform its technical 
supervision, arrive to Lithuania, sit down to negotiating table, 
and `untangle all the details'." 
  While the preparation of design documents is under way, the 
government will have to make its choice about the foreign firm 
to which it would entrust the construction of the terminal. 
According to Prime Minister A. Slezevicius, "Flour Daniel" 
could also be the subcontractor. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Energy Minister Algimantas Stasiukynas by </F>
Diana Medeliene in Vilnius; date not given: "The Search for 
the Guilty Between the Poles of Politics"] 
  [Excerpt] At two recent press conferences held in the 
Seimas building many complaints were voiced to energy 
specialists. 
  Energy Minister Algimantas Stasiukynas has told journalist 
Diana Medeliene about them. 
  [Medeliene] What is your opinion on the memorandum of 
the Homeland Union concerning the delay in the construction of 
the oil terminal? 
  [Stasiukynas] The accusations by former Prime Minister G. 
Vagnorius against the current government contained in the 
memorandum look rather strange. He himself had enough time and 
possibilities to resolve this problem. 
  I think that state officials and the public were quite well 
informed about the process of choosing the site for the oil 
terminal and about the negotiations with Latvia on the 
construction of a terminal in Liepaja. However, information is 
usually acquired by those who want it. 
  If the authors of the memorandum had showed some interest in 
the conclusions of foreign experts, they would have understood 
that most of the statements in this memorandum are incorrect. 
  Concerning the value of the state enterprise "Nafta," I 
would 
like to say that the refinery is worth more than the total value 
of its equipment and other assets as it can generate profit. 
The sale price of analogous West European refineries with 
considerably more up-to-date equipment does not exceed $200-300 
million, because there is a lack of demand. Therefore, 
statements that "Nafta" is a great asset that can save Lithuania 
demonstrate that some people are unaware of the current 
situation in the world oil market. 
  Regarding the terminal in Liepaja, the debate on the 
possibility of its construction did not interfere with the 
process of the oil terminal construction in Lithuania. After it 
had become clear that a large oil terminal cannot be built in 
Liepaja, we restricted ourselves to the protocol of intentions 
which envisions that Lithuanian economic entities can 
participate in its construction on a commercial basis. The 
statement that Lithuania is depriving itself of finances for the 
construction of a foreign terminal is absolutely groundless. 
  [Medeliene] Energy specialists are being reprimanded 
for high prices of energy resources. Society lacks sufficient 
information about the way tariffs and prices are set. Maybe, it 
is for this reason that each price hike is greeted with new 
attacks. 
  [Stasiukynas] I would like to compare the conclusions of the 
Seimas commission investigating the situation in the energy 
market with those of experts. 
  First of all, the trade in oil products. Members of the 
commission have claimed that oil products bought from the 
Mazeikiai refinery should be cheaper. These products are 15-20 
percent more expensive than those bought on the market. 
Therefore, the production of the Mazeikiai enterprise is sold 
outside the country. The Mazeikiai thermal electric power 
station alone has bought petroleum residue from "Nafta" because 
the two enterprises are technologically connected. The energy 
system experienced losses due to that. 
  Lithuania has the lowest prices for energy resources by 
comparison with other similarly developed countries. This means 
that the energy management is not so bad. It is maintained that 
the growth of energy prices is the cause of troubles in most 
industries and agriculture. However, electricity and heating 
prices have risen two-fold over the entire period of inflation, 
while those of food, consumer goods, and various services have 
increased from three to 10 times. Energy prices will 
undoubtedly rise in the future, but at a lower rate. 
Incidentally, the energy generated at the nuclear plant is 
cheaper, because the plant uses nuclear fuel cassettes 
previously bought at lower prices. We will have to pay much 
more for them now. In our country, fuel prices account for 86 
percent of the total energy costs, while in the West they do not 
exceed 40 percent. I would like to stress, however, that the 
rise in energy prices must be strictly coordinated with that of 
living standards. The steep price rise recommended to us by 
foreign experts is unacceptable to Lithuania. 
  Speaking about prices for supplying centralized heating, I 
would like to note that in Europe they are between $40 and $50 
per one Gcal [gram calorie], that is, two or three times more 
expensive than in Lithuania. I regret that our ministry 
employees provided incorrect information about European prices. 
In the opinion of World Bank experts and specialists on energy 
prices, Lithuania's prices are extremely low, while credits will 
be extended to our country when these prices are economically 
reasonable. Thus, assessments are quite controversial. 
Therefore, the government has set up the Commission for 
Regulating Energy Prices on the initiative of the Energy 
Ministry, headed by the finance minister, which also includes 
representatives of all interested offices and organizations. 
Incidentally, the production of state energy concerns is 
cheaper than that of private companies. 
  We also share the opinion that industrial enterprises should 
not pay more for energy than residential units. Last year, 
residents paid 15 times less (three times this year) than 
enterprises. They are unable to pay the total price. 
Therefore, we must preserve compensation for another two or 
three years. 
  I would like to stress that the setting of energy tariffs is 
a state policy rather than an economic problem of energy 
enterprises. One takes into account energy prices in neighboring 
states when setting tariffs in one's own country. 
  [Medeliene] The press and the press conferences in the 
Seimas addressed the privatization of energy facilities. There 
have been different opinions on this topic. How could you 
explain them? 
  [Stasiukynas] The accusation that there are plans to 
privatize a small percentage of the assets at energy facilities 
sounds strange. Every economist should know what percentage of 
the stockholding at an enterprise accounts for. A very small 
portion of these assets should be privatized in the first stage. 
Later, enterprises should be turned into stock companies, 
issuing their stock, attracting capital for investment, and 
accumulating working capital. Such enterprises should further 
remain under state control. [passage omitted]

of the Agreements With Russia"] 
  [Excerpt] Riga, 4 Apr -- [Passage omitted] The 
information center of the Latvian Defense Ministry has 
disseminated information saying that the headquarters of the 
Russian Northwestern Army Group is carrying out intensive 
activities aimed at increasing the number of retired Army 
servicemen in Latvia. A large scale demobilization of officers 
is said to be currently under way on the Latvian territory; many 
of the officers of liquidated units are being transferred to 
regular posts in other units stationed in Latvia; warrants for 
permanent residence are being requested from the Immigration and 
Citizenship Department in districts where there are no Army 
units officially stationing in Latvia; military servicemen of 
the Russian Army are illegally obtaining passports with Latvian 
residence registration, in order to infiltrate later among the 
Latvian population; military pensioners engage in commercial 
ventures, establishing their own companies and creating security 
brigades for their protection, which can be later used in armed 
actions against Latvia.

  [Text] Today, the command of the Northwestern Group of 
Russian Forces submitted to the Latvian bureau for monitoring 
the Russian troop withdrawal data on the number of discharged 
Russian military personnel living in Latvia. According to this 
information, 21,976 discharged Russian military personnel live 
in Latvia at the moment. The majority are over 60. More than 
3,000 discharged Russian military personnel living in Latvia are 
Latvian citizens. 
  Since 28 January 1992, when Russia officially took over the 
former USSR armed forces, almost 2,000 military personnel have 
been discharged from service in Latvia and have not left for 
Russia. The report explains that these people are waiting for 
apartments in Russia and will leave Latvia after they receive 
them. 
  Ilgonis Upmalis, head of the Latvian bureau for monitoring 
the withdrawal of the Russian army, will also send this 
information to State President Guntis Ulmanis.

  [Text] The Belarus Foreign Ministry has received an 
official note from the Latvian Foreign Ministry asking for an 
expalanation about Belarus Foreign Minister Petr Kravchanka's 
statements about the discrimination against Belarusians in 
Latvia. 
  On 5 April, after the talks with UN Secretary General 
Butrus-Butrus Ghali, Kravchanka stated that one of the main 
subjects of the talks was how Latvia and Estonia carry out their 
duties as regards Belarusians living there and the predicament 
of Belarusians in those countries. 
  Kravchanka accused the two Baltic states and said that 
Belarusians living in Latvia and Estonia suffer from certain 
discrimination. He did not exclude the possibility of Belarus 
proposing that the United Nations pass a resolution on the legal 
status of Belarusians in the event it is not improved.

  [Text] Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis spent today on a 
working visit to Paris where he met French Prime Minister 
Edouard Balladur and Foreign Minister Alain Juppe. They 
consulted on Latvian-Russian relations and on the agreements 
initialled on the withdrawal of the Russian Army. 
  France proposed that Latvia use the so-called Balladur plan 
-- the European security and stability pact, to tackle these 
problems. The inauguration of the pact is scheduled to take 
place in Paris at the end of May. The pact provides for the 
involvement of third countries in tackling neighborly relations 
between two countries. Latvia has supported the Balladur plan. 
However, specific problems which Latvia would wish to tackle in 
the framework of the plan are still under discussion. 
  Russia's attitude to the Balladur plan is not yet clear. 
Foreign Minister Juppe expressed the idea that France may play 
a mediating role at the Latvian-Russian talks.

  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] French Foreign Minister Alain 
Juppe approved of Latvian-Russian interstate agreements 
initialled on 15 March, because Russia would undertake the 
internationally controlled commitment to withdraw its troops 
from Latvia by 31 August. According to Juppe, Latvia can rely 
on French support on the issue of the Russian Army withdrawal. 
He also said that France has always considered that the army 
has to be withdrawn unconditionally and it cannot be related to 
other issues, for example the status of Russian-speaking 
residents in Latvia. 
  Juppe supported Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis' proposal 
to 
set up an international support fund to eliminate the 
consequences of the work of the Skrunda radar station and the 
social tension caused in Latvia by Russian military pensioners. 
According to Ulmanis, with the creation of such a fund talks 
would continue and internal political crisis in the Baltic 
region would be abated.

  [Text] Riga, Apr 12, BNS -- The mixed committee of the 
European Free Trade Association [EFTA] and Latvian Government 
meets Tuesday [12 April] in Riga to discuss economic situation 
in EFTA member states and Latvia in view of the process of 
European integration. 
  The exchange of technical assistance programs and joint 
projects will be another issue on the meeting's agenda. 
  The basic cooperation agreement between EFTA and Latvia 
provides for assistance in statistics, customs work and state 
order policies. 
  The declaration on cooperation between EFTA states and 
Latvia 
was signed in December, 1992, in Geneva. The parties to the 
declaration made a committment to investigate cooperation 
opportunities with a view of creating the conditions for free 
trade relations. 
  The first meeting of the EFTA-Latvian mixed committee took 
place in April, 1993, in Stockholm. 
  The second meeting will be conducted by Latvian Economics' 
Ministry's Juris Cebulis and EFTA's Veijo Sampovaara. The EFTA 
delegation also includes its Secretary General Georg Reisch. 
  EFTA member states are Austria, Iceland, Liechtenstein, 
Norway, Finland, Switzerland and Sweden. Four of them, Finland, 
Norway, Sweden and Switzerland, have free trade agreements with 
Latvia. A similar agreement could be signed between Latvia and 
Iceland soon.

  [Text] Riga, Apr 12, BNS -- A tapping facility was found 
Monday [11 April] in the premises of the DIENAS BIZNESS (Daily 
Business) newspaper in the Press House, Chief Editor Juris 
Paiders said. 
  Paiders had suspicion already earlier that conversations in 
his office were being overheard: facts discussed in a narrow 
circle became known to others before publication or without 
publication. 
  Independent experts, invited by Paiders to search the rooms, 
found phone-tapping equipment in a telephone switchbox. 
  The experts also showed how conversations in the room can be 
heard out in the street. 
  One of the group told Paiders that the equipment was 
installed unprofessionally. But he did not rule out that more 
facilities were hidden in the editorial office. 
  Paiders submitted an application to security service chief 
Juris Vectirans and asked to clear out the incident. 
  Paiders claims that the problem is of great importance to 
the 
Latvian security because conversations of journalists often 
contain information that can be used to blackmail or indict 
someone mentioned.

  [Text] If the State Duma does not support the draft 
statement on the latest events in former Yugoslavia, this 
document will be published on behalf of the factions of the 
Liberal-Democratic, Communist, Agrarian and Democratic parties, 
and possibly of the Party of Russian Unity and Concord and the 
New Regional Policy group, Chairman of the State Duma's 
Committee for Geopolitics Viktor Ustinov (the LDPR) told 
Interfax. 
  He said that on commission from the State Duma Council, his 
committee had drafted a statement which says that "the signs of 
settlement in the Balkans have been brought to naught" and that 
the conflict was assuming a dangerous character, while the U.S. 
began to play the role of world gendarme. It also says that the 
U.S. is disregarding Russia and its interests. 
  The draft statement demands that the UN Security Council's 
resolution on the use of NATO forces in the Balkans be suspended 
and that the Security Council urgently discuss the situation in 
former Yugoslavia. "We must give a worthy response to the U.S. 
which does not take Russia's opinion into account," said Ustinov. 
  He said that the four parliamentary committees--for 
geopolitics, security, CIS affairs and industry--"are 
categorically against Russia's participation in NATO's 
Partnership for Peace program." If Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev signs the framework agreement on the program on April 
21, "the confidence in the Russian leadership and government 
will drop by several percentage points," said Ustinov.

<F P=106> [Ivan Pavlov report in the "Parliament" column: "The Duma </F>
Voted by Secret Ballot. The Idea of Imperative Mandate Has 
Again Been Rejected"] 
  [Text] The State Duma yesterday yet again met a request 
from the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR] leader and 
decided to vote on an amendment moved by the party's Duma 
faction to the law on the status of deputies to the Federal 
Assembly on the so-called imperative mandate. Under this 
amendment, the powers of a deputy elected on a party slate, 
except for some of the provisions enumerated in the law, are 
also terminated when a particular deputy leaves his faction 
without its consent or when he is expelled. Furthermore, his 
powers are terminated in the event that he is struck off the 
party slate on the decision of the supreme party body. 
  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy made a speech again, drawing attention 
to the obscure status of those deputies who, if they have left 
their faction, find themselves in a strange position: They will 
have neither a territorial nor a federal constituency. Mr. 
Zhirinovskiy stated that the Duma has no need for "dead souls," 
describing the actions of such deputies as "treachery, pure and 
simple:" He has received a mandate from his party and then 
walked out on it. Vladimir Borzyuk, a former member of the LDPR 
faction, objected to his former boss to the effect that he is 
the last man who should talk about honor and dignity because he 
himself has violated party rules, having forced a recent party 
congress to recognize him as a single and omnipotent leader. 
  On a Russia's Choice proposal, voting on the imperative 
mandate amendment was by secret ballot. Only 150 deputies voted 
in favor, with 173 against and 11 abstentions. It could be 
supposed that along with the LDPR, the idea of imperative 
mandate was supported by part of the communists and agrarians 
who are not particularly worried by the problem of "internal 
serfdom" -- so far they do not have even potential fugitives -- 
and also, possibly, by part of Russia's Choice. It was not 
accidental that the day before yesterday this faction's session 
was attended by an LDPR envoy, calling for the imperative 
mandate provision to be approved. It is not ruled out that this 
appeal fell on fertile soil because Russia's Choice regional 
chapters were somewhat angry at Gennadiy Burbulis, who left 
their faction the same day.

<F P=106> [Yan Ulanskiy report: "The Inviolables"] </F>
  [Text] To all appearances, the brawl started by 
Zhirinovskiy on 8 April in the State Duma hall will cause a lot 
of trouble for the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR) 
leader. First, the "Russia's Choice" faction has demanded that 
Zhirinovskiy's outrageous escapades be stopped. The matter has 
been passed to the State Duma ethics subcommission. But this is 
nothing compared with what is to come. Complaints by deputies 
and a journalist, who were assaulted by Zhirinovskiy, and also 
by witnesses to the scuffle may have more serious consequences. 
State Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin has promised to pass these 
documents to the general prosecutor. This entails the quite 
realistic possibility that a criminal lawsuit may be filed on 
charges of hooliganism. 
  In Vladimir Lukin's opinion, "any citizen should be brought 
to account for hooliganism." If the lawsuit is filed, Lukin 
will vote to strip V.V. Zh. [Zhirinovskiy] of his deputy 
immunity. Vitaliy Sevastyanov declined to comment on the 
incident, however, citing a lack of information. Many 
communists do not see any wrongdoing here at all, dismissing the 
affair as yet another clash between "Russia's Choice" and the 
LDPR. This appears all the stranger because none of "Russia's 
Choice" members was involved in the scuffle. Even though they 
apparently could have been. For instance, Aleksandr Osovtsov 
wished he were in the hall at the time. "I would have knocked 
his head off, with pleasure. You cannot get at him otherwise." 
Valeriy Borshchev, who participated in the fight, revealed a 
curious detail. When he saw that Zhirinovskiy was beating up 
Vladimir Borzyuk, he first of all turned to security personnel 
who maintain order at the State Duma. But they said that for 
them the deputies had inviolability whatever they might be doing.

<F P=106> [Roundup by Pavel Anokhin of remarks by State Duma members: </F>
"Only a Madman Would Come Out Against Accord Today"] 
  [Text] The draft memorandum "On Achieving Civil Accord in 
Russia" which has been made public remains at the center of 
attention in the country's political life. The deputies have 
begun to study it in their parliamentary factions. We here 
present to readers the opinion of certain legislators from the 
State Duma. 
  Valentin Tatarchuk, executive secretary of the "Russia's 
Choice" bloc deputies' faction: "You certainly cannot harness a 
horse and a timid doe in the same yoke. The ideological 
differences based on political forces' differing interpretations 
of the processes taking place in Russia are not likely to be 
reconciled quickly. This is a long and complex process. But 
there is one thing that should be accepted by everyone and 
should be incorporated in the document -- namely, a written 
agreement by political and social forces to pursue their 
activities and resolve their differences within the framework of 
the Constitution. We have no alternative today: Either we 
agree to resolve all our problems constitutionally and thereby 
preserve civil peace, or, if no such document is adopted, we as 
a people embark on a path of self-destruction, and things will 
be worse here than in Yugoslavia." 
  Pavel Burdukov, member of the Agrarian Party of Russia 
deputies' faction: "Only a madman would come out against accord 
in Russia today. The question is, how can accord be achieved 
between someone living in semi-starvation and someone gorging on 
caviar, between a person walking along the street barefoot and 
the Mercedes owner who spatters him with street dirt? 
  "The proposed draft prompts many urgent questions. If the 
agreement is to take the form of a social contract, then 
everyone should bear the burden equally -- government 
structures, public movements, trade unions. A degree of 
one-sidedness can be sensed in the present document. For 
instance, the sides pledge not to use power structures to 
resolve conflicts. But which sides? Does the Agrarian Party 
have any power structures? It should be expressed like this: 
The president and the government pledge not to use the Army, 
the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs], or state security in 
resolving political disputes. Or take a second point, where it 
is stated that the trade unions are not to put forward economic 
or political demands. In that case the other side, having, for 
instance, stipulated the present standard of living, should 
pledge at least to maintain that standard. In that case the 
trade unions' pledge will be appropriate and justified. Certain 
points which are clearly impossible to fulfill also cause 
concern. Among them are the promise to lower the level of 
inflation by the end of the year and eliminate the decline in 
production. 
  "In my view, the form of the agreement should be sought more 
in the economic sphere, alleviating the life of particularly 
vulnerable population strata." 
  Aleksey Mitrofanov, one of the leaders of the Liberal 
Democratic Party of Russia and its deputies' faction: "The 
document is very serious, and our group is studying it 
carefully. We do not regard this draft as final, and we realize 
that adopting an `Agreement' will not solve the problems. 
Nonetheless the Russian president's initiative creates a 
favorable moral and political atmosphere in the country. The 
draft enshrines a degree of accord between political forces on 
their standards of behavior, or rather, creates a code of 
conduct, and that is important. 
  "A number of positions incorporated in the proposed draft 
correspond in some respects to ours. For instance, it contains 
a provision on the need to strip any deputy violating the 
document, once signed, of his powers as a deputy. We advocate 
the imperative mandate, that is, the right of a faction to 
exclude renegades from the deputies' list. You will agree that 
otherwise the question arises: How can violators of the 
agreement be expelled from the 'body of deputies,' who can 
actually do this, and how?" 
  Nikolay Travkin, leader of the Democratic Party of Russia 
and 
its parliamentary faction: "Accord in society today depends more 
on the government's actions. You can sign any document you 
like, but it is not worth anything unless nonpayments are also 
stopped and wages are no longer delayed. 
  "The proposed draft is an attempt yet again to resolve 
problems by way of a `roundtable' -- let's sit down and talk 
about it, issue a decree, and all will be well. The document 
itself prompts no objections, but it hardly changes anything in 
practical terms. There is no need to adopt any agreements to do 
that, it is simply necessary for the government to get down to 
some real work. But unfortunately the text of the agreement 
does not guarantee that the executive will start to move more 
energetically." 
  Natalya Malakhatkina, deputy chairman of the "Women of 
Russia" political movement's deputies' faction: "Our faction was 
an initiator of a memorandum like this, so we have studied its 
content with particular attention. It has a very high status, 
and there is a danger that it could come above the country's 
Fundamental Law. It duplicates many of the provisions of the 
Russian Constitution, and a number of its provisions are 
actually in conflict with the Constitution. We undoubtedly have 
here a product that is still raw, proposed by five 
`roundtables.' But that is why we must do some serious work on 
it. 
  "For instance, I am concerned about the draft's precise 
definition of the order in which laws should be adopted. But 
what is the point of prescribing which law is to be adopted 
first and which second? You cannot do that -- unforeseen 
situations may arise, and instead of accord, conflicts that 
nobody wants will arise."

  [Text] RIA reports: The State Duma has agreed with a 
Federation Council proposal to create a conciliation commission 
to overcome any disagreements which may arise. Disagreements 
arose after the Federation Council rejected a law, approved by 
the Duma, on the procedure for publishing federal constitutional 
laws, federal laws, and acts of the chambers of the Russian 
Federal Assembly and for their coming into force. From the 
State Duma, Vladimir Bessarabov, Sergey Zenkin, and Anatoliy 
Lukyanov, members of the Committee on Legislation and Judicial 
and Legal Reform, will be on the conciliation commission.

  [Text] Moscow April 13 TASS -- 100 angry Ingushis blocked a 
military township with Russian peace-keepers in Nazran on 
Wednesday in protest against the seizure by North Ossetians of 
an Ingushi hostage, TASS learned from the temporary 
administration in the zone of conflict. 
  On Tuesday North Ossetians stopped a convoy of Ingushi 
refugees returning to the North Ossetian village of Kartsa. 
They seized six Ingushis who they planned to exchange for three 
Ossetians captured on March 30. Russian peace-keepers are to 
safeguard the return of hostages. 
  Head of the Temporary Administration in the State of 
Emergency Zone Vladimir Lozovoy succeeded to talk the Ossetians 
into freeing the Ingushis, however one hostage remained in 
captivity and his fate is unknown. According to the source, the 
tensions may tell on the second round of negotiations between 
the North Ossetian and Ingush presidents scheduled to take place 
in Nalchik.

  [Text] Moscow April 12 TASS -- The government of the 
people's trust and the Constitutional Court of the Republic of 
Chechnya has called on all social and political forces of 
Chechnya to begin a dialogue aimed at achieving national 
reconciliation. The text of the appeal was communicated to 
ITAR-TASS. 
  Appointments for interviewing prime minister of the Republic 
of Chechnya government of the people's trust can be fixed by 
telephone: 278-62-74. Please, ask for Sergey Moyseyev. 
  "The fate has once again given a chance to the Chechen 
people, perhaps, the last. Russia in the person of the State 
Duma has for the first time rejected a solution to the "Chechen 
problem" by using force, and has proposed peaceful means for 
settling mutual relations. Missing this chance will be a crime 
in the eyes of the people and history. Our progeny would not 
forgive us for this. But it is quite reasonable not to take 
advantage of the prospects opening before us under the 
conditions of a confrontation between political forces and 
movements of Chechnya," the appeal stated. 
  The appeal is signed by Prime Minister of the Government of 
the People's Trust Y. Mamodayev and Chairman of the 
Constitutional Court I. Gerikhanov. It contains proposals how 
to take first steps towards practical reconciliation. It asks 
the president of Chechnya, as a guarantor of rights and 
liberties to citizens, together with the parliament, 
constitutional court, lawful prime minister, and with the 
participation of the masses to take measures for achieving 
national reconciliation, and also prepare a programme for 
holding a political dialogue with Russia. 
  The appeal assumes that during the talks with Russia a 
moratorium will be imposed on all conflicts between parties, 
movements, different branches of power, state leaders, religious 
and social workers and individual citizens (in the form of blood 
feuds, disputes over land, etc.) for the sake of an equal and 
mutually acceptable treaty with Russia. It also asks for 
suspending decisions adopted by state power bodies of Chechnya, 
which can become a subject of talks between Russian and the 
Republic of Chechnya.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Semenov report: "Loans Not Yet Panacea. </F>
Necessary To Be Able To Adapt"] 
  [Text] Yaroslavl -- Yaroslavl Oblast has managed to find a 
way to support defense plants and help them in the conversion 
process. But this is not charity by the administration. The 
aid has been and continues to be available on market terms. 
  In 1993 the oblast made the first attempt in Russia to 
finance conversion mainly through soft loans. In accordance 
with the ratified program, more than 1.2 billion rubles [R] were 
to have been allocated from the oblast budget last year. But 
only 60 percent of these funds were allocated owing to limited 
financial resources, and the last R189 million was paid out to 
enterprises at the very end of the year. Consequently, 
investment has been delayed. The other problem reflected in the 
results was inflation and price growth. 
  Nonetheless, the work on the conversion program has enabled 
a 
number of defense enterprises to survive at a time of a general 
production slump, to retain qualified staff, and to organize 
production of new types of output -- namely, 47 buses, 3,500 
microwave ovens, 3,150 liquid-fuel stoves, 100 milk coolers, and 
so forth. In all, output worth R2 billion has been produced 
under the program, and goods worth R500 million have already 
been sold -- which shows that there is a good level of demand. 
  Of course, there have been some unforeseen situations. For 
instance, the "Kholodmash" enterprise has stopped producing 
microwave ovens, since the oblast requirement for these products 
is met by the Rybinsk Instrument-Making Plant. "Kholodmash" 
then quickly switched to domestic refrigerators instead. The 
"Start" Design Bureau gave up the manufacture of portable 
digital nitrate measuring devices, since demand for them had in 
practice fallen. Although you would have expected the reverse. 
After all, the entire world monitors food quality. But, 
clearly, we have not reached that point yet. And returns on 
investment have not always justified the expenditure. Thus, 
despite using a R238-million loan from the oblast budget and 
R235 million from its own resources, the "Mashpribor" Plant 
produced output worth just R197.4 million. 
  The oblast conversion program has been under way for 6 
months, and a number of items are at the experimental mockup 
stage, undergoing testing, or being made ready for series 
production. These include electric choppers and electric meat 
grinders produced by the "Mashpribor" Plant, portable color 
camcorders [televideoustroystva] from the Rybinsk 
Instrument-Making Plant, domestic air conditioners and 
refrigerator compressors, a series of medical instruments, and 
so forth. 
  This year, the administration's collaboration with 
enterprises from the defense industry complex is undergoing 
certain modifications. Whereas previously enterprises' programs 
were taken at face value, the reluctance to "throw money down 
the drain" has now forced the administration to somewhat tighten 
up the requirements it places on the plans that are submitted. 
  Specialists have elaborated a standard type of investment 
project which answers the three main questions of: "What is 
being produced, how will it be produced, and who is it for?" 
Unless a product has a known sales market, projects will not 
even be accepted for consideration. 
  At the start of the year the administration drew up 
proposals 
on the industrial side of the budget for the oblast's 
development in 1994. The budget includes 37 investment projects 
and programs -- 29 of which relate to conversion. Many of them 
have received expert scrutiny from a working group at the 
Institute of the Economic Problems of the Transitional Period. 
  The very names of these projects show the great 
opportunities 
that exist for expanding defense enterprises' economic activity 
and for them to successfully find their place in the Russian 
consumer market and boost their export potential. The Rybinsk 
Instrument-Making Plant has submitted a project for the 
production of electronic engine management systems, along with a 
plan to organize production of wind-power installations. The 
"Kholodmash" Plant will continue to produce compressor motors 
for refrigerators and transportation air conditioners. 
"Mashpribor" has elaborated a whole program for the manufacture 
of production and technical output. "Yaroslavlrezinotekhnika" 
has also joined the conversion program, with a plan to produce 
carbon strips and building structures made out of cellular 
concrete. 
  The oblast administration has started to set up an 
investment 
projects bank. After all, if they survive, it will be necessary 
to move forward.

<F P=106> [Fedor Yemchenko report: "Diamonds Beyond Number. But Even </F>
More Problems. Situation in Far Northern Regions Is Becoming 
Critical"] 
  [Text] TRUD has already published a report on the hunger 
strike by women from the "Tokhomo" Geological Exploration 
Enterprise in the Evenki Autonomous Okrug. The reason for the 
hunger strike is that the workers have not been paid since last 
summer. The money due for the work they have completed was 
finally "wrung out" of the enterprise by means of tears and a 
strike. But the enterprise's future remains in question. The 
state used to invest considerable sums in organizing the Evenki 
oil exploration expedition. Highly skilled specialists have 
been assembled here. If "Tokhomo" goes bankrupt, the result will 
be further losses for the state. 
  No sooner was the hunger strike by the women of Baykit 
brought to an end than the "protest relay" was taken up by six 
representatives of the "Norilskstroy" Association's trade union 
committee. 
  We learned recently that a three-day hunger strike was 
declared from 1 April in Igarka by six workers at the geological 
exploration expedition. The reason was the same: Work was no 
longer being financed and people were not getting paid. 
  The problems being experienced by the working people of the 
North have not cropped up overnight or even in the recent past. 
Four years ago the Federation of Independent Trade Unions of 
Russia held a conference in Murmansk at which the region's 
social and economic problems were discussed. Incidentally, the 
region provides the state with 75 percent of its oil, 92 percent 
of its gas, 100 percent of its gold and diamonds, and 70 percent 
of its timber. According to calculations by specialists, every 
worker in the northern expanses provides the country with 
revenue which is three times that generated by the average 
Russian worker. But it is becoming increasingly difficult to 
live here. At the Murmansk conference the trade unions stated: 
"The North is sick, disaster is approaching. Contradictions 
between production and social amenities have driven people to 
despair. The pathetic incentives on offer have lost their 
attractiveness given the chronic lack of food and basic 
necessities." 
  Last year, under pressure from the trade unions, the 
Congress 
of People's Deputies adopted the Law "On State Guarantees and 
Compensation Payments for Northerners," and presidential edicts 
and government decrees aimed to stabilize the social and 
economic situation in the Far Northern regions. 
  Nevertheless the situation in the region during recent years 
has not only failed to improve but has actually reached the 
critical level. Another trade union conference on the problems 
of the North -- the fourth -- was held in Moscow at the end of 
March. In addition to delegates from 18 territorial trade union 
associations, deputies from the State Duma and Federation 
Council, members of the government, and representatives of 
ministries and departments took part in its work. 
  Following Russian tradition, the leitmotiv at this 
conference 
was encapsulated by two questions: Who is to blame? And what 
can be done? Whereas practically every speech contained the 
answer to the first question -- the government -- few had 
anything definite to say about the second. The absurdity of the 
situation is that the present government cannot act within the 
framework of the laws adopted in the state even if it wants to. 
Dmitriy Lukashenko, chairman of the Komi Republic Trade Union 
Federation, gave the following example. Deputy Finance Minister 
Vyacheslav Korolev stated bluntly at parliamentary hearings that 
we have not implemented the Law on the North and we do not 
intend to do so. "What do you mean?" the astonished 
parliamentarians demanded. It seemed like nonsense to hear this 
sort of thing directly from a ranking state official. And then, 
without any embarrassment whatsoever, V. Korolev hit back with 
the assertion that there is simply no money to implement the law! 
  Indeed, to fully implement this law would, according to 
various assessments, require an appropriation of 35-80 trillion 
rubles from the state budget. It is abundantly clear that the 
government cannot manage this and is obliged to maneuver between 
two extremes: Either it must pay the northerners the amount 
laid down by the law and thereby stoke up hyperinflation, or it 
must secure major amendments to the law from the State Duma. 
Which, incidentally, is already being done. A report leaked to 
the press, stating that the government has prepared a draft 
decree on abolishing some of the benefits payable to 
northerners, has provoked a negative reaction. A strike 
committee has been formed in the Komi Republic. 
  "If the benefits stipulated by the law are cut," Dmitriy 
Lukashenko stated at the conference, "products from our republic 
will stop arriving in the Russian center. We will block 
railroads and highways. Oil and gas wells will only `operate' 
insofar as is necessary to satisfy the region's internal needs. 
We will only send what is left over to consumers in other 
regions in order to avoid shutting down the wells altogether. 
We will stop transferring taxes to the federal budget...." 
  This menacing ultimatum is unlikely to be adopted. In my 
view, the trade union leader's resoluteness contained more in 
the way of emotional charge than considered appraisal. It is 
not hard to conjecture what the consequences of such a step 
would be: They would hit working people first and foremost. At 
the same time we should bear in mind that the pursuit of a 
policy based on the postulate that "the Russian peasant will 
endure anything" is becoming extremely dangerous. It seems the 
power structures are well aware of this. The representative 
branch, at any rate. The State Duma and Federation Council are 
planning to review the blueprint determining state policy in the 
northern regions. Whatever transpires, it remains a fact that 
the North always was and continues to be Russia's principal 
"storehouse" of raw materials. Without the preservation and 
development of the economy of these regions, which, 
incidentally, comprise approximately 65 percent of our state's 
total area, it becomes impossible to envision the rebirth of 
Russia, a topic which political leaders love to talk about. 
  Polls that have been carried out show that over 50 percent 
of 
the workers currently employed in the Northern regions would be 
prepared to leave the area at the present time. The only thing 
holding them back is the lack of money to pay their travel costs 
and the dim prospect of finding somewhere to live in another 
area. Attempts by individual "desperate souls" to overcome these 
obstacles often come to a sorry end. 
  Gennadiy Loginov, director of the Kola Scientific Center 
attached to the Russian Academy of Sciences, gave this example. 
Some 200 families left Zelenogorsk, he said. They sold 
everything they had, their apartments and furniture. They 
scraped together the money to make the journey. They simply 
trundled around the central oblasts and came back again. It was 
practically impossible for them to find work to match their 
skills, and they had no place to live. Apartment rental prices 
are crazy. You can imagine the situation they are in now.... 
  It is not hard to imagine. It is far harder to answer the 
question: How can these people be helped? After all, most of 
them did not come here as a result of any romantic delusions. 
Some were sent here after training, others sincerely responded 
to party and government appeals. The main point is that through 
their labor they have helped us to live more or less tolerably 
by pulling the whole country along, so to speak. And now they 
have become captives of this "white and silent expanse," it 
would simply be inhuman to abandon them to the mercy of fate. 
  However, let us analyze factors that are more tangible -- 
economic reasons. We know that a significant proportion of 
state budget revenue comes from the gold extraction industry. 
It would seem that the government should pay most attention to 
this sector. But alas no! Judging by the situation that has 
developed in Magadan Oblast, nobody cares too much about federal 
budget revenue. 
  Many gold extraction enterprises in this region, according 
to 
Valentin Tsvetkov, deputy chairman of the Federation Council 
Budget and Finance Committee, are currently being forced to cut 
production. The extraction artels are only working sites where 
precious metal can be obtained without significant expenditure. 
In other words, they are "siphoning off the cream." In this 
respect the state is incurring enormous losses. 
  Enterprises which are fulfilling state orders for gold and 
diamond extraction are not being paid on time for their output. 
They have been obliged to take out loans with commercial banks 
and pay interest rates at the expense of their profits. This is 
how the "collapse" of the foreign currency sector is proceeding. 
You will agree that it is very hard to understand the logic of 
these actions by the government. 
  The economic problems of the northern territories, like 
those 
of the whole of our country, cannot be explained or justified 
merely by the hardships that have resulted from the changeover 
in the sociopolitical structures of society, the switch, so to 
speak, from developed socialism to insufficiently developed 
capitalism. Many of these problems have been generated by the 
mistakes that were made as reforms progressed. But mistakes, as 
we well know, are committed by specialists whose skills do not 
match up to the tasks they have undertaken to tackle. In my 
view, this encapsulates one of the reasons for the tragedy which 
our society is enduring. 
  The future of these people who find themselves in extreme 
economic and climatic conditions cannot leave us indifferent. 
The appeals to the president and the prime minister adopted at 
the conference that has just been held basically contain a 
single call: Ensure strict compliance with the law regarding 
social guarantees for northerners. Only time will tell whether 
this call will be heeded in the Kremlin and the White House....

<F P=106> [From the "Pacific Ocean" program] </F>
  [Text] The Sakhalin Oblast Agricultural Union recently held 
a meeting to discuss the situation that has developed in the 
island's agricultural sector concerning the coming spring. Here 
is our Sakhalin correspondent Lyudmila Filipova with the details: 
  [Begin recording] The meeting noted that there was only a 
month and a half left before the beginning of the planting 
season, and that all agricultural enterprises are in fact 
bankrupt at present. That is, they cannot assure supplies of 
fuel, lubricants, seed, or fertilizer to begin sowing work, and 
only about 25 percent of the equipment is ready for spring field 
work. There has never been such a state of affairs in the 
history of the oblast. The level of work discipline is very 
low, although this is not surprising because wages have not been 
paid at some agricultural enterprises since October. The 
leading specialists have moved to other industries where wages 
are quite a bit higher and where wages are still being paid. 
  In short, the agricultural industry is collapsing. It was 
emphasized that the welfare of the agricultural industry workers 
is deteriorating. Even attempts to improve working conditions 
and to observe the fundamental rules of equipment safety have 
been discontinued. The basic means of production are worn out 
and there is no possibility of renovating them. All this comes 
at a time when the agricultural department and the oblast 
authorities are not taking any effective measures to normalize 
the situation. Every agricultural enterprise, it was 
emphasized, is struggling with its own troubles on its own. The 
loans that the government allocates for the support of the 
primary producers do not reach them. 
  It is apparently not profitable to produce anything under 
these conditions, especially livestock products. All 
agricultural enterprises, without exception, incurred losses 
last year in livestock production due to low prices for products 
and tardy payments. The producers were not paid for the 
products supplied. The cost of electricity and heating alone has 
completely impoverished enterprises in the last two and a half 
months. We cannot speak of production when agricultural 
enterprises' sales basically amount to approximately 100 million 
rubles a month, but they pay more for electricity. 
  The demands tabled at this meeting -- and which are to be 
presented to the oblast administration and the government -- 
call for the introduction of compensation payments for loans 
taken out from 1 January 1994 and a number of other types of 
compensation and subsidies. It was also demanded that the 
oblast administration take charge of all agricultural enterprise 
infrastructures, or pay compensation for expenditures for the 
upkeep of housing; set up a regional order for agricultural 
products for the current year; and provide a 50-percent 
prepayment of their cost in accordance with concluded 
agreements. It was also stipulated that extreme measures should 
be taken, such as demanding the resignation of the government, 
stern criticism of the president, and perhaps even strike 
action, if these demands are not met. One more proposal 
suggests that it might be more effective if the entire Far East 
region made the demands of the government in a concerted way.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "What About Consideration, </F>
Gentlemen!"] 
  [Text] The Far Eastern Shipping Company [FESCO] has 
stopped sending freight to Kamchatka. As of the beginning of 
April the main sea route linking Kamchatka to the mainland is 
totally closed. 
  The cable that the peninsula received from the FESCO says 
that as of 1 April the sea port of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy 
owes Maritime Kray port workers over 1.5 billion rubles [R], as 
a result of which the FESCO is forced to take "extreme, but 
legal measures," namely the total banning of freight deliveries 
to Kamchatka. 
  An cable in reply from Kamchatka Oblast Governor Vladimir 
Biryukov to Vladivostok describes this measure as "not entirely 
considerate toward the population of Kamchatka" since reciprocal 
nonpayments are "not enterprises' fault, but their problem." 
The port of Petropavlovsk is itself owed R5 billion by clients.

RTZ Set Up a Joint Venture To Develop the Svetlinsk Gold 
Deposits"] 
  [Text] The Chelyabinsk-based production association 
Yuzhuralzoloto and the British gold-producing company RTZ have 
signed a contract in London on creating a joint venture to 
develop the Svetlinsk gold deposits, Nikolay Popov, chief of the 
material resources department at the oblast administration's 
economics committee, announced on 7 April. The deposits' 
estimated reserves are 70 tonnes of gold. The decision on their 
joint development under RTZ technology was made back at the end 
of 1991 during a visit to London by the head of the Chelyabinsk 
Oblast administration as part of a Russian Government 
delegation. According to Mr. Popov, the joint venture's planned 
charter fund will be 100 million rubles. RTZ's share will be not 
less than 50 percent. Under the contract, the development of 
the deposits will begin after RTZ has conducted a geological 
survey and prepared a feasibility report. Deductions from the 
state budget for the use of mineral resources will be 4 percent 
of the value of the gold produced. Of this sum, 75 percent will 
stay in Chelyabinsk Oblast.

<F P=106> [From the "Oblast News" ] </F>
  [Text] Representatives from Russia, Japan, Poland, U.S., 
South Korea, and the PRC recently signed an agreement in the 
U.S. capital of Washington to regulate Alaska pollock fishing in 
the central part of the Bering Sea. Our correspondent Yuriy 
Kuzmenko asked Stanislav Mikhaylovich Korochkin, chief of 
Magadan Basin Okhotrybvod [Okhotsk Sea Fishing Administration] 
Department to comment on the event. 
  [Begin recording] [Kuzmenko] Stanislav Mikhaylovich, does 
the Washington agreement specifically provide solutions to 
problems affecting the central part of the Okhotsk Sea? 
  [Korochkin] After a great deal of preparatory work, three 
years of preparatory work and 10 meetings, six countries finally 
signed an agreement in Washington agreeing to regulate fishing 
in the central part of the Bering Sea. Subsequently, if 
governments of four countries ratify this agreement, it will 
acquire the power of a convention with all its ensuing 
consequences. A fishing moratorium has been placed on the 
central part of the Bering Sea until the end of 1994, after 
which, a committee will be formed to determine the Alaska 
pollock catch quotas based on research into stocks. The fishing 
quotas will be distributed at a conference of the member 
countries. Moreover, I want to emphasize that Russia and the 
United States will have 80 percent of the possible catch, 20 
percent will be shared by the remaining countries. It can be 
said without exaggeration that this is a unique agreement. This 
is the first time that such an agreement has been signed 
concerning the northern Pacific Ocean and this, of course, gives 
certain hope that a similar solution can be found to the central 
Okhotsk Sea issue. 
  [Kuzmenko] So this means that there is hope that foreign 
fishermen will cease their shameful conduct in the Okhotsk Sea? 
  [Korochkin] Yes, there is certainly hope. However, the work 
on the Bering Sea agreement took three years because powerful 
pressure was exerted by the United States, since the Alaska 
pollock there belongs to the Aleutian state primarily because it 
is in the U.S. zone. However, the Alaska pollock in the Okhotsk 
Sea is (?mostly) ours and that is why everything depends on the 
actions of our government and on how it can prepare and 
influence the position of other countries. 
  [Kuzmenko] Stanislav Mikhaylovich, what is the situation 
today in the central part of the Okhotsk Sea? 
  [Korochkin] Today, the usual situation prevails in the 
central part of the Okhotsk Sea. Our fleet is not working there 
since the introduction of the moratorium last year. However, 
Polish and Chinese vessels continue to work there, some 40-50 
ships. However, South Korea has withdrawn its fleet from the 
central part of the Okhotsk Sea. In exchange for the South 
Korean Government's agreement to withdraw the fleet, our 
government has allotted the South Korean fleet 32,500 tonnes of 
Alaska pollock in our economic zone in western Kamchatka, the 
northern Okhotsk Sea fishing area, and [words indistinct] 
Kamchatka region. 
  [Kuzmenko] And at the present time, Okhotrybvod vessels with 
inspectors on board are constantly patrolling the central part 
of the Okhotsk Sea. 
  [Korochkin] Yes, quite right. After the introduction of the 
moratorium, the Fishing Committee issued an order making 
Okhotrybvod responsible for the main coordinating work to 
protect the central part. Beginning in the summer of last year, 
one of our command patrol boats has constantly patrolled the 
area with inspectors on board and, money permitting, we 
regularly carry out aerial surveillance of the area. That is, 
we have the situation fully under control. 
  [Kuzmenko] Thank you. [end recording]

  [Text] The Estonian Defense Ministry is working on new 
entry regulations for Russian army officers. This was announced 
at a Tuesday news conference by Prime-Minister Mart Laar. 
  He said the old regulations were good when the withdrawal of 
troops was proceeding according to plan. However, the pullout 
has almost stopped. Now an applicant will have to clearly state 
which unit he is going to, for how long and when the unit is 
going to be withdrawn. 
  Estonia says there are about 2,500 Russian soldiers and 
officers in Estonia. At a regular round of talks at the end of 
last year the Russian side suggested completing the withdrawal 
by August 31, 1994. It demanded automatic residence permits and 
other social guarantees to retired Russian army officers. As 
the Estonian side refused to offer them, Russia said it might 
change the suggested deadline of the withdrawal.

  [Text] Tallinn, Apr 12, BNS -- The second session of a 
joint commission of the European Free Trade Association [EFTA] 
and Estonia on April 11 in Tallinn was informative, Foreign 
Ministry Deputy Chancellor Priit Kolbre told BNS. The 
participants surveyed their countries' economic situation and 
cast a glance on the future. 
  The session underlined the importance of the free-trade 
agreements Estonia has concluded with EFTA member states. The 
Baltic republic's major trade partners among EFTA members are 
Finland and Sweden, but contacts are maintained also with Norway 
and Switzerland, Kolbre said. 
  The session was attended by representatives from six EFTA 
member states as well as the EFTA secretariat. The trade 
organization was officially represented by Ambassador Veijo 
Sampovaara from the Finnish Foreign Ministry. EFTA Secretary 
General Georg Reisch also attended the meeting. 
  The relations between EFTA and Estonia rest on a cooperation 
declaration signed in 1991 in Geneva, which affirms mutual 
readiness to create conditions for commercial and economic 
cooperation with the eventual aim of establishing a free trade 
regime. 
  The EFTA-Estonian joint commission first met in 1993 in 
Stockholm.

  [Text] Tallinn, April 12 -- The flux of Kurdish refugees 
through Estonia, most probably with an intention to reach 
Sweden, continues. The Boarderguard Board told ETA, on Tuesday 
[12 April], that on Sunday an Estonian was detained in Narva who 
tried to illegally import from Russia a six-member group of 
Kurdish refugees. The Kurds escaped back to Russia, where they 
were detained by a Russian borderguard patrol. 
  Acting head of the Estonian Detainment Institutions Board 
Valeri Kravets told ETA, on Tuesday, that there were 137 Kurdish 
refugees in Estonia at present on whom documents were being 
prepared in order a decision could be made as to their 
internment. During the two-month internment period, the 
Migration Board has to decide whether to deport the Kurds or to 
grant them a status of refugees, residence and working permits. 
  Kravets said that at Harku Prison there were 22 Kurds whose 
future has not been decided. At Maardu, 8 Kurds are detained, 
who have been in Estonia for more than three months and have 
been granted another two months of internment time. Kravets 
said it was not understandable why the solution of the problems 
was dragged because the accommodation and feeding of the Kurds 
costs a lot to Estonia. 
  Estonian Prime Minister Mart Laar told a press conference on 
Tuesday that government still had no money to build a permanent 
internment camp. He added that it was however much more 
important to set a better mechanism in order the Kurds will not 
come to Estonia illegally, the possible solution being better 
work of the borderguard. Those Kurdish refugees that have come 
here illegally have to be sent back to where they came from, he 
said.

  [Text] Tallinn, Apr 07, BNS -- The tourism sector was in 
1993 the second-biggest foreign exchange earner in Estonia, Bank 
of Estonia spokesman Jaanus Kroon said today at a briefing at 
the Estonian Tourist Board. 
  Tourism was preceded by transport and followed by 
construction, Kroon added. 
  Estonia last year exported tourism services worth nearly 659 
million kroons. Import of tourism services over the same period 
amounted to almost 336 million kroons. 
  Travel agents and tour operators accounted for 59 percent of 
the exports and 25 percent of the imports. Apparently most 
Estonians travel abroad without availing themselves of the 
services of tourism companies, Kroon said. 
  Finns accounted for 80 percent of the tourists visiting 
Estonia; 40 percent of them were so-called "shopping tourists." 
  Obviously, tourism is one of the country's principal sources 
of revenue and the state should give serious attention to 
promoting the sector. The Bank of Estonia fully subscribes to 
this opinion of the Estonian Association of Travel Agents, Kroon 
stated.

  [Text] Tallinn, Apr 12, BNS -- There are seven or eight 
strong mafia groups in Estonia, Sergei Kozlov, deputy chief of 
the Tallinn police force, claimed at a press conference today. 
Most of their members are non-Estonians, he said. 
  Kozlov said the so-called Riga, Perm, Novosibirsk, 
Krasnodar, 
Azerbaijan and Chechen groups are all great powers in Estonia. 
The only Estonian group of note in the underworld is the 
Saha-Loo or the so-called "poultry complex" gang, he said. 
  The police chief claimed the groups concentrate round people 
most of whom live since long in Estonia and carry permanent 
residence permits. 
  Igor Kalinin, one of the leaders of the Riga group that had 
of late gathered strength in Estonia was recently killed in 
Tallinn. 
  Kozlov told reporters Kalinin's slaying was an unpleasant 
surprise to Tallinn's criminal police, since the police had been 
able through him to keep the activity of the group in check to a 
degree. 
  "Now a new man will take over and we haven't the slightest 
idea who he is or which way organized crime will turn," Kozlov 
stated.

  [Text] Kiev, 12 Apr -- Ukrainian parliamentary chairman 
Ivan Plyushch made a speech on Ukrainian TV. Replying to 
questions, he noted in particular: "On the whole, I am satisfied 
with the elections to the new parliament but I expected somewhat 
better results... I think (and I am not the only one: the 
overwhelming majority of Ukrainian citizens are striving to 
create a democratic, law-based society) that it would have been 
impossible not to have held the elections. A competent and 
full-blooded Supreme Council was elected which, I think, will do 
everything to continue and improve drafted legislation and 
continue the legislative process." 
  Touching on the issue of political forces which are now 
emerging on the political arena, Ivan Plyushch stressed: "This 
is an ambiguous issue. Today, in my view, some journalists and 
politicians are attempting to draw hasty conclusions such as 
whether the `left-wing' or the `right-wing' gained victory. If 
we had a structured society, a `left-wing' and `right-wing', 
then one could draw such conclusions. There are now accusations 
that almost 100 `left-wing' deputies won seats in the new 
parliament. I personally know many of these people and am 
familiar with their elections programs. I would not be able to 
find a single person among them who would state that he is 
taking up his seat in order to fight against the process that is 
currently taking place. They have different views as regards 
the tactics... We cannot unequivocally accept the assertion 
that the democratic forces suffered defeat. In the new 
parliament there is a strong center. It is a constructive force 
that will be the base which will attract both the `left-wing' 
and the `right-wing'... Obviously, there will still be a 
radical `right-wing' and `left-wing,' but this situation also 
exists in civilized and democratic countries. 
  The speaker expressed his views on the defeat at the 
elections of famous politicians. "I think this is a perfectly 
normal phenomenon for a young democracy and for our society 
because when they were in parliament many of the deputies often 
spoke in the name of our people but had contacts with an 
insignificant part of the population. They would express the 
`people's views' from such a small number of people but when 
they went to the masses it transpired that their views were not 
shared or there was a lack of trust that these deputies 
reflected these views and actions. 
  Second, I am not making a tragedy out of the fact that 
people 
expect changes. Objectively, people always relate this to hopes 
for a new democratic or political force and to its arrival in 
parliament..." 
  The chairman of the Supreme Council also touched on 
relations 
with Russia. He noted: "When I met representatives of the Duma 
after 27 March, I thought that the forces in Russia who 
understood that Ukraine is here to stay would begin to mature. 
The latest actions by the Ukrainian president and the Supreme 
Council give no grounds for an aggravation of relations between 
Ukraine and Russia and other countries. But recently, for some 
reason, just when the shoots of political stability appeared in 
Ukraine, when a positive tendency was observed in the economy, 
and when debts began to be paid back to Russia, political forces 
appeared in Russia which attempted to convince everybody that 
Russia could not live without Ukraine and Ukraine could not live 
without Russia. 
  Obviously, the `Crimean card' is being played more and more 
although in a conversation with members of the Duma, I said that 
I could not imagine resolving the Crimean issue in favor of 
Ukraine or Russia. There are representatives of three nations 
there. Who is going to say that the Crimean Tatars do not have 
the right to their own autonomy? Who is going to say that 
Crimea's Russian-speaking population is guilty of something? 
What is going to happen with the Ukrainians who make up a third 
of the population? Crimea should be Crimean. It should be an 
autonomy within the composition of Ukraine. The borders have 
already been recognized. Treaties have been signed within the 
framework of the CSCE and the United Nations and interstate 
treaties have been concluded. A tripartite statement was signed 
between the presidents of the United States, Ukraine, and Russia 
on the recognition of borders. 
  I estimate that the population of Crimea is very cautious 
about all these processes and people there are now troubled by 
where President Meshkov's policies could lead to..." 
  The speaker noted that provided deputies support the 
proposal, the first session of parliament will take place 
between 10-15 May.

  [Text] Kiev, 11 Apr -- Dmytro Korchynskyy: "We positively 
assess the results of the elections. Three UNA [Ukrainian 
National Assembly] members were elected to Ukraine's Supreme 
Council: Yurko Tyma, chairman of the UNA Ternopol Oblast 
committee, Oleh Vitovych, commander of the Lvov UNSO Oblast 
command, and Yaroslav Ilyasevych, chief of staff of the Lvov 
UNSO branch. We consider that we could form a faction of 20 or 
30 people in the parliament who will support the UNA platform. 
  We assess this as our victory despite the fact that enormous 
pressure was put on UNA-UNSO members and parliamentary 
candidates both by the power bodies and by representatives of 
the communist and democratic blocs with the aim of not allowing 
them to take part in the elections. The pre-election campaign 
was conducted in an atmosphere of fierce fighting, slanders 
against UNA-UNSO, arrests, searches of its members and 
confiscation of documents. There were incidents of physical 
violence against parliamentary candidates. For example, a 
parliamentary candidate in Ternopol Oblast was seriously wounded 
in the head and several UNA-UNSO election observers were 
arrested.

  [Text] Lvov -- UNA-UNSO [Ukrainian National 
Assembly-Ukrainian National Self-Defense] held a news conference 
on 12 April at its oblast branch headquarters on the results of 
the election to the Supreme Council of Ukraine. The oblast UNA 
chairman, Andriy Shkil, told journalists that UNA-UNSO fulfilled 
its minimum program in the election and now has three 
representatives in parliament. Two of them, Oleh Vitovych and 
Yaroslav Ilyasevych, were elected in Lvov oblast, the other, 
Yuriy Tyma, in Ternopol. "Our deputies will not join permanent 
alliances in the new parliament, but will cooperate and align 
with certain forces on certain decisions and appointments. We 
will cooperate with all forces, including Communists and 
Socialists, on crucial issues of nation-building," said Andriy 
Shkil. 
  A UNSO area commander, Ukraine People's Deputy Oleh 
Vitovych, 
said he believes that "one of the first issues to be raised in 
parliament is the division of powers. There will be 
disagreements regarding the need for a presidential election, 
the functions of the Supreme Council, its speaker, the 
president, and who will form the government. It is difficult to 
imagine what ideas or tactics can bring together people of 
different political views on these priority issues with respect 
to putting an end to the plundering of Ukraine, boosting 
production development, and, most important, preserving 
Ukraine's territorial integrity." 
  Predicting the course of the future political struggle, the 
news conference organizers agreed that the main threat to the 
young state is posed by the "red directors", with their sights 
firmly set on Moscow. Oleh Vitovych also warned against 
excessive excitement over the western standards. In his 
opinion, neither the Moscow, nor the Western model of societal 
development is acceptable to Ukraine. It should rely on its own 
resources and potential. 
  The news conference also noted that UNA-UNSO plans to be 
most 
active in the local elections. Andriy Shkil said that the UNA 
leadership will consult experts in the near future to determine 
its campaign strategy and tactics. 
  All of the journalists' questions were answered, except one: 
"Will UNA-UNSO deputies come to the parliament session in the 
camouflage military uniforms they normally wear, or will they 
perhaps wear something more civilian?" This question is yet to 
be discussed.

  [Text] Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov signed a number of 
decrees to appoint the key figures of his government. He 
appointed Major General Vladimir Lepikhov, the former chief of 
the staff of an army group stationed in the Crimea, as the 
chairman of the Crimean security service. The former head of 
the security service, Ivan Kolomytsev, was relieved of his 
duties. 
  Meshkov also replaced former Interior Ministry Alexander 
Plyuta with Major General Valery Kuznetsov, the former commander 
of an army group stationed on the peninsula. Until recently, 
Kuznetsov was the Crimean president's advisor on military issues. 
  In addition, Meshkov signed a decree to appoint an economist 
from Moscow, Andrey Chernyavskiy, as the acting economics 
minister. Lyudmila Zaitseva, another member of Yevgeny Saburov's 
team, was appointed as the acting finance minister. 
  The former deputy speaker of the Crimean parliament, 
Anatoliy 
Franchuk, was appointed the acting minister for management of 
state-owned enterprises. He is the only representative of the 
former Crimean government. 
  All the candidatures are subject to approval by the first 
session of the new Crimean Supreme Soviet. 
  A meeting of the parliamentary presidium in Simferopol 
Tuesday decided to launch the first session of the Crimean 
Supreme Soviet on 10 May 1994.

  [Text] Ukraine's Justice Ministry has published a statement 
on the latest developments in Crimea. The document stresses 
that Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov continues to take illegal 
actions. In particular, he issued decrees dismissing the head of 
the Crimean Security Service, General (Kolomyytsev) and Minister 
of Internal Affairs General Plyuta, and replaced them with 
others as acting officials. 
  Such actions by the president of the Republic of Crimea, the 
statement says, are not only a gross violation of Ukraine's 
legislation, international norms, and human rights, but also of 
the Constitution of the Republic of Crimea on which Yuriy 
Meshkov recently swore a presidential oath. The fundamental law 
of Crimea entitles the president only to nominate a candidate 
for the head of the security service before the autonomy's 
Supreme Council. The appointment, as well as dismissal of this 
official, is executed by the head of the Security Service of 
Ukraine. 
  As for the minister of internal affairs, this official can 
be 
appointed or dismissed by the president of the Republic of 
Crimea only with the consent of the Supreme Council of Crimea, 
stresses the statement.

  [Text] In a move to boldly confront the economic crisis on

Donetsk-Dniester region decided to conduct an experiment; but 
not all of them. The project was initiated by residents of 
Lugansk. A joint resolution "On Additional Measures To Increase

crisis and lack of credits and funds for trade, the only viable

agreements among enterprises, which would quickly and 
efficiently fill store shelves with goods. The agreement 
specified terms of trade and economic cooperation and

deputies, 337, which amounts to a constitutional majority and 
allows a session to begin. Results are being verified in one of 
the constituencies in Odessa oblast. The 337 new deputies 
include 56 members of the previous parliament. 
  The meeting also approved an estimate of expenses for the 
Ukrainian presidential election on 26 June 1994 submitted by the 
Central Electoral Commission, and an estimate of expenses and 
paper needs for the local council elections due on the same date. 
  The presidium approved the design of a jubilee medal, "50th 
anniversary of the victory in the Great Patriotic War 1941-45," 
and resolved to hold a parliamentary conference for the new 
parliament: "Experience, forms, and methods of parliamentarian 
work", provisionally, in June. 
  The presidium resolved to hold the last session of Ukraine's

<F P=106> [From the "Business News Weekly" feature No. 15, 4-10 Apr 94] </F>
  [Text] On 10 April natural gas supplies will be 
discontinued to those state-run enterprises, which have failed, 
by the deadline, to repay their debts for earlier imported 
natural gas supplies, under the most recent decision by the 
Ukrainian Government. 
  This last resort on the part of Ukrainian gas distributors 
under the State Committee for Oil and Gas (Ukrgazprom and 
Ukrgaz) follows from the government's resolution No. 196 "On 
enterprises' settlement for natural gas." 
  The Cabinet's earlier resolutions (No. 91 of 4 February, and 
No. 789 of 22 September 1993), which demanded repayment of 
natural gas supplies by consumer enterprises and reduced gas 
supplies to those of them, which failed to timely pay for gas 
supplied to them, were virtually ignored. 
  It was only in March, that the agents under the State 
Committee for Oil and Gas took a series of actions to make the 
debtor-enterprises, primarily those under the Ministry of 
Industry and the Ministry of Engineering, MIC 
[Military-Industrial Complex] and Conversion, remarkable for 
their power-consuming production, start repayment of their 
accumulating debts, or, as a most promising alternative 
solution, switch to other sources of energy. 
  However, the State Committee for Oil and Gas can not 
discontinue gas supplies to many of its clients, be they most 
inveterate defaulters, without running the grave risk of 
breaking their technological processes, which may cause 
technical failures and accidents. 
  The latest resolution, No. 196, allows the State Committee 
for Oil and Gas to resort to complete suspension of gas 
delivery, if the debtors fail to settle by 10 April. The 
responsibility for likely consequences will lie entirely on the 
debtor-enterprises' managers. 
  In view of this qualitatively novel situation, the managers 
will have to rely on their enterprises' currency means, 
including those on accounts with foreign banks, however 
reluctant they may be to do this. 
  For several months by now, the government has been very 
unswervingly trying to make Ukrainian export-capable enterprises 
share the burden of payment for imported Russian fuels. 
  As Ukrgazprom and Ukrgaz spokespersons maintain, the thus 
changed system of payments (prepayments thrice a month by 
consumer-enterprises of their contractual gas consignments) and 
final settling for 1993's supplies, will allow the State 
Committee for Oil and Gas to accumulate, within a relatively 
brief period, means, necessary for settling with the Russian 
natural gas suppliers. Moreover so that the government's earlier 
resolutions contain provisions demanding settling in hard 
currency by those enterprises, which have currency means on 
their bank accounts. 
  However, natural gas supply reductions by the government's 
decision do not extend to enterprises, which operate in the 
housing, communal services and public amenities sector of 
Ukraine's national economy, financed through the state budget. 
Instead, regional administrations have been instructed to 
tighten their control over rational gas consumption by these 
enterprises. 
  To speedily implement the mechanism for mutual settlement 
with Russia's gas suppliers, the Ukrainian Government has 
endorsed a scheme, which provides for the debt's repayment with 
Ukrainian commodities through the agency of Ukrzarubezhneftegaz 
(Ukraine's Foreign Oil and Gas), Ukraine's authorized 
go-between. In line with this scheme consumer-enterprises are 
supposed to remit their karbovanets sums to Ukrgazprom's bank 
accounts. The latter organisation then remits them to 
Ukrzarubezhneftegaz, which, in turn, purchases the agreed 
assortment and amounts of Ukrainian commodities (the resolution 
endorsed this list of commodities including automobiles, trucks, 
equipment, foods) for karbovanets, thus pooling the necessary 
resources to settle with the Russian suppliers. Earlier, 
Ukrgazprom had to buy Russian rubles or hard currency on its 
own, paying for the prices at the NBU-set [National Bank of 
Ukraine] official rates. In many instances, however, it could 
not raise the necessary sum, anyway. 
  The latest scheme is said to replicate, in many of its 
elements, its precursor, which proved to be inefficient (see UBN 
No. 2/1994). The two parties' authorized agents, Ukrheftesnab 
and Rosneftekomplekt, failed to reach the objective of 
materially and technically extinguishing the Ukrainian debt for 
Russian fuels. 
  The Ukrzarubezhneftegaz scheme is very much resemblant of 
the 
one, which the Austro-Swiss Nordex Group applies. However, its 
efficiency in Ukrzarubezhneftegaz's interpretation and 
application is to be tested. 
  On 4 April the Cabinet of Ministers adopted yet another 
resolution of the same gas series, "On prices for natural gas 
supplied to enterprises under the Ministry of Industry and the 
Ministry of Engineering, MIC and Conversion in 1994." 
  The resolution specifies that settling for imported gas by 
enterprises of the said ministries is effected in Russian rubles 
or hard currency at price rates, which are equivalent to 65 US 
dollars per 1,000 cu. m [cubic meters]. The price includes 
haulage payable gas piping agencies, which is equivalent to 4.1 
USD per 1,000 cu. m. 
  The above stated prices, however, are not applicable to 
enterprises, which manufacture fertilizers and pesticides in 
contracted amounts, intended for vernal agricultural purposes. 
  The government's previous resolution No. 23 of 3 January 
1994 
"On settling for natural gas by enterprises under the Ministry 
of Industry and the Ministry of Engineering, MIC and 
Conversion," specified, however, that these enterprises were to 
pay charges for gas piping across Ukraine's territory with 
Ukrainian karbovanets. 
  This item's abrogation may testify to the government's 
determination to make the said gas consumers follow the 
government-designed strategy, which provides for the Ukrainian 
enterprises paying not only for imported fuels, but also charges 
involved in fuel delivery to end-users. 
  The piping agencies under the State Committee for Oil and 
Gas 
are supposed to be safeguarded by the government's resolution 
against the consumers' non-timely payments for natural gas 
imported from Russia and supplied to them. 
  The January No. 23 resolution also specified that the two 
above listed ministries and the State Committee for Oil and Gas 
were to ensure conclusion by their subordinate enterprises of 
contracts for additional acquisition by each ministry of 6 
billion cu. m. of natural gas for the national economy's needs. 
The price to be paid for these amounts of natural gas was not 
specified earlier. However, as it is quite obvious now, 
industrial enterprises were none too eager to conclude such 
deals by late January, as instructed by the government. 
  So, the 4 April resolution by the Cabinet of Ministers, in 
addition to making it incumbent on the enterprises to conclude 
such agreements (without setting the deadline, though), contains 
a provision, which specifies the price to be paid, to wit, 52.4 
USD per 1,000 cu. m. The State Committee for Oil and Gas, same 
as before, is to pay for this amount of natural gas to 
industrial enterprises with Ukrainian karbovanets at "the 
official currency (exchange) rate set by the National Bank of 
Ukraine, as of the date of payment." 
  The resolution does not mention any additional payments by 
enterprises, which did conclude agreements and which did pay the 
previous price. If any such enterprises are found their 
position will be most enviable, anyway. 
  Obviously, by hooks or by crooks, the government has thus 
been trying to make state-owned enterprises pay for the bulk of 
fuels, consumed by state-budgeted entities. 
  The state's financing is not enough to cover the fuel 
expenses of state-budgeted entities at least by 50 per cent by 
the State Committee for Oil and Gas, as its chairman, Mikhail 
Kovalko, noted in late 1993 (see UBN No. 5/1994). 
  Nonetheless, the Cabinet of Ministers instructed the State 
Committee for Oil and Gas to fully and continuously ensure fuel 
flows to the state-budgeted sector of Ukraine's national economy. 
  Probably, industrial enterprises will have to offset the 
financial gap through currency rate margins. However, the 
government's apparent determinedness on the issue does not mean 
that enterprises under the Ministry of Industry and Ministry of 
Engineering, MIC and Conversion will rush to pay for fuel 
imports. 
  The new settling system places the State Committee's gas 
piping organisations in a favorable position. If previously 
they had to willy-nilly credit industrial enterprises and were 
unable to settle for imported fuels, the situation has radically 
changed now. 
  According to utterances by Ukrgaz's and Ukrgazprom's senior 
officers, if Ukrainian domestic consumers repay all their fuel 
debts and start regular prepayment of fuel supplies (as 
specified, on a thrice a month basis). Ukraine's gas piping 
organisations will be able to redeem the major part of Ukraine's 
tremendous fuel debt to Russia, which is Ukraine's major fuel 
supplier, by 1994 with very good prospects for final settling by 
October and ability to purchase Russian gas in required amounts 
henceforth. 
  Ukraine's is reported to have succeeded in settling with 
Russia for gas supplies over 1994's first three months (about 
100 million dollars). 
  However, 1993's remaining 700 million USD indebtedness is a 
major challenge.

  [Text] According to the State Committee for Nuclear Power 
Utilization, in March 1994, Ukraine's five NPP's [nuclear power 
plants] operated 14 power generating units (12.8 million kW 
aggregate capacity), which generated 7,247.4 MWe [expansion 
unknown], or 39.26 per cent of Ukraine's total electricity 
generation. The plan was thus fulfilled by 104.9 per cent. 
  However, technical faults and failures resulted in 113.43 
MWe 
undergenerated. 885.6 MWe were lost as a result of reducing 
capacities' output. 
  Over the month period, 15 incidents were registered, none of 
which, as experts maintain, involved radiation emissions in 
excess of acceptable rates. 
  The Zaporozhye NPP was the main culprit of reduced 
generation 
(a 673.6 MWe loss) with its 3d and 4th power generating units 
undergoing maintenance. 
  The Khmelnitsky NPP's 1st power generating unit was 
undergoing repair, too, same as the Rivne nuke's 1st unit (since 
February). The Chernobyl NPP's 3d power generating unit was 
stopped on 2 April for repair, which is scheduled to last until 
16 April.

  [Excerpt] Yerevan, April 12 (SNARK)--Last night two 
Azerbaijani military planes dropped bombs on the large 
industrial centers Goris and Kapan in the south of Armenia. As 
SNARK was informed in the Defence Ministry today, there is some 
destruction in the suburbs of Kapan. According to the 
preliminary data, there are no fatalities. 
  The Armenian Air-Defence Service tried to prevent the 
air-raid, but the Azerbaijani planes, flying at low altitude, 
managed to get away. 
  Over the last 48 hours this was already the third attack of 
the Azerbaijani Army at the cities of Nagorno-Karabakh and 
Armenia, located far from the confrontation line. 
  Yesterday Levon Zurabyan acting in the capacity of the 
Armenian President's press-secretary in his interview to SNARK 
qualified those actions as terrorist acts against the peaceful 
population, caused by Azerbaijan's disability to succeed at the 
battle field. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Today Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich departed on 
a working visit to Moscow. The purpose of the prime minister's 
visit is to finally agree upon the documents on the unification 
of monetary systems of Belarus and Russia. The Belarusian 
delegation to the talks with Russian leadership includes Deputy 
Supreme Soviet Chairman Bambiza, First Deputy Prime Minister 
Myasnikovich, Deputy Prime Minister Kostsikaw, Deputy Prime 
Minister Zalamay, National Bank Chairman Bahdankevich, Finance 
Minister Yanchuk, Defense Minister Kazlowski, Shurkdz, head of 
the State Committee for Customs, and other officials. 
  Just now, we have received the following information from 
Moscow. Prime Ministers Viktor Chernomyrdin and Vyachaslaw 
Kebich signed an agreement on the unification of monetary 
systems of Russia and Belarus. The essence of the achieved 
agreements is that the process of unification will take place in 
two stages. In the first stage, beginning from 1 May 1994, 
custom duties in trade will be abated, fees for transit of 
Russian cargoes on Belarusian territory will be abolished, and 
Russia will be given the right to no-charge lease of strategic 
facilities of the Belarusian Armed Forces. The second stage -- 
the direct exchange of Belarusian cash currency for Russian 
rubles on a one-to-one exchange rate -- should be preceded by 
the political expression of will of Belarusian people on account 
of the unification of [Belarusian] monetary system with Russia. 
The Russian-Belarusian intergovernmental talks have also 
resulted in the signing of seven bilateral documents, which are 
an indispensable part of the agreement on the unification of 
monetary systems.

  [Text] Two Azeri aircrafts after violating Armenian air 
space late on Monday dropped bombs on the border towns of Goris 
and Kapan, a Defence Ministry spokesman in Yerevan told 
Interfax. Reports speak of destruction but no casualties, he 
said. 
  Armenian defences were unable to thwart the attack because 
the two planes flew at a low altitude making it difficult to 
detect them. 
  Two days ago, Azerbaijan carried out a bombing raid on 
several areas in Nagorno-Karabakh and its administrative center 
Stepanakert; one woman and two children were killed and nine 
other people injured, most of them women and children. However, 
Baku denies this. 
  The Armenian villages of Movses and Aigepar in the Taush 
region and Armenian positions outside Aigeovit and Vazashen 
villages came under intensive artillery fire from Azeri troops 
in the past twenty-four hours, the press office of the Armenian 
Defence Ministry said. There were civilian casualties, it 
informed. 
  It also said Armenian forces foiled an Azeri advance outside 
the Aigeovit village in the Idjevan Region on Monday. There 
were casualties on both sides. 
  For its part, the Azeri Defence Ministry reports that 
Karabakh forces which received reinforcements from Armenia had 
tried to launch an offensive in the northern part of the 
frontline outside the village of Gyulistan in the Geranboi 
(formerly Shaumian) region. Baku says that about 2,000 Karabakh 
troops and dozens of tanks were involved. Azeri government 
troops have so far succeeded in containing the Armenian advance, 
it said. 
  In a separate development, Armenian forces launched an 
offensive on the eastern Azeri villages of Talysh, Madagiz and 
Levonarkh in the Ter-Ter Region. Several people were killed or 
injured after Armenian troops mounted rocket fire on the 
administrative center Ter-Ter whose population is 20,000. 
  More fighting is reported elsewhere on the front including 
the Agdam Region. Several population centers in the Tauz Region 
came under cross border rocket and artillery fire from Armenia 
leading to civilian casualties, the Azeri Defence Ministry said.

  [Text] According to Defense Ministry press service reports, 
the Azerbaijani Army resumed its combat operations along the 
northeastern border of Armenia last night. The enemy opened 
tank, howitzer, and machine gun fire from his military base in 
(Garadash) in Tauzskiy Rayon on Movses and Aygepar and the 
defensive positions around these villages in Tavushskiy Rayon 
between 1830-2030. There are injured among the peaceful 
population. 
  The Azerbaijani armed formations at Dhzafarli military base 
in Kazakhskiy Rayon opened intensive artillery fire on Aygehovit 
and Vazashen in Idzhevanskiy Rayon at around 1900. Half an hour 
later, a large enemy infantry formation, supported by tanks, 
tried to break through the Armenian defensive lines and invade 
Aygehovit. Following fierce battles, the Armenia's border guards 
managed to halt and then repulse the enemy's surprise tank 
attack. There are losses on both sides, and material 
destruction in Aygehovit and Vazashen. 
  Two Azerbaijani bombers flying low over Karabakh airspace 
intruded on the Armenian Republic's airspace at around 2228. 
Azerbaijani planes dropped two bombs on Goris and another two on 
Kapan. They flew off over southern part of Karabakh. The 
Armenian air-defense forces could not retaliate effectively 
because the planes were flying low. 
  We have not yet received any information on today's 
situation 
on borders and in Nagorno-Karabakh.

  [Text] Armenia's parliament has called for international 
condemnation of what it has described as military action against 
civilians and for international measures to prevent such action 
in the future. 
  In a statement published in Yerevan on Monday evening, 
following an Azerbaijani air raid on the Nagorno-Karabakh 
capital Stepanakert which killed three and injured nine people, 
the Armenian legislature appealed to the United Nations, the 
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, the European 
Parliament, the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly, and the 
parliaments of all countries to "most adamently" condemn 
Azerbaijan's military action against civilians and "take urgent 
measures, based on international law, to prevent future air 
raids on populated areas." 
  "By such barbarous acts, Azerbaijan is again proving that it 
has not abandoned its official policy of terrorism against the 
people of Nagorno-Karabakh, the aim of which is to annihilate 
the civilian population," the parliament said.

<F P=106> ["Text" of Armenian Government statement on 9 April] </F>
  [Text] Azerbaijan's military aircraft infiltrated the 
airspace of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic [NKR] and bombed 
several residential areas, including Stepanakert, on 10 April. 
The bombed areas are far away from the front line. The densely 
populated market-place area in Stepanakert was selected as a 
target. Significant damage was caused and many people, mainly 
women and children, were killed. 
  Regrettably, the international community has failed to 
properly assess the policy of bombarding peaceful residential 
areas, which has been maintained since 1992. That has created 
an opportunity for Azerbaijan to continue to bomb residential 
areas without being penalized for such operations. 
  Azerbaijan's savage operations have reconfirmed that the 
republic has not relinquished its policy of state terrorism 
against NKR's people. The objective of that policy is to kill 
peaceful residents. However, that is a gross violation of 
international law and the Geneva Convention. Obviously, it is 
aimed at further expanding the confrontation and undermining the 
recent initiatives that have been made to restore peace in the 
region. 
  The Armenian Supreme Council declares that Azerbaijan will 
be 
held fully responsible for similar activities in the future. It 
also appeals to the UN secretary general, the CSCE, the CIS, the 
European Parliament, and the parliaments of individual countries 
to consider the military operations against peaceful people, 
take practical and urgent measures as called for by 
international law, prevent the bombing of residential areas, and 
obstruct Azerbaijan's unacceptable activities. 
  Terrorist activity took place in Georgia's Marneuli Rayon on 
the night between 8 and 9 April. One of the passenger cars of 
the train on the Tbilisi-Yerevan track was destroyed by an 
explosion. Three passengers were killed and 15 others were 
wounded in the incident. Five passenger cars were completely 
destroyed by the fire caused by the explosion. The engineering 
installations and passenger cars on the Tbilisi-Yerevan track 
have been damaged by explosions 20 times and the natural-gas 
pipeline in the region has been sabotaged 12 times since the 
beginning of 1993. The fact that acts of sabotage against 
Armenia have taken place in an area populated by Azerbaijani 
people in Georgia leaves no doubt about who is responsible for 
terrorist activities. Obviously, Azerbaijan, in contravention 
of all international norms, has selected Georgia's territory as 
the venue of the operations it wishes to carry out to realize 
its objectives. That is an indication of the effort it has been 
making to involve Armenia and Georgia in the confrontation. 
  There must be an end to that kind of international 
terrorism, 
which has assumed violent proportions. The Armenian Government 
states that all necessary measures will be taken to guarantee 
the security of Armenia's citizens and safeguard Armenia's 
interests. Azerbaijan's leaders will be fully responsible for 
the worsening of the situation in the future. The Armenian 
Government hopes that Georgia's leaders will take practical 
measures to guarantee security of transportation between Georgia 
and Armenia. 
  Dated: Yerevan City, 9 April 1994.

  [Text] Azerbaijan air force planes again bombed residential 
areas in Stepanakert, capital of Nagorno-Karabakh, at 0630 
today. According to preliminary figures, an INTERFAX 
correspondent reports, five people were killed and more than ten 
wounded. The dead and injured consist mainly of women and 
children. Several buildings were destroyed. 
  In connection with this the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic's 
government accused Azerbaijan of continuing the war against the 
civilian population of Karabakh. According to a statement 
issued today, Azerbaijani planes have twice in the last three 
days bombed Stepanakert, killing women and children who are tens 
of kilometers away from the area of military actions. The 
ruling circles of Azerbaijan have again demonstrated to the 
whole world the true worth of their false peace-loving 
assurances, the statement stresses.

  [Text] Prime Minister Grant Bagratyan told Director of the 
IMF's European Department Muhammad Shatman that the government's 
decision to re-start the Armenian nuclear power plant was due to 
the absence of alternative ways of softening the energy crisis. 
  To quote Bagratyan, Armenia counted on international 
financial organizations' aid in putting the nuclear power plant 
back into operation. 
  Shatman said that the IMF's executive council did not object 
to helping Armenia and that this position had been confirmed 
during the executive committee's Washington conference involving 
15 donor-states. He said those countries welcomed Armenia's 
policy of economic reforms. 
  He pointed out, however, that aid to Armenia largely 
depended 
on the situation in the region. "The donor-states are expecting 
meaningful progress in the settlement of the Karabakh conflict, 
he said. IF Note: Local experts note that until recently the 
IMF abstained from extending credits to Armenia fearing lest it 
might be used for military purposes.

  [Text] Yerevan, April 12 (SNARK)--Representatives of many 
opposition parties have spoken in the Parliament condemning the 
unlawful methods that were used during the "reservists' call-up 
for three-month assembly". 
  The member of the Parliamentary Commission on Human Rights 
Agasi Arshakyan reported that many meetings took place in 
Armenia. The participants of those meetings adopted a 
resolution condemning the unacceptable round-ups in public 
places, violence and arbitrariness applied during the military 
assembly. 
  The parents of those taken to the assembly quite often have 
no idea about the further fate and location of their children, 
declared the Head of the National Library of Armenia, Deputy 
Rafayel Ishkhanyan. He noted that such methods, inadmissible 
even during World War 2, were used only in Osmanian [Ottoman] 
Empire. 
  Ishkhanyan warned that such actions of law enforcement 
bodies 
may have negative consequences -- decomposition of the Army, 
demoralization of the young generation, cessation of 
humanitarian aid, because of the violations of human rights in 
Armenia.

  [Text] Geneva, April 12 (AFP) -- Multi-party talks began 
here Tuesday [12 April] on finalising the mandate for UN 
peacekeepers to oversee a ceasefire between Georgia and its 
breakaway republic of Abkhazia, a UN spokesman said. 
  The UN-brokered talks, attended by delegations from Georgia, 
Abkhazia and Russia, were convened to fine-tune the conditions 
under which the UN force will be deployed in the region 
following a ceasefire accord signed April 4. 
  The talks are expected to last two days, diplomats said. 
  The Russian delegation, which comprises high-ranking 
diplomatic and military officials and is led by First Deputy 
Defence Minister Georgi Kondratyev, will try to persuade the UN 
Security Council to accord peacekeeping status to Russian troops 
in and around the separatist region, diplomats said. 
  Granting the request would make the Russian force, which has 
been stationed in Georgia as a buffer between the two forces, 
eligible for UN funding. 
  The principle of a multi-national peacekeeping force was 
accepted by Georgian and Abkhazian authorities on April 4. 
  The UN's special representative to the negotiations, Edouard 
Brunner, said Tuesday that it would be "premature" to release 
any information on their progress. 
  The Security Council said Friday that the establishment of a 
peacekeeping forces inside Abkhazia was conditional on the 
current talks and others resuming April 19 on the future 
constitutional status of Abkhazia making "substantial progress 
towards a political settlement." 
  Abkhazia declared its sovereignty in July 1992. But Georgia 
has refused to countenance changes to its borders and, with the 
backing of the international community, has proposed that the 
separatist republic be granted a "broad autonomy" while 
remaining tied to Tbilisi. 
  The current round of talks are due to end at the end of 
April. 
  Earlier rounds of peace talks took place in October, January 
and February. 
  Separatists routed Georgian troops from the Abkhazian 
capital 
Sukhumi in September after 13 months of fighting which left more 
than 3,000 dead. 
  The fate of some 250,000 Georgian refugees who fled Abkhazia 
after Sukhumi fell is the subject of separate negotiations 
currently taking place in the Russian Black Sea port of Sochi.

  [Text] The military council of the Black Sea Fleet asked on 
12 April the presidents of Ukraine and Russia to help bring 
about the immediate release of the arrested officers and "put an 
end to the practice of the use of force by the Ukrainian Defense 
Ministry, since they lead nowhere and can cause nothing but 
adequate counter measures on the part of the Black Sea Fleet 
personnel." 
  The Black Sea Fleet cannot be intimidated. It has always 
been loyal to the peoples of Russia and Ukraine, to the military 
duty and the oath of allegiance sworn only once. 
  A group of the Odessa special forces attempted to arrest in 
the port of Odessa on 9 April, the Black Sea Naval vessel 
"Cheleken" and prevent its planned movement to Sebastopol. A 
group of Black Sea Fleet reserve ships were blocked last weekend. 
  Three Black Sea Fleet officers were arrested In the early 
hours of 11 April in Odessa. Unofficial reports say that two of 
them are still under arrest. This vicious practice is a link in 
a chain of well-planned actions aimed at re-subordination of 
part of Black Sea Fleet facilities to the Ukrainian Defense 
Ministry. It is an out-of-bounds attempt to torpedo the 
Massandra agreements, says the appeal. 
  Moreover, the senseless policies by definite circles in the 
Ukrainian Defense Ministry and its naval force may cause 
unpredictable consequences up to armed clashes and casualties, 
says the document.

<F P=106> [Report by diplomatic correspondents Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy </F>
Trubetskoy and others from the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature] 
  [Text] The incident in which Ukrainian special force took a 
group of Black Sea Fleet ships under control in Odessa need not 
be blown out of proportion. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister 
Sergei Krylov told Interfax Tuesday that neither Russia nor 
Ukraine wanted it. 
  It his view, things have to be sorted out. "We must find out 
who is guilty and of what and not allow the incident to grow in 
scale," Krylov said. 
  He said that he had been in Kiev Monday where he had met 
fairly well-informed Ukrainian Foreign Ministry and Defense 
Ministry officials. He said it was difficult to make out a 
clear picture of what had happened. In his words, some its 
aspects were incomprehensible and unpleasant and some people 
involved in it were reportedly drunk and that nobody had 
authorized them to do what they did. 
  Krylov thought that the incident happened between various 
branches of the Navy and had to be resolved by them. He 
recalled that the fleet was under joint command of two 
presidents. The original cause of the conflict was that some 
navigational instruments were moved from one Ukrainian port to 
another. They were to remain the property of the same navy, 
Krylov believed. The whole story was probably the fault of 
sailors who have now to settle the conflict, he said. 
  Krylov thought that Ukraine was least of all interested in 
perpetuating the incident when its new parliament had not even 
started work. Such incidents would inflame the Ukrainian 
radicals and this would destabilize the situation, Krylov 
thought. He believed that there were numerous hotheads in 
Russia, too. In his view, there was no need to add to tensions. 
  He did not agree that the Russo-Ukrainian relations were 
increasingly deadlocked. He believed that both Russians and 
Ukrainians had a fairly clear idea of what they wanted from each 
other but their good intentions were not easy to materialize. 
Domestic factors had a significant role to play in this. 
Because Ukraine's new parliament had not even been convened, 
the executive branch was to some extent inactive, Krylov said. 
  Krylov thought that such incidents would inflame Ukrainian 
radicals and could further destabilize the situation. 
  He emphasized that Russia regarded the Crimea as part of 
Ukraine but did not shut the door on economic and cultural links 
with the Crimea.

<F P=106> [Interview with former Russian Federation Vice President </F>
Aleksandr Vladimirovich Rutskoy by Enrico Franceschini in 
Moscow; date not given: "I Will Bring About Russia's Rebirth"] 
  [Excerpt] Moscow -- [introductory passage omitted] Former 
Russian Federation Vice President] Rutskoy is alive, free, and 
determined to achieve power. He is set to challenge Yeltsin, 
Zhirinovskiy, and all other candidates in the forthcoming 
presidential elections. His slogan is: "Make Russia Great 
Again," which is the purported aim of the book he is currently 
writing, "The Collapse of a Power." In fact, this was the 
starting point of the interview with LA REPUBBLICA and CORRIERE 
DELLA SERA: The book will explain, he said, "how we ended up in 
this shameful situation, and how Russia's power can be restored." 
  [Franceschini] Aleksandr Vladimirovich, that "power" began 
to 
collapse when you were still vice president. Could you do 
nothing to prevent the collapse then? 
  [Rutskoy] Unfortunately not. There was a plan to push me 
aside, to discredit me and gradually deprive me of all power. 
  [Franceschini] But why did you decide to break with Yeltsin 
and swim against the tide? 
  [Rutskoy] Because they wanted a subservient vice president, 
one who would have no opinions, make no proposals, not ask the 
president any tricky questions, not criticize any of the 
do-nothings and irresponsible elements in his team. The first 
crack in our relationship appeared over Gaydar's economic 
reforms. I was against them. The second crack developed over 
my disgreement with the devious way in which it was decided to 
found the Commonwealth of Independent States and thus destroy 
the Soviet Union. Then came the rest: corruption, bribery at 
every level of power, the cynical plundering of natural 
resources, begging the West for aid in a most humiliating 
fashion, and a subordinate foreign policy, as if Russia were a 
doormat for the West to wipe the mud off its shoes. 
  [Franceschini] Zhirinovskiy also says all those things. 
  [Rutskoy] True, and I feel close to anyone who loves the 
fatherland, who says that Russia deserves to fulfil the role of 
a superpower. This country covers one sixth of the planet's 
land: Fill it with a mixture of civil war, deprivation, 
epidemics, nuclear power stations, and chemical plants, and the 
result of all this will inevitably undermine stability in Europe 
and Asia. Beggars do not wield a sword but at most a stick. 
However, if Russia wields a stick instead of a sword, it will 
be crushed. De Gaulle used to say: The sword is the axis of 
peace. But when the sword is held by only one country, then the 
latter becomes the world's watchdog. That is why at least two 
superpowers are needed. As far as Zhirinovskiy is concerned, 
although our positions may differ in some respects, I believe we 
can reach an agreement, as long as it is understood that I 
reject radicalism and demagoguery. 
  [Franceschini] What concerns you most at present? 
  [Rutskoy] Our nation's debasement. Cynicism, immorality, 
lying, theft, have become everyday events. Patriotism, on the 
other hand, is considered a form of extremism, akin to fascism 
or nazism. I am also alarmed by something else, namely the 
resigned attitude of many people. Economic reforms that have 
plunged us into poverty, an armed attack on parliament, a 
Constitution worthy of a monarch -- what else must the so-called 
"democrats" do for people to understand that we can no longer 
live like this, that this is the beginning of the end? Where 
else do people work without being paid for months on end, where 
elso do pensions condemn people to starvation, children have 
nothing to eat, mortality outweigh births, and the dead get 
buried in plastic bags? In Russia, which was once a great and 
powerful nation. I would like to ask the miners, the workers, 
the peasants who today voice their protest: Where were you in 
September-October 1993? How could you betray those who wanted 
to defend you? Can you not see that the person responsible for 
all this is your president? 
  [Franceschini] What did you expect the people to do then? 
  [Rutskoy] I expected them to suppoprt us. Not by rising up 
in arms, but through a civil protest, a general strike. 
Unfortunately, nothing of the sort happened. First everyone 
was calling for the president's resignation. Then, when Yeltsin 
dissolved parliament, they all fell back again on a 
hand-to-mouth policy based on compromise. The result: The 
executioners and ravagers of the country have been confirmed in 
power. 
  [Franceschini] If you could go back, would you act 
differently? 
  [Rutskoy] May I reverse the question: Would the people 
today, knowing how things ended, still support the president? 
  [Franceschini] You claim that 500 people died at the White 
House rather than the 149 mentioned in the official report... 
  [Rutskoy] The world watched a live TV broadcast of the 
massacre, but an attempt is being made to hide the truth. 
Everybody is silent, including the new parliament, but that is 
only natural. Why say anything when they too are eating out of 
the same plate? Only the press raises its voice, but only to 
slander those who upheld the Constitution, and it blames us for 
everything. 
  [Franceschini] If you had resigned from your post as vice 
president, perhaps today you would be a deputy in the Duma. 
  [Rutskoy] All I ever got from being vice president were 
insults and injuries, but stepping down would have been like 
betraying my ideals, as well as all the people who voted for me. 
Most of the new deputies elected to the Duma have applied this 
theory: Betraying at the right moment means knowing how things 
will end. This applies to all parties, including Gaydar's, 
Yavlinkiy's, Shakhray's, and Zhirinovskiy's. I would not like 
to be in the company of men who are prepared to serve any regime 
as long as it feeds them. 
  [Franceschini] Is there a Rutskoy party? 
  [Rutskoy] The Free Russia People's Party, whose chairman I 
am. We will be holding a congress in May in order to adopt our 
new platform, win the next elections, and embark on reforms in 
the interest of the people. 
  [Franceschini] Will you therefore be standing in the 
presidential elections in 1996, or perhaps sooner if early 
elections are called? 
  [Rutskoy] Yes, if the party nominates me. 
  [Franceschini] Boris Yeltsin was one of your political 
"mentors," later he became a boss with whom you had some 
differences, still later an enemy, and finally the man who gave 
the order to shoot. What is your opinion of the president today? 
  [Rutskoy] I sincerely trusted this man. Unfortunately, I was 
much mistaken. I have learned one thing from him: how not to 
govern a country. 
  [Franceschini] Yeltsin now proposes a "social peace" 
agreement to all forces in the country... 
  [Rutskoy] Are there any assurances that the people signing 
it 
will not then be silenced? Does it make sense to invoke social 
peace and at the same time spy on one's opponents, tap their 
telephones? If I lean out of the window, I can see someone 
watching my home this very minute. All we have to do is go for 
a stroll downtown and someone would be on my tail immediately. 
I will vote with both hands for social peace, but such an 
agreement is not feasible with the present leaders. 
  [Franceschini] While you were in prison, a new Constitution 
was passed. Do you accept its legitimacy? 
  [Rutskoy] How can you accept a Constitution which was voted 
after the shooting on Parliament, and was passed by a only 
minority of voters? No, I do not accept it. But I am obliged 
to comply with it just like any other law-abiding citizen. This 
Constitution has the same value as power founded on bayonets. 
Furthermore, even its author (Yeltsin) is probably not happy 
with it, since it prevents him from doing everything he wants. 
  [Franceschini] What dou you think of the fight against crime 
and corruption? 
  [Rutskoy] Have you ever seen a thief punishing theft? Can 
someone who is corrupt combat corruption? 
  [Franceschini] It is feared in the West that if you become 
president, nationalism will resurface... 
  [Rutskoy] Why worry about the West? What Russia thinks is 
more important. But you can rest assured. With me as 
president, it is the Russian nation, not nationalism, that would 
be reborn. I am against the idea that one country should 
overpower others to prove its superiority. But I believe Russia 
will once again become a great nation. I will fight side by 
side with my people to bring about the day when Russia will 
again be a superpower.

  [Text] Russian presidential aide Georgiy Satarov believes 
that the initiative advanced by the Interfax news agency on the 
involvement of the mass media in the drafting of an agreement to 
reach civic accord in Russia "is very useful and timely." In an 
interview with Interfax on Monday he said that the contribution 
of the media for the creation of an atmosphere of civic accord 
in Russia may be very great, since the media is commonly 
believed to be the "fourth power." 
  Satarov said that "so far the contribution was not always 
positive because the reports were often sensational, alarming 
and not always balanced." He said that the shortcomings were 
understandable. They emerged because over the past few years 
the media was always in opposition and this stand was once 
useful and even historically progressive. 
  The opposition "niche," occupied by the press, determined 
until recently its bias towards giving assessments and sticking 
to ideology, believes Satarov. Now that the present democratic 
regime has a real opposition, the previous role of the press is 
now outdated, he added. 
  Satarov voiced hope that the Interfax initiative on the 
media's involvement in the negotiations on an agreement to reach 
a civil accord in Russia will urge the press to occupy its 
natural position as an objective reporter, with the relevant 
political and controlling functions. "I believe such a position 
by the media will help Russia achieve a political and social 
stabilization," Satarov said.

    [Editorial report] Moscow Ostankino Television First 
Channel Network in Russian at 1541 GMT on 12 April carries a 
10-minute interview -- live or recorded -- with S.A. Filatov, 
head of the Administration of the President of the Russian 
Federation, conducted by an unidentified interviewer. Filatov 
answers three questions: on the proposed political accord, the 
alleged blacklist of former Supreme Soviet deputies, and the 
composition of the Constitutional Court. 
  Filatov says that the people voted for a market economy and 
everyone agrees that there can be no going back; an agreement on 
political accord would ensure continuity of policies, to the 
benefit of all. 
  Filatov says that the so-called blacklist contains the names 
of those Supreme Soviet deputies who remained in the White House 
and fomented disorder; they will not receive financial 
compensation for their loss of income; housing rights will be 
decided on an individual basis. 
  Moving on to the question of the Constitutional Court, 
Filatov says: "I personally consider that the members of the 
Constitutional Court, as it was composed at the time, were 
considerably to blame for the harm which was caused to our 
state, ending with the dramatic events of last October. You may 
recall that the Constitutional Court was elected at the Congress 
of People's Deputies and it seems to me that, right from the 
start, the principle governing the nomination of the members of 
the Constitutional Court was incorrectly drawn up, because the 
nominations were to a considerable extent made by the political 
groupings, and the regions had very little representation on 
these questions. 
  "Unfortunately, we got a Constitutional Court which to a 
considerable extent represented various political forces. Hence 
the latest instruction issued by Boris Nikolayevich, and the 
instruction that the Council for Personnel Policy should draw up 
recommendations on the list of those candidates for the 
Constitutional Court which it should put forward to the 
Federation Council for appointment. We have now examined this 
question at the Council for Personnel Policy. We have agreed 
that the main criterion which we will look at in each candidate 
is his political neutrality. So, the candidate should not be a 
politician, should not be the leader of a party, political 
grouping etc. He should be in the first place a professional at 
his job. 
  "If the condition is observed that political neutrality and 
professionalism should be placed first, then there is no reason 
why the law on the Constitutional Court should not be adopted. 
I think that it is clear to everyone that such a law is now 
very much needed. It is particularly necessary now for the 
Third Estate, the third structure of power, to go into operation 
when work has begun on adopting the laws of the Russian 
Federation," Filatov concludes.

<F P=106> [Article by ITAR-TASS correspondent Liliya Kuznetsova, </F>
"Especially for ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA": "Rising Level of 
Migration"] 
  [Text] Since 1990 around 100,000 people a year have 
emigrated from Russia: The rise in the numbers emigrating is 
linked primarily with the liberalization of Russia's emigration 
legislation in recent years. The bulk of the emigrants are 
bound for Israel, Germany, and the United States. However, 
whereas in 1990 the bulk of migrants went to Israel, at present 
Germany is the leading recipient of emigrants from Russia. 
  There has been a large-scale exodus of Germans, Jews, 
Meskhetian Turks, and Greeks in evidence for a number of years 
now, but the increase in the proportion of Russians among the 
emigrants is quite a new phenomenon. 
  The migration of families is the dominant form of emigration 
and the demographic composition is close to that of the 
population of Russia: The proportions of pensioners and 
dependents in the population and among emigrants are 
approximately equal. 
  The proportion of white-collar workers stands out 
significantly in the social composition of people leaving Russia 
-- they constitute more than one-third of the total number of 
emigrants. This alarming figure reflects the process of the 
"brain drain" from fundamental science and the defense complex 
in Russia. 
  However, it must be noted that the level of migration from 
Russia is lower than from the neighboring foreign countries. 
For example, although the population of the Russian Federation 
constitutes a little over one-half of the population of the 
former USSR, the proportion of emigrants from Russia represents 
little more than one-fourth of the total emigration figure. 
  The tide of refugees, enforced migrants, and economic 
migrants from the former union republics into Russia could soon 
reach 6 million people. If the processes of destabilization in 
the former union republics ease, the number of potential 
migrants could be expected to be in the 2-3 million range. 
However, if there is a further worsening of the sociopolitical 
situation and the economic crisis and a broadening of the 
geographical spread of interethnic conflicts and discrimination 
against nonindigenous peoples, specialists of the Federal 
Migration Service believe that the potential tide of migrants 
could at least double and reach 4-6 million. 
  According to Tatyana Regent, leader of the Federal Migration 
Service, "the Russian migration service has the capacity to 
receive, place, and accommodate even such a significant influx 
of refugees." But for that it is necessary to resolve some 
financial problems: Given the acute shortage of state funds for 
the implementation of a large-scale program for the reception of 
migrants from the former union republics, it is necessary to 
attract resources from extrabudgetary sources.

Baltic states. But the embargo may be lifted in the near future 
as the Baltic conditions will meet the requirements of Sweden's 
legislation, he added. General Gustafsson explained that 
Swedish-Estonian military cooperation would primarily take the 
form of training. The first programmes may be started this 
autumn already, he said. 
  General Einseln stressed the importance of cooperation with 
Sweden considering its closeness and the good relations. 
  General Gustafsson is to visit Narva, the Viru Infantry 
battalion in Jdhvi [as received], and Tartu today. He is to 
leave for Riga in the evening.

<F P=106> [Report by Leonid Levitskiy: "Estonian Government Gets Rid </F>
of Awkward Newspaper"] 
  [Text] Tallinn -- RAHVA HAAL (Voice of the People), one of 
the most popular and influential newspapers, has lost literally 
everything -- its autonomy, all its journalists, and its voice. 
The latest issue has been produced by a new team catering for 
the ruling Fatherland Party. According to Toomas Leito, RAHVA 
HAAL's former editor, the collective has been punished for 
refusing to serve as this party's instrument. 
  Following Estonia's proclamation of independence, Edgar 
Savisaar's government made RAHVA HAAL a state joint-stock 
company. 
  Throughout this period RAHVA HAAL has been the Estonian 
state 
newspaper. It has upheld its interests and those of the 
Estonian nation vigorously, forthrightly, and not always 
objectively in my view. In terms of its number of subscribers 
it is Estonia's second newspaper. While ceasing to be an 
official press organ de jure it remained one de facto. But the 
journalists, primarily the editor and the editorial collegium, 
did not identify the state with the latest government, or the 
Estonian nation with the ruling Fatherland Party. Journalists 
consistently opposed the government's economic and social 
policy, And the authorities evidently grew tired of putting up 
with this opponent. RAHVA HAAL was put up for privatization. 
Young and rich entrepreneurs from Fatherland Party circles won 
the tender. But the "victory" was so equivocal that the 
privatization council, scared at society's abrupt response, 
immediately canceled the results of the tender. 
  Following the abortive cavalry charge with kroon in hand the 
government carried out a purely political attack -- and 
dismissed Editor Toomas Leito. Haste went hand in hand with 
carelessness, a breach of the law -- the first order had to be 
abrogated and a new one issued, formulated in more precise 
terms. Then the whole collective bar one man handed in their 
resignation. They began publishing the newspaper EESTI SYNUMID 
[name as transliterated] (Estonian News) with Toomas Leito as 
its editor. 
  Even the protection of Europe's organizations of journalists 
did not have an effect although the government is usually 
sensitive to European opinion. In last fall's municipal 
elections, the Fatherland Party suffered a major defeat. There 
will be parliamentary elections in a year's time, and the 
Fatherland Party is in a hurry to assert its ideological 
monopoly. 
  "While examining the most acute problems of the day from the 
position of the poorest population groups, RAHVA HAAL is failing 
to take notice of key aspects in the recent past," a member of 
the Fatherland Party asserts. That is unforgivable for a 
newspaper that is geared to the opinion of the poor, in other 
words the opinion of most voters, and enjoys their trust. 
According to official statistics, 5 percent of the republic's 
inhabitants are rich and around 20 percent are middle class, 
while the rest are poor.... 
  Will the government not try to do the same to other 
newspapers? "We are particularly alarmed by the Russian-speaking 
press, which sometimes engages in patently antistate propaganda 
(MOLODEZH ESTONII, ESTONIYA)," the Fatherland Party's official 
organ stressed. 
  If the Fatherland Party starts combating the 
Russian-speaking 
press by publishing its own "pro-Estonian official" newspaper, 
that is an exclusively party matter. But the easier and more 
tempting option is to make short shrift of ESTONIYA and MOLODEZH 
ESTONII. That is possible now that RAHVA HAAL has effectively 
been knocked out.

  [Text] Kiev, 11 Apr -- "Our Supreme Council has a qualified 
majority as envisaged by the Constitution. It can work, pass 
laws, and introduce amendments to the constitution, said Ivan 
Yemets, chairman of the Central Electoral Committee, in an 
interview with the Novyny television and radio agency. 
  According to him, 337 deputies were elected in two rounds of 
elections of people's deputies to the Ukrainian parliament. 
Among the deputies, 120 were nominated by voters, 89 by 
parties, and 128 by workers collectives. Most in the new 
parliament are members of the Communist Party (86); Rukh 
[Ukrainian People's Movement for Perestroyka] -- 20, Peasants 
Party -- 18, and 14 were elected by the Socialist Party. Namely 
these four parties define the party share of the present Supreme 
Council. 
  As regards the people's deputies in the current parliament, 
56 of the 188 members who ran in the elections were elected. As 
Ivan Yemets reported, repeat elections will be held in 112 
districts among which the elections in 92 districts were valid 
but the voters did not cast the required number of votes in 
favor of the candidates. The elections were void in 20 
districts where voters ignored their candidates and did not turn 
out at the polling stations in sufficient numbers. According to 
the law, repeat elections should be held within one month, but 
according to Ivan Yemets, there are still problems which the 
Central Electoral Commission has to resolve.

would not contribute to confrontations or increase the scale of 
the bloodshed. He told an INTERFAX correspondent in Madrid 
Tuesday that Russia will keep in touch with Butrus Butrus-Ghali 
and Bill Clinton to avoid a repetition of the incident.

<F P=106> [Unattributed roundup: "Can the Fragments of a Bosnian </F>
Settlement Be Put Back Together After NATO Air Strike?"] 
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] 
<H5>  Russian Federation </H5>
Defense Ministry's View 
  In a phone call to U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry, 
Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev has expressed serious 
concern over the NATO bombers' air raid against the Serb 
positions near the Bosnian town of Gorazde. The "hot line" 
conversation was at the American side's request. Pavel Grachev 
stressed that the use of military force, particularly from the 
air, is incapable of producing a positive result in resolving 
the conflict in the region. The Russian minister advocated 
sending additional peacekeeping ground forces to the 
confrontation zone. And, Pavel Grachev noted, the warring 
factions should retreat to their previous positions, which will 
make it possible to create a demilitarized zone in the Balkans. 
[passage omitted] 
  "At the request of Serbian President Milosevic, I am 
currently heading for Pale, the Bosnian Serb capital, to attempt 
to put back together [sobrat] the fragments of the Bosnian 
settlement process," Vitaliy Churkin, the Russian president's 
special representative and Russian Federation deputy foreign 
minister, told an ITAR-TASS correspondent in Belgrade. 
  Following the NATO air strikes, he continued in the 
interview, the Bosnian Serbs stated that they were ending all 
cooperation with the UN forces. Nonetheless, during today's 
meeting with President Milosevic we reached an understanding 
that the process should not be allowed to drift, and that it is 
necessary nonetheless to reach a cease-fire agreement -- which 
has not proved possible in the past few days. 
  It is a question of a truce along the entire frontline, 
ideally starting with Gorazde. Since in recent hours there had 
again been alarming reports about the resumption of the shelling 
of this town, the Russian diplomat noted, I put this question to 
Milosevic, who contacted Bosnian Serb leader Karadzic, who 
subsequently ordered that the shelling of Gorazde be stopped. 
  In my assessment, V. Churkin said, in the case of Gorazde 
there is a strong element of uncontrolled military action on the 
part of both the Serb and Muslim sides. It should not be 
forgotten that it was the Muslims who initiated hostilities in 
Gorazde, despite the fact that the region had been declared a 
"protected area" by the United Nations. 
  But, on the whole, a very serious position has now come 
about 
and a qualitatively new element has arisen -- intervention in 
the Bosnian conflict by the United Nations and the international 
community. There is a tendency to slide into even greater 
confrontation. This is what we are now making every effort to 
avert, and we believe that the main way is to conclude a truce 
agreement. 
  V. Churkin noted that nobody on the UN or NATO side 
consulted 
with Russian representatives before the air strikes, even though 
there had been enough time to do so. Unfortunately, the 
consultation mechanism failed to work. Admittedly, he added, 
the Bosnian Serbs did not consult us either. When we asked and 
warned about the dangerous development of the situation, they 
replied that they had no plans in respect of Gorazde and that 
the Russian side had no need to take any major action to 
normalize the situation in Gorazde. All parties could have made 
greater efforts to ensure that Russia provided mediation 
assistance, but this was not done. 
  When asked about possible new NATO action against the Serb 
side in Bosnia, the Russian diplomat replied that "no possible 
action can now be ruled out."

  [Text] Colonel General Yevgeniy [as heard] Podkolzin, 
commander of the Russian airborne troops, has spoken in 
extremely negative terms about NATO's decision to carry out air 
raids in Bosnia. 
  The general said that the Russian servicemen see their task 
in this conflict as bringing peace to people, rather than 
resorting to such extreme measures, which are capable of causing 
a military conflagration in the entire Balkan region.

  [Text] Strasbourg, 12 Apr -- We have witnessed force 
becoming the main argument in a political dispute many times. 
But recent examples set by Russia in helping to bring about a 
settlement of the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina have clearly 
demonstrated to the whole world that it is possible to manage 
without using or threatening force in political dialogue. 
  So it is extremely distressing that we have witnessed a 
departure from civilized forms of political dialogue with the 
air strikes by NATO aircraft in the Gorazde region and have 
slipped back into methods of force. Vladimir Podoprigora, 
chairman of the International Affairs Committee of the Russian 
parliament's Federation Council, made these remarks in an 
interview with the ITAR-TASS correspondent. He is in Strasbourg 
as part of an Russian Federation Government delegation which is 
taking part in the work of the latest session here of the 
Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly which unites 32 
European states.

  [Text] At the State Duma sitting on 13 April, Ivan Rybkin, 
chairman of the parliament's lower chamber, read his statement 
regarding the NATO air strikes against Serb positions near the 
Bosnian town of Gorazde. Rybkin said that the State Duma was 
not going to remain an indifferent observer. He demanded that 
NATO should immediately stop its unsanctioned and unilateral use 
of military force and called upon the parliaments of all 
countries to actively participate in developing the process of 
peaceful political settlement of the Yugoslav crisis. 
  The speaker's statement was not enough for the State Duma's 
deputies and they decided to discuss the issue at the plenary 
meeting on 15 April. A relevant proposal was submitted by the 
LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia], PRES [Party of 
Russian Unity and Accord], and Agrarian Party Duma groups.

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: Reports by </F>
Diplomatic Correspondents Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy and 
others] 
  [Text] As INTERFAX has learned from Russia's foreign 
ministry, on Tuesday the UN Security Council will examine the 
situation in former Yugoslavia following NATO's air strikes on 
the Serb positions at Gorazde (Eastern Bosnia). 
  In an interview with INTERFAX, a top Russian diplomat 
forecast a tough talk in New York. 
  In his words, the Russian representative will apparently ask 
why Moscow was informed of the decision to use force in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina post hoc. In terms of politics, such an 
attitude toward Russia as a partner is inadmissible. However, 
in practical terms, not everything is unequivocal, the diplomat 
said. How smart we would be, if information on strikes would 
reach us a few minutes before their delivery, as happened to 
Britons, if media are to be believed. In this case, Russia's 
"no" might be ignored for purely technical reasons: The 
mechanism of a war machine is already in motion. 
  The diplomat stated that Russia is now the only country that 
the Bosnian Serbs agree to deal with. After what happened they 
have abandoned contacts with UN, charging this organization with 
a pro- Moslem slant. Mediation has been conducted by the 
Russian President's Special Envoy, Deputy Foreign Minister 
Vitaliy Churkin. Apparently, his current efforts would be 
unnecessary, if Russia had been told about the decision to 
strike on Bosnian Serbs in advance, he suggested. 
  He regards as extremely unlikely the possibility of NATO's 
further air attacks against Bosnian Serbs without consultations 
with UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force]. Hypothetically, this could 
be the case only if Serbs downed a NATO plane, he said. 
  In his opinion, all three sides -- the Serbs, the Moslems, 
and UNPROFOR need restraint more than anything else. If the 
parties stir further hostilities, the situation may get out of 
control, he said.

  [Text] Belgrade, 12 Apr -- "I will stay in Sarajevo to 
continue the mediation in contacts between representatives of 
the Bosnian sides and the U.N. command and achieve easing of 
tension," special representative of the Russian President 
Vitaliy Churkin, currently in Pale, told ITAR-TASS over the 
telephone today. 
  "Unfortunately, I can give no optimistic forecasts. Despite 
the fact we have managed to ease the situation around Gorazde, 
the general military-political situation in Bosnia is very 
complicated after the air-strikes," he said. 
  "The Serb side refuses to meet representatives of the U.N. 
force command for understandable reasons. I have to make 
shuttle trips between the Serb and Muslim parts of Sarajevo as 
part of my mediation. This is what I have been doing for two 
days, this is what I will do on Wednesday. 
  "There will be more meetings with Radovan Karadzic and the 
U.N. force command. I also keep contact with Serb President 
Milosevic," said Churkin. 
  Asked about the truthfulness of reports saying NATO aircraft 
bombed downtown Gorazde by mistake on Monday, the Russian 
diplomat said "Mr. Karadzic told me about it, however, 
representatives of the U.N. force command deny the information".

  [Text] The central executive committee of the Russian 
Communist Party distributed a statement among the deputies of 
the State Duma Tuesday protesting against NATO's actions in 
Bosnia. 
  "While diplomats of all interested sides are trying to find 
a 
way out of the Balkan crisis, NATO is openly interfering in the 
civil war favoring one of the sides and demonstrating to the 
whole world that the nature of this alliance has not changed," 
the statement stipulated. 
  According to the committee, the bombings of Serb positions 
by 
NATO planes must serve as a warning for those countries which 
welcome Clinton's Partnership for Peace program. 
  The Russian Communist Party appealed to the State Duma and 
the Federation Council to condemn the U.S. and NATO policies 
which bring death and destruction to Bosnia and does not 
contribute to the establishment of peace in this region. 
  The statement also contains an appeal to European 
parliamentarians meeting in Strasbourg this week to call on 
their governments to put an end to NATO's policy of aggression 
and seek the establishment of peace in Bosnia by political means. 
  Russian Communists also demanded that economic and political 
sanctions against Yugoslavia be immediately lifted. 
  In the meantime, the opposition Russian All-People Union 
(RAPU) headed by Sergey Baburin sent a statement to Interfax. 
The document states that Russia must take a firm stand in the 
resolution of the Yugoslav conflict following NATO's bombing 
Serb positions near Gorazde. 
  According to RAPU, Moscow should call a special session of 
the U.N. security Council in the wake of the bombings, which it 
describes as constituing a breach of stability in Europe. 
  The union said it was categorically against any unilateral 
actions in Yugoslavia and for reasonable consideration of the 
interests of Orthodox and Moslem Serbs, with unconditional 
respect of the independence, sovereignty and territorial 
integrity of Yugoslavia and without attempts to thrust a 
decision from outside upon its people. 
  The Society for Russo-Serb Friendship told Interfax that 
activists of the society and a number of national patriotic 
movements and representatives of the Serb community picketed the 
U.S. embassy in Moscow Tuesday protesting against the bombings. 
  The society's secretary, Mikhail Kazmin, pointed out that 
the 
demonstrators harshly condemned the U.S. policy in the Balkans 
which had lead to the escalation of the Yugoslav conflict into a 
large-scale war and had aggravated tensions both in Europe and 
the whole world.

  [Text] Strasbourg April 13 TASS -- "If NATO air strikes in 
the area of Gorazde could help settle the Bosnian crisis, this 
would be the only correct solution," deputy speaker of the the 
Russian Parliament upper chamber Ramazan Abdulatipov who now 
participates, as a member of the Russian parliamentary 
delegation, in a regular session of the Council of Europe 
parliament assembly, said in an interview with ITAR-TASS here on 
Wednesday. 
  "But I know from my own experience that the use of force 
only 
aggravates, as a rule, the state of racial relations and does 
not lead to the solution of a problem," he added. 
  "In my opinion," Abdulatipov stressed, "the true solution of 
the problem is not in Washinton or Moscow, as some people 
believe, but in the land of Croats, Serbs and Moslems. No way 
out of the crisis will be found until they come to agreement 
with each other." 
  He expressed apprehension at the same time that this action 
can be used by chauvinistic forces in Russia to "revive Slavic 
nationalism". "This is not in the interests of Russia. Besides, 
this does not settle the Bosnian problem," Abdulatipov stressed.

  [Text] On Wednesday the Russia's Choice faction in the 
State Duma distributed two statements in which it expresses 
concern due to the situation in the former Yugoslavia and the 
recent incident in one of the units of the Black Sea Fleet in 
Odessa. 
  In particular, the document on the situation in Bosnia and 
the bomb strikes of the Serbian positions in the region of 
Gorazde inflicted by NATO aviation, points out that as a 
permanent member of the UN Security Council Russia "cannot stand 
aside from such responsible decisions and should not associate 
itself with forcible actions which it has not sanctioned." 
  At the same time the faction expressed conviction that there 
cannot be any success without Russia's everyday contribution 
into the settlement process in the former Yugoslavia. "One 
should act resolutely in order to put an end to deaths and 
deprivations of innocent civilians, to violence and terror, to 
any provocations whoever provokes them," the statement reads. 
  The Russia's Choice faction also declared that the incident 
connected with the seizure of the territory of the Black Sea 
Fleet's 318th squadron in Odessa and the arrest of its officers 
and employees by the Ukrainian special purpose forces "can 
aggravate relations between Ukraine and Russia." 
  The indefinite status of the Black Sea Fleet "is fertile 
ground for further dangerous provocations," says the document. 
"We welcome the decision of Russian and Ukrainian presidents to 
resume negotiations on the status of the Black Sea Fleet and 
call on them to force diplomatic efforts in this important 
sphere of bilateral relations," declared the Russia's Choice 
faction.
