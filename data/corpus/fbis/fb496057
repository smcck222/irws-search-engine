  [Text] Baku (April 14) TURAN: Religious Muslims in 
Azerbaijan are demanding the resumption of television 
broadcasting from Iran. 
  The broadcasting of the daily Iranian programme was 
terminated in early March by Azerbaijan Television (AzTV) due to 
"an electrical energy deficit". 
  The head of the Executive Committee of the Islamic Party of 
Azerbaijan, Haji Vagif, condemned this act calling it "a 
treachery against the people". 
  In today's news daily "ISLAM DUNYASI" (Islamic World), Haji 
Vagif, accused national television of serving the interests of 
Zionism. 
  The head of the Azeri Broadcasting Company Babek Guseynoglu 
told Turan that for now AzTV does not intend to resume its 
broadcasting from Tehran. 
  The last agreement on Iranian transmission broadcasting 
programs to Azerbaijan was signed in autumn of last year and a 
simultaneous agreement was signed concerning broadcasting from 
Baku to Iran. However, this agreement has not been implemented.

  [Text] Moscow April 15 TASS -- "The CIS summit, which is 
about to end here, can already be described as successful," 
presidential press secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov told a press 
conference at "President-Hotel" here today. He noted that the 
successful solution of the problem of guarding the external 
borders of the CIS testified to a new understanding of the idea 
of the commonwealth's unity. "It can already be said that we are 
nearing the finishing line. A joint memorandum on the 
participation of CIS members in the protection of the external 
borders in the Central Asian region and also a memorandum on the 
protection of external borders with Ukraine and Belarus has 
already been signed. Corresponding documents are ready to be 
signed." 
  "Thus," Kostikov said, "the system of a single guarded 
border 
is being restored. Moldova is expected to join this memorandum." 
  Asked about Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev's 
initiative to set up a Euro-Asian Union, Kostikov said with 
certainty: "As far as I known, this problem was not raised in 
any of the speeches as it was formulated by the Kazakh 
president." 
  Kostikov said that President Yeltsin rounded off the summit 
meeting by saying: "Let's take upon ourselves as much 
cooperation as it is in the interests of our states."

<F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The present summit introduced several innovations to 
the organizational structure of the CIS. Leaders of CIS 
coordinating bodies -- Vladimir Shumeyko, chairman of the 
Interparliamentary Assembly, Defense Council Chairman Pavel 
Grachev, Andrey Kozyrev, chairman of the Foreign Affairs 
Council, and Andrey Nikolayev, chairman of the Council of 
Commanders of CIS Countries' Border Troops -- took part in its 
work for the first time. A one-year term was set today for the 
rotation of the leaders of the statutory bodies of the CIS. 
This means that Boris Yeltsin and Viktor Chernomyrdin will 
continue to carry out the functions of chairman of the Council 
of Heads of State and chairman of the Council of Heads of 
Government until 31 December 1994. The CIS heads of state also 
approved the symbols -- the flag and emblem -- of the 
Commonwealth of Independent States, viewing this graphic image 
as a powerful and developing tree, a chalice bringing people 
light and warmth, and wings of birds in a single formation. The 
next meeting will, therefore, be held under the sky blue flag of 
the CIS. That meeting is scheduled to take place on 9 
September.

<F P=106> [Pavel Shinkarenko article under the "Commonwealth" rubric: </F>
"CIS Leaders Have Discussed Ways of Deepening Integration"] 
  [Text] The top two CIS councils -- the Council of Heads of 
State and the Council of Heads of Government -- began working in 
parallel yesterday morning at the Grand Kremlin Palace and the 
President Hotel in Moscow. Unlike the previous sessions in 
December, these were held with the active participation of 
delegations from Ukraine and Moldova, which announced their 
desire to affiliate to earlier accords on the Commonwealth. 
There was another innovation -- for the first time Vladimir 
Shumeyko, chairman of the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly, took 
part in this work. 
  Presumably it was the participation of the authorized 
representative of the legislative branch of power which helped 
to free the stranded ship of CIS business ties. 
  The participants in the "premiers' council," chaired by 
Viktor Chernomyrdin, head of the Russian Government, settled all 
20 questions ahead of schedule. In the words of Vladimir 
Mashchits, leader of the Russian Federation Ministry of 
Cooperation [as published], the main achievements of the meeting 
may be considered the institution of a standing body -- the 
Commission of the Economic Union -- under the CIS Coordinating 
Committee and the signing of an agreement on a multilateral 
free-trade zone among Russia and all the other CIS states. "We 
are now transforming these bilateral treaties into multilateral 
ones," the minister stressed. In his opinion, this agreement 
could begin operating in the very near future. "It all depends 
on how long it takes each republic to fulfill all the legal 
requirements," he explained. A significant place among the 
package of documents signed by the premiers is occupied by the 
agreement on the development of production, credit and finance, 
insurance, and mixed transnational associations, which enshrines 
the obligation of the sides to ensure state support for 
cooperation among economic players in the CIS countries 
(regardless of forms of ownership). The draft concept of a 
payments union was also examined and some amendments were made 
to take into account the "distinctive character" of the former 
Soviet republics. Unlike the European interpretation of the 
concept, we are going to view it merely as a system of 
agreements on the reciprocal convertibility of national 
currencies. The document is essentially a program for the 
organization of payment and settlement relations among the CIS 
states with their own national currencies. On the basis of this 
concept a multilateral agreement on a payments union will be 
prepared before the end of the year.

  [Text] Moscow April 15 -- The CIS heads of state adopted a 
statement on the Georgian-Agkhazian conflict and Russia agreed 
to send its peace-keepers to the region where CSCE and UN 
observers will also be staying, Russian President Boris Yeltsin 
told a joint press conference of CIS heads of state on Friday. 
  Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze quoted several points 
from the statement which he thought were fundamentally 
important. Among them he listed an appeal to the UN Security 
Council to urgently decide on carrying out a peacekeeping 
operation in Abkhazia. 
  "If, for some reason, such a decision is not adopted in the 
near future, the CIS countries-parties to common defence treaty, 
are ready to send to the area their own peacekeeping forces upon 
agreement with the two warring sides", Shevardnadze said.

  [Text] Moscow April 15 TASS -- An initiative to create a 
Euro-Asian union put forward by Kazakh President Nursultan 
Nazarbayev has evoked strong interest among journalists. 
However, according to Boris Yeltsin, the idea of the Euro-Asian 
Union was not discussed at the CIS summit on Friday since Kazakh 
President Nursultan Nazarbayev was not present at the session 
because he was unwell and no concrete information on this 
problem was available. 
  According to Kazakh Vice-President Erik Esanbayev [name as 
received], who led the Kazakh delegation to the CIS summit, the 
idea of the formation of the Euro-Asian Union was suggested by 
life itself. "At present, we are watching the response to the 
idea made by politicians and the mass media," Esanbayev said, 
adding that a comprehensive programme for the formation of the 
Euro-Asian Union will be submitted by Kazakhstan at the next CIS 
summit. 
  Chairman of the Tajik Parliament, Emomali Rakhmonov, 
believes 
that the idea of the formation of the Euro-Asian union is a 
"good" one, but "the possibilities of the CIS have not been 
fully used up yet, which was confirmed once again by signatures 
of the Commonwealth presidents put under adopted documents," he 
said. 
  Uzbek President Islam Karimov shares the opinion of the 
Tajik 
parliament chairman, saying that "the idea of the Euro-Asian 
Union does not have any serious foundation whatsoever." He 
pointed that it is necessary to persistently carry through the 
idea of strengthening the CIS, primarily by enhancing economic 
integration and creating an economic union. "Therefore, it 
would not be correct to leave the matter of strengthening the 
CIS half-finished and put forward a new initiative," Karimov 
said. 
  Asked whether agreements reached by heads of the CIS have 
been efficiently fulfilled since the day of the CIS formation, 
Yeltsin said that a decision was adopted on Friday to check 
whether the discipline of carrying out these agreement was 
observed.

<F P=106> [Igor Lenskiy report: "From Economic Union to Eurasian </F>
Union. 15th CIS Heads of State Meeting Held at President Hotel 
Yesterday"] 
  [Text] The main participant in the summit 
was...Kazakhstani President Nursultan Nazarbayev, who did not 
attend it. His idea of setting up a Eurasian union -- which has 
left a big fat question mark over the entire concept of the CIS 
-- was at the center of attention of the heads of state. 
But...behind the scenes and at the press conference. Dodging a 
direct answer to my question, B. Yeltsin said: "Given that 
Nursultan Abishevich was unwell, we were unable to obtain full 
information from him and, therefore, we did not officially 
discuss it." 
  E. Shevardnadze believes that the idea is interesting and 
thought should be given to how to implement it. V. Chernomyrdin 
said that it would be good to know what the Nazarbayev proposals 
consist of. The idea of reintegration was enthusiastically 
received by the leaders of Belorussia [Belarus] and Kirghizia 
[Kyrgyzstan]. Conversely, there was a clearly negative attitude 
from the Turkmen and Uzbek presidents. S. Niyazov, for 
instance, agrees only to consultative Commonwealth status and 
rules out any supranational superstructure. I. Karimov called 
Nazarbayev's scheme incorrect and populist. Reflecting the 
official view, KHALQ SOZI, Uzbekistan's main newspaper, noted on 
the eve of the summit that, "politicians whose repertoire 
consists of songs about the indestructible Union are reminiscent 
of doctors who for some reason hold their meeting in a morgue." 
  Admittedly, there is no need to bury the Union -- which 
lives 
in our hearts and minds. One cannot fail to notice in 
Nazarbayev's idea a basic thought which reflects the sad 
experience of recent years -- any attempts to organize economic 
ties within the CIS will be ineffective if the countries are not 
voluntarily strengthened by political bonds. Without having 
received a clear response to his idea, the Kazakhstani president 
did not come to Moscow (which was to be expected from his 
statements in Japan), clearly believing that further discussions 
on an unprincipled basis would be pointless. 
  The course of the Moscow meeting confirmed Nazarbayev's 
skepticism. There were no sensations. The only more or less 
mature scheme to have emerged in two years of intra-CIS waffle 
-- the economic union -- was confirmed. But let's take a look 
at events through the eyes of the man in the street. Has life 
become any easier? Is there more food in the stores? Have 
prices fallen? Unfortunately, the confusion over the new 
formation (which does not exist in "reality") is profoundly 
abstract in nature. Now that the process has become at least 
slightly systematic the Interstate Economic Committee (IEC) has 
been set up. A Commonwealth flag has appeared -- a sun set 
among many hands on a blue background. 
  The first step to unification may possibly be the creation 
of 
a free trade zone. Unless the agreement remains purely on 
paper, customs duties, taxes, and levies will gradually 
disappear. The Commonwealth countries will be seen as a single 
international economic unit [subyekt]. But there is little 
future for the approved concept for a payments union based on 
diverse national currencies. You will be told that by any 
Ukrainian peasant who sells his food cheaply at Moscow's Kiev 
Station, but for rubles! From now on Ukraine is an associate 
member of the economic union. 
  Among the documents signed we would highlight the concept of 
safeguarding the rights of ethnic, linguistic, and religious 
minorities. The initiative was taken by Kirghiz [Kyrgyz] 
President Askar Akayev, who has sincerely and deeply felt the 
collapse of the great power and has been making a great deal of 
effort to protect ethnic Russians. Russia will not be found 
wanting if it is a question of a united security system, the 
settling of local conflicts within the CIS, or the rebuffing of 
foreign enemies. Colonel-General Valeriy Patrikeyev has been 
appointed the new commander of the collective peacekeeping 
forces in Tajikistan. Colonel-General Boris Pyankov, who has 
honorably done his duty, is returning to Moscow as deputy 
commander of the CIS Joint Armed Forces. 
  Thus, the direction of progress has been chosen -- the 
recreation of the Union, first as an economic union and later as 
a Eurasian union. It will not be easy -- building is not as 
easy as destroying. Many people are convinced that the goal 
will be attained only by the next generation of politicians, who 
have not been besmirched by the shame of the Belovezhskaya 
Forest Agreement.

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: reports by </F>
diplomatic correspondents Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy, and 
others] 
  [Text] The former Soviet republics will not be capable of 
overcoming the situation they are in separately. The way out 
provides for support of the initiative on establishment of a 
Eurasian union put forward by Kazakh President Nursultan 
Nazarbayev. This was suggested by Kazakh Foreign Minister 
Tuleutay Suleymenov in an interview with Interfax. 
  Suleymenov clarified that the Kazakh president's proposal 
meant that the economy must finally prevail over the politics. 
"The CIS in its present framework does not work. Its documents 
(there are already more than 400 of them adopted) are not 
carried out. If two, three or four states interested in a close 
cooperation join the Eurasian union, it will work," Suleymenov 
suggested. 
  He said many people were worrying that establishment of 
over-national organizational structures might violate the 
sovereignty. "However, Kazakhstan is not afraid of this. That 
is why President Nazarbayev has put forward this initiative," he 
added. 
  Suleymenov is certain that the CIS states will back the 
Kazakh initiative in the near future "some earlier, some later." 
"Definite mechanisms of interaction do exist. There is no use 
to reinvent the wheel. For instance, there is the European 
Union [EU] is it not an example which should be followed? This 
is a single customs and economic space with inter-state banks 
and mutual settlement. By the way, the sharp issue on dual 
citizenship would be resolved." One would be able to change the 
citizenship freely, Suleymenov stressed. 
  Suleymenov believes that there is no reasonable alternative 
to the Eurasian union. "We need each other. Even now our 
former Soviet republics are more integrated with each other than 
the EU states. We must unite. We have separated in order to 
reunite on a new basis," Suleymenov suggested. 
  On the convention on human rights for ethnic minorities 
submitted for additional work on it, Suleymenov emphasized its 
importance and necessity for Kazakhstan. 
  "The draft convention was considered by the Council of 
Foreign Ministers for the third time already. We have 
repeatedly put forward our proposals and recommendations. 
Unfortunately, experts do not always take into consideration 
the recommendations of all the CIS states. That is why 
documents turn out to be incomplete. This happened once again," 
Suleymenov said. 
  He announced that the CIS foreign ministers had agreed to 
reconsider the convention in mid-May in order to discuss it once 
again and to submit it for approval by the heads of state. "We 
would like this document to work in favor not only of Kazakhstan 
but also in favor of the whole CIS. It concerns our burning 
issues. That is why the convention must be brought to conformity 
with the national legislation of all the CIS states," Suleymenov 
pointed out. 
  He stressed that Kazakhstan was also very interested in 
another document - the declaration on sovereignty, territorial 
integrity and inviolability of the CIS states' borders. "These 
issues are of great importance for us now. We are satisfied 
with the adoption of this document," Suleymenov stressed.

  [Text] Azeri President Geydar Aliyev said here tonight he 
plans further dialogue with Armenian leader Levon Ter-Petrosyan 
but made no comments on the report claiming his meeting with 
Ter-Petrosyan in Moscow on April 16. 
  He said today's meeting with Russian President Boris Yeltsin 
focused on the search for possibilities of cease-fire and 
negotiations. 
  The Azeri demands are not excessive, said the Azeri leader. 
They include cease-fire in the conflict zone, liberation of the 
occupied Azeri lands and negotiations to discuss the status of 
Nagorno-Karabakh. 
  Aliyev is convinced that the two peoples are ready for 
cease-fire. He stressed he "has a reliable information that the 
absolute majority of Karabakh Armenians do not want to fight, 
they are forced to do it, to involve in the senseless war". 
  The bloodshed must be stopped as soon as possible to 
terminate sufferings of Azeri and Armenian mothers, and the 
Armenian and Azeri presidents must agree on this, said Aliyev. 
  He stressed he is basically not against contacts with 
Armenian representatives of Nagorno-Karabakh, however, being the 
Azeri president, do not plan to have equal negotiations with 
citizens of the state he heads.

  [Text] CIS heads of state signed a final package of 
documents at their meeting in Moscow today. Its basis is a bloc 
of economic agreements: on Ukraine's joining the economic union 
as an associate member; on creating an economic union 
commission; and on forming a free trade zone. In addition, a 
declaration was approved on the observance of sovereignty, 
territorial integrity, and the inviolability of Commonwealth 
borders. 
  In an interview with our correspondent, President of 
Kirghizia [Kyrgyzstan] Askar Akayev expressed satisfaction with 
today's meeting between heads of state. In his view, the 
meeting fulfilled its main task. 
  [Begin Akayev recording] First, it is the creation of a 
permanently functioning committee. Or rather, the heads of 
government introduced such an amendment--an economic commission 
that will be located in Moscow and will monitor the 
implementation of adopted agreements on trade and economic 
cooperation. CIS bodies are at last appearing that could 
develop in the future into an effective mechanism for 
implementing agreements. [end recording] 
  Despite the fact that Kazakh President Nursultan 
Nazarbayev's 
proposal to set up a Eurasian union was not examined today, 
Akayev said that he wholly supports this idea. 
  [Begin Akayev recording] I see it as the foreseeable future 
of our CIS. If the mechanisms for cooperation laid down by the 
CIS are implemented to a significant extent, we will arrive at a 
Eurasian union. [end recording] 
  For his part, Boris Yeltsin made special note of the 
agreement signed in Moscow today on extending the term for CIS 
peacekeeping forces in Tajikistan, and also the joint statements 
on the situation in Abkhazia and Nagornyy Karabakh 
[Nagorno-Karabakh]. The next session of heads of state will 
take place on 9 September.

  [Text] Tallinn, Apr 15, BNS -- The overwhelming majority 
of the world's most influential countries at a CSCE session in 
Vienna on Apr. 14 made it clear that Russian troops must leave 
Estonia and Latvia by Aug. 31, 1994, the Estonian Foreign 
Ministry press office says. 
  Support for the Baltics' demand was expressed by the 
representatives of the European Union, the United States, the 
Nordic countries and countries of Central Europe. They also 
underscored that Russia had to abide by the commitments she had 
taken at international level, and that setting additional 
conditions for pulling out troops was unacceptable under the 
international law. 
  The CSCE meeting also criticized the Apr. 5 decree by 
Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin on establishing military bases in the 
CIS and Latvia. A demand was voiced that Yeltsin revoke the 
document. 
  Russia has announced that mentioning Latvia in the document 
was an oversight, which by now has been corrected, and that no 
military bases are to be set up in that Baltic country. Russia 
has also defined the radar station to remain under its control 
for a few more years in Skrunda, Latvia, as a civilian facility. 
  The issue of Russian troop withdrawal was raised at the 
meeting by Estonia, who also brought to the meeting's attention 
the results of its 18th round of bilateral talks with Russia, 
having passed with no progress. 
  Russian representatives in Vienna answered by quoting the 
position that Russia has stuck to at the latest rounds of talks 
with Estonia, the Foreign Ministry press office says. Moscow 
demands that Estonia granted permanent residence permits 
unconditionally to all retired Russian military and their family 
members in Estonia, and paid 23 million USD to build houses for 
the repatriated officers. 
  The Russian delegation declined to comment on the Apr. 5 
decree of President Yeltsin.

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow April 16 TASS -- NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA 
(independent newspaper) on the CIS summit: 
  "The economic integration of CIS member-countries proceeds 
perhaps more successfully than the resolution of many regional 
conflicts. The fact that the bulk of the package of issues 
considered dealt with the situation in the Republic of 
Tajikistan and the Transcaucasus shows that the Russian 
Federation tries to apply all CIS instruments to somehow secure 
the powers of its troops at flashpoints and share responsibility 
with ex-Soviet republics". 
  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI believes that "one can view as the main 
achievements of the summit the establishment of a permanently 
functioning agency -- a commission for economic union affairs -- 
at the CIS coordinating consultative committee and the signing 
of an agreement between Russia and all the CIS countries on a 
multi-sided free trade area". 
  Referring to remarks by Vladimir Mashits, Russian minister 
for cooperation, the newspaper points out: "The implementation 
of this agreement may begin soon". 
  PRAVDA on the CIS summit outcome: 
  "There were no sensations. The only more or less mature 
undertaking -- the establishment of an economic union underwent 
development. The establishment of a free trade area will 
possibly become the first step towards reunification. 
  "Thus, the vector of the movement has been chosen: to 
recreate the union, an economic one at first, and subsequently a 
Euro-Asian one." 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (Red Star) carries an interview with Yuriy 
Meshkov, the first-ever president of the Republic of the Crimea. 
  In response to a question about the Crimean president's view 
of the future of the Black Sea Fleet and its status, Meshkov 
said: "The fleet should be Russian, since Ukraine is not in a 
position to maintain it... I think the Black Sea Fleet has been 
and remains the guarantor of stability in the Crimea and an 
important element of the balance of forces in the south European 
region." 
  TRUD on the birth centenary of former Soviet leader Nikita 
Khrushchov: 
  "The transformation era of Khrushchov days created a culture 
medium which brought forth people who arrived at conclusions 
about the essence of administrative socialism, its historical 
prospectlessness and the need to wind up the experiment on its 
basis and launch a quest for new principles for the life of 
millions of people". 
  RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA on Khrushchov's birth centenary: 
  "Thousands of innocent people who were subjected to 
repressions are grateful to Khrushchov for the regained freedom 
and rehabilitation. 
  "And still, under Khrushchov, we began to be dependent on 
overseas bread. Prices began to move upwards, and haphazard 
reorganisations were launched. In such affairs, associates 
recede into the background, leaving the leader confronted with 
the social discontent." 
  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA carries an article the writer of which 
points out that, to his mind, there is still the need for a 
long, thorough and impartial analysis of everything that was 
done by Nikita Khrushchov, one of the most distinctive and 
complex politicians of the 20th century".

  [Text] Moscow April 17 ITAR-TASS -- Russian independent 
television's Sunday analytical programme Itogi opened its last 
issue with a series of reports about the abrupt aggravation of 
Russian-Ukrainian relations caused by the occupation by 
Ukrainian commandos of some Black Sea Fleet targets. 
  The incident was eventually settled and the presidents of 
the 
two countries, Boris Yeltsin and Leonid Kravchuk, reached an 
agreement on Black Sea Fleet. The agreement evoked 
"interpretations which differed in principle", the Itogi host 
said. 
  According to Ukrainian Defence Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy, 
the agreement reached is evidence that "Russia acknowledged that 
the Russian Federation and Ukraine are equal partners." 
  Black Sea Fleet Commander Admiral Eduard Baltin said in an 
interview that "up to date Ukraine owes the Black Sea Fleet more 
than 17 billion roubles", which is a clear sign that Ukraine is 
"trying to live on somebody else's account." Speaking about last 
week's events, the admiral said they reflect the intention "to 
cover up the present economic situation with political 
ambitions". 
  The unification of the monetary systems of Russia and 
Belarus, the agreement on which was signed last week, has evoked 
mixed reaction in both countries, the Itogi host said. 
  According to Yegor Gaydar, the leader of Russia's Choice, 
"this is a purely political decision, and the economy was 
sacrificed to politics". 
  State Duma Deputy Sergey Glazyev said "the unification of 
the 
monetary systems must be followed by a transition to a customs 
union and further integration". 
  Yabloko coalition Leader Grigoriy Yavlinskiy said there can 
be no "clear-cut response to the agreement signed because its 
specifics are not known". 
  Public opinion poll conducted on order from Itogi revealed 
that 36 per cent of those polled favoured the unification of the 
monetary systems of the two republics, while 41 per cent said it 
should not be done. 
  "If the reached accord eventually strengthens inflation in 
Russia, the government will be in for much trouble," Itogi 
concluded. 
  As concerns Belarus [Byelorussia], its former leader 
Stanislav Shushkevich, who has already joined the race for 
presidency in the republic, criticised the agreement, stressing 
that it makes no mention "of the Chernobyl catastrophe, which 
claims 15 per cent of all budget allocations in the republic 
every year". 
  Itogi announced that the Commonwealth summit, which ended in 
Moscow, adopted a number of documents, mainly recommendations, 
which have no direct effect. According to Boris Yeltsin, who 
spoke at the closing press conference, "the CIS is not a rigid 
factory management". 
  As concerns decisions in the military field, Itogi noted 
that 
"judging by all appearances, Russia will have to shoulder the 
main burden". "The bulk of the tasks has fallen to the share of 
Russia," Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev said. 
  Both Itogi and Voskresenye reported on the centenary of 
Nikita Khrushchev and stressed the contradictory and 
extraordinary character of his activity. 
  A public opinion survey ordered by Itogi, revealed that 37 
per cent of those polled recall Khrushchev's role in exposing 
the cult of the personality (37 per cent), the large-scale 
cultivation of maize (24 per cent), country-wide housing 
construction (24 per cent), as well as with the launch of the 
first artificial Earth satellite, the first manned flight into 
space, the development of the virgin lands and the Caribbean 
crisis. 
  The second part of the programme was devoted to 
international 
affairs, and opened with a report on Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin's "strange" visit to Spain, which Itogi described as "a 
test of the Russian president's ability to run the state." 
  "Everybody noted that the president was in good shape," the 
Itogi host stressed. 
  Itogi highlighted the aggravation of the situation near 
Gorazde, where the NATO aviation shelled Serb targets. Russian 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said in an exclusive interview 
with Itogi that the new initiative proposed by him in Yugoslavia 
calls for the unblocking of Gorazde and work towards an 
agreement on an end to military activities along the entire 
frontline. 
  The minister, who was just back in Moscow from a trip to 
Serbia on President Yeltsin's instructions, said "the 
realisation of these measures will create a favourable situation 
for the resumption of the negotiations on the political 
settlement". 
  Andrey Kozyrev also said that every step taken by the Serb 
side will be accompanied, for our part, "by a resolute raising 
of the question about the lifting of the sanctions". He 
stressed that "such a consistent progress is a must". "I think 
Russia has remained the only strong player on this arena, who 
has not marred its reputation with irresponsible actions," the 
minister said. 
  He reported that Russia has been informed by the West about 
the latest developments around Gorazde. As a result of 
consultations, we succeeded in convincing them that one should 
not make haste this time around," Kozyrev said. "It is necessary 
to consult Russia, we must act in concert", Kozyrev stressed.

general has reopened the so-called Rutskoy trust case, in 
connection with the incompleteness of the investigation 
conducted earlier. Among other things, Rutskoy, the notary who 
verified the documents, and other persons were not questioned on 
all the circumstances of the trust agreement. Furthermore, a 
number of expert investigations need to be carried out, 
including one into the trust agreement itself.

  [Text] Russian ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovskiy has 
criticized Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev's proposal 
for a Eurasian Union. Addressing a congress of the Union of 
Officers on Saturday, Zhirinovskiy warned about "the danger for 
those who are in favor of the restoration of the Soviet Union if 
they support the initiative of President Nursultan Nazarbayev." 
A community of states "with the same people -- Nazarbayev 
(Uzbekistan President Islam) Karimov, (Georgian leader Eduard) 
Shevardnadze, (Moldovan President Mircea) Snegur, and others - 
staying in their offices would be the worst that could happen," 
"a trap for many years, from which it would be difficult to 
break out," he said. 
  A "single union state" should be based on the territorial 
unification of the former Soviet republics, the merger of their 
armed forces, security services and financial systems, and 
uniform citizenship, Zhirinovskiy said. Meanwhile, "Russians 
living in regions where temporarily somebody else's flag is 
flying, have the right to self-determination," he said.

<F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>
  [Text] A news conference by the leader of the Liberal 
Democratic Party faction was held on the results of the Council 
of Europe session, at which Vladimir Zhirinovskiy sharply 
opposed the possible signing by Russia of NATO's Partnership for 
Peace program. 
  [Begin Zhirinovskiy recording] I am glad that our country's 
political leadership has made a correct step in this regard. 
For the first time in the four months since the State Duma' 
started working, we can react positively to President Yeltsin's 
steps on his refusal to go to Brussels to sign the document 
which is called the Partnership for Peace program. Lovely words 
-- Partnership for Peace -- anyone would think, but in fact it 
is an ideological trap. The more paper we sign, the more 
European and international structures we climb aboard, the more 
we will be taken by the throat and forced to implement documents 
they create. [end recording] 
  [Kuznetsova] There was a short silence and then Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy tackled the Serbian question. 
  [Begin Zhirinovskiy recording] I am fully on the side of the 
Serbs. The Serbs are victims of aggression. What is happening 
in the Balkans today is a scenario for the gradual annihilation 
of Russia. The Americans are (?trying it out) on a small 
region. Just like the Russians in Russia -- the former USSR -- 
so it is with the Serbs in Yugoslavia. [end recording] 
  [Kuznetsova] A statement was made that henceforth the party 
will use the title Zhirinovskiy's Party, since Boris Fedorov, 
the leader of a new political formation, called it the Liberal 
Democratic Union of 12 December.

  [Excerpt] In the break between budget discussions, the LDPR 
[Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] leader decided to tell the 
media about his visit to Strasbourg as part of the Russian 
parliamentary delegation. In [Vladimir] Zhirinovskiy's words, 
it was difficult to work there because the French authorities 
limited his itinerary to three points: Charles de Gaulle 
airport, Strasbourg airport, and the city of Strasbourg. 
  [Begin Zhirinovskiy recording] They could have just shown me 
the toilet and told me where to piss, and where I should eat, 
and where I should sleep. That is all that remained to be 
shown. Otherwise, I might use the wrong toilet. [end recording] 
  Another example of Western inhospitality was the fact that 
the French do not speak Russian, which Zhirinovskiy considers 
essential even a long way from Russia. 
  [Begin Zhirinovskiy recording] It is only us Russians that 
mostly have to talk to them in their own languages. I spoke 
French, but I preferred to talk to them in Russian. All the 
more so because you cannot swear in another language. When they 
really made me angry, I found it easier to speak Russian, 
because you just cannot say it in French -- especially when 
those Jews attacked me at the consulate. Well, what can you say 
in French? All the words are so soft and nice. [end recording] 
  Zhirinovskiy said at the news conference that Russia should 
under no circumstances join the Council of Europe, which wants 
to make war on us using our own money. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Yevgeniy Skukin account of interviews with Vasiliy </F>
Lipitskiy, chairman of the People's Party of Free Russia; 
Vladimir Lysenko, cochairman of the Republican Party of the 
Russian Federation; and Viktor Ilyukhin, representative of State 
Duma communist faction; place and date not given: "We Are 
Discussing the Draft Agreement on Civil Accord"] 
  [Text] Stabilization Means a Change of Policy 
  Vasiliy Lipitskiy, State Duma deputy and chairman of the 
People's Party of Free Russia: The worrying thing about this 
voluminous document is that, despite the general nature of its 
wording, it contains harsh sanctions for violations, the 
majority of which can be interpreted liberally, like, for 
example, "destabilizing the situation within society." 
  At the same time the agreement allows the application of 
sanctions up to and including the dismissal and removal of a 
deputy from his seat. I consider that the agreement may become 
a cause for limiting political freedom, and this cannot be 
allowed. 
  One more point. In order to achieve accord there should be 
policy changes. 
<H5>  Agreements Must Be Implemented </H5>
  Vladimir Lysenko, State Duma deputy, chairman of the 
subcommittee for developing federal relations, and cochairman of 
the Republican Party of the Russian Federation: The way I 
regard the draft is complex, as the president has already signed 
various documents of this type on many occasions, but not one of 
them has played a significant role as they were subsequently 
violated. What is more they were not violated by political 
forces but by the president. For example, an agreement was 
concluded with 15 parties in 1991 which subsequently faded into 
oblivion. So you cannot really rely on the agreement being 
equal at the moment. But the draft does contain positive 
elements. For example, with regard to a moratorium on changing 
a Federation component's status and the borders between 
Federation components. 
<H5>  We Are Ready To Present Our Own Solutions </H5>
  Viktor Ilyukhin, chairman of the State Duma Security 
Committee and representative of the communist faction: An 
accord is possible if several of our demands are met. First, if 
there is a change in the direction of the Russian reforms. It 
is not possible to reconcile oneself to the masses becoming 
impoverished. As the government is not putting forward any ways 
of extricating ourselves from the crisis, we will present our 
own solutions. 
  Second, the team which has brought the country to collapse 
has still not been changed to this day. 
  Third, we consider that the authorities should undertake 
never to use the Army for punitive purposes against the people.

  [Text] The leader of the Russian Communist Party Gennadiy 
Zyuganov, a Duma member, doubts that a civic peace accord will 
be signed on April 28, the signing date set by President 
Yeltsin. He declared in an interview with Interfax on Saturday 
that many lawmakers would not sign the document offered by the 
auditing group. The draft consists of three warnings, 
unacceptable for many: do not touch, as Zyuganov put it, those 
who are in power and those who led the country to this state, do 
not touch the constitution, pulled through by one third of the 
votes, and forget everything that happened in Moscow on October 
3-4. 
  In return, he said, we are promised not to be insulted, but 
the opposition is not guaranteed the possibility of using media, 
above all television. This is a straight jacket rather than 
terms, Zyuganov believes. 
  In his words, the communist faction in the Duma has 
formulated basic terms conditions for civic concord and is ready 
to submit them early next week. These terms include a demand to 
change the economic course, leading to a social disaster. 
  The communists also insist on forming a national trust 
government, comprising representatives of the various political 
forces that won the elections on December 12. The current 
government, Zyuganov said, was formed by one force - first by 
Russia's Choice and then somewhat expanded at the expense of 
Unity and Concord Party, which is represented in the cabinet by 
Deputy Premiers Sergey Shakhray and Aleksandr Shokhin. 
  Besides, as Zyuganov argues, the document must spell out 
urgent measures to curb the crime, index pensions, compensate 
for depreciated bank savings, and pay wages.

  [Text] The Working Russia movement will "do everything to 
prevent provocations on May 1" (by the authorities - IF's 
note), the leader of the movement and the Russian Communist 
Workers' Party, Viktor Anpilov, told a news conference in Moscow 
Friday. Anpilov said he feared that exercises by the Moscow OMON 
(special purpose police units) held a few days ago were 
connected with the coming May rallies organized by the 
opposition. In Anpilov's opinion, President Yeltsin is "morally 
interested in finally removing the issue of early presidential 
elections" in June 1994 and "needs to provoke disorders, any 
conflict on the streets of Moscow," in order to be able to blame 
the opposition. 
  Anpilov said he was ready to discuss all aspects of the May 
1 
march with the Moscow authorities. The organizers of the march 
intend to start from Kaluzhskaya (formerly Oktyabrskaya) square 
at 11:00 via Yakimanka (formerly Dimitrova street), Bolshoy 
Kamenny Bridge, the Kremlin Embankment to Vasiliyevskiy Spusk 
where a festive concert is planned to be held. 
  If the Moscow authorities do not permit this route, the 
organizers of the march will propose another one, from the 
Kaluzhskaya square to the viewing site on the Vorobiyovy (Lenin) 
Hills along Leninskiy Prospekt, Anpilov said. 
  When the demonstrators disobeyed to the Moscow authorities 
in 
May 1 1993 and moved along this very route, they clashed with 
regular and special purpose police units. As a result of 
clashes, one policeman was killed, while dozens of people were 
injured. A criminal case was filed following the incident, but 
the State Duma's decision of February 23 1994 declared an 
amnesty for all participants. 
  According to Anpilov, this time up to 100,000 people will 
attend to the demonstration. He told Interfax that Working 
Russia had formed an unarmed squad of its supporters to maintain 
order. No less than 300 members of this squad will stand by, 
while another thousand will be dispersed among the 
demonstrators. The May 1 rally will be carried out under the 
slogans "All Power To Workers!" and "No To The Colonization Of 
Russia!" 
  In Anpilov's opinion, the May 1 rallies which will be held 
in 
all cities will be a rehearsal for a general political strike in 
Russia. He believes that only wide workers movement is capable 
of changing the political and economic course within the 
framework of the Constitution. However, Anpilov declined to 
indicate any possible dates of the general political strike.

<F P=106> [Report by Irina Savvateyeva: "`Decembrists' Now Have </F>
Political Platform and Boris Fedorov Has His Own Draft Law"] 
  [Text] Yesterday the "12 December" parliamentary group 
published its political platform signed by all 26 "Decembrists." 
The group will now be called the "12 December" 
Liberal-Democratic Union. 
  The "Decembrists'" political platform is based on two 
fundamental principles: loyalty to liberal-democratic values 
and a "healthy" conservatism. As we know, the group's leader, 
Boris Fedorov, had previously opposed "the political extremism 
of some democrats." In the document on offer the idea of 
conservatism is reflected in the interpretation of individual 
elements of social policy (the conservation of the system of 
free state health care with the gradual development of 
compulsory medical insurance; the recognition as valid of all 
awards of the USSR and the retention of their benefits by heroes 
of the Soviet Union and holders of the orders of Glory) and in 
the view of global questions of statehood. The "Decembrists" 
proclaim loyalty to the conservation of the Russian state's 
unity, putting forward the following slogans: "No to 
self-determination, yes to self-management," "no to a 
single-channel tax system," and "we are for unity of status, 
equal rights and powers for all components of the federation." 
The thesis of the defense of the Russian-speaking population's 
rights outside Russia "by all means accessible to the state" has 
been put forward. 
  The "Decembrists" are by no means put out by the fact that 
there is already one liberal-democratic party in Russia. They 
insist that they are the true liberals and democrats since they 
consistently defend the principle of the freedom of the 
individual and a strong state as a guarantee of the individual's 
prosperous existence. 
  The main thesis of the economic platform is: "We are in 
favor of a firm ruble. Inflation in 1994 should be reduced to 
1-3 percent a month." In addition the "Decembrists" advocate 
financial discipline, are opposed to the issue of all kinds of 
benefits, and favor a realistic budget, "a one-off reduction of 
taxes by 15-25 percent to encourage business activity with the 
simultaneous reduction of state expenditure, and a reduction in 
the amount and types of taxation." 
  Social policy, the "12 December" group members believe, 
should be built on the intensification of targeted support for 
poor strata of the population. 
  As for big-league politics, the attitude toward political 
parties and movements is outlined as follows. "Russia's Choice" 
and "Yabloko" are "potential allies." But "we are in favor of 
greater pragmatism and a less politicized approach." The 
Liberal-Democratic Party -- its leadership is "shaming Russia" 
and its name "does not reflect the essence of that leadership's 
activity." We are in favor of cooperation with "Women of 
Russia." We are in favor of collaboration with the Party of 
Russian Unity and Accord. But only with individual "members 
close to us in their views." Here it is stipulated that "the 
position of part of that party's leadership contradicts Russia's 
interests and does not promote the attainment of civil accord." 
  In an exclusive interview with IZVESTIYA, Boris Fedorov 
specified that it is primarily the national-state policy of that 
"part of the leadership" which the "Decembrists" do not like. 
Obviously the group disagrees with that part (and they 
undoubtedly have Sergey Shakhray in mind) also on the question 
of the political amnesty, which is sharply denounced in the 
document. 
  As for the Communists, "we will not accept the majority of 
their ideological dogmas" but "we see among them sensible people 
with whom we can cooperate on specific programs." The 
"Decembrists" see the Agrarian Party members as potential allies 
although they "do not agree with their present approaches toward 
economic policy." 
  The document also outlines the attitude toward the 
government: "We are not in the opposition." But only "as long 
as there is a chance of the government continuing constitutional 
transformations." The idea is also expressed of supporting a 
coalition government if "the coalition is based on consistent 
market reforms and loyalty to democratic principles and the 
principles of a social state." 
  The "Decembrists" oppose early presidential elections. 
  Commenting for IZVESTIYA on the aims of the publication of 
the political platform, Boris Fedorov noted that the main thing 
"is to agree within the Duma." But he did not rule out the 
possibility that in the future the proposed theses could become 
the basis for the political platform of the "Decembrists'" 
party. But that is obviously a question for the quite remote 
future: At a press conference devoted to the platform's adoption 
both Fedorov and Khakamada stated resolutely that they will not 
set the tasks of creating a party in the immediate future. But 
work will nonetheless be conducted in the regions, for the 
members of the union represent the most diverse territories. 
  "This is not another Moscow elite get-together at which only 
his staffers stand behind the leader," Boris Fedorov stated. 
  At the same time observers note that if you combine 
Fedorov's 
prestige and "Mrs. Khakamada's ability to earth up people" the 
party could be successful. 
  It is true that its electorate remains a serious question 
for 
the future party. The problem is that it coincides very much 
with the electorate of Gaydar's party. Fedorov himself has said 
on this subject that anyone who wants to come to us can come. 
This must be understood as meaning good riddance to anyone who 
does not want to. 
  At the press conference convened yesterday to present the 
"Decembrists'" political platform the group's leader also 
sharply denounced the Russian Government's signing of the 
agreement on the unification of the Russian and Belarusian 
monetary systems. 
  And to ensure that in the future the authorities have no 
opportunity for making decisions so easily on the unification of 
monetary systems or of conducting monetary reforms, Boris 
Fedorov suggests adopting a new law on the Central Bank which he 
has written. The main difference between this version of the 
law and the current one is that Fedorov himself believes it 
leaves less room for voluntarist actions by the Central Bank 
leadership. And a dual-level system is proposed for the bank's 
management -- trough the council of directors and an observation 
council -- which in the author's opinion will block the adoption 
of pointless, unconsidered decisions.

<F P=106> [Video report by correspondent Sladkov, including recorded </F>
comment by Stanislav Terekhov, chairman of the Officers' Union; 
from the "Vesti" newscast] 
  [Text] [Sladkov] The Russian Power Party [Rossiyskaya 
Derzhavnaya Partiya] is the name of the new political party that 
today held the second stage of its founding conference in Moscow 
Oblast. The most active sections of the Officers' Union, the 
National Salvation Front, and of other small patriotic groupings 
were the initiators for creating the party. 
  [Terekhov] We are beginning to work differently from the 
image of being extremists both in the streets and at meetings by 
which the people had known us. We are going to defend our 
stance in a serious way not by shouting in the streets but by 
our deeds. 
  [Sladkov] According to Stanislav Terekhov, from now on the 
patriots will start nominating their candidates to all levels of 
state power as the continuation of the struggle to bring to 
power the people to whom the interests of the country are above 
everything else. Incidently, every leader always talks about 
his love for his motherland and if that leader is the supreme 
leader of the country he should be a professional.

<F P=106> [Reprint of undated letter from A.A. Kotenev, chairman of </F>
the Russian Afghanistan Veterans Council Board: "Calling Afghan 
War Veterans"] 
  [Text] This document, bearing an Afghanistan Veterans' 
Union [AVU] letterhead and marked "For Official Use Only," was 
distributed to the heads of the organization's regional 
branches. There is barely any need for comment. It is easy to 
see what is going on: They are trying to involve Aghanistan war 
veterans in dangerous games on the side of political forces 
yearning for power at any price. 
  [Letter begins] In connection with the rapidly changing 
sociopolitical situation as a result of the process of the 
redistribution of material wealth among the major financial and 
industrial groups, which have already found it necessary to 
express their own interests in the political sphere and have 
joined in the active power struggle in the country, the AVU 
Board is proposing that all regional branches carry out the 
following measures: 
  1. At the end of each month, beginning this April, republic, 
kray, and oblast leaders will report in writing to the AVU Board 
on the sociopolitical situation in their particular region, the 
presence of political and public organizations, and their 
orientation, plans, influence on the masses, and contacts with 
our movement. 
  2. In the first report, which we expect by 30 April, we ask 
you to indicate: 
  -- the precise addresses and telephone numbers of AVU 
branches, beginning with rayon and settlement components, and 
also the full names of leaders; 
  -- if any administration leaders in your region are 
Afghanistan war veterans, whether you have contacts with them 
(if there are no contacts and mutual understanding, find out the 
reasons and try to get these people on your side); 
  -- whether there are members of the "Russia's Choice" 
movement in the region, what posts they occupy, and whether you 
are seeking a mutual understanding with them; 
  -- the general mood of the population, its political 
orientation, and the attitude toward local and central authority 
and our movement; 
  -- whether you have contacts with the local media and at 
what level. If such contacts do not exist, they should be 
established immediately and a campaign must begin to 
propagandize the AVU and its ideas. What newspapers are 
published in your area, their orientation, addresses, and 
telephone nunmbers and the full names of the chief editors; 
  -- what work is being done in your area on local 
self-government elections, if any AVU member has been elected 
deputy, and whether or not he has severed links with the 
organization; 
  -- report on the presence of youth and military-patriotic 
clubs and other associations in your region and what influence 
you have on them. Resume work immediately in that sphere if you 
have neglected to do so; 
  -- tell us your proposals on the possibility of a united 
effort at the future presidential elections. 
  We ask you to treat this letter as seriously and responsibly 
as possible. Remember that you have saved the homeland from 
civil war chaos on two occasions already. You have supported 
the course of reforms and the institution of president, as 
guarantor of stability, and the form of political organization 
in Russia and who will head it will soon depend on us. 
  We can also report that we are currently making joint 
preparations with "Russia's Choice" for a founding congress of a 
new political party. 
  [signed] A.A. Kotenev, chairman of the Russian Afghanistan 
Veterans Council Board.

<F P=106> [Sergey Turchenko report: "Thefts and Borders. Russia's </F>
National Wealth Is Leaving for the West by Train"] 
  [Text] The "democrats'" apocalyptic regime has scored a 
great number of specific achievements -- from the total collapse 
of industry to the mass closure of maternity homes and 
kindergartens as being not wanted. But one of the "victories" 
most worthy of this power is probably the unprecedented 
flowering of crime in its particularly wild manifestations. 
Precisely 2,799,714 registered crimes -- this is the record 
figure for 1993. 
  There is also at first glance a more modest but essentially 
terrible figure. Last year 9,477 crimes associated with the 
misappropriation of raw materials and strategic materials, which 
are being exported on a vast scale to the West, which applauds 
the anti-Russian reforms, were brought to light. This is not 
just robbery. Having stripped the shirt off the back of the 
present generation of Soviet people, the pro-Western regime has 
organized the total robbing of our children, grandchildren, and 
all subsequent descendants by sending the country's natural 
riches abroad. 
  The process of misappropriating strategic materials has 
reached such a terrifying scale that indistinct, albeit somewhat 
timid, grumbling has begun even in Yerin's department. Some 
facts and figures were divulged at a recent meeting of 
journalists with leaders of administrations of the Russian 
Federation MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs]. Last year the 
illegal export of 17,800 tonnes of metals, 97,900 tonnes of 
petroleum products, and 157,400 cubic meters of timber worth a 
total of more than 18 billion rubles was prevented. This is 
just the tip of the iceberg. It is difficult even to imagine 
what quantity of strategic materials nonetheless went to the 
West. 
  Militia Major General Vyacheslav Saltaganov, chief of the 
Russian Federation MVD Main Administration for Economic Crimes, 
cited the following data. All sorts of output and strategic 
materials worth 10.6 billion francs arrived in France alone from 
CIS countries during seven months of last year. And yet this is 
not the country with the biggest penchant for Russian riches. 
There are far more greedy countries. 
  Whose hands are plundering our country? In Saltaganov's 
opinion, commercial structures, primarily joint ventures, are 
the chief active force here. They issue orders for thefts of 
strategic raw materials and then resell them to nearby and 
distant foreign countries. 
  "During the two years since the breakup of the USSR," 
Mikhail 
Vanin, chief of the Administration for Combatting Smuggling and 
Violations of Customs Regulations, said, "this problem has 
passed a critical point. Stable groups of smugglers, who 
control the process of the extraction and production of 
strategic materials and export them, have been formed all over 
the country. They have set up ramified structures in 
enterprises and export groups, and there are 'windows' on the 
borders.... 
  "In the USSR there was a state monopoly on foreign trade," 
he 
blurted out in a temper, "and so the confusion that exists now 
did not exist then!" 
  But why do the MVD and the State Customs Committee keep 
quiet 
about this and not strive for a normal state approach to 
protecting our national riches from plundering? Vladimir 
Vorozhtsov, chief of the Russian Federation MVD Public Relations 
Center, made things clear: 
  "If we were to raise this question, we would at once be 
called antimarketeers and opponents of reforms!" 
  Well, well! It turns out that MVD officials are perfectly 
well aware of who is pilfering our riches, why, and for whom. 
They are also aware that, within the framework of the present 
regime, not only is it impossible to secure a state monopoly of 
foreign trade, but it is also dangerous to personal well-being 
to speak aloud about this. 
  It only remains to add that the "democratic" power is 
programmed to work for the West and in the interests of the 
West. While this regime lords it in Russia, the strategic 
plundering of Russia will only increase.

  [Text] Mikhail Poltoranin, chairman of the State Duma 
Committee for Information Policy, told a RIA correspondent today 
that the single information area was in danger of 
disintegrating. He said that a dangerous policy--characterized 
by a trend toward replacing the state media with commercial 
structures interested in having their programs broadcast to 
central Russia only--could be discerned in the country. 
  The possibility that the Ostankino company might cut its 
output from 19 to five and a half hours in every 24 hours gave 
rise to particular anxiety in this context, Poltoranin noted. 
He emphasized that the activities of foreign news agencies in 
Russia also did tremendous damage to the country's sovereignty 
in the area of information. He said that having received the 
right to gather information, these agencies immediately 
disseminated it in the form they found convenient. This trend 
also posed dangers to the Russian information area, said the 
chairman of the information policy committee.

  [Text] Moscow -- A conflict continues in the ROSSIYSKAYA 
GAZETA editorial office between the administration and the 
journalist collective caused by changes in the publication's 
charter and the list of members of its staff. According to a 
staffer who asked not to be identified, "in violation of the law 
on the mass media, the new charter of the publication had not 
even been discussed at a meeting of the journalist collective." 
Besides, the proposed reorganization slates nearly 70 percent 
of journalists for dismissal. They are being offered work at 10 
new agencies to be organized on a commercial basis. As the 
journalist put it, "the charter, the list of staff members, and 
the accord with the founder -- which is the Russian Federation 
Government -- had been concealed from the collective as a 
"commercial secret" by the newspaper chiefs with its editor, 
Natalya Polezhayeva, at the head.

<F P=106> [Natalya Bespalova report under the "Colleagues" rubric: </F>
"Two Newspapers Under the Same Name. One of Them Is Certainly 
One Too Many"] 
  [Text] The saying that practice makes perfect is nearly 
universal. This was confirmed by the publication of SNG: 
OBSHCHIY RYNOK [CIS: COMMON MARKET] -- the first collective 
newspaper of the CIS countries. The decision on founding it was 
made 23 December 1993 at the Ashkhabad [Ashgabat] meeting of the 
CIS heads of government. According to the concept devised by 
the newspaper's editorial board, which included representatives 
of all republics that signed the agreement, the new publication 
was designed to help create a common economic space on CIS 
territory and also forge closer business contacts between 
representatives of various states. It was decided to publish the 
new periodical on the basis of Yegor Yakovlev's OBSHCHAYA 
GAZETA. The publisher states agreed to earmark 950 million 
rubles and $200,000 for this purpose. Vitaliy Kovalenko was 
appointed the newspaper's editor-in-chief. 
  At the beginning of 1994, however, legal inconsistencies 
inherent in the agreement on setting up the newspaper sparked a 
conflict between the OBSHCHAYA GAZETA board and SNG: OBSHCHIY 
RYNOK's staff, the bulk of which was made up of journalists who 
left ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA after the October events. On one hand, 
under the document the OBSHCHAYA GAZETA editorial board is to 
exercise day-to-day control over the new publication's activity; 
on the other, it does not have the right to intervene in the 
work of an independent paper. This discrepancy promptly led to 
disagreements between Yegor Yakovlev and Vitaliy Kovalenko. 
  Both sides have been advancing weighty arguments to support 
their stances, and the dispute over who is to head the new 
publication threatens to drag on indefinitely. It can be 
resolved only by a new meeting of the newspaper's editorial 
board, at which representatives of the CIS member states will 
have to decide once again on who should steer their periodical. 
So far, a paradoxical situation has come about where two 
absolutely different newspapers under the same name -- SNG: 
OBSHCHIY RYNOK -- appeared at an interval of three days, on 12 
and 15 April. The first one was published by journalists under 
Vitaliy Kovalenko, the second by the OBSHCHAYA GAZETA staff. 
Both sides claim that the only genuine newspaper is theirs.

    [Editorial Report] London ITV Television Network in English 
at 2000 GMT on 13 April in its "Dispatches" program carries a 
45-minute report entitled "Pocket Neutron," in which 
correspondent Gwyn Roberts reviews the findings of an 18-month 
investigation he conducted into red mercury, a chemical compound 
allegedly used by the Russians to develop a smaller, more 
efficient nuclear warhead. 
  The program opens with various shots of a border crossing in 
Como, northern Italy, and goes on to include a brief interview 
with Italian Magistrate Romano Dolce on the smuggling of red 
mercury through Italy. Asked about its final destination, 
Dolce, speaking in Italian with English subtitles, says: 
"Israel, Iraq, Iran, South Africa, and the rest of the world. 
Even Western countries like the United States seem interested 
in red mercury. Why should it be top secret? Why this silence? 
Why this fear of talking about it?" 
  Brief clips are then shown of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy during 
his visit to Serbia in February this year, followed by various 
street scenes in Moscow. Roberts then introduces a recording 
of an interview he conducted with an unidentified Kremlin 
official who, he says, has access to full government 
intelligence. Roberts asks: "What proof do you have that there 
is such a substance?" The official replies: "The hardest 
evidence is the report prepared by the first chief directorate 
of the KGB. This report was prepared especially for Boris 
Yeltsin. The conclusion of this report is that there is no 
doubt that red mercury exists." 
  Roberts asks: "What military applications of red mercury are 
listed in the KGB report?" The official states: "The 
production of fuses of high precision for conventional bombs. 
The production of fuses for nuclear bombs. The production of 
military equipment coating to avoid radar detection, production 
of warheads for self-guided missiles of high precision." 
  Asked whether red mercury represents new technology, the 
official replies: "I think it does." He goes on to say that 
Iraq, Libya, Israel, and South Africa all wish to purchase red 
mercury because they all want nuclear weapons. 
  Roberts is then seen at the Moscow metro where he meets an 
unidentified former nuclear chemist who worked at a secret plant 
in the Urals. They are then seen in an apartment where the 
chemist is interviewed. Roberts asks why everyone denies that 
red mercury exists. The chemist replies: "Because of reasons of 
secrecy." Roberts asks: "Why should they want to keep it 
secret?" The chemist says: "Because it is the latest 
technology. If it is available to the Third World it may be a 
serious danger to existing order." 
  Still photographs are then shown of containers labeled RM 
2020, followed by clips of diagrams of how red mercury can be 
used and a government document on the existence of the 
substance. A person described as the head of the Promocology 
company exhibits what purports to be the raw material for RM 
2020. Scenes of the Moscow White House siege of 1993 are then 
shown. 
  Roberts then interviews an unidentified military scientist 
in 
Moscow, who he says worked as a nuclear physicist producing RM 
2020 for five years. Roberts asks: "Why is red mercury such a 
mystery?" The scientist replies: "The fact is that it is the 
latest technology which allows an atom bomb to be made very 
simply." Roberts asks: "So you are saying that with red mercury 
and nuclear materials an atom bomb could be easily assembled by 
Third World countries?" The scientist replies: "Yes, that could 
happen." Asked how red mercury would be used, the scientist 
states: "It can reduce the critical mass and increase the power 
of the explosion." 
  The program shows street scenes in Ekaterinburg and a 
meeting 
with former nuclear physicist Yevgeniy Korolov, who replies to 
Dr. Taylor's questions. Korolov says: "This technology is one of 
the most complex and one of the most dangerous. It enables you 
to create micro-nuclear charges. This means it can be used for 
nuclear terrorism." 
  The program concludes with a visit by Roberts to a security 
company near Bonn, which trades with Russia and has business 
links with secret military plants producing radioactive 
isotopes. A document acquired in Ekaterinburg is shown which 
demonstrates that this company wishes to purchase 1,000 kg of RM 
2020, cutting to what is described as a list of the chemical 
properties of RM 2020.

  [Text] The participants in the All-Union Congress of the 
Union of Officers held in Moscow's suburbs have decided to ask 
the Russian military leadership to cancel the joint 
Russian-American military exercises planned for the summer of 
this year. The Union of Officers regards assisting and 
participating in the maneuvers as treason. The Congress passed 
a resolution assessing the recent air strikes against Bosnia as 
preparing a bridgehead for the mounting of aggression against 
Russia and other Slav states. In this connection the delegates 
demanded an immediate convocation of the UN Security Council to 
end the escalation of the violence and genocide of the Serbian 
people. This was reported by the Interfax agency.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondent Anatoliy Yurkin] </F>
  [Text] Mirnyy (Arkhangelsk region) April 18 TASS -- A 
programme for the environmental defence of the Russian north has 
been worked out by scientists working with the state strategic 
missile testing complex. The programme allows the military to 
estimate the damage caused to the environment by missile fuel 
and other harmful things, and to decrease the amount of damage 
caused to nature along the missiles' flight path. 
  "600 rocket and rocket-carrier launchings have been made in 
the last ten years. That is what forced us to start researching 
environmental problems", ITAR-TASS was told by Colonel Viktor 
Omelchenko, head of the testing area's computer centre. 
  The programme was worked out by the testing area's leading 
specialists and is a data and reference system which shows which 
areas are most subject to damage and the various levels of 
pollution. On the basis of such statistics, conclusions may be 
drawn and certain steps undertaken. The programme is unique, 
since it is concentrated on a concrete area, the environmentally 
fragile Russian north. 
  According to Omelchenko, Russian cooperation with American 
military scientists has led to great interest in the latter's 
missile-related environmental programme, which has been 
thoroughly worked out. 
  The United States programme's starting theses are 
significantly different from the Russian ones. For example, the 
flight trajectory of missiles and missile-launchers goes over 
the Pacific Ocean. However, the two countries' cooperation in 
this sphere is still very helpful. 
  "The programme which we have created is the first step to 
the 
development of an environmental monitoring system to keep track 
of the situation as it develops", stressed Colonel Omelchenko.

  [Text] In a letter to St. Petersburg's Mayor Anatoliy 
Sobchak Secretary Oleg Lobov of the Russian Security Council 
said the Russian military doctrine allowed the use of army units 
against organized crime if a region of the Russian Federation 
came under threat. The letter answers Sobchak's request for 
additional powers in the fight against crime. But, Lobov said, 
the Ministry of Internal Affairs must authorize the use of 
troops under its control. 
  According to Lobov, President Yeltsin was working on a 
decree 
on immediate moves for the protection of the citizens' 
constitutional rights and freedoms from criminal attacks. The 
decree would lay a legal foundation for the use of army units in 
anti-mafia operations and in a bid to maintain law and order. 
Bodies of the executive branch would enjoy the right to commit 
troops to action. 
  The decree would also grant the executive branch additional 
powers for controlling internal migration. Draft bills which 
introduce tougher penalties for unauthorized entry and stay in 
the Russian Federation, had been prepared and sent to the 
government. According to Lobov, the Mayor of St. Petersburg can, 
in his capacity as the chairman of the anti-crime and 
anti-corruption commission, coordinate moves by law and order 
bodies and plan long-term and immediate anti-crime actions in 
the region under his control.

<F P=106> [Interview with Andrey Afanasyevich Kokoshin, first deputy </F>
defense minister, by Christian Schmidt-Haeuer; date, place not 
given: "`We Have Come Very Close To Strikes'"] 
  [Text] [Schmidt-Haeuer] Russia's Armed Forces and its arms 
industry are threatened with being dried out financially. You 
have recently warned that, as a result of the budget cuts, the 
army might get out of control. Is Russia -- in a time of peace 
-- threatened by a military and arms technological collapse? 
  [Kokoshin] There is in practice never a hopeless situation, 
because a way out can always be found. In this case the way out 
is to restructure the budget. This applies mainly to the 
revenue side. My main criticism was directed against the fact 
that the spending was planned without a sufficient guarantee of 
revenue. This is why we are being affected by this budget, 
although not only the Defense Ministry but also in the spheres 
of culture, science, and social affairs. 
  [Schmidt-Haeuer] Still, in this situation the army is a very 
special budget item. 
  [Kokoshin] About 70 percent of our concrete military 
spending now goes on personnel costs and social benefits. This 
is why we are in the same boat as science and culture, with 
doctors and teachers. We do not stand on the other side of the 
riverbank. Another thing is, of course, that here we are 
talking of money to be spent on providing guarantees for people 
in uniform and with guns in their hand; and also for those who 
produce the arms. 
  [Schmidt-Haeuer] Through military reform, President Yeltsin 
wants to facilitate the restructuring of the defense budget to 
the benefit of social support. Can one really combine the 
modernization of the army and social emergency supply? 
  [Kokoshin] There are a number of concrete decisions, one of 
which is the president's decree on the stabilization of the 
situation in the arms industry. The president determines that 
at least 10 percent of defense spending has to be used for 
research and development. This is intended to guarantee the 
preservation of the scientific-technological potential. 
  However, at the same time we are facing enormous social 
problems. Let us take housing construction, for example. It is 
now eating up more than 90 percent of the funds for our military 
construction program -- after all, we have to accommodate those 
members of the military who go into the reserves as a result of 
troop reductions. Here the situation has deteriorated even from 
last year. In the first three months of 1994 the financing of 
housing construction unfortunately reached less than 20 percent 
of the planned quota. The situation also looks very bad as far 
as paying for arms is concerned -- although state orders had 
been cut to the minimum even before. 
  [Schmidt-Haeuer] What effects does this have in concrete 
terms? 
  [Kokoshin] Now as then, many enterprises and entire cities 
are dependent on arms orders. Even though the share of arms and 
military technology has been reduced there in favor of civilian 
goods, the management continues to burden the total costs for 
the entire social infrastructure, that is to say kindergartens, 
polyclinics, schools, and frequently even technical colleges, 
only on the prices for arms products. And the city and communal 
administrative bodies hesitate to take over the social 
facilities because their revenue is still insufficient despite 
the new tax law. So far, they have only picked those complexes 
that they were able to lease out immediately for a profit. This 
is how part of defense spending is financing hidden 
unemployment.... 
  [Schmidt-Haeuer] And to what extent has this spending been 
cut overall? 
  [Kokoshin] Unfortunately, our orders for the arms industry 
were cut by 67 percent in 1992 alone. This is unparalleled in 
any other country. In 1992 we bought a total of 20 tanks from 
our industry -- in 1988 the number was still 2,800. And the 
considerably extended amount of civilian products did not find 
enough buyers either -- neither state nor private ones. 
  [Schmidt-Haeuer] This means that the conversion of 
enterprises is not worthwhile? 
  [Kokoshin] Many enterprises have considerably increased the 
range of their civilian products. The tank construction plant 
at Nishniy Tagil, for example, has been converted to the 
production of railroad tankers and loading machines 
[Lademaschinen] amid great fuss. Yet, now these tankers are 
crowding the storage yards. The Railroads Ministry does not 
have the money to buy them. Radio satellites cannot be bought 
by the Ministry for Telecommunications, nor can it afford to buy 
the rockets to launch them. 
  [Schmidt-Haeuer] In order to pay the state's orders to the 
arms industry, the state would have to spend five times as much 
as planned in the 1994 draft budget. 
  [Kokoshin] The figures presented by the Finance Ministry are 
unrealistic. However, now there is the proposal that government 
and the State Duma together draw up the 1994 budget again. 
After the extremely tough confrontations last year, there is 
thus the opportunity to work out a new budget in the spirit of 
national accord -- thus, in the spirit of the policy that 
President Yeltsin has now proclaimed and that is supported by 
the chairmen of both parliamentary chambers. 
  [Schmidt-Haeuer] But former Vice President Aleksandr Rutskoy 
has just come out very harshly against Yeltsin's offer of 
reconciliation. And Rutskoy is also a military officer.... 
  [Kokoshin] He is no longer a military officer. And such an 
attitude seems completely wrong to me. Now we really have an 
opportunity for national reconciliation. And we need it 
urgently. I am convinced that the overwhelming majority of our 
people also want it. 
  [Schmidt-Haeuer] A high-ranking representative of the 
interests of the arms industry has warned against a wave of 
strikes. He says that the miners just have a piece of coal in 
their hands, but the arms companies have poison or 
intermediate-range missiles, which almost any unqualified worker 
could launch from the factory's yard. How serious is the mood 
in reality? 
  [Kokoshin] Unfortunately, we have come very close to 
strikes, even though the most disciplined people are working in 
the arms sectors. And they are also aware that they are in a 
situation that is a bit different from that of the miners, that 
other laws apply to them. However, in the factories there is 
indeed a mood that indicates strikes. Last autumn I had to 
settle several such conflicts. In September the staff of a 
large arms company went on strike. The women took the protest 
to the streets. We had to take a lot of money out of many other 
companies to pay them their wages and to pay support to them for 
another two months. Such situations are escalating again now, 
so I do not want to underestimate the danger of strikes. 
  [Schmidt-Haeuer] How many arms companies have closed down 
because of bankruptcy, and for how many is this danger imminent? 
  [Kokoshin] From the legal point of view, I do not think that 
a single one has been closed down, because the local 
administrations are doing everything to avert this danger. 
Since we lack social security and an unemployment benefit 
system and people are not mentally prepared for life without 
work, closing down companies and lay-offs feel like the 
apocalypse for the local authorities. 
  However, I do not believe that the situation is hopeless. 
Even if they get only small financial infusions, many companies 
would certainly be able not only to start working again but to 
continue the policy of modernization and production conversion. 
If certain incentives are given by the government, we can 
expect that private businessmen and banks will also invest in 
the industry. However, without a strong incentive by the 
government to develop the infrastructure, that is, 
transportation, communications, and the energy sector, it will 
be very difficult to get out of the crisis. The invisible hand 
of the market still works very badly. 
  [Schmidt-Haeuer] And the visible hand of the state does not 
work any better, either, at least for the time being.... 
  [Kokoshin] The state is not fulfilling its obligations. We 
used to be the scapegoat for the people. Now they realize that 
it is not our Ministry's fault. 
  [Schmidt-Haeuer] But that does not provide food. Anyone who 
can tries to earn his keep elsewhere. The fear of Russian 
scientists emigrating, and of the illegal export of uranium and 
highly developed weapons and technologies continues. 
  [Kokoshin] Such dangers certainly exist. The hunt for 
experts continues. And there are people who cannot do anything 
other than build weapons. For their minds any kind of 
conversion is too late. Therefore, it is so important to 
preserve and finance an appropriate level of arms production to 
keep these experts in Russia -- in a Russia that continues along 
the path of democracy and market economy. 
  [Schmidt-Haeuer] But you yourself, in an interview, have 
attributed yet another state assignment to the arms industry, 
namely to be the most important resource of competitiveness. 
  [Kokoshin] However, I put the emphasis on something else on 
principle. There I made the establishment of a 
science-intensive high-tech civilian production a priority -- 
but on the basis of the resources of the defense complex. This 
is our main potential to assume a worthy place among the great 
powers, among the developed industrialized nations. For me this 
seems to be a more important aspect for the state's security in 
the broadest sense -- beyond military power and military 
technology.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondent Gennadiy Yezhov] </F>
  [Text] St. Petersburg April 18 TASS -- Russian Prime 
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin today addressed the opening session 
of the board of directors of the European Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development [EBRD], which is holding its 
third annual meeting here today. 
  Viktor Chernomyrdin told the EBRD leaders and prominent 
statesmen and business people from the bank's fifty-seven 
stockholding countries that the forum in St. Petersburg is "a 
weighty testimony to the fact that the anxiety and uncertainty 
felt by our international partners about the fact of economic 
reforms in Russia, so pronounced at the beginning of the year, 
are now giving room to other sentiments and different 
expectations". 
  For his part, the Russian prime minister said "quite 
definitely and responsibly" that the policy of financial 
stabilisation, further reforms and restructuring of the national 
economy will remain the pivot of the Russian economic policy. 
Chernomyrdin pointed to the results of the first months of this 
year as bearing out his statement. In February and March, the 
inflation growth rate fell beneath ten per cent and the April 
figures will not differ considerably. The federal budget for the 
end of 1994 has been drafted with a deficit of about nine per 
cent of the gross product. It means that given the steady main 
parameters, the inflation growth rate will dwindle to seven per 
cent before the year is out. 
  The discussion of the draft budget in the Federal Assembly 
is 
proceeding with difficulties, Viktor Chernomyrdin stressed. The 
draft has been approved as the basis, and "we shall take into 
account any modifications approved by the deputies in line with 
the overall logic of the reforms carried out in Russia. 
  Political and financial stabilisation has already yielded 
its 
first fruit -- demand restrictions have begun to work. Although 
the production slump has been increasing since the beginning of 
the year, it has acquired a clear-cut structural character. 
  "We are now at the deepest point of the crisis," the prime 
minister said. The Russians have come quite close to the 
frontier beyond which U-turn can occur in the main negative 
tendencies which determined our development in the past 
two-three years. But the U-turn can occur only if investments 
liven up", Chernomyrdin said. The Russian premier appealed to 
the representatives of the European bank for reconstruction and 
development and the delegations from industrialised countries 
and international financial organisations to step up their 
activities on the Russian market. 
  Annual meetings of the board of directors of the EBRD 
traditionally examine the results of the bank's activity for the 
preceding year and determine guidelines for the next year. As 
concerns Russia, central bank officials told ITAR-TASS that the 
European bank has approved loans to fund 21 projects in Russia, 
including major ones, such as the development of the oilfield in 
the Arctic area of the Pechora basin, worth 300 million USD. By 
the end of this year, the number of approved projects, which are 
now being prepared, may reach fifty.

  [Text] St. Petersburg April 18 TASS -- Russian Prime 
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin pledged adherence to market reforms 
and predicted that inflation may be curtailed to 7-8 per cent by 
the end of the year if the budget drafted for 1994 is approved 
by the State Duma. 
  "The course towards reforms, financial stabilisation and 
economic restructuring remains the backbone of the Russian 
economic policy", Chernomyrdin told a meeting of the governors 
of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development which 
opened in the second biggest Russian city on Monday. 
  He recalled that in the first quarter of 1994 inflation was 
below the 10 per cent level and predicted it would be further 
curtailed to monthly 7-8 per cent by the end of the year "if the 
planned parametres of the budget are preserved". The Russian 
State Duma gave an outline approval to the draft budget, but 
demanded that the government introduces certain corrections to 
it.

  [Text] St. Petersburg, 17 Apr -- The coordination of 
international assistance for Russian reforms, particularly the 
problem of creating a multilateral agency to guarantee foreign 
investment against non-commercial risks -- this and other issues 
were discussed at a closed meeting held today in the Yusupov 
Palace in St. Petersburg between Russian Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin and delegations from the Group of Seven 
industrially developed Western countries and international 
financial organizations. 
  Chernomyrdin noted at the meeting that the Russian 
leadership 
is firmly adhering to its policy of continuing the reforms and 
sees no other way forward. We have come a long way in 
implementing market transformations and one can already talk 
about certain successes, the Russian prime minister said. In 
the first place we have brought down inflation, and steadied it 
at eight or nine percent a month. 
  Chernomyrdin thanked the Western partners for taking part in 
the meeting. Taking part in the meeting on the Russian side 
were Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Shokhin, Central Bank 
Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko, Acting Finance Minister Sergey 
Dubinin and other officials.

  [Excerpt] St. Petersburg, 18 Apr (TASS) -- [passage 
omitted] "The St. Petersburg meeting is a major and important 
event. The fact itself that 4,000 to 5,000 business people will 
arrive here to participate in the annual meeting of the EBRD 
[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development] is of a great 
importance both for the city and for Russia. Seminars and 
events organized by different countries, and other contacts 
should promote mutual understanding and business opportunities. 
I hope that after this week in St. Petersburg, the bank will 
gain the very strong support of all its members", said EBRD 
chairman Jacques de Larosiere on the eve of the meeting in an 
exclusive ITAR-TASS interview.

  [Text] Novosibirsk April 18 TASS -- Deputy Prime Minister 
Sergey Shakhray supported state regulation and protectionism in 
the regional policy, when he was speaking today at a scientific 
and practical conference in Novosibirsk. The purpose of the 
conference is to work out a strategy of stabilising the economic 
situation in the region. 
  The diversity of regions and the multinational character of 
the Russian state are not the source of its weakness, but, on 
the contrary, a factor of its potential might. At the same 
time, he pointed to the growing disproportion among regions and 
a trend towards economic disintegration. According to Shakhray, 
some regions are stepping up economic transformations, others 
are preserving old methods and approaches to the economic 
development. There is not a single region in Russia without 
problems today, he said. 
  Shakhray described as rather ineffective the market-oriented 
mechanisms of eliminating disproportions in the development of 
the regions. This is why, he continued, a tougher regional 
policy is needed, whose main task will be to bring to naught the 
contrasts between living standards of the population of various 
regions. 
  The conference is being attended by representatives of 25 
regions of Russia, of the Federation Council, the State Duma, 
many ministries and organisations, as well as by scientists.

  [Text] Russia can implement a comprehensive program to 
advance its fuel and energy complex, to secure an energy surplus 
and, in the long run, enable Russia to stay an industrialized 
country, the Russian Fuel and Energy Minister Yuriy Shafranik 
has declared in an interview with the Oil Information Agency. 
  The fuel and energy complex will, in his words, be developed 
by supporting big integrated companies and by encouraging 
investment in viable oil and gas, coal, and energy enterprises. 
In his opinion, the Russian government's major achievement has 
been its policy to consolidate the Russian fuel and energy 
complex's positions world wide and its promotion of economic 
cooperation with the neighboring states." 
  He recalled in this connection that Russia and Ukraine had 
agreed to turn the Lisichan oil refinery in Ukraine into a 
joint-stock company with Russia to share up to 60 percent of its 
stock. He also recalled that Russia and Belarus had agreed to 
share the stock of the Mozyrskiy oil refinery. Russian oil 
companies will take part in oil and gas projects in 
Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, and Azerbaijan. 
  One of the biggest Russian oil companies Lookoil has signed 
with the Azerbaijani government an agreement on a 10 percent 
participation of the company in a major international project to 
develop the Azeri and Charak deposits. Besides, Lookoil and 
Ajip of Italy intend to boost oil extraction in Tunisia. 
According to Lookoil experts, oil gushed out of the first well 
drilled by Russian specialists in Tunisia. Russian specialists 
will also prospect for oil and develop oil fields in Nigeria. 
  Shafranik described as a contract of strategic importance 
the 
agreement signed by Russia, Kazakhstan, Oman and the American 
Chevron company to set up a Caspian pipe-line consortium. Such 
a consortium has come into being and has worked out a project to 
lay a long-distance oil pipe line from Tengiz to Novorossiysk 
via Komsomolskaya and Tikhoretsk to transport up to 62 million 
tonnes of oil a year. The plan also provides for building an 
oil terminal at Novorosiysk with an annual capacity of 15 
million tonnes. 
  "This is the only project to ship oil from Kazakhstan within 
the coming 20-30 years. Quite autonomous terminals of our 
industry have already provided for 25 percent of export there. 
We have also managed to keep and stabilize oil extraction in 
Vietnam. We have secured an agreement on a Sakhalin-2 tender, 
have sped up work on Sakhalin-1, have made Sakhalin-3 and 
Sakhalin-4 tenders possible, which is a tremendous success since 
a bonus to the tender sponsors alone will fetch $130 million," 
Shafranik reported.

Crops Will Be 180,000 to 200,000 Rubles Per Tonne"] 
  [Text] Procurement prices for 1994 crops will be on average 
"not less than 180,000 to 200,000 rubles [R] per tonne." In 
1993, this sum constituted R57,000. This was the conclusion 
made 14 April by the Russian Federation Government's Food 
Commission. In the current year the government will procure 
10.7 million tonnes of grain into the federal food fund designed 
to supply military and same-status categories of citizens, as 
well as for other purposes, which is 1.1 million tonnes less 
than in 1993. The government will allocate R1.6 trillion in 
budget loans to raise federal grain funds and, in addition, 5.5 
trillion to 6 trillion will be channeled for these purposes from 
the state fund to ship foodstuffs to Upper North areas.

<F P=106> [Stanislav Koltsov report in the "Budget" column: "Sergey </F>
Glazyev Has Sent the Budget Back to the Council of Ministers. 
The Duma Hoped To Begin Its Consideration on Friday"] 
  [Text] Three days before the parliament's lower chamber was 
to begin discussing the budget, the State Duma's Economic Policy 
Committee decided to send it back to the government for 
amendment. The committee's conclusion on the draft federal 
budget for 1994 says in particular that the "authenticity" of 
the macroeconomic forecast underlying the draft budget "causes 
great doubts," proceeding from the correlation of the GNP 
deflation index in the first quarter compared to the same period 
in 1993 (7.8 percent). True, the Finance Ministry also 
criticized the deflation indicators included in the so-called 
"second" version of the "forecast." The authors of the 
conclusion believe that the rate of inflation, as well as of 
production decline, will be much higher than the forecasted 
level, and furthermore they assess as "unrealistic" the 
estimated budget revenues and expenditures as shown in the 
draft. 
  Second, the Economic Policy Committee considers the draft 
budget proposed by the government "inadequate" to the priorities 
of socioeconomic development "set forth in the program materials 
of the Russian Federation president and government." Analyzing 
the structure of federal budget expenditures, the committee 
deems it essential to state that "only such structural policy 
priorities as the development of the agro-industrial complex and 
the fuel and energy sector have been ensured state support," 
while "insufficient financing of major directions of structural 
and science and technical policy will not allow in 1994 to break 
the dangerous trends toward the country's de-industrialization 
and irreversible destruction of its scientific and technical 
potential." In addition, the committee believes that "a natural 
form of implementing structural policy priorities should be 
special-purpose federal programs approved by the State Duma for 
the entire period of their implementation." 
  The Economic Policy Committee, furthermore, assesses as 
unsatisfactory the work to raise additional budget revenues. In 
this connection the committee recommends abolishing all 
concessions in paying taxes, customs duties, and other 
obligatory deductions that contradict current legislation and 
also fail to stimulate a growth of internal demand and do not 
arise from structural policy priorities. 
  "In order to assist the Russian Federation Government in 
finalizing the draft federal budget," the committee proposes 
that a parliament-government commission be set up to draw up a 
realistic forecast for the Russian Federation's economic 
development in 1994 and 1995; that the 1994 draft budget be 
reworked on a quarterly basis; and that coordinated targets for 
state economic policy in 1994 and 1995 be elaborated as well as 
programs for their implementation, in accordance with the 
provisions of the presidential message and recommendations of 
parliamentary hearings in the State Duma.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Draft Budget Discussed"] </F>
  [Text] Yesterday the State Duma session examined the draft 
federal Law "On the Federal Budget for 1994." Sergey Dubinin, 
acting Russian finance minister, and Mikhail Zadornov, chairman 
of the Duma Committee for the Budget, Taxes, Banks, and 
Finances, delivered reports. 
  Sergey Dubinin stressed that when drawing up the draft 
budget 
for 1994 the Russian Federation Government opted for a version 
intermediate between a tough financial policy which would allow 
inflation to be lowered to 5 percent per month but would be very 
painful and an attempt at pumping the economy full of money, 
which would lead to 50 percent inflation. He reported that they 
have planned a budget revenue base of 120.7 trillion rubles [R], 
a deficit of R62.4 trillion, and expenditure of R183.1 trillion. 
  Inflation remains "enemy number one," he said. Ten percent 
inflation per month is now planned, with a reduction to 7 
percent by the end of the year. The budget deficit planned for 
the current year is 8-9 percent of GDP. Part of the deficit, 
roughly 6 percent of gross product, will be covered by Central 
Bank loans. 
  Commenting on the revenue side of the budget, Sergey Dubinin 
noted that a sharp increase in total revenue is not expected. 
Whereas last year it was 10 percent of GDP for the federal 
budget and 14 percent for the budgets of the territories, this 
current year a total of 12 percent of GDP is planned. The 
speaker noted that it is planned to take effective measures to 
stop tax evasion. 
  Regarding the allocation of budget expenditure, the minister 
reported that R48.5 trillion has been appropriated for defense 
and the law-enforcement agencies; R48.1 trillion for state 
support for sectors of the national economy; R24.5 trillion to 
help the regions; R16.8 trillion to service the state debt; and 
R12.2 trillion for social measures. 
  Mikhail Zadornov, chairman of the Duma Committee for the 
Budget, Taxes, Banks, and Finances, advocated revising the 1994 
draft budget. He proposed, in particular, that the budget 
deficit be increased from the current 34 percent to 43-45 
percent. The committee chairman considers that the revenue side 
of the budget requires amplification, as he fears that many 
sources of income will not be able to yield the return the 
government expects. It is also necessary, according to 
Zadornov, to abolish concessions on customs duties and 
consolidate extrabudgetary funds. 
  Mikhail Zadornov even reported that the committee he heads 
considers it right to ratify the budget for the first six months 
and to instruct the Russian Federation government to submit to 
the Duma the draft budgets for the third and fourth quarters of 
the current year, that is to say, to switch to the practice of 
examining the budget quarter by quarter. We will thereby, he 
considers, "ensure the government takes account of our proposals 
and really controls the implementation of the budget." The 
Russian Government, the Duma committee chairman said, has also 
been instructed to submit the 1995 budget to the Duma no later 
than September this year. 
  For his part, deputy committee chairman Aleksandr Pochinok, 
expressing a "dissenting view" on this issue, proposed that the 
draft budget be passed on the first reading. He stated, in 
particular, here that the proposed budget deficit increase to 
43-45 percent would entail rapidly increasing inflation.

<F P=106> [Aleksey Kirpichnikov report under the "Harmony" rubric: </F>
"Government and State Duma Find Common Language. Budget 
Infusions To Be Put in Order"] 
  [Text] The State Duma has made what might at first glance 
seem as minor amendments to its rules of procedure, but what in 
legal terms has marked a certain turn in relations between the 
representative and executive authorities. The issue is that 
under Article 104 of the Constitution draft laws that call for 
federal budget appropriations cannot be submitted for State Duma 
consideration without the government's expert opinion. By 
including this article in the Fundamental Law its authors tried 
to insure themselves against the practice of the RSFSR's Supreme 
Soviet and Congress where the adoption of laws to the greatest 
detriment of the budget seemed to be the domestic deputies' 
favorite sport. Out of inertia, the new parliamentarians have 
tried to go back to their former hobby only to run into Article 
104. 
  Initially, lawyers among deputies have found a loophole: 
what is required under the Constitution is just a government 
opinion regardless of what it says. For instance, a law on a 
100-fold rise in the salaries of commercial bank directors to be 
financed by the state could cost 1 trillion rubles from the 
budget, of which the government would advise the State Duma, 
deeming the initiative inappropriate, but the deputies could 
well spurn the opinion and pass the draft law just the same. 
This is why the government did not see any reason to rush with 
writing its opinions. The State Duma's unilateral attempt to 
impose time limits on the executive branch would have certainly 
been unconstitutional. 
  The situation was definitely abnormal, but the two sides 
have 
reached an agreement and decided to formalize it legally: On 11 
April the government decreed that letters with opinions on draft 
laws regarding federal budget expenditures must be prepared 
within 14 days. The period may be extended to 30 days if it is 
necessary to obtain additional information which is not provided 
for in the state accounting system. Moreover, the government 
obliged federal authorities to draw up opinions on State Duma 
draft laws at its request within 7 or 15 days, the latter if 
there is a need to obtain extra information. Finally, should a 
sponsor of the draft law or a Federation component fail to 
submit the requisite information, the government decreed that 
the dispute would be resolved upon agreement with the lower 
chamber. 
  The State Duma has gone its part of the way, too. The 
amendments to its rules of procedure effectively repeat the 
government document, except for the provision on giving 
assignments to executive agencies, something the lower chamber 
is not entitled to do. 
  The State Duma was surprisingly swift in considering the 
rules of procedure amendments, and Deputy Baburin's remark that 
the decree is very important, because it affects the status of 
both the government and the State Duma -- which is why there is 
no reason to be too hasty in adopting it before the law on 
deputy status is passed -- did not find a response among the 
parliamentarians. Maybe one of the reasons is that the report 
on the agreement was delivered by "the biggest leaf on both 
branches of power" -- Sergey Shakhray, who is at the same time a 
deputy prime minister in the government and a State Duma faction 
leader.

<F P=106> [Report by Igor Karpenko: "Parliament's Discussion of </F>
Privatization in Russia Unusually Calm So Far"] 
  [Text] Joint hearings on the results of privatization took 
place in the Russian parliament 12 April. Considering past 
experience of such events, they were amazingly calm and 
businesslike. According to Anatoliy Chubays' report, the major 
results of check privatization were the creation of a major 
stratum of private owners (around 40 million) and a stock 
market, as well as a new -- to us, that is -- investment 
institution: investment funds, of which there are now more than 
650. He spent a further hour answering numerous deputies' 
questions, practically none of them aggressive or angry, 
surprisingly enough. Now were there any quesitons of this kind 
during the discussion of the results. 
  The tranquil atmosphere in the hall was surprising also 
because the substantial file of materials prepared for the 
hearings, weighing in at 1.5 kg, included some explosive 
findings by deputies' groups, accusing the Committee for the 
Management of State Property of all manner of mortal sins. For 
instance, the "Russian Way" ["Rossiyskiy Put"] deputies' group, 
headed by I. Anichkin and S. Baburin, finds that the current 
privatization "contains the roots of a speculative, mafia, 
criminal economy," "robs working people, contains the roots of a 
civil war and possible return to totalitarianism," and so on. 
While Mr. Zhirinovskiy, on behalf of the LDPR [Liberal 
Democratic Party of Russia], in his typically forthright manner, 
simply prposed that an audit be carried out and that criminal 
actions be taken against the privatizers. 
  But these charges were totally absent from the speeches at 
the hearings, indeed there was no political debate at all -- 
according to one deputy, the discussion was not about "political 
economy and not about economic policy." But the hearings have 
not ended and will be continued next week. Maybe the 
aggressively minded section of the corps of deputies intends to 
try to obstruct privatization then. 
  Evidently believing there was no possibility of a political 
scandal, some deputies started to drift away as soon as the 
discussion began. By the end of the hearings you had the 
chronic disease of the former parliament -- only around 
one-fourth of those who had originally assembled were still 
present. 
  I put the following question to Anatoliy Chubays after the 
parliamentary hearings: How do you explain the entirely 
good-natured and calm tone of the speeches today? 
  "Perhaps it is a good thing that today's discussion was not 
at the level of hysterics and hurling of vouchers," Anatoliy 
Borisevich replied. 
  Incidentally, a whole series of speeches, perhaps not very 
shrill or flashy, was substantive and contained rather 
significant new elements. There were speakers today who are 
participating responsibly in privatization. What, for example, 
does the check fund indicate? "We want to be actively engaged 
in long-term investments and we cannot do that for one reason or 
another." Look, a structure has emerged, which demands that 
deputies make it possible to engage in long-term investments -- 
it is an entirely new situation in the real Russian market. 
There were plenty of moments of this kind. Let us pray that 
the second part of the discussion is as substantive and without 
any hysterics... 
  "And are they to be expected, do you think?" 
  "Well, those who were preparing certain recommendations have 
not gone away. I think they will come to the next hearings 
revitalized. I am well aware that serious preparations are 
still going on. Nothing happened, because the atmosphere in the 
hall was wrong. Certain young deputies simply lacked the 
experience of political intrigues. I expect there will be 
statements by political parties about what I have lovingly 
stashed away in my own briefcase, about my responsibility for 
the disintegration of Russia, and so on. Let us draw any 
conclusions about how aggressive parliament is when the hearings 
are over..."

exists in concealed form in the draft does not help the country 
to emerge from the economic crisis and gives no guarantees 
against a descent into hyperinflation and a catastrophic slump 
in production.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Mikheyev report: "Duma Deputies Would Willingly </F>
Disband NATO, But Are Forced To Accept `Partnership' for Time 
Being"] 
  [Text] After four-hour hearings devoted to NATO's 
"Partnership for Peace" program, State Duma deputies decided 
that if they are to join NATO it will be on their terms. The 
role of a second-rate supernumerary waiting in the lobby to find 
out what decisions are being made at NATO Headquarters is not a 
suitable one for Russia. 
  The supporters of joining NATO on the terms formulated by 
the 
Americans in the "Partnership for Peace" concept proceed on the 
basis that the alternative is unacceptable. Fourteen states, 
including Ukraine, Moldavia [Moldova], and Georgia, have already 
signed applications to join NATO. If Russia misses its chance, 
they say, it will find itself internationally isolated. 
  As events in Sarajevo and Gorazde have shown, there is 
currently "no real coordination" and the NATO powers are 
"staking a claim to a monopoly on decisionmaking." We do not 
need that kind of "partnership," Yuriy Ushakov, director of the 
Russian Foreign Ministry's All-European Cooperation Department, 
said. He argued that it would be easier to combat this evil 
from within the Atlantic bloc rather than on the outside. 
  A similar line of thinking was followed by Major General 
Pavel Zolotarev, a Defense Ministry representative, who believes 
that it is impossible to expect the NATO bloc to disband itself, 
"even if we try to flex our muscles"; therefore it would be 
better for Russia to take part in the process of moving our 
former enemies "away from containment through deterrence 
[sderzhivaniye cherez ustrasheniye] to containment through 
partnership." 
  If we remain on the sidelines, Russia will be "distanced 
from 
the integration processes in Europe" and play into the hands of 
those circles who would like to "turn NATO into a closed 
anti-Russian bloc." The general referred to the lack of a 
mechanism for military cooperation with the Atlantic alliance, 
but reassured those who are afraid of NATO attempting to 
"discipline" Russia or, even more, of our soldiers being placed 
under the command of U.S. or German generals. 
  The most determined opponents' objections were summarized in 
an anonymous note issued to everyone, which stated that 
"Partnership for Peace" had been dreamed up to "preserve and 
further strengthen (expand) NATO, to establish the bloc's 
strategic influence in East Europe, and to move its front lines 
right up to the borders of the Commonwealth states and, in 
particular, Russia." The debate discussed the correlation 
between the commitments which Russia would have to make to NATO 
and the commitments it has already made under the Treaty on 
Collective Security within the CIS. 
  The military threat to Russia currently comes not from the 
West but from within the Commonwealth, which dictates our 
regional security priorities, General Leonid Ivashov of the CIS 
Military Cooperation Coordination Headquarters, stated. 
  Weightier arguments "against" were voiced by Lieutenant 
General Aleksandr Tymko, chief of the Border Guards Main Staff, 
who viewed the problem in a purely professional light -- NATO 
"will be striving to reach Russia's borders." 
  In his opinion, the growing Estonian territorial claims on 
Russia, Lithuania's disagreement with the line of the border, 
the increasing activeness of extremist groupings, and the 
development of special subdivisions in the Baltic countries 
should be taken into account. It cannot be ruled out that 
"partnership" with the West European powers would destroy the 
CIS countries' collective security system. 
  Gennadiy Yampolskiy, leader of the State Committee for the 
Defense Industry, recalled that military production in the 
country had fallen five-fold, and Russian arms exports amount to 
just over $2 billion -- 15 times less than the U.S. figure. 
  There is keener competition on the arms markets, lobbyist 
methods are being used against Russian producers, the Missile 
Technology Control Regime is being exploited, and Western firms 
are trying to win orders from East European countries for the 
modernization of old Soviet weapons. 
  Konstantin Zatulin, chairman of the CIS Affairs Committee 
and 
the organizer of the debates, considered it necessary to note 
that the timing for joining the "Partnership for Peace" program 
had been badly chosen; the fears of being isolated take no 
account of the Eurasian nature of the Russian Federation -- 
something which he called "political color blindness." We are 
not being allowed access to the new "distribution of labor" in 
arms markets, which makes us suspect our partners of "putting 
out a contract to kill" the Russian military-industrial complex. 
  Judging by the results of the hearings, the Duma will make 
the following recommendations -- that there should be no rush to 
join NATO in this currently undefined way; that, as a minimum, 
talks should be held on the entire range of military-technical 
aspects of cooperation; and that a decree on the compulsory 
ratification of the act governing Russia's accession to the 
"Partnership for Peace" program be adopted as a federal law. 
  Subsequently, as Zatulin put it, work will have to be done 
to 
ensure that "all the relics of the `cold war' are consigned to 
the archives -- that is, not only the Warsaw Pact, but NATO as 
well."

<F P=106> [Ivan Rodin report in the "Parliament" column: "A Big Gap </F>
Has Been Found in the Constitution. Through It, the Duma Can 
Contest the President's Exclusive Powers To Pursue Domestic and 
Foreign Policy"] 
  [Text] Yesterday the State Duma Council received two draft 
laws initiated by the Agrarian Party faction, namely by the 
Duma's Legislation Committee Chairman Vladimir Isakov. The laws 
have long titles: The former, On Suspending Participation by 
the Russian Federation in Enforcing International Sanctions 
Imposed Against the Union Republic of Yugoslavia; and the 
second, On Compulsory Ratification of the Act of Accession to 
the Partnership for Peace Program. Mr. Isakov first announced 
the existence of these documents at the Duma's 13 April session, 
which discussed the chamber's statement on the bombing of Bosnia. 
  Vladimir Isakov told the deputies at the time that their 
motives for issuing statements only because the Constitution 
refers the definition of the main aspects of foreign policy 
exclusively to the president's jurisdiction are erroneous 
because Article 3 of the Constitution says this is done in 
accordance with federal laws. Isakov called on his colleagues to 
adopt such laws. 
  The first draft law provides for Russia's suspending its 
participation in sanctions against the Union Republic of 
Yugoslavia in view of their one-sided application, recommending 
to the government to restore all relations with Serbia and 
Montenegro. The title of the second bill speaks for itself and 
furthermore establishes that prior to ratification of Russia's 
accession to Partnership for Peace it does not impose any 
obligations on Russia. Therefore Vladimir Isakov, who reads the 
constitution carefully, unlike those who drafted it in their 
time, has scored a first success by finding a loophole which, if 
need be, can be enlarged. He does not, however, regard the 
corresponding article in the Constitution as a hole because, 
according to him, "it is big enough for even a truck to pass 
through." 
  The fact is that the main domestic policy lines formulated 
by 
the president are also pursued in accordance with federal laws. 
To be sure, laws adopted by the Duma may be vetoed by both the 
Federation Council and the president but if there is really a 
strong desire, two-thirds of the votes can always be secured to 
override this veto. To a very large extent this applies to the 
Partnership for Peace ratification bill: An overwhelming 
majority of the Duma factions are demanding that an act on 
accession to this program be submitted for approval.

  [Text] The Chairman of the State Duma's committee on 
legislation and legal reform Vladimir Isakov (Agrarian faction) 
told Interfax the Duma would be sure to endorse a draft bill on 
the compulsory ratification of plans to enter NATO's Partnership 
for Peace [PFP] program. 
  Last week Isakov, who authored the draft bill, found that 
the 
Russian constitution allowed the State Duma to map out Russia's 
line in international affairs. Earlier, only the president was 
privileged to plan foreign policy moves. On behalf of his 
faction Isakov came out with two foreign policy bills -- on the 
ratification of plans to join the Partnership for Peace program 
and on the lifting of economic sanctions against Serbia. 
  Isakov told Interfax that practically no factions and groups 
in the State Duma opposed the idea of compulsory ratification. 
Even the Russia's Choice faction, which integrated, among 
others, Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, saw the pro's and 
contra's of the Russian integration into the program and was 
willing to play the NATO card in its own interests. 
  The endorsement of a foreign policy bill would set a serious 
precedent and that was what put the reformist factions Russia's 
Choice and Yabloko on the alert. Nonetheless, Isakov hoped the 
national interests would prevail. 
  So far, Isakov said, the President and his Foreign Minister 
saw the parliament's role in foreign policy-making as 
insignificant. The bombing raid on Serb positions in Bosnia, 
rather than the political lineup in Russia, motivated the 
decision to put off plans to join the NATO program. Isakov saw 
the attack on Serb positions as a blow on Yeltsin, Kozyrev and 
the whole of Russia.

<F P=106> [Reports by Yevgeniy Skukin under general heading: "We </F>
Discuss Draft Agreement on Civil Accord"] 
  [Text] We Are For Moncloa Plan; Vladimir Goman, 
Deputy Chairman of the Committee for Federation Affairs in 
Regional Policy 
  Our deputies' group, "new regional policy," was the 
initiator 
in elaborating a memorandum on accord in the State Duma. We 
were the first to come out with the proposal to adopt this 
document, similar to the Moncloa pact signed in Spain in 1977, 
to ensure that a consolidating basis appears in the work of the 
State Duma. If the sides which sign this document are sincere 
in their desire to lead society to civil accord and peace in 
order to implement the economic reforms which have been outlined 
then in that case the document on civil accord will play its 
part. But if a dual and triple philosophy is in operation and 
we say one thing, think another, and do a third, then the 
document will be doomed. 
<H5>  I Support It Although.... Sergey Yushenkov, chairman of the </H5>
State Duma Defense Committee 
  The actual idea of civil accord agreements with the 
existence 
of a Constitution seems dubious to me. But on the other hand an 
agreement after the amnesty is indeed essential. The statements 
and actions of those who have been amnestied show that they by 
no means assess the pardon as an act of well intentioned 
conciliation and the path toward accord and they openly oppose 
the existing system, the president, and other structures of 
legal power. In this connection we must of course prevent 
conflicts in society. But how to do this? The memorandum on 
accord adopted by the Duma is in my view a hollow thing. It 
contains no real mechanisms of implementation except the 
primitive appeal to live in harmony -- there is nothing there. 
The president's draft provides for a mechanism of 
implementation -- not only organs for coordinating actions but 
also certain sanctions. 
  When the "Russia's Choice" faction said that such agreements 
are impossible right now, we were by no means opposing the idea 
there should be an agreement. We were simply saying that the 
tasks which can be resolved should be resolved. I am skeptical 
about such documents and at the same time I understand the need 
for such steps from the viewpoint of creating an atmosphere of 
conciliation in society.

<F P=106> [Nika Stark report in the "Social Security Guarantees for </F>
the President" column: "Secure Old Age Does Not Threaten Boris 
Yeltsin Yet"] 
  [Text] While, according to the official version, the 
Russian president is full of vigor and has no intention of 
retiring, a strange document has appeared in the Duma concerning 
the head of state's material insurance: both during the period 
of his state service and after. This draft law -- On State 
Social Security Guarantees for the Russian Federation President 
-- which, according to Duma Deputy Chairman Mikhail Mityukov, 
originated within the Legislation Committee, was however 
assessed by this committee members as untimely. 
  The committee session also examined another draft law of 
similar content: On State Guarantees to Top Officials. Both 
bills were "promoted" at the Duma Council session by deputy 
speaker Mikhail Mityukov who nonetheless denied authorship. At 
the same time, Mityukov believes that such a law has a right to 
exist because at the present moment, according to him, the 
president's salary is approximately 400,000 rubles, that is, 
below the deputies'. The draft establishes it at a level of 
triple a ministerial salary. 
  Vladimir Isakov, chairman of the Legislation Committee, 
assessed the bill as a possible provocation. In his opinion, a 
wide discussion of the "juridically absolutely illiterate 
document" can lead to the Duma's being charged with trying to 
bring Boris Yeltsin's retirement closer (the draft envisions the 
president's pension at 80 percent of his monthly monetary 
allowance). 
  To avoid a scandal, the committee, after considering the 
drafts, decided to wait and watch the reaction of factions and 
parliamentary committees. The committee's decision may have 
also been influenced by the fact that the anonymous law was 
supposed to take effect from 1 April 1994.

<F P=106> [Gleb Cherkasov report under the "Discussion" rubric: </F>
"Draft Russian Federation Labor Code Unveiled to Public. No 
One Likes It"] 
  [Text] A "roundtable" to discuss a draft Russian Federation 
Labor Code took place at the Trade and Industry Chamber 
yesterday. Taking part in the meeting were Federal Assembly 
deputies, officials of the president's and government's staffs, 
representatives of business circles and trade unions, as well as 
law scientists. 
  The draft code was presented by Sergey Panin, chief of the 
Ministry of Labor legal administration. According to Mr. Panin, 
the drafters tried to take into account all suggestions and 
critical amendments that had come in after the fundamentals of 
the Labor Code had been discussed. At the present stage the 
draft law consists of three parts: the Principles of the 
Russian Federation Labor Legislation; Minimum State Guarantees 
of Russian Federation Citizens' Labor Rights; and Protection of 
Workers' Labor Rights. 
  In accordance with the text of the draft, "the main 
objective 
of state policy in the sphere of socio-labor relations is the 
provision for every able-bodied person of conditions making it 
possible for him to maintain the necessary living standard by 
his work." The code incorporates the principle of delimitation 
of powers between the central bodies and the power structures of 
Federation components in the field of regulation of socio-labor 
relations, outlines the fundamental rights and duties of the 
employee and the employer, and envisions mechanisms for the 
resolution of labor conflicts. Mr. Panin deemed it necessary to 
point to the fact that an "appreciable lowering" of the level of 
social guarantees compared to the previous legislation indicated 
in the text of the draft does not signify their real lowering, 
while this only makes the social protection mechanism more 
specific and streamlined. 
  At the same time, participants in the discussion subjected 
the draft to sharp and largely scathing criticism, pointing out 
its inconsistency and unconstructiveness. A degree of summing 
up was done by Valeriy Rastorguyev, spokesman for the Federation 
Council social policy committee, who pointed to the fact that in 
its present shape the Russian Federation Labor Code had small 
chances of passing through both chambers of the Federation 
Assembly.

  [Text] Petrozavodsk April 17 TASS -- Viktor Stepanov, 
chairman of the local parliament in Russia's northwestern 
Republic of Karelia, was elected on Sunday head of the 
republic's executive branch, according to preliminary results of 
elections to Karelia's new power structures. Local observers 
believe that the post of head of government to be occupied by 
Stepanov is very similar to that of president as for its powers. 
Elections were also held to a new two-chamber local parliament, 
the Legislative Assembly. The parliament is to consist of 61 
lawmakers. Apart from this, residents in Karelia's cities, 
towns and districts voted for candidates to local governing 
bodies. 
  At the moment, election officials are counting votes at 
polling stations. According to preliminary information, the 
average turnout across the republic made up slightly over 40 per 
cent, while only 35 per cent are required for elections to be 
valid. 
  Foreign observers of Vermont, as well as representatives of 
various parties and movements said the polls were 
well-organized. No irregularities were reported.

Criminal Code is outdated and still rooted in socialism, whereas 
society has long been trying to adopt a capitalist way of life. 
The new Moscow Criminal Investigation Administration chief is

  [Text] Kaliningrad, Russia, Apr 15, BNS -- Yuri Matochkin, 
head of the Kaliningrad region's administration, may soon be 
given full-scale authorizations to hold talks with Lithuania on 
Russia's behalf. At a press conference in Kaliningrad, 
Matochkin said such authorizations were promised at his meeting 
with Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin in Moscow this 
week. 
  Commenting on relations with Lithuania, Matochkin said 
Russia 
introduces "strict requirements" for Lithuania this year. He 
noted, however, that Russia's policy may be milder if Lithuania 
treats Kaliningrad in a more favorable way. In his words, the 
region already made its move with respect to Lithuania. 
Matochkin said "further advancement" and a more favorable trade 
status for Lithuania in the greater Russia will be possible only 
then. Matochkin said this year the region will focus on the 
development of its relations with Scandinavian and Baltic 
countries. 
  Discussing a scheduled visit to Kaliningrad April 19 by the 
German finance minister, Matochkin said the visit was arranged 
on the initiative of the German side. "We will not ask anything 
from Germans, we will only suggest," he said. "As regards 
credits, we already have three foreign credit lines for 50, 8 
and 10 million dollars," but he declined to specify any 
potential creditors.

<F P=106> [Boris Vinogradov report: "Germans Move to Kaliningrad"] </F>
  [Text] The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs is receiving 
letters from Germany, whose authors describe themselves as the 
heirs and descendants of Germans living pre-1945 on the 
territory of Eastern Prussia, now Kaliningrad Oblast. They want 
to know if lost property can be reclaimed, and if so, then on 
what terms. 
  Smolensk Square is leaving the messages unanswered, but the 
Germans' interest in the given theme is becoming increasingly 
ardent as a treaty between Kaliningrad and Moscow is under 
preparation in the depths of the Russian Parliament. It is 
expected that it will be a treaty like the one recently 
concluded by the center with Kazan. 
  On this score, parliamentarians hold two points of view: 
Some are in favor of bolstering the enclave's independence; 
others fear that it will drift too far into the ocean of 
autonomy. Under Boris Yeltsin's edict, the oblast has existed 
under the regime of a free economic zone for over a year 
already, attracting attention not only from the children and 
grandchildren of Prussian barons. 
  In February, at a session of the European Parliament in 
Strasbourg, a resolution was adopted within the context of which 
Kaliningrad was accorded a special place in relations between 
Russia and the European Community. Magdalene Hoff, chairman of 
the Commission for Relations with the CIS, having visited 
Kaliningrad recently, put forward the idea of transforming it 
into an autonomous territorial unit and, ultimately, into a 
fourth independent Baltic state. The question of international 
monitoring of the oblast and the creation of a kind of 
condominium is being examined by way of one option. 
  The resolution's authors are insisting on the question's 
inclusion on the agenda of the talks on Russia's membership in 
the Council of Europe. In a conversation with European 
Parliament Speaker Egon Klepsch, a German, Andrey Kozyrev 
expressed displeasure in connection with the document's 
appearance and indicated that he views it as an attempt to 
intervene in domestic affairs. 
  Germany vows fidelity to the treaties with Russia, and says 
that it is not thinking about recovering property. However, the 
specter of "Germanization" haunts the imaginations of those 
Russians in Kaliningrad who are prey to feeling "cut off from 
the family." The national patriots are exploiting the vague 
sense of uncertainty to their own political ends. 
  In terms of volume of investments in the oblast's economy, 
the FRG has far outstripped all foreign investors, taking second 
place behind Poland in respect of the number of joint ventures. 
The government in Bonn allocates finance, equipment, and 
construction materials to Germans moving to Kaliningrad in far 
greater quantities than to Germans in the Volga Region or 
Siberia. Incidentally, in a Russian Government decree on aid to 
refugees and persons forcibly resettled from the CIS, there is 
no mention at all of Kaliningrad among other Russian cities, as 
if the road there has already been closed to them. To these 
ends, the oblast does not receive any subsidies from the center. 
But Germans go there willingly. There are already around 
15,000 of them there. Sponsors from Germany are helping them to 
buy land and put down roots. 
  A German-language newspaper entitled KOENIGSBURG EXPRESS is 
available in the city. The firm "Rossbahn" is bulding a highway 
to Berlin. By the end of this year, the 40-kilometer section to 
the Polish Border will be complete. And there is also a boom in 
"nostalgia" tourism for Germans who lived in Koenigsburg before 
1945. From the border, tourists are conveyed by an old steam 
locomotive. The cars and compartments are done out in "retro" 
style. The current spring-summer season promises to be busy.

<F P=106> [N. Prokofyeva video report from Chita; from the "Utro" </F>
program] 
  [Text] [Prokofyeva] We have become wiser now and we know 
that if a number is attached to the name of a city it means it 
is a closed facility of military significance. We are in 
Chita-46, the home of missile forces. It was here that some of 
the missiles were destroyed in the presence of U.S. observers. 
How many remain? Naturally we do not have an answer to this 
question, but of course the most modern ones, the latest 
generation remain. Here in the forest one of the missiles was 
stored in a special silo. We also do not know where the 
remaining ones are stored today. 
  Strange incompatible things seem to coexist in our lives 
today. Right here in the forest you can also find the hothouses 
where the military and their families grow vegetables and 
potatoes to survive. If previously, towns of this sort had a 
special status and received special supplies, now this is no 
longer true, and wages are being delayed here just like 
everywhere else. One can probably get used to anything, even to 
the fact that your neighbors are missiles with nuclear warheads. 
Nevertheless, people want guarantees of their safety and of 
their children. This is understandable. 
  [Begin recording] [Prokofyeva] What safety guarantees are 
there? 
  [V.A. Kornauk, head of the town's administration] Safety 
guarantees lie in the reliability of our weapons, the work of 
high-class specialists, and the fact that work is carried out in 
strict accordance with instructions and by people who know their 
job. Any danger to the surrounding population, as I know and 
understand it, is excluded. [end recording] 
  [Prokofyeva] However physicians have their own opinion on 
this score. Facilities of this sort were always under the 
control of the Third Main Administration of the Ministry of 
Health which dealt with professionals. Neither medical services 
nor rural, rayon, or city physicians had access to their 
information. This was the reason for numerous tragedies around 
such places as Semipalatinsk, Chelyabinsk, Novaya Zemlya, and 
other similar places, and there are more of them in Russia than 
we know. 
  [Begin recording] [Prokofyeva] Aleksey Yakovlevich, so you 
feel the radiation situation is a real problem? 
  [A. Ya. Miloserdov, chief state medical physician of Chita 
Oblast] The first domestic uranium was mined in our oblast and 
an underground nuclear explosion was carried out in our oblast 
in the past. Two military districts operate in our oblast with 
all the subsequent consequences, and according to our data about 
220 natural radioactive anomalies have been established in our 
oblast. Scientists of the Siberian branch of the Russian 
Academy of Medical Sciences worked here recently and they found 
that the people of Baley city, for example, have considerable 
depressed health reserves. In particular abnormalities are 
common as well as problems with cancer and immune deficiencies. 
If you compare immunology charts of people who live in the 
Semipalatinsk test range region with those here, the local ones 
are much worse. This is why together with the Committee for 
Ecology and the oblast administration we have formed a program 
of urgent measures to normalize the radiation situation. This 
program has passed its first expert examination in the Ministry 
of Ecology and it has been mostly approved. We are now 
completing it and will present it to the expert commission for 
adoption. This should give us the necessary funds. I think 
questions of rehabilitation of ill people in these regions will 
also be addressed. In particular, we must very seriously and 
comprehensively work out a plan for the rehabilitation of 
children from these places. [end recording]

  [Text] The radioactive situation in the Tomsk region, where 
the Siberian chemical plant is situated, is very complex; 
several territories are contaminated with Plutonium-239 and 240 
as a result of numerous discharges from this enterprise, Marina 
Khotuleva, expert of the Radioecological Research Center of the 
Social-ecological union, declared to Interfax. 
  In her words, contamination of territories located nearby 
the 
Siberian chemical plant in Tomsk-7 exceeds the background 
contamination several times, in some places it is 3000 
becquerels per sq.meter. "Discharges of radioactive water from 
the plant into the Tom' river have resulted in its contamination 
with radionuclides Cobalt-60, Zinc-65, Manganese-54," said 
Khotuleva. 
  As she said, the Radioecological Research Center conducted 
an 
independent investigation of the consequences of the accident at 
the Siberian chemical plant which occurred on April 6, 1993 and 
found out that the territory was additionally contaminated with 
a short life cycle radionuclides, Ruthenium-103, Niobium-95, and 
Cerium-144. 
  Ecologists are concerned over the fact that liquid 
radioactive wastes are being pumped into the underground water 
layers for storage for a long time already. As Khotuleva 
declared, a total of 40 Mn cubic meters of liquid wastes, 
including those which contain plutonium have been pumped under 
the ground since early fifties till now. "Nobody can rule out 
possibility that these radioactive materials can appear in 
reservoirs and in water supply systems intended for drinking," 
said she.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Shanayev] </F>
  [Text] Vladikavkaz April 15 TASS--The two-day second round 
of North Ossetian-Ingush summit negotiations ended in Nalchik 
today after discussing a draft agreement on principles, measures 
and time to implement the Russian president's decree "On 
Procedure of Return of Refugees and Forced Migrants to Places of 
Their Permanent Residence in Northern Ossetia and Ingushetia". 
  The sides have discussed the document's preamble and the 
first article. The Ossetian side suggested to have the 
following wording of the first article "The parties to the 
agreement confirm the status of the Prigorodny region as a 
territory of the North Ossetian Republic in accordance with a 
decree of the Russian president of December 13, 1993, and voice 
their refusal from any territorial claims on each other and a 
third party". 
  In the opinion of the Ingush side, the Prigorodny region 
belongs to Ingushetia as ethnic Ingushes populated the area 
before deportation. 
  A break in negotiations has been announced. The date of the 
next meeting in Nalchik will be announced later. The North 
Ossetian and Ingush working groups and experts in Vladikavkaz 
and Nazran will continue to elaborate articles of the draft 
agreement.

  [Text] Vladikavkaz April 17 TASS -- "A way to accord 
between the peoples of North Ossetia and Ingushetia is hard, but 
we must move towards it," North Ossetia President Akhsarbek 
Galazov said. Addressing members of North Ossetia government 
and parliament leaders in Vladikavkaz on Saturday, Galazov spoke 
about the results of the second round of talks between the 
presidents and official delegations of North Ossetia and 
Ingushetia in Nalchik, capital of neighbouring Kabardino-Balkar 
Republic. 
  Galazov said the talks were difficult and centered on the 
draft agreement on the principles, measures and terms of the 
implementation of Russian President Boris Yeltsin's decree 
establishing the procedure for returning refugees and displaced 
persons to North Ossetia and Ingushetia. 
  Disagreements over who should control the disputed 
Prigorodny 
district were the "stumbling block" at the talks. North Ossetia 
claims the district is its integral part, while Ingushetia 
insists that the district belongs to it because it was inhabited 
by Ingushes before they were deported in 1944. 
  Galasov stressed that "the question of border redrawing in 
the northern Caucasus must be removed from the agenda because 
territorial claims may lead to a new tragedy in Russia's south." 
  The two republics will resume talks after April 25 when the 
Federation Council, the upper house of Russia's new parliament, 
holds debates on the situation in the region and ways to 
stabilise it. 
  The North Ossetian leader noted that the sides have reached 
"progress in normalising relations between the peoples of the 
two republics and dispelled pessimistic forecasts that the 
dialogue in Nalchik would end in a deadlock." "The leadership 
of North Ossetia is ready to carry out the decree of the Russian 
president," he said.

  [Text] Vladikavkaz April 17 TASS--Russian troops loyal to 
the temporary administration have begun a large-scale operation, 
removing mines on the North Ossetian territory where a state of 
emergency remains in effect. Lieutenant-General Vladimir 
Kulakov, commander of the Vladikavkaz military garrison, told 
ITAR-TASS that field engineers have been instructed to draw a 
chart of mine fields within a week and check the safety of 
economic facilities, transport thoroughfares and gas pipelines. 
  Several incidents were reported in the Prigorodny region, 
where agricultural machinery and several agricultural workers 
exploded on mines planted by terrorists. Military sources say 
that the situation in North Ossetia where a state of emergency 
was extended until May 31, remains rather complex, but kept 
under control by Russian peace-keeping forces and local law 
enforcement bodies. 
  Local observers believe that a second round of talks held in 
Nalchik by North Ossetian President Akhsarbek Galazov and Ingush 
President Ruslan Aushev gave a certain impetus, helping to 
relieve tension in the Prigorodny region. 
  Local observers believe that a discussion of problems of 
stabilisation in the region expected to be held by the Russian 
Federation Council and the Russian Security Council in the 
context of the Russian president's decree on the return of 
refugees will help to disentangle a difficult knot of 
international problems. 
  Akhsarbek Galazov met with commander of a special Caucasian 
border guard district, Lieutenant-General Viktor Zemtsov, the 
press service of the North Ossetian president reported on 
Sunday. During the meeting the sides discussed a number of 
problems connected with reinforcing Russia's southern borders. 
The talks were attended by North and South Ossetian government 
officials who expressed concern about the fact that the 
introduction of the network of border-check points on the 
Transcaucasian road will remove a "transparent border", which 
will impede integration processes between the two republics in 
the area of science, economy and culture.

  [Text] Moscow, 16 Apr (ITAR-TASS) -- Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin signed an edict on Friday instructing the Russian 
Government to hold consultations with representatives of the 
state authorities and all the political movements of the Chechen 
Republic to find a way out of the existing sociopolitical 
situation. 
  On the basis of these consultations, a draft treaty will be 
drawn up on demarcating areas of jurisdiction between the 
federal state authorities and the Chechen authorities and on a 
mutual delegating of powers.

  [Text] Groznyy April 17 TASS -- Chechnya praised the 
Russian leadership for seeking a peaceful solution to the social 
and political crisis in the North Caucasian republic. Chechen 
President Dzhokhar Dudayev told TASS on Sunday that his analysts 
were thoroughly studying the decree by Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin, which instructs the Russian Government to hold 
necessary consultations with the Chechen side. The republic's 
government will gather in an extraordinary meeting tonight to 
make an official return statement by the Chechen leadership. 
  The analysis of the current situation in Chechnya gives 
shows 
that the republican authorities are likely to search for a 
mutually acceptable solution to the Chechen problem [sentence as 
received]. Talks may stumble over demands that Chechnya 
recognize itself a subject of the Russian Federation, as well as 
over Russia's repeated appeals to forces in opposition to 
President Dudayev.

  [Text] Groznyy April 17 TASS -- Yaragi Mamodayev, head of 
the Chechen Government of People's Confidence which is in 
opposition to the republic's current authorities, called upon 
the leaders of all political forces and movements to achieve 
national conciliation with an aim to work out a single position 
at the upcoming talks with Russia. 
  Commenting on the decree by President Boris Yeltsin, 
instructing the Russian Government to resume consultations with 
the Chechen side in order to overcome the present social and 
political crisis, the Chechen opposition leader said on Sunday: 
"This document, confirming the commitment by the Russian 
leadership to a political settlement of our differences, gives a 
historical chance to the Chechen people. But under the current 
confrontation within Chechen society, we cannot seize this 
chance and take a civilized path of building our statehood. 
Those who do not understand this or consciously oppose the 
process of national reconciliation are taking an anti-popular 
stand". 
  Mamodayev said his government of people's confidence 
believes 
that Russia's attempts to contact not only with Chechen 
President Dzhokhar Dudayev but also with his political opponents 
threatened to mount political confrontation in the republic and 
complicate the fragile negotiating process. For this reason, we 
urge all our compatriots not to divide themselves into Dudayev's 
supporters and opponents but to subordinate their personal or 
corporate ambitions to the national interests in order to pull 
the long-suffering Chechen Republic out of the general crisis, 
the leader emphasised. 
  Mamodayev is convinced that none of the political movements 
or groups can reflect the will of the whole people. With this 
in view, we suggest convening a Congress of the Chechen People 
in the near future and work out a single attitude towards 
relations between Russia and Chechnya, he said in conclusion.

  [Text] Boris Yeltsin is the sole and last stronghold of 
legality in Russia but he might be removed from power soon, 
Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev is reported saying at the 
state government's meeting Thursday. Dudayev thought that what 
he described as "certain elite circles in the Russian 
leadership" might make next May the decisive time for Russia. 
  Dudayev said that the Russian leadership consisted of 
factions, each playing its own game, and that his government 
felt this as it tried to have talks on a Russian-Chechen treaty. 
He added that some Russian politicos went as far as negotiating 
with the Chechen opposition. "It would be logical if we 
responded by making contacts with those who oppose the Russian 
leaders but we do not do so for ethical reasons," Dudayev said. 
  Meanwhile, an informed source in the Chechen leadership told 
Interfax that Dudayev was under pressure to discontinue the 
Russo-Chechen talks until an authority emerged in Russia which 
would have the situation under its full control.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Irina Shchegoleva and Mikhail </F>
Shevtsov] 
  [Text] Sochi April 15 TASS -- The government of Abkhazia 
has called on the Georgian armed groups, operating in the upper 
part of the Kodor Gorge, to stop hostilities and lay down arms. 
The Abkhazian side, with the participation of U.N. inspectors, 
guarantees the lives and safety of the Georgian groups withdrawn 
from the area. Otherwise, the government of Abkhazia will take 
measures to neutralise "the armed gangs", says a statement 
released by the Abkhazian government today. 
  ITAR-TASS has learned from officials of the press service of 
the Abkhazian Supreme Soviet that this statement was released 
due to the recently increased activity of Georgian armed gangs 
in the Kodor Gorge and in some villages of the Gali district. 
Abkhazian sources report on mortar attacks on the village of 
Lata and raids of armed gangs on the village of Ganakhleba, Gali 
district, which claimed the lives of four men. Several people 
were abducted and their whereabouts are unknown. The Abkhazian 
side believes that such provocations are a violation of the 
Moscow agreements on political measures to settle the 
Georgian-Abkhazian conflict, that they seriously destabilise the 
situation and are intended to torpedo the peaceful negotiations 
and preparations for the repatriation of refugees. 
  The Abkhazian government has announced its readiness to 
ensure the safe evacuation of these groups from the territory of 
the republic if they laid down their arms. 
  In light of the latest developments, the parliament of the 
Abkhazian Republic requested the Russian president and the State 
Duma on Friday not to ratify the Russo-Georgian treaty until the 
Georgian-Abkhazian conflict is fully settled.

<F P=106> [Report by V. Kostomarov: "NATO General Harry Johnson: </F>
`Like Most Soldiers, I Am Happily Married'"] 
  [Excerpt] Kaliningrad Oblast was the last stopover in the 
tour of Harry Johnson, commander in chief of NATO forces in the 
North European theater of war operations. Prior to that, he 
visited Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Severomorsk (Murmansk 
Oblast). 
  On the final day of his visit, the British general toured 
Baltiysk where he familiarized himself with the crews of the 
patrol boat "Nesokrushimiy" and the squadron torpedo boat 
"Nastoychiviy." On board the latter vessel, Harry Johnson and 
Vice Admiral Viktor Kravchenko, first Baltic Fleet deputy 
commander, who accompanied the general, answered journalists' 
questions. 
  [Journalist] You managed to spend very little time in the 
Baltic Fleet. Nevertheless, how do you assess the level of 
constructiveness in the talks with its command? 
  [Johnson] This is my first visit to the Baltic Fleet. 
However, my first meeting with Admiral Vladimir Yegorov, 
current Baltic Fleet commander, took place 18 months ago in St. 
Petersburg. In the presence of the press, I would like to 
express my gratitude for the sincere and extremely warm welcome 
that was given to me by the fleet command, Vice Admiral 
Kravchenko, its first deputy commander, and all officers who 
worked with our delegation. We had a good opportunity to visit 
two combat ships. We were favorably impressed with their 
equipment with the most up-to-date arms, and with its 
maintenance. 
  You have asked me about cooperation that the future has in 
store for us. Actually, this cooperation has already begun. 
This year, a Baltic Fleet ship will participate in joint NATO 
maneuvers under the coded name "Baltic Operation `94." During 
the visit, we conveyed the invitation to Baltic Fleet Commander 
Admiral Yegorov to attend the exercise of missile boats as an 
observer, which are scheduled for this year. 
  During our stay in Moscow and meetings with General Colonel 
Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of the general staff of the Russian 
Armed Forces, and Admiral Feliks Gromov, commander in chief of 
the Russian Fleet, as well as with the Baltic Fleet command, we 
saw that their attitude toward our cooperation was highly 
favorable. Our current key goal is to work out the details of 
interaction under the circumstances of reduced finances, which 
is a pressing issue for both parties. It is these technical 
details that I, as well as the officers of my staff, are engaged 
in today. This is the key goal of our visit here. 
  Let me express my views as a soldier and commander in chief 
of NATO forces in Northern Europe. It is the naval forces that 
have a great potential for the development of our cooperation. 
Our aim is to turn the zones of the Baltic and North Seas into 
a region of true cooperation and interaction. 
  [Journalist] As you know, Russian Defense Minister General 
Pavel Grachev visited this area recently. He referred to the 
implementation of the idea about the creation of the so-called 
special defense region in Kaliningrad Oblast in the immediate 
future. You happen to be the first foreign guest after the 
defense minister's visit. Could you, as a military person, 
express your attitude toward this idea? 
  [Johnson] Unfortunately, I have no information about the 
decisions that Russian Defense Minister Grachev adopted here 
concerning the establishment of some special defense region in 
Kaliningrad. However, this oblast is part of Russia, and it is 
a matter of this country, its government and the defense 
ministry to introduce such a defense regime which they deem 
necessary. Even if I had some information, this is neither my 
business nor my right to discuss and comment on decisions 
adopted by the Russian Defense Ministry. 
  [Journalist] You just returned from a ship, the commander of 
which has said that the crew will shortly participate in the 
NATO exercise "Baltop `94." I would like to hear something from 
the two military leaders about the perspective of our 
cooperation. 
  [Johnson] I had a chance to tour a modern and well-equipped 
ship. It has made an impression on me. The crew and the 
commander are convinced of the ship's capacity to fulfill the 
set tasks. I believe that its level of equipment with 
up-to-date military facilities, guidance and navigation systems 
allows this ship to perform any tasks in such an operative group 
as the "Baltic Operation." This is a U.S. exercise, which, if 
we follow its development, is expanding its scale and becoming 
more complicated in terms of its tasks. I believe that the 
participation of Russian ships in this drill will serve for our 
closer military cooperation. 
  [Kravchenko] Any cooperation, particularly among the 
military, will bring only benefits. This year, our ships will 
visit several countries, including Finland, Belgium. and France. 
The question of whether our ships will go to the Kiel week is 
now being resolved. Here in Baltiysk, we also receive guests and 
ships from other countries. All these contacts lead to a better 
mutual understanding. The fact that a Russian ship is 
participating in a NATO exercise for the second time reflects 
the strengthening of this collaboration year by year. The time 
will come when several vessels rather than a single ship will 
take part in this enterprise. 
  [Journalist] We know the story of the establishment of NATO 
and the Warsaw Pact. The latter is already nonexistent. What 
is your opinion on the future of NATO? 
  [Johnson] The Warsaw Pact ceased to exist concurrently with 
the breakup of the Soviet Union. Contrary to this, the 
situation in NATO is slightly different. The European Union 
continues to exist. Moreover, the process of integration among 
these countries is expanding. At the same time, this leads to 
the development of NATO. This development is progressing along 
the line of defining its goals and tasks in accordance with the 
current situation. [passage omitted]

mixed reaction among the country's political forces. A group of 
Supreme Soviet deputies representing the Social Democratic Party 
turned to parliament's presidium with a demand for "carrying out 
without delay an investigation and, if necessary, instituting 
criminal proceedings against the participants in preparing and 
signing this treaty," which contravenes the constitution 
currently in force. A number of opposition parliamentarians 
also demanded that the agenda of an extraordinary session should 
include the question of resignation of Prime Minister Vyacheslav 
Kebich and members of his government "for unconstitutional 
activities." 
  The extraordinary session of parliament will take place on 
27 
April. At its closed session, which ended in the evening of 13 
April, the Supreme Soviet presidium, however, declined to 
include in its agenda a revision of the Constitution articles 
with which the signed Belarus-Russia treaty is at variance. The 
session will be devoted to electing the country's constitutional 
court. 
  The parliament head is refraining from comment on the 
agreement Prime Minister Kebich signed in Moscow on the plea 
that the question needs to be studied additionally: Pressing 
for an urgent conclusion of a financial alliance at any price, 
Mr. Kebich clearly went beyond the bounds he had set himself and 
that were agreed on by parliament leaders. The upcoming 
presidential elections introduce an added nuance. It is still 
unknown whether Speaker Mechislaw Hryb is going to run. He was 
restrained about the signed agreement and instructed 
parliamentary commissions to see to which extent it corresponds 
with the Constitution. 
  The deputies will inevitably raise the problem of merging 
the 
two countries' monetary systems at the 27 April extraordinary 
parliament session. The majority in the Supreme Soviet will 
clearly back the agreement and will be ready to amend the 
Constitution then and there. The examination of this question 
will be postponed, however, (most probably on the prime 
minister's insistence) to see what the people think about it. 
The voting is planned to coincide with the 23 June presidential 
elections. Vyacheslav Kebich hopes that the elections will 
demonstrate sweeping popular support for his course of 
convergence with Russia, and therefore, whatever their upshot, 
he would remain at the helm of the Executive Branch for at least 
as long as this parliament's powers last. The election campaign 
for potential presidential candidates will officially start in 
Belorussia on 15 April. Already under way is the registration 
of initiative groups that are gathering signatures, and the 
formation of electoral commissions.

diplomatic correspondents Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy and 
others] 
  [Text] In response to INTERFAX's question on whether 
agreement on the merger of the Russian and Belarusian monetary 
systems translated into a move toward a confederation of the two 
republics, Belarusian Foreign Minister Piotr Krawchanka said 
existing legal regulations were what counted most at this stage. 
  The Belarusian constitution provided for the existence of a 
National Bank and, Krawchanka said, before the Belarusian 
parliament moved to amend the fundamental law, the idea of a 
merger would have a hard time in Belarus. But, let's not put 
the cart before the horse, he said, it was yet difficult to say 
how exactly the merger agreement would work. 
  The removal of the first problems on the road for the 
effective realization of Russian and Belarusian economic plans 
was what counted most and spelled a big success for the 
Belarusian Cabinet and its Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich, 
Krawchanka said.

  [Text] The Chairman of the Belarusian Parliament Mechyslaw 
Hryb shows no enthusiasm on plans to amend the national 
constitution in a bid to realize the 12 April agreement on the 
merger of the Russian and Belarusian monetary systems. 
  In an exclusive interview with INTERFAX Hryb said it was 
impossible to amend the fundamental law on the first day after 
its introduction, if it cost the national legislature more than 
two years of hard work to phrase it. On 15 April Hryb and Prime 
Minister Vyacheslav Kebich met in Moscow with Russian head of 
government Viktor Chernomyrdin. They agreed, said Hryb, that 
Article 5 of the merger agreement would be amended in keeping 
with the Belarusian Constitution. 
  Under Article 5, the assets and liabilities of the National 
Bank of Belarus make part of the assets and liabilities of the 
Central Bank of Russia. That lays a groundwork for the merger 
of the Russian and Belarusian monetary systems. On 12 April, 
Stanislav Bogdankevich of the Belarusian Bank agreed to sign the 
merger agreement only if the objections in principle against 
Article 5 were taken into consideration. He said that under 
Belarus' new constitution the National Bank emerged as the 
central bank of a sovereign country. 
  Hryb also opposed Kebich's proposal for a nationwide 
referendum on the merger of thee Russian and Belarusian monetary 
systems. In Hryb's view, a referendum would confuse the 
Belarusians. The decision to call a referendum rested 
exclusively with the Belarusian parliament. 
  Hryb made it clear that his objections were not intended to 
spark a conflict between himself and Kebich, let alone a 
conflict between the Legislative and Executive Branches of 
power. What he said should not be seen in the context of a new 
electoral campaign.

<F P=106> [Report by Vasiliy Romanovskiy: "Serbian Brothers, Our </F>
Hearts Are With You"] 
  [Text] Yesterday, representatives of the Belaya Rus Slavic 
Assembly, the Officers' Union, the Communist Party of Belarus, 
the Movement for Democracy, Social Progress, and Justice, and 
other social organizations gathered by the U.S. Embassy in Minsk 
to protest the bombing of Serbian positions by U.S. Air Force 
fighters. The picketers -- who came armed with the slogans 
"Serbian brothers, our hearts are with you," "Yankee go home; 
Serbian soil will burn under your feet," and "Belarusians demand 
punishment for killing our brothers in Yugoslavia" -- burned a 
symbolic U.S. flag and passed a statement to embassy officials 
addressed to the U.S. President and American people, which reads: 
  "We are filled with indignation over the barbaric U.S. 
bombardment of civilian targets in Yugoslavia. With great 
anxiety over the fate of the world, we protest against this 
inhuman policy. All attempts on the part of Belarusian society 
to prevent this insane step have been left unanswered by the 
U.S. administration, which does not want to listen to the voice 
of reason. The Slavic world will not leave this act of 
vandalism unanswered. 
  ``The war in Yugoslavia has testified to the entire world 
that the freedom-loving Serbian people are unvanquished, and 
that military intervention will only lead to the outbreak of a 
new world war... Stop before it is too late!'' 
  "This quite unlawful action," Nikolay Sergeyev, cochairman 
of 
the Slav Assembly Duma, told a VECHERNIY MINSK correspondent, 
"testifies to the fact that the United States is assuming more 
and more the role of the world's gendarme with the right to 
intervene in the affairs of sovereign states and people, if, 
from the [U.S.] point of view, the behavior of those people does 
not comply with the [U.S.] aspirations to introduce `a new world 
order.' Unfortunately, the United Nations is turning into an 
assistant of these hegemonic aspirations of the United States. 
  "Furthermore, we believe that the Republic of Belarus should 
establish diplomatic relations with the Federative Republic of 
Yugoslavia in the near future, and render feasible assistance to 
the Serbian people in their just fight against the so-called 
forces of the world community. 
  "We draw the attention of the Supreme Soviet and Belarusian 
Government to the ever growing NATO threat to the national 
interests of our country, and we believe that Belarus should by 
no means join the NATO-projected Partnership for Peace..." 
  The Belarusian Committee of Solidarity with Serbs and 
Montenegrins has also condemned the pillage of the U.S. military 
in Yugoslavia.

Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus," the activity of any 
parties, sociopolitical movements, and other other organizations

<F P=106> [Article by Syerhey Plytkevich: "23 June Is Around the </F>
Corner, And Everyone Should Determine Their Position"] 
  [Text] Since 15 March, Belarus is a presidential republic. 
It is expected that the president, who will be elected on 23 
June or a bit later by a popular vote, will become head of the 
state and the executive power. Paradoxically, however, the new 
Constitution left the soviets that -- at least in the hinterland 
-- will continue to hold sway, as they did in the past. As no 
presidential structures are envisioned so far for the country's 
regions, it would take a lot of optimism to expect that the 
introduction of the presidency will bring only good things to 
our people. The example of Russia, showing what confrontation 
between Executive and Legislative Branches can lead to, is only 
too vivid, but you do not even have to go as far as Russia! In 
other former Soviet republics that introduced presidential rule, 
changing the government system is conducted with great 
difficulties. 
  What is it that Belarus expects? With the most probable 
presidential candidates already known, this can be predicted 
even today. Knowing those candidates and the forces standing 
behind them, one can predict with a great dose of probability to 
what the victory of any of them will lead. 
  In an article "About `Bison,' `Mice,' and Gorbachev's 
Shadow," published in NARODNAYA GAZETA of 22 February, 1994, I 
spoke out on why the majority in the Supreme Soviet chose this 
particular time to introduce the presidency in the Republic, and 
why the Belarusian Popular Front opposition, the free trade 
unions, and the striking committees attempted to stage a 
nationwide political strike in February of this year. As we 
know, the attempt fizzled out, but the Republic's leadership, 
supported by the legislative majority, did reach its goals. The 
scenario that I predicted before has already started to unfold 
-- in what might prove a very risky undertaking, the party of 
power is now attempting to strengthen its power. It needs its 
own president. Its main candidate is Belarusian Prime Minister 
Vyacheslav Kebich. In the words of certain parliamentary 
deputies, a collection of deputies' signatures in his favor has 
already gotten under way. In addition, we received phone calls 
from several places and learned that the callers were 
intensively instructed to set up initiating groups to support 
Vyacheslav Kebich as the candidate for president. 
  As a matter of fact, there will be nothing reprehensible 
about this if such groups emerge voluntarily, but it would be a 
different thing if they are forged by directives, forcing 
officials, whose fate is now in the hands of the Cabinet of 
Ministers and rayon and oblast executive councils, to enter 
them. That would be the case of blatant pressuring and an 
attempt to influence the citizens' free choice. However, there 
is no need to repeat all this right now, because our state has 
always exerted pressure on its citizens; and it would be naive 
to think that this will change during the first presidential 
election in independent Belarus. Of course, all opponents of 
Kebich are perfectly aware of this fact, and are bracing up for 
heavy fighting. It was not by accident that the legislative 
majority, pressing for the soonest possible election of the 
president, wished to break its promise to hold early elections 
to the Supreme Soviet in March 1994. The explanation is simple 
-- under control of the Cabinet of Ministers, they will elect 
their new president in June, and then, under control of the 
president, hold legislative elections. This would not violate 
the democratic procedures and will leave power in the hands of 
previous wielders. 
  This will happen if Vyacheslav Kebich emerges as a victor in 
the presidential elections. His present moves show where he is 
going to lead the Republic. 
  I am not sure about all the Belarusian people, but this 
outcome is most desirable for the Cabinet of Ministers and the 
legislative majority. 
  What if Belarusian Supreme Soviet Chairman Mechyslaw Hryb 
joins the race for the presidential seat? Although this 
prospect cannot be ruled out, the question is how realistic is 
his victory? However, this would set a remarkable precedent 
when local executive bodies would have to make decisions on 
their own, instead of waiting for instructions from on high. In 
this case, the elections would be more democratic. Even if Hryb 
lost, he would forever go down in Belarusian history as a man 
who tried to remove pressure from the electorate. The future 
will show whether Mr. Hryb will decide to make this move. 
  And what will happen if deputy Alyaksandr Lukashenka wins 
the 
elections? Although Mr. Lukashenka is a very complex figure, 
he is resolutely proceeding toward his goal. He is quite 
respected by Belarusian citizens, and... spurned both by leftist 
and rightist forces. Remember an amendment proposed by Vasiliy 
Chepik, member of the Popular Movement, saying that the 
president should be at least 45 years old, not 35? Alyaksandr 
Lukashenka is 39, and is open about his intention to fight for 
the presidential post. It is clear that the amendment was 
targeted at him in the first place. It was voted down, though. 
It was supported both by far left candidates and by deputies 
working in the Cabinet of Ministers. A paradox? Not at all. It 
is just that everyone fears Lukashenka's unpredictability; and 
state officials understand very well that once Lukashenka is 
elected, many of them will have a difficult life. 
  However, Belarus will experience an even more uncertain 
situation if Stanislav Shushkevich, Gennadiy Karpenko, or Zyanon 
Paznyak will be elected president. All of them will find 
themselves in a bind if they win the election. First, the 
Constitution does not give the Belarusian president too many 
rights and powers. Second, a democratic Belarusian president 
will have an alienated parliament, not to mention the Cabinet of 
Ministers. You cannot fire everyone -- go and try to figure out 
which of the Cabinet of Ministers' employees is capable of 
working in new conditions! So, we might have a real but 
absolutely powerless president; or, there will be a 
confrontation between him and the parliament and local executive 
council leadership. Most important, in spite of the activation 
of the Belarusian Constitutional Court, these conflicts would be 
practically irresolvable, perpetuating anarchy and a lack of 
responsibility. 
  This outcome was forecasted by the opposition deputies. This 
is why they had called for the reformation of local authorities 
-- the Soviet power is incompatible with the presidential one, 
but the [legislative] majority did not hear them. Obviously, it 
was confident that a puppet of the Cabinet of Ministers will 
become president, leaving no room for conflicts. 
  Alas, life teaches us that even the most promising and easy 
plans sometimes fall through at the last moment, and then, 
disappointed, we curse ourselves for our own improvidence. 
  But still, a reader might ask, if all of the possible 
outcomes of the presidential election are so bleak, for whom 
should I vote? I am not going to campaign for anyone here. I 
know that all Belarusian citizens want to live better, but what 
does it mean to live better? To live the kind of life we had a 
decade ago, having a guaranteed piece of bread and sausage, and 
thinking this was the best that could have happened to us? Or, 
to live as people do in civilized countries, experiencing true 
freedom and really enjoying life? We had been thinking about 
our socialist Motherland, cutting back on our salaries to buy 
furniture or a car, and hoping that our children will be 
happier. Those on top of the power had been thinking about 
themselves, working for big money, and vacationing all over the 
world. 
  So, a better life can mean different things. We hope that 
most Belarusian citizens look ahead, into the future. If so, we 
need a president who would lead the Republic in this very 
direction. If he reflects opinions of most of the people, we 
should fear no confrontation with conservative forces. 
  We will overcome everything if we want to. So, determine 
your positions, dear citizens!

<F P=106> [Report attributed to BELINFORM: "Government Undertakes </F>
Measures To Toughen Crime Combating Activities"] 
  [Text] The Belarusian Cabinet of Ministers adopted a 
resolution "On Organizational Measures To Step Up Crime 
Combating Activities." 
  The resolution states that due to the growing tension in 
society, caused by the scaled up crime and climbing corruption 
that are seriously threatening the interests and economic 
security of the state, the Cabinet of Ministers, on a commission 
from the Presidium of the Belarusian Supreme Soviet, is 
completing a draft of a state program of urgent measures to step 
up crime combating activities. 
  Taking into consideration the grounded demands of the 
population to step up crime combating activities, to increase 
the responsibility of state officials, to upgrade the management 
of the legal system in the Republic, and in order to adopt this 
document, the Belarusian Cabinet of Ministers authorized the 
Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Defense Ministry, the State 
Committee for Customs, the Chief State Tax Inspection within the 
Ministry of Finance to undertake urgent measures to prevent and 
stop office misuses in the sphere of production and distribution 
of consumer goods, to provide security of citizens in the 
streets, to uncover and confiscate firearms from people who 
illegally keep it, to prevent stealing of vehicles, theft of 
fuel and lubricants, and agricultural products during sowing and 
harvesting campaigns, and other measures that provide for the 
protection of the interests of the state, the rights and core 
interests of the citizens. 
  Mass media will report on the course and results of this 
work 
to the Belarusian Cabinet of Ministers and the population of the 
Republic every three months. 
  The Ministry of Internal Affairs during the period of 
April-June 1994 will be charged with establishing: 
  -- In oblast centers and other big cities special purpose 
militia departments to stop activities of criminal groups; 
  -- Within the Minsk City Executive Committee a special 
sector 
of internal affairs to keep public order, prevent and uncover 
crimes at markets, in hotels, and other places which give rise 
to crime. 
  The Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Chief State Tax 
Inspection within the Ministry of Finance are charged with 
forming special detachments from the personnel of these 
ministries and other interested organizations to control trading 
in consumer goods and agricultural products produced in the 
local region, to uncover concealment of profits from taxation 
and the artificial setting up of monopoly prices for goods. 
  Special detachments for combating organized and economic 
crime, visa and passport sections and information centers within 
the Ministry of Internal Affairs will receive additional 
manpower from the law enforcement agencies. Special purpose 
militia departments and militia units within internal troops 
will be established in oblast centers and other big cities. 
  The Ministry of Finance is charged with issuing considerable 
assets to the Ministry of Internal Affairs to improve the 
material and technical supply of the agencies of internal 
affairs and to increase militia manpower foreseen by this 
resolution. 
  The Ministry of Internal Affairs is charged by 1 July 1994 
to 
draft a new organizational structure of the ministries, 
departments of internal affairs within the oblast executive 
committees, Minsk City and Bobruysk Town executive committees, 
the Department of Internal Affairs for transportation issues, 
taking into account tasks of the internal affairs' officers to 
step up activities for combating crime and corruption. 
  A decision was adopted to establish a coordinative council 
of 
the law enforcement agencies' chiefs with regard to the issues 
of combating crime and corruption within the Belarusian Cabinet 
of Ministers, which will be headed by Prime Minister Vyachaslaw 
Frantsevich Kebich. 
  The Ministry of Internal Affairs along with the Ministry of 
Justice, the Ministry of Economy, the Ministry of Resources, the 
Ministry of Communications, the State Committee for Industry and 
intersectoral productions are charged with drafting laws and 
submitting them for the consideration of the Cabinet of 
Ministers in 1994: 
  -- On criminal responsibility for the malicious violation of 
the administrative supervision and use of drugs for nonmedicinal 
purposes; 
  -- On responsibility for vagrancy and beggarliness; 
  -- On extension of powers and competence of militia 
departments' chiefs within the executive committees of 
corresponding soviets of people's deputies; 
  -- On introduction of tax breaks for enterprises and 
organizations which deal with production of means of 
communications, vehicles, and other types of special equipment 
and its selling to internal affairs departments. 
  The Belarusian Government deems it expedient to introduce 
official positions of government representatives to the staff of 
oblast executive committees, the Minsk City Executive Committee, 
and other city executive committees, according to appendix No. 2 
(in cities with population exceeding 100,000 people) to 
coordinate the activity of law enforcement agencies beginning 1 
April 1994. 
  The Directorate for Coordination of Activities of 
administration of the Central Office within the Belarusian 
Cabinet of Ministers is charged with controlling the 
implementation of this resolution.

  [Text] Moscow, BASAPRESS, 15/4/1994 -- The reunion of the 
delegations of the CIS member states was held this morning. The 
CIS presidents have met in the Kremlin and the prime ministers 
in the President Hotel, says a Presidential Press Service 
communique released from Moscow. After the meeting of the CIS 
presidents, Mircea Snegur signed the document of joining the CIS 
with the proper amendments. The amendments say that Moldova as 
a CIS member will not participate in discussing problems 
regarding collective security and military-political 
collaboration. The meeting of prime ministers decided to create 
a commission for economic cooperation. "It is very important to 
sign the draft agreement regarding the creation of a free trade 
zone. It is worth noting that Moldovan delegations were taken 
into consideration. Most important is that the CIS states are 
allowed to develop commercial ties with other countries beyond 
the CIS. The session also signed the draft regarding the 
Payments Union. This is, as Vice Premier Valentin Kunev said, 
the first document that brings us closer to the economic union. 
By elaborating the other agreements this union should be 
supported. It insures a market for Moldovan output. The 
document on labor migration and workers' social protection was 
also signed. This document is very important for Moldova which 
faces unemployment problems. By signing these agreements, 
Moldovan citizens have the same rights as the citizens of the 
state where they work." The prime minister examined the 
agreement guaranteeing the rights of national and religious 
minorities. The discussions over this agreement will be 
continued in the second half of May. The declaration on 
respecting the sovereignty, territorial integrity and 
inviolability of the CIS member states' borders was also 
discussed. Viktor Siniov, representative of eastern Moldova, was 
among the members of the Moldovan delegation. According to 
Kunev, Siniov took an active part in discussions and this shows 
that the disagreements can be overcome. Beginning at 1400 the 
presidents and premiers will meet to sign the agreements, says 
the communique.

  [Text] Kishinev 15 April, TASS -- Official Kishinev 
[Chisinau] expressed a protest against negative reaction of the 
Romanian political circles to the decision of Moldavia [Moldova] 
to join the Commonwealth of Independent States. 
  "Everyone should understand that Moldova is an independent 
state and can take any decision," Moldavian President Mircea 
Snegur stated in this connection. 
  Some Romanian law-makers called on their colleagues to 
condemn "the inclusion of the traditional Romanian lands into 
the new Soviet empire," according to the Kishinev radio. 
  Dumitru Motspan, deputy chairman of the Moldavian parliament 
and also the leader of the ruling Agrarian and Democratic Party, 
called Romania's reaction insulting. The recent poll and 
parliamentary elections showed that overwhelming majority of the 
population stood against unification with Romania and for 
independence, he told ITAR- TASS. 
  "We will conclude profitable economic and other agreements 
with all countries of the world, join international unions and 
do not intend to ask anyone's permission for that," Motspan 
stressed. 
  "The inclusion of Moldavia into CIS and the economic union 
would allow it to establish civilized mutual relations with CIS 
countries, to restore old and create new mutually beneficial 
economic links," he added.

  [Text] Moldovan Vice Premier Ivan Gutsu stated that the 
merging of the Russian and Belarusian monetary systems was a 
political move rather than an economic one. He suggested in an 
interview with Interfax today that Kishinev [Chisinau] would 
follow the experiment with great interest, however, Moldova did 
not as yet intend to participate in it. Gutsu emphasized that 
Moldova would strengthen its national currency unit -- lei, the 
exchange rate of which had been stable for the last months. 
  "To have our own national currency does not harm economic 
relations between the CIS states. Moreover, after the Moldovan 
Parliament ratified the agreement on joining the CIS and the CIS 
economic union signed by Moldovan President Mircea Snegur, these 
relations will become closer. We will consider the issue on 
participation in the customs union and in the single payment 
zone," Gutsu said.

  [Text] Chisinau, BASAPRESS, 15/4/1994 -- Russia reduced 
the volume of natural gas supply for Moldova by 30 percent 
beginning on the afternoon of 14 April, told BASAPRESS Ion Grau, 
vice-director of the State Gas Department. The cause was 
Moldova's failure to pay the Russian "Gazprom" organization 
debts amounting to 150 billion Russian rubles, specified the 
quoted source. Ion Grau said that in order to economize 
supplies the pressure in the gas pipelines is to be reduced. 
According to Grau, many people did not pay in time for natural 
gas and that is why the debts were not repaid. Natural gas 
worth about $700,000 is consumed each day in Moldova, specified 
Grau.

Nursultan Nazarbayev has chronic radiculitis exacerbation," 
Nazarbayev's physician Vladimir Perekhoda told KAZTAG. This is 
the reason for his today's absence from a meeting of the 
Commonwealth councils of state and government heads. 
  "The president used to work in a foundry. He lifted heavy 
things and once overstrained himself. The trauma later 
developed into chronic radiculitis," he said. 
  "A whole group of physicians is taking care of the 
president. 
We are unanimous in the opinion that radiculitis and cold 
Nazarbayev is suffering from must be cured. That is why, we 
recommended the president to cancel his Moscow visit," stressed 
the physician.

  [Text] Prime Minister Sergey Tereshchenko held a news 
conference in Almaty today. Attending were his first deputy 
Akezhan Kazhegeldin, Economy Minister Mars Urkumbayev, Finance 
Minister Yerkeshbay Derbisov, and National Bank Chairman Daulet 
Sembayev. 
  He stressed that rumors about the lack of a constructive 
governmental program of action were groundless and there was no 
necessity to adopt a new program. It was said that the program 
exists, is viable, and is working already. The president has 
endorsed the anticrisis measures program for 1993-95. At the 
parliament session the government will report about the progress 
of implementation of this program. The Cabinet of Ministers is 
working in conformity with the adopted plan. Its work is 
described in the statement on the economic policy for 1994 which 
was published. 
  Besides, in conformity with the president's instruction, a 
group led by the first deputy prime minister was set up which is 
examining the alternative programs of economic development and 
reform in Kazakhstan, submitted by the opposition parties. 
Members of the government, answering questions, touched upon a 
number of topical problems in the implementation of these 
reforms. In particular, the measures to enhance the national 
currency were discussed, as well as state loans and credits, 
foreign financial aid for entrepreneurship, and the introduction 
of the new taxation system. Also discussed were enforceable 
enactments adopted of late on abolishing natural [as heard] 
allowances for some categories of the population, increase of 
minimum wages and pensions, and further state policy regarding 
the public welfare of citizens with low income.

  [Text] In an interview with INTERFAX Kazakhstan's Foreign 
Minister Tuleutay Suleymenov said that each on its own, the 
former Soviet republics would not be able to cope with their 
problems. What they could do though, was uphold President 
Nazarbayev's proposal for the creation of a Eurasian union. 
  According to Suleymenov, economics must in the long run 
prevail over politics. In its present shape the Commonwealth of 
Independent States failed to work. The 400-plus agreements 
between its members were disregarded. But if two or three or 
four republics interested in cooperation formed a Eurasian 
union, the union would work. 
  Suleymenov said that although many were afraid that the 
creation of supranational organizational structures would 
infringe on their sovereignty, Kazakhstan had no fears of that. 
And just because it was not afraid of that, President 
Nazarbayev launched his call for a Eurasian union. 
  In the foreseeable future all Commonwealth republics would 
-- 
one after another -- uphold the Kazakh initiative. Although 
some failed to see working models for cooperation, Suleymenov 
said, such models did exist and there was no need for inventing 
them from the scratch. The European Union, with its concerted 
customs and economic policies, and transnational banks and 
payments, set an example to follow. The emergence of a 
partnership on the order of the European Union would, among 
other things, resolve the problem of dual citizenship. A person 
who wanted to change citizenship would be welcome to do so. 
  According to Suleymenov, there was no wise alternative to 
the 
creation of a Eurasian union. The former Soviet republics would 
never be able to separate. They needed each other. And even 
now, they showed a higher degree of integration that the 
member-nations of the European Union. So, concluded Suleimenov, 
what they had to do, was join forces. They broke up only to 
join forces on a new foundation.

  [Text] More than 4,000 participants of an unauthorized 
rally in Petropavlovsk, North Kazakhstan, said they had no 
confidence in the government and demanded its resignation. 
  The demonstrators, mainly representatives of Communist and 
Socialist movements as well as Cossacks, voiced their discontent 
over the social and economic situation both in their city and 
the republic as a whole and passed a resolution demanding the 
government's resignation. 
  In their opinion, the Kazakh president must bear 
responsibility for the republican government which has proved 
unable to lead the economy out of the crisis. 
  The demonstrators supported the region's economic 
independence and free trade with neighboring regions of Russia. 
  One of the organizers of the rally, Valeriy Ilyin, told 
INTERFAX that if these and other demands, mainly concerning 
state regulation of prices, centralized rationing of basic food 
staples, indexation of people's deposits with savings banks, 
were neglected, they could resort to other forms of civic 
protest allowed by the Kazakh Constitution. 
  The rally appealed to the Kazakh parliament session to open 
on April 19 to consider the issue of dual citizenship and making 
Russian the official language. 
  The demonstrators also demanded the leader of the local 
Russian-speaking community, Boris Suprunyuk, be set free. 
Suprunyuk had been detained on April 13 on charge of spreading 
ethnic strife. The participants of the rally also said they had 
no confidence in the region's prosecutor.

<F P=106> [Interview in Bishkek with Askar Akayev, president of </F>
Kirghizia [Kyrgyzstan], by Valeriy Konovalov, date not given: 
"Askar Akayev Sets Precedent in Solution of Problem of 
Russian-Speaking Population"] 
  [Text] Bishkek -- In the past two years 120,000 people of 
Slav nationality, mainly Russians, have left Kirghizia. But the 
remarkable fact is that 20,000 have already returned. 
  "Our native Russians" -- that was the term frequently used 
in 
our conversation by President Akayev when talking about the 
local Russian-speaking population, and it would seem that this 
is not a question of my interlocutor's eastern character. 
Akayev acknowledged that the opposition constantly accuses him 
of pro-Russian feelings. And this is not without reason. There 
are too many factors linking the Kirghiz president with Russia 
and Russian culture. His 17 years of life, study, and 
scientific work in Leningrad, and his family tree. 
  It turns out that he is the direct descendant of the Kirghiz 
khan who sent the first Kirghiz envoys to Russia back in the 
18th century. Another of Akayev's forebears took part with 
General Skobelev in the annexation of Kirghizia to Russia. 
  Akayev tells of another curious and, to some extent, 
sensational fact from his family history. He is quite closely 
related to President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan. Askar 
Akayev's mother is a Kazakh. Once, when (briefly) head of the 
science department of the Kirghiz Communist Party Central 
Committee, he was in Alma-Ata [Almaty] for an interrepublic 
event. On that occasion a member of his family pointed to a man 
and said: That is Nazarbayev, our maternal second cousin.... 
  Meanwhile, Akayev does not fear the charges of 
"pro-Russianism" because he is convinced that the 
interdependence of Kirghizia and Russia is an objective fact. 
Why? 
  The problem of the ethnic Russians in Kirghizia is more 
acute 
than in other Central Asian republics because there are far more 
of them here -- almost a quarter of the population. In the main 
the Russian speakers are employed in industry, 90 percent of 
which consists of military-industrial complex enterprises. They 
constitute the most highly skilled workers and the 
intelligentsia -- in other words, a valuable pool of manpower 
which the republic could ill afford to lose. That is how things 
stand from Kirghizia's viewpoint. 
  But Russia, too, must objectively have an interest in 
preserving the mighty Russian diaspora in our country, Akayev 
believes. For any country its diaspora in any other country is 
a factor of influence, a geopolitical factor. 
  Akayev and his team are now completing work on a state 
program of measures aimed at retaining the Russian-speaking 
population in the country. This unprecedentedly large-scale 
action is already bearing its first fruit. Until quite 
recently, according to the opinion polls, the language problem 
was top of the list among the causes of distress to the 
nonindigenous population, but that problem has now slipped down 
to sixth place. 
  This has happened, the president explained, because this 
problem was entirely within the bounds of our competence to 
resolve. But, unfortunately, not everything depends on us 
alone. That was why we needed major support from Russia -- and 
recently we got it. 
  It proved possible not only to give Russian the status of 
the 
second state language, Akayev explained, but also to insist on 
the ratification in the Constitution of a standard forbidding 
any infringement of people's interests on the grounds of their 
lack of knowledge of the state language. A special law is now 
being prepared which will enable the law-enforcement organs to 
combat any discrimination in this regard. 
  Akayev's main pride and joy is surely the Kirghiz-Russian 
Slav University, which is into its second year's work in the 
republic now, enjoys considerable popularity, and is being 
maintained on principles of parity. There are not only Slav 
students but Kirghiz, too. There are also students from 
neighboring republics. Incidentally, President Nazarbayev of 
Kazakhstan has already shown an interest in making the 
university interregional. 
  This is of great significance for our native Russians, 
Akayev 
said. This has given them the confidence that their children 
can get a good education in their own language. 
  But all of these things, let us recall, relate only to the 
Kirghiz side. Other factors -- economic ones -- have now risen 
to the top among the factors causing distress to the 
Russian-speaking population in Kirghizia. 
  We have been forced to suspend production at the majority of 
enterprises, Askar Akayev stressed. Primarily because of a lack 
of orders and shortages of components. We are talking about 
enterprises in the military-industrial complex. Mainly 
purpose-built enterprises. For example, they produce submarines 
at a level which is unparalleled anywhere in the world. In 
addition, we also have a purpose-built test base at Issyk-Kul, a 
deep-water clear lake. There are unique electronics 
enterprises, too. I am convinced that closing them down would 
be a mistake. After all, there is a social problem here, too: 
That of Russian specialists left without work. That is why we 
put a suggestion to Russia -- let us share this problem equally 
and perhaps involve third countries. For example, we could 
issue shares in unique production units in such a way that 
Russia would have a large bloc of shares, perhaps the main bloc. 
  There is another painful problem -- citizenship. 
  I have always favored dual citizenship, Akayev said. 
  But your relative Nazarbayev is a fundamental opponent of 
it, 
I pointed out, and you can see his point of view. In the event 
of the introduction of dual citizenship in Kazakhstan an 
enormous proportion of the ethnic Russians will become citizens 
of Russia and there is the potential danger of a territorial 
conflict. 
  There is a great difference here, Akayev explained. We do 
not have a border with Russia and there can be no territorial 
problems here. Thus dual citizenship can only be a benefit for 
the Russian-speaking population in our country. The Uzbeks are 
a different matter, however. They live in the border region in 
our country and Kirghiz live in the border region of Uzbekistan, 
so in this case dual citizenship could play a negative role. 
Islam Karimov and I have agreed that for our countries the 
problem of dual citizenship is a closed question. In principle, 
I advocated and continue to advocate dual citizenship not as an 
abstract norm, but as a subject of interstate agreements. As 
for Russia and the Russian-speaking citizens, we should have no 
problems here.

stage of work of the Zhogorku Kenesh's 14th session ended 16 
April in Bishkek. Boris Grigorievich Bazhan, people's deputy 
from Moskovskiy rayon and chairman of the Engels kolkhoz, was 
interviewed by our correspondent. 
  [Begin recording] [passage omitted] [Bazhan] We passed quite 
workable laws, especially on pensions. The government informed 
us about what lies ahead. The prospects are not brilliant. The 
situation is very serious. Many enterprises are at a 
standstill. The main thing is that nobody knows where all that 
money has gone. In practice, the enterprises cannot settle 
payments -- they are all bankrupt. Prime Minister Dzhumagulov 
said that these bankrupt enterprises are to blame, and first of 
all the state is to blame. The government is the number one 
bankrupt because the state owes the farmers a lot of money. It 
has not paid us for meat, milk, wool, or grain since 1993 for 
one single reason only: it announced subsidies for foodstuff and 
then we did not receive any payment from the budget. [passage 
omitted] 
  It is my impression that we are heading for nowhere. We are 
waiting for decisive measures from the government, from the 
president, but in fact we are still hanging around. Nobody is 
interested in working. All these new taxes, dues, and so on -- 
they are not workable for one simple reason: Nobody has any 
money. [passage omitted] 
  It is a shame to say it but those who do not produce 
anything 
are much better off than those who do. [passage omitted] 
  This spring is very difficult. We should have sown winter 
wheat on 2,600 ha but we lost 1,000 ha because it was too humid. 
The sowing campaign leaves much to be desired. [passage 
omitted] [end recording]

  [Text] Moscow, 15 Apr -- Saparmurat Niyazov and Leonid 
Kravchuk have expressed their mutual aspirations to overcome the 
difficulties that have arisen by taking both parties' interests 
and mutual advantage into account. The presidents of 
Turkmenistan and Ukraine met in Moscow today at the meeting of 
CIS heads of state. 
  Agreement was reached that Turkmenistan would resume the 
supply of natural gas to Ukraine from 15 April this year, since 
the Ukrainian side has found an acceptable solution for paying 
off its debts. 
  The presidents of the two countries approved an interstate 
agreement which sets out a clear schedule for the settlement of 
payments and reciprocal supplies from Ukraine. Thus, the first 
payments amounting to $10 million have already been made and the 
supply of goods and various products worth $60 million has 
begun. According to the schedule, Ukraine will make payments of 
$78 million and supply goods and various other products worth 
$200 million every quarter. 
  During their conversation, the presidents spoke in favor of 
actively continuing their dialogue and developing cooperation, 
both on a bilateral basis and within the framework of the CIS.

that is Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar, and his ally General 
Dustum -- an ethnic Uzbek whose troops also consist of Uzbeks. 
  Kabul radio yesterday broadcast a statement by the Afghan

Dustum aircraft to bomb the Afghan capital and this week they 
have already struck against Kabul. Surat Mirkasymov, Uzbekistan

  [Text] Vilnius April 15 TASS--A statement of Lithuanian 
Sejm opposition leader Vitautas Landsbergis on the Russian 
intention to join the Council of Europe and his accusations of 
"Moscow that allegedly commands the Lithuanian Foreign Ministry" 
was circulated in Strasbourg during a visit of Lithuanian 
President Algirdas Brazauskas. 
  A statement of the Lithuanian Foreign Ministry circulated 
here today says such unjustified accusations affect the prestige 
of the Lithuanian state. 
  As for Russian membership in the Council of Europe, 
Lithuania 
will support it on condition of Russian observation of its 
international obligations as regards troops withdrawal from 
Latvia and Estonia and respect to sovereignty of the 
neighbouring states, human rights and rights of ethnic 
minorities.

  [Text] Vilnius, Apr 15, BNS -- Vytautas Landsbergis, 
leader of the Lithuanian parliament's rightist opposition, 
expressed satisfaction with Lithuanian President Algirdas 
Brazauskas' speech at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council 
of Europe in Strasbourg Thursday [14 April]. 
  "Most probably it was the first time that the head of the 
Lithuanian state criticized Russia's policy and leadership," 
Landsbergis told a news conference Friday. 
  In his words, until now, Lithuania carried out a timeserving 
policy with respect to Moscow. "I now see that the leadership of 
the LDLP (Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party) understands 
Russia's actual policy," Landsbergis said. 
  The opposition leader said he is not certain that the LDLP 
has decided to view things realistically, but such indications 
exist. 
  Landsbergis said a realistic view means "to give up 
"Moscowcentrism," inherited from Soviet times, when Moscow is 
understood as the big center where Lithuania's fate is decided. 
  "Possibilities to form not a post-communist-single-party, 
but 
a national policy may then appear."

  [Text] VILNIUS, Apr 15, BNS - The Lithuanian Conservative 
Party announced its intention to initiate a referendum aimed at 
stopping illegal privatization and compensating devaluated 
savings of the population. 
  On April 21, the party will start collecting signatures 
under 
a petition demanding a referendum to adopt a constitutional law 
dealing with illegal privatization, devaluated savings and 
company shares, as well as violations of the law. 
  The party's board made the decision at its meeting Wednesday 
[13 April]. MP Gediminas Vagnorius, chairman of the board, said 
he is certain that such a law will be adopted. 
  The conservatives expect the law to restore order in the 
process of state property privatization, to compensate people's 
savings, to stop artificial bankruptcies and the downfall of 
production, as well as to enhance law and order. 
  300,000 signatures are necessary for the parliament to 
announce a referendum. The conservatives intend to collect 
signatures for two months and expect the referendum to be held 
in September. 
  At a press conference Thursday, Vagnorius said other 
questions may be included in the referendum, as well, but he 
declined to specify any of them. 
  In Vagnorius' words, the property "privatized without 
privatization" is worth some 8 to 10 billion lits.

  [Text] VILNIUS, Apr 15, BNS - The Constitutional Court of 
Lithuania established that the parliament's decision allowing 
naturalization of former Soviet servicemen as Lithuanian 
citizens violates the Lithuanian Constitution. 
  According to an amendment to the citizenship law, adopted by 
the parliament last year, persons who served in Soviet armed 
forces and other repressive structures may be granted Lithuanian 
citizenship, provided they ceased service before March 1, 1992 
and received Lithuanian citizen certificates before Nov. 4, 1991. 
  The court said dual citizenship is possible only in 
exceptional cases, while former Soviet servicemen were Soviet 
citizens and received Lithuanian citizenship certificates 
unlawfully. 
  According to unofficial reports, the amendment to the 
citizenship law may have affected around 800 former servicemen.

  [Text] Sevastopol [no date as received] -- The Sevastopol 
branch of the Ukraine Officers Union held a meeting on 14 April 
to voice a resolute protest against "the attempts by the Russian 
naval command and the Black Sea Fleet to further destabilize the 
situation and increase the confrontation with the armed forces 
of Ukraine." The adopted statement says that the media, spurred 
on by the Black Sea Fleet press center, are spreading slander 
about the so-called "Odessa incident." Facts show that the 
Black Sea Fleet command is constantly involving the officers and 
personnel of the fleet in various political actions and 
encouraging their active participation in anti-Ukrainian 
political parties and movements. 
  The meeting pointed out that Black Sea Fleet Commander 
Eduard 
Baltin is continuing to grossly violate the laws of Ukraine, and 
appealed to the presidents of Ukraine and Russia for his 
dismissal. They also urged everybody who valued peace to resist 
provocations by destructive forces.

  [Text] [No dateline as received] -- Albi Shudrya, senior 
officer of the Ukrainian Naval Forces press center, told a UNIAN 
correspondent on 15 April that 42 naval officers and warrant 
officers of the former 318th division of the Black Sea Fleet 
conservation ships have by now taken the oath of allegiance to 
the people of Ukraine and got down to fulfilling their duties 
within the composition of the first brigade protecting the 
Odessa naval district. Out of the 136 families of servicemen, 
only eight decided to leave Odessa for the deployment sites of 
the Russian military units. "Those who expressed their wish to 
leave Odessa were yesterday offered to travel and transfer their 
luggage in separate births of the Slavutych ship," said Vice 
Admiral Volodymyr Bezkorovaynyy, the Ukrainian Naval Forces 
commander, during his conversation with the UNIAN correspondent. 
"However, these servicemen and their families did not wish to 
leave Odessa on board the Ukrainian ship. They were offered a 
cargo airplane AN-12, which will fly off for the town of Saki on 
21 April, as agreed with the Russian servicemen." 
  Replying to a question on who the property of the Ukrainian 
Naval Forces, stolen from Odessa, was passed to, the vice 
admiral pointed out: "After the crew of the Cheleken had 
carried out the pirate voyage, the vessel, escorted by ships 
with marines on board, at first dropped its anchor in the area 
where the cargo could be inspected. However, the Black Sea 
Fleet command did not allow representatives of the procurator's 
office, customs, and border guards to board the Cheleken. On 
the next day, the vessel was stationed near other ships in a 
zone closed for any kind of inspections. On the third day, when 
only 15 pieces of cargo remained on board the Cheleken out of 
the 41 that had been taken away, the inspectors had nothing else 
to do but state that the criminal operation was a success.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS] </F>
  [Text] Moscow 15 April -- While Russian and Ukrainian 
leaders discuss the future of the Black Sea Fleet in Moscow, the 
Ukrainian Defence Ministry is on the offensive and is not 
daunted even by the use of force in its efforts to take over 
parts of the Black Sea Fleet. In doing so, Kiev is violating 
all the existing Russian-Ukrainian agreements on the fleet, the 
fleet's press centre told ITAR-TASS on Friday. 
  Today, a group of eight military personnel from the 
Ukrainian 
Navy, having gained the support of the Ukrainian presidential 
representative in Izmail, arrived at a brigade of river cutters. 
The Ukrainians were led by head of the western maritime defence 
region of the Ukrainian naval forces, Captain Dmitriy Ukrainets, 
according to the press centre. 
  The Ukrainians met with the command of the river unit and 
handed them the directive issued by the Ukrainian Defence 
Ministry on 10 April, which says the Black Sea Fleet unit is 
being disbanded, and the third naval defence brigade of the 
Ukrainian Navy is to be created on its base. The unit was given 
a new commander, Captain Yaroslav Fyodorshin. 
  The Ukrainian personnel appealed to the brigade's command to 
avoid the use of armed force. They promised to increase the pay 
of seamen who swear allegiance to Ukraine. The Ukrainians 
announced that those who wanted to serve in the Russian Navy 
would be allowed to go to Russia. 
  The personnel of the river cutter unit were especially 
warned 
to preserve the brigade's military equipment and property, which 
the Ukrainian Navy representatives claim belongs to Ukraine. 
  Meanwhile, in Moscow, Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev 
told journalists on Friday that Russia has been providing all 
the money for the Black Sea Fleet since September 1993, which 
means that "the fleet is Russian even as concerns financing". 
There can be no talk about leasing parts of the fleet to 
Ukraine, the minister declared. Especially since, under current 
conditions, Ukraine's security in the Black Sea is being 
maintained at Russian expense. The Russian and Ukrainian 
delegations to the CIS summit meeting in Moscow are currently 
working on specific solutions to that problem.

<F P=106> [Report by Viktor Yadukha from Sevastopol under the </F>
"Conflict" rubric: "Black Sea Fleet Ships Denied Access to 
Ukrainian Ports. Admiral Baltin Does Not Want To Take Any Risky 
Steps"] 
  [Text] It has transpired from sources close to the Black 
Sea Fleet staff that a telegram from Ukrainian Defense Minister 
General Vitaliy Radetskyy to Admiral Eduard Baltin, Black Sea 
Fleet commander, was received on 15 April, in which the former 
categorically objects to the entry of Black Sea Fleet ships and 
vessels to the Ukrainian ports of Odessa, Izmail, Kherson, and 
Nikolayev. Meanwhile, the Black Sea Fleet command has been 
preparing ships for evacuating eight families of the 318th 
Division's servicemen who refused to take the oath of loyalty to 
Ukraine. When meeting with them, Vice Admiral Vladimir 
Beskaravaynyy, commander in chief of the Ukrainian Navy, who 
heads the naval field staff at the "Slavutich" cruiser in 
Odessa, proposed that the officers take an oath of allegiance to 
Ukraine and follow him on board "Slavutich." The commander of 
"Ilya Azarov," a ship blocked in the Odessa port, responded: 
"We will not go to an enemy ship; these people have robbed us. 
They will finish robbing us there." 
  In Odessa, the Black Sea Fleet's surveillance post has also 
been blocked. Black Sea Fleet staff officers point out that the 
Ukrainian Defense Ministry has made it clear by its actions that 
it is carrying out the functions of the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet 
and its Foreign Ministry. 
  Currently, the 318th Division of mothballed ships includes 
three Black Sea Fleet ships, on which Ukrainian flags have 
already been hoisted. Black Sea Fleet Commander Adm. Baltin has 
decided not to take any steps to evacuate servicemen, because 
this may be interpreted by the Ukrainian side as a provocation.

  [Text] [no dateline as received]--In an interview with a 
UNIAN correspondent on 15 April, Rear Admiral Oleksiy Ryzhenko, 
deputy commander of the Naval Forces of Ukraine, pointed out: 
"Practice shows that the Black Sea Fleet command is resorting to 
a show of strength ever more often. In particular, on the eve 
of the election of the president of Crimea, a large group of 
ships put to sea without any agreement with the authorities of 
Ukraine and Crimea and without them being aware of this. Yet 
another proof of this is the fact that they put to sea on a mass 
scale on 14-15 April, i.e. on the days when the Odessa incident 
had not yet been settled, when the issue of the Black Sea Fleet 
was to be considered at the meeting of the heads of state of CIS 
in Moscow." 
  In connection with this, the rear admiral believes that, 
proceeding from Ukrainian legislation and the norms of 
international law on the territorial supremacy of the law, it 
would be expedient that the Black Sea Fleet commander coordinate 
all issues related to the use of the training ground by the 
Black Sea Fleet forces with the commander of the Naval Forces of 
Ukraine. 
  The latter, in Ryzhenko's opinion, should also give his 
consent for the Black Sea Fleet ships and vessels under the St. 
Andrew flag and the state flag of the Russian Federation to 
enter and leave the territorial internal waters and ports of 
Ukraine. The redeployment of military units, movements of 
military detachments, and transfer of military cargo within the 
boundaries of Ukraine's territory must be carried out with the 
consent of the chief of the general staff of Ukraine's Armed 
Forces. 
  The rear admiral also believes that combat training 
grounds--both sea- and land-based--located within the limits of 
the state territory and in Ukraine's defined Black Sea 
territorial waters, must be subordinated to the Naval Forces of 
Ukraine, while it would be expedient to make Ukraine's Naval 
Forces aviation commander responsible for air traffic control on 
the territory of Crimea.

<F P=106> [Report by Viktor Yadukha from Sevastopol under the </F>
"Neighbors" rubric with the general heading: "Ukraine Has 
Decided To Play War With the Black Sea Fleet. Meanwhile, 
Yeltsin and Kravchuk Have Decided To Split the Fleet"] 
  [Text] SEGODNYA correspondents at the Black Sea Fleet's 
press center have reported that on the morning of 15 April, 12 
Black Sea Fleet ships left Sevastopol "to practice combat 
training missions. This is a planned departure, and it has no 
bearing on the events going on in Odessa," the official 
statement says. 
  Meanwhile, the Ukrainian Navy Command has offered its 
assistance in evacuating by air or by ship officers and warrant 
officers of the maintenance division ships seized in Odessa. 
The sailors declined the offer, saying that they do not trust 
people who have treated them like that, adding that they will 
wait for help from the Black Sea Fleet. 
  Captain Second Rank Aleksandr Zelenko, chief of staff of the 
Odessa division, who arrived in Sevastopol to report on the 
situation, has said that by the time of the attack, a total of 
18 officers, 37 warrant officers, and 33 sailors were in the 
division. Of them, four officers and another 32 people -- 
warrant officers and servicewomen -- took the Ukrainian loyalty 
oath. 
  According to Captain Second Rank Zelenko, the Ukrainian 
servicemen plan to seize this way another two Black Sea Fleet 
units located in the northwestern part of the Black Sea -- a 
ship division in Ochakov and a brigade of ships under 
construction and repair in Nikolayev. When asked what these 
people could do to defend themselves, the officer said: A 
serviceman has only one answer to weapons, which is weapons. In 
Aleksandr Zelenko's view, the paratrooper brigade whose 200 or 
so servicemen occupied his division is subordinated directly to 
the Ukrainian president and could do it only on his order. The 
officer thinks that the sailors in Ochakov and Nikolayev are 
also ready to use arms in case of a possible attack. 
  Your SEGODNYA correspondent has learned that before noon on 
15 April, having secured the backing of the Ukrainian 
president's representative in Izmail, eight representatives of 
the Ukrainian Navy under Captain First Rank Dmitriy Ukrainets, 
chief of the Ukrainian Navy Water Area Protection's western 
sector, came to the premises of the Black Sea Fleet river boat 
brigade, which is deployed in the city. At the meeting with the 
boat brigade command, they read them the Ukrainian Defense 
Ministry's directive No. 115/1/0237 of 10 April 1994 on 
disbanding the river boat brigade and setting up the 3d brigade 
of the Ukrainian Navy Water Area Protection on its basis. The 
officers were introduced to the unit's new commander, Captain 
First Rank Yaroslav Fedorishin. All who would take a Ukraine 
oath of allegiance were promised a salary raise. According to 
reports from the Black Sea Fleet staff, having encountered stiff 
resistance on the part of the brigade's officers, the Ukrainian 
Navy representatives asked them not to use arms. What the boat 
brigade officers' response will be is anyone's guess.

  [Text] Within 10 days Ukrainian and Russian delegates are 
to submit to their heads of state a draft treaty on the division 
of the Black Sea Fleet. This was disclosed by Ukraine's 
President Leonid Kravchuk at a news-conference in Kiev last 
night upon his arrival from Moscow. 
  As he revealed, at a meeting with Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin on Friday agreement was reached to set up a Russian 
naval base in Ukraine. However, as Kravchuk emphasized, it will 
be "a base, rather than bases," and its site, in his words, will 
be chosen at state level bilateral talks. 
  The Ukrainian Foreign Minister Boris Tarasyuk, who attended 
the negotiations on the navy division, told newsmen that, in his 
opinion, such a base could be leased to Russia for up to five 
years. 
  Kravchuk stressed that before the lease treaty takes effect 
it must be ratified by Ukraine's parliament. 
  He argued that Ukraine claims 15-20 percent of the Black Sea 
Fleet's ships and recalled with reference to the Yalta accords 
that Ukraine would be entitled to one half of the fleet, if it 
were divided. However, as he remarked, Ukraine is ready to sell 
Russia its portion of the fleet, which, as he explained, Ukraine 
does not need to guarantee its defence potential. 
  He voiced displeasure with the Black Sea Navy Commander, 
Admiral Eduard Baltin. He said he would be prepared to revoke 
his approval of Baltin's appointment to the post of commander 
and would do so if "the process of negotiations drags on." "If 
not, I will have nothing to do with the Russian Black Sea Fleet 
Commander," he said. 
  As he explained, on Friday the defence ministers of Ukraine 
and Russia were told to instruct the subordinate units to 
resolve all conflicts and abide by the achieved accords in their 
future actions. All conflicts similar to those in Odessa have 
been settled for good. This view is shared by the leaders of 
Ukraine and Russia alike, he declared. 
  He reaffirmed an invitation to Yeltsin to pay an official 
visit to Ukraine after the preparation of a comprehensive 
friendship and cooperation treaty. 
  He voiced hope that such an accord would be ready in the 
first half of 1994. 
  Another round of talks on the Black Sea Navy division was 
scheduled for 22 April in Moscow.

  [Text] Kiev, 16 Apr -- After returning from the Moscow 
meeting of CIS countries' heads of states and governments, 
Leonid Kravchuk, Ukraine's president, gave a news conference at 
the Kiev's Borispol airport. 
  [Begin recording] [Kravchuk] Black Sea Fleet problems were 
at 
the center of attention, but the meeting between the presidents 
of Ukraine and Russia, in which the prime ministers, foreign 
affairs ministers, and defense ministers of both states took 
part, was of a broader nature. The meeting took the form of a 
discussion of large scale problems. In particular, we agreed 
and instructed the foreign affairs ministers to prepare a 
wide-ranging treaty on friendship and cooperation between 
Ukraine and Russia. I officially invited the president of 
Russia to pay a state visit to Ukraine and he accepted this 
invitation. 
  Economic problems were discussed too, but the Black Sea 
Fleet 
issue was the central one. It has made our relations more acute 
and could make them more acute in the future. It seems to me 
that at this stage, we have adopted the only possible and 
sensible decision -- we acknowledged that we should divide in 
accordance with the Yalta, Zavidovo, and Massandra meetings. 
That is, Ukraine takes its share of the fleet, and that part 
which it does not take, it gives away, sells, or transfers to 
Russia according to its value, which will be determined by the 
competent experts. 
  Toward the end, we clearly determined the parameters of what 
part of the fleet Ukraine is taking: as much as it can maintain 
and as much as its strategic concept and defense doctrine 
demand. We proceeded from our strategic aims -- how many 
fighting ships and personnel in service afloat [plavsklad] we 
need. An instruction was issued that all the parameters 
connected with basing the Russian fleet in Ukraine be elaborated 
within 10 days. The Russian fleet's base will be determined not 
in general terms, but on universally acknowledged international 
principles, and this base will be leased accordingly on certain 
conditions, which are universally acknowledged in the world. 
  We came to the conclusion that we should clarify the Odessa 
incident, which could cause a chain reaction. The defense 
ministers of Ukraine and Russia were instructed to pass the 
directives of the two presidents to Eduard Baltin, commander of 
the Black Sea Fleet, and to Volodymyr Bezkorovaynyy, commander 
of Ukraine's Navy, so that they take all the necessary measures 
so as not to let those processes develop, which complicate or 
could complicate the situation at the current points where the 
fleet is based. 
  [Correspondent] Over 20 documents were signed at the Moscow 
sitting. Did Ukraine make any proposals or observations? 
  [Kravchuk] We signed all of the documents pertaining to the 
economic situation without exception. Now the issue of an 
associate or actual member of the association means not only 
closer economic integration, but that political integration will 
necessarily occur following it. Others are to be found 
corresponding to our level -- an associate member. But now all 
are signing the same documents, and the same laws are in force 
for all. There is no need to make a tragedy of this. This is a 
process of formation. Europe was going towards a European union 
for 35 years. We cannot do in five years what Europe did in 35. 
The main thing is that the general tendency is going towards 
economic integration, and here Ukraine is not throwing anything 
out, but is going towards and will be going towards this 
integration, because this is an objective and natural process, 
which meets the interests of the people. 
  [Correspondent] Does the fact that the fleet will be divided 
so 80 percent goes to Russia and 20 percent to Ukraine 
correspond to reality? Will Russia's naval bases be on our 
territory, and if so then on what conditions and what will their 
status be? 
  [Kravchuk] I have already said that Ukraine will take for 
itself as many fighting ships and as much infrastructure as it 
needs to secure its military strategic aims in accordance with 
the military doctrine, which has been approved. According to 
our calculations, we need approximately 15-20 percent. We 
already have a part of our ships, and we have border guard 
vessels too. This is not about Russia's military bases, but 
about one military base for the Russian fleet. Ten days have 
been given so that the delegations, taking into account 
interests and possibilities, determine where this base will be 
located. This cannot be a subjective decision so that when we 
begin to implement it later, we see that it is not open to 
implementation. Everyone says that the Russian fleet's base 
should not be in Sevastopol. From patriotic considerations this 
does not cause any doubt. But let us look at the situation, 
which has now arisen. There is now a fleet, and the greater 
part of this fleet will belong to Russia. Tens of officers and 
their families live in Sevastopol, their children are in 
kindergarten. Now they suddenly say, let us make it so that the 
Russian fleet leaves Sevastopol. This is possible, but we 
should say, as for example Germany says, that the Russian troops 
should leave Germany, and for that we give you German marks, 
build accommodation for you, and you resettle. But we can say 
(this will be approximately 120,000 people): You leave 
Sevastopol, move somewhere, we will not offer you flats, 
schools, or kindergartens. So what answer will these people 
give? That is, one should not adopt a decision while being 
guided only by emotions and desires. All the more so when it is 
not being adopted forever -- a lease has a time-scale -- and 
there is no need to dramatize the situation. This is politics, 
and the masses take part in politics, and in this case thousands 
of people make up the masses. And no one can disregard the 
interests of thousands of people. 
  [Correspondent] Information from various agencies exists 
that the CIS countries agreed to a special status for Russia 
regarding implementation of its peacemaking functions? 
  [Kravchuk] This issue was not discussed. The issue was 
discussed and a corresponding statement made about ending the 
war in Azerbaijan. The presidents of Azerbaijan and Armenia made 
such statements. Ukraine signed it, too. The point is that the 
CIS countries took into consideration the presidents' statements 
that they will stop or will do everything necessary to stop the 
armed conflicts. Then one can begin talks with the 
participation of CIS countries' peacemaking forces and in the 
presence of CSCE or UN observers. There was no talk about 
granting Russia some kind of powers. It is about the 
peacemaking forces of the CIS, or more precisely, those 
countries, which come under the collective treaty. 
  [Correspondent] Your attitude to the person of Admiral 
Baltin, the Black Sea Fleet commander? Were issues of avoiding 
a possible conflict in the very near future discussed? 
  [Kravchuk] My attitude to the Black Sea Fleet commander 
after 
his latest action is a negative one. If we, for example, saw 
that the process of resolving the Black Sea situation was being 
delayed, I would make a specific proposal on the part of Ukraine 
and would recall my signature. But as I am convinced that we do 
not have the right to delay, then it will not concern me as 
president who will be the commander of the Russian fleet. That 
will then be Russia's affair. Therefore, I have refrained from 
making a corresponding statement up to now and from recalling my 
signature. With regard to settling the situation, the presidents 
of Russia and Ukraine instructed the defense ministers of both 
countries to give orders for settling all of the acute problems 
at all base positions and to begin resolving the problems. 
  [Correspondent] What amounts of compensation can Ukraine 
count on when the fleet is divided? When is the visit by 
Russia's president expected? 
  [Kravchuk] It still has to be calculated on defined 
principles how much the ships, which will be handed over to 
Russia, and the Russian fleet's basing [bazuvannya] will be 
worth. How much it comes to all together depends on how much 
will be offered. The Russian president's visit will become real 
when we have prepared the wide-ranging treaty on friendship and 
cooperation between Ukraine and Russia. 
  [Correspondent] As the economic union envisages that a 
fully-fledged member does not have the right to enter another 
economic union without permission, will it not be that permanent 
and fully-fledged members of the economic union will essentially 
be cut off from the European community? 
  [Kravchuk] There is a certain problematic situation for 
(?the 
country), but there is also the reality that one is still a long 
way from fully-fledged membership of the European Union. In my 
opinion, a union as a phenomenon in world politics is a 
temporary phenomenon, which leads to the division of the world 
into blocs, political groupings, and military interests. If one 
is to speak from a broad aspect, the problem is in integrating 
unions' bases. I think that society will realize this itself, 
and the CIS is uniting into a union because of this too. At 
present, we are not reaching beyond the level of all of our 
possibilities, which are within the framework of the CIS. One 
should live according to one's means. 
  With regard to dividing the Black Sea Fleet, 50 percent each 
way, -- this has already been divided, we agreed to this both in 
Yalta and in Zavidovo. Now they are 50 percent of ours. I am 
not going to name precise figures. We take 400 ships (200 of 
ours and 200 Russian ones). This has already been divided. Of 
our 200, we need 20 percent, and those which we do not need, we 
sell to Russia according to the value in the appraisal, which 
will have been made. 
  [Correspondent] A political evaluation of the consequences 
of the elections in Ukraine has not been heard from you yet. A 
congress of the Ukrainian Union of Industrialists and 
Entrepreneurs has taken place, where Leonid Kuchma was proposed 
as the candidate for president. Tomorrow Rukh will surely 
propose Vyacheslav Chornovil. What is your attitude to yourself 
as a future candidate for president? 
  [Kravchuk] I proceed from the fact that there is a law "On 
Elections of a President" and that people propose their 
candidacies in accordance with this law. This is the right of 
everyone and of those people who have proposed a candidate for 
president. This is a normal process. It is important for me 
that the president's status be clearly defined. One can elect a 
president with the current status too, that is elect a president 
as head of state and head of executive authority, which is noted 
in the Constitution. I understand that if elections of a 
president take place and changes are not made to the 
constitution -- and I do not think that this will be very easy 
for 338 deputies to do -- that the president is only a head of 
state. Then the following collision will arise: At the same 
time as elections of a president, bodies of power are elected, 
the structure of which does not envisage a president with 
executive functions. That is, a president is elected as head of 
executive power, but the functions and possibilities for 
executing one's powers are taken away. As I understand it, the 
councils do not envisage a president with executive powers. A 
president could be elected who will not have anything or anyone 
to direct, but then in order to take away his executive powers 
again, the tug of war will begin again. He can ask for a 
referendum or the people will agree to leave him the functions 
of head of state and head of executive power, and if the people 
agree to this in a referendum, then it will be necessary to 
create presidential structures again. It will end where it began. 
  The main problem in elections of a parliament is the winning 
over of non-party deputies, who are 51 or 52 percent of those 
elected. Who will manage to get them on their side? It is too 
soon to make predictions at the moment, as not all deputies have 
been elected yet. [end recording]

  [Excerpt] Reports are coming in of new instances of 
arbitrary seizure of Black Sea Fleet property by the Ukrainian 
military. 
  According to river motorboat crews, a group of eight 
Ukrainian naval servicemen arrived in Izmail at 1300. They 
handed to the unit commander an order from the Ukrainian defense 
minister to the effect that the unit was disbanded and replaced 
by a third brigade to guard the Ukrainian naval military 
district. 
  Sources close to the Black Sea Fleet headquarters have 
learned that on 15 April, near the settlement of Perevalnaya, 
near Simferopol, one of the battalions of a mechanised division 
of the Ukrainian armed forces has been placed on full combat

  [Text] Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk has said that 
Kiev will take an active part in a CIS economic union. In an 
interview with INTERFAX he said that he would sign documents on 
an associated membership. 
  Kravchuk believes that now the difference between full and 
associated membership in the economic union is only relative. 
  "I have looked through economic documents prepared for the 
Moscow CIS summit. We shall sign them. Like full members, we 
shall put our signatures under the documents on the economic 
cooperation among the CIS members," said Kravchuk. 
  Asked to express his attitude to the initiative by 
Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev on the creation of a 
Euro-Asian union, Kravchuk said that today the integration in 
such a scope, proposed by some politicians, following the 
example of the European Union, has no basis. 
  For a Euro-Asian union to work, conditions should be 
prepared 
gradually, said Kravchuk. It is no secret that it took European 
countries 35 years to form the European Union. The CIS has 
existed only several years and we did not yet form many 
mechanisms for the Commonwealth to work. There are also other 
problems which are not solved, not for a lack of will. The 
conditions are not ripe for a Euro-Asian union, said Kravchuk. 
  Kravchuk said that he was not against the idea of a 
Euro-Asian union. He said he did not want the idea to 
materialize now, because, he believes, it would lead nowhere.

  [Text] Andrey Kozyrev, Russian foreign minister, left for 
former Yugoslavia late on 16 April. Before his departure, he 
gave an interview to INTERFAX. According to Kozyrev, if NATO 
had consulted Russia prior to carrying out air strikes against 
the Bosnian Serbs, another way could possibly have been found to 
warn the hotheads among the Bosnian Serbs to halt the shelling 
of Gorazde. At the same time, together with our partners we 
could, perhaps, have found a possibility to warn the other side, 
the Bosnian Muslims, who are clearly provoking the Serbs, the 
minister said.

  [Text] Before leaving Moscow for Belgrade, Saturday, 
Russia's Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev told Interfax more 
thought should be given to plans to join NATO's Partnership for 
Peace [PFP] program. 
  Kozyrev wished allied aircraft had refrained from bombing 
Serb positions near Gorazde pending consultations with Moscow. 
He said Russia and NATO had agreed to launch special, 
gentlemanly, relations on the basis of a more or less standard 
pilot document. 
  According to Kozyrev, Russia wanted more than the end of 
hostile relations with NATO. It wanted NATO to either learn to 
promote full-scale cooperation with Russia or set thought on 
integration into a mechanism that would be suited to meet new 
reality. He wanted NATO to treat Russia as a great power. 
  And, Kozyrev would want Russia and NATO to promote more 
serious and constructive relations in addition to signing a 
pilot document of limited importance.

  [Text] Belgrade, 17 Apr (TASS) -- To define a security 
zone in the Gorazde area, to cease hostilities on all fronts and 
to eliminate obstacles in the way of normal operation of the 
personnel of UN forces -- these are the priority points for a 
way out of the present critical situation in Bosnia. They were 
formulated at the talks between Serbian President Slobodan 
Milosevic and Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, which 
have just ended here. 
  These agreements will lay a foundation for the forthcoming 
multilateral meeting in Pale between the Bosnian Serb 
leadership, the UN representatives, and the Russian president's 
Special Envoy Vitaliy Churkin. The Russian foreign minister 
announced that the meeting would take place today [17 April]. 
  The meeting is to define clearly the boundaries of a 
security 
zone in Gorazde, to solve the questions of demilitarization of 
this zone and of the withdrawal of the Bosnian Serb troops, to 
draw up conditions for observing a cease-fire between the Serb 
and the Muslim sides on all lines of contact in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Those attending the meeting will also have 
to agree on ways to ensure freedom of movement for all 
servicemen from the UN forces, who are now blockaded for various 
reasons by local Serbian authorities.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Dmitriy Gorokhov and Aleksandr </F>
Kondrashov] 
  [Text] Belgrade, 17 Apr -- A comprehensive cessation of 
hostilities on all Bosnian fronts should become a starting point 
for ending the critical situation around Gorazde, today Russian 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev stated following his meeting 
with the Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. 
  It is necessary to ensure that the Serbian troops be 
withdrawn from the town and that its shelling -- an excessive 
response to the provocations of the Muslim side -- be ceased, 
said the Russian minister. We also consider the NATO air 
strikes to be an excessive reaction. However, at this point it 
is important to stop this chain of developments, to define the 
borders of the security zone in Gorazde, to bring there UN 
observers and to observe the cease-fire not only in Gorazde, but 
also on all Bosnian fronts, so as to avoid repeated duplications 
of such crisis situations in different areas. 
  I am glad that our approach coincides in principle with the 
position described by President Milosevic. The important point 
is that these steps -- lifting the blockade of Gorazde, removing 
all the problems which have emerged with the personnel of the UN 
forces, the observance of the regime of the security zone and 
the comprehensive cease-fire -- all these steps should be 
implemented in practice. 
  Such implementation will create a solid foundation for 
firmly 
raising the issue of lifting the sanctions against the former 
Yugoslavia, the Russian minister emphasized. 
  Asked what Russia would do should there be another breach of 
the procedure of the use of force by NATO against Bosnian Serbs, 
Andrey Kozyrev said: Within the last 24 hours, in spite of the 
crisis in Gorazde, we applied serious efforts to prevent new air 
strikes. I maintain that now all will depend on the 
implementation of the complex of measures outlined at my meeting 
with President Milosevic. At the forthcoming meeting in Pale 
between the leaders of the Bosnian Serbs and the UN 
representatives, with the participation of Russia, it is 
necessary to have the borders of the security zone clearly 
defined and the issues of bringing there UN observers discussed. 
The adherence to these accords, the complete cessation of the 
shelling of the town and the lifting of the blockade of the UN 
personnel -- all these steps will make redundant the issue of 
the air strikes.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Dmitriy Gorokhov and Aleksandr </F>
Kondrashov] 
  [Text] Belgrade, 17 Apr -- This day should become a 
reference point for moving in the opposite direction from war, 
Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said before flying out 
of Belgrade for Moscow. 
  During the course of talks with Serbian President Slobodan 
Milosevic, he said in an interview with Russian journalists, I 
discussed the initiative plan on a settlement put forward by 
President Yeltsin and passed on our urgent recommendations to 
follow precisely this path. I should say that the Serbian 
president was ready for this conversation and our ideas on ways 
of settling the Bosnian question virtually tallied. This comes 
down to two to three specific steps: The lifting of the siege 
of Gorazde, which would mean quite a modest Serbian troop 
withdrawal; an end to the bombardment; and the dispatch of a 
contingent of UN forces to that town, which would guarantee 
objectivity and a complete cessation of fire by all sides. This 
would make any aerial actions on the part of NATO or the United 
Nations completely unnecessary. 
  Furthermore, the minister continued, the way would 
immediately be cleared for a cessation of hostile actions along 
the whole front line. Then favorable conditions would be 
created for holding full-scale negotiations on a comprehensive 
settlement. Everything now depends on whether the Serb side 
carries out the accords that were achieved at the meeting with 
President Milosevic. 
  In short, there is a very great chance for peace. 
Accordingly, these steps by the Serb side -- each one of them 
-- would make it possible for Russia with even greater 
persistence and realism to raise the issue of the lifting of the 
sanctions against Yugoslavia. 
  Moreover, this plan was approved in Belgrade. Belgrade would 
therefore have clearly shown that an impetus toward peace is 
coming precisely from there. Consequently, the grounds for the 
sanctions are disappearing and conditions are being created for 
Yugoslavia's return into the family of European and world 
peoples, Kozyrev emphasized in conclusion.

  [Text] [Unidentified announcer] Our special correspondent 
Yevgeniy Osipovskiy is on the line from Vnukovo-2, where Russian 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev arrived from Belgrade literally 
a few minutes ago. What have you got to tell us? 
  [Osipovskiy] Andrey Kozyrev's news conference has only just 
ended and, although it was brief, there was a lot of interesting 
information in it. First among the main decisions that were 
made at the talks with Serbian President Milosevic in Belgrade, 
Kozyrev stressed the decision to hold a meeting in Pale between 
the leadership of the Bosnian Serbs, UN spokesmen, and Vitaliy 
Churkin, the Russian president's cochairman. [title as heard] 
  Kozyrev hoped that this meeting--in other words, making a 
decision on this matter--might succeed in lifting the siege of 
the town and in ensuring the creation of a demilitarized zone to 
be handed over to UN forces, as well as, in the broader 
perspective, in working out conditions for observing a truce 
between the Serb and Muslim sides along all lines of contact 
between them. 
  Kozyrev stressed that we are now at a crossroads. We should 
choose a road that leads to peace. Russia, he stressed, will 
back the aspiration of Serbs to have the sanctions lifted. At 
the same time, however, Kozyrev stressed that Russia will strive 
for an end to the siege of the town, which is not in the 
interests of Serbs and may only lead to disaster. 
  The matter of NATO's decision to carry out an air strike 
against Bosnian Serb positions also came up. Kozyrev stressed 
that this was the chief question, and he referred to President 
Milosevic, who had expressed his confidence that the Serbs would 
enter talks on ending the conflict around Gorazde and that they 
were ready to sign an agreement worked out a week ago. 
  Incidentally, everyone was very skeptical about the signing 
of this agreement, which provides for a halt to military 
operations along the whole line of contact. However, the 
Muslims carried out provocations, Kozyrev said, and the Serbs' 
armed response was inappropriate. After that, in Kozyrev' 
opinion, NATO's decision to carry out air strikes against the 
Serbs' positions was inappropriate. So that is how the present 
situation has emerged and how the crisis has been intensified. 
  A further interesting point here is that President Milosevic 
stressed that everything necessary would be done to stop the 
blockade of UN subunits. However, NATO's air strikes had given 
rise to suspicion on the Serbs' part with regard to these 
forces. This is, of course, making all these talks more 
difficult. 
  The final matter raised at the brief news conference was the 
issue of Russia's joining NATO's Partnership for Peace program, 
specifically in connection with events in Yugoslavia. Kozyrev 
stressed that Russia had been in favor of it from the very 
outset, but now there is discussion regarding in what form 
Russia will sign it--in the form of a framework agreement or in 
the form of a broader agreement. In this connection, Moscow 
needs a broader agreement that would rule out 
unilateral--especially unilateral--military actions in zones 
where the sides are closely cooperating, as in Yugoslavia. 
Kozyrev recalled, in this connection, that Russia is acting 
independently but is constantly--not just daily, but literally 
hourly--keeping its partners informed. It would like them to 
reciprocate in the same way. 
  Those, I think, are all the questions that Foreign Minister 
Kozyrev answered at Vnukovo-2 after his arrival there from 
Belgrade, where he met Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. 
  [Announcer] Yevgeniy, I have just one question. What was 
your impression? At this difficult juncture, is there hope in 
the Bosnian crisis about which Kozyrev was speaking, that 
success will be achieved in making a transition toward peace? 
Is there light at the end of the tunnel? Are there grounds for 
optimism, or does the situation still remain very difficult 
indeed? 
  [Osipovskiy] Well, the situation remains difficult, of 
course. Kozyrev stressed two or three times, however, that 
perhaps all the sides now face the issue of choosing the path 
leading to stabilization and peace. In this connection, of 
course, he expressed great hopes regarding the multilateral 
meeting in Pale, which I have already mentioned. 
  [Announcer] Thank you very much. That was our special 
correspondent Yevgeniy Osipovskiy.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Russian Foreign Minister Andrey </F>
Kozyrev correspondent Mikhail Svetlichnyy at Moscow airport on 
17 April; from the "Itogi" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Announcer Yevgeniy Kiselev] Last week was marked by 
a sharp deterioration of the situation in Bosnia, where fighting 
between Serbs and Muslims has resumed, leading to several NATO 
air strikes on Bosnian Serb positions. The Russian 
interpretation of the present situation and a new initiative 
from Russia to settle the crisis was set out in an exclusive 
interview to "Itogi" given by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev, who returned to Moscow from Belgrade several hours ago. 
  [Svetlichnyy] Are we talking about a sticking plaster job or 
some new initiatives from Russia? 
  [Kozyrev] We are talking about an initiative from Russia, 
which, unfortunately does resemble a sticking plaster job, when, 
after provocations from a Muslim warring group in Gorazde, the 
Serbs started using heavy artillery against the town, including 
the site where UN observers were deployed. 
  The next step toward worsening the situation was made by 
NATO, which, in an equally inappropriate and uncalculated 
manner, and I would say, with the same level of responsibility 
as the warring sides, carried out two air strikes, which was 
obviously tantamount to adding fuel to the fire. It is possible 
that the fighters there were just waiting for something like 
that to happen in order to have a free hand and escape from the 
control of the political leadership. 
  And so for a week Vitaliy Churkin -- but I must add that he 
was together with Charles Redman, the U.S. special 
envoy...[pauses] The French are now also actively involved. We 
are maintaining constant contact with French Foreign Minister 
Alain Juppe. Fortunately, Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic 
was, in essence, willing to accept the range of measures that we 
had proposed. This is an initiative by President Yeltsin -- I 
mean my trip to see Slobodan Milosevic. And the range of 
measures has been precisely determined and coordinated. They 
include the lifting of the blockade of Gorazde. Then, there 
must be an agreement on the cessation of hostile actions along 
the entire front line to avoid having to jump from one crisis to 
another -- Sarajevo today, Gorazde tomorrow, and there will be 
plenty of other towns after tomorrow -- so, an agreement on a 
cease-fire along the entire front line. 
  This will create a situation conducive to further 
negotiations on a political settlement. 
  Therefore, Russia will put all its political weight in favor 
of this option. But I would like to note that every step by the 
Serb side will be accompanied by appropriate, decisive pressure 
on our part about the lifting of sanctions. And both this plan, 
the process and the plan to lift the sanctions are fully 
coordinated and are well known. And I think that our Western 
partners have a better understanding of the need for such a 
consistent approach. 
  [Svetlichnyy] This week, both in the State Duma and in 
various political circles here in Moscow, there has been 
discussion concerning Russia not having been informed about the 
bombing. Could you perhaps say now that such actions on the 
part of NATO, without prior notification to the Russian side, 
are completely ruled out? 
  And the second question, as I said, after Russia was not 
informed, in Bosnia and in Yugoslavia, some circles, generally 
speaking, started to adopt a pretty skeptical attitude toward 
the role of Russia. Has this action also not had an effect on 
diminishing Russia's influence in this conflict? 
  [Kozyrev] Well, first, I want to reply that we are acting in 
close contact with the State Duma and the Federation Council. 
Yesterday, at our request, and as a result of joint work, both 
Federation Council Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko, and State Duma 
Chairman Ivan Rybkin sent a message to the leaders of the 
parliaments of Yugoslavia, both of Serbia and of the Bosnian 
Serbs. The Russian Orthodox Church also put forward an 
initiative of this kind. 
  So, I think that Russia has in fact become almost the only 
powerful player on this stage that is not stained with 
irresponsible actions, and it is for this reason that Vitaliy 
Churkin is right there where the issue is being decided. 
  Now, with regard to notification about the strikes, then on 
this occasion we were au fait with events. We are aware that 
Yasushi Akashi, the deputy UN secretary general, who is managing 
the operation in Bosnia had asked for air support -- yesterday 
at about 1700, after the Bosnian Serbs -- and this must be made 
clear -- mounted another artillery attack on Gorazde -- which is 
of course impermissible -- and after about 150 UN servicemen 
found themselves blockaded. 
  Things went so depressingly far that in Sarajevo area the 
Serbs, Serb fighters threatened our subunit of Russian 
peacekeepers with weapons. In other words, I think this shows 
with utmost clarity the degree of irresponsibility of Serb 
fighters. 
  But as a result of these consultations we were able to 
persuade both the United Nations and our NATO partners to stay 
cool this time. After all, consultations are needed not simply 
to say: Well, bomb them if you like, provided you have consulted 
us. Consultations are needed in order to exhaust all 
possibilities. If NATO has no other alternative but to send a 
fighter aircraft or a bomber, we, rather, have a possibility -- 
in any case, we do not mind taking a flight in the evening in 
order to have night talks with the political leadership and to 
try to find a different solution, after all. Well, each has his 
own way, but that is exactly why we say that Russia must be 
consulted and that we should act together.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, April 17 (TASS) -- "Partnership with the 
North Atlantic Alliance was our choice from the very outset", 
Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev told reporters after 
returning from a 24-hour trip to Belgrade. 
  "Two years ago, Russian President Boris Yeltsin sent a 
letter 
to NATO, offering partnership and close cooperation, and at 
present we are seeking for the best ways of promoting these 
ties", he said commenting on Russia's approach towards NATO's 
partnership for peace programme. 
  We are ready to discuss whether a framework agreement should 
be signed first, which is to be followed by a broader one, or 
whether we should conclude a broader partnership pact, without 
signing a preliminary agreement, Kozyrev noted. 
  "What is clear is that we want a more serious and 
substantive 
agreement adequate to relations that should exist between NATO 
and the superpower of Russia...especially an agreement which 
will exclude unilateral actions, particulary military ones, in 
areas where we have to closely cooperate", he said. 
  The Russian Government has agreed in principle to join the 
NATO plan, which offers East European and former Soviet states 
cooperation but stops short of letting them join the alliance. 
  Kozyrev has postponed his visit to Brussels on April 21 to 
sign the Partnership for Peace deal, apparantly angered by 
NATO's air strikes on Serb forces in Bosnia.

<F P=106> [Studio interview with Aleksandra Vasilyevna Achulova, </F>
deputy chairwoman of the State Duma committee for foreign 
affairs; by Sergey Lomakin; from the "Utro" program -- live] 
  [Text] [Lomakin] Several days ago military bombing raids 
were carried out against Serb positions near the city of Gorazde 
in Bosnia-Herzegovia, and I saw it as my duty to invite here a 
person who is directly involved in foreign affairs: Aleksandra 
Vasilyevna Achulova, deputy chairwoman of the duma committee for 
foreign affairs. I would like to ask you the following 
question: We do not know very well what is going on; all we know 
is that bombing took place. What can it lead to, and what has 
it already lead to? Please give us your opinion. 
  [Achulova] Actually, I know what you and many of our 
compatriots and members of the [word indistinct] committee know, 
namely that air raids took place in the town of Gorazde in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. The natural reaction to this fact [pauses] 
the mere fact that NATO forces attempted to solve the problems 
of a conflict existing there in a unilateral fashion by 
conducting an air raid caused a certain reaction. There were 
some casualties, which is a fact that is worthy of attention in 
itself. Apart from other issues, I think this amounts to 
interference in the emerging trend in the peace process place. 
It caused diplomats to be very concerned, and I think the same 
applies to all members of the Security Council. Today, the mere 
decision to use the Air Force, that is, to use force to solve 
problems as complex as the conflict existing there may generate 
the most negative opinions, conclusions and statements, and not 
only in the State Duma which I represent, but also in all 
parliaments of the world. 
  [Lomakin] Some of the politicians wondered if Russian 
prestige has been damaged. It is no secret that we have 
significant interests in this region -- at least they should be. 
How can this affect Russian prestige? 
  [Achulova] The mere fact of what has taken place can 
naturally affect Russian prestige, but as to the moral 
responsibility of such an organization as the UN, it can also 
affect the authority of this organization. In my opinion, and 
in the opinion of many of my colleagues, the mechanism for 
adopting such decisions is incorrect. As you know, Russia itself 
was an initiator in the UN Security Council of the proposal to 
never use force to solve such problems, and naturally the use of 
force in Bosnia-Herzegovina causes a certain amount of damage to 
Russia, to Russian diplomacy. It is a separate issue that the 
procedure itself for adopting such decisions has been breached, 
and no consultations with any member of the Security Council 
were held. In other words, the right for NATO to use air 
support was guaranteed by the UN secretary general. Therefore, I 
think that naturally there was in any case some moral damage 
here because our position on this is known. On the other hand, 
I think that this causes a certain amount of damage to the UN 
Security Council. 
  [Lomakin] As far as I know, the duma adopted a statement on 
this issue yesterday evening. As I understand it, this is the 
State Duma reaction. Could you comment on the adopted statement? 
  [Achulova] Indeed, the State Duma adopted a decision on this 
issue yesterday. The State Duma calls the public's attention to 
the deep concern felt by all deputies of the State Duma over the 
air raid in the town of Gorazde in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The 
statement also emphasizes that the use of force without early 
consultations with members of the Security Council, and the 
Russian representative among them, was against the policy of the 
State Duma as expressed in both official statements and in 
speeches of deputies and representatives of various factions. 
Naturally, [the statement] stresses the need for peaceful 
settlement of this process and a return to the negotiating 
process. It also contains points clearly suggesting that the UN 
convene the Security Council to discuss extensively the 
situation created in Bosnia-Herzegovina as a result of this air 
raid. 
  [Lomakin] Let me ask you a question which you do not have to 
answer. However, if you do answer it, I will be very happy. As 
far as I understand, this is the first time that the UN used 
NATO forces. Do you not have the feeling that Russia and its 
position on this issue is being felt out, and if Russia gives in 
on some issues then, hypothetically speaking, other steps might 
follow? 
  [Achulova] You know, this statement of the State Duma does 
not contain such a position, and it has not been discussed in 
the committee for foreign affairs. However, as a deputy I can 
say that personally I do not rule out such a possibility, such a 
cause for delivering this strike because, from the logical point 
of view, carrying out such a barbarous act in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
[pauses] nevertheless, the statement notes that the State Duma 
finds it necessary to deploy UN forces in this zone, and 
emphasizes that the NATO forces were used in a unilateral 
fashion. What is more, one of the very serious problems being 
discussed in the mass media is the concept which we must join, a 
partnership we must join, a partnership which Russia must sign 
on 21 April. Nevertheless, one of the articles of this 
statement recommends, in a very proper manner, that the 
appropriate committee of the State Duma, such as the committees 
for foreign affairs, geopolitics, and security fully take 
Russian interests into consideration when working out the 
approach of the State Duma to the concept of Russian cooperation 
with NATO. I think that this was not done without a reason. 
Therefore, I think that Russian policy regarding this conflict 
must be consistent, and must in any case exclude the use of 
force to solve this very complex problem. [The statement] again 
calls warring sides to sit at the negotiating table, avoid any 
casualties, and activate the position of Russian Federation 
Foreign Ministry in order to create an effective mechanism for 
the implementation of resolutions of the UN security Council. 
  [Lomakin] Thank you, Aleksandra Vasilyevna. Like many other 
Russians, I still hope that the peacekeeping process has the 
upper hand, because there is probably no other way in Europe. 
  [Achulova] Yes, that is very important. 
  [Lomakin] We are too close to each other in Europe. Thank 
you 
again. We have talked about the position the State Duma adopted 
yesterday evening on bombing of Serb positions in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. We had with us Aleksandra Vasilyevna 
Achulova, deputy chairman of the State Duma committee for 
foreign affairs. Thank you again.

<F P=106> [Remarks by Vitaliy Churkin, Russian special envoy and </F>
deputy foreign minister, to correspondents on 15 April; place 
not given; from the "Novosti" newscast--recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] Our talks in Belgrade were 
centered on the difficult problem of concluding an all-embracing 
agreement on cessation of all hostilities between the Serbs and 
the Muslims in all the territories of Bosnia-Herzegovina. There 
were three extensive, serious, and constructive conversations 
with Serbian President Milosevic. We continued our contacts 
with the leaders [words indistinct]. It is not without 
satisfaction that I can now say that, in my view, I have a 
serious basis for concluding such an agreement. It envisages 
disengagement of the fighting sides; in other words, it will be 
a real agreement on ending the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina and not 
just another declaration on ceasing hostilities. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] As Interfax has learned from Russia's Foreign 
Ministry, the Russian President's Special Envoy, Deputy Foreign 
Minister Vitaliy Churkin arrived in Sarajevo on Saturday to help 
end hostilities and reconcile Serbs and Moslems in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  In the words of a senior Russian diplomat, the negotiations 
have been quite tough, although the sides have revealed some 
encouraging signs. 
  Nonetheless, in his opinion, the achievement of an agreement 
within the next two-three days is hardly possible for political, 
military, and technical reasons. An accord must fix a 
disengagement line between the Serbs and the Moslems, a line 
which in their view, could be a frontier for a long time. The 
negotiators have been bargaining for virtually each mile of the 
mountain terrain. This does not portend a quick completion of 
the negotiating process, the diplomat said. 
  However, he did not rule out that an accord could be signed 
already next week.

  [Text] Zagreb April 16 TASS -- Russian envoy Vitaliy 
Churkin has called for establishing a demilitarised zone around 
Gorazde similar to that in Sarajevo, Sarajevo television said on 
Saturday. 
  Churkin said that this would involve the withdrawal of heavy 
artillery from the 20-kilometer security zone around the city 
and deployment of U.N. peace-keeping troops in the region. 
"This is the only way out of the current chaos," he said. 
  Bosnia-Herzegovina's leaders Alija Izetbegovic and Haris 
Silajdzic demanded at a meeting with U.N. envoy Yasushi Akashi 
guarantees of immediate cease-fire around Gorazde. Otherwise 
Akashi should guarantee that Serb positions will be subjected to 
"energetic air strikes," Izetbegovic said.

of the UN secretary general and the Russian president, held 
talks with the leader of the Bosnian Serbs Radovan Karadzic in 
the Sarajevo suburb of Pale today. This was the first meeting

  An ITAR-TASS correspondent has learned at the Zagreb 
headquarters of peacekeeping forces that at the Pale meeting 
they discussed conditions for a cease-fire under which Bosnian 
Serbs could suspend their offensive on Gorazde.

  [Text] Zagreb April 18 TASS -- Russian envoy to former 
Yugoslavia Vitaliy Churkin failed to talk Bosnian Serbs into 
ceasing their offensive on Gorazde and warned them that attempts 
to seize the city would trigger mass bloodshed. 
  "My only hope is that fire will no longer be opened on the 
town. It would be a huge catastrophe to try and seize it -- this 
would result in an immense bloodshed", he told reporters before 
leaving for Moscow Monday. Churkin arrived in Zagreb from 
Sarajevo. 
  The situation around the Muslim enclave in Bosnia "is poorly 
manageable and completely unexplainable in any reasonable and 
logical terms", he stressed. 
  During his eight-day trip Churkin tried to ensure "a serious 
agreement on ceasing hostilities along the whole of the 
Serbian-Muslim front and proceed to a political settlement and, 
what was always important for the Serbs, to a practical 
beginning of the lifting of sanctions". 
  "Only one thing was demanded from the Serbs in the given 
situation -- to stop their offensive on Gorazde", Churkin said 
and added "unfortunately, they failed to do that". 
  "Defence of Gorazde has collapsed. It is surrounded by 
Serbs. We worried all day yesterday whether they would open 
fire. Luckily they fired only four mines. The situation was 
very tense when three tanks approached the city. Had they 
fired, NATO could have resumed air strikes", he said. 
  According to Churkin, Serbs have reportedly agreed to allow 
the evacuation of the sick from Gorazde, "but for the time being 
we are afraid to do that as the arrival of helicopters can cause 
panic among refugees". 
  Churkin refused to predict further developments in Gorazde. 
He only said that "if they get out of this humanitarian deadend 
we shall see how the developments go".

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Kondrashov] </F>
  [Text] Belgrade, 16 Apr -- Today the Russian side blocked 
new NATO air strikes on Bosnian Serb positions in the Gorazde 
region. 
  An ITAR-TASS correspondent has learned from well-informed 
sources that in the first half of today U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher telephoned Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev and told him that NATO aircraft were preparing to carry 
out strikes against Serbs firing on Gorazde. 
  Vitaliy Churkin, the Russian president's special 
representative, who was in Pale, a Bosnian Serb-controlled 
suburb of Sarajevo, was informed of the content of the 
conversation between Christopher and Kozyrev. 
  Following his contacts with the Bosnian Serb leadership and 
UN forces command, V. Churkin announced that Serb shelling of 
Gorazde was not an issue. Only four mortar explosions had been 
recorded in the town, and UN observers were unable to determine 
precisely which side had fired them. 
  In addition, General Ratko Mladic, the Serb Army commander, 
has assured V. Churkin that Serb forces do not intend to storm 
Gorazde or bring artillery fire to bear on the town. 
  Information received from the Russian president's special 
representative was forwarded to W. Christopher, after which the 
order for NATO air strikes on Serb positions near Gorazde was 
rescinded, the abovementioned sources said.

  [Text] The UN Security Council and NATO will make decisions 
on further actions in Bosnia on the basis of the results of 
talks with the Serbian side, including today's meeting in Pale 
between UN Envoy Yasushi Akashi, Russian diplomat Vitaliy 
Churkin, and Bosnian Serb Leader Radovan Karadzic. ITAR-TASS 
has learned this from a spokesman for the NATO headquarters in 
Brussels. In his words, if UN observers ask for military 
support before any new political decisions are made, then NATO 
aircraft will launch a necessary air strike without delays. 
NATO will do this in compliance with last year's Security 
Council resolution, for which Russia voted too, the NATO 
spokesman stressed.

joining NATO's Partnership for Peace program. Although, as 
Boris Yeltsin bluntly stated on the last day of his visit to 
Spain, "for the time being we are not linking the signing of the

we are in no hurry to sign it." 
  Indeed, is it worth rushing if the partnership program 
claims 
that stability and security in the Euroatlantic region can be 
achieved only on the basis of cooperation and joint actions, yet 
it is not even thought necessary to brief Moscow about NATO's 
bombing of the Serbs? 
  But in that case what is going to happen on the date of 21 
April announced by the mass media, when Andrey Kozyrev is due to 
set off for Brussels in order to sign the document? We have 
learned that there are no official understandings with NATO 
about this time frame. And not everything about this program is 
clear to the Russian parliament yet. 
  At a parliamentary committee hearing Thursday [14 April] on 
the subject of "The Partnership for Peace Program and the Future 
of the CIS," there was a question about how much participation 
in the program will cost us. According to the military, during 
the initial stage the resources allocated to the Defense 
Ministry within the 1994 budget are quite sufficient. True, 
fears are still being expressed that the NATO partnership will 
restrict the potential of the Russian military-industrial 
complex in the arms trade. Defense industry workers themselves 
believe that participation in the program is unlikely to affect 
exports substantially because we have already been squeezed out 
of international weapons markets. 
  By all accounts the signing of the program has been 
postponed 
because, Kozyrev stated, we are interested in much more serious 
relations precluding surprises and unilateral measures, 
especially military ones.

  [Text] Moscow, 15 Apr--"Accords on the division of the 
Russian and Ukrainian Navies based on the shores of the Black 
Sea coast will be reached within 10 days." Ukrainian President 
Leonid Kravchuk said this after the conclusion of talks held 
today between the Russian and Ukrainian delegations at the 
President Hotel in Moscow. 
  According to Kravchuk, the two sides "have instructed the 
Foreign Ministries to begin preparing a full-scale treaty 
between Russia and Ukraine." He said that "a protocol stating 
the intention of the two countries to cooperate in the 
military-technological sphere was signed by them for the first 
time". 
  Kravchuk also said that the question of the resignation of 
Black Sea Fleet Commander [Eduard] Baltin had not been discussed 
but that "the Ukrainian side did not insist, as a matter of 
principle, on his resignation at the talks that took place." 
Kravchuk said that accords had been reached with regard to the 
location of the two countries' naval forces and that their 
parameters had been established in percentage terms. 
  Summing up today's talks, he added: "There are no issues 
between Ukraine and Russia that we are unable to resolve. We 
have fully resolved all problems that existed in our bilateral 
relations."

  [Text] Moscow, 16 Apr (ITAR-TASS) -- After the meeting of 
the Russian and Ukrainian presidents, Boris Yeltsin and Leonid 
Kravchuk, where an agreement on a stage-by-stage settlement of 
the Black Sea fleet issue was signed, the Ukrainian side has 
begun to interpret the accords that have been achieved in its 
typical cavalier manner. Even before the talks provided for in 
the agreement, where the parameters of how the fleet is to be 
divided are to be discussed, the Ukrainian side began to put 
forward through the mass media its own options of the lease 
itself, its length, and the locations where the Russian Black 
Sea Fleet is to be based, says a statement by Vyacheslav 
Kostikov, the press secretary of the Russian president. In it, 
Kostikov said the following: 
  Russian President Boris Yeltsin yesterday stated during the 
talks that he does not accept the haggling tone, which is 
lowering the level of relations and trust. The Russian side has 
to remind Ukraine once again about the harsh realities and 
imperatives that underline the agreement just signed. Careless 
words and actions are out of place here when the Black Sea Fleet 
is at stake. Moscow urges the Kiev politicians and the military 
not to embark on unilateral actions that could cast doubt on the 
sincerity of the negotiation process.

  [Text] A high-ranking official from the Russian Foreign 
Ministry stressed that Moscow had given consideration to the 
tragic incident in northern Iraq where two U.S. fighters had 
erroneously shot down two helicopters carrying UN 
representatives. "We would like to express our deep regret and 
our condolences to the relatives and friends of those who died," 
the diplomat said in an interview with Interfax today. 
  "However, the incident has caused us serious concern since 
this happened in the so-called no flight zone in Iraqi 
Kurdistan, to the north of the 32nd parallel, controlled by the 
"coalition deterrence forces" consisting of air units of the 
Western participants in the anti-Iraqi coalition, the activities 
of which were not defined by appropriate international 
decisions," the Russian diplomat emphasized. 
  He said the world community should expect careful and 
impartial investigations into this tragic incident and to be 
informed on all the details of it.

<F P=106> [Mikhail Pogorelyy report: "An Accidental Error or a </F>
Logical Tragedy?"] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] The first impression from the 
tragedy in the Iraqi skies was: An impossible, tragic mistake 
has occurred. The situation, however, gives rise to a number of 
legitimate questions. Answers to them may not be the most 
pleasant for the U.S. military establishment. 
  First, about the pilots' professional level. Judging by 
their initial testimony, they mistook U.S.-made UH-60 Blackhawk 
helicopters for Iraqi Soviet-built Mi-8's. Indeed, outwardly 
they bear a remote resemblance, but with the slightest doubts, 
were the pilots not supposed to fly around what they saw as 
suspicious objects and make sure what it was, friend or foe? 
Moreover, were they not supposed to activate their Friend or 
Foe identification system? If none of this was done, the 
logical conclusion is: The fighters used the very first 
opportunity to show the Iraqis who is master in their airspace. 
  The second question and the answer to it bears on the 
performance characteristics of U.S. combat aviation. If the 
F-15 pilots used the interrogator after all, did they therefore 
receive no confirmation that the targets were not friendly? In 
addition, as Lieutenant General Richard Keller, chief of staff 
of the U.S. Command Europe -- responsible for the military part 
of operation Provide Comfort-2 -- who was summoned to the 
Pentagon explained, at the time of the incident airspace to the 
north of the 36th parallel was monitored by AWACS aircraft. 
Their onboard radars and computers are designed precisely to 
detect and track air targets and guide the interceptors onto 
them. In other words, one cannot rule out a malfunction in the 
operation of these "super modern arms and equipment systems" 
which are so zealously promoted by the Americans. [passage

  [Text] PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat, who arrives in Moscow 
today for talks with the Russian leadership, hopes to reach 
agreement on intensifying Russian mediation in the Middle East 
settlement, a high-ranking representative of the Palestinian 
embassy in Moscow told a RIA correspondent. He said that the 
PLO head hopes that Russia could play the main role in the 
resumption of the bilateral Palestinian-Israeli talks on Gaza 
and Jericho, broken off as a result of the tragic events in 
Hebron. The Russian Foreign Ministry told RIA that 'Arafat's 
visit will last until 20 April. The itinerary envisions talks 
with the leadership of the foreign policy department, meetings 
with State Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin, Internal Affairs Minister 
Viktor Yerin, and also with Aleksey II, patriarch of All Russia.

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: By diplomatic </F>
correspondents Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy and others] 
  [Text] The regulations providing for passing of ships via 
the Black Sea straits of Bosporus and Dardanelles which have 
been unilaterally imposed by Turkey early this year and are due 
to go into effect since July 1 violate the generally accepted 
norms of the international law. Russia "seriously opposes" 
these regulations, deputy director of the legal department 
within the Russian Foreign Ministry Yakov Ostrovskiy declared in 
his interview with Interfax. This February he headed a Russian 
inter-departmental delegation which negotiated in Ankara with 
the Turkish authorities on this issue. 
  The diplomat explained that passing of ships via the Black 
Sea straits is regulated by the international convention 
Montreux signed by the USSR, Turkey, and several other states in 
1938. "Turkey believes that several provisions of the Convention 
can be replaced by its domestic legislation. Russia insists 
that the Montreux Convention should be strictly observed. If 
Ankara thinks that it is obsolete, let it introduce amendments 
in accordance with the established order," said Ostrovskiy. 
  He pointed out that the international convention on sea law 
dated 1982 regulates the order of ships' passing via the 
straits. "According to the Convention, none of the coastal 
states should hinder free navigation via the straits," said 
Ostrovskiy. 
  In his words, "settling of this situation" would largely 
depend upon the sitting of the navigation security committee of 
the International Sea Organization (one of the UN specialized 
offices -- Interfax). It is due to be held mid-May in London. 
"Of course, Turkey does not intend to present the regulations 
for this sitting thinking that it is its domestic document. 
Participation of the Turkish representatives in the discussion 
of international navigation rules in straits is a positive 
factor," said Ostrovskiy. 
  He expressed opinion that the Turkish provision on passing 
large ships via the Bosporus strait in a strict sequence 
"slightly contradicts" to the Convention." According to new 
Turkish rules, all ships must wait when a large ship enters the 
gulf. This creates a lot of inconveniences," said Ostrovskiy. 
  He specially emphasized that the Turkish regulations 
establish "rather a complex order" of passing for military 
ships. "This contradicts to the generally accepted norms. 
Military ships enjoy immunity and cannot be subjected to 
customs, sanitation, or any other inspection. The Turkish party 
has nothing to contradict. However, it promised to hand over a 
document via its Embassy which would stipulate that the 
regulations do not concern military ships. However, we have not 
received such a document yet," said Ostrovskiy. 
  In his opinion, "one can understand the Turkish party 
because 
it cares about its security but sometimes its logic looks 
strange enough." "If we take it into consideration then it is 
possible just to close the Black Sea straits. Then there will 
be no accidents for sure. But this is not a way out of this 
situation," said Ostrovskiy.

  [Text] Hanoi, 16 Apr -- The Russian Government delegation 
headed by Deputy Chairman of the Russian Federation Government 
Yuriy Yarov today visited a Russian military installation in Cam 
Ranh Bay in Vietnam. 
  Answering questions from the ITAR-TASS correspondent on the 
eve of the visit, the Russian deputy prime minister praised the 
present state of bilateral cooperation in the military field, a 
new impetus to which was, in his words, given by a visit to 
Russia in March by [Lieutenant General] Dao Dinh Luyen, chief of 
the General Staff of the Vietnamese People's Army. Yarov noted 
that the visit to Cam Ranh Bay was purely fact-finding. At the 
same time, he said that the visit could result in new proposals 
on joint mutually beneficial use of the installation, even 
though the problem had not been discussed in the course of the 
present visit to Vietnam. 
  The materials and machinery supplies station at Cam Ranh 
peninsula is at present used by Russia on the basis of the 
agreement signed by the former USSR and Vietnam in 1981. It 
expires in 2004. The numbers of the Russian staff servicing the 
installation have been reduced by about three-quarters compared 
with 1980, while cooperation with the Vietnamese side has been 
transferred to a commercial basis.

  [Text] The President of the Ukrainian Union of 
Industrialists and Entrepreneurs Leonid Kuchma told newsmen in 
Kiev Thursday that two ultra-radical forces had won strong 
representation in the national parliament. Speaking in the wake 
of the Union's fourth emergency congress, Kuchma referred to the 
nationalistic forces of the country's western provinces and the 
Communists and Socialists. He said Ukraine was following in the 
footsteps of Russia. 
  Now that forty-odd legislators had joined his Inter-regional 
Reform Bloc, Kuchma was confident the bloc would emerge as the 
centrist faction in the new parliament. 
  The centrist-oriented forces in parliament must stop what 
Kuchma described as a tug-of-war game between the Communists and 
nationalistically-minded radicals, and insure the formation of a 
new Cabinet on a professional, and not political, basis. 
  Even parliament must be denied the right to amend key 
economic legislation, or, said Kuchma, Ukraine's international 
image will be damaged beyond repair. 
  Pending new presidential elections the lawmakers should help 
President Kravchuk safeguard civic peace. 
  The Crimea had been and must be part of Ukraine. In the 
meantime, Kuchma said, Kiev was losing to Simferopol both 
politics- and economy-wise. But, he said, the Crimea would 
remain Ukrainian if the reforms and economy started working. 
  The policy of Ukrainization was as erroneous as that of 
Russification because, Kuchma said, one action always brings a 
reaction. 
  Unfortunately, Kuchma said, political consideratins always 
prevailed over economics, which provoked social cataclysms, in 
Ukraine. 
  According to INTERFAX-Ukraine, the top executives of a 
number 
of Ukrainian banks and industrial facilities are holding a 
working conference in Kiev on 15 April.

in particular, expresses concern over the progress of events 
around this collective. "The latest developments prove that 
attempts are being made to shift the activity of the service 
from the legal sphere to political, in which we have no right to 
interfere," says the statement. "This is fraught with the 
disorganization of the operational and search activity under 
conditions of growing crime rates and increasing danger of the 
emergence of political terrorism." 
  Accusations to the effect that the Crimean Security Service 
"went over to Ukraine" are senseless, because no one questions 
the provision of the law "On Security Service of Crimea" which 
stipulates that it is a regional body of the Security Service of 
Ukraine. Such reproaches evoke surprise, to say the least, 
because they are made also by "separate employees of the Crimean 
president's administration who are former executives of the 
former KGB. It is they who should be aware of the consequences 
of involving the special purpose law enforcement body in 
political confrontation better than anyone else."

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov, </F>
by Larysa Troyan, on 30 March, place not given: "Political 
Pressure Will Be Neutralized by Political Resistance"] 
  [Excerpts] [Troyan] My first question is to warm you up: 
Do you like being president? 
  [Meshkov] That is some warm-up! Frankly speaking, I have 
had no time to think about it. 
  [Troyan] How would you comment on the results of the 
Ukrainian Supreme Council elections? 
  [Meshkov] Outright fascists in legislative seats are too 
dangerous for anybody. This is an extremely unfavorable 
situation for the Crimea. 
  [Troyan] Why did you appeal to the Crimeans not to vote for 
Ukrainian Supreme Council deputies and to take ballots home 
instead? 
  [Meshkov] This was an attempt to protect ourselves from the 
extreme forms of nationalism. 
  [Troyan] How would you assess the preliminary results of the 
Crimean legislative elections? 
  [Meshkov] The results denied the claims that at the 
presidential elections our electors, the citizens of the 
Republic of Crimea, voted against the former administration 
rather than for a concrete candidate and a concrete program. It 
has turned out that they voted for the "Russia" bloc. 
  [Troyan] Do you think that this stance is a kind of 
reproach, a challenge for the Ukrainian leadership, an overt 
orientation toward Russia, or something else? 
  [Meshkov] This was normal human reaction to the 
demonstration of extreme nationalist trends tolerated by the 
current Ukrainian leadership. Thus, the leadership has in a way 
become a promoter of nationalist policies. This was an attempt 
to abandon unwise economic and social policies. Besides, the 
Crimean people are part of the Russian nation. 
  [Troyan] How would you evaluate the results of the Crimean 
poll? I interpret these results in the following way: Crimeans 
have embarked on the road to unconditional autonomy. Am I not 
right? 
  [Meshkov] Crimeans cast their votes for having the right to 
be the masters of their own fates, to independently build normal 
and logical economic relations, and to determine the optimal 
variants of these relations. Over the last two years, economic 
here reform has been artificially blocked. Unwise tax and 
customs policies, as well as many other stupid things have been 
forced on us, although they are absolutely unacceptable for the 
Crimea. All these measures have been dictated by the ambitions 
of people with nationalist views. 
  [Troyan] Are you not expecting similar "forcing" on the side 
of Russia? 
  [Meshkov] I am not. We are speaking about maximizing the 
ability to pursue independent economic policies in cooperation 
with both Russia and Ukraine. This is not a drive toward 
separation, once characteristic of Ukraine in its relations with 
Russia. On the contrary, this is a desire to unify economies 
and enter the common economic space with Russia and republics 
like Kazakhstan, which are ready for such unification. The 
Crimean citizens are ready for this too, and this was confirmed 
by recent events. Our people are not driven by purely economic 
considerations. They also need a new kind of, let me put it 
this way, labor motivation. When unacceptable barriers are 
removed between Russia and Crimea, when there are no more 
customs houses and checkpoints favored only by inefficient 
officials, everybody will gain from this. 
  [Troyan] If I properly understand what you mean, the Crimea 
aims to float between Scylla and Charybdis of Russian and 
Ukrainian problems to achieve a breakthrough in economic reform. 
  [Meshkov] We have potential to carry out reform rapidly. We 
are not burdened with the gigantic mass of unresolved problems 
resting on Ukraine's shoulders. Neither do we have problems 
like those Russia has, given its vast territory and colossal 
economic structure. 
  [Troyan] Do you believe that the Crimea might become a kind 
of experimental project, a future model for the expeditious 
introduction of reform in both Russia and Ukraine? 
  [Meshkov] We do not aim to become a model, the so-called 
"five-year plan heroes," although we would have nothing against 
becoming "production leaders." I believe that we will have 
enough wisdom to choose the most optimal economic scheme, all 
the more so since we are not limited by any ideological or 
nationalist restrictions. The influence of the Communist Party 
in the Crimea, unlike Ukraine and Russia, is virtually minimal. 
  [Troyan] In other words, you believe that Crimeans are 
standing on the ground of sound pragmatism. 
  [Meshkov] Yes. I would say that Crimean mentality is rather 
individualistic due to the kind of life that we live. The 
Crimea has been a melting pot of various civilizations and 
cultures -- this has always been accepted without antagonism or 
hindrance. In other words, here we are dealing with a higher 
degree of self-respect, and thus respect toward other people. 
  [Troyan] Does this mean that your favorite book is Vasiliy 
Aksenov's "Island Crimea"? 
  [Meshkov, laughing] It is one of my favorites. 
  [Troyan] If this is no secret, what prompted your choice of 
Mr. Saburov for deputy prime minister? Was that age-long 
friendship or political sympathy? 
  [Meshkov] It is still too early to talk about this. There 
are a lot of arguments in favor of Saburov's candidacy.... 
  [Troyan] How long have you known him? 
  [Meshkov, disregarding the question] ....and I accepted 
these 
arguments. [passage omitted] 
  [Troyan] Who will form your new Cabinet of Ministers? Will 
Saburov be granted powers for this? 
  [Meshkov] Of course he will. Saburov and I shared 
responsibility for the future of economic reform in the Crimea, 
and now we are going to share responsibility for the forming of 
the government. 
  [Troyan] In an interview conducted on 27 March, Leonid 
Kravchuk said: "The Crimea will remain in Ukraine regardless of 
a further scenario, given that both the Crimea receives drinking 
water and supplies for sowing from Ukraine." How would you 
comment on that? 
  [Meshkov] President Kravchuk probably meant something else, 
but this phrase could be understood as follows: If the Crimea 
remains in Ukraine, it will have both drinking water and seeds 
for sowing; if it chooses to live without Ukraine, Ukraine will 
not supply either water or seeds. I do not like the ambiguity 
of this statement, because in this case the problem can be posed 
differently: If Ukraine's attitude toward the Crimea is normal, 
Ukraine will receive both gas from Turkmenistan and electric 
power from Russia. The very Dnieper water then, so to say, will 
be supplied by Russia. I would not like to talk this way; I do 
not want to accept this unfriendly tone. There would be no 
unfriendly attitude if we spoke about our share in Ukraine's 
national wealth. This [Ukraine's] stance is yet more proof that 
the Crimea is alien to Ukraine. 
  [Troyan] According to President Kravchuk, Ukraine is ready 
to delegate vast economic powers to the Crimea. Here is another 
quote from Leonid Kravchuk's interview: "Rumors about the 
introduction of any other currency are absurd. However, we 
should remove political issues from the Crimean agenda." 
  [Meshkov] We would be more than happy to remove political 
issues from the agenda, provided that nobody meddles in our 
economy. We have no other intentions. 
  [Troyan] Are you going to create a free economic zone? 
  [Meshkov] We are going to create a normal economy and 
planning to provide it with appropriate legal acts. Our only 
request is: Do not interrupt us; do not force on us those laws 
that were adopted to satisfy somebody's whims and have nothing 
in common with economic principles. 
  If we are permitted we will take care of the Crimean economy 
without anybody's help. If somebody attempts to exert pressure 
and reap political dividends from letting us overstep some 
foolish law; if somebody attempts to use the formal discrepancy 
between our and Ukrainian normative acts for political pressure, 
in this case we will react by means of political methods. 
Political pressure will be neutralized by political resistance. 
  [Troyan] Speaking about political pressure you only mean one 
side, namely Kiev. Does this mean that you totally dismiss 
similar actions on the side of Moscow? 
  [Meshkov] I do not expect such actions from the Russian 
side. It would be blasphemy if somebody told us that we would 
receive gasoline and lumber only as long as we stay with Russia. 
  [Troyan] Thus, your relations with Russia are developing in 
a more favorable manner? 
  [Meshkov] No. But the Russian leader will never utter words 
similar to President Kravchuk's. 
  [Troyan] The press has reported your interest in Mr. 
Yavlinskiy. What prompted it? 
  [Meshkov] In light of my professional skills (economic 
issues were treated very seriously at Moscow State University 
and I have acquired a taste for economy), I believe that I can 
rather impartially evaluate Mr. Yavlinskiy's propensities and 
the correctness and logic of his suggestions. That is the 
source of my deep respect for this talented economist. 
  [Troyan] Does this mean that Yavlinskiy will take part in 
drafting the economic model of Crimean reform? 
  [Meshkov] I would be extremely grateful to Mr. Yavlinskiy 
for any kind of assistance. By the way, I want to point out 
that East European economists are ready to render us similar 
aid. According to preliminary reports Lady Thatcher is also 
ready to do so, although she has not confirmed this yet. 
  [Troyan] Are you really determined to ensure simultaneous 
circulation of both rubles and karbovantsi? There are also 
rumors about dollars and German marks. 
  [Meshkov] We will be happy to accept yen, guldens, and 
pounds too. 
  [Troyan] What do your economic advisers say about this? 
What do they predict? 
  [Meshkov] They predict an inflow of capital. 
  [Troyan] Do Crimeans believe that there will be a stream of 
foreign investments? 
  [Meshkov] No. There is no euphoria or anticipation of 
streams of investments. We are ready to provide possibilities 
to earn money in the Crimea on the basis of mutual advantage and 
sober calculation. Our citizens will grant assistance. I do 
not mean exploitation of people. I want to underline that we 
are devoid of all kinds of ideological dogmas. Participation in 
developing the Crimean economy is profitable.[passage omitted] 
  [Troyan] Do you guarantee that there will be no corruption 
in your executive bodies? 
  [Meshkov] I do! 
  [Troyan] How are going to fight this evil phenomenon? As 
far as I know, humankind has not invented an efficient medicine 
to cure this disease. 
  [Meshkov] There is medicine, and a very strong one. It will 
be applied. [passage omitted] 
  [Troyan] Why do you tend to avoid speaking about Mr. 
Zhirinovskiy? 
  [Meshkov] First of all, because he is my university mate; 
there exists an unwritten Moscow University brotherhood of a 
special kind. Secondly, this is undoubtedly a talented person. 
A certain newspaper reported that I admire Mr. Zhirinovskiy. 
There is no admiration; however, I developed respect for his 
political talent regardless of anybody's views. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Some sensational information was disclosed 
yesterday at the Ukrainian National Entrepreneurship Assembly 
session. Oleksandr Dudko, chairman of the Crimean Union of 
Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, presented three decrees signed 
by Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov, all of which bore the date 
of signing, registration numbers, and, as it was put, still-wet 
ink. Practically, this means that the Crimea has entered a new 
economic era, something that industrialists and entrepreneurs 
have been trying to obtain from the government for several long 
months. The documents signed by Yuriy Meshkov implemented the 
23 June decree of Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk, "On Open 
Economic Regime in the Territory of the Crimean Republic."

<F P=106> [Comments by Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk edited by </F>
Nikolay Zakrevskiy: "Leonid Kravchuk: `I Support the Idea That 
Land With Facilities Be Traded'"] 
  [Text] A president's word is not a decree yet, and even 
not a request for action. Leonid Kravchuk's position, however, 
as well as his viewpoint eventually have an impact on decisions 
and resolutions we adopt. Therefore, there is a great interest 
in Leonid Kravchuk's statements and comments, primarily, with 
the media. 
  This time, an unofficial meeting with our country's leader 
has been held at the House of Cinema at the initiative of the 
"Market Reform" press club affiliated to the Union of Ukrainian 
Journalists Kiev branch. Here are certain opinions of the 
president: 
<H5>  On the Current Government... </H5>
  I cannot say that I am ashamed of Yukhym Zvyahilskyy's 
government, because, despite the whole complexity of the 
situation, the first steps toward stabilization have just been 
taken. We have started to earn hard currency to pay for energy 
resources. Additionally, preparations for the monetary reform 
and other transformations have already begun. The government 
must not be blamed now. Every government does what it can. The 
next government will do the same in a better and a different 
manner. I am convinced of this. Taking into account the 
situation on the eve of the parliamentary elections, we 
considered it inexpedient to change the government for just six 
months. 
<H5>  On Economic Federalization... </H5>
  I support greater economic freedom for the regions in such 
areas as collecting and spending revenues, budget relations, and 
dividing and administrating property. This requires appropriate 
sources of revenues, which would be in line with the law. My 
decree on granting powers to four oblasts confirmed this 
viewpoint. To avoid contradictions, however, these powers 
should be amended by laws. The question of full federalization 
of the country is, primarily, objectively unachievable; second, 
it would obstruct reforms and even threaten our country's 
existence. The issue of federalization is thus far premature. 
Although I do not rule out the possibility that it can be 
addressed in the future, it should be based on elaborated 
mechanisms of economic independence and perfection of political 
institutions. 
  For example, I have met with miners. They are ready for 
independent management. In such a case, however, a problem 
arises before them and the state. To grant greater or full 
independence means to halt subsidies. If the government stops 
subsidizing the coal industry, coal prices will increase 
considerably, since the conditions of coal mining in Donbass are 
extremely complex. Higher prices for coal will trigger an 
increase in all prices. These problems cannot be resolved at 
one time and taking into account only one factor. In Ireland, 
which I had an opportunity to visit, the process of closing 
certain mines lasted 10-12 years, in order to find new 
workplaces and create social conditions. We cannot but 
subsidize miners, pay them wages, or give other branches 
depending on miners such as metallurgy or chemical industry the 
opportunity to develop. It is now very hard to radically change 
the situation. 
<H5>  On Private Capital... </H5>
  If we do not have private capital, we can forget about the 
market economy. A civilized market without private property, 
capital, or financial and banking organizations is impossible. 
All the talk about the state regulating or predicting 
consequences is only talk. One can talk and act, but one can 
also hamper business by talking. I support more decisive 
reforms. I would like the Supreme Council to adopt a resolution 
according to which land with facilities could be traded. 
However, when I issued the decree on selling uncompleted 
constructions with land, they adopted an amendment canceling the 
decree. Until the parliament, the Executive Branch, and local 
administrations receive clear-cut decisions regarding this 
issue, we will not be able to avoid mistakes and swindles in 
economic policy. 
<H5>  On Western Aid... </H5>
  The $700-million aid granted by the U.S. Congress is 
absolutely not connected with our budget and its deficit; nor 
even with our movement toward the market economy. These funds 
are connected with special assistance in disarmament. Regarding 
IMF loans for economic reforms, they stick to a firm stance -- 
show us your budget and economic programs. Those who grant 
loans want to know where the money will be directed and whether 
it will be returned. Will the money be spent on wages or on a 
new Volvo? In the United States, I was told openly: Show us 
your laws regarding investments. Who will act as a guarantor of 
the loans? In what way are you forming your market? 
<H5>  On Introducing the Hryvnya... </H5>
  I believe that an operation such as the monetary reform must 
not be secret. This decision should be understandable to all 
people and carried out openly in all aspects concerning citizens 
and their banking accounts, enterprises, company staffs, and 
property. The mechanism should be worked out in detail and 
promulgated. Of course, not everybody will be happy. Such 
things do not happen in the world. But, we cannot allow a 
situation similar to the one that occurred before: People get 
up in the morning; all stores are closed; and they are told that 
there will be a new currency. I, as the president, will never 
allow this to happen, since this would mean nationwide turmoil. 
Reforms should be for the people, not for certain individuals 
in secret offices. The problem, however, lies not here, but in 
a stabilizing fund. When we manage to reach an agreement on 
budget issues and obtain a stabilizing loan from the IMF, we 
will be on the verge of solving the problem of introducing the 
hryvnya.

<F P=106> [Article by Yevgeniy Vyatkin, candidate of technical </F>
sciences: "So That We Would Not Need Bast Sandals..."] 
  [Text] In the author's opinion, we have to seriously 
prepare ourselves for unemployment in the coal industry. 
  "The Coal Industry Is in Its Death Throes," was the sad 
title 
of M. Yermakov's article, published in DONBASS on 5 January 
1994. It describes disproportions in the prices for coal and 
materials needed for its production. That the miners' 
dissatisfaction with wages, shortage of materials and spare 
parts results in both a lower coal production and a lack of 
discipline, sloppiness. That mines need subsidies, without which 
they will not survive. But at the same time, says the author, we 
need to increase labor productivity and cut the labor force. 
  The question of needing to cut the labor force is not new. 
It 
is also linked with another issue--closing the mines with poor 
production indicators. However, no cardinal measures have yet 
been taken in this direction. Year by year, this changes for the 
worse the indicators of the sector's overall operation. The past 
year of 1993 is not an exception--production of coal and labor 
productivity fell by more than 13 percent, while the size of the 
labor force remained practically unchanged. The situation is 
more or less the same at Donetsk Oblast mines. Many money-losing 
mines were still in operation thanks to financial and credit 
propping by the state. This made it possible to support a great 
number of jobs in order to avoid unemployment. But it also 
contributed to unprecedented inflation in the country. It can no 
longer continue this way. 
  Today inefficient mines cannot count on large-scale help on 
the part of the state. There is one way to survive--mobilization 
of internal reserves. But not all reserves can be used by mines 
without state support. Some subsidies will be needed. A subsidy 
is the state sharing in the coal producers' expenses. The 
state's share depends on its capabilities and the need for coal. 
At the same time, coal producers must ensure the required volume 
and production cost. 
  Great Britain's experience is interesting in this respect: 
It 
carried out a program of closing unprofitable mines soon after 
the notorious strike of British miners. The state there set a 
maximum for production costs the mines could achieve. If that 
value was exceeded, the mine was closed. Over a four-year 
period, while maintaining the same total level of coal 
production, 60 mines in the country were closed, with a 
40-percent labor force reduction. 
  Ukraine's Gosugleprom began a similar undertaking. 
Twenty-one 
mines with low technical and economic indicators have been 
selected (including 12 in Donetsk Oblast), and for them targets 
have been set for 1994 requiring an increase in labor 
productivity and reduction in production cost. If it turns out 
that it is impossible to improve the situation by the means 
available, the mines will be closed. It is clear that other 
mines will follow in the footsteps of this first group. 
  It is clear that the road to better productivity and 
production cost indicators lies through ensuring effective 
employment for the population. The process of improving 
employment includes freeing workers, redistributing them among 
spheres of employment, existence of unemployment, ensuring high 
labor productivity, and remuneration by results of labor. Many 
people found themselves unprepared for this process, which by 
itself is not unexpected for the industry. First and foremost 
unprepared for an understanding that production should employ as 
many workers as it needs, not as many as there are available. In 
practice, it manifested itself in such associations as 
Artemugol, Dzerzhinskugol, and Ordzhonikidzeugol, where the size 
of the labor force practically has not changed since 1992, while 
the output of coal fell by 20-24 percent. It is obvious that 
when production declines, it is logical to let some workers go. 
If a decline is temporary, it is a temporary lay-off. The heart 
of the solution to employment problem is creating a core of 
skilled and productive workers at enterprises (associations). 
The size of the remaining labor force must change on the basis 
of production needs. 
  There are many ways to provide employment for persons 
released from primary production. In particular, there is the 
known practice of creating auxiliary enterprises. Donetskugol 
association has experience in this respect. There are 
enterprises in its system that make sausage and furniture, churn 
butter, and manufacture equipment. Yu. Seregin wrote about it in 
the article "Will Donetskugol-lapti-selkhoz-prom Save Us If the 
Mines Are Closed?" (DONBASS, 13 November 1993). Actually, the 
association does not yet make lapti [bast sandals]. But there is 
no doubt that the approach taken by the association, which may 
include different solutions, will help the miners to weather 
transition years. And the society as a whole will benefit from 
it, since people will be paid wages for the results of their 
labor instead of "pay" for idling during the periods of decline 
and cutbacks in the primary production. 
  There is also another important ask--we need to break the 
dependency psychology of some collectives. As is known, when our 
miners insist on their demands, they are inclined to point out 
the income of American miners. But one has to look at himself 
with a critical eye and ask himself why labor productivity of 
five to 10 tonnes a month has become so common? This is several 
times less than the level reached by Ukraine in the past and 
tens of times less than the yield produced by American coal 
miners. So at whose expense do 
the collectives with poor labor results intend to live? 
  Growth of labor productivity in the sector as a whole is 
hampered by shortcomings in the development of the mine 
inventory. The oblast currently has many small mines: 67 percent 
of the mines have the production capacity of less than 60,000 
tonnes a month, and 22 percent have less than 300,000 tonnes a 
month. Other countries have long disposed of such things. So 
perhaps we should now speed up the closing or denationalization 
of small mines? This will allow to use of materials and labor 
resources more effectively. The capacities being taken off line 
may be compensated for by increasing the rate of utilization of 
capacities of remaining enterprises. There are reserves in this 
respect, since last year in the oblast on average capacities 
were being utilized at a 77-percent rate, and in almost 
one-third of the mines, at less than 60 percent. 
  And, finally, the measures for reanimation of the coal 
industry will be successful only when the workers 
unconditionally accept the rule that "there should be discipline 
at work!" and wages are commensurate only with the results. This 
should reinforce workers' understanding that this is no longer 
the time when, as Nikolay Ivanovich Bukharin said: "From a hired 
slave, the proletariat of our country became a hegemon." These 
days all of us must first and foremost become civilized hired 
labor, and in addition, we may become co-owners of enterprises. 
The more we persist in not understanding it, the worse it will 
be for us, and the more realistic the prospect that we will 
indeed need bast sandals...

  The UN- and Russia-brokered four-day talks were held in

  The sides remained adamant in their approach to a proposed

peacekeepers should control the whole territory of the breakaway

<F P=106> [Speech by Latvian Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs at the </F>
Latvian University in Riga: "Latvian Security: Aspects of 
Internal and Foreign Policy" -- live] 
  [Text] Hello, esteemed colleagues. I am very happy to be 
here at the university, this time as a guest, but I am convinced 
that the time will come when I will be again among you. 
  So: Aspects of foreign and internal policy of Latvian 
security. I would like to begin this lecture with the idea that 
Latvian security is a regional constituent part of European 
security and stability. The significance of this topic today 
(?stems) not only from increasing international instability and 
countless reasons for possible conflicts, but also (?from) a 
very emotional and politicized discussion in Latvia on the 
signing of a pact between the Russian Federation and Latvia. 
There is no shortage of the most diverse opinions and 
arguments. However, in spite of whatever I may say today, one 
always has to bear in mind that Latvian security can be, and is 
partly already, seen as a constituent part of European security 
and stability. That is the first point which underlies all my 
considerations. The second is Latvia's specific feature that 
our foreign and internal security are unusually and closely 
interrelated. 
  I will pay attention today primarily to the political rather 
than military aspect of security; not to mechanisms, but to 
trying to define the cornerstones of Latvian security and 
reasons for instability. I will also try to determine what the 
response to the development of the international situation 
should be. 
  First, I will talk about the practice in international 
policy 
at the end of the 20th Century; next, about Latvia's place in 
the new world order; and then about the fundamental dimensions 
of Latvian foreign policy and the aspects of internal policy in 
Latvia, and connection (?between them). At the end we will try 
to assess possible responses and actions, and the consequences 
of those actions for Latvia. 
  During the major part of the 20th Century, in spite of the 
talk about the collective security system and also in spite of 
some real efforts to put into practice such a security system, 
priority has always been given to military security doctrines 
and, correspondingly, to use of force. Therefore, the concepts 
of security and national security have been practically 
synonymous with military security in international practice. To 
a certain extent that was understandable, because there was not 
only confrontation between great powers and between groups of 
states, but there was also the active struggle to divide the 
world, to redivide it and widen spheres of influence. Thus, the 
criteria of security of great powers and national security were 
mainly directed not inward but outward, toward spheres of 
influence and hegemonic satisfaction of national interests far 
beyond state borders. The best and the most striking example, 
of course, though I would not like to say the best, is the 
Molotov-Ribbentrop pact of 1939 and the forceful incorporation 
of the Baltic states into the composition of the USSR in 1940. 
  Principles of European security have changed considerably 
and have acquired new dimensions at the end of the 20th Century. 
In order to avoid a crisis and to reduce instability in Europe, 
Europe directs its attention mainly toward the dimension of 
various international institutions. That means that the final 
aim of the international community is to achieve a stable system 
of collective security so that its resolutions can also become 
significant. The concepts of classical security and security 
guarantees have become old-fashioned, and now participation in a 
collective security system comes into place as a guarantee. 
With this I want to stress that participation in the Conference 
on Security and Cooperation in Europe, the North Atlantic 
Cooperation Council, the Partnership for Peace program, and 
other European institutions is already, in its way, the Latvian 
security guarantee, because with this we are a constituent part 
of that process. 
  What is an alternative to this participation? Only isolation 
and the prospect of being left in the dark zone. It was planned 
in Europe some time ago to create a network of interrelated 
institutes, which would provide an opportunity to use various 
methods of handling crises--both political and economic crises; 
but in finding a solution, we must apply in such crises only the 
method of talks--not military methods, even though the time has 
already come for military methods. 
  As the new world order after the Cold War is characterized 
by 
rather great disorder, and there are the most diverse sources of 
conflicts, the concept of security has acquired a new definition 
and we cannot allow ourselves to repeat the failures of the 
international system in the past, especially those that followed 
the end of World War I, when the principles of self-isolation 
and nationalized security were gaining the upper hand. With the 
strictly fixed positions of the Cold War disappearing. as well 
as the time when situations could be easily modelled, the time 
of set concepts has passed too. The situation in the world, in 
Europe, and in and around Latvia is very dynamic. The most 
pragmatic approach at the moment is clearly to formulate the 
fundamental basis of Latvian security policy and foreign 
policy--and only the fundamental basis--so that we can choose 
the most appropriate solutions for Latvia when the situation 
changes. 
  At the moment, the state president and the government of the 
Fifth Saeima of the Republic of Latvia have come to face a 
significant choice which is related to Latvia's international 
and national interests, the choice which will determine whether 
we get involved in the new world order or not. The cornerstone 
of today's dilemma is a draft treaty between Latvia and Russia. 
Succeeding in signing a favorable and necessary treaty for 
Latvia, we can prove that in the international arena we support 
the most significant post-war achievements: international 
cooperation and integration. The significance of this event puts 
forward the requirement to coordinate the adoption of national 
political decisions with the still changeable situation in 
international security. 
  In this context I would like to recall that the working 
principle of a team operates on both national and international 
levels. At the moment we are getting involved in the teams that 
are favorable for us. Such a team has evolved in the framework 
of the Baltic cooperation, and such a team is evolving in the 
whole European process. However, a national consensus, or a 
national unanimity, has not developed in Latvia, and there is 
substantial political fragmentation when it comes to making 
crucial decisions. 
  It would be possible to believe that Latvia is too small to 
influence events that constitute this planet's political life. 
In reality, however, for the first time in our country's 
history the opportunity has arisen for Latvia to contribute to 
European and global security and stability. That is exactly why 
the world pays such serious attention to the treaties and why 
there is such exceptionally serious cooperation among the 
world's great powers. 
  What would this contribution be like? First, if our process 
of reform is successful, it will become significant for European 
security in general, because the economy and security policy 
overlap to a greater and greater extent. In ensuring long-term 
stability, integration of economic nature is dominating, 
undoubtedly dominating, over traditional security structures. 
So, for example, while European countries are still giving 
priority to NATO as a security organization, in the future this 
priority will probably be directed toward the structures of the 
European Union and the Western European Union, in which one can 
see a greater long-term potential. 
  A cooperation agreement which is being drafted between 
Latvia 
and the European Union and the possible status of being an 
associate member in the Western European Union should be 
considered as the expression of Europe's confidence in Latvia, 
which requires adequate steps in response. 
  Our foreign policy should conform to the changeable 
international situation. However, a long-term vision is needed, 
a vision that will give insight into the degree of ability 
needed to respond adequately to the most diverse situations. 
Only our system of values in foreign policy, which is currently 
evolving, will ensure that we will not find ourselves in the 
dark and clouded part of the European security zone. We should 
agree even now on resources that have to be dedicated to support 
such a concept, namely, to ensure the full integration of 
diplomatic, economic, and military ability in the future. 
  Although we can consider our values and the intuitive logic 
of our position self-explanatory, we should not isolate 
ourselves from other views. A draft pact on the army withdrawal 
from Latvia and a compromise on the issue of the Skrunda 
early-warning radar system are evidence of the fact that the 
system of our values is European, because talks always follow 
weapons. If there are no talks, weapons start talking again. 
The signing of a pact on the withdrawal of the Russian Army 
from Latvia is the only real guarantee for the withdrawal of the 
Russian Army from Latvia by 31 August, the only real guarantee 
for ensuring the opportunity for international control over this 
process, the only real guarantee to immediately begin the 
dismantling of the most dangerous part of the facility, i.e. the 
new Skrunda facility which, as long as it exists, if it is not 
dismantled, will always be a temptation. 
  The presence of the Skrunda facility on Latvian territory 
without an agreement determining a fixed deadline means 
uncontrolled functioning of this facility in Latvia 
indefinitely. The control of compliance with the agreement 
(?by) the trilateral commission, which also includes CSCE 
representatives, is an additional guarantee, in the same way 
that our participation in the Partnership for Peace program is 
an additional guarantee. The agreement will promote the 
opportunity for Latvia to cooperate with Western systems of 
collective security, and the president's visit to European 
countries is additional evidence. At the same time, it will 
prove that Latvia is a politically mature country able to carry 
out a policy of compromises in the interests of the 
international community, which in the end, are also Latvia's 
interests. 
  In the agreement, in addition to payment for the presence of 
the Skrunda radar station in Latvia, the Russian side also 
undertakes to compensate for damage done to the environment, if 
such is established. And it should be said again that European 
countries will actively support this compensation. 
  During his recent visit to Western Europe, the Latvian 
president received international support for setting up a 
special fund to eliminate ecological consequences of the Skrunda 
radar station and for dismantling the radar. Moreover, at 1100 
today the government set up a special commission to create a 
special fund for the repatriation of discharged military 
personnel, to which funds from Western countries will be given. 
  The treaty on social protection for Russian military 
pensioners and their families does not provide for the status of 
these people in the Republic of Latvia. It will be set by 
legislation in the Republic of Latvia, and aspirations for 
citizenship are completely ruled out. 
  Of course, the treaties include certain compromises and must 
be regarded together. Nevertheless, causes should not be 
confused with consequences and the main task with a secondary 
task. There is no more important task for Latvia than to set a 
deadline for the withdrawal of the Russian Army, thus achieving 
a real withdrawal. 
  Now, thanks to the initialled treaties, Yeltsin's so-called 
error, and the activity of the people, we are acquiring an 
unexpectedly great opportunity not only to rid ourselves of the 
army, but also to free ourselves from the discharged military 
personnel in a civilized manner. We will never have the 
opportunity to involve Western money so actively in the 
promotion of a real, not imaginary, repatriation process. If we 
miss this historic opportunity, we might also lose our state and 
turn into a provincial decaying country in Russia's shadow. I do 
not wish this for Latvia. 
  If no agreement has been signed after 31 August and the 
Russian Army is still in Latvia, the army personnel will all be 
Grinblat's, Sinka's, Kirstein's, and Straume's [right-wing 
parliament deputies] godchildren or godfathers, because they 
will be left here with their blessing which, I assume, is based 
on patriotism and misjudgment of the situation. 
  It would be very easy for me to joint the critics of the 
treaty, and I would do so if I did not see all of the 
interconnections of the process. I ask you and myself: Why do 
the Latvian and Russian oppositions' opinions on the treaties 
coincide? Why are apparently diametrically opposed forces 
working as a unified front to stop the signing of the treaty? I 
can clearly see the development of the situation both if the 
treaty is signed or if it is not. It is important not to be 
manipulated and not to allow others to be manipulated. It is 
important to assess our historic prospects and to act 
cool-headedly. Through correct action we should also attest 
that the basic idea of the new world order is that this order is 
created through talks, and that large and small countries can 
become equal partners through talks, if they have allies. 
  We have to define the critical and global factors that can 
influence our country in the middle of the 1990's and in the 
21st Century. What is the final aim of our foreign policy, the 
ability to guarantee, our ability to respond to future events 
that might threaten national interests? These threats, whether 
local or international, include demographics, social unrests, a 
conflict over minority rights, peacekeeping operations begun 
with a unilateral decision or for strengthening one's own 
security in other countries, political fragmentation, and 
economic decline. It should be clearly realized that real 
foreign policy cannot be based on several models simultaneously. 
Therefore, security policy, at least at the level of conceptual 
points, has to be above quarrels between political parties. 
However, discussions about foreign policy and security are 
unfortunately used to increase capital for internal policy. 
  What are the dimensions of Latvian foreign policy? We are 
striving for a new regionalism. In a more general sense this 
policy has already been crowned with Baltic cooperation in the 
framework of European integration and has marked a new element 
in the European architecture--five plus three, which is to be 
understood as the beginning of cooperation between the Nordic 
countries and the three Baltic states in the context of the 
enlarged European Union. The second element, the second circle, 
is the Union of the Baltic Sea countries, which as a regional 
organization outlines the Baltic region of northeastern Europe. 
  As for the second dimension, we want to continue placing 
increasing emphasis on the network of interrelated institutes in 
Europe. However, we must think not only about what we hope to 
receive from those institutions, but also about what we give to 
them. Not long ago Latvia's movement toward the European 
Community was a moving away from the former USSR, rather than an 
approaching of Europe. With relations between Latvia and the 
European Union developing, our security policy in the European 
dimension has acquired the greatest significance. The status of 
member state in the European Union, toward which we are going, 
gives us security dividends which could prove to be decisive in 
a critical situation. Each step closer to the European Union in 
the economic sphere increases Latvian security. As early as the 
middle of this year, a free trade agreement with the European 
Union will apparently be concluded at an accelerated pace, which 
will become effective on 1 January 1995. That is not the price 
for the feeling of security: Economically, Latvia has no 
alternative. Of course, Latvia can direct its attention without 
great effort toward the wide Russian market or the markets of 
other CIS states. However, predicting future Latvian 
development, I am convinced that such an orientation will 
maintain the technical backwardness of Latvian industry. 
Moreover, we will needlessly put ourselves at risk because of 
that disordered and unpredictable market. This does not mean 
that we should reject a promising market. However, it is better 
to open it up with the European Union, rather than compete 
against it. 
  The European Union is our way and hope for the future. The 
free- trade regime will not apply to agricultural products. 
However, the transitional period is planned to last four years, 
during which we should agree on the principle of protection for 
the asymmetrical internal market. It is important for our 
farming and agriculture, quickly restructuring themselves, to be 
able not only to survive but to flourish. 
  The European Union plans to strengthen political dialogue 
with the Baltic states; after that, there will be preconditions 
which have to be met to secure the status of associate member. 
The strengthened political dialogue has already begun, and now 
you will see the results of this political dialogue. However, 
if we act incorrectly this political dialogue may die down. By 
granting the Baltic states the status of associate members, the 
European Union will clearly define the boundaries of its 
political interests, and that will definitely allow us to 
neutralize Russia's implementation of its concept of the near 
abroad in Latvia. In essence, defining our policy is defining 
where the West European border will be: in Zilupe [town in 
eastern Latvia on border with Russia] or on this shore of the 
Baltic Sea. This moment is a part of these days and these 
weeks. Each step we take now will either bring us closer to our 
goal or bar us from that goal for a long time, if not forever. 
  We have an opportunity to participate actively in the 
Western 
European Union, which is an organization like the military union 
of the European Union [as heard], which is practically the 
European pillar of NATO. I obtained arguments and evidence 
during my visit to the Western European Union and during the 
talks with the secretary general. But it is clear that it will 
be the Western European Union that will play the decisive role 
in the common defense policy of the European Union. A possibly 
higher level of participation for Latvia will allow us to work 
on the shaping of this policy from its origins. That is also 
the way we can come closer to NATO. 
  Latvian policy in relation to NATO is directed toward the 
status of a full-member state, toward the most serious security 
guarantees that Latvia can possibly get. There is very much to 
be done because we cannot be only security consumers. Changes 
in the international situation have changed the NATO philosophy. 
Therefore, the Partnership for Peace program has evolved, in 
which we can gradually develop, and we have begun to develop, an 
individual dialogue with the NATO alliance, corresponding to the 
possibilities and wishes of our country. 
  Partnership for Peace is one of those threads that has to be 
woven into the fabric of Latvian security. The government's aim 
in this economically difficult time is to find a balanced 
distribution of funds for tackling the many problems of the 
Latvian state. We have to understand, to analyze, and to be 
convinced how much we will pay for our security now and 
tomorrow. But we can talk about this only if this state, our 
state, exists. 
  The Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe is 
another element in the architecture of European security, in 
which professionals in diplomacy are actively working and which 
has already been involved in bringing order into Latvian-Russian 
relations. CSCE representatives will take part in the 
supervision of the agreement on the temporary functioning of the 
Skrunda radar station and the implementation of social 
protection for discharged military personnel. To be truthful, a 
whole range of foreign representatives is already here to ensure 
compliance with the treaty if it is signed. 
  The European stability pact, or Balladur plan, opens up new 
opportunities. Weekly and monthly we see it quickly become part 
of the common foreign policy of the European Union. Latvia has 
undertaken to become aware of the most essential problems of 
this pact. In the nearest future a large delegation will be 
here. My visit to France is also scheduled before the 
inauguration ceremony, at which that process will be launched. 
The inaugural conference of the pact is scheduled for the 
second half of May and presents a great opportunity for us in 
the interests of our security. Twelve countries of the European 
Union and nine countries to which this initiative directly 
applies, that is, the three Baltic states and Eastern and 
Central European countries, will take part. 
  In any event, Latvia considers that, apart from the 
consolidation of borders and the tackling of problems concerning 
minorities, round-table talks which are envisaged in the 
framework of the Balladur pact have to be given a wider horizon. 
Economic and social aspects of security and stability are also 
important here. But there is one very significant "if": if 
talks and decisions that will be passed, or are being passed, 
are worked out according to basic UN, CSCE, and European Union 
principles, namely that borders cannot be changed by force and 
that they should be regarded inviolable. These issues should be 
discussed in the same way as other issues, like minorities' 
issues: considering the occupation of the Republic of Latvia, 
and legal and political aspects of the annexion which followed 
it, as a starting point. 
  We are also looking at security cooperation through 
bilateral 
agreements, several of which have recently been concluded. They 
are the threads based on common interests that connect us to 
individual countries. So, first Estonia and Lithuania. The 
road to Europe serves as the catalyst for Baltic cooperation. 
In their movement toward Europe, the Baltic states more and 
more clearly realize and more and more successfully implement 
this cooperation. Criticism that we do not coordinate our 
standpoint with Estonia is completely groundless. Tomorrow 
evening [15 April], I am meeting again with Estonian Premier 
Mart Laar. After each significant international or other 
incident the first talks we hold are between us and also with 
our nearest neighbor Bildt [as heard]. 
  It is extremely necessary to coordinate among ourselves the 
participation of the Baltic states in new worldwide security 
processes, including the Partnership for Peace program and the 
stability pact, defining the status of participation in the 
Western European Union. The world community and international 
organizations have recognized the successful cooperation between 
the Baltic states, as well as the work we are doing to create 
the peacekeeping force battalion that will be preparation for 
participation in UN and other organizations' peacekeeping 
operations. I received more assurances just recently when I 
visited the United Nations. I should tell you, to calm you, 
that this does not mean that our boys will be immediately thrown 
into the hottest spots; this is the responsibility of the state, 
and there should be an agreement about where they are sent. In 
any event, the Nordic countries have begun their training. 
Yesterday I received assurances from and saw concrete steps 
taken by the Swedish commander in chief, who was on a visit to 
Latvia. 
  We are united with Scandinavia in the sphere of regional 
security by common interests, with an understanding of the 
independence of the Baltic states, and their significance in the 
security building of all of Europe. Scandinavian countries are 
actively implementing the so-called program for the support of 
sovereignty, which helps to ensure domestic order and stability 
in the Baltic states. 
  After Polish President Lech Walesa's visit, a new stage 
began 
in Latvia in Latvian-Polish relations. Latvia, Poland, and the 
other so-called Visegrad countries have common aims in coming 
closer to both European structures and NATO. 
  We have very highly commended Germany's and France's 
positive 
role in the development of the European Union. Germany, as a 
neighbor which is one of the great powers of the European Union 
and which is geographically closest to Latvia, has given us 
essential assistance, supporting our accelerated movement toward 
Europe. 
  I do not think a U-turn will appear in our relations if the 
treaty is not signed. The situation can, of course, be assessed 
in different ways, but all indications, direct and indirect, 
which are coming from the most diverse sources of information, 
are evidence that the decisive thing in our future relations not 
only with our neighbors but also with the partners of our 
longer-term orientation in Europe and the world is extremely 
dependent on our action at this time. 
  The first task for us all, when developing foreign and 
security policies of our state, is the following: We as a 
nation should be united on very significant matters. Therefore, 
national accord and political will to preserve a long-term 
adherence to the chosen strategy instead of jumping from one 
extreme to another are significant elements in our development. 
The national accord in the Czech Republic is the basis for its 
being the fastest developing country among all the Eastern 
European countries. 
  Speaking of our strategy, we should clearly define our 
nation's interests: the preservation of the Republic of Latvia 
as a free and independent country, in which democratic values 
are respected, a free market economy is being developed, and the 
protection of human rights is guaranteed; the economic 
development of the Republic of Latvia, which provides for the 
opportunity for individual well-being; and sound and cooperative 
relations with neighboring countries. Regardless of how the 
world order, the building of the world, changes, these interests 
and aims should remain for us unchanged. 
  However, political and ideological threats to national 
security stem not only from our international actions, but also 
from our internal situation. Organizations and groups which are 
against the state, which do not support the independence of our 
country, and whose aims are opposite to those of our country 
continue to be active in Latvia. One does not need to go far to 
find obvious examples. [Word indistinct] they manifested 
themselves in October 1993 during the Moscow putsch. 
  We are all worried about our country's future and our own. 
Our future and the stage of security are always dependent upon 
not only how we understand the situation, but on what we do. 
Individual insecurity of people and the feeling of being 
endangered also influence the country's political stability and 
public safety. I could mention many dangers to the state, and 
the discharged military personnel are considered to be a source 
of danger. At the moment the headquarters of the Northwestern 
Group of Forces pays pensions to 22,000 people. Their family 
members and children also live in Latvia, totaling approximately 
100,000 people, or three percent of the Latvian population. 
Many of them are active in the Association for the Protection 
of Veterans' Rights. 
  I think that if these Russian Army pensioners really want to 
prove that they are loyal to Latvia, they should publicly admit 
the fact that Latvia was occupied. This is absolutely logical. 
It does not matter how long they have lived in this country or 
how long they hope to live. They should be loyal to this 
country and publicly admit unpleasant historical facts--the 
occupation of Latvia. Only then can we talk about other things. 
I think there is a possibility of their being used for various 
kinds of domestic destabilization. However, we should not create 
the image of an enemy. The problem of the military can and 
should be tackled in a civilized manner. 
  I have already said that we have the most favorable 
conditions to tackle this problem and to move forward 
considerably on this issue that is very painful and sensitive, 
not only for Latvia but also for Russia, because these are 
Russia's interests that are being implemented here through the 
military. 
  The aspects of internal policy can be analyzed from other 
angles--from the angle of the crime-related processes, in spite 
of the figures that show that crime is decreasing. However, 
there is a specific explanation for this, if viewed from the 
economic aspects which showed themselves very clearly at the 
time the concluding of agreements between Latvia and Russia 
entered the decisive stage. Indicators in March concerning west 
to east and east to west transit through Latvia increased 
dramatically, though at the moment they have died down 
dramatically. 
  Of course, internal security is also dependent on the level 
of social security and on a range of other factors which would 
have to be analyzed separately. 
  At the end I would like to say that we have to tackle our 
security problems, as I have said on many occasions, weaving 
thread by thread our security fabric, not simply in one move 
acquiring a ready-made bullet-proof vest. On his visit here, 
Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt also said that it would be 
ideal if from zero in security we would immediately get 100 
percent, but that is impossible. Cooperation in both foreign 
policy and military spheres with NATO, the European Union, the 
Western European Union, the CSCE, and bilateral cooperation with 
countries that are also interested in tackling issues of vital 
importance for us should be considered as such threads. In 
reality we also have to weave this thread in Latvia, in our 
everyday life -- in economic, social, and all the rest. 
  At the beginning of this discussion I already noted Latvia's 
specific feature, namely the fact that our foreign and domestic 
security are unusually closely related. Speaking of that, I 
thought that our society swayed as if it were on scales of 
balance. The slightest touch, each initiative in foreign 
policy, results in a very perceptible reaction on the inside, 
destroying the state of equilibrium of the balance. Why are we 
so sensitive in Latvia? What are the causes of tension in 
domestic policy? Of course, they are the poor state of 
pensioners, the bill on citizenship, the issue concerning the 
military, and the signing of the Latvian-Russian Treaty. It is 
very well understandable that the Latvian people are very 
worried about treaties. There is then, the historical damage, 
there is then the analogy with 1939, but it is forgotten here 
that the documents signed in 1939 began this process. These 
documents [the present draft treaty] will bring an end to the 
process that began in 1939. 
  Discussing today the signing of the treaty and creating a 
crises, we are unavoidably increasing Russian influence on the 
environment of our domestic security, which is evidence that one 
end of the thread in our security fabric is in Russian hands. 
We are staging rallies in connection with the signing of the 
Russian-Latvian Treaty. However, nobody rallies against 
Russia's pretensions in connection with the recent Yeltsin 
order. Therefore, opinions that direct the development of 
domestic policy from the state of equilibrium are in fact 
threatening the existence of our country. Our public with its 
sensitiveness in its turn, lead to perceptible enough attitude 
of Western countries. However, internally unstable countries 
cannot be and will not become equivalent participants in 
European institutions and processes. Agreements are the basis 
of relations with both East and West. However, they are not a 
guarantee. The guarantee is participation in processes. I 
would like to recall that if we act recklessly we will become a 
dispensable part of these processes. If we want to get involved 
in international relations, then our domestic policy problems 
have to be tackled according to the European system of values. 
  These relations open up the opportunity to tackle any 
conflict or threat on an international level. The 14th Clause 
of the Partnership for Peace program also provides for support 
and consultations in the event of a crises or threat to 
sovereignty and territorial integrity. As a member state of the 
CSCE, we brought the Yeltsin order, known to everybody, to the 
international arena, and made it known to the presiding country 
with a request to include it for discussion on the agenda of the 
Vienna group. 
  Only moving, weaving the fabric, we will be able to use each 
step that is directed against Latvia to strengthen our position 
in Europe and in the world. Our foreign policy initiatives have 
to find international support. Then we will strengthen our 
position in the new world order, then we will preserve our 
national interests in this changeable world, then we will ensure 
Latvia as an independent state in the future. 
  Forty-five minutes. Thank you.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: compiled by </F>
Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy; edited by Vladimir 
Shishlin] 
  [Text] The planned summit of the Council of the heads of 
CIS member-states was held on Friday in Moscow. Leaders of all 
CIS member-countries attended the sitting with the exception of 
Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev who was not able to come 
to Moscow due to his illness. Kazakhstan's Vice President Erik 
Asanbayev represented the republic at the summit. Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin addressed the plenary sitting of the 
Council of the Heads of States and Council of the Heads of CIS 
Governments. The whole text of his speech is presented below. 
  "First of all, let me congratulate the Republic of Moldova 
on 
joining the Commonwealth of Independent States. The 
corresponding documents have been signed just before the 
beginning of this sitting. I also want to congratulate Chairman 
of Belarus' Supreme Soviet Mechyslaw Ivanovich Hryb on his first 
participation in the sitting of the Council of the heads of CIS 
states. 
  Today we are due to discuss a wide spectrum of issues. What 
primarily concerns us is a package of decisions aimed at the 
practical implementation of the treaty on economic union. 
Economic union is the basis of the Commonwealth. The level of 
integration of CIS countries in general will finally depend upon 
our advances in this direction. 
  Today the sitting of the heads of states has approved two 
decisions of principal significance. The first one concerns the 
creation of a commission for the economic union. It should 
become a working instrument to ensure the efficient activity of 
the economic union of the Commonwealth's countries. 
  Another decision gives "a green light" to the creation of a 
free trade zone. In accordance with this decision all customs 
tariffs, taxes, and non-tariff restrictions in mutual trade 
between CIS countries will be gradually abolished. Thanks to 
this we shall prepare the ground for a stage-by-stage transfer 
to the customs union. 
  These moves are not the conclusion but the beginning of 
economic integration. We must think over how to prevent a dual 
threat--an uncontrolled industrial recession, on the one hand, 
and hyperinflation, on the other. Today we have great 
opportunities for this. 
  We have also given our backing to Ukraine's joining the 
economic union as an associate member. I believe that given 
Ukraine's economic potential this decision will be of great 
importance both for this republic and for other members of the 
economic union. 
  I'd like to specially mention the documents on the 
unification of Russia's and Belarus' monetary systems signed 
several days ago. For the first time integration has risen to a 
qualitatively new level in the framework of the Commonwealth. I 
think that this way is acceptable not only for 
Russian-Belarusian relations but for relations between other 
states of the Commonwealth as well. If they demonstrate their 
readiness then we shall find appropriate practical solutions. 
  To speak about Russia and Belarus, I'd like to stress that 
we 
act in strict correspondence with the will of our peoples aimed 
at a maximum closening of our states. 
  We are ready to transfer to a combination of various forms 
of 
integration. Russia is ready to determine legal dimensions of 
mutual relations with those who are interested in closer 
interaction. It will cooperate on another basis with those who 
adhere to another position. 
  We put forward one major provision--any agreement should be 
fulfilled. Russia is ready to make certain concessions minding 
the pressing interests of our partners. However, any 
concessions should be mutual. Otherwise, we shall not be able 
to gain a mutually beneficial cooperations. 
  Strengthening of economic union necessitates a close 
interaction in other spheres as well. 
  First of all we must care about a reliable guarding of the 
Commonwealth's external borders, strengthening of stability 
inside our countries and their defense from any outside threat. 
In addition, any economic community inevitably has common 
interests in the foreign economic sphere too. 
  The Council of the heads of states discussed these issues 
and 
came to a common point of view. 
  The head of states have confirmed a new provision on the 
Council of Defense Ministers. It takes into consideration 
structural changes which happened over the last time in the 
field of military cooperation. The Council heard the 
information of the Chairman of the CIS frontier forces 
commanders on the state of cooperation in the sphere of CIS 
external borders' guarding. We have reached principal 
agreements on this issue. The parties have signed a memorandum 
on the participation of the Commonwealth's states in the 
guarding of the external border in the Central-Asian region. 
  When we understood that there are certain threats to the 
Commonwealth's security in the Caucuses, we reached agreements 
with the Republic of Georgia and Republic of Armenia on Russia's 
participation in the guarding of their external borders. While 
discussing this issue, we expressed the hope that Azerbaijan 
would join our joint efforts aimed at guarding the 
Commonwealth's external border. 
  The memorandum on join measures providing for guarding 
external borders of CIS states with Ukraine and Belarus is also 
of great importance. The documents is ready for signing. 
[sentence as received] 
  We are also ready to cooperate with Moldova on this issue. 
  We have discussed such acute problems as the settlement of 
the Karabakh and Georgian-Abkhazian conflict and adopted 
documents of political nature in order to give a serious impetus 
to the settlement process. Today the heads of CIS states also 
paid attention to the situation in Tajikistan. The sitting 
passed a resolution to conclude the development of a constituent 
agreement and charter of the Aid Fund to the republic of 
Tajikistan, this decision expresses our common support to the 
inter-Tajik political dialogue. 
  Simultaneously the heads of states agreed to the proposals 
prepared by the Foreign and Defense Ministers on additional 
measures aimed at the stabilization of the situation on the 
Tajik-Afghan border. The term of the collective peacekeeping 
forces' staying in Tajikistan has been prolonged till the end of 
1994. 
  In response to Kyrgyzstan's address the Council of the heads 
of states also passed a decision to render assistance to this 
country which seriously suffered from natural disasters early 
this year. 
  On the whole we think that we have reached a new stage in 
the 
development of the Commonwealth. The integration strives of CIS 
states start to be implemented by practical deeds. Russia will 
not oppose the creation of inter-state structures, however, we 
need to precisely determine their prerogatives. 
  The Commonwealth is getting stronger and stronger as an 
efficient regional association of states which is interested in 
a close cooperation with the UN, CSCE, and other international 
organizations. Currently we see the need to coordinate our 
foreign policy as well. The Commonwealth is able to actively 
collaborate with our partners in the West, in the South, and in 
the East. The main thing is to actively defend joint interests 
of the Commonwealth and to participate in global and regional 
political problems. 
  This is the way along which we should go forward in the 
interests of the peoples of our countries, in the interests of 
the Commonwealth as a whole. 
  Paraphrasing the old saying, we say now the following: "Let 
us take as much cooperation as meets the interest of each of our 
states." 
  On the eve of the summit the majority of the leaders 
stressed 
the priority of the economic block of the agenda which includes 
15 issues (sees Presidential Bulletin No 72). According to many 
heads of the states, in particular, Eduard Shevardnadze 
(Georgia), Askar Akayev (Kyrgyzstan), Mircea Snegur (Moldova), 
Emomali Rakhmonov (Tajikistan), the Inter-state Economic 
Committee of the Economic Union of CIS countries can play a 
special role in the strengthening of the integration processes. 
  On the conclusion of the meeting the head of the Belarussian 
government Vyacheslav Kebich expressed dissatisfaction with the 
fact that instead of signing documents on the creation of an 
inter-state economic committee in charge of coordination of 
economic work of CIS countries and adoption of decisions in this 
sphere, the summit has created "an amorphous" body under the 
coordinating-consultative committee-commission of the economic 
union which has purely consultative functions. 
  Kebich believes that under the absence of the inter-state 
economic committee CIS economic union "has not worked and will 
not work."

<F P=106> [News conference by CIS heads of state following CIS summit </F>
in Moscow on 15 April; from the Mir TV and Radio Company "On the 
Air" Program -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Russian President Boris Yeltsin] Esteemed 
journalists, ladies and gentlemen, we are starting the news 
conference with the CIS heads of state after the meeting of the 
Council of Heads of Government and the Council of Heads of State. 
  The latest meeting has just ended. I would like to express 
satisfaction with its results. The meeting took place in a 
businesslike and constructive atmosphere. It was characterized 
by a high level of mutual understanding. The participants in 
the meeting congratulated Moldova whose parliament has ratified 
the Commonwealth's constituent documents. I am pleased that 
Moldova has become a full member of the Commonwealth. 
  The meetings which have taken place over the past few days 
in 
Moscow have shown that our Commonwealth is to a very high degree 
a reality, that, in spite of the difficulties of establishing 
the Commonwealth, we are moving forward along the path of 
developing and deepening processes of integration based on new 
democratic principles and that the Commonwealth is vitally 
necessary to our peoples and states. And, finally, it is 
becoming more clear than ever before that the CIS is not simply 
one area of policy but its natural priority, including the 
natural priority of Russia's policy, dictated by the interests 
and requirements of the member countries and also by our common 
interests as we face the world. 
  The meeting of the heads of state examined 26 important 
issues, concerning cooperation in the military, foreign policy 
and economic spheres and in protecting the CIS's external 
borders. It decided to continue collective measures within the 
framework of the CIS to stabilize the situation along the 
Tajikistan-Afghanistan border. In particular, the presence of 
collective peacekeeping forces in Tajikistan has been extended 
up to the end of the year. 
  The heads of state decided to render urgent and additional 
aid to Kirgizia [Kyrgyzstan] following the natural disasters 
suffered by that country. The heads of state were unanimous on 
the issue of CIS flashpoints, in that they must be extinguished. 
They adopted statements intended to expedite a settlement to 
the Karabakh and Georgia-Abkhazia conflicts. 
  At today's meeting, a memorandum on cooperation to protect 
the state borders of the Republic of Belarus, the Russian 
Federation, and Ukraine was agreed and signed. 
  Our states now have a basis for a constant interaction in 
this most important sphere. We would also welcome Moldova's 
signing of this memorandum. One of the significant results of 
this meeting is that decisions on launching the machinery of our 
economic union have been taken. I would like to note that 
Ukraine joined it as an associate member at this meeting. The 
decisions envisage a free trade zone being set up in the CIS; a 
commission of the economic union is being formed as a standing 
structure of the economic union. 
  Several agreements on economic cooperation were signed by 
the 
heads state. The agreement on the setting up of a free trade 
zone involves a gradual lifting of custom duties and taxes and 
tariff restrictions in the trade between the member countries. I 
think at the present stage we shall concentrate our main efforts 
on this aspect. This will ensure a closer interconnection of our 
economic systems on the market foundation. 
  On the whole, we look with considerable optimism at the CIS 
development prospects. The citizens of Russia are thankful to 
the heads of state for their decision that Russia should hold 
the chairmanship not for six months as was agreed before but 
until the end of 1994. It was decided that the next sitting of 
the Council of Heads of State should be held on 9 September. 
  Now I give the floor to Executive Secretary, Ivan 
Mikhaylovich Korotchenya. 
  [Korotchenya] Boris Nikolayevich, you have so adequately, 
so broadly covered the progress of our work that there is no 
need for me to add to your account, and I should think that we 
might switch over to answering questions. Go ahead. 
  [Yeltsin] Maybe we ought to list what we've signed. 
  [Korotchenya] Yes, let's list them. 
  [Yeltsin] Shall we? 
  [Korotchenya] Yes. 
  [Yeltsin] Let's list them. After all, it's very important, 
you understand, not only to Russia and the CIS countries, but 
also to the whole world. Go ahead. 
  [Korotchenya, reading from paper] Questions relating to the 
implementation of the treaty creating an economic union. There 
were three of them: on Ukraine's joining the economic union as 
an associate member -- which has been mentioned; on the creation 
of a permanent body under the Commonwealth's coordinating 
consultative committee; and on the creation of free-trade areas. 
  On the constituent treaty creating a relief fund for the 
Republic of Tajikistan. These are questions which stem from 
instructions from the Council of Heads of State. On measures to 
ensure the relations of the Commonwealth of Independent States 
and its statutory bodies with international organizations and 
forums. Six -- a statute on the CIS states' Defense Ministers' 
Council. On additional measures to stabilize the situation on 
the Tajik-Afghan border. 
  The third group of questions -- questions of relations at 
the 
initiative of the Commonwealth's state statutory bodies: on 
cooperation in the field of the [word indistinct] preparation of 
the economy; on the duration of the presence of the collective 
peacekeeping forces in the Republic of Tajikistan; on the 
commander of the collective peacekeeping forces. 
  Information on the progress of talks was received by the 
Russian Federation from the Central Asian and Transcaucasian 
states on cooperation to protect the borders by third countries, 
and on the implementation of the memorandum of the heads of the 
Commonwealth states, dated 24 December 1993, on cooperation over 
protecting the external state borders. A declaration on 
observing the sovereignty and territorial integrity and 
inviolability of the borders of the CIS states. 
  There were several questions in the category of other 
business: on providing additional urgent assistance to the 
Kyrgyz Republic. On the flag and emblem of the Commonwealth of 
Independent States. 
  [Yeltsin] Show it to them. 
  [Korotchenya] I'll show it to you. [Unfolds flag and 
displays 
it] 
  On the chairmanship of the Commonwealth's statutory bodies. 
On the conclusion of agreements on the conditions for the stay 
of the executive secretariat of the Commonwealth of Independent 
States on the territory of the Republic of Belarus; and on the 
preparation of proposals for amendments to the basic document of 
the Commonwealth of Independent States. The question is 
somewhat broader, bearing in mind a proposal from Boris 
Nikolayevich. 
  This is a package of issues which was discussed by the 
heads of state. The heads of government discussed 22 issues. Is 
it necessary to announce them? No? Therefore, the third 
microphone. 
  [Grishchenko] Thank you. Grishchenko, INTERFAX. They say 
that 
in the framework of this summit Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin was 
going to have meetings with presidents of some CIS states. Have 
such meetings taken place, Boris Nikolayevich? If so, what was 
under discussion there? Thank you. 
  [Yeltsin] Yes, meetings did take place with those who asked 
for them. With a delegation and, accordingly, with the president 
of the Republic of Moldova, Mircea Ionovich Snegur. Then with 
the president of Azerbaijan, Heydar Aliyevich Aliyev. With 
Armenian president Levon Akopovich Ter-Petrosyan. And after the 
interval there will be a meeting between two delegations from 
Russia and Ukraine. 
  [Korotchenya] Microphone number four, please. 
  [Lenskiy] Lenskiy of the newspaper PRAVDA. Esteemed Boris 
Nikolayevich, what is your attitude in principle to Nursultan 
Nazarbayev's idea of setting up a Eurasian Union? Was this 
question discussed at the meeting of heads of state? 
  [Yeltsin] As Nursultan Abishevich Nazarbayev was, 
unfortunately, taken ill and as, therefore, we were unable to 
receive from him exhaustive information on this question, this 
question was not discussed. 
  [Korotchenya] Microphone number two. 
  [Semenov] Yuliy Semenov of Mayak Radio. You know that 
journalists are no more than intermediaries between you and the 
readers, listeners and viewers. People listen to you and watch 
you and many people will wonder: What will ordinary people, the 
inhabitants of any state of the Commonwealth, gain from your 
meeting today. Which of the presidents would like to answer 
this question? I beg your pardon. 
  [Yeltsin] I would be happy to reply but perhaps there are 
various opinions. Would you like to say something, Mircea? 
  [Snegur] I think that any of us could reply. Well, first of 
all, the signing of the agreement on the creation of a free 
economic zone shows the intentions and the ways to restore a 
single economic space which we so lack at the moment, that is, 
the removal of barriers obstructing the movement of output from 
East to West, West to East, North to South and so on. This 
obstructs everyone; it obstructs state enterprises, it obstructs 
the privatized enterprises, it obstructs private traders who 
also produce products one way or another. And at present a very 
great amount of output has piled up, seemingly, in all 
countries, in all enterprises which, because of these barriers 
practically have no outlet. I think that this is a matter of 
some importance for ordinary people. Because it provides the 
opportunity to earn some money. It provides the opportunity to 
have funds, to have money for the labor people have already put 
in. And I think that this is the most important, perhaps the 
most important thing in the economic documents which were signed 
today. That is how I see it. 
  [Yeltsin] Does anyone want to add anything? 
  [Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev] Can I add a few words? 
  [Yeltsin] Please, do. 
  [Akayev] I would like to say that ordinary people are 
particularly concerned that over the past years we might have 
lost our feeling of solidarity. A shining example is being set 
to the people, the ordinary people of Kyrgyzstan, who this 
spring suffered such catastrophe due to unprecedented natural 
disasters, landslips and spring flooding. And the decision by 
the heads of state, the special decision to show solidarity and 
help all the ordinary people of Kyrgyzstan who have lost their 
houses and homes, whom we've been forced to resettle, I think, 
shows that our commonwealth is becoming stronger and continuing 
its good traditions of solidarity of jointly solving such issues 
which arise in emergency situations. Thank you. 
  [Korotchenya] First microphone. 
  [Terekhov] Good afternoon. Terekhov, INTERFAX. Could you 
please say, every time you, esteemed presidents, adopt extremely 
important, almost historical, documents. But they are not being 
implemented because there has not been and there is not a rigid 
mechanism of responsibility for nonfulfillment. Do you intend to 
set up such a rigid mechanism now which will make a country 
responsible for not fulfilling its obligations? 
  And another thing, if I may. A paradoxical situation has 
arisen when two countries, members of the Commonwealth, in fact 
are in a state of war. Do you intend to help the two presidents 
who, although the names of their states begin with the same 
letter, are sitting at the oppositite sides of the room even 
here? Do you have any intention to help them to somewhow finally 
ensure that their peoples will not be fighting any more? 
  [Terekhov] Ivan Mikhaylovich, perhaps you can expand on this 
question? 
  [Korotchenya] Well, there is too much to say. First of all 
... 
  [Yeltsin, interrupting] Well, the same question, please. 
  [Terekhov] To ask the presidents of Russia and Ukraine to be 
more precise: today you are meeting to discuss the situation in 
the Black Sea Fleet. In essence, what happened there was some 
sort of guerrilla tactics or an act of piracy. Please, explain 
your views and positions to us - or rather, to your peoples. We 
would like to know your views on what is happening there. Thank 
you. 
  [Yeltsin] Let us not complicate things now, before the 
meeting, they are complex as they are. We can answer this 
question only after we have met and discussed things among 
ourselves. As regards to Nagornyy Karabakh and the 
Georgian-Abkhazian conflict, we adopted some concrete measures 
in order to make a breakthrough in this situation. 
  In regards to control, we decided to fully re-examine all 
the 
decisions taken by the CIS states from its very first sitting 
and after this the questions of procedure and control over 
implementation of these decisions will be subject to a special 
discussion by heads of the CIS states. And only after this the 
mechanism of, shall we say, enforcing the prompt implementation 
of the adopted decisions will be approved. 
  [Korotchenya] Do we need to add anything to this question? 
No? The fourth microphone, please. 
  [Chernukha] I have a question for the chairman of the 
Supreme Soviet of Tajikistan. Are you satisfied with the 
documents which have been signed today in connection with the 
protection of your state borders? My second question: I 
believe that you are opposed to the idea of creating a Eurasian 
Union; could you explain the reasons for your stance? Thank 
you. Marina Chernukha from Radio Rossii. 
  [Rakhmonov] In reply to the first question, yes. Today among 
the questions which were discussed by the heads of states four 
questions were discussed and signed on Tajikistan. In 
particular, there were questions about strengthening the 
Tajik-Afghan border. But we are going to call it the southern 
border of the CIS. It is not only the border of Tajikistan. 
  On the second question: I do not know where you got the 
information that I am an overt opponent of Nursultan 
Abishevich's [Nazarbayev] initiative. I, indeed, gave an 
interview in which I said that, yes, the idea is good but the 
CIS has not exhausted its possibilities and reserves. And we 
confirmed this today by putting our signatures to the documents 
which were adopted here today. 
  [Korotchenya] Thank you. Microphone number three, please. 
  [Uzbek President Islam Karimov] I would like to say 
something 
on this question. 
  [Korotchenya] Islam Abdughaniyevich, go ahead, please. 
  [Karimov] When the impression is created that one person 
puts 
forward an idea and then it is discussed at all forums and 
people are divided into opponents and supporters, I consider 
that this is not quite correct. Because, although the idea of a 
Eurasian Union has been put forward, it does not have any 
serious foundation. And, therefore, if you ask who is against 
it, we shall reply that we are all in favour. But serious 
thought needs to be given to the question of what lies behind 
it. It needs to be examined and good grounds need to be found 
because, as the experience of the existence of the CIS shows, 
and even the latest initiative, the creation of an economic 
union, which we are all in agreement with and which we are all 
moving towards, in step with one another, we are making great 
efforts and undertaking measures and we have discussed this 
question frequently at meetings of the heads of the states, even 
here, unfortunately, not everything is being resolved and not 
everything is so easy to resolve. 
  Therefore, I consider that it would be incorrect to throw 
aside the idea of strengthening the Commonwealth, primarily via 
economic structures, via economic union, when we have only got 
half-way -- although we all put our signatures to this -- and to 
put forward the new idea of a Eurasian Union. In general, it 
smacks of populism. 
  [Kazakh Vice President Yerik Asanbayev] Esteemed comrades, 
since the idea which Nursultan Abishevich [Nazarbayev] has put 
forward is arousing such great interest I consider it necessary 
to make a few comments. This idea was put forward in response 
to a question which was asked at a meeting held by the President 
of Kazakhstan at Moscow University. 
  We are now studying the reaction of politicians, not only at 
home but also abroad. The main newspapers and the mass media 
are reacting to this. This idea has been more clearly spelled 
out today in today's first edition of SNG-OBSHCHIY RYNOK ["CIS 
-- Common Market"]. We are now preparing its systemic, 
integrated structure and probably it will be presented in this 
form at a meeting of the heads of state. I am saying this 
because this intention was mentioned indirectly at today's 
meeting of the CIS heads of state. 
  Moreover, you know that today there was discussion of the 
question of preparing the concept and specific mechanisms for 
the long-term integrated development of the CIS. I believe that 
this idea, after it has been made more specific will fit into or 
could well fit into, the framework of the instruction which the 
conference of heads of states gave today to the Coordinating 
Committee, to the Foreign and Defense Ministries. 
  Therefore, I think that this an idea which is a logical 
continuation of the process of integrating the CIS countries and 
it has not been produced out of thin air. I agree that this is 
a problem which is far from simple. But it has been dictated by 
life. Thank you. 
  [Korotchenya] Thank you. Microphone number three, please. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Thank you. NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA. 
I have two questions. The first is to Boris Nikolayevich 
Yeltsin and probably also to Eduard Amvrosyevich Shevardnadze. 
How should we understand today's agreement to strengthen the 
role of Russian peacekeeping forces in the Caucasus? Can you 
comment on this and these forces' role in Georgia? What is the 
opinion on this of the Georgian head of state? 
  And the second question is to Leonid Makarovich Kravchuk. 
Ukraine remains the sole member of the CIS that has joined the 
Economic Union as an associate member. Does this entail any 
particular status for Ukraine in the CIS and how do your 
colleagues, Leonid Makarovich, view this status? Thank you. 
  [Yeltsin] We adopted a head of states' declaration on the 
Georgia-Abkhazia conflict. In principle, Russia, in preliminary 
consultations with Eduard Amvrosyevich [Shevardnadze], agreed to 
provide peacekeeping forces which will also include forces or 
observers from the UN and CSCE. 
  [Georgian Head of State Eduard Shevardnadze] I agree with 
what Boris Nikolayevich [Yeltsin] said. Well, journalists have 
an idea of what this means. I'll quote literally two phrases 
from that declaration, which we signed today and which, I think, 
has very considerable significance. 
  It says here: Affirming our commitment to the earliest 
solution to the problem of refugees, observance of human and 
national minority rights, the principle of the territorial 
integrity of the Republic of Georgia and the securing of 
statehood for Abkhazia, the states of the Commonwealth of 
Independent States, signatories to the treaty on collective 
security, call on the Security Council of the United Nations 
Organization to resolve without delay the issue of whether to 
conduct peacekeeping operations in Abkhazia. That is an appeal 
to the Security Council. 
  Also, the Council for Collective Security expresses its 
willingness -- if for whatever reason a solution is not 
forthcoming in the near future, and time for us is a very 
important, the decisive, factor at the moment because hundreds 
of thousands of refugees are suffering, in accordance with the 
spirit and principle of the treaty, which is designed to ensure 
the peaceful and safe development of the signatory states, and 
with the consent of the parties to the conflict -- to introduce 
to the conflict zone peacekeeping forces consisting of military 
units of interested state signatories to the treaty. 
  I think that this is a very balanced and very serious 
approach to a problem that is highly acute not only for our 
republic but also for the entire region. 
  [Korotchenya] 
Thank you. Leonid Makarovich, please. 
  [Ukraine President Leonid Kravchuk] Everyone knows that the 
main trend of economic development within the framework of the 
CIS is integration, economic integration. This is not happening 
just within the framework of the CIS; it is a world-wide trend. 
The peoples and the states support this trend of economic 
integration. 
  The forms of integration could vary. The form adopted by the 
CIS is economic union. At the present stage Ukraine joined the 
economic union as an associated member, but it signs, as it did 
today, all the economic documents without exeption. The question 
is not of integration per se, but whether conditions and 
circumstances under which this integration is taking place are 
equal. 
  In connection with this I should like to return to the 
questions raised here today. You see, the processes taking place 
in the CIS are not all the same. Some countries are getting 
closer together, others prefer to keep at a certain distance 
within this union. For example, the question of merging the 
monetary systems - like Russia and Belarus. This is a deeper 
level of integration than that of the Eurasian Union. If such 
processes go further, the Eurasian Union and the CIS will become 
unnecessary as there will be no need for them, as this is 
already somewhat broader than economic integration. 
  Therefore, in this situation Ukraine is an active and 
enterprising participant in the economic union. 
  [Korotchenya] Thank you. Microphone number two, please. 
  [Melnikova] Anna Melnikova of ITAR-TASS. My first question 
is 
to Boris Nikolayevich. Today you put forward the concept of 
further integration within the framework of the CIS. Could you 
please explain what precisely this will be. Will it be just 
economic integration or will there be some elements of political 
integration? 
  My second question is to all the participants in the 
collective security treaty: Do you plan to discuss joining 
NATO's Partnership for Peace program? Do you have any particular 
views on this? Do you consider it expedient to have some sort of 
common approach on this? Thank you. 
  [Yeltsin] We heard information from the Russian foreign 
minister, who is the chairman of the Council of Ministers of the 
CIS countries. 
  He was instructed, or rather the Council of Ministers was 
instructed, to draw up a long-term plan for further integration 
of CIS states in the political, and economic, and 
military-technical arenas. 
  [Unidentified speaker] Three councils; the defense ministers 
as well. 
  [Yeltsin] They and the defense ministers, yes. The Council 
of 
Defense Ministers. They have so far presented a document that 
is, I would say, rather modest. It consists of 10 headings 
which are not satisfactory and do not reflect our entire 
perspective on integration of CIS countries. 
  Therefore the Council of Heads of State decided to instruct 
the Council of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the CIS and the 
Council of Ministers of Defense of the CIS to draw up a concept 
for further concentration of integration of the Commonwealth 
countries and, before the next meeting, submit it for broad 
discussion by the heads of state. 
  [Korotchenya] First microphone, please. 
  [Yakovlev] The Mir International Television and Radio 
Company, Yakovlev. We have not yet heard today from the 
presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan. Eduard Amvrosiyevich 
[Shevardnadze] touched only on the fact -- only read out what 
was adopted today in the documents concerning those calamities 
that have affected your peoples. The Mir television company has 
been showing what is taking place in these countries and has 
been showing not only actions connected with the fact that 
people are being killed. It has in addition been showing the 
refugees issue. 
  What can you say in respect of a peacekeeping mission and 
what specifically can you say today to those people and those 
ordinary families who are waiting first and foremost for your 
solution and not a solution by some or other foreign forces? 
  [Korotchenya] Geydar Aliyevich, please. 
  [Aliyev] First, I did not have a question. This is why I 
was not answering. In response to the comment by one of the 
correspondents that we are sitting in different places: I do 
not know why we have been put like this. I cannot see any 
particular procedure or principle about where we sit. We do not 
have a say in this. We sit where they tell us. 
  With regards to the conflict -- or war -- between Armenia 
and 
Azerbaijan, I have recently made an important address about 
which the journalists should know. I spoke about this issue 
today at the session of the heads of states. Therefore, I did 
not think it was necessary to talk about it here, especially now 
that a statement has been adopted on this question by the heads 
of states. However, because you are asking, I have to answer. 
Of course, it is not normal when Armenia and Azerbaijan -- two 
states within the CIS -- are at war with each other. This is an 
abnormal phenomenon that has no precedent in the world, I think. 
This does little for the reputation of the Commonwealth. I 
spoke about this at our meeting in Ashkhabad [Ashgabat] on 24 
December and I was speaking about this at the summit today. We 
have discussed it there and, as a result, a statement on this 
question was adopted, as suggested by the CIS chairman, Russian 
President Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin. 
  You have mentioned the problem of refugees. More than 1 
million Azerbaijan citizens are now refugees, living in tents. 
These are not just Azerbaijan refugees driven from 
Nagorno-Karabakh; there are also refugees from seven regions 
surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh -- the regions with a concentrated 
Azerbaijan population -- which are now occupied by Armenian 
armed formations. In these regions everything was destroyed or 
plundered and a million people have fled to other regions of 
Azerbaijan to save their lives. Because we do not have a place 
for them, they live in tents, which we receive as part of 
humanitarian aid from various countries. The Iranian Islamic 
Republic has undertaken to provide 100,000 refugees with tents, 
food, and clothing. The Turkish Government has also pledged 
some help. International Arab and other organizations also help 
us. Of course, all this cannot be normal. I have been saying 
it all the time: This war has no prospects. We should put an 
end to this war. Twenty percent of Azerbaijan territory is 
occupied by Armenian armed formations. One cannot agree with 
this. This is not a way of achieving the goals that certain 
circles are trying to achieve. I made appeals on this matter to 
various heads of state and to Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin. I 
hope that the statement adopted by the heads of state today -- 
which, incidentally, is the first one of its kind in CIS history 
-- might help because it demands that heads of Armenia and 
Azerbaijan declare a cease-fire and cessation of all military 
actions. We are ready to stop hostilities at any time. We are 
suffering from aggression. The war is being waged on the 
territory of Azerbaijan, not Armenia. People are being killed. 
Of course, people are now being killed in this war on the 
Azerbaijani side and on the Armenian side. Over the past five 
days Armenian armed formations have been waging an intensive 
attack. Azerbaijanis are dying and Armenians are dying. This 
cannot be allowed. 
  In any event, we are doing, and will continue to do, 
everything we can to achieve a cease-fire, but the condition for 
this is that Armenian armed formations must leave occupied 
Azerbaijani territory. 
  I hope that this declaration by the CIS heads of state will 
help us resolve the issue. 
  [Korotchenya] Thank you, Geydar Aliyevich. Levon Akopovich, 
do you have something to say? 
  [Ter-Petrosyan] Naturally. Before replying to the specific 
question I must make one clarification because there is a 
mistake in the wording of the question and, by the way, even in 
the way the journalist's question has been worded. Things are 
presented as if there are two states within the CIS that are at 
war with each other. This is not the case. The war is taking 
place between Nagorno-Karabakh and Azerbaijan. 
  More than ten international documents have been adopted 
about 
the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict at the level of the UN Security 
Council, three resolutions, three statements, approximately a 
dozen CSCE documents, and statements by the EC. Not one of 
these documents names Armenia as a party to the conflict. I 
reject this categorically and with full responsibility. That is 
the first thing. 
  Second, specific plans exist for settling the 
Nagorno-Karabakh conflict: the CSCE plan, which was accepted by 
Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh and which was rejected by 
Azerbaijan. There is Russia's plan, which has been accepted, 
again, by Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh and which is rejected by 
Azerbaijan. 
  The CIS today adopted a declaration on this conflict, which 
is a kind of mandate, a mandate, for the Russian plan to resolve 
the conflict. The essence of the plan is the deployment of CIS 
disengagement forces in the conflict zone between Azerbaijani 
and Karabakh forces. 
  The fate of peace, the fate of the refugees, the fate of war 
and peace is in the hands of Azerbaijan. Everything depends on 
the political will of Azerbaijan. Armenia and Karabakh are 
ready, literally before you, now, at this table, to sign the 
agreement that Russia has drawn up. 
  [Korotchenya] Thank you. 
  [Shevardnadze] With your permission, I will give a 
clarification to the question asked. It should be borne in mind 
that within a state there could be conflicts that can be solved 
without outside assistance, as it were. Unfortunately, things 
have taken such a turn that from the very start the Abkhaz 
conflict has acquired an international nature, so to speak. 
This has entailed the necessary steps taken by the Georgian and 
Russian leadership, numerous agreements and accords on 
cease-fire and settlement to the conflict. Regrettably, they 
have failed to succeed, and these agreements have been violated. 
The question has now taken a very fundamental importance. The 
United Nations and the Security Council are constantly working 
on the problem, and Russia's positive mediating role can be seen 
very clearly. In my view, the fundamental statement of our 
Council today to demand once again that peacekeeping forces be 
introduced...[pauses] and if the Security Council fails to take 
an appropriate decision on this issue, then we have to put 
things in order relying on our own forces. I see this as a way 
out of an impasse. This is what I can say. 
  [Korotchenya] Thank you. The news conference is over, but 
there is time for one last question, from microphone three. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Ostankino TV. I would like, 
however, to hear once again from the presidents who took part at 
the roundtable talks today -- I do not know who will speak out. 
What guarantees do they see for today's accords precisely to be 
implemented, what guarantees? Are there any now? Not in some 
vague future but today, are there any guarantees today? Do you 
see them or not? 
  [Yeltsin] You see, the CIS Council of Heads of State is, 
after all, not the same as strict factory management. There are 
no factory director or his deputies where all instructions are 
complied with. Here we hold a council and discussion where a 
collective view is being developed, which is not 
straightforward. It is based on a compromise; it may suit some 
members and not suit others. So we cannot say that every 
decision will be rigorously complied with within strictly 
identified limits; this will not happen. Some decisions will 
be, of course, but other decisions will not. We have simply to 
outline this concord on some decisions, to agree on this 
concord, and then act jointly. 
  I believe that the majority of decisions -- there were 26 of 
them adopted by the Council of Heads of State -- are realistic. 
  But, what is the value of a decision alone about 
Nagorno-Karabakh? What is it worth? How many years has this 
war been going on? To think that the war will end and a 
settlement will be found immediately following our decision and 
discussions would be naive. There is a vast amount of work ahead 
for all of us to achieve a peaceful outcome there. 
  We are confident that we will achieve it jointly with 
Azerbaijan, jointly with Armenia, jointly with Russia, and other 
CIS states. The same is true about the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict. 
In other words, there are such issues that cannot be solved 
right away by simply signing a document. There are other 
issues, however, such as, for instance, the new provision on the 
Council of Defense Ministers, which we have approved. There are 
no problems or questions here at all. A decision has been made, 
and it will be complied with as well as a number of other 
decisions. 
  Thank you for the news conference, and good-bye.

  [Text] The Second Congress of Russian Cinema Workers opened 
in Moscow on Saturday. A message from President Yeltsin to its 
participants stresses that "the unique potential of Russian 
cinema must be preserved at all costs." 
  On Friday, he signed a decree on a protectionist state 
policy 
in the national cinema art. Support for cinema is recognized in 
this document as crucial to the government's cultural 
development plans. The decree obliges the cabinet to set aside 
funds for the national motion-picture industry and submit a bill 
on national cinema to the Federal Assembly within three months. 
  There are nearly 300 film-makers at the forum in Moscow. 
Secretary of Russia's Cinematographic Union Sergey Solovyev, a 
film director, spoke about the Russian cinema's plight and ways 
to overcome it. The congress will last two days.

  [Text] On Friday the State Duma made a third attempt to 
adopt a resolution on Russia's federal budget for 1994. It was 
successful. The government-submitted draft budget was adopted 
"in principal." As many as 225 deputies voted for the 
resolution, 57 - against, and 21 abstained from voting. During 
the previous rounds of voting the draft resolution failed to 
collect the necessary 225 votes. 
  An extraordinary sitting of the State Duma Council convened 
by speaker Ivan Rybkin just after the budget's adoption 
coordinated changes in the draft resolution which was later 
approved by the deputies. 
  The resolution proposes to the government to revise the 
draft 
budget within two weeks by introducing changes into the budget's 
major characteristics in accordance with the recommendations of 
the lower chamber's committee and to determine the budgets for 
the 3rd and 4th quarters of 1994 separately. 
  The document states that the draft budget submitted by the 
government does not coincide with the prognosis of the country's 
social-economic development for 1994 and does not correspond to 
the priorities in social-economic policy announced in the 
Russian president's address to the Federal Assembly and the 
program of the Russian government entitled Development of 
Reforms and Stabilization of Russian Economy. 
  Deputies also believe that the expenditure part of the 
federal budget does not contain appropriations provided for by 
presidential decrees and government resolutions adopted this 
year. The deputies also pointed out that the draft budget 
provides for reduction of expenditures of the constituent 
members of the Federation with the simultaneous expansion of 
expenditures and strengthens tax pressure on producers. The 
resolution also proposes to the government to submit a draft of 
the federal budget for next year this September. 
  In the course of the debates leader of the Liberal 
Democratic 
Party [LDPR] Vladimir Zhirinovskiy declared that his faction 
would support the draft budget only if the parliament speaker 
reported to the Russian president the request of the LDPR to 
dismiss three ministers. Zhirinovskiy "is dissatisfied" with 
the activity of Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, Vice Premier 
Anatoliy Chubays, and Interior Minister Viktor Yerin.

<F P=106> [Maria Bogdanova report: "Anatoliy Sobchak Will Command </F>
Troops -- "Administration Chiefs Will Become Governors General"] 
  [Text] A response has been received to a letter by St. 
Petersburg Mayor Anatoliy Sobchak asking the president to grant 
him emergency powers to fight crime. Security Council Secretary 
Oleg Lobov has advised the mayor that his wish to use army units 
to combat crime does not contradict Russian military doctrine. 
  Oleg Lobov's letter makes it clear that a presidential edict 
is pending which will grant troop control functions to all 
regional administration chiefs, equal to Anatoliy Sobchak's. In 
fact, this is nothing new in Russia's history: In the past, 
governors were not obliged to ask the emperor's permission to 
use troops. As is known from school textbooks, however, the 
army has successfully acted against mutineers and strikers but 
failed to catch Vladimir Dubrovskiy. Observers fear that 
18-year old law enforcers on city streets can themselves fall 
victim to criminal gangs hunting for firearms. 
  As for the military's being used to reinforce large police 
operations, here one can apparently count only on fire support. 
Yet automatic rifle fire in the streets, far from calming the 
city, is fraught with inadvertent casualties. On the whole, it 
is obvious that the real effect from using the army to fight 
crime will be minimal. 
  This naturally suggests that the incumbent governors, just 
like their predecessors, will be able to use the army most 
effectively only to control demonstrators, pickets, and 
strikers. There is actually nothing terrible about this 
provided such actions are unauthorized or violate the voters' 
normal life. Oleg Lobov's letter, however, says that the draft 
edict provides for "legal foundations for using military units 
by the executive bodies of Russian Federation components to 
resolve separate tasks of combating crime and maintaining public 
order." Meanwhile, given the Russian governors' varying 
political complexions, it is likely that each of them will have 
his own assessment of the situation: One may deem dangerous a 
public rally by library workers in support of the democrats; 
another, by pensioners advocating a return to socialism. 
Moreover, expanded troop control powers make administration 
chiefs even more independent. Amid the unabated separatist 
trends of some regional leaders, this also looks rather dubious.

<F P=106> [Report by BELINFORM correspondent Yekaterina Vysotskaya for </F>
TASS] 
  [Text] Minsk 15 April, TASS -- "One should not be afraid 
that the foreign capital will turn its back to its Belarussian 
[Belarusian] partners because of the agreement with Russia. 
Honest investors, for whom partnership with Belarus is a matter 
of economy, not politics, have already come to our country, and 
the unification of the Belarussian and Russian markets will not 
influence those relations," Belarussian Prime Minister 
Vyacheslav Kebich said at a news conference. 
  He pointed out that problems connected with relations 
between 
Belarus and third countries are not coordinated with Russia. 
This is why it is for Belarus to decide whether to take foreign 
credits or not. 
  Responding to the question of journalists about the reaction 
of the International Monetary Fund to the signing of the 
agreement, Kebich said: "A letter that we received before the 
signing of the documents reaffirmed, that the IMF would continue 
to cooperate with us. Moreover, the letter asked to decide more 
quickly whether we join the rouble zone or not. So, our foreign 
partners were also waiting for an answer to the question: Shall 
we enter the rouble zone or not?"

  [Text] The Russian and U.S. military exercises of the 
peace-making forces at Totskiy in Orenburg Oblast will be held 
this summer. The presidents of the two countries made this 
decision, and it will probably not be changed. Colonel General 
Eduard Vorobyev, first deputy commander in chief of ground 
forces, told this to an ITAR-TASS correspondent. According to 
Vorobyev, preparation for the exercise is under way in 
conformity with the schedule. About 250 men will participate, 
one company from each side. Use of military technology and 
shooting are not included in the plans for the exercise. Gen. 
Vorobyev stressed: We do not intend to use a single fragment of 
force. Each side in the exercise will do its service in the 
relevant zone.

  [Text] During the visit by Lithuanian President Algirdas 
Brazauskas to the Council of Europe, a statement by Vytautas 
Landsbergis, a member of the Seimas delegation to the 
parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe on Russia's 
intention to join the Council of Europe was distributed among 
the parliamentarians of this organization. 
  In this statement, the Lithuanian Foreign Ministry is 
accused 
of conducting a policy based on Moscow's directives, reads a 
statement by this ministry, disseminated by its information and 
press department. 
  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs does not discuss the 
accusation, which is not based on any arguments, and stresses 
that such statements, which had more than once been publicly 
distributed abroad, harm the prestige of the Lithuanian state. 
  Lithuania's stance on Russia's membership in the Council of 
Europe is based on the following principles: 
  Russia must fulfill the conditions of the Council of Europe 
on the membership in that organization; 
  Lithuania will support Russia's membership in the Council of 
Europe only after Russia fulfills international obligations on 
the withdrawal of troops from Latvia and Estonia, respects the 
sovereignty of the neighboring states, human rights, and those 
of national minorities; 
  The support of the Council of Europe to Russia's democratic 
forces is a weighty contribution to the processes of 
democratization and the development of reforms in that country, 
says this statement in conclusion.

<F P=106> [Recorded excerpt from an interview with Russian Foreign </F>
Minister Andrey Kozyrev given at the Russian Foreign Ministry on 
16 April; from the "Novosti" newscast -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Kozyrev] So what happened? What happened was that 
air strikes were delivered without consultations with us. As a 
result, the situation aggravated sharply. Why? Because the 
party of war on both sides was probably just waiting for those 
air strikes. Our Western partners do not realize that they do 
not know the situation. I have to say that at present the 
situation is literally at a crossroads. There is a chance for a 
breakthrough toward ending hostilities, to be followed by 
separation of the sides, sending in peacekeeping forces there, 
and later a comprehensive political settlement, and naturally 
some steps in the Serbs' favor, with regard to sanctions. 
  The second option is a rampage of the party of war inside 
Bosnia, the continuation of bloodbath, shelling, possibly even 
seizure of hostages from among the UN forces, possibly further 
air strikes. But of course all this will grow like an avalanche, 
the tragedy of a conflagration of war. Unfortunately, I cannot 
as yet say with complete confidence whether we can secure the 
first option and avert the second. 
  [Announcer Sergey Medvedev] The Russian minister gave this 
interview to our program this afternoon. Two hours ago he flew 
to Belgrade to back Churkin's peace efforts.

  [Text] Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev flew to 
Belgrade this evening. ITAR-TASS has learned from the Russian 
Foreign Ministry that while in Yugoslavia he intends to conduct 
talks on a Bosnian settlement. Vitaliy Churkin, the Russian 
president's special envoy in former Yugoslavia, will also take 
part in the talks. 
  In an interview Andrey Kozyrev gave to INTERFAX before his 
departure, he noted that it was inadmissible that UN 
peacekeeping forces in Bosnia were becoming a target for 
attacks. In his view, harshest measures can be taken to defend 
them, including air strikes.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Consultations on the Black Sea Fleet </F>
Continue"] 
  [Text] Ukraine's first deputy minister of defense and 
chief of the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces A. Lopata 
and Ukraine's Deputy Minister of Defense I. Bizhan held a 
briefing for diplomats accredited in Ukraine on the incident 
that took place in Odessa between subdivisions of the Odessa 
Military District and the Black Sea Fleet. Lopata sent a 
telegram to the Russian Ministry of Defense in which he asked 
that the departure of the vessel the Cheleken from Odessa be 
halted until the situation is finally clarified. Ukrainian 
Minister of Defense V. Radetskyy tried to get in touch with P. 
Grachev, his counterpart in the Russian Federation. He sent 
Grachev a telegram in which the essence of the conflict and the 
position of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense were explained. 
Grachev's reply revealed a total lack of knowledge of the 
circumstances and a deliberate distortion of facts. For 
example, in his telegram, Grachev referred to the Cheleken as a 
Russian vessel. 
  On the proposal by Ukraine's Ministry of Defense, on 12 
April, consultations started between the Ministries of Defense 
of Ukraine and Russia and a search for ways to resolve the Black 
Sea Fleet problem. The delegation of the Russian Federation 
includes chief commander of the Naval Forces F. Gromov and 
Ambassador for Special Missions Yu. Dubinin. The Ukrainian 
delegation is headed by Minister of Foreign Affairs B. Tarasyuk. 
On the first day, the sides did not reach any agreement. On 13 
April, the consultations continued in Sevastopol.

<F P=106> [Report by Sigute Armonaite: "There May Be No Moratorium"] </F>
  [Excerpts] Yesterday, the Nationalists' Union held a press 
conference in the Seimas [parliament] building. Journalists 
were addressed by Seimas deputy Leonas Milcius and Landowners' 
Union Chairman Aloyzas Liaugaudas. [passage omitted] 
  L. Milcius reminded everyone that the Nationalists' faction 
in the Seimas supported the Social Democrats' proposal to 
express no-confidence in the government headed by A. 
Slezevicius. In his opinion, the government will probably not 
be removed, because this initiative might lack votes in the 
legislature. However, the discussion on economic issues in the 
country might be useful both to the government and the Seimas. 
  A. Liaugaudas commented on land laws adopted by the Seimas 
and claimed that most of them were unjust, because the 
suspension of land restoration to real owners was becoming the 
second act of land nationalization. He commented on the 
statement by the Nationalists, farmers, and landowners on the 
moratorium on private land plots [reference to two to three 
hectare plots that are being privatized], which was read in the 
Seimas last Thursday [7 April]. 
  According to L. Milcius, he was surprised by the reaction of 
the Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party faction to this statement. 
Some members of the majority faction said that such a text was 
insulting to them. 
  The essence of the moratorium is a protest against the 
government's decision to allow the sale of the land of "green 
areas" to its current users. This land should primarily be 
returned to its true owners. 
  Both speakers expressed their delight in President A. 
Brazauskas' decision to return the land law to the Seimas for 
upgrading and correcting its most controversial clause -- 
Article 21. If the legislature reviews this law and makes some 
amendments, the moratorium declared by the three unions may lose 
its importance.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: compiled by </F>
Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy; edited by Vladimir 
Shishlin] 
  [Text] President Guntis Ulmanis speaking in Riga said the 
signing of a package deal with Moscow on Russian troop 
withdrawals was largely hinged on a solution to the problem of 
repatriation of retired servicemen of Russia and the former 
Soviet Union residing in Latvia. 
  To bring this about, the negotiating teams will have to 
amend 
the initialled agreement on social security nets for retired 
Russian servicemen with permanent residence in Latvia, Ulmanis 
said. Ulmanis also considers it necessary to create an 
international support fund by Latvia, Russia and western 
countries to help towards voluntary repatriation of Russian 
servicemen (The Latvian government on Thursday had approved 
Ulmanis' proposal to set up an appropriate working group-IF). 
Nothing short of this can help defuse tension over the issue of 
retired servicemen whose presence here is widely seen as being 
undesirable, Ulmanis said. 
  He thinks the fund can also help repatriate 180,000 
non-Latvians who are willing to settle in Russia and other CIS 
states. The signing of the pullout agreement will be 
complicated unless the repatriation issue is resolved, Ulmanis 
said. 
  IF Note: The initialled agreement binds Latvia to ensure 
continued residence and non-discrimination of retired Russian 
servicemen in areas such social security and medical care. 
Official counts put the number of such pensioners at 22,000 
with 3,500 of them granted Latvian citizenship. 
  Ulmanis reiterated that no agreement would be signed with 
Moscow until the Russian president recalled his decree of April 
5 providing for the setting up of a Russian army base in Latvia. 
He considers it to be a tactical move to probe a possible 
reaction from Latvia and the West rather than a mistake as 
Russian officials try to present the decree.

  [Text] STRASBOURG, Apr 15, BNS - It is unlikely that 
Latvia would become full member in the Council of Europe [CE] 
before October, since the country has yet to adopt its 
citizenship law, the president of the CE Parliamentary Assembly, 
Miguel Angel Martinez, said at a meeting with the Estonian 
delegation for the assembly session Thursday [14 April]. 
  Martinez said he saw no other factor that might have a 
negative effect on Latvia's acceptance into the European body. 
He underscored that the "common European family" was missing 
Latvia. 
  The president of the Parliamentary Assembly pointed out in 
positive aspect the work of Estonia's representatives in the 
assembly. He said quick rise of Estonian parliament Deputy 
Speaker Tunne Kelam to one of the leading figures in the 
assembly was another great contribution to the country's good 
standing. 
  Martinez is expected to visit Estonia in May or June for 
meetings with the country's leaders and representatives of 
different factions in the parliament. He is also to meet then 
Uno Lohmus, who was elected member to the European Human Rights 
Committee at the assembly session Thursday. 
  Tunne Kelam, the leader of the Estonian delegation, at the 
meeting delivered to Martinez Estonia's propositions concerning 
the agenda of the visit.

  [Text] An extraordinary session of the government has 
passed amendments to the law on foreigners and stateless persons 
entering and staying in Latvia, and related to this law addenda 
to the law on police which envisions the creation of emigration 
police within the framework of the state police. Inese 
Birznietse, the Saeima human rights commission chairperson, 
explained that the amendments passed in accordance with the 
rules provided for by Article 81... apply to persons who arrived 
in Latvia illegally, and have been passed with an eye to 
improving the procedure for their expulsion from the country. 
The amendments to the law were fully agreed on with the CSCE 
mission but their final version have not been passed in Latvia, 
for which reason it has been impossible today to find out 
exactly what the expulsion procedure is and how one can appeal 
against it. Still, according to Birznietse, mass deportations 
are out of the question because the amendments also contain a 
reservation that they are not applicable to persons whose legal 
status in Latvia has not been determined and in whose regard 
legislation has so far not been brought into line.

  [Text] It is possible for the dismantling of Paldiski 
training reactors to start at the beginning of May. This has 
been reported by Juri Tikk, the government's special 
representative in Paldiski. The necessary equipment for 
dismantling the reactors and the containers for transporting 
nuclear fuel are in place and are located at the training 
complex on the Pakri peninsula. 
  In the words of Tikk, the Russian side demands social 
guarantees to those Russian officers who will participate in the 
dismantling work. The Russian side wants a single agreement for 
dismantling and evacuation to Russia of both the reactor nuclear 
fuel and the entire reactor complex. The Estonian side wants a 
separate agreement concerning the removal of the reactor nuclear 
fuel from Estonia and a separate agreement concerning the 
reactor complex being emptied of the reactor fuel, said Tikk. 
  The nuclear fuel can be taken away in a container either by 
railway or by sea. The entire reactor, the complex weighing 
(?over) 100 tonnes, can be taken to Russia by railway or by sea, 
by using a floating crane and [words indistinct] special 
containers. But none of the projects have as yet been finally 
confirmed, stated Raul Luks. 
  The most dangerous stage during the dismantling of the two 
reactors located on the Pakri peninsula is, in the words of Raul 
Luks, the lifting of the reactor lids to remove the nuclear fuel. 
  At the nuclear facilities in Russia, in the words of Tikk, 
on 
three occasions when the lids of reactors have been opened. A 
radioactive steam cloud has escaped into the atmosphere. This 
has a radius of approximately 10 kms, stated Tikk. 
  Estonia does not intend to conceal anything during the 
dismantling of the reactors, explained Tikk. In his words, a 
radiation monitoring service operates in Estonia which relays 
information on the level of radioactivity.

  [Excerpts] As already reported, the meeting of CIS heads of 
state has ended. This meeting was preceded by a joint meeting 
of the foreign ministers of the CIS Republics. Azerbaijani 
Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov represented our state for the 
signing of important documents. Our reporter, Beshir Sherifov, 
interviewed Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov after the 
meeting. 
  [Begin recording] [Sherifov] You took part in the meeting of 
the foreign ministers of the CIS countries. What issues of 
interest to Azerbaijan were discussed at this meeting? 
  [Gasanov] I want to express my views primarily on two 
documents: One was on ethnic minorities, and the other on the 
sovereignty of the states. The document on ethnic minorities 
was put forward by other states. This was the third time that 
it was being discussed, and for the third time we objected to 
its adoption. The reason for our objection was that this 
document included provisions that had supremacy over Azerbaijani 
laws. In expressing our position, we said that we cannot sign 
any provisions found in this or any other document that are 
above Azerbaijani laws. 
  [Sherifov] That is, the Azerbaijani laws must be confirmed 
in 
all these documents. 
  [Gasanov] Of course. That is the only thing possible. Other 
states too were of the same opinion. Therefore, the work on 
this [Armenian] document is continuing, but it was not endorsed 
for the time being. Its sponsors had hoped that it was to have 
been endorsed today. We made the first move. 
  The second important document concerning us is this one that 
I am holding. [word indistinct] signed and brought it to me. 
Azerbaijan is the sponsor of this document. Because it is in 
Russian, I will read it in Russian; it could be translated later 
if need be. [passage omitted] 
  We are the sponsors of this document. This is the first time 
that such a document has been adopted, despite the fact that the 
CIS has been in existence for the last three years. No such 
document had ever been submitted here. When we first submitted 
it they initially received it coldly. But we held intensive 
consultations both during the joint talks and bilateral talks at 
presidential, ministerial, and lower levels. And finally, this 
document was endorsed with great difficulty because the Armenian 
foreign minister expressed strong opposition to it, but we 
firmly demanded the adoption of this document. I can state that 
11 states supported us and this document was endorsed. 
  [Sherifov] What was its main thrust? 
  [Gasanov] The main focus was explained in its preface. All 
of the provisions needed by us were in there. Such as that no 
state can occupy the territory of another state, covet another's 
land, borders cannot be altered, the alteration of borders by 
war cannot be described in any other way than what it is, a 
political status cannot be demanded by war, and so on. Due to a 
lack of time, we cannot analyze it but we have established its 
nature. The Armenians said they will not sign it. They made a 
reservation noting that alongside this document another document 
should also be adopted recognizing self-determination for any 
people. They distributed the document. We have a copy, we read 
it. It was a document incompatible with international norms. 
Despite the fact that the Armenian foreign minister several 
times strongly urged its discussion during yesterday's meeting, 
it was never examined. 
  [Sherifov] Besides ours, what was the position of the other 
states? 
  [Gasanov] It was identical to ours. All the representatives 
of the 11 countries voted as one person for this [Azerbaijani] 
document. These 11 states did not give any importance to that 
[Armenian] document. There is a regulation at the CIS foreign 
ministerial meeting that if any proposal is submitted with which 
we were previously unfamiliar then a special working group is 
formed and is asked to study it and submit it to the next 
meeting. Not even a working group was formed on the Armenian 
document. They might submit it again the next time around. 
That is a problem for the future, but for now, it was not 
adopted. Meanwhile, we have endorsed and signed this 
[Azerbaijani] document, and we have submitted it to other CIS 
heads of state to enable them to study it the next few days. I 
am certain that the document will be signed. [end recording]

  [Text] The Azerbaijani Army on Monday [18 April] morning 
resumed attacks on Nagorno-Karabakh positions in the Mardakert, 
Martuni and Fizuli sectors of the front, a Nagorno-Karabakh 
military source said. 
  He told INTERFAX fighting was still in progress at noon. 
  On Sunday, intense fighting was going on on a large section 
of the front in Mardakert and Fizuli Districts. 
  The source said Nagorno-Karabakh forces had rebuffed all the 
strikes and had switched over to launching counterattacks in 
some areas, mainly in Mardakert District where it had destroyed 
some of the Azerbaijani firing positions. 
  The source denied Azerbaijani reports that hundreds of 
Nagorno-Karabakh troops had been killed. He said Azerbaijan's 
losses had been much heavier than Nagorno-Karabakh's. 
  Meanwhile, the Azerbaijani Defense Ministry said that, on 
Sunday afternoon, Armenian tank units positioned in northern 
Nagorno-Karabakh had made several attempts to advance towards 
the town of Terter, but were stopped by Azerbaijani forces, 
which destroyed six Armenian tanks and seized another two pieces 
of new armor. 
  Early on Monday morning, the Armenians once again tried to 
break through to Terter, simultaneously attacking villages close 
to the town, but were thrown back around 0800 after heavy 
fighting, losing three tanks, one armored personnel carrier and 
about 90 troops, the ministry said.

  [Text] An Azerbaijani sabotage group composed of Afghan 
Mojahedins was eliminated near the Karabakh regional center of 
Mardakert on 17 April, the Nagorno-Karabakh Defense Headquarters 
told INTERFAX. 
  The same sources said there had been about 20 Afghan 
Mojahedins killed in the hostilities. They had been identified 
by their particular ethnic clothing. 
  The losses of the Karabakh forces, which have opted for the 
self-defense tactics are less significant than that suffered by 
the Azerbaijani forces, Deputy Commander of the Nagorno-Karabakh 
Army, Murad Petrosyan, told INTERFAX. 
  Petrosyan said the Karabakh Army had lost several dozen men 
and the Azerbaijani party had lost about 600 men. 
  The Karabakh Army had also eliminated or seized fifteen 
items 
of armored equipment, including eight tanks and five armored 
carrier vehicles, two 122-millimeter heavy machine-guns and two 
howitzers.

compiled by Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy and edited by 
Vladimir Shishlin] 
  [Text] The Armenian and Azeri presidents had failed to meet 
each other in Moscow because of continued differences over a 
peace settlement to the conflict in Nagorno Karabakh, Armenian 
Foreign Minister Vahan Papazyan said in Moscow on Monday. He 
also ruled out the possibility of such a meeting in any 
foreseeable future. 
  Papazian said the scheduled four-party meeting of Russia, 
Armenia, Azerbaijan and Nagorno Karabakh whose Defence Minister 
Robert Kacharian was in Moscow during the CIS summit had been 
derailed because of Baku's rejection of the Moscow-proposed 
regional peace plan. 
  The meeting would have been held had Baku accepted the plan 
providing for the deployment of CIS peacekeepers in the region 
something that Yerevan and Stepanakert agree to, he said. 
  Papazian said Russia had alone agreed to send its troops to 
the region because the United Nations was unable to do so at the 
moment. However, he said Russia would prefer to join a 
peacekeeping operation sponsored by the CIS or Eastern Europe 
instead. 
  "So will Azerbaijan, I am sure," he said. 
  On Azeri leader Heydar Aliyev's accusation of Armenia of 
launching aggression on Azerbaijan, Papazyan stressed that 
although "Armenia is a party to the conflict, it is not a 
warring side." 
IF Note: President Aliyev called on other CIS leaders to pass 
a political assessment of Armenia's aggression on his country, 
demand an end to hostilities against Azerbaijan and an immediate 
Armenian pullout from occupied lands. In a statement at the CIS 
summit, he demanded that Yerevan provide firm guarantees for a 
non-resumption of hostilities calling for sanctions against 
Armenia for its aggression on a fellow CIS state. Aliyev 
accused Yerevan of derailing any constructive proposals for 
regional peace by setting knowingly unacceptable conditions. 
Armenia, which set up a military beachhead inside Azerbaijan, 
now seeks to swap annexed lands for the enclave's independence 
or in other words, to partition Azerbaijan, Aliyev said. 
  For his part, Papazyan said that although Yerevan refrained 
from internationalizing the conflict, it would step immediately 
if Karabakh Armenians had to face the threat of deportation or 
genocide.

  [Text] Tashkent 18 April, TASS -- Chinese Prime Minister Li 
Peng has called for broader cooperation and closer friendship 
with Uzbekistan which dates back to the time of the great silk 
route. 
  Li Peng arrived in Tashkent on his first official visit on 
Monday. During his three-day stay he will meet with Uzbek 
leaders to discuss bilateral relations, regional and 
international issues. 
  The visit is the first leg of his foreign trip, the first in 
the last 18 months, during which he will also visit 
Turkmenistan, Kirghizia [Kyrgyzstan], Kazakhstan and Mongolia. 
He is the highest foreign leader to visit the four Central 
Asian republics since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 
December 1991. 
  Li Peng said China is interested in maintaining good 
relations with Central Asian republics and Russia. He said 
China wants to have long-term, stable and friendly relations 
with Uzbekistan on the basis of the five principles of peaceful 
coexistence. 
  China established diplomatic relations with Uzbekistan in 
January 1992. The two countries have also agreed to establish 
embassies and trade offices in China and Uzbekistan and signed a 
bilateral agreement on trade and economic cooperation. 
  "I am glad that I am here, in this ancient and world-known 
city of Tashkent," Li Peng said. "The visit by President Islam 
Karimov of Uzbekistan to our country in 1992 opened a new page 
in the history of friendly relations between our countries" and 
gave a powerful impetus to their development and expansion, he 
continued. 
  The Chinese premier expressed the hope that "the documents 
to 
be signed during the visit will strengthen friendly ties and 
elevate our economic cooperation to a new height." 
  Karimov stressed that Li Peng's visit is taking place at a 
time when political, economic, trade and cultural ties between 
the two countries are growing ever stronger. He expressed the 
confidence that the visit will become a new step towards 
strengthening relations between Uzbekistan and China. "Friendly

  [Text] Tashkent April 19 ITAR-TASS -- The expansion of 
bilateral trade and economic cooperation and the restoration of 
the ancient silk way linking China to the Central Asian 
countries was in the focus of talks between President Islam 
Karimov of Uzbekistan and Chinese Premier Li Peng here today. 
Chinese diplomats in the Uzbek capital told ITAR-TASS that the 
talks also deal with regional and international problems. 
  On Tuesday morning the Chinese premier laid flowers at the 
monument to great poet and thinker Alisher Navoy. 
  Both countries now have more ground for further deepening 
friendly relations, Islam Karimov said at the state dinner in 
honour of the Chinese leader on Monday. He called on the 
numerous entrepreneurs, who accompanied the Chinese premier to 
establish direct ties with enterprises in Uzbekistan. Islam 
Karimov pointed to "great successes of the great Chinese people" 
in reforming their economy and said that "the people of 
Uzbekistan have a great interest in everything that is taking 
place in China". 
  According to Karimov, Li Peng's visit contributes to the 
beginning of a new era in relations between the two countries. 
  Li Peng recalled that the two countries are "close 
neighbours 
and countries with ancient civilisations" and said a new period 
of relations between them began after Uzbekistan proclaimed 
independence. China, he stressed, needs "a good international 
situation to accomplish its own modernisation. For this reason 
China pays great attention to the development of relations with 
the neighbouring countries. 
  The Chinese premier supported the proposal to restore the 
silk way as a means of developing trade, economic and cultural 
ties between the two countries. "China intends to make efforts 
to achieve this end," he said. 
  China, a considerable part of whose territory, particularly 
the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, is populated by Muslims, 
is seriously concerned about the spread of Islamic 
fundamentalism in the Asian republics of the former USSR. 
Xinjiang has long been known as harbouring strong separatist 
tendencies under Islamic slogans. 
  Li Peng, whose foreign trip will also take him to 
Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan and Mongolia, is being 
accompanied on the tour by chairman of the State Committee for 
Nationalities Ismail Aimat, an ethnic Uygur, who stands for the 
country's Muslim population in the Chinese leadership. 
  The head of the Chinese Government arrived for a three-day 
official visit to the capital of Uzbekistan on Monday.

  [Text] The situation on the Tajik-Afghan border remains 
complex. Some field commanders from the antigovernment 
opposition and the Islamic Rebirth Movement plan to attack 
border installations and plant field mines in Tajikistan along 
the border with Afghanistan. 
  As the Tajik Foreign Ministry's Spokesman Zafar Saidov 
disclosed at a briefing in Dushanbe on Saturday, the foreign 
department had received from the Afghan Embassy in Russia a 
note, which says that the Afghan Defence Ministry is ready to 
take the situation in the Imam-Sakhi (the Kunduz province) under 
control. It was from that area that Tajik militants shelled a 
border check point at Nizhny Pyanj on 11 April. The Afghan 
Defence Ministry pledged to do all it can to prevent such 
actions, Saidov said. 
  He also reported that the Afghan authorities had asked the 
Tajik leadership to step up joint actions and stabilize the 
situation on the border.

Faculty of Philosophy and holds a candidate's degree in 
philosophy. She was a lecturer at the national university. For 
over five years she worked in district committees of the 
Republic's capital. 
  Roza Otunbayeva, 44, held the posts of the deputy chairman

  The new appointment has been made on the eve of Chinese 
Premier Li Peng's visit to Kirghizia.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Akimov] </F>
  [Text] Almaty 19 April, TASS -- The new Supreme Soviet of 
Kazakhstan began work here today morning. It will be half the 
size of the previous parliament and will work on a permanent 
professional basis. 
  The MP's, who have won their mandates during the 7 March 
elections, are to decide some organisational questions first, 
particularly the structural pattern of the parliament. They are 
also to elect their speaker. Then the parliament will go over 
to the endorsement of the agenda and to the discussion of the 
items included in it. 
  But this may prove to be a difficult job. Several parties 
and public movements of the republic have declared that they 
would join the opposition against the present executive 
authorities. And if the MP's, sharing their views, decide to 
form their own blocs, the Supreme Soviet will hardly be able to 
avoid an acute factional struggle for power from the very outset. 
  The MP's will also be influenced by the situation around 
parliament house. More than 300 veterans of war and labor, 
invalids, and representatives of work collectives are picketing 
it from early morning today. They demand better living 
conditions, steps to curb the inflation and growing prices. A 
large meeting began there a short while ago. Its participants 
are protesting against the government's economic and social 
policy, which has placed many people far below the poverty line.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "At the Belarusian Defense Ministry"] </F>
  [Text] On 11 April, Colonel General Pavel Kazlowski, the 
Belarusian defense minister, chaired a meeting of Collegium 
members and chiefs of administration and services at the Defense 
Ministry Central Administration. 
  At the beginning of the meeting, the defense minister 
introduced Major Ye. Nikulin and Colonel S. Kuznetsov, appointed 
to the posts of chief of the control and inspection agency and 
chief of the education and training department, respectively. 
  After the introductions, Col. Gen. Kazlowski informed those 
present about a grave accident in the town of Kobryn in which 
several children were killed, as well as some other cases, 
bordering on emergencies, which displayed negligence and a lack 
of responsibility on the part of ranking officials. 
  It was noted that certain commanders have sometimes adopted 
irresponsible attitudes toward the performance of their duties, 
are too lenient with their subordinates, and fail to bring to 
account those who do not work hard. This kind of attitude makes 
people lazy and provides a suitable environment for violations 
of combat discipline. 
  The defense minister demanded a strengthening of personnel 
education and heightened personal responsibility from all 
commanders and chiefs, which should eliminate even minor 
violations of manuals, orders, and daily routines. Every case 
of violations of combat discipline and manuals must be put under 
scrutiny, the perpetrators punished, and a consequent analysis 
and conclusion made. A specific individual should answer for 
his misdemeanor. One just cannot keep working and serving this 
way any longer. Officers and generals, without exception, must 
revise their attitudes toward service and their military duty, 
and do their best to elevate combat readiness, discipline, and 
self-organization to an appropriate level. 
  The colonel general continued by suggesting that the Cabinet 
of Ministers should step up examination of draft army 
regulations and submit them to the Belarusian Supreme Soviet 
Presidium for approval. He ordered a comprehensive audit of the 
"Transaviaeksport" company, the findings of which will then have 
to be passed on to the Defense Ministry, requested normalization 
of material and technical supplies to the Military Academy, and 
focused on the situation surrounding the garrison "Zvyozdochka" 
[Little Star] department store. 
  The defense minister brought up the issue of the upcoming 
CIS 
summit in Moscow and the scheduled negotiations between 
Belarusian and Russian Defense Ministry delegations. 
  Reports were also delivered by Lieutenant General N. 
Churkin, 
chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces and first deputy 
defense minister, and Major General M. Stankevich, deputy 
defense minister for armaments. 
  At the end of the meeting, Col. Gen. P. Kazlowski set 
specific objectives for the immediate future.

  [Text] Chairman of the Belarusian Parliament Mechyslaw Hryb 
told journalists in Minsk Monday that during the talks with 
Russian President Yeltsin in Moscow late last week the two sides 
reached the understanding that the signed Belarusian-Russian 
documents (on the unification of monetary systems) should be 
strictly in line with the Constitutions of the two countries. 
  Hryb said that changes may be introduced in the text of 
Article 5 of the Belarusian-Russian agreement to avoid changes 
in the Belarusian Constitution. 
  In line with the existing Belarusian Constitution, the 
Republic's national bank is a the only body with the right to 
shape monetary policy independently. 
  In line with the Russian-Belarusian agreement, these 
functions are carried out by the Russian Central Bank under 
conditions of a single monetary system. 
  Asked by INTERFAX to assess the initiative by Kazakh 
President Nazarbayev on the creation of a Euro-Asian union, Hryb 
said that so far the idea had not been discussed officially. 
  Meanwhile, the CIS executive secretary Ivan Korotchenya in 
an 
interview with Interfax on the same day in Minsk said that 
Nazarbayev's idea suggests the thought for closer unity among 
the CIS countries, though the European model of the community is 
prefered by many Commonwealth states. Korotchenya believes that 
it will take time for CIS states to agree to Nazarbayev's idea. 
  He did not rule out the probability of the fact that with 
time the leaders of the CIS states may return to the idea of a 
Euro-Asian union.

  [Text] Today, legislative speaker Mechyslaw Hryb and Head 
of the CIS Executive Secretariat Ivan Karatchenya held a news 
conference at the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Belarus, 
dedicated to the results of the regular conference of the CIS 
heads of state and government, held in Moscow last week. 
Mechyslaw Hryb told those present about the conference and 
voiced satisfaction over its results. In particular, he pointed 
out that 26 issues were addressed and as many documents signed. 
They were on the implementation of the treaty on the forming of 
the economic union, the realization of commissions issued by the 
Heads of State Council, the issues discussed at the initiative 
of states, statutory, and branch bodies of the Commonwealth, and 
so on. 
  The Supreme Soviet chairman answered reporters questions 
about the agreement signed between the Government of the Russian 
Federation and the Republic of Belarus on the unification of 
monetary systems. The legislative speaker said that he was not 
an advocate of amending the Constitution and has no right to do 
this. This can be resolved solely by the Supreme Soviet.

<F P=106> [Report by Oleg Stepanenko: "Vyacheslav Kebich: I Have Not </F>
Sold Belarus Out"] 
  [Text] Minsk -- Before leaving for the meeting of heads of 
state and government in Moscow, Vyacheslav Kebich, chairman of 
the Belarus Council of Ministers, held a press conference for 
local and foreign correspondents devoted to the agreement 
concluded 12 April on unifying the Belorussian [Belarusian] and 
Russian monetary systems. 
  "As far as the accusations that I have sold out Belarus or 
handed it over to somebody are concerned, I can state officially 
yet again that I made my choice and have no regrets. This was 
the choice of my life, and I am prepared to sacrifice everything 
to see it all through to the finish, since I am profoundly 
convinced that union [soyuz] with Russia will be our salvation 
and our children's salvation." 
  The prime minister talked in detail about how the agreement 
had come about. The work began two years ago, he noted, but it 
has been particularly intensive for the past eight months. The 
Belorussian side submitted 30 versions of the agreement during 
this period. Vigorous opposition from certain forces within both 
Belorussia and Russia had to be overcome. 
  As PRAVDA has already reported, the agreement is in two 
parts. The first applies to the unification of monetary systems, 
while the second applies to matters with a direct bearing on 
customs operations, duties, and the status of Russian troops on 
Belorussian territory. The articles in part two of the 
agreement, which envisage the lifting of trade duties and 
payments to allow Russian goods to transit Belorussian territory 
or to allow the Russian side to lease strategic installations, 
come into force 26 April.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Demidetskiy] </F>
  [Text] Kishinev [Chisinau] 18 April, TASS -- The economic 
crisis in Moldavia [Moldova] has resulted in the considerable 
drop in living standards in the Republic. The state statistic 
department announced today that the monetary incomes of the 
population in the first quarter of this year were about one half 
those of the same period last year. 
  In March, the average wage was 70 lei, (16 USD), ten times 
more than at the beginning of last year. The prices, however, 
rose seventeen times during the same period. 
  Experts believe that the worsening of the situation in 
Moldavia was caused not only by the crisis triggered off by 
economic reform, but also by the mistakes made by the old 
parliament over the past three years and the first two 
governments. The conflicts in Trans-Dniester and the Gagauz 
region, as well as the uncertain stance on membership of the 
Commonwealth of Independent States have resulted in the loss of 
almost one-third of the Republic's production potential. 
Moldavia has broken up into three parts and has begun to lose 
its traditional market in the east. 
  Pressed for time, the preceding government signed a 
memorandum with International Monetary Fund which promised loans 
on certain conditions. The first part of these conditions has 
been met -- after the introduction of Moldovan currency, the 
national bank succeeded in curbing inflation by regulating the 
issue of money and credits and reducing the budget deficit. But 
the second part of the memorandum, relating to economic 
restructuring, investment activity, and the development of 
entrepreneurship and a market infrastructure has yet to be 
handled. 
  The unwieldy state sector has begun to choke without the 
customary credit infusions from the government. Redundant 
people have been unable to find employment in the private 
sector, which is in its embryonic state. As a result the 
production slump and hidden unemployment have reached a 
dangerous line. 
  The new government approved last week is facing a difficult 
mission of telling the bitter truth to the people: there are no 
miracles and time has come to pay for the mistakes made in the 
first years of independence. It will take not a couple of 
months but years of hard work to correct the errors, pull the 
country out of the crisis and reach the pre-perestroika standard 
of living.

  [Text] Simferopol 18 April, TASS -- Crimean President Yuriy 
Meshkov and Vice-Prime Minister Yevgeniy Saburov called on the 
CIS leaders to support the return of the deported people of the 
Republic. 
  In an appeal issued on the eve of the 50th anniversary of 
the 
deportation of Crimean Tatars, Armenians, Bulgarians, Greeks and 
Germans from the Crimea, they stressed that the disintegration 
of the Soviet Union and the emergence of new independent states 
have complicated their return to their homeland. 
  Ukraine cannot finance the programme alone, the appeal said. 
Meshkov and Saburov called on the CIS presidents and governments 
to support the programme and help restore the rights of the 
deported people.

Estenson, born in 1962, who was temporarily staying on the 
territory of our state, was expelled from Ukraine for attempts 
to carry out actions that can be qualified as international 
nuclear terrorism in relation to a foreign state. 
  As UNIAN learned from reliable sources, the Swedish subject 
was seeking contacts with relevant specialists with the aim of 
taking nuclear warhead components away from Ukraine. According 
to unofficial data, the organization which, presumably, tasked 
Estensson has not yet been disclosed.

  [Text] A senior member of Ukrainian President Leonid 
Kravchuk's staff said Kravchuk's possible decision to put the 
extent of his authority before a national referendum would be 
"logical" and "absolutely constitutional." 
  "Since parliament has not solved the problem of presidential 
powers, Kravchuk will appeal to the people," Nikolay 
Mikhalchenko told INTERFAX on Monday. 
  Earlier Kravchuk said he would not stand for the next term 
of 
presidency in the June 26 elections because the future 
president's powers had not yet been delineated. Last month, 
parliament passed a law, which would give local councils to be 
elected on June 26 all executive authority in their respective 
regions and would dismiss regional presidential envoys. 
Kravchuk believes the president would then effectively cease to 
be head of the Executive Branch.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 74 (564): </F>
Compiled by Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy; Edited by 
Vladimir Shishlin] 
  [Text] During his stay in Moscow last weekend President 
Leonid Kravchuk visited INTERFAX headquarters and answered 
questions from our correspondents. 
  INTERFAX: Ukraine's signing of the CIS treaty of an economic 
union was one of the highlights of the Moscow CIS summit. Why 
did the Ukrainian leadership choose the status of an associated 
member and what practical benefit can Ukraine derive from it? 
  KRAVCHUK: I think that in this case the difference between 
full and associated members is symbolic because the CIS has not 
taken final shape yet. The Commonwealth is in the making. 
Ukraine's signature under all economic documents of the summit 
is another indication of the fact that there is practically no 
difference between associated and full members. The point is 
that when the Ukrainian parliament discussed the founding 
documents of the CIS, it ratified them with certain reservations 
which remain in force and being president I could not ignore 
them when I signed the treaty. This is the explanation for our 
associated status, but it will not prevent us from most active 
and full membership in the union in the future. 
  IF Note: On 15 April after discussing the implementation of 
the treaty of the economic union the Moscow summit formed the 
commission of the union. An agreement on the gradual formation 
of a free trade zone was also signed. 
  INTERFAX: Some politicians are disappointed with the low 
efficiency of the CIS and offer other patterns of integration of 
former Soviet republics. What is your attitude to the idea of 
the President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbaev concerning an 
Eurasian union and the calls of the Russian Deputy 
Prime-Minister Sergey Shakhray for a confederation of Eurasian 
states? 
  KRAVCHUK: Today the large-scale integration which some 
politicians speak of imply the European Union as a model is 
beyond our possibilities. It would be naive to think that the 
signing of certain decisions automatically leads to the 
formation of effective integration mechanisms whether it be the 
CIS or the Eurasian union. In order to be effective, conditions 
should be formed gradually step by step. We should have 
complete clarity: what aims and tasks do we put forward? 
  It is an open secret that the European Union covered a road 
of 35 years before it reached its present form. The CIS is only 
a couple of years old and we have not yet managed to build 
mechanisms guaranteeing the Commonwealth at least minimal 
efficiency. It is not a question of the reluctance of leaders 
to resolve the matters, but the absence of objective conditions. 
  Besides, the transition to other forms of integration should 
be civilized. First of all, a team of truly qualified persons 
should define all the parameters of such transformation and 
later discuss the matter with the public. Look how tolerantly 
European countries approach these matters, what respect they 
show for the public: they hold referendums and polls. Our 
mentality has been different: leaders would get together, sign 
papers and consider the matter settled. And we are not 
concerned at all about the public response, believing that the 
people will later see what is what. Probably, that is not quite 
correct. 
  I do not reject the idea of deepening integration in 
principle, but I do not want it to become a subject of hasty 
solutions at this moment. 
  INTERFAX: There is certain anxiety in Russian government 
circles about the results of Ukrainian parliamentary elections. 
It stems from the victory of opposite political forces in 
different parts of your country. What do you think of the 
forecasts about the growing disintegration of Ukraine and the 
prediction that for the sake of consolidation an attempt might 
be made to play the nationalist card using such problems as the 
Black Sea Fleet etc.? 
  KRAVCHUK: The results of our parliamentary elections prompt 
the question: consolidation around what or confrontation with 
whom? In Russia, by the way, different forces won strong 
positions in parliament, but no Russian political circles are 
debating the possibility of Russia joining Ukraine. If anyone 
raised the matter in your Federal Assembly, the person would 
hardly be taken seriously. 
  We can speak of certain differences between western and 
eastern regions over the future of the country whether it should 
be independent, with Russia or under Russia. As president I 
declare that I want to live in friendship, cooperation and 
partnership with Russia. But I do not wish to be under Russia. 
Some people accuse me of hypocrisy. I am really convinced that 
this form of bilateral relations is the best -- friendship and 
partnership. 
  The acute problems should be resolved so that Ukraine and 
Russia would live as good neighbors. I think we have managed to 
resolve one of them -- nuclear weapons stationed in Ukraine. I 
am pleased that the trilateral agreement 
(Yeltsin-Clinton-Kravchuk) is beginning to work despite the 
difficulties. 
  The next matter is the Black Sea Fleet. Without going into 
details I would want to view the Odessa incident as an example 
of fast and constructive settlement of matters related to the 
fleet. We should not try to find the right and the wrong side, 
but use mechanisms worked out in Yalta, Zavidovo and Massandra. 
It is simply necessary to sit down to the negotiating table 
guided by good intentions. There can be no other approach. 
  When the Russian military say they intend to control the 
entire fleet and infrastructure and Ukrainians say they will not 
give away anything, both sides are unrealistic, they are making 
a mistake. Here are a few figures. According to 1992 prices, 
the fleet with its infrastructure cost 35 trillion rubles or $35 
Bn [billion] according to the then exchange rate. If today 
Ukraine accepts the version suggested by the Russian military, 
Russia must immediately pay Ukraine $14 Bn. Can Russia afford 
that? 
  Therefore one should not kick up a racket. The problem 
should be resolved gradually on a realistic basis avoiding 
slogans. First, the fleet should be separated, divided because 
if there are two commanders "in one kitchen," they are bound to 
argue. The experience of relations between fleet commanders and 
the commanders of the Ukrainian navy has proved that. 
  At the next stage the matter of the Russian naval base 
should 
be resolved in keeping with international principles. In this 
case we mean Sevastopol. But that is too little for your 
military. They are pressuring the political leadership and the 
leadership is procrastinating the solution of the problem. When 
your military say, that in addition to Sevastopol Feodosia, 
Odessa, Izmail, Nikolayev and all airfields should be considered 
the naval base, I ask them: "Are you serious?" Twelve Russian 
naval bases in Ukraine! That is impossible. The matter belongs 
to parliament. 
  Several times already Ukraine has expressed its agreement to 
sell Russia part of the fleet and I have not given up these 
intentions. But first we should have a chance to see the 
documents and find out what costs what. I have the right to 
know that I am giving away. 
  INTERFAX: One gets the impression that you can effectively 
cooperate with Boris Yeltsin on the acutest matters, like in 
Massandra on the fleet problem, but later these concrete 
decisions of the presidents are not carried out. 
  KRAVCHUK: Every nation elects the leader to its liking. 
Russians elected Yeltsin, Ukrainians -- Kravchuk. Whether we 
fit each other as persons or not, we must work together. As for 
Boris Yeltsin personally, I find a possibility to resolve 
difficult matters with him. I raise questions and get a clear 
answer, positive or negative, but clear. 
  You mentioned the Massandra agreement (under the protocol to 
it the Ukrainian part of the fleet was to be leased by Russia -- 
INTERFAX). However, this document was preceeded by the Yalta 
and Zavidovo agreements (on the division of the fleet -- 
INTERFAX). No one denounced. They were still in force. The 
Massandra protocol was very beneficial to certain political 
forces. They forgot about Yalta and Zavidovo and concentrated 
on the Massandra protocol. 
  The three documents should be taken as a package and the 
problem resolved fast. 
  IF Note: The Moscow talks between Russia and Ukraine last 
Friday resulted in an agreement on the gradual settlement of 
problems related to the Black Sea Fleet. Under the document the 
two sides "willing to strengthen friendship, cooperation and 
partnership" agreed on the following: 
  1. The Ukrainian navy and the Russian Black Sea Fleet shall 
be based separately. 
  2. Ukraine shall keep 15-20 percent of the fleet's ships and 
vessels. 
  3. An agreement on the parameters of such a division shall 
be worked out within 10 days. The Ukrainian Defence Minister 
Vitaliy Radetskiy told the press that the fleet shall be divided 
fifty-fifty. Out of the half that is going to Ukraine 15-20 
percent will be kept by Kiev and the rest sold to Russia. 
However, the Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev has not 
confirmed this interpretation. 
  INTERFAX: Many experts believe that the incident involving 
the Cheleken hydrographic ship for the first time demonstrated 
the possibility of an armed clash between Ukrainians and 
Russians. Do you earnestly think of ways to rule out the very 
possibility of the repetition of such conflict situations in the 
future? 
  KRAVCHUK: This is the key question for us. We should not 
argue over matters related to the Black Sea Fleet and especially 
Sevastopol, even though I realize how painful they are for the 
Russian mentality. The Russian leadership is bound to take it 
into account and protect Russians, while I must protect Ukraine. 
  We must make decisions that would guarantee our peoples who 
have lived shoulder to shoulder for 340 years against arguments. 
It is the task of politicians to demonstrate restraint and will 
without permitting themselves to be dragged into conflict 
situations which armed people always begin. 
  Sometimes one shot aggravates problems so much that it 
becomes impossible to stop the avalanche later. The examples 
and lessons are before our eyes: Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia. 
That is why I am in favor of quick solutions, of not putting 
things off. 
  We have no right to argue even over the Crimea. We should do 
so that the Crimea would not separate us and our peoples. 
Leaders come and go, nations remain.

  [Text] The presidential election campaign has begun in 
Ukraine. The authorities are clearly inspired by the high 
turnout during the parliamentary elections and call this a good 
example. Western observers have a somewhat different opinion. 
For example, American representatives have stated that it was 
not possible to elect a genuinly legitimate parliament. The 
Americans have reported numerous complaints that candidates from 
the parties in power had freer access to the media. 
  [Correspondent Aleksandr Tachenko] The forecasts of the 
early 
collapse of Ukraine have turned out to be somewhat exaggerated, 
which President Leonid Kravchuk thinks as well. 
  [Begin Kravchuk recording, in Ukrainian with superimposed 
Russian translation] Analysis shows that neither the extreme 
left nor the extreme right received a large advantage. 
Everything depends on whether the deputies are able to create a 
strong center. If they create one -- and I hope they will -- 
then I hope that there will be no threat of collapse. [end 
recording] 
  [Tkachenko] Other active participants in the political 
process in Ukraine commented on the results of the recent 
elections in their own way in an interview on the "Itogi" 
program. 
  [Begin recording] [Vyacheslav Chornovil, leader of Rukh] The 
parliament was elected in accordance with what is probably the 
worst electoral law in Europe. Only the Belarusian law can 
compete, and these are the results. Then you must not forget 
that elections under conditions of an economic recession and the 
impoverishment of the population always give opportunities to 
extreme forces, both extreme left and right. 
  [Leonid Kuchma, president of the Ukrainian Union of 
Industrialists and Entrepreneurs] I hope that there will be a 
center in parliament capable of halting the tug-o-war 
competitions, capable of halting destruction and beginning to 
work on the genuine construction of the economy, which Ukraine 
needs today. [end recording] 
  [Tkachenko] After the parliamentary elections, now most 
interest is concentrated on whether or not the presidential 
elections will take place on 26 June. Among the opponents of 
the new electoral campaign is Kravchuk himself, some 
nationalists, and even communists. Among its active supporters 
are Leonid Kuchma and some of the leaders of the eastern and 
southern regions, and left- centrists. 
  Today, few people risk forecasting how events may develop. 
  Everyone is waiting and preparing for the middle of May, 
when 
the new Ukrainian parliament will meet for its first session.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: The New Parliament"] </F>
  [Text] The elections to the new Ukrainian parliament have 
been held. Soon, 338 people's deputies, elected as a result of 
two rounds of voting, will occupy their seats at the Supreme 
Council. Repeat elections will be held in 112 electoral 
districts. These data were quoted at a news conference on 13 
April by chairman of the Central Electoral Commission Ivan 
Yemets. 
  He said that the elections had proceeded very actively on an 
alternative basis and in acute political struggle. Broad 
openness was ensured at all stages, something that observers 
from numerous international organizations also noted. 
  Ivan Yemets briefed reporters on the party composition of 
the 
new parliament. According to tentative data, 89 deputies, 
nominated by parties, have been elected to the Supreme Council. 
The Communist Party has won the greatest number of seats -- 59. 
Rukh [Ukraine's People's Movement for Perestroyka] has 12 
representatives [in parliament] and Socialists and Republicans 
-- six seats each. However, in view of the fact that individual 
deputies were nominated by labor collectives, the political 
spectrum has a somewhat different character. More than 25 
percent of the parliamentarians are Communists, about 6 percent 
represent Rukh, 5 percent are Socialists, and 4 percent are 
representatives of the Peasants' Party. There are 169 
nonaligned deputies. As in the preceding Supreme Council, there 
are also few women in the new one -- just 12.

  [Text] Head of the Ukrainian president's domestic policy 
service Nikolay Mikhalchenko expressed hope that the Ukrainian 
parliament would after all put off presidential elections from 
26 June to a later date. "The most important thing now is to 
save the state," he told journalists during RUKH's Fifth 
Congress. 
  "If we `kill' the last authority, we'll allow both internal 
and external forces to do anything they want," he said. 
  He also said that the elections of local governments on 26 
June, in accordance with the current law, would disintegrate the 
country and lead to a federalization in its worst form. 
According to the law on local governments, the heads of the 
local councils will possess executive authority in all its 
entirety, and the institution of the president's representatives 
will be annulled. "This law was favored by the local 
bureaucrats who want to rule in the periphery," said 
Mikhalchenko. 
  Earlier, RUKH leader Vyacheslav Chernovyl had supported the 
president's proposal on putting off presidential elections to a 
later date. 
  Commenting on the agreements on economic integration within 
the CIS, signed in Moscow on 15 April, Mikhalchenko said that 
"in the absence of exact wordings, everyone is interpreting 
these agreements the way he likes." In his opinion, this is due 
to the fact that the CIS remains an association of unequal 
members.

<F P=106> ["Explanation by Ukraine's Ministry of Justice Regarding </F>
Recent Events in the Crimea" issued by the Department for Legal 
Information at Ukraine's Ministry of Justice; date not given] 
  [Text] Ukraine's Ministry of Justice has already drawn the 
public's attention to the illegal actions of Crimean President 
Yu. Meshkov. Unfortunately, not only did the high official of 
the autonomous Republic fail to embark upon the road of 
respecting the law, but he is even further intensifying his 
illegal activity. This is confirmed, in particular, by the 
following facts: On 11 April, the Crimean president, 
accompanied by a group of his bodyguards, arrived at the 
building of the Crimean Security Service, where, in the presence 
of members of its council, he announced his edicts on suspending 
from duty Crimean Security Service chairman General I.F. 
Kolomytsev and on appointing another person as acting chairman. 
He did the same at the Crimean Ministry of Internal Affairs 
with regard to Minister of Internal Affairs General O.N. Plyuta. 
  Not only are such actions on the part of the president of 
the 
Crimean Republic a blatant violation of Ukraine's legislation 
and of the international norms on human rights, but also of the 
Constitution of the Crimean Republic on the text of which he 
recently took the oath of allegiance. The Main Law of the 
Crimea (Article 129) envisages the right for the president to 
introduce proposals to the Supreme Council on the candidacy of 
the Security Service chairman. In accordance with Article 8 of 
Ukraine's Law "On the Division of Powers Among Organs of State 
Power of Ukraine and the Crimean Republic" and the Constitution 
of the Crimean Republic (Article 115, clause 13), the Crimean 
Supreme Council agrees to the appointment of the chairman of the 
Crimean Security Service only on the recommendation of the 
chairman of the Ukrainian Security Service. The appointment and 
the dismissal of this person from this post are the prerogative 
of the chairman of Ukraine's Security Service. Besides, the 
dismissal must be coordinated with the chairman of the Crimean 
Supreme Council. 
  Regarding the minister of internal affairs, in accordance 
with the Constitution of the Crimean Republic, this official may 
be appointed or dismissed only upon coordination with the 
Crimean Supreme Council. 
  The president of the Crimean Republic, in conformity with 
his 
status, must act as a guarantor of the Constitution and laws. 
However, if he opts for a different road, it will inevitably 
lead to anarchy and lack of security in society. No objective 
circumstances can justify such actions.

  [Text] Ukraine has achieved some economic stabilization and 
stepped up the pace of privatization in recent months, a 
Ukrainian representative in the EBRD (European Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development) told an annual meeting of the 
Bank's board of directors in St. Petersburg on Monday [18 April]. 
  Aleksandr Savchenko said that inflation had dropped to 8 
percent in March from more than 50 percent last December, 19 
percent in January, and 12 percent in February. 
  He put the number of state companies now in private hands at 
more than 3000 or 4 percent of the total. He said that 10 
percent of the industry had already been privatized with the 
privatization figure for the light, timber and wood processing 
industries running at 30 percent. The same indicator for the 
services sector reached 20 percent. 
  A total of 88 percent of collective farms have been 
transformed into cooperatives, partnerships and stock-holding 
companies. The number of private farms runs at 30,000. 
  At the same time, Savchenko said that nothing short of 
financial aid from EBRD, IMF and the World Bank could help Kiev 
cut its budget deficit, halt inflation and speed up the 
privatization of large enterprises. 
  He pointed to EBRD's involvement in a project to promote 
Ukrainian exports and attract private investment to develop 
Ukrainian port facilities on the Black Sea coast. The updating 
of 1200 gas pumping stations and a length of more than 2,500 km 
gas pipelines is one other possible area of cooperation, 
Savchenko said.

  [Text] Russia's Defense Minister Pavel Grachev supports the 
idea of uniting the CIS armed forces. He believes that this 
question may be discussed at the end of the year. 
  He told Interfax that after the creation of joint armed 
forces one could then talk about the formation of a CIS defense 
union. "This is something far more significant than the 
collective security agreement," he said. 
  He noted that the military tackle not only tactical but also 
strategic problems. "Our strategic future lies in a joint armed 
forces and a defense union," said Grachev.

<F P=106> [Teymuraz Mamaladze report on interview with E. Shevardnadze </F>
in Moscow "prior to his departure for Tbilisi": "Shevardnadze 
Believes that It Is Impossible to Revive the Empire"] 
  [Text] Verbal political creativity as a result of a 
shortage of information indubitably promotes meetings behind 
closed doors. Behind the scenes at the Moscow CIS summit, the 
fireworks of political neologisms have been blazing. 
  Unsuccessful attempts to bring together the presidents of 
Azerbaijan and Armenia for the long-awaited direct dialogue, the 
loud echoes of the "Odessa incident" in the poorly veiled 
squabble between the Russian and Ukrainian ministers of defense, 
and certain leaders' clear dissatisfaction with the 
Russian-Belorussian [Belarusian] agreement, which became an 
accomplished fact without their knowledge, provided grounds for 
one high-ranking figure to put into circulation a new name for 
the CIS -- "the enmity of independent states." He did not get 
any applause, however. 
  According to sources close to the delegations of the 
Commonwealth states, the atmosphere at the Moscow meeting 
differed in many ways from the previous ones -- for the better. 
Everything went without a hitch, they reported, if you did not 
count several critical utterances about some of the proposed 
documents. But looking at the content side of the meeting -- 
and this is naturally the main side -- then, according to common 
opinion, the CIS has made a significant step toward becoming a 
Commonwealth of Independent States in reality. 
  "Is this true?" I asked Georgian head of state E. 
Shevardnadze before he flew back to Tbilisi. 
  "Our meeting in Moscow," he answered, "has undoubtedly 
revealed an increasingly deepening trend toward the formation of 
new integrational ties between the independent states within the 
framework of the Commonwealth, accompanied by strict 
consideration of and respect for their national and state 
interests. In this context, I would mention the entire package 
of economic documents and the Declaration on the Observance of 
Sovereignty, Territorial Integrity, and the Inviolability of the 
Borders of the Commonwealth States." 
  "In the prevailing historical circumstances," E. 
Shevardnadze 
stressed, "the CIS is a necessity. Its flag is in no way 
reminiscent of the state symbols of the Soviet Union, nor is the 
Council of Heads of State reminiscent of the Politburo, or, as 
the Russian president expressed himself, some kind of enterprise 
board with an all-powerful, harsh director in charge. It must 
be borne in mind that we adopt all decisions by consensus, 
without any kind of pressure. As for contradictions, then these 
have appeared in the past and they will appear in the future. 
The main thing is what methods will be used to resolve them. 
According to my observations, Yeltsin does not use them to 
confirm Russia in the role of that 'director.' And to speak of 
any revival of the empire in the current conditions is simply 
frivolous. 
  "The main problem of the Commonwealth and its present and 
future," the Georgian leader believes, "is its present 
unpredictability, which in many respects stems from the 
political instability in a number of Commonwealth countries, not 
least in Russia, and also from persistent conflicts and friction 
in interstate relations. Analogies with the European Union end 
here: Its participants have also voluntarily given up part of 
their sovereignty. A powerful strengthening force is in 
operation in the European Union -- trust. The quicker this 
component is implanted in our procedures, the higher the 
international authority and prestige of the Commonwealth will be. 
  "The leaders of the states have agreed that the CIS should 
strive for international recognition, and this, apart from the 
appropriate status, also means respect for the Commonwealth as a 
real factor of peace and security. The CIS will only survive as 
an internationally recognized organization guided in its 
activity by modern norms of interstate relations."

<F P=106> [Vasiliy Kononenko report: "CIS: Politics Continues To </F>
Impede Integration"] 
  [Text] The CIS is demanding fundamental reforms, since it 
has still not proved possible to lay down common "ground rules." 
But politics is impeding economics, and that is why the 
principle chosen has been that there should be no abrupt moves 
and that an attempt should be made to improve the mechanisms for 
cooperating and resolving any disputes that arise. That was the 
main gist of the Council of Heads of State and Government 
session held in Moscow 15 April. 
  While the heads of state were meeting behind closed doors at 
the Kremlin to sort out their political differences, the 
premiers met at the President Hotel to discuss primarily 
economic problems. Key among these are the formation of the 
structures of an economic alliance and the provision of the 
legal conditions for its functioning. In all there were around 
30 points on this CIS leaders' "summit" agenda. But this 
impressive package of documents should not serve as a screen to 
hide the acute contradictions between Commonwealth members. 
These are rooted in the continuing problem of the 
redistribution of property and the fear on the part of certain 
leaders of being bound fast to the Commonwealth by means of 
compulsory decisions. 
  The most noteworthy point in this respect is the conflict 
over the division of the Black Sea Fleet and the problems 
relating to the creation of a single economic area. The latest 
conflict in Odessa over the hydrographic vessel Cheleken, and 
the Ukrainian assault troops' strong-arm actions against Russian 
servicemen show that there are as yet no forcefully effective 
mechanisms for resolving disputes in the CIS and that politics 
prevails over economic expediency. The previous day the Russian 
and Ukrainian foreign ministers had talks on this issue, but did 
not reach agreement. Admittedly, A. Zlenko told IZVESTIYA's 
correspondent that "there is hope of neutralizing this source of 
tension. It may prove possible in Moscow to eradicate the 
nervousness in relations between Ukraine and Russia [no closing 
quotation marks as published]. According to unverified 
information, there should be a meeting in the Kremlin between B. 
Yeltsin and L. Kravchuk outside the framework of the general 
heads of state meeting. In turn, Russian Defense Minister P. 
Grachev also had talks with his Ukrainian colleague, but the 
result was the same. "It has not yet proved possible to reach 
an understanding on this issue," the minister said. "I see this 
as being a seizure by force. The fact that the subunits that 
were attacked were small in number and isolated on Ukrainian 
territory was exploited. I made a resolute protest about this. 
I am hoping for a meeting between the two presidents with the 
defense ministers' participation." 
  As for the key problem (the single economic area), there too 
the principle is clear -- to cooperate but not to be compelled. 
On the eve of the opening of the summit it was decided at the 
insistence of the Turkmen delegation and, it is claimed, certain 
other countries to abandon the plan already agreed at expert 
level to set up an Interstate Economic Committee (IEC) and to 
create an Economic Community Commission. The difference is 
obvious -- the IEC presupposes the formation of a common trading 
regime binding on all, antimonopoly and customs regulation, the 
convergence of corresponding legislation, and the free movement 
of labor. The commission -- and it is being set up under the 
existing Coordination and Consultation Committee, is seen as an 
expert working organ which can only recommend similar decisions. 
Although V. Mashchits, leader of the State Committee for 
Economic Cooperation with the Commonwealth Member States, 
believes that the Heads of State Council or the Heads of 
Government Council could, if necessary, vest the commission with 
the right to make supranational decisions on specific issues. 
  A more hopeful point in the relations among the CIS 
countries 
is the agreement on the free customs zone. This document 
presupposes the gradual abolition of duties, taxes, levies, and 
quantitative restrictions on trade, the creation of a system of 
mutual accounting and payments for trade operations, and other 
things. 
  The sides reserve the right to implement state regulation 
only on issues relating to the arms trade or the trade in 
precious metals and stones or fissionable materials. The free 
customs zone agreement is seen as a transitional stage on the 
road to the creation of a customs union. 
  At the time this newspaper was being put to bed the heads of 
government had signed all the documents that had been prepared. 
They supported proposals to replenish the peacekeeping troops in 
Tajikistan and to provide material support to Kirghizia 
[Kyrgyzstan] to remedy the consequences of its natural disaster, 
and they also heard information about the work of a group which 
has been studying the question of the creation by states in the 
Transcaucasus and Central Asia of formations to safeguard their 
borders.

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow April 19 TASS -- By ITAR-TASS -- ROSSIYSKIYE 
VESTI carries an interview with Albanian Foreign Minister Alfred 
Serreci who dwells on the role of Russia in the Balkans. 
  "Russia'a presence in the Balkans is a historical fact, and 
her current involvement within the context of the development of 
events in the former Yugoslavia is realistic... Any 
constribution, including that by Russia, and aimed at 
establishing peace should be welcomed," Serreci said. 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on Russo-Ukrainian friction over the 
Black Sea Fleet: 
  "Following last year's October events, the correlation of 
forces among the political and military elites of Russia has 
long become evident. 
  "Judging by the latest developments, the Ukrainian generals 
also consolidate their positions. Do the accords reached suit 
the military and can they hinder their enactment? This is a 
rhetorical question after a series of events concerning Russia 
and ex-Soviet republics". 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA on the Black Sea Fleet: 
  "The striving of the Ukrainian side individually to divide 
the Black Sea Fleet and thereby write it off as a strategic 
operational force protecting the southern flanks of both Russia 
and Ukraine, has long become an evil tradition. 
  "Agreements which were signed by the leaders of the two 
countries in Yalta, Dagomys, Zavidovo and Massandra and which 
were intended to relieve the accumulated tension, damped the 
ardour of the Ukrainian military only for a short while, for 
they conceived an intention to have a fleet of their own, even 
if a small one, resultant of withdrawal of property from Russia. 
  "That the Black Sea Fleet together with its entire 
infrastructure is really Russian is evidenced not only by the 
Massandra protocol but also by the exclusively Russian financing 
of it since September last year". 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on Russo-Azerbaijani relations: 
  "Everything seems to indicate that that the backstage talks 
between Azerbaijani leader Geydar Aliyev and Russian officials 
did not lead to progress in discussing the possibiity of a 
Russian military presence in Azerbaijan. 
  "Moscow still failed to persuade Aliyev into allowing to 
deploy if only one Russian military base in Azerbaijan". 
  NOVAYA GAZETA runs an interview with Tajik opposition leader 
Khoji Akbar Turajonzoda, who is currently in Moscow. He said: 
"Solving the Tajik issue is the key to a settlement of the 
conflict situation in Central Asia. This means thousands upon 
thousands of human lives. 
  "We recognise the great role of Russia in resolving the 
issue 
and are confident that her geopolitical interests are aimed at 
restoring peace and stability in the region. The opposition, 
and I must say that this means a large proportion of the 
population of Tajikistan, wishes to have good-neighbourly 
relations with Russia". 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on the opposition's regaining its 
strength: 
  "Following last year's October defeat, the opposition slowly 
but steadily regains its former strength. According to 
information available to the newspaper, the second phase of the 
1st congress of the Union of Officers took place in Moscow on 
April 16 in an atmosphere of semi-secrecy. The congress was 
attended by 184 delegates, representing nine republics and 21 
regions of Russia. 
  "It seems that the death of 10 members of the Officers' 
Union 
during the defence of the parliament building in Moscow during 
the October events, a brief ban imposed on the Officers' Union, 
and the five-month stay of its leader Stanislav Terekhov (who 
was re-elected the chairman of the Officers' Union now), in the 
Lefortovo investigative isolation ward, have only added 
popularity to this officers' patriotic organisation which has 
now become one of the main centres of the unification of 
opposition forces". 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA carries an article by Colonel-General 
Mikhail 
Kolesnikov, chief of the general staff of the Russian Armed 
Forces, who pointed out: "Our principled line is to consolidate 
the Conventional Forces in Europe treaty and maintain its 
vitality. A certain adjustment of its obsolete provisions is 
necessary for that... 
  "Already now we need an utter clarity in order to choose an 
optimum configuration of Russia's defence potential and to 
prepare an appropriate infrastructure for the accommodation of 
troops. Depending on that are both the course of military 
reform, the pace of withdrawal of Russian troops to national 
territory, and other major aspects of the activities and 
development of the Russian Armed Forces." 
  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI runs an interview with Aleksandr Livshits, 
leader of a group of presidential experts. 
  Livshits is of the opinion that "Russia is now the only CIS 
state in which the population's incomes grew quicker than prices 
in the first quarter of 1994. 
  "Judging by absolute living standards, the position of 
people 
in Russia is on the whole better. In February 1994, by using 
the average monthly wage in Moscow, one could buy twice as much 
meat in Moscow as in Minsk and 32 times more than in Yerevan". 
  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI raises the question as to whether Armenia 
is threatened with a social outburst. 
  "The state of affairs in the social sphere can be described 
without any exaggeration as disastrous, not just hard. 
Following the latest indexation, the average monthly pay of 
Yerevan resident is 300 drams. One kilogramme of butter costs 
550 drams, one kg of cooked sausage -- 550 drams, sugar -- 150 
drams, one litre of vegetable oil -- 280 drams. And this is so 
at a time when the main source of permanent income for 80 
percent of the population is wage or pension". 
  PRAVDA carries an interview with Arkadiy Gukasyan, minister 
of foreign affairs of Nagorno-Karababkh, who pointed out: "There 
are several factors which explain the Karabakh phenomenon. The 
main thing is that we know what we fight for. We have nowhere 
to retreat. We have no other land. Every resident of 
Nagorno-Karabakh is aware that if he shows cowardice, the next 
day there would be neither his house nor family. 
  "We are confronted with Azerbaijanis who are forcibly 
brought 
to the frontline from Baku, Sumgait, and Kirovabad. They 
personally do not need Karabakh at all. They wait for an 
opportune moment to desert from the army. So, our successes 
should not be accounted for by Armenia's support". 
  RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA runs an interview with Mikhail Lapshin, 
chairman of the Agrarian Party of Russia. He said "the main 
thing is to stop attempts to tackle the most complex problems of 
the countryside by administrative methods so that some 
high-placed official would not sing in the heat of the moment an 
ill-considered directive... There are apprehensions on that 
score". 
  SOVETSKAYA ROSSIA carries an interview with Aman Tuleyev, 
member of the Federation Council, the upper house of the Russian 
parliament. 
  "Frankly speaking, the Yeltsin-Gaydar reforms have thrown us 
back in time to the days of feudal subsistence economy, not just 
20-30 years backwards. 
  "Wages are paid to people in our country in kind by giving 
everything from pressing irons, shoes, fabrics, tobacco products 
and even meat to medicines and spare parts for motor vehicles."

  [Text] Moscow April 18 TASS -- "The signing of an agreement 
on civic peace and accord will take place on April 28 in the St. 
George hall of the Grand Kremlin Palace," Russian presidential 
chief of staff Sergey Filatov said on Monday. In an interview 
with ITAR-TASS, Filatov said that the agreement will be signed 
by President Boris Yeltsin, the government, leaders of the State 
Duma and the Federation Council, and representatives of trade 
unions, the presidential public chamber, religious organisations 
and political movements. 
  "The agreement will remain open to all who may wish to sign 
it," Filatov added. A special conciliatory commission which 
will comprise "representatives of the president, the government, 
political parties and public movements" will oversee the 
implementation of the agreement. Filatov believes that the 
commission should use the experience of the mass media court. 
  He said there is no need to adopt the agreement on civic 
peace and accord as a federal law, but added that the parties to 
it may face possible consequences if they violate the agreement.

  [Text] Russian Vice Premier Sergey Shakhray said there was 
no alternative to the idea of national accord proposed by the 
Russian president. He stressed in an interview with an Interfax 
correspondent in Novosibirsk that this provided for real accord 
aimed at restoring the political and economic stability in 
Russia and not just for a one-time peace agreement between 
different political parties and movements. Shakhray is currently 
in Novosibirsk where he is taking part in a scientific 
conference on regional economic issues on the invitation of the 
local administration. 
  Shakhray pointed out that many political parties and 
movements, their factions in the Federal Assembly and 
representatives of the regional authorities were struggling for 
spheres of influence in Russia's energy, military-industrial and 
agrarian complexes. Shakhray believes that the president and the 
government must act as mediators in order not to let any 
political forces worsen the situation in the Russian economy. 
Shakhray emphasized that only this agreement could bring 
economic stability to Russia.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Isakov "parliamentary diary": "Accord According </F>
to Schedule"] 
  [Excerpts] Who Here Is Against Peace? 
  This is the second week in a row that the reading Russian 
public has been intensively studying the document entitled 
"Agreement on Achieving Civil Accord in Russia," which President 
Yeltsin sent to parliament. 
  The "Agreement" opens with the fresh idea that "civil accord 
is needed in Russia today as never before" and "there are no 
problems that cannot be resolved without fueling social tension 
and not resorting to violence." Although the author of the 
document has plainly become entangled in gerunds, his meaning is 
clear and cannot be disagreed with. And yet I recall that we 
had already been told with equal conviction that "Russia has 
exhausted its quota of revolutions," but then they upped and 
carried one out. "Impossible, impossible, impossible!" they 
repeat every time. The longer they repeat it, the more obvious 
it becomes: "If we want to very much, then we can!" 
  The section "Political Life of Society" speaks of the need 
to 
comply with the Constitution and the principles of democracy, a 
civil society, and the separation of powers. But protective 
motives can be glimpsed through the fence of general phrases: 
"The sides pledge to refrain from making changes to the 
Constitution which destabilize the situation" and also "not to 
initiate political campaigns for the purpose of holding 
early...elections." In return the authorities make a broad 
gesture: They pledge to reject the "uncivilized and incorrect" 
use of the mass media and to stop attaching insulting labels to 
"heroic and tragic pages of the past." 
  But is it possible to "close" the question of early 
elections 
when Russia has a president who was elected back in the Russian 
Soviet Federated Socialist Republic, who exempted himself from 
an oath to the former Constitution and did not take an oath to 
the new one, who dissolved parliament on condition that both 
branches of power would be reelected, and who, right after the 
shoot-up, went back on his word? Can such a president be 
considered a legitimate authority? Is it possible to silence 
those who demand that he stand for election again without delay 
in accordance with the proper procedure? 
  At first sight the section "Regional Policy" is extremely 
balanced. On the one hand it declares "the need to broaden the 
independence of the components of the Federation by 
strengthening the tax base," while on the other it emphasizes an 
increase in the responsibility of the organs of power of the 
components of the Federation for the collection of federal 
taxes. The warning is more than topical, since more and more 
components of the Federation -- Tatarstan, Bashkortostan, 
Karelia, Yakutia (Sakha) -- are ceasing to transfer taxes to the 
federal treasury. Today the republic budget is shrinking like 
shagreen leather and reaching ridiculous figures -- something 
like approximately 9 percent of gross domestic product. However 
you share out this sheepskin and stretch it, it obviously cannot 
"cover" science, education, culture, health care, defense, 
assistance for the countryside, and Russia's foreign economic 
obligations. 
  Foreseeing serious problems with the country's unity and 
integrity, they are trying to secure from the components of the 
Federation a "written undertaking not to leave" -- a pledge to 
renounce changing their constitutional status for two years. 
But, in addition to this, it would be a good thing to demand of 
the Moscow authorities a pledge that they will, at least, abide 
strictly by that status as it exists today. 
  In connection with the fact that the law on the principles 
of the delimitation of powers has still not been adopted, the 
federal power has solemnly promised to announce a moratorium on 
the signing of bilateral treaties on the delimitation of terms 
of reference and powers. Was it worth a wasted effort -- 
signing such a treaty with Tatarstan? What about the fact that 
advances have also been issued to a number of regions? 
  The section "Conditions and Mechanism for Fulfilling This 
Agreement" appears very surprising. For the purpose of 
monitoring compliance with the Agreement, it is proposed to form 
a Conciliation Commission from representatives of the president, 
the government, the chambers, and the State Duma factions. The 
procedure for forming the commission and its numerical 
composition have not been defined at all, and yet precisely it 
will be entrusted with determining the fact of a violation of 
the Agreement and precisely it will be empowered to use measures 
of influence against violators, even including proposals to 
dismiss them from a leading post and to lay down their powers as 
a deputy. 
  I need not cite anymore. It is already clear that the 
"Agreement" is of an extremely one-sided nature and is very 
reminiscent of the agreements between the first conquistadores 
and the ingenuous and naive indians. 
  It would be quite possible to forgive the shortcomings of 
the 
first version of the document but for another important 
circumstance. Please tell me, who now is preventing the 
president from shaping and implementing a policy of accord 
without any "agreements"? Nobody. Meanwhile, every day there 
is a new act of confrontation -- with the Constitution, with 
parliament, with society. Here are just a few examples. 
  Two weeks after the Duma adopted the amnesty decree and the 
Memorandum of Accord, S. Filatov, leader of the president's 
administration, signed a directive confirming the list of 
"disfranchised" persons -- former people's deputies of the 
Russian Federation to whom social guarantees do not extend. 
Their entire "guilt" consists in the fact that they were not 
cowardly and did not run away but fulfilled to the end their 
duty to the Constitution, as a deputy is supposed to do. As a 
result, they have been deprived of privileges, are not taken on 
for work, and are not granted a pension. They are outcasts and 
persons of no fixed abode with deputies' badges. 
  A little earlier an analytical note by P. Filippov, leader 
of 
the analytical center for socioeconomic policy, had popped up 
out of the presidential structures. In it he unequivocally 
recommended that the president embark on the compulsory 
disbandment of kolkhozes and sovkhozes. Corresponding draft 
edicts also appeared. Evidently, it never occurs to the 
president's favorite oprichnik that the kolkhozes and sovkhozes, 
which he despises, still bear the brunt of supplying the country 
with food. That on the eve of sowing it is stupid and 
shortsighted to get under a farmer's feet with such edicts. 
  Parliament has been sent a budget which demonstratively 
"forgets" the chambers of the Federal Assembly, as though they 
no longer existed. Funding for deputies' aides in the provinces 
has been ended on orders from above. And not just aides -- this 
is now the fourth month that the Duma itself, evicted from its 
legal residence, has been working in totally unadapted premises, 
surrounded by commercial structures. During this time dozens of 
guests have been inside its walls, including an ex-president of 
the United States. But the deputies have never been vouchsafed 
the honor of beholding their own president with their own eyes. 
  The questions of Russia's joining the "Partnership for 
Peace" 
program and of holding joint Russian-U.S. maneuvers on the 
Totskiy range were decided in a "spirit of peace and accord." 
They were announced without any consultation with parliament, 
despite public protests. 
  And then there is the business with Kazannik, who last week, 
yielding to brazen pressure, tendered to the Federation Council 
his resignation from the post of Russian Federation general 
prosecutor.... 
  Even the essentially secondary draft law on the procedure 
for 
publishing and validating federal laws gave rise to an acute 
juridical conflict. At first the president sent an amicable 
letter and amendments to this draft law, which the Duma 
accepted. But a week after the adoption of the law on its 
second reading he "covered" it with an edict which canceled out 
the already adopted law from the first to the last article.... 
  In short, there are more than enough examples of "accord" 
and "peaceful cooperation." "We will not allow war, but no 
stone will be left standing in the struggle for peace...." 
Immortal lines! 
<H5>  "Partnership for NATO" </H5>
  The question of Russia's joining the "Partnership for Peace" 
program is a visible example of the confusion now reigning in 
the foreign policy sphere. Discordant statements, contradictory 
speeches by high officials, which cancel each other out.... On 
top of everything -- defiant, lordly disdain for the position of 
parliament and for public opinion. 
  True, the question is far from simple. Opponents of joining 
point out that expanding NATO and bringing its zone of operation 
closer to Russia's borders is a direct violation of the 
political pledges first given to Gorbachev and then to Yeltsin 
as a condition for the speediest withdrawal of Russian troops 
from the territory of contiguous states. The troops have been 
withdrawn ahead of schedule, but the pledges...have they been 
forgotten? 
  It is perfectly obvious that the attempts to jostle Russia 
into NATO's "anteroom" place it, a Eurasian power and one of the 
initiators of the CSCE, in an ambiguous position. To all 
appearances, joining the NATO security system will put an end to 
the intention to create our own security system within the CIS 
framework. Politicians of very different trends, including 
those whom it is hard to suspect of having sympathies with 
"communofascism," unequivocally maintain that joining the 
"Partnership for Peace" program does not accord with Russia's 
international status. 
  But it cannot fail to be seen that Russia's resolute refusal 
will be perceived extremely ambivalently in the world. 
"Russia's refusal to join the program," Stephen Larrabee, a 
leading staffer of the Rand Corporation, maintains, "will be a 
watershed in the development of Russia's relations with the 
West.... Very many people in the United States will say that in 
this way Russia wants to retain a completely free hand in the 
CIS and thereby confirms its neoimperial ambitions." 
  So, two versions -- one worse than the other. It is 
legitimate to ask: How can such a thing have happened? Why has 
Russian diplomacy, which shouts from the house-tops about the 
"new Russia" and about "loyalty to democratic principles and the 
ideals of human rights," led the country to such a shameful, 
humiliating choice? 
  Let us listen to Foreign Minister Kozyrev: 
  "In the course of complex discussions we jointly arrived at 
the idea of deepening and institutionalizing cooperation with 
NATO -- an idea embodied in the `Partnership for Peace' concept 
advanced by the United States. Let us commit to memory the 
words `we' and `jointly.'" 
  But here is the opinion of U.S. politicians and forecasters 
of the Heritage Foundation. Feel the difference: 
  "In order to curb revanchist Russia, the United States must 
encourage the implementation of necessary economic and political 
reforms in the countries of central and East Europe, so that 
they can join NATO.... 
  "Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic have begun 
implementing the difficult political, economic, and military 
reforms which will be required for NATO membership. No country 
which does not wish or is not able to implement these reforms 
will be afforded the opportunity to enjoy the security 
guarantees provided by NATO. Thus, neither Ukraine, which 
possesses nuclear weapons, nor Russia, which is pursuing an 
expansionist course, can be regarded as suitable candidates for 
any membership, even formal membership, of NATO.... 
  "Russia should be allowed to become NATO's `partner,' as 
provided for in Clinton's `Partnership for Peace' program, but 
only if it continues the course of democratic market reforms." 
  Do you understand? Those who do not understand are told 
straight to their face: 
  "It is also important that Clinton's warning to Russia that 
the price of returning to dictatorship and imperialist expansion 
will be a high one should be heard." 
  This is how our "strategic partners" express themselves, 
unlike our twittering minister.... Listen, maybe Kozyrev should 
be replaced by some U.S. expert? He would hardly increase the 
size of the damage, and the benefit would certainly be greater. 
<H5>  Who Cost What, or How Much Does Democracy Cost? </H5>
  The Central Electoral Commission has submitted an official 
report, from which it can be seen that the 12 December elections 
to the Federal Assembly and the referendum on the new 
Constitution cost the country a "round sum" -- 120.7 billion 
rubles. [passage omitted] 
  In the election campaign, despite a very strict ban, 
extensive use was made of the funds of legal persons with 
foreign participation. Here are some examples of illegal 
donations ascertained by the Central Electoral Commission. 
  "Russia's Choice" 
  "Effektkredit" Joint-Stock Commercial Bank -- 3,000,000 
  "Sky Line" Russian-British Joint Venture -- 20,000,000 
  "Olbi-Diplomat" Joint-Stock Company -- 130,000,000 
  "Stolichnyy" Joint-Stock Commercial Bank -- 154,800,000 
  "Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin" Bloc 
  "Viamond LTD" Joint-Stock Company -- 30,000,000 
  "Torgovlya i Kredit" Joint-Stock Company -- 10,000,000 
  "Option" Joint-Stock Commercial Bank -- 10,000,000 
  What can you say here? Democracy is being squeezed out of 
money bags....

<F P=106> [Vladislav Borodulin report: "Group of Presidential </F>
Advisers Created. They Prefer Young Folks in the Kremlin"] 
  [Text] Aleksandr Lifshits, head of Boris Yeltsin's experts 
group, has violated the traditions of forming consultative 
councils (which used to include only academic glitterati) -- 
economists absolutely unknown to the public have become 
presidential advisers. On 15 April, the president signed an 
edict confirming the list of the group's members and rules 
guiding its work. 
  The group of experts was created a month and a half ago as a 
structural subdivision of the presidential aides service. It 
was also then that its director -- Aleksandr Lifshits -- was 
appointed. The edict that appeared last weekend set the cap on 
the group: eight persons (six experts and two secretaries), and 
defined the main areas of its work. Presidential experts in 
particular are expected to prepare proposals on the 
implementation of economic policy and to forecast consequences 
of decisions made by parliament and the government in the 
socioeconomic sphere. Mr. Lifshits stated that, in addition to 
himself, five economists, "absolutely unknown to the broad 
public," work in the group. He declined to identify them by 
name, obviously fearful of provoking a "star complex" in his 
charges. 
  At any rate, the group's personal composition is not all 
that 
important. Experts name the control function as among the 
body's more obvious ones -- in regard to parliament's and the 
government's economic creativity. Mr. Lifshits stated that he 
"dislikes the commissar function," while the body of experts 
would hardly avoid this sort of work owing to its status. In 
this sense "stars on the group of experts would even prove 
harmful -- each member would try to bring precisely his own 
opinion to the president. Besides, members of the president's 
staff do not rule out that the group was created at Sergey 
Filatov's initiative. 
  The main purport of organizing the group in this case boils 
down to creating a certain counterbalance to the State Legal 
Administration [SLA], poorly controlled by Filatov and headed by 
Ruslan Orekhov. The government, too, is interested in this -- 
its officials have long been seeing in the SLA, as Justice 
Minister Yuriy Kalmykov put it, a successor to the Politburo 
which "without permission" corrects (or even turns down) many 
departmental plans. Should this version be correct, the 
composition of the group generally loses sense -- it only 
suffices to assess the ability of the group's leader to 
influence decisions made by the president (especially in moments 
of doubt). Judging by Mr. Lifshits' rapid rise, he enjoys 
support from rather influential forces in the Kremlin. Hence he 
is in a position to influence the president.

  [Text] Moscow April 18 TASS -- A group of unidentified 
gunmen burst on Sunday into headquarters of Russia's newly-born 
Party of Scientific and Technical Intelligentsia (PNTI) and 
sprayed the ceiling with automatic gun fire from two 
Kalashnikovs, the party press service told CRIME-PRESS on 
Monday. At the same time, another group of intruders robbed a 
money exchange office which was located next door. 
  Party leader Aleksandr Krasnov is sure it was a mock 
robbery, 
since only 2,000 roubles (about one dollar) were stolen, while 
the real aim of the break-in was to scare party-members. Last 
fall, Krasnov, a scientist and former chairman of the Moscow 
Krasnopresnenskiy District Soviet, reportedly supported the 
dissolved parliament in its stand-off with President Boris 
Yeltsin.

  [Text] The only way of ending violence in the Balkans is to 
send one Russian army division to each of the five former 
Yugoslav republics and bring down any NATO warplane before it 
flies over the region, LDP [Liberal Democratic Party] leader 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy said on Monday. 
  He held out promises of an immediate peace in the Balkans, 
Georgia and Nagorno-Karabakh as soon as his party came to 
office. Zhirinovskiy, who is confident about LDP's chances of 
power, outlined plans of sending Russian crack units, now 
withdrawn from Germany, to ex-Yugoslavia. "Trainloads of troops 
will head for Belgrade instead of eastwards, there will be calm 
and quiet in the Balkans where the Russian Army will remain 
forever", he promised. 
  On Moscow's rescheduling of Russia's entry of the 
Partnership 
for Peace plan, the LDP leader accused the foreign ministry and 
President Yeltsin of procrastination saying "their decisions 
come only after thousands of people have died". 
  He is also confident that Moscow will cancel planned 
exercises with US troops in the Urals scheduled for July. The 
forthcoming event is of public concern and our people should not 
have any cause for anxiety, he said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, leader of the "Yabloko" </F>
parliamentary faction, by Ilya Smirnov; date and place of 
interview not stated: "Grigoriy Yavlinskiy: Not Walking 
Backward"] 
  [Text] State Duma Deputy Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, leader of the 
"Yabloko" parliamentary faction, advocates serious amendments to 
the reforms which are being carried out in the country, 
including the alteration of a social policy which has led to the 
impoverishment of millions of Russians. But he resolutely 
opposes attempts to return to the pre-perestroyka totalitarian 
past with its ineffective antimarket economy. That was the 
subject of my talk with Grigoriy Yavlinskiy. 
  [Smirnov] In this connection what is your attitude toward 
the program recently put forward by Academicians Abalkin and 
Shatalin? 
  [Yavlinskiy] In my view the main provisions of their program 
connected with the freezing of prices and wages are unrealistic 
and erroneous. It looks as though the reformists' blunders have 
seriously frightened the academicians. They are calling for a 
turning back. But I, on the contrary, advocate advancing toward 
the market. Naturally on condition that the necessary 
amendments are made to the erroneous course. 
  [Smirnov] Where do you see the main blunders of the reforms' 
organizers? 
  [Yavlinskiy] The strategic error of the first stage of the 
reform was the attempt instantly to replace state regulation of 
the economy with monetarist instruments for managing it, 
designed for market systems which have already taken shape and 
which have a competitive environment. As a result we acquired 
an extremely monopolized pseudomarket. And today, in an attempt 
to "dash inflation," we are essentially struggling not against 
the causes of the disease but against its consequences. 
  [Smirnov] Has Russia nonetheless any possibility left of 
emerging from the quagmire of the economic crisis and again 
occupying a fitting place in the world community? 
  [Yavlinskiy] Of course it has. And during the recent 
Federal Assembly election campaign the "Yabloko" centrist 
parties' election bloc published its program for the country's 
emergence from the crisis. In it we suggested, first, 
introducing order regarding the state's control of those spheres 
of the economy which remain in its hands. Second, STRUCTURAL 
POLICY must be oriented toward the expansion of the domestic 
market, the increase of the export of highly processed output, 
support for science-intensive sectors which ensure 
"breakthrough" technologies, support for driving sectors (for 
instance aircraft building and space, oil extraction and 
refining, the construction materials industry, and housing 
construction). Third, we must ensure the formation of a 
competitive environment and the restriction of monopolies. 
Fourth, we must review financial and monetary and credit policy 
in the interests of creating predictable macroeconomic 
conditions for enterprises and the population and also for 
reducing tax pressure on enterprises in the production sphere. 
And so forth. 
  [Smirnov] Has the government taken note of the "Yabloko" 
bloc's program? 
  [Yavlinskiy] Not so far. I judge by the draft budget which 
was recently submitted for examination by the State Duma. 
  I have the feeling that the authors of the draft were 
concerned with just one thing -- the process of extracting a 
mass of money and toughening monetary policy. At any rate very 
many questions connected with structural restructuring, with 
privatization, with support for business, with investments in 
sectors which are the driving ones for reform, and so forth, 
have not been reflected in the draft. With this budget the 
government should prepare for the solution of problems connected 
with mass bankruptcies and the growth of unemployment. 
  Attention is drawn by the combination of a very tough budget 
with high interest rates for bank credits, in excess of 200 
percent. These are virtually prohibitive rates for enterprises. 
In this connection I should like to obtain in addition to the 
draft budget another document on the main avenues of monetary 
and credit policy. In order to understand how this toughness in 
the budget will be compensated for from the viewpoint of the 
Central Bank's policy. In general it seems to me that the draft 
budget which is being examined in the Duma reflects the 
government's lack of resolve as to whether to move in one 
direction or the opposite one. Politically it satisfies neither 
the supporters of reform nor the opposition. 
  [Smirnov] And what can you say about the memorandum on 
accord proposed by the president? Does it open the way to the 
desired stability? 
  [Yavlinskiy] Serious documents of this kind could appear 
only as a result of lengthy, painstaking, and unfailingly honest 
preparatory political work. The parties and movements taking 
part in the preparation of the memorandum should have a clear 
idea of its concept and the terms of compromises, the range of 
key issues (on which the participants will agree), the legal 
force of the decisions enshrined in the document, the methods of 
monitoring them, and so forth. It seems to me this work has not 
been done. And in general I think the process of attaining civil 
accord should begin not with the signing of documents on 
universal love but with a discussion of specific problems which 
perturb society. The state budget could be the start for such 
open talk. It brings together the interests of all civil 
groups: the inhabitants of regions, entrepreneurs, servicemen, 
state enterprise and military-industrial complex workers, 
representatives of science and culture, and so forth. 
  Incidentally, we should examine the question of the 
alteration of the practice of forming the budget so that it is 
based on the holding of a "roundtable" at which representatives 
of all these groups could coordinate the basic principles of 
budget policy. If that cannot be done at the stage of 
preparation of the budget for the current year of 1994 then this 
task should undoubtedly be resolved in the interests of 
compiling the budget for 1995. 
  [Smirnov] As we know, in 1991, in an attempt to prevent our 
country's collapse, you and your comrades in the EPItsentr 
(Center for Economic and Political Studies) prepared something 
like the memorandum on accord. 
  [Yavlinskiy] Yes. In 1991 we did indeed work on a document 
of this kind, which prescribed the entire technology for 
preparing the relevant contract. The document was called "on a 
policy of social accord." In July 1991 it was published as a 
brochure. We suggested at the time that Gorbachev and Yeltsin 
conduct talks on our methods with representatives of leading 
political forces in order to avoid the country's collapse. 
Unfortunately that was not done. The leaders at the time 
engaged only in empty talk. Naturally this talking shop led to 
nothing sensible. 
  [Smirnov] A sorrowful date was marked recently -- it was six 
months since the tragic denouement of the conflict between the 
former Russian parliament and the executive power. The press 
has said a lot about how it will be impossible to achieve real 
accord in society until all those events have been investigated 
and assessed politically. Do you agree? 
  [Yavlinskiy] I do not think that in the search for civil 
accord we should make preliminary conditions of this kind. 
Although the question of a political assessment of last 
October's events is extremely important. The Duma "Yabloko" 
faction firmly advocates the creation of a parliamentary 
commission to investigate and sum up politically the events of 
21 September through 4 October 1993. 
  Only an independent parliamentary commission will be able to 
determine the real political guilt of those who bring the 
country to cataclysms and thus protect society from such figures 
in the future. Russia is no place for permanent coups d'etat. 
Even if they are carried out under the flag of reforms. That 
is why our faction believes the Duma's abolition of this 
commission in adopting documents in February on the amnesty was 
an erroneous and dishonest action with regard to Russia's 
citizens. I am convinced that the outcome of the parliamentary 
commission case was decided by the fact that in Russian politics 
today there are too many people who have an extreme lack of 
interest in objective investigation. This amnesty adopted by 
the Duma in February was being sought covertly or openly 
primarily by those guilty of the bloodshed. It is clear that 
these people were on both sides in those tragic days. 
  [Smirnov] And one last question. Are you not perturbed by 
the fact that because of economic and political instability it 
will be hard for us to count on foreign aid in the foreseeable 
future? 
  [Yavlinskiy] I am not. I am profoundly convinced that no 
one will be able to buy a market economy, a democracy, or a 
proper living standard for Russia. We will have to achieve all 
this through our own labor.

"FITUR: Criticism from Left and Right"] 
  [Text] An all-Russia conference of trade union committee 
chairmen has been held at the FITUR [Federation of Independent 
Trade Unions of Russia]. Those who are directly responsible for 
resolving the socioeconomic problems of labor collectives 
gathered for the representative forum. 
  Analyzing the working people's present situation, the trade 
union leaders attempted to formulate a unified strategy to 
protect the working people's interests. All the speakers 
emphasized that this can be achieved only by pooling the efforts 
of all trade union organizations. At the conference there was 
criticism of the FITUR leadership and accusations of its 
excessive politeness [loyalnost] in relations with power 
structures. 
  Representatives of Working Moscow set up their picket 
outside 
the FITUR building yesterday. The pickets accuse the FITUR 
leadership of infringing the working people's interests with the 
General Agreement between the government, employers, and trade 
unions, which they signed recently.

  [Text] The founding congress of Russia's Great Power Party 
took place at the Lesnoy Gorodok holiday home in the Moscow 
countryside on Sunday. It endorsed the party's program and 
rules and elected the central bodies. The leader of the 
Officers Union Stanislav Terekhov was elected chairman of the 
party. 
  Last February, Lieutenant-Colonel Terekhov was released from 
the Matrosskaya Tishina prison on an amnesty declared by the 
Duma for all participants in the events in Moscow in 
September-October, 1993. Military investigators claim that he 
led an attack on the CIS Army Headquarters in late September, 
1993, as a result of which a policeman and an elderly woman were 
killed. Addressing the congress, Terekhov declared that his 
party would work to revive Russia and its armed forces 
spiritually and patriotically. The party intends to interact 
with left-wing communist parties and the Russian Orthodox 
Church, he said.

<F P=106> [Irina Savvateyeva article: "Chernomyrdin's Team -- the </F>
Internal Political Scene"] 
  [Text] Sovereign Vassal on Road to Presidency 
  Relations between the present Cabinet of Ministers and the 
president and his apparatus are fairly complex. At first, the 
presidential structure rose up to dizzy heights, whereas the 
government's position was one of subordination. These were the 
relations of vassal and sovereign, which, however, even then 
were not the relations of slave and slaveholder. A vassal had 
the right to fight for his independence and autonomy, as well as 
for their subsequent expansion. Which is what Viktor 
Chernomyrdin became involved in when he started forming "his 
own" government. 
  As a result, the government structure became more firmly 
established. Admittedly, certain observers still give it a 
subservient role, pointing out that the president controls the 
activity of the "power" ministries and also has the right to 
intervene in financial and economic policy if the threat of 
hyperinflation arises. However, others are inclined to believe 
that in terms of its power and strength of influence, the 
government is not at all inferior to the president's 
administration. And in terms of organization and effectiveness, 
is even ahead of it. 
  By and large, according to certain observers, the place and 
role of the Russian Government in the country's political life 
are today predetermined by the future battles for the post of 
president. And also by the fact that the leader of the 
government is the No. 1 candidate for the post of head of state. 
In short, this is a government whose main function is to help 
the premier to become president. 
  Meanwhile, it is advantageous for the current president to 
play along with future contender for the presidency. 
  So Yeltsin has moved aside, handed the economy to 
Chernomyrdin, and is now observing what will happen next. If, 
contrary to expectation, Viktor Stepanovich manages to hold the 
country on the brink of hyperinflation, Boris Nikolayevich will 
be interested in having him as his successor. As a man who 
maintained personal loyalty. 
  And it is also in the premier's interests to play along with 
with Yeltsin: Chernomyrdin needs Yeltsin even more than Yeltsin 
needs him. If it proves possible to rescue the economy, the 
premier will simply prove to be "doomed" to become president. 
So that Chernomyrdin's task in the present conditions is 
utterly clear: to sit out Yeltsin's tenure, trying not to make 
any sharp movements, and to support Yeltsin without doing a deal 
with him. 
<H5>  Government-Parliament </H5>
  As for relations between the government and the parliament, 
these are still at the formative stage. However, confrontation 
between the two bodies is already fairly discernible. The 
government is trying to do all it can to deprive the Federal 
Assembly of even a hint of autonomy in the question of material 
wealth. Meanwhile, virtually all the parliament's material 
backup is under the control of the president's administration. 
And in many respects this fact determines the relations between 
the legislature and the executive. 
  For the time being, the parliamentary opposition has been 
behaving very carefully -- with the government too. The 
discussion of the budget proposed by Chernomyrdin has begun 
surprisingly peacefully. The lessons of October have evidently 
not been forgotten. Furthermore, in the present situation it is 
advantageous for the legislators to distance themselves from the 
government's economy policy. And to act on the basis of the 
principle: Let things happen as they happen, and we will 
criticize quietly. At the same time, a number of potential 
candidates for the presidency, making use of the Duma platform, 
are waiting impatiently for this government to ruin the economy 
and bring itself down. 
  However, the majority of Duma factions have a fairly loyal 
attitude toward the government. Thanks to Aleksandr Zaveryukha, 
Chernomyrdin has found a common language with the communists, 
the agrarians and the "Women of Russia" -- he is close to them 
in spirit. Boris Fedorov was profoundly wrong when he sought 
Zaveryukha's dismissal: In any other circumstances the premier 
would not have parted for anything with a man who allowed him to 
control a significant part of the parliamentary opposition. 
  "Russia's Choice" and the "12 December" group will be forced 
to support Chernomyrdin on the basis of gloomy considerations: 
"Or else things will get even worse." 
  And as for the Party of Russian Unity and Accord, it -- 
following the elevation of both its leaders to the rank of vice 
premier -- is quite simply a government party. However, 
observers note: It is only the unifiers and the compromisers 
who consider themselves to be Chernomyrdin's party. He just 
allows them to support him, but prefers not to pay them back for 
this. Unless with posts of vice premier. 
<H5>  Chernomyrdin's Team: Characters and Performers </H5>
  Viktor Stepanovich likes to repeat at every convenient 
opportunity that the current Russian Government is a coalition 
government. In actual fact there can be no question of a 
coalition government. In practical terms only one team -- 
Chernomyrdin's team -- is on the field of play. 
  Chernomyrdin inherited an extremely mixed cabinet at the end 
of 1992. It included Yeltsin's men: Lobov, Shumeyko, Shakhray. 
And the fragments of Gaydar's team: Chubays, Pamfilova, and 
also Shokhin at that time. Then Gaydar himself appeared too. 
Fedorov -- a team in himself -- was also here. 
  At that time, Yeltsin protege Oleg Lobov presented the 
greatest danger for the new premier -- he was urgently trying to 
reform the Ministry of the Economy a la Gosplan and to lay his 
hands on economic policy. Chernomyrdin dealt with him first. 
Another first vice premier, Oleg Soskovets, who had previously 
vegetated in the post of vice premier of an almost foreign 
country -- Kazakhstan -- was brought in to counterbalance First 
Vice Premier Lobov. Chernomyrdin almost begged Yeltsin for 
permission to bring just one of his own men into the government. 
The request looked entirely proper. After all, the new premier 
did not bring in with him any potentially dangerous 
representatives of the extremely powerful oil and gas lobby, 
which would doubtless have been assessed as outright 
protectionism. 
  At the same time, it should not be forgotten that 
Soskovets's 
candidacy emerged on Chubays' initiative. And at first the new 
vice premier was fairly close to the representatives of those 
who were called reformers in the government, and he supported 
their policy. Suffice it to say that thanks primarily to 
Soskovets the price of coal was deregulated. All this fully 
suited Yeltsin. It was said that the president gave the new 
vice premier certain signs of attention and even made certain 
overtures toward him. 
  The premier tolerated this for a while. For him enemy No. 1 
was Lobov. In the end, Yeltsin's overzealous protege in terms 
of Gosplan-style reformism was nevertheless finished off. Not 
without the help of the government promarket lobby and the 
democratic press. Thereupon he was removed from the economy, 
but entirely decorously and honorably: He was unloaded into the 
Security Council. 
  At a different time, but also entirely decorously, Yeltsin's 
remaining men were removed from the government. Shumeyko found 
himself in the Federation Council, not least thanks to the 
efforts of Chernomyrdin and Soskovets, who had done some good 
work with the deputies. But they did not remove Shakhray, or 
Shokhin either. These men simply left the teams in which they 
had started their political game and became full members of 
Chernomyrdin's team. 
  Incidentally, one story is that Shokhin was elevated so as 
to 
counterbalance Soskovets, who was casting glances here and there 
and who was thus told: Man proposes, God disposes. That is, 
the premier disposes. And by and large, the elevation of 
Shokhin is a highly successful acquisition for Chernomyrdin and 
Kvasov. Appointed to "Gaydar's post," that is, the post of the 
person responsible for economic policy and reforms -- the 
professor and doctor of economic sciences is very good for 
diluting the strictly technological company of typical sector 
workers. And furthermore, he symbolizes a representative of the 
first draft of reformers, which is very convenient for the 
premier. 
  And as for the so-called radical promarket lobby, 
Chernomyrdin dealt with them after October 1993, once he had 
perceived his own strength. Strictly speaking, no one chased 
Gaydar, Fedorov, and Pamfilova out of the government. All were 
offered posts. But, being young and ambitious, -- and that is 
precisely the reason for what happened -- they went too far; the 
posts no longer suited them, you see, and they wanted to dictate 
terms. 
  Meanwhile, analysis of Chernomyrdin's cabinet's subsequent 
economic policy brings to mind the fact that the reason for 
Fedorov and Gaydar's departure was by no means fundamental 
differences of opinion with the premier in terms of views of the 
course of economic reforms. Judging by the 
Chernomyrdin-approved expenditure in the 1994 budget, Viktor 
Stepanovich turned out to be no less tough a "monetarist" than 
those from whom he had distanced himself. It is just that the 
premier evidently prefers to have one center in the government 
from which all decisions are initiated. 
  As a result, the government formed by Chernomyrdin assumed a 
completely organic character. It is headed by a single leader, 
respected and recognized by all his subordinates. He is not 
without charisma either: He knows how to say things in such a 
way that people listen to him and receive things at a 
psychological and emotional level. Following the memorable 
speech uttered at the enlarged government session which 
mentioned heads of laboratories and the racing car, Chernomyrdin 
will even be forgiven for the tough budget. For the time being, 
of course. 
  All decisions in the government are adopted exclusively by 
the premier. Or more precisely, by the Chernomyrdin-Kvasov duo. 
The leader of the apparatus -- the second man in the government 
-- has enormous power. Not one piece of paper is placed on 
Viktor Stepanovich's desk without his knowledge. 
  Vladimir Kvasov has worked with Chernomyrdin for many years. 
He has always been a retinue figure: chief of office, 
assistant, leader of the apparatus.... In short, an eminence 
grise. The premier trusts Kvasov completely. And the latter 
knows all the ins and outs of apparatus reshuffles and 
skillfully conducts a cadre policy that is advantageous to the 
premier. Whoever Kvasov recommends, that person is taken on. 
The only exception has been Anatoliy Chubays. 
<H5>  Foreign Body </H5>
  Today Chubays is the only man in Chernomyrdin's government 
who is not on Chernomyrdin's team. Appointed directly by the 
president over and above the approved vice premier TO, Chubays 
is in this government only until check privatization is 
completed. What then? 
  Chernomyrdin will most likely try to get rid of him. It is 
said that he has already attempted to remove two deputy chairman 
of the State Committee for the Management of State Property 
[Goskomimushchestvo] -- Vasilyev and Mostovoy -- and put his own 
people in the posts in order to thus "neutralize" the head of 
the department. This did not work out, however. Chubays proved 
to be a tough nut, and Chernomyrdin and Kvasov broke their teeth 
on him. 
  But they will scarcely tolerate him for long. The chairman 
of Goskomimushchestvo is too bright a figure, he is too 
promising and ambitious a politician. You need an iron grip to 
hold on for two years to the process of the division of property 
in the vast Russian state and to bring this division to a 
logical conclusion (and it is all going that way). And so 
(particularly in Chernomyrdin's eyes) Chubays is the only person 
in the government after the premier who has a certain amount of 
influence on the president. 
  Obviously, the future of the Goskomimushchestvo chairman 
depends on the president's political fate. However, Chubays is 
capable of standing up for himself. Today his department is 
fighting with all its might to strengthen its positions in the 
postprivatization process. If Goskomimushchestvo succeeds in 
taking enterprise bankruptcies and economic revival under its 
control, then Chubays' influential position in the government 
will be secure. However, even today the Ministry of the Economy 
is disputing these functions with Goskomimushchestvo. No doubt 
the full might of the government apparatus will stand behind 
Shokhin in this conflict. 
<H5>  Lobbyists in the Government: Who Wins? </H5>
  One of the most powerful lobbies -- the oil and gas lobby -- 
is represented in the government by the premier himself. To a 
significant extent the oil and gas workers form the budget. And 
what is also important is that they have their own finances 
which they can use. That is probably why Chernomyrdin is 
seeking to prevent his potentially influential old friends from 
Gazprom getting too close. 
  But it is the agrarians who are the most active today in 
obtaining money for themselves, because they are able to apply 
pressure at all levels: in the government, in the Duma, and 
through the mass media. This lobby is also strong in that it 
has easy access to the premier through its protege Aleksandr 
Zaveryukha. 
  Oleg Soskovets, who in his time has worked both at the 
Karaganda Metallurgical Combine and in the post of USSR minister 
of nonferrous metallurgy, represents the interests of the 
"coal-metal" bloc lobbyists. The defense industry workers have 
also recently slipped under the Soskovets wing, inasmuch as they 
do not have a single serious figure in the government by way of 
their own direct spokesman. The military-industrial complex 
lobby is generally one of the weakest. The attitude toward 
defense industry workers is one of sympathy, but without the due 
respect. This is yet again confirmed by the fact that during 
the formation of the 1994 budget the spokesmen for the 
military-industrial complex failed to obtain an additional 
morsel at the expense of other sectors. 
  Obviously, all the aforesaid lobbies, as well as their 
spokesmen, are doomed to constant confrontation with each other 
amid the struggle for survival. 
  This situation suits Chernomyrdin as a politician and as 
supreme arbiter. The state of confrontation will neither allow 
one specific leader to become stronger or several to cobble 
together a stable anti-premier coalition. For instance, in the 
fight against increased prices of fuel and energy complex output 
Soskovets and Zaveryukha could constitute a fairly powerful 
alliance. But this alliance would never stand the test of the 
division of the budget pie. 
  In this context, Chernomyrdin's desire to keep Acting 
Minister of Finance Sergey Dubinin in a state of suspension 
seems entirely sensible. After all, the person who hands out 
the money has considerable influence on the disposition of 
forces in the political arena. Last year Boris Fedorov was this 
man, and this could not have particularly pleased Chernomyrdin. 
Now this man is indubitably the premier himself; he is in 
complete control of the Ministry of Finance. 
  As for the regional elites, these do not have any recognized 
lobbyists in Chernomyrdin's government at the moment. Maybe 
some of them are still inclined to back Shakhray. But, if they 
want to achieve something, the majority of local leaders resort 
to pooling their own efforts. Or they quite successfully go to 
the president in secret. 
  But the premier himself possibly monitors the moods of the 
territories through his vice premier, Yuriy Yarov. Yarov has 
been involved in party and soviet work for years. In 
Chernomyrdin's government he is formally responsible for social 
policy, but at the same time he conducts all kinds of closed 
talks with the regions. Obviously, Chernomyrdin has reason to 
trust this taciturn and complaisant deputy more than Sergey 
Shakhray with his indefatigable political ambitions and 
pro-Yeltsin past. 
  However, Yarov was probably appointed to the post of vice 
premier not least thanks to the curious fact that he ran for 
deputy from the "Russia's Choice" bloc. And thereby gave the 
premier who elevated him the possibility of maintaining the 
illusion of a coalition government.

<F P=106> [Letter from ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA editor N. Polezhayeva to </F>
Moscow Prosecutor G.S. Ponomarev: "Witness' Testimony"] 
  [Text] I, Natalya Ivanovna Polezhayeva, chief editor of 
ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA, have received a summons from the Moscow 
prosecutor's office demanding that I appear before investigator 
Leontyeva for questioning as a witness. I know very well I have 
not witnessed any crime and so I naturally asked Mikhail 
Ivanovich Slinko, chief of the department for the investigation 
of banditry, in what connection and on what basis I was being 
summoned. 
  It turned out it was in connection with the 12 April 
publication in ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA of the article "Between the 
Criminals and the Bureaucrats.... Who Needed Otari 
Kvantrishvili's Death?" They wanted to find out from me the 
name of the author and the source of the information. 
  I do not think that interrogation is needed for these 
questions. An official request was enough, which had been 
suggested. But M.I. Slinko, citing some article in the Criminal 
Code, promised to draw up a compulsory court attendance order. 
  In order not to waste my own working time nor that of the 
prosecutor's office workers, I have taken the liberty of 
printing my testimony in the newspaper. 
  In accordance with article 41 of the Russian Federation law 
"On the Mass Media," "the editorial office is obliged to keep 
secret its source of information and does not have the right to 
name a person supplying information on condition he is not 
named, except for a case when relevant demand has come from a 
court in connection with a case with which it is dealing." 
  In this case the author made anonymity a condition for the 
purposes of his own safety. In this connection I cannot give 
the author's name or the source of the information. But I 
assure you it was obtained from officials of the Ministry of 
Internal Affairs and the editorial office has no doubts about it.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report in the VEKHI section: "Boris Yeltsin's </F>
New Book"] 
  [Text] Boris Yeltsin's new book "A President's Notes" 
[Zapiski Prezidenta] will appear in the bookstores in Russia and 
in more than 30 other countries in May. 
  "This is a large book," Lev Gushchin, the chief editor, 
stressed, "with over 400 pages and 100 color photographs. It is 
written in the form of the president's personal diary and covers 
the events from the dramatic August of 1991 to the tragic 
October of 1993. Descriptions of the events are interspersed in 
the book with Boris Nikolayevich's reflections on the paths of 
Russia's development and transformation, portraits of political 
figures and those people with whose lives the country's destiny 
became interlinked at that difficult period." 
  "It would be no mistake," Lev Gushchin noted, "to say that 
the many facts and assessments contained in the book are really 
sensational and that many of the riddles and mysteries of recent 
years are logically answered here. But to be frank it is the 
tone the `Notes' which is most impressive. This is perhaps the 
first time that we have encountered a text which is so personal, 
candid, and at times merciless toward the author and others, a 
text penned by a member of the country's top leadership."

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Ivanova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow April 18 TASS -- Former Soviet President 
Mikhail Gorbachev compared his "perestroyka" which was aimed to 
reform the Soviet totalitarian system to the liberalisation of 
his predecessor Nikita Khrushchev, often called as the "thaw", 
which exposed and condemned the personality cult of Joseph 
Stalin and introduced limited freedom in the country. Gorbachev 
also admitted that he knew he could be ousted like Khrushchev. 
Khrushchev was toppled in 1964 after his reformist plans caused 
a major opposition from hard-line communist party nomenklatura. 
  "We remembered the experience of Khrushchev, but we 
underestimated the reactionary forces of the past", Gorbachev 
said addressing a conference devoted to the 100th birth 
anniversary of Khrushchev which opened in the Gorbachev 
Foundation on Monday. He added that yet in 1987, two years 
after perestroyka began, "the people who started the 
transformations realised that the fate of Khrushchev was in 
store for them". Gorbachev had to step down after his communist 
elite staged a coup against him in August 1991 which resulted in 
the collapse of the Soviet Union. 
  The former Soviet leader stressed that Khrushchev had a 
great 
influence on all the Soviet reformers. He compared his 
perestroyka to Khrushchev's "thaw" and said that the latter 
failed because the new policy was implemented by old methods. 
"Problems of immense historic importance cannot be solved by 
Bolshevik methods", Gorbachev said.

<F P=106> [Boris Slavin report: "Fight for Khrushchev's Legacy"] </F>
  [Text] Tomorrow is the centenary of the birth of Nikita 
Sergeyevich Khrushchev, the famous reformer of socialism. The 
positive significance of his activity is growing as people 
become more aware of the socioeconomic catastrophe which Russia 
is experiencing today because of the destructive work of the 
so-called democrats. 
  In order to camouflage and justify the "fruits" of this 
work, 
they are turning to history. Thus, at a conference yesterday in 
the Hall of Columns, they tried to find appropriate analogies 
and parallels with N.S. Khrushchev's activity for themselves. 
Opening the conference, G.Kh. Popov, appealing for objectivity 
in the assessment of this historical figure, stated straight 
away: "Khrushchev was a distant relation of our transformations." 
  However, the main "reassessor" was the unsinkable former 
CPSU 
ideologist, now the ideological mentor of the "democrats," A.N. 
Yakovlev. In his report, he first called Khrushchev "the 
Bolshevik Aleksandr II," and then the forerunner of the 
contemporary "spiritual breakthrough." Admittedly, as usual it 
was hard to grasp the main idea of the report. But there was 
one. And it consisted in presenting Khrushchev as a Utopist who 
was hoping to reform the essentially unreformable socialist 
system. 
  However, the interesting thing is not what Yakovlev said 
about Khrushchev, but what he did not say. And he did not say 
that unlike the current democrats, Khrushchev was a genuine 
people's socialist. This man with a peasant's face built homes 
for the people, created a structured system for the provision of 
state pensions, helped launch the first man into space, and 
averted the aggression against socialist Cuba. Of course, 
Khrushchev was a multifaceted figure in history. Popular memory 
will preserve his corn-planting campaigns, and his desire to 
build communism and "bury capitalism" in 20 years, but 
nevertheless, this man was a creator rather than a destroyer. 
  Stalinists and democrats are united in their desire to turn 
Khrushchev into the digger of socialism's grave, but they will 
not succeed. Khrushchev will remain in people's awareness as a 
genuine democrat who dreamed of really giving socialism back its 
human face. And sooner or later this dream will come true.

  [Text] The total reduction in the population of North 
Siberia through migration will be over 600,000 by early 1996 and 
over 550,000 over 1996-2000. That is the forecast of a group of 
Novosibirsk scientists. 
  The migration is caused primarily by the reduction in the 
demand for manpower in connection with the reduction in oil and 
gas extraction and a marked reduction in capital investments in 
the extracting sectors. Among those leaving the North a 
considerable proportion are citizens of nearby foreign parts 
returning home. The intensive departure of highly qualified 
specialists and young people has been noted. 
  The migration of the population from northern regions also 
has positive consequences. People's departure is lowering the 
level of unemployment and reducing the load on the socioconsumer 
infrastructure. But scientists note that spontaneous migration 
will not radically resolve the question of the overpopulation of 
North Siberia. A considered state policy is needed in this 
process.

<F P=106> [Unnamed ITAR-TASS correspondent report: "Fewer and Fewer </F>
Children. We Are Getting Old"] 
  [Text] In 1993 the country's population fell by 300,000, 
and 1 million fewer Russians were born than in 1992. If this 
trend persists, the population of the Russian Federation will 
have halved in 50 years' time. And half of the country's 
inhabitants will be pensioners. An ITAR-TASS correspondent was 
told this at the Russian Academy of Sciences' Sociopolitical 
Research Institute. 
  Steady depopulation has been recorded in 68 regions, which 
are home to 93 percent of the entire population. Natural growth 
persists in the republics of the North Caucasus, Kalmykia, the 
Altay, Tuva, Yakutia, Chukotka, and in Tyumen and Chita Oblasts. 
This depopulation is the result not only of a wholesale fall in 
the birth rate, but of increased mortality. Life expectancy has 
fallen by 18 months; in the period 1989-1993 it fell by 0.7 of a 
year for women and by 2.2 years for men. A special feature of 
the situation in Russia is the unusually high death rate from 
accidents, poisonings, and injury. Average life expectancy for 
Russian men is 62; women outlive them by almost 12 years. 
  The scale and nature of this phenomenon require not just the 
stating of the fact, but direct state intervention.

<F P=106> [Valeriy Yakov report: "Staffers of the `Vympel' Group Are </F>
Together Again"] 
  [Text] The process of the transfer to the Ministry of 
Internal Affairs of the facilities, the hardware, the armament, 
and what little remained of the personnel of the former "Vympel" 
special group has been completed (IZVESTIYA has written of this 
twice recently -- Nos. 34 and 41). The unusual subunit has 
ceased to exist in its former capacity, and its staffers have 
ended up under various "roofs." So as not to lose the ties, the 
mutual understanding built up over the years, and the mutual 
assistance, the group's officers have decided to reunite. 
  The initiative has come mainly from those who have retired 
and who are filling out their pension documents. They have 
proposed setting up the Fund for the Social Protection of 
"Vympel" Group Staffers and inviting to participate in the fund 
all who have ever served in this subunit. The idea has been 
supported by many "Vympel" staffers, including those who have 
gone to serve in other structures. The founding document has 
been registered in accordance with the procedure laid down, and 
a search is now being conducted for premises to house the 
headquarters. On learning of the fund's creation, some firms 
and organizations at once started offering their services -- 
with premises and transport. But the "Vympel" staffers are in 
no hurry to make their choice. 
  Nor are they as yet entirely clear about their future 
commercial activity. Everyone realizes right from the start 
that it will be necessary to earn money, and nobody in the fund 
entertains any illusions that some sponsor will give selfless 
assistance. One small thing is lacking -- a decision on how 
they can earn money. 
  The special group's former staffers intend initially to 
provide consultative services to respectable commercial 
organizations and state structures, suggesting how best to guard 
themselves against industrial and economic espionage and 
terrorist activity. They will also be able to indicate 
vulnerable points in the already developed systems of security 
measures of any firms and organizations and to make 
recommendations on methods for checking out future partners, 
including foreign ones. 
  The group's former staffers intend to use the funds earned 
to 
support the families of their comrades who died in Afghanistan, 
for those injured while fulfilling various assignments, and for 
all "Vympel" veterans who need assistance. 
  The creation of the fund has hardly been publicized 
anywhere, 
but this idea has created obvious alarm and displeasure in 
certain high offices. And this, I believe, is perfectly 
explicable -- all the conditions for the breakup of the group 
were not brought about merely so that its staffers might once 
again come together in a single team which would no longer be 
subordinate to anyone and would live according to its own 
regulations.

  [Text] Vladivostok, 19 Apr (TASS] -- The liquid 
radioactive waste from Russian Pacific Fleet submarines may be 
dumped in the Sea of Japan, because it can't be disposed of 
otherwise at present. Tankers, anchored at the moorings of 
"Zvezda" works, are filled up to the rim with the waste and 
cannot take new deliveries of the dangerous shipment. This was 
stated today to an ITAR-TASS correspondent by Vladimir 
Ignatenko, the Russian presidential representative in the 
Maritime Kray. 
  He said that the government should have allocated funds for 
building a waste processing installation. However, not a single 
ruble has been earmarked for this purpose as yet. In the 
meantime, one tanker with 794 tonnes of waste on board urgently 
needs repairing. So, one should either stop the works, in order 
to [word indistinct] the already critical mass of the 
radioactive liquid accumulated here, or dump the liquid in the 
sea. But this can't happen unless agreed by the Russian 
president, Vladimir Ignatenko said.

  [Text] Moscow April 18 ITAR-TASS -- The area of the Sea of 
Japan in which the Russian Pacific Fleet dumped some of its 
radioactive wastes does not show above-normal levels of 
radioactivity, according to preliminary data released by a joint 
Russian-japanese-South Korean expedition which just finished 
studying the area. 
  Russian Naval Captain Gennadiy Vorobyev, deputy head of the 
radiation and chemical security department, told ITAR-TASS on 
Monday that during the month-long expedition, Russian, Japanese 
and South Korean scientists took samples of sea water from their 
base onboard the research ship "Okean", which belongs to the 
Russian federal hydrometeorology and environmental monitoring 
service. 
  The expedition's work was prompted by the worries of several 
countries in the region that the dumping of radioactive 
materials in the Sea of Japan by the Russian Pacific Fleet in 
October, 1993, might lead to higher radiation levels.

<F P=106> [Dmitriy Kholodov report: "The Secret of the President's </F>
Safe. `Tanks Advance by Two to Three Men'"] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] As MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS has 
learned from reliable sources, a new military reform plan is 
already lying in the president's safe. In this context, 
military experts suppose that in the very near future the 
question of separating the Defense Ministry from the General 
Staff will be raised again. There are also indications that the 
plan provides for the creation of a powerful ideological body 
like the old Main Personnel Directorate [Glavpur]. Former 
presidential military adviser Gen. Volkogonov and Gen. 
Vladimirov, the Yeltsin team's main analyst on military affairs, 
are cited among the document's authors. 
  The new plan has been attributed such a high security 
classification (a stamp saying, "Burn before reading" [as 
published] that even some members of the Security Council do not 
know about it yet. Still, signs are that many do not know how 
current reforms are proceeding in the army either. 
  Even people in the Defense Ministry itself do not know. 
Generals from the Defense Ministry, who only a month ago were 
talking about a "phased" reform plan, are now reminiscent of 
hedgehogs wandering in the fog [reference to a popular animated 
cartoon]. Now the Defense Ministry discusses the disbandment of 
the Baltic Fleet, ruling to preserve it. Now they effectively 
abolish the Air Defense Force, having the public believe that 
the troops will remain. It is also reported that the main 
commands will be abolished, for instance the Main Ground Force 
Command. In brief, as has always been the case with military 
strategists, "tanks advance by two to three men." 
  Gen. Vladimirov, whom we asked to comment on the rumor about 
the new reform plan, confirmed that "conceptually, no one 
understands which reform the Defense Ministry is now pursuing." 
He is convinced that the ministry should be separated from the 
General Staff. In Russia, frequent changes of government and 
therefore defense ministers are simply inevitable. According to 
Aleksandr Vladimirov, the army must be safeguarded from this 
leapfrog approach, and the General Staff given the right to 
issue orders directly to the troops.

  [Text] Chairman of the Russian government Viktor 
Chernomyrdin completed a two day working trip to St. Petersburg 
where he delivered a speech at an annual meeting of the EBRD 
Council of Managers and visited a number of enterprises. 
  On Monday Chernomyrdin visited one of the major joint-stock 
enterprises in St.Petersburg -- the Kirov plant. Near the plant 
he was met by a picket organized by the local independent trade 
union, whose participants demanded that the plant be able to 
work without interruption. As Interfax learned at the managing 
board of the plant, the Kirov plant has not been working full 
working weeks, and in some workshops there are cases of delayed 
payment of wages. 
  At a meeting with plant officials Chernomyrdin promised to 
grant financial aid to the Kirov plant and supported plans of 
the directorate to launch production of modern equipment for 
gas-pumping stations on the basis of German technology, as well 
as equipment for gas and steam-turbine electric power stations. 
  Chernomyrdin suggested that plant officials consider 
producing a new modern bus meeting Russian requirements in 
cooperation with the KAMAZ automobile maker. On Monday evening 
Chernomyrdin will return to Moscow.

  [Text] St. Petersburg April 18 TASS -- "The holding of the 
third session of the board of governors of the European Bank of 
Reconstruction and Development in St. Petersburg has enabled the 
bankers and financists from all over the world to see that the 
process of economic and political reforms in Russia is 
irreversible," Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin told 
ITAR-TASS on the eve of his departure by plane to Moscow. 
  He expressed hope that after Western investors familiarized 
themselves with the situation in Russia and talked with Russian 
financists, entrepreneurs, they would boldly enter the Russian 
market. 
  According to Chernomyrdin, St. Petersburg may be a center of 
banking and tourism. The prime minister met with St. Petersburg 
Mayor Anatoliy Sobchak to discuss investments, easy taxation, 
subway construction, repairs of the bridges and social aspects. 
When commenting on his visit to the Kirovsky Works joint stock 
company, Chernomyrdin described as "intolerable" the fact that 
qualified workers had to spend two or three months on "forced" 
vacation. 
  "This is what hidden unemployment is about. The works has 
turned out machinery, but Kazakhstan will not buy it. It has 
developed and is now ready to produce mining and gas-extracting 
equipment, but it lacks funding. The works is prepared to turn 
out buses, which are in high demand both in the city and the 
country. Within the next few weeks, the Russian Government will 
consider the relevant issues and (take care) to enable such a 
giant as the Kirovsky Works to function to the best of its 
capacities by taking the course of conversion," concluded the 
prime minister.

  [Text] St. Petersburg, 18 Apr -- "It may be confidently 
asserted today that mass privatization in Russia will be 
completed by 30 June and, moreover, it will be completed 
successfully," Anatoliy Chubays, vice-premier and chairman of 
the State Committee for the Management of State Property 
[Goskomimushchestvo], said. He was speaking at a news conference 
which was part of the third annual sitting of the board of 
governors of the European Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development which opened in the Taurida Palace today. 
  The vice-premier cited a number of figures to corroborate 
his 
optimistic forecast. According to data from the state property 
committee, more than 50 percent of the gross national product is 
currently being produced by the non-state sector. By 1 July, 70 
percent of industrial enterprises will be in the hands of 
private individuals, predominantly in the form of joint stock 
companies. Forty million Russians have become shareholders in 
various enterprises as a result of cheque privatization. 
  "We have solved the problem of attracting people to 
ownership, the second stage of lifting state control over the 
economy and attracting money to the privatized enterprises is 
now beginning," Chubays stressed. "The second stage of 
privatization will begin on 1 July, based on monetary demand. 
This will enable us to resolve the important issue of the 
influx of investment into the Russian economy." 
  The chairman of the state property committee also reported 
that -- by a decision of the Russian Government - he and 
government Deputy Chairman Aleksandr Zaveryukha had been given 
responsibility for carrying out the privatization of land. A 
draft program for this would be drawn up on the basis of 
experience in Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast and would be presented for 
consideration by the government of Russia in two months time.

<F P=106> [Unattributed Commentary: "Government Amends Own Decision </F>
on Import Duties"] 
  [Text] Having heeded the voice of the business world, the 
majority of which spoke out against the hasty and sudden 
imposition of customs import duties, the government has adopted 
a decision which somewhat amends Decree No. 196, which has 
become well known throughout the country. The essence of the 
amendments is as follows. Import duties on goods which have not 
been increased when compared with previous rates are to operate 
from 15 March. But those which have risen will not go into 
force until 1 July. This means that importers who concluded 
contracts before 15 March have been given a breathing space. 
  This is the response to the complaint of businessmen buying 
goods abroad for the Russian consumer who have rightly 
criticized the authors of the decree for the fact that importers 
were not forewarned of the planned changes and could not prepare 
for them. Meanwhile, an amendment to the law on customs tariffs 
is now being examined which will envisage that after a decision 
on the imposition of new duties, importers are to be given at 
least 90 days to adapt to the changed conditions. 
  Before the end of the year it is planned initially to reduce 
a number of customs duties which exceed 30 percent of the 
customs value of certain commodities. This government intention 
is in keeping with the GATT requirement for an average world 
level of rates no higher than 7-8 percent, whereas the rate in 
our country currently exceeds 14 percent.

<F P=106> [Valeriy Konovalov report: "New Ideas for Our Peasants, Or </F>
the New Way Is the Completely Forgotten Old Way"] 
  [Text] IZVESTIYA has received a package of documents that 
have been prepared for signing. They are an edict of the 
president, a government decree, and statutes on reorganizing 
agricultural enterprises and breaking them up into smaller 
units. The draft documents have been initialed by many top 
leaders involved in agrarian problems and privatization. One of 
the drafts has been referred back for revision, while others 
have apparently already been fully agreed and will be published 
in the near future. 
  What do they mean for agrarian reform and the peasants? The 
main idea is to break farms up into smaller units, which is a 
fairly popular idea among rural reformers at grassroots level. 
For instance, my close acquaintance Viktor Gulov, a peasant 
whom we have often written about, is convinced that it is 
possible to arrive at real private farming from our kolkhoz 
reality by a simple arithmetical path -- by dividing farms up 
into as small units as possible, thus getting down to family 
farming. The mechanism for this kind of division into the 
smallest units has been provided by the Nizhniy Novgorod 
experiment of collective farms being redivided into joint-stock 
enterprises. It is no accident that the Russian Federation 
government decree on the practice of agrarian transformations in 
Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast occupies a very important place in the 
package of documents. 
  All the indications are that the idea of breaking farms up 
into smaller units as a method of fighting the kolkhoz system 
has also inspired the Analytical Center for Socioeconomic Policy 
under the Russian Federation President's Administration. It was 
from this center that the aforementioned draft documents were 
issued. 
  It is a thankless task to explain what is in the draft 
documents, since they are being subjected to revision, further 
work, and so on, and even complete changes of meaning. I will 
merely note that there is a principle of compulsion in these 
documents. If an agricultural enterprise does not want to be 
broken up into smaller units, then, according to the draft 
edict, this will be done for it. 
  It is pointless to dispute the idea of breaking farms down 
into smaller units. First of all, this has already happened. 
And the kolkhozes which were made smaller did not stop being 
kolkhozes. Second, what is there to dispute: Of course, a 
smaller collective is more mobile, and it is better suited to 
the market. But it would be more convenient for it to solve the 
problem of its own size than to have this done on orders from 
Moscow. 
  And what is to happen now to the agricultural enterprises 
which have already been turned into joint-stock enterprises and 
which see themselves as proprietors, even major proprietors? 
Why should they be subjected to the dictates of the capital and 
be divided up if they do not want this? Of course, on a broad 
level, the breaking up of agricultural enterprises may be 
advantageous. However, for the course of agrarian reform and 
for the peasants, the future documents may also prove to be a 
destabilizing factor. 
  The countryside is waiting for something entirely different. 
A law on agricultural cooperatives, the organization of a land 
market, a system of mortgage banks, a targeted financial policy, 
and so on. Instead, a new wave of reorganization is 
approaching, maybe with some sense to it, but in no way 
replacing the changes which the Russian countryside is expecting.

<F P=106> [Interview with Gennadiy Melikyan, Russian Federation </F>
minister of labor, by POSTFACTUM; place and date not given: 
"Social Policy Must Not Be the Hostage of Political Speculation"] 
  [Text] [POSTFACTUM] Gennadiy Georgiyevich, the Russian 
president's message to the Federal Assembly speaks of the need 
to reduce the social costs of the policy of reforms. Yours is a 
key ministry in the social sphere. What do you see as the way 
to resolve this problem? 
  [Melikyan] Strictly speaking, this is our main task, and it 
was for this that our ministry was created. In 1993 we 
succeeded in preventing a further fall in the living standards 
of the bulk of the population and in avoiding mass unemployment. 
And yet we cannot speak of any turning point or the start of 
one. The production slump is intensifying, and stoppages of 
enterprises and their transfer to a reduced work week are 
assuming an increasingly mass nature. The growth in nonpayments 
and the lack of funds in enterprises' accounts have led to a 
sharp increase in delays over paying wages. It is natural that 
all this displeases and alarms people and creates social 
tension. It will be no exaggeration to say that the situation 
in the social sphere is close to being a crisis situation. 
  [POSTFACTUM] Does this mean that there are no conditions 
today for implementing an effective social policy? 
  [Melikyan] If I thought that, I would make a proposal to 
abolish the ministry as being useless or at least tender my 
resignation. It is possible and necessary to elaborate a 
policy, but a realistic policy. People both at the top and at 
the bottom must be clearly aware that there are no 
miracle-working prescriptions for a rapid and substantial 
improvement in people's lives. This is above all because 
society's objective potential and the actual resources which can 
be used for these purposes have diminished. Until the 
production slump ends and we surmount the economic crisis, the 
public loaf will merely diminish in size, not increase. 
  Second point. I do not want to say that the ministry is 
doing everything it can. We have let slip a great deal and been 
slow to implement a number of measures. At the same time far 
from everything depends on us and our work. The resolution of 
the problems of incomes, employment, and working conditions is 
determined, in the final analysis, by the overall economic and 
financial policy that is implemented. 
  Therefore I would formulate as follows my present credo as 
the minister responsible for a certain area of social policy. 
First, not to set myself unrealizable goals, not to make 
promises I cannot fulfill. But to strive for the maximum within 
the framework of the actual potential and the decisions adopted. 
Second, to be sure of real, not declarative support for the 
social measures being taken on the part of the president, the 
government, parliament, and the organs of power of the 
republics, the krays and oblasts, and the autonomous entities. 
Social policy must not be the hostage of political speculation 
and intrigue or of egotistical regional or corporative interests. 
  We are convinced that in the present grave economic 
situation 
the emphasis in social policy must be placed on effective 
actions in several very important areas that are capable of 
producing a tangible return within a short time. We have put 
corresponding proposals to the government. They have been 
approved in principle. We are now working on specific documents 
-- draft laws, government decrees, and presidential edicts. 
  [POSTFACTUM] Which drafts, specifically, do you mean? 
  [Melikyan] I will name those that seem most significant. We 
propose to curb growth in the labor remuneration fund or the 
consumption fund at enterprises which have wages that exceed the 
average for industry. I emphasize: curb, not freeze, and 
introduce this measure temporarily, in conjunction with other 
measures to suppress inflation and to overcome disproportions in 
labor remuneration. 
  Further, we propose to introduce a mechanism for curbing 
growth in the prices of certain most important foodstuffs -- 
above all, bread, milk and certain dairy products, and meat 
products, with the exception of delicatessen ones. 
  We deem it expedient to take control of the present practice 
whereby leaders of state enterprises and of joint-stock 
companies with state participation receive wages that are 
exponentially higher than the average wage for the enterprise. 
The difference can be of the order of 10 times or more, 
including at enterprises whose financial position is far from 
good. This rightly displeases working people. The ministry 
prepared a draft decree "On the Terms of Labor Remuneration for 
Leaders of State Enterprises on the Conclusion of Agreements 
(Contracts)." V. Chernomyrdin, chairman of the government, 
signed our draft. So this payment procedure is coming into 
force. 
  One of the most "explosive" social problems today is 
probably 
that of the delays over paying wages. Before the system of 
mutual transactions in the national economy is regularized, we 
propose introducing a calendar sequence of payments, with the 
exception of wages. These are to be paid by way of a top 
priority at the rate of up to six times the minimum wage. In 
the event of a delay in the payment of wages, the labor 
collective or the trade union has the right to raise the 
question of dismissing the leader from his post. 
  In addition, we have prepared a number of documents aimed at 
increasing the monetary incomes of the employed population. 
These are draft laws on the minimum living wage and on 
indexation of the minimum wage and a draft government decree on 
increasing the labor remuneration of working people in the 
budget-funded sphere. 
  In our country, incidentally, budget-funded working people 
made up the bulk of that category of the population which lives 
below the poverty line. This is borne out by the fact that when 
we at last began paying indexed wages to working people in 
budget-funded sectors in February, the proportion of the poor 
population fell from 34 percent (data for January this year) to 
17 percent, i.e. it was exactly halved. It turns out that those 
on low incomes are budget-funded working people and some 
pensioners. 
  Finally, before the Law on the Minimum Living Wage is 
adopted, the authorities in the components of the Federation and 
organs of local self-management are to be recommended to emulate 
the experience of Nizhniy Novgorod, Voronezh Oblast, and the 
city of Moscow and put into practice a system of targeted 
assistance for the most needy citizens. 
  [POSTFACTUM] One gets the impression that far from everyone 
will support your plans. Some will criticize you for proposing 
antimarket measures, others for the fact that your proposals 
will entail an increase in inflation. 
  [Melikyan] We propose to regulate monetary incomes and 
prices by economic means, not administrative ones, so there is 
nothing antimarket here. This is the usual practice in any 
countries where the state seeks to regulate economic life and 
not to avoid this. This is the practice in countries which we so 
like to call civilized. 
  Now about the inflationary effect of the proposed measures. 
I believe that growth in the money supply should not be limited 
all the time. Restrictions on demand, i.e. a reduction in the 
demand for output owing to a lack of money, depress production 
itself, particularly consumer goods production. The limitation 
of monetary incomes should not be made an end in itself, but 
their growth should simply be regulated. 
  In general, I am a committed supporter of the idea that the 
best means of social protection for the able-bodied section of 
the population is to create conditions so that people can earn. 
The whole country must not be turned into a social security 
department, when the population puts its trust not in its own 
qualifications, activity, and initiative but in social benefits. 
  In addition, the argument over the consequences of our 
indexation proposals is of an abstract nature at present. We 
proposed starting the new stage of indexation in March, but this 
has not happened, although the leadership realizes at the top 
level that there is no getting away from this. A struggle is 
being waged between representatives of the social bloc and the 
financial bloc. 
  [POSTFACTUM] This struggle will be manifested particularly 
visibly during the discussion of the draft budget in the State 
Duma. How do you rate the prospects for the budget's adoption? 
  [Melikyan] In my view, the budget does not suit anyone in 
its present form -- neither political parties nor corporative 
groupings. Everyone will criticize it, and everyone will seek 
to extort as much as possible for himself. I am afraid that the 
budget's passage will drag on for a long time. I do not even 
rule out the possibility that we might once again be left 
without a budget, as last year. 
  [POSTFACTUM] It is already obvious that the first three 
months of this year brought about a production slump on a still 
greater scale than in any period during the previous three or 
four years. This will evidently give a new boost to talk of 
introducing an economic state of emergency. What is your 
opinion of this? 
  [Melikyan] There is a lot of talk of this, but nobody knows 
what it means. If this term denotes a rapid response to the 
economic situation within the framework of the Constitution and 
the laws, then I am in favor of it. Although, in my view, this 
is not an economic state of emergency but normal operational 
work in an economic crisis situation. 
  It is another matter that certain political forces invest 
this concept with different meaning, when emphasis is placed not 
on the word "economic" but on the word "emergency." Such forces 
exist on the extreme flanks of both camps -- both the democratic 
camp and the opposition camp. Therefore, when the idea of an 
economic state of emergency is advanced as a smoke screen for 
pushing a political "emergency," I am against it. 
  This is why it is so important to implement the Agreement on 
Civil Peace in practice. Knowing the positions of "Russia's 
Choice" and "Democratic Russia" on the one hand and of the 
Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, the Communists, and the 
Agrarians on the other, I find it hard to imagine that they can 
reach agreement on anything with one another. Nevertheless, we 
must move toward accord in the name of the well-being of Russia 
and its citizens.

<F P=106> [Otto Latsis report: "Russia's Economy on the Bottom. Is </F>
It Not Time To Climb Back?"] 
  [Text] Up-to-date information has been received from the 
State Committee for Statistics on Russia's socioeconomic 
situation in the first quarter. It testifies not only to the 
continuation of known processes in the economy, but to new 
phenomena too. 
  Today's slump is qualitatively different. In industry, the 
slump in production is far more acute and far more profound than 
last year. Industrial production fell by 24.9 percent in 
comparison with the first quarter of last year, and by 27.4 
percent in March in comparison with March last year. This, 
indeed, is something which has not been seen since the beginning 
of 1992. The slump hit 19.3 percent in the first quarter of 
1993 as measured against the level of the first quarter of 1992. 
<H5>  First Sales Crisis in 70 Years </H5>
  However, it is not so much the quantitative as the 
qualitative changes which are significant. You will recall that 
the first wave of the slump was attributed largely to the 
disruption of links with CEMA countries. Then the 
disintegration of relations between USSR republics and the 
regions of Russia began. Price deregulation revived interest in 
the ruble, but 1992 hit industry with wholesale conversion in 
the "defense sector." Today, all these things have moved either 
into the past or onto the second stage. 
  According to data for January and February, only 6 percent 
of 
stoppages in industrial production can be attributed to 
conversion, and around one-third to inadequate provision of 
material resources. Lack of demand for products caused 58 
percent of the losses in working time from stoppages in 
production. Consumers are dissatisfied with either the price, 
the range, or the quality of products, or with all of these 
things taken together. In actual fact, the influence of the 
sales factor is probably even greater because many enterprises, 
instead of reorganizing production in line with market 
requirements, are loading the very same commodity onto knowingly 
insolvent consumers and then requesting state help in resolving 
the problems of nonpayments. In fact, many "nonpayments" are 
the result of the very same absence of a market. 
  This is a situation which our industry has not known for 
around 70 years, since the days of the 1921-1924 sales crisis. 
And now, as then, there is no sense in enterprises relying on 
state help to solve this problem. The state can help some 
enterprises at the expense of others, but it is powerless faced 
with a crisis hitting virtually all of them. There is no other 
option but for them to reduce their own expenditure and, in the 
wake of this, prices, and to alter the range in line with 
consumer aspirations. 
  For decades, our consumer has been compelled not to purchase 
a commodity but to "take" whatever is "given." Under market 
prices, this does not work. But if the thing the consumer needs 
is put on offer -- then the money is found to purchase it. For 
instance, production of trucks has fallen by slightly more than 
two-thirds (in January-February in comparison with the same 
period last year), while, according to the results of the first 
quarter, production of cars dropped by 31 percent whereas bus 
production hardly fell at all: The latter are needed by cities 
which have lost the opportunity to acquire "Ikarus" buses for 
hard currency. Virtually nobody would claim that our buses are 
better in terms of technical standards than our trucks or cars 
-- or that they are very cheap. But they are needed -- so 
production is maintained. Likewise, UAZ vehicles are needed -- 
so the Ulyanovsk Automobile Plant is running, while the ZIL 
[Likhachev Automobile Plant] and GAZ [Gorkiy Automobile Plant] 
plants are at a standstill. 
<H5>  Market Saturation Grows </H5>
  Events taking place in connection with the consumer goods 
market are even more vivid. Sales volumes for consumer goods in 
the first quarter were 4 percent down on last year, while the 
figure for March was 8 percent down. As for paid services, the 
volume of these comprised just 49 percent in comparison with the 
level for the first quarter of last year, and 22 percent in 
comparison to the first quarter of 1991. The effective demand 
of the population places a rigid limit on sales. How is the 
market reacting to this? 
  First, the coefficient for commodity saturation of the 
retail 
network is rising (this coefficient expresses the correlation 
between the number of cities where the commodity was on sale, 
and the total number of cities being monitored, of which there 
are 132). In the space of one year (February through February), 
this coefficient rose from 57 to 82 in respect of foodstuffs, 
and from 76 to 90 in respect of noncomestibles. In respect of 
vegetable oil and sugar, this figure hit 100 in March. 
  Second, price rises are slowing down. Here is how the 
indicators for the growth of the price index looked in the 
period from October through March (expressed in percentages by 
comparison with the previous month): 19, 17, 13, 21, 10, 9. 
With the exception of the January upsurge, typical of the first 
month of the year for a number of reasons, inflation is falling 
steadily. 
  And so it is that despite talk about the various inscrutable 
peculiarities of our market, general economic laws do operate in 
Russia too. A drop in demand, an increase in reserves, a cut in 
production, and a slowing down of inflation go hand in hand. 
And the only way to overcome the crisis is persistent economic 
compulsion for producers to overhaul the structure of production 
in line with market requirements and to cut prices. Resisting 
the pressure of sector lobby groups now, and refusing to return 
to the path of spoon-feeding inefficient enterprises through the 
state budget or preferential credits, means opening the way to 
recovery for a sickly economy. 
  The objection inevitably arises: It is easy to say stand 
firm, but how can this be done when there are so many poor 
people all around, when a multitude of enterprises which are 
undoubtedly vital to the country are on the brink of ruin?! In 
part, the answer to this is provided by life itself. Yes, the 
fight against inflation is inseparable from a "tight money" 
policy. Even the moderately stringent financial restraints of 
the past year led to a situation where pay increased more slowly 
than prices, as a result of which the average real wage in the 
first quarter was 4 percent down on last year, while in March 
this figure was 3 percent down. But at the same time, the 
population's disposable income (money left over after essential 
payments), taking due account of the price index for the year, 
rose by 10 percent. How can the average income rise while the 
average wage drops? Purely at the expense of a second job, and 
via additional earnings. The statistics confirm: The 
proportion of the wages fund making up the total volume of 
income fell from 65 percent to 59 percent, while that of 
additional earnings has risen. 
  An evaluation of the social consequences of such a 
development cannot be simple. People are earning more, but to 
do this they have to work more. But this is better than abject 
poverty. Meanwhile, there is a gradual healing of the most 
painful social ulcer of the transition period: large-scale 
deprivation. Last January, 35.5 percent of Russia's total 
population were on incomes lower than the minimum wage, while in 
December this figure was 26.7 percent, and in March this year -- 
17 percent. This is still an awful lot -- more than 25 million 
people. But it is half as many as at the beginning of last 
year. Last year, 13 percent of the population had incomes which 
were not only lower than the minimum wage, but even lower than 
the cost of the minimum food basket. In the last quarter, this 
figure was 6 percent. 
<H5>  Peasants Are Hindered by Russian Monopolism, Not Imports </H5>
  Statistics for foreign economic relations reflect some very 
interesting processes. Exports continue to rise slowly, but 
imports are falling rapidly (although not as rapidly as last 
year). As a result, the foreign trade surplus, which was highly 
significant last year, is increasing. In the first quarter, the 
excess of exports over imports hit $5.1 billion. Unfortunately, 
the traditional raw materials imbalance in the structure of 
exports increased even more. Exports of cars and equipment, 
already negligible, declined even further. 
  However, a relatively new process is attracting attention: 
Food imports are falling sharply. Grain imports in the last 
quarter were 81 percent lower than a year earlier -- that is, 
they fell by a factor of more than five. It is known that from 
now on the state does not intend to import more grain -- all 
that will remain will be imports at the discretion of 
enterprises. Imports of raw sugar fell even more sharply -- by 
92 percent, while those of refined sugar dropped by 49 percent, 
freshly frozen meat by 53 percent, and butter by 8 percent. 
  Let us note: All this occurred before the government's 
decision to introduce import tariffs on foreign food. So how 
can one justify talk on the part of our agro-industrial lobby 
about the influx of cheap food from abroad which is suffocating 
national production? Yes, the country does have ample meat 
supplies (incidentally, we have not heard such words for some 30 
years). But is this the fault of the importers? Last year, meat 
production fell by 7 percent, or 860,000 tonnes (in live 
weight), and in the first quarter of this year it fell by 13 
percent. Meanwhile, meat imports from abroad for the whole of 
last year came to just 77,700 tonnes, while in the first quarter 
of this year this figure was 10,700 tonnes. The entire volume 
of imports is substantially lower than the scale of the slump in 
national production. It is not imports which can be blamed for 
low demand, but the expense, limited variety, and poor quality 
of Russian food. Introducing import tariffs and finally 
shutting out foreign competition will provide our 
agro-industrial complex with an opportunity to increase prices 
even further instead of lowering them -- and then demand will 
fall even more markedly and the predicament of Russian peasants 
will become even more difficult. 
  Clearly we have to help our producers not by freeing them 
from competition from importers. They need to be provided with 
good roads in order to convey products to the city, and a good 
processing industry. They have to be set free of food industry 
and trade monopolies, which, more than anything else, are 
inflating prices. Incidentally, the peasants themselves are 
doing just this. Even now, in conditions of a wretched 
processing and trade infrastructure, they are reducing the sale 
of goods to state procurement agencies and increasing sales at 
markets, through their own trade network, through public 
catering outlets, and via other channels. 
  There is no easy way out of the crisis. But if there is no 
deviation from fulfilling the demands of the market, and if the 
mindless structure of production derived from the "planned 
economy" is painstakingly reworked into something more rational, 
then it is possible to find a way out. But if there is a new 
plunge into an inflationary spiral, there will be no increase in 
production, as the experience of past inflationary upsurges has 
shown, but rather the solution of all economic and social 
problems will be put off even longer. 
  To try to withstand, to survive this most difficult and, 
therefore, decisive period, and not to turn back -- this is a 
worthy aim. Is it enough? It seems that the crisis in the 
economy is approaching the state that the Americans call "the 
bottom": there is no further to fall. But this by no means 
signifies that a revival will begin tomorrow of its own accord. 
It is possible to lie on the "bottom" in a state of stagnation 
for a fairly long time. It is important not to miss that moment 
when a kick-start is required, when an incentive to start 
climbing is called for. A sensible reduction of taxes could 
provide this incentive for the healthy, viable portion of our 
industry. But only if it is not accompanied by an increase in 
the budget deficit and, with it, accelerated inflation, 
otherwise this will be an incentive not to heal but to intensify 
the disease. This means that it is possible and expedient only 
if state expenditure is cut to the same extent and at the same 
time. All this is food for thought when completing the work now 
under way on the budget for this year.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yakov Dubenetskiy, chairman of the </F>
Promstroybank Board of Directors, by correspondent Yelena 
Tokareva; date, place not given: "Yakov Dubenetskiy: "There 
Are Trillions in the Banks, But It Is Not Suitable for 
Investment"] 
  [Text] Politicians have recently started discussing how 
commercial banks' "available" resources might be used for 
investment. According to one estimate, it is 22 trillion rubles 
[R], while the Central Bank of Russia [CBR] figure is R36 
trillion. Our correspondent talks here about the feasibility of 
such resources being employed in this way with Yakov 
Dubenetskiy, chairman of the Board of Directors of Russia's 
Promstroybank, which is the government's official agent for 
financing and issuing credit to state investment programs. 
  [Tokareva] Yakov Niolayevich, every honest Russian citizen 
is worried not just by the rate of interest on his own savings 
but by the problem of investment in the ultimate basis of the 
country's security -- its industry, agriculture, and science. 
Our premier recently said that R22 trillion is lying idle in 
commercial banks. While the budget is gasping for lack of 
resources. Why is it that the banks don't invest resources in 
the economy but mostly deal in short-term money? At the same 
time Vice Premier Chubays has stated that a network of 
investment funds for G-7 resources will have to be set up for 
investment activity during the second stage of privatization. 
Do we really have such unpatriotic banks that they have no wish 
to bolster their country's prosperity? 
  [Dubenetskiy] Compared with the beginning of the nineties, 
investment has fallen off fivefold, although the official 
statistics indicate only a twofold decrease. In 1992 the 
construction of 32,000 installations was halted while at the 
same time construction was started up on 34,000. Of course, you 
might think that structural reorganization was happening. But 
most likely it is a case of confused thinking when you stop the 
construction of one plant for lack of resources but then 
immediately start laying down the infrastructure for another. 
  Each year the USSR made 210 billions' worth of capital 
investment, 70 percent of which went to Russia, where the 
capital-intensive sectors were based. If you discount 
investnment in agriculture and the social sphere, 50-55 billion 
was left. This constituted capital investment in industry 
during the time of stagnation. The value of all assets at those 
prices was R3.5 trillion. Production assets were worth R2.5 
trillion. They were 50 percent worn out. And each year roughly 
1 trillion rubles was required for their physical replacement. 
Very little was invested in modernization. It took 10 years to 
replace obsolete equipment. And it became obsolete twice over 
during that time. But yet in those conditions 50-55 billion was 
invested in modernizing industry. 
  Financing on a repayment basis is now accepted. The first 
quarter of 1994 saw 300 billion allocated to conversion and 400 
billion to investment in the remaining spheres. If these 
figures are allocated over the whole of the current year, R3 
trillion will go on investment in these spheres. But the 
construction costs index has gone up 1,500 times. Consequently, 
a simple calculation shows that in old prices 2 billion is 
actually being invested. Two billion to modernize assets during 
a democratic dash for the market! Just 2 billion! And that, 
given 60-70 percent obsolescence. 
  You say that banks are accused both from below and above 
for our engaging in usury. Yes, the commercialization of banks 
and their fragmentation in July 1990 did do the economy a bad 
turn. Settlements are in a state of disarray. Sharp practice 
flourishes. Banks have turned their back on investment and 
industry and switched to issuing credit to commercial structures. 
  What are banks to do? To issue long-term credit you need to 
have long-term money. The banks' sources of funds are insurance 
money, the population's pension payments, enterprises' 
resourcse, and the resources of the Central Bank. But their 
clients' money is money placed for three-six months. The banks 
have virtually no long-term money. Only 3-4 percent of 
short-term money can be employed for long-term credit. No more 
than that. You can invest only with long-term money. But the 
resources are extremely limited. You cannot talk in serious 
terms about the 36 trillion (the CBR figure) deposited in 
commercial banks as an investment stockpile. Credit deposits 
amount to R30.5 trillion, of which only 1 trillion is long-term. 
  What's to be done? It is difficult to find substantial 
resources within an inflationary system. And it is impossible 
not to sustain investment for the economy's survival. The only 
option is...to issue money? But in a severely restricted way -- 
by way of competitions and tenders. We are ready to work for a 
margin of 1 percent, at the same time as other banks work for a 
3-percent profit. 
  [Tokareva] Everyone is frightened by the term "issuing of 
money".... 
  [Dubenetskiy] You should not equate it with the effect of 
the inflation which accompanies investment. Resources are 
allocated for the long term. While issuing money to cover the 
budget deficit is just plugging a gap, and is dangerous. The 
effectiveness achieved by the processes of privatization will be 
of great importance. If a private owner borrows money, he 
normally makes use of it. 
  [Tokareva] How do you regard the discussion about foreign 
investment in our economy? 
  [Dubenetskiy] The West does not want a powerful competitor 
in the shape of a strengthened Russia. What they want from us 
is the development of the infrastructure of the economy so that 
resources can be utilized. Large-scale help from the West is 
unlikely to ensue. The West does not have the available money 
either. There is speculative capital which "sloshes around" in 
exchanges and banks. But it won't go into investment. The 
owner of such capital will always receive a guaranteed 
10-percent profit back home in Munich. Without risk. Here he 
could receive 17 percent or more, but he could lose his life. 
We are a high-risk country for businessmen. You won't find a 
"businessman" anywhere in the West who, as in our country, will 
after 18 months' "work" acquire a Mercedes for himself and a 
Honda for his wife while his mother-in-law drives a Toyota. 
  But the opportunity to receive investment only comes in 
exchange for concessions and the exploitation of mineral 
resources. And, according to certain estimates, we have 35 
trillion dollars' worth of the latter in our country. From that 
standpoint, Lenin really was a bold innovator and was not afraid 
to give the West access to our natural wealth. There was a law 
on concessions during the NEP period. This all played a role in 
the development of devastated Russia. Our innovators, however, 
fear to do this for some reason. They are no doubt anxious about 
how the patriots will react to them. Meanwhile, it is hardly 
worth pinning high hopes on the World Bank, the IMF, or the 
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development [EBRD]. These 
are politicized organizations. The terms they set are pretty 
difficult to meet. And their financial help is not of the 
requisite scale. We are unlikely to get large-scale state 
investment from the West either. So we are left with 
transnational corporations which have an interest in our mineral 
resources. 
  [Tokareva] What is your attitude toward the nonpayments 
crisis and the possibility of resolving it? 
  [Dubenetskiy] Nonpayments? It is difficult to find a plant 
which is not sustained by the capital of several banks and which 
does not keep too much credit, including hard-currency credit, 
on deposit. Why, given this, doesn't it pay its bills? Tough 
measures are needed. There is no other way. It is altogether 
time to make use of compulsion, on the one hand, and goodwill, 
on the other. We need agreements incorporating penalty clauses 
between industrialists, agricultural producers, and bankers. 
The Central Bank must work out mandatory terms for bankers. A 
high rate of interest for refinancing is no way to fight 
inflation. It is necessary to reach agreement on reducing the 
rate of interest on investment credit and on allocating 
one-third of resources for investment in the development of 
small and medium-sized businesses. Banks also have to make 
their contribution to curbing inflation. Those who don't play 
the game must be subject to economic sanctions, being denied, 
for example, access to centralized credit. It is essential to 
combine economic methods and compulsion.

<F P=106> [Interview with Khachim Karmokov, chairman of the Federal </F>
Assembly Comptroller's Office, by Ruslan Lynev; date, place not 
given: "Comptroller's Office -- Between the Branches of Power"] 
  [Text] There are avenues of economic policy which are 
fatally unlucky. This has been the case not only with the budget 
but with the control of its execution. The former Russian 
Supreme Soviet's Control and Budget Committee found itself 
sidelined, as it were, before it was able to develop and the new 
Federal Assembly Comptroller's Office currently consists only of 
the chairman -- the 52-year-old State Duma Deputy Khachim 
Karmokov, who had until recently headed the Republic of 
Kabardino-Balkaria Supreme Soviet. 
  [Lynev] So, there is a chairman but no office. Why? And 
what form should the office take? 
  [Karmokov] Under the Constitution (Article 101, Paragraph 
5), the Comptroller's Office is the Russian Federation Federal 
Assembly organ that monitors the execution of the federal 
budget. A draft law on it and its status, functions, powers, 
and structure was drawn up by the president's Legislative 
Proposals Commission with the participation of the Supreme 
Soviet Control and Budget Committee and other organizations. 
This bill had its first reading in the State Duma the other 
day. And the shape of the office will depend on the type of law 
that is passed. 
  [Lynev] What does the draft law say on this score? 
  [Karmokov] It raises the question somewhat differently from 
the Constitution. First, the office is presented as a statewide 
financial control organ that is independent in its activity and 
is subordinate only to the law. Second, under the draft, the 
office monitors not only execution of the budget but the 
activity of nonbudgetary funds and, finally, the utilization of 
state property. 
  [Lynev] That's a tall order, as they say. Doesn't it strike 
you that each of the three avenues of monitoring you have 
mentioned are important in themselves and have their own 
features? For instance, there would seem to be nobody 
responsible for the state property that is not currently being 
privatized. How is it to be dealt with? Should a special 
superministry be set up? Should administrative control be 
passed down to the regions, creating something akin to the old 
national economic councils? It's an open question. And we can 
see that it is linked with two other, quite separate issues -- 
monitoring of the budget and nonbudgetary funds. 
  [Karmokov] I agree. These are different, independent areas 
of monitoring. I am convinced that they should not be mixed up 
-- you can't do everything. (Suffice it to say that the sums 
handled by our nonbudgetary funds -- pensions funds and others 
-- are of the same order as the revenue side of the federal 
budget). But it is far more important that the Comptroller's 
Office, under the draft and contrary to the Constitution, will 
not be a parliamentary organ but will be positioned somewhere 
between the branches of power without being dependent on either 
of them. 
  [Lynev] Is there a bad side to the monitoring organ having 
this kind of independence? 
  [Karmokov] First, as I have just said, it contravenes the 
Constitution. Second -- and this is the main point -- it is bad 
because parliament is deprived of essentially the only means of 
monitoring envisaged by the fundamental law. With the current 
noticeable strengthening in the executive, there is a risk that 
the office could come under its influence -- as has in practice 
happened to the recently independent Central Bank of Russia. 
Just imagine -- those executing the budget would be monitoring 
it themselves. That is only possible when there is no 
separation of powers or when the system of their separation is 
incomplete. 
  [Lynev] As is well known, the Finance Ministry is 
responsible for the execution of the federal budget. It 
monitors the timeliness and fullness of every item of revenue, 
the accuracy of spending on the upkeep of the authorities, 
defense, education, and so forth -- down to the very lowest 
level. What form should the Comptroller's Office take -- surely 
not a new administrative monster duplicating the Finance 
Ministry? 
  [Karmokov] Anything but. I am opposed to increasing the 
staffing of the office to that level. But let's take another 
look at the Constitution and at real life. The fundamental law 
envisages that the chairman of the office is chosen by the Duma, 
the deputy (who has not yet been chosen) is selected by the 
Federation Council, and the auditors are drawn from each chamber 
equally. 
  [Lynev] How many will there be? 
  [Karmokov] That too has not yet been decided. But if we 
have one for each of the most important avenues of budgetary 
control, there will be eight to 12 people. 
  [Lynev] Will they be deputies? 
  [Karmokov] They will primarily be qualified specialists. 
And if a deputy has the relevant qualifications, then why not? 
This will strengthen the office's links with parliament. As 
for its size, the office's staff will reach 500-550 people. 
These will mainly be comptrollers [kontrolery] and auditors. 
  [Lynev] Wouldn't you call that overblown? 
  [Karmokov] The corresponding body in the FRG has 420 
employees, while the U.S. equivalent has a staff of 5,248. 
  [Lynev] And are they paid out of the budget they monitor? 
  [Karmokov] Yes. But in the United States a single budgetary 
dollar invested in monitoring yields $60 in return. In 1989 
staffers at the General Accounting Office -- which is what this 
service is called in the United States -- saved $23 billion. 
  [Lynev] How will the office's work be organized? For 
instance, the draft budget for this year states that 
privatization proceeds will total 147 billion rubles. How will 
that be checked? 
  [Karmokov] First and foremost we must find out just how 
realistic this figure is. Of what does it consist? What are 
the specific sources? It is not enough to know that the Finance 
Ministry, under the budget adopted by the State Duma, has 
allocated so much to education or defense, say. It is important 
to monitor the figures all the way down to see whether the funds 
reach each specific consumer on time or get stuck halfway, 
bringing somebody a "windfall." We have to do that for each 
item. 
  [Lynev] Are you not worried about the scale and complexity 
of the job? 
  [Karmokov] It's a difficult area because it requires not 
just a certain level of qualifications but also other human 
qualities -- a principled approach, firmness, and experience of 
organizational work. Nonetheless, I would like to answer your 
question optimistically -- we will do our job.

<F P=106> [Political observer Vitaliy Golovachev article: "The </F>
Economy Has Stumbled on the Threshold of the Market. And Hurt 
Itself Badly"] 
  [Text] Whatever people say, signs of market relations 
(both positive and, alas, more clearly, negative signs) are 
still appearing in Russia, attesting to complex processes in the 
economy. Let us take the production slump, for example. 
Whereas at the beginning of last year the shortage of supplies 
of raw materials, semimanufactures, and fuel was the predominant 
cause of stoppages, in the first quarter of 1994 quite a 
different factor is already coming to the fore -- demand. That 
is, the most important thing today is whether the output of a 
given enterprise is in demand. 
  This would appear to be entirely a market trend. But this is 
what is alarming. Month after month passes, but many "drowning" 
enterprises have no intention of engaging in structural 
restructuring and do not have survival plans. 
  More and more new sections and shops and entire plants are 
falling prey to paralysis. There were lengthy stoppages of 
individual production processes or of an entire plant at 3,800 
enterprises in January, at 4,300 in February, and at almost 
5,000 in March. Losses of worktime exceeded 60 million man-days. 
  The most alarming thing is the scale of the crisis. The fall 
in production is increasing every month: The physical volume of 
production fell 23.1 percent in January (compared with the same 
period last year); 24.1 percent in February; 27.4 percent in 
March. There has not been such a collapse in all the time of 
implementing the reforms. If we compare the situation 
with 1989, we will see a striking picture: Production of 
industrial output has been more than halved and now stands at 
just 49.6 percent. You cannot envy our government, since Russia 
seems to be crossing a dangerous, critical line, approaching the 
large-scale destruction of its industrial potential. 
  This is largely connected with the snowballing crisis of 
nonpayments. Operational materials just received from the 
Russian State Committee for Statistics attest that the problem 
is being exacerbated, jeopardizing the country's economic 
security. As of 1 January creditors' defaulted arrears amounted 
to 16 trillion rubles [R]; as of 1 February -- R20 trillion; as 
of 1 March -- R25 trillion. The fact that nonpayments are 
increasing at a faster pace than inflation attests to a 
deepening crisis. 
  Meanwhile, many millions of Russians are feeling this 
problem 
very directly in their family budget. In Russia, contrary to 
common sense, the flawed practice of nonpayment (or incomplete 
payment) of wages and other payments is assuming an increasingly 
wide scale. Thus, it turns out that someone has worked in a 
shop for two weeks, he goes to the cash desk and sees an 
announcement: "In connection with the fact that the state has 
not settled up with the enterprise for the state order, the 
plant has no money, and wages for this month will be issued 
later." Is this not absurd, is it not humiliating? Millions of 
Russians live without wages for three weeks, for a month, for 
two months. They sell things, get into debt.... 
  I had hoped that, in connection with the fact that there had 
been a considerable transfusion of money into the economy in 
February (R1.6 trillion), the notorious knot of nonpayments 
would be untied little by little. But no, it turns out that 
everything is the other way around -- the defaulted wage arrears 
are not diminishing but increasing. As of 1 January, they 
totaled R766 billion; as of 1 February -- R1.681 trillion; as of 
1 March -- R2.085 trillion; as of 1 April (according to 
preliminary operational data) -- R2.374 trillion. In other 
words, during the first quarter the total of wage debts 
increased more than threefold, noticeably overtaking the rate of 
inflation. 
  The situation is becoming dangerously explosive. The 
miners' pickets outside the White House are being replaced by 
nuclear scientists, students.... Will we live to see the day 
when working people of all the 30,000 enterprises where workers 
are owed wages will rise up? 
  In an attempt to avoid this and to strengthen the legal 
base, 
on 10 March 1994 Russian President Boris Yeltsin issued the 
edict "On Liability for Violations of Citizens' Labor Rights," 
which instructs the Prosecutor's Office to pay "special 
attention to preventing cases of delays over paying wages." But 
the edict has essentially never worked. First, as frequently 
happens, there is no sufficiently clear mechanism for 
implementing it; second, in our crazy economy it is by no means 
always possible to find the specific guilty persons; third, what 
can the Prosecutor's Office or a court (which, in any case, are 
swamped with cases) do if an enterprise is up to its eyes in 
debt? 
  In order to ease the acuteness of the situation at least in 
some way, specialists propose temporarily, pending the 
elimination of the nonpayments crisis, to introduce a procedure 
for reserving certain funds for wages in the accounts of 
enterprises (let us assume four to six times the minimum wage 
for each working person). The idea is as follows: Let us say 
that money has come into a plant from a client, the necessary 
sum is at once transferred to a special account, and it is not 
allowed to spend the money on anything but wages -- neither on 
taxes nor for other purposes. According to Valeriy Kolosov, 
Russian Federation first deputy minister of labor, the Ministry 
of Labor sent similar proposals to the Ministry of Finance, and 
the acting minister of finance apparently supported the idea, 
but the matter went no further than this.... Maybe this was 
because the wages of Finance Ministry employees are never 
delayed? 
  Nobody today can say exactly which part of the wages has not 
been paid through the fault of the state (by "clamping down" on 
budget funds -- for the state order, grain sold to the state, 
etc.) and how many debts have arisen because of clumsy 
commercial and economic activity. If, let us assume, a nonstate 
firm is a potential bankrupt and credits [nachislyayet] its 
working people with money which it cannot pay, this is, after 
all, a matter for the firm itself -- think, bustle, restructure 
yourself, find your niche on the market. But when the state 
starts engaging in deception -- that beats everything, as the 
saying goes.... So I ask: For how much of the debt of more 
than R2 trillion is the state responsible? No idea. How is it 
possible to manage the country without knowing such very 
important, fundamental things? 
  In any case the government is obliged, finally, to 
vigorously 
set about resolving these very painful problems. Industry bears 
the lion's share of the wage arrears (according to preliminary 
operational data -- R1.332 trillion). What awaits these 
enterprises? Will state debts be paid, will the process of 
effective structural restructuring, clearing up of finances, and 
bankruptcies of drowning enterprises begin? We cannot go on 
swimming with the tide, hoping that somehow everything will be 
all right of its own accord. The disease is intensifying and 
going deeper, and without effective treatment it could turn into 
a great calamity. Analyzing the first quarter's results and 
observing the government's passivity, you catch yourself 
thinking: Are the premier and his team capable of providing 
such effective treatment? If so, it would be a good thing to 
demonstrate this in practice. I will remind you, incidentally, 
that, as the State Committee for Statistics bears witness, there 
are already 4.4 million unemployed in Russia today (according to 
the International Labor Organization classification). But 
taking into account those who are not fully employed, the total 
potential for unemployment stands at 8.8 million people (11.7 
percent of the economically active population). This is another 
alarm signal.... 
  In conclusion I will cite a fact which can be viewed in two 
ways: The share of the labor remuneration fund in the overall 
volume of monetary incomes has fallen from 65 percent (in the 
first quarter of last year) to 59 percent in January-March 1994. 
That is, the role of wages has diminished somewhat. This is 
because, first, the new rich are passing huge money through 
commercial banks, making a sizable profit, and, second, many 
Russians are increasingly actively seeking somewhere that they 
can earn a bit extra, in addition to their main occupation. 
This "bit extra" almost compares (in size) with their wages. 
On the one hand this is good: The population's enterprise and 
activeness attest to a change in the stereotypes of thinking, to 
a gradual adaptation to the conditions of market economics. But 
there is another side here too: Inadequate wages, not paid on 
time moreover, accustom people to doing hack work and working at 
half stretch in their main job, in order to make a bit more on 
the side.... 
  On the whole, the average monthly real wage, calculated 
with due regard for the consumer prices index, fell 4 percent in 
the first quarter of 1994 (compared with the same period last 
year) and 3 percent in March (compared with last March). By 
comparison with the drop in production, we received even more 
than we earned. This presages a new surge of inflation in the 
second half of April and in May. No, stabilization of the 
standard of living and an increase in it are possible only by 
way of reviving the economy and an effective structural policy. 
No other artificial methods will be able to lead to success....

<F P=106> [Anatoliy Slobozhanyuk "Military Observer's Notes": "NATO </F>
Is Coming To Teach Us"] 
  [Text] These two reports, which created serious alarm 
among our readers, came close together. First the press 
provided information on the upcoming joint exercise by the U.S. 
3d Infantry Division and the Russian 27th Motorized Rifle 
Division for the purpose of rehearsing cooperation in 
peacemaking actions. A little later we learned of the bombing 
strikes by U.S. peacemakers in the south of Bosnia. The 
southern Urals and southern Bosnia are separated by many 
thousands of kilometers, but the upcoming event and the past one 
are tied up in a tight and intricate logical knot. 
  Our own correspondent Ivan Gavrilenko reports that the news 
of the military maneuvers on the Totskiy range elicited a 
sharply negative reaction from the peasants of Orenburg Oblast, 
which was singed by the flash from the first atomic explosion 
conducted in the Soviet Union. 
  Until recently the Totskiy range, where the exercise is 
planned, was top-secret. This region also has other military 
installations which are of undoubted interest to foreign 
specialists, and it has to be thought that the Pentagon will 
certainly not be sending new recruits to Russia. 
  We have managed to ascertain from the Ground Forces Main 
Staff that the measure is being conducted in accordance with the 
plan of contacts between the armed forces of Russia and the 
United States. No more than 250 servicemen will be involved on 
each side. The Americans will land up to 50 units of wheeled 
equipment at the Totskiy Training Center, where they have 
already been to reconnoiter. Joint actions will be rehearsed as 
part of a peacemaking force from 6 through 14 July. 
  A detail of some importance: In the opinion of the military, 
this measure will not require of us any unplanned expenditure, 
since one of the 27th Division's regiments is due to hold a 
planned exercise at precisely that time. But the Americans will 
have to fork out $2 million. They will pay our military to 
operate engineer equipment and for fuel, lubricants, water, 
food, and all the services provided. So there is even an 
opportunity to earn a little currency. 
  In general, the Russian military leaders have, at first 
sight, undertaken a good and profitable thing. It is 
undoubtedly necessary to strengthen and develop contacts between 
the two countries' armies. But how are we to avoid the 
importunate questions of fellow citizens? Why do the Americans 
need to send over their aircraft together with servicemen and 
hardware from the German city of Wuerzburg, where the 3d 
Infantry Division is stationed, right over to the Urals, deep 
inside Russia? Would it not be simpler to hold exercises of a 
very simple nature at Khodynskoye Pole, for example, or 
somewhere in Moscow Oblast? 
  Interest is also aroused by the NATO division's highly 
original service record. It performed "peacemaking" combat 
operations in Korea and Iraq. Where will future itineraries 
take it? To the former Yugoslavia, maybe. General M. Rose, 
commander of the UN troops, needs just such decisive combined 
units. The whole world shuddered at the blasts of the bombs 
dropped by NATO aircraft in southern Bosnia, but the general is 
insisting on new strikes. The U.S. President has pronounced a 
sentence which sounded roughly as follows: We work closely with 
Gen. Rose, and I believe that his aggressiveness is a good thing. 
  Here are peacemakers for you! 
  Our newspaper has already written about the political 
aspects 
of the recent NATO action. Let us touch on the military 
aspects. We are seeing for the umpteenth time that NATO has 
very mediocre airmen in its ranks. Obviously embarrassed, a 
White House official spokesperson recently declared on 
television that one of the U.S. pilots tried to drop four bombs 
on the Serbs, but succeeded in releasing just three, and two of 
them did not explode. It also is not entirely clear what was 
destroyed as a result of the bombing strikes -- a tank or a 
medical vehicle. It is perfectly clear that peaceful people 
died as a result of those raids. 
  It is worth recalling that U.S. pilots were also 
distinguished by similar results in Iraq three years ago: They 
aimed at military targets but hit peaceful houses and even their 
own positions. Incidentally, they have also distinguished 
themselves during these days: They downed two of their own 
helicopters with accurate rocket fire and dispatched 26 officers 
to the next world. 
  The punitive actions undertaken by the United Nations 
without 
coordination with Russia have sharply exacerbated the situation 
and galvanized combat operations by the opposing sides. But 
maybe the politicians will realize that neither bombs nor 
missiles can bring the Serbs to their knees. Only a peaceful 
way out of the crisis will be productive.

  [Text] Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev emphasized 
the necessity for a comprehensive settlement in Bosnia. "We 
cannot keep going from crisis to crisis," he pointed out at a 
meeting with journalists today. 
  "We knew even earlier that Serb words and actions did not 
always mean the same. Within the context of the present 
situation it is necessary to take steps to diminish rather than 
increase this difference," Kozyrev remarked when commenting on 
the developments in Bosnia. He said contradictory information 
was coming from there which hampered the decision-making. 
  Kozyrev admitted that Russia had influence on Serbs. 
However, he stressed pressure must also be exerted on other 
parties, including the Moslems. 
  Kozyrev suggested that Moslems had considered the NATO air 
attacks on the Serb positions as a carte blanche. "They 
continue to provoke Serbs and show no interest in an agreement 
on settlement of the conflict," Kozyrev said. 
  Kozyrev believes that the situation must not be simplified 
and it was not reasonable to mark everybody as "good and bad 
guys" as in a Western. "It is not a Western but an 
ethnically-colored civil war with no right no wrong, no angels 
no devils," he said. 
  Kozyrev called on Russia's Western partners to exercise 
pressure on Moslems in order to conclude a peace agreement. 
Kozyrev confirmed that the Russian position remained the same 
stating that any means could be used for defense of the 
peacekeeping forces, including the military ones. 
  "The problem is that there has been no such need in Gorazde. 
The further confrontation between Moslems and Serbs and the 
blockade of a part of the peacekeeping forces in Bosnia and 
Herzegovina were the consequences, not the reason for the NATO 
air attacks which had not been coordinated with Russia although 
their results could have been predicted," Kozyrev said. 
  Kozyrev believes that now there are three possible ways of 
developing the situation. "The first one is to lose patience 
and to resort to air attacks. This will result in a full-scale 
war as occurred in Vietnam and Afghanistan. However, in this 
case, infantry forces and an expedition corps must be brought to 
Bosnia and Herzegovina with an order to kill if necessary. 
Otherwise, this will remain vain words. The second option is 
to leave Bosnia and Herzegovina completely as it now happens in 
Somalia. The third option, the final one, is to try to 
negotiate and to proceed to a peace agreement on settlement of 
the conflict," Kozyrev clarified. 
  He said he supported the third option. Kozyrev stressed that 
Serbs must be sure that their positive steps would be 
appreciated. "These steps must be conditioned with lessening and 
later with lifting of the sanctions against Belgrade," he 
pointed out. 
  Kozyrev spoke in favor of giving a real sense to the NATO 
program Partnership for Peace. 
  "They propose us just a flirt but we want a firm marriage in 
order to prevent such situations when nobody consults us while 
making important decisions, as occurred in Bosnia and 
Herzegovina," Kozyrev said. 
  Asked by Interfax whether it was certain that NATO would not 
deal a third strike against the Serbs without consulting Russia, 
Kozyrev said is was not reasonable to anticipate the 
developments.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Sergey Babkin and </F>
Yuriy Tyssovskiy] 
  [Text] Moscow, 19 Apr -- "I would most resolutely recommend 
to the Serbian side not to test the patience of the world 
community," Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said today. 
He was speaking to journalists at a news conference after his 
talks with Yasir 'Arafat, chairman of the PLO Executive 
Committee and president of the Palestinian State. 
  It goes without saying, the Russian foreign policy chief 
said, that we call for restraint from all sides in the conflict. 
  Kozyrev spoke highly of the initiative by French Foreign 
Minister Alain Juppe, with whom he had a telephone conversation 
this morning. A. Juppe has proposed that Russia, the United 
States, the European Union, and the United Nations work out, 
once and for all, a united stand on the conflict in Bosnia. 
Andrey Kozyrev called this proposal "highly promising and 
timely." We have long been striving for this, he said, and we 
hope that under the present critical circumstances our American 
friends and partners will treat this initiative seriously. 
Ultimately, this is the minimum we have to achieve -- to have a 
united and well-considered political stand. This could form the 
basis for the formulation of demands to the warring sides, and, 
at the same time, for initiatives that would open up 
opportunities for them, specifically, the lifting of sanctions 
as the demands of the world community are met.

one Russian diplomat said. 
  Another ministry official told Interfax that "much, if not

  [Text] "Russia must stop any conversations with Bosnian 
Serbs. The time for conversations is over. Bosnian Serbs must 
realize that Russia embodies a great power and not a banana 
republic," the Russian president's Special Envoy, Deputy Russian 
Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin told journalists today at the 
airport on his return from a nine-day visit to former Yugoslavia. 
  Churkin considered the situation in Bosnia as still complex. 
"If things do not improve, there will be no way to discuss 
lifting of international sanctions against Serbia," Churkin 
stressed. 
  He said the Russian policy in ex-Yugoslavia was a "policy of 
a great power." "Relations with the Serbs can be expressed in a 
simple formula: when Serbs were stating that the whole world 
was against them we agreed under the condition that they would 
follow our instructions. Instead of this, Bosnian Serbs use 
Russian policy as a shield," Churkin emphasized. 
  In his opinion, during the recent crisis in Gorazde the 
Serbs 
should have stopped their offensive on the city. "There were 
possibilities to prevent the aggravation of the situation. 
Originally, Serbs offered to send a group of UN observers to 
their positions near Gorazde. When the Russian side got in 
touch with UN officials and agreed on the issue, the offer had 
already been rejected. As a result, the grave crisis in Bosnia 
aggravated even further," Churkin said. 
  He said that the Bosnian Serbs repeatedly gave assurances 
about the end of fighting near Gorazde. "Unfortunately, the 
meetings between the Serbs and the UN representatives mediated 
by Russia turned out to be fruitless. The Serbs did not show 
any readiness or sincere willingness to agree. They were just 
wasting time," Churkin said. 
  Churkin expressed confidence that "if the Bosnian Serbs 
continue their offensive on Gorazde and fire at least one round 
towards the city, there will be a huge crisis which will bring 
the Serb people into the catastrophe." 
  In Churkin's opinion, "a small group of Bosnian Serbs have 
become mad on war." 
  "Russia should decide whether it should allow a group of 
extremists to use the policy of Russia for achieving their 
goals. Our response is simple -- never. If somebody tries to 
play with Russia's policy, Russia will respond as can be 
expected from a great power," Churkin said.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Peresada report under the rubric "The New World </F>
Order in Action": "The Bosnian `Flop'"] 
  [Text] Brussels, 15 Apr -- Is the North Atlantic alliance 
headquarters here in Brussels taking into account the position 
of Russia, which reacted highly negatively to the NATO air 
strikes against "Serb targets" in the Gorazde region? It goes 
without saying that it is. The only question is -- how. 
  These days I am in constant telephone contact with the 
alliance's press service, which, in its turn, sends out daily 
reports on Bosnia by fax or by express mail. Here, for example, 
is one of the latest reports containing information on 
Wednesday's North Atlantic Council session on this subject. It 
took place after several demarches by Moscow and the statement 
by President Yeltsin, who was unhappy that the West had made the 
decision to bomb the Serb positions without consulting with 
Russia. There was also a statement from the Russian Foreign 
Ministry, which warned against any new NATO ultimatum to the 
Bosnian Serbs, and the session of the State Duma which condemned 
NATO's raids. What decisions were reached in Brussels against 
that backdrop? 
  As for new ultimatums -- nothing was decided. None of the 16 
member countries even raised that question either with regard to 
Gorazde or to other regions declared "safe areas" by the United 
Nations. Obviously there is no need for that because, unlike 
the situation around Sarajevo, the mechanism for the use of 
force in the Gorazde region could be worked out without prior 
threats. 
  Now about the raids themselves. On the eve of Wednesday's 
North Atlantic Council session I talked about this with several 
NATO diplomats. Some shrug their shoulders in incomprehension, 
others spread their hands in equal bewilderment, while others 
answer the question with a question: "What do you want? After 
all, the legal basis for this exists and Moscow itself took part 
in its creation." 
  In view of Russia's interests in the Balkans one can and 
undoubtedly should be incensed at NATO's bombing raids and 
condemn them, but that should be done now, before it is too 
late. In the recent past those who are responsible for Russian 
foreign policy had somewhat different priorities in the Bosnian 
crisis and in relations with the West in general than they do 
now. Is it not clear that it is largely due to those priorities 
that NATO, without abandoning strong-arm decisions in principle, 
has managed not only to create for itself the image of a "Balkan 
peacemaker" but also to ensure for itself an international legal 
basis for practical "assistance in establishing peace" in the 
former Yugoslavia? 
  That is how NATO regards UN Security Council Resolution 836 
adopted on 4 June 1993 in connection with the raids in the 
Gorazde region. Russia voted for it. A mistake? Moscow 
prefers not to talk openly about that right now, but you can 
judge for yourselves. The NATO people, however, with such a 
"legal backing" behind them, are saying clearly: "We are acting 
on the basis of the Security Council decision in giving `close 
air support' to the UN forces in Bosnia when danger threatens 
them. These actions are being carried out with the sanction of 
the UN Secretary General's representative and the UN command in 
Bosnia. We are merely carrying out orders." 
  In such a situation what need is there for consultations 
with 
Russia?

  [Text] Helsinki, 18 Apr -- Russo-Finnish relations, 
prospects for Russia's entry in the Council of Europe, and 
settlement of the Bosnia-Herzegovina conflict were topical at 
today's meeting between Russia's State Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin 
and Finnish Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto. Ivan Rybkin is 
visiting Finland at the head of a Russian parliamentary 
delegation. 
  During the discussion the two sides expressed concern over 
mounting tensions in Bosnia and voiced their common viewpoint 
view that the conflict in former Yugoslavia must be settled 
through negotiations and not through the use of force. Ivan 
Rybkin stressed that any use of military force can only be 
permitted with UN approval and following mandatory consultations 
with all permanent members of the UN Security Council. 
  While discussing Russia's entry into the Council of Europe, 
the State Duma chairman and the Finnish foreign minister noted 
that this step would be in the interests of the entire region, 
since Russia cannot be sidelined in European integration 
process. Heikki Haavisto reaffirmed Finland's commitment to 
contribute toward Russia's speedy acceptance into the Council of 
Europe.

Mostovets] 
  [Text] Helsinki April 18 TASS -- Russian State Duma 
Chairman Ivan Rybkin called on Bosnian Serbs to show restraint 
and support the process of political settlement in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Speaking at a news conference in Helsinki on Monday, Rybkin 
said that owing to Russia's efforts a safety belt is now being 
established around Gorazde, similar to that around Sarajevo. He 
pointed out that "Serbia is a bare nerve of Europe," adding that 
for the first time since 1945 this state which has never joined 
any bloc is bombed. 
  He assured the journalists that the "State Duma will take 
the 
necessary measures to facilitate a peaceful settlement of the 
Bosnian crisis." 
  Asked about the prospects for Russia's joining NATO's 
Partnership for Peace programme, Rybkin linked it to NATO air 
strikes on Bosnian Serb positions. In his view, the 
participation in the NATO programme presupposes some sort of 
"family relations." "But in a good family every member tells 
what he intends to do," he said. 
  "We are for partnership for peace, but we do not want to see 
a situation when one partner acts without consulting the other 
in this partnership." 
  Summing up the results of his visit to Finland, Rybkin said 
that his talks with Finnish leaders, industrialists, farmers and 
public figures were useful and fruitful. "We say in Russia: an 
old friend is worth two new ones. Three days of hard work and 
very good and intensive meetings have proved the validity of 
this saying," he said. 
  During the talks the sides discussed a wide range of issues 
connected with the expansion of relations between Russia and 
Finland in all spheres, including their interaction in the 
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Nordic 
Council, the Council of Europe, the European bank for 
Reconstruction and Development and other international and 
regional organisations. 
  Speaking about the prospects for Russia's accession to the 
Council of Europe, Rybkin noted that the process of adopting a 
decision on this issue has obviously been dragging on for too 
long. Some connect this with the withdrawal of Russian troops 
from the Baltic republics. Russia is interested in the soonest 
possible return of its soldiers no less than any other concerned 
state. But the talks with some Baltic states proceed no exactly 
in the way Russia would like them to go, he continued. 
  Rybkin said he has requested Finnish leaders to mediate the 
process in order to find a solution to the problem.

  [Text] PLO Executive Committee Chairman Yasir 'Arafat 
begins an official visit to Moscow on 19 April. On the eve of 
his visit, Yasir 'Arafat gave an exclusive interview to a 
correspondent for our information agency at the PLO headquarters 
in Tunis: 
  [Begin 'Arafat recording in Arabic with superimposed Russian 
translation] Russia has played an active role in the Near East 
peace process ever since it started. The Russian foreign 
minister and the U.S. secretary of state stood alongside myself 
and the Israeli prime minister when the Washington agreement on 
the principles of a settlement was signed. 
  It was precisely thanks to the recent increase in Russian 
diplomatic activity, Yasir 'Arafat continues, that certain 
difficulties which arose in the negotiating process were 
overcome, allowing it to resume in Cairo. The peace talks are 
being held not just in the interests of the Palestinians or the 
Israelis. They are in the interests of all mankind. Realizing 
this, and undertaking efforts in this direction, we have 
achieved those results which only became possible because of the 
peace talks. [end recording] 
  [Correspondent] To conclude his short interview, Yasir 
'Arafat noted that there has been a durable and friendly 
relationship between Palestinians and Russia for many years now. 
But in looking ahead he would like to point out that in future 
there could be new developments in this relationship because of 
the possibility of cooperation in the repair of infrastructure 
in the Palestinian autonomous areas, the training of personnel, 
and other spheres. 
  He takes this opportunity to pass on the warmest and most 
sincere greetings to the peoples of Russia.

<F P=106> [Report by Ivan Menshikov of RIA-NOVOSTI for IZVESTIYA, on </F>
interview with PLO Leader Yasir 'Arafat in Tunis on 13 April: 
"'Arafat Grateful to Yeltsin for Invitation, But Not Really 
Counting on Successful Mediation by Moscow"] 
  [Text] Tunis -- Yasir 'Arafat is certainly not 
experiencing the best days of his life as he prepares for his 
trip to Moscow, where he first went as a student back in 1955. 
  Those close to him say that, even during the days of 
defending Beirut against Israeli troops or during the siege of 
the Lebanese city of Tripoli by the Syrian Army, the Palestinian 
leader was never so worried as he is today. 
  He has staked his all by agreeing to separate peace with 
Israel 13 September 1993. But after nine months of persistent 
talks, the results are very modest: Not a single one of the 
interim agreements has been observed. On 13 April 'Arafat was 
to have already installed himself, together with his 
administration, in Jericho, and the Israeli troops were to have 
left. Instead, I am talking to him in his same old modest 
office in Tunis in which everything was ready for the move three 
months ago. 
  "Despite the fact that we are firmly maintaining our 
commitment to the peace process," 'Arafat stressed, "we are 
forced to point out the attempts by the Israeli side to delay 
and thwart the schedule for the implementation of agreements we 
have already reached." 
  The Israeli Government's "free interpretation" of the signed 
agreements, whose quintessence is reflected by what Prime 
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said -- "For us there are no sacred 
deadlines" -- is putting the Palestinians out of countenance. 
  It is this attitude by the Israeli Government that has 
allowed extremists on both sides to organize themselves and step 
up their joint offensive against the peace process, 'Arafat 
believes. 
  That is possibly precisely why the Palestinian leader did 
not 
look too enthusiastic about the upcoming talks in Moscow. When 
asked whether he believes in the success of Russian endeavors to 
mediate between them and Premier Rabin, who is nowadays also 
preparing for his first official trip to Moscow, he answered 
laconically: "That would be highly desirable." 
  "The first Soviet-Palestinian political contacts were made 
in 
1968 when Jamal 'Abd-al-Nasir took me to Moscow and presented me 
there," 'Arafat explained, smiling for the first time during the 
almost one-hour long interview, given on the eve of his trip to 
Moscow. "We were received by Brezhnev straight away." 
  'Arafat kept silent about what the Kremlin leaders discussed 
with the Palestinian nationalist-capitalist, but the main thing 
is obvious: The PLO received political and military support. 
But that is not the most surprising thing, nor is it how he 
managed to get on with all the general secretaries from Brezhnev 
to Gorbachev; the most surprising thing is how he managed to 
maintain good relations with Moscow even after August 1991. In 
the first few months after the failure of the putsch, he was 
counted among the "sworn enemies" of the new Russian democracy, 
together with Saddam Husayn, Kim Il-song, and Mu'ammar 
al-Qadhdhafi, whereas today Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev flies to Tunis in order to give him an official 
invitation from Russian President Boris Yeltsin to visit Russia. 
Furthermore, the Russian minister is praising the "courage and 
political insight of the chairman of the PLO Executive 
Committee." 
  'Arafat is a realist and a pragmatist, who has studied the 
political machinations of the Near East thoroughly. He 
understands perfectly well that everyone can end up in a 
difficult position. Only a few know how to get out of them with 
honor. Suffice it to recall that, having expressed "moderate 
sympathy" for Iraq during the Gulf War, and having lost the 
support of rich sponsors in the Gulf, not to mention the United 
States and West Europe, 'Arafat was able to focus the attention 
of the international community, and primarily the "victorious" 
U.S. Administration of President Bush, on the fact that the 
smoldering Arab-Israeli conflict in the Near East would 
regularly provide this kind of setback if the process of a Near 
East settlement did not begin. 
  To give the Palestinian leader his due, he has always tried 
to maintain the impression of the equal importance of the two 
powers sponsoring world talks in the Near East. At times you 
get the impression that he even plays up to Russia's desire to 
appear more important in the region than it actually is today. 
He tactfully left unanswered the question about who blocked 
Moscow's proposal to conduct a new "Madrid-2" multilateral 
meeting, although U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's 
letter, which demands that 'Arafat give up supporting any 
"unsanctioned" initiatives, is well known in diplomatic circles 
in the Tunisian capital. 
  As for sending a Russian contingent to Palestine to protect 
the civilian population, then 'Arafat stressed that the presence 
of Russian observers in Palestine side by side with Americans is 
not only desirable, but even follows from the actual text of UN 
Security Council Resolution No. 904.

  [Text] Moscow, 19 Apr -- State Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin 
today met with PLO Executive Committee Chairman Yasir 'Arafat. 
During the meeting, Yasir 'Arafat expressed confidence that the 
Russian side will render necessary assistance in implementing 
the recent agreements between the PLO and Israel, of which 
Russia and the United States are cosponsors. At the same time, 
Yasir 'Arafat noted that there have been recent "attempts to 
depart from the agreement and to push the Russian Federation to 
the sidelines in this process." 
  For his part, Ivan Rybkin told journalists after the meeting 
that "the Russian side favors the unconditional implementation 
of all UN Security Council resolutions concerning a peace 
settlement in the Middle East." The State Duma chairman said he 
hopes the agreement between the PLO and Israel "will be 
implemented without double standards." "I hope the last Israeli 
soldier will soon leave the occupied territories and free 
parliamentary elections will take place there to which the Duma 
will send its observers," Ivan Rybkin said.

Yeltsin met visiting PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat in the Grand 
Kremlin Palace today. 
  Welcoming the PLO chairman, Yeltsin said that Russia "is 
making efforts to support you politically, especially now that a 
negotiating process between PLO and Israel has begun." The 
Russian president pointed out that "our position alongside the 
position of the United States is very important". 
  Yeltsin pointed out that Russia understands PLO claims to 
Israel. In his opinion, after the meeting the negotiating 
process will go ahead more successfully. Yeltsin pointed out, 
in particular, that "we had invited Israeli Prime Minister 
Yitzhaq Rabin to visit Moscow next week" so as to avoid a break 
in the talks. 
  The meeting was attended by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev and presidential aide for international affairs, Dmitriy 
Ryurikov.

  [Text] Russia attaches great importance to the visit to 
Moscow by the PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat (he is to arrive Tuesday 
at 18:00 at the government airport Vnukovo-2 -- "IF"). The 
statement was made in an interview with Interfax by the special 
representative of the Russian president, director of the Russian 
Foreign Ministry Middle East department, Viktor Posuvalyuk. 
  He said this would be the first visit by 'Arafat to the new 
democratic Russia where he is to meet Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin. The meeting is planned for 15:00 on April 19 in the 
Kremlin. 
  Posuvalyuk said that for Russia which along with the United 
States is a co-sponsor of the peace process in the Middle East, 
it is important to have a first-hand assessment by the 
Palestinian leader of the state of things at the 
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. The two sides will discuss 
the practical implementation of the Israeli-Palestinian 
Declaration on Principles signed in Washington last September, 
he said. 
  Posuvalyuk said that Israeli troops were to leave the Gaza 
Strip and Jerico shortly. So it would be good to speak about 
the prospects for trade and economic relations with the 
Palestinian territories, he said. 
  Posuvalyuk said that 'Arafat is to meet Tuesday with Russian 
Interior Minister Viktor Yerin (11:00, 16 Zhitnaya St -- "IF"). 
Both sides will discuss the request by Palestinians on 
assistance to them in creating and equipping the police force, 
he said. After the territories are liberated they are to be 
kept under control; naturally, the key role is to be played by 
the Palestinian police, which must be well-equipped, Posuvalyuk 
said. 
  Speaking about the situation at the Israeli-Palestinian 
talks, Posuvalyuk said that it raises cautious optimism. 
Nevertheless, there is hope that late in April-early in May the 
two sides will manage to sign an agreement on the Gaza Strip and 
Jerico, he said. 
  Posuvalyuk believes it is symbolic that Israeli Prime 
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin will arrive in Moscow on April 24-27 
after Yasir 'Arafat.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Sychev report: "Pentagon Asks Airmen in Iraq to </F>
Be Less Aggressive"] 
  [Excerpts] The 26 people on board the two U.S. helicopters 
downed by U.S. fighters over Northern Iraq probably died as the 
result of a mistake by the fighter pilots or technical faults. 
They were the victims of Washington's intransigent anti-Iraqi 
policy. 
  The two Black Hawk helicopters with U.S., British, French, 
and Turkish officers from the UN mission on board were flying to 
a meeting with the Kurdish insurgent leader Salakhaddin when 
they were shot down in broad daylight by two missiles fired from 
the two F-15 fighters. [passage omitted] 
  The war against Iraq ended in 1991, but Washington's policy 
toward Iraq remains warlike in tone and is marked by an 
unconcealed hostility toward Baghdad. It is patently obvious 
that the U.S. airmen, who were monitoring the safe haven in 
northern Iraq which was created soon after the Persian Gulf 
campaign to prevent Iraqi air raids on Kurdish camps, were 
influenced by the mood of official Washington. It is no 
coincidence that the Pentagon has issued several orders aimed at 
"curbing the aggressiveness" of the U.S. airmen serving in the 
safe havens in south and north Iraq and in Bosnia.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS military analyst Vladimir Gondusov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow April 19 TASS -- The talks and consultations 
on the Black Sea Fleet which provoked a discord between Russia 
and Ukraine in the recent past, will need mutual concessions on 
both sides but should be held by all means in line with the 
agreement on the fleet which was signed by Boris Yeltsin and 
Leonid Kravchuk in Moscow on April 15, a high-ranking officer of 
the Russian Navy who refused to be identified, told ITAR-TASS on 
Tuesday. 
  On the other hand, he added, naval experts are apprehensive 
that the document opening the road to understandings on the 
Black Sea Fleet, can be doomed to the same fate as the Massandra 
Protocol singed by the two leaders last September, as well as 
earler understandings on this difficult problem. Incidentally, 
the protocol had clear benchmarks. 
  Experience showed that the adoption of documents does not 
mean real moves by the Ukrainian side to settle the fleet's 
problems. 
  Military sources in Moscow and Sevastopol report that 
pressure on Russian servicemen continues in Izmail and Ochakov 
even in the course of ten days which were given to draft an 
agreement on the division of the Black Sea Fleet, in order to 
force them to take the oath of allegience to Ukraine. Earlier, 
similar attempts were made in Odessa and Nikolayev. 
  Military experts believe that the Moscow agreement on the 
Black Sea Fleet has quite a number of "reefs". They note that, 
under the agreement, Sevastopol, the main base of the Black Sea 
Fleet, is not to have facilities of the Ukrainian Navy. 
  But it is highly improbable that Kiev will agree to this, 
although it understands that the two powerful administrative 
structures cannot rub elbows endlessly. 
  The cost of the Black Sea Fleet is another difficult problem 
to be tackled by Ukraine and Russia while settling the destiny 
of the fleet. One can count on serious progress in this sphere 
only after the fleet's assessment as well as the calculation of 
damage inflicted by Ukraine on Russia by "the lop-sided 
privatisation" of fleet ships (the figure reached 60 in two 
years' time). 
  Experts stress that the fate of the Black Sea Fleet can be 
sealed only on certain conditions which Ukraine should fulfill. 
For instance, it should not take lop-sided actions which will 
challenge the sincerety of the negotiating process. 
  That was the essence of the warning issued by the Russian 
president's press secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov on April 16 who 
said that the Ukrainian side, applying its usual "oozy" manner, 
started interpreting the understandings reached by the Russian 
and Ukrainian presidents in Moscow. 
  It began putting forth its own formulas concerning the 
lease, 
its periods and places of the fleet's deployment even before 
talks provided for by the agreement started.

<F P=106> [Sergey Leskov report: "As a Reward for Its Long-Suffering, </F>
`Gazprom' Hopes To Receive the Port of Odessa From Ukraine"] 
  [Text] Apart from everything else, the development of the 
conflict between "Gazprom" and Ukraine will make us delighted 
with the surgical genius who bound the economies of the 
fraternal republics together in such a way that it would be more 
correct to call them "Siamese twins." This conclusion can be 
drawn from the results of the Moscow talks between Ukrainian 
First Vice Premier Valentin Landyk and "Gazprom" Chairman Rem 
Vyakhirev. 
  They agreed that Ukraine's debt to the Russian gas industry 
is now $600 million, and that it will be paid off in the second 
quarter of 1994. However, you can read between the lines that 
neither of the sides is particularly relying on regular debt 
payments from Ukraine's empty budget pocket. For the first 
time, "Gazprom" did not threaten its neighbor with discontinuing 
supplies, and it did not mention the International Court. Gas 
is flowing through the pipeline, and will continue to flow. It 
is now obvious to everyone that it would primarily be Russia, 
which receives longed-for currency from the West for the export 
of gas, that would suffer from turning off the tap. 
  In this connection, the increasingly frequently mentioned 
possibility of "Gazprom" receiving property on the territory of 
Ukraine rather than money is acquiring particular significance. 
This time, apart from underground tanks and gas pipelines, 
Valentin Landyk has promised to give "Gazprom" a pretty fair 
part of the port of Odessa. The only thing that puts you on you 
guard is the simple fact that as the generosity of Kiev's 
proposals to the Russian gas industry increases, the clearer it 
becomes that these promises are unrealizable in practical terms. 
Foreign property on Ukraine's territory is not protected by 
legislation, and parliament has already had a sharply negative 
reaction to "Gazprom" having a share in a previous, narrower 
list of enterprises. As a result, the joint working group which 
is to coordinate the mechanism for turning the enterprises 
promised to "Gazprom" into joint-stock enterprises is getting 
practically nowhere in its activity.

  [Text] The Russian-Estonian commission controlling the 
observance of the treaty on the principles of bilateral 
relations proposed that the Russian and Estonian foreign 
ministries and state delegations "freeze" the border issue for 
ten years, the commission's co-chairman Nikolay Medvedev told 
Interfax on Tuesday. 
  He said that Russia favored the idea of demarcating the 
Estonian- Russian border and granting it a state status. 
"Estonia has neither directly accepted it, nor objected to it 
in principle," he said. 
  The border dispute between Russia and Estonia still remains 
unsettled. Tallinn does not recognize the current borders, 
because in accordance with the Tartu treaty signed back in 1920, 
Estonia included some of the regions which were joined to Russia 
during and after World War II. 
  "We want to secede from Russia with the same territory we 
had 
when we joined it," the commission co-chairman Enn Leison told 
Interfax. He pointed out, however, that Estonia did not seek 
the return of the territories in which ethnic Russians 
constituted 60 percent. "We wouldn't like to have non-natives 
added to Estonia," he said. 
  On April 18 and 19, the commission members met in Moscow to 
discuss social guarantees for Russian military pensioners living 
in Estonia, and the most favored nations trade regime provided 
for in the bilateral treaty. 
  The next session will be held in Estonia on May 15.

  [Text] Russia's joint stock company Gazprom cut gas supply 
to Moldova by one third because of that republic's debt totaling 
131 billion rubles by April 1, 1994. This was reported to 
Interfax by a well-placed Gazprom source. The company's current 
gas supply to Moldova amounts to 5.7 million cubic meters a day. 
  This year Moldova has not paid a single ruble to Gazprom, 
compensating for Russian gas partly in food supplies. 
  A Russo-Moldovan agreement signed at the end of 1993 commits 
Moldova to supplying to Gazprom $145 million worth in food 
stuffs and consumer goods in partial payment for the delivery of 
up to 3.5 billion cubic meters of Russian gas. 
  Moldova now pays $80 for 1000 cubic meters of gas. To 
transport Russian gas across Moldova into Romania costs $1.5 per 
1000 cubic meters of gas over 100 kilometers of pipeline. 
  Meanwhile, the talks between a Belarusian Government 
delegation and Gazprom officials, scheduled for mid-April, have 
been put off indefinitely because of the signing of a monetary 
integration accord. During the negotiations the sides were to 
look over the fulfillment of a Russo-Belarusian protocol on 
paying off the debt for Russian gas. This accord was signed on 
March 15, 1994.

  [Text] Russia's ex-finance minister Boris Fedorov believes 
that a merger of the Belarussian [Belarusian] and Russian 
monetary systems will actually mean that every Belarussian 
citizen, including infants, will receive $67 from the Russian 
tax-payer's pocket. 
  He made this statement during the discussion "The Future of 
the Russian Economic Reform," held in St. Petersburg on the eve 
of the annual conference of the EBRD managers. 
  To quote Fedorov, the decision on the merger of the two 
monetary systems reflects the Russian Cabinet's inconsistent 
policies at a moment when Russia has approached financial 
stabilization. 
  Deputy Finance Minister Andrey Kazmin admitted that by 
signing this agreement with Minsk, Moscow was running a risk. 
He noted, however, that Belarus had accepted Russia's key 
demand for subordinating the National Bank of Belarus to the 
Central Bank of Russia.

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Asia" program] </F>
  [Text] At a meeting with foreign reporters, foreign 
diplomats, and foreign businessmen, DPRK President Kim Il-song 
declared that the DPRK would not accept the inspections by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] of two undeclared 
nuclear facilities. Station commentator (Aleksey Kontrachev) 
indicates that the DPRK president once more made clear the 
DPRK's position regarding the inspection of the radiochemical 
laboratory and another nuclear site in Yongbyon. 
  According to the IAEA's opinion, the two sites are producing 
plutonium needed for nuclear weapons. Other countries, as well, 
have the same suspicion. Neighboring countries, in particular, 
harbor such suspicion. 
  However, President Kim Il-song said: Pyongyang has nothing 
to 
hide from the world. It is natural that the DPRK has its own 
military secrets as other countries do, he added. 
  However, can the DPRK president's remarks alleviate the 
international community's concerns? 
  The IAEA holds that all nuclear sites should accept the 
IAEA's inspection without exception. Pyongyang's refusal to 
accept the IAEA's inspection has further aggravated tension on 
the peninsula, let alone creating suspicion of the nuclear 
facilities. 
  It has been reported that the UN Security Council will 
actively discuss the issue of imposing international economic 
sanctions on the DPRK in early May. 
  Now, how can the present stalemate be settled? Pyongyang 
believes that this stalemate can be settled through direct 
dialogue between the DPRK and the United States. 
  (?The international community) is seeking other ways. 
Washington has set some preconditions for its direct dialogue 
with the DPRK. Pyongyang is refuting some of these 
preconditions. It seems that Moscow's proposal will be able to 
settle the stalemate. Moscow proposes that an international 
conference be held to discuss the issue on the denuclearization 
of the Korean peninsula. 
  Seoul and some other countries support Moscow's proposal.

an order on the deployment of its formations. The order said 
this was necessary as preparations for the state of emergency, 
the Chechen State Security Department told INTERFAX. 
  The commanders of the formations were ordered to open fire 
for effect without warning in case of an armed attack or 
resistance. 
  Commenting on this order, Deputy Chief of the State Security 
Department, Ayub Satuyev, said in an interview with INTERFAX 
that more energetic actions were expected from Monday on the 
part of the opposition forces in Chechnya. He announced that a 
group of persons recruited for the destabilization of the 
situation in the Republic had been arrested. 
  The security department formations will prevent unauthorized 
rallies and hostile actions against aliens. 
  "The leadership has enough power and means to halt enemies 
of 
the people. We will undertake the toughest measures towards the 
opposition," Satuyev stated. He suggested that Grozny would 
never again allow any actions similar to the ones in April and 
June 1993, when the rallies lasted for weeks.

"Ingushetia Urges Introduction of Federal Rule in State of

  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] Ingushetia's parliament 
yesterday discussed the situation in the state of emergency zone 
and passed a decree "On the Situation in the Zone Affected by 
the State of Emergency on North Ossetia and Ingushetia 
Territories and Measures to Uphold Citizens' Rights." The 
decree says that while Russian Federation laws do not work in 
the state of emergency zone, the rights of Russian citizens are 
being trampled, and the Provisional Administration has shown 
that it is completely incapable of stabilizing the situation. 
Ingushetia's parliament sees the suspension of local bodies of 
power of North Ossetia in Prigorodnyy Rayon and the introduction 
of direct federal rule on this territory as the only way out of 
the crisis. Ingushetia's parliament has forwarded to the 
Russian Federation president a special statement to this effect.

  [Text] North Ossetia will cut short any attempt to wreck 
its current talks with Ingushetia, said an expert from the North 
Ossetian delegation to the negotiations between the two Russian 
Republics. In an interview with INTERFAX on Monday, he 
expressed the hope that the two sides would ultimately sign a 
final accord. "We wish to live in peace and intend to persuade 
the Ingush side to take the same position," he said. 
  North Ossetia believes it is impossible to stabilize the 
situation in the zone of the conflict between the two Republics 
unless Ingushetia gives up its claim to North Ossetia's 
Prigorodny District, the expert said. But he said none of the 
documents drawn up by the Ingush side had a provision to that 
effect. "In Kislovodsk, we agreed that we would not interfere 
into each other's internal affairs, but the Ingushes' claim to 
North Ossetian territory is precisely an instance of such 
interference," he said. 
  The expert said that, at the second round of talks, which 
ended on Friday, it had been suggested that North Ossetia's 
leadership get in direct contact with Ingush refugees wishing to 
return to Prigorodny District. "To date we only have 14,000 
applications from Ingushes, but, at the same time, we know that 
not all of the 40,000 wish to come back," he said. 
  According to some sources, the third round of talks is 
tentatively scheduled to start in a week. Meanwhile, experts on 
both sides will be working on the agreements, the sources told 
INTERFAX.

  [Text] Kazan -- Tataria Vice Premier Ravil Muratov has 
stated that a balance of "promarketeers" and conservatives will 
be ensured in the new government which is to be formed before 
September. According to him, there is a need to cut the number 
of vice premiers, replace the Cabinet of Ministers' sectoral 
departments with an institution of referents, and reduce the 
number of ministries and committees. Muratov also considers it 
necessary to create an analytical center to formulate government 
strategy. The vice prime minister proposes setting up a 
so-called Republican Agricultural Chamber, regarding it, along 
with Tataria's Chamber of Industry and Commerce, as the main 
opponents to the Cabinet of Ministers.

<F P=106> [From the "Pacific Ocean" program] </F>
  [Text] Sakhalin Oblast Duma has held its first session and 
discussed organizational issues. Our Sakhalin correspondent 
Lyudmila Filippova shares her impressions of this session. 
  [Begin Recording] [Filippova] A session of deputies was held 
in the smaller hall of the oblast administration. Both the 
deputies of our oblast duma and their guests had plenty of space 
to themselves. This is hardly surprising, because there were 
only 12 deputies at the first session, just like the disciples 
of Christ -- 11 men and one woman. The first session of the 
first oblast duma was opened by Nikolay Svetkin, who is the 
director of Aleksandrovskiy pedagogical institute. He invited 
Viktor Kleptsov, chairman of the oblast election commission, to 
report on the results of elections to the oblast duma, which we 
actually already knew about -- the elections in election 
district No.1 in central Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk were announced void. 
In other words, there was no one to represent a significant 
number of voters from the center at the first session. You can 
see for yourself who sat at the duma session: Sergey Osimov from 
the Korsakov base of ocean fishing; Viktor Kudryavtsev who is 
also a fisherman -- director of Korsakov cannery; (Kim Pak 
Toki), chairman of Korsakov (Renbok Ltd.) joint stock company; 
Fedor Sidorenko, mayor of Dolinsk; Igor Revin, economist of 
Kholmsk Commercial Bank; Leonid Osipov, mayor of the town of 
Shakhtersk; Lyubov Shubina from Nevelsk, who temporarily does 
not work; Ivan Zhdakayev, whom we know through his activity as a 
deputy during the Soviet era, and who is now deputy director of 
the innovative Sakhalin Foundation and still lives in the 
Pervomayskiy settlement in Smirnykhovskiy Rayon; Nikolay 
Dochilov, a doctor from Uglegorsk; Yuriy Kuts, deputy director 
of Sakhalineftestroy company from Okha; and Valiula Maksutov, 
chief of exploration drilling from the Val settlement in 
Noglikskiy rayon. They all represent voters of Kholmskiy, 
Korsakov and, furthest of all, Tymovskiy electoral districts. 
Until reelection in election district No.1 which, as Kleptsov 
announced, will be taking place on 30 October -- although I 
think the deputies will consider this and might either speed up 
or delay the elections -- the deputies will decide on issues 
connected with legislative initiatives in our oblast. 
  A representative of the oblast administration, namely Vice 
Governor Vladimir Shopoval, also came to congratulate the 
deputies. He remarked that the duma would be working under 
difficult conditions, with people tired from battles between the 
branches of power, and with worsening living standards as the 
background. I certainly agree with this, with the part about 
living standards. Only recently I saw an old woman in oblast 
center in Lenin Street. She leaned against a kiosk -- blackened 
mouth, haggard face -- and when she looked at me I thought this 
is how hunger looks; it is still hiding but it exists and quite 
possible may take to the streets. Therefore, it is still the 
ordinary citizens who suffer the most, and not everyone can take 
the adversity offered by the Russian leaders. 
  Anatoliy Aksenov, former chairman of Oblast Soviet, also 
congratulated the deputies. He remarked that the Oblast Soviet 
deputies started with much fanfare four years ago, but ended 
rather sadly. However, the duma deputies enter their term 
modestly and under difficult conditions, so they might end up 
better too. 
  The oblast administration has already prepared the mechanism 
for fruitful work. Boris Tretyak, member of the State Duma who 
recently arrived in Sakhalin, commented that he hoped for 
efficient cooperation between the State Duma and Sakhalin Oblast 
Duma. Only then will joint productive solutions to problems 
troubling the Sakhalin residents become possible. 
  After presenting deputies' certificates and uttering 
plaudits, the duma went for a break. I approached Deputy 
Valiula Maksutov from the settlement of Val of the Noglikskiy 
Rayon. Could you share with us your ideas about the duma? What 
will it be able to do? 
  [Maksutov] We came here to work, and our only goal is 
influencing the existing situation so as not only to liberalize 
it but to give it the chance to develop, and give the producers 
a chance to work. 
  [Filippova] Will you work on a professional basis? 
  [Maksutov] I can not say yet. 
  [Filippova] You have not decided this for yourself yet? 
  [Maksutov] It is not that I have not decided for myself. I 
represent the interests of northern regions; we will discuss it 
and act in a way that will benefit all voters whom we represent. 
In other words, we will discuss this question among ourselves. 
  [Filippova] Is it a normal phenomenon that all issues 
pertaining to the oblast are decided by representatives of the 
outlying regions? 
  [Maksutov] We have expressed the opinion that elections 
should be held earlier, maybe even in June. But I think we will 
have to take into consideration the lack of deputies from 
Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk. 
  [Filippova] Our province has always felt discriminated 
against as compared to the oblast center in terms of finance, 
but today no one can influence your opinion. I think you are 
fairly independent now. This is a unique situation. 
  [Maksutov] This is a normal situation, and it might even be 
good. What is bad is the fact that elections in the election 
district No.1 failed. Let me repeat that we have no intentions 
whatsoever of infringing upon the interests of those not present 
here today. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, president of the </F>
Republic of Kalmykia, by Sergey Kostornoy; date and place not 
given: "Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, President of the Republic of 
Kalmykia: `Russia Must Be One Country for All'"] 
  [Text] Until quite recently, few people had heard of this 
man. He is a graduate of the Moscow State Institute of 
International Relations and an entrepreneur. Now Kirsan 
Ilyumzhinov is one of the most respected politicians in Russia. 
He is spoken of as a man capable of getting really big things 
done. This is indeed so. This successful businessman began by 
suddenly declaring his desire to become president of Kalmykia. 
Then, after achieving power given to him by the overwhelming 
majority of the people, he disbanded the Kalmyk Soviet of 
People's Deputies on 30 April last year, the first time that 
such a thing had been done in Russia. But on 4 October last 
year, when Soviet power was coming under fire before the eyes of 
the whole stunned world, he stood up between the sides, well 
aware that at that moment the sights of the snipers' rifles were 
trained on him. 
  Now he has accomplished a new feat. For the sake of the 
unification of Russia Ilyumzhinov proposed on 11 March at an 
enlarged session of the Republic of Kalmykia parliament that the 
Republic's own sovereignty and Constitution be abolished. 
  [Kostornoy] Kirsan Nikolayevich! On 5 April the 
Constitutional Assembly of the Republic of Kalmykia -- Khalmg 
Tangch -- repealed its own Constitution and adopted the Steppe 
Code [Stepnoye Ulozheniye] (the Fundamental Law). In the 
opposition's opinion, this is essentially a "surrender" of 
sovereignty. Is that so? And anyway, why was it necessary to 
take this step? 
  [Ilyumzhinov] As you know, on 12 December last year the new 
Constitution of Russia was adopted. In the situation that has 
since developed, the national Republics cannot fully exercise 
their sovereignty. To preserve and ensure the development of 
Kalmykia it is necessary to combine the economic and other 
interests of our Republic with the regions of Russia. But that 
needed a corresponding legal basis, including a constitutional 
basis. However, the old Constitution, adopted on 30 May 1978, 
was clearly formal in character and could not promote 
integration ties. 
  That is one aspect. Meanwhile, there are now two options for 
the development of the autonomous republics. The Chechen option 
presupposes complete independence from Russia, the Tatar option 
presupposes a transition from it to contractual relations. 
Which path is the right one? I believe that in Russia there 
must be one constitution for all and one president for all. In 
1640 the Great Steppe Code was adopted. We used that as a model 
for our own national "rules of life," which we adopted recently. 
They are quite sufficient to enable the Kalmyk people to feel 
that they are free and equal to all the other peoples living on 
Russian territory. We also abolished dual citizenship. We are 
all citizens of Russia. The third decision that we made was that 
the president of Kalmykia belongs to the one vertical power 
structure of the Russian Federation. 
  [Kostornoy] What has been the reaction to your initiatives, 
to put it mildly? 
  [Ilyumzhinov] Well! It was like a bombshell. Initially 
people in Kalmykia, the regions, and the center could not 
understand what was happening. There was even a bewildered 
speech by the Russian President's press secretary. I believe 
that this confirms that I had no prior accord with B.N. Yeltsin 
and the leadership of other republics. Even my aides did not 
know what I was preparing to say. 
  [Kostornoy] Your opponents claim that now, with the 
adoption of the Steppe Code, the president has been given sole 
power in the Republic. Is that true? 
  [Ilyumzhinov] Of course not. Let us consider Article 26 of 
the Steppe Code, for example, where it is clearly written that 
the People's Hural (the parliament) can express no-confidence in 
the president and put the question of his removal to a 
nationwide vote. Now for my opponents. I have had opponents 
and probably will in the future. On the one hand there are 
those who have been stripped of leading posts, on the other 
there are those whom I prevented from obtaining such posts. I 
anticipated in advance the whole scenario of the events that 
have unfolded. The nationalists "surfaced" and began shouting 
from the rooftops that Ilyumzhinov is "surrendering" Kalmykia 
for Russia's benefit. But what about the ordinary people far 
removed from politics? They supported me. Do you know why? 
Because during my year as president they have known the real 
fruits of the implementation of the economic reforms. 
  [Kostornoy] The president is first and foremost a 
politician. Do you have your own preference for any particular 
party or movement? 
  [Ilyumzhinov] No. During the election campaign last year I 
had to answer this question. I said then and I say it again 
now: "I am a capitalist and I see my main task as making 
Kalmykia a rich and prosperous republic." I think that this 
will soon become a reality. It is a very good thing that I am 
free to make decisions independently without regard for any 
political forces. I value people for their professional 
qualities and devotion to the Republic's interests, not for 
their party beliefs. Thus my policy is a commonsense policy. 
  I am convinced that since the whole engine of the economy of 
such a vast power as Russia has been geared toward the market 
and the whole social tenor of life is being redirected 
accordingly, we can travel this road only if we are firmly 
united. It will not work if we are divided. The market cannot 
exist with customs barriers and other obstacles. It needs a 
single economic area, which in turn is impossible without accord. 
  [Kostornoy] How do you think your feat, accomplished for the 
sake of unifying Russia, will be perceived in the Kremlin? 
  [Ilyumzhinov] With understanding, I hope. After all, look 
at what is going on in our internal political life now. The 
regions are berating the center for its weakness and inability 
to cope with the economic crisis and constantly ask for money 
while threatening secession. Meanwhile, the center criticizes 
them for tearing the nation's wealth to shreds and consuming it. 
A nervous and prolonged period of wait-and-see has ensued; 
cyclists call this situation a "sur-place," I think. You will 
agree that things could not go on like this for long. The 
development of the economy needs strict centralization, but just 
try and give orders to any of the autonomous formations today. 
Immediately the nationalists begin screaming: "The hand of the 
Kremlin is stifling freedom!" The only solution -- the process 
of unification must start from the bottom. We have launched the 
new amalgamation of the Russian lands for the sake of Russia's 
might and prosperity. Who will support us? 
  [Kostornoy] Well, in my view a significant example has been 
set.... 
  [Ilyumzhinov] Yes, we took this step, but this does not mean 
all the republics can or must follow us immediately. This needs 
the corresponding sociopolitical situation, a united team, and a 
leader who is confident that people will follow him and who is 
ready for action. I do not want to boast, but I am confident 
that my fellow countrymen trust me. That was shown by the 
presidential elections, for example, when 70 percent of the 
people voted for me, and by my election to the Federation 
Council, when 80 percent were on my side. I am confident of 
support now, too. 
  [Kostornoy] That is indeed so. I have met with various 
people and I asked about their lives and feelings. To my 
pleasant surprise I discovered a phenomenon that is quite rare 
nowadays: They are infected with a positive energy and a desire 
to work. I could feel people's respect for and trust in you. 
Is that not because they know that Ilyumzhinov is occupying the 
president's chair not for his own benefit or to satisfy his own 
pride? Of course, you have enough money and glory already. So 
why do you, one of the richest men in Russia and a prince, want 
such an arduous and thankless job? 
  [Ilyumzhinov] You must understand that in every man's life 
there comes a time when he wants not just to go about his own 
business but wants to help other people achieve happiness or, at 
least, prosperity. Some go in for philanthropy.... but I felt 
within myself the strength to be useful to my Kalmykia. 
  [Kostornoy] A businessman, as a rule, is someone far 
removed from politics, where intrigue is sometimes one of the 
instruments for achieving one's goal and where you have to 
sacrifice short-term interests for the sake of far-reaching 
aspirations. How do you feel in your new capacity? 
  [Ilyumzhinov] If I placed politics above all else nothing 
would happen and the reforms would not work. It is well known 
that politics is the concentrated expression of economics, but 
we have no economy here yet. What kind of economy was it if all 
it amounted to was that the leaders of Kalmykia would go to 
Moscow, extract some money there, come back, and hand it out. 
Now we are working hard to create a system of economic 
relations in which bad work would be unprofitable not only for 
the republic but for each individual who works badly. The 
Republic must become like one enormous firm where everything is 
on view and where everyone is appreciated for his or her 
intelligence and ability to earn money. Just today I met with 
some farmers and sovkhoz directors and set them all a specific 
task -- to make money. My problem is to create the conditions 
for them to do that. All the other leaders of the Republics 
should do that, too. It is a very specific task and superficial 
bureaucratic innovations are no substitute for it. 
  [Kostornoy] Does that mean that the bureaucracy in Kalmykia 
is still strong? 
  [Ilyumzhinov] Not any more. Out of 40 ministries and 
departments only four have "survived." By reducing the number 
of officials we are easing the pressure on the budget and 
reducing the possibility of any plots or disturbances occurring. 
No one is likely to take offense if he is given a chance to 
really earn quite a lot of money not just for his republic, but 
for himself, too. Those people who do not want to do that or do 
not know how to get things done but can only offer everyone 
advice -- they are simply blabbermouths and should not be 
annoyed with anyone if they are sacked. There are no more "jobs 
for the boys" in Kalmykia. 
  [Kostornoy] And now for a predictable question from a 
journalist on a newspaper with an agrarian brief. Agriculture 
is the basis of the Republic's economy. What is happening to it 
now? 
  [Ilyumzhinov] I think you know the way it was before. The 
Republic produced food and exported it to sustain the center and 
the major industrially developed regions. That is to say, it 
served in point of fact as a raw materials appendage to them. 
We are now setting up our own enterprises to process 
agricultural produce. In two to three weeks we will be starting 
up a tannery -- the largest in the North Caucasus. We are 
constructing a wool-processing enterprise. We are opening 
sausage shops, bakeries, an oil-extraction plant.... We are 
seeking thereby to develop small- and medium-sized businesses in 
order to get the largest possible number of people engaged in 
profit-making work. 
  [Kostornoy] Do you have to use your personal capital for the 
common good? 
  [Ilyumzhinov] I left business behind 18 months ago now, but 
regarding the use of private capital, yes, initially it was 
necessary. The Republic, after all, did not at that time have 
its own budget money. For example, I handed over all my 
personal vehicles, computers, and other equipment to the 
Republic. I built an Orthodox church in the village of 
Priyutnyy out of my own resources. When Russian Patriarch 
Aleksiy II learned of this, he said: "It is a good sign if the 
Buddhist Ilyumzhinov has built an Orthodox church." I have now 
donated 100 million for the construction of a Buddhist temple. 
I have reached agreement with the pope on building a Uniate 
church in Kalmykia. 
  [Kostornoy] Why does the Buddhist Ilyumzhinov actually spend 
pretty large sums out of his own savings on constructing the 
churches of other religious faiths? 
  [Ilyumzhinov] The point is I am convinced that there is just 
one God for everyone. And I now want to build a common 
monastery where Buddhist monks, Catholic priests, and Orthodox 
monks can live together. You can see, I have also assembled in 
my office a collections of the most diverse icons and images: 
There is the prophet 'Ali, the Virgin Mary, the crucifixion of 
Christ, and the Buddha, and there is an icon that I was sent 
recently by the Bulgarian clairvoyant, Vanga. 
  [Kostornoy] Incidentally, there is quite a lot of talk about 
the fact that this unique woman is possessed of special love for 
and trust in you alone out of the many thousands who have 
visited her. Is that so? 
  [Ilyumzhinov] It is difficult for me to say to what extent 
all that you say is true, but it is true that Vanga allowed me 
to be photographed and have a video shot with her, although no 
one else has been allowed that. I visit grandmother Vanga 
virtually every month, she often phones me and takes an interest 
in my life. We enjoy a disinterested, human friendship. She is 
a remarkable woman. I find it no wonder that the French Academy 
of Sciences should issue her with the certificate "Phenomenon of 
Mankind No. 1." We have bestowed the title of honorary citizen 
of Kalmykia on her for the great services she has rendered the 
republic. 
  In one of my recent conversations with Vanga she told me 
that 
in the near future she sees Russia as a mighty state and the 
whole of Kalmykia as a flourishing garden. 
  [Kostornoy] May God allow that prophecy to come to pass.

<F P=106> [Report by Dmitriy Kuznets under the "Inspection" rubric: </F>
"All Quiet in Kalmykia. It Waits for Subsidies and Purges"] 
  [Text] A State Duma commission that went to Kalmykia to 
inspect the situation there had to state upon its return that 
this Republic, a component of Russia, is nearly the Federation's 
most stable region. No major political disturbances connected 
with the adoption of a new fundamental law of Kalmykia --the 
Great Steppe Code [Velikoye Stepnoye Ulozheniye] -- have been 
recorded. 
  The sense of the innovation, which the Constitutional 
Conference, partly formed by Kalmykia President Kirsan 
Ilyumzhinov himself, actually copied from the Russian Federation 
Constitution, consists in the Republic's foregoing its 
sovereignty in order to receive subsidies from the federal 
budget. In the opinion of Duma Deputy Vladimir Lysenko, "all 
attempts by Mr. Ilyumzhinov to reform Kalmykia's economy boiled 
down to an international airport project and promises to give 
each resident a Mercedes. In Africa, too, every leader tries to 
build an airport the first thing," Mr. Lysenko pointed out. The 
Republic's economy has really been destroyed down to its 
foundations. Its basis -- sheep breeding -- has run into the 
severest crisis caused by the absence of demand for Kalmykia 
oil. Even the introduction of new customs duties, actively 
lobbied for by Kalmykia and Tuva, have failed to revive the 
Republic's economy. Subsidies remain the only way out of the 
situation that has taken shape. Thus, as members of the Duma 
commission pointed out, Mr. Ilyumzhinov has restrained his 
arrogance and finally decided to "get down to real business." 
  The opposition, which hampered the passing of the Steppe 
Code, is small. It is centered in Kalmykia's capital, Elista, 
and pertains to the sections of top civil servants. The Duma 
commission recorded "antidemocratic" moods in Kirsan Ilyumzhinov 
and his supporters, who are going to conduct purges in the 
Republic's power structures.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Valentin Pavlov] </F>
  [Text] Barnaul, 18 Apr -- Progress in implementing the 
program for conversion of defense enterprises, which was adopted 
in the Altay in May last year, has been examined by the kray's 
coordinating council for industrial policy and conversion. 
Although 52 types of civilian goods have gone into production 
during the past 12 months, managers of former defense plants are 
unhappy with the results of their work. They are dissatisfied 
about mutual nonpayments, reduction of investment activity, and 
the failure of many existing development projects to match up to 
the requirements of domestic and, especially, foreign investors. 
According to Anatoliy Karpov, president of the Polieks 
joint-stock company, conversion in the kray has been conducted 
in an incompetent and uncivilized way. Traditional markets for 
output are being lost as a result. Over 5,000 employees have 
been made redundant from enterprises undergoing conversion. 
  The council decided to set up collateral and insurance funds 
in the form of precious metals, minerals, raw materials and land 
allocations. The conversion program for the current year was 
endorsed. It is intended that another 44 new articles should go 
into production, including a prototype consignment of passenger 
carriages, multipurpose diesel engines, microwave stations, 
electric meters, electric motors for pumps and domestic 
appliances, hay cutters and motor assemblies, medical equipment 
and medicine. Specialists reckon that all this will require over 
138 billion rubles of credit. Some of the kray defense 
enterprises, included in the republican conversion program, are 
hoping to get funds from the federal budget. Others are relying 
on their own resources and assistance from domestic and foreign 
investors.

  Previously the "Niva" was produced only with engines from

has shown itself to be a not entirely reliable partner and the 
complication of tax procedures when crossing the border between 
Russia and Ukraine has aggravated the problem.

<F P=106> [From the "Dalniy Vostok" program] </F>
  [Text] Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin are two names that are 
being repeatedly mentioned in Magadan Oblast today. The oblast 
is on the verge of closing down. The economic council under the 
head of the oblast administration is preparing another package 
of documents for the government, which should help the fathers 
of the reforms to come to grips with the idea that if Russia 
wants, or rather if the government wants, to have gold it is 
essential to create a normal investment climate in Magadan 
Oblast. 
  Due to the pressure of taxes, exaggerated prices, and 
obviously deteriorating mining equipment conditions, today one 
gram of gold produced causes a loss of 20,000 to 30,000 rubles. 
If a mechanism for overcoming the crisis is not worked out this 
summer, Russia will become a witness to, and consequently a 
victim of the mass bankruptcy of Kolyma region miners. Of 
course, the miners are not twiddling their thumbs. At the just 
completed economic conference they tried to convince the 
representatives of the infrastructure to find ways to decrease 
expenditures in gold production. The infrastructure agreed to 
fix the price of fuels and transportation and to conduct price 
indexation in the future in proportion to the growth in the 
price of gold. 
  However this is a palliative and the oblast cannot extricate 
itself from this situation without Moscow. A report has 
appeared in local papers that a Magadan Oblast deputy to the 
Federal Assembly was promised support -- no more and no less -- 
in preparing a meeting with Chernomyrdin to discuss the 
inclusion of a purpose-oriented program for Magadan Oblast in 
the Federal budget.

  [Text] Petr Deynekin, commander in chief of the Russian 
Federation Air Force, has reported that no mutually acceptable 
agreement on delivery of the strategic bombers deployed on 
Ukrainian territory to Russia has yet been achieved. He 
remarked that there are currently 42 strategic missile planes, 
of which 19 are TU-160 and 23 TU-95-MS. According to him, the 
stumbling block is the astronomical sum demanded by Ukraine for 
transferring the bombers. Ukraine wants 700 billion rubles of 
its debt to Russia deducted for its delivering the planes. 
According to Russia, this sum amounts to about 200 billion 
rubles.

raise the sales of arms produced by the region's defense 
industry complex by a factor of 100 to 1000 times [na two-three

his recent meeting with Viktor Chernomyrdin, an accord was 
reached that the government will issue an ad hoc decree on the 
matter. The governor reported that the oblast has received 
permission to increase the volume of supplies, especially to 
India and Southeast Asia. Furthermore, he stressed, the 
government is to give first priority to repaying its debts to 
the oblast's military industrial complex and financing defense 
production orders.

<F P=106> [Interview with Oblast Administration Chief Yuriy Matochkin </F>
by V. Kostomarov in Kaliningrad; date not given: 
"Administration Head Yuriy Matochkin: `The Most Open Oblast in 
Russia'"] 
  [Excerpts] As the press has already reported, the 
Russian-Polish talks on border issues recently ended 
successfully in Kaliningrad. During the talks, Oblast 
Administration Head Yuriy Matochkin met with a group of 
journalists whose questions dealt mainly with border problems. 
  [Kostomarov] How would you assess Russian-Polish relations 
in 
border issues? 
  [Matochkin] I rate them as positive. As you know, we have an 
agreement on the so-called border cooperation concluded between 
the governments of the two countries. This agreement is a basis 
for another accord with all Polish border voivodships. We hold 
regular meetings, and the process of economic cooperation is 
expanding. In other words, we have no major problems on the 
border with Poland. This was also confirmed at our meeting with 
Jan Wojcieczuk, chief commander of the border guards of the 
Republic of Poland, who headed the Polish delegation at recent 
talks on border issues in Kaliningrad. True, recently we put 
forward a claim to the Polish side.... 
  [Kostomarov] What claim in particular? 
  [Matochkin] It is linked with the introduction of new 
requirements for service passports by Poland (even though in 
accordance with the 1972 agreement between the former Soviet 
Union and the People's Republic of Poland). This halted the 
traffic at the border for some time. Now this problem has been 
resolved to a certain extent. At least, the Poles issue free 
visas on the border, and the traffic has been renewed. 
  Speaking about our region in general, Kaliningrad is 
Russia's 
most open oblast today. Currently, we have 24 border crossings, 
and this is not the limit yet. Today, we are working on opening 
several new international crossing points. I believe that their 
number will reach 30. Incidentally, this question was discussed 
with the Polish delegation in great detail. 
  General Colonel Andrey Ivanovich Nikolayev, commander in 
chief of the Russian border troops, is well informed about these 
plans. We have told him in particular that it is necessary to 
open the large international crossing point "Mamonovo 2." 
Furthermore, we want all the facilities to be under one roof 
for the first time -- that is, separate Russian and Polish check 
points rather than one under the same roof. [passage omitted] 
  [Kostomarov] What is the relation between the customs regime 
and the development of a free economic zone? 
  [Matochkin] It is most direct. There are two conditions 
necessary for the actual functioning of a free economic zone -- 
a preferential customs regime and preferential taxes. As for 
the first condition, such a regime was put into effect as of 
February last year. 
  [Kostomarov] In your opinion, why have attempts at smuggling 
to Kaliningrad Oblast from Lithuania not been suspended? 
  [Matochkin] Thus far, the border with Lithuania has not been 
delineated. An administrative rather than a state border is 
being guarded. Given this fact, there are a million problems, 
including the one of contraband. What is the greatest trouble 
here? There are plans to ship oil products, for example, from 
Ryazan to Kaliningrad. The cisterns reach Lithuania and vanish 
there. We begin a search. The consignment agreement has been 
concluded with some fictitious firm. Therefore, the Russian 
State Customs Committee has decided to take deposit duties. 
However, this has not been very effective and it has hampered 
the registration of loads for law-abiding citizens. It is the 
latter rather than various crooks who primarily suffer. 
  [Kostomarov] It seems that the extraction of oil on the 
Curonian Spit is also linked with border problem. 
  [Matochkin] The oil shelf is the object of negotiations on 
the sea and land borders that Russia and Lithuania are currently 
conducting. The Lithuanian side is clearly interested in moving 
this border southward and cutting off the oil field D-6 that is 
viewed as having a future. 
  According to our overall information, and we are closely 
cooperating with border guards in this issue, Lithuania has no 
legal basis for such claims. It is playing for time and looking 
for arguments. However, there are no arguments, and any 
international court would confirm this, because in such cases 
sea borders run perpendicular to the coast line. In general, 
this example demonstrates that the Russian Government must 
clearly define its economic policy toward the Baltic states. 
  [Kostomarov] The current press, particularly the foreign 
one, 
abounds in comments on the statement made by Army General Pavel 
Grachev, Russian defense minister, concerning the establishment 
of a special defense region with a single command on the 
territory of Kaliningrad Oblast. Some politicians and mass 
media in neighboring countries believe that the emergence of 
such a defense area threatens their security. Would you object 
to this? 
  [Matochkin] I would like you to notice that this will be a 
defensive rather than an offensive region! Certainly, this is a 
purely military issue, but the administration, as you 
understand, is informed about it. Our territory is small. 
Therefore, it is rational even from an economic viewpoint to 
have a single command here. Meanwhile, the Baltic Fleet and the 
11th Army have separate infrastructures -- for example, 
storehouses, food supplies, and so on. At the same time, one 
must note that the size of the Army is being reduced. 
  [Kostomarov] How do you assess the plan to allow young 
people, drafted for service from Kaliningrad Oblast, to perform 
their duty here in the region, for example, in the border troops? 
  [Matochkin] We are implementing this model vigorously now. 
We launched this project back when Andrey Ivanovich Nikolayev 
was the Army commander in Kaliningrad Oblast. We believe that 
our region is special, and that young people from Kaliningrad 
Oblast must serve primarily here.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Sergey Borovkov] </F>
  [Text] Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy 18 April, TASS -- 
Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Frontier Guards Troops Andrey 
Nikolayev arrived in Kamchatka today. The main objectives of his 
visit are to get acquainted with the Far Eastern frontier guard 
districts and to start the putina (fishing season) operation. 
  The putina operation will begin in the Far East in the third 
decade of April. Its purpose is to stop the illegal fishing of 
Russian and foreign poachers in the economic zone of the Russian 
Federation. For half a year frontier guards jointly with the 
Fish Protection Service and the Navy will exercise a tough 
round-the-clock control over a vast part of the Pacific zone -- 
from the Chukotka Peninsula to the South Kuril islands. 
  Nikolayev said at the ramp of the plane that the operation 
would not affect the central part of the Sea of Okhotsk where 
Polish, Chinese and South Korean poacher vessels are illegally 
fishing the young fish, which are maturing there. "This is the 
problem of the national resources of the whole world and not 
only of Russia. It is necessary to resolve, in the first place, 
international problems connected with the use of biological 
resources of the Sea of Okhotsk," Nikolayev said. 
  Responding to the ITAR-TASS question about the reaction of 
Russia's Far Eastern neighbours to the putina operation, 
Nikolayev said that "all law-abiding states approve of those 
actions, aimed at protecting Russia's economic interests in the 
region."

"Swimming Right Up to the City of Serdobsk"] 
  [Excerpts] Penza Oblast -- While spring comes to the city 
of Serdobsk, Penza Oblast -- as prescribed -- once a year, 
floods come far more rarely. And one the like of today's cannot 
be remembered even by the old inhabitants. [passage omitted] 
  The water level in the local Serdoba stream has risen by 
almost eight meters. Whereas just one week ago the stream was 
barely 10 meters wide, it has now spread up to 1 km, submerging 
hundreds of houses in the suburbs of Serdobsk. 
  I later spoke with with Ivan Navalnyy, first deputy head of 
the rayon administration. According to his conservative 
estimate, the flood damage comes to 1 billion rubles. [passage 
omitted] 
  The flooding in Penza Oblast has passed its peak, our 
correspondent Aleksandr Kislov reports. Small rivers reached 
the nine to 10-meter mark. Around 40 population centers are 
surrounded by or under water. There have been casualties. 
  As V. Grinkov, chairman of the oblast flood commission and 
deputy chief of the oblast administration, reported, as of today 
2,600 homes in the area are flooded. The victims are being 
helped and the situation is under control. A week ago alarm was 
caused by the Khoper River: Because its level was lower than 
the Don's the river was flowing backward and flooding the 
district. The high water has now stopped here.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Lyudmila Yermakova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow April 19 TASS -- "It is already clear that 
the Council of the Federation cannot work on a non-permanent 
basis," Vladimir Shumeyko, speaker of the upper chamber of the 
Russian parliament, told a journalistic roundtable here today. 
"It will probably be necessary to amend the Constitution of the 
Russian Federation," he said, replying to an ITAR-TASS question 
on the organisation of the work of the parliament's upper 
chamber. In Shumeyko's opinion, members of the council should 
be elected and not delegated from each subject of the 
Federation. "It is impossible to combine the duties of a 
governor and senator," he noted. 
  Summing up the results of the first 100 days of the 
chamber's 
work, its speaker said that they were "spent on thinking over 
the functions of the upper chamber of the Federal Assembly". 
There are three points of view on this score among the MPs and 
in the society as a whole. The first view is that the council 
should work in strict accordance with the constitutional norms. 
The second view is that the chamber, being as it is the supreme 
legislative body, should tackle all the most important questions 
of social life, just as it was done by the old Supreme Soviet. 
This point of view is shared, in particular, by the heads of 
the subjects of the Federation, who account for the majority of 
the council members. And, finally, there is a view that the 
upper chamber should be "a buffer between the lower chamber and 
the president". This view is shared by the presidential 
administration. 
  Referring to the view of the heads of council committees, 
whom the speaker met on Monday, Shumeyko said that "the 
procedural rules of the Council of the Federation should be 
amended". The council must discuss all the vitally important 
problems, but at parliamentary hearings, not at sessions. Such 
hearings must be "an effective mechanism of its work". In some 
countries, the speaker recalled, they last for 1.5 years, 
discussing the most important problems and tabling proposals. 
Sessions of the chamber could be called whenever they are 
necessary, in particular, to endorse laws, presidential decrees, 
and other documents that are within the constitutional 
competence of the upper chamber.

<F P=106> [Valentina Nikiforova "Parliamentary Diary": "Passions </F>
Aroused Over Budget"] 
  [Text] Yesterday the State Duma discussed the most dramatic 
document -- the draft law "On the Federal Budget." The report 
delivered by acting finance minister S. Dubinin notes that 
revenue is around 120 trillion rubles [R] whereas expenditure is 
R180 trillion. Well, the deficit is not all that alarming. 
Especially since the speaker gave an assurance that social 
needs have been protected. True, a comparison of the figures 
(48.5 trillion for defense and the law enforcement organs, 12.3 
trillion for social needs) does not bear that out. The 
deciphering of the budget, item by item, alarmed the deputies. 
Deputy Bikalova characterized it thus: 
  "The whole social sphere is under threat. You ask, where can 
expenditure be cut? I say, in the sphere of administration!" 
  "It is impossible not to adopt the budget but it will be 
even 
worse if we adopt it in this form," Deputy Gordeyev from the 
Russian Federation Communist Party said. "If we do adopt it 
then in September-October we will be facing the problem of 
nonpayments. Production will stop once and for all. On 12 
December the people said that there must be an end to the 
euphoria of the pseudomarket reforms. The optimism over the 
small deficit is unfounded. Tax receipts are falling, 
everything has been given to the private sector but it is 
uncontrollable. The government should not talk about objective 
difficulties but propose a set of measures making it possible to 
increase the revenue section of the budget. And expenditure 
must be taken under tight state control." 
  Is that not too simple? But in that simplicity is the nub of 
the problem. For example, supposing that you try to check why 
it is that even those small amounts of money allocated to the 
agro-industrial complex have still not reached people in the 
countryside? Perhaps the power structures should try to find 
out which banks this money is languishing in, enabling devious 
officials to get rich? Or perhaps ministers do not mind the 
fact that they are greeted by a new picket every morning, as if 
to schedule? But what will happen if one day, for example, all 
of Russia suddenly unites behind the single demand: "If you 
cannot govern, get out"? 
  The draft budget was adopted as a basis at the third 
attempt.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Batygin "Parliamentary Review": "One Hundred </F>
Days Have Past. But Where Are the Laws?"] 
  [Text] The State Duma has been working for just over three 
months now. Its deputies were elected in December -- a cold, 
overcast time of year, but, astrologically speaking, an 
extremely propitious one for the future deputies. After all, 
those born under the sign of Sagittarius are energetic, active, 
independent, like reading and traveling, and attain great 
success in their work.... 
  Fine characteristics for a parliamentarian! That parliament 
has assembled professionals, and not afficianados of the 
"talking shop," can be seen, if by nothing else, by the recent 
parliament hearings on the federal budget. The executive can no 
longer get away with things that the Supreme Soviet swallowed 
uncomplainingly. Duma deputies decisively rejected the draft 
budget for 1994, explaining to representatives of the Ministries 
of Finance and the Economy and the Central Bank that it was 
simply ridiculous to discuss the budget without a breakdown by 
regions, and the ill-considered, insulting division of the 
regions into three classes could only provoke interregional 
conflicts. 
  The discussion of problems connected with the budget showed 
that we should expect no improvement in our lives this year; 
funds are needed, and considerable ones at that, for 
stabilization. What holes must be darned in the first place? 
Just one example, made public at the Russian Academy of 
Sciences' Annual General Meeting: Science was promised 933 
billion rubles [R] for 1994, but in the first quarter was given 
just R45 billion. Hence the Russian Academy of Sciences is 
sending the Duma a plaintive appeal for help. 
  Nevertheless, the difficult dialogue between the two 
branches 
of power on budgetary problems kept within civilized bounds. 
After a businesslike exchange of opinions, having little in 
common with the old rivalry and disputes and still less the 
feuds and enmity so memorable in relations between the former 
executive and legislative branches, the government did not even 
insist on parliament's approval of the draft budget. 
  There are not so many variations in the Duma's strategy, the 
last three months have shown. One or two continue to campaign 
for the course of reforms in their current experimental form. 
However, many are convinced that it is capable only of 
destroying, not of creating, and runs the risk of losing the 
people's trust. The second variation, whose mouthpiece in the 
lower chamber of parliament is above all Gennadiy Zyuganov and 
other Communists, is a call for the country to go back to 
socialism, to the USSR, and, therefore, to the 
administrative-edict system. Alas, history has already given 
them the opportunity to bring the country prosperity, and the 
results are well known. More and more deputies incline to 
another path -- the implementation of professionally executed 
reforms with the creation of a temporary system of social 
protection for those who have lost their jobs. A difficult 
path, but a realistic one that corresponds to the laws of the 
market. 
  In this, the legislature's influence on the course of events 
could prove extremely great. Parliament, Duma Chairman Ivan 
Rybkin stated, "firmly intends to undertake the legislative 
support of intelligent political, economic, and social reforms." 
The choice of priorities is also evidence of the thoroughness 
of these intentions. The 23 Duma committees -- effectively 
miniparliaments -- in which all factions and groups are 
proportionately represented have already got down to their 
direct task: creative legislation. This work is multifaceted, 
painstaking, and -- so it may seem to the bystander -- rather 
tedious. The deputies do not think so, engaging in expert 
analysis day after day and participating in open parliamentary 
hearings and discussions. 
  The only pity is that not one of the problems discussed has 
yet found concrete embodiment in law. Such a low productivity 
level in the Duma is worrying. And if you take into account the 
fact that the Law "On the Status of the Deputy" has still not 
been adopted, it is extremely difficult to divine what 
consequences decisions adopted within the walls of parliament 
may have. 
  Of course, we must also allow for the relatively short time 
of the Duma's existence -- just 100 days -- the confusion over 
its premises, and other organizational difficulties. But the 
fact remains that, apart from confidently executed "softening-up 
exercises" -- a highly sensible plan of legislative activity -- 
nothing else has been accomplished. The Duma inmates score real 
points perhaps only for helping the president to modify his 
savings compensation edict. 
  And there is plenty of work to do. Finally our society is 
starting to realize that the only way to achieve political goals 
is through peaceful means, with the aid of elections and the 
will of the people. Boris Yeltsin singled out the evolving new 
climate of collaboration with the Federation Council and the 
State Duma. "Dialogue is developing," he said. "I will do 
everything incumbent on me to see that this constructive mood 
takes root, to see that parliament serves out its term and that 
the next elections take place at the appointed time and in 
conditions of stability and a higher level of political culture." 
  Let us add to the president's words: It would be a good 
thing if the constructive mood were constantly reinforced by 
creation. So far the deputies born under the sign of 
Sagittarius, the Archer, "shoot" and hit target extremely 
rarely. The Duma is still only just beginning normal work, and 
its deputies have so far only managed to shine in foreign 
excursions and parliamentary hearings. To be fair, many such 
hearings are packed with content and interesting. In 
particular, one of the most recent hearings, devoted to local 
self-government reforms, deserves special attention. The issue 
was that, according to the norms enshrined in the Russian 
Federation Constitution, the organs of local self-government do 
not form part of the system of state power, and hence do not 
square with the existing structures of the representative and 
executive organs in the localities. The future law "On Local 
Self-Government," which should avoid this contradiction, could 
untie this knot. A timely notion, in our view, and a fine one, 
but it does not solve the problem. And yet, because of this 
problem in some regions local self-government elections were 
aborted, and in many localities they were postponed till the 
fall on the president's recommendation. 
  The parliamentary hearing on the "Partnership for Peace 
Program," which dealt with the possibility of Russia's 
participation in the NATO program and attitudes to opposing 
military blocs, also provoked a great deal of dispute. 
  The Duma's activity is directly linked to the resolution of 
vexed questions. All the same, deputies are obliged to justify 
the hopes of those who voted for them above all through 
consistent, effective legislation. In this area the 100 days of 
the Duma's power can clearly be assessed as a "flop." 
  ...Three months of intense work have past. The drama of the 
election contest and the preelection pledges and promises of 
mounds of gold have evaporated, and have been replaced by 
routine parliamentary service, deprived of the halo of rallies 
and election campaigns. 
  Fears that the Duma would plunge into factional polemics 
have 
proved unfounded. Of course, the preposterous antics of the 
leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia introduce a 
shrill note into the polyphonic deputies' chorus. Although the 
Duma is not a place to settle personal scores, from time to time 
scandals erupt there -- the latest involving fisticuffs. Well, 
parliamentarians are also people, nothing human is alien to 
them. Of course, neither Shakhray's ripostes, Lukin's puns, or 
Zhirinovskiy's antics determine the import of decisions adopted 
by the Duma or influence the disposition of political forces in 
parliament. However, the relations of the Duma deputies, it 
seems to me, are extremely indicative. The disposition of 
forces in the Duma is a kind of reflection of the situation in 
society. 
  For instance, the strengthening of the Communists' positions 
in the Duma, the vague rumors around the ultranationalists, in 
my view, by no means reflect dissatisfaction on the part of the 
Russian people over the fall of the communist regime or 
nostalgia for the past. The majority, it would appear, have 
already gauged the true price of "protest voting." People today 
are not frightened by the advent of the market, but by the 
degradation of the economy and the falling standard of living. 
They are far less concerned by the verbal interchanges between 
leaders of the multiplying parties and movements. 
  However, "political work" and the factional get-togethers 
in the Duma will continue. I. Rybkin said that he sees nothing 
reprehensible in such activity. The main thing is that a limit 
is kept.... 
  The time has come for people's deputies -- they must by no 
means forget who elevated them to the parliamentary benches -- 
to slow down their pace for a moment and look back at the road 
they have traveled in the first 100 days: a short road, but one 
packed with events both in parliament and in a great country 
which has acquired its own name once more. The formation of the 
new, or to be more precise, long-forgotten, body in Russian 
power is complete. For all its organizational difficulties, 
failures, and inconsistency, and a certain degree of passivity 
in its legislation, the Duma has not engaged in contemplation of 
life, but is dynamically trying to realize its innate 
intellectual potential. 
  In order not to put the evil eye on, and so doom to an 
unenviable future, the present Duma, which is a mere 100 days 
old and was born under the size of Sagittarius, which promises 
success, it is being called a transitional parliament. Where 
will the transition lead deputies and those who stand behind 
them (the Russian people)? To oblivion once again, or to a 
dignified existence? However banal it sounds, much depends on 
us ourselves, on how demanding we are, on our civic activity. 
After all, we ourselves elected this parliament.

  [Text] The Russian State Duma's banking legislation 
subcommittee has drafted a package of amendments and addenda to 
the Russian Federation Law "On Banks and Banking Activity." The 
changes would make it possible to correct the deficiencies 
"preventing the normal functioning of the banking system." This 
has been advised by Pavel Medvedev, chairman of the Duma banking 
legislation subcommittee. According to him, the subcommittee is 
hoping to submit a corresponding document to be considered by 
the State Duma in the first reading till the end of April.

<F P=106> [Studio interview with Georgian State Council chairman </F>
Eduard Shevardnadze by correspondent Nato Oniani in Tbilisi -- 
live] 
  [Excerpts] [Oniani] Batono Eduard, in the light of 
comparatively less encouraging information received from Geneva 
lately, do you think more real significance will be attached to 
a statement made by the CIS Security Council? 
  [Shevardnadze] Thank you. Good morning. You are right. I 
have 
already expressed my considerations about the statement made by 
the CIS summit. This is a statement which undoubtedly has good 
prospects and which may acquire paramount importance in the 
issue of settling the Abkhazian conflict. The thing is that we 
can renounce none of these possibilities. 
  The process of negotiations under UN auspices in Geneva is 
still in effect. This remains a major trend. And it is very 
significant that the specific participation of the CIS countries 
in the settlement of the Abkhazian conflict is becoming clearly 
visible. 
  There may be yet another way, the way many people often 
speak 
about and try to induce us to take, I mean the military way. But 
I would say that although we must be ready for this third way, 
we have to do our best to exhaust all peaceful options. 
  This problem cannot and will not remain unsolved. Abkhazia 
cannot and will not be lost. This will never happen. This cannot 
be allowed to happen. The main thing is not just returning it. 
The main thing is that it should happen on time, soon and in a 
period as short as possible. 
  Therefore, the variant which was outlined in Moscow, I mean 
the CIS variant can become more real if it leads to our 
objective more quickly. If the UN forces are deployed there 
mostly as neutral forces and the process drags, it was mentioned 
in Geneva that certain units could be gathered by August or a 
little earlier or a little after that, this variant will be 
unacceptable for us. 
  Therefore, I attach special importance to what has happened 
in Moscow. This is yet another chance to get the Abkhazian 
conflict settled promptly and the people returned to their homes 
so that they can start a normal life. We shall yield to those 
who give us more guarantees. 
  Now, I am not going to remind you of a known formula given 
in 
the Moscow statement. However, this might be necessary. First, 
we appeal to the United Nations to act promptly and take a 
decision which will guarantee refugees a secure and honorable 
return to their homes. This will also create guarantees for the 
unity and integrity of Georgia and the protection of rights of 
Abkhazs within this state. 
  This in one side of the appeal and the other side of the 
statement is that if this cannot be achieved for whatever 
reason, the CIS council of collective security will take its own 
decision to deploy peace-keeping forces in Abkhazia. I think 
this is an important achievement. 
  Today, I am having a meeting with a delegation I am sending 
to Moscow. Mr. Sandro Kavsadze [Shevardnadze's personal envoy 
on conflict situations] will return to Moscow together with 
other members of the delegation to start seeking the best 
possible variants in Moscow so that the statement will not 
remain only on paper and the taking of a final decision will not 
be dragged out. 
  Meanwhile, the process in Geneva has not stopped. Today or 
tomorrow, talks will resume there. This time, the issue of 
Abkhazia's status will be in the foreground. Yet another group 
of experts left yesterday. Mr. Jaba Ioseliani is also there 
with other representatives. Let's see which way is the 
shortest, demanding no sacrifice and securing our territorial 
integrity. 
  [Oniani] Among the documents adopted at the CIS summit, you 
paid special attention to the declaration on the sovereignty, 
territorial integrity and noninterference in the internal 
affairs of the CIS member states. Do you believe that this is a 
real guarantee for our sovereignty? 
  [Shevardnadze] The CIS charter itself and other statutory 
documents of political nature and importance contain, in 
principle, the ideas and provisions outlined in the declaration, 
albeit in a scattered form, in separate clauses, different 
documents and so on. But at a time when many CIS countries are 
facing serious problems relating directly to their territorial 
integrity, when there are a few border disputes - not so many in 
our region as elsewhere, when there are movements in some 
countries calling for border revision and so on, when conflicts 
are going on the territories of a number of countries and the 
unity, integrity and inviolability of the borders of many 
countries are under direct threat, I believe that today, at the 
current stage, when we are heading for a crisis, the declaration 
has great importance. 
  To be honest, I left the news conference slightly 
disappointed because neither journalists nor other participants 
in the news conference paid proper attention to this document 
and ignored its highly important provisions. I repeat that the 
recognition of territorial integrity, sovereignty, equal rights, 
noninterference in internal affairs, and some other principles 
should become the CIS's cornerstone and foundation. At least, 
that is what the document says. 
  Apart from these interesting and highly significant 
provisions, there is also a clause which is of special 
importance to us and, in my opinion, not only to us. It says 
that separatism and separatist movements should not be used to 
violate the integrity of states. In fact, a common approach and 
position have emerged and they are shared by all the CIS member 
states. This is very important today and in the future. 
[passage indistinct: Oniani's remark on definition of separatism] 
  [Shevardnadze] It can be said without exaggeration that it 
is 
Georgia's priority to look for formulas and definitions, and not 
only Georgia's. Everybody has finally understood how serious a 
threat -- at least within the CIS -- aggressive separatist 
movements are today. I would add on this subject that if the 
CIS remains committed to these principles, then it will acquire 
more and more (?qualities) of a true interstate organization and 
an international status. 
  What we have at the moment...[pauses] I repeat that if our 
relations within the CIS are built on these principles, it will 
become an international organization in which all the states of 
the former Soviet Union -- and perhaps others too in the future 
-- will cooperate freely and successfully with the aim of 
achieving their goals and receiving guarantees of their freedom 
and independence. If these principles are adhered to, the CIS 
may become one of the guarantors of a free and independent 
development of its members. 
  [Oniani] Thank you. Agreements of economic character were 
signed at the summit, for instance, about a free trade zone, or 
pertaining to an integral economic space and others. Later, you 
defined these documents as a favorable economic integration. To 
what extent do you think Russia feels the necessity of 
establishing economic relations based on equal rights and to 
what extent do you think economic integration will promote 
political integration? 
  [Shevardnadze] Economic integration is one of the major 
tendencies in the world today and among not only developed 
countries but also numerous developing countries that have 
overcome an economic and social crisis of which we have numerous 
examples in the east, south or west. This is a result of an 
involvement in the process of economic integration, which 
answers the standards of today's requirements. 
  Economic integration is a basis of any sort of modern union 
or alliance. Economic integration must become the basis of the 
process of the unity of the Black Sea basin countries we have 
already started. The CIS can become a major, one of the major 
guarantors of stability across the space of the former Soviet 
Union and it will become this if economic processes are managed 
correctly. If this fails, additional political difficulties and 
additional difficulties in social sphere will arise. 
  I think that unlike the previous years, we, all the states, 
have to take care of the CIS as of a formation which can act as 
a sort of guarantor of independent development. This is 
possible all right. Unless we take care of this, we may receive 
variants which will be hard and unacceptable for our life and 
development. 
  We could speak about former Yugoslavia as an example. We can 
all see an eventuality when a region does not care about its own 
guarantees. The present horrible tragedy is a result of 
disregarding all that was useful and essential for the 
countries, even from the point of view of economic integration 
only. Therefore, I think that economic integration, care about a 
single space in science, culture, judicial and other spheres may 
become definite guarantees of economic, social and political 
stability for the CIS countries. But economic integration still 
remains the basis. 
  I will naturally be asked a question whether a manifestation 
of great-power tendencies can be expected along with the 
usefulness and beneficial features of integration. It is 
impossible to rule out this. But when we are together, when 
there exists a system of managing all processes like the council 
of heads of states, the council of heads of governments and many 
other securing instruments, I think a domination of negative 
tendencies is less likely. At least we are capable of 
preventing those today. At least, it is easier to do this when 
we all are together than separately, when we deal with bilateral 
relations. However, I would not like to diminish the 
significance of bilateral relations with it. 
  Once documents in the sphere of economy are signed, a lot 
will depend on an initiative abilities of the Cabinet of 
Ministers, individual ministries, associations, private business 
and generally ordinary citizens who also have possibilities and 
rights at the same time to establish relations with other 
countries, citizens of other countries in the economic sphere. 
  Thus, prospects are good and interesting. Now, the main 
thing is how much initiative and courage we shall be able to 
demonstrate in our activities at the present stage. 
  [Oniani] You mentioned the former Yugoslavia. In assessing 
last week's bombing by NATO planes of Serb positions near 
Gorazde, you said that it was the first serious attempt to 
counter the phenomenon of war with force. Do you think that 
NATO's involvement in the conflict in the former Yugoslavia was 
a success? Does it mean that NATO has begun taking up a 
peacekeeping role -- something you were discussing a long time 
ago, at the beginning of the war in Abkhazia? 
  [Shevardnadze] As for the specific issue of Yugoslavia, I 
think that a great number of mistakes and sins have been 
committed there, starting from the first stage, when the 
disintegration of the state was beginning. My impression is 
that countries which could have played a role in preventing this 
drama and tragedy failed to agree among themselves. However, 
this is a thing of the past. 
  I would like to touch upon another issue, which is more 
fundamental and substantive. Today it is Yugoslavia, tomorrow 
it may be Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan or Tajikistan. 
Unfortunately, it is difficult to rule out that such conflicts 
can break out in other regions. Therefore, I think that endless 
debates and discussions as well as slowness, which is so typical 
of the UN -- I called it an academic style in the past, now I am 
speaking about slowness -- lead to most serious results in the 
end. 
  We are often prisoners of regulations created by ourselves 
and our predecessors. We keep failing to free ourselves from 
this captivity. I am profoundly convinced that, in the end, the 
UN with all its institutions and structures should take up the 
role of supreme judge in the world. By the way, this function 
is enshrined in its charter and in its structure. Everything is 
there in theory. Unless this happens, the UN itself will be in 
serious danger. 
  The interesting ideas of reforming the UN, as outlined in 
the 
secretary-general's report -- and I welcomed these ideas -- 
should result in concrete action, not in a large number of 
resolutions. You know how many wonderful resolutions on Abkhazia 
have been passed during the past year. And what do we have now? 
  [Oniani] Nothing in the end. 
  [Shevardnadze] How many wonderful resolutions were passed on 
Yugoslavia and other countries. There were five or six 
resolutions in connection with the Karabakh conflict. The 
shower of resolutions must end and practical actions should 
start, practical and courageous actions to solve conflicts. 
Otherwise, we will have to deal not only with conflicts, but 
also large-scale wars in the near future. 
  [Oninai] Having returned from Moscow, you said at the 
meeting of the Union of Georgia's Citizens: I want you to be 
tolerant toward other political organizations, it is necessary 
to begin a dialogue with political parties, to cooperate and 
unite around at least those five or six basic principles which 
by themselves can unite any force and so on and so forth. Now 
that we can say that we live virtually in the period of election 
campaign, do statements like this made by the chairman of the 
Union of Georgia's Citizens mean that it will not participate in 
elections separately but jointly with another political 
organization or other political organizations? 
  [Shevardnadze] When speaking at the meeting of the board of 
the Union of Citizensabout about the tolerance and principles 
that all Georgian citizens should live with, I meant the Union 
of Georgia's Citizens and the whole population of Georgia. I 
cannot help hailing our great academic and great philosopher 
Niko Chavchavadze, who put forward this issue so courageously at 
a parliament meeting recently. 
  The issue of Georgia's existence will very much depend on 
our 
ability to live a friendly and brotherly life with all the 
people actually living alongside us in Georgia. This was the 
main line when I spoke about tolerance and I want this feature 
to become an essential and integral part of each member who 
linked his fate with the Union of Georgia's Citizens. 
  I have also suggested that we cooperate with all forces 
whose 
thoughts meet state standards and who place the state interest 
above all. I mean all patriotic forces. I certainly do not rule 
out a joint platform in various aspects of elections, be it 
parliament elections or elections of the head of state or 
president in future, in the elections of local authorities and 
so on. 
  I have observed that there certain gradual changes are 
taking 
place in the stances of many political parties. This has 
occurred in issues pertaining to relations with Russia, with the 
CIS. The aggressiveness so characteristic two or three months 
ago has diminished. Some even try to overtake us. We have long 
wanted to be friendly with Russia, they say. They do not 
renounce the CIS and so on. I can only welcome this. Because 
this is an evidence of our parties' becoming more tolerant. At 
least those, who did not share this stance in the past, have 
become more realistic in relation with life. 
  If this process keeps going I do not rule out that the Union 
of Georgia's Citizens will propose a joint platform with some 
other political forces in order that we all together build a 
democratic state of Georgia and solve the most difficult 
problems that have accumulated in social spheres and save the 
people, the country and the nation. I reiterate, I do not rule 
out our cooperation with any really patriotic force and every 
individual citizen. 
  [Oniani] In recent days, relative cleanness and order have 
been established in Tbilisi. It has become perceptible, at 
least. More public transport have appeared in the streets. 
Does it mean that this process of stabilization, as seen by 
these first signs, will go on or this will have a shape of a 
one-time campaign to which we are quite accustomed, 
unfortunately. 
  [Shevardnadze] We can now speak of first steps only. We have 
grounds neither for great joy nor for a bitter disappointment. 
We become convinced that a lot, if not everything, depends on 
us and we are to handle it. 
  Every morning, the moment I get into the car, I request a 
report on crimes committed in Georgia during the past 24 hours. 
It was only this morning that I heard that a mere seven 
criminal offenses were committed in the past 24 hours. There 
were no cases of homicide, no other grave crimes. Even in the 
past, when that huge machine was fighting crime, days like this 
were rare. 
  I do not mean that all is well now, that everything has been 
well arranged, but do we not see that there can be a positive 
result? [passage omitted] 
  Almost 80 enterprises have started running in recent days. 
Nothing has been produced and nothing has been done for the past 
two or three months. Some of these have been shown on 
television, but not all. We have to show the people this 
process. Work is beginning, production is beginning. Once we 
yield production, we shall have goods and small resources and 
reserves will be created for the country to exist. [passage 
omitted] 
  We often hear reprimands that the government is anti-reform, 
that there are no reforms, no program, no concept. To tell you 
the truth, I am tired of such talk. I beg everyone to read what 
has already been written, what is known, what is in effect. 
Take the plan of coming out of the crisis approved by the 
Cabinet of Ministers and which I endorsed and which was drafted 
on the basis of my edict. There exists a plan like this. 
Stages for the implementation this plan in the countryside as 
well as in town, in industry and trade have been defined. We 
have the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank 
recommendations which have been arranged lately and have 
received their ultimate shape. 
  I would like to appeal to everyone to get familiarized with 
all this. Sheer words that reforms do not exist and the 
authorities are anti-reformist cannot do any good. This is not 
a way out. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The commander of Georgian Interior troops, Vladimir 
Chikovani, has accused Abkhazia of causing the impasse in the 
talks on the deployment of UN peacekeepers in the zone of the 
Georgian-Abkhazian conflict. The recent round of talks was held 
in Geneva. 
  In an interview with Interfax, Chikovani, who took part in 
the talks, said that the Abkhazian delegation occupied an 
"obstinate and unconstructive stand" and demanded the UN troops 
deployment along the confrontation line on the Inguri River. 
The Georgian troops, he said, are demanded by Abkhazia to be 
withdrawn eight kilometers away from the river. 
  Such demands, said Chikovani, run counter to commonsense and 
cannot guarantee the safety of refugees. 
  The Georgian side favors the deployment of peacekeepers 
along 
the entire territory of Abkhazia, including along the border 
with Russia which passes along the Psou River.

  [Text] CONTACT news agency has supplied us with information 
from the press service of the Georgian cabinet of ministers that 
an Armenian Government delegation arrived today on a working 
visit in Tbilisi. The delegation is led by Armenian State 
Minister Gagik Martirosyan. The delegation was met at the 
airport by Deputy Prime Minister Irakli Menagharishvili. 
  A meting was held at the cabinet of ministers where the 
issues of securing the railways, oil and natural gas supplies, 
and the situation in trade and economy were discussed. 
  The Armenian delegation expressed its discontent over 
Saknavtobprodukti [Georgian oil products]. It was noted that in 
an immediate future, a north Caucasus-Transcaucasus gas pipeline 
would soon be put in operation, which would enhance gas supplies 
two-fold both to Georgia and Armenia. Martirosyan said that a 
group of the Armenian Government delegation had left for Batumi 
to monitor the transportation of cargo and humanitarian aid 
destined for Armenia. 
  The members of the Armenian Government delegation will 
continue work in the appropriate ministries and departments.

<F P=106> [Interview with Mirian Murdzhikneli, first deputy minister </F>
of finances, by Spartak Nikolaishvili; place and date not given: 
"In Pursuit of Prices"] 
  [Text]Statistics inexorably show: Over 90 percent of 
the republic's population are living below the poverty line. As 
Head of State E. Shevardnadze has emphasized, a catastrophic 
disparity has arisen between standard of living, prices, and 
wages. A person here now receives on average less than 100,000 
coupons [per month] while, in order to sustain at least a 
minimum standard of living, according to specialists, the 
standard wage should be 9.3 million coupons. 
How can we eliminate this extremely negative discrepancy 
and what can the state do in order to help people to survive in 
this extreme situation? We raised these questions with Mirian 
Murdzhikneli, first deputy minister of finances. 
  [Murdzhikneli] There can be no doubt that social policy 
should form the principal element in the government's 
activities; it is essential to implement at once measures aimed 
at increasing the population's standard of living. As is known, 
in January, there was a 100 percent increase in wages in all 
budgetary organizations and a 150 percent increase in pensions 
and benefits. Since 1 February, teachers' salaries have 
increased two to threefold. 
  [Nikolaishvili] Nevertheless, during this time, prices 
have rocketed so much that this increase has, to all intents and 
purposes, been nullified. Furthermore, the coupon is falling at 
a catastrophic rate before our very eyes. 
  [Murdzhikneli] Yes, given current hyperinflation, even a 
wage that has increased threefold does not constitute a living 
wage. In order to alleviate somehow the destructive effect of 
inflation, it has been decided to increase the wages of workers 
in budgetary organizations on a monthly basis by 20 percent as 
of 1 March of this year. Of course, this will not bring about 
cardinal changes in the standard of living but, nevertheless.... 
  [Nikolaishvili] For how long can wages be made to keep 
up this vain chase after prices? After all, it is patently 
clear that we will always be on the losing side.... 
  [Murdzhikneli] Yes, until we get production going again and 
until there are sufficient goods on whose purchase at least 
50-60 percent of the wage fund can be spent. After all, almost 
nothing is currently being produced; there is nothing in the 
shops; we are forcibly chained to the market where speculators 
reign supreme and jack up prices at their leisure. Notice that, 
as a rule, genuine peasants are being pushed off the territory 
of the market and very often forced to raise their prices. 
Furthermore, the market has haphazardly gone over to trading 
only in rubles and made the coupon literally worthless. 
  [Nikolaishvili] Yet, measures have been taken to 
strengthen the coupon.... 
  [Murdzhikneli] They are still demanding in Parliament today 
that we propose some emergency measures in this respect. What 
can you propose in the circumstances? The republic should start 
working and producing goods. That's the first thing. Second, 
all economic ties should be restored with the former Union 
republics, first and foremost, with Russia. Up to now, we have 
been destroying everything with a stubbornness that could be put 
to better use and have imposed a self-blockade. However, it is 
clear today that we cannot survive without Russia. 
  [Nikolaishvili] A final question concerning the 
budget. Can one hope that the social measures you have outlined 
will find reliable support in the state's financial law? 
  [Murdzhikneli] Absolutely. Expenditure on the indexation of 
the population's losses that lead to inflation has already been 
included in the budget for the second quarter. True, there are 
certain complications with implementing the income part of the 
budget; the mechanism for levying taxes has not been properly 
developed. No one wants to pay on time while there are plenty 
of people who are keen to have more money.

18 April 1994 compiled by Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy 
and edited by Vladimir Shishlin] 
  [Text] President Boris Yeltsin on Monday met Nikolay 
Medvedev, head of the parliamentary group of the New Regional 
Policy coalition. The meeting was held behind closed doors, but 
some sources told Interfax it had focused on the finalization of 
a draft for a civic accord, a proposed agreement between 
reformists and hardliners to prevent violence. The same subject 
was discussed at a meeting of a working group including the 
leaders of all eight parliamentary groups, also held on Monday. 
  Alevtina Fedulova, deputy chairwoman of the lower house of 
the legislature, said Yeltsin and the parliamentary group 
leaders were to consider the finalized draft of the accord at a 
meeting tentatively scheduled for April 22. But she said the 
meeting might be postponed if a draft taking account of all the 
suggestions and objections that had been made was not ready by 
that date. 
  IF Note: Some sources told Interfax some of the objections 
were very serious. For instance, the Communist group, headed by 
Gennadiy Zyuganov, protests against one of the fundamental 
points in the draft, a clause in which the signatories would 
pledge not to make any amendments to the Constitution that might 
destabilize the political situation in the country. Extreme 
nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovskiy said on Saturday that his 
Liberal Democratic Party would not sign the accord unless 
Yeltsin dismissed Anatoliy Chubays as deputy prime minister and 
chairman of the State Property Committee, Andrey Kozyrev as 
foreign minister and Viktor Yerin as interior minister.

<F P=106> [Lyubov Tsukanova article: "Accord Must Mature Within </F>
Society. At the Moment, However, Only the Politicians Are 
Active"] 
  [Text] A Civic Accord Assembly will be convened in the 
Kremlin on 28 April for the signing of the Agreement on Civil 
Peace. The document will be open for amendments, comments, and 
suggestions until 20 April. 
  Thus there is very little time left. However, no great 
activeness has been observed yet among the potential parties to 
the agreement. 
  The Social Democratic Party of Russia has clearly announced 
its readiness to sign the memorandum. The Party of 
Consolidation supports the idea of the agreement. The Majority 
Party, one of the "newest" Russian parties, has expressed its 
attitude toward the contract. It is a very ambivalent attitude, 
let us note: While supporting the idea of consensus itself, the 
party's leadership has announced a readiness to affiliate to the 
agreement only if it is substantially reworked. 
  Given that according to fundamental political, economic, 
social, moral, and ethical criteria there exist not just 
different but even opposing viewpoints, it may be that even 
those political forces which are amenable to accord will not be 
able to agree "point by point" and that the memorandum will be 
signed by only those few opposition organizations which even 
without a special agreement are taking part in political 
activity on a strictly constitutional basis and according to 
constructive principles. 
  But it is the passivity of the population which is surely 
the 
most worrying factor. Of course, the nonparticipation of the 
overwhelming majority of citizens in the conciliation process is 
not evidence of the indifference of the masses toward their own 
fate and that of the country but is the result, on the one hand, 
of the exceptionally weak influence of political organizations 
among the masses and, on the other, of a fairly formal attitude 
toward the process on the part of the power structures at all 
levels. 
  There is a third reason as well. Many (not only in number 
but also in scope) nonpolitical and social organizations -- 
various types of unions, societies, associations, and 
foundations -- have been excluded from the conciliation process. 
Reliance on a party whose only interest lies in the struggle 
for power is surely less promising as regards accord than the 
involvement in the peacemaking process of nonpoliticized 
associations which have a much broader base among the masses, 
are the fundation of a civic society, and could form a 
reasonable, calm, and constructive counterweight to the 
politicians' ambitious aspirations.

effect should have real substance. A serious partnership 
requires closer political coordination, Andrey Kozyrev said to 
journalists today. 
  The relations of true partnership should rule out situations 
where important measures are being taken without consulting 
Russia in areas where close cooperation is needed -- as in, for 
example, looking for a solution to the Bosnia crisis, Kozyrev 
said. Moscow is interested in a serious agreement, stressed 
Kozyrev. 
  He also noted that all the sides involved will perhaps need 
some time to reflect on what it is that they want exactly. 
Russia intends to propose its own, really substantial draft 
agreement to NATO. We want a true, serious partnership, said 
the Russian foreign minister.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Pavel Kuznetsov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 18 Apr -- If Russia does not join the 
Partnership for Peace program, the world could be returned to a 
cold war situation, in the view of Sergey Yushenkov, chairman of 
the Duma defense committee. He announced this at a news 
conference today in the lower chamber of the Federal Assembly. 
Sergey Yushenkov said he is surprised at the position of the 
Russian Federation's executive authority, "which is not trying 
to demonstrate the advantage of Russia joining the Partnership." 
  The Russian Federation president, defense minister, and 
foreign minister should immediately declare their intention to 
join the program, in spite of the latest events in former 
Yugoslavia, Sergey Yushenkov asserted. At the same time, he 
stressed, those who "made the decision to carry out the bombing 
near Gorazde should admit their error." 
  The Duma committee chairman noted that a new situation has 
come about in relations between the West and Russia following 
the bombing of Serb positions. The Russian foreign minister's 
refusal to sign the document was the result of this. "The air 
strikes," Sergey Yushenkov stressed, "mark the end of the 
`romantic' phase of our relationship. Further divergence of our 
views, even including a break-up, is now possible. Or else our 
relations can develop on a completely pragmatic basis, in which 
the real interests of the sides will be heeded." 
  Speaking in favor of joining Partnership for Peace, the Duma 
committee chairman stressed that in his view this document does 
not contain a single initiative which has not already been 
proposed, in one form or another, by the leadership of the USSR 
and the Russian Federation. 
  Referring to the main "trump card" held by Russian opponents 
of the Partnership -- the claim that the document does not 
reflect "the Russian Federation's special status as a great 
nuclear power" -- Sergey Yushenkov noted that only Russia 
itself, by taking part in the program, can determine this 
status. "If Russia really does want to maintain this status, it 
has more interest in signing this document than other 
countries," he stressed. 
  Sergey Yushenkov believes that membership of the Partnership 
does not in any way mean that the Russian Federation will join 
NATO in due course. In his view, the program is "just one of 
the steps toward the building of a new system of universal 
security." The program itself, he noted, is "merely a protocol 
of intent -- the attitude which Russia does eventually take 
during possible involvement in Partnership-sponsored measures is 
another matter."

  [Text] Moscow, 19 Apr -- Russia "should not hasten to join 
NATO's Partnership for Peace [PFP] program," Federation Council 
Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko told reporters today. 
  The main thing in joining is "the reciprocity of partnership 
and a clear mechanism for implementing decisions," he said, 
stressing that the recent air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs, 
"when the decision was made not even by NATO but by the U.S. 
command, showed that a mechanism of this kind does not exist 
even at the level of the United Nations and the Security 
Council." 
  Shumeyko drew particular attention to the need for a 
mechanism "that will emphasize that all states in the 
partnership are absolutely equal." 
  "Further developments will show how the peace process will 
evolve," Vladimir Shumeyko said. 
  Under the Russian Constitution, it is the Federation Council 
that is responsible for the use of troops outside the country.

  [Text] The Chechen Republic will hold talks with Russia 
only through the Foreign Ministry. INTERFAX correspondents 
report that this decision was taken at the session of the 
Chechen Government on Friday [15 April]. 
  In an interview with INTERFAX the Chechen president's aide 
Soltmurat Apazov said that this means raising the status of 
talks to the level of inter-state ones. According to the Chechen 
president Djokhar Dudayev, the step was taken to regulate the 
relationships between the two states. As it has become known to 
Interfax, the matter was discussed in telephone talks between 
the Dudayev and his representative in Moscow. This emphasizes 
the fact, said Dudayev, that the Chechen Republic does not 
consider itself the subject of the Russian Federation.

  [Text] Leaders of political organizations opposed to Johar 
Dudayev, president of the separatist Russian Republic of 
Chechnya, are due to meet in Moscow on Monday, a source in 
Chechnya opposition headquarters told INTERFAX, but he declined 
to name any of the subjects to be discussed at the meeting. 
  Meanwhile, the leader of Chechnya's Marsho (Freedom) 
opposition party, Abdulla Bugayev, complained that some Russian 
leaders were trying "to reach a compromise with the Dudayev 
regime in disregard of the interests of the Chechen people and 
the entire multinational population of the Republic." 
  "Only somebody who is not a serious politician can speak 
about the recognition of the legitimacy of the bloody regime in 
[the Chechnya capital] Grozny, which has done everything to 
discredit the idea of the construction of a national sovereign 
state," Bugayev said to INTERFAX on Monday. 
  Criticizing Russian Economics Minister Valeriy Fateyev's 
recent statement that the economic situation in Chechnya is 
under control, Bugayev said anything that had not yet been 
plundered by various clans "is under the control of spontaneous 
forces and not under that of a well-considered policy." 
  "The people of Chechnya are tired both of the tyrannical 
regime of Dudayev and of the inconsistent and uncertain position 
of Moscow... A spontaneous eruption may take place, which may 
have very grave consequences," he said. 
  Bugayev said Chechnya needed free democratic elections. "The 
democratic forces of Chechnya are not going to abandon this 
position, even if the Federation Council of the Russian 
Federation or any other body of authority decides to recognize 
the legitimacy of the regime of Johar Dudayev," he said.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Lyudmila Yermakova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow April 19 TASS -- A long-range plan of 
integration of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) is 
to be worked out by the Councils of Defence Ministers and of 
Foreign Ministers of the CIS by September 9, said Vladimir 
Shumeyko, chairman of Russia's Federation Council. The document 
being drafted on Boris Yeltsin's initiative is to determine how 
the Commonwealth develops in the areas of economy, policy and 
interstate relations, Shumeyko told reporters on Tuesday. 
  The head of the Interparliamentary Assembly of the CIS 
believes that the striving for closer economic cooperation was 
manifested at a meeting of heads of state of CIS countries in 
Moscow. He believes that the economic integration will lead to 
political integration and that the concept of the development of 
the CIS is important in this connection. Nazarbayev's proposal 
for the creation of a Eurasian union prompts this, Shumeyko said. 
  Shumeyko believes that changes in the CIS regulations will 
follow. Specifically, it should be stipulated that members of 
the CIS should not be in a state of war with each other. He 
said that Armenia and Azerbaijan are meant, above all. 
  Regarding the signing of the Russian-Belarussian 
[Belarusian] 
agreement on unifying the monetary systems, Shumeyko surmised 
that there will be no objections from the Federation Council to 
the ratification of the document. "It is necessary to visualise 
the ways of rapprochement of member-countries of the 
Commonwealth without infringing their sovereignty and freedoms," 
believes the speaker of the upper house of the Russian 
parliament. He said that the growing economic closeness of 
Russia and Belarus should only be encouraged as this has been 
the purpose of the entire previous economic policy.

  [Text] The head of state's press secretariat has stated 
that Head of State Eduard Shevardnadze today met Mr. Bosham, an 
adviser from the European Union. The conversation centered on 
the complex situation of the Georgian economy and solutions to 
this problem. 
  The head of state mentioned that the situation in Georgia is 
so grave that a specific social solution has to be found. There 
are acute problems in power engineering and grain supplies; 
inflation is rising. Therefore, regulating solely the tax 
system will not resolve all the problems provided the rest of 
the issues are settled, to which end the efforts of the supreme 
authorities are directed [sentence as heard]. 
  Mr. Boshman agreed with the head of state and said that it 
is time realistic actions are carried out in order to get out of 
the situation, all the more when east European countries have 
had an experience of it.

  [Text] A total of 100 servicemen from the Ukrainian 
military contingency of the UN peace-keeping battalion have left 
Kiev for ex-Yugoslavia. The Ukrainian Defense Ministry told 
INTERFAX-Ukraine that several diplomats, including the Ukrainian 
Foreign Ministry's Envoy, Andrey Ozadovskiy, had left for the 
conflict zone by the same plane. 
  The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry's press service said the 
Ukrainian diplomatic mission had left for ex-Yugoslavia in order 
to examine the situation in the region where the Ukrainian 
battalion was stationed and to conduct consultations on the 
issue. 
  The 550 men of the new contingency will be stationed near 
Gorazde. The Ukrainian servicemen were trained in the 
Prikarpatsky Military District. 
  The Ukrainian military contingency will be transported to 
ex-Yugoslavia by four flights. This will take three days. 
Ukraine is expected to have a 1,200-man military contingency in 
the region. The latest figure for the Ukrainian battalion in 
Bosnia and Herzegovina was 500 servicemen. 
  For the period of the Ukrainian battalion's presence in 
Sarajevo six servicemen have been killed and about 30 wounded.

<F P=106> [Report on the "Statement by Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign </F>
Affairs"] 
  [Text] In connection with the 13 April information carried 
by "Ostankino" (in the "News" program) to the effect that, 
during the negotiations in Kiev, an accord was allegedly reached 
that the sides would resolve the Black Sea Fleet problems based 
on the Massandra Protocol, Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
contends that this does not correspond to reality. Ukraine 
proceeds from the need for a comprehensive approach toward the 
issue of the Black Sea Fleet, taking into account the 
regulations of the Dagomys, Yalta, and Zavidovo Accords, as well 
as of the Massandra Protocol. Nor does the "Ostankino" 
information on the visit to Odessa by a delegation of the 
Russian Federation correspond to reality. 
  Contrary to the accords reached in Kiev, the commander in 
chief of the Russian Navy. S. Gromov, wrecked the meeting with 
the command and officers' personnel of the Black Sea Fleet, a 
meeting that had been planned jointly with the Ukrainian side. 
Such information and actions show who places obstacles to a 
just resolution of the Black Sea Fleet problem.

  [Text] The Ukrainian Navy Commander, Vice Admiral Volodymyr 
Bezkorovaynyy, has urged the republic's sailors to refrain from 
actions that lead to confrontation and agitation. In a message 
to the Ukrainian navy personnel on Monday, he calls for 
preparing within 10 days a new round of talks on naval problems. 
  In his opinion, what happened in Odessa has been settled for 
good, and neither Ukraine nor Russia should refocus on it. He 
also called for displaying restraint, standing firm against 
provocations, and disturbing actions that might complicate 
relations between the Black Sea Fleet and Ukraine's Navy. 
  On the same day, Bezkorovaynyy sent a letter to the Mayor of 
Sevastopol in connection with the city council's plan to discuss 
what happened between the Black Sea Fleet and Ukrainian seamen 
in Odessa on 8-9 April at an emergency session. The message 
blames the incident "on the gross violation of the Ukrainian 
Constitution and laws by some Black Sea Fleet officials." 
  In this connection, Bezkorovaynyy suggested that the council 
consider the expediency of holding an emergency session or of 
postponing it for a later date. 
  In his opinion, by declaring its allegiance to the 
presidents 
of Ukraine and Russia, the Black Sea Fleet has virtually gone 
out of the Ukrainian leadership's control and become subordinate 
to the Russian military alone. All this leads to arbitrariness 
and impunity, he said. 
  According to the agreement signed in Zavidovo in 1992, the 
Black Sea Navy Commander is subordinate to the presidents of 
Ukraine and Russia alone.

  [Text] Lieutenant-Colonel Valeriy Patrikeyev has been 
appointed Commander of the CIS collective peacekeeping forces in 
Tajikistan. The decision was taken at the CIS summit in Moscow 
last week, head of the press center of the headquarters for the 
coordination of military cooperation of the Commonwealth 
countries Serafim Yushkov told INTERFAX on Tuesday. 
  He said that former commander of the CIS collective 
peacekeeping forces in Tajikistan Boris Pyankov and Patrikeyev 
are currently in Moscow. They plan to go to Tajikistan together 
on April 22. It is expected that upon their return to Moscow 
Pyankov will be nominated first deputy commander of the 
headquarters for the coordination of military cooperation of CIS 
countries. 
  Patrikeyev's nomination is explained with the fact that 
Pyankov was appointed by the Council of the CIS heads of states 
on September 24, 1993 for six months. 
  Patrikeyev is 55 years old. He was born in the village of 
Bogolyubovo of the Tambov region in Russia. In 1958 he 
graduated from military school, in 1967 -- the Frunze military 
academy, in 1977 -- the Military Academy of the General 
Headquarters. 
  From 1985 to 1989 Patrikeyev was Commander of the 
Privolzhsky 
military district, and from 1989 to 1992 -- Commander of the 
Transcaucasian military district. Before being appointed 
Commander of the CIS collective peacekeeping forces in 
Tajikistan he was subordinate to the commander-in-chief of the 
Russian Land Forces.

<F P=106> ["Commentary of the Day" by Nikolay Kishkin: "Decisions </F>
Made To Strengthen Commonwealth. The Question Is, How They Will 
Look in Practice"] 
  [Text] How many times have we, after the latest meeting of 
the CIS heads of state, received with ineradicable hope the 
agreements reached. True, we have just as often found that, as 
a rule, they do not work out as planned, or else actually sink 
without trace. It is no accident that the question of 
guarantees of the fulfillment of adopted decisions was 
persistently raised at the summit's concluding press conference, 
held on Friday [15 April]. It cannot be said that Boris 
Yeltsin's reply sounded very optimistic; he said that the 
Council of Heads of State is "not a plant administration in 
which hard-and-fast decisions are adopted"; rather the heads of 
state outline a general framework of joint intentions. All the 
same, the heads of state agreed to monitor the discipline of the 
fulfillment of decisions adopted since the formation of the CIS. 
Better than nothing, as they say... 
  Marked dissatisfaction with the efficiency of the 
Commonwealth's functioning had been expressed in the proposal to 
create a Eurasian union recently put forward by [Kazakhstan 
President] Nursultan Nazarbayev. This idea was expected to 
receive some kind of development at the Moscow summit, but this 
did not happen. The Kazakhstani president himself did not come 
to the meeting, and his fellow heads of state did not discuss 
the proposal. Judging by the contacts which journalists have 
had with them in the lobbies, the idea has so far been cooly 
received. [Uzbekistan President] Islam Karimov, for example, 
said that it is devoid of practical content and the CIS should 
not be abandoned in midstream. Nevertheless, the Kazakhstani 
representative stated that the republic would present a 
comprehensive program for a new alliance at the next summit 
meeting. 
  However, the CIS' reserves of strength are not yet 
exhausted, 
as the Moscow meeting showed. Above all, a number of questions 
aimed at the practical realization of the treaty of economic 
union were examined. Ukraine acceded to it as an associate 
member. An Economic Union Commission was set up -- true, so far 
just as an expert working organ. No less important is the 
agreement on the creation of a free trade zone, in line with 
which customs duties, taxes, and nontariff restrictions in 
mutual trade between the CIS countries will be gradually lifted. 
If this accord proves not to have been a waste of time, it 
could have significant impact. This is effectively the 
beginning of the juridical formulation of a single trading area, 
which will also be more attractive for our "more distant" 
foreign partners, who will accept the CIS free trade zone as a 
single international economic subject. 
  At the meeting in Moscow the issue of securing the CIS' 
external borders, which had been under examination for several 
months, was successfully resolved. A joint memorandum on the 
participation of CIS member countries in guarding external 
borders in the Central Asian region has now been signed, as has 
a similar memorandum involving Ukraine and Belorussia [Belarus]. 
Moldavia [Moldova] is also to accede to this memorandum. In 
this way the unified system of border security is being restored. 
  In the bilateral meetings which took place during the Moscow 
summit let us note the accord between Boris Yeltsin and Leonid 
Kravchuk on the future of the Black Sea Fleet, which they 
decided to share in the proportions of 15-20 percent for 
Ukraine, and the rest for Russia. But this is only a framework 
decision. An agreement on the parameters of this distribution 
has still to be prepared. Judging by the first reactions and by 
how it is being interpreted by some people in Ukraine, 
everything will not be so straightforward. 
  The Moscow summit saw Moldavia's full inclusion in the work 
of the CIS, which now embraces 12 states -- the whole of the 
former Union except for the Baltic countries. Boris Yeltsin 
assessed its prospects as follows: "Despite the difficulties 
encountered in the formation of the Commonwealth, it can be 
firmly stated that we are now going ahead on the road of 
developing and intensifying integration processes."

<F P=106> [Pavel Shinkarenko article under the "Commonwealth" rubric: </F>
"Moscow Meeting Gives New Boost to Integration. The Economy and 
Security Were the Main Topics of Discussion for the Leaders of 
12 Countries"] 
  [Text] The presidents and prime ministers who gathered 
last Friday in the capital of Russia, which chairs the 
Commonwealth's councils, examined more than 35 issues. But 
there were two main topics. First, ways to deepen the 
participating countries' economic integration. Second, the 
states' security and the guarding of the Commonwealth's external 
borders. 
  According to Boris Yeltsin, it is a question, above all, of 
a 
package of decisions aimed at putting the Treaty of Economic 
Union into practice. "Economic Union is the fundamental 
principle of the Commonwealth," he emphasized. "The level of 
integration of the CIS countries as a whole will depend, in the 
final analysis, on progress in this area." 
  Implementing this idea, the participants in the Moscow 
summit 
approved two decisions of fundamental significance. They set up 
the Economic Union Commission and gave the "green light" to the 
creation of a free trade zone. Commenting on these agreements, 
Vladimir Mashchits, Russian Federation minister for cooperation 
with CIS countries, reported that it had originally been planned 
to create a permanently functioning executive and coordinating 
organ of the Economic Union -- the Interstate Economic Committee 
-- and in this connection to abolish the Coordinating 
Consultative Committee. The heads of government and experts, 
however, agreed that it is necessary at present to preserve the 
CIS Coordinating Consultative Committee, but to set up a 
commission of professional economists under it. Its chief 
function is to shape the Economic Union's activity and ensure 
its efficiency. Vladimir Mashchits voiced the opinion that this 
commission might, in time, be transformed into the Interstate 
Economic Committee, which will essentially be a supranational 
organ of the CIS. 
  A free trade zone is also being created to improve the 
effectiveness of cooperation. The agreements that have been 
signed provide, in particular, for the resolution of specific 
tasks at the first stage of the gradual abolition of customs 
duties, taxes, imposts, and nontariff restrictions in reciprocal 
trade. Thanks to this, our experts believe, trade will develop 
more intensively within the Commonwealth, and the single 
economic area will become more attractive to foreign partners. 
  The financial sphere has not been overlooked either. 
Approval was given here to the concept of the Payment Union of 
CIS states, which makes it possible, in time, to arrange 
uninterrupted payments on the basis of the mutual convertibility 
of national currencies. It is proposed that participants in 
trade deals will independently decide on the forms of 
transactions, the currency of the contract price, and the 
currency of payment, while the states must ensure the 
convertibility of national currencies in respect of current 
operations. All the member countries of the Payment Union have 
pledged to adopt all the necessary acts and to pay the 
appropriate sums into the charter fund of the Interstate Bank of 
Multilateral Transactions before 20 May 1994. This bank will 
commence practical work 1 July. 
  A new chapter has also been begun in the history of 
military-political cooperation. The approval for the statute on 
the Defense Ministers Council, which took into account the 
structural changes that have occurred recently, was important 
here. An information report by the chairman of the CIS 
countries' Border Troops Commanders Council on the state of 
cooperation in guarding the Commonwealth's external borders was 
heard. A memorandum was signed on the states' participation in 
guarding the external border in the Central Asian region. 
Agreements were reached with Georgia and Armenia on Russia's 
participation in guarding their external borders. A similar 
agreement with Ukraine and Belorussia [Belarus] was prepared. 
The appropriate departments were instructed to draw up founding 
documents on the creation of an aid fund for the Republic of 
Tajikistan. 
  Even this short list of the problems resolved has shown 
that, 
to use Boris Yeltsin's words, "the Commonwealth states' 
integration aspirations are starting to be turned into practical 
deeds."

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow April 20 ITAR-TASS -- ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI leads 
with a number of reports from Russia's regions concerning the 
memorandum of civic peace proposed by President Boris Yeltsin, 
published under the headline "Russian society wants concord. Do 
its political leaders want the same?". 
  Chairman of the Agrarian Union of the Novgorod Region 
Vladimir Yezhov is quoted as saying that "Mother-Russia and its 
people are sick and tired of the squabbles in the capital. 
Unfortunately their destructive waves reach far and wide, even 
in Novgorod Region. The prevailing instability hampers 
effective land reforms. If we succeed in forgetting hurt 
feelings and rally to reach a great and brilliant goal, we shall 
be able to restore Russia's might and greatness. The fate of 
the country is in the fate of its countryside". 
  The same newspaper carries an interview with Yegor Gaydar in 
his capacity as the leader of the all-Russia association of 
privatized and private enterprises, set up a year ago. "Today 
the point is: Russia will have her chances of economic revival 
only if it develops private businesses. As soon as private 
enterprises begin to invest in the development of production, a 
realist hope will arise for the overcoming of the crisis", 
Gaydar said. 
  RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA interviewed the Democratic Party of 
Russia's economic committee chairman Vladimir Leitland, who said 
that "Russia will long remember Yegor Gaydar as the former 
government leader, because under him "only 57 percent of the 
country's 1990 economic potential remained intact". Leitland 
calls for revising priorities for the transitional period and 
leaving the key industries under direct state control for its 
duration". 
  The newspaper highlights reports about the two-month 
festival 
devoted to the protection of the populace against ecological 
hazards. The festival began on April 15. One report calls 
Moscow one of the fifty ecologically "worst" cities, leading the 
country in the amount of harmful effluents in the atmosphere and 
liquid waste in its rivers and lakes. The newspaper publishes 
an appeal to the citizens of Russia from the organizing 
committee of the two-month action to join the ranks of fighters 
against ecological hazards. 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA splashes the title "Russia has little 
time left to avert a nuclear disaster" above an article about 
preparations for an expedition to the Komsomolets nuclear 
submarine, which sank in the sea of Norway five years ago. The 
article warns about the possible "ejection of the nuclear load" 
from the ill-fated submarine. According to the newspaper, it is 
most important at present to launch and complete an operation to 
"conserve" the sunk submarine before it is too late. 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA carries an interview with Ramazan 
Abdulatipov, deputy chairman of the Federation Council, the 
upper chamber of the Russian parliament, who said that the 
Russian state, even when it acted violently with regard to its 
citizens, was somehow associated in their minds with an image of 
"a severe and even unfair father who nonetheless was looking 
after his children in one way or another". Abdulatipov calls for 
the restoration and strengthening of the power of the state "in 
its new functions and new authority". "The state is as strong as 
its ability to protect the individual", he said. 
  The press pays much attention to PLO Leader Yasir 'Arafat's 
visit to Moscow. He is quoted as saying that the Palestinian 
state favours the convocation of a second Madrid conference on 
the Middle East settlement, and "hopes to see Russia participate 
in the peace-keeping forces" deployed on the occupied 
territories. 
  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA believes that 'Arafat's "meetings in 
Moscow are particularly useful" on the eve of Israeli Premier 
Yitzhaq Rabin's visit to Russia. 
  TRUD (Labour) leads with reports about spring fieldwork, 
which is particularly difficult this year because thousands upon 
thousands of hectares of land have been inundated by spring 
floods, and Russian farmers often find themselves lacking the 
essentials for coping with the task. More than 80 percent of 
all farmers no longer "hope for government assistance", the 
newspaper says. "One third of them lack fuel, seeds and 
equipment. Few have secured loans ahead of sowing, and those 
who have are awed by the crushing 200-percent interests on the 
loans". Specialists predict that grain production is likely to 
dwindle to 80 million tonnes this year, 24 million tonnes less 
than the 1986-1990 average. 
  PRAVDA carries and interview with deputy head of the 
institute of informatics of the Russian Academy of Sciences, 
Shota Chipashvili, who speaks about the great role played by the 
late academic Vladimir Semenikhin in designing and developing 
the country's single automated system of control over its armed 
forces. "Classified information that was uncovered recently 
makes it clear that Semenikhin ranks with such great figures in 
Russian Science as (nuclear researcher) Igor Kurchatov and 
(chief designer of space vehicles) Sergey Korolyov.

  [Text] Boris Nemtsov remains the governor of the Nizhniy 
Novgorod region in Povolzhye. At the same time, President Boris 
Yeltsin dismissed Nemtsov from the post of presidential 
representative in the Nizhniy Novgorod region which he had so 
far combined with the post of governor. This was reported to 
INTERFAX by Yevgeniy Krestyaninov, who was appointed by Yeltsin 
as presidential representative in the Nizhniy Novgorod region. 
  Krestyaninov was chairman of the former Nizhniy Novgorod 
regional council of people's deputies. Together with Nemtsov on 
December 12, 1993, he was elected a member of the Federation 
Council of the Federal Assembly from the Nizhniy Novgorod region. 
  According to Krestyaninov, he was recommended to the post of 
the presidential representative by Nemtsov. "Our region was the 
only one where the posts of the presidential representative and 
the governor were combined," he explained. 
  Krestyaninov noted that he and Nemtsov had good business 
relations which he hopes will promote further development of 
constructive relations between the Nizhniy Novgorod region and 
the federal authorities. In the meantime, the press attache of 
the Nizhniy Novgorod regional administration Mikhail Levin told 
INTERFAX that Nemtsov himself proposed to dismiss him as the 
presidential representative in the Nizhniy Novgorod region. 
  He was appointed as presidential representative in the 
region 
by Yeltsin's decree in the autumn of 1991. Later by another 
decree Nemtsov was appointed the governor of the Nizhniy 
Novgorod region, in contradiction of the previous decision.

<F P=106> [Interview with A.Ya. Livshits, leader of Russian Federation </F>
president's group of experts, by ITAR-TASS observer Tamara 
Zamyatina; place and date not given: "The Political Pendulum 
Might Swing to the Left, But There Are Still Lots of Things for 
Conservative Governments To Do in the Country, Aleksandr 
Livshits, Leader of the Russian Federation President's Group of 
Experts, Believes"] 
  [Text] [Zamyatina] Aleksandr Yakovlevich, the mutual 
influence of politics and economics is an obvious concept. 
Proceeding from this, how do you rate the unification of the 
monetary systems of Russia and Belorussia [Belarus]? 
  [Livshits] I believe that Russia will lose nothing as a 
result of this unification, if three conditions are fulfilled. 
First, monetary and credit emission must be carried out only by 
the Central Bank of the Russian Federation. Second, the Central 
Bank must act on the basis of Russian legislation and be guided 
by the maintenance of a weak inflationary regime on the 
territories of both countries. The third condition is that 
Belorussian money must be exchanged for rubles at the market 
rate, not at one "hare" [Belarusian currency] to the ruble. 
  The first condition is provided for in the agreement which 
has been concluded. There is no clarity with regard to the 
second condition. The third has not been abided by. This means 
that potential harm to Russia's economic interests cannot be 
ruled out. Therefore changes to Belorussia's legislation are 
needed for the real unification of the monetary systems. 
  [Zamyatina] What do you think: Will the union of monetary 
systems with Belorussia promote the political integration of the 
CIS states? 
  [Livshits] It is only in this case that it makes sense. If 
politicians show signs of moving toward a confederation -- signs 
equally strong as in the majority of citizens -- they will be 
supported by the population. But political rapprochement is 
something for the future, and national interests must not be 
waived either in the future or in the present. 
  [Zamyatina] Since you do not rule out harm to Russia's 
economic interests because of the political decisions being 
adopted by our leaders, what is your forecast of the state of 
the Russian Federation economy in the immediate future? 
  [Livshits] April and early May are a time for adopting 
urgent decisions on the reform. The economy can no longer drag 
the load of enterprises without prospects and hopeless debtors. 
It will strain itself. Unlike 1992, an attempt to save them by 
inflationary means will cost a monthly increase in prices at the 
level of 40-50 percent. This would be a real disaster. We have 
approached the threshold of crucial decisions comparable with 
those made at the end of 1991. We must cross it within the next 
few months: the implementation of the bankruptcy procedure, the 
organization of promissory note circulation, the new stage of 
privatization, the activation of Russian investors from the 
private sector, the reinstatement of the management of state 
enterprises, tough measures to strengthen financial discipline. 
  At present we are keeping monthly inflation down to 8-10 
percent. By the yardsticks of developed countries, this is very 
high. But by CIS yardsticks it is a record. Russia is now the 
only CIS state where the population's incomes grew faster than 
prices in the first quarter of 1994. The position of Russians 
as a whole is also better in terms of the absolute standard of 
living. In February 1994 it was possible to buy twice as much 
meat in Moscow on the average monthly Russian wage as on the 
average Belorussian wage in Minsk, and 32 times more than on the 
average Armenian wage in Yerevan. So there. 
  [Zamyatina] Preparations are under way in Russia for the 
parade of political forces scheduled for 1996. How do you rate 
the chances of the aspirants to the post of leader of the state? 
  [Livshits] If you were to ask the question, which of them is 
to be trusted, I would say: not those who covet power but those 
who know what to do with it later and how to turn it into 
something good for the country. 
  It cannot be ruled out that the political pendulum will move 
to the left. Not just because of miscalculations by reformers, 
who gave little thought to the costs of market transformations. 
The point is that there has always been a great reserve of 
social discontent in Russia. It still exists. Many people will 
be found who believe that the market processes are not going the 
way they should and result in unfair inequality. They will look 
for reasons and explanations. Not within themselves but in the 
social system and in bad power structures. This is the national 
tradition, and it will not be possible to break it. 
  The wave of discontent which raised up right-wingers in 
1991-1992 could well raise left-wingers in 1996. 
  This will be no tragedy if the reform of the economic 
mechanism makes serious progress in the next two years and the 
situation stabilizes. Maybe influential left-wing parties which 
have nothing to do with the CPSU will be formed during this 
time, and the voter will at last see that every communist is a 
left-winger, but not every left-winger is a communist. 
  At present there are still lots of things for conservative 
governments to do in the country. Only they are capable of 
completing the edifice of a market economy. When it is ready 
and starts to be filled with property, the time will come for 
some internal replanning. Left-wingers will have nothing to do 
at the summit of power until that which they will later share 
has been accumulated -- share in fairness or according to some 
other principle. 
  World practice unequivocally attests that the most 
intelligent socialist, if, of course, he firmly follows his own 
convictions, knows how to fight inflation far worse than the 
shabbiest conservative. 
  While there is no stability, the country needs a strong 
democratic power and a conservative, deideologized, professional 
government. Everything else is only harmful.

<F P=106> [Yekaterina Deynego, Yevgeniy Krasnikov report under the </F>
"Party Organization" rubric: "Opposition Regains Strength. 
Officers Union, Russian State Party Have Held Congresses"] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] The first congress of the 
Russian Power Party [Rossiyskaya Derzhavnaya Partiya] was held 
on 17 April. It was organized by Officers Union's activists 
under Stanislav Terekhov and representatives of a number of 
left-wing and patriotic organizations and movements (Russian 
Federation Communist Party (CPRF), Cossack unions, and so 
forth). To all appearances, the new organization will be 
modeled on the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (a charismatic 
leader, strict internal hierarchy) and is apparently designed as 
an alternative to it. Stanislav Terekhov said in his address 
that the new party's closest allies should be the CPRF 
("Zyuganov's party") and the Russian Orthodox Church. The 
congress delegates received a paper entitled "On Statehood," 
which, to all appearances, will become the new party's 
ideological platform. The state-patriotic document was drawn up 
jointly by Officers Union and CPRF experts. 
  Prospects for an alliance between the state patriots and the 
CPRF, however, will become clear only after the Communist 
Party's second All-Russia conference, scheduled for 23-24 April. 
During the conference, the party leaders will have to resolve 
the dilemma: either they enter the Union of Communist Parties -- 
the CPSU, hewing to the principles of proletarian 
internationalism and uncompromising struggle against the current 
regime; or continue as a left-wing state-patriotic party of 
constructive opposition. Although on 16 April the Moscow branch 
of the CPRF decided at Yegor Ligachev's initiative to raise the 
question of the CPRF's joining the CPSU at the upcoming 
conference, the proposal is unlikely to be adopted. "Zyuganov's 
party" is gradually becoming a more and more respectable and 
law-abiding organization that tries to avoid unnecessary 
conflicts with the current authorities. Typically, its leaders 
are inclined to hold May Day festivities together with the trade 
unions, not Viktor Anpilov's communists (this decision was made 
by the CPRF Moscow branch and others). 
  One possible form of the CPRF's coalition with the patriotic 
forces may become the Public Committee for the Rule of Law and 
People's Power, which was set up yesterday, including both 
communists and patriots: Stanislav Terekhov, Sergey Baburin, 
Viktor Ilyukhin, and others.

<F P=106> [Yekaterina Achalova report: "Opposition Unites Once Again. </F>
New Coalition Wants To Do Without Rutskoy and Zorkin"] 
  [Text] The intransigent opposition has decided to jettison 
its former "October" leaders. Yesterday, a Public Committee for 
the Rule of Law and People's Power was set up in Moscow to 
replace the National Salvation Front [NSF], which was banned 
right after the October events. The committee's objective will 
be to continue extra-parliamentary struggle and to coordinate 
the activities of the left-wing and patriotic movements in all 
regions of Russia. 
  It is expected that the Public Committee for the Rule of Law 
and People's Power will be based primarily on the former 
structures of the NSF, the Officers Union, the Russian 
All-People's Union, and other patriotic and left-wing 
organizations. The new committee's founding fathers include 
such well-known political figures as State Duma deputies Sergey 
Baburin, Vladimir Isakov, Yuriy Vlasov, and also Lieutenant 
Colonel Stanislav Terekhov. KOMMERSANT-DAILY has learned that 
during preliminary meetings, which took place in an atmosphere 
of strictest secrecy, they decided not to associate the 
organization with people who have been blamed for the 
opposition's defeat in October -- Aleksandr Rutskoy, Ilya 
Konstantinov, Aleksandr Sterligov, and Viktor Anpilov. It was 
also decided not to give support to the "Accord for Russia" 
movement set up by Aleksandr Rutskoy and Valeriy Zorkin. 
  Given that the Public Committee's predecessor -- the 
National 
Salvation Front -- was effectively a club of Moscow politicians, 
the new coalition's organizers decided to boost their influence 
in the workers movement. The committee's priority objective was 
defined as the penetration of the fuel-and-energy and 
military-industrial sector trade unions in order to persuade 
them to switch from economic to political demands when calling 
strikes. The main political demands should include the 
resignation of the government and early presidential elections. 
  According to the strategy devised by the Public Committee, 
one of its "power" centers will be the Officers Union and the 
Russian Power Party [Rossiyskaya Derzhavnaya Partiya] being set 
up by its activists (their congresses were held last weekend). 
It is expected that the Officers Union will step up its 
campaigning in the Russian Armed Forces and prod servicemen into 
voicing demands similar to those of the trade unions. Another 
fairly noteworthy development was the participation in the 
Officers Union congress by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, who has 
shunned contacts with the intransigent opposition since his 
election to the State Duma. Now he asked the officers to see 
him as their ally, and also recommended that they penetrate "the 
rear of the enemy -- the party of authority" -- so as to know in 
advance about the expected actions by the authorities and to be 
ready to counter them.

<F P=106> [Sergey Turchenko report: "Officers' Council"] </F>
  [Text] The Second All-Union Congress of the Officers' 
Union was held in Moscow 16-17 April. It was perhaps the most 
impressive forum of the officers' patriotic movement to date in 
terms of the number of delegations and guests: There were 184 
delegates from 21 regions, including nine republics of the 
former USSR. One hundred and fourteen guests took part in the 
work of the congress: These included well-known leaders of 
opposition tendencies and parties such as Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, 
Aleksandr Barkashov, Sergey Baburin, Sazhi Umalatova, Yuriy 
Vlasov, Iona Andronov, Vladislav Achalov, and Ivan Shashiashvili. 
  Given that almost all of them addressed the assembly, the 
picture of the contemporary state of society given by the 
congress was composed of a wide spectrum of views and 
assessments from diverse wings of the opposition. On the main 
and fundamental issue of today those views proved to be similar, 
augmenting and developing the report by Lieutenant Colonel 
Stanislav Terekhov, chairman of the Officers' Union, and the 
reports by regional delegates. 
  The economic situation in the former USSR was described as 
catastrophic. The defense and security of the former USSR are in 
an equally catastrophic state. The congress also expressed the 
unanimous view that there is no possibility of reviving a great 
union state under the current regime. At the same time it was 
stressed that the achievement of this aim sacred to every 
patriot should be carried out in a prudent and well-considered 
way to avoid giving reactionary forces even the slightest 
opportunity to provoke a civil war. A civil war benefits only 
those bent on covering their traces and fending off 
accountability for crimes committed against the peoples of the 
USSR. 
  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy urged those present to join his party 
amd "pressure" the regime from within it. The reply from the 
presidium was that the Officers' Union is an autonomous, 
independent organization, but it is always ready to cooperate 
with those who act for the country's good. Delegates asked 
Zhirinovskiy to support their demands for the restoration of 
officers' assemblies in units and combined units, which were 
unlawfully suppressed by the "democratic" regime. 
  Serious concern was expressed at the congress that despite 
the opposition's renunciation of all strong-arm methods of 
waging struggle, representatives of the regime are ready to stop 
at nothing to hold on to the power that is slipping out of their 
hands. In this context the planned exercise involving 27 
[Russian] motorized infantry divisions and three U.S. mechanized 
divisions near Orenburg was seen as the first step in preparing 
foreign military intervention to preserve the regime. 
  Speakers reported alarming facts which indicate that a 
bloody 
provocation is being prepared for the May holiday as grounds for 
introducing a state of emergency, which the regime has long 
craved, since it is no longer able to stay in power without 
weapons. 
  In closed session the congress formulated counterprovocation 
tactics, analyzed the state of Officers' Union organizations at 
local level, and defined the immediate tasks of the officers' 
movement. 
  The breaks between sessions saw people actively joining the 
Officers' Union. Russian Federation People's Deputy Iona 
Andronov set the example here, reading out from the rostrum his 
own application to join the patriotic organization as a reserve 
junior officer. 
  On 17 April the officer-delegates held the constituent 
congress of the Power Party [Derzhavnaya Partiya], the nucleus 
of which is formed by the Officers' Union. These organizations' 
aims and tasks were declared to be the same. But the party's 
social base will be broader. Not just officers, but any 
patriots who share its program can join.
