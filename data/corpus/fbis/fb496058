<F P=106> [Interview with State Duma Deputy Valentin Tatarchuk by Lev </F>
Korneshov; date and place not given: "State Duma Deputy 
Valentin Tatarchuk: There Is No Going Back to the Past"] 
  [Text] [Korneshov] Valentin Ivanovich, you are known as a 
State Duma deputy and executive secretary of the "Russia's 
Choice" faction. What post do you occupy in the leadership of 
the new party of the same name? 
  [Tatarchuk] So far we have a provisional party name but the 
party itself does not yet exist. It is my and my colleagues' 
job to form it. What some of us are going to be will be 
determined by the constituent congress during the selection of 
the party's leading organs. Naturally, after its program and 
rules have been approved. Right now I am deputy chairman of the 
organizing committee to form the party. 
  [Korneshov] What exactly do you, the new party's founders, 
mean by the words Russia's choice? The choice of capitalism or 
some other path? 
  [Tatarchuk] We are retaining the name of the election bloc 
and of our parliamentary faction in order to stress the genetic 
link to the movement to which a considerable number of voters 
gave their votes last December. It is on this basis that the 
party program is now being elaborated. Naturally, it will be 
refined and expanded. But it will retain the fundamental 
approaches to questions concerning the Federation, economics, 
ethnic policy, and foreign policy, and to social problems. To 
us there is an obvious need for the sound reformation of our 
state in order to create a reliable market economy, freedom of 
choice for people, protection of human rights, freedom of 
enterprise, protection of private ownership, and to create 
normal conditions to develop all types of ownership, while 
realizing that state ownership in this country will not 
disappear overnight. 
  [Korneshov] What sort of social base does your party have? 
  [Tatarchuk] It seems to us that many people involved in 
ownership are now appearing as a result of the reforms. This is 
the nascent stratum of entrepreneurs. As a result of voucher 
privatization tens of millions of Russians are becoming 
shareholders, that is to say private owners, and private farming 
is developing. 
  [Korneshov] It is known that you will try to rely on the 
workers aristocracy for support. I have a question here: Is 
there such a thing as the workers aristocracy in Russia today, 
in conditions when ZIL is closed and the giants of Altay and 
other industrial regions are becoming idle maybe not forever but 
for a long time? 
  [Korneshov] The workers aristocracy is a somewhat unhappily 
chosen term. It refers to the section of workers who are fairly 
highly skilled and who realize that reform must be purposeful 
and accelerated, but without a further fall in the social level. 
  [Korneshov] It is known that to a considerable extent the 
political orientation of parties, movements, and their leaders 
can now be determined by their attitude toward the president and 
government.... 
  [Tatarchuk] We are prepared to work constructively in 
parliament with the government and president until such time as 
the government and president support the advance of the reforms. 
If the reverse process is observed we will, of course, state 
this and defend our line. 
  [Korneshov] You have had meetings with the president. 
Could you interpret a little of what was discussed at them for 
our readers? 
  [Tatarchuk] We briefed the president on the work we are 
doing to create a parliamentary-type political party on a 
platform known to the president. And on questions associated 
with the slowing down of reforms and the growth of national 
extremism. 
  [Korneshov] At your press conference Organizing Committee 
Chairman Yegor Timurovich Gaydar said in passing that all of us 
in Russia are Marxist-educated people. As we know, 
Marxists-Leninists believed that the most effective way to 
create a party is to set up a party-wide newspaper. Will you, 
Valentin Ivanovich, have your own press? 
  [Tatarchuk] That is our dream. But you work for a newspaper 
and know what that costs nowadays, whereas we do not have such 
resources. We will rely on already existing publications, 
specifically on the regional press, which in our opinion needs 
special support. 
  [Korneshov] Valentin Ivanovich, since we are talking about 
finances.... What do you see as the main sources of funding for 
the party's activity? 
  [Tatarchuk] We hope that those people and those already 
established structures which believe that the reform process 
needs to be made irreversible and continued will give the party 
material support. We are setting up a fund and are counting on 
the fact that our supporters will contribute what they can to 
it. The party will also have a system of membership dues. 
Although we do not see our party as a mass, amorphous party. 
  [Korneshov] Please tell us whether the attempt, if it did 
indeed take place, to involve [singer] Alla Borisovna Pugacheva 
and other popular people in the process of forming the party was 
really an attempt or just rumors. 
  [Tatarchuk] I would like to say that we have made no attempt 
whatever to "involve" anybody in the party. This applies to 
Alla Borisovna too. Initially she agreed to sign an address on 
the party's formation, but then behaved somewhat strangely. But 
that is really her affair. 
  [Korneshov] Valentin Ivanovich, there are now a multitude of 
parties in Russia and the vast majority of them are salon 
parties, what I call invisible parties. But there are still 
parties which enjoy a certain popularity. Which of them do you 
see as your natural allies? 
  [Tatarchuk] Indeed, several parties and movements could 
unite in blocs to achieve certain aims. Essentially some of our 
fundamental approaches toward solving the most important 
problems coincide with those of the "12 December" group, 
"Yabloko".... This formation of blocs in parliament would make 
sense. In many respects our tendencies also coincide with those 
of the Party of Russian Unity and Accord and a considerable 
number of the "New Regional Policy" group's members. 
  [Korneshov] So we are talking about a very broad democratic 
bloc? 
  [Tatarchuk] That is our main task -- to unite democrats in 
the face of the impending danger of a backward slide and the 
threat of fascism. Now is not the time to share out portfolios 
or leadership.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow April 19 TASS -- Russian political parties 
and public organisations assess quite differently the draft 
agreement on civic concord, submitted for approval by the 
Russian president. Their assessments range from support in 
principle (although not without reservations) to unequivocal 
unacceptance. 
  The Russian Party of Free Labour (RPFL) has on the whole 
supported the appeal of the public chamber under the Russian 
president. However, as noted in its recently released 
statement, "the proposed form of civic concord in Russia 
envisages few mutual political guarantees by the agreement's 
signatories, ensuring its achievement". The party believes that 
"the governing structures demand more guarantees from public 
movements, without ensuring social-political stability by 
reciprocal readiness to make concessions and compromises". The 
document, the RPFL believes, does not clearly fix the concrete 
responsibility of governing structures for possible deviations 
from the initialled agreement. 
  The All-Russia "Business Roundtable" Association has 
supported the principles on which the draft on the civic concord 
agreement is based "in spite of some disturbing theses", and has 
urged all the political parties and movements to actively help 
work out mechanisms for its implementation. 
  The Association of Private Farmers and Agricultural 
Cooperatives of Russia believes that the president and the 
government should assume a commitment in the agreement to 
steadfastly expand the land reform. 
  The "New Russian School", a foundation which rallies 
teachers, higher and secondary school instructors, workers of 
juvenile and cultural-educational establishments, has announced 
its support to the draft agreement. 
  The Club of "Realists", a moderate centrist organisation, 
headed by Yuriy Petrov, chairman of the State Investment 
Corporation, has released a statement objecting to "an illusion 
of concord or specially concocted myth about concord". The 
members of the club believe that everything in this agreement 
"testifies either to the naivety of its authors or to their 
desire to use this text merely as a tactical weapon to combat 
everybody who dares not share these or other aspects of the 
policy pursued by the administration and the government". At 
the best, the document will play no role at all, and at the 
worst (and this is most probable) will increase the existing 
social confrontation, the authors of the statement claim. They 
have advanced other principles on which, in their opinion, the 
civic concord agreement should be based.

<F P=106> [Gleb Cherkasov report in the "Weekend" column: "Party </F>
Activists Have Had a Busy Weekend"] 
  [Excerpt] The past weekend has been rich in party events. 
On 16 April, the Party of Russian Unity and Accord's [PRES] 
Federal Council Presidium held its session which considered the 
results scored by PRES regional organizations in local elections 
(out of 122 candidates to local power bodies, 27 representatives 
of the Shakhray party have been elected). Furthermore, the PRES 
leadership discussed preparations for a "Russia-wide subbotnik 
[day of voluntarily donated work] of civil reconciliation" as 
well as a number of questions related to PRES' future activity. 
  On the same day the People's Party Free Russia's [PPFR] 
Council met for a session. PPFR honorary chairman Aleksandr 
Rutskoy and State Duma deputy Vasiliy Lipitskiy took part in its 
work. The session participants shared their impressions from 
their organization's activity in the recent period, making a 
number of decisions aimed at invigorating the performance of 
party structures, and also discussed changes and amendments in 
the PPFR's program and rules. The "Rutskoy party" is expected 
to acquire a "social-democratic" character, but the final 
decision about the PPFR's ideological makeup will be made at a 
party congress scheduled for the end of May. It is not ruled 
out that a number of regional organizations of the "Rutskoy 
party" will also take part in the congress of a new movement, 
Accord for Russia [Soglasiye Radi Rossii], which is also to open 
in May. Meanwhile, PPFR leader Vasiliy Lipitskiy deemed it 
essential to express his negative attitude to the pending 
signing of the Memorandum on Civil Peace, noting that real civil 
accord can be based only on a radical change of course by the 
ruling elite and the abandonment of "reforms for reforms' sake." 
Pointing to the high likelihood of a major social explosion in 
the very near future, Mr. Lipitskiy stated that "in such a 
situation, public association leaders cannot sign with these 
authorities an agreement that envisions preservation of the 
status quo without running the risk of parting with their social 
base." [passage omitted]

and human rights, and carry its share of responsibility for the 
implementation of the agreement," says the document. 
  The statement was reported by the Russian president staff's

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Lyudmila Yermakova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow April 19 TASS -- The agreement on civil peace 
and accord will be signed by the majority of political forces in 
the Kremlin on April 28, upper chamber speaker Vladimir Shumeyko 
said in an interview with journalists here on Tuesday. He 
claimed that "the influence of constructive forces in society 
now is greater than that of right- and left-wing radicals". 
  In the speaker's opinion, it will become clear at the 
agreement's signing ceremony who and why does not sign the 
document leading to civil accord. The division of political 
forces into groups will be clearly seen at that time. However, 
if somebody does not sign the agreement, this will not split the 
society, since the document will be open for signing after April 
28, he stressed. 
  Asked about the influence of political forces in Russia's 
life, Shumeyko noted that "centrist parties have a prospect to 
become influential". This will take place when society will 
"outgrow an yearn for rallies". The speaker believes that the 
influence of political parties on Russia is now "purely 
nominal". In contrast to Moscow, many in provinces do not know 
what political parties mean and what their role is. People 
judge about them by actions of their leaders. 
  Shumeyko claimed that the Russian president should not rely 
on a single party. He should be "above party movements and rely 
on the average derivative in order to find the only correct 
solution as head of state". 
  The speaker noted that "if we are to judge about parties by 
factions in the lower chamber, it will be clear that the 
situation when communists block democrats' decisions and vice 
versa, persists". This leads to the centre's consolidation, 
Shumeyko underlined. True, he said with regret, "the centre is 
being formed not in favour of reforms".

<F P=106> [Statement by the "Realists" Club on the presidential draft </F>
Agreement on the Attainment of Civil Accord, under the 
"Document" rubric] 
  [Text] We do stand for civil accord in society. But we 
oppose an illusion of accord or a myth about accord which is 
being specially created. In the draft Agreement on the 
Attainment of Civil Accord, which has been made public by the 
Russian Federation president, everything testifies either to the 
naivete of its authors or their desire to use the text only as a 
tactical weapon in the struggle against those who -- even to 
some extent -- do not support one administration and government 
policy or another. The document's period of validity, its 
demand for unilateral compromises, its declarative nature, the 
betting on embryonic party structures that have virtually no 
social support base in society, a lack of clear- cut obligations 
to be assumed by the executive branch, the restriction of 
constitutional rights for entire categories of people, the 
hastening of the preparation, discussion, and adoption of the 
document, and, finally, its mechanism of arbitration and 
sanctions for violating the agreement -- all this makes us warn: 
the document will not have any role to play at best, but at 
worst (which is most likely) it will, on the contrary, aggravate 
the standoff in society. The very idea of civil accord may be 
discredited. 
  Holding talks on the attainment of accord is, of course, 
better than not holding them at all. But the result is 
attainable when it can be attained in reality, not by an earlier 
set -- and apparently politically motivated -- date. This is 
why, while welcoming the president's readiness to strive for 
civil accord in society, but at the same time thinking it 
impossible for us to assume responsibility for the consequences 
of putting into practice the published draft Agreement under the 
established mechanism of finalizing and signing it, we propose 
different principles of the Public Agreement on the Attainment 
of Civil Accord: 
  1. The renunciation of the use of armed force in resolving 
any political and social conflicts. 
  2. The adherence to the current Constitution, while at the 
same time working out a mutually agreed mechanism of adjusting 
it. 
  3. The renunciation by all political institutions and 
structures of the claim on the introduction of any "state 
ideology" and the use of "the image of an internal enemy" in 
their campaigning. 
  4. All parties to the agreement, particularly chiefs of 
state structures, ought to conduct policies that are as moral as 
possible and that would not raise opponents' suspicions of 
insincerity. 
  5. The restoration of an independent, strong judicial 
branch as soon as possible. 
  6. The determination of clear dates and the mechanism of 
all elections for all elected government authorities. The 
parties to the agreement should forgo any changes in the dates 
or rules of elections. Democratic, free, and regular elections 
are the best mechanism of realizing the idea of civil accord. 
  7. Political forces that lay claims on power should 
publicly pledge to forswear revenge on the vanquished and yet 
another redistribution of property in favor of the winners in 
elections. 
  8. The joint determination of further stages of political 
reform. 
  9. The agreed determination of the minimum social 
standards and the quality of life standards of the population to 
be binding on any government. 
  10. The orientation of economic policy toward the domestic 
market as an engine of Russian economic development, and 
therefore a precondition for raising the living standards of 
Russian citizens. 
  11. A gradual, phased, and agreed upon introduction of a 
new model of Russia's federal structure and its policy in the 
post- Soviet space. 
  12. All parties to the agreement ought to pledge to take 
part in the comprehensive, full-scale struggle against organized 
crime, and also to expel those who may have even indirect 
contacts with any persons, organizations, or businesses dubious 
in that regard from the organizations signatories to the 
agreement. 
  The text of the Public Agreement should be signed by the 
leaders of public and political movements and organizations, 
political parties, trade and professional unions, associations 
of commodity producers, banks, and other corporate structures, 
and only afterward by top government officials. Those who have 
signed the agreement will become members of a roundtable which 
at the same time will be an arbitration agency responsible for 
exposing violations of the agreement by its individual members.

<F P=106> [Indira Dunayeva report: "Social Democrats Can Hardly </F>
Unite. They Urged Saving Reforms From Reformers"] 
  [Text] The F. Ebert Fund and the Social Democratic Party of 
Russia held on 16 and 17 April a conference with the theme 
"Prospects and Problems of the Development of Social Democracy 
in Russia." Not only did the conference not produce the 
impression of reaching some sort of agreement, but not even a 
discussion: Everyone spoke about his own thing with the result 
that they could not arrive at anything at all. Not that they 
were going to. Aleksandr Yakovlev urged everybody to unite for 
the sake of an imminent reforming and strengthening of democracy. 
  Gennadiy Burbulis urged "saving reforms from reformers, and 
democracy from democrats," and stated that tendencies toward 
disintegration in the country are at an end, and that there are 
every grounds for stabilization and the creation of a stable 
party system. Burbulis believed that one should now create a 
party-political system of centrism rather than a party. 
Burbulis accounted for the start of stabilization by the fact 
that the process of structuring society "has brought about 
several corporate systems that have divided power, resources, 
and spheres of influence and are now ready to achieve 
stability." Burbulis recommended that "one's own part be found 
in the formation of corporate systems since otherwise there are 
no chances to seriously influence society." Boris Kagarlitskiy 
(Party of Labor) stated "that boundaries should be drawn rather 
than a union formed:" "It is hard to speak about uniting even 
in this room where those who were shooting at each other in 
October are present." As he put it, "There will be no war, but 
there will be a devastating struggle for peace" if one attempts 
to try and unite social democratic forces too intensively. 
  The conference resulted neither in unification, nor war, nor 
a struggle for peace -- the active politicians and theorists 
simply pondered a topic of interest to them while most gave 
little heed to what the others said. 
  As for prospects of social democracy developing in Russia, 
in 
the end the conference did not elicit them.

  [Text] Chairman of the Federation Council Vladimir Shumeyko 
proposed advancing Boris Yeltsin's candidacy to the presidential 
elections in 1996. "Boris Yeltsin's stay in office for one more 
term would only benefit Russia," he told journalists in Moscow. 
Shumeyko believes that Yeltsin "has no right" to rely on any 
particular political forces, because none of them reflects the 
interests of broad sections of the population. 
  The political parties are mostly concentrated in the State 
Duma, he went on to say. "Their work shows that polarity in 
decision- making still persists: democrats are blocking the 
communists and vice versa," stated Shumeyko. He noted, that 
centrist tendencies were increasing. Among the centrist parties 
are the Party of Russian Unity and Concord, Women of Russia, the 
Communist and agrarian parties, and the New Regional Policy 
faction, said Shumeyko. However, the center favors conservative 
ideas rather than reforms, he went on to say. 
  He told Interfax that Russia should not hasten to join 
NATO's 
Partnership for Peace program. The main condition for doing so 
is joint work, equality and a clear-cut mechanism of 
implementing decisions, said Shumeyko. "The air strikes on the 
Serb positions by the US military command suggest that there is 
no such mechanism even in the UN Security Council," stated 
Shumeyko.

According to party chairman Viktor Zolotarev, the press 
conference is going to hear the PCD leadership announce a change 
in its methods of political activity. As of now the PCD will 
rely on populism and scandal. "We are going to fight fascism

<F P=106> [Viktor Sergeyev report: "President `X': Whom to Back? </F>
Results of a Sociological Poll"] 
  [Text] Despite the fact that it is almost two years until 
the next presidential election, a number of politicians have 
already started to prepare energetically for it. 
  Some are creating new parties, like Ye. Gaydar; others are 
developing the infrastructure of already existing parties and 
movements at regional level, like S. Shakhray and A. Rutskoy's 
team; still others, like Yu. Skokov, are strengthening 
influential all-Russian multisectoral associations, for example 
the Federation of Commodity Producers, or are actively gathering 
money, like Zhirinovskiy. 
  All this varied activity, aimed at creating positions to 
give 
them a spurt at the imminent presidential election, is filing 
past B. Yeltsin's vigilant eye, as he himself put it, or else 
the eye of the numerous Russian special services now subordinate 
personally to the president. However, they are scarcely capable 
of presenting an objective picture of the real influence of 
potential candidates for Russian president in various social 
groups today, since the leaders of the special services want to 
please their Kremlin master too much. 
  Some food for thought is provided by a poll, conducted in 
March by the "Vox Populi" service, of the eight most important 
groups in the Russian elite: the State Duma deputies, leaders 
of Russian ministries and departments, leaders of political 
parties, directors, captains of business, top officers in the 
Armed Forces, mass media editors, and also eminent figures in 
science and culture -- 50 people per group. 
  When they were asked: "Which of the famous politicians is 
now more capable than the others of leading Russia out of the 
crisis?" -- the following curious data was obtained. B. Yeltsin 
still occupies first place (21 percent), and second place is 
occupied by G. Yavlinskiy (13 percent). Over a period of seven 
months, starting with August of last year, when G. Yavlinskiy 
was the undoubted leader with 28 percent (B. Yeltsin only had 17 
percent), his rating has been falling inexorably. This is 
evidently connected with his lack -- as a politician, and now 
State Duma deputy -- of any specific results which the people 
could evaluate in a positive fashion. Society has grown tired 
of fruitless declarations, statements, and promises. 
  Third place, according to the Russian establishment, is 
occupied by Prime Minister V. Chernomyrdin (10 percent). At the 
same time, during the past three months, since the 
pseudo-reformers Ye. Gaydar and B. Fedorov left the government, 
assessments of its activity have been fairly stable. 
  Yu. Skokov and Ye. Gaydar, who share fourth place, (9 
percent 
each) are breathing down the premier's neck. However, the 
trends in the change of influence of these famous politicians on 
the people who shape Russian public opinion are diametrically 
opposed. 
  Since November of last year, when Ye. Gaydar (20 percent) 
was 
even ahead of B. Yeltsin (19 percent), his rating has been 
falling constantly, and indeed particularly sharply since his 
resignation from the post of first vice premier. Evidently this 
rapid fall in Ye. Gaydar's personal popularity will not increase 
the chances of success of the party he created under the trite 
name of "Russia's Choice," which, in the eyes of the majority of 
the electorate, is clearly associated with the defeat of the 
democrats at the December elections. 
  Yu. Skokov, chairman of the Russian Federation of Commodity 
Producers, who does not occupy any official state posts and does 
not make showy statements, has conversely been steadily gaining 
points during the six months. This can primarily be attributed 
to his increasing practical work with leaders of enterprises, 
labor collectives, trade unions, and entrepreneurs, aimed at 
alleviating the consequences of the rampant fall in production 
and restraining the growth in unemployment. 
  Among the top echelons of our society, V. Zhirinovskiy (3 
percent) and S. Shakhray (2 percent) received low assessments as 
figures able to lead the country out of the crisis. As can be 
seen, Vladimir Volfovich's great popularity among the people 
does not affect the cold reaction toward him in the top echelon 
of our society. 
  It is interesting that S. Shakhray, who literally never 
comes 
off the television screens and the pages of newspapers and 
periodicals, is experiencing a disastrous fall in influence in 
the eyes of the people who shape our public opinion and who know 
the people's real worth. In August 1993, he received 13 
percent, in October only 4 percent, and in December only 3 
percent. 
  Of course, any public opinion polls are of an approximate 
and 
subjective nature. People in the top strata of society are more 
aware of the genuine professional qualities of people with whom 
they often come into contact. But at the same time, those of 
them who have a vested interest in the personal [favorable] 
disposition toward themselves of specific statesmen and public 
figures and above all the president and the prime minister, who 
ensure their interests, can scarcely be objective. 
  The majority of the population is on the one hand strongly 
subjected to the influence of targeted propaganda by the mass 
media, and is inclined to believe in illusions connected with 
simple solutions to complex problems which demagogues promise. 
But on the other hand, ordinary people, who have felt at 
first-hand the consequences of Ye. Gaydar's reforms (it is 
enough just to mention the mass plundering of savings in the 
savings banks), as well as of the state activity of politicians 
such as S. Shakhray, are beginning to draw their own impartial 
conclusions. 
  Of course the picture of public opinion obtained is clearly 
not a complete one. People who have been put forward by the 
left-wing (and possibly left-centrist) forces are not 
represented in it at all. Meanwhile their influence in society 
is very noticeable and it may grow in the future.

  [Text] The Moscow branch of the All-Russian Center for the

1,620 residents of the capital. The sociologists asked them to

  The listed political figures enjoy a relatively greater 
measure of trust than they do on the whole among Muscovites who 
have been polled: 
  B. Yeltsin -- among pensioners, executives, and those in the 
management sphere, servicemen and workers of law and order 
services, technical specialists, and on the whole among persons 
of 40 to 55 with a higher education who voted for Russia's 
Choice and the Party of Russian Unity and Accord [PRES] in the 
12 December elections; 
  G. Yavlinskiy -- among executives and those in the 
management 
sphere, technical specialists, and generally among those of 40 
to 55 with a higher education who voted for Yabloko and the 
Democratic Reforms Movement; 
  Ye. Gaydar -- among technical specialists, the military, and 
workers of the law and order services, executives and those in 
the management sphere, entrepreneurs running their own 
businesses, and generally people above 40 with a higher 
education and who voted for Russia's Choice and PRES; 
  V. Zhirinovskiy -- among white collar workers without 
special 
education, workers and men in general, persons above 40 with an 
education below the secondary level and who voted for his party; 
  A. Rutskoy -- among white collar workers without special 
education, unskilled workers, specialists in the field of 
science, education and medicine, pensioners, and generally among 
those of 40 to 55 with an education below secondary level and 
who voted for the parties of communists, agrarians, 
Zhirinovskiy, and against everybody; 
  Yu. Luzhkov -- among executives and those in the sphere of 
management, specialists in the field of science, education, and 
medicine, and generally among women, persons above 55 who voted 
for Russia's Choice; 
  S. Shakhray -- among housewives, entrepreneurs who run their 
own businesses, technical specialists, military and workers of 
the law and order services, and generally among women, people of 
25 to 40 with a higher education and who voted for the PRES and 
Russia's Choice; 
  E. Pamfilova -- among technical specialists, pensioners, 
while collar workers without special education, and women 
generally, persons above 55 with higher education who voted more 
frequently for Russian's Choice and Yabloko; 
  V. Chernomyrdin -- among executives and those in the 
management sphere, technical specialists, women generally, 
persons above 40 with secondary education who voted for PRES and 
Yabloko; 
  G. Zyuganov -- among pensioners, military, and workers of 
the 
law and order services, and generally men, persons above 55 with 
an education below the secondary level who voted for the 
Communist Party, the Women of Russia, and Travkin's Democratic 
Party. 
  Among other Russian political figures who are trusted by 
Muscovites who took part in the poll are N. Travkin, S. Fedorov, 
and A. Sobchak with 3 percent each; V. Shumeyko, I. Rybkin, K. 
Borovoy with 2 percent each; S. Baburin, M. Gorbachev, T. Gdlyan 
with 1 percent each; G. Popov, A. Volskiy, R. Khasbulatov with 
under 1 percent. 
  Remarkably, an increasing number of respondents, in each new 
stage of the poll on trust in political figures, either name no 
leader they would trust or are generally stumped for an answer. 
To compare: while there were 36 percent of such persons in 
December, there were 52 percent in April. A considerable part 
of Muscovites must feel unprotected today against realities of 
life which appreciably affects their view of favorite leaders 
and idols.

<F P=106> [Unattributed INTERFAX report in the "In Brief" column] </F>
  [Text] Moscow -- The political and economic situation in 
Russia noticeably inhibits Russians' orientation toward the 
values of democracy and freedom of expression in society. Thus, 
in the past five years (from December 1988 to December 1993) the 
proportion of Russian citizens considering glasnost and freedom 
of expression important for themselves has declined from 51 to 
12 percent. This finding has been reported by the Institute for 
the Sociology of Parliamentarianism directed by Nugzar Betaneli. 
The poll conducted in March and April 1994 showed that even in 
Moscow, where democratic trends prevail, the level of 
socio-psychological intolerance has grown: The number of those 
who think that not everything in Russia (people, parties, 
movements, and mass media) should enjoy equal freedom of 
expression has grown from 28 percent (May 1993) to 43 percent 
(March 1994), while another 2 percent believe that everyone's 
freedom of expression must be limited.

<F P=106> [Article by Sergey Chugayev: "Pragmatist Communists </F>
Drifting Toward Social Democracy"] 
  [Text] The energy and activeness demonstrated by the 
Russian president throughout the past week -- the visit to 
Spain, the talks with the CIS heads of state in Moscow -- showed 
that B. Yeltsin is in splendid physical shape and has a firm 
grip on the helm of state. All these factors naturally affect 
the domestic political situation in Russia. 
  It is rather hard to recall another occasion when the 
Russian 
parliament has worked as calmly and constructively as during the 
past week. Yet the week was packed with events every one of 
which, judging by past experience, could have turned the supreme 
legislative body into a furious political debating society. 
However, as we have seen, the Duma adopted a very 
well-considered decree in connection with the bombing of Serbian 
targets in Bosnia by NATO aircraft, quite reasonably left it to 
the president to resolve the problem of the recent Black Sea 
Fleet incidents (which did much to promote the attainment of 
encouraging accords), and, last, for the first time in the 
three-year history of Russia's existence as an autonomous state, 
began intelligently, in close contact with the government, to 
discuss the draft state budget. 
  There was an impression that even the "intransigent 
opposition" was affected by the general mood and moderated its 
ardor to a significant degree -- the NSF [National Salvation 
Front] leaders declared that they will refrain from holding May 
Day demonstrations, while "Working Russia" leader V. Anpilov 
promised to do everything to ensure that the May Day march by 
his supporters is exclusively peaceful, announcing that to this 
end he is even prepared to enter into contact with the 
authorities. 
  A familiar phenomenon was demonstrated yet again in the past 
week: As soon as the president becomes active and energetic, 
the country enters a period of relative political stability and 
political groupings converge from the extreme flanks toward the 
center. And, every time, this notional center becomes more 
attractive to an increasingly wide range of politicians. 
  On the one hand, Ye. Gaydar declares the need to create a 
socially oriented market economy, and on the other, I. Rybkin, 
former leader of the "Communists of Russia" faction and chairman 
of the State Duma, talks frankly of his social democratic 
sympathies in a TV interview. The program documents of the CPRF 
[Communist Party of the Russian Federation] and the Agrarian 
Party recognize private ownership and market relations. The 
conclusion that springs to mind is that we are today observing 
the formation of a broad social democratic movement in Russia, 
of which the former communist nomenklatura could form the basis. 
  One of the main factors that sharply accelerated the 
pragmatist communists' progress toward social democracy was 
October 1993. After this, the classical Leninist plan to seize 
power had suffered a crushing defeat and a line was thereby 
finally drawn under a stage of the political struggle in which 
the objective was to seize absolute power, or rather to restore 
that power to the former nomenklatura. 
  During the period of reforms a large part of the 
nomenklatura 
has adapted quite well to the new economic conditions, not only 
becoming reconciled to the market, but becoming part of it, 
since its primary aim had always been the pursuit of its own 
personal goals. The nomenklatura associated with state 
ownership gained particularly by the transition to the market. 
  As a result the communist nomenklatura has become a part of 
the Russian establishment, and recent trips by I. Rybkin to the 
United States and by G. Zyuganov to France and the United States 
showed that it has quite high hopes of becoming part of the 
international establishment too. All that remained, basically, 
was to change the labels a little. 
  Today's criticism of the actions of the president and 
government by the CPRF and the Agrarian Party, as can be seen 
from the Duma debates, is not directed toward institutional 
postulates of any kind, but deals only with the means and 
methods of overcoming the economic crisis. Which proves that 
the parliamentary communists are abandoning revolutionary 
methods of struggle not just in words, but in deed. 
  The active participation of today's "legal Marxists" in the 
December elections and their official dissociation from 
nonparliamentary forms of the struggle mark, basically, the 
renunciation of Leninism and the beginning of the transformation 
of the communist party into a party of the parliamentary, social 
democratic type. The choice is rather brutal -- either go 
underground, or become a respectable party. 
  Another important factor in the transformation of the 
communists that can now be observed is their relative victory in 
the December elections and the relative defeat of the supporters 
of liberalism. It turns out that power can easily be obtained by 
legal, civilized means. 
  In general the changes taking place on the Russian political 
scene indicate that the country is embarking increasingly surely 
on the path of market transformations. Taking the objective 
view, social democracy for Russia is a great step forward -- 
toward the market, and that means toward liberalism. 
  At the same time it would obviously be a mistake to be 
deluded by the fact that today it seems that virtually the 
entire nomenklatura and a vast number of political parties and 
movements are raising the banners of social democracy. The 
nomenklatura, as has been said before, is pragmatic and hence 
apolitical, and will raise whatever banners it needs, depending 
on contingencies. The anticipated start of a period of 
bankruptcies and increasing unemployment creates the 
preconditions for another surge of politicians away from the 
center and toward the extreme flanks. Thus it would be premature 
to assume that with the strengthening of social democratic 
trends in Russian domestic policy a period of stability has set 
in. An apparently more accurate thesis is that the current 
political season in Russia is an interim stage in the progress 
from the ideology of liberalism to social democracy. 
  The socioeconomic base of social democracy is only just 
being 
formed. It must be founded first and foremost on those sectors 
of the economy that can realistically exist in market 
conditions. Primarily joint-stock and privatized enterprises. 
The regional nomenklatura also fits in here, having already 
succeeded in converting power into ownership. The bulwark of 
social democracy is the property owners. How durable and broad 
it is able to become, depends on the speed of Russia's emergence 
from the economic crisis.

  [Text] Say what you like about our democrats, but they 
certainly keep us entertained. One minute they are feeding 
society "version No. 1," trying to accuse the opposition of 
attempting to destabilize the situation, and when this falls 
through they come over all innocent and say: But we were only 
making public a document about "an incipient palace coup." We 
have been misunderstood. The next minute they are circulating a 
"directive from Yeltsin" on locating Russian military bases on 
the territory of former Soviet republics, including Latvia, 
thereby wrecking the Russian-Latvian talks, and all this is 
subsequently explained away as a "technical error" -- it appears 
that some clerk or typist is to blame for the whole thing. And 
now it seems our ears are deceiving us again: "Let's buy 
Siberia! For a paltry $3 trillion we can save Russia, add seven 
stars to our flag, and give an entire generation the prospect of 
unprecedented prosperity" -- ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA reported this 
initiative put forward by the U.S. political scientist U. Mid 
[name as transliterated] just the other day. 
  This initiative first surfaced a year ago and was viewed by 
the public here as gibberish not worthy of serious discussion. 
But the author of the article "Siberia for $3 Trillion" had 
absolutely no qualms about writing the following: "It would be 
interesting to find out what Siberians and Far Easterners, for 
whom the land beyond the Yenisey is their native region, think 
about this proposal." Citing the U.S. press, he adduces a whole 
series of "pieces of evidence" in support of this idea. The 
sale of Siberia "would be the best way to resolve Russia's 
problems," since Russia could use the money from the deal "to 
start the transition to the First World instead of the slide 
into the Third." The article continues in the same vein: "All 
Siberia's inhabitants would be U.S. citizens enjoying all the 
rights and privileges of Americans"; "Russia would be able to 
pay off all its foreign debts and modernize its infrastructure." 
And so on. 
  U. Mid published his scenario in order to "provoke serious 
discussion of how to extricate Russia from its blind alley." He 
believes that "economically speaking, this sort of solution is 
possible." He says that he came across Americans everywhere in 
Russia, and it was the same story in Hawaii: "Missionaries 
first of all, then traders, and finally the Navy." 
  We could safely ignore all this gibberish if it were not 
published in ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA, which in the very same issue 
reported that it is "the official newspaper of the state." What 
is this -- another "technical" (in this case editorial) error, 
or a cautious sounding-out of Russian public opinion?

  [Text] Publication of the newspaper TRETYE SOSLOVIYE 
[third estate], founded by Aleksey Adzhubey [Khrushchev's 
son-in-law] shortly before his untimely death, has been resumed 
with the appearance of issue No. 12. The newspaper, as is clear 
from its name, is aimed at representatives of the nascent estate 
of Russian entrepreneurs and attempts to fulfill the active

  After issue No. 11 the founders and the editorial board got 
into financial difficulties (the newspaper does not receive 
state subsidies). The "debts" to subscribers are now being

  In the present issue the reader will be attracted, above 
all, 
to a double-page spread of previously unpublished photographs of 
N.S. Khrushchev from R.N. Adzhubey's personal archive with her 
own comments and reminiscences (pegged to Khrushchev's 
centenary), as well as a number of articles by well known 
political experts and economists devoted to the most painful 
problems of Russian society.

<F P=106> [Igor Andreyev article: "The Surprising Thing Is Not That </F>
Aircraft Are Falling Out of the Sky, but That They Are Not Doing 
So Every Day"] 
  [Text] The seemingly inconceivable twist in the story of 
the mysterious Mezhdurechensk disaster (aviation history will 
hardly have known a case where a brand new intercontinental 
airliner with 75 people aboard was crashed by an adolescent) has 
shaken passengers so much that it has diverted our attention 
from a far more major threat. That threat is the almost 
complete destruction of the flight security system which, 
maintained by an iron and sometimes ruthless hand, Soviet civil 
aviation once enjoyed. The collapse of its previous structures, 
the almost total lack of control by the state over the hundreds 
of new air companies, and the principle of "profit at any price" 
have all led, specialists are profoundly convinced, to the 
horrific upsurge in the number of major air disasters. 
<H5>  The `Eye of the State' Cannot See Properly; Hence It Is </H5>
Powerless 
  Something incredible happened recently in Siberia -- the 
general director of one of the largest air companies, an 
independent joint-stock company, refused to allow a government 
inspector aboard one of his aircraft to check the pilots' flying 
skills in accordance with regulations sanctioned by decades of 
procedure. This was a totally routine, everyday operation, but 
one that was absolutely essential to flight safety. In imposing 
the ban, the general director put forward just one argument, an 
economic one: Who would answer to the shareholders, that is to 
say the owners of the aircraft, for their property worth many 
billions if something were to happen to the aircraft during the 
inspection flight. Pigheadedness? Willfulness? To a certain 
extent, yes. But there is also a loophole in the current 
legislation governing civil aviation operations. Basically, at 
the present time there is no normative act which compels a 
company director to go back on his decision. This particular 
case is exceptional, and inspectors are nevertheless being 
allowed on board, but it demonstrates both graphically and 
absurdly that civil aviation and civil aviation safety are in 
dire need of new legislation at a time when a change in the form 
of ownership has actually occurred. 
  The long chain of events leading to a situation in which, 
say, a crew allows an unauthorized person behind the controls or 
ignores a red -- i.e. warning -- indicator on the instrument 
panel starts a long way away from a specific aircraft or the 
people who actually violate the regulations. In Moscow, to be 
precise, where the highest state civil aviation administration 
organs are and always have been based. Until recently this was 
the all-powerful Ministry of Civil Aviation, a bureaucratic 
monster that controlled absolutely everything. Nowadays it is 
the Air Transportation Department of the Russian Ministry of 
Transport, whose task is to keep an eye on air companies rather 
than actually manage them. In other words, with regard to the 
topic under discussion its task is to deprive air carriers of 
operating licenses on behalf of the state if they do not meet 
flight safety standards set by the state. 
  The chaos in the Russian aviation industry begins with the 
statutory legal basis of this function which is performed by the 
state -- or the lack of it in our country. Regardless of 
whether the former USSR Ministry of Civil Aviation was good or 
bad, the statute on the ministry was ratified by the country's 
Council of Ministers, i.e. the government on behalf of the state. 
  Document number two, the statute on the Air Transportation 
Department, has been ratified by the Russian Ministry of 
Transport -- just notice the difference! Its principal tasks 
include organizing and implementing state supervision of safety 
provisions.... Everything would seem to be in place, but take a 
closer look at this essentially unsubstantiated declaration. 
The paragraph beginning "the department is entitled" notes, for 
example, that the department has the right to monitor compliance 
with transportation legislation. A little later on it states 
that the department is entitled to suspend the operation of 
aircraft, airfields, and airports... when it discovers 
shortcomings that threaten their safety. 
  But what does "is entitled to" actually mean? "Obligated to" 
would be clear: A danger has been discovered, do not try to 
avoid taking appropriate measures! But what does "is entitled 
to" mean: The right to put violators in order or the right to do 
nothing? 
  Transportation legislation. It used to exist in the USSR in 
the form of the country's air code. Russia, however, is still 
without a fundamental aviation act of this kind. Which means 
that it lacks transportation legislation for regulating the 
activity of this extremely complex sector. The need for it is 
not a piece of chicanery divorced from real life. The story of 
the general director and the pilot inspector is graphic evidence 
of this fact. 
<H5>  The Price of Safety... in Dollars, Rubles, and Lives </H5>
  Last winter a Russian An-12 aircraft belonging to the 
domestic company "Avial" landed at Moscow's Sheremetyevo-1 
airport. It was flying the Baku-Moscow-Rostov route while 
temporarily under the flag of the United Arab Emirates. The 
company was asked to pay just over $8,000 in all, which 
astonished the company's economists: To land the same aircraft 
at the same airport but under the Russian flag would recently 
have cost the company...53 million rubles [R]. Nowadays 
probably everyone understands the difference between these sums. 
If it is not clear to absolutely everyone, let me explain: At 
another airport -- Vnukovo -- a Russian company must pay R1 
million to park an An-12 for 10 hours, whereas a 24-hour 
stopover at the same airport would cost a foreign company flying 
an equivalent aircraft just $77. 
  Having listened to a number of pilots, I am fairly skeptical 
when I hear their tales about the dire economic straits in which 
companies find themselves. Nevertheless it is a fact that any 
institution which is essential to an aircraft's getting airborne 
is fleecing the companies for all they are worth. Airports for 
takeoff and landing rights, servicing, and refueling. And Air 
Traffic Control Service for "airspace".... It is striking that 
"Rosaeronavigatsiya," which is formally part of the Ministry of 
Transport system and is therefore a state organization, has 
raised the air navigation levy to an unbelievable sum. 
Requisitions for "airspace" now amount to somewhere in the 
region of one-half the cost of an hour's flying time! 
  If so much money is needed every time an aircraft gets 
airborne, how are air companies supposed to comply with safety 
regulations? With what are they supposed to buy the new 
technology that is "piling up" at aircraft plants? Are spare 
parts and kerosene to be used for trial flights of recently 
repaired aircraft or for checking pilots' flying habits? 
  According to traditional procedure in this country, the 
on-board flight recorders of long-haul airliners must be decoded 
after practically every flight with a view to checking the 
actions of the crew and the operation of the systems. By no 
means every company has the necessary apparatus, especially the 
smaller ones. Which means you have to pay considerable sums to 
the people who do. And if you want your crews to train in 
flight simulators, you have to pay the few people in this 
country who own this apparatus. And if flight simulators are 
thought of as an expensive piece of equipment even in the West, 
what hope do we poor sinners have! 
  Having stopped financing companies altogether, the state 
seems to have forgotten that it is the guarantor of safety. 
Moreover, Doctor of Technical Sciences Boris Likhachev, general 
director of the ALAK air company, tells me that the state levies 
taxes even on the proportion of the profit spent purely on 
measures to combat accidents. Professionals, Likhachev says, 
are nevertheless still spending money to have the necessary work 
done by the correct personnel and equipment. But what about 
aviation illiterates, for example, how many of them are 
currently directors of independent firms? 
  When the Tu-154 Irkutsk disaster happened, the general 
director recalls, I rang the department and tried to find out 
what the problem was and what we would need to do with aircraft 
of this type. It was with some difficulty that I found out that 
the engine starter turbine which caused the loss of this 
airliner had already been playing up, and that there had even 
been fires, admittedly while the aircraft was still on the 
ground. But nobody at local level knew about this danger, and 
so the pilots interpreted the red alarm signaling dangerously 
high starter turbine revolutions as a false alarm. The former 
system of notifying enterprises about possible preconditions for 
accidents has broken down, and a new system has not replaced it. 
  Yuriy Tarshin, the country's top airman and chief of the Air 
Transportation Department's Flight Operation Desk, is not sorry 
to see the old system go since he considers it excessively 
centralized and impersonal. The current flight safety situation 
has been described as critical, and the recent accidents as 
normal in the circumstances. 
  However bad or dangerous our domestic aviation technology 
is, 
Tarshin says, by no means all these incidents happen as a result 
of mistakes committed by the crews. And even the Irkutsk 
incident might not have happened if the pilots had known that 
the red warning signal sometimes operates to indicate real 
emergencies. Information about eight similar incidents reached 
the Flight Operation Desk only after the disaster had occurred, 
and the actions taken by the crews in each of these cases were 
not taken into account. 
  The former Main Administration of the Flight Service of the 
USSR Ministry of Civil Aviation has now turned into a 
department, and this department employs just 8 people to inspect 
flight crews. Whereas before there was a leading pilot inspector 
for each one of the 40 types of aircraft in our civil aviation, 
these "super professionals" have now become extinct. The same 
problems have arisen in the regional administrations where 
inspectors are subordinated to the Ministry of Transport and 
where there are no aviation specialists. Ministry bigwigs can 
only learn about what is going on in the air by examining the 
coffins of the victims, according to Tarshin. The department, 
however, lacks bite and is impotent. 
  None of the department's inspectors has had any experience 
of 
an A-310, five of which were leased by Russian International 
Airlines. The paradox is that these airliners and their crews, 
which are flying under the national flag, are completely outside 
the control of the Russian department which supervises safety 
procedures. The pilots of the airliner which crashed, Tarshin 
says, were exceptionally well trained, but the presence of 
children in the cockpit is unfortunately an unalterable fact. 
<H5>  Does the Mafia Give the "OK" for Takeoff? </H5>
  Alfred Malinovskiy, president of the Russian Federation 
airline personnel trade union, told me this story. One evening 
the commander of an airliner which was due to fly out of Pulkovo 
[St. Petersburg] the following day was called at home. Without 
introduction, the voice on the other end of the line said: A 
car will drive up to your aircraft; accept the cargo that it 
delivers. The commander indignantly replied that he would do 
nothing of the sort. Whereupon he heard the following threat: 
Have you thought about your daughter? After all, she goes to 
such-and-such a school and walks there along such-and-such a 
street. We also know that your pilot's license needs extending 
in six months' time. You do want it extended, don't you? 
  The next morning, as if security procedures at the airport 
were nonexistent, a car drove up to the aircraft, and moreover 
not just one car but two. They apparently belonged to different 
"departments." The two groups started to arguing with one 
another and got out their pistols. They reached an 
understanding nevertheless and ordered the commander to accept a 
cargo from both cars. The pilot made a specious excuse and 
reported sick. But the aircraft left all the same -- with a 
reserve crew. 
  Every day, Malinovskiy says, crews are forced to cover for 
the moonlighting activities and unfinished work of other 
personnel by flying off with the problems and responsibilities 
of those remaining on the ground. Salary size is in direct 
proportion to the number of hours and kilometers flown. If a 
pilot decides not to take off because an aircraft is not ready, 
for example, he punishes himself financially, and if he sticks 
to his principles more than once, you have to feel even sorrier 
for him because the person in charge of the subdivision will 
give him the chance to "take a break" on the ground. The same 
services to which air personnel address their complaints about 
equipment and preparation at the airfield, the way aircraft are 
loaded, radio navigation backup, and air traffic control will do 
everything in their power to make the captious crew's life 
unbearable. 
  The number of breakdowns in our aircraft equipment on a 
normal flight, Malinovskiy says, cannot be compared to Western 
standards. The systems which give warning of dangers and 
breakdowns are dogged by false alarms, and the crews get 
accustomed to this state of affairs. Owing to a shortage of 
money, routine servicing technology is becoming oversimplified, 
personnel are simply resorting to reporting faults rather than 
eliminating the problem, and components and units which are 
faulty are being replaced with others which are nown to be 
substandard. 
  Airport boundaries have become so insecure that trucks 
belonging to criminal commercial organizations can drive right 
up to aircraft; the armed escorts, who are often in cahoots with 
workers at the airport and cargo warehouses, force the crews to 
take on board tonnes of unauthorized cargo. This could be 
anything, even munitions and weapons. In order to take off, 
pilots must squeeze through the net of extortioners and pay for 
service, fuel, deicing work, towing, takeoff and landing, and 
parking. And most of all they will do everything they can, even 
at the expense of safety, to land on the minimum quantity of 
fuel (which is expensive!) at their scheduled destination rather 
than a fallback airfield. At fallback airfields pilots are 
fleeced mercilessly or their aircraft are laid up forever. 
According to Malinovskiy, pilots are afraid of everything 
except incidents and disasters.... 
  This is frightening.... It is also shameful because we hear 
of no radical measures being taken to restore order in our civil 
aviation, despite 200 deaths in disasters during the past three 
months. And it also seems the authorities will only start 
sorting out our domestic air transportation under pressure from 
abroad. The anti-Aeroflot campaign is gathering strength all 
over the place, and at the same time a campaign is being 
launched against its large and small successors alike who are 
all keen to fly outside our national borders. Is the reborn 
Russian state really only capable of learning about what is 
going on in the air by examining the coffins of the victims when 
there is an outcry from Montreal, the headquarters of the 
International Civil Aviation Organization?

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina] </F>
  [Text] Moscow April 19 TASS -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin has addressed a letter to Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin stressing the need to resolve the problem of 
default payments and to enact bankruptcy procedures for 
loss-making enterprises, ITAR-TASS was told today by Aleksandr 
Livshits, head of a team of experts under the presidency. 
  Speaking about the need for bankruptcy procedures, Livshits 
stressed that if this measure was not adopted "the inflation is 
apt to reach 40-50 per cent at the first stage, by May 1944, and 
the next spiral of default payments will lead to the 
Ukrainisation of the Russian economy". 
  The expert believes that it is just as difficult to legalise 
bankruptcies as it was to liberalise prices in January 1992. 
But if that was the first step towards the Russian economy's 
switchover to market rails, today it is most necessary to make 
the second step. 
  Explaining the bankruptcy mechanism, Livshits, who is doctor 
of economic sciences, noted that a loss-making enterprise should 
be immediately privatised, turned into an open-type joint-stock 
society, and temporarily managed by a commission, made up of 
creditors and representatives of the State Property Committee. 
The commission will check the accounts of the bankrupt 
enterprise, will analyse its system of management, and will 
decide on the commodities it is to manufacture. Only then the 
enterprise will get the money it needs to restore its 
efficiency. "Moreover," Livshits stressed, "it will not be 
necessary to lay off the workers of an enterprise which 
voluntarily declares itself bankrupt or to lock up its gates. 
  The president's 4-page message to the prime minister 
envisages some long-term measures (circulation of bills and 
reform of banks), as well as some short-term steps. Thereby, 
Yeltsin assumes full responsibility for the second step of the 
reform, including the riddance of the Russian economy of 
inefficient enterprises.

  [Text] St. Petersburg -- Approximately 5,000 bankers, 
businessmen, jurists, and finance ministers from 57 countries 
have traveled to St. Petersburg for the third annual session of 
the Board of Directors of the European Bank for Reconstruction 
and Development [EBRD], which is being held in St. Petersburg's 
Taurida Palace. The Russian side is represented at the 
international banking congress by Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin, Vice Premiers Anatoliy Chubays and Aleksandr 
Shokhin, and Russian Federation Central Bank Chairman Viktor 
Gerashchenko. EBRD President Jacques de Larosiere declared that 
the European Bank intends to fundamentally modify the ideology 
of cooperation with Russia and the CIS countries, going over to 
direct ties with regions, commercial structures, and 
enterprises. There will be presentations of 50 Russian 
investment projects within the framework of the International 
Banking Forum. An agreement on the use of the Proton carrier 
rocket to put European space satellites into orbit is expected 
to be concluded with the Russian premier's participation. 
Representatives of the "Mayak" Design Bureau and the European 
Bank intend to sign the relevant documents. At the initial 
stage the project is valued at U.S.$10 million. In the opinion 
of experts, this contract could signify the reorientation of 
European space structures toward the Russian market. 
  Precisely 24 investment programs submitted by St. Petersburg 
were submitted for the European bankers' verdict. They include 
a project for the construction of a ring road which will solve 
the problems of transit communication between north European and 
Baltic countries and the northwest region of Russia, the 
construction of a high-speed main railroad between Moscow and 
St. Petersburg, and the reconstruction of the historic city on 
the Neva.

  [Text] Russia's Choice leader Yegor Gaydar has warned 
against offsetting inter-enterprise debt. Talking to journalists 
in Samara he said that any attempt to weaken the monetary policy 
will as a rule have result in the opposite of what was 
envisaged. Ukraine had often offset such debt and the result 
was one of the most critical financial situations in the CIS. 
In the Baltic states such steps had never been taken and there 
the debt problem was much less acute, said Gaydar. 
  He said that defaulting was an indicator of financial 
responsibility. "If there was a high level of responsibility, 
defaulting is high. One can refrain from paying and put one's 
money in a bank or commercial structure and receive a profit." 
He said this was impossible in countries with strict bankrupt 
legislation and a high level of real responsibility. Gaydar 
also considers the government to be to blame. "This concerns the 
defaulting of the government itself and its non-fulfillment of 
obligations -- a line actively pursued by the Chernomyrdin 
cabinet since the beginning of 1993," said Gaydar. 
  He said that serious changes in the present tax system can 
only be based, in the first place, on real cut-backs in 
government expenditure and, in the second, on the gradual 
lowering of profit tax and the gradual raising of tax on natural 
resources, land and property. 
  On the decision to unify the Russian and Belarusian monetary 
systems, Gaydar said that a series of principal conditions had 
been accepted in Belarus (in contrast to the initial draft) and 
that Belarus would win a considerable amount from the agreement, 
e.g. equal prices for energy and access to the stable Russian 
currency. Russia is widening its market. In addition, it will 
not have to pay any lease for military units stationed in 
Belarus. However, Gaydar said that one point did give him cause 
for concern: Private individuals will be able to exchange 
Belarusian rubles for Russian rubles at a rate of one to one for 
the first two hundred thousand in cash and for the first million 
in bank accounts. As there is about 60 million dollars in cash 
circulation in Belarus, this would result in the circulation 
increasing to 1.5 billion dollars. Thus, Gaydar said, Russia 
would be making Belarus a gift of two trillion rubles. This does 
not take into account bank savings. The main thing, according 
to Gaydar, is that the possibilities for financial speculation 
will increase massively at a cost of many trillions of rubles 
for the Russian economy.

  [Text] Yegor Gaydar, leader of the parliamentary group 
Russia's Choice, believes the country's budget expenditure on 
defense should be cut. In an interview for DELOVOY MIR, he 
noted that 37 trillion rubles have been earmarked in the draft 
budget for military spending; in other words a fifth of the 
budget. Yegor Gaydar believes it necessary for the Russian Army 
to be tailored to the new conditions and new possibilities that 
exist in the country.

  [Text] The chairman of the Central Bank of Russia (CBR), 
Viktor Gerashchenko, has called on the European Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) to boost credits to purely 
Russian enterprises rather than joint ventures with 
participation of Western companies. Speaking at the closing 
ceremony of an annual meeting of the EBRD board in St. 
Petersburg Tuesday, Gerashchenko pointed out that quite a number 
of reliable companies capable of maintaining civilized relations 
with the bank had appeared in Russia. He highly praised the 
EBRD's efforts in assisting Russia's small businesses and 
supposed that its dialog with Russian business would be even 
more productive, if carried out through the CBR. 
  Commenting on the EBRD's activities last year, Gerashchenko 
noted that the amount of credits actually used for Russian 
projects had increased by more than 10 times and reached $120 
Mn. In his opinion, the EBRD board of directors might function 
as the coordinator of various states' efforts for the support of 
Russian reforms. 
  EBRD President Jacques de Larosiere pointed out that this 
body would use a more flexible approach to its relations with 
East and Central European countries and pay more attention to 
their small and medium-sized businesses.

  [Text] As of 1 May this year the Russian Government is 
establishing an excise rate for extracting enterprises of, on 
average, 14,750 rubles per tonne of oil, including gas 
condensate. This amount will change monthly, depending on the 
change in the rate of the ruble against the U.S. dollar. There 
will be different rates for individual oil and gas extracting 
enterprises.

<F P=106> [Petr Shcherbakov report: "We Will Make It To the Next </F>
Harvest.... -- Notes From the Food Commission Session"] 
  [Text] What is the situation regarding reserves of grain 
in the country? How much will bread cost this fall, or by the 
end of the year? What is the volume of grain purchases which 
can be realistically expected in 1994? These tricky questions 
were discussed last Thursday by members of the Russian 
Federation Government Food Commission under the chairmanship of 
Agriculture and Food Minister V. Khlystun. 
  In respect of current reserves of bread grain, these, 
according to "Roskhleboprodukt" Corporation President L. 
Cheshinskiy, are sufficient to last until the next harvest. 
There are particularly plentiful reserves of rye, which will 
meet the requirements of the Russian population right up until 
1996. 
  But it is grain purchases from the 1994 harvest which are 
prompting alarm. And this alarm is wholly justified. After 
all, last fall, for a number of reasons, a sizable area 
earmarked for winter crops was left unsown. The wintering of 
cereal crops took place in difficult conditions. As a result, 
owing to frosts and rot over large areas, farmers were forced to 
undersow or even resow winter grain with spring grain. All 
this, of course, will affect the harvest. 
  In the light of this, forecasts by food commission members 
regarding appreciable price increases for bread were completely 
justified. 
  "It is clear even today," V. Khlystun said, "that, by fall, 
because of inflation and for other reasons, purchase prices for 
grain will rise to 200,000 rubles [R] a tonne." 
  It will be remembered that the average purchase price in 
1993 
was R57,000 per tonne. But then the situation was different to 
the one taking shape now. The custom of state grain 
procurements was still genetically strong. However, political 
infighting, in which bread prices constituted a bargaining chip, 
led to a situation where debts for products submitted were not 
paid to agricultural commodity producers for many months. As a 
result, virtually all farms -- large farms and private 
smallholdings -- ended up on the brink of economic collapse, 
irretrievably disenchanted with the word of the state as a 
guarantee of any kind of commitment. 
  The volume of grain purchases destined for the Federal Fund 
is currently defined at a level of roughly 11 million tonnes, or 
1 million tonnes less than it was planned to purchase in 1993. 
Then, you may recall, the plan was exceeded. The drop in 
planned volumes for this year is attributed to the fact that the 
government has restricted the circle of users of the "state corn 
bins," suggesting to many that they themselves take care of 
grain and other food reserves. The market, after all, is the 
market. 
  Whether these 11 million tonnes will be poured into state 
silos is, so to speak, another matter. 
  These fears are not arbitrary. Unless purchase prices for 
fall 1994 are determined sufficiently reliably in the very near 
future, and unless appropriate contracts are signed, the peasant 
will not assume commitments to deliver grain on credit. To all 
appearances, the Russian Federation Government Food Commission 
understands this only too well, having given instructions to a 
number of ministries and departments to define the volume of 
budget funds necessary to cover expenditure on grain purchases 
as soon as possible, and with due account of inflation and other 
factors.

  [Text] St. Petersburg April 19 TASS -- Russia is 
developing, in cooperation with the European Bank of 
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), a federal programme on 
the development of small and medium towns. The Investment Bank 
of Reconstruction and Development of Small Russian Cities will 
be instituted for this purpose, Yevgeniy Malkov, the president 
of Russian Small Towns Union, told journalists on Tuesday at the 
presentation of the EBRD investment programmes in Russia. 
  The bulk of the investment projects are to be realized in 
St. 
Petersburg, Moscow and Nizhny Novgorod, but a considerable part 
of the Russian industries is situated in small towns. This is 
why Russia will come to a market economy only if it modernizes 
industry and transport in its small towns. 
  One of these programmes deals with reconstructing small 
ports 
on the Baltic, Black and Azov seas. Another one envisages 
reconstructing local airports and industrial facilities. 
  According to Uralvneshtorgbank official Sergey Obraz, "the 
Urals is a territory safe for investments because, no ethnic 
conflicts take place here, and local industry managed to 
preserve its high standards of research and development. 
Scientists and engineers working on defence enterprises (the 
Sverdlovsk region alone has five top-secret nuclear-technology 
towns) can produce new technologies, but cannot make money. 
This is why investment projects here should be launched before 
they give up their production capacities completely."

  [Text] Moscow, 19 Apr -- The current level of financing the 
armed forces will leave Russia without nuclear weapons by the 
end of the century, Lieutenant General Yuriy Merkulov said at 
parliamentary hearings in the State Duma. The Russian Defense 
Ministry representative supported his conclusion by an analysis 
of the state of strategic nuclear forces. All the indicators 
are showing a negative tendency. Thus, according to him, the 
submarine missile fleet is being forcibly reduced, aviation 
regiments are not getting new bombers and the funds allocated 
are not enough to service the missile facilities of strategic 
missile forces. 
  Today's hearings at the State Duma Defense Committee "On the 
implementation of the USSR-U.S. treaty on reducing and limiting 
strategic offensive armaments and on concomitant problems" 
revealed the difficulties which Russia is encountering while 
implementing its obligations. It was noted, inter alia, that 
START-I has been ratified but has not come into force. Its 
implementation is linked to long-term operations aimed at 
eliminating weapons and to the volumes of funding. 
  According to committee chairman Sergey Yushenkov, today's 
hearings should be regarded as a preliminary stage of the 
START-II ratification process. In Yushenkov's view, it will 
soon be submitted to the State Duma for ratification. The U.S. 
side is interested in the results of the forthcoming 
examination. A group of U.S. Congressmen is expected in Moscow 
in May. The main purpose of their visit is to ascertain the 
partners' attitude to the implementation by Russia of the treaty 
obligations for further reducing strategic offensive weapons.

  [Text] Moscow, 20 Apr -- Sergey Stepashin, director of the 
Russian Federal Counterintelligence Service (FSK), and Aleksandr 
Korzhakov, chief of the Russian Federation president's Security 
Service, exchanged views at a meeting today on cooperation 
between and coordinating the activity of the two special 
services to ensure the safety of the Russia president and state 
security as a whole. 
  The ITAR-TASS correspondent learned from the FSK that 
today's 
meeting was not caused by any extraordinary events. It was held 
within the framework of establishing collaboration between the 
counterintelligence service and other Russian special services 
in order to eradicate the duplication of work. 
  Sergey Stepashin and Aleksandr Korzhakov signed an agreement 
which lays down the legal and contractual basis for cooperation 
between the two special services in operational investigation 
work, and which envisages the regular exchange of information. 
  Earlier, a similar agreement was signed between the FSK and 
the Foreign Intelligence Service.

  [Text] Vladivostok, 20 Apr -- The Commander of the Pacific 
Fleet Admiral Georgiy Gurinov has issued an order to post armed 
guard at the fleet's water mains and power grids in the garrison 
in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy and to stop any attempts of local 
authorities to disconnect military installations from these 
services. The press center of the Pacific Fleet reports that 
this decision has been prompted by a recent warning issued to 
commanders of military units stating that their water and power 
will be cut off due to the arrears in payments which have now 
reached 4.5 billion rubles. 
  At the sanction of the head of the town administration, an 
attempt was undertaken to disconnect water and power from the 
headquarters and other units of the Kamchatka flotilla. The 
military quickly retaliated by posting armed guards. As a 
result, the town authorities are in trouble. To add insult to 
injury, an attempt of duty managers to disconnect the supply was 
stopped by a preventive gunshot of the guard.

  [Text] There will be a big shortage of draftees in the 
Russian army this spring. Only about 216,000 young men will be 
drafted, although the demand of the armed forces is 700,000. 
The draft and allocation to units will be completed by July 1, 
Commander of the Main Organizational and Mobilization Board of 
the Russian Armed Forces' General Headquarters General Vitaliy 
Bologov told INTERFAX on Tuesday. 
  He said that the shortage in the army is caused by the fact 
that many young men have the right to postpone their service, as 
well as by the worsening of draftees' health condition. The 
General noted that in the spring the armed forces can draft only 
27 percent of available "mobilization resources." He also said 
that in other countries the figure is 50 to 75 percent. 
  Bologov noted that the Defense Ministry will suggest that 
parliament introduce amendments in the near future to the laws 
on military service, on defense and some others in order to 
reduce the number of privileges and delays for draftees. 
  Commenting on the Russian president's decree on draft of 
citizens born in 1967-1976, Bologov noted that according to the 
Constitution of the country, a young man not older than 27 can 
be drafted to the army. 
  Bologov said that the autumn draft of 1993 was fulfilled to 
90.6 percent. He said that of more than 500,00 citizens 480,000 
were sent to serve in the army. The General added that 320,000 
draftees graduated from secondary professional-technical schools.

  [Text] "The task of building a new Russian Navy has to be 
resolved in extremely complex conditions. All the negative 
processes taking place in the Russian economy are also having an 
effect on service. We have lost a number of military bases in 
the Baltic, Black, and Caspian Seas, and attempts to play the 
naval card are continuing in various political circles," Viktor 
Chernomyrdin, Russian Federation Government prime minister, 
stated on Sunday, taking part in the ceremony of the 
commissioning in the Russian Navy of the first category 
destroyer Besstrashnyy.

  [Text] Moscow April 19 TASS -- Russian Defence Minister 
Pavel Grachev praised the situation in the Russian Air Force at 
a meeting of the Air Force leadership on Monday. This appraisal 
is corroborated by some indicative figures revealed to ITAR-TASS 
by officials at the Russian Air Force press centre on Tuesday. 
  Warplanes of the Russian Air Force were air-borne more than 
13,000 times over the past week alone. The total flying time 
amounted to 6,932 hours. Some 4,000 troops and their family 
members as well as 1,000 tonnes of cargoes were flown to 
garrisons and army groups between April 11 and 17. 
  Air Force planes helped to withdraw troops of the West Army 
Group from Germany, to bring replacement and foodstuffs to the 
201st Motorised Division (Tajikistan) and to replace personnel 
and materiel of the 14th Russian Army (Moldova). The Air Force 
press centre also reported that 37 international flights were 
made at the request of the Russian Foreign Ministry.

  [Text] On May 1, the Russian interior troops will be beefed 
up, but they will not be put in a state of alert, Interior 
Troops Commander Colonel General Anatoliy Kulikov announced 
during a briefing in Moscow. He said that the security of some 
of the military facilities would be enhanced to exclude the 
seizure of weapons and military equipment. "But there are no 
plans to draw forces to Moscow from other regions," he said. 
  To quote Kulikov, on May 1, interior troops will be in 
reserve and help the police if necessary. Kulikov referred to 
the law which says that the interior troops shall not be used 
for dispersing unsanctioned rallies or demonstrations, but shall 
be involved in dealing with mass disturbances. He also 
announced that in a number of regions, above all in the North 
Caucasus, the interior troops had to act in the backdrop of a 
complicated criminal situation. In 1993, interior troops came 
under fire 130 times in North Ossetia and Ingushetia. As a 
result, seven servicemen were killed and 133 were wounded. This 
year, interior troops were attacked more than 20 times. 
  He proposed that the Interior Minister be allowed to change 
the structure and dislocation of the interior troops depending 
on the criminal situation. He also noted that almost 17,000 
interior troop servicemen had no housing. "Spending on the 
interior troops meets only 60 percent of our needs," said 
Kulikov.

put them in full combat readiness" during the May Day 
celebrations, stated Colonel General Anatoliy Kulikov, internal

pointed out that being on reinforced duty means reinforced 
security at a number of troop facilities to prevent seizures of 
weapons and hardware. "No concentration of forces from the 
other regions in Moscow is contemplated," the commander 
underlined. In his words, internal troops would be enlisted 
during the May Day celebrations to help the militia "as a

  [Text] The currently reorganized special force Vympel will 
combat nuclear terrorism, Commander of the Russian Interior 
Troops, Colonel General Anatoliy Kulikov announced on Tuesday. 
He said that Vympel would be directly controlled by the 
interior minister. 
  He also pointed out that the tactics of the interior troops 
guarding nuclear power plants and nuclear defense facilities 
have become outdated in as they were mostly oriented against 
individual terrorists, not organized criminals. The interior 
troops also lack armored equipment and special security devices, 
said Kulikov. There are plans to equip servicemen with gas 
weapons, he stated. He also complained that the interior troops 
were 49 percent understaffed.

  [Text] Moscow April 20 TASS -- "We should receive fuller 
information on the situation and conduct measures aimed at 
preventing or lessening a radioactive leakage from the 
Komsomolets submarine, said here on Wednesday Sergey Khetagurov, 
deputy minister for civil defence and emergencies, defining the 
main task of a Russian expedition to the area of the sunken 
submarine to be held next June. He spoke at a working meeting 
of several ministries and departments which will participate in 
the expedition. 
  The mission plans to carry out comprehensive monitoring of 
the radiation, ecological and biological situation in the area 
of the submarine's wreckage with the use of advanced equipment 
and to realise several technological operations aimed at 
minimising a possible leakage of products of plutonium corrosion 
into the environment. 
  It is also planned to implement a unique operation at a 
depth 
of 1,700 meters to seal, with special hatches, six ports in the 
submarine's bow where there are six missiles, two of which are 
with nuclear warheads. 
  This will decrease the speed of water currents and minimise 
the leakage of products of plutonium corrosion. The operation 
on installing hatches will be simulated on the sub's specially 
built full-scale mockup. Meeting participants noted that there 
is no experience of conducting similar operations at such depths. 
  Khetagurov said in conclusion that the expedition is an 
expensive undertaking. Nevertheless, it is necessary for Russia 
and the entire international community. Therefore, it should be 
carried out at a high technological and organisational level.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoly Yurkin] </F>
  [Text] Moscow April 19 TASS -- The foreign press is 
accusing the Russian Pacific Fleet of discharging radioactive 
waste into the sea. It is characteristic that these accusations 
coincided with the beginning of the large-scale Russian 
operation "Fishing Season". The purpose of the operation is to 
put a stop to the depletion of fish stock in the Far East, 
particularly off the south Kurils, General Andrey Nikolayev, 
supreme commander of the Russian frontier troops, member of the 
Security Council, told ITAR-TASS. 
  He said that in addition to frontier guards and military 
aircraft, ships of the Pacific Fleet participate in the 
operation. 
  The effort to strenthen protection of national interest 
along 
Russia's eastern boundaries proved effective, as shown by 
communiques of the Supreme Command of the Russian frontier 
troops. A stop was put to ostentatious calls of groups of 
Japanese fishing vessels into Russian territorial waters and to 
large-scale poaching. Highly-manoeuvrable groups of ships 
promptly react to the situation and prevent violations of state 
border. 
  Far from everybody likes the normalisation of the situation 
in the Far East where Russia's neighbours have been permitting 
themselves lapses from the observance of the international norms 
and rules. Certain forces in Japan and in other countries of 
the region do not want the "thawing of glaciers" remaining from 
the past war. To thaw them by business cooperation and 
development of mutually- advantageous economic relations means 
to increase the might of the industrialised Japan and of the 
fabulously rich Russia. Experts believe that this does not suit 
rivals and that new portions of sensations are fed to the media. 
  The world public is aware that Russia does not discharge 
technological waste into the sea the way this is done by many 
other countries, Japan included. But going by publications, 
also in TOKYO SHIMBUN, this is not the matter of radioactive 
waste but that of its being the product of the operation of 
atomic submarines of the Russian Pacific Fleet. This fleet of 
the Russian Navy is seen as a menace in the Pacific and in the 
world ocean. Some circles are ready to go any lengths to 
present an unfavorable picture of the Pacific Fleet. So they 
speculate on economic and technological difficulties of the 
utilisation of waste of atomic submarines.

  [Text] Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky April 19 TASS -- "The 
status of border troops is rising, and I believe that the very 
concept of this structure is changing," Andrey Nikolayev, 
commander-in-chief of Russian border troops, said in an 
interview with ITAR-TASS here on Tuesday. He said this, 
replying to the question of whether his appointment a member of 
the Russian Security Council means a higher status of border 
troops within the system of ensuring the state's security. 
  "While the border was earlier the only boundary designed to 
fight single infiltrators," Nikolayev continued, "now we face an 
all-out 'offensive' of smugglers, drug and arms dealers as well 
as mobs. We need new border troops, and we are now working on 
this issue." 
  Nikolayev who was recently appointed a member of the 
Security 
Council by the Russian president's decree, is now making an 
inspection tour of the Russian Far East. 
  "The Russian Far Eastern bounderies have some features 
distinguishing them from other parts of the state border," 
Nikolayev noted. Their main part runs across sea expanses, 
forcing us to keep here powerful coast guard forces. "The main 
problem here is that it is an area of constant violations of 
fishing regulations. "We should find a way to settle this 
problem not by force but legally," Nikolayev stressed. "This 
area is of interest not only to Russia but to other states as 
well which should understand that they upset the ecological and 
biological balance in this part of the world ocean by destroying 
rich marine resources."

  [Text] Neither the military collegium of the Russian 
Supreme Court, nor court martials or other courts of the Russian 
Federation ever considered the criminal case of former Soviet 
citizen Vladimir Rezun (Viktor Suvorov) and sentenced him to 
death for high treason in absentia, the military collegium's 
press office said Tuesday. 
  Former officer of the Main Intelligence Department of the 
General Staff (Russian abbreviation GRU), Vladimir Rezun, 
defected from Geneva to Great Britain in 1978 after four years 
of work in Geneva as a fixed-post espionage officer. At 
present, 47-years-old Rezun lives in a military base in Great 
Britain under protection and teaches in a military educational 
establishment. 
  As he repeatedly said, Rezun was sentenced to death in the 
Soviet Union after his defection. 
  Rezun has written seven books. The Ice-Breaker which he 
signed as Viktor Suvorov is the most popular. In the book, Rezun 
based on open Soviet publications to prove that "the Soviet 
Union was the main culprit and the main instigator of the World 
War II" and that "the Communists unleashed the war in Europe by 
the hands of Hitler in the 30s and were preparing a swift strike 
against Hitler himself to seize the Europe he had destroyed." 
  The Ice-Breaker was published in many countries. In 1992 
more than 300,000 copies were printed in Russia. Rezun gave a 
news conference in Moscow on April 13 when he answered 
journalists' questions over the telephone from Britain.

  [Text] Belarusian Premier Vyacheslav Kebich reacted with 
irony to the statements by Belarusian ex-speaker Stanislav 
Shuskevich and leader of the Belarusian Popular Front Zenon 
Poznyak who called the signing of Russian-Belarusian documents 
on the unification of monetary systems "a crime," 
press-secretary of the Belarusian prime minister Vladimir 
Zametalin told INTERFAX. 
  He said that "Kebich considers such accusations another 
provocation by national-reformists, and the treaty with Russia, 
in the opinion of the prime minister, is the only way to 
preserve Belarus' sovereignty." 
  Zametalin also announced the prime minister's plans to hold 
an open meeting of the presidium of the Council of Ministers in 
the near future with unlimited participation of all interested 
parties and mass media in order to stop speculations around 
"so-called corruption." (He referred to accusations against 
some high-ranking officials made by chairman of the recently 
disbanded parliamentary commission against corruption Aleksandr 
Lukashenko) 
  Zametalin also said that the government meeting will be 
attended by top officials of the Republic's General Prosecutor's 
Office.

    [Editorial Report] Minsk Radio Minsk Network in Belarusian 
at 0515 GMT on 20 April airs a 10-minute recorded interview with 
Belarusian Prime Minister Vyachaslaw Kebich by reporter Syarhey 
Bulatskiy, assessing the signing of the agreement on the 
unification of Belarusian and Russian monetary systems. The 
date and place of the interview are not given; Kebich speaks in 
Russian. 
  The prime minister begins by responding to accusations by 
former legislative speaker Stanislaw Shushkevich and Popular 
Front Chairman Zyanon Paznyak who claim that the treaty 
"endangers the Republic's sovereignty." Popular Front deputies 
have sent a motion to the General Prosecutor's Office demanding 
that the signing of the treaty "receive a legal assessment." 
Kebich concentrates on the economic advantages of the treaty. 
According to him, Belarus will begin receiving duty-free 
products from Russia as of 1 May. Customs fees currently make 
up 30 to 40 percent of prices for products imported from Russia. 
Kebich points out that following the enactment of the treaty, 
Belarusian goods will be granted unhampered access to the 
Russian market, which will lower production costs. He says that 
"Belarusian goods will conquer the Russian market again and, as 
a final result, may bring about the reduction of retail prices." 
  Kebich points out that the reaction of certain political 
groups in the Republic to the signing of the treaty came as no 
surprise: "I used to tell government officials and members of 
the Council of Ministers Presidium that the signing of the 
treaty would give rise to hysterical screams by those who would 
claim that we betrayed our sovereignty. I categorically reject 
these kinds of claims." Kebich adds that the first deputy 
general prosecutor had telephoned him and requested access to 
documents necessary for conducting an investigation initiated by 
the deputies' motion. 
  Kebich underlines: "I know I did not violate the 
Constitution because I only signed that part of the treaty that 
lies within the government's competence. Article 5 was not 
signed by the National Bank because of existing reservations. 
Everything that refers to a change in the monetary system is 
under the bank's auspices and the bank voiced its reservations. 
Besides, I want to point out that the treaty has not come into 
effect because, just like any other treaty, it can be enacted 
only after all of its provisions are brought in line with our 
legislation. Thus, one way or another, there will be conflicts 
with some laws and we will have to amend them. I only did the 
Supreme Soviet's will. When the Supreme Soviet ratified the 
agreement on the introduction of monetary systems [as heard] 
government officials, including me, said that after the treaty 
is signed some legal acts will have to be amended and brought in 
line with the treaty. Every treaty in general -- why are we 
dwelling on the treaty with Russia? -- every treaty should be 
submitted to ratification by the legislature." 
  Asked by the reporter what measures he would suggest to 
resolve the dispute if the legislature declines to ratify the 
treaty, Kebich says: "I would propose seeking advice from the 
people. There are various ways to do this -- an opinion poll, 
polls in separate territories, and other forms. This should not 
necessarily be a referendum. Please, do not say that Kebich 
suggested holding a referendum on the day of presidential 
elections. These are futile fabrications of all those who want 
to trip me as a candidate for president. One should not think 
that Kebich worked here alone -- the entire government did. I 
am not a naive person, and I know perfectly well that it would 
not be quite ethical and correct to tamper with the Constitution 
days after its adoption. That is why, having signed the treaty 
and having made it the groundwork for further negotiations, we 
did everything not to violate the Constitution. At the recent 
CIS summit, both I and Mechyslaw Hryb talked to Boris Yeltsin 
and asked him to do everything not to make us meddle in the 
Constitution." 
  Commenting on the future effects of the treaty, Kebich says: 
"The exchange of 200,000 Belarusian rubles in cash and 1,000,000 
in bank savings accounts is a one-time thing," and underlines 
the more permanent effects. He points out that even if the 
treaty fails to bring about a reduction in retail prices it 
would be a "tangible victory" if further increases in prices 
were prevented while wages continued to grow: "To increase 
wages, our enterprises have to start working. To do this they 
need a free flow of products. The treaty facilitates free 
shipment of every producer's goods to the Russian market. We 
are not working because we have been flooded with products that 
were once manufactured and could not be sold because of their 
high cost. Every citizen knows that he will work a full week 
now, his wage will be constantly growing, and his living 
standard improving. Through some reason, both journalists and 
our opponents decline to discuss this aspect of the treaty." 
  Kebich insists that the issue has been artificially laded 
with political sense on the eve of presidential elections. 
  The prime minister then answers questions regarding public 
transportation problems in Minsk and an increase in prices for 
postal services. 
  Asked about his impressions from the CIS summit in Moscow, 
Kebich says: "I went to Moscow with a hope that a supranational 
economic committee would be created to step up economic 
integration among CIS states. However to my regret, this body's 
status was downgraded. It was formed within the framework of the 
Consultative Committee and of course it will be unable to 
perform the full scope of its functions. I am disappointed, 
but I do believe that the CIS should continue to function."

<F P=106> [Interview with People's Deputy Valyantsin Holubew by </F>
Lyudmila Klaskowskaya on 30 March; place not given: "Valyantsin 
Holubew: `Constitution Gives Our People a Chance for 
Self-Deliverance'"] 
  [Excerpt] On the birthday of the Belarusian Constitution 
-- on the day of its coming into force [30 March 1994] -- we 
spoke with one of the "fathers" of the fundamental law of our 
young independent state -- People's Deputy Valyantsin Holubew. 
  [Klaskowskaya] At a news conference held just after the 
adoption of the Constitution, one of your colleagues said the 
following: "This Constitution is a product of compromise." 
Thus, are you not fully satisfied with the results of your work? 
  [Holubew] Even though I was one of the authors of the 
Belarusian Constitution, I did not vote in favor of its 
adoption. Why? I think that the Supreme Soviet took the wrong 
approach, having put three chapters to a vote -- chapters on the 
presidency, parliament, and bodies of local self-government -- 
without any discussion. There are problems there, and I think 
that these problems will crop up again in the future. However, 
I refused to vote only because I wanted the Constitution to 
become better. 
  In general, while assessing the Constitution, it should be 
stated positively: It is a high-class law which we have never 
had before. I mean, in this century; in the past, the Statute of 
the Grand Duchy of Lithuania [law code adopted in 16th century] 
was a document of the highest legal order, which was used as a 
fundamental law by even some European countries. 
  The new Constitution includes practically all the world's 
democratic legal norms. In the future, some amendments may be 
introduced, but its foundation -- I mean the chapters "On the 
foundations of constitutional order" and "On individual, 
society, and state" -- are stable. Our fundamental law has 
absorbed basic ideas from constitutions of the most advanced 
nations. 
  It is a pity that not everything that was planned has been 
accomplished. I believe that a new Supreme Soviet will go 
further than that -- it will vote in favor of a professional 
parliament as well as write down that our national flag is 
white-red-white and our national coat of arms is the Pahonya 
[knight in pursuit]... 
  [Klaskowskaya] However, let us return to compromises... 
  [Holubew] Let us take Article 17, which stipulates that "the 
official language of the Republic of Belarus is Belarusian." 
The second part reads: "The Republic of Belarus secures the 
right of the free use of Russian as a language of interethnic 
relations." I think that this could have been omitted. Who has 
the right to determine in which language people will converse? 
Suppose, interlocutors can speak English or Polish fluently... 
it is not a compromise, but pressure on the part of a 
professional [as published] majority. 
  Life has amended the Constitution in the process of its 
drafting. Thus, the first version of Article 19 provided for 
incomplete secondary education. However, what have we attained? 
Having completed the 9th grade, youngsters are practically sent 
out into the streets. It is more expedient for the state to 
keep them under its control until they reach full age. The new 
Constitution guarantees available and free general secondary 
education for everyone. 
  [Klaskowskaya] The first line of the Constitution -- "We, 
the people of the Republic of Belarus..." -- makes one 
automatically think of the U.S. Constitution. There have also 
been reports that you actively used the Constitution of Germany 
as a starting point for your work. If so, is the final document 
not a copy of Western constitutions? If not, what is the 
difference, what is original in the Belarusian Constitution? 
  [Holubew] I am one of the authors of the preamble to the 
fundamental law. We have not copied the U.S. version or any 
other -- it came from the heart. It was important to show 
historical prerequisites for the promulgation of our 
Constitution. We have noted that we were guided by our 
historical advancements in the sphere of the constitutional 
building in Belarus, that is, by our old codes of law, the 
Statute of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the constituent 
declarations of the Belarusian Popular Republic [issued in 
1918], and the Constitution of the Belarusian Soviet Socialist 
Republic. By this, the distinctiveness of the Belarusian 
Constitution has been preserved. For the first time, it was 
certified that Belarusian statehood has an old and distinguished 
history. 
  By acquainting ourselves with democratic norms in other 
countries, we examined the applicability of those norms to our 
reality. Thus, for example, we have not only recognized the 
equality of all religious denominations before the law, but also 
provided that endowing any one denomination with certain 
advantages is inadmissible. By the way, our fundamental law 
forbids the activities of religious organizations which can 
infringe upon state sovereignty, the constitutional order, and 
civic accord; such a provision is not included in constitutions 
of other countries. This refers not only to the Orthodox and 
Catholic Churches, but also to those sects and groups which are 
being actively advertised on posters in Belarusian cities. Our 
people have habits, traditions, and a culture of their own, 
which should be defended by the state. 
  [Klaskowskaya] It has already become commonplace to cite the 
example of Stalin's constitution. As known, this document, 
drafted primarily by Nikolay Bukharin, was attractive and 
democratic in its outward appearance, but it did not prevent the 
mustached leader from carrying out genocide against his people. 
Can you guarantee that our Constitution will not be only a piece 
of paper for purely ornamental purposes? 
  [Holubev] There are guarantees in the Constitution. It is 
stated unequivocally that the only source of state power is the 
people; the people exercise their power directly, through 
representative bodies. However, you can find virtually the same 
statements in the old Constitution. And let me remind you, when 
the people tried to express their opinion in a referendum, the 
highest legislative body simply ignored it. Is this possible in 
the future? 
  I have voiced my anxiety about an incomplete match between 
the chapters regarding parliament, the presidency, and local 
self-government. I think that legislative elections should 
precede presidential ones. Just imagine a democratic president 
assuming this high post, while there still remains the old 
parliament which objects to him and boycotts every one of his 
resolutions... 
  [Klaskowskaya] As is known, the introduction of a presidency 
in Russia was followed by a harsh conflict between the branches 
of power, which finally turned into a bloody confrontation. Are 
we insured against such a danger? 
  [Holubew] I would not draw any parallel between Belarus and 
Russia. Belarusians will not allow civil war to break out in 
their country. The creed of the Belarusian Popular Front, of 
which I am a representative, is to fully obey the law. Our main 
slogan states that no political achievement can be worthwhile if 
it has been accomplished by bloodshed. 
  The Constitution will not be only a declarative document, if 
the people, as Kupala [Belarusian poet] said, arise from their 
sleep. This Constitution grants many rights to the people. When 
Belarusians realize that their deliverance depends not on some 
politicians or foreign uncles from the ruble zone, but on their 
own will, then people's woes will recede. Let me recall Kupala 
once more: "I will fight for freedom with all my heart, I will 
go for it through fire and water." In short, the Constitution 
gives our people a chance for self-deliverance. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Minsk 19 April, TASS -- An IMF delegation arrived in 
Minsk on Tuesday to discuss articles of the IMF Charter and hold 
talks on granting Belarus the second part of the credit from the 
fund of system transformations. 
  "The Belarussian [Belarusian] Government has taken all the 
necessary measures to obtain the second half of the credit worth 
98 million U.S. dollars," said Natalya Prokopyeva, chief expert 
of the department of international financial organisations of 
the Belarussian Council of Ministers. The first part of the 
credit was granted to Belarus in July, 1993. The credit was 
intended "for leveling the balance of payments" and using the 
money mainly to repay Belarussian debt to Russia. 
  The credit was granted by the IMF for a term of ten years, 
allowing a delay of 4.5 years. The interest rate is 5.67 per 
cent a year.

<F P=106> [Report by Lyudmila Feliksova: "Chisinau and Tiraspol Seek </F>
Compromise"] 
  [Text] Chisinau -- The eighth round of talks between the 
Moldovan and Russian delegations on the 14th Army has been held 
in Chisinau. In official language, this means organizing the 
legal status and the procedure and timetable for the withdrawal 
of the Russian military formations temporarily present in the 
Republic of Moldova. 
  Despite the smiles and the correct formulas from the 
delegation heads (Russia is represented by special envoy V. 
Kitayev, while Moldova is represented by A. Tsaran [name as 
transliterated], ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary), 
judging by everything, the talks have been difficult. The main 
point of difference has been the timetable for the withdrawal. 
The Moldovan side, which had been insisting on July 1994, is 
prepared to wait another year or two, while the Russian side, 
without setting any precise timeframe, considers a longer period 
to be more realistic. 
  There is one other point on which the sides were unable to 
reach full mutual understanding. An agreement signed by the two 
presidents -- Boris Yeltsin and Mircea Snegur -- stipulates the 
principle of synchronizing the timetable for the 14th Army's 
withdrawal with the adoption of legal status for the Dniester 
Region. And, as the Russian side stressed, it is a question of 
a joint accord, rather than a unilateral Russian initiative or 
its interference in another state's internal affairs. But 
Moldovan Ambassador Tsaran believes that the synchronization 
principle has not proved its worth and has turned into a brake 
on the negotiating process. 
  V. Kitayev expressed the conviction that the Dniester 
problem 
would be solved, and Russia is actively supporting the political 
settlement process. As for the synchronization principle, from 
his standpoint, it would be far more productive to conduct the 
talks themselves rather than to complain about unsuitable 
principles. 
  The question of creating a military base to replace the 14th 
Army was not discussed. As for General Lebed and his political 
activeness, E. Vorobyev, a Russian Defense Ministry spokesman, 
said that the 14th Army commander is highly valued as a 
professional and honest general, but people do not approve of 
his predilection for various political statements. The 14th 
Army's property -- which, judging by the edict from Dniester 
Region President I. Smirnov, that region claims -- belongs to 
Russia, and the Russian Foreign Ministry has issued an official 
statement on this score. 
  But, on the whole, observers made a positive assessment of 
the last round of talks. From their standpoint there was some 
progress in this area. In particular, draft agreements on 
questions of jurisdiction, mutual legal aid, and issues relating 
to social guarantees for servicemen and pensions provision were 
initialed. A jointly elaborated methodology for defining the 
technical timetable for the withdrawal of troops and military 
cargo from Moldovan territory has been signed. The next meeting 
is planned for May. 
  Thus, new realities have emerged in the protracted talks. In 
this connection our correspondent asked Georgiy Marakutsa, 
chairman of the Dniester Region Supreme Soviet, to comment on 
the current situation. 
  "The Dniester Region Supreme Soviet expressed its 
attitude," he said, "in a statement which says that the results 
of the elections to the Moldovan parliament and an opinion poll 
show that there is a new sociopolitical situation in the 
Republic, and that this makes it possible to hope for an end to 
political extremism at state level. 
  "In the current Moldovan parliament Agrarians and Socialists 
make up a bloc with which dialogue is possible. But I am not 
expecting any immediate results. It will take time to rid 
ourselves of national-patriotic euphoria and illusions, as well 
as of the idea that the Dniester Republic was allegedly the 
artificial fruit of a group of politicians. 
  "If we cite the will of the people, their view of our region 
was expressed at the recent elections. Out of 485,000 voters 
only 6,800 took part in the formation of the new Moldovan 
parliament. International observers did not record a single 
instance of any obstacles being erected on our part. Those who 
wanted to vote could do so. 
  ``Some 1.5 percent made their choice, and that is their 
right, but the rest of the population, by their failure to 
participate in the elections, also expressed their will, thereby 
confirming that the Dniester Republic was created by the people 
rather than by individual politicians, as people in Chisinau 
have been claiming hitherto. If the Moldovan leadership 
realizes its mistake there is hope that there will be a 
dialogue, although there will be many obstacles to it. 
  ``Chisinau is paying lip-service to the idea of the 
indivisibility and integrity of Moldova, but in fact our 
relations have long since moved to the level of interstate 
relations. If we are one state, then why is a national currency 
being unilaterally introduced, why are the balance of trade and 
mutual transactions with us conducted as they would be with 
Ukraine or Belarus? Or take the loans from the West -- of which 
we have not received a single kopek. Who will repay them? All 
of us together? We will not stand for that. Just name a single 
country where internal relations are conducted on this basis. 
  ``M. Snegur's trip to Brussels to sign NATO's `Partnership 
For Peace' program is further evidence of our separateness. 
Moldova is seeking security guarantees there. Who from? From 
Russia? Ukraine? Of course not. Wouldn't it be better to 
choose another way -- self-demilitarization, as we have long 
suggested? 
  ``In short, there are many issues. And they require 
solution. We recognize the integrity of the Republic of Moldova 
and its external borders, and we are prepared for any 
compromises, but only up to a certain point. That point has 
been defined -- the statehood of the Dniester Region. 
  ``This is not a whim or a caprice, it is not a question of 
clinging on to power, as Chisinau makes out, rather it is the 
only way to deal with our destiny in such a way as to ensure 
that nobody is ever able -- irrespective of the changing 
political weather in Chisinau -- to dictate terms to this 
region. We will not retreat from statehood. Filling it with 
content is another matter. This can be decided around the 
negotiating table, and we are ready to sit down at it.''

  [Text] Moldova has decided to slash by one-third natural 
gas supplies to its industrial sector due to the country's huge 
debt for gas imports, said deputy prime Minister Valentin Cunev. 
  Moldova cannot repay the debt of 131 billion Russian rubles 
with money from its treasury, Cunev said in a television 
program. "The (state) budget is well-balanced and its deficit 
must not exceed 3.5 percent of the gross domestic product," 
which prompts a "very simple" solution -- "if you can't pay cut 
down your consumption," he said. 
  Moldova consumes no more energy today than four years ago 
but 
"produces much fewer goods," Cunev said. 
  He said it would be cheaper for Moldova to buy crude oil in 
the Middle East and have it refined in Romania. But Moldova 
does not have enough hard currency to pay for this, while 
oil-exporters in the Commonwealth of Independent States accept 
Moldovan goods as payment. 
  Russia has pledged to provide Moldova with 3.5 billion cubic 
meters of gas this year, while the Russian gas monopoly Gazprom 
a few days ago axed by one-third its supplies to Moldova due to 
the latter's arrears.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Boris Krivoshey and </F>
Aleksandr Krylovich] 
  [Text] Moscow, 19 Apr -- "There cannot be any question of 
terminating talks with one of the parties to a settlement of the 
conflict in Bosnia," Mikhail Demurin, deputy head of a 
directorate of the Russian Foreign Ministry's information and 
press department, told a briefing today. "The talks must 
continue. This is our general line and we will not retreat from 
this line," he stressed. 
  The Russian side believes that "the only way to resolve 
conflicts in former Yugoslavia and other parts of the world is 
to hold political talks." This position, the diplomat said, is 
the reason why Russia is calling for restraint, compromise, and 
mutual understanding. 
  The Foreign Ministry spokesman blamed the so-called "party 
of 
war" for inflaming the situation around Gorazde by "recklessly 
gambling on the achievement of military victory." According to 
him, this gambling will first of all inflict damage on the 
Serbian people themselves. 
  M. Demurin pointed to the inappropriateness of raising the 
question of lifting sanctions in a situation "where the Serbian 
troops are at Gorazde." In his opinion, the resolution of this 
question is being postponed for some time, depending on which 
way the situation develops." He said that during the recent 
talks between Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and 
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, the Russian side promised 
Belgrade its "most active support" in resolving the questions of 
lifting the sanctions stage-by-stage. He said: "During the same 
meeting, other agreements were also reached, in particular, 
unblocking the situation around Gorazde." The Serbian side gave 
appropriate assurances, M. Demurin stressed. "However, the 
words of those who gave these assurances are totally at odds 
with their deeds," the Russian diplomat said.

  [Excerpts] Moscow, April 20 (AFP) -- President Boris 
Yeltsin chaired Wednesday a meeting of his top advisers in the 
Russian Security Council expected to focus on the Bosnian 
conflict. [passage omitted] 
  Meanwhile, the Russian newspaper SEGODNYA reported Wednesday 
that Moscow had decided to recall its ambassador to Belgrade 
Gennadiy Shikin for consultations, heralding a possible severing 
of relations with the rump Yugoslavia. 
  The paper, quoting a reliable source at the Russian Foreign 
Ministry, said that Moscow "no longer believes in the 
possibility of an adequate political dialogue with the Bosnian 
Serbs. 
  "The theories according to which (Bosnian Serb leader) 
Radovan Karadzic no longer controls his troops are false. It is 
obvious that there is a deliberate intention (on the part of the 
Serbs) to prevent any constructive dialogue between the warring 
sides," the paper said. 
  The Foreign Ministry would neither confirm nor deny the 
SEGODNYA report. [passage omitted]

Yugoslav conflict. Specifically, today the Foreign Ministry 
denied a report on a possible severance of diplomatic relations 
between Moscow and Belgrade. 
  Yevgeniy Podkolzin, commander of Russian airborne landing 
troops, described as speculations reports on a withdrawal of the 
Russian battalion of Blue Helmets from Sarajevo. He said that 
this issue has not even been discussed. Also, a group of 
Russian servicemen was dispatched there yesterday, and today it 
was followed by another one. 
  Russian Blue Berets have been serving with UN peace-keeping 
forces in Yugoslavia for over two years. Two Russian battalions 
are stationed in the eastern sector and in Sarajevo area. Now 
their personnel is being relieved, which is a normal rotation. 
Two hundred paras are replacing their comrades in the hottest 
spot in the world. They have left for Yugoslavia from Ryazan.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Abarinov report under the "Yugoslavia" rubric: </F>
"Russia Washes Its Hands. Have the Bosnian Serbs Lost Their 
Last Ally?"] 
  [Text] According to reports from confidential sources, the 
document drawn up at the Russian Foreign Ministry had a harsh 
tone: they in Moscow think that the Bosnian Serb leaders hold a 
clearly unconstructive stance aimed at destroying Muslim 
enclaves on the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In the 
current situation Russia does not see any reason to continue its 
mediatory efforts. The reserves of goodwill have been exhausted. 
The world community cannot tolerate the incidents of downright 
aggression and genocide. From now on the coercion into peace 
holds the only chance to bring the situation back into a 
manageable and legitimate framework. This is how the 
president's statement should have sounded. Boris Yeltsin, 
however, limited himself to yet another appeal for peace 
addressed to the Bosnian Serbs and the world community. 
  It could not be taken for granted that the Russian 
president, 
who has repeatedly said that he will not allow the use of force 
in Bosnia, would sign the text of a diametrically opposed 
content. It is known, however, that the soldiers who were 
supposed to reinforce the Russian peacekeeping contingent in 
Sarajevo received an eleventh hour stand-down signal and are 
presently heading for the much more secure Croatia. The next 
step may involve a full evacuation of the Russian battalion from 
the area of Sarajevo. According to reports received by 
SEGODNYA, our soldiers, who were initially welcomed in an 
altogether friendly manner by the Serbs, now have found 
themselves in the position of invaders. Serb leaders have fully 
discredited themselves as responsible politicians, a trustworthy 
source said. Insinuations that Radovan Karadzic and General 
Granic cannot control the activities of field commanders are 
groundless. Evidently, we are witnessing a deliberate 
obstruction of any attempts to organize a constructive dialogue 
between the warring sides, a clear violation of undertaken 
obligations, the desire to impose on the international community 
the status quo that has come about as a result of territorial 
seizures that have not been authorized by anyone, presenting the 
world with a fait accompli. 
  Be that as it may, the Russian Foreign Ministry has fully 
lost faith in the possibility of an effective political dialogue 
with the Bosnian Serbs. The perfidy of our counterparts, the 
source said, is beyond description. The situation is 
reminiscent precisely of those as a result of which world wars 
were unleashed. The world community is facing a difficult 
dilemma. The possibilities of talks, however, have been fully 
exhausted. 
  There is still a question mark as to the stance of the 
Belgrade authorities, the Foreign Ministry source said. One is 
getting the impression that Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic has fallen victim to treachery by his own 
comrades-in-arms in Bosnia. It is quite possible, however, that 
he himself may be an accomplice in the treachery. In this case, 
there is no longer any point in any contacts with Belgrade at 
all. According to SEGODNYA's information, today the Russian 
Federation Foreign Ministry decided to recall to Moscow for 
consultations Gennadiy Shikin, Russian ambassador to the Union 
Republic of Yugoslavia. In terms of severity, this diplomatic 
demarche is second only to a break in diplomatic ties. 
  Thus Moscow has given the go-ahead to NATO's actions in 
Bosnia.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Kuznechevskiy "Commentary": "Catastrophe of UN </F>
`Peace' Plan in Yugoslavia"] 
  [Text] When last week U.S. Phantoms bombarded Serbian 
positions in the region of Gorazde ostensibly to protect UN 
peacekeeping forces, some people may also have thought that what 
we had here was a desperate desire to contain locally the 
conflict between the Muslims and the Serbs that had flared up 
around the city in order to be able to settle the conflict as a 
whole. 
  Today, when -- as a result of military provocation by the 
Muslims in this region and in the wake of support for this 
provocation by NATO military air power -- the Serbs have stopped 
holding back and their tanks have entered Gorazde, the situation 
has changed abruptly not only in and around Gorazde but in the 
whole of the former Yugoslavia. 
  It must first be observed that the UN plan for a so-called 
peaceful settlement in Yugoslavia is finished. The epithet 
"peaceful" is no longer appropriate to this plan (after the 
appointment of a specialist in airborne operations, the British 
General Rose, as commander of the UN peacekeeping forces in this 
region, and his being given the right to use NATO war planes 
against the Serbs), nor is the word "settlement," since after 
the Serbian civilian population was bombarded and a French 
reconnaissance plane was fired on by the Serbs, we are talking 
about the outbreak of hostilities between the Armed Forces of 
the Serbian Republic in Bosnia and NATO. 
  In short, the past week's events in Bosnia have drawn a line 
under more than three years of attempts by the Western community 
to resolve the Yugoslav conflict by the methods of diktat (both 
diplomatic and military). Today, everything is starting 
practically from zero again. And in this zero situation only 
two possible scenarios can be perceived. Either NATO goes over 
to full-scale military operations against the Serbs. Or all 
methods of diktat are stopped and the West recognizes that the 
Serbs have an equal status as a party to an agreement and starts 
negotiations which can really lead to a peaceful settlement of 
the situation in the Balkans (and for this it will be necessary 
to repeal UN economic sanctions against the FRY). 
  In either event, it must be recognized today that the United 
Nations, with its methods of peacefully settling the Yugoslavian 
crisis, has failed completely as a result of the arrogance of 
the Western community which decided that after the USSR's 
collapse and the end of the Cold War, the West could on its own 
and without Russia's involvement foist a new international order 
on the world, in which the whole of the rest of the world that 
is not included in the concept of the "Western community" will 
carry out the West's instructions.

<F P=106> [Report by Maksim Yusin: "Moscow Tries to Stop Serbs Going </F>
Over the Edge] 
  [Text] Belgrade/Moscow -- The Serbs' decisive offensive 
against the Muslim enclave of Gorazde on 16 April placed Europe 
on the brink of a major war. It was only weather conditions 
that prevented NATO aircraft from delivering a new and this time 
massive strike against Serb positions. 
  Russian diplomacy is desperately trying to save the 
situation. President Yeltsin's special representative Vitaliy 
Churkin went to the Bosnian Serbs' capital, Pale, while Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev paid an emergency visit to Belgrade, 
where on Saturday night through early Sunday morning he met with 
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. 
  According to the original plan, Kozyrev was to have flown to 
Yugoslavia no earlier than Sunday. The rapid deterioration of 
the situation forced him to act without delay. The members of 
the Russian delegation discovered that the visit had been 
switched to Saturday only two hours before the flight out. 
  Addressing the press after the talks with Kozyrev, the 
Serbian president was unperturbed, repeating again that both 
Belgrade and the Bosnian Serbs favor a peaceful solution and the 
only reason for the deterioration of the situation around 
Gorazde is provocations on the part of the Muslims. 
  But in private conversations Yugoslav officials admit that 
there is another reason -- the implacable stance of General 
Ratko Mladic, commander in chief of the Bosnian Serbs. Neither 
Radovan Karadjic, leader of the "Serb Republic" in Bosnia, nor 
Milosevic himself can control this man's actions. What with his 
powerful friends in the Yugoslav army's top leadership, Mladic 
is to a large extent invulnerable, even where the all-powerful 
Serbian president is cocnerned. 
  According to information from reliable sources, two years 
ago, during Kozyrev's first visit to Belgrade, Russian diplomats 
pressed the Yugoslavs to get rid of Mladic, who was obsessed 
with the idea of creating a "Greater Serbia" and was prepared to 
enter into confrontation with the whole world in order to 
realize his dream. But Milosevic made it plain that he could do 
nothing. 
  Now he is reaping the fruits. The belief among Kozyrev's 
entourage is that Milosevic's promise to influence the Bosnian 
Serbs and persuade them to cease firing on Gorazde was entirely 
sincere. As were Karadjic's assurances, when he swore to 
Churkin that he would immediately halt the offensive against the 
Muslim enclave. Despite this, the attacks continued and Serb 
tanks captured the suburbs of the city that had been declared a 
"safe area" by the United Nations. 
  "The Serb military is acting independently, often ignoring 
the will of the political leadership," a Russian diplomat 
dealing with the Balkans, who wished not to be named, told 
IZVESTIYA. "Mladic is a sinister figure. He will not have any 
compromises. It is his profound belief that neither NATO nor 
the United Nations is prepared to take decisive action and all 
their threats are empty ones. Our main task was to convince 
Milosevic and Karadjic that the situation was far more serious 
and that events might take a very nasty turn if the Serbs did 
not respond to the UN demand and pull back from Gorazde." 
  "In conversation with Milosevic Kozyrev voiced our concern, 
to put it mildly, over the Bosnian Serbs' behavior. He took a 
very tough stance," Galina Sidorova -- the minister's political 
adviser -- said after the talks. If Belgrade helps to defuse 
the situation in Bosnia, Kozyrev promised to demand a relaxation 
of international sanctions against Yugoslavia. There is 
information that suggests that the Americans were prepared to 
join the Europeans in supporting Russia's initiative, having 
hitherto opposed any concessions to Belgrade. 
  But this can only happen in the event of the normalization 
of the Gorazde situation. The latest reports from the area do 
not provide any grounds for optimism, unfortunately. Battles 
between Serbs and Muslims are continuing and NATO air strikes 
could be launched at any moment. Even Vitaliy Churkin, who 
tends not to be pessimistic about things, on this occasion acted 
out of character, declaring that he did not believe a ceasefire 
in Gorazde was possible. 
  If the Serbs continue the offensive, Gorazde is bound to 
fall. Militarily the enclave is doomed -- the Muslim army is 
incapable of defending it. The capture of the city would be a 
public slap in the face not only for the United Nations, but for 
the North Atlantic bloc as well, which would have demonstrated 
its impotence. Neither Butrus-Ghali, nor the leaders of the 
Western states can accept this. It would jeopardize the 
prestige and political future of many Western leaders -- and 
Russia's protests would no longer stop them in that event. 
  The question for NATO now is not whether to launch another 
strike against the Serbs, but how to make it as effective as 
possible. According to information at the disposal of people in 
Smolenskaya Square, NATO headquarters is working on plans for a 
ground operation in Bosnia. But that would require a massive 
amount of preparation and a great deal of time. NATO will 
obviously have to confine itself to an aerial war in the 
foreseeable future. Experts believe it would be futile to go 
hunting for Serb tanks and mortars in mountainous and wooded 
terrain. A strike against Serb units attacking Gorazde would 
not have any significant effect either. The Serbs are employing 
ideal tactics: Rapidly breaking through the enemy's line of 
defense, they are mixing with the civilian populace, which makes 
them invulnerable to NATO aircraft. 
  If Western leaders decide to switch from a show of force to 
major combat actions, they will be forced to attack the Bosnian 
Serbs' strategic facilities -- headquarters, communications 
centers, ammunition dumps, and, most important, several bridges 
over the Drina River, linking the "Serb Republic" in Bosnia to 
Serbia. The destruction of these bridges would be a terrible 
blow to the Bosnian Serbs, because it would mean that Belgrade 
would be unable to come to their rescue. 
  In that case the conflict would be in danger of developing 
into a military clash between NATO and Yugoslavia. Belgrade has 
repeatedly made it clear that it would regard the bombing of the 
bridges as a declaration of war... 
  For Russian diplomats this prospect is a nightmare they want 
to avoid. Unfortunately, the current situation is such that 
none of the potential scenarios, including that one, can be 
dismissed. 
  The efforts of Kozyrev and Churkin have given a ray of hope 
of a peaceful resolution of the crisis. But the situation as a 
whole remains critical. According to UN spokesmen, a Serb shell 
was fall on Gorazde every 20 seconds on Monday morning.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Yuriy Soltan] </F>
  [Text] Shrouded in mist and indefinable. This may be the 
closest definition of the situation in Bosnia. As before, 
events around Gorazde, one of the six towns declared by the 
United Nations as safe havens, are giving cause for great 
concern. Several hours of negotiations by the Russian 
president's special representative to Yugoslavia, Vitaliy 
Churkin, with the Bosnian leaders have so far failed to produce 
any positive results. Radovan Karadzic, the leader of the 
Bosnian Serbs, seemed to have agreed to a cease-fire and a 
withdrawal of forces from Gorazde and to ensure an unhindered 
access to the town by humanitarian convoys. But in practice 
this has not happened. 
  According to Vitaliy Churkin, a small group of Bosnian Serbs 
have become sick by the senseless war and are trying to drag 
into the melee all the other Serbs. They are sowing the seeds 
of hatred, not only towards the Muslims and the Croats but also 
to the entire world community. According to Vitaliy Churkin, 
Russia, as a great and responsible power, cannot allow a group 
of extremists to use such a policy as a cover for their actions. 
  This does not mean that Moscow is breaking off its peace 
efforts in Bosnia. And Vitaliy Churkin's words cannot be 
interpreted as a Russian U-turn over to the side which seems to 
accuse only the Serbs for all the sins in Bosnia. It is the 
firm conviction of Russia's leaders that there ought to be equal 
pressure imposed on the other side too -- the Muslims. It was 
precisely the Muslims who took the NATO air bombardment of 
Serbian positions around Gorazde as a carte blanche to launch 
military offensives, not only in Gorazde but along the whole of 
the Serbian-Muslim front. 
  NATO's damaging air raids have become more and more obvious 
as being ill-advised. Such bombardments did not protect the UN 
peacekeepers, but on the contrary have put them in a more 
dangerous situation. The most unfortunate fallout from the air 
strikes is that the peace process has been imperiled. Reaching 
an agreement will now be much more difficult. 
  Regrettably the United Nations Secretary General, Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali, believes that it's possible to widen NATO's 
military operations in Bosnia. He sent a letter to NATO's 
headquarters asking the alliance to prepare for air strikes not 
only in Gorazde but in all the other so-called safe havens. 
  The Russian representative at the United Nations, Yuriy 
Vorontsov, justifiably points out the dangers in such a step and 
has warned that Russia will oppose an automatic unilateral 
decision to carry out new bombing raids in Bosnia. 
  Events in Bosnia are drawing the republic to a decisive 
culmination. Either NATO under the United Nations flag will 
enlarge its military operations in Bosnia -- a step that could 
lead to an escalation of the war, as happened in Vietnam and 
Afghanistan -- or new attempts will be made through political 
means to reconcile the warring sides and encourage them to 
return to the negotiating table. Such a possibility still 
exists. Russia, with other interested countries, intends to 
pursue this option with all possible vigor.

<F P=106> [Mikhail Karpov report in the "Crisis" column under general </F>
headline: "Stop Any Negotiations With the Bosnian Serbs. This 
Has Been Urged by Vitaliy Churkin, the Russian Federation 
President's Special Envoy"] 
  [Text] It seems that the latest negotiations by Kozyrev in 
Belgrade and Churkin in Pale were used by Milosevic and Karadzic 
in their purely egoistic interests. In this event it appears 
that U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who accused the 
Serbs of spinning a web of lies and deceptive statements about 
their intentions in Gorazde, is right. According to him, "the 
Serbs are lying to the United Nations and even to their 
traditional ally, Russia." 
  This probably accounts for the sharpness of Vitaliy 
Churkin's 
statement. Incidentally, the West missed no chance of noting 
that the Serbs' tactics in Gorazde annoy the Russian leadership. 
This led to the conclusion that Moscow may not after all have 
so many levers to influence them. And even that relations 
between it and Belgrade are not as friendly as was thought 
earlier. In this context it is supposed that President Yeltsin, 
whose statement on the Bosnian crisis was expected yesterday, 
will take all this into account and start cooperating with the 
West more closely. It is unlikely, however, that the 
presidential statement will coincide in tone with Churkin's 
pronouncements. 
  The latter, if facing far from easy explanations to the 
parliament, the unmistakably pro-Serbian mood of the majority of 
whose deputies is well known. Apparently Churkin will also have 
a dialogue with the military who up until now have had certain 
disagreements with the Foreign Ministry's position on a number 
of issues. It would be premature in these conditions to talk 
about a radical change of line in Russia's policy in the 
Balkans. It is clear, however, that it can be essentially 
adjusted, which does not bode any comfort to the "cheats" from 
the Serb leadership both in Pale and Belgrade. But in any 
event, it is hard to expect that on the question of a Balkan 
settlement Russia will resort to the children's formula, "the 
cat has left her kittens...." ["koshka brosila kotyat"]

<F P=106> [Yevgeniy Popov article: "A `Blue Sword' for Harakiri?"] </F>
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] The NATO air strikes on the 
Serbian positions near Gorazde created an entirely new situation 
in the Bosnian war. The United States and the other Western 
countries, using the mandate of the UN peacemaking forces, have 
effectively entered the civil war on the Muslim side. The 
events of the past few days show that the danger of the 
internationalization and creeping proliferation of the military 
conflict in the Balkans is increasing constantly. [passage 
omitted] 
  The only way out of the Bosnian confrontation is peace 
talks, 
to which the Bosnian Serb leaders have long been urging the 
Muslims and their U.S. and NATO protectors. 
  The NATO order to bomb the Serbian positions was given 
immediately after a telephone conversation between U.S. 
Secretary of State Christopher and Russian Foreign Minister 
Kozyrev, who then immediately flew to Belgrade where he held 
talks that night with Serbian President Milosevic. 
  It does not seem, however, that even after that any 
fundamentally new emphasis appeared in Russian diplomacy's 
bipartite and ambiguous stance, which effectively encouraged the 
air attacks. Russia is continuing to refrain from using its 
right of veto to halt the aggression against the Serbs and 
achieve the lifting of what are essentially genocidal economic 
sanctions imposed on Yugoslavia. The appeal to urgently convene 
an extraordinary session of the Security Council has been left 
in midair. [passage omitted] 
  After the "slap in the face for Russia's prestige" (to use 
Sergey Shakhray's well-known emotional verdict), Moscow is 
apparently still ready to turn the other cheek for further 
encouragement for the United States and NATO in the same vein!..

  [Text] The special session of the Sevastopol City Council 
Tuesday took a decision to propose to the Ukrainian leadership 
to re-deploy the staff and other facilities of the Ukrainian 
Navy from Sevastopol to another place. The session also decided 
to consider reasonable the decision by the presidents of Russia 
and Ukraine to the effect that further joint basing of two 
fleets in Sevastopol was impossible. 
  The Sevastopol City Council is soon to make a request to the 
new Ukrainian parliament and the Russian Federal Assembly to 
urgently help solve, in line with the Massandra 
Russian-Ukrainian protocol, the problem of the Black Sea Fleet. 
  The city council proposed that the presidents of Ukraine and 
Russia invite a delegation from Sevastopol and the Crimea for 
the bilateral talks on the Black Sea Fleet scheduled for April 
24. 
  The session adopted an address to the peoples of Ukraine and 
Russia, which says that the Black Sea Fleet will be Russian and 
will be based in Sevastopol. 
  The resolution says that the conflicts between the Black Sea 
Fleet and the Ukrainian Navy have become constant. Since the 
matter went as far as to threats to use force, says the 
document, the residents of Sevastopol, the inhabitants of the 
Crimea and of other places where units of the Black Sea Fleet 
and of the Ukrainian Navy are stationed cannot feel safe. 
  The session denounced the confrontation within the fleet, 
caused as deputies believe, by a lack of resoluteness and 
consistency on the part of Ukrainian and Russian leaders. 
  The city council urged the Russian and Ukrainian peoples to 
launch a public movement for the early implementation of the 
Russian-Ukrainian agreements on the Black Sea Fleet. 
  Meanwhile, Nikolay Savchenko, leader of the Ukrainian Navy 
press center, told Interfax that the decision on basing the 
Ukrainian naval force in Sevastopol was outside the competence 
of the city council. He said that a relevant statement by the 
Ukrainian naval command could appear shortly.

<F P=106> [Feature comprising leaked document attributed to </F>
"`Russia-Ukraine-Crimea' independent expert group," plus 
comments from Ukrainian Embassy counselor, "independent 
consultant" Oleg Rumyantsev, Russian Foreign Ministry, and 
Russian intelligence officer: "`Likely' Plans of Unlikely 
Adversary"] 
  [Text] The document that has come into the possession of 
the editorial office is bound to evoke contradictory comment. 
Is it a forgery? Another attempt to sound out public opinion? 
A practical joke? 
  The latest sensational leak -- everyone is still talking 
about the scandal over the notorious "Theory No. 1" -- may well 
prove to be a canard. But the situation in the 
Russia-Ukraine-Crimea "triangle" is too serious for us to ignore 
the confidential document we have received. 
  About a year ago the Ukrainian Defense Ministry elaborated 
plans for landing Ukrainian troops in the Kuban and the Don 
which are to be implemented "in the event of an exacerbation or 
destabilization of the situation in Russia and a deterioration 
in relations between Kiev and Moscow to a critical point." 
  Back then the Ukrainian leadership began to take measures to 
create arms systems designed for mass destruction. In 
particular, the Pavlograd chemical plant was set the task of 
organizing the production of more efficient missile fuel on the 
basis of technological documentation obtained from Russia's 
"Soyuz" Production Association. At the same time the Yuzhmash 
plant has been developing production of tactical missiles, an 
experimental batch of which was to be produced in the first 
quarter of 1994. 
  A number of chemical and biological institutes received 
additional funding and instructions to step up work to develop 
binary chemical and bacteriological weapons. The Cybernetics 
Institute (Kiev) and the "Monolit" MPO [expansion unknown] 
(Kharkov) began work to study the possibility of recoding the 
guidance system of the strategic missiles stationed in Ukraine. 
  In December 1993, concerned at the situation in 
Russian-speaking areas of Ukraine, Kravchuk instructed the Kiev 
Psychology Institute to carry out secret sociological studies in 
the Donbass, Odessa, Nikolayev, Kherson, Kharkov Oblast, and the 
Crimea, which established that between 50 and 80 percent of the 
population of these regions advocates unification with Russia or 
a transfer to its jurisdiction. This prompted the start of the 
personnel reshuffle among the leadership of power [silovoy] 
structures and the stepping up of work to staff them according 
to ethnic and nationalist principles. In west Ukraine, 
particularly in Lvov, paramilitary camps and volunteer militia 
detachments began to be set up under the control of the local 
security services; according to certain of their members, they 
are being readied in order to "smash the Muscovites soon" (the 
reference is to pro-Russian citizens of Ukraine). 
  At the same time Kravchuk and his team attempted via the 
pro-Ukrainian lobby in the U.S. Congress to secure support for 
their position regarding Russia, as a result of which they 
received assurances and approval from Washington for vigorous 
action with respect to Russia, the Black Sea Fleet, and 
especially Crimea and Ukraine's Russian-speaking population. 
During his U.S. visit in March 1994 Kravchuk allegedly received 
confirmation of this. 
  In late March 1994 the upper echelons of power and 
Ukraine's power structures actively worked on former Crimean 
Supreme Council Chairman Bagrov to get him to agree to lead the 
pro-Ukrainian nationalist movement in the republic in opposition 
to the Crimean president. 
  Meanwhile the movement of firearms and other weapons to 
Crimea, intended primarily for the Crimean Tatars living on the 
peninsula, from Chechnya was begun via structures in opposition 
to the republic's president and taking part in deliveries of oil 
and petroleum products to Crimea. 
  On 23-24 March 1994 Ukraine's security organs received 
instructions whereby Crimea and the Black Sea Fleet stationed in 
Sevastopol were categorized as prime targets of intelligence and 
counterintelligence interest. In view of this they were set the 
task of carrying out operational monitoring of the political 
situation in the region, setting up contacts with the opposition 
to the Crimean president and total monitoring of the command and 
personnel of the Black Sea Fleet, and forming in Crimea, 
especially in Sevastopol, operational combat groups made up of 
pro-Ukrainian, opposition, and nationalist elements. 
  The ultimate aim of all these actions is to declare a state 
of emergency on the peninsula, introduce direct presidential 
rule by the Ukrainian president in Crimea, and declare the 
extraterritoriality of the Black Sea Fleet and then make demands 
for the withdrawal of the Russian troops. At the same time it 
is believed in Kravchuk's immediate entourage that the Black Sea 
Fleet problem should be solved through its simple forcible 
seizure by the Ukrainian Armed Forces. 
  The most "convenient" and likely pretext for starting to 
implement this plan may most likely be the staging of a 
provocation in Crimea during the holding of the "nationwide 
poll," resulting in mass disturbances providing legitimate 
grounds for an "appropriate" reaction by Kiev. 
  As a result of an assessment of the development of the 
economic and political situation in Russia, Ukraine, and Crimea 
the U.S. National Security Council concluded that the 
preconditions had emerged for the formation of another "trouble 
spot" in the CIS capable of destabilizing the situation in the 
Black Sea region. 
  On the basis of this, they worked out the following as one 
of 
the most probable scenarios for the development of events in the 
region favorable to transnational companies: 
  Subjective factors will not make it possible to begin normal 
dialogue between Russia, Ukraine, and Crimea. In these 
conditions Crimea independently holds a referendum and announces 
its secession from Ukraine. Ukraine declares a state of 
emergency in Crimea and moves in its troops. Then a clash 
begins between Ukrainian troops and pro-Russian movements in 
Crimea, and the troops of the Black Sea Fleet are inevitably 
drawn into the conflict. Russia is forced to intervene 
vigorously in the process, as a result of which the two states 
become involved in a military conflict. 
  It is very noteworthy that the Americans are currently 
taking 
specific steps to secretly evacuate members of the families of 
embassy officials from Russia by May and to introduce 
restrictions on travel both to Russia and on the territory of 
Russia by U.S. citizens. 
  [Signed] "Russia-Ukraine-Crimea" independent expert group 
  [Dated] 15 April 1994 
<H5>  Ukrainian Embassy's Reaction </H5>
  Vadim Dolganov, counselor at the Ukrainian Embassy to 
Russia: 
  Neither the embassy nor any other official Ukrainian organs 
are going to comment on this document. This is all nonsense. 
But it is rather dangerous. What is assembled here can be 
gleaned from the Russian mass news media. 
  I myself come from Kharkov. The document says that between 
50 and 80 percent of the oblast's residents advocate 
reunification with Russia. That is nonsense! It is simply 
impossible to comment on it. But, once again, this nonsense is 
tendentious. That is, you can discern a clear attempt to drive 
a wedge between eastern and western oblasts of Ukraine, which 
are indeed different in their ethnic composition, and to play 
the "Crimea card." But, you know, the problem is that the 
people who are staging this whole thing fail to understand a 
simple thing, or maybe they do understand it -- you could swap 
Ukraine and Russia around in these dirty documents. And you 
could say the same thing about Russia. 
  What is most terrible is that such material is appearing at 
a 
time when the Ukrainian and Russian leaders are beginning to 
reach agreement on some complex problems. 
  Consultant's Viewpoint 
  Oleg Rumyantsev, president of the Russian Foundation for 
Constitutional Reforms and independent consultant on Crimea: 
  It is difficult to say that this document is totally 
accurate. However, when I was executive secretary of the 
Constitutional Commission I traveled to Crimea at the invitation 
of a number of public associations to find out the attitude 
taken by Crimea's residents to the draft Russian Constitution 
and the prospect of restoring our unity (August 1993). At that 
time I received from extremely well informed sources data 
partially reminiscent of this. 
<H5>  Russian Foreign Ministry's Opinion </H5>
  We were told in confidence by the Russian Federation Foreign 
Ministry that no information that Kiev is working on tactical 
missiles or binary weapons has been officially received by 
Moscow. 
<H5>  Special Services' Commentary </H5>
  We learned from a confidential conversation with a senior 
officer of Russia's intelligence organs that they very carefully 
studied the U.S. CIA's secret report to President Clinton 
regarding the situation in Ukraine. This report fell into the 
hands of the British press by unknown means. Some of its theses 
chime with the text of the document published today. 
  Representatives of Russian intelligence services displayed 
particular interest in those passages in the CIA report 
analyzing Ukraine's economic position and concluding that, if 
the present rate of development of the crisis is maintained, the 
republic may split up within two years, leading to the emergence 
of several new state formations which will possess nuclear 
weapons. On the whole, the source noted, the U.S. intelligence 
agency's conclusions largely coincide with the Russian experts' 
assessments. Moreover, it was learned recently that Ukrainian 
military specialists are attempting to decipher the launch codes 
of intercontinental missiles. 
  The source also added that he agrees with the U.S. report's 
conclusions regarding the possibility of a social explosion in 
Ukraine. Clashes between the Russian-speaking population of 
eastern oblasts and the west Ukrainians cannot be ruled out 
here. The source believes that Russia should relax the economic 
pressure on Kiev and be more flexible in its approach to the 
problems of Crimea and the Black Sea Fleet.

  [Text] Preparations for the ratification of the START-2 
treaty signed on January 3 will be the focus of a meeting 
between a number of committees of the Russian State Duma and two 
U.S. senators, Sam Nunn and Richard Lugar, coming to Moscow in 
mid-May, the defense committee chairperson, Sergey Yushenkov, 
told a State Duma session Tuesday. 
  The session was told that the ratification of START-2 should 
follow the enacting of its predecessor, START-1, signed on July 
31 1991. 
  Despite the fact that the treaty has already been ratified 
by 
Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan since the break-up of 
the Soviet Union, it will come into force only after the 
exchange of ratification letters with the USA. The session was 
told that the process is hindered by Ukraine where "political 
struggle for this or that status as a nuclear state is going 
on," according to the head of the disarmament department of the 
Russian Foreign Ministry, Oleg Sokolov. 
  As many as 3,800-4,250 nuclear ammo will be destroyed during 
the first stage of the START-2 treaty's implementation, which 
will last for seven years -- the same as the START-1 treaty. 
Another 3,000- 3,500 items of nuclear ammunition will be 
destroyed during the second stage which will last until 2003.

  [Text] The U.S. Chamber of Trade and Commerce [USCTC] in 
Russia, uniting about 180 companies has recommended its members 
to refrain from lending credit to juridical persons in Russia, 
head of the USCTC Investment Committee George Reese said 
speaking in Moscow on Tuesday. 
  He said that a number of Russian government officials were 
informed about the move following the misinterpretation of 
President Yeltsin's decree of last December by some members of 
the Russian taxation bodies. They appear to interpret the 
decree as a cancellation of a provision of the law on the value 
added tax whereby credits are exempt from VAT. This enables tax 
collectors to levy a 23 percent tax on foreign credits to 
Russian juridical persons which is unacceptable to their foreign 
partners, Reese said. 
  U.S. company officials taking part in a news conference 
described the situation as extreme and demanded immediate 
clarifications from the Russian government. Until then, we will 
refrain from any investment here, member of the USCTC Board of 
Directors Larry Anderson said. 
  For his part, Reese said that granting loans in conditions 
of 
such commercial uncertainty were fraught with dire implications 
for U.S. companies. A refusal to provide credits will restrict 
the flow of much-sought investment in the Russian economy, he 
said.

  [Text] Moscow April 19 TASS -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin received visiting Palestinian president and PLO leader 
Yasir 'Arafat here today to discuss the mideastern situation, 
the state and prospects for the Arab-Israeli settlement and ways 
to develop the Russian-Palestinian cooperation. 
  Comprehensive and just peace in the Middle East remains a 
Russian strategic priority in the region vitally important for 
Russia, said the president. 
  Boris Yeltsin is satisfied with the on-going 
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations to overcome confrontation and 
build a solid peace infrastructure despite all the difficulties. 
He reaffirmed the Russian firm intention as a co-sponsor of the 
mideastern peace process to render comprehensive assistance to 
further progress at Arab-Israeli negotiations. 
  In his turn, Yasir 'Arafat praised Russian contribution to 
the mideastern peace process and achievement of positive results 
in the Arab-Israeli dialogue. In his opinion, Russian 
diplomatic efforts has played a considerable role in settlement 
of difficulties resulting from the February tragedy in Hebron, 
as well as in the implementation of measures to consolidate 
Palestinian security in fulfilment of the U.N. Security 
Council's Resolution 904. 
  The PLO leader thanked Russia for its intention to help 
Palestinians in the organization of self-government in the Gaza 
Strip and the Jericho area. 
  The sides stressed their striving to consolidate historical 
relations between Russia and the Arab people of Palestine, the 
presidential press service reports.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Sergey Babkin and </F>
Yuriy Tyssovskiy] 
  [Excerpts] Moscow, 19 Apr -- Russian Foreign Affairs 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev today paid tribute to Yasir 'Arafat, 
president of the state of Palestine and chairman of the PLO 
Executive Committee, for the responsibility and courage he has 
shown to establish peace in the Near East. At a news 
conference, he summed up the results of the talks which have 
taken place with the Palestinian side at the Foreign Ministry's 
residence. These talks covered a wide range of issues connected 
with a Near East settlement and bilateral relations. 
  The head of the Russian Foreign Ministry said that at the 
talks in Moscow the sides continued the Palestinian-Russian 
dialogue which has been going on for several years now and which 
was given powerful impetus as a result of President Boris 
Yeltsin's initiative. This initiative was discussed by the 
sides in Tunis, where a "bold and fundamental" political 
decision was made to return to the negotiating table in spite of 
existing difficulties. "Today we discussed those difficulties, 
we know about them, and we are determined to eliminate all 
obstacles to a comprehensive settlement," the minister stressed. 
He assured Y. 'Arafat of Russian support for the PLO's policy 
of opposing extremists, and noted that the heads of state of 
Palestine and Russia are in constant contact through the Russian 
president's special envoy Viktor Posuvalyuk via a regular 
exchange of messages. 
  Y. 'Arafat described his visit to Moscow as especially 
important given the difficult circumstances under which it is 
taking place. He said: "A double historical, political, and 
moral responsibility for the situation in the region rests on 
Mr. Kozyrev, since it was he and U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher who countersigned the Palestinian-Israeli 
agreement." Y. 'Arafat said that today he discussed with the 
head of the Russian Foreign Ministry ways of overcoming those 
obstacles which are preventing the implementation of the 
Palestinian-Israeli "Gaza-Jericho, First" agreement, and namely 
those "delays and maneuvers" to which the Israeli side is 
resorting. "I reminded the minister that the deadline under the 
agreement for the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the 
territories coming under Palestinian autonomy expired on 13 
April. In spite of this, nothing has changed on the ground," 
the PLO leader said. 
  "All of this will lead to time being lost and will allow 
those forces which oppose the agreement to close ranks and 
mobilize their actions against the establishment of peace in the 
region." He warned that the only alternative to peace is 
anarchy and "Balkanization" of the region. [passage omitted] 
  After the talks, the sides signed a Russo-Palestinian 
agreement on the prospects for bilateral cooperation in 
politics, economics, and culture. 
  Earlier today, the Palestinian head of the state laid a 
wreath at the tomb of the unknown soldier, and held talks with 
Russian State Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin and Russian Interior 
Minister Viktor Yerin.

<F P=106> [Interview with PLO Executive Committee Chairman Yasir </F>
'Arafat by unidentified correspondent in Moscow on 19 April; 
'Arafat speaks in English throughout with superimposed Russian 
translation -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] Mr. Chairman, what are the results 
of your conversations with the Russian leaders? 
  ['Arafat] I am glad that I have had constructive and 
fruitful 
meetings and conversations with his excellency, President 
Yeltsin, and Mr. Kozyrev, with the interior minister, and the 
Duma speaker. After this, a fruitful and warm meeting took place 
with his Holiness, Patriarch Aleksiy II. 
  In all of these meetings, particularly with President 
Yeltsin, we spoke frankly about the situation we are faced with 
and on how to give renewed impetus to the peace process. We 
also spoke about the obstacles that have sprung up and how to 
overcome them with Russia's help. For your country is one of 
the co-chairmen of the Madrid conference. You and the United 
States are its co-sponsors, and, as you know, Mr. Kozyrev, along 
with Mr. Christopher, appended his signature to the agreement 
between the Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel. The 
United States and Russia have a political and moral 
responsibility. 
  For our part we are completely satisfied with the assurances 
that we have received from President Yeltsin. For he informed 
us that he is fully involved in the peace process in the region 
and is striving to achieve a real and universal peace there, 
particularly between the Palestinians and Israelis. 
  [Correspondent] However, by 13 April peace had not been 
established. The agreements that have been signed are not being 
fulfilled. What do you think about the situation? What are the 
conditions for the renewal of the negotiating process? 
  ['Arafat] Unfortunately, I am forced to say that the 
fulfillment of the fall Washington accords have been thwarted 
and postponed because of the Israelis' maneuvers. You must 
remember what the prime ministers stressed about dates and 
borders. Here are the results: 13 December passed by, 13 April 
passed by. No specific results have been achieved, on the spot. 
We do not have the results that could have moved the whole 
peace process forward. We are in a real impasse. We are trying 
now -- talks on this matter have taken place in Cairo and Paris, 
we have tried to find solutions in order to overcome such 
obstacles. 
  For my part, I cannot give any assurances, no guarantees, 
because everything depends on the Israelis. Their authorities 
are wasting time for no purpose. They are trying to avoid 
fulfilling what was already agreed in Washington, agreed 
honestly, precisely, clearly, and in writing. Why, in my view, 
are there such delays? Everyone ought to know about this. 
Because the American administration gave to Israel -- it even 
sold peace earlier even than before the fulfillment of the 
Washington agreements. It supplied Israel with more armaments 
and the most up-to-date combat equipment; $10 billion of loans 
and credits; a huge powerful computer. It would seem that 
Israel obtained everything it wanted even before the 
implementation of the agreement. But we Palestinians paid for 
this, paid the price of peace, before the fulfillment of 
commitments by the other side. But we do not have this peace. 
Look, we still do not have our own state territory. One side 
has obtained everything, and the other -- the Palestinian -- has 
paid for this. As you can see, the delay in the deadline for 
the implementation of the agreement has given the chance to 
extremists from both sides. They have started to organize 
themselves and to act against peace. This is the result and 
this is how we have turned out. 
  I have to say, unfortunately, that the peace process has 
lost 
its credibility. Faith in it has been lost since this breakdown 
over the time-scale of the implementation of the accord. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. President, I recall your speech in 
Strasbourg at the Council of Europe to the parliamentarians of 
32 countries. You spoke about a ruined economy and 
infrastructure. How do you hope to reconstruct and rebuild it, 
to renew it, and to give it a new boost? 
  ['Arafat] But here I should disappoint the Russian people: 
Our infrastructure has been completely destroyed as a 
consequence of the Israeli occupation. As I have mentioned 
during my meetings with the EC ministers -- and I met them too, 
I said to them: Some of you occupied the Latin American, 
African, Asian countries and conquered their peoples at some 
time in the past. You were leaving behind states with ready 
infrastructure: Railway stations, radio, ports, airports, 
roads, clinics. But the Israelis have destroyed everything 
themselves and we, the Palestinians, have to begin from scratch. 
What sort of future do we face? It can either be something 
resembling the tragedy of Somalia -- the people in the Gaza 
strip are already threatened by hunger -- or we can grow into 
one of the economic tigers -- such as Singapore, for example. We 
have the necessary conditions and talents for this. As you 
know, the percentage of educated people among the Palestinians 
is the highest in the Middle East. Even higher than in Israel. 
But we need help from friends and brothers, as well as help and 
assistance from the international community. This is one of the 
issues I discussed here in Moscow. We have also discussed 
questions of economic relations. 
  [Correspondent] You are the first Arab leader visiting the 
new Russia. Pointing to this, I should like to note that there 
is great potential and many unused possibilities that still 
exist in our bilateral Russian-Palestinian relations as well as 
in Russian-Arab relations as a whole. How do you see the 
prospects for economic, cultural, and scientific relations? 
  ['Arafat] This is not the only thing that links us. In the 
first place we are neighbors. That is extremely important. I 
am sure that by ensuring the coordination at all levels, which 
we really need, we can achieve a lot. I hope that we can 
achieve coordination on all of these problems, not only in 
politics but also in economics, education, and the development 
of agriculture. 
  I would particularly like to speak about an important sphere 
of Russian-Palestinian cooperation that I discussed with 
President Yeltsin and His Holiness Aleksiy II -- about Russia's 
links with Jerusalem, about spiritual and religious links. 
These are the centuries-old links between the Orthodox Church 
and the holy places. I think that they will acquire a second 
wind. In short, we are in favor of cooperation in all spheres 
and by all means. 
  [Correspondent] Many thanks for your answers.

Yuriy Tyssovskiy] 
  [Text] Moscow April 20 TASS -- President of Palestine and 
chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation Yasir 'Arafat 
has expressed on behalf of the Palestinian people deep gratitude 
to the president, government and people of Russia for their 
consistent friendly position with respect to the just cause of 
the Palestinian people. 
  He was speaking on Wednesday at a press conference for 
Russian and foreign journalists at the close of his working 
visit to the Russian capital. Yasir 'Arafat said he appreciated 
the fact that was the first leader of an Arab nation to be 
invited for a visit to the Russian Federation after radical 
changes in this country. 
  Speaking about the results of his visit, 'Arafat said they 
were important and constructive. During his meetings with the 
Russian president, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and 
other officials 'Arafat discussed the most important problems of 
the Middle East region. In this context he stressed that the 
Middle East is for Russia not only a point on the map but 
actually a neighbouring region which really exists. 
  'Arafat said high-ranking Palestinian officials would soon 
arrive in Moscow to discuss the development of bilateral 
economic ties. 
  As concerns Palestinian-Israeli negotiations on the 
procedure 
of implementing the Gaza-Jericho agreement, the Palestinian 
leader noted that they are continuing, although not always as 
smoothly as desired and not always in the sought direction. 
  According to 'Arafat, Israel is constantly manoeuvering and 
playing for time. The Israeli troops were due to withdraw from 
the areas of the planned Palestinian autonomy but did not. 
  "All attempts of our friends to stimulate the peace process 
have failed," 'Arafat stressed. "Despite negotiations and 
accords, the situation remains as it was". 
  According to him, this trend is seen as favorable only by 
the 
extremists on both sides who want to disrupt the settlement 
process. "If no headway is made along the path leading to peace, 
the region will be engulfed by anarchy and Balkanisation," the 
PLO leader said. 
  He formulated the PLO demands to the Israeli leadership -- 
to 
speed up the exact and guaranteed fulfilment of the reached 
agreements. Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin likes 
repeating that there are no sacred datelines, but there must 
exist commitments which must be realized without delay, 'Arafat 
said.

  [Excerpt] Moscow, April 20 (AFP) -- PLO chief Yasir 'Arafat 
called here Wednesday [20 April] for Russian leaders to press 
Israel "not to waste time" in launching Palestinian self-rule 
when they meet Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin next week. 
  'Arafat, at the end of a two-day visit, said that continued 
"manoeuvering and marking time" by Israel in concluding the 
Israeli-PLO autonomy deal would only "give a chance to all 
extremist elements on both sides to undermine the peace process." 
  "The 13th of April, the final day to finalize the Israeli 
withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho passed and nothing concrete 
happened," he said during a press conference before his 
departure. 
  He added that Israel "must bear responsibility in all 
events" 
and accused Rabin of stalling the peace negotiations on purpose. 
  "Rabin is not in a hurry because he has received from 
America 
the price of peace: all kinds of armaments, state of the art, 
including 25 airplanes, the hugest and very sophisticated 
computers, a garantee for a 10-million-dollar credit, all kinds 
of financial, economic, political and diplomatic help," he said. 
  "This had been achieved before the implementation of the 
accord." 
  'Arafat called for Russia as a co-sponsor of the Middle East 
peace process along with the United States to press the Israeli 
prime minister, when he visits Moscow next week, "not to waste 
time." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Washington April 20 TASS -- "We believe that Russia, 
as co-chairman of the Madrid process, is playing a most 
important role in the peace-making efforts in the Middle East 
and in the endeavours to settle the Palestinian problem fairly," 
ITAR-TASS was told by assistant director of the Palestinian 
centre in Washington Sa'id Hamid. "This explains the importance 
of the Moscow meeting between Chairman of the PLO Executive 
Committee Yasir 'Arafat and Russian President Boris Yeltsin," he 
added" 
  The Palestinian representative said the meeting was 
"exceptionally important". In his opinion, it was a logical 
continuation of the consistent efforts lately exerted by the 
Russian diplomacy in the Middle East. Moscow has always 
expressed concern over the situation in the region and has done 
its best to achieve stability there. 
  "We are thankful to Russia for its understanding of our 
concerns and anxieties, understanding of the legality of our 
rights for which we are striving. We are thankful to it for its 
good offices, which it is ready to offer us," Hamid stressed. 
He expressed the hope that the Russian president would use his 
influence to convince Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin during the 
latter's forthcoming trip to Moscow that Israel should fulfil 
the terms of the agreement on the settlement principles, signed 
by the PLO and Israel in Washington last September. "The 
principle of Palestinian self-government will remain a dead 
letter as long as the Israeli troops remain on the occupied 
territories," Hamid stated.

  [Text] Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis has received an 
invitation from Russian president Yeltsin to arrive in Moscow on 
April 21 for a working visit. 
  He said that President Yeltsin had expressed a desire that 
the two sides sign a package of agreements on conditions for the 
Russian troop pull-out, which was initialed on March 15. 
  Interfax was told by a spokesman for the Latvian president 
that Ulmanis promised to give a reply on Tuesday night. 
  The spokesman said that speaking with an ambassador Ulmanis 
had said that on April 20 the Latvian parliament will take a 
decision on the possibility of the signing of the package of 
agreements. He said, however, that despite parliament's 
decision the meeting between the Russian and Latvian presidents 
would be expedient. 
  President Ulmanis said that there are problems in the 
Russian-Latvian relations which should be clarified, including 
in relation to the Russian president's decision of April 5 which 
provides for the creation of a military base in Latvia. The 
emergence of the document caused a wave of criticisms in the 
Baltic countries and the Ulmanis said that his visit to Moscow, 
earlier planned for April 20, would be postponed for an 
indefinite period.

the case."

  [Text] Moscow April 19 TASS -- The renewed escalation of 
bloodshed around Nagorno-Karabakh is causing serious concern, 
deputy chief of the Russian Foreign Ministry Department of 
Information and Press Mikhail Demurin said at a briefing today. 
  According to the official, the Russian Foreign Ministry, 
acting as a mediator, rejects attempts made by the conflicting 
sides, in the given case the Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh, to 
extend and consolidify [as received] their positions when the 
situation has long since taken a turn towards peace. 
  Recent attacks in the north of Nagorno-Karabakh are being 
negatively reflected on the prospects of negotiations, Mikhail 
Demurin noted.

  [Text] Moscow, April 19, IRNA -- Russian Energy Minister 
Yuriy Shafranik has called for expansion of Tehran-Moscow 
cooperation in areas of oil and gas. 
  Speaking to IRNA at the opening ceremony of an international 
oil and gas exhibition, Shafranik termed the exhibition as a 
short step taken towards cooperation with oil-rich countries and 
industrialized world. Shafranik said he was willing to discuss 
oil and gas cooperation between Iran and Russia with an Iranian 
delegation currently participating in the exhibition. 
  In his recent talks with Iranian Oil Minister Gholam Reza 
Aqazadeh in Ashgabat, the need for mutual ties in the said 
fields were stressed, the Russian minister noted. 
  The prospect for promotion of cooperation between the two 
countries depends on Iran's interest in the issue, the Russian 
minister said. 
  Iran's pavilion at the exhibition covers an area of 60 
square 
meters in which pictures of Iranian oil and gas facilities and 
those of operations regarding capping of blazing oil fields and 
laying pipe lines by Iranian experts are put on display. 
  Over 200 government and non-governmental companies from 30 
countries are present at the exhibit.

  [Text] Moscow April 20 TASS -- "Relations between Albania 
and Russia are being developed on the new principles of 
partnership, cooperation and mutual advantage. They take into 
account the specific features of the Russian Federation as 
successor of the former USSR, as a state with a huge economic 
and intellectual potential, as permanent member of the U.N. 
Security Council," Albanian Ambassador to the Russian Federation 
Arbet Cici told ITAR-TASS. 
  These are the principles," he said, "on which Albania bases 
its relations with other states in the interests of the region. 
They rule out political and ideological servility, which had 
sometimes existed in the past". 
  "During the past three years," the diplomat noted, "the new 
Albanian-Russian relations were backed up by a consular 
agreement on mutual trips, by agreements on air traffic and 
automobile service, on public health and the environment, as 
well as other inter-departmental agreements in the sphere of 
education, culture, and the arts. 
  Agreements on the protection of investments, avoidance of 
double taxation, cooperation in the sphere of education, 
culture, science and technology, as well as a consular 
convention and several other documents are ready to be signed. 
  "The laid beginning appears to be promising and is expected 
to open up promising vistas for cooperation between our two 
countries," the ambassador said.

  [Text] Moscow April 20 TASS -- Albania insists that a 
solution of the Kosovo question should become a component part 
of an all-round settlement of the Yugoslav crisis, Albanian 
Ambassador to Russia Arben Cici said in an exclusive interview 
with ITAR-TASS here on Wednesday. 
  "We believe that the most efficient means to achieve this 
goal is to link up the lifting of sanctions against Serbia with 
an understanding between Belgrade and the Kosovo legitimate 
leaders on a status of that territory," he noted. 
  Kosovo, the diplomat stressed, is a component part of the 
Yugoslav crisis, harbouring a real danger of a new eruption of 
the conflict. 
  A solution of the problem of ethnic Albanians making up 90 
per cent of that territory's population and experiencing 
pressure from Serbs, is a must to achieve a lasting and final 
peace on the Balkans. 
  Albania is situated next the the conflict zone, Cici 
continued. Therefore, it is interested in establishing peace and 
stability in the region as soon as possible. Efforts of 
Albanian diplomacy are aimed at this goal. Mindful of this, we 
welcome any initiative or action, no matter wherefrom it comes. 
  The only condition is that these actions should stop war, 
establish a lasting and stable peace and lead to a just 
political settlement of the crisis. 
  Albania has always offered assistance and sincere 
cooperation 
to international organisations and states who have friends, 
influence and interests on the Balkans and who will assume an 
unbiased obligation for a just settlement of the conflict and 
prevention of its proliferation. 
  Their role and responsibility in this respect are 
invaluable. 
Russian diplomacy has peculiar features and advantages 
permitting it to play an important role in the Balkan region, 
the Albanian ambassador stressed.

  [Text] The chairman of the Central Bank of Russia (CBR), 
Viktor Gerashchenko, has called on the European Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) to boost credits to purely 
Russian enterprises rather than joint ventures with 
participation of western companies. Speaking at the closing 
ceremony of an annual meeting of the EBRD board in St. 
Petersburg Tuesday, Gerashchenko pointed out that quite a number 
of reliable companies capable of maintaining civilized relations 
with the bank had appeared in Russia. He highly praised the 
EBRD's efforts in assisting Russia's small businesses and 
supposed that its dialog with Russian business would be even 
more productive, if carried out through the CBR. 
  Commenting on the EBRD's activities last year, Gerashchenko 
noted that the amount of credits actually used for Russian 
projects had increased by more than 10 times and reached $120 Mn 
[million]. In his opinion, the EBRD board of directors might 
function as the coordinator of various states' efforts for the 
support of Russian reforms. 
  EBRD President Jacques de Larosiere pointed out that this 
body would use a more flexible approach to its relations with 
East and Central European countries and pay more attention to 
their small and medium-sized businesses.

  [Text] The European Bank of Reconstruction and Development 
confirms its priorities in the sphere of developing private 
property and support for small and medium-size businesses, 
President of the Bank Jacques de Larosiere said at a press 
conference. He noted that the important sphere is the 
development of infrastructure, the effective development of the 
energy industry and further growth of expenditure to ensure 
nuclear safety. 
  So far, expenditure in this field have been approved in 
Lithuania and Bulgaria. Besides, three accounts in the same 
sphere are being formulated in Russia, the president said. 
  He also said that during meetings in St. Petersburg three 
agreements on co-financing had been signed. In particular, the 
Japanese Export-Import Bank had granted a credit worth 100 
million dollars to the Baltic states. 
  Among the initiatives the EBRD president noted the proposal 
by managers from Finland, Norway and Sweden to set up a venture 
fund for northwestern Russia. The fund is designed for 
post-privatization support of small enterprises in the region. 
  According to the president, a German representative 
announced 
plans to set up a regional venture fund in St. Petersburg, which 
would be co-sponsored by the Center of Technical Support of 
Germany. The president also noted the agreements signed recently 
between Belarus and the EBRD about the reconstruction of the 
Moscow-Minsk-Warsaw-Berlin highway. 
  With the participation of the Russian prime minister the 
EBRD 
signed on April 17 its first aerospace project. Finally a 
project on the creation of a modern office building in St. 
Petersburg was signed, which will be the first investment 
project of the EBRD in the city. 
  In conclusion the president of the bank pointed out that the 
choice of Russia as the country for holding meetings of the bank 
is not a coincidence, because "the Russian Federation is the 
main country for our operations."

  [Text] St. Petersburg April 19 TASS -- The third annual 
meeting of the board of the European Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development has ended in St. Petersburg after being attended by 
representatives of 59 states and international 
organizations-bank shareholders. 
  The bank managers approved bank activities of 1993 and set 
future priorities. 
  Bank President Jacques de Larosiere told the final news 
conference he is satisfied with the meeting results. The bank's 
adherence to the development of the private sector was 
unanimously supported. Special attention will be paid to the 
assistance to small and medium ventures. Bank-supported 
projects to help private businesses will be a major sphere of 
the bank activities. 
  The bank board has decided to expand its activities in all 
the 25 post-communist nations in 1994. Each of them will have 
at least one project. At the same time, Russia will remain the 
major area of bank operations, said de Larosiere. 
  Bank credits issued to the Russian Federation increased 
tenfold in 1993. Russia counts for over 20 projects worth of 
1.5 billion ECU [European currency units] from out of the bank's 
150 investment projects worth of 3.5 billion ecu. The actual 
sum of the credit use is so far 120 million U.S. dollars. 
  Financing of environmental protection projects remains a 
priority area of the bank's activities. The bank head noted 
they will pay more attention to safety of nuclear reactors and 
have reached an agreement on additional allocations for reactor 
upgrading projects. Three Russian projects of the kind are being 
discussed. 
  Another important result of the bank board meeting is the 
decision to help central and east European plants to enter world 
markets. Free goods exports is an obligatory condition for 
their transition to the market economy, stressed de Larosiere. 
  The bank's 1993 successes, expanded activities and more 
complicated tasks have raised the question of increased funds, 
which are amounting to ten billion ecu in accordance with the 
bank rules. 
  In the words of de Larosiere, corresponding proposals will 
be 
prepared by the bank leadership by the fourth annual meeting of 
the bank board to be held on April 10-11, 1995, in London.

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: Reports by </F>
Diplomatic Correspondents Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy, and 
others] 
  [Text] The Korean Peninsula is the only hot spot in Asia 
and the Pacific which may seriously destabilize the situation in 
and outside this region. Given this, talks with the South 
Korean President Kim Yong-sam in Moscow on June 1 to 4 will deal 
with ways of easing tensions in the Korean Peninsula and with 
South Korean-Russian relations, Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister 
Aleksandr Panov told INTERFAX on Tuesday. 
  He believes that the South Korean president's visit to 
Moscow 
provides "one more proof of our stable and broadening 
relations." "We hope that the forthcoming visit will give a 
fresh impetus to them," he said. 
  To quote Panov, relations between Moscow and Seoul develop 
normally and have no unsurmountable barriers, which can be 
judged from a 40 percent increase in bilateral trade last year. 
  Panov emphasized that Russia's initiative on the convocation 
of an international conference on the Korean Peninsula remained 
in force. "This idea has not been rejected by anyone, although 
most of our partners give preference to bilateral talks," he 
said. 
  He told INTERFAX that Russia had already held consultations 
with China, Japan and other parties concerned. "No one has 
removed this idea from the agenda. Moreover, everyone thinks 
that at a certain stage it may become rather efficient. We 
don't think that bilateral talks, the way they have been 
conducted until now, hold any promise. They are not making any 
progress and only complicate the situation each time they find 
themselves in a deadlock," said Panov. 
  He announced that Russia would like the People's Democratic 
Republic of Korea to adhere to the treaty on the 
nonproliferation of nuclear weapons. On the other hand, we 
think that it is high time that all the parties concerned worked 
out a single policy instead of holding consultations on the 
Korean problem, he continued. A balance of interests must be 
found, whereby the security interests of both Korean states will 
be observed, said Panov. 
  It is difficult so far to talk about the date of the 
international conference, he went on to say. "We propose that a 
consultative meeting be held to discuss the agenda," he said. 
  Asked if the government crisis in Japan would influence 
Russian-Japanese relations, Panov said that Russia had no fears 
on this score. Judging by all accounts, Tokyo will not change 
its policy in relation to Russia whoever heads the Japanese 
government and whichever parties are represented in it.

  [Text] Moscow, 19 Apr -- Japan positively views the recent 
Moscow initiative on convening an international conference on 
the questions of security in the Korean peninsula and its 
nonnuclear status, according to the formula "six plus two" and 
thinks it reflects Russia's serious interests in solving the 
North Korean nuclear problem, stated Japanese Ambassador Koji 
Watanabe in his exclusive interview with the ITAR-TASS 
correspondent. 
  Having pointed out the similarity of positions taken by 
Tokyo 
and Moscow, the diplomat stressed Japan's intention to continue 
to exchange views on this problems in close contact with Moscow. 
The ambassador said that questions of easing the situation in 
the Korean Peninsula, including the problem of Korean 
unification, are constantly on the agenda in the 
Japanese-Russian political dialogue. 
  Watanabe expressed the view that the most important thing at 
present will be to make sure that the DPRK allows the IAEA 
[International Atomic Energy Agency] inspectors to examine its 
most suspect nuclear installations in accordance with the recent 
appeal made by the UN Security Council chairman. The diplomat 
also pointed at Japan's intention to "resolutely demand" that 
North Korea continues to remain within the framework of the 
nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and adhere to the North-South 
joint declaration on the nonnuclear status of the Korean 
peninsula.

  [Text] Moscow, 19 Apr -- Morihiro Hosokawa's resignation 
from the post of Japanese prime minister and the expected 
formation of a new government in the near future will not lead 
to changes in Tokyo's policies toward Russia. This was clearly 
stated by the Japanese ambassador in Moscow, Koji Watanabe, in 
an exclusive interview with an ITAR-TASS correspondent. "Policy 
toward Russia is one of the most important elements of Japanese 
diplomacy," he stressed. 
  The ambassador said that the Tokyo declaration, adopted by 
the leaders of the two countries during the visit by Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin to Japan last October had created "a new 
basis for further progress in Russo-Japanese relations." The 
diplomat said that "the continuation of constant efforts to 
develop relations, on the basis of this declaration, is the 
consistent and immutable policy of our country." 
  Koji Watanabe recalled that during the visit to Moscow last 
month by Tsutomu Hata, Japan's deputy prime minister and foreign 
minister -- who is regarded as the principal contender for the 
post of head of the new government -- the parties agreed to 
advance steadily toward a settlement of the territorial problem, 
based on the Tokyo declaration. The Russian side stressed its 
commitment to the policy of deepening reform, and the Japanese 
side emphasized that there would be no change in its policy of 
assisting these reforms. 
  The ambassador indirectly confirmed that the change in the 
Japanese cabinet would not remove from the agenda the question 
of a visit to Russia by the Japanese prime minister this year. 
He recalled that the invitation to make the visit, which 
Yeltsin conveyed to the Japanese prime minister last October, 
was confirmed by Viktor Chernomyrdin, the head of the Russian 
government, and Andrey Kozyrev, the foreign minister, during 
their recent meetings with Hata. "I think that when Japan has a 
new prime minister, a specific date for his visit to Russia will 
be agreed along diplomatic channels," the ambassador said. 
  ITAR-TASS has learned from diplomatic sources that the 
Japanese premier's visit to Moscow this year may be preceded by 
a visit to Tokyo by Andrey Kozyrev in order to prepare for the 
summit meeting.

  [Text] Moscow April 20 TASS -- During Vietnamese Prime 
Minister Vo Van Kiet's planned visit to Moscow in June, most 
probably a package of important intergovernmental agreements 
will be signed. The documents will regulate economic cooperation 
and political relations between the two countries, a 
high-ranking source in the Russian Foreign Ministry told 
ITAR-TASS. 
  The head of the Vietnamese Government will pay his first 
visit to Moscow after the disintegration of the Soviet Union. 
It is considered an important landmark in bilateral relations 
in the Russian Foreign Ministry. 
  According to the Foreign Ministry source, during talks with 
the Vietnamese prime minister discussions will be held on the 
prospects of broadening Russia's interaction with Vietnam, a 
traditional ally of Moscow in the Asia-Pacific region. 
  The diplomat emphasised that the two countries are 
"successfully coordinating their political steps in the 
Asia-Pacific region. Useful exchange of views had taken place 
during meetings between heads of foreign affairs department of 
the two countries in lobbies of two ASEAN (Association of South 
East Asian Nations) summits. On a majority of issues positions 
of the two states coincide or are close, the diplomat added.

  [Text] Chairman of the State Duma Committee for 
international affairs Vladimir Lukin considers "improbable" that 
the lower chamber of parliament will hold a closed meeting to 
discuss the situation in former Yugoslavia Wednesday, April 20. 
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin earlier 
reported to Interfax about the possibility of holding such a 
meeting after meeting with speaker of the State Duma Ivan Rybkin. 
  According to Lukin, the Council of the State Duma on Tuesday 
decided to put on the agenda of the plenary meeting on Wednesday 
only the issue of sending a parliamentary delegation to the 
republics of former Yugoslavia. He pointed out that the 
delegation will include representatives of all factions and 
intends to get acquainted with the positions of all sides in the 
conflict.

<F P=106> [Lyubov Tsukanova report: "Poverty Is a Threat to Civil </F>
Peace"] 
  [Text] This warning [reference to headline] has been issued 
in the State Duma by representatives of the "Russia's Choice" 
and "Yabloko" democratic factions who are members of the 
Committee on Labor and Social Support. In their opinion, 
poverty in our country is escalating from a social problem into 
a political one: The lumpenization of society and the growth in 
irritation, dissatisfaction, and wounded dignity in a 
considerable section of the population which only recently was 
considered perfectly successful in terms of its standard of 
living do not lead to democracy but create preconditions for a 
new dictatorship. 
  Duma Deputy Ella Pamfilova, former minister of social 
protection of the population, believes that the way out can be 
found by creating a long-term federal program to combat poverty. 
It must be based on the package of draft laws which specialists 
have already worked out: Deputies intend to submit it soon for 
examination by the State Duma. The first thing in this package 
must be a law on the minimum living wage, which should include 
criteria for assessing the standard of living and the minimum 
per capita provision, below which the state cannot allow itself 
to fall. 
  Deputy Petr Shchelishch ("Yabloko") is convinced that 
poverty 
is not only a problem of the poor but a problem of the moral 
health of society. Since there are different paths to poverty 
(nowadays they depend not only on the person himself), the means 
of assisting the individual on the part of the state and society 
must also be different: from direct poverty benefits for those 
who cannot resolve this problem on their own to the creation of 
a system to support those who are in a position to create the 
basis of their prosperity by their own efforts (young families, 
people who have lost their job, etc.). For this it is necessary 
to reorient the state's system of priorities: Expenditure on 
"bread and shelter" must be the top priority. Without this it 
is impossible to transform society efficiently, since the growth 
of the "nouveau pauvre" section narrows the base of economic and 
political reforms. 
  Problems of poverty -- above all, the question of the 
minimum 
living wage -- will today be the subject of parliamentary 
hearings in the State Duma organized on the initiative of the 
Committee on Labor and Social Support and of parliament's 
democratic factions. In their initiative the deputies of a 
democratic orientation proceed from the premise that further 
ignoring of social problems discredits not only the authorities 
implementing the reform in the country but also the reforms 
themselves.

<F P=106> [Aleksey Kirpichnikov report under the "Territories" rubric: </F>
"Urals Republic Idea Was Interesting. Center Fails To 
Appreciate Eduard Rossel's Good Intentions"] 
  [Text] The State Duma hearings on the Urals Republic that 
never materialized reminds one of a discussion about the rise 
and fall of an ancient state. Deputy Vladimir Lysenko outlined 
five conceptual models of Russia's administrative system. The 
first one calls for making all the current Federation components 
guberniyas (that is, for lowering the republics' status). The 
second, on the contrary, calls for the raising of the status of 
krays and oblasts to that of the republics. The third one calls 
for creating lands, letting the republics be. The fourth one is 
about creating lands all over Russia. And finally, the fifth 
one calls for a development of regional economic associations. 
  Eduard Rossel, current member of the Federation Council and 
recent head of the administration of Sverdlovsk Oblast and 
chairman of its soviet, and who was discharged from his position 
by the president precisely for the idea of a Urals Republic, 
complained about overcentralization of the economy; he was 
trying to prove that the people of Yekaterinburg had no 
separatist goals in mind and were simply trying to shift the 
burden of reforms into the regions. At first the republic was 
seen as an association of six territories. Mr. Rossel had taken 
this idea for equal rights for Federation components to 18 
ministries in Moscow and received 18 rejections. After that the 
oblast held a referendum where the idea of a republic obtained 
84 percent of the votes. On 27 October, a session of the oblast 
soviet passed the constitution of a Urals Republic (so far to be 
comprised of Sverdlovsk Oblast). The same day regulations for 
the elections of a legislative assembly were confirmed, with the 
president dissolving the Sverdlovsk soviet two weeks after. The 
heads of the contiguous territories, naturally, feared the same 
fate as Mr. Rossel's, and the Urals republic did not materialize 
after all. 
  Speaking next, Emil Pain, member of the Presidential 
Council, 
agreed that the architects of a Urals Republic had not been 
separatist-minded, and put the spotlight on an important mistake 
made at the time of organizing the new administrative entity, a 
mistake that largely contributed to the initiative's failure. 
Public opinion, hence of those in power at various levels, took 
the Urals Republic idea precisely as separatist. This attests 
not only to an inadequately analytical perception of the 
described idea at the federative level, but also to the fact 
that those who elaborated the social project may have supposed 
that no public opinion was going to be formed, or they ignored 
it, or they hoped for the common sense of average Russians and 
those in executive positions. Which is, as usual, a pity.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Isakov "Parliamentary Diary": "Budget Drama--Act </F>
Two"] 
  [Excerpt] "Givi Is Seriously Ill" 
  I called last year's report on the examination of the budget 
message the "Budget Drama." Has anything changed since then? 
The answer is in the headline of this piece. 
  As a participant in the adoption of the state budget for a 
fourth time through the voters' will I cannot fail to see how 
time after time its content is emasculated and the budget 
process is degraded and turned into a mockery. 
  It makes sense to begin the discussion of the 1994 budget 
with certain results. The official account of the previous year 
has not been submitted by the government and no wonder -- there 
is little comfort in it. But there are some unofficial 
statistics, which are: 
  Fall in industrial production: 
  Prediction in the president's message: 7 percent; 
  Actual figure for the year: 16.2 percent. 
  Rise in Prices: 
  Prediction in the president's message: Threefold; 
  Actual figure for the year: Tenfold. 
  Federal Budget Deficit (as a percentage of GDP): 
  Prediction in the president's message: 5 percent; 
  Actual figure for the year: 10.6 percent. 
  According to the main socioeconomic indicators, this is a 
two- to three-fold discrepancy! Can that really be true? Yes, 
it can. 
  The new program presented by the government looks no more 
realistic either. The prediction for the fall in production in 
1994 is around 8 percent. But in the first quarter alone it was 
25 percent and over the year, according to the specialists' 
estimates, it could be at a level of 30 percent. The budget has 
been calculated on the basis of an inflation rate of 490-510 
percent (whereas in fact it was 730 percent in the first 
quarter). 
  There is a further increase in taxes built into the budget: 
a 6 percent increase in profit tax, 3 percent in value-added 
tax, 2 percent in property tax, and so forth. The government 
intends to use the taxation system to gather into the budget a 
sum equal to 16.6 percent of GDP. But last year it managed to 
collect only 10.6 perecent of GDP and in the first quarter of 
this year the figure was even less -- 8 percent. So there you 
have it, the first result of the move toward the "market": Over 
90 percent of created public wealth is bypassing the budget and 
being distributed outside state control. Have you felt the 
difference? 
  It is obvious to the naked eye that the economic slump is 
assuming the character of chronic stagnation: State investments 
in the development of the economy are a token sum in terms of 
the budget -- around 2 percent of GDP -- and have fallen even 
when compared with last year's clearly understated level. The 
agrarian sector, science, education, and culture are being 
underfunded. While budget spending is rising by an average of 
fivefold, spending on social programs is rising by 4.1 times.... 
On the other hand, spending on the state apparatus is rising 
eightfold! 
  Gaping holes are appearing in the revenue section of the 
budget, too. The planned transition from a voucher-based 
privatization to cash is being accompanied by...a sharp 
reduction in that item of revenue. In that case, where will the 
funds go? Into the pockets of brazen privatizers? It will cost 
hundreds of billions of rubles to maintain the tax benefits 
granted by the president and the government to individual, 
selected "favorites," in crude violation of the existing 
legislation. 
  The conclusion: This discredited economic course is 
continuing in an even clearer and more overt form. Let us ask 
ourselves: Can such a budget be the basis of social accord? 
  The budget is not just a mirror of the economy but a 
continuation of policy. Despite all the talk about the 
significance and importance of the budget, neither the president 
nor the chairman of the government turned up for the discussion 
of it. Acting Foreign Minister Dubinin "carried the can" for 
them all. 
  The document which bears the solemn title "the budget" can 
only be called a budget if you really stretch a point: It 
contains no account of the execution of the budget for 1992 or 
preliminary results of the execution of the budget in 1993, it 
does not offer indicators forecasting the development of the 
economy in 1994, it has no list of state targeted programs, 
there is no explanation of the majority of budget items.... 
Essentially it is not a budget at all but a set of departmental 
items of expenditure linked by a single demand that unites them 
all: "Give us the money and clear off!" 
  One can understand that there is no money in the state 
today, 
and that the threadbare Russian budget cannot satisfy everyone's 
needs. What is harder to understand is why the government 
cannot present even this budget on time? Why it is presented in 
an incomplete form without accounting documents and each time 
using a new methodology which prevents a comparison with the 
previous year's results? 
  However, there is a most direct link between the first and 
second points: The present political leadership, which has led 
the country into the quagmire of the economic crisis, cannot 
stand being monitored and has no intention of answering to 
anyone, least of all to the deputies. You will not give us the 
money? We will take it without asking. And if you demand an 
account -- we will mislead you. And we will forbid you in the 
future from interfering in the executive's affairs. 
  Well, what about the Duma? Two opposing standpoints clashed 
at the Duma session during the discussion of the budget: 
"Reject the budget and send it back to the government for 
revision," and "adopt the budget on first reading." I consider 
the former option correct. But in present conditions, when the 
Duma has been cut off from the mass media, it will find it 
difficult even to convey its view to the people, let alone 
explain it. And, conversely, it is very easy to become a target 
for those who are seeking scapegoats for their own mistakes 
(remember how last year the Supreme Soviet was castigated for 
the budget). That is why they could have accepted the moderate 
compromise proposed by the Duma's Budget and Finance Committee: 
"To consider the budget presented." 
  But such a compromise did not suit the government -- it 
needed a "more soothing" formula. So the Duma committees headed 
by the chairman of the chamber looked for one. Eventually they 
found one: The budget is totally unsuitable and needs a 
fundamental revision but "is adopted as a basis." There was 
laughter and irritation: "Givi is sick, come and bury him," was 
how one Duma wag commented on the decision adopted. 
  However, no verbal trickery can hide the unpleasant fact 
that 
Russia does not have a budget and is not going to get one in the 
near future. The government cannot produce one, the Duma is in 
no position to do so.... [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Commentary under "Latest News" rubric: "One Budget for a </F>
Dozen Problems] 
  [Text] At first sight, the decree on the federal budget for 
1994 adopted by the State Duma is a strange one. The draft 
budget proposed by the government has been adopted as a working 
base. But at the same time the government is invited to revise 
all the main budgetary indicators to allow for new economic 
priorities, and to present the draft again for a first reading. 
  We will not, however, suspect the poor Duma deputies of 
economic sabotage. On the contrary, in my view, they displayed 
exceptional resourcefulness in seeking a constructive solution 
to a complex problem. The draft budget was composed in an 
extremely hardline monetarist spirit, as if at the behest of 
Gaydar and Fedorov. And not because Premier V. Chernomyrdin has 
suddenly rallied to the colors of Milton Friedman. At heart he 
is still a sector specialist, but the current political 
situation compells him to hoist the monetarist flag higher than 
Gaydar and Fedorov themselves. There is no real money in the 
state coffers, and all the problems of budget funding can be 
resolved only by the nomenklatura method of "removing 
difficulties" through back-stage bureaucratic horse-trading. 
That is to say, today we bailed out this lot, tomorrow we will 
bail out another lot, and a third lot the day after. To bail out 
everyone at once -- that is, to adopt a budget which would 
satisfy the interests of all lobbyists -- is not possible. 
  A way out of the impasse was found, as was to have been 
expected, during lobby negotiations, during which Chernomyrdin 
won over the agrarians by promising them money "later." The 
aforementioned Duma decree, which was compounded on the 
principle of "bread now and jam tomorrow" was also a reflection 
of this "consensus." V. Zhirinovskiy took part for the first 
time in lobby horse trading on an internal economic theme; in 
exchange for his support for the compromise decision, he -- 
evidently maliciously -- demanded the inclusion in the protocol 
of the decree a demand for the resignation of Ministers Yerin, 
Kozyrev, and Chubays. The demand was indeed included. 
  This testifies not only to deputies' political 
"flexibility," 
but also to their social alertness [sotsialnaya adekvatnost], 
their understanding of the "scientific" fact that the real 
conflict of interests lies not in the sphere of voucher 
privatization, foreign policy, or the battle with crime. All 
this is secondary. The crucial topic in Russian life is 
competition between the major sector groups over the sharing out 
of national income.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 75 (565) for </F>
19 April; compiled by Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy and 
edited by Vladimir Shishlin] 
  [Text] President Nazarbayev intends early in May to submit 
to parliament a message with an analysis of the economic 
situation in the country and his proposals on the way out of the 
crisis. He made the statement Tuesday at the opening of the 
session of the new parliament elected on 7 March. 
  Addressing deputies, the president said that Kazakhstan has 
for the first time a professional parliament. He expressed hope 
that all branches of power would cooperate constructively. 
  Nazarbayev favored the need for further constitutional 
transformations, including the restructuring of parliament into 
a two-house one, granting it right to impeach the president and 
granting the prime minister the right to dissolve the 
legislature. 
  Earlier the head of state met a large group of deputies. The 
president's spokesman, Nurlan Danenov, told Interfax that 
deputies and the president have similar stands on many points. 
Nazarbayev favored at the meeting the introduction of private 
property and the equality by law of those nations living in the 
Republic. 
  The institute of strategic studies under the president 
published in an Alma-Ata [Almaty] newspaper an analytical 
forecast of the future new parliament. It says that the 
parliament may work before the presidential elections of 1996 or 
more if pro-government deputies close their ranks, form a large 
faction and will successfully confront the opposition. 
  Analysts believe that pro-government deputies ("People's 
Unity of Kazakhstan" Union, leader--Nazarbayev, deputies elected 
on the ticket offered by the president, and leader of bodies of 
power) may agree to concessions to the opposition. 
  Presidential experts also forecast that if the 
pro-government 
faction is not formed, part of the deputies, if pressurized by 
the opposition in adopting laws, may leave the parliament. If 
so, a question could be raised about early elections.

  [Excerpts] [No dateline as received] As reported earlier, 
during an official visit to Russia by the President of 
Kazakhstan, the two heads of state signed a memorandum on the 
principles of settling issues related to the citizenship and 
legal status of citizens of Kazakhstan permanently residing on 
the territory of the Russian Federation and those citizens of 
the Russian Federation permanently residing on the territory of 
Kazakhstan. [passage omitted] 
  Nursultan Nazarbayev and Boris Yeltsin have reaffirmed their 
adherence to widely recognized norms and freedoms. The 
memorandum reaffirmed the intention to settle the 
above-mentioned issues by simplifying the procedure for 
obtaining relevant citizenship by citizens of any of these two 
countries and their relatives arriving in Kazakhstan or Russia 
for permanent residency. Thus it should ensure that citizens of 
one country who are permanently residing on the territory of 
other state, except for certain cases, enjoy equal rights and 
obligations. 
  The document grants citizens of one country the right to 
work 
on a contractual basis at works and enterprises of the other 
country. This is also the case with the military service on the 
contractual basis. 
  Also under consideration is the possibility for simplifying 
procedures related to movements and travel of citizen of one 
country on the territory of the other country. 
  The sides would also guarantee their citizens the right to 
travel without visas; the governments won't level any taxes, 
impose any administrative restrictions, or insist on the need 
for registration except for the cases of infringement of the law 
or departure for a third country. There is also a plan for 
simplifying the customs regulations related to border crossings 
between the two countries. 
  The memorandum also says that conditions will be created 
that 
will enable individuals and juridical bodies to carry out 
currency exchange and financial transactions on the agreed scale 
from one country to another. 
  One of the important principles is granting the right to a 
citizen of one country who is residing on the territory of the 
other to ownership, use, and management of his property in 
accordance with the legal acts of the country where he resides. 
  The presidents of Kazakhstan and Russia reaffirm their 
intention not to allow on the territories of their countries any 
action on the part of organization or groups and certain 
individuals which inflame interethnic tensions or [word 
indistinct] against individuals or certain groups of the 
population on the basis of their nationality, religion, or 
political adherence. An interstate agreement is being 
elaborated on the basis of these principles. It is due to be 
ratified after President of both countries sign it.

  [Text] The idea of a single economic area is being put into 
practice, if slowly, said Kyrgyzstan Prime Minister Abbas 
Dzhumagulov. Speaking in parliament, he commended Moscow's 
recent CIS summit. He said Russia and Kyrgyzstan had signed a 
cooperation agreement during it, under which Kyrgyzstan is to 
receive a credit of 50 billion rubles. 
  Dzhumagulov said that, among the priority measures taken by 
his government since the beginning of the year, were tighter 
financial control, abolition of the practice of customs and tax 
concessions, and increasing local government's responsibility 
for the execution of the central government's decisions. 
  Nevertheless, the economic situation remains "extremely 
grave," the prime minister said. "There are still no efficient 
economic ties, the mutual nonpayment crisis is continuing, the 
economy is out of control, and there is a gap between the 
production and marketing of output," he said. IF Note: 
President Askar Akayev is more optimistic. He said in 
parliament on April 13 that the republic's reforms had produced 
positive results, "pushing forward the ossified, totally 
state-run economy." There are "reassuring signs of 
normalization of the economic situation," Akayev said. He said 
free prices and the tight monetary policy had had a beneficial 
effect on Kyrgyzstan's social life. People had started taking 
interest in business enterprise, which had served to increase 
goods supplies, he said. 
  "Unless the government in the immediate future raises funds 
to restructure industry, the latter will destroy itself," 
Dzhumagulov said. 
  He expressed especial concern over the bankruptcy problem, 
complaining that not a single enterprise had yet been declared 
bankrupt, although a law on bankruptcy had come out. The 
economy would have no future unless unprofitable enterprises 
were liquidated, he said. 
  Another serious problem is the visible trade deficit, which 
has topped 400 million soms, the premier said. He said the 
situation where the country is importing more than it is 
exporting is bringing to naught all the anti-inflationary 
measures taken by the government, because, in his view, it is 
the imported goods that are fueling inflation. 
  For this reason, the government ought to concentrate on 
measures to stimulate domestic production, he said, vowing once 
again that all conditions would be provided for small-scale 
business. He said the government would temporarily reduce taxes 
to encourage production. 
  Dzhumagulov also said that this year the government, in its 
economic policy, would give priority to social objectives. It 
is for this purpose that the government has set up a fund to 
support poorer population strata. 
  He said it was essential to start the development of the 
Kumtor gold field as soon as possible, which "would not solve 
all the problems" but "would be a serious help for the economy 
of the republic." 
  To the objections of parliament members who had repeatedly 
demanded that Kyrgyzstan break its agreement on Kumtor, a 
deposit estimated to contain 516 tonnes of gold, with the 
Canadian company Cameco and instead put up a tender for its 
development, Dzhumagulov responded that a tender "would mean 
nothing but extra expenses and a loss of time."

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Vladimir </F>
Gavrilov] 
  [Text] Moscow, 19 Apr -- The Tajik opposition delegation is 
holding a conference in Moscow today to draw up its proposal on 
the venue and date for the next round of talks with 
representatives of official Dushanbe. It is expected to be held 
either in Islamabad or in Tehran. According to the Tajik 
Embassy in Moscow, the opposition does not insist on Emomali 
Rakhmonov, chairman of the republic's Supreme Soviet, being 
there. 
  The ITAR-TASS correspondent learned from the same sources 
that by and large the Dushanbe delegation positively assesses 
the results of the first round, at which agreement was reached 
with the opposition not to allow hostile actions on the 
Afghan-Tajik border. 
  The sides have expressed their determination to continue 
dialogues and to seek a compromise, even though their stands on 
the agenda remain unchanged. Thus, the Dushanbe delegation 
still believes it is advisable first to ensure peace on the 
Afghan-Tajik border and the return of refugees, and then to hold 
a referendum on the Tajik constitution and presidential 
elections. On the other hand, the opposition will come to the 
next round with the same package of documents as before 
concerning the refugee problem, political settlement in the 
country, the revocation of the ban on the activities of 
political parties and movements, setting up a State Council made 
up of independent persons, and a referendum on the constitution. 
  The first round of talks between the Tajik authorities and 
the opposition has been taking place in Moscow since 6 April. 
On 17 April Hoji Akbar Turajonzoda, one of the eminent 
opposition leaders, arrived from Islamabad to take part. Also 
present has been Muhammadsharif Himmatzoda, chairman of the 
Islamic Rebirth Party. The talks have been conducted with the 
assistance of Ramiro Piriz Ballon, the UN secretary general's 
special envoy in Tajikistan.

  [Text] Moscow 19 April TASS -- The first round of 
inter-Tajik negotiations has reached its major goal of the 
beginning of a political dialogue between the Tajik Government 
and the opposition. The negotiations were held under the U.N. 
aegis and with active participation of the Russian Federation, 
special envoy of the United Nations Secretary-General Ramiro 
Piriz-Ballon told a news conference here today. 
  In his words, the Tajik Government and the opposition are 
determined to find a peaceful solution to the complicated 
political problems in order to achieve national reconciliation 
in Tajikistan and restore national economy. 
  The sides have managed to agree on the agenda and sign an 
appeal on all sides to abstain from actions that may endanger 
the results of political negotiations. 
  It was an important discussion, but the sides understood it 
is impossible to achieve a comprehensive decision at the first 
round of negotiations. They will be continued in other places. 
Iran and Pakistan have offered their territories for further 
inter-Tajik talks, said Ramiro Piriz-Ballon.

<F P=106> [Report by Arkadiy Dubnov: "Talks on the Future of </F>
Tajikistan: No Success Yet, but Then No Failure"] 
  [Text] The leaders of the Tajik opposition -- Khodzhi 
Akbar Turadzhonzoda, former spiritual leader of Tajikistan, and 
Mukhammadsharif Khemmatzoda, chairman of the Islamic Revival 
Party -- have traveled to Moscow via Islamabad. 
  They are both authorized leaders of the Tajik opposition 
delegation at the inter-Tajik talks taking place in Moscow under 
the auspices of the UN secretary general's special envoy Ramiro 
Piriz-Ballon. 
  The first -- Moscow -- round of the inter-Tajik talks has 
ended, having opened on 5 April. Republic Minister Shukurdzhon 
Zukhurov officially headed the Tajikistan government delegation, 
the unofficial Tajikistan foreign minister Rashid Alimov, who 
has been in Moscow for the duration [sentence as published]. 
The opposition delegation was temporarily headed by Otakhon 
Latifi, chairman of the Coordinating Center of Tajikistan 
Democratic Forces in the CIS Countries. 
  During two weeks of talks behind closed doors the sides 
managed to agree on an agenda for the subsequent rounds of 
dialogue. A total of 27 questions are to be discussed, divided 
into three "baskets." The first concerns a political settlement 
in Tajikistan and includes the cessation of hostilities on the 
Tajik-Afghan border and inside the Republic, the attitude toward 
the military formations of various government forces and 
opposition forces, and various measures contributing to mutual 
trust. The second agenda "basket" is intended to solve problems 
connected with the return of refugees and people who were forced 
to move: guarantees of a safe return home, property matters... 
  Finally, the third "basket" contains fundamental questions 
of 
the future constitutional structure and consolidation of the 
statehood of the Republic of Tajikistan, a new election law, the 
holding of elections, a transitional period in the Republic... 
  In an IZVESTIYA interview at the end of December with former 
Tajikistan chief justice Turadzhonzoda, he formulated the basic 
approaches to a peaceful settlement as a result of which the 
Tajik-Tajik talks finally began in Moscow. The Tajik opposition 
aknowledged at the time that Russia had geopolitical interests 
in the region and agreed that Russian peacemaking forces should 
stay in Tajikistan on condition that their commanders were 
replaced. 
  In Moscow now, answering my questions, Turadzhonzoda 
particularly stressed that they had come to the Russian capital 
to express their respect for and gratitude to Russia for the 
part it is playing in a peaceful settlement in their country. 
The opposition leaders are hoping to meet with Russian 
leadership representatives in Moscow. 
  Turadzhonzoda and Khemmatzoda intend to participate in the 
next rounds of the inter-Tajik talks, which will take place in 
the Iranian or Pakistani capital, on condition that "top people" 
in the official Tajik leadership are also participating.

Abdulmadjid Samadov told a news conference in Dushanbe on 
Tuesday. 
  Replying to journalists, he said that the republic "firmly 
abides by the position of pooling the monetary systems of 
Tajikistan and Russia". This notwithstanding, bank notes with 
national symbols will appear in the republic in May. 
  According to the premier, they are called upon to serve the 
needs of the domestic market. This measure is temporary, 
Samadov stressed, and the reason for it is "that Tajikistan is 
now at an intermediary stage of pooling the monetary systems of 
the two states". 
  The meeting with journalists was arranged in connection with 
the opening of a national strategic research centre which is 
called upon to prepare true information on the situation in 
various spheres and to carry out examination of the most 
important decisions taken by the republican leadership. 
  The centre is also instructed to work out the government's 
position on major economic projects.

  [Text] This May, Tajikistan will introduce its own currency 
with national symbols totally worth about 150 Bn rubles, Tajik 
Prime Minister Abdudzhalil Samadov told a news conference in 
Dushanbe Tuesday. 
  At the same time, the money introduced for the purpose of 
internal payments and backing the exchange of goods inside the 
country are a temporary means of payment which will serve until 
the unification of Tajikistan's monetary system with that of 
Russia rather than as a national currency. Samadov spoke in 
favor of immediate unification pointing to the fact that the 
country was on the threshold of a social upheaval. 
  Samadov called on the people to wait two more months. He 
added that Tajikistan had received only 70 out of 120 Bn rubles 
of Russia's cash credit. Another 80 Bn rubles of a Russian 
technical credit will be received in the near future. However, 
unpaid salaries, pensions, stipends, etc. amounted to 174 Bn 
rubles in the first quarter of the year. 
  The temporary monetary unit to be called the sum was 
designed 
with the exclusive purpose to cover the debts. 
  After the unification of the two countries' monetary 
systems, 
sums will be exchanged in Russian banks for Russian rubles one 
to one, Samadov was quoted as saying.

<F P=106> [Report Vladimir Berezovskiy: "General Chechulin: Jihad </F>
Declared Against Border Guards"] 
  [Text] Tashkent -- The situation on the Tajik-Afghan 
border is not calm. As has already been reported, an armored 
transporter was blown up by an antitank mine in the Pyandzh 
[name as transliterated] detachment's sector. Lieutenant 
Aleksey Vladimirov was killed and four servicemen were injured. 
The mine was laid by subversives from the Afghan side, who had 
made a hole in the fence beforehand. 
  Days earlier, this detachment's checkpoint had been shelled 
by four rockets fired from the direction of the village of 
Vandari Sherkhan [name as transliterated], which is controlled 
by units of the Afghan 54th Division. The border guards did not 
open fire in retaliation, so as to avoid casualties among the 
civilian population. 
  The Tajik Government has pinned the blame for this 
provocation on the armed opposition, which, in official 
Dushanbe's opinion, wants thereby to wreck the talks under way 
in Moscow. General Anatoliy Chechulin, commander of the Russian 
Border Guards Group, put it even more sharply. He is convinced 
that this action was planned. And it would have played into the 
hands of both the opposition and the Afghans if Tajik refugees 
had suffered from the retribution. 
  Incidentally, the leadership of Konduz Province recently 
proposed that Tajik refugees not be prevented from returning 
home in exchange for deliveries of electricity from Khotlon 
Oblast. In other words, the refugees have turned into a 
bargaining chip. The general noted that there is a limit to the 
border guards' patience. And they will provide a proper rebuff, 
even despite the fact that, as he put it, Khodzhi Akbar 
Turadzhonzod [name as transliterated], one of the opposition 
leaders, recently called for a jihad against the border guards. 
  The former official head of the Tajik Muslims, who refused 
to 
go to the talks in Moscow, stated in Tehran that the opposition 
is indeed insisting on the withdrawal of Russian border guards 
from Tajikistan. Khodzhi Akbar Turadzhonzod explained his 
absence from the talks by the fact that Emomali Rakhmonov, the 
current head of the republic, had not gone to Moscow, nor had 
other major figures representing Kulyab, which played a decisive 
role in routing the opposition's combat detachments.

  [Text] Dushanbe, 20 Apr -- Last night a group of Tajik 
opposition militants attempted to break through from Afghanistan 
to Tajikistan in one of the sectors covered by the Pyandzh 
border guards. In the course of a short armed clash between the 
militants and the Russian border guards, one of the 
transgressors was killed and the rest returned to the Afghan 
bank of the Pyandzh. All was quiet last night on all the other 
areas of the Tajik-Afghan border. This information was given to 
an ITAR-TASS correspondent at the headquarters of the Russian 
border troops in Tajikistan.

the youth. 
  Saparmurad Niyazov announced the creation of a council of 
religious affairs under the president of Turkmenistan which will 
consist of Moslem Qazis together with workers of the Russian 
Orthodox Church.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Lev Frolov] </F>
  [Text] St. Petersburg April 19 TASS -- Turkmenia is an 
attraction to foreign investment. Assurances for favorable 
opportunities for foreign investment were made by Rashit 
Kodyrov, chief of the department for work with international 
financial organisations and banks at the Turkmenian Cabinet of 
Ministers. He spoke on Tuesday at a briefing in St. Petersburg 
during an annual meeting of the board of governors of the 
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. 
  Turkmenia is a major attraction to foreign investment and 
capital, Kodyrov said. The purpose of investment is the 
implementation of priority projects in oil and gas extraction, 
transport infrastructure, telecommunications, the agrarian 
sector. This work is preceded by international tenders that 
proved their commercial expedience and attractiveness on the 
example of the development of deposits on the Caspian shelf and 
in Kotu-Tepe. Jointly with large petrochemical firms Amoco, 
Shell, Chevron and others, joint ventures have been formed that 
intend to invest up to $100 million into the development of 
deposits. 
  Much interest was shown in a report about plans for a gas 
pipeline to stretch from Turkmenia to Europe via Iran and 
Turkey. The volume of the deliveries of natural gas through that 
pipeline will be 25,000 million cubic meters a year. The 
Turkmenian government plans the construction of a railway to the 
border with Iran, of the last section of the Transasian line and 
of a number of highways. 
  Experts believe that the Turkmenian programme "Ten Years of 
Prosperity" opens broad opportunities for investment to the 
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and to other 
international financial institutions. The bank, specifically, 
intends to invest into the projects for the reconstruction of 
the port of Krasnovodsk, facilities of the textile industry, for 
the development of the hotel business in Ashkhabad [Ashgabat] 
and in other cities.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent] </F>
  [Text] Tashkent, 19 Apr -- The development of relations 
between China and the countries of Central Asia will not be to 
the detriment of its ties with the other CIS countries, 
including Russia. This was stated today by PRC State Council 
Prime Minister Li Peng following the talks which took place with 
Uzbekistan President Islam Karimov this morning at the Palace of 
Friendship. 
  "We hope," said the Chinese prime minister, "that the CIS 
states will maintain friendly relations among themselves and 
will cooperate for the sake of regional stability and 
development." 
  The head of the Chinese Government is in Uzbekistan on an 
official visit. Tashkent is his first port of call on his 
marathon tour around the neighboring countries in the course of 
which he is to visit Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, and 
Mongolia as well. 
  Today an agreement was concluded on granting a Chinese loan 
to Uzbekistan, but the amount is not known. The package of 
intergovernmental documents signed also included an agreement on 
air traffic, a protocol on granting material and technical aid 
to Uzbekistan gratuitously, and an agreement on cooperation 
between the Chinese Committee for the Promotion of International 
Trade and the Ministry of Foreign Economic Ties of Uzbekistan. 
  A representative of the Chinese delegation reported to 
journalists that Islam Karimov and Li Peng discussed a wide 
range of bilateral, regional, and international problems. In 
the opinion of Islam Karimov, Central Asia represents an 
extensive market with enormous potential. The expansion of 
Uzbek-Chinese cooperation, he stressed, corresponds to the 
fundamental interests of the two peoples and also favors 
regional stability and prosperity. 
  In his turn Li Peng noted the personal contribution of the 
president of Uzbekistan to the development of relations between 
the two countries. Speaking of trade and economic ties, he 
called the successful activity of the Uzbek-Chinese joint 
enterprises already operating "just a beginning" and invited 
Uzbek entrepreneurs to go to China to study experience and 
expand business contacts. 
  The Chinese prime minister noted that that there are no 
fundamental contradictions between the interests of China and 
Uzbekistan, and cooperation between them can develop on a 
mutually advantageous basis. He stressed the willingness of 
China to maintain a regular exchange of views with Uzbekistan 
and hold consultations on regional and international issues for 
the purpose of strengthening mutual understanding and trust. 
  On behalf of PRC President Jiang Zemin, Li Peng invited 
Islam 
Karimov to visit China in the second half of this year. The 
leader of Uzbekistan previously visited the PRC in March 1992. 
  The entrepreneurs accompanying Li Peng also concluded a 
number of deals with Uzbek partners in the sphere of the 
petroleum industry, construction, metallurgy, the textile and 
paper industries, and electronics. It has been decided, for 
example, to build a joint enterprise for the production of 
paper. China will also deliver a line for the assembly of 
domestic electrical appliances.

  [Excerpts] The official visit of Li Peng, PRC State Council 
prime minister, to our country continues. [passage omitted] 
  One-on-one talks were held between Islam Karimov, president 
of the Republic of Uzbekistan, and Li Peng, PRC State Council 
prime minister. During the visit, questions on the prospects for 
cooperation between Uzbekistan and China in political, economic, 
scientific, and technical fields were examined. Talks then 
continued on a wider scale with the participation of the members 
of the delegation. Islam Karimov expressed with satisfaction the 
common stance of the leaders of Uzbekistan and China on many 
questions. For instance, Uzbekistan and China want the expansion 
of mutual cooperation and the establishment of friendly 
relations with neighboring countries. [passage omitted] 
  Li Peng, PRC State Council prime minister, thanked Islam 
Karimov, for the warm reception given to the delegation led by 
him on Uzbek land. Since ancient times our lands have been 
linked by the Great Silk Road; the visit of Islam Karimov to our 
country opened a new chapter in the relations of China with 
Uzbekistan, which is friendly and close to us, stated the guest. 
We have common views on international relations. The 
Republics, which were for a long time part of the former Union, 
are closely linked with one another. China considers that it is 
natural for Uzbekistan to continue its firmly established ties 
with these republics, for instance with Russia. The economic 
ties between China and Uzbekistan are also developing normally. 
The PRC is intending to render humanitarian assistance for 
saving the Aral and henceforth, it intends to develop 
cooperation in all spheres, emphasized the esteemed guest. 
  At the end of the talks, the document signing ceremony was 
held. Interstate agreements on credits, economic cooperation 
between Uzbekistan and China, and establishing aviation links 
between the two countries were signed. Khalilov, Supreme 
Council acting chairman; Mutalov, prime minister; Aziz Khojayev, 
state adviser to the president; Sultanov [words indistinct] 
Usmanov, deputy prime ministers; Saidkasymov, foreign minister; 
Fazylbekov, Hakim, of Tashkent city and other official figures, 
and also Guan Hengguang, PRC extraordinary and plenipotentiary 
ambassador, participated in the expanded talks and the signing 
ceremony. 
  After signing the documents, Islam Karimov and Li Peng met 
with journalists and answered questions. In the second half of 
the day, a meeting was held between the Li Peng, PRC State 
Council premier, and the peoples deputies in the hall of the 
Supreme Council of the Republic of Uzbekistan. [passage omitted]

Affairs in Tallinn on 19 April: "Statement in Connection With 
the Situation in Bosnia" -- received via Internet E-LIST] 
  [Text] The Foreign Ministry of the Republic of Estonia 
expresses its concern in connection with the increased military 
activity in Bosnia. The Foreign Ministry condemns the actions 
of the Serbian armed forces in Bosnia, which are aimed against 
the United Nations peacekeeping forces and against the "safe 
areas" declared by the UN Security Council. By ignoring 
decisions of the UN Security Council and earlier cease-fire 
agreements, the Serbs in Bosnia set themselves against the 
international community. 
  The Foreign Ministry of the Republic of Estonia greatly 
respects the UN decision to create "safe areas" and expresses 
its dissatisfaction over the fact that agreements achieved 
during the peace process are not being lived up to. This is one 
more indication that the world organization must take even more 
decisive steps to prevent the spread of the conflict and to 
achieve a general cease-fire in Bosnia.

<F P=106> [From 19 April PEVALEHT, p.1; "News Bulletin" No. 74/94] </F>
  [Text] U.S. Minister of Defence William Perry described 
Estonia as a model of success at his meeting with Prime Minister 
Mart Laar yesterday. The meeting concerned Estonia's main 
foreign political problems -- the Russian troops withdrawal and 
the U.S. support to the move, Laar told the "Voice of America." 
Defence Minister Perry stressed that the United States will not 
be dictated by anyone, how far it can support Estonia in 
security matters, Laar said. 
  The security cooperation will include the strengthening of 
the border guard, the forming of the Baltic peacekeeping 
battalion, equipping the Defence Forces, measures within the 
"Partnership for Peace" programme and involving Estonian reserve 
officers of the U.S. armed forces in the training of the 
Estonian troops. 
  Laar also met Assistant Secretary of State Strobe Talbott 
and 
political aids to the Secretary of State Peter Tarnoff and 
addressed the Carnegie International Foundation. 
  He is to meet Vice President Al Gore today and to sign two 
important economic agreements which are expected to increase 
U.S. investments in Estonia. 
  MP Viktor Niitsoo expressed his concern with the premier's 
visit, reminding that Latvia had signed the harmful agreement 
with Russia after the visit of the Latvian premier to the United 
States. "I believe that our head of government, the government 
and the Riigikogu [parliament], supported by the people, remain 
firm and will not allow any obligations to Russian bases or 
retired military be imposed on Estonia," Niitsoo said. 
  MP K. Jaak Roosaare claimed at yesterday's demonstration at 
the Russian naval HQ that the United States intend to donate 10 
million dollars worth of military aid to Estonia in 1995. 
Roosaare referred to a "reliable U.S. Administration official" 
he had met at his recent visit there.

  [Text] Tallinn, Apr 19, BNS -- Estonian Prime Minister 
Mart Laar, on a visit to the United States, met with Defense 
Secretary William Perry in Washington Monday [19 April]. 
  The U.S. Defense Secretary at the meeting reaffirmed 
America's support to the demand that Russian troops be pulled 
out from Estonia, Laar said in an interview with the Voice of 
America later that day. 
  "At the same time William Perry underscored that the United 
States won't let anybody tell to what extent it should support 
Estonia over defense issues and how far to go in the bilateral 
cooperation," the Estonian leader said, adding that the main 
part of the meeting had been a constructive exchanging of 
opinions on how this bilateral cooperation is to proceed. 
  Laar said the United States has plans to assist Estonia in 
strengthening the country's border guard structures, as well as 
to work closely under the Partnership for Peace program and in 
setting up a Baltic peacekeeping battalion. 
  The PAEVALEHT newspaper in Tallinn reports that Laar also 
met 
with Vice-Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, and Peter Tarnoff, 
aide to the Secretary of State on political issues. The 
Estonian prime minister made a speech at the Carnegie 
International Peace Foundation. 
  Laar and Vice President Al Gore at a meeting today were 
scheduled to sign two agreements in the field of economy. 
  Laar is also to meet congressmen, representatives of the 
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The agenda of 
Laar's visit further includes trips to New York, Boston and 
Chicago. The Estonian leader is scheduled to read a lecture on 
Estonia at Harvard University. 
  The prime minister's delegation includes Foreign Ministry 
Chancellor Indrek Tarand, a personal secretary to the prime 
minister, Toomas Kiho. Ardo Hansson, adviser to the Estonian 
government, is to join later. 
  Laar is scheduled to return to Estonia on Apr. 25.

  [Text] Tallinn, Apr 16, BNS -- Estonia has put its full 
support behind Latvia's position that negotiations between 
Latvia and Russia cannot continue before the President Yeltsin 
has officially revoked his April 5 decree on setting up Russian 
military bases in CIS and Latvia, Estonian Prime Minister Mart 
Laar said after a meeting with his Latvian counterpart Valdis 
Birkavs in the Latvian town of Rujiena near the border between 
the two countries. 
  Russia by now has said that mentioning Latvia in the decree 
had been an oversight and that no Russian military bases are to 
be set up in Latvia. Russia has also defined the Skrunda radar 
base as a civilian facility. 
  Laar in an interview with BNS said that the situation of 
Latvia and Russia after the Yeltsin decree has changed and that 
resuming negotiations between the two countries cannot be talked 
about until Yeltsin has "clearly and unambiguously" revoked his 
decree. 
  Latvian Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs at a press conference 
after the meeting said changes are to be made, though, in the 
agreement concluded between Latvia and Russia at the governments 
level on the social protection of retired Russian military. 
  Birkavs said his country's position on the issue was that 
all 
retired military under 60 years of age have to leave Latvia. A 
special foundation for this is to be set up, he added. 
  The premier said about 8,500 retired Russian military under 
60 are currently living in Latvia without having the country's 
citizenship. 
  The two prime ministers discussed Estonian-Russian relations 
and working closely between Estonia and Latvia in international 
organizations. The Estonian leader reaffirmed his country's 
position of not to go to any concessions at talks with Russia. 
  "Estonia won't back even a single step and will abide by the 
existing laws," he said. 
  The meeting also discussed signing an additional protocol on 
farm products exports to the Estonian-Latvian free trade treaty. 
The issue is to be again discussed at a meeting of experts from 
the two countries in the Latvian capital in the middle of the 
next month. 
  While discussing the customs issues, the Latvian premier 
said 
that the Baltics must do everything to cut back to a minimum the 
tariffs on the borders between the three countries and step up 
controls on the eastern border instead. 
  Other topics on the meeting's agenda included the borders, 
and marking down of the land border. The prime ministers 
considered the possibility to temporarily suspend marking the 
border between the countries for a high cost of the work. 
  The delegations for Friday's talks included foreign 
ministers 
Juri Luik and Georgs Andrejevs. 
  The prime ministers of Estonia and Latvia are next scheduled 
to meet in Tallinn in the first half of June.

  [Text] Tallinn, Apr 19, BNS -- The opposition Centrist 
faction in the Estonian parliament today submitted to the 
legislative body a draft decision on setting up a new 10-member 
delegation for the country's talks with Russia. 
  The draft foresees that nominations for the new delegation 
would come from the parliament speaker's office within five days 
after adoption of the decision by the legislative body. 
  The same draft proposes to the government to recall the 
current governmental delegation for the Russian talks after the 
setup of the new delegation is approved. 
  Centrist faction members say their move was called by the 
talks between Estonia and Russia having run into a deadlock, 
which, they say, is caused by the Estonian delegation's 
unclearly determined status, lack of authority and of flexible 
tactics, as well as by insufficient preparedness. 
  The opposition politicians point at what they call dangerous 
tendencies for Estonia at the talks, where the border issue is 
being resolved by ignoring Estonia's interests, concessions are 
made as to the fate of the retired Russian military, and that 
the agreements already signed may "provide for the remaining of 
a part of the Russian army in Estonia for another three years." 
  The Centrist faction says the new delegation should receive 
its powers from the parliament. It must include people who 
"know Russia," today's statement says. 
  Centrist Party member Hardo Aasmae in his comments to BNS 
called the tactics used by the current delegation wrong. He 
said the delegations at the talks should start from decisions 
over which a compromise is possible. A moratorium should be 
imposed on other issues so far, Aasmae added. 
  He said it is most important at present to reach an accord 
with Russia on the troop withdrawal, establish the status of 
Paldiski without letting it be declared a special area, as well 
as to resolve a number of economic issues. 
  Aasmae suggested that Endel Lippmaa, a minister for Eastern 
relations without portfolio in the government of the country's 
former Prime Minister Edgar Savisaar, should be appointed the 
head of the delegation. Savisaar is the leader of the Centrist 
Party. 
  "A situation has emerged currently at the Estonian-Russian 
talks when virtually no political delegation exists; there are 
only work groups. This provides to Russia the possibility to 
use protraction diplomacy. If we manage to set up a broad-based 
political delegation, it must above all make changes happen in 
the Russian delegation and its powers," Aasmae said. 
  He said a breakthrough at the talks will come when one of 
the 
parties is put in a situation when it is no longer possible to 
postpone decision.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: Compiled by </F>
Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy; Edited by Vladimir 
Shishlin] 
  [Text] Head of State Geydar Aliyev told a meeting of the 
presidential staff that the Armenian offensive which began in 
the Karabakh conflict zone straight after the CIS summit in 
Moscow was "the worst of recent times." The president said "the 
character of the offensive proved that the Armenians are 
receiving outside help." 
  The Azerbaijani leader considers the fact that the Armenian 
attack began the day after the meeting of heads of states in 
Moscow was proof that the negotiations process was being used as 
a tactic to "prepare and step up aggression." 
  Aliyev pointed out that the "Azerbaijani army was doing more 
than ever before to rebuff the aggressor." 
  The president again called for stronger measures to defend 
the republic. He had in mind the radical upgrading of army 
discipline above all. He said the military enlistment offices 
in all districts should improve and resolve all aspects 
concerning the army call up. He referred to the many signals 
received on serious irregularities in that area, and said there 
would be a presidential decree to merge the three heads of the 
district military enlistment offices. The defense minister 
would, under the document, be instructed to send military 
commissioners guilty of irregularities to the front line and 
demote them. 
  The Azerbaijani leader said that henceforth all personnel 
issues connected with the activities of enlistment offices would 
be resolved by the presidential staff on presentation by the 
defense minister. He requested the state councillor for 
military affairs to assess the suitability of personnel in the 
enlistment offices within a ten-day period. 
  Aliyev announced that from now the local departments of 
power 
ministries in districts would be subordinate to local heads of 
administration. 
  The president stressed that Baku would still use every 
opportunity to settle the conflict peacefully. 
  As had been announced at the meeting of the heads of states 
in Moscow, a four-party meeting had been planned on Moscow's 
initiative with the presidents of Russia, Armenia and Azerbaijan 
and Robert Kocharian, the chairman of the Nagorno-Karabakh 
Defense Committee, who was also in the Russian capital while the 
summit was being held. However, the Armenia-Azerbaijan meeting 
did not take place due to disagreements surrounding the 
settlement plan for the Karabakh conflict. 
  One top member official in Aliyev's staff told INTERFAX that 
the meeting of the CIS heads of state in Moscow on April 15 had 
been marked by increased political pressure from both Russia and 
Armenia on Azerbaijan with a view to securing the latter's 
consent to the Russian initiatives. 
  INTERFAX's interviewee said that the Russian side had hinted 
that if Russia's plan was not accepted, "Azerbaijan could lose a 
few more districts." 
  The official did say that Baku's official line on the Moscow 
initiative was "by and large positive." However, he stressed 
that the Moscow plan would be fully accepted only in the event 
demands for the release of Azerbaijani territories seized and 
the return of refugees, to Nagorno-Karabakh, Shusha and Lachin 
in particular (the latter are towns in Nagorno-Karabakh which 
were populated by Azerbaijanis before seizure by Armenian 
soldiers) be satisfied. The official pointed out that the 
Russian plan lacked any reference to the return of refugees to 
these populated areas. 
  He concluded that the CIS summit in Moscow had demonstrated 
yet again that "Azerbaijan must rely on its own strength to free 
occupied territories." 
  (INTERFAX Note: Levon Zubranian, advisor to the Armenian 
president, is of the view that the CIS summit in Moscow on April 
15 provided an "excellent chance to achieve peace in Nagorny 
Karabakh which, regrettably, was lost through Azerbaijan's own 
fault." He continued: "If Azerbaijan were to accept Russia's 
peace initiative, each party to the conflict would receive what 
it wants: Armenia the lifting of road blocks, Nagorno-Karabakh 
the guarantee of safety for its population and Azerbaijan its 
territory." The advisor assumed that Azerbaijan's rejection of 
the Russian option for settling the conflict was proof of the 
desire of the Azerbaijani party "to achieve a settlement by 
force.")

  [Text] Baku, April 18, TURAN--Since the beginning of the 
Moscow summit of the CIS leaders on 15 April, Armenian armed 
forces have launched a large-scale attack in the direction of 
the northern and north-eastern sections of Azerbaijan with the 
intent of occupying the main sections of the Geranboyskiy 
[Shaumyanovskiy] and Terterskiy regions of Azerbaijan. This 
attack was directed towards Ganja, Azerbaijan's second largest 
city as well as towards the southern section of the front with 
the seizure of the city of Beylagan. TURAN was informed by a 
government official who requested anonymity. 
  The Azeri leadership thinks that this military plan is aimed 
at destabilizing the situation in Azerbaijan, thereby compelling 
Baku to agree to the Russian proposal concerning the 
Armenian-Azeri conflict. It is widely known that the main terms 
of the proposal is the stationing of the Russian army in the 
conflict zone. 
  During the Moscow Summit government officials of Armenia 
told 
Azeri President Aliev that "the Russian army's deployment in the 
region of conflict will guarantee a ceasefire." 
  This statement made by the Armenian officials coincides with 
the statement made by Kazimirov, the representative of the 
Russian president for the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict which is 
pushing for a Russian peacemaking force role in the region. 
  It is widely known that Baku insists that the separation 
forces should consist of international units and act on the 
basis of United Nations and the CSCE mandate.

<F P=106> [Interview with Iranian Ambassador to Azerbaijan 'Ali Akbar </F>
Nahavandian by Gulsafa Ahmadova;date and place not 
given--recorded; first paragraph is introduction] 
  [Text] Following Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev's 
televised address to the nation [on 12 April], the people, 
various international organizations, and foreign embassies in 
Baku have declared that they are not indifferent to Armenia's 
aggressive policy. Our correspondent Gulsafa Ahmadova 
interviewed the Iranian Ambassador to Azerbaijan 'Ali Akbar 
Nahavandian for our program: 
  [Ahmadova] In his address to the nation, the republic's 
president, Geydar Aliyev, called on international organizations 
and neighboring states to express their firm stance and views on 
ending the recently intensified aggression by Armenia. 
  [Nahavandian] In the name of God, the merciful, the 
compassionate. Yes, both sides asked for the views of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran. The Islamic Republic of Iran has 
exerted efforts on this issue and, as you will remember, our 
foreign minister, Dr. 'Ali Akbar Velayati, has worked hard on 
this case. Deputy Foreign Minister Mahmud Va'ezi visited and 
held talks in Azerbaijan, Armenia and this region for a month. 
But regrettably, at that time certain forces both in Azerbaijan 
and Armenia were waging a political struggle against their own 
people and used the sacrifice the people's lives and their 
countries' stability for their own political interests. And so 
those endeavors got no results. 
  There would have been fewer losses had there been peace two 
or three years ago. This war should end peacefully, but it 
should be a just peace, that is, these aggressive forces should 
withdraw from the territory they have occupied. I think that 
violations of borders and changing of geographical boundaries 
should definitely not take place in our era. Therefore, from 
the very first day the Islamic Republic of Iran has opposed this 
aggression, issued many statements against it, announced its 
firm position on it, and proposed to constrain this aggression. 
It will continue doing so.

<F P=106> [Interview with Arkadiy Gukasyan, Nagorno-Karabakh Republic </F>
foreign minister, by Igor Lenskiy; date, place not given: 
"Safety Fuse of the Unrecognized"] 
  [Text] [Lenskiy] How is Karabakh, with its 150,000-strong 
population, opposing 7 million-strong Azerbaijan? 
  [Gukasyan] Have you seen the movie "300 Spartans"? Then you 
will understand. There are several factors which explain the 
Karabakh phenomenon. The main thing is that we know what we are 
fighting for. We have nowhere to retreat to, we have no other 
land. Every inhabitant of Karabakh understands that if he loses 
heart, tomorrow he will not have either a home or a family. We 
are being confronted by Azerbaijanis who are being brought by 
force to the front from Baku, Sumgait, and Kirovabad. They 
personally do not need Karabakh at all, they are waiting for a 
suitable moment to desert from the army... 
  So you should not put our successes down to Armenia's 
support. 
  [Lenskiy] Where are you getting your weapons from? 
  [Gukasyan] We are grateful to Azerbaijan for punctilious 
"supplies." Eighty percent are trophies. We buy the rest. 
Where, from whom, and how much for -- these are just details. 
  [Lenskiy] Arkadiy, are you received by officials in Moscow? 
After all, the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic is not recognized by 
Russia.... 
  [Gukasyan] Allow me to make no comment. If I answer, they 
will immediately stop receiving me. 
  [Lenskiy] Last fall direct Azerbaijani-Karabakh talks began 
in Moscow. How long did they last? 
  [Gukasyan] Yes, I conducted a dialogue with A. Dzhalilov, 
deputy chairman of the Azerbaijani Supreme Soviet. 
Unfortunately after H. Aliyev was officially elected president, 
direct contacts came to an end. 
  [Lenskiy] You have just come back from Prague, where talks 
are going on within the framework of the CSCE. Has any progress 
been made? 
  [Gukasyan] To be honest, progress has been insignificant. 
We reached agreement on confidence-building measures toward a 
cease-fire. 
  [Lenskiy] And what about the actual cease-fire? After all, 
this was envisaged in the February agreements at the 
quadrilateral talks at the Russian Federation Ministry of 
Defense. Even the date was named -- as of 1 March.... 
  [Gukasyan] The agreements were not implemented. Primarily 
because Azerbaijan does not agree to the plan proposed by Russia 
to bring peacekeeping forces into the dividing zone. 
  [Lenskiy] Let us suppose that Azerbaijan agrees to this 
plan. In that eventuality, are you prepared to give up the 
seized territories beyond Nagorno-Karabakh? 
  [Gukasyan] We do not claim Azerbaijani land. However, we 
will not retreat from the occupied positions until the 
irreversibility of the peace process is guaranteed. We must be 
sure that we will not be subjected to a blockade again and that 
communications will be opened. Our principle is: "No" to a 
cease-fire without the presence of independent observers, and 
"no" to the withdrawal of troops without the stationing of 
peacekeeping forces. 
  [Lenskiy] Is the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic a democratic 
state? 
  [Gukasyan] We have all the attributes of power. We have a 
Supreme Council elected by the people, a government, and laws, 
and a draft Constitution is being prepared. However, while war 
continues, all the strands of administration are concentrated in 
the State Defense Committee, as was the case in the USSR during 
the Great Patriotic War.... Kolkhozes and sovkhozes have even 
been preserved in Karabakh. We think that these forms are 
optimum. 
  [Lenskiy] What currency do you have? 
  [Gukasyan] We are open to all currencies. The ruble, 
dirham, dollar.... We are not even opposed to the Azerbaijani 
manat. 
  [Lenskiy] Are there any non-Armenian inhabitants left in 
Karabakh? 
  [Gukasyan] Yes, there are Russians, Ukrainians, Greeks, Jews 
-- altogether they make up around 7,000-8,000 people. It must 
be borne in mind that when part of Karabakh was controlled by 
Azerbaijan, a lot of Russians were deported. 
  [Lenskiy] What is your attitude to the national liberation 
struggle of the Abkhazian people? 
  [Gukasyan] You may see this as a joke or else as something 
serious, but an original idea once came into my head: To create 
a Union of Unrecognized States. After all, by and large we have 
one aim -- to live as we want. So that the states into which 
attempts are being made to incorporate us by force should not 
impose their will on us. Of course, we sympathize with the 
sentiments of Abkhazia, the Dniester Region, and Crimea. We 
have the appropriate contacts. If the occasion arises we can 
advance in a single diplomatic front. 
  [Lenskiy] Is Karabakh's future within Armenia? 
  [Gukasyan] I see the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic as an 
independent state. Although I do not rule out a situation 
whereby Karabakh may become part of Armenia. 
<H5>  Meanwhile... </H5>
  The CIS heads of state have adopted a protocol decision at a 
meeting in Moscow, which, on behalf of the CIS, transfers to the 
Russian peacekeeping initiative the mandate for the settlement 
of the conflict over Karabakh.

<F P=106> [Passages in quotation marks recorded] </F>
  [Text] [Announcer] President of Latvia Guntis Ulmanis spoke 
on national radio and television on Tuesday evening. First of 
all Guntis Ulmanis once more emphasized the prerogatives of his 
action as state president: 
  [Ulmanis] "This evening I will speak about our country's 
foreign policy. A person thinks little about it every day, and 
still less tries to associate himself directly with the 
settlement of foreign policy issues. Right after being elected 
to the post of president, I said that the priorities of my work 
in foreign policy are linked with Baltic unity and relations 
with Russia, although even at that time, half a year ago, I 
understood that they would not be easy priorities, especially 
where Russia is concerned. Yet today we have come to confront 
problems from which we cannot retreat, but forward movement 
demands certain sacrifices." 
  [Announcer] Continuing his address, the president stated his 
attitude to the agreements initialled on 15 March by Russia and 
Latvia. 
  [Ulmanis] "I would like to express my stance on the issues 
all the more because, as our philosopher Vilnis Zarins said in 
his letter to me, when a decision is taken, one must stick to it 
strictly and unflichingly, knowing that one will be cursed 
anyway. At this moment I defend the creation of active and 
energetic relations with Russia. I mean here to their full 
extent, in both political and economic relations, because 
obviously, as a result of a passive foreign policy, we will be 
the losers, just as this would also create economic 
impoverishment for our nation. In relations between countries, 
especially if their border is long and their forces unequal, the 
only way is to draw closer, to understand, to be farsighted, to 
seek compromise, at length, patiently, both gaining and losing." 
  [Announcer] Speaking about the possible meeting of the two 
countries' leaders, which may take place on 21 April, Guntis 
Ulmanis said: 
  [Ulmanis] "I call on the Russian president to seek ways to 
make it possible for the Latvian and Russian presidents to meet. 
This morning I invited Aleksandr Rannikh, ambassador 
extraordinary and plenipotentiary of Russia to Latvia, for a 
conversation, and I put to him a proposal to meet the Russian 
president. I also received the same kind of proposal from 
Yeltsin's side. Perhaps a coincidence? I think not. It is 
necessary to openly state one's views, about the possible 
signing or non-signing of the initialled agreements; to achieve 
clarity about the announced creation of a military base in 
Latvia, at Skrunda; and to try to draw a line over the heavy 
injustices of history relating to the occupation of independent 
Latvia in 1940 and communist genocide in 1941 and later years. 
I will call on President Yeltsin to seek opportunities to 
settle our mutual relations as equal sovereign neighbors, and to 
cease putting forward pretexts for not talking to us, or for 
talking on from positions of power." 
  [Announcer] The president also expressed his prognosis on 
how 
the possible meeting of the two presidents will go. 
  [Ulmanis] "I will speak in favor of signing three 
agreements, 
at the same time creating a group of experts to specify the 
basis of the fourth agreement, on the social guarantees for the 
remaining military personnel and their families. In the form 
that this agreement currently takes, in my opinion it is not 
acceptable to the majority of the people, not acceptable to me 
personally either. In my opinion Latvia and Russia must 
continue to seek the way of mutual understanding, so as to 
achieve at government level agreement on the future destiny of 
retired military personnel, in the next 10 days." 
  [Announcer] Concluding his speech, the Latvian president 
once 
more commented on his recent visit to three western European 
countries in the context of the initialled interstate agreements: 
  [Ulmanis] "I will not be able to understand my people if I 
do 
not regularly meet people in towns and in the country in Latvia. 
But in turn the world will not recognise Latvia, its people, if 
we do not talk about it in other countries, if we are unable to 
show Europe the force of the spirit of the Latvian people, its 
love of work, and its enterprise. Within the Latvian 
constitution, this is first the president's duty, and I will 
fulfill it too. 
  "The important issues we spoke about with politicians in 
three foreign countries: The guarantees that Europe can give 
Latvia, and to what extent Latvia for its part is able to fulfil 
the demands put by Europe; the creation of a repatriation fund, 
to promote the departure of retired military personnel from 
Latvia; the status of the Skrunda radar station, and the 
negative effects of its operation on people and nature in 
Kurzeme; and the last thing we talked about: What are really the 
opportunities for the Latvian people and prospects for 
strengthening Latvian statehood. 
  "On all these issues, in my opinion, a certain understanding 
was reached. Security is to the greatest extent dependent on 
how we strengthen the unity of the three Baltic countries and 
create relations with Russia. By signing agreements with 
Russia, an opportunity will open up to put Latvian-Russian 
relations in order, in the first place making them subject to 
international controls. I am fully aware of my responsibility 
for what happens to the Latvian nation tomorrow. I said that 
when meeting in Europe, seeking the support and understanding of 
Denmark, France, and Britain. And everywhere I received an 
unequivocal response: Europe will not abandon the Baltic lands 
any more. 1939 must not be repeated." 
  [Announcer] As Latvian radio has already reported, on 
Tuesday 
when the president met with leaders of factions in the Saeima, 
Guntis Ulamnis received support for talks with Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin. However, a final decision on the status of this 
meeting -- whether it will only be talks or whether there will 
be a signing of agreement -- will be taken by deputies at the 
extraordinary plenary sitting of the Saeima on Wednesday.

  [Text] At the invitation of State President Guntis Ulmanis, 
Aleksandr Rannikh, Russian ambassador extraordinary and 
plenipotentiary to Latvia, today met the Latvian president. The 
ambassador orally conveyed Russian President Yeltsin's 
invitation for the Latvian president to pay a working visit to 
Moscow on 21 April and to sign earlier initialled agreements. 
  Our president expressed his thanks for the invitation, 
explaining that he considers such a visit to be useful because 
there are many issues concerning Latvian-Russian relations which 
need to be clarified, especially those related to the order of 5 
April. 
  Talks with Boris Yeltsin at which an exchange of opinions 
and 
coordination of views concerning the initialled agreements and 
the prospects for future relations between Latvia and Russia 
would have great significance on the international scale. 
  The Latvian president recalled that the Saeima will discuss 
the possibility of signing the agreements at tomorrow's 
extraordinary plenary session. 
  The situation in the countries of the former USSR and the 
latest events on the territory of former Yugoslavia may also be 
discussed at the talks with the Russian president. 
  A reply from the Latvian state president on his possible 
visit to Moscow will be given to the Russian ambassador later 
today.

  [Text] Riga, Apr 18, BNS -- Latvian Saeima (parliament) 
Deputy Speaker Andrejs Krastins met on Monday [18 April] with 
U.S. State Department's political experts Julie Cohen, Martin 
Schwartz and U.S. Embassy in Latvia Secretary Scott Dean. 
  The group discussed relations between Latvia and Russia and 
problems related to Latvia's draft citizenship law. 
  Krastins also pointed to shortcomings in the initialed 
Latvian- Russian agreements on troop withdrawal. 
  The package fails to demand compensation for Russian damages 
to Latvia, allows Russian forces to retain ownership rights on 
real estate and tolerates foundation of Latvian-Russian joint 
ventures on the basis of former military installations, said 
Krastins. 
  Krastins reiterated that Latvia is interested to receive 
international guarantees for the process of the signature of the 
troop withdrawal package and the control of its implementation. 
  Dean voiced his country's support for the conclusion of an 
interstate agreement that would fully resolve the issue of 
Russian troop withdrawal from Latvia.

<F P=106> ["Quadrilateral Agreement on the Voluntary Return of </F>
Refugees and Displaced Persons," signed in Moscow on 4 April] 
  [Text] The Abkhazian and Georgian sides, henceforth to be 
called the "sides," and the Russian Federation and the UN High 
Commissioner for Refugees, 
  Referring to Security Council Resolutions 849 of 9 July 
1993, 
854 of 6 August 1993, 858 of 24 August 1993, 876 of 19 October 
1993, 881 of 4 November 1993, 892 of 22 December 1993, and 896 
of 31 January 1994, 
  Recognize that the right of every citizen to live in the 
country of his origin and to return there is embodied in the 
Universal Declaration on Human Rights and the International Pact 
on Civil and Political Rights, 
  Take into account the 18th (XXXI) and 40th (XXXVI) [Roman 
numerals as published] conclusions of the executive committee of 
the UN High Commissioner's program that represent 
internationally agreed principles regulating the repatriation of 
refugees, 
  Act in accordance with the Memorandum on Understanding 
signed 
by the sides on 1 December 1993, in particular Point 4, in which 
the sides declared that they were ready to create conditions for 
the voluntary, safe, and dignified return of displaced persons 
to their permanent places of residence in all regions of 
Abkhazia, 
  Recall that, in accordance with the UN General Assembly 
Resolution 428 (V) of 14 December 1950, in which the regulations 
of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees were ratified, the high 
commissioner assumes the functions of ensuring the international 
protection of refugees and searching for ways aimed at the final 
solution of refugees' problems, in particular by encouraging and 
facilitating their voluntary repatriation, 
  Recall the obligations incumbent upon the UN High 
Commissioner for Refugees to act under the guidance of the 
secretary general as the leading international institution for 
the repatriation of displaced persons to Abkhazia, 
  Point out the desire of the sides to cooperate with one 
another in order to ensure full protection of the principles and 
guarantees for voluntary repatriation, 
  Take into account, in this connection, the necessity of 
forming bases for determining the conditions for such 
cooperation in order to carry out the repatriation, 
  Point out that, upon the agreement of the sides, the 
repatriation operation in Abkhazia envisages that, prior to its 
implementation, safety and living conditions should be 
guaranteed in the regions to which refugees will be returning, 
  Have agreed to the following: 
  1. The sides agree to cooperate and act together on planning 
and implementing measures aimed at ensuring the safe, peaceful, 
and dignified return of those persons to their permanent places 
of residence who left the conflict zone. 
  2. In accordance with the aim of this agreement, the sides 
ensure the safety of refugees and displaced persons during 
voluntary repatriation and rehabilitation operations. 
  3. During the implementation of this voluntary repatriation 
program, the sides undertake to uphold the following principles: 
  a) Displaced persons and refugees have the right to return 
voluntarily to their places of origin or residence irrespective 
of their ethnic, social, or political affiliation in conditions 
of complete safety, freedom, and dignity; 
  b) The voluntary nature of the repatriation is determined 
and 
ensured by the corresponding agreements; 
  c) Displaced persons and refugees have the right to return 
peacefully without risk of arrest, detention, imprisonment or 
criminal prosecution. 
  Such immunity does not extend to persons in the event of 
there being serious signs that: 
  They have committed a military offense or an offense against 
the person, as this is determined in international documents; or 
they have committed a serious criminal offense or earlier 
participated in military actions and currently belong to armed 
formations that are preparing for military actions in Abkhazia; 
  Persons belonging to these categories should be informed 
through the corresponding channels as to what consequences they 
can expect to face on their return; 
  d) The sides ensure that refugees, on their return, have the 
right of free movement and settlement, including in those 
regions where they used to live before they left the conflict 
zone or in regions of their own choice; 
  e) The sides ensure that refugees and displaced persons, on 
their return, will extend or renew their passports and 
registration. These documents will be valid for their previous 
place of residence or that place to which they choose to return; 
  f) The sides ensure that persons, on their return, will be 
protected from persecution, including the payment of 
unsanctioned taxes or dues and threats to their life and 
property; 
  g) On their return, persons will be given back the movable 
or 
immovable property that they abandoned or will be given help to 
retrieve it. Otherwise, the value of the lost property should 
be given as compensation as far as this is possible. 
  The commission mentioned in Point 5 will create a mechanism 
for settling such demands. Such compensation should be provided 
within the framework of reconstruction and restoration programs 
that will be implemented with the financial support of the UN 
voluntary fund. 
  h) Displaced persons and refugees who do not plan to return 
to Abkhazia will receive the same assistance and protection 
until acceptable alternative solutions are found regarding these 
cases; 
  i) In accordance with the fundamental principle of 
preserving the unity of the family, if it is not possible to 
repatriate all family members, mechanisms for uniting them will 
be created in Abkhazia. In addition, measures will be 
implemented to seek out adolescents left without a guardian and 
other persons in a vulnerable [motsqvlad] state during the 
repatriation process and additional support and help will be 
given to them. 
  j) The sides agree that guarantees will be given for 
refugees 
and displaced persons to receive without any hindrance all 
current information on the situation in the repatriation 
regions; such information should be given within the framework 
of a campaign that will be organized by the commission, as 
stated in Point 9 (b). 
  4. In order to implement the voluntary return of displaced 
persons and refugees in accordance with this agreement, a 
quadrilateral commission will be formed. 
  5. The main tasks of the commission are to elaborate, 
discuss, and approve plans for implementing the safe, orderly, 
and voluntary repatriation of refugees and displaced persons and 
also their successful reintegration. The commission will also 
establish the rules of procedure for controlling the application 
and implementation of Point 3 (c). Such plans should include 
registration, transportation, basic material assistance within 
six months, and help with rehabilitation. 
  In order to guarantee the conditions for the return of 
refugees and displaced persons, the commission will form a 
working group of experts that will assess the amount of damage 
done to the economic and social infrastructure in Abkhazia, the 
existence of homes in the regions to which refugees will be 
returning, and the level of need regarding rehabilitation and 
restoration together with the financial consequences proceeding 
from this. This research should be organized consecutively -- 
region by region -- in accordance with the plan for return that 
has been coordinated and approved by the sides, taking into 
account that the sides have agreed that the repatriation will 
commence in Gali rayon. 
  6. The commission is composed of four members, one each from 
the sides, the Russian Federation, and the UN High Commissioner 
for Refugees. 
  In addition, the CSCE will appoint a representative who will 
participate in the meetings of the commission as an observer. 
If circumstances prevent the appointed representative from 
being present at such meetings, the commission will regularly 
supply information on the progress of the commission's work to 
the CSCE mission in Georgia. 
  7. Any committee member participating in any committee 
meeting can be accompanied by such advisers whose presence is 
considered necessary by the side that has appointed this member. 
In such cases, when this or that commission member is unable to 
participate in any meeting of the commission, the corresponding 
side can appoint a replacement. 
  8. Meetings of the commission will be held when necessary 
but not more than once a month. Meetings of the commission may 
be convened at the request of any member and it will be held on 
the territory of the Russian Federation except in those cases 
when commission members are able to agree to something else. 
The sides agree to ensure the personal security of commission 
members and personnel participating in the implementation of 
measures that have been agreed upon. 
  The date for holding the first meeting of the commission 
should be determined in as short a time as possible but no later 
than one week after the Security Council has adopted a 
resolution on the mechanism that will ensure the safety 
conditions in the regions to which the refugees will be 
returning. 
  9. At its first meeting, the commission will establish the 
procedure for the assessment mentioned in Point 5 and will 
determine a plan concerning: 
  a) The regions where repatriation will be carried out, first 
and foremost, in accordance with the guaranteed security and the 
level of readiness; 
  b) An information campaign among displaced persons and 
refugees aimed at encouraging their voluntary return; 
  c) The process of registering those persons who have 
expressed their readiness to return; 
  d) Measures necessary to ensure the safe return of these 
persons on the basis of the principles that are stipulated in 
Point 3 (a-i); 
  e) The financial and transport needs of displaced persons 
and 
refugees and basic material assistance and also the presumed 
needs regarding rehabilitation and restoration in the places to 
which they will be returning, as indicated in Point 5. 
  10. The sides agree that representatives of the refugees and 
displaced persons should be guaranteed assistance enabling them 
to visit the places to which they will be returning and 
ascertain for themselves what conditions are being created for 
their return. 
  11. If disagreement arises in the commission concerning the 
application or interpretation of this agreement, and when such 
disagreement cannot be resolved in a friendly manner, the 
commission will empower the sides and the Russian Federation and 
also the UN High Commissioner for Refugees to resolve such 
disagreement. 
  The sides, the Russian Federation, and the board of the UN 
High Commissioner for Refugees agree to the following: 
  a) The board of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees will 
be 
able to implement directly and without hindrance measures 
regarding all displaced persons and refugees from Abkhazia that 
are necessary so that it can fulfill its mandate and also its 
operational and surveillance obligations; 
  b) Employees of the UN and other corresponding 
international and nongovernmental institutions who are 
cooperating with the UN on implementation of the repatriation, 
reintegration, and rehabilitation programs will be guaranteed 
freedom of movement between and inside all regions where there 
are refugees and displaced persons and also inside regions to 
which they are returning. This includes the use of air space 
and designated runways and airports for flights so that 
emergency aid can be delivered to displaced persons and refugees 
from Abkhazia, they [the employees] may be exempt from taxes and 
duty on all goods imported for their use within the framework of 
the program of voluntary repatriation and the UN and 
institutions cooperating with it can provide emergency aid to 
the region of Abkhazia for purposes of integration and 
rehabilitation, and also so that such goods can be cleared and 
processed as soon as possible; 
  c) The Russian Federation will ensure the unhindered transit 
of humanitarian aid that is sent through its territory according 
to the aims of this agreement; 
  d) The board of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees will 
set up the necessary local departments in places agreed upon by 
the interested sides in order to facilitate the voluntary 
repatriation and reintegration and rehabilitation; 
  e) The safety of the personnel and property of the UN and 
those institutions cooperating with it will be guaranteed; 
  f) The sides and the UN and institutions cooperating with it 
will be provided with specially established radio frequencies 
that they will be able to use permanently in order to maintain 
radio contact with their departments and vehicles and personnel 
in the regions where there are displaced persons and refugees 
and also in those regions to which they are returning. 
  This agreement comes into force immediately and is valid for 
the period of time that is necessary for the efficient voluntary 
return of displaced persons and refugees. 
  Plenipotentiaries of the Georgian side, the Abkhazian side, 
the Russian Federation, and the UN High Commissioner for 
Refugees have signed this agreement. 
  Concluded in Moscow on 4 April 1994 in four copies, three of 
which are in Russian and one in English; the four are identical 
and the text in English will be used for purposes of 
clarification.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "One More Offer for Talks?"] </F>
  [Text] According to a special report by a JANG 
correspondent, India has invited Pakistan to hold talks at the 
prime minister level. According to the report, the Foreign 
Office received a proposal a few days ago that the next round of 
India-Pakistan talks be held at the prime minister level instead 
of at the foreign secretary level. Pakistan has welcomed this 
proposal conditionally and said that it is ready for the 
proposed dialogue provided the Kashmir issue is placed on the 
top of the agenda. However, available report indicates that 
India wishes to hold discussions only on the Siachen Glacier 
issue. At the same time, New Delhi has also suggested that 
Pakistan should not move any resolution on the Kashmir issue at 
the September session of the UN General Assembly. 
  Talking to the JANG, the Pakistan foreign secretary rightly 
said that our stand on India-Pakistan dialogue is crystal clear. 
We do not have any objection in principle to the talks, but 
India will have to fulfill four preconditions to create a 
conducive atmosphere for the dialogue. The preconditions are: 
India should reduce the number of troops deployed in Kashmir, 
dismantle all the bunkers built by the Indian forces around the 
Hazratbal Shrine, release all the detained Kashmiri leaders, and 
allow the representatives of the international human rights 
organizations to visit occupied Kashmir. The conditions set by 
Pakistan are very appropriate and practicable and any high-level 
dialogue will be useless if these conditions are not met. 
  In the past, Pakistan accepted many Indian proposals and 
held 
negotiations in a spirit of goodwill, but, as everybody knows, 
all those rounds of discussions remained fruitless solely 
because of India's refusal to create even the slightest 
flexibility in its stand on the Kashmir question. Six rounds of 
foreign minister-level talks were held on the Kashmir issue in 
1962. At that time, India agreed to enter into negotiations on 
Kashmir because it was facing enormous pressure due to its 
border war with China and all the Western countries had also 
asked Pakistan not to create more difficulties for India, which, 
as a quid pro quo, would hold talks with Islamabad to resolve 
the Kashmir dispute. The eyes of the entire Western world were 
set on the rounds of discussions that were being held between 
Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto and Sardar Swaran Singh, and there was 
pressure on India to make those talks successful and meaningful. 
Even then, India could not adopt the path of justice and 
propriety. Seven more rounds of foreign secretary-level talks 
have been held in the recent past, but all of them have been 
meaningless. After the three-day talks in January 1994, India 
invited Pakistan to hold another round of dialogue, but Pakistan 
had made it clear that, in spite of being a principled supporter 
of negotiations, it could not go on holding fruitless 
discussions. 
  The Foreign Office has thus far not confirmed the receipt of 
any official invitation from India for the prime minister-level 
talks, but if India is really interested in negotiations, then 
it must, first of all, agree to place the Kashmir issue on the 
top of the agenda of such talks. It must also accept the four 
preconditions set by Pakistan to create a congenial atmosphere 
for the talks, because it is not possible for Pakistan to sit 
around a negotiating table with India while New Delhi continues 
its oppression and atrocities against the Kashmiris. India will 
have to give some proof that it is sincere in holding talks and 
is ready to adopt the path of justice. If the Government of 
Pakistan receives any formal invitation from India for a 
dialogue at any level, then it should remain steadfast on the 
aforementioned preconditions and should not engage itself in 
negotiations that are not going to yield any positive results. 
Likewise, Pakistan should also not give any assurances that it 
will not move any resolution on the Kashmir issue at the next UN 
General Assembly session. India's behavior in the past has not 
left any room for any wishful thinking on our part and we should 
not follow a shadow by continuing the process of fruitless 
negotiations.

  [Text] Islamabad -- Despite a clear-cut Government of 
Pakistan policy to control spill over of Afghan refugees in the 
Federal Capital, refugee population here continues to be on the 
rise. 
  While there is not even a single Afghan refugee formally 
registered in Islamabad, over 30,000 Afghans are estimated to 
have moved into the capital city in the last six months alone. 
  Officials in the Interior Ministry believe that at least 
half 
of the refugees who have moved to Pakistan in the past six 
months are now residing in Islamabad. According to one estimate 
over 60,000 crossed over to Pakistan in the last six months. 
  As a matter of rule new Afghan refugees coming to Pakistan 
are not supposed to go beyond Attack, the Punjabi border town 
next to the NWFP [North-west Frontier Province]. They are 
required to get themselves registered at Commissionerate for 
refugees in Peshawar or at the Commissionerate office in Quetta. 
  To discourage the Afghans from coming to and settling in 
Islamabad, the government has apparently also instructed the 
United Nation's High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) not to 
provide any financial assistance to the new refugee population 
through its offices here. 
  But even this has not stopped the inflow of refugees who 
continue to pour in the Federal Capital. 
  These refugees, mostly Kabulites, are literate and 
well-to-do 
compared to those who fled to Pakistan in the early years of the 
Afghan war. Their resources, however, are limited. After 
exhausting the little finances they have, most turn to the UNHCR 
office here for assistance. 
  At the palatial UNHCR office on the Margalla Road the 
refugees are greeted by a blue notice board put on the wall 
outside. It says: "Notice To All Afghan Refugees. This office 
does not provide financial assistance or resettlement services 
to Afghan refugees." 
  Those who are desperate for help, ignore this notice. They 
plead their case with the man at the main gate who invariably 
directs them to the Chief Commissionerate for Afghan Refugees 
(CCAR) here. He hands them small chits which have the CCAR 
address printed on them. 
  From the CCAR refugees are again turned away without help 
since it is only a policy-making office. 
  Officials at the CCAR maintain that they have categorically 
conveyed it to the UNHCR several times that they are not there 
to assist refugees. Despite repeated messages, these officials 
say, the UNHCR continues to "misdirect" the refugees. 
  When contacted the UNHCR spokesman here told this 
correspondent that the office in Islamabad did not give 
financial or material assistance. This, he said, was in 
compliance with the Pakistan Government's policy. However, he 
added, that the Commission helped the refugees in other ways. 
  "We have a Social Service Section that attends to their 
security needs and also provides medical and legal aid to them," 
the spokesman said. 
  Meanwhile, an average three to four Afghans continue to show 
up at the CCAR in Islamabad. 
  "We want help, protection, and assistance," is usually what 
they have to say. "There are days when even a couple dozen turn 
up," notes an official. "The most striking aspect about them is 
that almost all are sophisticated urbanites, men and women, 
holding professional degrees," he adds. 
  These Afghans are concentrated in the rather thickly 
populated G and I sectors, where accommodation is available at 
relatively lower rents. Numerous apartments and flats in G-8 
Markaz, G-9 and G-10 have been taken by the Afghan urbanites, 
many of whom share them with their relatives and friends. Most 
new entrants have also rented out portions in sectors I-8, I-9 
and I-10. 
  In fact many real estate dealers in Islamabad attribute the 
current level of rents in these areas to the large presence of 
Afghans. "There has been a growing demand for flats and 
portions in the G and I sectors by the Afghans specially in the 
last six months," says a property dealer in G-8 Markaz. 
  Only recently the Federal Interior Minister also noted at a 
televised interview by journalists that house rents had gone up 
because of the Afghan refugees, which he believed was a good 
sign. 
  Like most parts of the G-9 and G-10 Markazes, these refugees 
virtually throng the three weekly bazaars -- Mangal [Tuesday], 
Itwaar [Sunday] and Juma [Friday] -- in G-8 Sector. It is there 
that one actually realises what a large number of Afghans dwell 
in the capital city. Buyers as well as sellers, they dominate 
the scene.

  [Text] Islamabad -- Pakistan on Monday warned the Arab 
nationals, who fought in the Afghan war and are now living in 
NWFP [North-West Frontier Province] to immediately leave the 
country or face severe action. 
  The government has sent a letter to all such organisations 
to 
make sure that all Arabs leave by April 18. Those staying here 
after April 18 May be arrested and the organisations still 
employing them may face punitive action. A govt official said 
about 120 such Arab nationals were still in NWFP, about 80 to 70 
in Peshawar. Most of them are from Egypt, Algeria, Saudi Arabia 
and Tunisia. 
  He said those with valid papers had already been allowed to 
stay, but other would have to go. "We can't allow them to use 
Pakistani territory for carrying out terrorist acts against 
other nations," the official said.

  [Text] Pakistan has appealed for an emergency session of 
the UN Security Council [UNSC] to consider the situation as a 
result of the Serb attack on the besieged Muslim town of Gorazde 
in Bosnia. An official press statement issued in Islamabad says 
that, through Pakistani efforts, a group of nonaligned countries 
have presented a draft resolution in the UN Security Council 
demanding the withdrawal of Serb forces from Gorazde. The draft 
resolution calls upon the UN protection force to use all 
available means, including the use of force, to foil the Serb 
aggression against Gorazde. Pakistan hopes that the members of 
the UN Security Council will discharge their obligation to save 
the people of Goradze from the aggression. They should take 
urgent and concrete steps for the security of the population of 
Gorazde and other UN-protected areas. Pakistan has especially 
appealed to the North Atlantic Council [three preceding words in 
English] to immediately order air action against the Serbs. The 
statement says the government and people of Pakistan are deeply 
anguished by the brutal action and aggression by Serb forces 
against the Muslims of Gorazde.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Gondusov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 19 Apr -- The fact that the leaders of North 
Ossetia and Ingushetia have sat down at the conference table is 
no small contribution of the Russian interior troops who are 
carrying out peacekeeping functions in the region, their 
commander, Colonel General Anatoliy Kulikov believes. He was 
meeting Russian and foreign journalists at a briefing at the 
Russian Internal Affairs Ministry today. 
  Kulikov noted that the presence of the interior troops in 
the 
emergency situation zone has not only stabilized but also, to a 
considerable extent, improved the crime situation. The number 
of people who have been killed in North Ossetia and Ingushetia 
is substantially fewer than in neighboring republics and oblasts 
with the same population, and the crime level is an average of 
20 percent less. 
  Describing the activities of the troops in the hot spot, 
General Kulikov cited the following figures: Last year troop 
details confiscated over 600 fire arms, about 30,000 pieces of 
ammunition, hundreds of grenades and explosives, 16 artillery 
systems and grenade-throwers, and nine armored vehicles. This 
year seven special operations to disarm illegal formations have 
been carried out. The troops' catch includes 62 firearms, over 
240 grenades, mines, and explosive devices, and over 20 kg of 
explosive substances. 
  In the time the troops have been in the emergency situation 
zone over 100 special operations have been carried out in which 
not a single local inhabitant has been killed, Kulikov stressed. 
  Unfortunately, he went on, the servicemen are constantly 
risking their lives in fulfilling combat and service tasks in 
the region. Last year, the temporary quarters of units and 
sub-units and also troop details were subjected to shelling and 
armed attacks on 126 occasions, as a result of which seven 
people were killed and 133 wounded. This year there have 
already been over 20 attacks and shellings. There have been no 
losses among the men of the interior troops.

  [Text] Some of the South Ossetian citizens have taken the 
plans to equip a border post on the Russian-Georgian border as 
an attempt to divide the peoples of North and South Ossetia. 
According to Interfax sources, about 300 citizens of South 
Ossetia (Georgia) have arrived in Vladikavkaz, the capital of 
North Ossetia (Russia) to organize a meeting in front of the 
parliament building. 
  The republic leaders persuaded the demonstrators to move to 
the Art Center and meet with North Ossetian President Akhsarbek 
Galazov. The president said that the most important thing now 
was "to work in order to turn Ossetia into an economically 
mighty country." 
  He also said that the North Ossetian leaders would make 
efforts to ensure that the Russian-Georgian border between South 
and North Ossetia be transparent and never divide the peoples.

<F P=106> [Dmitriy Lukashov report from Kazan under the "Republics" </F>
rubric: "Tatarstan Heading for a Crisis of Authority. 
Government Lacks Economic Program"] 
  [Text] The 19th session of the Tatarstan Supreme Soviet, 
which began in Kazan and whose main agenda item is the adoption 
of the republic's budget for this year, bodes no good for the 
local government. 
  A crisis of nonpayments, which may be even graver than in 
other regions, the pressure of the tax burden, and a nearly 
complete paralysis of oil production -- the main source of 
budget revenues -- have called into question not only the 
viability of much-publicized social programs and the possibility 
of old-style, large-scale assistance to agriculture, but also 
the prudence of the Tatarstan government's economic policy as a 
whole. The opposition, including both the nationalists and the 
federalists, is criticizing the republic's leadership for 
lacking any reform program whatsoever. 
  Moreover, the highest echelons of the republic's power, 
which 
have until recently been considered monolithic, suffered a split 
the other day. First, the policy pursued by the republic's 
leaders was challenged by Rafael Khakimov, President Shaymiyev's 
closest adviser. In an article entitled "A Year of Missed 
Opportunities" he accused the top authorities of "narcissism," 
pointing out that "everything is remarkably nice in our young 
republic. Leaders do not blunder. They sign treaties and 
agreements that the people fully endorse," whereas in Austria, 
"Chancellor Franz Vranitzky asked me how far Tatarstan is from 
Nizhniy Novgorod." In Mr. Khakimov's view, the first reformist 
steps by the republic's government -- the regulation of prices 
instead of "shock therapy," thought-out agricultural policy, and 
social safety nets for specific sectors of the population -- 
were proclaimed reform proper, which actually marked an end to 
it. "At the same time," Mr. Khakimov notes, "the Tatarstan 
government has not explained the essence of the republic's 
economic development model to the population." What he sees as 
the main trouble is that "sovereignty has not yet become...a way 
of life and the government has been hamstrung by `oblast' 
thinking." 
  Mintimer Shaymiyev was swift to counter the charges, and 
presently the institution of presidential advisers in Tatarstan 
has been abolished altogether. 
  The tide of criticism of the republic's economic situation 
has not subsided, however. Tatarstan Deputy Prime Minister 
Ravil Muratov said in an interview for INTERFAX: "We are 
wasting time and missing the chance to complete reform at the 
minimum costs... We are beginning simply to lag behind certain 
regions. The government is undertaking costly social programs.. 
but it does not care very much about finding actual sources of 
financing them, primarily about the budget. Who will pay taxes? 
Enterprises indebted to each other, entrepreneurs crushed by a 
tax burden? Collective and state-owned farms that rely on 
subsidies, most of them money-losing? We have long watched 
Russian reform so as to avoid its mistakes. But by doing so we 
have made those of our own, having failed to work out our 
concept of economic development..." 
  Those responsible for the "idle time" have not been named 
yet, but it is clear that the government officials' criticism is 
directed at Svoboda Square, where the Cabinet of Ministers has 
its seat, not at the Kazan Kremlin, residence of the Tatarstan 
president. Given that rumors about Prime Minister Mukhammat 
Sabirov's resignation have been circulating for a long time now, 
one may surmise that the question will be discussed at the 
parliamentary session that began yesterday. 
  So far, questions concerning the treaty and follow-up 
agreements with the Russian Federation, which were signed in 
February, and the proposal by Deputy Bayramova, leader of the 
nationalist "Ittifak" party, on the discussion of human rights 
violations in the republic, have not been included in the 
session's agenda. 
  Although there have been no proposals to discuss the 
government's report on its last year's performance, the deputies 
will apparently have plenty of opportunities to say aloud 
everything they think on the subject when discussing the report 
on the implementation of Tatarstan's 1993 budget. 
  In addition, the session must consider the president's 
budget 
message for this year. Under the message, the republic's budget 
will amount to 9,124,576 million rubles. At the same time it is 
planned to transfer to the federal budget a total of 847.266 
billion.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Lebedinskiy report: "It Is Harder To Receive </F>
Than to Work"] 
  [Text] Perm Oblast -- An open-ended strike by the miners 
of Kizelovskiy Coalfield in Perm Oblast was to have started 
yesterday. The reason was purely economic -- the nonpayment of 
wages since the beginning of the year. But if their labor is 
not paid for within a week, the miners warned, demands will be 
made that the government should resign and presidential 
elections be held ahead of schedule. 
  The countdown was about to begin, but news spread of 2.7 
billion rubles arriving on time; this should be enough to settle 
accounts with the miners. But only for January. It was decided 
to postpone the strike. Evidently, until this money runs out.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Chernykh report: "Will Swiss Brood Hen Help Out </F>
Siberian Oil Broilers?"] 
  [Text] Tomsk -- The first international tender for 
exploration, prospecting, and development rights to the oil and 
gas deposits in Tomsk Oblast is over. 
  It lasted 18 months, and two contenders came forward just a 
day before the offer to tender expired. This despite the fact 
that a presentation about the tender had been given in the 
United States. There was essentially no choice. The winner was 
a consortium of foreign companies, represented by the Swiss firm 
of "IMEG Management SA." The contenders had proposed conducting 
a full range of work with hydrocarbons over a territory of 2,870 
square kilometers. 
  Just what will the Russian side get in return? If a certain 
level of extraction is achieved, the oblast's social support 
fund will receive $6 million. The minimum expenditure on the 
work over the course of five years is being put at 46 million 
[currency unspecified]. 
  There is another side to things as well. Also taking part in 
the project will be the "Tomskneft" Joint-Stock Company and the 
"Tomskneftegazgeologiya" State Geological Enterprise, both of 
which have been in a difficult economic position. This will 
allow them to step up their search for hydrocarbons and to 
create new jobs. 
  The comprehensive prospecting for oil and gas on a 
contractual basis will make it possible to effectively implement 
the oblast's gas program. The Russian side will receive several 
hundred million dollars in proceeds from the project as a whole. 
And all this through foreign investment, without any spending 
by us. The license agreement should be signed by 1 July this 
year. 
  It is also necessary to elaborate the economic basis of the 
contract in more detail. Then it may be possible to start 
counting our oil "chickens." The results of the first offer to 
tender have also shown that foreigners are in no great hurry to 
invest in the shaky Russian economy. The hopes that the 
tendering commission would be inundated with envelopes bearing 
the logos of the big guns of the international oil business were 
not at all borne out.

  [Text] Novosibirsk -- Two major Novosibirsk banks have 
announced that they are ending operations and proposing that 
clients close their accounts. 
  The first bank to fail -- the "Siberian Development Bank" -- 
has been on its last legs for more than a year. This led to a 
change of management and the attraction of considerable amounts 
of funds to rescue the situation. It did not help. Experts 
believe that the collapse was inevitable. The Novosibirsk 
management of "Mosbiznesbank" lent a hand to their bankrupt 
colleagues. But, naturally, not in the form of money. They 
offered staff from the failed bank jobs at their new branch. 
  The second victim of competition and market conditions has 
been the "Novosibirsk Innovation Commercial Bank."

<F P=106> [Interview with Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk by </F>
unidentified correspondent at ceremony to open a new children's 
clinic in Kiev on 19 April; -- recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [Correspondent] Leonid Makarovych, the paradoxes 
in life today are endless, are they not? Today, the Russian 
press publishes materials on the intention of Ukraine to capture 
Kuban and develop new types of mass destruction weapons, while 
the Ukrainian president is opening a clinic for children. 
  [Kravchuk, laughing] You said it yourself and this is 
paradoxical indeed. Paradoxes in the press -- in this case in 
some of the Russian newspapers -- are, unfortunately, 
paradoxical indeed. I have read this publication today and I am 
under the impression that this is a kind of myth. Somebody 
thought: Why not create a myth? So this myth is being passed 
off as some reality. 
  I can tell you right out that nobody has issued any 
instructions for missiles to be retargeted, neither the 
president nor the Defense Council nor other state structures of 
ours. It has not even crossed our minds. As they say, it is 
only imaginative writing presenting it as reality. 
  Nor is there, was there, will there, or can there be any 
development of any mass destruction weapons, because in general 
we as a state have been against mass destruction weapons right 
from the outset. We have no chemical or bacteriological 
weapons, and we as a state have determined our position with 
regard to eliminating nuclear weapons. 
  The impression is, you know, that this is some kind of 
unhealthy perception of Ukraine and I can say no more. I would 
just like to say that this is simply a myth. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Leonid Kravchuk told journalists in Kiev Tuesday 
that the Black Sea Fleet in its present condition was in 
practice not subordinate to Ukraine, while both Russia and 
Ukraine take responsibility for its actions. 
  Kravchuk said that it should be made stipulated as soon as 
possible that the Black Sea Fleet is a Russian fleet with 
Russian laws and that Russia takes responsibility for its 
actions, while Ukraine takes responsibility for the actions of 
its own fleet. 
  Noting that at present certain statements made by 
participants at the April 15 talks in Moscow on the Black Sea 
Fleet were being interpreted in different ways, Kravchuk said 
that there was one official position -- to resolve the question 
of the Black Sea Fleet, in particular the question of its base, 
its division, and the payment to Ukraine for the part handed 
over to Russia. 
  Kravchuk went on to say that Ukraine was sticking to the 
terms of the four document on the subject -- those prepared in 
Yalta, Zavidovo, Massandra and now Moscow. "I would like the 
fifth document to be the least [as received] -- then we will 
have a magnificent five," said Kravchuk. 
  He said he supported the idea that Sevastopol should become 
a 
naval base for the Russian fleet and that it should be leased on 
terms recognized around the world. 
  "I support this idea because I do not see another option. I 
cannot imagine that other, Ukrainian naval forces would lie side 
by side with Russian ones. The Ukrainian navy should have its 
own base." 
  He said that Sevastopol should not become a Russian town, 
but 
rather the base of the Russian fleet. "The wording should be 
carefully defined," he said.

  [Text] Kiev -- On 19 April Ukraine President Leonid 
Kravchuk attended the opening of a new outpatient child clinic 
in Kharkovskiy district intended for 30,000 local children. 
  The Ukrainian president was interviewed on current political 
issues. He said, in particular, that the Black Sea Fleet 
problem must be resolved as soon as possible. "We need to settle 
it as soon as possible, so that instead of a Russian fleet with 
Russia's laws, Ukraine will have its own fleet. I do not see 
any other option than leasing the Sevastopol base to the Russian 
fleet. Leaving the Ukrainian Navy there would be dangerous. 
There will be no peace as long as the Ukrainian and Russian 
naval forces are together." 
  Asked about his nomination in the next presidential election 
by a group of electors in Vinnitsa oblast, Leonid Kravchuk 
replied: "I am grateful to the voters. I have very close ties 
with Vinnitsa oblast; I was nominated and elected to parliament 
in Yampolskiy constituency there, and when I was nominated for 
presidency they also supported me, so I am sincerely grateful."

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Sergey Ostanin] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 20 Apr (ITAR-TASS) -- Sevastopol should be 
the joint base of the Black Sea Fleet and the Ukrainian Navy, 
Ukrainian Defense Minister Army General Vitaliy Radetskyy said 
in a telegram today to the Black Sea Fleet Command. The 
ITAR-TASS correspondent learned this at the Black Sea Fleet's 
press center. 
  Russia is known to oppose the idea of a joint base for Black 
Sea Fleet vessels and the Ukrainian Navy. In the view of 
Russian experts, Sevastopol should remain the main base for the 
Black Sea Fleet. 
  The Black Sea Fleet's press center said that many hopes of 
settling the problems of the Black Sea Fleet in Sevastopol are 
placed on the three-day visit to the main base of the Black Sea 
Fleet by Russian Defense Minister Army General Pavel Grachev, 
which begins today. 
  Immediately after his arrival this evening, Pavel Grachev is 
expected to meet with the Fleet Command and the city's 
administration. Talks with a Ukrainian military delegation are 
to begin Thursday at 1000. The signing of Russian-Ukrainian 
documents is expected Friday.

  [Text] Kiev -- UNIAN has learned on 19 April that Ukraine 
has not yet decided on a candidate for the post of its charge 
d'affaires in Yugoslavia, with which it recently established 
diplomatic relations. Yugoslavia has already appointed a charge 
d'affaires in Kiev, (Milos Jovanovic), a full-time diplomat. 
  A high-ranking Ukrainian diplomat who asked not to be 
identified said the decision to establish diplomatic relations 
with Serbia and Montenegro, against which the United Nations had 
introduced sanctions, had to do with the enlargement of 
Ukraine's peace-keeping forces in the vicinity of Gorazde and 
the possible conflicts this may involve. 
  "Ukraine's consulate general in Belgrade headed by Vadym 
Prymachenko will hardly be able to solve all the possible 
problems without representative powers at a senior level," he 
said. The same diplomat believes that serious diplomatic work 
will be required in the region following a political decision to 
compensate the countries of the Danube area for their losses 
incurred as a a result of the UN sanctions against Serbia. 
Ukraine suffered huge losses because of the sanctions.

  [Text] New Delhi 19 April, TASS -- Ukraine and India are 
prepared to contribute to the strengthening of peace and 
cooperation in South Asia, jointly seek universal and complete 
nuclear disarmament and to eliminate existing hot beds of 
tension through political means, this was underscored during 
talks today between Prime Minister of India P.V. Narasimha Rao 
and Ukraine's Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko who is here on an 
offical visit. 
  The head of the Ukrainian foreign affairs department 
expressed support for India's fight for strengthening its 
national sovereignty and territorial integrity. Zlenko 
emphasised that Indian leadership's stand for the destruction of 
all nuclear arsenals in conformation with the plan of action for 
the creation of a nuclear- free world, which was worked out by 
former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, is regarded with 
understanding in Kiev. 
  P.V. Narasimha Rao expressed support for practical steps 
taken by Ukraine to achieve non-nuclear status. The head of the 
Indian Government highly appreciated Kiev's contribution to 
strengthen stability in the world and the development of equal 
and partner-like relations between all members of the world 
community. The two sides reaffirmed their interest in the 
continuation of consultations between the two countries on 
questions of bilateral and international issues on a permanent 
basis. 
  The same day Zlenko held talks with Indian Foreign Minister 
Dinesh Singh. It was stressed during the meeting that India 
attaches great importance to relations with Ukraine which bear a 
progressive character, especially in the sphere of economics. 
Dinesh Singh, in particular, expressed India's readiness to 
provide necessary assistance to Ukraine in the implementation of 
its wide- ranging economic reform programmes and transition 
towards a market economy. 
  India and Ukraine signed today agreements on setting up a 
Ukrainian-Indian intergovernmental commission for trade, 
economic, scientific, technical and cultural cooperation, a 
protocol on consultations between Foreign Ministries of the two 
countries and other documents.

  [Text] New Delhi 19 April TASS -- "Kiev pays major 
attention to the development of good-neighbourly and friendly 
relations with Russia and the Russian people," Ukrainian Foreign 
Minister Anatoliy Zlenko told a news conference here today. The 
Ukrainian minister is currently on an official visit to India. 
  "The major aim of our policy is consolidation of 
Ukrainian-Russian relations. The immediate elaboration of a 
comprehensive bilateral treaty on friendship and cooperation as 
it was agreed by the Commonwealth state and government heads 
will help this consolidation," he said. 
  "Work on the document has been done since 1993. 
Unfortunately, there was a delay in finalization of the 
agreement on reasons not depending on Ukraine. Meanwhile, 
Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and me were instructed 
by our presidents to boost the document's elaboration. The 
treaty is expected to reflect new realities in the 
Ukrainian-Russian relations and outline a way for the solution 
of the current problems. Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk 
invited Boris Yeltsin to come to Kiev on an official visit to 
sign the document," said the foreign minister. 
  "Permanent negotiations with Russia enable solution of any 
problems in bilateral relations. We are satisfied with 
Yeltsin's readiness to help remove obstacles on the way of 
development of our friendship and cooperation and his statement 
saying Russia respects territorial integrity of Ukraine, 
inviolability of its borders and sovereignty. 
  ``As for the division of the Black Sea Fleet, Kiev and 
Moscow 
are progressing step by step to the solution of this problem. A 
new agreement on the Black Sea Fleet that is being elaborated 
will focus on separate bases of the Russian and Ukrainian 
navies,'' said Zlenko. However, this, in his opinion, will not 
help to eliminate all problems related to the Black Sea Fleet's 
future. Experts are still to analyze the division parameters. 
  Ukraine is ready to have 15-20 per cent of the ships it 
received under the Moscow agreement signed in September 1993, 
said the foreign minister. The rest of the fleet will be passed 
over to Russia. The new document will give a fresh impetus to 
the work on remaining problems of the Black Sea Fleet, said 
Zlenko.

  [Text] On Monday, 18 April, Supreme Council Chairman Ivan 
Plyushch met in Kiev with U.S. ambassador to Ukraine William 
Miller at the latter's request, the Supreme Council press center 
reported. The Ukrainian parliament speaker informed Mr. Miller 
about the parliamentary elections' outcome and returns. As Mr. 
Plyushch stated, the 338 newly elected MP's have thus secured 
the parliament's constitutional majority necessary for its legal 
functioning. Repeated voting will soon be held in those 
electoral districts where no deputies were elected as a result 
of the [word indistinct] elections. 
  As Mr. Plyushch noted, the new parliament reflects the worst 
political forces in Ukraine, but yet there is a hope that in the 
final analysis their actions will not be ruinous to Ukraine's 
sovereign statehood and that their concerted efforts will 
promote democratic political and radical economic reforms in 
Ukraine. To make out his case the Ukrainian Supreme Council 
chairman referred to his meetings and talks with the freshly 
elected leftists, communists included, who reiterated their 
commitment to construction of a really independent, democratic 
and prosperous Ukraine. During the meeting issues of 
U.S.-Ukrainian relations as well as some international problems 
were touched upon. The two officials were unanimous in 
expressing the dire necessity to promote global and regional 
peace, extinguish armed conflict, and preserve intact European 
borders. The Supreme Council chairman thanked the U.S. 
ambassador for his concern over U.S.-Ukrainian economic 
relations, for helping alleviate the aftermath of Chernobyl, and 
U.S. humanitarian aid to Ukraine.

the Romanian Parliament's Chamber of Deputies to denounce 
Moldovan joining of the Commonwealth of Independent States and

  Deputy Moldovan parliament speaker and leader of the ruling

the leadership of independent Moldova "does not intend to ask 
for permission to conclude beneficial treaties and will not

international community," says the document. 
  "The Bosnian Serb leadership must fulfill its promises given

  The Russian president "confirmed the proposal to hold a

representatives". 
  "No doubt, such a meeting must be thoroughly prepared. 
Corresponding instructions have been given to the Russian

  [Text] Moscow, April 19 (TANJUG) -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin assessed on Tuesday evening that forceful measures 
should be taken towards the resolving of the conflict in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and again suggested a top-level meeting 
between the United States and the European Union, with the 
participation of the United Nations. 
  Yeltsin said that the meeting should be well-prepared and 
that instructions in that sense had been given to the Foreign 
Ministry in Moscow. 
  Yeltsin assessed that the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
was 
facing a dangerous escalation and that the strong measures taken 
by Russia together with some other countries and the U.N. had 
not been helpful. 
  He underscored that the Bosnian Serb leadership had to 
fulfill their obligations given to Russia, to cease combat 
activities and withdraw from the area of Gorazde, which has been 
declared a safe area. 
  Conditions must also be created for the arrival of U.N. 
troops to Gorazde and the U.N. staff in Bosnia-Herzegovina must 
be allowed freedom of movement, the Russian president said. 
  Moslem and Serb forces have been fighting around Gorazde, a 
Moslem enclave in southeastern Bosnia-Herzegovina, for three 
weeks. 
  Instead of demilitarization, more than 10,000 Moslem troops 
concentrated in this enclave, from where they launched a heavy 
offensive on Serb territories in late March. 
  Bosnian Serb president Radovan Karadzic on Sunday agreed an 
immediate ceasefire around Gorazde with UNPROFOR head Yasushi 
Akashi, but Bosnian Moslem leader Alija Izetbegovic rejected the 
agreement. 
  The Bosnian Serb army announced that Moslem forces from 
Gorazde on Tuesday continued heavy attacks on Serb positions in 
order to cause larger-scale conflicts for which the Serb side 
would then be blamed and a foreign intervention provoked. 
  NATO-assigned U.S. planes on Sunday and Monday bombed 
Bosnian 
Serb positions around Gorazde, allegedly to protect UNPROFOR 
members who were actually British special units in charge of 
guiding the NATO planes to the Serb targets. 
  The Bosnian Serb army also on Tuesday pointed out that 
Moslem 
forces were using buildings where representatives of the U.N. 
and international humanitarian organizations were housed for 
their attacks. 
  Karadzic underscored on Tuesday that he was receiving hourly 
reports on the situation in Gorazde and that they showed that 
the Moslem forces would not cease fire and were attacking Serbs 
on the right bank of the Drina in boat landing operations. 
  Bosnian Serbs could have entered Gorazde, Karadzic said, but 
wished to make a safe area of the town. It must be 
demilitarized and UNPROFOR members should be deployed along a 
3-km belt on the left bank of the Drina, where the Moslem part 
is, Karadzic said, adding that this could be realized 
immediately as far as the Serb side was concerned.

    [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in 
Russian at 1625 GMT on 19 April carries a 10-minute program on 
the process leading up to the statement by Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin urging the Serbs to withdraw from Gorazde. 
Presenter Sergey Dorenko opens the program by saying that "at 
1617 GMT today the Russian president's statement on the Bosnian 
crisis came out. You, perhaps, already know about the 
aggravation and about the fact that the Serbs are in direct 
conflict with UN forces. I wrote it down as it was dictated to 
me by telephone -- we have just talked with the president's 
press service -- and I will try to recount what I have grasped: 
The president said that the situation has reached a point of 
dangerous confrontation. The Serbs have been requested to 
withdraw from Gorazde immediately, to let the UN contingent 
pass, to unblock all UN forces, all UN contingents. Also, the 
Russian president's invitation to the United States and the 
European Community to hold a summit on the Yugoslav conflict 
with Russia's participation was confirmed. Signed by Yeltsin, 
Russian president". 
  Dorenko goes on to update the situation in the Bosnian 
region 
and international reaction to the aggravation of the crisis. He 
says that "since about 1100 GMT today Moscow has been in 
turmoil, as we have learned from our sources. The text of the 
above presidential statement on the Bosnian crisis was being 
decided. The statement could have appeared earlier if 
everything had been clear regarding it. After 1100 GMT Vitaliy 
Churkin met [Duma Chairman] Ivan Rybkin, an hour later he was in 
Vladimir Shumeyko's office, at 1415 GMT he reported to his 
minister, Andrey Kozyrev. Before that, at 1405, he cancelled 
his promise to take part in our program live. Incidentally, he 
pleaded indisposition -- a diplomatic excuse, one should think. 
The Foreign Ministry was not ready for an publicly announced 
decision. I will venture to speculate about why there was such 
a big delay with the statement. The thing is that the Foreign 
Ministry did not have a unanimous view. We believe that Andrey 
Kozyrev tried to foresee the development of events and was 
afraid to acknowledge Russia's clear fiasco in the Yugoslav 
crisis, while Vitaliy Churkin, who was in charge of the Serbs 
and could forfeit his career because of his protegees' 
disobedience, said straight away that he placed all 
responsibility on them and described their actions as betrayal. 
Both Foreign Ministry officials could not ignore a third view 
which maintains that we must fight on the side of the Serbs. It 
seems that it is for precisely this reason that Vitaliy Churkin 
spent so much time in Rybkin's and Shumeyko's offices. His 
refusal to be here live shows that his stand was gaining ground 
with great difficulty". 
  Further in the program, over archive footage of 'Arafat's 
activities, Sergey Dorenko comments on Yasir 'Arafat's visit to 
Moscow and its goals. He sees Russian involvement in the Middle 
East peace process as yet another attempt by Russian diplomacy 
to assert its major international standing. But the Yugoslav 
lessen should serve as a warning. 
  Dorenko concludes by reminding the viewers that the program 
was the first to announce Yeltsin's statement on the Bosnian 
crisis.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Koretskiy report in the "Russian-Ukrainian </F>
Agreement on the Black Sea Fleet" column: "What Is This 
Agreement All About? Nothing, Actually"] 
  [Text] On the evening of 15 April the presidents of Russia 
and Ukraine signed an agreement on a phased settlement of Black 
Sea Fleet problems. Moscow's and Kiev's subsequent 
"explanations," however, suggest that Boris Yeltsin and Leonid 
Kravchuk not only spoke different languages but also signed 
something quite different. 
  The agreement has left more questions than answers. For 
instance, the decision to divide the basing of the Ukrainian 
Navy and the Black Sea Fleet does not even approximately define 
the location of Russia's naval base in Ukraine. Kiev maintains 
that this is a subject of future negotiations. The statement by 
Ukraine Deputy Foreign Minister Boris Tarasyuk that the base may 
be leased to Russia to a term of up to five years appears 
puzzling. There is no answer to the logical question: What 
next? The fleet's redeployment to bases in the Pacific or the 
Arctic Ocean, or its sinking, the third in its history? 
Kravchuk's "promising" judgment about the need for the 
Ukrainian parliament to ratify the leasing agreement renders any 
accords senseless. The deputies will "sink" them anyway. 
  Kravchuk assures that he and Yeltsin have "defined the 
parameters and percentage ratio of the Black Sea Fleet division" 
and that all that remains to be done is to work out mechanisms 
to implement the accords. Yeltsin's press secretary Vyacheslav 
Kostikov is somewhat more specific on this question: According 
to him, Kiev is to have 15 to 20 percent of the Black Sea Fleet. 
The Ukrainian side has its own interpretation of the accords: 
According to Ukraine Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy, the 
Black Sea Fleet is to be split in half, and from its half 
Ukraine will sell Russia the 30 to 35 percent it does not need. 
Which is not at all identical to what Moscow understands as a 
"percentage ratio:" Pavel Grachev completely rejects his 
Ukrainian counterpart's approach. Now Kostikov has not only 
accused Kiev of a "unilateral interpretation" but also recalled 
that in talking about such a "nationally sacred thing" as the 
Black Sea Fleet, there is no room for bargaining. 
  The presidents have given their governments 10 days to 
finalize the division agreement. During this time the Black Sea 
Fleet is to be fully inventoried. And this involves 390 
battleships and a still unknown number of coastal installations, 
from Izmamil to Kerch. Yet it appears that even these "10 days" 
are understood differently in Moscow and in Kiev. Kravchuk 
links coordination of the Black Sea Fleet division not with a 
term of 10 days but with "a full-scale treaty on friendship and 
cooperation." This will take two to three months at the very 
least. Furthermore, coordination of "friendship" conditions is 
likely to proceed in a strained situation. Kravchuk makes no 
secret of his discontent with Black Sea Fleet Commander Admiral 
Eduard Baltin. According to Leonid Makarovich, he is ready to 
recall his signature under his appointment and will do so if 
"the negotiating process drags out." He does not specify the 
meaning of "dragging out." 
  Admiral Aleksey Kalinin, former Black Sea Fleet commander, 
who is not bound by diplomatic etiquette, assessed the agreement 
as "a palliative option, preserving tension in the south of 
Ukraine and in Crimea" and beneficial to Kravchuk. Judging by 
first reactions from Black Sea Fleet representatives (in 
conversation with KOMMERSANT-DAILY's correspondents), there is a 
restrained attitude to the "strange agreement" in the fleet, and 
no one there believes in the success of negotiations between 
Moscow and Kiev officials. The impression is that many Black 
Sea Fleet servicemen today are inclined to cut the "Gordian 
marine knot" military-style. That is to say, on the spur of the 
moment [splecha].

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Boris Maynayev] </F>
  [Text] Bishkek 19 April, TASS -- Russian officers 
complained that they are being ousted from the Kyrgyz Army on 
the pretext of anti-corruption drive and demanded that Kyrgyz 
President Askar Akayev restore order in the Army. 
  Russian officers of the Oshsk garrison located in the south 
of Kyrgyzstan said in an open letter addressed to President 
Akayev that recently, departments of the military prosecutor's 
office have begun to ouster Russian-speaking commanders from the 
Army "contrary to the will of Kyrgyz Defence Minister Myrzakan 
Subanov." 
  "In our opinion, military judicial bodies who have been 
looking for thieves stealing military and state property among 
Russian officers believe that if we have not gone home yet we 
have some sources of income encouraging us to stay. This is 
nonsense. We remain here because we swore allegiance here," 
says the letter signed by over 100 Russian officers, which was 
published by the "KYRGYZSTAN'S WORD" newspaper today. Russian 
commanders put the blame for the situation in the Army on Chief 
Military Prosecutor Kubat Kozhonaliyev. 
  Officers demanded that the president and commander in chief 
of the Kyrgyz Army Askar Akayev give guarantees that Russian 
officers will be able to perform their duties under normal 
conditions.

  [Text] Yerevan, April 18 (SNARK)--Armenian President's 
Acting Press Secretary Levon Zurabyan declares that through 
Azerbaijan's fault the chance to achieve the guaranteed 
armistice was lost though such chance existed at the Moscow 
meeting of the CIS members' leaders. 
  Speaking at today's briefing he also mentioned that 
Azerbaijan's signing the Russian-sponsored agreement will bring 
to profits for all the sides: Armenia will be deblockaded, 
Nagorno-Karabakh will get all the security guarantees, 
Azerbaijan will get the territories. 
  Zurabyan also mentioned that the participants of the Moscow 
summit will supply Russia with the CIS mandate to realize its 
peacekeeping initiatives in Karabakh. 
  Answering the SNARK's question on Karabakh participation in 
signing the agreement, Levon Zurabyan said if Azerbaijan 
expresses its readiness to sign the agreement the Karabakh 
representatives' participation will be ensured.

  [Text] Azeri President Heydar Aliyev has reported that the 
Armenian offensive in the zone of the Karabakh conflict that was 
launched right after the CIS summit ended in Moscow, "is the 
strongest one over the past period." 
  Addressing a conference in Baku with the government members 
and heads of the local administration, the president said that 
the "force and the character of the Armenian military operations 
indicate that the Armenians get military support from the 
outside." "Their military operations are being prepared by 
professional military experts," said Aliyev. 
  He said that the Azeri army rebuffs the aggressor. 
Azerbaijan has only one way out -- to defend itself and 
strengthen the country's defense potential. 
  He ordered that military commissariat to recruit additional 
soldiers within 10 days. Aliyev said that by his decree he 
dismissed three leaders of local military departments. The 
president ordered that the defense minister demote these chiefs 
and send them to fight on the frontline. 
  The president said that from now on the branches of the 
"power" ministries in the regions should be subordinate to the 
heads of the local administration. He said this was being done 
to improve the interaction between the representatives of the 
administrative-states local bodies.

  [Text] Initially scheduled for Thursday [21 April] in 
Krasnodar, a meeting of North Caucasian and Abkhazi leaders has 
been postponed indefinitely. As Interfax has learned from the 
Krasnodar- based organizing committee, the meeting was put off 
because of the Russian Foreign Ministry's insistence on getting 
the Georgian leadership's consent for such an assembly first. 
  Meanwhile, as an Interfax correspondent reports, at a 
conference in Krasnodar on April 16-17, the working groups of 
experts drafted for the upcoming meeting a political statement 
on the mechanism for the functioning of peacekeepers in Abkhazia.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto by </F>
unidentified correspondent; place and date not given -- 
recorded, in English with superimposed German translation] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Correspondent] In view of the 
great poverty in your country and the poor economic situation, 
it is difficult to understand why you spend so much money on 
your army. Could you please explain this. Do you perhaps feel 
threatened by India? 
  [Bhutto] We don't like to spend so much money on our army, 
but because of the threat by India we are forced to do so. 
Germany was very lucky in the sense that its defense was taken 
on by others and it could therefore tackle social and economic 
needs. But up to now we have had to survive three wars, and in 
1971 Pakistan was split in two, into Bangladesh and Pakistan. 
It is therefore very important for us to protect our 
territorial integrity. That's why we spend so much money on our 
defense. 
  India has incidentally just raised its defence budget by 20 
percent, and that exerts great pressure on a country such as 
Pakistan. We have therefore proposed many times that the 
outstanding contentious issues between India and Pakistan should 
finally be settled. The most important conflict is the conflict 
over Kashmir. This is what led to the wars between our two 
countries, and if this dispute is resolved, then both India and 
Pakistan can turn to the more productive uses of their resources. 
  [Correspondent] Is there a dialogue between India and 
Pakistan about the Kashmiri conflict at the moment? Can we 
expect a solution soon? 
  [Bhutto] Well, we would like to have a political dialogue 
and 
solve the dispute over Kashmir. We have tried to start a 
dialogue, but as in the case of my predecessors, I have 
unfortunately not succeeded either. When I became prime 
minister the two countries, India and Pakistan, had not talked 
to each other for 18 months and I said, my God, that's an 
incredibly long time. We agreed to conduct talks at foreign 
minister level. I told the foreign ministers, let's not waste 
the opportunity for dialogue, we must end what is going on in 
Kashmir tomorrow. But we were greatly disappointed. Instead of 
the murders ending within 48 hours, 50 people were killed in 
Sopor and even more in Kupwara. We were forced to break off the 
talks because of those murders. But we made it clear to India 
that we are prepared for negotiations again as soon as they take 
measures against the oppression. 
  But we cannot talk just for the same of talking, especially 
not when people are murdered and women are raped. That is the 
worst thing about war. I don't know if it was always the case, 
but now in Bosnia and in Kashmir, we've seen that rape is being 
used as a weapon by the forces of occupation, and that's a 
double crime, a crime not only of aggression, but a crime 
against women too. 
  [Correspondent] Do you need nuclear weapons against India, 
since you obviously have these weapons and this is something 
which is strongly criticized here in the West? 
  [Bhutto] Pakistan has not detonated its nuclear weapons, and 
I believe that people respect Pakistan for this restraint, in 
spite of the fact that we have had three wars with India and 
India itself has detonated nuclear weapons. Pakistan has 
exercised restraint, but we have the technology, and if we 
wanted to we could detonate an atomic weapon. But because we 
back the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and because we are 
not in favor of a nuclear arms race on our subcontinent, we have 
exercised restraint. 
  However, at the same time we cannot pursue a policy of 
unilateral disarmament. We are afraid that India could attack 
us and that we would have no deterrent. After all, India is 
five times as large as we are, as are its army and defense 
expenditure. We have proposed regional talks on the 
non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, but India has refused. We 
have proposed negotiations about our weapons, but India refused 
to accept this as well, and the message I should like to send 
out to the world is that Pakistan is a sensible and responsible 
actor on the world stage, a country which has not detonated its 
nuclear weapons, despite provocation. The world community must 
bring pressure on India to have a meaningful dialogue on 
Kashmir, on nonproliferation and on missiles. 
  [Correspondent] You know that Western investors fear nothing 
more than political instability. What can you promise these 
investors? Is your country so stable that investors have 
nothing to be afraid of? 
  [Bhutto] They don't need to be afraid. Pakistan is a stable 
society. We have a consensus that foreign capital can flow back 
into the country and that companies can indeed be fully owned by 
foreigners. But what has created most confidence in Pakistan's 
industry is our state management, and the fact that we have 
reduced the budget deficit. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Leaders of political movements opposed to President 
Johar Dudayev in Chechnya discussed how they might become 
involved in dialogue with Russia in Moscow on Monday [18 April]. 
  Interfax was informed by the opposition head quarters that 
the movements concerned discussed how they might form one body 
to represent both political parties and public and national 
movements in Chechnya opposed to Dudayev's policies. The 
stabilization of the situation inside the republic was also 
discussed. 
  One option for dialogue with Russia was that proposed by 
Russian Minister for Nationalities and Regional Policy Sergey 
Shakhray. That involved a presidential instruction stating, 
among other things, that the Russian government had been charged 
with "holding consultations with representatives of state power 
and of all political movements in the Chechen Republic" to find 
a way out of the social and political tension which had arisen. 
  Asked by Interfax why the meeting had taken place in Moscow, 
one opposition representative replied: "Not all opposition 
leaders are able to travel to Chechnya because they are being 
literally hunted down there."

  [Text] A top-ranking official of the Chechen presidential 
staff has said he doubted that a republican delegation would 
soon arrive in Moscow for bilateral consultations. In an 
interview with Interfax, he recalled that the Chechen government 
had taken a resolution under which all contacts with Russia were 
to be maintained solely through the Chechen Foreign Ministry. 
This decision was made last week in order to regulate Groznyy's 
relations with Moscow. 
  The chief of the staff of the Russian president, Sergey 
Filatov, told Interfax that consultations with Groznyy were 
supposed to involve both the republican authorities as well as 
political parties and movements of the Chechen republic. 
However, after a recent meeting of Russian and Chechen 
representatives the Chechen side said further talks would be 
inexpedient, for there were "no political forces in control of 
the political situation" in Russia. In addition, the Chechen 
leadership had been making statements that the opposition's 
participation in the talks in any form would be unrealistic. 
  In the meantime, Interfax learned from reliable sources that 
Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev consulted experts Monday on 
the possible imposition of a moratorium on talks with Russia. 
Interfax was told that the experts insisted on the moratorium 
in view of Russia's unconstructive position. 
  The same sources said Dudayev had not yet made his choice.

  [Text] Kiev April 19 TASS -- The safety system switched on 
in the third power unit of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, 
Ukraine, during Monday's increase of the unit capacity after the 
planned repairs. 
  A reason for this was the lowered water level in 
hydroballoons of the reactor's emergency cooling system. The 
accident is estimated as the first level (the international 
scale) and does not endanger the plant's personnel or safe 
operation of the facility.

  [Text] On 11 April 1994, the president of the Crimean 
Republic issued Edict No. 33 appointing V.M. Lepikhov as acting 
chairman of the Security Service of the Crimean Republic and 
Edict No. 34 in accordance with which the powers of acting 
chairman of the Security Service of the Crimean Republic I.F. 
Kolomytsev were suspended. 
  The aforementioned edicts are at variance with the Ukrainian

  The decrees issued by the president of the Crimean Republic 
have violated the clauses of the Ukrainian laws "On the Division 
of Powers Among the Bodies of State Power of Ukraine and the

accordance with which chairman of the Security Service of the 
Crimean Republic must be appointed or dismissed. 
  Proceeding from this and in accordance with clause 7-2 of

follows: 
  1. To cancel 22 April 1994 Crimean presidential edicts No.

"Ostankino," the Russian Radio and press of the Russian 
Federation. Ukrainian journalists were not admitted there. As 
has become known, the admirals put all the blame for the 
incident in Odessa involving the Black Sea Fleet ship "Cheleken" 
on the Ukrainian side. 
  In accordance with reliable data, the cruiser "Admiral 
Holovko" and other warships of the Black Sea Fleet have been 
loaded with munitions and put on full combat alert. In 
accordance with as yet unconfirmed data, Admiral E. Baltin has 
handed in his resignation. 
  On 14 April, the Sevastopol City Council Board held a 
meeting 
at which first deputy commander of the Black Sea Fleet V. 
Larionov said that the Black Sea Fleet Military Procurator's 
Office had inspected the "Cheleken" and revealed no violations 
"on our part." According to the Ukrainian side, the "Cheleken" 
had contraband goods on board. At the proposal by chairman of 
the City Council Viktor Semenov, a decision was adopted to hold, 
on 19 April, an extraordinary session of the City Council with 
"The Situation Around the Black Sea Fleet" on the agenda. The 
same session will adopt a questionnaire for holding a survey 
among the city residents: Should Sevastopol and the Black Sea 
Fleet belong to Ukraine or to Russia? Chairman of the "Russian 
Party of Sevastopol" O. Kruglov (he is a deputy of the City 
Council and of the Crimean Supreme Council) stated the following 
at the meeting of the City Council Board regarding the incident 
with the "Cheleken": "I hope that the next time the Black Sea 
Fleet sailors will use weapons."

<F P=106> [From the "Business News Weekly" feature No. 16, 11-17 April </F>
94] 
  [Text] According to reliable sources in Simferopol, 
Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov signed a package of documents on 
14 April, which in many respects contradict Kiev's basic 
economic guidelines. No official response from the central 
authority followed, however. 
  The Crimean President's Decree on currency regulation and 
control provides, in particular, for establishment, within a 
two-month term of the Crimean Interbank Currency Exchange, which 
is supposed to sell the mandatory 50-percent share of Crimea's 
aggregate hard currency incomings to Crimea's residents. 
  Prior to the hard currency trading onset Crimean residents 
are free to opt for one of the following modes: 
  (a) Effect mandatory 50 percent currency sales and purchases 
on the Crimean interbank market at a free rate, or 
  (b) Pay the currency tax at rates set by the Crimean 
Government. 
  The remainder of hard currency incomings is supposed to be 
used by Crimean residents at their discretion. 
  Foreign currency means derived by natural person-residents 
by 
way of their labor remuneration, except those earned through 
business activities, are exempt from the otherwise mandatory 
sale. 
  The Crimean Republican Bank sets exchange rates for 
currencies on a daily basis. 
  So, if this decree proves viable and working, Crimea's 
currency regulation mode will radically differ from the 
Ukrainian government-imposed practices, which imply mandatory 
selling a half of all the currency earned by Ukrainian 
producer-exporters at the NBU [National Bank of Ukraine]-set 
rate maintained at the very unrealistic 1,2610 krb. 
[karbovonets]:1 USD rate for over five months by now. The other 
half of hard currency earnings may be used only by the agreement 
of the Cabinet's body, which was specifically set up for this 
purpose. 
  Crimean President Meshkov's decree on improving taxation and 
settling in Crimea's national economy contains some innovative 
provisions, not consistent with Ukraine's active legislation, in 
particular, abrogation of the income tax and introduction of a 
30 percent tax on juridical persons' profits, consumption funds 
for all tax-payers, irrespective of their proprietorial form 
status, reduced VAT and excise for a number of commodities to 
spur their marketing. 
  The decree's preamble states that their issuance was by way 
of compliance with President Kravchuk's decree of 23 June 1993 
"On the open economy regime on the Crimean Republic's territory." 
  In view of Kiev's lacking official comments it's a matter of 
pure guess-work and sheer conjecture to try to both determine 
the Crimean presidential decrees' politically declarative 
content and predict how soon, if ever, they will be nullified by 
President Kravchuk. 
  However, if really implemented, they are certain to attract 
a 
massive flow of banking capital into the peninsular republic. 
  Many analysts tend to trace the decrees to Chairman of the 
Crimean Council of Ministers Saburov, who more likely than not 
is their architect.

  [Text] Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov has not managed to 
dismiss Major General Ivan Kolomytsev, chief of the Crimean 
Security Service. Despite the fact, so to speak, that an 
alternate candidate for the office of Crimean Security Service 
chief -- Reserve Major General Volodymyr Lepikov -- has appeared 
at the Security Service building, Ivan Kolomytsev has left 
neither his office nor duties. Our correspondent Anatoliy 
Polonskyy has the details. 
  [Begin recording] [Polonskyy] The law has won. This was made 
possible thanks to Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk's decree 
and a clear position of the Security Service staff, who have 
prevented their activities from being shifted from the legal 
sphere into politics. The Crimeans have obtained great moral 
support from their colleagues from other regions of Ukraine. A 
tribute should also be paid to Ivan Kolomytsev himself. During 
these extremely hard days, he has shown self-restraint, courage, 
and allegiance to the oath. Are Kolomytsev's supervisors 
satisfied with his professional skills? I have addressed this 
question to Valeriy Malikov, first deputy chairman of the 
Ukrainian Security Service. 
  [Malikov] Yes, we are satisfied. Moreover, as I have been 
told, the Crimean president said that he had no reservations 
toward Ivan Kolomytsev, while visiting the service and examining 
the issue of replacing its chief. 
  [Polonskyy] Why then did he decide to dismiss him? 
  [Malikov] Excuse me, but this question should be addressed 
to 
someone else. I have met here with representatives of the 
Presidential Administration and the Crimean Cabinet of 
Ministers. I have also met with several representatives of 
Crimean political parties and movements, and I have not 
understood why such a problem has arisen. Moreover, I have 
reached an understanding with the majority of people I have had 
conversations with, that this issue must not be resolved in this 
manner. There is a legal way of appointing or dismissing the 
Crimean Security Service chief. This decision should be 
coordinated with the Crimean Supreme Council and, of course, the 
Ukrainian Security Service. 
  [Polonskyy] Valeriy Vasylovych, what could you say regarding 
the Crimean press reports on reinforcing your service's military 
units in the Crimea? It has also been reported that special 
assignment units from Kiev arrived in the Crimea. How would you 
comment on this? 
  [Malikov] As for reinforcing the Crimean Security Service 
with our special services, I can assure you, with all the 
responsibility, that such a fact has not occurred. Nobody has 
arrived here, to reinforce, or do anything else. Regarding 
other military units, I have received neither official nor 
operational reports indicating that this has taken place here. 
  [Polonskyy] Is something currently threatening the national 
security in the Crimea? 
  [Malikov] I do not know of any factors which would somehow 
influence the national security of the Crimea. I do not know of 
anything that would threaten the national security -- something 
that exists only in the Crimea and does not occur in other 
regions of Ukraine. 
  [Polonskyy] So, there are no grounds for introducing a state 
of emergency in the Crimea? 
  [Malikov] As of today, I do not see any. [end recording]

  [Text] According to the central electoral commission, not a 
single candidate has been registered in Kiev a week before the 
final date for registration of contenders for candidate for 
president of Ukraine. 
  Ivan Hulchenko, head of the section for working with 
parties, 
has informed UNIAN that as of 18 April the Central Electoral 
Commission (TsVK) had registered the Socialist and 
Social-Democratic parties of Ukraine as intending to nominate a

Congress of Ukraine, Party of Free Peasants of Ukraine, and the 
"State Independence of Ukraine" association) have submitted 
registration documents. According to Ivan Hulchenko, they have 
to submit certain information, after which they will receive 
forms to collect 100,000 signatures in support of their 
contenders. 
  According to Stepan Hamanyuk, an employee at the 
registration 
section of the Central Electoral Commission, to date, a week 
before the final date for registration, the Central Electoral 
Commission has not registered a single contender for candidate 
for president of Ukraine.

94] 
  [Text] According to the Ukrainian Ministry of Statistics, 
Ukraine's inflation rate in March was 105.7 per cent, the lowest 
mark since September 1991. 
  The averaged cost of vital foods in the consumer basket was 
431,500 karbovanets in prices charged by state-run and 
non-state-run shops. The gap between the consumer basket's 
minimal and maximal costs widened to 45.5 per cent with the city 
of Sevastopol and the Kirovograd region forming two poles with 
536,000 krb. and 368,500 krb., respectively. 
  In urban collective farm market prices the basket weighed as 
much as 523,000 krb. to exceed the state-run retail trade's 
prices by 21.2 per cent. 
  Food prices grew by 3 per cent in March, on the average, and 
were virtually unchanged for dairy products, sunflower seed oil, 
margarine, rice, buckwheat, sausages, mayonnaise, and yeast. 
Prices for meat, pork fat, eggs, citrus fruits, vodka dropped 
by 8 per cent, on the average. 
  Prices grew, however, for certain manufactured goods, such 
as 
children's clothes (by 11 per cent) and footwear (by 21 per 
cent), pharmaceutical products (by 21 per cent), books, 
newspapers and office materials (by 14 per cent). 
  The 23 March - 5 April period witnessed a steeper price 
growth versus the preceding 10-day period; food prices in 
state-run shops and co-ops grew by 2.1 per cent, and collective 
farm market prices by 1.4 per cent versus the previous 10-day 
period's figures of 1.2 per cent and 1.3 per cent, respectively. 
  Food price growth rates were the highest in Crimea (by 11 
per 
cent), while in Ukraine's 12 regions (Zhitomir, Transcarpathian, 
Zaporozhye, Poltava, Ivano-Frankovsk, Kiev, Rivne, Kherson, 
Khmelnitski, Cherkassy and Chernigov) the price growth rates 
were between 3 and 4 per cent. 
  Bread products baked from first and extra brands of flour 
became sizably more expensive with prices for them having grown 
by 72 per cent in Crimea, by 20 per cent in the Cherkassy region 
(in both cases higher prices were imposed by the republican and 
regional administrations), and by 18 per cent in the 
Transcarpathian region, by 28 per cent in Ivano-Frankovsk 
region, by 12 per cent in the Kirovograd region, by 20 per cent 
in the Lvov region, and by 9 per cent in the Ternopol region 
because of flour prices raised by suppliers. 
  Inter-regional wide variations persisted in prices for 
certain food products. Thus, prices for cheeses with low fat 
content varied by as much as 6.8 times (2,778 krb. per kg. in 
the Chernigov region and 18,930 krb. per kg. in Kiev city), 
farina prices by 5.6 times (1,800 krb. per kg. in the Ternopol 
region vs 10,000 krb. per kg. in the Volyn region), flour 
prices by 3.5 times (2,390 krb. per kg. in the Kirovograd region 
and 8,480 krb. per kg. in the Kiev region), prices for rolled 
oats by 3.2 times (3,180 krb. per kg. in the Rovno region and 
10,200 krb. per kg. in the Nikolaev region). 
  Food price hikes were the steepest in the Kherson (by 16 per 
cent), Rovno (by 8 per cent), Kirovograd and Volyn (by 7 per 
cent) regions. Vegetables were most affected by price growths, 
while beef, pork and pork fat prices were largely immune to 
these. Dairy products and butter, sunflower seed oil, potatoes 
and eggs were slightly cheaper (prices for them dropped, 
respectively, by 1 per cent to 2 per cent, 4 per cent and 9 per 
cent). 
  It should be noted that urban collective farm markets 
witnessed a two-times lower price growth for basic foods, as 
compared with state-run retail trade, with some food products 
sold by farmers at lower prices than what government-owned shops 
charged for similar foods. 
  Prices for manufactured goods charged by state-run shops 
grew 
by 25 per cent in the Transcarpathian region followed by the 
Kirovograd (by 17 per cent), Rovno (by 13 per cent) and 
Ivano-Frankovsk (by 10 per cent) regions, over the last ten-day 
period.

  [Text] Experts with the Economics Agency under the Cabinet 
of Ministers of Ukraine compiled a composite report about 
Ukraine's economic performance in the first quarter of 1994. 
  According to it, national income dropped by 36 per cent 
versus the January-March period of 1993. While January's 
production drop versus January 1993 was by 32.7 per cent, it 
amounted to 35.7 per cent during the January-February period and 
rose to 38.4 per cent for the entire first quarter. 
  The consolidated budget's revenues amounted to 35 trillion 
krb. in the January-February period (i.e. only 8.4. per cent 
of the approved budget's figure). The consolidated budget's 
expenditures exceeded 40 trillion krb. [karbovanets] with 
welfare having consumed 6.6 trillion krb. (16.4 per cent of 
total expenditures), financing the societal-cultural sector 
having accounted for 9.8 trillion krb. (24.4 per cent), and the 
national economy, having attracted 18.38 per cent of total 
financing. 
  Besides, 6.5 trillion krb. credits by NBU [National Bank of 
Ukraine] and other banks were drawn to offset the budget's 
deficit and cover some other outlays. 
  Reduced production resulted in budgetary revenues' losses 
through underpaid VAT to the tune of 2.8 trillion krb. and 
excise to the tune of 1.8 trillion krb. Ukraine's payment 
crisis led to underpaid taxes, which reduced by 4.4 times, and 
the aggregate loss reached 1.5 trillion krb. as of 1 March. 
  The first quarter's subsidies to the tune of 6 trillion krb. 
were involved in the state's price regulation and channeled to 
the population's social of protection (foods, medicines, solid 
fuels, livestock, milk, housing, public amenities), to the tune 
of 2.7 trillion krb. and to offset the coal price difference to 
the tune of 3.3 trillion krb. 
  The aggregate amount of credit investments (credit 
indebtedness) of Ukraine's banks in economy amounted to 70.7 
trillion krb., as of 1 March, including NBU's 22.5 trillion krb. 
credits, commercial banks' 48.2 trillion krb. credits and the 
former Union nations' bank affiliates' 98 billion krb. credits. 
  The average weighted rate for commercial bank credits 
amounted to 385 per cent versus January's 310 per cent. It 
varied from the maximal value of 900 per cent to the minimal 1 
per cent rate. 
  The debit-credit indebtedness of Ukraine's enterprises and 
organisations continued to accumulate. Credit indebtedness grew 
by 35.3 per cent during January and February to amount to 172.3 
trillion krb. in early March. Debit indebtedness grew by 32 
per cent and equalled 131.5 trillion krb. The share of 
unprofitable enterprises in Ukraine's national economy grew from 
16 per cent in 1993's first quarter to 24.1 per cent in the 
January-February period of 1994. 
  Ukraine's coal-mining industry extracted 27.7 million tons 
of 
coal, or by 16.1 per cent less than in the January-March period 
of 1993. A third of engineering enterprises had to shift to a 
reduced work-week. The Luganskteplovoz production association 
was idling for almost two month, though it is Ukraine's sole 
enterprise, which manufactures diesel locomotives. While it 
manufactured as many as 63 diesel locomotives in the 
January-March of 1993 period, this year it produced only five of 
these. The underlying reason is loss of former markets, as 
Russia used to be the Ukrainian manufacturers' major customer. 
  Ukraine's collective and state farms have embarked on spring 
crop sowing. 936,000 ha of perished winter crop areas have been 
resown with spring crops out of 2 million ha. 
  Ukraine's foreign trade turn-over with the "near abroad" 
(that is former Union) nations amounted to 50.2 trillion krb. 
in the 1st quarter of 1994 including 27 trillion krb. exports 
and 23.2 trillion krb. imports. Foreign trade turn-over with 
"far abroad" nations totalled 1,214 million USD including 726 
million USD exports and 488 million USD imports. Ukraine's 
favorable balance thus amounted to 238 million USD. 
  Ukraine's metallurgical engineering somewhat improved its 
performance in March. Averaged daily manufacture of ready 
rolled metal and steel piping increased by respectively 2.8 per 
cent and 2.3 per cent versus February and by 7.3 pr cent and 
23.4 per cent versus January. However, their production fell 
short of the target plan figures by 2.9 million tons of rolled 
metal and 750,000 tons of steel piping. 
  Fuel and raw material shortages remained chronic. Gas 
supplies to metallurgical works amounted to 72 per cent of what 
was supplied to them in the January-March period of 1993. 
Similarly, supplies of scrap, metallurgical coal and electric 
power were respectively at 56 per cent, 78 per cent and 72 per 
cent marks versus 1993's first quarter. Ukraine's coal miners 
supplied metallurgical coal in amounts, which were by 350,000 
tons less than what the plan provided for. Ukraine's coal 
imports amounted to about 200,000 tons, or about a tenth of 
Ukraine's demand. Undersupplies of scrap amounted to 620,000 
tons, which resulted in eleven blast-furnaces (20 per cent of 
the total amount) and 23 Siemens-Martin open-hearth furnaces (30 
per cent of the total) idling in March. 
  The averaged monthly wages of workers engaged in the 
state-owned sector of Ukraine's national economy amounted to 
760,100 krb. in February. Workers engaged in housing, 
household services, public amenities, public catering, 
agriculture, social welfare, education and culture, were among 
the lowest-paid bracket with wages and salaries ranging from 
380,900 to 451,000 karbovanets per month. 
  As of late February, the number of jobless persons 
registered 
by the employment service amounted to 138,000. 93,100 persons 
were granted the unemployed status, which was 0.4 per cent of 
the economically active and able-bodied population. The state's 
relief per unemployed individual amounted to 147,800 krb. in 
February.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ukrainian Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy </F>
by Anatoliy Smetanin; place and date not given: "Army General 
Vitaliy Radetskyy, Ukrainian Defense Minister: `Political Party 
Will Not Influence the Army'"] 
  [Text] Now, in the period of their formation, Ukraine's 
Armed Forces, as is known, are having a hard time; servicemen 
and their burdens are not to be envied. One could feel this 
during our interview with Vitaliy Radetskyy, who honestly and 
openly answered all of our questions. 
  [Smetanin] You served in the Soviet Army for 30 years; now 
you are head of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. You know all the 
problems facing the Army. Is it within our power to change 
something for the better today? To what extent does this depend 
on the Defense Ministry? 
  [Radetskyy] To a great extent, and I will tell you why. 
Today, hollering for Ukraine is not enough; patriotic boasting 
is not enough. You surely have noticed: As time goes by, 
officers, or generals, are leaving the Defense Ministry one 
after another -- either being transferred or fired. We will 
continue operating this way, because I need professionals, not 
bawlers. I have conducted an analysis. What have I discovered? 
Here is a typical example for you: An officer was an alcoholic 
in the Soviet Army, and still continues to drink and loaf. I 
asked him what is the reason? I did it earlier, he says, 
because I disliked the system, the politics. And what is the 
reason now? There is no reason. This is the first example. 
  Second, in the uproar and euphoria of independence, the 
central apparatus has been filled by many nonprofessionals. 
Well, imagine a high-ranking official making miscalculations by 
hundreds of equipment units! He is ignorant of many things, 
this is his tragedy, therefore one has to get rid of such a man, 
to transfer him to another post where he can work effectively. 
  Third, by now, we have a lot of young commanders of 
companies, battalions, regiments, divisions, and corps. They 
should be trained. Who has to do it, if not Defense Ministry 
officers and generals? It is an inconspicuous job that requires 
much knowledge, experience, and effort. It is much easier, you 
must admit, to come to a regiment, blame its commander for 
idleness, set a term for eliminating shortcomings, and go away. 
  No, we are not going to support such a style! One must 
change the men's psychology, such parasitical disposition. Thus 
far, some have not understood that they are serving under the 
Defense Ministry of the [independent] country, not in a district 
staff under the watchful eye of the Moscow General Staff which 
can send its messengers with a prompting word, a helping hand, 
and a receipt for every occurrence in life. No, by now, we have 
to think by ourselves; say, a chief of the chemical troops has 
to think for himself how to train and assign cadres, how to deal 
with state orders for equipment, armaments, and materials, how 
to anticipate the development of his troops... All this must by 
done by ourselves alone, and one has to face up to hard work and 
education! 
  [Smetanin] But we have some reform under way in the Army. 
  [Radetskyy] That is not the word. Reform, especially in 
military structures, includes in itself the reducing, expanding, 
and reequipping of troops. Just look at what we have inherited 
from the former USSR Armed Forces: three districts, part of an 
antiaircraft defense grouping and the Air Force, and various 
command posts. It is disgraceful to speak of reform in this 
case. We need a concrete plan to construct the Armed Forces. 
By now, such a plan has been worked out, and is being examined 
by the commander in chief. However, the most painful question 
surely regards state restrictions on military means. The Army 
has survived for almost two years without a budget. As for now, 
we have received only part of the means that we need to maintain 
combat readiness. If we are not going to beef up science, the 
military-industrial complex, and the Army, then, no matter what 
we call it -- reform or a plan to construct the Armed Forces -- 
we will get nowhere. I understand that the state gives what it 
can, but one should pay more attention to servicemen nonetheless. 
  [Smetanin] I fully agree with you, because, as you surely 
know, 67 percent of officers are dissatisfied with their 
service, 87 percent are annoyed over their low earnings, and 85 
percent are disappointed with their poor standard of living... 
What can you say to them? 
  [Radetskyy] Yes, there are many discontented servicemen, and 
this percentage is an indicator of their discontent. However, 
it is also true that everything has its origin in the economic 
situation of our state. We have 70,000 families without housing 
right now! Where do I see a way out of this? We have adopted a 
resolution and will attempt to implement it: The construction 
of housing should be obligingly conducted with the building of 
family hostels, not those with a common hall and kitchen, but 
two-room apartments with furniture, in which principally the 
commanders of platoons or companies will be lodged. Right now, 
we are reevaluating rents, in order to increase them, surely. 
  The paying of salaries is a very acute problem today. An 
officer, as you know, lives from paycheck to paycheck, but if 
the salary is paid -- as happens now -- in installments and 
irregularly, this causes great tension. We are trying 
everything to avoid such a situation, but sometimes this is 
beyond our control. What is within our control? We are now 
pressing for paying per diem, if an officer is on duty; those 
with class specializations will be paid remuneration. The 
Cabinet of Ministers has received our proposal to acknowledge a 
free transportation pass for officers, at least for junior ones. 
We will also reexamine the payment of so-called "field 
commissions" ["polevyye"]. 
  [Smetanin] I have the impression that professionals, 
instead of joining our Army, leave Ukraine, in particular, for 
Russia, and you try to order them to stay, especially pilots. 
Can you shed some light on this situation? 
  [Radetskyy] Let us begin with the statement that any such 
cases involve specific individuals and concrete circumstances, 
therefore one should approach each case objectively. The 
question concerns young officers, Ukrainian citizens, not those 
who are going to leave, say, for Russia or somewhere else. 
Unless we keep our young officers today, we will forfeit the 
future of the Army. 
  Now, about those who want to leave. I did foresee this 
problem as early as 1992, when the oath of allegiance was first 
administered. I appealed to not hurry its administration on a 
mass scale. Now we have to pay for that. With regard to 
officers who choose to serve in other CIS countries, nothing and 
no one should stand in their way. One must thank them for their 
service and help them leave in a civilized manner. 
  [Smetanin] You call it "in a civilized manner," when an 
officer after 20 years of service with housing here is not 
permitted to leave without resigning his apartment, which, of 
course, leaves him without a roof over his head at his new place 
of service. Where is he to live with his family in such a case? 
  [Radetskyy] If such a thing happens, then, I will repeat 
myself, one has to approach it with steps appropriate to each 
individual case. I know about several such examples: Before 
leaving, fictitious divorces are settled, then a "betrayed" 
wife, having privatized her apartment, sells it for hard 
currency and drives off happily to be with her husband. Such 
things also happen, therefore, one must approach this carefully, 
but without offensive suspicion. 
  [Smetanin] During his time in office, your predecessor kept 
his office open to representatives of political parties, while 
making statements that the Army should be outside of politics... 
  [Radetskyy] When I received my nomination for the post of 
defense minister, representatives of many parties rushed to me 
with proposals on cooperation. However, I stated firmly that 
the Army will not be influenced by them. There is a law stating 
that we should be impartial and outside politics. The task of 
the Army is to defend the state from external enemies, not from 
internal ones; I will respect all political forces, but they 
should not exercise any influence here. The Armed Forces are 
ruled by state ideology. 
  [Smetanin] ...And it should be implemented by the workers of 
education as well as social and psychological services. 
However, it seems to me that these workers -- except for the 
replacing of Soviet marshals' portraits with those of Ukrainian 
hetmans -- have no other reasons to be proud of themselves. 
  [Radetskyy] What is more, upon examining the work of the 
social and psychological service, I did see that they have not 
accomplished anything during their two years of existence: They 
did not draft a single project, a single blueprint on their 
topics; they did not publish one single handbook! When I 
gathered them at a department meeting and asked whether anyone 
had conducted a training seminar with soldiers, it turned out 
that nobody had! Here you have a state ideology. It is not 
enough to shout about the immediate introduction of the state 
language in the Army. With regard to language, this issue does 
not need to be forced -- people will gradually adopt the 
language by themselves, without any pressure. 
  Besides, ideological work in the Army requires means; it 
requires a book on the history of Ukrainian statehood, which is 
inseparably linked with Russia's history. We were together 
during so many centuries, and not all of that past was so bad, 
as it is sometimes presented nowadays. I will add that we need 
to change people's attitudes toward our army and service in the 
Armed Forces, as well as the preparation of young people for 
military service. Let us take such a phenomenon as desertion 
from military units -- this happens even though we no longer 
have a transpolar region, a Karabakh, or even a Chukotka today... 
  I cannot understand this dividing servicemen into Russians, 
Ukrainians, Jews, and Tatars... If a serviceman is a Ukrainian 
citizen, if he is an able man and can be useful in the Army, he 
should be promoted and supported in every way possible. 
  [Smetanin] This can also be said, by the way, about the 
Soviet Army, criticized justly and unjustly nowadays, in which a 
native of Cherkassy Oblast, Ukrainian Vitaliy Radetskiy, has 
risen from the ranks to be commander of Odessa Military 
District. Later, he became Ukraine's defense minister.

  [Text] The press center of the Black Sea Fleet told an RIA 
correspondent today that a meeting of personnel of the Black Sea 
Fleet's Izmail river craft unit was held on 19 April. It was 
held in connection with the announcement by the Ukrainian 
Ministry of Defense that the unit was to be disbanded and the 3d 
River Guard Brigade was to be set up in its place. The unit's 
sailors have refused to obey the instructions of the Ministry of 
Defense on swearing allegiance to Ukraine. The unit's entire 
personnel has decided to prevent the seizure by force of the 
unit's vessels and coastal facilities and, as a result, river 
craft sailors are on alert from today.

<F P=106> [From the "Business News Weekly" feature No. 16, 11-17 April </F>
94] 
  [Text] The Ukrainian Verkhovna Rada's (parliament) 
resolution, which enacted the State Budget for 1994, provides 
for its quarterly revision. 
  Nonetheless, neither the parliament, nor its Committee for 
planning, budgeting, financing and pricing have stirred a finger 
to bring the issue under deliberations. 
  As Andrei Pecherov, chairman of the said committee, 
explained 
in an interview to UKRINFORM's correspondent, the interfering 
parliamentary elections are to blame. With the freshly elected 
parliament yet to convene its maiden plenary session the State 
Budget's performance in the first quarter, and hence, its 
correction, are highly improbable to ever occur. 
  It may be noted that the State Budget's miraculous 
deficit-free nature was very skeptically and reluctantly 
accepted by the MP's. Alas, it is precisely on what 
international financial institutions insist. In view of this, 
in the process of drafting the State Budget's deficit was 
gradually reduced to nil.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Igor Galkin] </F>
  [Text] Moscow April 21 TASS -- CIS countries owe to Russia 
altogether hundreds of billions of roubles for telephone and 
postal services, Vladimir Bulgak, Russian minister of 
communications, told ITAR-TASS. Meanwhile, Russia has fully 
repaid these republics for similar services. 
  The reason for one-way traffic in the settlement of accounts 
is that banks fail to settle the problem of so-called non-trade 
operations. Roubles freely flow to CIS states toward the 
payment for communications services, while the national 
currencies of CIS countries do not cross the Russian border 
without being exchanged for roubles at the appropriate rate. 
  In December last, communications ministers of CIS countries 
met in Minsk and issued a joint statement urging heads of CIS 
countries to influence their central banks to speed up mutual 
settlement, Bulgak said. Certain progress is in the offing, but 
the problem has not been solved in a cardinal way and the 
banking mechanism has not been adjusted. Money from Uzbekistan, 
Ukraine and other countries, even if they have it, cannot reach 
Russia. 
  "I talked on the matter with Chairman of the Russian Central 
Bank Viktor Gerashchenko four times. There is voluminous 
correspondence with the bank on the matter", Bulgak said. "We 
tried to cope with the situation by mutual settlement, clearing, 
barter and other settlement, but all this does not amount to a 
civilised way of dealing with the problem", Bulgak said.

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow April 21 TASS -- Newspapers focus their 
attention today on the social and economic problems of Russia. 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA carries an article by Sergey Glazyev, 
chairman of the State Duma committee on the economic policy. He 
believes that "the president's new economic policy was left 
unnoticed by the government." He writes: "A draft agreement on 
the establishment of civil peace, submitted for discussion by 
the working group, does not contain any specific proposals in 
the economic sphere, which threatens to turn the crucially 
important process of achieving accord in society on the key 
directions of the country's home and foreign policy into another 
formal function, which can only discredit the idea of the 
establishment of civil peace in Russia, for which our society 
has suffered so much." 
  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI publishes an article which explains to the 
readers such notions as the subsistence level, the poverty line 
and the minimal consumer breadbasket. "The cost of the consumer 
breadbasket in Russia was 40,000 roubles in March this year, 
while the per capita subsistence level was about 60,000 roubles 
in the same month. In January 1993 35.5 per cent of Russian 
citizens had money incomes below the subsistence level. The 
figure for December 1993 was 26.7 per cent, and for March 1994 
-- 17.5 per cent. In 1993 13 per cent of the country's 
population had incomes, which were smaller than the cost of the 
minimal set of basic foodstuffs. The figure for the first 
quarter of 1994 was 6 per cent." 
  The newspaper explains such a wide range of criteria for 
determining the living standards of Russians by the fact that at 
present there is no law on the subsistence level. "Four versions 
of the draft law on the subsistence level, which explain the 
term in this or that way, have been submitted for consideration 
to the State Duma committee on social issues. Meanwhile, our 
incomes are compared either with the subsistence level, or with 
the cost of the consumer breadbasket, when our living standards 
are determined," the newspaper writes. 
  TRUD carries an article dealing with the economic reform in 
Russia, which is entitled "delayed-action mine". "The excessive 
stratification of society is creating a serious threat for the 
reform. When the difference in wages between the `upper' and 
`lower' groups reaches 40 times, it will mean the end to the 
Russian reform. The growing non-payment of wages is aggravating 
the situation. A total amount of the non-paid wages, which was 
increasing from one month to the next, reached two trillion 374 
billion roubles by April 1. Some 20 million people have not 
received the wages that are due to them." 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA publishes an article under the headline "How 
the Black Sea Fleet should be divided." It analyses the 
agreement on the stage-by-stage settlement of problems of the 
Black Sea Fleet, which was signed recently. "Will the agreement 
boost cooperation, or will it become a mine laid under 
Russian-Ukrainian relations? Ten days, set by the agreement 
which was signed on April 15, are expiring, but there is no 
mechanism of the division of the fleet in a new proportion. 
Dificulties are sure to emerge when the sides start to 
determine what part of the fleet will go to each of the sides. 
First, it is difficult to say how many of the fleet's ships will 
make 15-20 per cent. Second, Ukraine is not going to take into 
account in the negotiating process the part of the fleet, which 
it has already appropriated unilaterally and which includes 
several ships and about 60 units and facilities of the Black Sea 
Fleet." 
  PRAVDA carries an article about the Bosnian crisis. It 
criticises Russian diplomacy in the Balkan peninsula and points 
out that "the proparanda uproar about the recent accomplishments 
of Moscow diplomats in the Bosnian conflict is intended for 
naive people. The game has long been played on a different 
field... Russia actually has no policy in the Balkan peninsula." 
  SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA frontpages an article about the birth 
anniversary of Vladimir Lenin. The newspaper writes that the 
Lenin mausoleum will be opened on April 22.

<F P=106> [Interview with Anatol Plugaru, former minister of national </F>
security of the Republic of Moldova, by Iulian Chifu, place and 
date not given: "The Solution for the Conflict in Dniester 
Region Is To Establish a NATO Base on the Other Bank of the 
Dniester River"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  The Political Race Follows Its Course </H5>
  [Chifu] Mr. Plugaru, your activity has been closely 
connected with the period of the war in the Dniester region. 
How come that the Republic of Moldova became divided into two 
parts? 
  [Plugaru] The site where God places us becomes an advantage 
only when we know how to make use of it, the way in, which, for 
example, Stefan cel Mare [ruler of Moldova in the 15th century] 
did. If we do not do it, others will make use of it in their 
own interests, the way Russia did in the past and continues to 
do today. When it became clear that the "union" with Russia 
will not live long, some wise Russians found the way to calm 
down the "display of sovereignty." Thus, the malady called the 
Moldovan Dniester Republic appeared on the banks of the Dniester 
River and it finds solid support in the 14th Russian Army. 
There was much dispute on the issue of this strip of land, just 
like in all the other places where the Russians are not pleased 
with the locals. The Russians consider all the locals to be bad 
sorts. The Russians believe that their rights are violated, 
they are oppressed, they are not bosses everywhere, and on top 
of it, they are asked to speak the language of the locals. The 
Russians are not used to all this. If the world is not good, 
the world has to be changed, because all those Moldovans, 
Georgians, Latvians, and others are demanding too much. While in 
Russia -- the country that has assumed the responsibility to 
protect all of them from good or from evil, throughout this 
"immense homeland," and the country that has suffered from birth 
of an insatiable hunger for foreign lands -- the great political 
race is in full swing and each participant in the race wants to 
acquire more and more land for Russia. We have to accept the 
thought that Russia can be led only by those who become the 
winners in this race, which might also be called chauvinism. 
Because all those who do not practice chauvinism have no place 
in the Olympus of the Russian leadership. Everything that is 
happening in the world today speaks of Russia's increasingly 
aggressive and unstoppable intention to preserve what it 
conquered in the past and to gain new spheres of influence. 
Thus, it is clear that the Dniester region as well as other 
areas where Russia has its own interest will still suffer if no 
cure is found soon to this malady. 
  [Chifu] What is the role of the 14th Army in Dniester? Who 
are the enemies from whom this Army has to defend the Russian 
Federation in Tiraspol? 
  [Plugaru] No mater how strange it seems, and although the 
big politics are not made in Chisinau, all the cure that we need 
can be found here at home. First of all I am referring to our 
location, since we are at the crossroads of the world. We must 
understand that this place is suitable for all kind of 
exercises, military occupation, coups, counter-coups, and for 
the utilization of all kinds of weapons aimed in all directions; 
certainly, all this in the name and interest of Russia. We can 
also notice that the 14th Army faces a beautiful and prosperous 
country that is called Turkey, with which Russia has been 
"friends" for centuries on end. 
  I am not familiar with Russia's military doctrine and its 
secret plans, thus I do not know whom it has in mind for the 
role of the next most-probable adversary. However, I know very 
well that, still, in the time of the Soviet Union, nobody in the 
Command of the South-West Armies, located in Chisinau, was 
concealing for whom the missiles in our forests, the planes in 
Marculesti and Bolgrad, the airborne troops in Chisinau, the 
means of communication, and all the other facilities of the 14th 
Army were meant. Greece is not too far away either, not to 
speak of Bulgaria, Romania, Germany, or Italy. I do not believe 
that these countries feel too much at ease knowing that General 
Lebed [head of the 14th Army] is in Dniester -- who initially 
promised to hang all the Moldovan leaders -- or knowing that 
there is a loony in Russia's State Duma who wants to wash his 
boots not only in the Mediterranean, but also in the Indian 
Ocean [Vladimir Zhirinovskiy]. Or, maybe they put their hope in 
the one who recently chided Nixon, because he thought they were 
sitting and having a drink [Yeltsin]. Poor of him, he could 
hardly stand. And just think that he has access to the button 
that can destroy the world. 
  One can hear rumors that he will be demoted soon. Let them 
do it, it is their problem. But what if the loony comes to 
power? Needless to say that these people were not appointed and 
did not seize power, but were elected by and are dear to tens of 
millions of Russians. As far as Lebed is concerned, I believe 
that due to his outstanding qualities, he will advance in 
position and will be soon one of the leaders of Russia's Armed 
Forces. And if what he does is called saving Russia, we have to 
expect other promotions as well. 
  The State of Neutrality Is Convenient If You Have Means With 
Which To Defend Yourself [subhead] 
  [Chifu] Nevertheless, what solution do you see to these 
problems? How do you think that the current leadership in 
Moldova and the West should act? 
  [Plugaru] I believe that one of the solutions would be to 
establish a modern military base on the other bank of the 
Dniester River. Whose base should that be? Whoever you wish, 
because in our situation it is the same for us. Certainly, the 
country with which we have the best understanding should have 
priority, but at the same time, that country should have 
everything necessary to make the presence of the Russian troops 
in this part of Moldova unnecessary. I believe that the most 
suitable country would be Turkey. It has the means and the 
reason, and it is also familiar with these places... However, 
it is essential for us to open our doors and tell the whole 
world what our problem is. A part of the world will get scared, 
others will decide against getting involved, and others, who 
have the means with which to face Russia, you can be sure will 
come and will even thank us. Probably, the country or the 
groups of countries that will accept the proposal, will 
establish a base in two-three months and will bring over 
everything that they need. It is Russia that should worry about 
the rest. 
  [Chifu] Recently, the Republic of Moldova signed the 
Partnership for Peace. How does this act match all that you 
have suggested and the neutrality for which people voted on 6 
March at the same time when the opinion poll "What People 
Advise" was held? 
  [Plugaru] We will have to be patient with the already 
proclaimed neutrality, because we have no other choice. 
Neutrality is fine, but only when you have means with which to 
defend yourself, or you have guarantees that somebody is ready 
to defend you. It is not sufficient, and even dangerous, to 
limit ourselves to measures such as Partnership for Peace. All 
these things for which you have to pay nothing, will result in 
nothing. Such things are good, but they mean only a first step, 
nothing else, and only as long as Russia does not do anything 
foolish. Those who invented the idea of the Partnership for 
Peace meant well, but you see, Russia did not like it, it does 
not like to be isolated, so it came at once to sit at the big 
table. We should not have illusions that this would ensure the 
preservation of peace in the region. Were we not members of the 
United Nations when Russia, a member of the same organization, 
attacked us in summer 1992 in Dniester? Europe and the new 
world have signed, and will still continue to sign, alliances, 
blocs, pacts, and all kinds of treaties but, ever since the 
world began, the powerful ones were the ones who started wars. 
People like us were witnesses, victims, or were simply ignored. 
Certainly you can feel like the United States and Japan, or can 
even look like them, but this will not make you stronger. Power 
has always been and will continue to be decisive. And the 
powerful ones know each other. Thus, we should not rail against 
relations with Russia. Although nobody can rely on today's 
Russia -- it does not know itself what is happening to it -- 
however, willingly or unwillingly, we have to accept friendship 
with it because we have no other choice. But to completely lose 
our self-esteem, the way Russia wants, is not possible either. 
If we preserve out self-esteem and we want the world to respect 
us, we should know how to convey to Russia the message to forget 
its intentions. That is what I meant when I talked about a 
small military base to oppose the Tiraspol base. 
  [Chifu] How will Russia react to such an initiative? 
  [Plugaru] Officially, it has no say in it because it is our 
own business with whom we associate and what we do at home, and 
Russia's borders are far away from us. Certainly, it would try 
to stop us by putting pressure on those who make decisions on 
such matters. Nevertheless, in the end it will accept it 
because there are countries in this world with which Russia is 
compelled to speak with respect and with much deference. Apart 
from that, it might be possible that the separatist tendencies 
that have engulfed Russia will inevitably lead to its 
dismantlement and, one day, when it has no time to think about 
the Dniester region, it will have to give up this region. What 
we are suggesting will help Russia to reach this conclusion 
sooner. At the same time, we do not really have a choice, there 
are not that many variations from which we can choose or that 
many ways in which to cut the Gordian Knot. 
<H5>  Mature Countries Are No Longer Fighting, They Are </H5>
Distributing Weapons to Others 
  [Chifu] The Republic of Moldova is currently holding 
negotiations for the withdrawal of the 14th Army from its 
territory. What will be the fate of that army? 
  [Plugaru] All these negotiation for the withdrawal of the 
14th Army, unconditionally or on certain conditions, have been 
both this year and the year before, just talks held in vain. 
These negotiations have to be held because there is nothing 
better to do and Russia has to be told every day that it is 
occupying a part of our land and that it has to gather in all 
those weapons that it distributed to bandits. Nevertheless, 
ultimately the negotiations will not lead to the withdrawal of 
the 14th Army. It cannot happen because it is at variance with 
Russia's strategic interests. It does not matter that today the 
nature of wars has changed somehow, namely rich countries are no 
longer fighting but rather distributing weapons to others, 
leaving them to shoot each other and then, it can purchase what 
is left for peanuts. Mature countries are conquering new 
territories, new assets, however not through military operations 
but economic ones. In our case, the importance of military 
operations is still topical because Russia has not reached the 
stage of economic operations. It is just training at the 
expense of the former Soviet republics. 
  Thus, Russia will not leave so easily and so soon. You can 
rest assured that if today Russia's reason for staying is that 
it has to preserve peace in this area and defend Russians from 
who knows whom, tomorrow, when it becomes clear for everybody 
that this is just an excuse not to leave this area, it will 
invent another excuse. And how could Russia possible leave? 
While it stays in the Dniester region, it does what it wants in 
the Republic of Moldova, Romania, and Ukraine. Even in Ukraine, 
a country that allowed the separatists to emerge and flourish. 
The affirmation that, all this time while we were occupied, 
including the time of the conflict, Ukraine has been neutral or 
even helped us, is pure demagogy. As a matter of fact, Ukraine 
refused to open the joint border crossing points that would have 
been more useful for both sides and that would have isolated the 
criminals in Tiraspol from the whole world. Certainly, the 
separatists and the 14th Army would not have dared fire at these 
joint points because they would have started a war with Ukraine. 
But, to our great regret, Ukraine certainly remained "neutral" 
only in words, because everything that emerged from Dniester on 
land, water, or air, crossed Ukraine. 
  [Chifu] Nevertheless, how does Ukraine view the presence 
of the 14th Army, under conditions of dissent with Russia on the 
issue of Black Sea fleet and especially the Crimea region? 
  [Plugaru] Ukraine feels the real pain in its Western side. 
It feels that it will hear the noise of shooting from those 
weapons that were crossing the "neutral" Ukraine. Only God 
knows how much military technology has been collected in 
Dniester region. From this place the Russians do what they want 
with Romania. Because I have to tell you truthfully, the 14th 
Army has modern systems of electronic radio espionage devices. 
They are working hard on systems to intercept telephone 
connections from a distance, and there are other devices for 
stealing information in general, because this part in territory 
of the Republic of Moldova is a wonderful intermediary base for 
the activity of Russian secret services. From what other part 
could Russia's security services come closer to Moldova or 
Romania? Its agents feel in their element in this part of the 
world. There are practically no serious restrictions that might 
hamper their free circulation on the 
Russia-Tiraspol-Chisinau-Bucharest route. It does not matter 
anymore what depth into Romania Lebed's technology reached. 
<H5>  Romania Should Never Forget Where the Policy Promoted by </H5>
King Carol II Led 
  [Chifu] What is Romania's role in this region? 
  [Plugaru] I believe that, first of all, we should ask the 
question: Is Russia indeed the country that wants a stronger 
and independent Greater Romania? If the answer is yes, then 
long live Russia and the 14th Army. But what if the answer is 
no? How can we face it? What is our army today and what can it 
do? What is the Romanian Army compared to Russia's and when did 
Russia produce the weapons that Romania's armed forces are using 
today? I do not believe that the recent replacement of General 
Spiroiu [former Romanian defense Minister] is connected with the 
answer to this question, just as it has no connection with the 
other changes that took place in Bucharest. New commotion and 
turmoil in the structures that must ensure state security never 
led to anything good. However, if too much garbage has been 
collected, it is good to dispose of it, otherwise it will 
dispose of you. However, Romania must never forget where the 
policy promoted by King Carol II led. If one wishes for the 
country to be united at home, one should take into account what 
is happening around it. It is not possible that one has no 
trustworthy allies. 
  [Chifu] You said that "they cannot make us unite." Are you 
in favor of unification? 
  [Plugaru] Mr. Chifu, one cannot just foolishly shout 
"unification" without knowing the answer to a few questions in 
advance: What is Russia's attitude and possible reaction? What 
will the Hungarians and Bulgarians do? What will Ukraine say, 
although it is in a state of discord with Russia? Who would 
benefit from a united Romania? Which of the superpowers will 
support us? And who will want to stop us? It is important to 
know things, not only to wish for them and also to be able to 
act, not only today but tomorrow too, and even in the most 
unfavorable circumstances. If you do not exactly know what you 
are doing and you are just feeling your way, then it does not 
matter whether you are a lunatic or insane person, or somebody 
just got hold of you and you are working for him. No one can 
invent a greater disfavor than this for Romania, for the 
Republic of Moldova, and for Romanians in general. It is not bad 
to wish for something and dream about it. What I said does not 
refer to honest people, who do have great aspirations and who 
act according to their feelings, because they believe that is 
the normal thing to do. I am talking about those who make 
politics without looking around. I am talking about those who 
are duty-bound to know and to weigh things -- as any person, 
party, or state should do -- before calling on masses of people 
and before moving borders and relations with other people, with 
or without involving the Army. This is the concern of all of us 
who in one way or another have made a contribution to the 
deterioration of relations with Russia. And I am one of them. 
  Just look at all the fuss made by Russia about the so-called 
rights and interests of Russians who live beyond Russia's 
borders. Have you noticed how, for several month on end, Russian 
propaganda has been striving to prove to the whole world that 
ethnic Russians, their fellow citizens, are oppressed and their 
rights and freedoms are being violated; in short, that they need 
help! 
  Since we are in the situation of the small and harassed one, 
or rather in the situation of the little one who has been beaten 
up by an older person, it would be advisable if we did not rush 
in with an answer, because in any event we are going to grow up, 
while he will be just growing older.

  [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 19/4/1994 -- President Mircea 
Snegur signed today a decree on paying off the arrears and 
stabilizing the financial situation of Moldovan enterprises and 
organizations. According to the decree, the National Bank and 
commercial banks will compensate the mutual debts using the 
financial means of the enterprises and organizations and 
budgetary means as well. The Republican and local commissions 
must compile by 15 May the list of the enterprises with debts 
and deposit and hard currency accounts opened in the Moldovan 
commercial banks and abroad; they must count the sums thus 
deposited. They will have to count the sums of unrepatriated 
hard currency for the export of goods and services. According 
to the decree, the Ministry of Finance, the State Central Fiscal 
Inspectorate and the Financial Guard will levy the delayed 
payments to the budget from the enterprises' hard currency 
accounts. The state enterprises and organizations were allowed 
to sell at auctions as IOU's their debts. According to sources 
from the Ministry of Finance the mutual debts are over 400-500 
million lei.

19 April 1994; compiled by Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey 
Petrovskiy, edited by Vladimir Shishlin] 
  [Text] The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development 
(EBRD) is expected to provide a $150-million worth of credits to 
Moldova by the end of this year, Prime Minister Andrey Sangeli 
told reporters in Kishinev [Chisinau] on Monday. He said that a 
total of $100 million would be granted in the first half of this 
year for a glass factory project designed to manufacture bottles 
for dry and vintage wines and champagne meeting European 
standards. A further $50 million is to spent for the 
construction of an environmentally safe power station in the 
town of Beltsy. 
  Other projects under discussion include the refurbishment of 
wine and canned product factories to help increase Moldova's 
exports to the West as well as a port facility on the Danube 
river and fast railway line from Kishinev to Yassy. IF Note: 
Until recently, Moldova depended on IMF and the World Bank for 
financial aide now running at more than $300 million. EBRD is 
expected to open credit lines for direct financing of the 
country's key economic sectors including vineries and wine 
industry which account for 45 percent of its annual foreign 
earnings. The project covers 10 vineries, which can help toward 
higher wine exports when updated. This year, Moldova is 
expected to sell a total of 30 million bottles of champagne, dry 
and vintage wines which makes up 8-10 percent of the total 
produced (wine exports to Russia run at 55 percent).

  [Text] Kishinev [Chisinau] 19 April TASS -- Leader of the 
unrecognised Gagauz Republic Stepan Topal believes that "every 
condition for the political settlement of the Gagauz problem has 
been created in Moldova." He told this on Tuesday to ITAR-TASS 
on a basis of the results of the Monday meeting with Moldovan 
President Mircea Snegur with whom problems of settlement of the 
Gagauz problems were, specifically, discussed. 
  Topal said Snegur had shortly promissed to submit to the 
Moldovan parliament a draft law on granting a special status to 
districts predominantly peopled by Gagauz. "We have proposed a 
draft law on creating the autonomous region Gagauzeri, which 
largely coincides with Kishinev's proposals and does not run 
counter to the principles of preserving Moldova's territorial 
intergity," Topal said. "Their essence is to grant broad powers 
to local government bodies." 
  It is of essential importance for Gagauz that the draft 
keeps 
the provision of the right of the Gagauz people to 
self-determination in case Moldova's political status changes, 
Topal said. "Gagauz wish to have basic guarantees that Moldova 
keeps on independence track and that we shall not wake up in a 
different country one fine morning," Topal said.

  [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 19/4/1994 -- Andrei Sangheli 
strengthened his popularity though his forming of a new ministry 
cabinet, reduced at his suggestion, commented alongside the poll 
made by "Axa" service and published in the weekly "MOLODEZH 
MOLDOVY." The results of the poll show that Premier Sangheli is 
preferred by 46 percent and Speaker Petru Lucinschi by 31 
percent of respondents. In third place of the poll is situated 
Nicolae Andronic, vice-president of the Moldovan Parliament, 
preferred by 23 percent of those interviewed. The same poll 
also charts the popularity of the Parliamentary factions. The 
Democratic Agrarian Party [PDAM] is the most popular, 67 percent 
preferred it. The Socialist Party and "Unitate-Edinstvo" 
Movement received, respectively, 29 percent and 4 percent. The 
unionist forces have a low popularity compared with the 
electoral period. This is prompted by an apparent lack of 
constructive activity. Until now the right wing opposition 
confined itself only to "undivided rejection and tough, emotive 
and unfounded attacks against the deputies of the majority 
faction," states the commentary in "MOLODEZH MOLDOVY."

  [Text] In adopting the decision to join the CIS, the 
Chisinau parliament reconfirmed the criminal Molotov-Ribbentrop 
pact and annulled the essential right of the Romanian nation for 
the integrity of its historic and spiritual territory, says the 
statement of the chamber of the Romanian parliament's deputies 
published by the newspaper Tsara, an organ of the Christian 
Democratic Popular Front of Moldova. 
  The statement points out that in 1812 and 1940 Bessarabia 
was 
torn from its homeland by means of agreements between various 
powers and despite the will of the Romanian people. 
  "The events which took place in 1989 and later made us 
hopeful that Bessarabia would be re-unified with its 
motherland," asserted the Romanian parliamentarians and said 
that the USSR Supreme Soviet had called the Molotov-Ribbentrop 
pact "which tore Bessarabia from Romania in 1940" invalid. 
  The chamber also gave its backing to Moldova's efforts to be 
integrated into European structures and "condemns actions of 
political forces trying to again include Moldova into the 
previous structures."

  [Text] Cutbacks in Russian gas exports to Moldova will hit 
living standards, Vice Premier Valeriu Bulgaru who is 
responsible for the agro-industrial complex believes. In an 
interview with INTERFAX on Wednesday, he said the government was 
seeking to raise extra funds to be able to clear arrears for gas 
imports from Russia. 
  Bulgar said the cabinet was working hard to try to resolve 
the problem of a trade deficit with Russia. 
  At the same time, he said the problem of gas imports from 
Russia was of general concern from government officials down to 
ordinary consumers. In his view, the mechanisms of a market 
economy will push energy consumers towards unusual 
decisionmaking. 
  On Tuesday, one other Vice Premier Valentin Cunev whose area 
of responsibility covers transport, construction and energy said 
that gas supply to industrial consumers would be reduced by a 
third. He called on consumers to stick to the principle of 
"reduce consumption if you cannot pay."

  [Text] Moscow April 20 TASS--Controversial leader of the 
Liberal-Democratic Party Vladimir Zhirinovskiy failed to make it 
to State Duma vice-presidency on Wednesday. 
  Four deputy chairmen of the Russian parliament's lower house 
were elected earlier, elections of the fifth one were held on 
Wednesday, but gave no result. Ten candidates were nominated for 
the vacant office in the beginning. Two of them withdrew their 
candidatures. 
  Zhirinovskiy and Artur Chilingarov, representative of the 
"New Regional Policy" faction, were at the head of the poll. 
However, none of them managed to win a majority of the total 
number of votes at the decisive run of the poll. 
  According to Ivan Rybkin, chairman of the parliament's lower 
house, Duma factions should now "hold (joint) consultations to 
specify when the elections of the fifth deputy chairman should 
be put on the agenda once more".

<F P=106> [Yelena Kotelnikova report under the "Privatization </F>
Prospects" rubric: "State Duma Not Ready To Change 
Privatization Course"] 
  [Text] The hearings on the results of denationalization 
and the 1994 privatization program attended by deputies of both 
chambers of the Federal Assembly, which ended yesterday at the 
State Duma, have split the representative authority into 
"Chubays supporters," "Chubays opponents," those favoring the 
sale of state property at market prices, and those who oppose 
"the expansion of foreign capital." Evidently, the mutually 
exclusive nature of the proposals drawn up by the deputies can 
block any decision on privatization they might decide to make. 
This situation will enable the president to assume the key role 
in the drafting and implementation of denationalization policy. 
  The final day of the expanded hearings at the State Duma 
(KOMMERSANT-DAILY reported their beginning 13 April) enabled 
various political associations to present their views on 
privatization and its further prospects. As expected, 
privatization (as was the case with the Supreme Soviet) remains 
an apple of discord between the executive and representative 
branches. Unlike the government, which now knows for sure that 
further privatization should be carried out in favor of 
investment and "an effective owner," the deputies lacked a joint 
approach. Whereas Sergey Glazyev of the Democratic Party of 
Russia faction demanded a change in the policy of check 
privatization, which "has led us into a deadlock and a morass," 
Vladimir Martemyanov, representative of the Communist Party, 
opposed "the unprecedented sale of Russian enterprises to 
foreign capitalists." As an alternative, he proposes that 
denationalization be replaced with destatization, as a result of 
which the bulk of enterprises will be transferred into 
"collective ownership," and privatization will be limited "only 
to small enterprises." 
  Vladimir Lisichkin and Vyacheslav Marychev, representatives 
of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR], attempted in 
their addresses and statements from the audience to expose "the 
criminal nature" of privatization "according to Chubays." The 
main pathos of their pronouncements and recommendations was 
designed to give reasons for the State Property Committee 
chairman's removal, particularly because "he has been tripping 
up the president." Driven by concern over the president, Mr. 
Marychev said that "the LDPR will not let Chubays out of Norilsk 
once he has left for it" (the deputy prime minister is going to 
Norilsk on a business trip). 
  Meanwhile, representatives of "Russia's Choice" backed the 
post- voucher privatization concept drawn up by the State 
Property Committee and proposed that the state intensify control 
over the management of state property and the state's share in 
denationalized enterprises. Although this stance did not draw 
support from representatives of other political organizations, 
Chubays (a "Russia's Choice" member) said that he was "content 
with the results of the hearings." The deputies' political 
ambitions make it impossible for them to control 
denationalization. This situation has strengthened Viktor 
Chernomyrdin, who, according to Chubays, "will not allow 
privatization to halt" (among other things, yesterday the prime 
minister signed the decree "On the Practice of Agricultural 
Changes in Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast," approving the experience of 
land denationalization). Since the head of the cabinet has 
approved in general the post-voucher privatization concept aimed 
at involving "an effective owner" in economic development, the 
State Property Committee drafters see their chances to implement 
these plans increasing.

<F P=106> [Dmitriy Kuznets report under the "Hearings" rubric: </F>
"Government Plans To Liberalize Foreign Trade Over Resistance of 
Deputies and Bureaucrats"] 
  [Text] At the State Duma hearings on foreign economic 
policy yesterday officials from the Foreign Economic Relations 
Ministry [FERM], the government staff, the Finance Ministry, and 
the Central Bank told the deputies about the state of affairs in 
the area of foreign trade. The FERM report called the 
introduction of higher import tariffs "a forced protectionist 
measure." The FERM expects that domestic producers will spend 
their profits on lowering production costs and raising the 
quality of goods in order gradually to achieve world standards 
in these indicators. As for the inflationary effect of the 
increase in import tariffs, the FERM said that the fiscal side 
to the new measure would "offset" the natural growth in the 
prices of goods, thus increasing budget revenues. 
  Along with import tariffs, export tariffs have also been 
imposed. However, they are "aimed at liberalizing exports." The 
FERM sees this step as a transition from state monopoly to free 
trade. By mid-1995 it is expected fully to abolish export 
quotas and licenses, the institution of special exporters, and 
other "non-economic" controls over the export of goods. As for 
the tariffs, they will become "the rein that the government will 
slowly loosen." 
  The result of the country's foreign economic activity in 
1993 
was a trade surplus of $16 billion. It is impossible to channel 
the entire amount to investment in production and so forth 
because one- third of it is spent on bringing into Russia 
foreign cash that ends up being kept by the population and banks 
as savings, and another third goes to service the foreign and 
domestic hard-currency debts. 
  Hard-currency earnings have also been hit by the release of 
Russian commodities onto the world market at dumping prices. 
Budget revenues have been dented by various foreign economic 
benefits granted to regions, sectors, and enterprises. In 1995 
most benefits may be "suspended," while expenditures on 
centralized imports will be halted. 
  The general trend toward foreign trade liberalization will 
encounter resistance by domestic producers, however, who demand 
state protection and benefits, and will also meet open 
obstruction from government bureaucrats. For instance, Mr. 
Tsyplakov, government staff official dealing with foreign trade 
problems, said that "given the complete collapse of the economy 
it is a mistake for the state to give up its monopoly in foreign 
economic ties." Many deputies who attended the hearings 
yesterday shared his stance.

<F P=106> [Dmitriy Kamin report in the "State Duma Hearings on Foreign </F>
Economic Activity" column: "Sergey Glazyev Wants To Take 
Control of Arms Export"] 
  [Text] The effectiveness of parliamentary hearings as a 
process in the search for solutions is close to zero so far, and 
yesterday's discussion in the Duma of foreign activity problems 
confirmed this. Nonetheless, the aspiration by Economic Policy 
Committee Chairman Sergey Glazyev to tighten up control of 
foreign economic activity caused concern of such exporters as 
the Rosvooruzheniye corporation: The firm refused to provide 
the hearing information about its activity. 
  The subject of arms export and related investment problems 
of 
the military industrial complex enterprises were discussed in 
camera, with the participation of general designers, and prior 
to that representatives of the government, Foreign Economic 
Relations, and Central Bank apparatuses briefed the deputies on 
the general state and prospects of foreign economic activity. 
  Ivan Materov, first deputy foreign economic relations 
minister, told the house that at present the government cannot 
make decisions on lifting export quotas because the insolvency 
of Russian consumers leaves them without the requisite 
resources, which have not been sold abroad only because no 
export licenses have been granted. Materov, however, confirmed 
that from 1995 most of the quotas will be phased out. Sergey 
Tsyplakov, chief of the government apparatus' foreign economic 
activity department, motivated the need to lift export quotas by 
the fact that the current quota and license system encourages 
abuses: "In some export-related spheres things are running 
wild." The government apparatus representative expressed 
special concern over the growing disparity between Russian 
exporters' contractual prices and world prices. Mr. Tsyplakov 
closed his statement with the conclusion about the need to step 
up state control of foreign economic activity. 
  The participants also recognized as a priority the search 
for 
sources to repay Russia's foreign debt for which purpose it is 
proposed to use promissory note circulation and sell Russian 
state property (quite possibly, Petr Aven and Alfa-Bank will 
attend to this in the end). 
  According to information in KOMMERSANT-DAILY's possession, 
the Glazyev committee in the very near future is to submit to 
the Duma's consideration a number of bills on regulating foreign 
economic activity (On Foreign Economic Activity, On Changes to 
the Law on Foreign Investments in the RFSFR and Concession 
Contracts, and On Production-Sharing Arrangements) which 
envision a clear-cut separation of all functions of the federal 
power bodies in the sphere of foreign economic activity. 
  One of the indispensable elements of the future system is 
tough control of arms exports. According to information in 
KOMMERSANT-DAILY's possession, at yesterday's closed session 
Rosvooruzheniye's monopoly activity in this sphere received a 
rather negative assessment on the part of military industrial 
complex enterprise representatives who are unhappy with the 
distribution of incomes from the sale of their production. It 
is noteworthy that Sergey Glazyev regards the cadre and 
technological potential of these enterprises as the foundation 
for overcoming industrial decline in Russia.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Alexandrova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow April 20 TASS--A number of substantive 
amendments have been made to Russia's criminal code. They are 
needed to unify criminal liability for encroachment on all kinds 
of property, to enhance criminal liability for terrorism and 
contraband, to guarantee citizens' rights to necessary defence 
and more effective struggle against organised crime. Such is 
the essence of the federal law on amendments and supplements to 
the Russian criminal code and the Russian code of criminal 
procedure passed by the State Duma in the second reading on 
Wednesday. 
  A number of amendments have been made to the criminal code 
in 
connection with a radical change of the socio-political 
situation in Russia over the recent years. Thus, wordings such 
as "socialist property" are dropped from the criminal code. 
References to crimes against "state and public property" are 
eliminated. All forms of property become equal. For instance, 
an encroachment on an enterprise of any kind, regardless of the 
form of property, is qualified as banditry. 
  A new definition is given to such crimes as theft, robbery, 
plunder, fraud. The criminal code is supplemented with an 
article envisaging criminal liability for a failure to restore 
to Russia objects of artistic, historic or architectural value 
for Russian people if such a restoration is obligatory. 
Articles are introduced that envisage criminal responsibility 
for evading the payment of customs duties and for violating 
customs legislation. Separate articles envisages criminal 
liability for terrorism and for obstructing the discharge of 
duties by a procurator, an investigator or persons conducting an 
investigation. 
  During the debating of the draft law on Wednesday the 
deputies extended from 10 to 12 years the maximum term of 
imprisonment for a theft in a particularly large amount 
committed by organised groups or by particularly dangerous 
habitual criminals. 
  On an initiative of the faction of the Democratic Party of 
Russia, the criminal code was supplemented with two articles 
envisaging criminal liability for illegal transactions with 
foreign currency and for concealment or failure to remit sums in 
foreign currency.

"On the Parliamentary Hearings `The Fight Against Crime and the

signed by Federation Council Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko and 
dated 8 April 1994, followed by the findings of the hearings 
under the general heading: "The Fight Against Crime and the 
Strengthening of Law and Order in the Russian Federation"] 
  [Text] The Federation Council decrees that: 
  1. The assessment, conclusions, and recommendations 
contained in the findings of the parliamentary hearings "The 
Fight Against Crime and the Strengthening of Law and Order in 
the Russian Federation" (appended) shall be considered the 
official position of the Federation Council. 
  2. The aforesaid findings shall be sent to the Russian 
Federation president, the Russian Federation Federal Assembly 
State Duma, the Russian Federation Government, the Russian 
Federation Supreme Court, the Russian Federation Supreme Court 
of Arbitration, the Russian Federation Prosecutor's Office, and 
legislative (representative) organs of Russian Federation 
components. 
  [Signed] V.F. Shumeyko, chairman of the Russian 
Federation Federal Assembly Federation Council 
  [Dated]Moscow, 8 April 1994 
  No. 97-I SF 
  In recent years the crime problem in the Russian Federation 
has sharply deteriorated. The scale of crime and its tendency 
to increase are dangerously deforming the course of reform and 
are posing a threat to the basic foundations of Russian 
statehood, constitutional legality, and citizens' security. 
  The level of crime has more than doubled compared with 1988. 
In 1993 there were 2.8 million recorded crimes, of which more 
than 500,000 were serious. These included almost 30,000 
murders, 67,000 cases of grievous bodily harm, more than 200,000 
robberies and muggings, and 22,500 crimes involving the use of 
firearms. Young people have been actively drawn into criminal 
activity. In 1993 224,000 crimes were committed by juveniles. 
Of particular concern is the growth in organized crime, which 
employs methods of criminal terror such as hostage-taking, 
blackmail, and others. Criminal formations are engaged in 
large-scale racketeering and drug trafficking, are striving to 
establish control over the banks, spheres of enterprise, and the 
distribution of material resources, and are linking up with 
corrupt elements in the state apparatus. Illegal exports of oil, 
raw materials, and metals have become unprecedentedly 
widespread. Violence and threats are increasingly employed 
against militia officers, investigators, prosecutors, judges, 
workers in financial, tax, and customs services, crime victims, 
witnesses, and citizens who help the law-enforcement organs. 
  The main reasons for the spread of crime lie in the critical 
state and instability of society, in the legal nihilism that 
grips power structures at all levels, in the lack of a 
crime-prevention system, and in the inadequate legal base, 
serious shortcomings in law-enforcement practice, and the low 
clear-up rate for serious crimes. 
  To a considerable extent the crime situation has gotten out 
of control. Statistics on crime and the reduction in its growth 
rate do not reflect the real state of affairs. The level of 
latent crime remains high. Many organs of power and 
administration at the center and at local level have opted out 
of the fight against crime and its prevention, deal with crime 
on a case-to-case basis, and fail to monitor the implementation 
of decisions that are reached. 
  Internal affairs organs, prosecutor's offices, the tax 
police, and the customs services are failing to put a resolute 
stop to criminal activities or to ensure that punishment is 
inescapable. Irresponsibility and complacency are shown by 
officials to the victims of crime, while the criminals are shown 
leniency. There is no proper reaction to a considerable number 
of reports of crimes and other breaches of the law. Unfounded 
refusals to institute criminal proceedings have become 
widespread, along with cases being halted or ended. Many 
dangerous crimes remain unsolved. As a result, citizens' faith 
in the authorities' ability to protect them is being undermined. 
  The crime situation and its demoralizing effect on all 
spheres of social life require the adoption of effective 
measures to change the situation and to ensure constant and 
unremitting attention to the crime problem by all organs of 
power and administration, the public, and the mass media. 
  The curbing of aggressive and violent crime, the fundamental 
enhancement of the standard of all work to prevent and curtail 
manifestations of crime, and the strengthening of public order 
are urgent tasks. 
  The strengthening of statehood, the striving for 
stabilization in political, economic, social, and spiritual 
spheres of society's life, and consideration of crime factors 
when implementing reform should be the abiding conditions for 
achieving real results. 
  At the same time, all the measures that are being taken 
should be based on strict observance of legality and the norms 
of international law. 
  Particular attention should be focused on improving the 
legal 
base and law-enforcement practice, on upgrading the level of 
law-enforcement organs' activity, and on involving all of 
society's healthy forces in the fight against crime. 
  It is necessary to learn lessons and draw conclusions from 
the shortcomings and mistakes in crime policy and lawmaking 
activity. The participants in the parliamentary hearings believe 
that the process of adopting laws suffers from serious drawbacks 
and is not in line with practical requirements. Draft laws are 
often elaborated without the participation of or without 
consideration of the opinion of those departments which will 
have to implement the law, and there is a lack of expert 
criminological appraisal of draft laws. Legislators, the 
Russian Federation president's apparatus, and the Russian 
Federation Government in many instances operate in an 
uncoordinated way and duplicate the same draft laws. Russian 
Federation presidential edicts and Russian Federation Government 
normative acts do not always meet the requirements of 
legislation and the principle of the separation of powers. Many 
obsolete legal norms are still in existence, and issues that are 
very necessary for stepping up the fight against crime in its 
most important areas do not receive legislative solutions. 
  The existing Criminal Code does not envisage criminal law 
measures for a whole number of dangerous activities that have 
become widespread. Legislation has not reinforced 
responsibility for the different types of organized crime, 
terrorism, and the creation of illegal armed formations. 
  The lack of legal norms envisaging responsibility for dummy 
companies, sham bankruptcies, the "laundering" of criminal 
income, and other abuses is creating considerable difficulties 
in countering the black economy. 
  Stepping up the fight against corruption will require the 
speediest legislative resolution of questions of responsibility 
for crimes committed by civil servants and officials at economic 
entities. 
  Law-enforcement and control organs have limited access to 
the 
documents and materials they require. 
  There is no reliable legal protection for victims, 
witnesses, 
and citizens who help the investigation and the courts, or for 
law-enforcement workers against criminal violence and threats. 
  Certain norms relating to the execution of criminal 
legislation do not conform with the provisions of the Russian 
Federation Constitution, international acts on human rights, and 
the tasks and goals of criminal punishment. 
  Prisons are in a very serious condition, particularly in 
material terms. Unless the necessary measures are urgently 
taken these institutions will be unable to fulfill their role at 
all. 
  The Convention on Legal Aid and Legal Relations in Civil, 
Family, and Criminal Cases, which was signed by the CIS heads of 
state, has not been ratified for more than a year. Owing to the 
sluggishness of the Russian Justice and Foreign Ministries, the 
question of elaborating and concluding bilateral treaties on 
these issues with other states has not been resolved. The 
Russian Federation has still not acceded to European conventions 
on reciprocal legal aid, extradition, the "laundering" of 
criminal income, and a number of others. 
  The questions of ensuring legality and public order, of 
preventing lawbreaking, and of protecting citizens' property, 
rights, and freedoms are not properly reflected in the activity 
of the Russian Federation Government and executive organs in 
Russian Federation components. 
  The federal and other executive organs' lack of a 
centralized 
system for collecting and analyzing information on the crime 
situation and the observance of legality prevents a proper 
assessment of the situation from being made and the necessary 
measures from being taken in good time. The help provided to 
organs of local self-government and public associations is 
patently inadequate. The state of legal services at 
enterprises, institutions, and organizations, the auditing 
apparatus, and expert institutions prevents cases of violations 
of the law and abuses from being revealed in good time and often 
negates all the efforts made to expose criminals. 
  Cadre, financial, material, and technical provision for 
law-enforcement and state control organs lags behind practical 
requirements. 
  Social guarantees for workers directly involved in the fight 
against crime are inadequate. Many of them do not have the 
necessary housing and everyday conditions. 
  Unjustified reorganizations and the lack of a careful 
approach to cadres have led to their lacking any confidence in 
the future, and have considerably weakened the operational 
investigation apparatus. A considerable number of skilled 
staffers have left over the past few years. 
  Many militia workers and one in four investigative apparatus 
staffers at internal affairs organs do not have any legal 
education. The situation with cadres in the Prosecutor's Office 
remains serious. Higher and secondary legal educational 
establishments are failing to train enough specialists for 
law-enforcement organs. The neglect of this problem is making 
it harder to create highly professional apparatuses and is 
having a negative impact on activity to strengthen law and order 
and to fight crime. 
  Attempts are being made to reform the Russian Federation 
Prosecutor's Office in the absence of an integrated concept for 
prosecutorial oversight. The desire to politicize Prosecutor's 
Office organs is doing a great deal of damage. 
  The Russian Federation Prosecutor's Office has amassed the 
necessary experience of cooperation and collaboration with all 
branches of state power and other law-enforcement and control 
organs -- consequently, the proposals to make the Prosecutor's 
Office responsible for coordinating the activities of 
law-enforcement organs should be supported. At the same time, 
the attention of the Russian Federation Prosecutor's Office 
should be drawn to its inadequate organizational role in leading 
the organs under its jurisdiction. 
  The fight against crime is being affected by shortcomings in 
the implementation of judicial reform. Certain provisions of 
the concept for judicial reform do not correspond to the 
realities of life. 
  Citizens are justifiably angry about red tape, repeated 
instances of dangerous criminals being released from custody, 
and other serious mistakes in judicial activity. 
  On the basis of Article 82 of the Standing Orders of the 
Federation Council, First Convocation, the participants in the 
parliamentary hearings consider it necessary: 
  to recognize that the crime situation in the Russian 
Federation threatens the main foundations of Russian statehood, 
constitutional legality, and citizens' safety; 
  to speedily adopt a federal program to step up the fight 
against crime in 1994-1995, and to prepare regional programs on 
that basis; 
  to examine as a priority draft laws aimed at protecting 
citizens' constitutional rights against criminal infringement, 
and at opposing organized and violent crime. The priority draft 
laws should be the following: on amendments and additions to 
the RSFSR Criminal Code, the RSFSR Code of Criminal Procedure, 
and the RSFSR Code on Administrative Violations; on the fight 
against organized crime; on the fight against corruption; on the 
protection of witnesses, victims, and other persons assisting 
criminal proceedings; on state protection for judges and workers 
in law-enforcement and control organs; on the military militia 
(police) in the Russian Federation Armed Forces; and on the 
holding in custody of people suspected of and charged with 
crimes; 
  to take measures to step up the role of executive organs 
and officials in crime prevention, the creation of effective 
mechanisms for monitoring their implementation of Russian 
Federation presidential edicts and their own decisions, and the 
strengthening of legal and auditing services and expert 
institutions; to set up at federal and regional level a system 
for coordinating the fight against crime, and to define within 
it the role and functions of executive organs in Russian 
Federation components and organs of local self-government; 
  to examine the financing of crime-fighting programs as 
priority issues when drawing up and ratifying the federal 
budget, the budgets of Russian Federation components, and local 
budgets; 
  to draw the attention of the leaders of law-enforcement and 
control organs to existing serious shortcomings in the fight 
against crime -- particularly in curtailing organized, armed 
crime and corruption, to the state of economic security and the 
protection of the consumer market, and to the activity of 
institutions from the criminal-law implementation system; to the 
need to improve the demands made on subordinate subunits in 
safeguarding citizens' constitutional rights and freedoms, and 
to adopt emergency measures to enhance the effective functioning 
of the entire law-enforcement system. 
  The participants in the parliamentary hearings call on the 
mass media and their editorial colleagues and journalists to 
comprehensively and objectively cover the problems of the fight 
against crime, to actively reveal the causes of negative 
phenomena, to promote the formation in the population of respect 
for the law, and to enhance the prestige of staffers at 
law-enforcement organs.

    [Editorial Report] Kiev Radio Ukraine World Service in 
Ukrainian at 1300 GMT on 20 April carries a 10-minute recorded 
report on an interview with Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk 
by an unidentified correspondent in Kiev's Kharkovskiy District 
on 19 April. 
  The correspondent asks Kravchuk about a meeting held by the 
Sevastopol Town Council, which requested that the Ukrainian 
president withdraw Ukraine's Armed Forces from the town. 
  Kravchuk replies: "I do not think this is a confrontation or 
a turning point. I think there will be various points of view 
and various positions until the problem of the Black Sea Fleet 
is resolved. We must be calm about this and approach it with 
understanding. The main thing, however, is to solve the problem. 
  ``I will tell you frankly that I do not see the possibility 
that the Ukrainian Armed Forces can exist alongside the Russian 
naval base that could be in Sevastopol on the basis of a leasing 
agreement that is recognized by the world. I support this idea 
because I see no other way out at the moment. There will never 
be accord there if they are together or next to each other. 
  ``For this reason, if the base is to be in Sevastopol--I 
stress not the town of Sevastopol, because there are various 
interpretations here--I am not talking about the town, but about 
the base in the town of Sevastopol. It is a question of 
interpretation, but it is necessary to be precise. Some people 
do not observe this, and there are misunderstandings because of 
this. In this case, there should be a base for the Ukrainian 
Armed Forces. Moreover, the base for the Russian fleet will not 
be leased in perpetuity but for a specified period that will be 
determined by documents. 
  ``There is no need to dramatize or imagine that one thing 
has 
been agreed and now they are talking about something else. 
Everybody puts forward his point of view. Until a final 
document is signed, along with all its attributes and 
mechanisms, there will be various interpretations. Do not 
exaggerate the various bits of information, statements, or 
decisions--even by the Sevastopol Town Council-- because for us 
this is of a consultative nature. I would not like to prejudice 
the course of events. I know that a Russian-Ukrainian commission 
has already starting working on this, but I would like them to 
complete their work successfully. 
  ``We must resolve the problem of the Black Sea Fleet. We are 
obliged to do so. Please understand that this is not simply a 
question of dividing the fleet. It is a political issue. It is 
considered to be a joint fleet at the moment. In reality, 
however--without wanting to dramatize it--it is not subordinate 
to Ukraine. This joint fleet takes some actions as a joint 
fleet, and we--both Ukraine and Russia--are responsible for 
these actions. For example, I am not allowed to intervene 
directly, but I am responsible if it is a joint fleet and I sign 
a document. For this reason, I consider that we must clearly 
determine as soon as possible that this is a Russian fleet with 
Russian laws, regulations, and enforceable enactments. Russia 
would be responsible for its fleet and Ukraine for its fleet. 
  ``It is necessary to resolve this, and this is the most 
important thing. We must sit behind a table and resolve it. I 
insist, insisted, and will insist on this. It is dangerous to 
drag it out.'' 
  The correspondent says that the Ukrainian Supreme Council 
will have to ratify the agreement, and Kravchuk adds: "This is 
not a tragedy. The main thing is that the presidents sign the 
documents and then submit them to parliament. An important step 
will have been taken. The presidents and governments make 
proposals and then submit them to parliament. Parliament 
expresses its view. I am convinced that the Ukrainian 
parliament understands the situation. There are realities that, 
despite all desires, cannot be ignored. They exist today and 
should be resolved. There is no other way but to resolve this 
on the basis of wise and constructive principles, with 
compromises, and in the interests of today, tomorrow, and the 
distant future. 
  ``If it is a serious policy, then that is how we should act. 
I know how sensitive this issue is, how you react to it, and 
how every statement and comment is interpreted differently. 
There is one principle, however, which is to resolve and settle 
the issue of the Black Sea Fleet: the issue of a base for the 
Russian fleet, the division of the fleet, and compensation to 
Ukraine for our share of the fleet that is being given away to 
Russia. 
  "These are the main issues. We have already discussed them 
in detail in Yalta, Zavidovo, and Massandra. We have already 
worked on this. We only have to sit down and write down the 
precise formulation on the principles and interests of our 
states, taking into account international experience. That is 
all we are talking about. 
  ``Ukraine clearly abides by the provisions that are defined 
in three documents--and now in the fourth one signed in Moscow. 
Thus, there are four documents on the Black Sea Fleet. I would 
like the fifth one to be the last.''

  [Text] Sevastopol 20 April TASS -- Russian Defence Minister 
Pavel Grachev arrived in Sevastopol on Wednesday for talks with 
Ukrainian officials on the fate of the Black Sea Fleet. 
  According to an agreement signed in Moscow on 15 April, 
naval 
bases of the Black Sea Fleet of Russia and Ukraine must be 
separated. The naval base of one of the fleets should be in 
Sevastopol. "This is what will be at issue at the upcoming 
talks," Grachev said upon arrival at Sevastopol airport. 
  The Russian minister expressed hope for the success of the 
talks, saying that he positively assessed proposals suggesting 
that the entire Black Sea Fleet should belong to Russia. 
According to Grachev, the fate of the Black Sea Fleet depends 
on politicians and they have had their say on the matter. Now 
the matter rests with the military," Grachev said. 
  Grachev does not expect that during the talks a final 
resolution on the Black Sea Fleet will be adopted. 
Nevertheless, he pointed out that "he would be satisfied if key 
principles and approaches to this problem are coordinated." "We 
came to Ukraine in a bid to reach a fair solution of the Black 
Sea Fleet problem," the Russian defence minister said. Upon 
arrival in Sevastopol Grachev met commanders of the Black Sea 
Fleet. Afterwards, he will meet the city administration. On 
Thursday, Grachev will begin talks with the Ukrainian delegation 
led by Ukrainian Defence Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy. 
  Grachev is accompanied by a plenipotentiary representative 
of 
the Russian president to the talks, Yuriy Dubinin, who told 
journalists at the airport that the main task of the talks is to 
reach the realisation of agreements reached in Moscow. 
According to Dubinin, all previous agreements on the solution 
of the Black Sea Fleet problem were not realised since lower 
structures "refused to comply with the president's will."

  [Text] Sevastopol 21 April TASS -- Russian Defence Minister 
General Pavel Grachev, who came to Sevastopol as head of a 
Russian delegation to hold talks on the division of the Black 
Sea Fleet, has had a meeting with officers of the Black Sea 
Fleet. He stressed in his report that Russia intended to 
further maintain the Black Sea Fleet in a proper condition as 
one of the most efficient armed units for the defence of its 
southers borders. We shall do our utmost for turning Sevastopol 
into the main base of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, Grachev said. 
  The Russian defence minister confered on the officers, who 
showed especially good performance, the military ranks, that 
were due to them, earlier than planned before. These included 
the commander of the Cheleken, the hydrographic vessel that 
transported hydrographic equipment from Odessa. 
  Grachev had to cool the temper of some angry officers at the 
meeting. For instance, Colonel Lobov from the Air Force of the 
Black Sea Fleet said that pilots intended to leave no planes to 
the Ukrainian side, to take off without permission and fly to 
Russia.

  [Text] Talks between Russian and Ukrainian military 
delegations on a stage-by-stage settlement of Black Sea Fleet 
problems begin in Sevastopol today. 
  Pavel Grachev, the head of the Russian delegation and 
Russian 
defense minister, said the Russian military delegation would not 
grant any favors or concessions going beyond the framework of 
the agreement and also the Massandra protocol and other 
documents concerning the fleet. 
  Pavel Grachev stressed the Russian delegation would approach 
the destiny of the Black Sea Fleet in a constructive and 
equitable manner. According to INTERFAX, the defense minister's 
view is that Russia has enough strength and resources to 
purchase the whole of the Black Sea Fleet altogether.

  [Text] Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev, who is in 
Sevastopol for talks on dividing up the Black Sea Fleet, has had 
a meeting with personnel of the fleet. He said at the meeting 
that the Russian delegation will insist on separate bases for 
the Russian Black Sea Fleet and the Ukrainian Navy, and that the 
Russian Navy's base will remain in Sevastopol. The Russian 
minister called on the Black Sea sailors not to give in to 
provocations, but to show restraint and calm. 
  Our correspondent Yuriy Novikov reports that this afternoon 
there will be talks between the Russian and Ukrainian 
delegations on the fate of the Black Sea Fleet. It has been 
learned that the Ukrainian sidle is ready to hand over to Russia 
only some of the moorings and bases of the fleet in Sevastopol. 
The Russian delegation does not agree with this proposal and 
will insist on Russia being handed over all the fleet's bases in 
Sevastopol.

  [Text] [Announcer] Today, Estonian Defense Minister Indrek 
Kannik arrived in Ukraine on an official visit. After a meeting 
with his Ukrainian counterpart, Army General Vitaliy Radetskyy, 
a news conference was held for the mass media representatives. 
We invite you to listen to the speech by Ukraine's Defense 
Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy. 
  [Begin Radetskyy recording] We have an opportunity to 
welcome 
Estonian Defense Minister Indrek Kannik on the land of Ukraine. 
This visit is a symbol of developing friendly relations between 
our countries. The signing in 1992 of the Treaty on Friendship 
and Cooperation between our countries became the first official 
step in this direction. However, in my opinion, our peoples' 
good feelings toward each other extend far beyond the limits of 
official documents. It may not be out of place to recall that 
Ukraine and the Republic of Estonia recognized each other's 
independence and sovereignty as far back as 1921. The fact that 
this independence was later crossed out mercilessly was not our 
predecessors' guilt, but their bad luck. 
  Today, we must remember this to prevent numerous tragedies 
of 
the past from happening again, and, unfortunately, there are too 
many of these in the historical memory of our people. It is 
with this very aim that both Estonia and Ukraine strive to join 
the family of European nations as fully-fledged members, and 
show concern for the consolidation of security and stability on 
our continent. Already now, after the first exchange of 
opinions with the minister, I can make a conclusion that our 
views of the future architecture of European security coincide 
in their majority. 
  In particular, we see great prospects in the implementation 
of NATO's Partnership for Peace program. This is a real chance 
to establish genuinely partnership relations with the countries 
of the West and East, and prevent the return to the times of 
military-political confrontation. We do not see any substantial 
reasons for which any country, if it is guided by good will, can 
be denied access to this program which does not contradict the 
national legislation of the countries-participants, respects 
their sovereignty and territorial integrity. It is exactly on 
these grounds that we are trying to solve the painful for 
Ukraine issue of the future of the Black Sea Fleet. Already, we 
have firm intentions in the near future to come to an 
understanding with Russia as far as this complicated issue is 
concerned. 
  Ukraine has always been against the deployment of foreign 
troops on the territories of other states without their clearly 
expressed consent. Our stand on this issue is clear regarding 
both purely domestic problems facing Ukraine and international 
precedents. This is exactly why we show understanding of 
Estonia's stand concerning the withdrawal of the Russian troops 
from their national territory. In my opinion, the current year 
must become a decisive year in solving this problem. 
  I am deeply convinced that the development of 
good-neighborly 
and sincere relations between countries of Eastern and Central 
Europe, within the context of the all-European processes, allows 
the future to be viewed with optimism. The deepening of the 
Ukrainian-Estonian dialogue is part of this future. 
  With Mr. Kannik we signed an agreement on military 
cooperation. This is an important and far-reaching document. It 
lays down a basis for military-scientific cooperation, mutual 
interaction in the military education sphere, retraining of 
troops, social protection of servicemen, and other issues. We 
felt the desire of the Estonian side to build these relations on 
the principles of mutual respect, equality, and mutual benefit. 
  I hope that during the meetings with government officials 
and 
with Ukrainian Defense Ministry officials our Estonian partners 
will have an opportunity to concrete these principles 
essentially. I am convinced that the development of bilateral 
contacts between the military departments of Ukraine and Estonia 
is useful for our states and peoples. [end recording] 
  [Announcer] You have been listening to a speech by Ukraine's 
Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy at a news conference held 
jointly with Estonian Defense Minister Indrek Kannik, whose 
official visit to our state got under way today.

  [Text] Kiev [no date as received] -- During the official 
visit by Estonian Defense Minister Indrek Kannik to Kiev on 20 
April, the heads of the military departments of Ukraine and 
Estonia signed an agreement on military cooperation between the 
defense ministries of the two countries. At a joint news 
conference by the defense ministers that took place on the same 
day, it was emphasized that Estonia and Ukraine have common 
views--in particular, as far as international security is 
concerned. According to Army General Vitaliy Radetskyy, 
Ukraine's defense minister, a special commission will be set up 
to work out the possibility of handing conventional armaments, 
subject to reduction, to the Estonian side under barter 
conditions. In Kannik's opinion, the granting of special status 
to Russia in the "Partnership for Peace" program--if it joins 
the program--is out of the question. Tallinn and Moscow cannot 
find a common approach on settling the issue of withdrawing 
Russian troops from the Estonian territory. 
  Radetskyy told journalists that he maintains regular ties 
with Russian Federation Defense Minister Pavel Grachev and 
intends to begin negotiations with him on 21 April in Sevastopol 
concerning the final solution of the Black Sea Fleet issue, 
negotiations that will last until 23 April approximately. The 
head of the Ukrainian military department pointed out that 
Ukraine would propose that Russia take the main base of the 
Russian Black Sea Fleet--which Sevastopol would probably remain 
as--for a term of five years. "However, such a proposal will 
need to be ratified by the Ukrainian parliament after it is 
coordinated with the Russian side," said Radetskyy. 
  Radetskyy also informed journalists that social issues will 
be a priority at the Black Sea Fleet negotiations. "On 20 April, 
Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk reaffirmed the fact that the 
economic security of Ukrainian naval sailors and those officers 
and warrant officers who would like to transfer from the Black 
Sea Fleet to the Naval Forces of Ukraine would be the same," the 
Ukrainian defense minister assured.

  [Text] Ukraine and Iran have reached preliminary 
understanding on the mechanism of implementing the 1992 
agreement on oil and gas shipments to Ukraine. Under the 
agreement, Iran was supposed to annually deliver 10 to 12 Bn 
cubic meters of gas and 5 Mn tonnes of oil. 
  However, according to the Ukrainian embassy in Tehran, the 
agreement actually did not come into force because the question 
of building a gas pipeline from Iran to Ukraine remained open. 
The Ukrainian side is unable to supply the pipes and other 
building materials. Besides, the pipeline was to cross Russian 
territory and no agreement was reached on the project with 
Russia. 
  At talks in Tehran on Monday the Ukrainian Foreign Minister 
Anatoliy Zlenko and the Iranian Oil and Gas Minister Gholam Reza 
Agazadeh reached preliminary agreement on increasing Iranian gas 
supplies along the existing gas pipeline to Azerbaijan by 3 Bn 
cubic meters. Turkmenistan should accordingly reduce gas 
supplies to Azerbaijan and increase deliveries to Ukraine. 
  According to the Ukrainian Embassy, the pattern of gas 
deliveries has been discussed with Azerbaijan. Meanwhile, talks 
with Turkmenistan on the matter have not been held. 
  Last February Turkmenistan stopped direct gas deliveries to 
Ukraine when the Ukrainian debt rose to $700 Mn. 
  The talks in Tehran reportedly focused on the possibility of 
Iranian oil supplies in exchange for Ukrainian farm goods. 
  As the Ukrainian facilities technologically are unable to 
refine Iranian oil, deliveries will evidently follow the same 
pattern as in the case of gas -- using a third country. 
  The patterns of delivery will be finalized during sessions 
of 
a mixed commission for trade and economic cooperation. 
  An agreement between the two countries might be signed 
during 
the visit to Ukraine by the Iranian President Hashemi-Rafsanjani 
planned for this year.

<F P=106> [Report by Natalya Kalashnikova: "Ukraine-Iran Talks. All </F>
Oil Roads Lead to Moscow"] 
  [Text] The results of a mission to Tehran by Ukraine 
Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko that ended yesterday have 
disappointed both sides. The contracts on deliveries of Iranian 
oil to Kiev are recognized as dead and buried. Ukraine could 
not after all get "black gold" either by the oil pipeline 
running across Azerbaijan or by tankers across the Black Sea 
because the Turkish side would not let them pass through the 
Bosporus. 
  Oil contacts with Tehran that saw the light of day as a 
result of Kiev's seeking economic independence from Moscow 
called for the supply of 5 million tonnes of "black gold" as 
early as 1992, and another 4 million in 1993. There were plans 
under which the "Iranian oil for Ukrainian metal" barter scheme 
was supposed to have reached the $7 billion level. There was 
also talk of a really pipe-dream project, of a direct oil and 
gas pipeline from Iran to Ukraine. But it was perhaps not 
fated. Mr. Zlenko has characterized the situation with failed 
deliveries as a stalemate. 
  Now there is a new deal in the offing. Iran intends to buy 
from Kiev military hardware manufactured in Ukraine, in 
particular Antonov-type military transport planes and spares for 
them. Since there are no diplomatic constraints for such 
bilateral relations, this understanding appears rather realistic. 
  A bilateral commission to coordinate economic cooperation 
was 
formed. As for political ties, Tehran has so far offered to 
Kiev mediation in freeing Ukrainian POW's in Afghanistan (there 
are nearly 80 of them).

  [Text] Kiev, [no date as received] -- Ukraine's Foreign 
Ministry told a UNIAN correspondent that Ukrainian Foreign 
Minister Anatoliy Zlenko will pay an official visit to the 
Socialist Republic of Vietnam on 21 April. The head of 
Ukraine's foreign policy department will meet Vietnamese Prime 
Minister Vo Van Kiet, National Assembly Chairman Nong Duc Manh, 
and Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam. A joint statement or 
foreign ministers' declaration is expected to be signed which 
will set out the basic principles of relations between Ukraine 
and Vietnam and outline prospects for their development. 
  They will also discuss preparations for the signing of a 
treaty between Ukraine and Vietnam on the principles of 
relations and cooperation, and a number of economic agreements, 
in particular on avoiding double taxation, on protecting and 
assisting investments in power engineering, and on legal 
assistance and employment. Anatoliy Zlenko will discuss with 
Vietnamese government representatives the forthcoming visit to 
Ukraine by Vietnam Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet. 
  According to additional information from Ukraine's Foreign 
Ministry, the Socialist Republic of Vietnam recognized Ukraine's 
independence on 27 December 1991. Diplomatic relations were 
established between the two states in January 1992. Agreements 
have been signed between Ukraine and Vietnam on air links, terms 
of mutual visa free travel by citizens, commercial navigation, 
cooperation in [word indistinct], and electrical communications, 
and a protocol on consultations between the foreign ministries 
of the two countries.

he met India's President Shankar Dayal Sharma. The sides, in 
particular, expressed their satisfaction with the fact that 
relations between the two countries are developing actively on 
the principles of traditional friendly relations and mutual

  [Text] At the request of journalists, Deputy Ukrainian 
Foreign Minister Borys Tarasyuk commented on the article: 
Probable Plans of Improbable Enemy, published in KOMSOMOLSKAYA 
PRAVDA on 19 April. The article deals with the allegedly worked 
out plans of landing Ukrainian troops in Kuban and the Don 
[river]. Other so-called instances of the production of various 
kinds of weapons here [in Ukraine] are provided in the article. 
  Tarasyuk referred to this article as an outright provocative 
lie by the Moscow-based newspaper. According to him, this 
refers, in particular, to information about the production of 
tactical missiles at PivdenMash [southern machine-building plant 
in Dnepropetrovsk] and work on manufacturing binary, chemical, 
and bacteriological weapons allegedly under way here in Ukraine. 
  The deputy foreign minister reminded in this connection that 
our state is a signatory of the convention banning the above 
weapons and it strictly abides by its provisions. In Tarasyuk's 
opinion, such publications prove that KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA 
probably takes an active part in fanning up anti-Ukrainian 
sentiments in Russian society and tries to undermine the process 
of normalizing relations between the two neighboring states.

  [Text] My slogan in the presidential election campaign 
will be: Social accord and unity of all the people residing on 
Belarusian territory. This was said by Genadz Karpenka, 
candidate for the post of the first Belarusian president, at a 
news conference held on 19 April. Among the primary problems 
Karpenka singled out that will have to be resolved if he were to 
be elected were housing construction, the transformation of 
plants and factories into joint-stock enterprises, and the 
development of economic ties with all the CIS states including 
our close neighbors. For the first time ever, the candidate 
presented his viewpoint on the agricultural sector. He spoke 
skeptically about the treaty on unification of the monetary 
systems of Belarus and Russia. In his opinion, the current 
quite difficult situation should be resolved by economic 
measures, rather than by joining the ruble zone. Karpenka added 
that the main task is to make plants work, while money is only a 
by-product.

  [Text] Details that were not put on paper but resulted from 
the agreement on unification of monetary systems signed in 
Moscow became the subject of Belarusian Finance Minister 
Stsyapan Yanchuk's interview with BELINFORM and the State 
Committee for Radio and Television. 
  During the interview, which was held on the evening of 19 
April at the House of Government, the minister stressed a number 
of points, which no one has addressed aloud. He said that 
despite the declared procedures for exchanging legal Belarusian 
tender for Russian rubles, the revaluation of key assets of 
enterprises will be conducted by all means. A correcting ratio 
will be utilized. The Republic should independently look for a 
source to settle the difference between the value of the 
Belarusian and Russian ruble for the exchange of money held in 
the savings accounts of Belarusian citizens. In addition, both 
in Russia and Belarus, a black market exchange rate for the U.S. 
dollar is used, therefore, when setting an exchange rate of 
Belarusian hares for Russian rubles, the black market exchange 
rate must be taken into consideration. 
  The finance minister also answered a variety of other 
questions.

  [Text] The ecological problems of disarmament will be 
discussed at a planned seminar at Narach lake under the auspices 
of the Belarusian Defense Ministry, the State Committee for 
Ecology, and the Belarusian Academy of Sciences. 
  An area of more than 4.5 million hectares has been vacated 
after the withdrawal of certain units of the Russian Strategic 
Missile Forces. Use of this land, however, has been complicated 
by the fact that increased radiation has been observed at 
numerous sites. For example, in Marina Horka -- one of the 
Russian units' bases -- the level of radiation exceeds the norm 
by 10 times. There have been reports that radioactive emitters, 
which were used for didactical purposes, were stored here. The 
lack of controls and natural aging of the emitters have led to 
the increased radiation levels. At Rechytsa, a radioactive 
waste dump which has been handed over to the Belarusian Interior 
Ministry, radiation is detectable within 200 meters of the 
perimeter. Since the dumping ground is located in an 
unprotected forest area, the local citizens -- unaware of any 
danger -- are taking advantage of nature's bounty there.

<F P=106> [Article by K. Kabayev: "This Is Not a Conservatory for </F>
You. Everyone Is Monitored Here: Chekists in Kyrgyzia 
[Kyrgyzstan] Have Started an Apparatus War"] 
  [Text] Bishkek -- "Hello, is this the hospital? No? Then 
excuse me..." 
  What does this mean? If you are not a statesman, not an 
important businessman, or, finally, not a "hard-boiled" 
journalist, the error can be written off to lousy telephone 
communications. But, if you fall into the aforementioned 
category of people, then you should think twice. 
  A special cable stretches from each of the 16 operating 
telephone stations in Bishkek to the department with three, now 
four, initials -- GKNB [State Committee for National Security]. 
The KGB has its own people on each shift at the 16 stations. 
With some degree of exaggeration, the Ministry of 
Communications can be safely called a daughter of the KGB firm. 
  A note with a request to monitor one or another subscriber 
(addressed to the chairman of the KGB) is submitted by the 
manager of one of the two leading directorates of the office. 
After an appropriate endorsement, the paper is returned to the 
executor. Further, it is a matter of equipment. A ring can be 
heard at the necessary ATC [automated telephone station]: 
  "Masha (Aigul, Sveta, Larisa...), hook us up with this 
number." 
  Soon a small light shows up on a panel in a special KGB room 
-- "the subscriber is on the line!" In order to determine 
whether the "object" is in place in the apartment of the person 
who is "under surveillance," the buzzer rings: "Hello, is this 
the hospital (hotel, bathhouse, kindergarten, etc.)?" The 
trustful master of the house replies indignantly that, no, this, 
he says, is an apartment... As a rule, it is here that the 
recorder is turned on with each incoming and outgoing telephone 
call. By the way, the click in the telephone receiver that is 
described in detective stories cannot be heard. The GB's [state 
security] apparatus is well balanced. Sometimes conversations 
are listened to directly. But in both cases in the apartment (or 
the office), a noticeable deterioration in sound quality occurs. 
Approval to monitor a telephone is granted for a period of not 
more than one month; however, this does not mean that the 
approval cannot be extended. According to the testimony of 
reliable persons, up to 20 subscribers are monitored in Bishkek 
each day. 
  However, the situation in an apartment (or office) can also 
be monitored without lifting the telephone receiver. In this 
case, the telephone apparatus itself acts as a microphone. 
Therefore, knowledgeable people either disconnect the apparatus 
from the system or turn on a source of additional sound (two is 
better, in different corners of the room) -- a radio, a 
television set. The author of these lines frequently had 
occasion to be witness to this during conversations with highly 
placed Kyrgyz officials. 
  Notes containing approval for monitoring are supposed to be 
kept in a special archive. However, if a note is "lost" for any 
reason, the loss may not even be noticed. Thus, it has become 
known that in December of 1980, after the murder of Chairman of 
the Council of Ministers Sultan Ibraimov, several notes of 
approval and deciphering of telephone conversations of suspected 
persons disappeared. 
  With the victory of democracy in Kyrgyzia, discussions about 
telephone monitoring have not diminished. Complaints and 
suspicions are coming both from governmental figures and also 
from journalists and politicians. 
  There are a lot of examples. When leaving for home Felix 
Kulov, former vice president of the state, sealed the door of 
his official office and, while talking with someone, 
disconnected the telephone apparatus from the system. Topchubek 
Turgunaliyev, head of the Erk Party, suspecting the "office" of 
monitoring his telephone, officially appealed to the head of the 
KGB-GKNB. 
  Alas, the essence of the department did not change with the 
change of signboard. Just as in the epoch of totalitarianism, 
the department continues to engage in political investigation, 
and it actively intervenes in the affairs of the state and the 
personal life of its citizens. 
  After the downfall of communism in the Baltics and Eastern 
Europe, the state security organs were the masters of the 
political Olympus for three or four years. With their assist, 
parliamentarians divided each other into "clean" and "dirty." 
The chiefs of committees removed objectionable figures from the 
political arena without particular problems. Undoubtedly, given 
all its antiespionage (read antistate security) orientation, 
this prolonged action was managed and coordinated by departments 
that "were being criticized." It is sufficient to mention that 
after the accusations of "cooperation with the KGB," Kazimiera 
Prunskiene was forced to resign as prime minister of Lithuania. 
But who else could have arranged the compromise of the prime 
minister except the KGB? No one! The axiom says: "Divulgence 
of agent information is a matter for the hands of the department 
that put such agent network together." The intelligence 
services of Czechoslovakia were able to isolate Aleksandr 
Dubcek, who recently died in an automobile accident under 
questionable circumstances. The state security people of Poland 
were not satisfied with Lech Walesa, who there and then was 
accused of cooperation with the organs. Moreover, rather 
convincing documents were leaked to the press. 
  Kyrgyzia, apparently, is also no exception. In the opinion 
of a number of former employees of the Kyrgyz KGB, the firm in 
one way or another controls up to half of the state employees 
and members of parliament. Some of them were and are secret 
agents, others were seen in the organs at one time carrying out 
delicate instructions of the KGB, and still others were driven 
at one time "to do the devil's work" by writing a denunciation 
against a neighbor, and the paper providently settled in the 
"office." Today (as they believe), the publication of three to 
five names that are well known in the Republic (with a specific 
demonstration of their agent activity) is capable of causing a 
profound governmental and parliamentary crisis. 
  Getting ahead of the story, it should be noted that with 
this, apparently, these state security people have captured 
parliamentarians who are scared to death. At the last session 
of the Kyrgyz parliament the people's representatives 
unanimously passed a law concerning the organs of state security. 
  According to this law, the Chekists acquired the right of 
unimpeded entry into dwellings "and other premises belonging to 
citizens" (a reason will always be found!), and the procurator 
has to be notified of this only after 24 hours. Now state 
security people can quite informally intervene in the activity 
of commercial structures, "demand and receive from them 
necessary information, check the presence of property with 
registered and current data, and receive information in banks on 
operations, accounts, and deposits." Where is the guarantee that 
the commercial information will not be turned over (sold) to 
competitors afterwards? Where is the guarantee that the 
Chekists (and today they are graduates of Kyrgyz higher 
educational institutions who have merely gone through a Bishkek 
system of personnel selection) will not ruin the firms and 
organizations they are checking up on? After all, the law does 
not say a word about the measure of responsibility of the 
employees of the GKNB in the event of causing moral, physical, 
or economic damage. 
  The state security people have retained control over 
governmental special communications, they have retained for 
themselves the investigative isolation cells that just a year 
ago were filled with then "foreign money speculators," though as 
it turns out today--with legal financial brokers. Now the 
Chekists, suspecting someone (and, as is known, anyone and 
everyone can be suspected), can quite informally check the 
contents of your pockets and go through your car and personal 
things. Moreover, without the approval of a procurator. 
  Incidentally, Kyrgyz Chekists now enjoy the use of all types 
of public transport (except taxis) free of charge. 
  And more: The services of state security informers will be 
paid from the republic budget. 
  Thus, in the most democratic Central Asian republic, the 
parliamentarians not only did not restrict the activity of its 
monster, but, on the contrary, placed it above all society, 
having legalized the penetration of all spheres of Kyrgyz state, 
public, and economic life. 
  Only the president has the last word. After all, whether the 
law on state security organs passed by the deputies will be 
confirmed depends only on him. But the president is keeping 
silent... for the time being.

  [Text] "The outcome of the inter-Tajik talks held in 
Moscow can be qualified as "completely satisfactory." The main 
thing is that a dialogue began, and that it proceeded 
constructively enough. It's also indicative that the launch of 
the negotiating mechanism led to lowering the intensity of 
violations on the border between Tajikistan and Afghanistan," 
the Director of the 3d Asian Department of Russia's Foreign 
Ministry, Yuriy Kotov, told INTERFAX on Wednesday. 
  According to him, "nothing great" was expected from the 
talks 
in Moscow. "We did not expect the two sides to reach 
comprehensive agreements at once. It's gratifying enough that 
they worked out an extensive agenda, adopted a statement on the 
need to refrain from any actions conducive to complicating the 
process of talks, agreed to form a commission on refugees, and 
coordinated a joint communique," the diplomat said.

  [Text] Leader of the Tajik opposition Akbar Turadjonzoda 
has stressed the need to create in Tajikistan a provisional 
government from among those who did not take part in the 
"internecine war." He was speaking in an INTERFAX interview 
after the first round of inter-Tajik talks ended in Moscow. 
  The opposition does not seek power, the people should take a 
decision concerning who should rule on the basis of multi-party 
elections, said Turadjonzoda. 
  "We stand for close ties with Russia, we understand and 
recognize its interests in Central Asian. No one can replace 
Russia as partner of Tajikistan, and Tajikistan cannot exist 
without Russia, he believes. 
  The opposition leader said that during two-week talks in 
Moscow the two sides only elaborated the agenda and signed the 
communique on refugees which envisages their registration and UN 
aid. The next round of talks will be held in Islamabad 
(Pakistan) or Tehran (Iran). Turadjonzoda said that UN 
representatives proposed to start talks on 23-25 May. This, 
however, does not suit the opposition because this coincides 
with Moslem holidays. The talks will obviously begin later, he 
said. 
  He said that difficulties on solving the problem of refugees 
are caused by the fact that Dushanbe is unable to provide full 
guarantees for them. Practically 50 per cent of Tajik families 
have suffered to some degree at the hands of the Dushanbe 
regime, he said. People do not want to return and live under 
this regime, said Turadjonzoda. 
  He said that it is necessary to adopt a Tajik Constitution. 
Not now, as Dushanbe would like, but after the refugees return, 
he said. A civil war is going on in Tajikistan, a state of 
emergency imposed and political parties banned. It is 
impossible to hold elections and referendums under such 
conditions. This is humiliating for democracy, he said.

  [Text] Dushanbe 20 April TASS -- The Tajik opposition is 
preparing new provocations on the Tajik-Afghan border to 
destabilise the situation in the region and foil the second 
round of inter-Tajik talks due to take place either in Tehran or 
Islamabad, competent sources in Dushanbe told ITAR-TASS. 
  The sources said that Tajik opposition forces based in the 
Afghan provinces of Kunduz and Takhar are planning a series of 
attacks on Russian border outposts and Tajik border villages. 
There is also information indicating their intention to mine 
one of the sections of the Tajik-Afghan border patrolled by the 
Pyanj border troop unit. Mobile terrorist groups have been 
concentrated near the Imam Sahib Province, and weapons and 
military machinery are being brought in. 
  The sources claimed they had proof that the go-ahead to 
proceed with acts of terrorism was given by the government in 
exile led by Tajik national Sa'id Abdullo Nuri. The acts will 
be carried out by field commanders from the so-called 
Kumsangir-Pyanj resistance front. 
  The sources said all these activities are taking place in 
the 
districts controlled by the Afghan military whose leaders have 
repeatedly confirmed their readiness to help stabilise the 
situation on the Tajik-Afghan border and prevent provocations.

  [Text] Ashkhabad [Ashgabat] 21 April ITAR-TASS -- Chinese 
Premier Li Peng today continues his official visit to 
Turkmenistan. 
  On the eve of his arrival, the local press published a 
series 
of statements on relations between Turkmenistan and China by 
President Saparmurad Niyazov. Niyazov described these relations 
as having great perspectives. 
  "China is a great country, and its role in the Asian-Pacific 
region and the entire world is considerable," Turkmenistan's 
president said. 
  "We have no intention of copying somebody's model 
uncritically," Turkmenistan's leader said. "Along with this we 
are studying carefully and interestedly China's economic reform 
experience." 
  The head of the Chinese Government is on a 12-day tour of 
the 
Central Asian countries, including Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, 
Kazakhstan and Mongolia. These visits were planned in spring of 
last year but had to be postponed because of the premier's 
unexpected illness.

  [Text] Ashkhabad [Ashgabat], 21 Apr -- Turkmen-Chinese 
summit talks started in Ashkhabad today. Turkmen President 
Saparmurad Niyazov and Li Peng, premier of the PRC State 
Council, have started discussing specific issues relating to the 
development of economic cooperation. 
  Journalists were allowed to be present only for the first 
few 
minutes of the meeting. However, these first few minutes did 
reveal that the meeting was exclusively about business. An 
understanding has virtually been reached on the purchase of 
Turkmen cotton by China. 
  Alongside the official talks, discussion is under way of 
draft intergovernmental agreements. These center on matters 
relating to projects for sending Turkmen gas to China and a 
number of other commercial and economic cooperation issues.

regions who met with President Boris Yeltsin to sum up the 
results of local elections adopted the following statement in 
Moscow on Wednesday. 
  "We, representatives of Russian regions, support the idea of 
signing the memorandum on civil peace and accord in Russia. 
  "We are confident that the implementation of the tasks set 
by 
this memorandum -- to ensure political stability, exclude any 
forms of extremism from the arsenal of methods used in political 
practice, set up lasting mechanisms of accord, establish a new 
political culture, overcome the estrangement between the society 
and power and, consequently, create favourable social atmosphere 
for successful continuation of reforms -- meet the inspirations 
of the overwhelming majority of people of Russia. 
  "We call on all Russian regions, political parties, 
movements 
and public organisations to leave behind their disagreements and 
join the memorandum on civil peace and accord in Russia in the 
name of peace and prosperity of our motherland." 
  The text of the statement was released by the presidential

  [Text] Moscow April 21 TASS -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin has begun a meeting with the heads of the republics 
which are component parts of the Russian Federation. Opening 
the meeting, he said, "The system of meetings with the republic 
heads is being renewed". 
  According to the president, such meetings with republic 
leaders should be held approximately "five to seven times a 
year". He noted that Thursday's meeting is the first since the 
adoption of a new constitution and the elections to the Federal 
Assembly. 
  "Much has changed in the country in the past few months, 
political stabilisation is gaining strength, the disastrous 
state of dual-power has been overcome", Boris Yeltsin pointed 
out. He also informed the local heads about his work with the 
chairmen of the Federation Council and State Duma, saying that 
there "have been no disagreements so far". 
  On the topic of the recent local elections in Russia, the 
president noted that "the elections were valid in 61 federal 
regions. In only 17 was voter turnout too low". He expressed 
the hope that all the local elections would be held by the end 
of the current year.

<F P=106> [Remarks by Vyacheslav Kostikov, press secretary for </F>
President Boris Yeltsin, "this morning" in Moscow -- recorded] 
  [Text] Yesterday in the evening one of the last versions, 
if not the very last, of the text was drawn up to be submitted 
to the State Duma. Today this document will be handed over to 
the president and to the State Duma, where it will be discussed. 
I would like to inform you that this document will now be 
called A Treaty on Public Accord [Dogovor ob Obshchestvennom 
Soglasii]. This is a truly agreed upon text. It takes into 
account comments made by factions, parties, and public 
organizations, including the comments of Communists and the 
Liberal Democratic Party. The text has become more specific 
and, if you like, milder in its political part. During the 
process of consultations several provisions, which can be used 
for confrontation purposes, were removed from it. In particular, 
paragraphs on sanctions against those who violate the conditions 
of the accords were removed. 
  As you know, a week is left before signing. Today I spoke to 
Boris Nikolayevich on this topic and asked him how much he hopes 
for success. He said that he is optimistic. He hopes for 
success and believes in it. The president understands that not 
everyone will sign this document, but the main political forces 
and groups will sign it. In our view, the necessary mass of 
political will toward an accord will be created -- not just 
created, but registered as well.

  [Text] Moscow, 20 Apr -- "The political situation in Russia 
has begun to stabilize," Russian President Boris Yeltsin stated, 
opening a meeting with heads of administrations of Russia's 
krays and oblasts today. 
  Boris Yeltsin said that there has been real collaboration 
with the Federation Council and the State Duma. "I have 
frequent meetings with Vladimir Shumeyko and Ivan Rybkin, we 
discuss issues of concern to Russia, and we reach agreement in a 
calm atmosphere. This style of work has a positive effect on the 
general political improvement in the country," the president 
said. 
  Boris Yeltsin confirmed that the signing of the Agreement on 
Civic Peace and Accord will take place on 28 April in St. 
George's Hall of the Grand Kremlin Palace. About 140 
organizations are expected to take part in the ceremony. The 
president called for the agreement to be signed by all branches 
of power, political parties, and public organizations. He 
believes that representatives of the power structures of the 
krays, oblasts, and Russian Federation republics should also 
sign the document. 
  Of those political forces who have so far opposed signing 
the 
agreement, Boris Yeltsin said: "We will not insist on them 
signing this document." Russians, he added "will see for 
themselves what the words of such leaders and their programs 
mean in practice." The head of state noted that, so far, only 
the Communists have stated their opposition to signing the 
agreement, but "perhaps, this only applies to a section of their 
leadership," the president remarked. 
  "We want this document to be a major political step, like in 
Spain, where a similar memorandum was also signed," he said. A 
special coordinating commission should monitor implementation of 
the agreement, the president believes. 
  I think, said Boris Yeltsin, that the accords on military 
issues initialled in March 1994 create a legal and diplomatic 
framework for completing the withdrawal of Russian troops from 
the territory of Latvia, and for resolving questions relating to 
this matter in a civilized manner. "They became possible as a 
result of sensible compromises and responsible attitudes, and 
they correspond to the real long-term interests not only of the 
peoples of our countries but of the entire region, of Europe as 
a whole." I hope "to have a meeting with Guntis Ulmanis in the 
near future where a package of the initialled agreements will be 
signed, which will become a turning-point in the relations 
between our two countries," Russian president said.

  [Text] Moscow April 20 TASS -- Having on the whole 
supported the draft civic concord agreement, the Democratic 
Russia Movement and the Socialist Workers Party have at the same 
time addressed to the presidential administration several 
complaints against this document, expected to be signed on April 
28. 
  In its statement, the Democratic Russia Movement calls for 
the deletion from the draft agreement of the thesis banning the 
use of assessments of the events of August 1991 and of 
September-October 1993 "as a pretext for deepening the 
confrontation". The movement's coordination council regards 
this thesis as "unacceptable". This view is shared by Valeriya 
Novodvorskaya, leader of the Russian Democratic Union. 
Interviewed by ITAR-TASS, the eminent human rights defender 
said: "How will the democrats be able to look into the eyes of 
the people, whom they had urged to man the barricades, if such a 
dubious ban is adopted?". 
  The supporters of Democratic Russia want some declarative 
commitments to be deleted from the text of the agreement and a 
clearer delimitation of responsibilities for the fulfilment of 
the memorandum terms. 
  Chairman of the Socialist Workers Party Lyudmila Vartazarova 
moves to delete from the draft agreement paragraphs duplicating 
the Russian Constitution or contradicting it in the part 
relating to the observance of human rights. Moreover, 
Vartazarova warns against "the discreditation of the very idea 
of national concord by rash and unconsidered actions". She 
suggests a procedure for the document's broad public discussion.

  [Text] The point stipulating that "the sides shall call for 
avoiding assessments of the events which occurred in August 1991 
and October 1993 as a pretext for deepening confrontation" must 
be left out of the agreement on civic accord in Russia because 
it is unacceptable, according to a statement of the coordinating 
council of Democratic Russia published in Moscow Wednesday. 
  The council supported Boris Yeltsin's initiative to develop 
an agreement between the major political forces and his declared 
course towards social consensus. At the same time, Democratic 
Russia listed a number of conditions which, in its opinion, must 
be met while developing and signing the agreement. 
  According to Democratic Russia, the Russian government can 
be 
allowed to sign the agreement only if it fulfills all its 
promises to pay salaries to state workers such as servicemen, 
medical and culture workers and policemen. Democratic Russia 
believes that persons and political forces whose actions 
violated Russian laws, who triggered and deliberately organized 
mass disorders, fanned ethnic differences and called for war and 
violence must not be allowed to sign the agreement. 
  The agreement must impose a responsibility before society 
upon everyone who signs it, Democratic Russia maintained. The 
movement's political council believes that the agreement should 
clearly outline the obligations of all sides, including the 
president, the government, the Federal Assembly, political 
parties, trade unions and other social organizations.

  [Text] Moscow April 20 TASS -- Russian Communists are still 
hesitating about signing Boris Yeltsin's memorandum on Civil 
Peace and Accord. The ceremony is scheduled for April 28. 
Gennadiy Zyuganov, the leader of the Russian Communist Party 
representing the moderate branch of the movement, said on 
Wednesday that the final decision on whether to sign the 
memorandum will be taken at a party national conference on April 
23-24. 
  However, speaking at a news conference today, Zyuganov 
expressed doubts that any true accord could be reached if 
signing to a document is limited by one fixed day. "If we take 
(civil) truce and accord seriously, I stand for a gradual 
approach towards such a variant which, instead of ideology, 
would rather focus on the national and state interests and take 
into account Russia's traditions, contain a mechanism of 
stabilizing the situation", the communist leader said. Zyuganov 
reiterated his support of the idea that "a government of 
national confidence should come to power by democratic means" in 
Russia.

  [Text] Moscow, 20 Apr -- The National Salvation Front (NSF) 
intends to hold a session of the NSF Council this Sunday [24 
April]. It is to elect the NSF leadership and discuss the 
organization's immediate tasks. The ITAR-TASS correspondent 
learned this today from Ilya Konstantinov, chairman of the NSF 
Executive Committee. 
  The activities of the organization were suspended following 
the events of 3-4 October 1993, while Konstantinov himself was 
arrested. He was released from jail following the amnesty 
resolution passed by the State Duma. 
  Asked by the ITAR-TASS correspondent to give his assessment 
of the Accord for Russia movement, which is being set up with 
the help of Aleksandr Rutskoy, Konstantinov said it was too 
early to do this. At this stage the NSF is distancing itself 
from the movement. 
  Gennadiy Zyuganov, leader of the Russian Federation 
Communist 
Party, who once actively participated in the activities of the 
NSF and is now one of the initiators of the creation of the 
Accord for Russia movement, told the ITAR-TASS correspondent 
that he was still advocating the strengthening of the patriotic 
movement and the unification of all national-patriotic forces. 
In his view, this unification is impeded on the one hand, by 
the policy of the authorities and on the other, by increasing 
radicalism among nationalist patriots, both left- and right-wing.

  [Text] Konstantin Borovoy, chairman of the Economic 
Freedom Party [EFP], has advised that the EFP's attitude to the 
Agreement on Civil Peace will be discussed at the party's 
political council on 28 April. In his view, the signing of the 
agreement would signify a conservation of the status quo, 
whereas "putting today's situation, with all its negative sides 
considered, on ice is a renunciation of the democratic process

seeks accord in society; however, in his words, the EFP "cannot 
give up supporting citizens' interests," that is, waging 
struggle.

  [Text] "The agreement on civic peace in Russia will be 
prepared but it will change nothing in the political situation 
in the country." This is the view of 71.5 percent of 
respondents who participated in the opinion poll conducted by 
the independent service Vox Populi headed by Professor Boris 
Grushin, member of the Presidential council, in late March - 
early April. As many as 400 public figures, deputies of the 
State Duma, leaders of executive power bodies, leaders of 
political parties, prominent entrepreneurs, military commanders, 
media representatives, and scientific and cultural workers 
participated in the poll. 
  According to 15 percent of the opinion poll's participants, 
"the agreement will be prepared and will reach its goal," 6.5 
percent said the "the agreement will not be prepared at all." 
Military commanders and media leaders, 88 percent and 80 
percent respectively, are especially pessimistic with respect to 
peace and accord. There were more optimists among the executive 
leaders (34 percent) and directors of state enterprises (18 
percent).

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Igor Belsky] </F>
  [Text] Moscow April 20 TASS--The Moscow branch of the 
Democratic Russia Movement welcomed plans to create a liberal 
conservative party, likely to be called "Russia's Choice", and 
announced readiness to help organize it. 
  A resolution to this effect was passed at the report-back 
election conference of Democratic Russia's Moscow branch. The 
initiative to set up a new party was moved by the Russia's 
Choice parliamentary faction led by key reformer Yegor Gaydar. 
  According to most speakers at the conference, the new party 
is to promote "consolidation of democratic forces". Ilya 
Zaslavskiy, a Democratic Russia leader, said "the powerful, 
disciplined political association of reformers" would 
counterbalance opposition forces presently gathering strength. 
The planned organization based on dual membership "is by no 
means counterpoised to the Democratic Russia Movement", 
Zaslavskiy emphasised. 
  However, some of the Democratic Russia leaders do not share 
this view, for example Lev Ponomaryov, Dmitriy Katayev and Gleb 
Yakunin. According to Yakunin, "creation of the party will bury 
the Moscow branch of Democratic Russia" by turning it into a 
mere appendage to the political organization headed by Gaydar.

<F P=106> [Viktor Movchan report: "Power Party's Debut"] </F>
  [Text] The founding congress of Russia's Power Party 
[Derzhavnaya Partiya] was held in the settlement of Lesnoy 
Gorodok, Moscow Oblast, 17 April. The congress adopted the 
party's rules and program and elected the party's central 
organs. Stanislav Terekhov was elected the party's chairman. 
Participating in the work of the congress were the party's 
founders: representatives of the Officers Union, the analytical 
group for the history of the development of people's 
state-patriotic forces, public organizations of working people, 
industrialists, Cossacks, and parties and movements of a 
state-patriotic orientation from 15 regions of the country. 
  The new party's chief aim is to build a new society, 
progress, social justice, universal well-being, lofty 
spirituality, friendship of the peoples, and a unified Russian 
State. 
  The backbone of the party is made up of representatives of 
the Officers Union, which has outgrown the purely officers' 
movement and become a sociopolitical center and a force with a 
clearly expressed state-patriotic orientation -- which was 
threatening to erode this movement by admitting as members 
people who are not officers. On the other hand, the juridical 
status of a public movement was substantially restricting its 
participation in the political life of society. Precisely these 
reasons served as the basis for adopting the decision on the 
need to create a party which would unite people from different 
sections of society on the basis of the idea of serving the 
fatherland.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Court Throws Out A. Rutskoy's Suit </F>
Against IZVESTIYA"] 
  [Text] The capital's Tverskoy Intermunicipal People's 
Court has considered the latest defamation suit brought by 
former Vice President A. Rutskoy against IZVESTIYA. 
  This time it was Aleksey Chelnokov's article "Young Nazi 
Drinks Toast and Reads `Mein Kampf'" (IZVESTIYA, 15 January 
1994) that was selected as the cause of the suit -- specifically 
the following fragment: "By his `presidential' edict Rutskoy 
made a Russian National Unity subunit equivalent to a military 
organization. The Barkashov people gained the right to bear 
arms -- within the Khasbulatov citadel, of course." The 
plaintiff was seeking 100 million rubles [R] for this "dishonor" 
and the moral damage done to him. 
  He himself preferred not to attend the hearing, predicting 
which questions he would have to answer. In particular, the 
respondents were interested in whether he seriously considered 
himself Russian president and, correspondingly, commander in 
chief, during those tragic days, and whether he deliberately 
violated the Russian Federation laws "On Weapons," "On Defense," 
"On the Military Draft and Military Service," and "On the Status 
of Servicemen" in randomly issuing weapons to people with very 
dubious political beliefs and by no means irreproachable moral 
qualities. By failing to appear, A. Rutskoy also avoided having 
to answer the question of whether he had invited Barkashov's 
followers to provide his own security -- which A. Barkashov 
himself recently revealed in an interview with SOVETSKAYA 
ROSSIYA. 
  The respondent A. Chelnokov submitted photographs to the 
court clearly recording the Barkashov followers with their 
assault rifles and stylized swastikas on their sleeves. This 
could not have happened without the clearly expressed consent of 
A. Rutskoy. The court was also presented with his "edicts": on 
his own accession as acting president, on the appointment of the 
"defense minister," and so forth. The very fact that these 
so-called documents were published meant that their author 
assumed full responsibility for the possible consequences of the 
uncontrolled distribution of weapons -- consequences which were 
soon to be felt.... Consequently, talk of some kind of 
defamation, much less of R100-million damages is just more 
blasphemy. 
  Carefully weighing all the circumstances and the case file 
considered during the hearing, Judge Olga Sergeyeva threw out A. 
Rutskoy's suit.

<F P=106> [Report by Olga Koroleva: "Rutskoy Has Not Left Politics"] </F>
  [Text] Former Russian Vice President Aleksandr Rutskoy, 
released from Lefortovo prison in late February, is still 
avoiding public statements and meetings with journalists. 
Nonetheless, he recently delivered a speech at a closed session 
of the Free Russia People's Party [FRPP], of which he is the 
chairman. He introduced a number of comments and suggestions to 
the drafts of the party's policy statement and statute, which 
are to be adopted at the second FRPP congress in late May this 
year: 
  "We must determine more precisely our party's aims and ways 
of achieving them in order to attract as many supporters as 
possible to our side -- for victory at the forthcoming 
presidential and parliamentary elections. Our party must be 
mass-based. Achieving this will be hard but feasible: After 
all, in all corners of Russia there are people in sympathy with 
us...." 
  A. Rutskoy announced that he is now working on the books 
Collapse of Power [Krusheniye derzhavy] and 
Acquiring Faith [Obreteniye very] which he began 
writing in his cell in Lefortovo prison. In the next few months 
the book Collapse of Power will be completed.

  [Text] The Moskva-Sortirovochnaya workers' depots 
dedicated their action last Sunday to the 75th anniversary of 
the first communist subbotnik. Together with members of Working 
Russia, they cleaned up the area around the monument to the 
participants in the first communist subbotnik. Working Perovo 
has decided to sponsor this rayon. 
  Several hundred people also went to the monument to Karl 
Marx 
that day. During the operation to clean up the adjoining public 
garden an enormous number of used disposable syringes were 
discovered among the mountains of garbage which the "democratic" 
authorities are too busy to remove. Addressing a rally, Working 
Russia leader Viktor Anpilov said that the time has come to 
clear not just the city of garbage but society of the filth 
which we have acquired from the capitalization foisted on us by 
Yeltsin's reforms. While there I managed to snatch a brief 
impromptu interview from Anpilov on the actions which Working 
Russia intends to carry out in the near future. Here is what he 
said: 
  "Active preparations for the May Day demonstration are 
underway in all Russia's cities. The assemblies of residents of 
Tyumen, Ishim, and Voronezh and the congress of working people 
of Moscow and the greater Moscow region have sent telegrams to 
Prime Minister Chernomyrdin demanding that the May Day 
demonstration by Moscow's working people on the 1 May state 
holiday be held without interference. The appropriate 
notification has been sent to the Moscow authorities by the 
Russian Communist Workers Party, the Union of Communist 
Parties-CPSU, and the Union of Communists.... At 1000 hours on 
23 April Working Russia will hold a congress at the Reutovo 
Palace of Culture in which delegations from communist and 
workers parties from Brazil, Greece, the United States, Syria, 
Turkey, and Finland will be taking part. Incidentally, we are 
inviting Soviet and foreign journalists and accreditation will 
take place one hour before the congress opens."

  [Text] Premier V. Chernomyrdin signed Directive No. 451-R 
31 March. 
  Under this document the Russian Union of Industrialists and 
Entrepreneurs, headed by A. Volskiy, is allocated 1.2 billion 
rubles from the government's reserve fund. And in the first 
quarter of the year, which has already ended! 
  The aim is a fine one -- to ensure that enterprises with 
competitive technologies have enough funds to take part in 
Washington's "Technology From Russia" exhibition, which will run 
from 4 through 15 May. But why is this being done secretly, 
without coordination with the legislators? Why are the 
candidates to take part in the exhibition being selected not by 
the state but by a social organization? It seems a state, 
legally ratified program for support for highly developed 
production facilities ought to be adopted to define the specific 
recipients of budgetary aid. 
  It remains unclear just how controls will ensure that 
taxpayers' funds are spent strictly as they should be. And why 
is aid going without any competition to one out of hundreds of 
industrialists' social organizations, rather than to the 
Federation of Commodity Producers, say? All this runs directly 
counter both to the principles of a healthy market and to the 
idea of strengthening a rule-of-law state.

  [Text] As we reported, the Russian Association of Trade 
Union Organizations for Students in Higher Educational 
Establishments [RATUOS] staged a picket of the White House 12 
April in order to draw the government's attention once more to 
the plight of the student population. 
  Government staff received representatives of the association 
and a constructive conversation took place between them -- the 
students were promised that the unpaid stipend owed them will be 
paid and measures will be taken to prevent such a thing 
happening in the future. Apart from this, the student leaders 
agreed to meet with Vice Premier Yuriy Yarov. After this the 
student pickets were withdrawn. 
  But representatives of political organizations which use any 
opportunity for self-advertisement remained in the area by the 
White House. After the picket was over, they organized 
themselves into a column and set off for Novyy Arbat, where they 
clashed with the militia. 
  The RATUOS press and information center put out a statement 
from the chairman of its governing body, O. Denisov, expressing 
regret about the participation of several students in the 
unauthorized march but placing most of the blame for what 
happened on representatives of extremist organizations which 
used the students' nonpolitical event for their own purposes.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Ivanova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow April 20 TASS -- Efforts to seize full 
control over the mass media are becoming increasingly marked, 
according to Aleksey Simonov, head of the Foundation for 
Protecting Openness. He told a news conference on Wednesday 
that these efforts included the intention of the Russian 
Committee for the Press "to take all publishing facilities into 
one fist", as well as too wider powers to be given to the 
Federal Broadcasting Service under a law which is being drafted 
at the moment. 
  A bill on state support of the "fourth power" by granting it 
tax preferences has stumbled in parliament. For this reason, 
the press will have to live on state subsidies this and next 
year. 
  The situation over broadcasting media is even more strained, 
since they have been continually threatened with strikes of 
communications workers. Simonov expressed puzzle as to why the 
state cannot "free" the TV and radio companies it cannot 
maintain. He also complained about disunity of journalists' 
actions in solving these issues. 
  The Foundation for Protecting Openness, numbering only five 
staffers, was founded three years ago. It is engaged in 
monitoring violations of journalists' rights throughout the 
Commonwealth of independent States. The foundation also set up 
a mass media law school and participated in actions aimed at 
release of newsmen illegally jailed in zones of inter-ethnic 
conflicts.

  [Text] Around 100,000 people leave Russia every year. 
Russian Federation Labor Minister Gennadiy Melikyan reported 
this to an RIA correspondent. He said that the level of 
emigration has doubled as compared with 1989. From what the 
minister said, thousands of skilled workers, specialists, and 
representatives of creative professions are leaving the country, 
which may have a negative effect on its intellectual and labor 
potential. "The `brain drain' process from fundamental science, 
the defense complex, and sectors which have found themselves in 
the most difficult situation in the period of the restructuring 
of the economy, is generating particularly great alarm." 
  At the same time, the minister noted that the influx of 
refugees into Russia, which has assumed a "steady and constant 
nature," is growing.

Two power units of the Kola nuclear power station have already 
been shut down. The nuclear power station accounts for 60 
percent of the electricity generated in the region. Engineers 
will have to shut down yet another power unit of the nuclear 
power station in June. The situation in the region may have an 
effect at an all-Russian level, too, because a failure to 
restart all the power units of Kola nuclear power station, which 
supplies power to the Northern Fleet's rear bases and garrisons, 
will adversely affect the fleet's combat readiness.

  [Text] There are adverse environment conditions over as 
much as 20 percent of Russian territory, Environment Minister 
Danilov-Danilyan said in Moscow on Wednesday. He said his 
ministry demanded a special resolution to prevent Russia from 
further dumping of liquid nuclear waste into the Sea of Japan. 
  He said the Ministry for Foreign Economic Relations was not 
entitled to issue licences for imports of nuclear waste from 
other countries until after the go-ahead from environmental 
experts. However, the minister said that much too often, nuclear 
waste was imported into Russia under the guise of materials 
intended for reprocessing as evidenced by a recent incident in 
Orenburg. 
  The minister denied media accusations that Prime Minister 
Viktor Chernomyrdin signed a deal on imports of liquid nuclear 
waste from Hungary for reprocessing in Russia. He blamed Atomic 
Energy Minister Viktor Mikhaylov for signing this deal instead. 
The minister said the agreement did not go through an ecological 
safety study and "is therefore illegal." 
  Danilov-Danilyan called for a review of all previous 
international agreements on nuclear waste disposal in Russia to 
be followed by parliamentary ratification.

  [Text] The international Russian-Japanese-[South] Korean 
expedition aboard the scientific research vessel Okean recently 
conducted a survey of regions for the storage in the Sea of 
Japan of the Pacific Fleet's liquid radioactive waste. 
Measurements of the concentration of radioactive matter in 
seawater, sediments on the ocean's bottom, and vegetation and 
animal life showed that everything was within the norms of 
natural background [radiation]. This confirmed again that the 
recent dumping of waste carried out in October 1993 posed no 
danger.

  [Text] The administration of Primorsky Territory has 
accused commanders of the Pacific Fleet and management of a 
local factory of failing to comply with safety standards for 
storing nuclear waste. Its statement says that more than 2,000 
cubic meters of liquid nuclear waste was kept in fleet and 
factory-owned tankers moored in the Bolshoi Kamen bay, most of 
them unfit for durable storage. 
  As a result, radiation levels in the region have risen, 
according to findings by an interdepartmental commission of 
inquiry. The commission said radiation levels had doubled in 
the engine department of a TNT-5 tanker which was written off 
two years ago and were several times in excess of background 
radiation in the bay itself. 
  The regional authorities have given the fleet command and 
factory management until April 25 to comply with safety 
standards for nuclear waste storage. Earlier, the commission had 
agreed to the dumping of a load of liquid nuclear waste held in 
the TNT-5 tanker into the Sea of Japan.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Yurkin] </F>
  [Text] Moscow April 20 TASS -- Ratification by Russia of 
the Convention on Chemical Disarmament is designed to stabilize 
the situation in the entire world, said Lieutenant-General 
Anatoliy Kuntsevich, a full member of the Russian Academy of 
Sciences. He opened here on Wednesday the second international 
conference on chemical disarmament, "Moskon' 94", with a 
presentation on problems of elimination of chemical warfare 
agents. 
  Kuntsevich said Russia now possesses the world's biggest 
stock of toxic agents. According to official data, it has 
accumulated on its territory over 40,000 tons of products by the 
military chemical complex, which is enough to poison every 
living being on the globe. 
  The issue of recycling chemical warfare agents is out of the 
scope of Russia's interests. Participants in the conference 
noted that introduction of imperfect technologies might create 
hotbeds of ecological tension not only on the cites of war gases 
elimination but also in other regions. Experience gained in 
this sphere by other countries, in particular by the United 
States, cannot be copied in Russia. Developments by Russian 
researchers are opposed by foreign experts just out of 
considerations of competition. Some Western theoreticians and 
industrialists insist that lewisite be incinerated, while 
Russian specialists suggest extracting highly- pure arsenic out 
of this hazard chemical agent. 
  Russian supplies of this valuable material used in making 
solar energy plants designed to replace atomic stations in the 
next century will somewhat squeeze Western arsenic producers on 
the world market. Thus, purely scientific problems raised by 
participants in the forum are acquiring a very different meaning. 
  Professor Vladlen Malyshev, adviser to the head of the 
Committee for Conventional Problems of Chemical and Biological 
Weapons under the Russian president, told TASS that "Moskon' 94" 
had drawn chemical researchers from many countries. In 
coordination with their colleagues from the Russian Academy of 
Sciences and producers, they are seeking for ways of safest 
destruction of Russia's huge stock-piles of toxic agents. In 
doing this, the adviser said, we should first of all take into 
account humane ecological problems and national interests. 
  "At the same time, researchers and specialists of the 
military chemical complex understand quite well that 
ratification by Russia of the convention on chemical disarmament 
will stabilize the situation across the world, but this truth 
should also become an axiom for politicians, lawmakers and the 
public at large," Malyshev stressed.

  [Text] Moscow, 21 Apr (ITAR-TASS) -- Russia's revival is 
impossible without the revival of the army. This is what 
Vladimir Shumeyko, chairman of the Federation Council, thinks. 
However, as he stressed today in a conversation with the 
ITAR-TASS correspondent, there can be no question of 
strengthening the army while we are indulging in populist 
gestures and exempting hundreds of thousands of young people 
from army service. 
  Vladimir Shumeyko visited the Taman motorized rifle division 
today. He acquainted himself with the problems of the guards' 
formation, and talked to the servicemen. 
  In keeping with the legislation which is in effect, some 200 
restrictions exist which, according to the speaker of 
parliament's upper chamber, do not allow the army to be manned 
with a sufficiently large contingent of conscripts. "Of 1.5 
million young men, we need to call up at least 700,000, and not 
200,000 which is the current figure. We cannot go on putting up 
with this situation," Vladimir Shumeyko thinks. He noted that a 
"military package" of laws will soon be analyzed in the 
Federation Council in order to introduce changes relating to 
conscription into military service.

  [Text] Moscow, April 21 (TASS) -- Russian nationalist 
leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky fears the youth today cannot 
decently protect the motherland because of poor health 
undermined by during the years of former Soviet President 
Mikhail Gorbachev and called to recruit men of "older age who 
did not suffer from perestroika in childhood". 
  "The youth today are not like they used to be before 
perestroika. Misery, hunger, life in constant fear for future 
(which began for the kids at nine years of age, that is with 
perestroika years) resulted in that drafted to the army now will 
be weak and sick guys who are unable neither to protect the 
motherland nor themselves", the press service of the Liberal 
Democratic Party said on Thursday quoting Zhirinovskiy. "It is 
possible to recruit up to two million volunteers and let 
children study", the statement reads. 
  Speaking at parliamentary hearings on civic accord 
agreement, 
Zhirinovskiy proposed to the Russian president to cancel his 
decree which stripped students of vocational schools who have 
reached 18 years of age of the right to defer military service.

<F P=106> [Zhanna Kasyanenko report under the "Rumors and Official </F>
News" rubric: "Clubs for May Day"] 
  [Text] During the discussion of the State Duma agenda 
yesterday morning, Deputy V. Marychev (Liberal Democratic Party 
of Russia) took the microphone and voiced concern at the power 
structures' vigorous preparation for the May Day holiday. A 
multitude of crimes are committed in the capital every day, God 
knows what kind of "guests" visit it, yet the law enforcement 
organs are not very worried about all this, the deputy noted, 
but as soon as the day commemorating spring and labor draws near 
they begin rehearsing operations using clubs and gas in the 
Luzhniki stadium.... After a brief exchange between the deputy 
and the presidium, it was decided that the May Day preparations 
will be discussed at a session soon. 
  But what in fact were the deputies worried about? 
  It has come to light from several sources that two Taman 
Division regiments -- the 1st and 15th Motorized Rifle Regiments 
-- are getting ready for May Day with armored personnel 
carriers. Blackmail and threats are being employed against 
officers who are not in favor of sending the regiments into the 
city. 
  It is being said that the parachute regiment has been 
transferred from Tula to Khimki. Part of a spetsnaz regiment 
from Bryansk, allegedly formed from hired criminal elements, has 
gone to the Sofrinskaya Brigade for training. A communications 
brigade has been transferred from Sokolniki to another location 
and has been replaced in Sokolniki by a separate battalion of 
airborne assault troops directly subordinate to the defense 
minister. The 901st Personal Ministerial Spetsnaz Battalion has 
been stationed in Kubinka. The regiments of the Pskov, Tula, 
and Ryazan Divisions have been virtually disarmed but each of 
them has one battalion which is being maintained on combat alert 
condition 1. 
  There is information that Moscow Mayor Luzhkov is almost 
personally involved in the formation of MVD [Ministry of 
Internal Affairs] subunits. Former OMON [Special Purpose 
Militia Detachment] members, militia men, and Afghan war 
veterans are being recruited to them. They are being promised 
enormous pay and apartments in Moscow. The Moscow spetsnaz 
subunits are being urgently reformed into rapid reaction 
detachments. State of emergency headquarters are being set up 
under all Rayon Internal Affairs Departments in Moscow. 
  In addition, specific means of influence on people are being 
made ready: These include far from "harmless" types of gas, 
such as "cheremukha" [tear gas], and noise-making devices 
capable of causing panic and rendering a crowd uncontrolable. 
Hired provocateurs are being trained to fire on OMON units 
[dlya ognevogo porazheniya omontsev] during the mass events. 
  I would like the authorities to tell us what all these 
preparations betoken or else deny the facts that I have cited.

<F P=106> [Military desk report: "...And Morale in the Barracks Is </F>
Steadily Growing"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Plus or Minus Half A 
Million 
  Not so long ago in an interview with ARGUMENTY I FAKTY, 
Colonel General Dmitriy Volkogonov, former military adviser to 
the Russian Federation president, said that the numerical 
strength of the Russian Army stood at 1.8 million men. Soon 
afterward Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of the Russian Federation 
Armed Forces General Staff, in an interview with SEGODNYA, 
claimed that there are 2.1 million men in the Russian Army. 
Literally the next day Defense Minister Pavel Grachev stated at 
a press conference in the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense 
that there are 2,341,000 men in the Russian Armed Forces. 
  Such acute discrepancies are today the object of serious 
analysis by many Russian and foreign military experts. In the 
main two conclusions can be drawn from the analytical materials: 
Either Russia's top generals do not know the true state of 
affairs, or they are deliberately bluffing, misleading both the 
"enemy" and the authorities so as to extort as much money as 
possible for military needs. In favor of the latter hypothesis 
is the fact that CIA Director James Woolsey recently told the 
U.S. Congress that, according to data compiled by all branches 
of U.S. intelligence and verified many times over, the numerical 
strength of the Russian Armed Forces as of the beginning of 1994 
stood at 1,554,000 men. 
<H5>  Our Military-Industrial Complex Reaches the Republic of </H5>
South Africa 
  A large group of engineers and designers from the Russian 
military-industrial complex set off 17 April on a TU-204 
aircraft for Johannesberg. The aim of the trip is to 
participate in the international air show "Aviation Africa 
1994." This will be the first time that Russia has been 
represented on such a large scale in the RSA [Republic of South 
Africa]: from major defense enterprises to the Tupolev, 
Beriyev, Mikoyan, and Kamov firms. What, were our weapons in 
short supply only in the RSA? 
  "Let me stress: The exhibition is a purely civilian affair. 
We are not taking any military items to the RSA, especially 
since no one has lifted the corresponding UN embargo," E. 
Neymark, chief of the Russian Federation Committee for the 
Defense Sectors of Industry Aviation Industry Main Directorate 
said. "The only real exhibit that we are presenting is the 
TU-204; the rest are models, artillery boards, and video 
trailers. We hope that our participation in the air show will 
promote Russian aviation technology and know-how on the South 
African market." 
  [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] But aren't you afraid? More than 10 
Russians who went to an air show in Chile recently were robbed 
on the streets, and one was almost shot. 
  [Neymark] You can get shot in Moscow too -- it's no big 
deal. And anyway, two of our people are already there; they 
phoned recently: Everything is quiet, the Germans, Americans, 
and French have confirmed their participation. We will be 
flying back 26 April, the day before the [South African] 
elections. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  Mission in Beijing </H5>
  M. Kolesnikov, chief of the Russian Federation Armed Forces 
General Staff, visited China last week. The aims and results of 
the visit are shrouded in secrecy. However, according to 
certain information, in addition to talks on additional arms 
deliveries, the general tried to dispel Beijing's extreme 
caution over Russia's signing of the NATO "Partnership for 
Peace" program, now in preparation, and also over plans to build 
the "Svobodnyy" Space Center near the Chinese border. Did he 
manage to reassure the Chinese, and if so, at what price? 
<H5>  "Land Reform" in the Ministry of Defense </H5>
  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA has learned that a major furor has 
erupted over the publication in a newspaper of the scandal over 
the "land reform" of Grachev aide General Ivanov. As a result 
of the reform around 100 land plots intended for officials of 
the military department's central apparatus have disappeared 
somewhere. Early on Saturday morning Grachev had a stern talk 
with Ivanov, after which the Ministry of Defense threw all its 
efforts into composing a refutation. There is so far no talk of 
any investigation. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Second Rank Captain A. Bogorubov, chief of </F>
the Baltic Fleet group for the export of obsolete ships, by O. 
Shcheblykin in Kaliningrad, under the "Firsthand" rubric; date 
not given: "Ships Will Wait for a While and Never Set Sail"] 
  [Bogorubov] Our group received its name after the Baltic 
Fleet commander in chief issued an order in February 1993. We 
are engaged only in preparing ships for sale abroad, while 
agreements are signed at the Defense Ministry Central Management 
for Material Resources and Foreign Economic Relations. 
  [Shcheblykin] The Baltic Fleet is in a difficult financial 
situation, and the nonbudget money that it could get from 
selling obsolete ships would be quite useful. 
  [Bogorubov] In general, this is how things really stand. 
However, the fleet has not yet received anything for the cruiser 
"Sverdlov," which was sold to India for $2 million back in 1992. 
All appeals to Moscow have been fruitless.... 
  Between 1992 and 1993, with the permission of the Baltic 
Fleet command, we concluded agreements on the sale of all 
obsolete combat vessels, including those which had sunk, by the 
Tallinn naval base. This was better than losing them all for 
nothing. The money for lifted and scrapped ships used to come 
in the course of work. The work was temporarily discontinued 
because the sea froze near the Estonian coast. After the ice 
melts, work will begin anew and money will start coming in. 
  [Shcheblykin] Aleksandr Nikolayevich, as far as I know, a 
particularly difficult situation has emerged in Liepaja. There 
are a great many sunken vessels there. What will happen to them? 
  [Bogorubov] Ten ships have been sunk in Liepaja, including 
the cruiser "Groznyy," a torpedo boat, and several patrol boats. 
Four border patrol boats have been left in abeyance. 
Subsidiary ships have also been sunk. We managed to find a 
firm that would buy our ships and take care of raising, 
scrapping, and selling them. For example, the Latvian company 
"Siklin" has undertaken to sell the vessels under such terms. 
The fleet would receive 90 percent of the net income. In 
September 1993, we signed an agreement with the Latvian company 
"Spero" on the sale of 12 submarines moored in Riga for $60 per 
tonne. The same firm bought an additional six submarines from 
Liepaja for $85 [per tonne]. The deadline for the contract 
expired on 31 December, while we are back where we started. 
  [Shcheblykin] Why did the deal fail? 
  [Bogorubov] The Latvian businessmen fell victim to the laws 
of their country, adopted after the agreement had been 
concluded. The export duty soared to 300 percent. "Spero" 
representatives began to seek lower prices. While the new 
prices were being coordinated with Moscow, time expired and the 
deal came to a deadlock. 
  [Shcheblykin] Russian troops will leave the Baltic states 
this year. What will be the fate of the property left in Latvia 
and Estonia? 
  [Bogorubov] This issue also requires the signing of an 
agreement on the interstate level. It will be impossible to 
ship all the property before the troops are pulled out. We will 
need at least two more years. A year and a half ago, we 
suggested holding another "Tallinn march" and redeploying all 
the obsolete ships from the Baltics to Russia. However, the 
fleet command did not find it possible to undertake such step at 
that time. We are now examining the possibility to sell the 
ships here. 
  [Shcheblykin] What were the results of your work in 1993? 
What are you planning to accomplish in 1994? 
  [Bogorubov] In 1993, we planned to sell 21 vessels with an 
aggregate displacement of 32,000 tonnes. In 1994, we are going 
to sell 11 more vessels with an aggregate displacement of 16,500 
tonnes. As a result of storms raging in the Baltic Sea, 13 
ships sank at the beginning of 1993. Some contracts were 
wrecked. Yet, we managed to sell 19 vessels with an aggregate 
tonnage of 3,222 tonnes for $100,000. However, we have no 
information confirming that the fleet has received the 
envisioned 60 percent of the sum. 
  We have also signed a contract with a U.S. company that 
wants 
to purchase two large personnel landing craft removed from 
combat duty: one from the Northern Fleet and our "Krasnaya 
Presnya." They were appraised at $1.5 million a piece. The 
Americans never showed up and the deal was also disrupted. There 
are many offers but not all of them are implemented. To some 
extent this is because the Defense Ministry Central Management 
for Material Resources and Foreign Economic Relations, when 
fixing the prices for ships, does not take into account regional 
peculiarities. Today, we are not the only organization in the 
Baltic region trading in obsolete ships. The trawler fleet, the 
merchant fleet, and other organizations are offering ships for 
sale. Civil organizations fix prices that are much lower than 
ours. 
  [Shcheblykin] As we know, prices for scrapped metal are much 
higher than for ships. Is this kind of commerce profitable? 
  [Bogorubov] Of course it would be much more comfortable to 
scrap ships here and then sell the scrap abroad. This would 
increase the price several times. However, just as almost 
anywhere else in Europe, there is no facility for scrapping 
ships here. The scrapping of ships is a very labor-intensive 
and ecologically harmful process. Such a plant used to operate 
in Spain, but it went bankrupt and closed down. 
  A step has been made to create our own scrapping facility in 
Baltiysk. If it started operating, the Baltiysk zone would be 
practically free of sunken, half-sunken, and obsolete ships 
which are still afloat. We would be able to scrap all types of 
ships. The fleet would greatly benefit from this.

<F P=106> [Peter Almond article: "Russia Develops New Fighter </F>
Aircraft With Sting in its Tail"] 
  [Text] Russia is developing a fighter aircraft with the 
unique ability to shoot missiles backwards, according to Jane's 
Defence Weekly. The sting in the tail is in Sukhoi's latest 
ground attack fighter, the Su-34, a development of the Su-27. A 
fighter version of the plane, the SU- 35, which is now being 
developed, is set to become one of the world's most capable 
fighters and is the aircraft the RAF's [Royal Air Force] new 
Eurofighter was designed to beat. Neither Eurofighter nor 
America's still-developing fighter, the F- 22, has a rear firing 
capability. Mr John Taylor, editor of Jane's All the World's 
Aircraft, said last night: "It would probably make life more 
difficult for Eurofighter. It makes it more difficult to 
attack." The missile was stated by the magazine to be a standard 
R- 73 air-to-air infra-red missile, a development of the AA-11 " 
Archer" . According to the Russian missile design bureau 
Vympel, a rear-facing tracking or acquisition radar sensor on a 
long aft "tail" picks up an approaching aircraft and warns the 
two-man crew to prepare to fire. The missile is on a wing rail 
and can be rotated backwards. Mr Taylor said it is then 
released and its rocket motor fires away from the aircraft. The 
radar guides it automatically to the target up to eight I miles 
away. Vympel claims the missile can be fired in supersonic 
flight. 
  Mr Taylor said rear-facing radars have been in place on 
Russian. bombers for some time and the idea of firing a missile 
backwards has been researched by western air forces. 
  The main reason British and American air force officials are 
not worried for their new aircraft is that both are designed to 
fire the medium-range Amraam missile, which can detect the Su-34 
long before entering its radar vision. "A rear-facing missile 
might give problems if you want to get close but Amraam lets us 
fire from 20, miles away or more, long before the other guy 
knows we're even there," said a US air force spokesman at the 
Pentagon.

  [Text] Moscow April 21 TASS -- The Russian Government 
defined as the main goal of its social policy for 1994 
"stabilisation of living standards of Russian people with their 
subsequent improvement as the economy develops". This goal was 
formulated in the social policy guidelines of the Russian 
Government for 1994, a document which was adopted by the 
Presidium of the Russian Government at its meeting on Thursday. 
  The document stresses that "The Russian Government is guided 
by the premise that a fruitful and balanced social policy is a 
necessary condition to continue reforms, to consolidate their 
social basis and to improve the social and political situation 
in the country". 
  The main directions of the social policy for 1994 provide 
for 
creating economic and legal conditions which will stimulate the 
able-bodied part of society to ensure its well-being with highly 
productive labour. They also provide for supporting optimum 
correlation between the incomes of the able-bodied part of 
population and disabled citizens, for ensuring the main social 
guarantees and for preventing mass unemployment. 
  To realise these aims in 1994, the government plans to 
concentrate on preventing a drop in real cash incomes of 
population, ensuring a weighted balance of economic interests 
and material possibilities of hired labour, businessmen and 
disabled citizens as well as reforming the public health and 
public education systems, culture and housing. The government 
will also concentrate on creating new jobs for population and 
stepping up work to retrain labour.

  [Text] Russian President Yeltsin has sent greetings to the 
congress of the Association of Russian Banks, which opened in 
Moscow today. The greetings say: Russia's economy needs an 
effective payments system, more active involvement of commercial 
banks in investment projects, expansion of the banking services 
sector, and an improvement in quality. We believe that these 
issues will be a topic for professional debate at your congress. 
The president wished the congress productive work.

  [Text] Samara April 20 TASS -- There has been considerable 
progress in reforms in Russia lately, according to Russia's 
choice leader Yegor Gaydar. Meeting journalists in Samara, Volga 
region, on Wednesday, Gaydar said "we have already passed the 
most crucial phase of the crisis. However, we have yet to do the 
most important -- assemble mechanisms which could allow the 
economy not only to survive, but also to develop and grow." 
  Gaydar is in Samara to see if his idea of presidential party 
has chances of success in Russian regions. He believes it 
should not be entirely presidential, but must support the 
president so that he could count on it. The new party will be 
seeking to reduce budget expenditures, curb inflation, protect 
the rights of owners and carry out a reasonable tax policy. 
Gaydar confirmed that his party will move from rhetoric to 
action and is ready to bear responsibility for all decisions, 
including unpopular ones. 
  "The present tax rates make economic growth impossible. Cuts 
in budget expenditures are vital for changing the tax policy. 
They should be reduced by means of gradual reforms, primarily 
in the military sphere," Gaydar noted. "We cannot keep the army 
which in its present form is absolutely incapable and absurdly 
expensive," he added. 
  In his view, entrepreneurs, the intelligentsia and farmers 
who were considered "kulaks" in the Soviet past will make up the 
bulk of the new party. It will support itself by levying 
membership fees and receiving donations from commercial 
structures that understand the significance of the new party and 
are ready to invest in politics.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Gennadiy Yezhov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow April 20 TASS -- "Radical changes in the 
Russian economy will take place only alongside the influx of 
private investments, rather than credits from international 
financial organisations," said Russian Vice-Premier Aleksandr 
Shokhin at a meeting with journalists on Wednesday. The news 
conference was devoted to international economic cooperation and 
investments into Russian economy. 
  According to the vice-premier, the International Monetary 
Fund is practically prepared to grant Russia the second part of 
a three- billion "system credit." At a session of the board of 
IMF managers opening in Washington this week preparations will 
be launched for granting a standard credit worth 4 billion 
dollars, Shokhin said. 
  In his opinion, an annual session of EBRD managers held in 
St. Petersburg last week showed a high level of Russia's 
interaction with Western partners. He pointed out that Russia 
would like to attract more private investments for the 
development of the oil and gas sector. The government is 
prepared to accept such investments on privileged terms, he 
said. For instance, the value added tax, which caused great 
concern of foreign and domestic investors, has been practically 
lifted from foreign investments into Russia, Shokhin said. 
  Until recently, Russian enterprises had to pay a lot of 
money 
to the state for equipment it imported from abroad. Now, as 
soon as the equipment is installed, the whole amount of tax 
levied on the equipment will be returned. As for the imports of 
material and monetary means for the formation of the fixed 
stock, they are exempt from taxes altogether, Shokhin said. 
  The government does not forget potential domestic investors, 
the vice-premier said. At present, the government is working 
out a plan of making a bigger number of attractive enterprises 
available for privatisation after a voucher stage is over than 
their original number offered for privatisation. On the other 
hand, stable inflation rates reached by the government will 
inevitably bring about the reduction of bank interest rates, 
which is a major condition for encouraging investments into 
industry, Shokhin said.

  [Text] Viktor Gerashchenko has said that currently 
"options are being contemplated to lift restrictions on the 
activity of foreign banks in Russia imposed by edict in fall 
1993," and he hopes that this decision may apply not only to 
banks that already had licenses to carry out operations in 
Russia by the time the edict was passed. A spokesman for a 
large Western bank has confirmed that during bilateral meetings 
Russian officials also mentioned the possibility of lifting 
restrictions on the activity of foreign banks in Russia in the 
very near future. Informed Russian sources have also reported 
that a bill on the subject may be submitted to the parliament as 
early as the end of April.

<F P=106> [By BUSINESS-TASS correspondent Robert Serebrennikov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow April 20 TASS -- Russia's Central Bank 
developed a working programme to gradually take control over 
operations with hard currency effected by resident and 
non-resident entrepreneurs operating in Russia. 
  According to materials released by the parliamentary 
committee for economic policy, this programme provides for 
working out appropriate standard acts to control first hard 
currency proceeds and then import and barter deals, export and 
import of services, as well as movement of capital. 
  The programme envisages tough sanctions up to non-acceptance 
exaction of funds from the banks guilty of incorrect and 
untimely settlements as concerns the compulsory re-sale to the 
state of part of their hard currency earnings. 
  To make the activities of currency control bodies more 
effective, the Central Bank suggests strengthening the 
legislative basis, specifically taking legal actions against 
those accused of violations in the currency sphere, specifying 
certain provisions of the law on currency regulation and 
control, to pass legislative acts allowing to sign and ratify 
international agreements on currency issues. 
  The programme also proposes building a database of all 
foreign trade shipments and payments on the basis of the Russian 
State Customs Committee's computer centre in order to check 
information on money and goods movement. This will make it 
possible to reveal cases of underestimated export prices and 
overestimated import prices.

<F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Kucherenko: "Central Bank Turns the </F>
Screws"] 
  [Text] The Central Bank of Russia's Moscow department 
reports that in March another three banks acquired currency 
licenses. 
  "Alternativa," "Moskva," and "Baltiya" received so-called 
domestic licenses. That is, the licenses which give the right to 
engage in freely convertible currency operations on Russian 
territory. And "Lantabank" has acquired an expanded license 
which also enables it to establish agent relations with six 
foreign counterparts. 
  Unfortunately, punitive sanctions have had to be applied to 
violators of the procedure. As of 1 April the Central Bank main 
administration for Moscow suspended for a month the right of 
some banks to buy and sell currency using their own funds. They 
include the "Eastern-European Investment Bank," the 
"Credit-Consensus," "Progress-bank," and "Russian joint-stock 
commercial bank." 
  Their sin is to have engaged in buying and selling in 
violation of the limit set by the Moscow administration. And 
now, if these institutions intend to disobey the ban through 1 
May, deals involving them will be deemed invalid and the funds 
they obtain in such operations will go into the state revenue. 
Which accords with article 14 of the Russian law "on currency 
regulation and currency control." But clients of the guilty 
banks may rest assured -- the penalized banks have the right to 
buy and sell dollars and marks on instructions from their 
clients. 
  As we can see, the Central Bank seriously intends to 
introduce order in the currency operations of its subordinates 
-- the commercial banks. But let us not forget that alongside 
them firms are alive and well which are merrily dealing in 
freely convertible currency without any banking licenses, 
without obeying the Central Bank of Russia, and spitting on its 
endeavors. They have not been assigned any of the quotas and 
rules which the Central Bank sets for its own "vassals." The 
Central Bank of Russia cannot take nonexistent permits away from 
them or block their accounts, to which sanction any refractory 
and undisciplined commercial bank is inexorably subject. As we 
were told by Central Bank of Russia spokesman A. Sitnin, all 
that can be done is to send letters to the prosecutor's office 
and the tax service. 
  So far this has produced no results. And the bankers' 
dissatisfaction is therefore inevitable: "Why are we being 
punished and not them?" So that in this delicate sphere, a 
highly explosive one for the economy, no consolidation of 
statehood can yet be seen.

<F P=106> [Russian Federation Government Decree No. 336, signed by </F>
Premier Chernomyrdin and dated 15 April 1994: "On the Procedure 
for Determining in 1994 the Regulated Amount of Expenditure on 
the Remuneration of Workers at Enterprises and Organizations"] 
  [Text] In execution of Paragraph 3 of Russian Federation 
Presidential Edict No. 2270 of 22 December 1993 "On Certain 
Changes to Taxation and the Relationship Between Budgets at 
Different Levels," the Russian Federation Government decrees 
that: 
  1. It shall be laid down that in 1994 the regulated amount 
of expenditure on remuneration at enterprises and organizations 
shall be determined on the basis of the actual average monthly 
pay of workers included in the prime cost of the output, 
operations, or services (but not more than six times the minimum 
monthly wage laid down in the Russian Federation), and on the 
basis of the actual average number of workers employed. And 
this number includes workers who are part of the staff 
(including those doing more than one job), as well as those not 
on the staff (working under subcontract or other civil-law 
contracts). 
  The regulated amount of expenditure on remuneration is being 
increased by the payments laid down by Russian Federation 
legislation (within the set norms), which are determined by: 
rayon regulation of pay; the pay value of collective catering 
provided free to members of seagoing and river vessels, air 
traffic controllers and members of air detachment crews, and 
seagoing members of the fishing fleet; the pay value of official 
clothing and uniforms issued free of charge; expenditure on the 
upkeep of servicemen and both rank-and-file employees and senior 
staff at internal affairs organs envisaged by the Russian 
Federation laws "On the Status of Servicemen" (VEDOMOSTI SYEZDA 
NARODNYKH DEPUTATOV ROSSIYSKOY FEDERATSII I VERKHOVNOGO SOVETA 
ROSSIYSKOY FEDERATSII, No. 6, 1993, page 188) and "On 
Institutions and Organs Implementing Criminal Punishment in the 
Form of Imprisonment" (VEDOMOSTI SYEZDA NARODNYKH DEPUTATOV 
ROSSIYSKOY FEDERATSII I VERKHOVNOGO SOVETA ROSSIYSKOY 
FEDERATSII, No. 33, 1993, page 1316) as regards that portion of 
the pay that has a bearing on prime cost of output, operations, 
and services as part of the labor remuneration fund; payment for 
travel to and from vacation areas for workers at enterprises and 
organizations located in regions of the Far North, equivalent 
areas, and remote parts of the Far East; supplementary payments 
for intinerant work and work involving travel; payments for work 
carried out by duty tour and for field work; payments from the 
federal budget for forming labor remuneration funds at 
enterprises and organizations undergoing conversion; payments to 
mothers (or other relatives who actually look after a child) who 
have been hired by enterprises and organizations irrespective of 
their form of ownership and who are enjoying child-care leave in 
accordance with Russian Federation legislation until the child 
attains the age of three. 
  2. It shall be laid down that the procedure for determining 
the regulated amount of expenditure on workers' remuneration 
stipulated in this decree shall cover all enterprises and 
organizations irrespective of the results of their activity or 
the existence of concessions on taxable profits (including 
exemption from profits tax), including enterprises wholly owned 
by foreign investors.

  [Text] Before the end of the year, Russia is likely to have 
a law on oil and gas and another three or four legislative acts 
designed to attract foreign investments into the country's oil 
and gas industry, said Deputy Energy Minister Anatoliy Shatalov. 
  He told the Oil and Gas '94 international conference in 
Moscow on Wednesday that, in addition, Russia is shortly due to 
join the European Energy Charter Treaty, which would provide 
more favorable conditions for foreign investors. He said Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin's December decree entitling Russian and 
foreign businesses investing in the exploration and development 
of mineral deposits to part of the minerals extracted from them 
made it possible to embark on major oil and gas projects. 
  One of such projects is Sakhalin 1, Shatalov said. He said 
the Russian Economics and Environmental Protection Ministries 
would soon consider the project and that a contract on it would 
be signed before the end of the year. Another project is soon 
due to be launched, Sakhalin 2, to be handled by the MMMSM 
international consortium, Shatalov said. 
  Output-sharing agreements will also be signed with foreign 
firms which are to work deposits in the Timan-Pechora oil and 
gas province encompassing parts of northwestern Russia's Komi 
Republic and Arkhangelsk Region. 
  Apart from that, Russia's Energy Ministry and the 
administrations of the country's Volgograd and Saratov Regions 
by May 20 are due to finish talks with the French company Elf 
Aquitane on developing oil and gas deposits in the two regions.

  [Text] Speaking today at the pariamentary hearings on the 
country's foreign economic activities, Viktor Melnikov, head of 
the Main Directorate for Currency Regulations of the Russian 
Central Bank, quoted some interesting figures. According to 
Melnikov, at present Russian citizens have on their hands 
between 10 and 15 million U.S. dollars in cash, the purchasing 
power of which exceeds that of the total cash in rubles 
currently in circulation. Melnikov said that some of the 
reasons for such wealth of the Russians are illegal currency 
operations, tax evasion, and ever-increasing quantities of 
counterfeit dollars in circulation.

<F P=106> [Yelena Berezneva article: "A Glimpse at the Situation: </F>
Diary of an Underwater Seed Drill"] 
  [Text] Whichever way you look at it, credits were well 
timed for those inundated by flood waters. Literally just a few 
days ago, financial support reached Volgograd and Saratov 
Oblasts. But given that a floating seed drill has yet to be 
invented, agricultural workers in these oblasts got the chance 
both to purchase seeds and also to bring in fuel before going 
out into the fields. Not that you would envy the Volgograders: 
Around 600 square kilometers of territory have been flooded, 
and 65,000 hectares of agricultural land are under water. 
According to preliminary data, flood damage in the oblast will 
come to over 19 billion rubles [R]. If due account is taken of 
the fact that the flood is only expected to peak after 25 April, 
the sowing campaign there will be seriously delayed, which in 
itself will affect the harvest. 
  As at 15 April in Saratov Oblast, over 100 centers of 
population, dozens of bridges, many kilometers of road and power 
transmission lines, and thousands of hectares of agricultural 
land were flooded. Something in the region of R15 billion will 
be required to make good what has been affected by the flooding. 
  Perhaps only in the Kuban did the sowing campaign begin on 
time. Krasnodar Kray's farmers waited expectantly for the 
financial support promised by the state, but it reached them 
when the winter crops had already been undersown and resown, and 
when sunflower seeds were already in the furrow -- in short, the 
hard graft was already virtually completed. Had it not been for 
the kray administration's declaring a state of emergency, ruling 
that agricultural enterprises be sent resources and materials 
essential to the sowing campaign without payment up front, it is 
unlikely that the grain growers would have gone out into the 
field. 
  In Stavropol Kray, spring was roughly two weeks late 
arriving. Unlike previous years, its start according to the 
calendar was marked with snow and cold rains. Eventually, the 
weather relented, but Stavropol Kray's peasants went out into 
the field without any real enthusiasm, like their neighbors, and 
without waiting for the arrival of credits and other monies owed 
to them by the state for grain supplied last year. And as there 
were no funds, they had not prepared properly for the hardest 
period of work in the entire year: Machinery was overhauled 
less thoroughly than last year, crops were treated with half the 
planned amount of fertilizers. According to Yu. Ivanov, expert 
from the Kray Agricultural Administration, agrarians are 
particularly alarmed by the condition of winter crops -- some 20 
percent have already perished or thinned out drastically. And 
although the area devoted to grain in Stavropol Kray remains 
unchanged, the most optimistic forecasts anticipate obtaining 
just over 4 million tonnes of grain here -- 1 million down on 
last year. 
  Spring was also late in reaching the agricultural workers of 
the Don. The weather was cold, and alarming. In addition, 
small and large rivers alike burst their banks. But as our own 
correspondent A. Isayev reports, worse than any natural disaster 
was the shortage of fuel, fertilizers, and seed. Don villages 
were unable to purchase them on time for the usual reason: The 
state has yet to settle up for last year's grain. 
  Over 80 percent of Russian private farmers no longer rely on 
the state for help. Today, one-third of them are without fuel, 
seed, or machinery. A few have received credits in time for the 
sowing campaign, but under crushing interest rates of over 200 
percent. Forecasts by the leadership of the Association of 
Russian Peasant (Private) Farms and Agricultural Cooperatives 
[AKKOR], which addressed journalists a few days ago, are 
depressing: 30 percent of the lands belonging to private 
farmers will be left unsown. And in the Central Urals, this 
figure is even higher -- over 40 percent. As S. Teterin, 
chairman of the Association of Peasant Farms of this region, 
told us, 300 of the 3,500 Ural private farmers have declared 
themselves bankrupt, and very soon this number may double or 
even treble. 
  Today, field work is under way in the Northern Caucasus, in 
southern oblasts, in the Central Chernozem Region, and in some 
areas of the Volga Region, where seed drills have managed to 
"wade out" into the furrows. But the late spring, the flooding, 
and the shortage of equipment, fuel, fertilizer, and seed caused 
by there being no money, are preventing work from progressing at 
last year's pace as yet. For instance, only half the amount of 
winter crops were top-dressed. And the sowing of spring crops 
is 500,000 hectares behind schedule. 
  The Federation Council Committee for Agrarian Policy 
believes 
that "it is possible that the production of cereal crops in 
Russia will fall to 80 million tonnes" this year. This is 24 
million tonnes fewer than the average for 1986 through 1990. At 
the very least, the production of sugar beet, sunflowers, and 
flax fiber will drop by 10 percent. 
  Last fall, the sown area for winter crops shrank by 3.3 
million hectares (21 percent) compared to fall 1992. This means 
that spring crops will now have to be sown over an area 21 
percent larger. Only 66 percent of the necessary fallow land 
was plowed in the fall. Therefore, this spring the workload per 
tractor increases by almost half. Meanwhile, machinery has been 
poorly prepared. There is no farm in Russia which will have 
managed to purchase all the necessary spare parts, or, more 
especially, to renew vehicle and tractor fleets. 
  So it is quite likely that grain production in the country 
will not hit even a modest 80 million tonnes. And, you know, it 
is not yet known how nature, which is not always generous with 
good weather, will behave. And it is not clear what state 
policy will be -- a state where to this day reform is 
progressing without an agrarian program.... 
  Incidentally, today in the Don (and not only there) silos 
are 
crammed with grain from last year and even the year before. 
Unclaimed by anyone, it sows gloomy thoughts in the minds of the 
sowers themselves: Is our work required at all? This year, as 
we know, there will be no compulsory grain deliveries. Some 
600,000 tonnes of grain will have to be surrendered to the 
Federal Fund of Rostov Oblast -- this is significantly less than 
in the recent past. And the sower, who once puzzled over where 
to get fuel and spare parts, is now thinking about who will buy 
how much of his grain this fall. Or, indeed, will it be 
purchased at all?

<F P=106> [Report by unidentified ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent] </F>
  [Excerpts] Tashkent, 20 Apr -- Maintaining political 
stability and further economic development in the countries of 
Central Asia not only meets the fundamental interests of the 
countries of that region, but is also of important significance 
for the preservation of peace in Asia and throughout the world. 
This is stated in an information report issued today by the 
Chinese delegation on the results of the official visit to 
Uzbekistan by Chinese State Council Chairman Li Peng. China, it 
stresses, supports the efforts of the Uzbek Government in 
strengthening regional security and stability, steadying the 
situation in the country, and developing the national economy. 
  Li Peng left for Ashkhabad [Ashgabat] in the afternoon. 
[passage omitted] 
  Speaking to Uzbek parliamentarians on Tuesday [19 April], 
the 
head of the Chinese Government described the PRC's policy in 
relation to the Central Asian republics of the former USSR who 
are now living through difficulties that are typical of the 
whole post-Soviet situation. The four points of China's current 
policy in this region, which is populated mainly by Muslims, 
include: A policy of good-neighborliness, friendship, and 
peaceful coexistence, a rejection of hegemonism and a policy of 
force, mutually advantageous cooperation with the purpose of 
assisting general prosperity, and the development of trade and 
economic ties, respect for the choice of the peoples of all 
countries, recognition of the variety of models of development, 
and the right of choice of a social system, respect for 
independence and sovereignty, and assistance in regional 
stability. 
  Li Peng stressed that the development of relations between 
China and the Central Asian states is not directed against any 
third country. It is our wish that the Central Asian states 
live in harmony and develop friendly relations with all 
countries, including Russia and the other CIS states, he said. 
[passage omitted] 
  Today, the PRC State Council chairman visited the Tashkent 
Valeriy Chkalov Aviation Works. Last year China leased from 
Uzbekistan seven Il-76 heavy aircraft.

<F P=106> [Video report by correspondent Mukhtar Ganiyev from </F>
Tashkent, including recorded remarks by Uzbek President Islam 
Karimov; from the "Novosti" newscast] 
  [Text] We have received a report from Tashkent today on the 
visit to the Uzbek capital by Chinese State Council Chairman Li 
Peng. 
  [Ganiyev] Superpowers should not take upon themselves to 
resolve all of the world's problems, PRC State Council Prime 
Minister Li Peng said yesterday at a meeting with the parliament 
and public of Uzbekistan. No matter what model of development 
that states take, they have equal rights in the world community. 
This was the main idea in his speech that was heard here as 
part of the program. 
  The official Chinese delegation familiarized themselves with 
the operation of the Chkalov aviation production association in 
Tashkent this morning. I will remind you that besides buying 
Uzbekistan's traditional goods, China also purchases IL-76 
transport aircraft here. The Republic has dozens of joint 
enterprises with China, the goods from, which are in great 
demand. When acquainting himself with what is a unique 
enterprise for this region, the head of the Chinese Government 
expressed the hope -- during his short interview especially for 
our program -- that the visit will open up new prospects for 
cooperation between China and Uzbekistan. 
  [Karimov] The visit by the prime minister of the Chinese 
People's Republic is not only of political significance to us, 
but of economic significance as well. First and foremost, it is 
of economic importance because we have so many unused reserves 
when it comes to economic cooperation that it can be seen at a 
glance.

  [Text] Uzbek President Islam Karimov has issued a decree on 
regulations of export and import operations in foreign currency. 
The decree provides for an efficient control over currency 
earnings and its utilization when exporting services and 
commodities. 
  In accordance with the decree, Uzbek enterprises and 
organizations cannot settle their accounts on export and import 
with foreign partners through foreign banks. 
  The decree forbids legal entities to sell or pass over the 
quotas on export of services and commodities to other 
participants in the foreign economic activities. The Uzbek 
Ministry of Justice has been proposed to establish juridical 
responsibility of legal entities and individuals for violation 
of the order imposed on export and import operations in foreign 
currency.

  [Text] Crimea -- Deputies of the Crimean Supreme Soviet 
elected from the Russia bloc as well as deputies supporting the 
bloc's program have held a closed meeting. There are 61 such 
deputies (out of 94). The meeting decided to create a deputies 
group. Deputy Sergey Tsekov, chairman of the Republican Party 
of Crimea, which is affiliated with the Russia bloc, proposed 
that this deputies group fully support the president of the 
Crimean Republic. "Because this group effectively has a 
constitutional majority in the future parliament, any decision 
can be made ignoring the Crimean Tatar deputies (whose number is 
the new parliament is 14)," Tsekov said. This was decisively 
opposed by Vladimir Klychnikov, coordinator of the Russia bloc; 
and deputies Boris Kizilov and Vadim Mordashov.

  [Text] A Crimean declaration -- accord for revival -- was 
signed by a number of political parties operating on the 
peninsula in Simferopol. Our reporter Anatolyy Polonskyy 
comments on this issue. 
  [Polonskyy] Representatives of the mass media were asked to 
cover the declaration signing ceremony. My personal viewpoint 
is that the authors of this document wished to demonstrate the 
importance and significance of their work, which had been 
carried out by them in the name of the interparty and 
interethnic accord, which is the basis of the course aimed at 
the socioeconomic revival of the Crimea. Of course, the signing 
of the declaration was called an event of historical importance. 
Certainly, to leave the economic crisis, to be revived, the 
Crimea today requires peace and accord. We cannot help but to 
agree with the majority of the declaration's provisions. Who 
can oppose the provision stating that the principle of creation 
and not destruction should be the basis for practical 
activities, or that interparty relations should be based not on 
our differences but on similarities? However, this declaration 
remains a declaration if one says one thing but does the 
opposite. 
  In the Crimea, all the political forces favor peace and 
accord, no party calls for violating laws, and they all support 
the inviolable friendship among the Crimean peoples. How can 
the existence of [words indistinct] openly anti-Ukrainian 
slogans and appeals on the square in front of the legislature 
and the residence of the president be explained? These slogans 
and appeals are so insulting to the national Ukrainian dignity 
[words indistinct], said Oleksandr Fedorenko, representative of 
the Crimean section of the Ukrainian Republican Party, that he 
could not bring himself to sign this declaration. The actions 
on the square are supporting President Yuriy Meshkov, Oleksandr 
Fedorenko said. The question arises whether the president 
indulges the organizers of this action or whether this is just 
his policy. The more [words indistinct] near the president's 
residence, the fewer tourists (?will come) to the Crimea, 
representative of the Democratic Party of the Crimea Mykhaylo 
(Mareyev) added in support of Fedorenko. 
  Really, [words indistinct] to go to rest in the Crimea where 
interethnic hostility is flaring up near the legislature. Given 
this situation, can the declaration on some sort of accord be 
signed? At first, this accord should be reached and only later 
-- reported on. This is the reason why in addition to the 
Crimean section of the Ukrainian Republican Party, the 
declaration was not signed by the Crimean Civil Congress. The 
signature of the Crimean Tatars mejlis is also absent under the 
text of the declaration. Its representative was present in the 
assembly hall as an observer. The Communist Party of the Crimea 
refused even to observe this ceremony. So, was it really worth 
[words indistinct] with the signing of the declaration when 
there is no actual interparty and interethnic accord?

<F P=106> [Article by Volodymyr Skachko, HOLOS UKRAYINY columnist: </F>
"Stalemate as a Possible Development. Presidential Elections: 
More Problems Than Certainty"] 
  [Text] A typical, and in many ways determining feature of 
the parliamentary elections campaign in Ukraine is the fact that 
its completion coincided in time with the start of the 
presidential elections campaign, which started, in accordance 
with the law, 90 days prior to 26 June 1994. It is precisely 
this coincidence that has immediately revealed, first, several 
real threats to the presidential elections and, therefore, also 
to the sociopolitical stability in the country. Second, it has 
finally become clear to everybody that the contradictions 
emerging in this connection cannot, in fact, be resolved without 
violating the current laws. That is to say, one of the most 
typical characteristics of the "old" Supreme Council's 
legislative activity has clearly manifested itself: It first 
adopted laws and then thought them over and figured out how to 
implement them in such a way that they would be fulfilled. 
However, let us analyze everything in order. 
<H5>  Threat One </H5>
  It has already become obvious that, in accordance with the 
provisions of the law on presidential elections, there may 
simply be not enough time, since, on 27 April, the nomination 
and registering of candidates for Ukrainian president must be 
completed. Today, it is known that only the Socialist and 
Social Democratic parties have officially agreed to take part in 
the presidential elections. The Socialists have even been 
issued their first registration certificate. However, nobody 
has heard of personal nominations from those parties; there are 
no names. There did appear some information to the effect that 
515 Chernihiv citizens had nominated ex-prime minister L. Kuchma 
as a candidate for president, but nobody knows for sure what is 
next. It is, therefore, necessary either to speed up the 
process of nomination or to change the norms of the law. The 
latter may only be effected by the Supreme Council, whose last 
meeting has been appointed for 22 April. Then there will be 
days off [Saturday and Sunday] and the "difficult day," 
Monday.... In short, there remain only 10 days, but who cares 
about the political consequences of this situation? However, 
this is not the main point. 
<H5>  Threat Two </H5>
  This is the main threat, as everything else emanates from 
it. 
It is clear today that candidates must be nominated to the post 
of president, who is, in accordance with the current 
constitution, the head of both the state and the executive 
power. However, it is known that the old parliament agreed to 
reconsider the division of functions in the upper echelons of 
power. There is still no law on this. Instead, the law on the 
26 June elections to local power structures was adopted. In 
accordance with it, in the case of electing these bodies, the 
institution of presidential representatives in provinces will be 
abolished. In other words, a constitutional crisis of 
contradiction automatically arises. The president remains head 
of the executive power, but the executive vertically 
subordinated to him and to the government becomes abolished. 
  Well, it is not known today what kind of president we are 
going to elect, and this considerably complicates the task of 
compiling preelection programs for possible presidential 
candidates. It is simply not known what to promise to the 
people and on what platform to enlist supporters, without 
risking to become, excuse me for the word, a charlatan, if the 
law on the redistribution of powers is not adopted in favor of 
the presidential power. Incidentally, [President] L. Kravchuk 
had in mind precisely this when he refused to be registered as a 
presidential candidate. 
<H5>  Threat Three </H5>
  Today, the fate of the president in Ukraine is totally 
unknown. The new parliament may object to the existence of such 
an institution and simply abolish it. It may then transpire 
that, on the one hand, there are people wishing to become 
candidates and there even are presidential candidates who 
started their election campaign, but there is no institution of 
the presidency. It is futile to expect that the new law on the 
new powers for the Ukrainian president will be adopted by the 
present Supreme Council on 22 April and, as a result, it will be 
necessary to wait for the first plenary session of the new 
parliament. It is not yet known when it will be held. Nor is 
it known whether the new parliament will be able to elaborate 
and adopt the new law in a constructive and efficient manner. 
  Suppose that there are no presidential candidates until the 
new parliament ultimately makes a ruling on the issue of the 
presidency, and that the new parliament will convene in the 
middle of May and will adopt the necessary law. Then, there 
still remains one question: How about the 90 days assigned for 
holding the presidential election campaign? There only are 
three possible variants: Either to change the current law on 
presidential elections, to violate it openly and hold elections 
within shorter time limits, or to postpone the presidential 
elections by several months. In any case, there will suddenly 
emerge other problems: What kind of president will it be if he 
is elected in a hurry? What will be the attitude of those 
political forces, which demanded the presidential elections, to 
their postponement? What will be done about the law on holding 
the elections on 26 June? What will be done about the elections 
of local power bodies, and so on? 
  Head of the Ukrainian Presidential Legal Service Ivan 
Tymchenko said that there may also be the following variant with 
regard to the Ukrainian presidency other than its abolishment 
without elections: First, the president will be elected in 
accordance with the current constitution and then a new entry 
will be made in the new one to the effect that there is no 
presidency in Ukraine, and then the president will resign ahead 
of time. Second, the elections will proceed in accordance with 
the current constitution, but in the new Main Law it will be 
specified that the president is only the head of state and 
therefore, some of the powers for which people voted will be 
taken away from the president. I. Tymchenko clearly referred to 
the above situations as a "legislative deception of the voters," 
something that may only lead to one thing -- a constitutional 
crisis, when nobody will know what to govern and how to govern. 
In addition to that, for example, the institution of the 
presidency is provided for in our current constitution, and in 
order to abolish it, it is either necessary to make 
corresponding changes in the Main Law or, again, adopt 
corresponding constitutional laws, something which is 
practically impossible to accomplish with an incomplete 
composition of the deputies corps. 
<H5>  Threat Four </H5>
  Let us imagine that the elections did take place and 
resulted 
in electing a president as the head of state, and local bodies 
of representative power whose heads will also preside over the 
local administrations. This situation will not simply be one of 
stalemate. It will be disastrous for the integrity of the 
state, because there are no levers for the center to influence 
the local power bodies and no mechanisms for determining the 
responsibility for the failure to fulfill the laws or general 
state programs. Nationwide elections of local leaders may turn 
them into de facto princes, Ukraine's federalization will be 
brought about spontaneously and, instead of an integral and 
balanced state organism, there will emerge a disintegrated state 
structure composed of centrifugally oriented territories. 
Besides, the new parliament may also turn completely into a 
place for competition among regional deputations, as, in our 
single-chamber Supreme Council, there is no special body (like, 
for example, a chamber for the issues of territories), which 
might take care of balancing relations between the center and 
regions. 
  Consequently, in the situation which has taken shape today, 
it is difficult to draw any constructive conclusions. It is 
difficult to dispel an impression that the prevailing mood among 
the ruling elite is "well, things will somehow settle down," and 
this mood has absolutely nothing to do with laws. Are we going 
to look for our separate Ukrainian road. In other words, will we 
proceed from the principle: It's your property and your fire, so 
burn it if you desire! Despite the laws?...

  [Text] Kiev -- UNIAN has learned from reliable sources that 
the Central Electoral Commission has ruled the holding of repeat 
elections on 24 July in constituencies where the election was 
invalid or neither of the candidates was elected. A recent 
sitting of Ukraine's Supreme Council presidium proposed to hold 
repeat elections to the Ukrainian Parliament at the same time as 
the second round of local elections, that is, on 10 July. 
However, the Central Electoral Commission has calculated that 
this period would not be long enough for all the stages of 
election envisaged by the electoral law: Nomination and 
registration of candidates, election campaign, etc., of which it 
has informed Ukraine's Supreme Council presidium in writing.

  [Text] Kiev 20 April TASS -- Ukrainian Vice-Premier Valeri 
Shmarov said at multilateral consultations in the Ukrainian 
Foreign Ministry on Tuesday that several projects and programms 
on liquidating nuclear weapons and conversion are of top 
priority for Ukraine. 
  They were offered for consideration to several Western 
countries which expressed a desire to give aid to Ukraine in 
this sphere. 
  The main attention was given to projects concerning the 
conversion of munitions factories, their reorientation on the 
output of civil products, solution of social problems, 
construction of housing for retiring servicemen and their 
retraining to learn civil professions and trades. 
  Asked by journalists to comment on this important event, 
Shmarov said: "It is very pleasant that many states as well as 
influential international organisations responded to our 
problems of liquidating nuclear weapons. 
  "This is a great political support for us. As for real 
economic aid, we hope for receiving what they can give."

<F P=106> ["Appeal by the Ukrainian Peace Council and by the Ukrainian </F>
Peace Foundation"; Kiev, 14 April 1994] 
  [Text] The peace-loving public of Ukraine has been, and 
continues to seek the suspension of the operation of the 
Chernobyl Atomic Electric Power Plant [AES]. We sincerely 
rejoiced when the Supreme Council adopted its decision on 
suspending the operation of this notorious monster. However, 
unfortunately, ignoring public opinion and without holding a 
nationwide discussion, a decision was adopted in secrecy not 
only on the resumption of the Chernobyl AES operation, but also 
on commissioning new units at the Zaporizhzhya, Khmelnytskyy, 
and Rivne AES, as well as on a significant expansion over the 
whole of atomic power engineering and even on the creation in 
Ukraine of a nuclear-fuel cycle, starting from the extraction of 
uranium ore and ending with reprocessing radioactive waste and 
its burial. We reiterate that all of this is being planned 
without the public's knowledge. 
  At the same time, the International Atomic Energy Agency, as 
a result of the work of its commission at the Chernobyl AES, 
arrived at the conclusion that there are many "unresolved 
problems" at the plant. 
  For eight years, Chernobyl and other Ukrainian atomic plants 
have been giving rise to alarm in European countries. The 
European public, just like us, demands that the dangerous 
reactors be stopped. 
  Stressing again the inadmissibility of ignoring public 
opinion, we are calling upon the Ukrainian president to suspend 
the action of the unpublished edict on the development of atomic 
power engineering in Ukraine and to carry an extensive and open 
discussion of this burning problem. 
  Kiev, 14 April 1994

  [Text] Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev today received 
the U.S. ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary to our 
Republic, Richard Kozlaric. Our correspondent Sakit Ochakhly 
reports: 
  [Begin Ochakhly recording] New U.S. Ambassador Richard 
Kozlaric presented his credentials to Geydar Aliyev at the 
presidential residence today. The ambassador noted that as the 
official representative of the United States in Azerbaijan he 
will do everything to develop bilateral ties in a healthy spirit 
and broaden ties in the social, political, scientific, and 
cultural fields. 
  Kozlaric also stated that in his new post he will use every 
means to objectively convey the developments in Azerbaijan to 
the international community, primarily to the country he 
represents, and to speedily end the conflict between Azerbaijan 
and Armenia. He also said that the agreement to be signed with 
Azerbaijan's oil company will open a new phase in economic 
cooperation. 
  President Aliyev congratulated Kozlaric on his appointment 
as 
the U.S. ambassador to our Republic and wished him success in 
such a responsible task. The president noted that the 
development of diplomatic relations with a great country like 
the United States would help to establish closer ties between 
the two peoples. 
  Aliyev briefed the new ambassador on the sociopolitical 
situation in Azerbaijan, Armenia's aggressive policy, and the 
results of the meeting of CIS heads of state in Moscow. He 
noted that everyone knows the problems faced by a country 20 
percent of the land of which has been occupied and that has over 
1 million refugees, yet the United States has imposed an embargo 
on humanitarian assistance to Azerbaijan. He hoped that the new 
ambassador would appraise developments and the situation 
realistically and inform his country that Armenia is an 
occupying state. 
  Later a frank talk was held between Aliyev and Kozlaric. 
They exchanged views on issues of mutual interest. [end

  [Text] "The deployment of any forces in Abkhazia without 
its leadership's consent is ruled out," the chairman of 
Abkhazia's parliament, Vladislav Ardzinba, told Interfax on 
Wednesday. 
  With reference to the possible participation of military 
contingents from CIS countries in the peace-keeping forces in 
Abkhazia he said that "it is possible only in the framework of 
documents signed on April 4." 
  In comments on the talks on Abkhazia's political status 
which 
began in Geneva on Tuesday Ardzinba stressed that "there is no 
alternative to peace negotiations." According to him, when 
taking part in the negotiating process Abkhazia proceeds from 
the agreements signed in Moscow on April 4." "On the contrary, 
the Georgian side seems to have forgotten about it," the 
Abkhazian leader pointed out. 
  As he said, the statement made on Georgian radio on Monday 
by 
the Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze, as to "the possibility 
of resolving the conflict militarily", cannot be understood in 
any other way. According to Ardzinba, this is "a gross 
violation of the documents signed in Moscow." 
  On April 4 in Moscow the two sides signed a statement on 
ways 
to reach a political solution to the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict 
and an agreement on the voluntary return of refugees and 
displaced persons.

  [Text] Abkhazia's Defense Minister Sultan Sosnaliyev 
considers it unlikely that hostilities between the Abkhazian and 
Georgian formations will resume along the confrontation line of 
the Inguri river. "We are not moving and our opponents do not 
have enough forces to inflict a strike," Sosnaliyev declared in 
an interview with Interfax. As he said, the situation on the 
Inguri river "is very calm now." 
  Sosnaliyev pointed out that the Abkhazian army does not 
intend to cross Abkhazia's "historic border" and to occupy 
Georgian territory. At the same time he said that "as a result 
of the defeat of the Georgian army we could cross the Inguri 
river and move further on." 
  Sosnaliyev talked about the strong support given by Russia's 
Caucasian republics to Abkhazia. He said that this would not 
allow Moscow to render widescale military assistance to Georgia 
while relations with Abkhazia were not regulated. "Russia 
should bear in mind the Caucasian factor," he underlined. 
  Sosnaliyev reported that as many as 12,000 volunteers from 
the North Caucuses had been fighting on the Abkhaz side. "If it 
is necessary, this number can be increased to 50,000," he said. 
  Speaking about the situation in Abkhazia's Kondor canyon 
where Georgian armed detachments have been blocked, Sosnaliyev 
reported that no hostilities are going on there. The Abkhaz 
side proposed to the Georgian fighters to lay down their arms 
and guaranteed their safety. There was no answer to this 
proposal. 
  Sultan Sosnaliyev, aged 52, is a Kabardinian, a colonel of 
the former Soviet Army. He was commander of a regiment and then 
chief of one of the aviation colleges. 
  In August 1992 when the Georgian army entered Abkhazia, 
Sosnaliyev headed the republic's Military council. In December 
1992 he was chief of the army headquarters and in May 1993 -- 
Abkhazia's Defense Minister. In April 1993 Abkhazian parliament 
awarded him the rank of Mayor General and in December -- of 
Lieutenant General.

  [Excerpt] According to EVRAZIA news agency, the ethnic 
cleansing of Georgians continues in Sukhumi. 
  Thirty Georgians, mainly old people, were evicted from 
Sukhumi on 15 April. Those people who do not obey the 
separatists' demands to leave their own homes invariably 
disappear. 
  Confrontation between the so-called pure-blooded Abkhazians 
and the Abkhazians of Georgian descent, grows day by day. 
According to the separatists, Georgian Abkhazians must not be 
trusted. In their opinion they [Georgian Abkhazians] are fickle 
and if the situation should change, they will side with the 
Georgians. Therefore, the so-called pure Abkhazians are 
creating specialized armed formations for liquidating Georgian 
Abkhazians. These formations do not spare other nationalities 
either. A clear example of the above-mentioned is the mass 
carnage of the Greek population in the village of Odishi by the 
separatists. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Tbilisi April 20 TASS -- Georgian Deputy Interior 
Minister Georgi Gulua, 38, who headed Georgian Transport Police, 
fell another victim of terrorist acts this morning. He and his 
two subordinates were riddled with bullets when they were 
driving to his office. Terrorists escaped from the place of 
crime unidentified. 
  This is the eighth terrorist act in Georgia against a 
high-ranking government official over the past few months. Law 
enforcement bodies could not identify executors of 
assassinations even once. 
  Head of the State Security Service Igor Georgadze told 
journalists at a recent news conference that Georgia is living 
through a period of fierce struggle between mafia clans, and 
that terrorist acts are inevitable.

  [Text] Eduard Shevardnadze, chairman of the Georgian 
parliament and head of State, received Mr. Kananabeldy, first 
deputy chairman of the State Committee for Material and 
Technical Supplies of the Republic of Turkmenistan, who led a 
delegation of Turkmen industrialists on their visit in Tbilisi. 
  The aim of the delegation's visit to Georgia was to choose 
agricultural and industrial products in exchange for Georgia's 
still unpaid debt. The Turkmen side once again showed its full 
understanding of the current complex economic situation in the 
republic, which was reflected in the fact that Georgia will 
supply Turkmenistan with Georgian products in exchange for 3 
billion cubic meters of gas worth several million U.S. dollars, 
as envisaged in the bilateral agreement signed in 1994. 
Meanwhile, our Turkmen friends accepted the prices suggested by 
us. 
  The head of state thanked the Turkmen side for their 
fruitful 
cooperation and understanding of our problems. Shevardnadze 
said: Our republic's population knows very well about your 
realistic support, and we will do everything to carry out our 
responsibilities. 
  At the meeting, Shevardnadze raised the issue of the 
importance of finding new and economically useful ways to 
transport Turkmen gas to Georgia and other countries. 
  Georgian Prime Minister Otar Patsatsia, Deputy Prime 
Minister 
Zurab Kervalishvili, and other officials were present at the 
meeting.

  [Excerpt] TALLINN, Apr 20, BNS - Estonian Prime Minister 
Mart Laar on his visit to the United States met with Vice 
President Al Gore in Washington Tuesday [19 April]. 
  Laar in his remarks to the Voice of America ahead of the 
meeting said getting a reconfirmation of America's support to 
the demand for an early withdrawal of Russian troops for Estonia 
was one of the main aims of his visit. This, as well as 
economic cooperation are also to top the list at the meeting 
with the Vice President, he said. 
  "At this meeting a number of very important agreements on 
economic cooperation will be signed," Laar told VOA. 
  Commenting later on the outcome of the meeting with Al Gore, 
Laar said "the American side was in a very concrete manner ready 
to respond to our main proposals." He said it now depends on 
Estonia's other departments how quickly (the work on) these 
agreements will proceed, the PAEVALEHT newspaper reports with 
reference to VOA. 
  Laar had meetings with U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry 
and Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott on Monday. The 
prime minister said that Estonia had received very strong 
support to the demand that Russian troops be pulled out of the 
country by Aug. 31. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The commander in chief of the NATO northern group, 
Gen Garry Johnson, ended today his three-day visit to Estonia. 
He stayed here at the invitation of Maj-Gen Aleksandr Einseln, 
commander of the Estonian defense forces. He had meetings with 
President Lennart Meri, Foreign Minister Juri Luik, and Defense 
Minister Indrek Kannik. Before leaving, the general gave a brief 
news conference at the airport. Marit Pukk reports: 
  [Pukk] The general assessed his Estonian visit as useful, 
first and foremost, from the standpoint of an exchange of 
information. What was discussed at the meetings with the 
Estonian leaders? 
  [Begin Johnson recording, in English fading into Estonian 
translation] What we've been talking about is developing the 
cooperation that already exists between the Estonian defense 
forces and NATO... [end recording] 
  [Pukk] At the meetings there was talk about the 
opportunities of strengthening the cooperation between NATO and 
Estonian defense forces that already exists. Such is the NATO 
Partnership for Peace Program that Estonia has already joined. 
Also Estonian defense officers are welcome guests at the 
headquarters of the NATO northern group in Norway, and units of 
the Estonian defense forces are welcome to participate with the 
status as observers at the exercises of NATO forces that take 
place in Norway and also in Denmark. 
  The general mentioned as specific assistance by the NATO, 
the 
training and continuation of training of Estonian officers in 
Norway and Denmark. An Estonian representative will soon go to 
the headquarters of the NATO forces of Europe in Brussels. He 
will begin to coordinate the mentioned work. 
  In response to a question on what the general thought of the 
relations between Estonia and Russia, especially of the Russian 
troops still staying here, he said: 
  [Begin Johnson recording, in English fading into Estonian 
translation] [words indistinct] the relationships between two 
independent sovereign countries (?are not clear)... [end 
recording] 
  [Pukk] This is not, of course, for me to comment upon, as 
this concerns the mutual relationships between two independent 
countries. But the (?fault) it could be said is that [35-second 
break in transmission] 
  [Begin Einseln recording, in progress] ...then Lt (?Lants) 
will accompany me to Brussels next week, and he will remain 
there and begin work. Since all this is new to NATO as well, 
then naturally, how this will finally be worked out will be 
shown by time. [end recording] 
  [Pukk] General Johnson flew from Tallinn for a one-day visit 
to Riga. From there he will go further to Vilnius. After that 
he (?will go) to his headquarters in Norway where next week he 
must report on the results of the [words indistinct] On the 
basis of that report, the leadership of the NATO European forces 
will make a further specified program of work within the 
Partnership for Peace Program in the Baltic countries.

  [Text] What are often emotional, negative statements by 
Estonian journalists and politicians about the Russian military 
will be a thing of the past after Russia has withdrawn its 
troops from Estonia and it will be possible to develop 
cooperation with the "eastern neighbor's" armed forces, 
Estonia's commander-in-chief said. 
  "We are neighbors and must live together in peace instead of 
threatening each other with our fists all the time," 
Major-General Aleksander Einseln said to Interfax before his 
departure for Moscow on Wednesday. At the same time, Russian 
military bases and any other form of Russian military presence 
in Estonia are "out of the question," he said. 
  Einseln said one of the main purposes of his trip to Moscow, 
where he had been invited by the Russian Defense Ministry, was 
to ensure concrete cooperation at the final stage of Russian 
troop withdrawal from Estonia. Russia earlier offered to pull 
out all its troops by August 31 but linked this to the provision 
of residence permits and social security measures for retired 
Russian military officers living in Estonia. 
  Einseln plans to propose setting up a bilateral military 
commission to quickly and efficiently deal with any troop 
withdrawal problems. 
  He said he was on "civil" terms with the command of the 
Russian forces remaining in Estonia.

  [Text] Construction of modern technical control

vision instruments, will begin on the Estonian border this 
summer. 
  This was announced in an interview for the paper PAEVALEHT 
by 
Tarmo Kyuts, general director of the Estonian border protection 
department. According to him, at the moment most border guards 
are equipped only with binoculars and automatic weapons. Kyuts 
announced that the most difficult section of the border is the 
"control line with Russia." One of the most profitable criminal 
occupations there is the trade in "live goods." Border guards 
are offerd $50 each to help ferry one Kurd across the 
Russian-Estonian border. Kyuts noted that the organizers of the 
illegal ferrying of people to the northern countries in Russia 
and their assistants in Estonia are making millions.

  [Text] Tallinn, Apr 20, BNS -- Deputy speaker of the 
Estonian parliament, Tunne Kelam, in an interview with BNS today 
said joining the European Union [EU] is what Estonia objectively 
needs to do. 
  "This is an objective direction, because we have no other 
alternative between two different worlds and traditions," he 
said. 
  But he said Estonia's movement in the direction of the EU 
didn't mean turning its back to the East. Kelam said Estonia 
also in the future will be ready for active trade and 
communication with the East. "But at present the question is how 
to make up for the 50-year gap in our relations with the Western 
countries." 
  In addition to the global aspect, the European economic and 
defense organizations are what Estonia hopes will help resolve 
the country's most important security and economic problems, he 
said. 
  Kelam in the interview said that Estonia must not go to 
Europe "as a schoolboy, who unconditionally tries to adjust 
himself to everything that exists." 
  "Estonia is bringing to Europe its experience, a national 
tradition and individuality. We must not loose or underestimate 
these qualities," he said. 
  Kelam pointed out that Estonia can get a very important 
mediator's role in Europe both politically and culturally. 
  "I wouldn't place the accent on the final point of the 
integration with Europe, but on that the beginning of the 
process has been a promising one and we have managed to earn a 
good reputation in Europe," he said.

  [Text] Estonian Government gave authorities to deputy 
chancellor of the Foreign Ministry Raul Malk to sign an 
agreement between Estonia and Belarus on national minorities, 
Reform Minister Liia Hanni told a press conference on Tuesday 
[19 April]. 
  Hanni said that the agreement will include both Estonian 
nationals that live in Belarus and have Belarusian citizenship 
and Belarusians that have Estonian citizenship. She said that 
the reason the agreement had to be concluded was that there were 
not enough Belarusians in Estonia to grant them rights according 
to the law on cultural autonomy, which gives bigger minorities 
in Estonia rights to found cultural organisations, open schools 
etc.

  [Text] Tallinn, Apr 19, BNS -- The representative of 
Russian radical nationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky's 
Liberal Democratic party in Estonia, Pyotr Rozhok, was elected 
the chairman of the presidium of Tallinn's League of Russian 
Citizens. 
  The organization of Russian citizens in the Estonian capital 
was established on April 9. 
  Rozhok said the new body is to defend the interests of 
Russian citizen residents of Tallinn. He added that this was to 
be done "only within the limits set by legal acts," by 
bringing, as he said, to the world's notice all violations of 
the rights of Russian citizens in Estonia. The new body is to 
address the United Nations and the Russian parliament on the 
issue in the near future, Rozhok said. 
  He added that there are about 30,000 legal Russian citizens 
living in Tallinn. 
  The organization in Tallinn will also prepare the documents 
necessary for its registration with the Estonian authorities. 
"But I'm more than sure that we will never be registered," 
Rozhok said. 
  The league is also an in corpore member of the Russian 
Community of Estonia, another hardline Russian-speakers' 
organization that has failed so far to gain a formal status with 
Estonia's authorities. 
  More than 42,000 Estonian residents have taken Russian 
citizenship by now.

  [Text] Tallinn, Apr 20, BNS -- Estonia as of April 1 had 
registered 19,521 persons as unemployed. The figure makes up 
2.22 percent of the country's population in the working age 
groups. 
  This is the highest recorded unemployment rate in Estonia 
since last May, when the figure rose to 2.6 percent. 
  The Estonian Labor Market Department in its comments to the 
report says the tendency toward higher jobless rates is due to 
the general restructuring under way in the economy, as well as 
the privatization of state companies. Another factor 
contributing to higher rates in Estonia is the establishment of 
local employment record offices in rural areas, which makes it 
easier for residents in more distant areas to come to register. 
  The highest regional unemployment rate for April 1 was 7.33, 
also up from 6.46 percent of March 1, reported in the 
northeastern town of Narva, where 3,545 had been registered as 
out of job. Next on the list came the southeastern Vorumaa 
region with 6.47 percent, or 1,500 jobless, and its neighboring 
Polva region with 6.31 percent, or 1,171 jobless. Unemployment 
rates were also above five percent in the northeastern 
Ida-Virumaa region with the town of Kohtla- Jarve, as well as on 
the western island of Hiiumaa. 
  The country's capital, Tallinn, still manages to keep 
jobless 
rates low, reporting a meager 0.127-percent unemployment, or 754 
residents officially without a job. 
  Estonia as of March 1 had registered 18,273 jobless, which 
corresponds to a national unemployment rate of 2.08 percent.

  [Text] Riga, Apr 19, BNS -- The leftist Democratic 
Initiative Center [DIC] party will not participate in the local 
government elections in order "not to take away votes from other 
political organizations," said party spokesman Olegs Vovks. 
  The local government election law does not correspond to the 
party's program that supports the franchise of all residents, 
Vovks said. 
  Commeting on the League of Stateless Persons, Vovk said it 
had no rights to represent all 700,000 non-citizens of Latvia in 
the local elections as it wanted to do. 
  The Democratic Initiative Center would endorse a popular 
referendum on citizenship proposing a five year residence 
qualification, language skills and knowledge of basic principles 
of Constitution as terms for naturalization, Vovks said. 
  Vovks conceded that he did not believe that Latvian citizens 
would support DIC version for the country's citizenship law. 
But he said the party would still demand a referendum to bring 
the citizenship problem in the focus of popular attention. 
  DIC was founded in 1989. It has a membership of 53 now.

  [Text] Vilnius, Apr 20, BNS -- Albinas Januska, Lithuanian 
deputy foreign minister, and Per Gullik Stavnum, Norway's 
ambassador to Lithuania, on Wednesday [20 April] signed a 
protocol on agreements regulating relations between the two 
countries. 
  The protocol annulled a 1923 agreement on trade and 
navigation and a reciprocal agreement on exempting automobiles 
and other motor vehicles from road taxes, the Lithuanian 
Ministry said. 
  The two pre-war agreements were replaced by a free trade 
agreement and an agreement on international transportation by 
road. 
  A ministry official said the protocol eliminated certain 
legal problems because both pre-war and newly signed agreements 
were considered effective.

  [Text] To date, the Lithuanian economy subjects debt to the 
power engineering system is in the sum of 230 million litas. 
This was said by Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius on 
Lithuanian Radio today. 
  According to him, the government will be compelled to adopt 
unpopular measures because such a debt cannot be endless. In 
spite of all debts, the supply of hot water to Lithuania's 
residents will not be interrupted. It is natural that the 
prices of the power engineering sources will go up, because they 
have not changed for almost a year, and inflation has been 
taking place in all branches of the economy, said Adolfas 
Slezevicius. The compensation mechanism, because of the future 
increase in the price for people who must be socially supported, 
has already been prepared. 
  According to the prime minister, in the size of fuel and 
electricity subsidies, Lithuania occupies first place among the 
Baltic states. According to him, Lithuania subsidizes about 70 
percent of the true price of electricity, Latvia -- about 30 
percent, and Estonia has altogether rejected such subsidies. 
This year over 200 million litas are to be allocated in the 
budget to subsidize the power engineering system. 
  Power Engineering Minister Algimantas Stasiukynas, who took 
part in the broadcast, said that the power engineering system 
has so far used about 145 million dollars of foreign credits. 
Commenting on such use of foreign credits by Lithuania, Adolfas 
Slezevicius said that because of a great shortage of turnover 
funds in the power engineering system and of high debts for fuel 
to foreign countries, we have been compelled to use part of the 
foreign credits to amass state fuel reserves. According to him, 
this made it possible essentially, to eliminate all debts for 
the purchase of fuel and remain warm during the last winter. 
  Today, Lithuania has no oil debts, and the natural gas debt 
is in the sum of 25 million dollars. Meanwhile, the gas 
consumers debt to the power engineering system is in the sum of 
60 million dollars. By the way, Lithuania has been paying world 
prices for fuel for the second year now.

  [Text] Vilnius, Apr 19, BNS -- The basic principles of 
Lithuania's participation in NATO's Partnership for Peace 
program are ready, said Deputy Foreign Minister Albinas Januska, 
who also heads a group preparing Lithuania's presentation 
document for the program. 
  At a press conference Tuesday [19 April], Januska said the 
Defense Ministry and the Armed Forces Staff are expected to 
present their final suggestions in the near future, and the 
document will then be submitted to NATO for consideration. 
  In his words, NATO experts are satisfied with Lithuania's 
document as a basis for developing cooperation with the 
alliance, including participation in peacekeeping missions. 
  "The document for participation in Partnership for Peace is 
our preparation for expanding NATO toward the East," Januska 
said. He noted that NATO experts suggested not to hasten the 
preparation of the presentation document, in order to make it as 
constructive as possible. 
  The deputy minister said the State Defense Council's 
decision 
to hand over border control to the Interior Ministry is 
reflected in the presentation document. 
  Januska was unable to estimate the approximate cost of 
Lithuania's participation in the program, but he expressed hope 
that NATO members will help to implement the program. According 
to the partnership Framework Document, which was signed by 
Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas in Brussels January 27, 
each country will fund its own participation in partnership 
activities, although assistance through bilateral agreements 
with NATO members is also possible. Januska noted that Denmark 
and Great Britain have greatly contributed to the creation of a 
Baltic peacekeeping battalion.

  [Text] Vilnius, Apr 19, BNS -- The Lithuanian Union of 
Peasants, which resumed its activities in 1990 after a 50-year 
break, was reorganized into a political party at the union's 
congress last weekend. 
  The union said "neither the leftists nor the rightists care 
about peasants in Lithuania, therefore there is nothing left to 
do but to unite ourselves into a party." 
  The new party's principal aims will be to implement the land 
reform and the law on cooperatives. 
  During its congress, the union sharply criticized the 
previous parliament for its "ruinous" land policy and the 
present government for reducing import tariffs on agricultural 
production. The union qualified such measures as "the 
government's direct aggression against local farmers." 
  The congress elected independent MP Albinas Vaismuzis to 
head 
the new party. Vaismuzis, who was elected in a single-mandate 
district, said his party's orientation is "to the left of the 
center."

  [Text] A fully charged antitank mine was found on Tuesday 
morning on the railroad station square in Vilnius. The police 
received information about the mine at 0645. The fire brigade 
and police blocked all approaches to the railroad station. The 
mine was disarmed. It had been wrapped in a polyethylene bag 
and could explode if touched by a passing vehicle. It took 45 
minutes to eliminate the danger. During this time all 
operations at the Vilnius railroad station were stopped. 
  The police had difficulty shutting trading kiosks as their 
owners, according to policemen, preferred to lose their lives 
than leave their property.

  [Text] Lithuanian Foreign Minister Povilas Gylys says 
Russia appears to have hardened its position towards Lithuania. 
The foreign minister, who is visiting Brazil, told the Russian 
ITAR-TASS agency on Wednesday that he knew of no reasons why 
Lithuanian-Russian relations should deteriorate. 
  According to Mr. Gylys, Russia is halting the ratification 
of 
the bilateral agreement on most favored nation status in trade 
signed last autumn. Russia has already granted privileged trade 
terms to 130 countries, however,this does not apply to the 
Baltic states. Lithuania carries out its all commitments to 
Russia and would like Moscow in its turn to observe its 
obligations to Lithuania, said the Lithuanian foreign minister.

  [Text] The Lithuanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has sent 
a note to the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs on some 
distortions in Polish publications. 
  The Polish Information Agency has been distributing at the 
parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe in Strasbourg a 
publication entitled "Outlines of the History of the Polish 
State," in which the Vilnius area is included in Poland. 
  The information and press department of the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs states that attention is drawn in the note to 
the fact that the distribution of such publications on the eve 
of the meeting of the Lithuanian and Polish presidents cannot 
but provoke a negative assessment by Lithuanian society and does 
not contribute to the consolidation of good relations between 
the two countries.

<F P=106> [Galina Afanasyeva report in the "Situation" column: </F>
"Lithuania Watches Ostankino"] 
  [Text] Recently the governing board of the Lithuanian 
Radio and TV Company asked viewers to respond to the question: 
Should the Ostankino TV channel be preserved in Lithuania? 
  The request was due to the fact that this year the term of 
the agreement whereby the Ostankino TV Company covered the costs 
of beaming its programs to Lithuania has run out. As of April, 
Channel I programs were to be broadcast free of charge only up 
to the borders. 
  In Lithuania, where Russian speakers constitute less than 20 
percent, Ostankino's rating is substantially higher than of 
other TV companies, including state TV. Therefore Lithuanian 
Radio and TV Company executives decided to conduct a survey to 
make sure whether it is worth asking the government to allocate 
funds from its scarce budget to pay for Ostankino programs. 
  In spite of the fact that this appeal to viewers came on the 
eve of a holiday -- the Catholic Easter -- the Radio and TV 
Committee was showered with letters. According to Committee 
Board Chairman Gedeminas Ilgunas, 90 percent of correspondents 
-- predominantly Lithuanians -- spoke in favor of keeping the 
Ostankino channel. The Lithuanian Radio and TV directors 
considered this sufficient grounds for forwarding an official 
request to the government on allocating the requisite funds. 
  Experts estimate that to satisfy the Lithuanians' wish to 
watch Ostankino from 1800 till the end of the programs (on 
average 45 hours a week), 800,000 lits ($200,000) will be needed 
annually. The board is going to ask the government for another 
200,000 lits to pay for Mayak radio broadcasts. 
  These spending plans were called into question by opposition 
leader Vytautas Landsbergis. He promised to state his case in a 
special letter to the premier. Now it is up to the government 
to decide who has a stronger case to argue.

  [Text] The third round of talks between the presidents of 
North Ossetia and Ingushetia Akhsarbek Galazov and Ruslan Aushev 
will be decisive, head of the temporary administration in the 
state of emergency zone Vladimir Lozovoy said in an interview 
with Interfax in Nazran. 
  The leaders of the two neighboring republics are expected to 
meet in the capital of Kabardino-Balkaria, Nalchik, next week. 
At the previous round of talks the two sides agreed only on the 
preamble to the treaty on the implementation of the Russian 
president's decree on the return of refugees and forced migrants 
in the zone of the Ossetian-Ingush conflict. 
  "If this time talks bring no concrete results, there is no 
sense in wasting time further," Lozovoy believes. In his 
opinion, the Russian Security Council and the Federal Assembly 
will then have "to clearly indicate what the temporary 
administration and the presidents of both republics should do." 
Lozovoy noted that he had established normal working contacts 
with Galazov and Aushev. But in resolving problems he adheres 
only to the policy of the center. "Precisely from this position 
I would like to state that all of us should work for the sake of 
accord in Russia," Lozovoy said.

  [Text] Ingush President Ruslan Aushev called on Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin to take efficient measures to stabilize 
the situation in the zone of the Ossetian-Ingush conflict. 
Aushev has sent an open letter to Yeltsin emphasizing that the 
decisions by the Russian leadership on normalization of the 
situation and return of refugees and displaced persons to their 
permanent residences are not being implemented. The state of 
emergency in the conflict zone has continued for two years 
already and more than 60,000 refugees cannot return to North 
Ossetia. 
  Aushev said the Moscow talks between the North Ossetian and 
Ingush delegations had brought practically no results. He 
suggested that any further delay in implementation of the 
Russian president's decree on refugees and displaced persons 
issued on December 13, 1993, could trigger off unpredictable 
consequences. 
  Aushev addressed the Russian president as the guarantee for 
human rights in Russia to use all his power in order to prevent 
new inter-ethnic conflicts in North Caucuses.

  [Text] At a meeting in the office of the Chechen President 
Dhozkhar Dudayev on Tuesday a letter sent by Russian 
Vice-Premier Sergey Shakhray was discussed. It was allegedly 
submitted to the State Duma marked "Confidential". The 12-page 
document contains recommendations to the Russian leadership 
regarding the tactics and strategy in the resolution of the 
Chechen problem. 
  The Chechen presidential office told Interfax that Shakhray 
recommended that in the settlement of the Russian-Chechen 
relations, the main stakes should be made on political forces 
opposing Dudayev. 
  "This is another sign that Russian diplomacy is not in 
control of the situation," a high-ranking official of the 
Chechen presidential staff pointed out. In his opinion, the 
Russian leadership is currently trying to reanimate supporters 
of the former first secretary of the Chechen-Ingush Regional 
Committee Doka Zavgayev who was dismissed from this post in 1991 
and is now living in Moscow. 
  At a conference in Groznyy the Security Department submitted 
a document to the Chechen president, saying that Shakhray 
maintains close relations with the Chechen opposition.

  [Text] Groznyy, 20 Apr -- Any talks or consultations with 
Russia should only be held by persons who have the authorization 
of the people to do so, Yaragi Mamodayev, head of the Government 
of National Trust of Chechnya, believes. In a telephone 
conversation with an ITAR-TASS correspondent today, he said that 
"it is necessary to hold a congress of the Chechen people in the 
near future to work out the basic criteria for solving the 
problem of Russian-Chechen inter-relations." 
  In the words of Yaragi Mamodayev, the government he leads 
has 
already begun preparing this forum. Consultations with the 
chairman of Chechnya's Constitutional Court, well-known public 
and religious figures, and representatives of various political 
bodies have been held. I would like it to be understood in 
Moscow, Yaragi Mamodayev said, that Dhozkhar Dudayev's 
unjustified postponement of the beginning of the Russian-Chechen 
talks does not reflect the position of the whole of Chechen 
society. A people's congress needs to be held to work out this 
position. 
  Yaragi Mamodayev again pointed out that open appeals by the 
Russian side to forces opposing Dhozkhar Dudayev risked 
aggravating the political split in Chechnya and could become an 
obstacle in the negotiating process. Yaragi Mamodayev distances 
himself from the opposition, explaining that he was appointed 
head of government by the legal Chechen Parliament in April of 
last year and therefore, represents the legitimate executive 
power in the republic. 
  Yaragi Mamodayev believes that the Russian leadership should 
have determined at the outset which authorities in Chechnya it 
considered legal and only then should it have begun any talks or 
consultations.

  [Text] Moscow, April 21 (TASS) -- A soldier of the Russian 
Interior Ministry troops was killed early in the morning today 
in the state of emergency zone of North Ossetia. A special-duty 
squad was blasted with fire by a group of armed people near the 
Volchiya mountain at 05.30 today, Andrey Rodnov, spokesman for 
the press service of the task force of the North Caucasian 
Interior Ministry district, told ITAR-TASS from Vladikavkaz. 
The squad was on duty near the villages of Sunzha and Kamgaron 
of the Prigorodniy District, where a number of civilians were 
killed by bandit groups recently and where the provisional 
administration decided to toughen security measures. 
  It is supposed that the bandits were laying mines on the 
road. Shooting started, in the course of which the soldier was 
killed. The bandits disappeared. The provisional administration 
set up a commission for investigating the incident. 
  According to the information released by commander of the 
Russian Interior Ministry troops Colonel Anatoliy Kulikov, in 
1993 areas of provisional deployment of army units and 
special-duty squads in the state of emergency area were fired at 
and attacked 126 times. As a result of it, seven people were 
killed and 133 wounded. This year 20 attacks were staged. 
Today's death of the Russian soldier is the first one this year. 
  The press servce of the Russian Interior Ministry troops is 
not disclosing the name of the soldier in order to avoid 
mistakes, until an official report comes from the command of the 
state of emergency area.

  Karachay-Cherkesia and Georgia are neighbors. For many

  In order to further discuss and coordinate where and how the 
border with Georgia should be equipped, the Karachay-Cherkesia

<F P=106> [Sergey Krayukhin report: "VECHERNIY PETERBURG Has Decided </F>
To Take Sobchak to Court"] 
  [Text] In the space of a week the dispute between the 
VECHERNIY PETERBURG editorial office and City Hall has become 
one of the most discussed topics on St. Petersburg radio and 
television, and in its press. The reason for this was Mayor A. 
Sobchak's directive No. 303-r "On the VECHERNIY PETERBURG 
Editorial Office," which some organs of the mass media have 
regarded as a all-out attack on the freedom of the press, while 
others have seen it as the authorities' natural and inalienable 
right. The VECHERNIY PETERBURG labor collective has decided to 
go to court to protest what, in editorial office's opinion, is 
an unjust verdict by the mayor. 
  At a specially convened press conference, VECHERNIY 
PETERBURG's Chief Editor V. Mayorov judged the appearance of 
directive 303-r to be a reaction by the authorities to a series 
of hard-hitting pieces in VECHERNIY PETERBURG which, in his 
opinion, gave rise to a desire in the powers that be to tame 
this recalcitrant publication. He regards as an illegal 
bureaucratic action the point in the directive in which the 
mayor gives instructions for a scheme to be produced by 15 April 
to privatize the newspaper VECHERNIY PETERBURG's property, 
stipulating that no less than 20 percent of the value of shares 
be made the property of St. Petersburg for a period of three 
years. Mayorov considers that if the state does have some right 
to VECHERNIY PETERBURG's property, it is to the closets and 
chairs from 1925 and the decrepit typewriters which it actually 
did supply to the editorial office once. 
  Many perplexing questions have been raised in the minds of 
VECHERNIY PETERBURG's editorial office by the point in the 
document signed by the mayor which talks about holding a 
"city-wide contest for the post of leader of the paper VECHERNIY 
PETERBURG's editorial office" in the period up to 15 May. 
Nobody can grasp what powers this "leader" has and why such a 
post is being established when there is at present a perfectly 
good chief editor elected by the labor collective, and this is 
regarded as an attempt by the mayor to make a resolute decision 
to move staff about in VECHERNIY PETERBURG. 
  But later at a press conference in the Smolnyy, D. 
Mezentsev, 
chairman of the city hall committee on the press and the mass 
media, explained in detail the city authorities' position. He 
reminded us that the idea of selling shares in newspaper 
enterprises came into being last fall at a meeting of editors of 
several St. Petersburg and central newspapers. The mayor's 
directive of 26 November fixed these views and ruling 303-r was 
issued to develop the idea privatizing St. Petersburg's 
newspapers. At the present time, the committee chairman 
emphasized, VECHERNIY PETERBURG's property and that of other 
publications in St. Petersburg belongs to the committee for 
managing municipal property -- that is, it is 100 percent state 
property. 
  As concerns the city-wide contest for the post of VECHERNIY 
PETERBURG's leader, it is a question here of a managing 
director, a manager, and not at all of a chief editor.

<F P=106> [Ivan Boltovskiy report: "Between Two Slogans. Notes on </F>
the Communist Party of the Russian Federation Moscow 
Organization's Conference"] 
  [Text] In the past, everything that belonged to the capital 
was called excellent. Now this is no longer the case. And you 
cannot say this about the work of the party organization either. 
  The city party conference of the Communist Party of the 
Russian Federation [CPRF] was held last Saturday. Committee 
Chairman A. Shabanov gave a very sharp and clear-cut description 
of the situation in the country. He compared the city's 
Communists with the home guard thrown into the very hell of 
combat operations. 
  Hard as it has been, a lot has been done. Primary party 
associations have appeared and have at least started working, 
councils are operating -- the intervuz [higher educational 
establishment] council and the council of leaders of 
enterprises; a discussion club is holding meetings, and 
scientific-practical conferences have been held. Of course 
there are the elections to the Duma. However, the party 
organization is not in the vanguard of events, it has not seized 
the initiative, it has not been able to act as the organizer of 
a mass movement. That, presumably, is one reason why it has 
lost around one-third of the Communists. 
  But here is the opinion of worker V. Sokolov, now a former 
member of the gorkom [city party committee]. 
  "I have received 50,000 rubles since January, and I have 
four 
kids. The youngest is three months old, and my eldest daughter 
is 13. If we all perished, the party would not notice. An 
ordinary mortal does not exist for it" -- these are harsh words. 
  But it is not an unfair complaint. The organization starts 
with comradeship. Now that enterprises are stopping and 
unemployment is growing, the need arises to create special funds 
for assistance to the needy, and the new gorkom should think 
about this. 
  V. Denisov, a representative of the Krasnopresnenskiy 
organization, tried to analyze the party's problems 
theoretically. 
  "We have lost Communists because certain party leaders have 
noticeably moved to the right," is his viewpoint. "This has 
manifested itself in the negation of the theory of class war, 
instead of which they are putting forward `state patriotism.'" 
  There is a big difference between the slogans of national 
liberation on the basis of a broad patriotic front, and state 
patriotism. The former is a struggle, while the latter is 
time-serving. It must not be forgotten that the memorandum on 
accord, composed by the presidential team, also takes refuge in 
the idea of state patriotism. 
  The speakers were unanimous that the prevalence of debate in 
the life of party organizations is generated by the delay in 
adopting a party ideological program. The Russian conference 
must finalize things. 
  The ideological turmoil is rooted in the party's lack of an 
adequate social base. For example, over one-third of the Moscow 
organization is made up of employees of higher educational 
establishments, and the rest are engineering and technical 
personnel, and veterans. There are few workers. 
  A social base cannot be found unless it is not fought for. 
The party is unfortunately conducting very poor work in 
production labor collectives. There were 18 workers in the 
previous gorkom, and now there are 10. One was elected to the 
Russian conference. This too is an indicator. It is 
characteristic that the discussion of the working movement 
seemed to be conducted only at odd moments. 
  The most important result of the conference is the decision 
to strive for the unity of Communists and to join the SKP-CPSU 
[Union of Communist Parties--CPSU].

<F P=106> [Article by Candidate of Historical Sciences Vladimir Burov </F>
under the rubric "Reader's Comment:" "`Why Do We Need a New 
Construction Project of the Century?' Asks Candidate of 
Historical Sciences Vladimir Burov"] 
  [Text] There have been extremely few details given about 
the St. Petersburg-Moscow high-speed rail link. That is why the 
majority of us believe that the issue here concerns the 
modernization of the existing Oktyabrskaya Railroad. This is a 
great error! The high-speed rail link is set to pass through 
conservation areas in Novgorod and Tver oblasts and the Moscow 
region. 
  The high-speed rail link will be protected on both sides of 
the track by a three-meter concrete screen -- a variation on the 
theme of the Great Wall of China. The territory of Russia's 
historic heartland will be divided in two although admittedly 
there will be some small crossing points for pedestrians and 
traffic. A fast highway and power lines will run alongside the 
high-speed track. In the conservation areas the no-go zone will 
be several hundred meters across. To that it should be added 
that according to the planners' scheme the route itself will 
become the axis for the formation of a megalopolis. In their 
fevered minds they have the idea (and it is being studied!) of 
creating a "two-headed capital city" on these ecologically 
fragile lands. The rapid development of these lands between St. 
Petersburg and Moscow will have unpredictable consequences -- an 
ecological and cultural catastrophe. 
  Hundreds of hectares of plowland, meadows, and forests and 
archeological monuments will be destroyed by the scoops of the 
excavators at this construction project of the century. The 
special levees that will be built will upset this unique 
region's hydrology. This is the watershed of the Volga-Baltic 
water system. The blow will be struck at its "solar plexus." 
All these factors would be highlighted by an ecological expert 
appraisal but one has not been held and the construction workers 
are already prepared to begin work. 
  At the local level in the oblasts and rayons there is a 
mounting protest from the population, scientists, and ecologists 
against the barbaric destruction of nature, archeological 
monuments, and the historical and cultural landscape. 
Individual rayons have withheld their consent to the laying of 
the track across their lands. The Russian Federation Committee 
for Land Resources and Land Management responded to that by 
issuing order no. 62 of 22 December 1993 confiscating lands in 
the designated area along the entire route from St. Petersburg 
to Moscow for federal needs under the high-speed rail 
construction program. 
  At a session of the State Extradepartmental Expert Review 
Council of the Russian Main Administration for State Expert 
Review of Designs and Budget Estimates for Construction Work on 
25 February an alternative to the high-speed rail link -- the 
modernization of the Oktyabrskaya and Savelovskaya railroads -- 
was proposed but without success. That would have been a 
European approach to the solution of the problem, combining the 
interests of protecting nature and cultural monuments with the 
need for technical progress.

<F P=106> [V. Neverova report: "Congress of Samara Patriots"] </F>
  [Text] Samara -- "We have perhaps been given one last 
chance." It was under that slogan that the first congress of the 
oblast's patriotic forces was held in Samara last Saturday, 
April 16. 
  The participants were representatives of various social 
strata -- workers, peasants, students, and the scientific and 
creative intelligentsia -- and various parties and movements -- 
ranging from communists to monarchists. This broad 
sociopolitical spectrum also determined the character of the 
documents adopted at the congress. They were -- a resolution "On 
Russia's National Security" with a proposal for early new 
elections of the president of the Russian Federation and the 
formation of a government of popular trust whose actions are 
directed not toward the demands of the IMF and the G-7 countries 
but the fundamental interests of the country's economy; and an 
appeal to the Federal Assembly not to allow affiliation to the 
NATO program or the holding of joint exercises at the Totskoye 
range. Colonel General Makashov took part in the congress and 
joined the oblast Council of Patriotic Forces. 
  By coincidence Yegor Gaydar was in Samara Oblast on the same 
days -- Friday and Saturday. His visit was linked to the 
recruitment of supporters for the party of the "working 
aristocracy and small shopkeepers" created by him. Ye. Gaydar 
had meetings in Samara and Tolyatti where the audience consisted 
correspondingly of functionaries from the local administrative 
structures, bankers, and entrepreneurs....

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The March `Basket'"] </F>
  [Text] The Committee for Labor and Social Issues has 
calculated the minimum living (physiological) standard for 
March. According to statistics, the average wage in February was 
115,300 rubles [R] with an average per capita income of R79,200; 
its correlation to the minimum living (physiological) standard 
was 158 percent. The same January index stood at 175 percent, 
which means that a decrease in people's earnings followed. In 
March, the minimum living (physiological) standard was R58,000, 
which exceeds the February rate by R7,800, or 15.5 percent. 
  The minimum living (physiological) standard for specific 
groups of people stood at R51,900 for families with children 
under six years of age; at R69,400 for families with children 
between seven and 15 years of age; with men between 16 and 59 -- 
at R68,300; for women aged 16 to 59 years of age -- at R58,900; 
and with pensioners -- at R40,100. 
  The increase in the minimum living (physiological) standard 
was primarily caused by a rise in prices for bread and flour 
products (42 percent), dairy products (20 percent), potatoes (19 
percent), and meat (10 percent). 
  Members of the aforementioned committee conclude that the 
financial security of college students, people receiving minimum 
pensions, and families with many children has considerably 
worsened due to the increased prices. Scholarships and special 
state allowances, which are issued to college students, 
compensate for 38.3 percent of their minimum living 
requirements; scholarships issued to students of vocational 
schools -- 27.4 percent; and allowances issued to mothers -- 
only 16.4 percent. 
  A minimum pension along with compensation payments stood at 
R34,300 (which is 85.5 percent of the minimum living standard). 
  It should be noted that in the majority of colleges and 
vocational schools, scholarships and compensations are usually 
delayed from one to two months. Over the first three months, 
allowances to mothers were delayed at many enterprises. 
Managers of enterprises attribute this to a lack of finances, 
even for issuing payments to employees, and the delayed transfer 
of assets designated for paying allowances to mothers. 
According to members of this committee, delays in paying 
scholarships, allowances, and wages trigger social tension. 
  The committee predicts that in April a 10-percent increase 
in 
prices will follow. Per capita income will remain at R87,000 
and its correlation to the minimum living (physiological) 
standard will stay at 136 percent. The standard of living will 
gradually decrease and will correspond to the level of the first 
six months of 1993. 
  In April, some 22 percent of Kaliningrad Oblast residents 
will live at or near the poverty line (in January -- 7 percent). 
These people will require social assistance from the state. In 
the meantime, some rayons of the oblast are experiencing 
exceptionally dire problems in providing social assistance to 
families which are poorly off. In Zelenogradskiy Rayon, for 
example, school meals were suspended and there is money to 
provide financial assistance to those who need it.

  [Text] The sole right to independently maintain foreign 
economic relations envisioned in the power-sharing treaty with 
the Russian Federation is insufficient to attract foreign 
investments, Tatar Vice Prime Minister Ravil Muratov said in 
Kazan Wednesday. He added that Tatarstan needed to win over the 
right to independently set export and import duties taking into 
account its own strategic interests and the right to set export 
quotas for oil for no less than five years. At present, the 
quotas are set for one year only. Otherwise, the Tatar 
government will be unable to guarantee foreign investors return 
on their capital. 
  Besides its external problems, Tatarstan needs to solve 
internal ones such as the introduction of private ownership of 
land in accordance with the Constitution, heal the credit and 
financial systems, create market institutions -- private 
enterprises, leasing agencies, insurance companies, banks -- 
capable of maintaining direct contacts with foreign partners. 
  Muratov said the present state of Tatarstan's economy was 
critical and needed immediate drastic reforms.

<F P=106> [Andrey Illarionov report: "Siberians Discuss Strategy for </F>
Stabilization of Economy"] 
  [Text] Novosibirsk -- A scientific-practical conference has 
been held in Novosibirsk with the following agenda: "A Strategy 
for the Stabilization of the Region's Economy: Problems and 
Solutions." It was organized by the Russian Federation 
Ministry for Nationalities Affairs and Regional Policy, the 
relevant Federation Council committee, and the Novosibirsk 
Oblast Administration. 
  None of the country's regions can get out of the economic 
crisis on their own today, but the immutable condition for 
getting the country out of the crisis lies precisely in a 
flexible and differentiated regional policy. In his report on 
the basic avenues of the state's regional policy, Nationalities 
Affairs Minister Sergey Shakhray spoke of the need to strengthen 
the state's regulating role in leading the country out of the 
crisis, backing federalism in conjunction with the development 
of local self-government. Developing this thesis, the minister 
said that a more clear-cut, strict and differentiated regional 
policy is needed today, geared to solving social problems, as 
well as economic and other problems connected with them. This 
concerns, in particular, the need for a certain redistribution 
of resources in favor of regions which do not have large 
reserves of natural raw materials, and which have found 
themselves in the most difficult economic and social position 
today. 
  Sergey Shakhray also spoke of the fact that Russians have no 
alternative to economic integration with the CIS states, and 
that this task is urgent and at the same time requires civilized 
ways of being solved. An era of the revival of Russia, its 
statehood, its economy, and the dignity of Russians, and the 
revival of the country's cultural and national traditions is 
imminent... 
  Sergey Glazyev, chairman of a State Duma committee [bureau 
records list Glazyev as head of Duma Economic Policy Committee], 
gave a report about the basic spheres of economic stabilization 
in Russia. Academic Valentin Koptyug analyzed the crisis 
processes in Siberia and possible stabilization models. Ivan 
Indinok, head of the Novosibirsk Oblast Administration, spoke of 
the problems involved in the approach to stabilizing the 
socioeconomic development of the region. 
  The participants in the conference have started discussing 
the problems of stabilization at section sittings.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Oil Dead End"] </F>
  [Text] Tyumen oil workers are not only losing the rhythm 
of oil extraction but also the market for their product. Uray 
oil workers, for instance, have been forced to cut their oil 
extraction by 200 tonnes a day. 
  And it is not only the Uray workers, Aleksandr Filippenko, 
head of the Khanti-Mansiysk Autonomous Okrug Administration, 
confirmed. All oil production in the Ob River area is currently 
in a similar situation. Why? The first reason is obvious -- it 
is simply unprofitable to extract the oil. On average in the Ob 
region the prime cost of a single tonne of oil is 100,000 rubles 
[R], yet it is sold (that is, simply pumped into the pipeline) 
for R65,000. But the oilmen cannot even get this money, because 
potential purchasers have no money either, and they are tired of 
selling on credit. It is, as they say, a vicious circle.

<F P=106> [Valeriy Vedernikov report under the "Legislators in the </F>
Region" rubric: "New Orchestra Members, But Obsolete 
Repertoire. Notes from First Session of Orenburg Oblast 
Legislative Assembly"] 
  [Text] Orenburg -- There had been a possibility that the 
session might not take place at all. On the same morning the 
oblast court might have passed its verdict on an action by V. 
Shapovalenko, the president's representative. The latter was 
insistently demanding that the elections in eight districts be 
deemed invalid. If the court had taken the side of the 
president's representative and deemed the decision of the oblast 
electoral commission incorrect, the deputies could have 
dispersed quietly to their homes. They would have lacked a 
quorum. The court adopted truly a decision of Solomon -- to 
send to Moscow a question on how to interpret a particular point 
in the statute on elections. It is not known when the reply 
will come or when the court session will now be held. 
  Another surprise awaited deputies at the entrance to the 
House of Soviets. It was, however, perfectly to be expected. 
They had to pass through a "corridor of honor" made up of 
students, teachers, and higher educational institution 
lecturers. They were standing with placards, sometimes with 
highly sarcastic epithets addressed to the local power and the 
central power. The deputies must be given their due: They 
responded with lightning speed and included this item on the 
agenda. 
  After these tribulations the session nontheless began with a 
speech by the chairman of the oblast electoral commission. His 
speech contained several interesting points. Among the 36 
deputies (11 seats are vacant pending repeat elections) 32 are 
Russian, two are Kazakhs, one is a Mordvinian, and one a 
Ukrainian. There was not a single representative of the Tatar 
nationality, the second largest in the oblast, in the 
composition of the assembly. Let us note that on the eve of the 
elections the Tatar sociocultural center had raised the question 
of granting a quota for the Legislative Assembly. How can we 
not recall those times when people in oblast party committee and 
soviet executive committee offices calculated, with an accuracy 
down to two decimal places, how many workers, peasants, and 
women there must be? Incidentally, there is not a single 
representative of the hammer and sickle in the present assembly, 
nor was there in the lists of candidates. The voters proved 
ill-disposed toward women, electing just one representative of 
them. 
  The election of the assembly chairman was no mystery. Senior 
Deputy R. Khramov announced that the only candidate was V. 
Grigoryev, who until the last day had been chairman of the 
oblast soviet. The organizing committee had met the previous 
day, attended by six of its seven members. Five voted for 
Grigoryev, and one abstained. This was himself. 
  The calm was shattered by Deputy Yu. Nikiforenko. After 
listing the shortcomings of the single nominee, he proposed also 
including A. Zelepukhin, leader of the oblast agricultural 
administration, in the lists for a secret ballot. An 
alternative for the sake of an alternative, you might think. In 
our democratic times it would seem a nonsense when a candidate 
runs for a post all by himself. 
  It really was somewhat uncomfortable to see what happened 
next. Deputies began simultaneously burning such a lot of 
incense in praise of the sole candidate that, if they had really 
been doing so, it would not have been possible to make out faces 
through the smoke. On the other hand, they told Zelepukhin 
without beating about the bush: Step down. Although he had not 
yet, in fact, been included on the lists for a secret ballot. 
  Then the "heavy artillery" was brought up. State Duma 
Deputy T. Zlotnikova took the floor. Tamara Vladimirovna 
advanced six theses, according to which it was necessary to vote 
precisely for Grigoryev. Let us leave aside five of them. The 
chief one was that Valeriy Nikolayevich is noted for his great 
decency and honesty. This really is so. He does not have a 
cottage, such as officials of exalted rank are engaged in 
building with poorly concealed enthusiasm, and he has not left 
sumptuous apartments to his children. "He still drives a 
Zaporozhets," the president's representative, who was sitting 
next to me, whispered in my ear. He was talking, of course, of 
private motor transport. The State Duma deputy concluded her 
speech by saying that, but for Valeriy Nikolayevich's decency 
and honesty, he would certainly have gotten into the Federal 
Assembly (!!!). I listened and thought: What were the feelings 
at this moment of V. Yelagin, senator and head of the oblast 
administration, who beat Grigoryev in the struggle for this seat 
on the Federal Assembly? 
  Yelagin concluded the debate. He said that he would be 
"pleased to work" with Valeriy Nikolayevich. He added: "Not 
over a cup of coffee, of course." He advised the chief of the 
oblast agricultural administration to work a little better in 
his own post. He emphasized, however, that, whomever the 
deputies elected, he would strive for joint constructive work. 
  Finally Zelepukhin took the floor. He said that he could see 
for himself that there was a whole host of work in the agrarian 
sector. He reported that this was the reason why he had 
declined the recent invitation to Moscow to take up a cozy and 
quiet post. Just as he was about to sit down again, he said, as 
though suddenly remembering: "Yes, I withdraw my candidacy." 
Valeriy Nikolayevich Grigoryev was elected chairman of the 
oblast Legislative Assembly in a secret ballot. The sole 
candidate got 35 of the 36 votes. Familiar, is it not? 
  Maybe it was not worth going into such detail about the 
first 
session of the provincial parliament. But I am afraid that the 
oblast Legislative Assembly is doomed to such a scenario by 
virtue of its composition. For it is heads of rayon 
administrations and leaders of industrial and agricultural 
enterprises who form the majority on it. They will assent to 
the executive, forgetting about their legislative role. Then 
the Orenburg voters will discover in surprise that they have 
engaged musicians for the "orchestra" who all play the same 
instrument.

<F P=106> [Article by correspondent Valeriy Vyzhutovich: "Code For </F>
the Steppe; Kalmyk Statehood Buried by Kirsan Ilyumzhinov"] 
  [Text] "By proclaiming its sovereignty and signing the 
Federation Treaty, Kalmykia has unequivocally expressed the will 
of its peoples for socioeconomic progress, national and cultural 
revival, and a higher standard of living for its population 
within the framework of a unified Russian Federation.... It 
thereby assumes full responsibility for its future." (Kirsan 
Ilyumzhinov, candidate president of Kalmykia, March 1993). 
  "No one will send us money and the republic's inhabitants 
will be in a lamentable state. Consequently, we must abolish 
the Constitution of the Republic of Kalmykia and dual 
citizenship, proclaim exclusively Russian citizenship, and abide 
by the Russian Constitution alone in the territory of Kalmykia." 
(Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, president of Kalmykia, March 1994). 
  The document adopted in place of the abolished Constitution 
of Kalmykia is called the "Steppe Code." 
<H5>  "I Did Not Prepare the Population...." </H5>
  Ilyumzhinov's address to an enlarged session of the republic 
parliament, when he proposed to abandon the Constitution of 
Kalmykia, was stunning in its suddenness, as much as in its 
abolitionist zeal. "I deliberately did not prepare the 
population," he was to say several days later before a large 
audience. "I did not even warn my assistants. If you were 
watching television, you will have seen how the faces of people 
sitting in the auditorium fell." 
  The president's legislative initiative has tempted people by 
the noble language in which it is couched: "To help Russia, to 
extend a helping hand to the Kremlin and to the Russian 
leadership, and to take a step in the direction of uniting 
Russia." 
  Until now, there has been no organized opposition in 
Kalmykia. Now there is. It is a rare example -- perhaps the 
only example in all Russia -- of political antagonists, 
communists and members of "Russia's Choice," joining forces. 
Members of the Agrarian Party, the Republic Party, the Party of 
Russian Unity and Accord, and the Oyrat-Kalmyk National Movement 
have cast aside their differences. The Union of War and Labor 
Veterans and the Union of Students have found a common language. 
Finally, a public committee to protect the Constitution of 
Kalmykia and Kalmyk citizenship and statehood has been born. 
Ilyumzhinov is extremely satisfied with this and has told the 
whole republic: "This was all planned beforehand.... I have 
exposed overt and covert enemies and people standing in my way 
in this process of restructuring and reorganization.... Lists 
will soon be published, practical conclusions will be drawn in a 
week, and I shall name names.... I have already dismissed four 
people. On Saturday, several leaders will write statements of 
their own accord." 
  The prayer-like introduction of the published draft "Steppe 
Code" is disturbing: "Throwing ourselves at the feet of the 
great prelate who now turns the wheel of modern teaching...." 
Kalmyks account for 45 percent of the republic's population, 
and only one-quarter of them are believers. Local Christians 
and Muslims, let alone inveterate atheists, are certainly not 
obliged to "throw themselves at the feet" of Buddha. 
  The draft invests the president of the republic with 
dictatorial powers. He may dissolve the People's Hural 
(parliament) before term if it "does not guarantee stability in 
society" (what boundless scope for interpretation!); recommend 
who is to be elected chairman of parliament and his deputy; 
recommend who is to be appointed head of the Supreme Court and 
the Court of Arbitration, chairman and deputy chairman of city 
and rayon courts, and so on and so forth.... 
  "Replacing the Constitution by the proposed normative act 
will legally consolidate the authoritarian system of government 
established in the republic, which has consigned to oblivion the 
principle of separating powers," an extraordinary congress of 
the people of Kalmykia stated. However, a Constitutional 
Assembly (by the nature of its tasks, it would, of course, have 
been more appropriate to call it the Anticonstitutional 
Assembly) was hastily formed under the strict control of the 
presidential apparatus. This burial team was knocked together 
from 300 people: 10 from every rayon, 50 from Elista, 75 from 
the executive, 25 (the whole of parliament) from the 
legislature, and 20 from various parties and movements. 
  Kalmyk statehood was ready for "burial" in three weeks. 
<H5>  Bidding Farewell to Sovereignty </H5>
  It was "buried" on 5 April, Ilyumzhinov's birthday. Morning 
pickets outside the parliament building noted the intersection 
of these occasions with a placard: "The president's birthday 
should not be the republic's death day!" (Local political 
folklore was immediately enriched with an oral version along the 
same lines: "Kirsan did not slaughter a sheep for his birthday 
-- he slaughtered the Constitution"). The hopeless words 
fluttered in the wind: "Shame on the gravediggers of Kalmyk 
statehood!" and "Mr. President, our Constitution is not for 
sale!" 
  Meanwhile, the crack troops of approval and support were 
entering the sessions hall. 
  "I mount this rostrum with great excitement and a deep sense 
of responsibility," a nice woman, a local doctor from the rayon 
and first in a line of disciplined orators, began reading. 
"Kirsan Nikolayevich has initiated a new, peaceful revolution 
in our society...." 
  Passing the baton of approval lasted four hours, plus an 
interval. A lone dissenter requested the floor, but the 
assembly unanimously refused his request. So the drafting 
commission proposed that the document be "adopted as a basis" 
(one vote against, one abstention), the president made an 
emotional speech of thanks, and the national anthem was played 
for some reason, despite the fact that the state no longer 
existed.... 
<H5>  No Sign of a "Second Kuwait" </H5>
  "So you are exchanging sovereignty for federal subsidies?" 
The president was not at all disconcerted by my question. 
  "What do you mean by exchange? There never was any 
sovereignty! Not real sovereignty. Only on paper. The 
republic has always been subsidized." 
  "But a year ago you promised that the republic would live on 
its own resources. `We plan to build economic relations with 
Russia on a partnership basis and give up the billions in 
subsidies.' That is a quote from your election program." 
  "Well, that I do not deny. Everything is being carried out. 
I still say we shall turn the republic into a single 
industrial, financial, and investment corporation. People ask: 
Where are the results? But it takes time for them to show. 
Only a year has passed since my election." 
  Yes, a year has passed, and there is still no sign of 
Kalmykia being turned into a "second Kuwait." There is no 
offshore zone (that is, a zone virtually free of taxation), 
which, it was triumphantly proclaimed, would take no more than a 
year to create. Furthermore, one in five families in the 
republic do not have their own Mercedes as promised. 
  There is none of this. There is an average wage of 36,500 
rubles [R]. There is the desperate need of the collective 
farmer, who receives approximately R6,000 per month, to 
slaughter his own livestock and "hitchhike" with sheep carcasses 
along the Stavropol-Elista-Volgograd highway, selling them at 
R20,000 each -- approximately R1,000 per kilogram. Otherwise he 
does not have the means with which to buy sugar, salt, candy, 
and vodka (he gets everything else, apart from manufactured 
goods, from his own kitchen garden and pastures). 
  Sheep farming and primary wool processing, which account for 
80 percent of the republic's total output, have been devastated. 
The sheep population has fallen from 3.5 million to 1.5 million 
as a result of disease, theft, and forced slaughter. 
  The catastrophic collapse of the economy and Kalmykia's 
total 
dependence on federal subsidies (in 1993 they accounted for 86 
percent of budget revenue) are Kirsan Ilyumzhinov's main motives 
for selling the republic's sovereignty. But there are other 
reasons to do with politics and the Criminal Code. 
  Request for Forgiveness 
  As head of several dozen private companies, banks, and 
exchanges in Russia and abroad, the origin of Ilyumzhinov's 
billions in capital is a subject of natural curiosity -- as yet 
not fully satisfied beyond a shadow of doubt -- for the media 
and, basically, for anyone unsure whether this money has been 
honestly acquired. 
  "The Internal Affairs Ministry and the Security Ministry 
spent five months investigating my commercial activity," he told 
me. "They found no criminal. Think about it: If I were 
involved in some shady business, would I have drawn attention to 
myself by running for president? I would have sat quiet and 
kept a low profile. Let them continue investigating: I have 
nothing to fear." 
  Yes, it is possible that they will investigate further: The 
top Russian leadership has suddenly begun to take a lively 
interest in the origin of Ilyumzhinov's capital, although before 
it seemed totally unconcerned. A letter from Russian Internal 
Affairs Minister Viktor Yerin to Russian First Deputy Economics 
Minister Andrey Shapovalyants has appeared in the press. It 
said that the Russian Internal Affairs Ministry has discovered 
abuses of specially targeted credit worth R14 billion allocated 
on preferential terms by the Central Bank to the "Steppe" 
Commercial Bank (Kalmykia) to purchase wool. The document 
continues: 
  "In order for Ilyumzhinov to profit from the the illegal use 
of credit resources, the "Steppe" Commercial Bank was set up in 
the city of Elista, the founders being commercial enterprises 
headed by him.... Under the guise of purchasing wool, 
Ilyumzhinov and his closest associates secretly converted 
money... and subsequently placed it in the accounts of foreign 
firms, including 2.5 million in the account of a private 
individual in Poland...." 
  It is unlikely that Ilyumzhinov wants an investigation to be 
set in motion. Particularly since the president of Kalmykia 
forfeited the trust of the top Russian leadership with his 
peacemaking march on the White House to Aleksandr Rutskoy at the 
height of the October events. 
  Thus the springtime efforts by Ilyumzhinov, hastily 
surrendering the sovereignty of his republic for use by another 
power, look like a request for forgiveness. For political sins. 
And for criminal sins, if the president of Kalmykia really is 
burdened with such, which no one has the right to say at 
present, other than the courts. 
<H5>  Direct Speech </H5>
  "I will introduce a state of emergency in the republic and 
simultaneously announce a moratorium on rallies, demonstrations, 
and strikes. I will terminate the activity of all social 
movements and organizations and close down many newspapers. I 
will adopt an edict on disbanding all political parties, popular 
fronts, and movements." 
  "I propose to introduce an economic dictatorship in 
Kalmykia." 
  "In order to increase production, I will introduce a six-day 
working week for the male half of society." 
  "When our standard of living is twice as high as that of 
other regions of Russia, democracy can run the show." 
<H5>  "Kalmykia Needs a Khan" </H5>
  These public statements by Kirsan Ilyumzhinov are so 
definite 
and unequivocal that they hardly require any comment. Others, 
on the contrary, need to be clarified and explained. 
  "I have invited Gaydar to become prime minister of Kalmykia 
and have received his preliminary consent." (Gaydar has not 
consented to take up this post, as he made clear in an 
interview). 
  "We are to conclude agreements with Russia and other CIS 
countries on dual taxation." (Dual taxation in tandem with the 
republic's planned transformation into an offshore zone is 
economic nonsense, as the former cancels out the latter). 
  "On instructions from Gorbachev, I went to the United States 
in 1990 as part of our delegation to discuss the question of 
buying grain." (Ilyumzhinov did not take part in this mission 
and did not have the official powers to do so). 
  "I have been invited to take up the post of ambassador to 
Japan." (According to information supplied by the Russian 
Foreign Ministry, Ilyumzhinov has received no such proposal). 
  "I have been nominated as mayor of Moscow." (Ilyumzhinov did 
not feature on the list of candidates for this post). 
  "The republic's Internal Affairs Ministry will be equipped 
by 
France." (According to the Russian Internal Affairs Ministry, 
this question can only be considered after the appropriate 
accords have been reached between the Russian and French 
Governments. The federal Internal Affairs Ministry has no 
information on possible supplies of French specialist equipment 
to Kalmykia). 
  These inaccuracies and exaggerations, to put it delicately, 
and this self-image -- instilled in the local public -- as a 
statesman renowned throughout Russia and the world are explained 
by observers in Kalmykia as a symptom of Ilyumzhinov's morbid 
vanity: "He wants to be first everywhere. He wants to be the 
person whose name day it is, the bridegroom at the wedding, and 
the corpse at the funeral." 
<H5>  The Constitution Is Up For Sale. But Is Anyone Buying? </H5>
  The political market is like any other market: Demand is 
formed by supply. But will the center buy the Constitution of 
Kalmykia and hand over the billions Ilyumzhinov is demanding in 
return? 
  Experts at the presidential administration's analytical 
center recommend that the Russian leadership "not make any 
long-term commitments with regard to giving Kalmykia subsidies 
and credits from the federal budget, issuing it with export 
licenses, and generally making concessions; all financial and 
economic relations with the republic should be arranged on a 
short-term basis." 
  The Russian president's press secretary, Vyacheslav 
Kostikov, 
was also cautious and restrained in his official statement 
responding to Ilyumzhinov's initiative: "The Constitution of 
the Russian Federation allows the status of a component of the 
Russian Federation to be changed only by the mutual consent of 
the Federation and the component in question.... The proposal 
made by K. Ilyumzhinov, as we are to understand from his words, 
deals precisely with the matter of changing the status of the 
Republic of Kalmykia. If it is proposed to retain republic 
status, however, Kalmykia must have its own constitution in 
accordance with the Constitution of the Russian Federation." 
  Representatives of several Russian republics have spoken 
out, 
calling the president of Kalmykia "a traitor and an apostate." 
  In short, Ilyumzhinov's proposal is not yet in broad 
political demand. He risks finding himself in isolation. 
Wishing to please everyone at once, he may please no one. The 
republic will not forgive his treachery (particularly if Moscow 
does not give subsidies and credits). The Kremlin will not turn 
a blind eye to his mysterious billions and political 
vacillation. Then the president of Kalmykia's "world renown," 
of which he never tires of reminding people, will only be 
prolonged by his regular visits to the Bulgarian prophetess 
Vanga and by his embraces with the Dalai Lama.

  [Text] Today Russian President Boris Yeltsin proposed at 
the meeting of the Russian Security Council that moves for 
settlement of the Bosnian crisis ought to be more energetic. 
Interfax learned that the Bosnian crisis had not been on the 
agenda. 
  Yeltsin pointed out that the Russian position on the issue 
remained the same. He also stated that utilization of military 
force, or such a serious air strike, without its prior 
discussion in the UN Security Council was unacceptable. 
  The Russian Security Council considered possible 
developments 
in Bosnia. Sources in the Russian Security Council told 
Interfax that the military approach to settlement in 
ex-Yugoslavia had been estimated as unproductive. 
  Yeltsin emphasized that a summit with the participation of 
Russia, the U.S. and other parties concerned could play an 
important role in solution of the crisis. 
  Interfax learned that almost all members of the Russian 
Security Council had spoken on the Russian policy in the 
Caucuses. Yeltsin stressed that the lack of a single state 
policy in this region was regrettable. He proposed that 
priorities of Russia's policy in the Caucuses be defined. This 
concerns not only the Trans-Caucasian region within the 
composition of Russia but also within the composition of the 
Caucasian independent states. 
  The members of the RF Security Council pointed out that a 
balanced and weighed approach to developments in the Caucasian 
Region in general was needed. 
  Yeltsin said not only the interests of the Russian and 
Caucasian independent states must be taken into consideration 
but also that of other states concerned. 
  To define the policy of Russia it was necessary to know the 
real problems of the region, Yeltsin underlined. All moves 
there must be based on unification of the Caucasian peoples 
instead of their separation. No prosperity would be possible 
for these peoples under a policy of disintegration leading to 
violation of the territorial integrity and further confrontation 
between the peoples and the states, he stated. 
  Yeltsin stressed that a single Caucuses would be in the 
interests of Russia and all peoples living in this region. He 
said primary attention must be paid to the proposals which could 
bring the conflicting parties together. For instance, when 
resolving the Ossetian-Ingush conflict it was necessary to take 
into account both old and new traditions. Influential leaders 
must be invited to participate in the talks. Everything 
possible must be done to bring about economic development of 
Caucuses and for providing jobs for the population, all of which 
could eliminate the existing problems, Yeltsin suggested. 
  Commenting on the relations with Chechnya, Yeltsin 
emphasized 
the necessity for a single basis for further dialogue with 
representatives of the official Groznyy so that Chechnya 
remained within the composition of Russia. 
  On support for Russian Cossacks, it was stressed that a 
special federal program must be worked out. The members of the 
Security Council stood for participation of Cossacks in the 
state structures, in particular in the army, in the border 
defense troops and in the law-enforcement bodies.

  [Text] Washington, 20 Apr -- U.S. President Bill Clinton 
has just spoken on the telephone with Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin. The leaders of the two states discussed the current 
situation in Bosnia and measures that the international 
community may take in order to urgently normalize the situation 
around Gorazde. 
  According to reports from informed sources, the prospects 
for 
widening the use of the NATO air forces against the Bosnian 
Serbs, a toughening of economic sanctions in relation to 
Belgrade, and the holding of an international conference on a 
Bosnian settlement, of which Russia was the initiator, were 
touched upon during the course of the telephone conversation. 
  In connection with his conversation with B. Yeltsin, the 
U.S. 
President postponed a news conference in the White House, 
earlier scheduled for 2300 Moscow time, by one hour.

  [Text] Moscow, 21 Apr -- A meeting between Boris Yeltsin, 
Bill Clinton, representatives of the United Nations and the 
European Union, to settle the Balkan conflict is possible within 
a month, Vyacheslav Kostikov, Russian Federation president's 
press secretary, told a Kremlin briefing today. 
  He said that late last night Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton 
had a long telephone conversation, lasting some 40 minutes. 
Vyacheslav Kostikov noted that during the conversation the 
Russian Federation president said "Russia and the United States 
have a common path of democracy and partnership, there is no 
crack in the partnership, but a sober and pragmatic account of 
national interests does exist." 
  The Russian Federation president again confirmed Russia's 
position with regard to NATO's bombing raids. "Russia is not a 
supporter of any party to the conflict, but it does have and 
will continue to have its own levers to influence the situation 
in the region," Kostikov said. He also said that during his 
telephone conversation with Bill Clinton, Boris Yeltsin yet 
again came out "categorically against bombing raids not 
previously agreed upon with Russia, and in response, got 
Clinton's assurance that the USA would refrain from sharp 
actions in this direction." 
  Vyacheslav Kostikov thinks that in order to settle the 
Balkan 
crisis, it is necessary to find "a single plan and to set about 
implementing it." "The attempt by the parties involved to get 
individual dividends from the crisis is doomed to fail and is 
not constructive," the press secretary emphasized.

  [Excerpts] Moscow, April 21 (AFP) -- Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin and his US counterpart Bill Clinton have agreed to 
hold an international summit meeting on the Bosnia crisis, 
possibly as soon as next month, a spokesman said Thrusday. 
  Yeltsin's spokesman, Vyacheslav Kostikov, told reporters at 
a 
briefing that summit was discussed in a phone conversation 
between the two leaders late Wednesday and would include in 
addition to themselves leaders from the United Nations, the 
European Union and the warring sides in the former Yugoslavia. 
  The two leaders, who spoke for about 40 minutes, agreed that 
the conference required careful planning but stressed that the 
situation was "red-hot" in Bosnia, Kostikov said. 
  "The assurance was given that all decisions to resolve the 
conflict would be jointly taken", Kostikov added. 
  "Any attempt at an individual, unilateral solution is not 
constructive," he said. 
  Yeltsin reiterated his firm stand in favor of peaceful 
solutions and his rejection of "any type of bombing" by NATO 
warplanes in Bosnia. [passage omitted] 
  In Paris, French President Francois Mitterrand expressed 
satisfaction over the planned conference, which he said should 
be held as soon as possible considering the urgency of the 
situation, his spokesman Jean Musitelli said Thursday.

  [Text] Moscow, 20 Apr -- Lord Owen, cochairman of the 
conference on the former Yugoslavia, has arrived in Moscow from 
London today. Thorvald Stoltenberg, another representative of 
this forum, is expected to arrive in the Russian capital 
tomorrow. The two diplomats will have talks with Russian 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev. The question of Russia's 
participation in political decisionmaking on Bosnia-Herzegovina 
will be at the center of their talks. 
  Russia should take part not only in drawing up the map of 
the 
division of Bosnia-Herzegovina and in the talks regarding 
sanctions against Yugoslavia, but also in adopting resolutions 
on the military actions that the international community should 
be taking in this region, Lord Owen said to journalists before 
his departure for Moscow. The Russians understand that we need 
to use force, he noted, and our key task is to get them on our 
side. What we cannot afford is to allow the UN Security Council 
to be split.

  [Excerpts] The well-known diplomats David Owen and Thorvald 
Stoltenberg arrived in Moscow today. This evening they had 
talks with Andrey Kozyrev. 
  [Correspondent Mikhail Aleksandridi] A news conference was 
held after their talks. [passage omitted] 
  [Aleksandridi] In Thorvald Stoltenberg's opinion, regular 
consultations between the co-chairmen of the Coordinating 
Committee and the Russian side had played an important role in 
the quest for a peaceful solution of the Bosnian problem. 
However, in the existing situation, David Owen thinks, it is 
necessary in order to attain this goal to employ a 
carrot-and-stick policy, that is to combine the threat of armed 
pressure with the lifting of the anti-Serb sanctions in the 
event of the Serbs preferring peace to war.

  [Text] Moscow, 20 Apr -- Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev and Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, the co-chairmen 
of the coordination committee of the international conference on 
Yugoslavia have spoken in favor of holding urgent consultations 
between special representatives of Russia, the United States, 
the United Nations, and the European Union in order to work out 
a common stance on the Bosnian settlement. They held talks in 
Moscow today. 
  Simultaneously, Kozyrev had a telephone conversation with 
Warren Christopher, suggesting to him that an American 
representative be sent to these quadrilateral consultations. 
The U.S. secretary of state has so far neither accepted nor 
rejected the proposal. 
  The result of the consultations should be a concrete plan 
for 
a postwar structure of Bosnia-Herzegovina. It will then be 
discussed at a quadrilateral summit and presented to the 
conflicting sides.

  [Text] Moscow April 21 TASS -- The United Nations, Russia, 
the United States and the European Union [EU] should propose 
clear goals and a realistic framework for an all-round 
settlement to the warring sides in the Bosnian conflict. Such a 
plan can be hammered out in a relatively short period of time, 
said international mediator, Lord Owen, here on Wednesday [20 
April] evening. 
  He arrived in Moscow on Wednesday together with Thorvald 
Stoltenberg for talks with Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev. 
  According to the co-chairman of the coordination committee 
on 
the international conference on Yugoslavia, many Serbs want 
peace and would be ready to approve a concrete plan as an 
alternative to war. 
  The Vance-Owen plan contained appropriate proposals. This 
document needs some supplements, taking into account agreements 
on setting up a federation of Bosnian Moslems and Croats and the 
talks on Serb Krajina in Croatia. 
  It is necessary to set up a mechanism which would enable 
representatives from the U.N., the EU, Russia and the U.S. to 
meet on a confidential basis and to agree positions. 
Incidentally, they do not differ much. 
  Owen explains the absence of Washington's immediate reply to 
the invitation to participate in quadripartite consultations by 
the attention given by American politicians to the request of 
U.N. Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali to continue military 
pressure on Bosnian Serbs. 
  Owen said that part of his delegation will remain in Moscow 
to continue consultations with the Russian Foreign Ministry. It 
is necessary, the international mediator stressed, that "the 
four" should meet as soon as possible.

  [Text] Russia's Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev has called 
for Russia, the UN, the European Union, and other parties acting 
to resolve the crisis in Yugoslavia to coordinate a single stand 
on Bosnia. He expressed this position in Moscow on Wednesday at 
the end of his meeting with the Co-Chairmen of the Geneva Peace 
Conference on Former Yugoslavia Lord Owen and Thorvald 
Stoltenberg. As Kozyrev said, "among the Bosnian Serbs there is 
a party of war, waiting for fresh air strikes to continue the 
war. It's people from this party who have been shelling 
hospitals and other civilian targets in Gorazde." 
  However, in the interests of all the Serbs the war must be 
stopped on fair terms and the lifting of sanctions should be 
gradually pressed for, Kozyrev said. These interests of the 
Serbs and of the other conflicting sides should be given a real 
chance, he stressed. In his words, at Wednesday's session of 
Russia's Security Council the Bosnian problem was discussed in 
the same key and on the basis of the statement made by President 
Yeltsin on Tuesday. We will do whatever we can to stop the 
bloodshed in Gorazde, introduce disengagement troops and put an 
end to the confrontation there. Kozyrev disclosed that in a 
telephone conversation with the American Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher he had asked him to send to Moscow the US 
President's Special Envoy on Former Yugoslavia Charles Redman, 
whose expertise, as Kozyrev put it, is as essential as that of 
Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg. 
  Regrettably, Christopher declined to give a clear-cut 
answer. 
So, the door remains open, Kozyrev said.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Boris Krivoshey and </F>
Aleksandr Krylovich] 
  [Text] Moscow, April 21 (TASS) -- "It is time to decide 
what result the international community wants to see in Yugoslav 
settlement," Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mikhail Demurin 
said. 
  Russia favours a "common and single position of the world 
community" on this problem, Demurin said. He believes such 
position should include "clear benchmarks and determination for 
ensuring the implementation of the adopted decisions," as well 
as "reflect the will of the international community to meet the 
rightful interests of all sides involved in the settlement which 
are moving along the path of peace." 
  He stressed that "there should be no doubts about the 
ultimate goal." in his view, it is important for Russia, the 
United States, the European Union, the United Nations and all 
other concerned countries to have a "common and clear-cut 
position." "Seeing the prospects for political settlement and 
having a clear vision of what the post-war future of the 
countries that emerged on the territory of the former Yugoslavia 
should be, one can make decisions on intermediate steps," 
Demurin said. 
  He warned, however, that such steps, if taken without clear 
understanding of the consequences, may be harmful for the 
settlement process in the former Yugoslavia. 
  Demurin described as "allegations" statements by today's 
newspaper IZVESTIYA that the Russian Foreign Ministry's position 
on the Bosnian crisis has allegedly not been supported by 
President Boris Yeltsin and is now being reworked. 
  He stressed that "these allegations are far from the foreign 
policy and the essence of Russia's foreign policy initiatives." 
He noted that there are "no disagreements, let alone 
contradictions" between the president and the Foreign Ministry.

<F P=106> [Report by A. Dubnov; from the "Vesti" newscast] </F>
  [Text] At a briefing for journalists in the Kremlin 
Vyacheslav Kostikov, the Russian president's press secretary, 
disclosed that the treaty on civic accord would be signed at a 
ceremony in St. George's Hall on 28 April. The final drafting 
work was completed yesterday and it was forwarded to the 
president and State Duma deputies for their attention. 
Vyacheslav Kostikov said the criticisms and proposals of all 
factions, including the Communists and the LDPR [Liberal 
Democratic Party of Russia], had been heeded in the treaty. The 
press secretary said that although President Yeltsin believes 
that the treaty will succeed, he also realizes that not 
everybody will support the document. 
  Vyacheslav Kostikov dwelled on the situation in the Black 
Sea 
Fleet. In his words, the Russian president is relying on Leonid 
Kravchuk's common sense. 
  Relations with the United States were also touched on at the 
briefing. During his telephone conversation with Bill Clinton 
last night, Russian President Boris Yeltsin confirmed that 
Russia's policies towards the United States remained unchanged. 
President Yeltsin noted that our states were striving for 
democracy. In the process Russia was mindful of both sides' 
interests. Kostikov quoted Boris Nikolayevich as saying that 
nobody would succeed in driving a wedge between himself and Bill 
Clinton and rejected claims that a crack had appeared in the 
Russo-U.S. relationship because of the Bosnian crisis. 
  Referring to Russia's attitude towards the Balkan situation, 
the press secretary said that the president regards our 
country's position as being unchanged. Russia has always 
objected to air strikes in Bosnia and we are continuing our 
attempts to persuade Serbia to cease fire and hold consultations 
with all interested parties.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Russian Deputy Foreign Minister </F>
Vitaliy Churkin by program announcer Nikolay Svanidze on 20 
April; place not given; from the "Details" program -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Svanidze] Today, Russian Deputy Foreign 
Minister Vitaliy Churkin gave an exclusive interview for the 
"Details" program. 
  You sensationally changed your position in relation to this 
situation. This happened literally yesterday, as far as I 
understand it, right? You gave this statement yesterday. What 
led you to do this, what did the Serbs do to make you believe 
that they are deceiving Russia, and that it is now difficult to 
continue talks with them? 
  [Churkin] But I have not changed my position. I believe that 
I did what was necessary, proceeding from the position that I 
have been following over practically the last two years. My 
position was a very simple one. That is that the great Russia 
-- so long as the Serbs ask for it -- can truly help the Serbs 
if they travel the path toward peace. We will help to point out 
that path to them. But if they travel a different path then 
they cannot expect the great Russia to help them. 
  But I was forced to make this statement, and I made it quite 
consciously, although in some comments now, especially in 
Serbia, they are saying it was an emotional one and that Churkin 
was speaking out, and so on. I was there for nine days and I 
received the quite distinct feeling that the Serbs are on the 
brink of a catastrophe, and not only the Bosnian Serbs, but all 
the Serbs. First and foremost, they will themselves end up in a 
catastrophic situation, and the whole of the rest of the world 
would be pushed into very grave events. Of course, I did not 
reckon that this statement would lead to some kind of turning 
point in policy, but still, I hope that for many Serbs this 
statement would make them think carefully, and, apart from that, 
in the practical sense, I felt that something had begun to move 
there. 
  [Svanidze] Who made you promises and broke them? Who, in 
your opinion, deceived you? You have in mind Radovan Karadzic? 
  [Churkin] Well, today I would not really want to name names, 
but I had the main conversations with Karadzic, although a 
totally dramatic situation developed on that day when the plane 
was shot down, and a massive bombardment, as it were, and great 
difficulties were threatened, and the election campaign was 
going on there somewhere, and I was, literally, as it were, 
trying to get a decision from anyone. I rang President 
Milosevic and talked to other Bosnian Serb leaders. There was 
even one moment when, in a telephone conversation with President 
Milosevic, I cried out in amazement: What, am I supposed to 
proclaim myself president of the Republic of Serbia so as to 
make a decision, as it were, on the issue? 
  [Svanidze] Vitaliy Ivanovich, you have a reputation with the 
country's leadership -- and with the president particularly -- 
for being an expert on the region. What steps do you recommend? 
Are you recommending that our policy in the region should be 
radically altered? 
  [Churkin] No. I set out from the position that we would 
continue to follow the policy of Russia as a great power. 
  [Svanidze] All the same, we have been openly supporting the 
Serbs. What is going to happen now? 
  [Churkin] I do not agree with that view. Russia was a 
communications channel for the Serbian side. When the Serbs 
were saying that the world community did not understand them, 
and relations between the Serbs and the world community really 
were complicated, Russia tried to use its unique communications 
channel, operating in conjunction with other members of the 
world community. At the same time, since we were taking an 
objective, balanced approach, we did not only maintain contact 
with them. Nearly every time I was in Sarajevo I met the Muslim 
and Croatian leaderships, as well as the Bosnian leadership. We 
will continue to take the view that if the Serbs find the 
strength to turn to peace, then Russia will go on playing its 
part, but if they do not, if this drama goes on and a small 
group of people, God forbid, manages to drag the Serbian people 
into disaster, then Russia must not...[pauses] The tail should 
not be wagging the dog. It is really quite simple. Then we 
have our own interests and our own positions, too. 
  [Svanidze] If I have understood correctly, then, you are not 
recommending that we give up on peacemaking efforts in 
Yugoslavia. 
  [Churkin] Of course not, of course not. I think that it is 
very important now for us to get out of the crisis in Gorazde. 
The situation there is like this: The Serbs have only to make 
one false move in Gorazde or anywhere else on the territory of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and the thing I have been warning them 
against will break out. So my conscience is clear. But events 
may take a different course. I do, in spite of everything, hope 
that we will manage to settle the Gorazde problem, and then the 
political efforts will definitely be resumed. We are actively 
involved with other countries on this. 
  [Svanidze] But if everything does, for all that, follow the 
scenario that you have outlined -- in other words -- if the 
Serbs do not change their position, and that leads to the result 
that you have spoken about -- a tough result -- what will 
Russia's reaction be? Or is that too hypothetical? 
  [Churkin] The question really is too hypothetical because 
there are different degrees of toughness. 
  [Svanidze] As a politician, you have scored a lot of points 
in recent months inside the country -- among the soft and the 
hard opposition, particularly. Even Zhirinovskiy has left you 
alone, apparently saying that this is because you are just about 
the only minister not to sell yourself to world Zionism. Well, 
now you have changed your position by making such an important 
statement. Are you not afraid that the credit you have gained 
will now be lost? 
  [Churkin] Well, I do not take account of credit. I do not 
see myself as a politician. I have absolutely no political or 
other ambitions. One thing concerns me: My personal worthiness 
as a professional and as a person. On the whole, I have had to 
make decisions two or three times in Yugoslavian affairs that 
were very difficult. But I always hold that if I get into such 
a situation, I must make the decision that I believe is needed. 
Otherwise, why bother? Let someone else do it -- if I am not 
capable of making serious decisions. So that is the way I work. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Svanidze] But tomorrow morning, President Yeltsin will find 
a modest, four-page printed note written by Vitaliy Churkin and 
approved by Andrey Kozyrev on his desk. It will lay out various 
possible developments of events in Bosnia and it will give 
certain political recommendations. The president will have to 
make a critical decision. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Yevgeniy Fadeyev report under the "`New World Order' in </F>
Action" rubric: "Whose Side Is Russia On?"] 
  [Text] Belgrade, 19 Apr -- Russian diplomacy has once 
again demonstrated the marvels of its unusual activity. A 
couple of hours after the statement on the situation in Bosnia 
by A. Kozyrev, the boss, and on the fact that he is an optimist, 
a directly opposite statement followed from his loyal deputy, V. 
Churkin. 
  The president's special emissary, who had recently become a 
real favorite of Belgrade (what a defender of the Serbs!), quite 
unexpectedly condemned the Serb side in Bosnia harshly and 
discourteously. Moreover, he announced that the time had come 
for Russia to end all discussions with the Bosnian Serbs. 
According to him, they are using the Russian policy as a screen 
for their own purposes, and they must understand that Russia is 
a great state, not a banana republic. And so on, and so forth. 
Here there are differences with his ideological leader -- not 
in nuances but on a whole number of fundamental positions. What 
is this? Does the right hand not know what the left hand is 
doing? The outraged self-esteem of the emissary, who did not 
achieve success in his latest shuttle trip to the former 
Yugoslavia? Or is it a hitherto unknown theatrical presentation 
for an estimable public? In actual fact, everything had 
evidently been rehearsed and staged in advance. First Kozyrev's 
nighttime peacemaking visit to Belgrade for a positive check 
mark in the Russian Duma's register. Then.... 
  "Several questions arise," today's VECERNJE NOVOSTI writes. 
"Will Kozyrev wish to `cool down' his deputy to some extent? 
Were Churkin's words fulfilling the function of pressuring the 
Serb side? Maybe this is an announcement of future exacerbation 
with the Serbs?" 
  In general, the recent moves by Moscow diplomacy create a 
strange impression, to put it mildly. Somehow a doubt 
involuntarily steals in: Is the opinion, widely publicized by 
Moscow, that Russia has returned to the Balkans correct? One 
more thing -- this is from a headline in POLITIKA: "Whose side 
is Russia on?"

<F P=106> [Pavel Felgengauer report under the general heading "Bosnian </F>
Crisis as a Pretext for Staff Intrigues:" "Grachev Thinks it Is 
Not Deputy Ministers Who Should Hold Talks on Peace in Bosnia"] 
  [Text] "I do not quite agree with Vitaliy Churkin; it 
would not be correct to accuse the Bosnian Serbs alone of 
violating the truce and delivering strikes," Russian Federation 
Defense Minister Pavel Grachev said, answering a question by 
your SEGODNYA correspondent following the signing of an 
agreement with Turkey on military and technical cooperation. 
"The situation in the Gorazde area is complicated -- both sides 
are to blame." He also said that on 17 and 18 April he spoke on 
the phone with General Radko Mladic, the Serb commander in chief 
in Bosnia, and asked him "not to attack Gorazde." According to 
Gen. Grachev, the Serb forces did not attack Gorazde "for those 
two days." But afterward "provocative actions by the other side 
followed." 
  Gen. Grachev said that "air strikes are very dangerous 
politically and they do not produce any military results. It is 
necessary to sit down at the negotiating table -- not for the 
officials who are currently holding the talks at the level of 
deputy foreign ministers, but at the level of heads of state and 
government." 
  Russia is not going to send extra troop contingents to 
Bosnia, because, according to Pavel Grachev, "an extra battalion 
will not make any difference; what is needed is up to 70,000 
soldiers, but this is unrealistic." But Moscow does not 
currently plan to withdraw its peacemakers, either. 
  Turkish Defense Minister Mehmet Golhan, on his part, said 
that his country is ready to send troops to Bosnia.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Abarinov report in the "Power" column: "The </F>
Bosnian Crisis as a Cause for Apparatus Intrigue. The Security 
Council Has Resolved To Continue Negotiations With the Serbs"] 
  [Text] The subject of a Bosnian settlement has suddenly 
taken on a scandalous turn. As SEGODNYA reported earlier, the 
day before yesterday the Russian Foreign Affairs Ministry 
prepared the text of a presidential statement, but the final 
text that emerged from the Kremlin office that day was a 
strongly watered-down version. It is not ruled out that this is 
a totally different text. At the same time, a Foreign Ministry 
spokesman denied "reports by some mass media outlets" about 
differences between Andrey Kozyrev and Vitaliy Churkin on the 
Bosnian problem. This statement is more than suspicious: At 
least we are not aware of any such reports. Yesterday morning a 
new denial followed, this time by Air Force Commander Yevgeniy 
Podkolzin. The general described as "speculation" reports that 
the Russian battalion can be withdrawn from Sarajevo. During 
the whole day there was a solid flow of denials and similar 
statements via various communications channels. Toward evening 
the presidential press service circulated a report about a 
session of the Russian Federation Security Council. The text 
says that the session, "in addition to the planned agenda," 
considered the "situation in Bosnia and the tragedy in Gorazde." 
It resolved: There is no tragedy. This is our comment on the 
phrase: "The possibility of a peace agreement on settling the 
conflict remains real." 
  Judging by a number of signs, what is now happening Moscow 
is 
not just an attempt to prevent a large-scale use of force in 
Bosnia, but an inner apparatus intrigue whose victim could 
become the president's special envoy, Vitaliy Churkin.

<F P=106> [Stanislav Kondrashov article: "Who Got Suckered in Gorazde </F>
and How"] 
  [Text] This time the contrast between what was said and 
what happened was striking. On his return from a lightning 
visit to Belgrade, Andrey Kozyrev informed journalists actually 
at Vnukovo Airport itself of the success -- an accord relieving 
the situation in Gorazde and, furthermore, in other Bosnian 
trouble spots as well. However, fresh reports almost 
immediately indicated the failure of his mission -- Bosnian Serb 
tanks were entering the suburbs of Gorazde, panic-stricken 
Muslim inhabitants were seeking refuge in the quarters of UN 
representatives, and among the dismayed UN and NATO leadership 
the question of continuing the bombing, which had provoked sharp 
protests from Russia and Kozyrev's visit, was raised with even 
greater urgency. 
  Last week was a week of Russian recriminations against those 
who until recently were regarded as lifelong partners, a week of 
large-scale demonstrations of great-power attitudes, if the 
pathetic assurances of the powers-that-be that Russia was, is, 
and will remain a great power can be understood as such. The 
declarations achieved unprecedented unity among all branches of 
power as far as present times are concerned. 
  I would remind you that the week began on Monday, when Boris 
Yeltsin communicated to Bill Clinton by telephone his 
undisguised irritation that no effort had been made to consult 
the great power before the first NATO bombing strikes on Serbian 
positions near Gorazde. The week ended on Sunday, when Andrey 
Kozyrev, after emergency meetings at night with Serbian leaders, 
informed the Russians that the china broken by the Americans and 
other NATO members was being successfully glued back together. 
  What then happened? On the first morning of the new week, 
with Serbian tanks in Gorazde, Vitaliy Churkin, Kozyrev's deputy 
and Yeltsin's representative, complained on the BBC that he 
could not remember so many broken accords as in recent days. 
The treachery of his Serbian interlocutors, like the specific 
"forgetfulness" of the U.S. and UN leadership prior to the 
bombing strikes, unfortunately indicate the same thing, namely 
that Russia's status as a great power is being called into 
question -- by action rather than by words. 
  And Russia's status has to be established by action rather 
than self-consoling words. And great powers' action means, in 
particular, a considered, consistent policy where ostentatious 
gestures to the public are accorded a more modest place than 
painstaking work, where flexibility is combined with toughness, 
and where politics -- as the "art of the possible" -- seeks to 
achieve the impossible, compensating for a temporary, let us 
hope, lack of authority and strength. 
  Former Yugoslavia has become a test bed for the practical 
search for such a policy. I, among others, was glad two months 
ago when Russia acquired its own identity -- and diplomatic 
niche -- in Sarajevo when it prevented through its timely and 
successful intervention planned bombing strikes on Serbian 
positions. In the very complex Bosnian situation this gain 
might have been said to be just for the moment, but it was 
consolidated by the efforts of Vitaliy Churkin, who himself 
deservedly acquired the reputation of being the prime peacemaker 
in that troubled region. 
  Has this identity -- and the niche -- now been lost in 
Gorazde? I don't think so, as the need for Russia's unique 
mediation remains. But if it has been lost, then it has been 
lost to no greater extent than that of the Americans and the 
leadership of the United Nations headed by Secretary General 
Butrus Butrus-Ghali, which is under the dominant influence of 
the West. 
  After what happened they were faced with a tough choice, a 
choice made more difficult by the logic of their behavior: 
Bombing "until victory," which could produce growing political 
and moral complications, or backing down, which means not only 
recognizing the failure of a strong, one-sided approach but the 
victory of the Serbian extremists. President Clinton would like 
to pursue America's manifestly anti-Serbian policy under the UN 
flag by means of NATO, within which not just American combat 
planes are employed. The ideal would be, they now think in 
Washington, to pursue U.S. global policy in general through the 
United Nations, with minimum costs in terms of dollars and 
potential U.S. casualties. Apart from anything else, the United 
States needs the UN smokescreen, according to commentator Jim 
Hoagland, to "reduce Boris Yeltsin's internal problems and get 
Russia to give Serbia a nudge under the negotiating table with 
its foot." 
  The civil war raging on the ruins of Yugoslavia is not the 
best test range for the present United Nations to rehearse its 
expanding peacemaking operations on. Unfortunately, Russia, by 
automatically voting in the West's wake during the early stages 
of development of the Yugoslav tragedy, helped the United 
Nations get more and more deeply involved and more and more 
bogged down there. Indignant or otherwise, the mandate for NATO 
bombing on behalf of the United Nations was sanctioned earlier 
by Russia's vote too. 
  Despite all the latest great-power recriminations, Moscow's 
task is not to recreate the former bipolar world of rivalry 
within the United Nations -- that has disappeared irrevocably 
into the past -- "if only" because neither the forces nor the 
allies to resolve this task are available. Nor does the task 
consist in being at the beck and call of the United Nations and 
the West, pulling the chestnuts out of the fire or sticking 
together the broken pieces as the pottery is smashed in the 
Yugoslav china shop where more than one bull is currently on the 
rampage. 
  Our own Russian niche means our own voice at UN headquarters 
in New York insisting on a modification of the current dead-end 
approaches. And the continuation and strengthening of Churkin's 
activity "on the scene," despite his growing weariness and 
perfectly understandable disillusionment. 
  Blessed are the peacemakers who toil unstintingly.

<F P=106> [Maksim Yusin report: "President Yeltsin Presents Ultimatum </F>
to Bosnian Serbs"] 
  [Text] The change in Russia's stance on the Bosnian 
crisis, which emerged after the Serbs violated the commitments 
they had given to Moscow and mounted the determined storming of 
the Muslim enclave of Gorazde, has been confirmed in a special 
statement by Boris Yeltsin. 
  The Russian president has demanded that the Bosnian Serbs 
immediately withdraw their forces from the besieged city, allow 
the peacemaking forces to enter, and lift the blockade on the UN 
personnel. Yeltsin confirmed his proposal to hold a meeting of 
the leaders of Russia, the United States, France, and Britain to 
elaborate a common position. 
  Moscow has put forward such an initiative in the past but 
the 
West responded coolly to it. This time the reaction was 
different -- the Europeans welcomed Yeltsin's proposal and U.S. 
President Bill Clinton called it "worthy of serious discussion." 
  A few hours after the Russian president's statement the 
Bosnian Serbs agreed to release the captured UN peacemakers and 
allow the blue helmets to enter Gorazde -- but only on the left 
bank of the Drina River. As for the right bank, which had been 
captured by the Serbs during recent fighting, they have no 
intention of leaving there, as Radovan Karadzic has 
unambiguously stated. Meanwhile, Yeltsin has demanded the 
withdrawal of Serb forces from all Gorazde's territory without 
dividing it into right and left banks. 
  The Russian authorities dedicated the morning of 20 April to 
the elaboration of a clear and coordinated position on Bosnia. 
According to information from reliable sources on Smolensk 
Square, there are serious differences of opinion in the 
president's entourage. Not everyone agrees with the Foreign 
Ministry's position, which considers further contacts with the 
Bosnian Serb leadership pointless. 
  It is understood that it was largely due to the efforts of 
the "pro-Serb lobby" that the original text of Yeltsin's 
statement, prepared by the Foreign Ministry and couched in 
extremely harsh tones, was ultimately changed. The reference to 
aggression and genocide by the Serbs disappeared, as did the 
assertion that "compulsion to peace" (for which read: military 
measures) is the only way of rectfiying the situation. Even in 
its final form, however, the document leaves no doubt about the 
direction in which the Russian approach is evolving. 
  Even the State Duma, which is well known for its virtually 
unconditional support for the Serbs, showed restraint this time 
and did not adopt a resolution on the results of the morning 
session dedicated to the situation in the Balkans. In order to 
clarify the situation it was decided to send a delegation to 
Belgrade consisting of the leaders of various parliamentary 
factions. 
  The announcement of the recall of the Russian ambassador in 
Belgrade for consultations, which appeared in the press, has not 
been confirmed. "No decision has been made on that score," a 
high-ranking Russian diplomat said. And he added, highly 
significantly: "Yet." 
  The Foreign Ministry pins the main hopes for a way out of 
the 
Bosnian deadlock on the holding of the summit meeting proposed 
by Yeltsin. "The permanent members of the UN Security Council 
must present a united front," Galina Sidorova, Kozyrev's 
political adviser, believes. "It is necessary to elaborate a 
joint position and implement it resolutely. It is time to 
review the concept of `special interests' and `special 
influence,' in Russia's case on the Serbs, in the U.S. case on 
the Muslims,, in Germany's case on the Croats, and so on.... As 
practice has shown, each of the warring sides has tried to prove 
to its theoretical allies that it is right and enlist their full 
support. As a result, differences of opinion have surfaced 
between the great powers, the united front was splitting up, but 
meanwhile the war went on."

  [Text] Bosnian Serbs are carrying out unthinkable deeds in 
Gorazde, a high-ranking official from the Russian Foreign 
Ministry told Interfax today. 
  "Even brothels have their own rules. However, Bosnian Serbs 
do not recognize them and are "raping" the poor Gorazde in the 
eyes of the whole world," the diplomat said. 
  According to him, the preparedness of many Russian 
parliamentarians to defend Bosnian Serbs only proves that they 
are using the Bosnian crisis as a trump card in their domestic 
political games. "Russian parliamentarians state they are ready 
to wage a war in Bosnia until the death of the last Serb. 
However, this does not make them differ from Serbs who are 
ready to fight until the death of the last Russian," the 
diplomat suggested.

  [Text] Aleksandr Vengerovskiy, deputy chairman of the State 
Duma, the lower house of the Russian parliament, has called for 
a military and political union of Russia and Serbia and for 
Russia to play a more active role in the former Yugoslavia. 
  "It is not NATO or the United Nations that should dictate 
their terms to the Serbs but Russia that must determine the 
policy there," said Vengerovskiy, who is one of the leaders of 
extreme nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's Liberal Democratic 
Party. 
  At a news conference in Moscow on Wednesday, Vengerovskiy 
criticized the Duma's decision to suspend debates on the 
situation in ex-Yugoslavia until the return of a Duma delegation 
due to leave for the war-torn country on Thursday. The Duma is 
trying "to get off easy by setting up another commission, which 
would engage in political tourism. 
  Commenting on his recent trip to Pyongyang, Vengerovskiy 
said 
relations between Russia and North Korea are today at a "zero" 
level. Asked whether he discussed the issue of the North 
Korea's nuclear facilities during his visit, he said that, when 
he asked whether Pyongyang had an atom bomb, his hosts replied, 
"We don't know."

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Kondrashov] </F>
  [Text] Belgrade, 20 Apr -- High-ranking diplomats at the 
Russian Embassy in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY] have 
denied reports by some of the mass media that Gennadiy Shikin, 
the Russian ambassador to the FRY is being recalled to Moscow 
for consultations. 
  In a conversation today with the ITAR-TASS correspondent 
they 
stated that they know nothing about such plans. What is more, 
they say, the present difficult period requires a redoubling and 
not a weakening of efforts to achieve a settlement of the 
Bosnian crisis. Nor would a reduction of the level of 
diplomatic representation in Yugoslavia be appropriate, since 
the Belgrade leadership is making great efforts to localize the 
conflict around Gorazde and is urging the Bosnian Serb 
leadership to take constructive steps directed at halting the 
bloodshed in the town.

<F P=106> [Maksim Iosin report: "Serbs Inflict Cruel Blow on Russian </F>
Diplomacy's Prestige"] 
  [Text] The continuation of the Serbian offensive against 
the Muslim enclave of Gorazde, which is expected to fall at any 
moment, is the most serious defeat for Russian diplomacy in 
recent times and leaves few hopes for a peaceful settlement of 
the Bosnian crisis. The efforts of Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev and his deputy Vitaliy Churkin, who tried to persuade 
the Serbs not to enter into confrontation with the world 
community and to end the siege of the city, declared a "safe 
area" by the United Nations, have proved to be in vain. 
  Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and Bosnian Serb leader 
Radovan Karadzic have not fulfilled a single one of the promises 
which they lavished on Russian diplomats. And now it is too 
late to discover whether Belgrade deliberately misled Kozyrev 
and Churkin, or whether the political leadership have lost 
control of the Bosnian Serb troops, which now obey only General 
Ratko Mladic, dubbed in Russian diplomatic circles "the Serbian 
Makashov" [general prominent in October coup attempt]. 
  Addressing journalists on his return from Bosnia, Vitaliy 
Churkin looked extremely disappointed. Never before have such 
hardline words against the Serbs been heard from his lips. He 
called on the Russian authorities to break off all contacts with 
the Bosnian Serbs, who, in his words, were using Moscow's 
intercession as a cover, and were simply stalling for time: 
"The Bosnian Serbs should understand that in Russia they are 
dealing with a great power, and not a banana republic. Russia 
must decide whether to allow a group of extremists to exploit 
the policy of a great country to achieve their goals. Our 
answer is unequivocal -- `Never.'" 
  "If the Bosnian Serbs fire just one more salvo against 
Gorazde, a huge crisis will erupt which will plunge the Serbian 
people into catastrophe," Churkin warned, intimating that in the 
prevailing situation there can be no question of lifting 
international sanctions against Yugoslavia. 
  And although on Tuesday morning Anatoliy Krasikov, leader of 
President Yeltsin's press service, tried to soften the impact of 
Churkin's words, calling his assessment "a personal view," it is 
hard to imagine that recent events will have no influence 
whatever on the policy of Russian diplomacy in the Balkans. 
Damage has been inflicted on the prestige not only of Churkin 
and Kozyrev, but on that of Yeltsin himself: The world has seen 
that even the Serbs -- "our historical allies and brothers in 
the faith" -- have disregard Moscow's opinion. 
  Hopes for a peaceful settlement to the Bosnian crisis remain 
very limited. UN General Secretary Butrus-Ghali has requested 
that NATO use its aircraft to defend the Muslim enclaves in 
Bosnia, and U.S. President Bill Clinton held a conference with 
his advisers 19 April, examining the possibilities of a military 
operation against the Serbs. And although Yuliy Vorontsov, 
Russia's permanent representative to the United Nations, again 
opposed air strikes without prior consultations in the Security 
Council, no one supported Moscow. 
  There is a growing conviction in the West that, now that the 
Bosnian Serbs have demonstrated how easily they break their 
commitments, it is hardly possible to bank on dialogue with them. 
  The easing of sanctions against Belgrade, which only 
recently 
seemed entirely realistic, is postponed indefinitely: Where are 
the guarantees that, as soon as sanctions are lifted, the 
Serbian authorities will not return to their previous policy? 
In that case the international community would be left 
powerless. In order to punish Yugoslavia again, Russia's 
support is essential, which can practically be ruled out in view 
of the changes which have occurred in our political life in the 
past year. 
  Contradictory reports are coming from the region of Gorazde. 
According to the testimony of UN and International Red Cross 
spokesmen, the city is "effectively taken." If news agencies 
are to be believed, Gorazde's death throes are continuing; the 
Serbs are subjecting the enclave to mass bombardment, but have 
not yet established control over it. 
  If the reports that the city has not yet been taken are 
confirmed, in the opinion of IZVESTIYA's interlocutors in the 
Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in that case, the Serbs 
still have a last chance to avoid a NATO air strike and at least 
partially recover Moscow's trust -- by calling an immediate 
cease-fire and withdrawing their troops from the besieged city. 
  If this does not happen, all the signs suggest that Russia 
will in no way be able to help either Radovan Karadzic or his 
soldiers...

<F P=106> [Reports by Aleksandr Stepanov in Berlin and Vladimir </F>
Peresada in Brussels under the "`New World Order' in Action" 
rubric: "Collapse of `Strong-Arm Peacemaking.' Will the United 
Nations and NATO Be Able To Draw the Proper Conclusions?"] 
  [Text] Berlin, 19 April -- The latest bloody impasse into 
which the resolution of the Bosnian problem has been driven has 
arisen thanks to military interference by NATO. This attests 
that, by following the gradual and quite irresponsible decisions 
of politicians, it is possible to achieve only a dramatic 
escalation of the stand-off. 
  In point of fact, FRG Foreign Minister K. Kinkel agreed with 
this assessment at a meeting with his colleagues from the 
European Union member countries. Of course, his judgments were 
far more diplomatic, and he still considers military 
interference justified -- how could it be otherwise? -- but even 
the head of German diplomacy has been forced to acknowledge the 
obvious: "This has not produced the desired results." This, in 
fact, could easily have been ascertained in advance from Russian 
diplomats, for example, who know both the state of affairs on 
the spot and the Serbs' national character. But no, instead 
they preferred to organize a public airshow. 
  Now Kinkel is appealing to Russia, asking it to use all its 
influence to induce the Serbs to pull back their troops from 
Gorazde. Appealing to that very Russia which there was 
"insufficient time" to warn of the air strike against the 
Bosnian Serbs' positions. The microscopic military effect 
turned into a crushing blow against the months-long peacemaking 
efforts of Russian diplomacy, which also has to its obvious 
credit its highly successful participation in lifting the siege 
of Sarajevo. 
  What has happened in Gorazde demonstrates very graphically 
the impotence of the United Nations and NATO and, most 
importantly, the total lack of any ideas whatever about how the 
Balkan problem should be resolved. Of course, it is far simpler 
to down aircraft and shoot up tanks from the air than to display 
a consistent will to peacefully achieve the set goal. But where 
is this goal? It long ago vanished beneath mounds of 
verbiage.... 
  Brussels, 19 April -- Did the NATO raids produce what was 
expected -- at least the psychological capitulation of the 
"target" in the face of the alliance's show of military might 
or, most importantly, hope of a move toward a political 
settlement dictated by this might? No, something else happened. 
NATO's military interference has led only to a radicalization 
of the belligerents' positions, as well as jeopardizing the 
contingents of UN forces in Bosnia, whom the embittered Bosnian 
Serbs are already calling "participants in the conflict" and 
who, accordingly, are increasingly frequently becoming the 
object of countermeasures which the West calls "repressive." 
  What now? To judge from available information, NATO's 
Brussels headquarters still proceeds, in principle, from the 
decisions adopted earlier. Namely, to carry out new raids if a 
request is received from the command of the UN Bosnian forces -- 
a request sanctioned by A. Akashi, the UN secretary general's 
special representative. But the internal situation within this 
"company" no longer appears as definite and clear as it did just 
at the end of last week. The events of the weekend, which 
showed the futility of the "strong-arm peacemaking method" in 
Bosnia, presented both the United Nations and NATO with a 
dilemma: to step up pressure or abandon it altogether? 
  NATO headquarters has not yet reacted officially to this 
dilemma, which Akashi recently formulated as a need to make a 
choice between sharply increasing the size of the UN contingents 
in Bosnia and withdrawing them, but on the other hand there is 
lively press comment on this topic. Diverse opinions are being 
heard, but probably never before have views which cast doubt on 
the present "peacemaking policy" as a whole been expressed so 
frankly and in such a generalized form in the newspapers. The 
newspaper LA LIBRE BELGIQUE, for example, writes that the losses 
borne by a number of Western countries in the course of 
expeditions under UN auspices make peacekeeping operations 
unpopular, and it is becoming increasingly difficult for some 
governments to continue this "humanitarian" policy. 
  But what is the alternative? In the opinion of practically 
all commentators, only the talks process can work. Mindful of 
the fact that it is constantly malfunctioning, however, LA LIBRE 
BELGIQUE expresses another noteworthy thought: Why not use, in 
the interests of a settlement, an additional trump card such 
as...the lifting of the embargo against the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia? 
  You probably could not invent a better epitaph for 
"strong-arm peacemaking."

<F P=106> [Sergey Ivanov report: "Somalia and Bosnia Not on Offer. </F>
United Nations Forms Additional Contingent of `Blue Helmets'"] 
  [Text] An interesting progression. Whereas in 1987 
peacekeeping operations were carried out by UN forces in five 
areas of the planet and the number of "Blue Helmets" was then 
10,000 soldiers and officers, today 70,000 UN troops are 
insufficient to pacify the warring sides in 17 hotbeds of 
tension. 
  Fifteen countries prepared to put at least another 50,000 
soldiers under arms have responded to the world community's call 
to increase the ranks of the peacekeeping forces. 
  In January of this year UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali 
authorized the French Colonel Gerard Gobyez [surname as 
transliterated] to poll the 184 UN members on the subject of 
their readiness to facilitate the imposition of order in the 
world. The Gobyez team flew to 50 world countries and entered 
into correspondence with the remainder. Fifteen countries 
declared their readiness -- the participants in the new project. 
The list of these countries is being kept secret until the UN 
mobilization plan is established. It is clear only that they do 
not include the United States. 
  There is no noticeable shortage of countries ready to act as 
donors of military force. However, there are only two states in 
the world capable today of realistically carrying this project 
through. Russia and the United States are the two countries 
which possess the necessary means to deliver "Blue Helmets" to 
trouble spots quickly. The UN troops need heavy transport 
planes, special naval vessels, and the appropriate medical aid, 
equipment, means of communication, and satellite links. 
  Russia's participation in this program is also under 
question, but, experts claim, this idea must be seized with both 
hands. The Russian soldier, having overstayed his welcome in 
the former fraternal republics, will be happy to see the world. 
Especially since, in addition to additional training, extra pay 
is also promised. And the operations plans will include only 
classical functions: the separation of warring parties on the 
basis of agreement, as is done in countries like Cambodia and 
Macedonia [FYROM]. Somalia and Bosnia will not be on offer.

<F P=106> [Correspondent Zdenek Horeni report: "Seven Presidents on </F>
Russia"] 
  [Text] Prague, 19 Apr -- Seven presidents of central 
European countries have advocated cooperation with Russia, but 
they also criticized Russia's desire to achieve special status 
for itself within the American Partnership for Peace program. 
  The seven heads of state met at the end of last week in the 
Czech city of Litomysl (roughly 100 km east of Prague) to 
discuss in an informal setting topical questions concerning 
their region, relations with Russia, and the situation in the 
Balkans. The initiator of the meeting was [Czech President] 
Vaclav Havel; the presidents of Austria, Hungary, Germany, 
Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia also took part. During a 
television discussion held at the end of the meeting the Czech 
president noted that "peace in Europe and the world as a whole 
is impossible without normal partnership relations between the 
West and Russia." At the same Russia was warned against trying 
to turn central Europe into its zone of influence. 
  The presidents of the Czech Republic and Germany reacted 
most 
sharply to the well-known Russian objections to the possible 
shift of NATO's eastern borders toward the CIS borders. The 
former stated that the period when the Soviet Union dictated to 
the socialist countries what they were allowed to join and what 
not, was over." The latter stressed that cooperation with 
Russia should rule out any desire on its part to "impose its 
diktat upon us." 
  The participants in the meeting in Litomysl stated that they 
are not seeking to create any kind of pact, although... 
Although they did clearly exhibit one tendency -- an 
anti-Russian tendency. The presidents of the seven countries of 
Central Europe did not adopt any documents at Litomysl. 
  The meetings of the Central European "G-7" will be 
continued. 
Hungary, in 1995, will be the next host.

  [Text] Within 10 days Ukrainian and Russian delegations 
are to submit to their heads of state a draft agreement on the 
division of the Black Sea Fleet. At a news conference in Kiev, 
Leonid Kravchuk confirmed that he has invited Boris Yeltsin to 
come to Ukraine on an official visit. This visit will take 
place after a large-scale treaty on friendship and cooperation 
has been prepared. The next round of negotiations on the 
division of the Black Sea Fleet is scheduled for 22 April in 
Moscow. Admiral (Ret.) Aleksey Kalinin, former Black Sea Fleet 
commander, expressed his discontent with the agreements reached 
in Moscow on the Black Sea Fleet problem. He stated that none 
of the decisions made in Moscow will satisfy the Black Sea Fleet 
servicemen: "People will relate to it negatively because the 
presidents treat the fleet not an instrument to protect the 
people's interests but as an instrument in political games."

  He said "Defense Minister Grachev, now in Sevastopol, will

  Vyacheslav Kostikov also noted that Boris Yeltsin's view

  Commenting on a KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA article on the 
possibility of war between Ukraine and Russia, the president's

<F P=106> [Vladimir Maryukha report: "How Is the Black Sea Fleet To </F>
Be Divided?"] 
  [Text] Will the Agreement on the Phased Settlement of 
Black Sea Fleet Problems give a boost to cooperation or will it 
undermine relations between Russia and Ukraine? 
  The 10-day period provided for in the Agreement on the 
Phased 
Settlement of Black Sea Fleet Problems, which was signed 15 
April, is expiring implacably, but there is still no mechanism 
of splitting the fleet in new proportions. Ukraine, however, 
continues to interpret unilaterally the document approved at the 
highest level, something that does not contribute to the 
attainment of accord. For instance, Ukrainian sailors and 
politicians have put forward an idea of setting up an Ukrainian 
naval base in Sevastopol so as to start talks on leasing it to 
Russia afterward. Given the agreement that the Black Sea Fleet 
and Ukrainian Navy ships will be based separately, the Black Sea 
Fleet will effectively lose for some time, if not forever, its 
main base. At the same time, in Sevastopol, local residents and 
the city administration stand for handing all Black Sea Fleet 
units and formations deployed in Crimea over to Russia and for 
Russian jurisdiction over the fleet's main base. 
  To all appearances, difficulties are also bound to emerge 
when specific shares of the two sides are calculated. First, 
because 15-20 percent of Black Sea Fleet ships are by no means a 
specific value. Second, Ukraine is not going to take into 
account in the negotiating process the part of the fleet it has 
already seized unilaterally, including a number of Black Sea 
Fleet ships and facilities. Despite the appeal by Vice Admiral 
Vladimir Bezkorovaynyy, commander of the Ukrainian Navy, to 
refrain during the expert talks from the "Ukrainization" of 
Black Sea Fleet units, pressure on Black Sea Fleet sailors in 
garrisons far-flung from Sevastopol continues with no sign of 
letup. The Ukrainian Defense Ministry, for instance, plans to 
set up a Ukrainian Navy Water Area Protection brigade on the 
basis of an Izmail-based brigade of small naval combatants as 
early as by 1 June.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Kuznechevskiy article: "Bone of Contention. Who </F>
Is Keen To See Russian-Ukrainian Relations Balkanized"] 
  [Text] Following the meeting of CIS heads of state 15 
April, the presidents of Russia and Ukraine were able yet again 
and for the umpteenth time to reach agreement on settling the 
conflict over the Black Sea Fleet. Leonid Kravchuk informed 
journalists that it had been decided to divide the fleet up in 
the ratio 15:85 in Russia's favor. However, on 16 April it 
became clear that this agreement would be very hard to implement. 
  As Ukrainian Defense Minister General Radetskyy explained to 
the mass media in Moscow, the correct formula was not the one 
approved by the countries' two presidents but a quite different 
one indeed: The fleet is to be divided in the ratio 50:50. Of 
the 50 percent allocated to Russia, 15 percent is to remain 
Ukrainian property which Ukraine is subsequently prepared to 
sell to Russia. The defense minister also explained Leonid 
Kravchuk's remark about Russia's henceforth getting the chance 
to use Sevastopol as a naval base, but on a lease basis. During 
his talks with Pavel Grachev, Radetskyy proposed basing the 
Russian part of the Black Sea Fleet at two other naval bases in 
Crimea rather than Sevastopol. 
  Such a radical rereading of this heated issue raises doubt 
about whether the fleet will finally be divided up in the next 
10 days as Leonid Kravchuk has promised and whether the problem 
will then cease to be a bone of contention between Russia and 
Ukraine. 
  Some people and some forces in Ukraine are evidently very 
keen not only to see the Black Sea Fleet issue remain on the 
agenda of relations between our two countries, but also to see 
these relations permanently deteriorate if need be. In fact, on 
at least four occasions already (at Yalta, Mukhalatka, 
Massandra, and Zavidovo) the two countries' presidents have 
reached a final agreement on resolving the problem of the Black 
Sea Fleet. And every single time people and forces in the 
Ukrainian Supreme Council, Ministry of Defense, and state and 
political structures have started to whip up the problem of 
Ukraine's national independence, and using this obfuscation they 
conceal the agreements that have been reached or reject them out 
of hand, not even balking at the prospect of placing general 
relations between our two countries on the brink of military 
conflict. 
  All the indications are that for some time now these forces 
have ascribed no importance whatsoever to their president's 
signature on agreements which would lead to an improvement in 
relations between the two largest Slav states. And these 
forces, apparently, have nothing except their desire for power. 
But in order to keep themselves afloat, they are extolling the 
notorious bugbear of nationalism. And this argument still 
works. There are people who are still prepared to believe that 
all Ukraine's misfortunes can be blamed on their northern 
neighbor. And people whose own interests are extremely far 
removed from Ukraine's genuine interests are shamelessly 
striving to reap political dividends on the basis of this 
enduring faith. 
  Unfortunately, there is still a possibility that 
Russian-Ukrainian relations will become Balkanized. Therefore 
we can only see one way of ensuring that relations between our 
two fraternal states do not turn into extreme forms of 
confrontation, namely restraint and a calm reaction to the 
outbursts of the nationalists, who have donned the garb of 
defenders of genuine Ukrainian national interests. On a 
historical scale, time is on the side of the restoration of 
close economic, cultural, and political ties between our peoples.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Kartashkov report: "Bosnia Is Only a Picnic... </F>
Why Do the Crimean Tatars Need Chechen Arms?"] 
  [Text] A few days ago chiefs of Russia's various special 
services, foreign and internal affairs ministers, and senior 
staffers of the presidential administration received a fact 
sheet saying that "certain groups in Chechnya have organized the 
illegal delivery of small and other arms designed for the 
Crimean Tatars living on the peninsula. The weapons are 
allegedly to be used to carry out provocations during the 
"all-people's poll" in Crimea, particularly, in order to prod 
the Black Sea Fleet toward active steps to prevent disturbances 
and to cause its standoff with Kiev." 
  Last year, when Russia halted its oil and oil product 
deliveries to Ukraine, Kiev signed an agreement on fuel supplies 
with Azerbaijan. Since Ukraine did not have money at the time, 
it paid with weapons. Now a part of the weapons is being 
returned as surplus commodities (!). One year ago, these 
"surplus commodities" were used to carry out active combat 
operations in Nagorno-Karabakh. 
  It is hard to believe that the Ukrainian leaders are unaware 
of the upcoming provocations. All the more so because recently 
Kiev has been replacing its troops in Crimea (primarily command 
personnel): servicemen hailing from Russia and the republic's 
eastern and southern regions are being replaced with those 
coming from western Ukraine. Also from there, "separate groups 
and formations of the Ukrainian Armed Forces' special purpose 
units" are being moved up to Crimea. 
  Last week, the conflict in Odessa briefly plunged the world 
into shock. The split of the fleet, which has been going on for 
several years already and which is seen in Moscow as a family 
dispute over property rights, has been assessed in the West as 
nothing less than a standoff between two nuclear powers. Former 
President Richard Nixon said in an interview for THE NEW YORK 
TIMES: "A conflict between Russia and Ukraine could make us see 
the events in Bosnia as a picnic organized by Sunday school 
children."

  [Text] Moscow, 20 Apr (ITAR-TASS) -- Today, the press 
service of the Russian president released the text of Boris 
Yeltsin's statement. In particular, it says: 
  "The Russian Federation is pursuing a consistent course of 
normalizing its relations with the Latvian Republic and moving 
them onto a footing of good-neighborliness and equal mutually 
advantageous cooperation with a steadfast observance of human 
rights. 
  I believe that the agreements on military matters, which 
were 
initialled this March, create a contractual and legal basis for 
the completion of the withdrawal of Russian troops from the 
territory of Latvia, and for a civilized solution to the issues 
connected with it. They have become possible as a result of 
sensible compromises and responsible approaches and meet the 
true and long-term interests of not merely the peoples of our 
countries, but of the region and Europe as a whole. 
  In this connection, I especially stress that we were not 
going and are not going to create military bases on the 
territory of Latvia. It is a matter only of the temporary 
functioning of one Russian military establishment under civilian 
control -- the radar station in the town of Skrunda. 
  I believe that in the very near future my meeting with 
President G. Ulmanis will take place, during it a package of 
initialled agreements will be signed, and this will become a 
turning point in relations between our countries."

Kostikov noted that President Boris Yeltsin, in his scheduled 
telephone conversation today with the Latvian president, might 
touch upon that subject. 
  The Russian spokesman said the Latvian Sejm had been 
"overwhelmed by emotions". He emphasized that Russia is 
interested in continuing the negotiating process with Latvia, 
expressing the hope that "time would solve" such problems.

  [Text] Major-General Aleksander Einseln, commander of the 
Estonian defense forces, who is on a visit to Moscow, made a 
proposal today to the Russian Ministry of Defense on creating a 
joint working group of the military of the two countries which 
would begin to monitor the withdrawal of Russian troops from 
Estonia. 
  Einseln met today Colonel-General Mikhail Kolesnikov, 
Russian 
chief of general staff. At the meeting ideas were exchanged on 
the activity of the working group on military issues at the 
talks between Estonia and Russia and on the opportunities for 
military collaboration of the two countries. Kolesnikov again 
emphasized that solving the issue of troop withdrawal together 
with giving social guarantees to the retired military living in 
Estonia is important to Russia. 
  As it became known to the Baltic News Service from official 
sources of the Russian Defense Ministry, it was confirmed while 
Kolesnikov and Einseln were meeting that the instruction by 
Boris Yeltsin concerning the creation of Russian military bases 
in the CIS and Latvia was drawn up by the general staff. The 
instruction, issued on 5 April, caused tension between Russia 
and the Baltic states, especially in relations between Latvia 
and Russia. Kolesnikov said that the text of Yeltsin's 
instruction published in ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI did not correspond to 
the truth. Today Kolesnikov (?brought for making public) the 
instruction's actual contents [passage indistinct].

  [Text] The unification of monetary systems between Russia 
and any other state, apart from Belarus, is not yet on the 
agenda. Tajikistan, however, is requesting such a step, Acting 
Russian Minister for Cooperation with CIS Countries, Vladimir 
Mashits, told a news conference in Moscow Wednesday. 
  As to the unification of the monetary systems of Russia and 
Belarus, it as yet not known when this will take place, said 
Mashits. The unification agreement requires amendments to the 
Belarusian Constitution and if they are not taken, the question 
will be raised again, said the Minister. 
  He said that now it was difficult to offer forecasts on 
whether the monetary union would cause an inflation leap in 
Russia, as some Western experts believe. Mashits believes that 
wage payment delays affect inflation in Russia even more. 
  Commenting on the results of the CIS summit in Moscow on 
April 14-15, Mashits named among the most important economic 
decisions the creation of a commission for the economic union 
under the coordinating consultative committee, the agreement on 
the creation of a free trade zone, the understanding on 
re-export, an agreement on the unification of laws for the 
creation of commercial, financial, isurance and other similar 
structures. 
  In Moscow the states had reached an understanding on 
cooperation towards labor migration. The CIS leaders recognized 
the benefits and guarantees for those who took part in World War 
II, and the families of those who died. The benefits and 
guarantees will be equal in the CIS countries, said Mashits. 
  Mashits noted the importance of Ukraine joining the economic 
union as an associated member.

  [Text] [Announcer Tatyana Komarova] We would now like to 
show you for the first time footage our correspondent managed to 
film. Missiles brought out of Belarus under an agreement are 
being placed on alert duty in Russia. 
  [Mikhail Zotov] In the village of Manan-Muchash, which means 
-- short end -- in the Mari language, not far from Yoshkar-Ola, 
a regiment equipped with missiles brought out of Belarus under 
the trilateral agreement has been placed on alert duty. You can 
see the missiles behind me. They are the newest strategic 
missiles, codenamed Topol, SS-25. 
  The military says these strategic mobile missile complexes 
have no computer program devised to eliminate targets in any 
country that might be a potential adversary. However, the 
on-board electronic systems are capable of retargeting the 
complex within a few seconds. Radar-proof warheads can reach any 
point in the opposite hemisphere. 
  Despite the fact that the army is troubled by many problems, 
the missile troops are relatively well-off, and in the words of 
Major-General Nikolay (Moroz), are capable of maintaining a 
guaranteed minimum of security and independence for Russia. 
  Meanwhile, the West is keeping an close watch on the Topols 
in Mari territory. Radar stations have registered the fact that 
our neighbors' satellites were monitoring the redeployment of 
the missiles. Space, however, remains the only place from where 
an outsider can watch Russian strategic missiles being placed on 
alert duty. On the ground it is only reporters from Ostankino's 
First Channel who can do it.

<F P=106> [Report by Boris Lysenko: "Give Back the Currency! German </F>
Government Demands of Zhirinovskiy's Party"] 
  [Text] Berlin -- When in early January this year the 
Berlin newspapers reported the sensational news that Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy's Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR] may be 
being financed from Germany, few people believed it. 
  Only one thing was known for sure: The German firm TFO GMBH 
following a ruling from the independent state commission for 
checking the property of parties and mass organizations of the 
former GDR, was subject to a search during which important 
documents were confiscated at the firm itself and at the 
apartment of its leader, Werner Hirche. According to Josef 
Dirdorf, leader of the German trust agency's "special property" 
directorate, these documents confirmed the suggestion that "TFO 
had intensive contacts with Zhirinovskiy." 
  Official representatives of the FRG's trust agency assert 
that in the fall of 1993, on the eve of the elections in Russia, 
V. Zhirinovskiy's representatives received from a representative 
of Hirche's company 63,600 deutsche marks [DM]. In 
October-November last year over the course of a month four 
representatives of Zhirinovskiy's party headed by Aleksey 
Vedenkin, the LDPR leader's financial adviser, were in Berlin at 
the invitation of TFO. The DM13,600 went to keep them and 
50,000 were transferred to Moscow. Now, through its lawyers in 
Moscow, the German trust agency is demanding that Zhirinovskiy 
return that sum to Germany. 
  The LDPR categorically sweeps aside the trust agency's 
demands. They say our liberal democrats are not familiar with 
the TFO firm. 
  Perhaps the FRG trust agency would not have managed to 
establish the true nature of the LDPR's relations with the TFO 
firm had it not been for one important circumstance. According 
to BERLINER ZEITUNG Werner Hirche, the firm's owner, has been 
"cooperating fruitfully" for several months now with the German 
law enforcement organs. With his aid the trust agency has 
managed to find our for sure how many German marks the Berlin 
company representative put into the accounts of his Russian 
partners in foreign banks. The trust agency has documents 
attesting that this sum was over Dm1 million. Thus, the 
accounts of Russian representatives in Luxembourg banks have 
been sequestered. They contain DM600,000 while a Prague bank 
contains DM840,000. 
  All your IZVESTIYA correspondent's attempts to find out the 
names of the Russian citizens whose bank accounts have been 
sequestered in Luxembourg and Prague have failed. The BERLINER 
ZEITUNG editorial office and the trust agency had just one 
reply: Specific information relating to the questions you are 
asking about is not yet being made public. In accordance with 
the federal "data protection" law it is not permitted to cite 
specific names until the end of the investigation. Most likely 
they are known to the Moscow militia but not to the journalists 
in Berlin. 
  The commission asserts that Hirche has already helped 
Germany 
to recover DM60 million. Hirche engaged in the "concealment" of 
Socialist Unity Party of Germany currency stocks. It was to him 
that the GDR's communist leaders entrusted part of their 
currency wealth. Hirche gave away to the commission the secret 
accounts of his former communist bosses in foreign banks. 
Hirche's truthfulness has thus been tested and his evidence is 
authentic. 
  So Hirche's testimony that currency was transferred to 
Moscow 
for the election campaign of Zhirinovskiy's party and also the 
existence of the relevant financial documents looks convincing. 
It will be very, very hard to dismiss the meticulous German 
officials. 
  The FRG mass media have taken up the LDPR leader in earnest 
and are beginning to investigate his "past and present with a 
fine toothcomb." The DM50,000 handed over to Zhirinovskiy 
belong to the German state and giving them to anyone is a crime.

Ostanin] 
  [Text] Moscow April 20 TASS -- The four-day official visit 
to Russia by Turkish Defence Minister Mehmet Golhan is expected 
to give a boost to Russian-Turkish military ties. 
  The first tangible results of the visit that begun just 
today 
was the signing an agreement on military and technical 
cooperation between the two countries by Russian Defence 
Minister Pavel Grachev and Golhan in Moscow on Wednesday. 
  During the talks, the two ministers discussed Russia's 
peace-keeping activity in the United Nations and the CIS. They 
also focused on the restriction of Russia's positions in the 
south, following the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the 
emergence of the Commonwealth of Independent States. 
  The sides also touched upon the Karabakh conflict, the 
Bosnian crisis and the implementation of the CIS collective 
security agreement. 
  Grachev will have a one-to-one meeting with his Turkish 
counterpart on Sunday to discuss prospects for military and 
technical cooperation between Russia and Turkey and other issues 
of mutual concern. 
  On Thursday, Golhan will lay a wreath at the tomb of the 
unknown soldier in Moscow, visit the Mil design bureau and tour 
a motorised infantry brigade.

  [Text] A military, technical, and defense industry 
cooperation agreement was signed between Turkey and Russia in 
Moscow today. The agreement was signed by Russian Defense 
Minister Pavel Grachev and National Defense Minister Mehmet 
Golhan. Both ministers noted that the agreement, which was 
signed at the end of talks between the two countries' 
delegations, bases bilateral relations on a sound foundation. 
During the talks, Russia once again expressed the changes it 
wants to introduce with regard to the implementation of the CFE 
agreement and briefed Golhan on NATO's Partnership for Peace 
plan and the sharing of the Black Sea fleet with Ukraine. 
  After the signing ceremony, the two ministers replied to 
questions by reporters. Grachev declared that Russia received 
approval from Armenia, Georgia, and Azerbaijan concerning the 
bases it wants to establish in the Caucasus, but the 
installation in Azerbaijan will be an early-warning station, 
rather than a base. Pointing out that his country wants to 
deploy Russian troops in bases in the CIS countries with the 
approval of the relevant governments, Grachev added that this 
must also be ratified by the legislative organs of these 
countries. 
  Golhan, in response to a question on Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
declared that from the beginning Turkey has been exerting 
efforts to put an end to the clashes, stressing that the status 
of the Turkish troops to be sent to Bosnia should be approached 
within the framework of these peaceful efforts.

  [Text] The negotiating process between the PLO and Israel 
is continuing, though not too fast and not in a direction 
favorable to the Palestinians, the PLO leader, Yasir 'Arafat, 
told a news conference in Moscow on Wednesday. 
  According to him, the Palestinians hope that during Prime 
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's visit to Moscow planned for April 24-27 
Russia will exert influence on Israel so that it would honor the 
agreements reached earlier. 
  As 'Arafat said, in Moscow he was convinced once again of 
Russia's positive attitude to the peace talks in the Middle 
East. Evidently for Russia the Middle East is not simply a point 
on the map, but a close-lying area, he said. 
  According to the PLO leader, a Palestinian delegation will 
arrive in Russia shortly to conduct negotiations on economic 
cooperation. During his "constructive" talks with President 
Boris Yeltsin, Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, State Duma 
Speaker Ivan Rybkin and Patriarch Aleksiy II he discussed 
prospects for cooperation between Russia and Palestine in 
different areas, 'Arafat stressed. 
  In particular he discussed Russian aid in forming a 
Palestinian police force. "We did not discuss that issue in 
detail, leaving it to technical experts", 'Arafat said. 
  He highly assessed Russia's call for convening a peace 
conference on a settlement in the Middle East -- Madrid-2 -- 
made last February. 
  With reference to the stand taken by Israel, 'Arafat said 
that Tel Aviv is playing for time. As a result the 
Palestinians' attempts to stimulate the talks process were 
futile. The commitments stated in the Declaration of Principles 
signed by Israel and by the PLO in Washington last September 
must not remain unfulfilled. The delays make it possible for 
the extremists forces on both sides to consolidate their ranks, 
and this might put an end to the peaceful political process, 
'Arafat said. 
  He said he hopes that Rabin's talks in Moscow will 
"stimulate" the negotiating process. "We want Rabin to make it 
absolutely clear whether he is for peace or not," 'Arafat said. 
"The time for words is over, it's time for actions," 'Arafat 
concluded.

  [Text] Moscow, April 21 (TASS) -- Russia has once again 
called on the warring sides in Rwanda to immediately stop their 
fratricide, put an end to senseless violence and return to the 
practical implementation of the Arusha accord with the 
participation of all political forces, deputy head of the 
Russian Foreign Ministry department of press and information 
Mikhail Demurin said at a briefing today. 
  Any positive motion aimed at an inter-Rwandan settlement 
will 
be met by Russian support and understanding, Demurin noted. "We 
welcome Organization of African Unity (OAU) actions aimed at 
stopping the bloodshed, and hope that joint efforts made by the 
U.N. and the OAU will lead to a turning-point in the present 
dramatic situation in Rwanda. In this connection Moscow 
supports the initiative proposed by the Tanzanian president to 
hold a peace conference on Rwanda in Arusha on April 23," the 
Russian Foreign Ministry official emphasised.

<F P=106> [Correspondent Andrey Krushinskiy comment: "Discovering a </F>
`New Continent': Start of Li Peng's Tour of CIS Asian 
Countries"] 
  [Text] Beijing -- "Deepening mutual understanding, 
furthering the development of equitable, mutually beneficial 
cooperation, and raising relations to a new level" is how the 
aims of the trip by PRC State Council Premier Li Peng to four 
countries of Central Asia and Mongolia which started 18 April 
are described in China. 
  Kazakhstan, Kirghizia [Kyrgyzstan], Turkmenistan, and 
Uzbekistan constitute for the time being almost an unknown 
continent for Chinese politics and economics. And an impressive 
"continent," one which combines a large market with very rich 
reserves of strategic resources and a quite well developed 
industry created during the Soviet years which promises to 
become a pretty important "pole" in world politics. Mutual 
understanding and cooperation between China and this region are 
still only in the formative stage: The exchange of goods is 
worth only millions of dollars and does not match up to its true 
potential. 
  By all accounts, economics will be the focus of attention at 
the upcoming meetings. Li Peng is accompanied by a large group 
of Chinese businessmen. Incidentally, present-day China is 
capable of giving these countries almost all they need, 
including both consumer goods and the products of heavy machine 
building. In other words, much of what those countries now lack 
as a consequence of the rupture of the many links that existed 
within the USSR. 
  There is no doubt that the interests of those states' 
relations with Russia will be taken into account during the 
upcoming talks in the four Central Asian capitals. Li Peng 
notably said at a press conference just before his trip began 
that his visit "could have only a positive effect" on those 
countries' relations with Russia and "could not exert a negative 
influence." China, according to him, would like the four 
countries of Central Asia also to maintain friendly relations 
with Russia." There is no doubting the sincerity of those 
words: Calm, stability, and prosperity in the region are really 
in the long-term interests of both Russia and China. However, 
in an economy (especially a market economy) competition in some 
form or another is an inescapable feature. However, I do not 
think that the chances enjoyed by the two states in this market 
are even. On the one hand, you have Russia, which was until 
recently powerful and influential but which is now rent by 
internal conflicts and is squandering its resources and 
destroying its economy, while, on the other hand, you have a 
stable, dynamic, and self-assured China which is rich not just 
in terms of export potential but in the practical experience of 
"shock-free" economic reform. In the eyes of many Central Asian 
politicians China is an attractive partner and patron. 
  China's growing political and economic influence in Central 
Asian countries is bound to work to their benefit and to the 
stabilizing of the general situation in the region. It is 
important, however, that this should not happen at the expense 
of the region's traditional relations with Russia; that, 
however, depends not on China but on Russia itself.

  [Text] Moscow April 20 TASS--"For the first time all CIS 
countries have agreed to (pursue) close integration and set up a 
single standing economic commission for economic integration 
between countries," Russian President Boris Yeltsin said at a 
meeting with the heads of Russian regional administrations in 
Moscow on Wednesday. 
  Summing up the results of the CIS summit meeting, Yeltsin 
praised Ukraine's decision to join the economic union as an 
associated member. 
  The CIS leaders adopted decisions on 26 political, economic, 
border, military and international issues. The president noted 
that they had also discussed the situation in trouble spots and 
ways to settle conflicts there. 
  Speaking about the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh and the 
Georgian-Abkhazian conflict, Yeltsin said "there are signs of 
real influence on the settlement of these processes."

  [Text] Kishinev [Chisinau] 20 April, TASS -- "A new meeting 
of the Moldovan leadership with leaders of the breakaway 
Dniester Republic is expected to be held shortly. It will be 
attended by representatives from the CSCE and by the Russian 
president's special envoy," Moldovan President Mircea Snegur 
told the newspaper ZEMLYA I LYUDI. 
  "But already before that meeting," he stressed, "all the 
barriers, obstructing economic relations between the left-hand 
and right-hand banks of the Dniester will be eliminated." 
  According to Snegur, customs barriers and other control 
services of the two sides will be abolished and traffic will be 
reopened across the presently blocked bridges." 
  The president again stressed that the Moldovan parliament 
would soon discuss the question of granting a special legal 
status to towns and villages with a compact Gagauz population. 
"After all," he noted, "nobody is encroaching upon the integrity 
of the state. They merely want autonomy within Moldova. Gagauz 
representatives had themselves stated that they could not 
imagine their existence outside the Republic. The point is to 
decentralise the government, to transfer some of its functions 
to the local administration, and to give broader opportunities 
for developing the market relations." 
  The Moldovan leader noted that "if the Republic shuts up in 
its purely national shell, it will not get any support from the 
civilised world. Moldova's prestige on the international arena 
will depend on how it observes human rights, on the state of 
inter-ethnic relations within the country."

<F P=106> [Stanislav Kucher report: "Duma on Peace and Peacekeepers"] </F>
  [Text] The Russian Duma has adopted at first reading the 
draft of a new law on peacekeeping forces. In full the 
document's title runs: "On the Procedure for Offering Russian 
Federation Military and Civilian Personnel for Participation in 
Operations Aimed at Maintaining or Restoring International Peace 
and Security and Other Forms of Peacekeeping Activity." 
  This means that it is planned to incorporate a military 
contingent, that to say, "Russian peacekeepers," within the 
Russian Armed Forces. Effectively, we already have such forces 
(the 201st Divisiion in Tajikistan, battalions in the Dniester 
Region and Moldova). 
  The main bone of contention in the discussion of the draft 
law was the question of jurisdiction over the peacekeepers. The 
parliamentary defense committee thought that the contigent 
should be set up under the Ministry of Defense. Another 
proposal came from the Ministry for Civil Defense Affairs and 
Emergency Situations, which came to the Duma with a proposal 
that the peacekeeping forces be placed under its own 
jurisdiction "so as not to distract the Army from fulfilling 
functions not appropriate to it."

  [Text] Extreme political decisions are taken when 
politicians find themselves in a hopeless economic situation, 
Commander of the Black Sea Fleet Admiral Baltin told INTERFAX 
commenting on last week's talks on the Black Sea Fleet. 
  On 15 April, the Russian and Ukrainian presidents came to 
terms on a gradual settlement of the Black Sea Fleet problem on 
the basis of the fleet's division. Ukraine is to have 15 to 20 
percent of the fleet. 
  Baltin believes that Ukraine will fail to ensure the combat 
efficiency of the ships and the normal functioning of the fleet. 
He noted that Ukraine had unilaterally established control over 
35 percent of the Black Sea Fleet. So 65, not 100 percent of 
the fleet will have to be equally divided, he said. 
  Baltin also announced that 18 months ago, Ukraine received a 
missile cruiser, small antisubmarine boats, small amphibious 
ships and a coast-guard boat, all of them new and 65-85 percent 
combat ready. None of these ships have been brought to complete 
combat readiness, said Baltin. 
  He pointed out, meanwhile, that if Ukraine had enough money 
it would have a unique missile cruiser not to be found either in 
the Black Sea, or in the Mediterranean or in the U.S. 6th Fleet.

  [Text] Kamchibek Shakirov has been relieved of his duties 
as finance minister for office abuse, sources close to the 
Kyrgyz leadership told INTERFAX. 
  The decision on Shakirov's dismissal was made at a 
government 
presidium meeting yesterday night. At the last session of the 
Republic's parliament which ended on 16 April, Shakirov was 
confronted with the accusation of having granted credits under 
privileged conditions. The Kyrgyz mass media widely publicized 
the fact that Shakirov had granted a soft credit worth 2 million 
sums (Kyrgyz currency) to his son-in-law.

  [Text] A communique on Tajik refugees was signed in Moscow 
on Tuesday during the first round of talks between 
representatives of Dushanbe and Tajik opposition, INTERFAX 
learned from one of the members of the opposition delegation. 
  The communique envisages the registration of all Tajik 
refugees who are currently outside their homeland. After the 
registration the UN should start giving them aid on a regular 
basis. So far, according to one of the Tajik opposition leaders 
Akbar Turadzhonzod, the aid was granted to only one camp of 
22,000 people in Afghanistan. 
  The inter-Tajik talks will continue in Islamabad (Pakistan) 
and Teheran (Iran) in a month, the personal representative of 
the UN General Secretary for Tajikistan Ramiro Piriz Ballon said 
at a press conference. He also noted the constructive role 
played by Moscow in the inter-Tajik settlement. Answering 
questions by journalists, Ballon said that he sees no 
contradiction in the fact that Russia has geopolitical interests 
in Tajikistan. 
  INTERFAX learned that late on 19 April the Tajik Government 
delegation is to return to Dushanbe.
